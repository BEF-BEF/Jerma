1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,120
Kenshi, so I hope you enjoyed that preload to the stream.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:18,820
Except I don't think anybody did. Turn on the vocoder, the audio tuner for Kenshi.

3
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:31,219
Um, I don't even think, I don't think I can even do that. I don't think that's even possible,

4
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:44,259
guys. That requires, that requires like an audio engineer to be on site. I have to explain to

5
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:52,649
Kim later what I should probably just do it now. She just heard me through the wall talking

6
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,009
about how I was gonna eat people's bones and like fucking murder them and shit. She's probably like,

7
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:04,840
is it a bad stream? Oh man, is like chat being mean and he's gonna eat them? Is it really bad?

8
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,569
It's got that bad? Oh, I need, by the way, speaking of loud noises, I gotta turn this back

9
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:22,980
on. Because my compressor is now off, now it's on. Would you look at that? So now it

10
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,060
shouldn't sound as awful, especially when I get loud. And it should be a little louder.

11
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:43,510
So loud. Well, I can change that. Don't worry. That's probably better. Is it better? I'm gonna,

12
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:49,500
I'm gonna go a little loud here. Whoa! That's probably better. Good. It's good. Okay. All right.

13
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,280
All right. So we're taking the frog crew into Kenshi. Welcome back, everybody.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,620
The last, I don't know what any of these mean. Does anybody know what these are?

15
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:13,699
Working, autosave, quicksave, get the book, l-u-l jubated, can I get away, post attack,

16
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:21,219
Vegas odds encounter, a new beginning, real timeline. It's just the top one, right? 80,

17
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:36,520
100 bucks? Oh! Does he remember any of this? No, I don't. Not at all. What happened last time?

18
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:46,710
I did buy a house last time. The house was purchased. What am I sipping on? It's just

19
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:56,169
coffee. It's just regular, just right out of the coffee maker coffee, nothing in it. Can you

20
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:10,939
see? Level one tadpole. But if you're still here and you, and you just wanted to see

21
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,879
a guy act like a dickhead for like an hour, well, welcome. Thanks for sticking around.

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,590
This is an interesting, this, hold on. This is an interesting game. This is an example of Speaks,

23
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,069
an audio compressive software. This is an example of Speaks, an audio, you know what I

24
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:40,250
mean? Like, stay here. The one thing that I have to remember though is, I gotta remember

25
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:47,990
like the basic controls, because it has been like a week and a half. Put war. War? No. All

26
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:54,620
right, we got, uh, Chatham, Adam Sandler. Let's give you a reminder of who everybody is.

27
00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:01,110
Frog, uh, Musk, Massamoon, and Canroth. Canroth is currently working on some projects over here,

28
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:07,740
and everyone's in the right spot, right? 8100 bucks. This is my house that I just bought.

29
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:19,430
Show Chatham's face. Why is everybody gathering out here? No, wait. Don't do the,

30
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:36,360
I, what is going on? Why is this guy like mind controlling every single person here?

31
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:42,569
Is this a bad, oh, it's a bandit. It's a bandit. Why are they just letting him walk around?

32
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,529
I have no idea. All right, so let's take a look at the map. This is the current home.

33
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:56,259
We need to do, I did an expedition out here with everybody. What do I have for food?

34
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,250
Because that's going to mean a lot. We've got, actually, I got plenty of food here.

35
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:16,810
What is, uh, okay. So you got all the food. Five dried meats, four food cubes. What is this?

36
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:23,639
Why do I not just put this on? Who needs armor? Well, Frog was going to stay here,

37
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:31,459
although I'm going to give the grog to, let's give the grog. I need to trade,

38
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:35,379
because this thing's worth a lot of fucking money. So let's get that over here.

39
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,939
Oh, I was trying, I was training people in the training dummies. Okay, that's the last

40
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:51,639
thing that was happening. So we got attack minus four. So this canned roth sucks. Chatham,

41
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:58,459
Adam Sandler, I believe can still practice, right? Yeah, okay. So you need everybody

42
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:06,620
to get to like plus five. The dog can't do anything. Frog Musk is just kind of standing

43
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:14,629
around. I forgot just how fucking ugly everybody was. So I want to do an expedition. I have,

44
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:21,269
I'm going to bring canned roth and the dog and Frog Musk. No, no, no, no. She's the one

45
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:26,069
that needs to come with it. She's the one that has any training. Who can just go out

46
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:31,100
and do something stupid? Frog Musk, maybe she should just go somewhere. This is lockpicking

47
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:38,180
training. Slaughter the dog. Why would I do something like that? Although I do need to do

48
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:52,300
this though, because this is kind of low on volume. Okay. Yeah. Unequipped the bags. I need

49
00:06:52,300 --> 00:07:04,579
a storage unit. Defense five plus three. Is there everybody's healthy, right? Well, not really.

50
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:14,170
I need a bandage you. Let's speed it up. Holy shit. This is taking like a full two days.

51
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:35,100
Put your camera in the window. Yeah, I could do that. So I'm part, I'm part of the team.

52
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,870
All right. Yeah, we're at a, we're at a boring part of the game right now, but that's

53
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,420
just wait till we get some training. Once there's training, then we can go from there.

54
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:02,569
I know this is a very polarizing game, but you got, look, I want this is, this was just a chill

55
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:17,850
stream. I'm just hanging out playing Kenshi. As long as you play GeoGuessr next, I'm good.

56
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:27,620
What do you do in this game? I'll show you real quick. Oh, by the way, uh, 700,000 games

57
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:37,100
part two is, uh, is actually, is actually ordered now. So it'll be here. That'll be

58
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:48,700
what we stream on you Thursday at Friday. In case you're curious. Oh my, is, is this bar

59
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:57,000
even going up? I'm on times three speed. All right. Yeah. This is not going to work. His

60
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,080
was going to have to happen. All right. So you get off of that. Frog Musk is going to

61
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:10,870
instead start training on that because that at least level you up once. So you are at,

62
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,830
I got to take the bag off of you. We need a storage unit. Oh, there's so much to do. Okay.

63
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:36,409
Hold on. Use. Uh, I need to, where is it here? Is it in a build? Okay. Storage, animal

64
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:45,080
feeder, armor storage box. Oh God. Storage, a storage for copper storage. You have to,

65
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:55,480
there's a different box for every single material. Shop counter. I just need to,

66
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,120
I need a place to put my boxes. I'm just going to put them on the ground

67
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,100
because I really, what am I supposed to do? I can't, I need to get like materials.

68
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:13,940
So just put this shit on the ground for now. I'm going to put this on. Oh my God. That's

69
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,659
minus 11. The defense is so bad. I can't even, I can't justify wearing this. I need to just sell

70
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:31,289
it. All right. So put this down. That puts me at minus two. What happens if I give this to

71
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:51,539
Frog Musk? No, he's still at minus two. Damn it. What if I put who does anybody in here

72
00:10:51,620 --> 00:11:00,059
even? Can anybody even, okay. With that bag off, nine plus four. She's the only one with any

73
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:05,980
training. He has to sit here for, everyone has to sit here all day and do this. So

74
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:23,100
Tana's one. Tana, who has the good weapon? I know one of you does. What happens if I do

75
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:32,730
this? No. I think, I don't know what to think actually. This is going to take a long time

76
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:44,009
because it's been, it's very, very clear that if I go out in the, in the wilderness, I'm just

77
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:52,950
dead. I'm trying to think of the correct solution here as to what I should do because

78
00:11:52,950 --> 00:12:03,350
nobody, everyone's worthless except for her. How much money do I have? I need like another

79
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:11,610
mercenary. That's not useless. Maybe I should just take her out and just fight and just

80
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:24,919
get beat up. I don't know because every time I take everybody out, they get their asses

81
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:29,799
kicked. And then, because who, what's the, what's the, what's toughness? Everybody at three,

82
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:37,100
ten toughness for the dog. Four, one. She has to go get like, she has to go get beat up and

83
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:45,639
fight. Let me, where's the, what are the backpacks that I just did on the ground?

84
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:57,049
Let's just open it up. I'm gonna take them all. Somebody has to be the food carrier

85
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:00,889
because it really, this is just so bad. But I mean, it doesn't matter anyways.

86
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,169
You're, this person's gonna be the food carrier because this is just a 100% useless

87
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:15,980
character. Even with the bag off, even with the bag off, this character is totally useless.

88
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,769
So you might as well just carry the fucking food. You need the best armor I can find.

89
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:33,899
Need med kits too. Well, at least you're at almost level fucking one, minus five.

90
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:45,820
God damn it. You know, 2020 hindsight, I should have off stream just sat here for

91
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:52,980
like two hours and just had everybody just get to level five because we kind of,

92
00:13:53,539 --> 00:14:06,419
we have to do this. There really is no other scenario. So how's everybody day to day? You

93
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:19,669
having a good day? The other scenario is to just have her get beat up outside. All right,

94
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:28,580
take the dog. Nobody has a job, right? Take, get rid of the jobs. What do you have for a

95
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:34,409
weapon? You've got, this armor is not that great, but you can at least hurt things. Level

96
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:40,009
five is still like nothing. Yeah. You can dump like 500 hours in this game and, and still

97
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:49,509
barely have a character. So there's a lot. I need to find a shitty bandit that the dog

98
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:55,269
and I can go fight together. So let's take some food. You just train your fucking lock

99
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:04,059
picking or something because you two guys, the two frogs suck. I got money. I need some food.

100
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:17,720
We'll just take it from you. You already ate it and go on an expedition. I need some first

101
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:25,509
aid kits too. Do you have any? You do. I've got one. Take a, take a few of them. I need

102
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:40,570
to heal because I'm not at full health. Okay. Do I have enough of, I got bandage. I got a

103
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,860
standard first aid kit. I got a splint. I might need another couple of first aid kits.

104
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:56,970
All right, let's go buy a couple of first aid kits and then I'm going to go and get my

105
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:11,769
ass kicked. I need a store. That's alt, right? Yeah. Some of the weapons have minus attack.

106
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:39,820
Yeah. Let's save it. What's a, what's quick save F9? F5. Okay. Let's trade. I got food.

107
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:50,440
You don't have any first aid kits, do you? Nevermind. I want blood. Well, that's not how

108
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:58,169
Kenshi works. Kenshi is one of those games where you can't go get blood because actually

109
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:09,640
you can. It's yours. That falls on the fucking ground. You just die. Well, you want blood.

110
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,720
You're going to see my blood. Do I, who, where can I? Oh, it's been like too long since I played

111
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,920
this to be completely honest with you guys because I just forget where everything is.

112
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:31,319
I know there's like a medical tent or something, right? Fuck. This might not have been a great

113
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:45,430
idea. He doesn't want to play. No, I just forgot that I'm at a point with an extreme

114
00:17:45,430 --> 00:18:00,500
amount of downtime. So, Oh, we don't sell anything. I remember hitting this point and

115
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,940
being like, all right. And then now it's like, I have, everyone has to train and shit.

116
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,240
I can't, there is no like run out there and fucking attack. We got to like actually

117
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:16,329
play it, you know? So that's what I, that's what I'm going to do. I want to just stay

118
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:21,259
today to be a relaxing day anyway. So I'm okay with it. I just need to remember where

119
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:24,859
everything is because there's a lot of information in this game. It's really easy

120
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:32,299
to have it just kind of slip away when you do other shit. So where can I buy

121
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:41,380
first aid kits? The bar? I've been into like almost every one of these places.

122
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,980
There's got to be like the adventurer's tent or something. I'm trying to remember.

123
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:04,099
Steal them. Oh, I just wish I fucking remembered where anything was. The

124
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:29,670
adventurer's tent? Wasn't I just in here? He had six kits. The scale avatar? 61. All

125
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,670
right. Well, I gotta go look because I can't just sit here. My brain right now

126
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:45,099
is like just turned off for some reason because I just bear with me here. I need

127
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:55,940
sustenance. All right. Where the fuck am I going? The bars usually have kits,

128
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:18,859
don't they? At least some of them do. I know there's like a medical tent.

129
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:34,150
Am I just not seeing it? The shop across from the bed store? Like this

130
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:48,019
place? Here's the bed store, right? Okay, good. There they are. How did I

131
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:50,980
miss those the first time? Because they're tiny. All right, that's good. I

132
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:58,259
don't want to spend that much money. All right, let's go. You two just train. Good

133
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:11,910
luck. I'm going to take you guys. Let's go. I was already down here. Let's go this

134
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:18,259
way because that's what like the weird bug people are. I'd rather just go.

135
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:25,769
Let's try to get like out here. So down this way. We have not seen over

136
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:35,269
here. Let's go. The reason why I'm taking these two. Oh my god. Sorry.

137
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,630
Is because they're the only ones that really can do anything.

138
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:42,549
And if anyone wants to get to fight, it's probably should be these two.

139
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:46,710
Because the other two are kind of useless right now. So they train.

140
00:21:47,609 --> 00:22:05,589
We go. What's this? Can I interact with that? No. Speaking of need to have things done,

141
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,539
you need to bodyguard and follow. And then we turn it on there. All right, let's go.

142
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:25,660
Match each other's speed. Pick up the cigarette butts. I only just noticed the webcam.

143
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:41,130
Can you just give me like some shitty dog or some shitty guy walking around?

144
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:48,700
Remember that wicked shitty guy? That guy just was walking around town and I

145
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,119
kicked the shit out of him like four times. I need just like a one guy standing around.

146
00:22:54,119 --> 00:23:08,220
What's down here? Not much right now. I can see them training over there.

147
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:26,630
Good. Keep going. I gotta save this game. I'm gonna get fucking collapsed on.

148
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,309
Someone's gonna come from stage left and rip my fucking teeth out.

149
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:36,440
All right. Looking good so far. Any resources?

150
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:52,940
That's not a resource, is it? No. Don't mind. No, I don't need to. I have plenty

151
00:23:52,940 --> 00:24:00,410
money right now. I have like $8,000. I'm good for mining. I need to discover a new place.

152
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:19,349
Well, just did. All right, here we go. Even if they're friendly, I think I'm gonna throw a

153
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:23,589
sword in somebody's head. I mean, that sounds terrible, but you know, I gotta work in reality

154
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:32,309
here, you know? I have to fight somebody that sucks. I have to get into a conflict with

155
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:46,759
somebody that sucks. Anybody in here suck? Anybody in here suck? 59 plus two. Oh my

156
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:52,859
god, we are such shitties. Welcome. Take a look around. Okay, well, what do you got?

157
00:24:52,859 --> 00:25:07,450
Let's talk. Show me what you got. A crossbow? What does this do? Katana. 120,

158
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:16,890
27 armor penetration, defense, attack bonus. Damage versus robots. 12 to 24 damage. Should

159
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:28,869
I get a crossbow? Oh, I forgot. Don't idle. I forgot about that. How much is a crossbow?

160
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:38,359
1,500? Should we make this character ranged? I feel like that would be helpful.

161
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:51,829
High. This is a good 16 to 28. Chatham, Madame Sarelin might have to be ranged,

162
00:25:51,829 --> 00:26:02,920
and then what? Build up dexterity, right? Cell value is what you buy it for. Yeah,

163
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:11,349
so I got, I got, that's 1,500. I think it's worth it. You have no ammo. What can I make?

164
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:21,349
I got ammo right here. Bolts, right? So that's 11 bolts, and I could probably make them.

165
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:30,500
It's 6,000. Well, I thought, didn't somebody say it's the cell value? Value 6,000. Oh,

166
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:36,980
that's how much I sell it to them for. This is six grand. Oh, so that's how much I can sell

167
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:49,220
it for. One person was trying to fuck with me. It's all right. So, um, steal it is what you,

168
00:26:49,220 --> 00:27:00,980
what the correct answer here is. Time machine. Raw meat. Uh, do you, do you have any to

169
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:11,430
sitting around? I wonder, okay, you got a chest back here, but I, there's probably nothing,

170
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:17,529
there would be in here. Weapon cabinet. Condition two. Should I wait till night?

171
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:34,200
Maybe just wait till it's dark out. All right, a couple people up here. This is some body

172
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,339
guard. These people are all, will kill me instantly, so no, I can't do anything here.

173
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:51,500
I gotta either buy it or steal food from them. Well, I know there's a crossbow here, so

174
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:00,869
some guards may fall asleep. That's true. I don't think, I don't think I can do anything

175
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:05,640
there. I'm just gonna have to keep going. Where's the rest of the party? The rest of

176
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:14,970
the party is back here, uh, training because they're just, they're just truly awful and

177
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:20,970
you can get up to five points on a training dummy. I'm going to switch off between them.

178
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:27,059
Lockpicking is training here, so they're back home. Your characters should get jobs.

179
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:37,700
Not yet. I need to be, I have to be able to withstand one punch before I go get like a job.

180
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:46,809
So let's take you guys down here. Let's keep going. I got plenty of food. I got plenty of

181
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:54,410
first aid and, uh, Madame Sandler has nine plus four, so not totally useless.

182
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:13,930
Why are you going up the mountain? We want Dr. Phil. No, no, Dr. Phil. Not today. What is this?

183
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:20,410
It's an iron. No, don't need a mine right now. I'm looking for new places and new people

184
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:28,569
because there, there's like a bunch of shit down here. I was told last time that down there

185
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:41,109
is worth looking at, so we're gonna do it. Why are you turning around? What's the frog gang

186
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:53,109
goal? Uh, to just live, just survive. That's all I can do. Look behind you.

187
00:29:53,829 --> 00:30:07,450
Oh, are you talking? Yeah. Just live. I've walked past a town. Well, there's, I got the town

188
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:14,019
right next to me. I want to get down into like the swamp area down here. Zoom out and

189
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:32,730
go back. Well, even if there is like a little town. Yeah, but no, it's. Take a look. Can you

190
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:38,490
guys hear like the children? I don't know. I don't know what's going on with like the children

191
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:55,079
I can hear. Uh, this is, what's this town called? The hub. Just hearing things.

192
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,599
Now I'm telling you, I can hear them. I can hear them. Let's go inside here

193
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:10,009
and I wonder what we can find. Fallout reference.

194
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:22,309
This game reminds me of Fallout 2. Take away a lot of the dialogue options.

195
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:29,619
And I guess like the guns, this like feels very Fallout top down ish. All right.

196
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:37,099
This is a new town. Is there anybody in here? This is still a holy nation outlaws. That

197
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:42,519
person's by that person's name is sans. In case anybody was curious, a bunch of

198
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:54,250
rundown, shitty buildings. I can buy this one. Do I buy this shack here? This town

199
00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:00,279
kind of sucks. What's even in this town that's worth doing?

200
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:13,930
Holy shit. Look at this place. 4,800. This is a big house, but I'm in the real estate is

201
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,180
I don't think it's worth it. There's nothing here to. I'm going to have to rebuild the whole

202
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:33,029
town. You could make it your own town. I guess. Yeah, that's true. I don't have the money to

203
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:45,109
rebuild the whole town. Welcome friend. Let's do business. What do you got? More, uh,

204
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:56,809
more crossbows, bolts, polearm. What's this one? Cutting damage 47, cutting damage 29.

205
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,940
No, I mean, it's plus six attack bonus. This was plus four minus 30% armor penetration

206
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:11,509
and damage versus animals. That's not bad. Crossbow would be good.

207
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:23,900
I just, I can't reliably have bolts though. Anybody upstairs? Who are you? Talk to stone.

208
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:31,509
Need yourself a gunner. I promise you I've got good eyes. Eyes of a hawk been manning turrets

209
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:38,150
since before I sprouted a beard on my face. The guy doesn't have a beard. Maybe how much?

210
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:49,740
6,000 cats is all I ask that and a clan to watch my back. I don't have 6,000.

211
00:33:50,299 --> 00:34:01,430
Why is my dog growl? What the fuck is going on? Who are these? Oh, I just thought the

212
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:10,570
ton was being raided by like mutant taffy. God. All right. I don't even have turrets. Yeah,

213
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:24,500
forget about that guy. Anybody else? Maybe I should just buy that guy. Does that mean

214
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:31,769
he comes pre-packaged with good attack? At least good enough. You know what I mean? Does

215
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:44,940
this guy come with like all the assembly? I just have to build it. That's a lot of money,

216
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:55,530
but still. Pacifier, bar, thug, drunk. Need some organs. I can get kidneys,

217
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:01,829
spleens, limbs, whatever you want. All working and tested. Best quality. You're creepy. How do

218
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:09,639
you test organs? I need to talk to someone over here for a sec. How do you test organs?

219
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,849
Only with the best scientific equipment. That's how I'd give these kidneys to my

220
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:26,170
own mother if she was still alive. Ocrin, bless her bones. That sounds like bullshit.

221
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:30,650
Then I get out of my face, stop asking questions. No one's forcing you to buy them.

222
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:42,699
The fuck is that? All right. Well, I'm going to do something here. I'm going to save.

223
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,500
I don't want to see what this guy's worth. 6,000 cats. Everyone else was three.

224
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:56,900
That means he's worth it. I want to try, but I just want to see how much- what his attack

225
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:10,980
points are. He's a scammer. I mean, he's got 11 plus 12. That's not bad to start. 11

226
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:31,030
plus 12? Everybody that's been free has been shitty. Well, I guess not. He claimed he was

227
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:37,449
a gunman. Yeah, but maybe I need that. I might need a gunner. Anybody to expand my crew, guys?

228
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:44,820
All right. Well, this town is- there's nobody here. All right. Hold on a minute. Who are you?

229
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:55,739
Wait, wait, wait, wait. We got some interactions here. Heft. Had not a city. Need any recruits?

230
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:04,710
Yeah. Sure, but I'll need 3,000 cats first. Help me out and I'll work off my debt for

231
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:13,900
you. You're trying to rip me off. I ain't trying to rip you off. Four plus three,

232
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:26,539
minus four, minus five. You want $3,000? What's up with that? Anybody else in here?

233
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,550
You got to give me something to work with if you want that kind of money.

234
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:48,309
Any other spot to go? There's like a rum in here or empty rum. Is there any other spot?

235
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:59,699
Because there's one bar and then- there ain't shit over here. This place is just destroyed.

236
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,789
There's nowhere else I can go. It's just this place right here.

237
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:23,659
Go into the tower. I guess I'll go in the tower. Somebody's standing out here. Thief boss.

238
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:34,170
Thief boss. Is this a fence? So you want in on the shinobi. The guards try to lay the crack

239
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,929
down, but they ain't fooling nobody. They're nothing. Nothing. A few cats can. I want to

240
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:49,530
join the shinobi thieves. Should I- should I be a thief? I think that's what I'm gonna do.

241
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:57,059
You can join for a fee. That's it. I don't have to complete a test to prove myself or anything.

242
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:01,780
Do I look like I've got time for handing out busy work? No, this is a business we're running,

243
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:09,739
not a social club. Just one time membership fee of 10,000 cats. I'm- I- I could-

244
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:17,480
yeah, the thieves guild. What do you think they're doing to me? They're robbing me

245
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,559
right now. What do I get in return? You get yourself allies. We have hideouts like this

246
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:27,159
one in lots of major towns. We watch each other's backs. Shinobi thieves stick together. Okay,

247
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:31,320
worth it. It's a safe haven for you to rest and recover. We have specialist training equipment

248
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,000
to use. You can sell your stolen items to our fence, and they also sell some hard-to-find

249
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:46,730
specialist equipment at a huge discount. Okay. How you guys doing over here? You ready to go,

250
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:53,300
like, sell everything you own? We gotta get money, because that's a very- I- allies. I

251
00:39:53,300 --> 00:40:02,760
heard the word allies. This boomer is about to get scammed. I'm not gonna get scammed.

252
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:13,030
Here you go. Like, I gotta go into, like, a better spot. Is there even- there is no good spot for a

253
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:20,840
webcam. Because I feel like this is distracting down here. Is this- this is distracting down

254
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:30,010
here. Top left, but then I'm, like, looking the wrong way. I'm gonna have to, like, spin

255
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:41,449
this around. See? That's, like, kind of better, isn't it? Yeah, that's too distracting

256
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:49,659
down there. All right. All right. Now, this is what we- this is what we started. This is

257
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:53,980
what we- I know. I know a lot of people, you know, maybe- maybe it's about a bunch of

258
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:59,179
people left. People didn't want to watch this. You know what I mean? It's boring. But, I mean,

259
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:04,659
some- this is fun, you know? I just- we're just having fun. We're just chilling out.

260
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:09,539
I know it might not be the most interesting stream we've ever been to, but it's all good.

261
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,500
Sometimes you gotta do one of these. I need to just chill sometimes, you know?

262
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,900
Now I'm, like, fucking- let's go. I was a little, like, concerned at first,

263
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,059
because I thought I was gonna be so lost, but now I'm- I am- I'm found. I have been

264
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:35,179
found. It just takes a minute to get back into it and get ten thousand dollars to join

265
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:41,820
the Thieves Guild. See you in two hours. So what are you at? What are you- what's your

266
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:47,260
attack at right now? Attack is at five. You- that's as much as I'm gonna get.

267
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:50,940
So you have to stop, Frogmask. You're not gonna get any more points from a basic

268
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:58,230
training double. We got fucking- we got- we got the Thieves Guild. So you stop,

269
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:04,119
switch places. Let him train. No, he's not- look at this. He's not gonna go anywhere.

270
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:13,579
He's hitting a rock right now. You're done. Switch. Because he is at attack two. So you're

271
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:18,650
gonna get a few more points. While you do that, work on your lockpicking. By the time they get

272
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:24,469
back- lockpicking eight, yeah, lockpicking's terrible. It's 22 lockpicking. All right,

273
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:31,210
they're good. They switch places. We are in pain. We need music.

274
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,300
Not to- not right now. Not right now. Is there- actually, there is music in the game,

275
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:53,429
but I turned off, didn't I? Yeah. Bring the music back from Kenshi. What an awful streamer.

276
00:42:54,659 --> 00:43:02,579
No, don't- just hold on. Everybody just chill, you know? The title of the stream says,

277
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:12,090
let's chill out. All right, let's- speaking of chill, what are you guys up to here? Okay,

278
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:25,739
I- I get 7900. There was an iron vein out here. What's going on here? There was an iron-

279
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:30,219
wait, I actually have- no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just wait one second here. Somebody- I have

280
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:45,260
like a huge, expensive piece of armor. Who has it? You do. 1500 to sell this, but this might be

281
00:43:45,260 --> 00:44:02,860
worth keeping to put on. This is also expensive. Sell value 2000. Look at this shit. I could do

282
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:18,760
it right now. It's too heavy though. Wait, 19. This one is only three. I might hold on to

283
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:30,820
this one, or this one. Sell it to a fence. Yeah, and I have- I have access to a permanent fence

284
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:37,619
later, so I guess I'm just gonna do it the old-fashioned way. Let's go get some with- hey,

285
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:42,389
welcome to the mining stream. I need to mine. Maybe I should take everybody to mine.

286
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:56,099
Let's see what we got here. Can you make the face cam smaller? Is it too big? Anything,

287
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:02,099
any veins or anything out here? Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. Who's that? Where are

288
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:30,980
they? Hungry bandit. Chase this motherfucker down. Oh, you're like a little ant. Don't let

289
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:52,219
him get away. How can you sprint that fast? You're so hungry, yet you're running this

290
00:45:52,219 --> 00:46:02,780
ridiculous marathon right now. Are we ever gonna catch this guy? He's like Sonic the fucking

291
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:17,860
hedgehog. Look at how far away we are. Are we- is he- he eventually has to stop and start

292
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:34,840
walking, right? Nobody can run forever. Am I like in a full sprint? Whoa, he's turning

293
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:39,590
he just ripped around the other direction. Okay, here we go. Speaking of training, it's time to

294
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:47,559
kick somebody's ass. Let's go. He's running right back into us. Here we go, here we go,

295
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:52,150
here we go, here we go, here we go, go, go, go, go. All right, this is what we trained for.

296
00:46:53,030 --> 00:47:18,889
To beat up feeble hungry bandits. Get back here. No, it's- let's go, get over here.

297
00:47:18,889 --> 00:47:32,860
First of all, attack. Dog is set to bodyguard. Yeah, dog is set to- dog to run.

298
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:54,679
Attack. They're both attacking. How are they gonna even make it there? Oh my god, why?

299
00:47:55,239 --> 00:48:14,280
Why is this guy so fast? And what is this? There's a copper vein right here. It's not worth

300
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:31,369
it at this point. This dude has 500 trillion stamina. Fuck it. Sorry, I mean I got- I'm

301
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:37,909
not gonna chase this guy across the whole world. This copper right here, forget it.

302
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:50,280
Recruit him? I can't even track him down to have a conversation.

303
00:48:50,280 --> 00:49:15,179
Unless he's not- is he like running back? No. That dude- he's just gone. See you later.

304
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:25,480
Thanks for playing. This is the closest we're ever gonna get to Jerma playing RuneScape.

305
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:34,059
I'm not gonna- I- I'm not gonna play RuneScape. Uh oh. How much are these worth? 167. I'm

306
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:37,179
not gonna have enough space because I didn't bring a backpack because I was trying to get

307
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:54,739
out there and swing at people. Shit. Why are you hungry? I'm not gonna- I did say I wasn't

308
00:49:54,739 --> 00:50:02,869
gonna play Minecraft but then I got shit faced and it- I played it. Don't waste time mining

309
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:08,300
without a backpack. Yeah, I know. That's probably a bad idea. And I can't even carry

310
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:20,630
anymore. I have to- I want to fight somebody. Where the hell even am I? I spent- I chased

311
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:25,670
that guy around. All right, here's the plan. You go back to the hub. Maybe I'll run into

312
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:31,769
something on the way there. These two, now that they're trained up and now I'm gonna take

313
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:37,449
them to go mine while we head back. Sell a piece of armor. I need a fence so I gotta take-

314
00:50:39,050 --> 00:51:08,969
Dead. You're dead. You're dead. Hungry bandit. Oh, you're dead. Let's go. Get him. Nice bite.

315
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:17,769
Beautiful. I mean, you missed but it's okay. Go- Okay, got him. What do you have on you?

316
00:51:19,019 --> 00:51:30,820
Nothing. Martial arts. I forgot- I forgot how fucked up this person was. It's like they're

317
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:45,340
just running into me. It's like they're just trying to let me- They heard me. Don't let

318
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:58,059
them get away. Oh my god, they're everywhere. No, they're too fast. This is just a line of them.

319
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:08,780
Just- Oh my god, hold on. This is too overwhelming. Kill. Just stay here and just

320
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:26,090
farm them. Get them. This is another- There's another one. Oh, he figured it out. You

321
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:38,219
deserve to live. You're a smart one. What am I fighting? This is nice. Destroyed. Excellent

322
00:52:38,219 --> 00:52:45,860
work. Pretty good practice I'm getting here. Did I level up anything at all? Combat. Melee

323
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:52,019
attack. Ooh, almost. What about the dog? Eleven. The dog is fucking strong now.

324
00:52:55,050 --> 00:53:05,219
Anybody have anything? Why would they? They're hungry bandits. That was pretty cool. That was

325
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:20,840
for free. The dog is finally useful. Feed dog. Dog fed. To all everybody that said,

326
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:27,960
why don't you just kill the dog? Throw the dog down a cliff. Why are you carrying the dog around?

327
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:38,599
It's just- Look at that. Eleven melee attack now. Strongest person in the party. Just is.

328
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:44,099
The dog is the strongest member of our party. Something's already wrong with you.

329
00:53:45,210 --> 00:54:06,440
All right, here we go. Just drip feed us, enemies. Okay, both of you. Hold on. Can I

330
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:22,570
heal? Enslave, enslave, enslave. How do I do that? Heal the- I don't have- I don't have anything.

331
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:38,809
Start. Why would I- what? No. You can't. Yeah, I can't. So what is- what is going to

332
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:49,159
continue our free, uh, our free attack? Bring it on. Level up. It's almost like the

333
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:57,510
game was listening to me. Because now these two are the fighters. No, don't- dog, don't let

334
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:15,369
him get away. He does- he's hurt and you can't even catch up to him? This guy has like a broken

335
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:36,469
leg and I can't even catch him with the dog. He's gonna fight me for a second.

336
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:53,940
Get over here. I'm closing it. I'm clo- ooh, I cut him off around the corner.

337
00:55:56,869 --> 00:56:26,280
Get it! Ah! Got it. Nice. Okay, good work, dog. Come back here. This is just the bandit

338
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:39,289
pass. I'm a monster. But am I though? I need to level up. Melee attack six. It leveled up.

339
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:42,170
Good. That's good, good, good, good, good. Ten plus four. Excellent.

340
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:53,690
None- they're not gonna have anything. But okay, it's time to sell. Who's dog? Get over here.

341
00:56:53,690 --> 00:57:07,000
Match each other's speed, if you will. All right, I was in the process of moving

342
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:17,909
somewhere. Where the hell was I going? Back to the hub. Bandits and dog food. Pretty slow,

343
00:57:17,909 --> 00:57:25,800
though. The dog. All right, I don't- I don't want to run into anything. So let's go- let's

344
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:33,769
check on- nothing over here, right? I'm not gonna get jumped. All right, let's go take a look at

345
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:51,510
the other two. See how they're doing. Still training. What are you at? Melee attack five,

346
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:58,420
melee attack five. So not gonna get any more use out of this. They both at five.

347
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:06,250
But why do you suck so much? Minus five? Is it because he has too much weight on him?

348
00:58:06,889 --> 00:58:21,019
26 out of 43. Is that why you just suck such ass right now? 45 out of 43.

349
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:32,760
This is too heavy. Let me see if that- is it the weapon? Why do I have this thing on?

350
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:40,489
What's the point of this? This thing's made of- my maze will be made out of rubber.

351
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:55,239
I'd like whip it around a fucking socket, people. So this is going away because what the

352
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:58,920
hell? I need a different weapon. That's not a minus five attack. Just sell this thing.

353
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:16,630
What a piece of shit. What about you? Minus two attack. Why do I have these even on? I need to

354
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:24,920
sell- this is gonna get put on. So I'm gonna give this to Sandler because this thing is

355
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:33,539
actually good. Blunt resistance, cut resistance. It's a standard grade. What's the weight on

356
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:42,170
this one? Three. This is also blunt. This is- these two- look at this resistance on this,

357
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:51,980
though. I almost want to put this all on- I'm at a loss. I'm not sure if I should just put this on

358
00:59:51,980 --> 01:00:16,650
everybody. Just have them build up their strength. So this minus five is coming from- it's coming

359
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:23,940
from the equipment penalty. So this should be five. And then this minus seven is coming from

360
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:30,980
equipment penalty as well. Equipment penalty. Damn, how bad is the stuff I'm wearing? Have

361
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:39,659
I just been wearing awful stuff the whole time? Why does my character suck so much?

362
01:00:39,659 --> 01:00:48,500
Combat skill bump. Minus five from the backpack. Somebody just has to be a mule.

363
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:55,659
Somebody has to be a mule. That's the only way it's possible. And it's gonna have to be

364
01:00:55,659 --> 01:01:08,949
Canroth. Canroth is the item mule. That's just what's gonna happen. So get everything over

365
01:01:08,949 --> 01:01:16,150
here. You just- just put all the items over in your backpack, your body. You're gonna be

366
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:22,090
worthless anyways having a huge backpack on. So let's see how that changes things.

367
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:29,980
So you are now still at minus seven from all that shit. You just have a terrible weapon on.

368
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:40,250
So I just replace your weapon or just take it off. Right? Why- why even have it on? Oh my

369
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:47,110
goodness. Nine plus eight. This is just weighing his arms down. This dude's arms are just

370
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:58,570
spaghetti. But they made- there's like razors on them. I'm getting an indoor bonus.

371
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:12,139
So you- you're the item mule. Speaking of item mules, I need to find a fence because

372
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:20,980
I'm gonna sell this armor. So let's have a fun job of finding a fence. Put on- hold on,

373
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:27,750
let me save it. Just in case it crashes or something. All right, oh we got- let's put on-

374
01:02:28,469 --> 01:02:42,739
let's put on something relaxing. Let's fall out too.

375
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:56,139
Okay. Made sure it was on the right volume. I don't want it to be loud. I just want to

376
01:02:56,139 --> 01:03:09,369
be in the background. Okay, let's go. I put Avril Lavigne on loop or riot. I think you

377
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:17,289
might be the only person that's gonna riot. If I were to guess. It's gonna be a one-man riot.

378
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:40,519
All right, let's go find a fence. What's that- why is that here? Go get that. No,

379
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:45,369
no, forget it. Just go to- go find a fence. I got all this shit to sell.

380
01:03:51,110 --> 01:04:02,260
Find, let's look at a bar. Oh, a forced one-guy riot. What's the percentage to sell this stuff?

381
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:09,289
27, 27. Fuck this sword, this thing sucks.

382
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:27,210
Uh, 27 percent. 27 percent. Avril Lavigne deserves it. And Avril Lavigne- don't- just- no.

383
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:39,480
That's fine, I can buy one of my anti-riot shield. You want me to play the one song that Avril

384
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:46,630
Lavigne does. You guys understand she- when Avril Lavigne does a concert, she loops two songs.

385
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:50,469
She gets on the stage and she does, hey you, I want to be your boyfriend,

386
01:04:51,110 --> 01:05:03,210
and then she does, um, I hope you have the time of your life, and then she just repeats them both

387
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:19,300
17 times. All right, uh, no fence in here. Let's check upstairs. I know I get a fence when I

388
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:23,300
join. I'm kind of at a weird spot right now because I need a fence to sell the stuff to be

389
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:28,820
able to get enough money to get a permanent fence, and- but I need 10,000. I don't have 10,000

390
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:40,250
yet. Where are you guys? Oh look, you made it. All right, sell this couple of copper that I have.

391
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:58,489
I need a fence. Grab your rocks everybody, don't you even think about it. Don't even think about

392
01:05:58,489 --> 01:06:15,909
picking up a rock right now. Throwing rocks. Everybody wants to throw rocks at me. It's not

393
01:06:15,909 --> 01:06:39,539
fair. All right, let's uh, talk. So I got some copper to sell you. 8300. That's all I have.

394
01:06:52,409 --> 01:07:05,260
What's going on with you? Escaped servant? What do I do about this guy? Can I help this person?

395
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:19,369
Who's this? Eat him? No, I'm not gonna eat this guy. If I first aid this guy, that's not gonna

396
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:28,940
do anything for me. Join the thieves? Yeah, I need 10,000, so I'm trying to figure out the

397
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:53,030
fastest way to make money. See what happens. Where's my first aid? Level up first aid, but then

398
01:07:53,030 --> 01:08:01,289
that's spending money. Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, why is it not leveling

399
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:23,800
up first aid anymore? Should I leave him now? Oh, it is, okay. All right, so what's this guy-

400
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:36,439
is this guy gonna be thankful? Give me money? Help me join my team? Splint his injuries?

401
01:08:47,899 --> 01:08:56,810
Uh, I don't- I don't know. His blood has to come back. Oh, how do I- can I give him blood?

402
01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:11,829
Wait, hold on, he's getting up. Stand up. Hold on, I got- I got plenty of first aid left.

403
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:26,260
Dog, feed, dog, feed, dog, feed, dog. I guess he's just gonna be there for a little while,

404
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:34,149
whatever. If I hit him on the leg, it'll- I'm not gonna hit him. I don't want to like,

405
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:46,329
kill the guy. Steal him. I can't. All right, uh, fence. That's what I was doing before.

406
01:09:47,289 --> 01:10:05,829
8300, I need another- get out there now. Who's available? This is free leveling up.

407
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:25,689
Right when the raid ends, come on. All right, fence. No, you know what? No, you just- you go

408
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:31,060
in mine. That's what you're gonna do. Just run with all your dumb shit and find a vein and

409
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:51,560
just sit there and smash on it. Is there any other veins anywhere? Max, the drifter. I can't

410
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:55,079
fight this guy, so I'm not even going to. I need a vein right there. There's a copper vein

411
01:10:55,079 --> 01:11:05,619
right here. Just sit here for eternity. Yeah, just sit there for eternity. What are you up to?

412
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:16,779
How you doing? You need- I can't really build much. Show research. Let's see. Book times two

413
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:27,289
to make a house. Small house. Crafting, defense, walls, field- fuel generator,

414
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:38,500
training, smithing, hats and headgear, industry, iron plates. No, you get- get your ass out there

415
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:42,819
and help with the mining. It's right here. This is how I'm gonna make the money. And then

416
01:11:42,819 --> 01:11:52,439
I get the access to the fence. Plenty of backpack space on both of you. It's right here.

417
01:11:56,199 --> 01:12:07,460
Yeah, let's go. We'll check back on you guys in a second. Why do I wear the same three

418
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:13,539
shirts? Because I only have three shirts. I have Nightwing, Aquaman, and Captain America.

419
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:25,739
And then a bunch of Star Wars t-shirts. What's going on out here? I have three dress shirts

420
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:36,380
and four v-necks. Two pairs of jeans, three pairs of slacks, and her sunglasses.

421
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:51,800
You don't need much. You really don't need much. No, I'm just gonna wait. I'm gonna

422
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:57,109
wait till I have an opportunity. Can I train anything or do anything? Maybe I can steal.

423
01:12:59,979 --> 01:13:09,859
Steal. You're still hungry? Here, eat like a fucking food cube. Actually, I can't. The dog

424
01:13:09,859 --> 01:13:15,260
can't even come inside. If I drop a food cube on the ground, is the dog gonna eat it?

425
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:35,029
I- did I just steal that? I don't get it. What? It's- it's- I don't understand why- if

426
01:13:35,029 --> 01:13:42,279
we're in the same party, why can't he eat the food cube? They have cactus rum. That's

427
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:49,079
pretty cool. All right, how are we doing on the mining? Yeah, it's another mine stream. I

428
01:13:49,079 --> 01:14:00,340
know. I know every Kenshi stream turns into a mine stream, but I need- I need the money.

429
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:17,130
You know what I mean? It's gone. Sell the armor? I can't- I- wait, hold on. Can't sell

430
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:24,409
the armor until I can unlock the fence so I can make sure- because I- I gotta run down

431
01:14:24,409 --> 01:14:28,409
and track down a fence. Over there, I gotta check every bar, every location, go to a

432
01:14:28,409 --> 01:14:32,649
different town. They're hard to track down. Sometimes it's just not in the places you

433
01:14:32,649 --> 01:14:37,449
think they're. So, there's a 27% chance that I can sell this to an actual vendor, so I'm

434
01:14:37,449 --> 01:14:41,850
not gonna do that. I'm just gonna save scum for like 30 minutes? No. Just do this, get the money

435
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:47,210
from the vein, then after this we can get out of here. Sell that stuff, join the thieves'

436
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:54,300
guild, and then- wreck! You know what I mean? I'm actually in the way of the notifications,

437
01:14:54,300 --> 01:15:00,760
aren't I? You can sell all the- you can sell the items at the hub's bar. They buy stolen

438
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:10,630
items. Yeah, but also remember, I- I have the items over here, so I have to run these

439
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:16,899
items all the way down here. There's a vein right outside this town. I mean, let me just-

440
01:15:16,899 --> 01:15:22,489
hold on. I have to bring them down here anyways, so just- I'm gonna sit here for a second.

441
01:15:22,489 --> 01:15:29,159
I'm gonna have these two do something else. I gotta run to the hub anyways? Yeah, well,

442
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:33,880
let- hold on. Let me at least run to the hub with some copper, because I'm standing right

443
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:41,289
in front of a vein. That's 80% quality. The thieves' guild actually gives you plus 50%

444
01:15:41,289 --> 01:15:44,810
profits, by the way. Oh, that's awesome to hear. That's amazing. I can't wait to do it.

445
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:54,619
Let's times three that, and what can you guys do in the meantime over here?

446
01:15:54,619 --> 01:16:00,390
I just want like two stacks of copper, and that's it. There's copper outside the hub.

447
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:28,180
That's iron. Iron. It's iron. There's copper right here. Okay. All right, all right,

448
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:35,109
hold on, hold on, hold on. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I almost just said something,

449
01:16:35,109 --> 01:16:40,859
so glad I didn't. All right, let's go. Take it over there. Go to the town. Go to the hub.

450
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:49,210
I need this- we just wait for this last bar to fill, and then we're gonna go from here.

451
01:16:49,210 --> 01:17:03,850
Three, two, one, go. Okay. You guys are done. Run to the hub, but hopefully there's nobody

452
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:11,260
in the way. I gotta get that before it gets dark. In the meantime, why don't you-

453
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,649
you go out there and just start mining it, because there's two people that can be on it.

454
01:17:16,649 --> 01:17:22,630
Might as well just improve your mining skill while I have you here, Chatham. Where was it back

455
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:28,060
here? Where was it? It was just kind of up in the corner, wasn't it? Somewhere. Oh,

456
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:36,789
oh, Jeremy, did you lose your place? What the hell is it right there? That's iron.

457
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:50,810
Is it right here? There it is. You go mine this now, times 25,000 speed. Bring the dog

458
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:55,989
to for a company just in case something bad happens. Let me check and make sure you guys

459
01:17:56,069 --> 01:18:02,310
make it not with any impeding factors here, and you guys are far away from each other,

460
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:08,899
so I have to- what's going on here? You both on sprint, but yeah, you gotta match the speed

461
01:18:08,899 --> 01:18:20,579
together here. Oh, shit. Are those bad? Yeah, stay the fuck away from those. 15 attack,

462
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:31,130
14 strength, no thanks. All right, match speed. Looks good. I'm gonna get attacked. I know it.

463
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:37,670
I'm staying with these two because I'm terrified of somebody just popping out of nowhere.

464
01:18:39,029 --> 01:18:55,140
Small iron, not worth stopping. Save this shit. All right, what's- why are we counting?

465
01:18:55,779 --> 01:19:03,979
What's happening? Why are you counting? Streamer gnomes somebody? When did I-

466
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:16,630
oh, he's gonna sing a dumb song. Okay, speed it up. She's mining down at the copper.

467
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:22,869
I left Frogmust going to town with the- I know, I left Kandroth going to town with the goods.

468
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:32,840
He's got them all anyways. What's going on? What- did I miss something here? What did I miss?

469
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:49,029
I must have missed something. You know what my favorite part about this stream is?

470
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:58,069
Uh, the fact that- wait, yeah, okay. Does anyone remember what I did like two hours ago?

471
01:19:58,069 --> 01:20:09,579
You guys remember that, right? I almost forgot that I did that shit. All right, time to sell.

472
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:25,899
Sell at the bar, which is down here. I wish I could forget. I will never forget.

473
01:20:26,779 --> 01:20:36,380
Who are you? Nobody of interest. Sell. It's time to join the guild. We got everybody here

474
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:54,649
too, so that's good. 9600. Stolen goods, no problem. 1500. 2000. But I wonder if some

475
01:20:54,649 --> 01:21:11,960
of these are worth keeping. Which one of these should I actually keep? This thing's-

476
01:21:12,439 --> 01:21:39,819
Ugh. Somebody could just wear this and be protected. All right, get this out of here.

477
01:21:40,779 --> 01:21:49,770
Because that's- that's faction, right? I don't want anyone to know who I- where I am and who I am.

478
01:21:52,260 --> 01:22:07,050
Faction uniform. Okay, get this out of here. Now here come the letters. I got 10,000, but

479
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:16,119
let's see. This is one- this way is- this is such a good piece of armor. Put this one on.

480
01:22:16,119 --> 01:22:30,939
This thing is one kilogram and it's got great resistance. I'm putting this one on. Am I gonna

481
01:22:30,939 --> 01:22:42,710
have to go nuclear on this chat? Am I- am I gonna have to go nuclear here?

482
01:22:56,090 --> 01:23:09,270
Buttons on the desk. I could press it right now. I can go- that'll make me do it. Do it,

483
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:26,069
you coward. So this is a chest piece, right? I think we're good. I want- I want to wear this

484
01:23:26,069 --> 01:23:48,649
stuff because it's very, very good. Do something funny. The holy chest is really bad. Well then,

485
01:23:48,649 --> 01:24:32,119
fine. It's gonna go right now. You ready? Time to buy. Let's go. Actually, everyone

486
01:24:32,119 --> 01:24:35,399
meet up together so we can do this at the same time because there's training dummies in there

487
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:45,850
and shit. German is as bad as chat making random exclamations. Just trying to keep order. All

488
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:53,430
right, where is it? Tower. So everybody- everybody meet up over here. No, you stay- you're- hold on

489
01:24:53,430 --> 01:25:05,850
a second. Stay there for a second. Dog can go. Let's get that last piece of copper. Good.

490
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:17,380
Get to the tower. Let's join the guild. The first time our crew has been together in probably

491
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:28,789
10 days. No, like three days. Dog is getting hurt. Dog's fine. Where? Dog's all right.

492
01:25:28,789 --> 01:25:41,850
Dog's not getting hurt. Dog's just hungry. Why did you leave him? Leave who? Everybody's fine.

493
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:53,029
What are you guys on about? I want to make sure we're all here. Where are you going? Oh,

494
01:25:53,029 --> 01:26:04,380
it's because you're on bodyguard, right? Okay. Okay, so kind of an odd route but I'll take it.

495
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:14,739
Okay. We made it. Here we go. All four of us are here. The four useless dickheads.

496
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:20,359
I would like to join the guild. Thief boss. I want to join the thieves.

497
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:47,960
You can join for a fee. 10,000 cats. Can I negotiate? What if I said no? I want to join

498
01:26:49,479 --> 01:26:55,819
and 10,000 is a little steep. You're not a very good thief if you can't afford it.

499
01:26:57,050 --> 01:27:03,899
Done. Welcome brother to the shinobi thieves. Shinobi thieves are now your allies.

500
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:17,859
That was a lot of money. Wow. Okay, now what do I get? Follow. We can go in. All of us.

501
01:27:17,859 --> 01:27:30,630
Everybody get in. Look it. Who are you? Where are my allies? Guild plastic surgeon. No,

502
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:39,449
I don't want my face changed. So what do I get for $10,000? A trader. Let's take a look.

503
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:54,649
What? I have something to trade. Um, hello. Excuse me. Uh, take a look.

504
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:01,659
Ooh. Stolen goods. No problem. So let me take a look here because this is important.

505
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:08,819
Minus 50%. Why mine? I thought I thought you guys said I got a plus 50%.

506
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:30,170
Minus 50? These are actually pretty good. No one said plus. People just said 50.

507
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:48,140
50 plus taxes. Oh, but there's a discount on everything. All right. Let's I got a

508
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:53,420
little bit of money. Let's buy some good armor here. Getting rid of this shit, right? I guess

509
01:28:53,420 --> 01:29:04,100
this is all right. This is 16%. 32%. And it's three. It's a chest. This is where does this go

510
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:09,270
here? Yeah. Okay. I'm going to get rid of this dumb thing because why the hell do I even

511
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:18,149
have this on? Let's get rid of all this shit except for this. So I'm going to wear this stuff.

512
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:25,640
Somebody else is going to wear this one. This is a shirt. Only the strongest deserves this.

513
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:35,750
So what do I want to get for you? 16%, 26%, 800. No, it's 30, 200. No, fuck that too much.

514
01:29:35,750 --> 01:30:01,340
11, 17, 5 kilograms. That's not bad. That's affordable in a way. 16, 24, 4 kilograms. I think

515
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:15,380
I'm gonna buy this. You're doing a great job idling. Stealth effect. Assassin and melee

516
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:23,529
attack bonus. Look at that shit. Look at that. Oh, man. 3,200. Look at that attack bonus.

517
01:30:24,329 --> 01:30:41,159
Give it to me. All right. I need to figure out who's going to wear this shit. You are the

518
01:30:41,159 --> 01:30:50,810
strongest. So I think you should wear this all. Let's see. So this is the armor you got right

519
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:59,449
now. Melee defense plus five. Melee defense plus four. But this is way better in regards to

520
01:30:59,449 --> 01:31:09,239
resistance. Let's see. Let's just see what happens. Boom. 14 plus eight. Total weight.

521
01:31:09,239 --> 01:31:24,090
Oh, you're gonna have to walk around like an idiot though, because it's too heavy.

522
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:40,420
She has to walk around with this heavy stuff on for a little bit. Acid 40%. How much is this

523
01:31:40,420 --> 01:32:03,399
way? You can take that off for now. Melee defense bonus. You're the mule, so this is

524
01:32:03,399 --> 01:32:19,100
gonna go to frog. Okay, look. What's going on here? Oh, it's gonna go outside. I get it,

525
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:31,109
okay. I need to be closer. All right. So you're gonna put this on, because total weight. Okay.

526
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:51,899
12 and a 25. Just go. This is the game. This is what you do. There's nowhere to,

527
01:32:51,899 --> 01:33:00,390
there's nowhere to go. This is where we are. This is game. This is where we are.

528
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:14,869
So everyone's got good stuff on, except the dog can't really be, can't have anything.

529
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:19,460
Need to walk around to make it so that build strength with the heavy shit on.

530
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:29,739
You just suck because you're carrying all the items. Nine plus eight. 14 plus eight.

531
01:33:30,539 --> 01:33:33,750
Let's take a look upstairs. There's a training dummy up there.

532
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:41,260
I can't, I don't want to steal from the place that I just got accepted to. That would

533
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:52,729
be a really bad idea, wouldn't it? Let's explore the tower though. Shit, what is this?

534
01:33:55,579 --> 01:34:01,500
Can I use these? Locksmith training box? Locksmith training box two. Oh no.

535
01:34:02,539 --> 01:34:11,000
Training dummy, training dummy, assassination dummy two. MK one, training dummy two.

536
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:32,859
Fuck. Here we go again. This is so much in here. It's in the top floor. Beds. I can sleep.

537
01:34:33,979 --> 01:34:45,340
Finally. All right. Everybody up here. What are you, what's wrong with you? Get up there.

538
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:53,189
It's time to train. Only one person at a time. Only one person at a time. So the person that

539
01:34:53,189 --> 01:35:03,029
needs to be there the most. Get there. Do you even have a weapon? What is this? Is this doing

540
01:35:03,909 --> 01:35:11,369
stealth? No. Melee attack. Defense, dodge, martial arts. What is it leveling up here?

541
01:35:12,010 --> 01:35:25,859
Is it just attack or is it assassination? Okay, it's assassination. All right. Nice.

542
01:35:26,659 --> 01:35:30,020
Stealthy knockouts. Chance to successfully kidnap somebody. Chance to break free when

543
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:37,579
being carried away. Resist knockout. So are there any other training dummies I can use that will

544
01:35:37,579 --> 01:35:51,500
level up the just general skill or no? Well let's do the harder lockpicking then. Or maybe I can't

545
01:35:51,500 --> 01:36:09,989
do that yet. Am I too high already? I might be too high. Let's see. Because my lockpicking's

546
01:36:09,989 --> 01:36:19,590
at 22. I think I'm too high. You can do the better dummies with tech two plus research.

547
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:34,949
What is this? How about you on this one? No. Okay. He's not too high. All right. Click on it and in

548
01:36:34,949 --> 01:36:52,300
the bottom left is max training. I see. 20. Right. 10. 5. 19. 19 assassination. All right.

549
01:36:55,340 --> 01:37:04,810
Looks like we're all going to be assassins. I need you to go do something because you're

550
01:37:04,810 --> 01:37:08,970
kind of just standing around. We need food. Are we out of food? No. We got a little bit

551
01:37:08,970 --> 01:37:13,770
of food. Who's hungry? The dog's hungry. Everybody's hungry. Everybody wants food.

552
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:23,659
This has got to go into his backpack. Back into the backpack. Put the food cubes in there.

553
01:37:26,199 --> 01:37:33,029
Who's eating? Everybody except I need the dog to eat. So go down and feed the dog please

554
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:40,520
while you two keep training. Dog? What? My dog's not allowed in there? That's kind of

555
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:53,449
bullshit if you ask me. Dog is just eating. Good. So we got strength will go up when the food is

556
01:37:53,449 --> 01:38:02,039
better when he's eating. 9 plus 8. 14 plus 8. I'm kind of getting to be all right. I'm getting

557
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:12,659
to be worth walking around. So speaking of walking around, how much money do I have?

558
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:24,229
592. How much food do I have on these two? A couple of food cubes. I still have this.

559
01:38:24,229 --> 01:38:32,229
Let's just put it on. 6 plus 4. At least I have some defense now while they train up there.

560
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:41,899
Who else? I mean what else can I even do? Let me just check the other spots. I need to know.

561
01:38:42,779 --> 01:38:50,789
I just paid 10 grand. Let's go all the way up. We're at least in the next room.

562
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:59,289
What's up here? Steal from the assassin league. That's a- I'm not doing that.

563
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:10,380
This is all the way up. I can sleep. Maybe the dog should sleep. Sounds like a plan.

564
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:20,789
The dog can't sleep in that bed. The dog can't come in here. Well never mind on that. Front.

565
01:39:20,789 --> 01:39:29,880
Let's just go out. I need more money. So you two. What are you at right now for lockpicking?

566
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:38,340
What's your skill? Lockpicking 11. So I can do this 10 more times. What are you at

567
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:46,100
for assassination? Six. You're gonna be here for a while. Good luck. We're both gonna be

568
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:58,579
here for a little while. In the meantime. What am I gonna do in the meantime? They're

569
01:39:58,579 --> 01:40:17,960
gonna have to trade off. I need money. I need food. Make canned broth. Oh never mind.

570
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:24,329
I'm not gonna read that one. The two of you just go. They'll be fine. They're not like hungry

571
01:40:24,329 --> 01:40:38,949
yet. Probably should. Is it like a general- is it really that- that's kind of fucked up. Okay.

572
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:46,329
Twitchy Barthug. I don't like that look in your eyes. Scum sucker you smirking at me.

573
01:40:46,409 --> 01:40:49,289
You got tasty looking eyeballs.

574
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:58,229
Uh crack your knuckles. I just wanted to buy a drink. I was uh just admiring your sword. That's

575
01:40:58,229 --> 01:41:07,220
all. Uh what's the- what do you got for like attack? I don't want to start a fight here.

576
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:12,869
What does this guy have for attack? I'm gonna get my ass kicked. Maybe I should.

577
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:24,739
You got tasty looking eyeballs. 14 plus two. Six plus four. Stay the hell away from me.

578
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:44,020
The dog's got attack. We could have probably done it. So I need to check over here.

579
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:56,920
Skip. Oh this guy got up. He actually got up. Wait wait wait. Wait a minute. Hold on. Get over

580
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:00,520
there. Get this guy. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go.

581
01:42:01,399 --> 01:42:13,859
Get over to that guy right now. All right. What's the plan here?

582
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:30,920
Unlock shackles. I'm gonna unlock his shackles. Let's save it. And then maybe will he join me?

583
01:42:33,109 --> 01:42:36,630
I could probably get another party member here. Let's wait till he gets out of sight.

584
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:50,489
Once we get out of the- is he trying to escape right now? I'm not sure. Are there any guards?

585
01:42:56,949 --> 01:43:11,770
This is a- this is an escape. 90% chance. Well stop moving man. What are you doing?

586
01:43:14,470 --> 01:44:26,359
Got it. Kill. I can't like talk to him? I can't- can I not? I undid his shackles and he's

587
01:44:26,359 --> 01:44:33,829
going back in here. For what reason are you doing this? It's because I have a negative attack value.

588
01:44:33,829 --> 01:44:41,449
Yeah but I- yeah. This guy's good. I can't have this guy in a party or something.

589
01:44:43,369 --> 01:44:52,439
Well whatever. Good luck. Take care of yourself. Have a good- have a nice life.

590
01:44:53,079 --> 01:44:59,800
There's a chance that they'll join you. They aren't assured to. I guess that makes sense.

591
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:11,180
All right how are we doing up here? Block picking 12 and you are at assassination 9.

592
01:45:11,819 --> 01:45:19,210
What the hell are you two gonna do in the meantime? Can the dog train? I know it doesn't

593
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:29,500
even matter. Dog can't even train on it because dog can't go in there. All right it's- it's

594
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:34,859
almost time to go and try to fight. To go on an expedition where the purpose is to get in

595
01:45:34,859 --> 01:45:40,630
a fight. That's- I just need a little bit of- who's malnourished? I need to get a couple

596
01:45:40,630 --> 01:45:45,289
more pieces of food and then we're going outside and I'm gonna just start a fight and just try to

597
01:45:45,289 --> 01:45:56,489
level up. So let's get some food. Does the- is there a trader in here that serves food?

598
01:45:57,210 --> 01:46:13,350
Or is it- does he just do- does he just do clothes? No you just have clothing. Oh well.

599
01:46:13,989 --> 01:46:23,369
Gotta go to the bar for the food. But that's too much money. And then we're gonna go on

600
01:46:23,369 --> 01:46:28,579
an expedition and we're gonna fight. Even if I lose? Good. How much health do I have? Plenty.

601
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:45,979
Come on down. I have to put on the fight music. Good to see ya. I hate how I have to walk around

602
01:46:45,979 --> 01:46:52,140
in a circle. All right we got dried meat. Take it. Fish. Ah that's- I don't have enough money

603
01:46:52,140 --> 01:47:25,819
for this. I only- I don't- I only have one food cube. I can afford one of these. That's

604
01:47:25,819 --> 01:47:35,590
all I can get. No new- the green fruit doesn't do anything. Steel. I mean that's easier said

605
01:47:35,590 --> 01:48:00,680
than done. This grog that I could take. There's too many people in here. Go upstairs. Anything

606
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:07,699
up here? No. I mean they're not looking this way. Save it right here just because I might be able

607
01:48:07,699 --> 01:48:12,760
to pull something out of here. What- what's in here? First aid. 51% chance to steal it.

608
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:20,579
That's bad. All right here we go. Here's food. Stealing chance 53%. It's saved right here,

609
01:48:20,579 --> 01:48:35,689
right? Let's try it. Random furniture. Okay hold on. Okay I got it. What is random furniture?

610
01:48:41,319 --> 01:48:47,060
Displaced in interior wall support beam. Tech level 2. Needs research bench level 2.

611
01:48:49,210 --> 01:48:57,640
I got it. Whatever the hell it is. Well I got one piece of food.

612
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:11,479
It's not going to do very much for me though. We might have to actually go to one of the

613
01:49:11,479 --> 01:49:16,020
other smaller towns and just try to steal all this stuff. Yeah I got enough food to last

614
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:27,079
at least one small expedition to the next town. That's a lot of resident sleepers.

615
01:49:46,020 --> 01:50:00,060
I missed a free recruit in this bar. And why am I still sneaking? Stand up.

616
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:12,970
Free recruit. This guy's not free. 6,000 cats. Please get him. Yes he is free. Who?

617
01:50:13,850 --> 01:50:23,640
Free? Oh I just got baited. All right that's funny funny funny funny funny.

618
01:50:29,579 --> 01:50:35,380
All right let's go. We're at a level where I can at least do something. So we've got

619
01:50:38,329 --> 01:50:56,300
14 plus 8. 11. Negative 8 and 1. Find hobs. Hobs. Find hobs. I don't see a hobs. I see hungry.

620
01:50:56,300 --> 01:51:10,300
This is a holy citizen. Hobs.

621
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:27,380
Yes that's it. Have a drink on me. Say have you ever heard of the story of the wailing phantom?

622
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:33,140
No. What's it about? Well legend has it it dwells in a sunken cave south of the outlands.

623
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:38,819
Are here it has bones made of solid diamond. Just one tooth would fetch you kabillions,

624
01:51:38,819 --> 01:51:44,979
no poobillions of cats. It has the gigantic tongue of a lusty tree hag and a marvelous

625
01:51:44,979 --> 01:51:50,899
pair of bingo wings that droop like smooth potato butter. Some even say that it has the snout of

626
01:51:50,899 --> 01:51:55,859
fondled truffle. Even the most handsomest of man warriors haven't been able to hunt the peppery

627
01:51:55,859 --> 01:52:01,739
thing down. What is this? Wow this is a strange way to talk. That sounds amazing. How do I find

628
01:52:01,739 --> 01:52:07,750
it? If I knew that I would have tracked it down myself but if you're going to head out

629
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:15,479
in search of it you must take me with you. Call it an old man's dying wish. Then I will

630
01:52:15,479 --> 01:52:29,640
grant you your wish. Join us in search of the beast. New party member except this one's just

631
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:44,039
a this is a regular this is a regular guy. What do you have for items? 7 plus 4 go to plastic

632
01:52:44,039 --> 01:52:53,020
surgery. Take him to the thieves guild for plastic surgery. Oh yeah all right that sounds

633
01:52:53,020 --> 01:53:02,619
fun. New party member good. Now you know now somebody can die right? I won't feel that bad.

634
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:24,420
Where's the plastic surgeon? What the hell are you? All right Hobbs.

635
01:53:26,699 --> 01:53:30,460
There's the traitor. The plastic surgeon was sitting here before.

636
01:53:34,409 --> 01:53:44,760
Plastic surgeon where are you? There you are. Need your face changed. Yes tell me. Here we go.

637
01:53:44,760 --> 01:54:22,069
Okay name. I gotta change the name too. So much for normal. Why does everybody have to

638
01:54:22,069 --> 01:54:38,420
have this? That hurts. That just hurt my back doing that. All right we got it. Let's do

639
01:54:39,880 --> 01:55:41,220
small chest. Oh what happened over here? What's this? How's that chest? Slender man.

640
01:56:10,579 --> 01:56:35,159
It's just just a kingdom hearts character now. No that's fine. I think that's all right.

641
01:56:46,869 --> 01:56:54,500
They all have this. Can one of my characters not have this? They all have the horizontal

642
01:56:54,500 --> 01:57:38,899
neck. Every one of them. Every single one of them. Oh my god what the hell am I doing?

643
01:57:39,619 --> 01:58:19,189
Not bad. It's another doctor house. It's doctor house again. Every character I make is doctor

644
01:58:19,189 --> 01:58:43,979
house and then I make it somebody else afterwards. It looks good. All right I like that.

645
01:58:43,979 --> 01:59:25,140
Looks all right. This is one of Roger's characters from American death. That's bad.

646
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:47,020
No no mohawk. Oh that's bad too. It kind of has to be Roger. In fact I think I have to go back

647
01:59:47,020 --> 02:00:31,859
and make just make him Roger. Please don't go for the low-hanging fruit. No no

648
02:00:31,859 --> 02:00:59,189
youtuber hair. Just regular. That's fine. I'm gonna do beard. No. Why why does it look like

649
02:00:59,189 --> 02:01:13,140
you? It shouldn't. All right that does not look like me. Give me a break. You think this

650
02:01:13,140 --> 02:02:04,149
looks like me? It fucking kind of does a little bit. I like the no beard though. No mustache,

651
02:02:04,149 --> 02:02:39,449
no beard, none of them. All right looks fine. We're done. Name. Decrease the height.

652
02:02:57,079 --> 02:03:02,180
This is like a that's like a Roger name. That's me part of his gold standard. Right.

653
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:14,859
That would that would be oh you can't even see the name. That's a Roger persona name right.

654
02:03:14,859 --> 02:03:32,409
Take off the hat. I will. Give him the Roger proportions. I can't just do make Roger.

655
02:03:33,289 --> 02:04:00,520
Let's just see what it looks like. Perfect music.

656
02:04:14,010 --> 02:04:33,659
Taller. There. There you go. Barnabas gold standard. One of Roger from American Dance personas.

657
02:05:37,350 --> 02:06:03,960
Look at this down here. 15 plus 12. Where did that come from? I have 85 cents. What do you have

658
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:12,119
for attack? Seven. All right. Field medic six five minus two lockpicking. Terrible. Melee

659
02:06:12,119 --> 02:06:17,239
attack seven. Defense six. Uh you're gonna. Excuse me. Barnabas you need to go over here.

660
02:06:18,439 --> 02:06:22,920
Keep him unarmed. You better believe it. Why is this training going down?

661
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:52,439
I had to give negative to go positive. Okay. I guess so. Where are you at? Looking good.

662
02:06:53,159 --> 02:07:00,170
12 assassination. If you are in stealth mode you can sneak behind people and knock them

663
02:07:00,170 --> 02:07:08,039
out. This skill determines how long they stay unconscious for. Good. I hate all these

664
02:07:08,039 --> 02:07:20,310
motherfuckers. The dog's probably the only one that I actually like. They're all so fucking bad.

665
02:07:26,869 --> 02:07:36,659
Madame Chatham is actually not bad either. All right we have our designated mule. If you

666
02:07:36,659 --> 02:07:41,619
kidnap somebody you can practice assassination on them forever. Yeah but that's mean.

667
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:50,939
This is free. All right here we go. I think it's time to get going. We got a team here

668
02:07:51,020 --> 02:07:56,300
and what was the super secret treasure area? What what that guy was talking about something right?

669
02:07:57,260 --> 02:08:06,359
What was where was that? Didn't he say that there was some magical Brazilian treasure?

670
02:08:09,460 --> 02:08:14,409
Somewhere in the middle? Like here? I gotta turn the camera off for a second.

671
02:08:15,210 --> 02:08:23,479

729
02:23:44,870 --> 02:23:48,649
Oh my god. That guy's got a hundred dollars. Hold on a second. We just

730
02:23:48,649 --> 02:24:03,000
gave a hundred fucking dollars. Uh Kvas gave a hundred bucks. Oh my lord. Thank you Kvas for

731
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:07,639
the hundred dollars. Oh my god I fucking bought these kind of on accident because twitch said

732
02:24:07,639 --> 02:24:13,770
the purchase failed. But oh well. Uh love you Jerma you're still my favorite. My dog passed

733
02:24:13,770 --> 02:24:22,120
away today but as long as I got you I'm good. Uh Nickelodeon. Way I got that slime. Slat.

734
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:32,870
I'm Nickelodeon. Uh I'm sorry that's terrible to hear. Sorry about your dog. That sucks. It's

735
02:24:32,870 --> 02:24:36,950
always hard and there's no real easy way to deal with it. You just kind of have to. So

736
02:24:37,670 --> 02:24:46,059
I'm terribly fucking sorry to hear that. But thank you for the accidental hundred dollars.

737
02:24:47,420 --> 02:24:54,379
That's a that's a big that's a big money accident. Thank you so much for real. Thank

738
02:24:54,379 --> 02:25:01,420
you. Can I get some Nickelodeon splats? Uh what's the what's the Nickelodeon reference?

739
02:25:02,139 --> 02:25:08,899
I need to I need to be very cautious with this because I have

740
02:25:10,659 --> 02:25:22,250
med kits. I got two bodies two bodies in the ground. Two able bodies to carry them. That's

741
02:25:22,250 --> 02:25:26,250
the first time I've ever had like a successful battle and it feels great. It feels actually

742
02:25:26,250 --> 02:25:39,770
fucking great. All right let's get uh Nickelodeon. That just sounded like Nickelodeon.

743
02:25:41,049 --> 02:25:54,250
This is a we're in Fallout 4. This is a Fallout 4 soundtrack. Uh let's just uh whoops.

744
02:25:58,469 --> 02:26:01,989
I kind of don't want this to get claimed though. This did that if I keep playing these these

745
02:26:01,989 --> 02:26:17,299
are claimable songs I think. Are they? I'm not even sure anymore. Loot the enemies? Oh no

746
02:26:17,299 --> 02:26:26,059
I'm going to don't worry. New Vegas. I'll put on the New Vegas soundtrack in the background

747
02:26:26,059 --> 02:26:34,420
here. You can just hang out there. All right wait hold on. Okay everyone's fine.

748
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:43,979
So let's I need to assess the situation here. Unconscious. Bleeding. Almost dead. Um

749
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:58,280
conscious but need of attention. Unconscious. Almost dead. Wounded. Arms almost gone.

750
02:27:00,379 --> 02:27:04,860
Wounded but you're okay. So we gotta we gotta deal with the the critical injuries here first.

751
02:27:05,819 --> 02:27:19,860
So who has decent first aid among you? Field medic six, five, ten. How does a dog have uh field

752
02:27:19,860 --> 02:27:28,180
medic four? How does a dog have ten field medic? Turn the music down a little bit.

753
02:27:31,379 --> 02:27:40,040
That's better. So how's the dog a field medic? That's kind of strange.

754
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:53,420
Dr. Dog is on the case. Uh I don't the dog can't have. Let me just see. I keep panicking here.

755
02:27:54,139 --> 02:27:59,239
Now the dog cannot heal anybody. So frog musk needs to be healed so it means

756
02:27:59,239 --> 02:28:03,239
we're gonna take Barnabus as the highest of the two that can carry anything.

757
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:18,059
Yeah so Barnabus needs those med packs. So go get them. You two stop running that way.

758
02:28:19,020 --> 02:28:49,350
Stay. Oh my god where are you going? We gotta run. Get off. This guy's shooting a crossbow.

759
02:28:50,229 --> 02:29:19,500
He is. I'm gonna have to pick people up. This guy's still alive too. Okay here's the plan.

760
02:29:20,219 --> 02:29:34,790
You got nothing on you of value. Holy shit that thing's actually kind of good.

761
02:29:35,350 --> 02:29:52,600
Just go into melee. I saved it right but they're all so hurt. I'm I if I get hit

762
02:29:52,600 --> 02:30:14,139
once with an arrow I'm fucking dead. I saved it though. I had it saved. Let's go. One

763
02:30:14,139 --> 02:30:28,020
down. Oh my god there's so many. There are so many. There's like three more in the trees.

764
02:30:28,020 --> 02:31:03,079
I gotta have faith. Oh my goodness. 18 precision crossbow. Junk bow. What is this?

765
02:31:06,629 --> 02:31:16,389
Armored rag. Standard grade. Wow that's kind of good. 24 39. It's heavy but take it.

766
02:31:16,389 --> 02:31:33,909
What about the boots? Too heavy. Give me the bolts too. All right I gotta get out of here.

767
02:31:34,469 --> 02:31:41,750
They're ranged. I think I can outrun them. Where is the boss? Dust bandit. Where's the dust

768
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:48,579
boss? Because dust boss. I got a feeling this guy might have something on him.

769
02:31:48,579 --> 02:32:08,170
So we're going to run. We're gonna go to the dust boss. Pick up the two and book it.

770
02:32:08,170 --> 02:32:26,739
Oh shit his leg is broken. Another one of these. Oh that's good too. Don't I can't get

771
02:32:26,739 --> 02:32:33,850
overburdened on this. Who is this? Who has this? This is Chatham. He's overburdened.

772
02:32:34,899 --> 02:33:12,219
Fuck. Let's get out of here. I can't risk it. I just gotta. Okay how are you doing?

773
02:33:13,979 --> 02:33:22,920
Pick up. Frog musk is your task. Your task is pick up can bro. Pick up.

774
02:33:25,420 --> 02:34:15,350
Go. I can't carry anyone with this arm. Oh shit. How many are following me? Three. It's

775
02:34:15,350 --> 02:35:03,860
very possible that I can't kill them. Look at my guys. I can't even hold a sword.

776
02:35:03,860 --> 02:35:14,389
These guys are not. Look at the attack. 16. Crossbow is 18. I'm fucked. 15. Attack 13.

777
02:35:15,110 --> 02:35:21,510
How are they doing right now? Unconscious. He's gonna get up.

778
02:35:22,149 --> 02:35:25,850
All right we're just gonna have to we're just gonna have to try to get out of here.

779
02:35:27,319 --> 02:35:42,649
Just try to get out. I need a town. Holy military base.

780
02:35:42,649 --> 02:36:04,379
Holy shit he's alive. Okay hold on. Frog musk is currently alive.

781
02:36:05,020 --> 02:36:21,139
Is there a button I have to press to have him play dead? Or this just is him sneaking play dead?

782
02:36:21,860 --> 02:36:36,309
He does it automatically. Okay just don't move him. This is so stressful. I just I I took

783
02:36:36,309 --> 02:36:44,100
so much beating and I leveled up probably like three times. Why does this keep getting

784
02:36:44,100 --> 02:37:07,139
unchecked? Oh he just took a fucking shot right in the head. Sacrifices to get away.

785
02:37:07,620 --> 02:37:37,479
Frog musk. No get frog musk. Can you run? He's I think he can run. Go go go go go go go go go.

786
02:37:37,479 --> 02:37:56,020
All right we need a location. Holy military base or try to run back to the hub. I don't

787
02:37:56,020 --> 02:38:03,020
know what to do. I don't know what I don't know what the safe option here is. Everybody

788
02:38:03,020 --> 02:38:30,379
just try to get back to the hub. Good luck go. Oh Barnabas. Miss miss. Yes I think we

789
02:38:30,379 --> 02:38:44,329
did it. I think we did it. I think we did it. They're not chasing. Get out of there. Okay

02:38:45,850 --> 02:38:55,030
meet up over here. They're not chasing. Holy shit. Okay we need to have like a heal party.

791
02:38:55,030 --> 02:39:00,790
They're not chasing. Are they? I mean is this guy? They're coming this way. We gotta keep

792
02:39:00,790 --> 02:39:07,979
moving. Yeah they're coming this way. We gotta go. We gotta get out of here. Now

793
02:39:09,100 --> 02:39:17,670

794
02:39:19,639 --> 02:39:23,479
Those are slavers. Those are slavers and we got out right at the perfect time.

795
02:39:24,440 --> 02:40:06,950
Damn they're coming down this way. Meet in the middle. I gotta splint that leg. Fuck oh we

797
02:40:18,010 --> 02:40:40,420
hide over here? No no no we were so close. We were so close to getting out of there.

798
02:40:40,420 --> 02:41:38,229
Come on. Put him down. He has all the health packs. He's the motherfucker in the road that

799
02:41:38,229 --> 02:41:44,870
has the health packs. What if they don't? Okay hold on. What if can I just be a dead guy in the

02:41:44,870 --> 02:42:29,620
road? They might not see me. All right nobody fucking move. You gotta be fucking kidding me.

801
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:55,739
Oh you slow motherfucker. What what's going on? Why are they running this way? That guy died.

02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:44,579
who's okay we got leg head. Okay he's not dying anymore. Dog is okay. Left arm. You gotta splint

809
02:44:44,579 --> 02:44:56,620
that shit don't you? First aid. Pick up first aid. Go over here to Frogmusk. All right you

810
02:44:56,620 --> 02:45:12,069
gotta get everyone stop sneaking now. First aid. Heal that arm first. You're gonna be

811
02:45:12,069 --> 02:45:30,170
fucking useless without it. How do I heal that arm? Splint the arm. Do I not have any

812
02:45:30,170 --> 02:45:40,260
more splints? Bottom right. Medic. First thing splint will order your selected characters to

813
02:45:40,260 --> 02:45:44,420
automatically heal everyone in the squad. Okay no no but that wouldn't that I need to heal myself.

814
02:45:44,420 --> 02:45:49,690
Why can I not splint my own injury? Is it splinted? The wound is getting worse.

815
02:45:49,690 --> 02:46:02,090
Doesn't have a little bar that goes up when it's splinted. Jesus christ. Just heal.

816
02:46:04,059 --> 02:46:14,920
Candroff is okay now. Can I do that to you? Splint injuries. Let's actually get me to a

817
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:22,200
safe place before any more of this shit's going on. Pick up. Get over here. This is just a bad

818
02:46:22,200 --> 02:46:35,479
place to be standing. Just medic. Just press this button and that's it. Heal her arm. I'm trying.

819
02:46:35,479 --> 02:46:43,909
I don't understand. What do you what do you mean? I can't when I do first aid she just stands

820
02:46:43,909 --> 02:47:12,309
there. First aid. It's what where where is the first aid happening right now? Because you're in

821
02:47:12,309 --> 02:47:18,309
the negatives. And now I'm fucked. So I have to move again. I quick saved it before all this

822
02:47:18,309 --> 02:47:24,520
happened. I mean this these guys are all terrible but are they terrible enough? No I don't I'm

823
02:47:24,520 --> 02:47:40,569
gonna get destroyed here. I mean we can see how this plays out. Oh no I'm getting my ass

824
02:47:40,569 --> 02:47:56,100
kicked. This is too many of them. No that's not gonna happen. All right first of all you

825
02:47:56,100 --> 02:48:25,879
gotta put him down. How's everybody? The arm is gone. The arm is gone. What? Wait wait what?

826
02:48:25,879 --> 02:48:41,989
Hold on. All right let me I need to get this straight because this this is like

827
02:48:41,989 --> 02:48:48,680
very confusing. You have to have a med pack. Do you have to have a splint kit to splint

828
02:48:48,680 --> 02:48:51,719
your arm and if you'll just it'll just do it automatically if you press like the medic

829
02:48:51,719 --> 02:48:59,829
button down here. Like there's so many different moving pieces here. So just click

830
02:48:59,829 --> 02:49:07,370
the medic button and they'll just do it. You don't need it. It's just a med kit. It's only

831
02:49:07,370 --> 02:49:19,340
visible if it's not negative. Medic has it heal everyone. Well let's just go back there.

832
02:49:20,139 --> 02:49:26,180
It was in the negative and that's why it wasn't showing. Well I mean like that how

833
02:49:26,180 --> 02:49:44,680
to hell am I supposed to know that? Just just use first aid and just wait. All right

834
02:49:45,399 --> 02:49:51,079
this is where we left off before. I need to just I have to get out of this place because

835
02:49:51,079 --> 02:49:55,659
there's just so many different opportunities for people to come over here. Nobody's here now

836
02:49:55,659 --> 02:50:00,540
but they will be. So we need to go back to where we were. Let's select everybody.

837
02:50:02,680 --> 02:50:13,319
No more sneaking. Get the fuck over here. You. Trade. Get the first aid off of him.

838
02:50:14,659 --> 02:50:28,979
You want it in here. Give one to Barnabas as well. Okay now I'm just gonna I'm just

839
02:50:28,979 --> 02:50:37,290
gonna press the medic button because that'll just heal everybody in the squad or does it

840
02:50:37,290 --> 02:50:52,659
just happen? Is that correct? Right? That is right. So just medic. Medic. But no first

841
02:50:52,659 --> 02:51:03,100
heal myself because my arm. So heal first aid. Let's go. You're on just medic job right?

842
02:51:03,979 --> 02:51:20,860
You're up here. Wait where are you? Nobody coming. All right heal. Get that arm healed.

843
02:51:24,020 --> 02:51:28,100
Okay that's what the problem was because it was so it was apparently so negative that I couldn't

844
02:51:28,100 --> 02:51:41,350
even see it. That's why I was panicking. I could get a robot arm. I could. You're right.

845
02:51:42,069 --> 02:51:50,729
All right just check. Make sure there's no bandits or people running over here to come

846
02:51:50,729 --> 02:52:05,340
get me. They're not so this should be fine. All right now medic how you doing over here?

847
02:52:08,149 --> 02:52:25,209
Good. Grand. Wonderful. Minus 10,000 it's too negative. Almost time to get out of here.

848
02:52:30,329 --> 02:52:42,940
Good. Good. Come on. Come on. Okay why would you say that? I thought he was a bad guy.

849
02:52:43,579 --> 02:52:51,129
Frog musk is now in recovery coma. How about yourself? How about the dog? The dog needs

850
02:52:51,129 --> 02:53:02,979
healing too. Heal dog. Holy shit who are these people? Oh it's just a bunch of goats thank

851
02:53:02,979 --> 02:53:26,739
god. Let's get out of here. All right out. Pick up you. You pick up Roth. You pick up

852
02:53:27,379 --> 02:53:42,170
frog. Let's get the fuck out of here. I can't. Shit. How the hell am I gonna transport anybody?

853
02:53:44,569 --> 02:53:53,799
You're gonna you have to pick him up. We gotta get off the road. We're gonna get out of here.

854
02:53:54,520 --> 02:54:16,059
Someplace safe. I need like a shelter or something. Just I know I'm gonna splint but

855
02:54:16,059 --> 02:54:20,700
I just gotta get off the road. I know it didn't matter last time but just so far away here.

856
02:54:21,659 --> 02:54:33,829
Okay splint. I need you to splint. Okay I've splinted.

857
02:54:37,159 --> 02:54:42,420
Uh doesn't look like it. That does not look like it's splinted. It is though.

858
02:54:44,979 --> 02:54:56,700
Hydrate. It's too negative for sprint uh splint to work. Okay can you pick up?

859
02:54:57,579 --> 02:54:59,899
I can't carry with this arm. The dog can't do it either.

860
02:55:01,020 --> 02:55:09,610
When are you gonna get? When are you gonna get up? Can you carry two people?

861
02:55:12,260 --> 02:55:28,440
No you can't carry two people can you? We gotta get we have to move.

862
02:55:29,479 --> 02:55:46,569
Sorry frogmust. We'll come back for you. He'll be safe. He'll be safe right? Don't go back to

863
02:55:46,569 --> 02:55:52,969
the hub. Wait why not? That's that's like the safest place. Hold on. Food? I don't he

864
02:55:52,969 --> 02:56:08,149
don't think he has any food on him. He was pretty empty wasn't he? I mean he has items but

865
02:56:09,430 --> 02:56:13,020
should I take the items off of him? That sounds like a bad idea.

866
02:56:13,020 --> 02:56:27,110
Okay he is plenty his food is okay. He's at 272. He'll be all right. Yeah he's fine.

867
02:56:27,829 --> 02:56:33,290
Yeah he doesn't have any food on him or anything. So this is the reason to really I can't really

868
02:56:33,290 --> 02:56:40,440
do much to him. He'll be all right over here. He'll be fine. I need to go rest up at the hub.

869
02:56:41,319 --> 02:56:49,770
Let's go. First of all let me quick save this. We're gonna move pretty slowly because I

870
02:56:49,770 --> 02:56:57,590
have to carry. I should really move together just in case something bad happens. Oh this

871
02:56:57,590 --> 02:57:06,040
sucks. This is so bad. They have to move so slow. I can't leave him behind and your arm

872
02:57:06,040 --> 02:57:30,280
is doesn't work. You got nothing on you. It's worth taking. Go to the way station.

873
02:57:33,110 --> 02:57:39,510
Yeah but I mean I don't know what's here. This is I I paid 10 grand to be able to come

874
02:57:39,510 --> 02:57:51,860
back here and use this place. I'm just gonna walk in here and be like hey hi guys. It's

875
02:57:51,860 --> 02:57:57,620
neutral. No I mean I got beds here. I'm going back here. Even if the way station is safe I got

876
02:57:57,620 --> 02:58:03,909
beds and I got food and shit that's there. And it's they're both I would say they're pretty

877
02:58:03,909 --> 02:58:13,979
much this is like maybe a small the distance is not a big deal. The guild is in other cities.

878
02:58:14,620 --> 02:58:22,739
Yeah that's not a guarantee for me right now. They're in every town. Yeah but I mean I mean

879
02:58:23,379 --> 02:58:28,020
am I just getting like spoiled back seated here? Should I just go down to way station

880
02:58:28,020 --> 02:58:33,620
and just because that's where I need to go? What do you want me to say? I wouldn't know that.

881
02:58:33,620 --> 02:58:44,219
You all just told me. Like you what? I'm just I'm going to the hub. No hub. That's where

882
02:58:44,219 --> 02:59:07,450
we're going. Don't eat the raspberries. It's right here. Speed it up. Here comes a meltdown.

883
02:59:07,450 --> 02:59:15,930
No it's not a meltdown but like I I don't like know what this is. So if I had stumbled across

884
02:59:15,930 --> 02:59:21,399
this place and I'm like no that's not safe but if you know it's safe you know what I mean? I

885
02:59:21,399 --> 02:59:34,229
don't know it's there. It's a trading place. Well that's that's great. I'm sure I'll see it

886
02:59:34,229 --> 02:59:58,250
again real soon. Let's go. I'm like right there anyways. It's not a big deal. Yeah and

887
02:59:58,250 --> 03:00:05,770
why would I trust chat anyways? I can count on 25 fingers and toes the amount of times

888
03:00:05,770 --> 03:00:11,450
that people have told me to do something and it turns out to be the thing I should I absolutely

889
03:00:11,450 --> 03:00:23,110
should not have done. How am I supposed to know what's real? All right frog must just got up

890
03:00:24,969 --> 03:00:57,540
and can you walk? They're not coming over to me right? I had nothing to do with this. Jesus

891
03:00:57,540 --> 03:01:18,649
Christ. All right let's meet up. You guys can walk. He'll make it and we'll go. Turn on

892
03:01:18,649 --> 03:01:29,500
Yakety Sax. Actually I'm just gonna wait for him. That's the right thing to do. He's

893
03:01:29,500 --> 03:01:35,399
right here and he's right he's like full sprinting so he's fine. Actually it's probably

894
03:01:35,399 --> 03:01:48,409
ah no no no just just get there safe. All of you. Goats just saved my life. They probably did.

895
03:01:49,500 --> 03:01:57,139
They probably did. Now it's the right thing to do. Well if he can move then yeah it's the

896
03:01:57,139 --> 03:02:22,739
right thing to do. He made it. Good job frog musk. Good work. Uh we're there. We'll go in

897
03:02:22,739 --> 03:02:33,959
there dude. What are you doing? Hello. That's because it's lagging away. I don't want it's

898
03:02:33,959 --> 03:02:51,270
gonna crash the game. It's loading the town. There we go. On your way in. How do I like the game? I

899
03:02:51,270 --> 03:02:58,090
found it hard to get into. What start did I use? I did the dog wanderer. The game is incredibly

900
03:02:58,090 --> 03:03:05,450
hard to get into. It uh it asks a lot of the player because you just start out at zero and

901
03:03:05,450 --> 03:03:11,100
you're terrible and everything's terrible. But I think that it's a lot of fun. I think that

902
03:03:11,100 --> 03:03:16,260
it is a lot. This is a great game here if you have the patience for it. I think it's

903
03:03:16,260 --> 03:03:20,819
good. I did do yeah I did start with slave. That's right. But I didn't finish on slave.

904
03:03:24,340 --> 03:03:30,120
If you're into hardcore RPGs it's great. And then that's the thing I'm I'm not really at all.

905
03:03:30,120 --> 03:03:37,319
I'm actually really not into hardcore super hard death patience kind of RPG games. But

906
03:03:37,319 --> 03:03:41,319
something of this one's just doing it for me for some reason. So I don't know what that

907
03:03:41,319 --> 03:03:54,170
means but it's fun. So uh you're safe. Save it. I'll save it when I get in the town

908
03:03:54,170 --> 03:04:02,680
because I have an auto save that just happened a few minutes ago. So it's because it's goofy. It

909
03:04:02,680 --> 03:04:09,000
is kind of goofy but it's in a charming kind of way. What is this? Copper. Don't want it.

910
03:04:14,659 --> 03:04:18,899
And then from here I'm gonna go I want to go the way that I wanted to go in the first place

911
03:04:18,899 --> 03:04:29,079
which is kind of like down here. So we'll see. I've ever played enter the gungeon. I have.

912
03:04:30,040 --> 03:04:33,319
I streamed it once. I didn't really play it that much afterwards.

913
03:04:43,079 --> 03:04:45,879
Probably the freeform sandbox is better for your play style.

914
03:04:47,909 --> 03:04:50,950
Yeah because you kind of just get to do whatever you want. You just kind of get to do whatever

915
03:04:50,950 --> 03:04:55,350
the hell you want. And that could be anything. It could be whatever the hell you want.

916
03:04:56,709 --> 03:05:00,549
You want to eat food and just sit by fire and tell ghost stories? Go for it.

917
03:05:01,270 --> 03:05:03,750
You want to go get your ass kicked by a group of bandits? Sure.

918
03:05:04,549 --> 03:05:11,260
There's no nobody tells you what direction to go. But you better go to the way station

919
03:05:35,799 --> 03:05:39,799
Is that how you think we sound? No I was making a funny comedy joke.

920
03:05:41,479 --> 03:05:45,239
Actually it's been a while. I should probably take a second to get a drink.

921
03:05:45,959 --> 03:05:56,250
Fill up my cup. Play mountain blade. Okay is mountain blade. Would I like mountain blade if

922
03:05:56,250 --> 03:06:00,420
I liked this game? Would I? I know a lot of people have wanted me to play that for a long

923
03:06:00,420 --> 03:06:09,290
time. Would I have fun in mountain blade? It's not really the same. Yes but yes. Maybe

924
03:06:09,290 --> 03:06:13,770
I'll try it one day. But I can see my voice is getting a little so I'll be right back.

925
03:06:14,489 --> 03:06:29,420
Don't go. Oh they didn't even turn up my webcam. But that didn't work either. Okay see you in a

926
03:06:29,420 --> 03:09:50,299
second. What's the noise? I've got the fallout soundtrack. Wait no yeah this is New Vegas.

927
03:09:55,190 --> 03:10:09,959
Oh shit my house is on fire. Ah crack it up with a cold one. All right where were we?

928
03:10:09,959 --> 03:10:29,000
No there I am. All right we've made it. We've made it to the town. I got a coke. They're

929
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:46,729
just easy. This is not an endorsement. All right everybody is normal hungry. I need food.

930
03:10:47,049 --> 03:10:54,180
Did I get anything to sell? Let me take a look at the toughness and shit. So five toughness.

931
03:10:54,180 --> 03:11:03,610
That's good. Everybody kind of got hit. Twelve toughness. Six. Four. Five. At least they're

932
03:11:03,610 --> 03:11:11,190
not at zero or one anymore. Coke? They're easy. Yeah they are. They're pretty easy.

933
03:11:11,829 --> 03:11:25,620
So let's go sleep in the beds that I have up here. Everybody move. What a Pepsi show. I

934
03:11:25,620 --> 03:11:31,379
actually don't like Pepsi. I think Pepsi is like I'd rather have a Coke than a Pepsi. But

935
03:11:31,379 --> 03:11:37,459
I'm not one of those people that will refuse a Pepsi. They're pretty much the same damn thing.

936
03:11:38,180 --> 03:11:52,149
So I gotta go all the way up huh? Everybody go rest. The thing is the dog can't rest up there

937
03:11:52,149 --> 03:12:04,629
can he? Unfortunately. That's a very controversial statement. I don't think so. I don't think it's

938
03:12:04,629 --> 03:12:14,489
that controversial. All right. Frog musk. Get in bed. Everybody get in bed. Am I still carrying

939
03:12:14,489 --> 03:12:36,760
canned rothy? I am. Pogchamp. Dog can rest. Is dog allowed somewhere else? Because the dog

940
03:12:36,760 --> 03:12:47,979
can't go in this building. Where can I put the dog to sleep? Just carry the dog in.

941
03:12:50,059 --> 03:12:54,860
Oh whoever's last standing here. All right. Madam you go to bed over here.

942
03:12:55,819 --> 03:13:04,420
Put down Woods' space. Can roth get in that bed and pick up the dog.

943
03:13:05,219 --> 03:13:34,549
Come on up. Well the dog is allowed up here. Well look at that. Dog not sleeping. I guess

944
03:13:34,549 --> 03:13:44,010
dog is not sleeping. Well he's pretty much in bed. How's everybody doing? We just have to

945
03:13:44,010 --> 03:13:50,579
rest here for like a full day probably. Pick him up and put him in bed from carry. Does

946
03:13:50,579 --> 03:14:07,959
that actually do anything? That's weird. Okay. Well they're all sleeping. Welcome to the rest

947
03:14:07,959 --> 03:14:25,780
of the stream. All right. Fastboard. I need food. Oh man we're going to be in here for

948
03:14:25,780 --> 03:14:36,329
a little while. There's some actual regular beds. A floor or two down. Is this more

949
03:14:36,329 --> 03:14:51,059
comfortable? Bed versus camp bed. I guess so. So how many there? Three? No there's

950
03:14:51,059 --> 03:15:04,299
enough. You get in that one. You get in that one. You get in that one. It's times eight

951
03:15:04,299 --> 03:15:14,579
versus times four. Is there any more? No it's just those three. So everyone is in bed.

952
03:15:15,540 --> 03:15:31,319
Uh you. What the fuck is this camera doing? Good luck. Well now we do. We don't we all

953
03:15:31,319 --> 03:15:35,719
of our party members are in trouble so just keep them here. We'll switch off the beds too.

954
03:15:36,440 --> 03:15:45,100
Everyone in Germany embarrassed themselves singing. What a mess. That stream didn't even

955
03:15:45,100 --> 03:16:06,180
happen. What an odds beginning to the stream that was. Play Oregon Trail? It's kind of what

956
03:16:06,180 --> 03:16:13,780
I'm doing. Isn't that like a version of sort of what I'm doing right now in a way. All right

957
03:16:13,780 --> 03:16:28,819
almost at full head. We need food. Bad. Uh Kenroth's almost completely fine. Dog is completely

958
03:16:28,819 --> 03:16:36,729
fine. Madam Shatam is. Yeah Madam Shatam needs to be moved to one of the more comfortable

959
03:16:36,729 --> 03:16:47,370
beds. So wait till you're all at 100 and there we go. So let's just go down now.

960
03:16:48,649 --> 03:16:58,229
Swap beds please with really anybody. Just get up. You get in this one. All right we've lived

961
03:16:58,229 --> 03:17:15,770
to tell another tale. 14 plus 12. 16 plus 8. 10 plus 8. 8 plus 4 and 13. Hungry. That's

962
03:17:22,680 --> 03:17:27,670
almost just all fell out of my mouth. I don't know why. I like went like and the whole thing

963
03:17:27,670 --> 03:17:35,219
just almost came out. So I don't have any money and I have no supplies except perhaps

964
03:17:35,219 --> 03:17:43,270
a couple things I could probably sell. Not really though. Uh you're gonna be there for

965
03:17:43,270 --> 03:17:57,899
a little while so everybody else get up. The three of you need to go mine. Yeah I need some

966
03:17:57,979 --> 03:18:23,540
miners. Can you not get out of bed? The dog can't get out of bed. Everybody out. Why are you

967
03:18:23,540 --> 03:18:41,340
sneaking? So get off a sneak. Put the dog down now. Who's sneaking? All right mine. I need some

968
03:18:41,340 --> 03:18:55,340
ore. I need. I could do iron too. Copper. Is this this is iron right? Yeah. Where's the

969
03:18:55,340 --> 03:19:14,260
copper? It's over here somewhere. On the side. Small copper. Small. There's two small

970
03:19:14,260 --> 03:19:21,739
coppers but wasn't there a bigger one? I swear there was a bigger maybe. Is it gone? Did they

971
03:19:21,739 --> 03:19:58,969
did they despawn after a while? Iron. That's iron too. Uh I guess there are there are two

972
03:19:58,969 --> 03:20:09,030
over here. Only two people can mine these though. I could go. Oh what's this? It's iron.

973
03:20:12,600 --> 03:20:22,309
Shit. Really? Hmm. I guess we're gonna go one two and then how many people can

974
03:20:22,309 --> 03:20:26,870
fit on this one? Three. So we're gonna have who has the best mining skill right now?

975
03:20:27,750 --> 03:20:48,360
Use prospect. I mean this is in those two spots that I saw and then down here. Oh yeah. Copper

976
03:20:49,159 --> 03:20:51,959
iron. This one's this one's a lot farther away though isn't it?

977
03:20:53,219 --> 03:20:57,739
Not really. All right who's got the good prospecting? Everybody can just get it. So

978
03:20:57,739 --> 03:21:05,500
we got one two three four. That'll work out. Who has the best skill? That's the question.

979
03:21:09,500 --> 03:21:19,780
Got laboring five, laboring 18, laboring 28, laboring 52. You can get over there.

980
03:21:20,899 --> 03:21:25,530
The two the two strongest should be on the one that both of them can go right?

981
03:21:26,170 --> 03:21:40,760
Because then they'll just power through it and then you other two are this way. One here.

982
03:21:41,959 --> 03:21:47,430
Yeah right here and then your arm is almost better so you can do it.

983
03:21:48,229 --> 03:21:52,889
We're just gonna have copper going and the dog can run in a circle.

984
03:21:56,409 --> 03:22:07,530
You need to nuke the chat. All right you're good. Get up. Go mine. How's everybody doing?

985
03:22:07,530 --> 03:22:16,620
We good? Making your way over there? Start the mining. Good. They're already doing it over there.

986
03:22:19,459 --> 03:22:30,409
Out you go. Time to make some money. Chat is awfully quiet for Kenshi. No back seating?

987
03:22:31,290 --> 03:22:41,860
Oh I had a reprimand moment. I said excuse me. Excuse me. And everybody went

988
03:22:43,079 --> 03:23:12,780
that face that go to the way station now. How long is it gonna take you to get one? Long time.

989
03:23:13,659 --> 03:23:26,659
Well uh it is kind of a joke but it's not. Welcome uh welcome to the next view a little

990
03:23:26,659 --> 03:23:37,559
bit of the stream here. This is this is Nightcrawler. This is this is Nightwing.

991
03:23:38,680 --> 03:24:18,379
This is a Nightwing shirt. Boomer comic? Nightwing? They're like bringing Nightwing

992
03:24:18,379 --> 03:24:29,579
into mainstream now. A Boomer comic. Oh my god can you believe it? Boomer comic. How dare you?

993
03:24:32,440 --> 03:24:53,459
How double dog dare you? I'm gonna make 50 fucking thousand. I kind of need to have a lot

994
03:24:53,459 --> 03:25:19,129
of bullshit in my inventory. It's all right it'll be enough. Zoomers burn. Zoomer. I can only get

995
03:25:19,129 --> 03:25:34,540
two more. How you doing over here? I think it's time for you to one two two more for you.

996
03:25:35,579 --> 03:25:46,040
You guys can stay here all day for all I care especially because I can stack.

997
03:25:46,040 --> 03:25:51,159
Oh yeah at least canned Roth is gonna stay. I still haven't turned up the music.

998
03:25:52,120 --> 03:25:59,590
What the what the what the

999
03:26:21,770 --> 03:26:39,139
Let's see. How about uh fun time? Shovel Knight. What on the dwarf mining music?

1000
03:26:40,579 --> 03:27:03,450
How about something simple? Iron Forge. No that'll be annoying after a few minutes.

1001
03:27:10,600 --> 03:27:15,959
No no no no ST. I'm going musicless for a little bit. It's almost we're almost done here anyways.

1002
03:27:17,239 --> 03:27:40,020
Is that near me at all? Kind of. It's okay. What are you two doing? Get to work. What are you

1003
03:27:40,020 --> 03:28:07,670
doing? He just paused. I apologize. Dog is hungry. You can get one more. Uh oh damn it.

1004
03:28:08,739 --> 03:28:28,809
Just fill it up with five. This hat's worth like a cent. Just like I'm fine. Can't arrange

1005
03:28:28,809 --> 03:28:42,540
this any better. Are you sure? I guess not. No I'll just get it to five. I can come back and

1006
03:28:42,540 --> 03:28:53,750
grab it. So you go back to town. Go hang out with Masamune and then you are probably done

1007
03:28:53,750 --> 03:29:00,459
here. Yes you are. Same deal this thing is worth like two cents. Just get rid of it.

1008
03:29:01,100 --> 03:29:10,870
Take this last one and arrange and now you go back to town too. That leaves just the two

1009
03:29:10,870 --> 03:29:33,239
of you. So frog go back to town. Keep working. Keep working. I'm gonna have him fill his entire

1010
03:29:33,239 --> 03:29:41,190
bag. What is the goal of this game? There is none. The goal of the game is to do whatever

1011
03:29:41,190 --> 03:29:48,489
you want. Whatever you want. You can buy up stuff. Make money. Build a town. Have a shit.

1012
03:29:48,489 --> 03:29:54,409
What's wrong with Masamune? Oh hungry. You could just go fight. Steal. Attack. Kill. Kind

1013
03:29:54,409 --> 03:30:01,059
of whatever you want and I just itched my head and there was like something in my hair.

1014
03:30:03,379 --> 03:30:07,219
I don't know if it's a bug or not but I might have a scream panic moment right now because

1015
03:30:07,219 --> 03:30:12,360
there's a bug in my fucking hair. That was weird. That was a weird feeling.

1016
03:30:14,200 --> 03:30:21,639
It's not lice. I wash my hair all the time. At least twice a year so it's not that.

1017
03:30:27,780 --> 03:30:31,700
Sell. Who is this? I don't want to sell to this person do I?

1018
03:30:32,680 --> 03:30:45,510
Because does this person have a 50% discount? Yeah I know. Sell to the bartender. Don't sell

1019
03:30:45,510 --> 03:30:57,059
to this guy. Where's that fucking bar? Over here. How can you only wash twice a year with

1020
03:30:57,059 --> 03:31:10,040
all the product? What the fuck happened over there? All right you back. You back. You back

1021
03:31:10,040 --> 03:31:14,600
here. You back here. All of you. Sell. You have a lot of things to sell. How you doing?

1022
03:31:27,180 --> 03:31:32,120
You guys are all going the weirdest possible way. Why would you run all this way?

1023
03:31:33,260 --> 03:31:38,680
Where the hell are you going? You can't just walk across the town like a normal person?

1024
03:31:42,040 --> 03:31:48,420
Bar thug. Got a problem. Take it somewhere else. Pacifier. Everybody need help with

1025
03:31:48,420 --> 03:31:53,079
some things over the hounds okay. Twitch bar thug. This is a chat member.

1026
03:31:53,719 --> 03:32:00,819
You got a problem? Runt. The hell do you want? I was just curious. I'm just like playing the

1027
03:32:00,819 --> 03:32:11,659
game and I'm gonna go like to the hub. Idiot. What are you stupid? I'm just admiring your

1028
03:32:11,659 --> 03:32:19,209
sword. I just think you look great today. I would like to buy you a drink. Make it grog.

1029
03:32:19,209 --> 03:32:34,229
A cold one. Oh this is embarrassing. I don't have enough money. What are you fucking stupid?

1030
03:32:34,790 --> 03:32:47,209
Show me you goods. Yeah sell. Sell. Sell. Back to even. Just eat this because you're gonna eat it

1031
03:32:47,209 --> 03:33:01,639
right now anyways. All right. Who else has got stuff? You do. Go on in. Oh I forgot. This is my

1032
03:33:01,639 --> 03:33:13,780
this is my character. Show me what you got. Yep. Now this. 24.39. Martial arts bonus.

1033
03:33:18,139 --> 03:33:36,420
You should buy that. Yeah. Those are epic pants. Barnabas what's wrong with you?

1034
03:33:37,139 --> 03:33:48,200
Why was I like not allowed to go in there? Should I keep the crossbow?

1035
03:33:52,950 --> 03:34:04,340
I don't think I I mean for a while. He's he's he's martial arts. Okay now martial arts bonus

1036
03:34:04,340 --> 03:34:10,709
plus four. That's what he currently had on. That's five and five percent eight percent cut

1037
03:34:10,709 --> 03:34:18,950
resistance and it's let's take that off and just go trade with you. Not you. You. Because

1038
03:34:19,030 --> 03:34:28,149
yours is just way better right? 24.39. Six kilograms. Four kilograms. Acid. Coverage.

1039
03:34:29,270 --> 03:34:43,860
It's a little makes me a little slower. Let's see. Oh let's see. Oh they're pants.

1040
03:34:43,860 --> 03:34:51,190
Okay I thought it was like a armor. Oh they're way better. I thought they were pants.

1041
03:34:51,909 --> 03:34:55,500
I mean I thought they were. It was like a something to go on my chest.

1042
03:34:56,219 --> 03:35:01,500
I don't know why I thought that. This on the other hand can just go back to where it was.

1043
03:35:03,799 --> 03:35:11,780
That's pretty damn good. Keep that metal plate on.

1044
03:35:12,500 --> 03:35:24,329
Keep this one on. 34 that's. Eat the deer. We're in a Jupiter storm. We'll be fine.

1045
03:35:26,100 --> 03:35:29,860
Somebody just subscribed and I have no idea who the heck it is.

1046
03:35:33,379 --> 03:35:39,690
But thanks. Boots. Boots. What about this? Look at the martial arts because that's really

1047
03:35:39,690 --> 03:35:48,069
good now. Barnabas is fucking fantastic now. All right let's go back to selling.

1048
03:35:49,260 --> 03:35:53,930
Sell those pants. I don't know why I thought that just said boomer.

1049
03:35:53,930 --> 03:36:08,950
All right. Everybody is good now. We just need food. Health pack. Health pack. What do you

1050
03:36:08,950 --> 03:36:15,399
get for food that I can afford? It might be time to steal a bunch of food from some random

1051
03:36:15,399 --> 03:36:31,020
person's house. Make money a job and they will pocket the ore by themselves. Interesting.

1052
03:36:31,979 --> 03:36:45,190
Operating machine copper resources. Is that it? Is that gonna do it? I don't need storage

1053
03:36:45,190 --> 03:36:53,620
for that. They won't pocket it unless I have the box. Well it's all right. Let's go back

1054
03:36:53,620 --> 03:37:09,940
here. Endless Coca-Cola. 4600 I'll have probably about 10 grand. I need food. It's

1055
03:37:09,940 --> 03:37:13,940
probably worth buying. Is it worth buying some of this shit? Oh can I just steal it?

1056
03:37:15,379 --> 03:37:30,149
Bread. All you have is the expensive food. It's 500 bucks. 700 bucks. 287. 575.

1057
03:37:38,489 --> 03:37:50,780
I need to make food. Big money. I'm gonna buy one of these. No I can't even do that.

1058
03:37:51,420 --> 03:37:59,379
It's worth it to make storage. It will make it so easy to make money.

1059
03:38:00,340 --> 03:38:09,530
That's bad. I gotta buy a new house. Right? The house that I have already bought is back

1060
03:38:09,530 --> 03:38:18,520
there and it's got like a shit. It's got like a level one training dummy. What are the houses

1061
03:38:18,520 --> 03:38:25,510
here? Because this is I mean the journey is supposed to be taking me. I started up here.

1062
03:38:26,069 --> 03:38:33,850
I went up here. I got screamed at. So I turned around. I went down this way through here,

1063
03:38:33,850 --> 03:38:41,079
through here, and then down here. So I was gonna think about trying to go through like

1064
03:38:41,159 --> 03:38:52,379
this section here. What's going on? Now this is what I call a chat experience.

1065
03:38:54,299 --> 03:39:04,360
It's pretty good. I like it. Why did I just say that? I do like it. Because I do. All right

1066
03:39:04,360 --> 03:39:14,899
let me just get this saved. I might just have to go hungry. Down. Let me just look. Yeah I

1067
03:39:14,899 --> 03:39:23,559
might have to go hungry down. It's very possible. If you get storage they'll auto mine

1068
03:39:23,559 --> 03:39:26,520
and then you can just have your guy with the backpack go in and out of the world.

1069
03:39:26,520 --> 03:39:33,340
It's sweet. Yeah I think it's probably time just to make somebody a permanent worker

1070
03:39:34,059 --> 03:39:42,149
and it's probably gonna have to be this person. So where... I gotta go back to my house.

1071
03:39:44,540 --> 03:39:51,190
My house is back here, right? Get a storage unit built. Have him just be a permanent miner.

1072
03:39:53,219 --> 03:40:01,739
Can't Roth is not not at all fit to fight. No he's not. Get a new house. I could do

1073
03:40:01,739 --> 03:40:07,899
that. This is expensive though and what does it take? Is there any cheap cheap houses here?

1074
03:40:07,899 --> 03:40:21,059
This one right here. 1500. Anything cheap in this? 15 15 1500. Because I could just have

1075
03:40:21,059 --> 03:40:31,059
build the storage thing here. There's a lot of mining and resources out here. I'm gonna buy

1076
03:40:31,059 --> 03:40:42,600
this. But should I? Could I? I can't build in here. It might be worth it to get a

1077
03:40:42,600 --> 03:40:48,040
larger building. I don't have any more. I don't have any money. I guess I could come back

1078
03:40:48,040 --> 03:40:54,340
with the... All right here's the plan. Here's the plan. I'm gonna sell all this, come back,

1079
03:40:54,340 --> 03:41:01,500
buy a big house here and then I'm going to have him permanently mine copper with the storage unit

1080
03:41:01,500 --> 03:41:13,610
and just keep mine. This one is 10 500 or 6 000 or I could get one of these for 4 000.

1081
03:41:31,670 --> 03:41:39,850
Small storage shack. I could just get a yeah I could get a cheap house and have it only be

1082
03:41:39,850 --> 03:41:55,379
for storing materials. That sounds like a good idea. All right 7 800.

1083
03:41:58,899 --> 03:42:13,579
Who you vote? There's no vote kick. Vote kick? I'm thinking this one's 10 000. No it's too...

1084
03:42:13,579 --> 03:42:20,979
I think I just want to have for now I'll do I'll get a small one build a I need a

1085
03:42:20,979 --> 03:42:28,729
really need a research bench in there too. Oh do I? Wait I don't do I need a research

1086
03:42:28,729 --> 03:42:44,659
bench in here. Storage copper. I need one iron plate. Don't vote kick me. What's why vote

1087
03:42:44,659 --> 03:42:53,610
kicking me? Yeah how big is how big does this need to be? This is just barely is this

1088
03:42:53,610 --> 03:43:12,180
barely gonna fit in here? So long streamer. Uh oh I'm gonna be fucked. Yeah I'm gonna buy

1089
03:43:12,180 --> 03:43:18,420
this one. I'm just gonna do it and have a couple things here. I don't I don't have the

1090
03:43:18,420 --> 03:43:22,180
means to do this right now. I'd rather just kind of get this going. So I'm gonna put a

1091
03:43:22,180 --> 03:43:30,139
bed and some storage units in here and then have him just permanently mine forever. Building

1092
03:43:30,139 --> 03:43:42,870
purchase. Everybody get over here and help. Oh I need three building materials. That's easy

1093
03:43:42,870 --> 03:43:52,120
I can get them. Oh can I? Does the trading who sells? I need to get building materials. Shit.

1094
03:43:52,920 --> 03:44:00,340
Did you have any? I need how many do I need? Oh you do. I only have two though. Shit.

1095
03:44:01,139 --> 03:44:14,459
How many did I need? I think I needed three. I need three building material.

1096
03:44:15,420 --> 03:44:37,819
Damn it. That's all right. There's two. Damn it. Well bring them over here. That's adding

1097
03:44:37,819 --> 03:44:52,600
materials. So now I need one more. What time is it? Uh everyone just chill for a little bit of

1098
03:44:52,600 --> 03:44:56,760
time. Anything I can do in the meantime? Maybe I could have somebody go back and

1099
03:44:57,719 --> 03:45:05,979
yeah you know what you go mine for now just go mine. Go mine that same dumb vein because

1100
03:45:05,979 --> 03:45:25,139
then after that eventually I'm gonna upgrade it. So go back there and mine. All right. Midnight.

1101
03:45:26,649 --> 03:45:47,850
Sleep. What have I done? I haven't done anything. The fence might have building materials.

1102
03:45:48,569 --> 03:46:01,450
Last time I went there he only I think he only had clothes. All right it's almost

1103
03:46:01,450 --> 03:46:23,719
midnight. Is it exactly at midnight? Let's find out. Midnight. Hey you got any new stuff?

1104
03:46:24,520 --> 03:46:46,809
Idling hunt times 10. I kind of have to. I don't see anything else over there.

1105
03:46:47,770 --> 03:47:16,200
What did I do? What did I do? Rest. That's the fucking arrest steam train. Go to a different

1106
03:47:16,200 --> 03:47:25,500
place with materials. I have to send somebody on an expedition then. So I'm gonna say

1107
03:47:26,379 --> 03:47:39,180
can I get them? Will they sell that at the hive village? They might. I guess you could go

1108
03:47:39,180 --> 03:47:43,180
just go get them. Although be careful because I'm gonna save this. What if you get like

1109
03:47:43,180 --> 03:47:59,739
jumped on the way there? That's like my hometown. What time is it? 8 30. When does

1110
03:47:59,739 --> 03:48:09,049
when does my new game come in? Massive. Oh fucking god damn it. That's right. I gotta

1111
03:48:09,049 --> 03:48:14,629
give. I have to buy like one piece of cheese for the dog. Come here. Where's the can drop?

1112
03:48:14,629 --> 03:48:20,620
I gotta. No no no no no no. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. Go back and get this.

1113
03:48:24,059 --> 03:48:39,110
Yeah I ordered a new game. He only notices when we're in morning. That's not true.

1114
03:48:44,569 --> 03:48:58,059
Ah come over here. Now give me. I have to buy something for the dog. I'm gonna buy a

1115
03:48:58,780 --> 03:49:07,270
fucking food cube. 25 nutrition versus 75 cooked vegetables. Will the dog eat the cooked vegetables?

1116
03:49:07,989 --> 03:49:30,440
I don't think so. What about the food cube? Because the food cube is uh has a bar. So face

1117
03:49:30,440 --> 03:49:37,670
cam stream. I don't I have no idea why this is even on. You're right. The dog will only

1118
03:49:37,670 --> 03:49:56,280
eat meat. Well that's not good. Call food cube. He's crying. I'm gonna get a food cube

1119
03:49:57,879 --> 03:50:08,010
and then bring it back to the dog. All right dog. Where the hell is dog? What is dog doing

1120
03:50:08,010 --> 03:50:15,770
all the way over here? All right you on an expedition yet? You are. Probably not in any

1121
03:50:15,770 --> 03:50:23,139
trouble. Where the hell did you end up? Yeah you're almost there. Keep going. Good for you.

1122
03:50:24,100 --> 03:50:34,139
Why aren't I stealing food? Because it's hard to do where I currently am because there's really

1123
03:50:34,139 --> 03:50:40,139
no food to steal. There's one building and that one building is a bar and there's like two pieces

1124
03:50:40,139 --> 03:50:45,000
of bread and there's always somebody there looking at you. This one I just I spent 10

1125
03:50:45,000 --> 03:50:57,209
grand to be part of this place. I don't want to take from this place. So you know. Are you

1126
03:50:57,209 --> 03:51:02,250
eating? Are you eating this? I didn't eat. Did I eat the whole thing before coming over to

1127
03:51:02,250 --> 03:51:14,889
him? Who bought that? Who ate it? Who ate that? Somebody fucking ate that before I brought it to

1128
03:51:14,889 --> 03:51:24,309
the dog. Everybody is so hungry. I have this like box of food that I'm like sneaking around. I

1129
03:51:24,309 --> 03:51:30,360
just got like fucking my pockets ripped open. Well it's all right because Barnabas is almost

1130
03:51:30,360 --> 03:51:39,739
there and we've been going for about five hours. I'm probably gonna stop. I'm probably

1131
03:51:39,739 --> 03:51:45,430
gonna move on to something else in the next like 20 minutes. I want to get this like

1132
03:51:45,430 --> 03:51:57,639
situated though. We'll transition to something else. All right here we are.

1133
03:51:58,280 --> 03:52:07,940
Play the original Fallout. Now I can't go from this to that. No no no no no no no.

1134
03:52:07,940 --> 03:52:19,930
Come here. Show me your wares. All right this meat here I kind of need to buy a lot of this

1135
03:52:19,930 --> 03:52:32,010
for the dog. So just buy it. Don't eat it all. Bread? No. These meat things? No no no no.

1136
03:52:32,010 --> 03:52:39,319
I came here for a very specific... I need building materials. So I need to go to...

1137
03:52:40,440 --> 03:52:55,899
You left your old backpack at the old house. I did. Did I? Did I? Interesting. Which one of

1138
03:52:55,899 --> 03:53:06,979
these is mine? Where the hell is my house? Isn't it that one right there? Small shack. Private.

1139
03:53:08,020 --> 03:53:38,020
Private. Which one of these do I own? Is it this one? Found it. Out of bounds. Leave it

1140
03:53:38,020 --> 03:53:42,979
once. Get the fuck away from me. I'm in my own house now. I picked the wrong house. I'm not

1141
03:53:42,979 --> 03:53:52,899
out of bounds. I'm in my own house. Get out of here. Thank you. Well you leave the door open.

1142
03:53:52,899 --> 03:54:00,940
What do you live in a barn? Okay that leaves me with... Where's the backpack that was in here?

1143
03:54:17,430 --> 03:54:28,889
Like sneaking into the town. They're sneaking into the town. Or sneaking out I'm not sure.

1144
03:54:32,059 --> 03:54:56,920
He's missing a leg. I wonder what happens to these two. What's this guy gonna do? Just watch

1145
03:54:56,920 --> 03:55:09,110
these guys. They are now your new characters. All right are they gonna get out? You think they're

1146
03:55:09,110 --> 03:55:42,219
gonna make it out? Phantom Pain. They actually made it out. Oh my god. Okay. You did it.

1147
03:55:43,770 --> 03:56:27,000
Kill them. It's free experience. I'll take the free experience. Let's just watch the bar go up.

1148
03:56:29,500 --> 03:56:34,860
Seven. Oh my god I thought he had all that food. I was like what the fuck?

1149
03:56:34,860 --> 03:56:56,870
Where's my martial arts? There it is. It's free. This is the leader? Yeah.

1150
03:56:57,510 --> 03:57:10,899
Take out the leader and that's it. You're done. Did I just break my leg? No. Well that was fine.

1151
03:57:10,899 --> 03:57:19,059
All right let's go back in here. I need two building materials. I'm gonna assume I gotta

1152
03:57:19,059 --> 03:57:25,000
get in here. What happened to the other backpack that was in it? Did somebody steal it?

1153
03:57:25,000 --> 03:57:36,760
Did somebody steal that backpack? All right we got I'm gonna need two. I need more than that

1154
03:57:36,760 --> 03:57:44,920
though. I need at least two. Fuck. I can only carry two. I'm probably gonna need like

1155
03:57:45,000 --> 03:58:05,879
iron plates. Save the dog. Whoops. Put a backpack on this guy. What happened? That's

1156
03:58:05,879 --> 03:58:08,040
what I'm asking though. Like what happened to the backpack that I had?

1157
03:58:09,139 --> 03:58:22,620
Did somebody come in my house and take it? No dog don't come all the way across the world.

1158
03:58:22,620 --> 03:58:33,180
I don't know. I don't. Stay there. Just go to the bar. I gotta have a guard in my house so

1159
03:58:33,180 --> 03:58:38,860
somebody did steal it then. All right I'll go to the backpack store and buy a backpack.

1160
03:58:38,860 --> 03:59:12,420
A good one. Where's backpack store? There it is. All right where is this one? This is a

1161
03:59:13,219 --> 03:59:18,899
wooden backpack. That's ones you can stack. So how much is it? It's only 800.

1162
03:59:20,340 --> 03:59:29,979
Buy it. Purchased medium backpack. Now I can buy some more stuff. Give food to the dog.

1163
04:00:00,149 --> 04:00:06,170
He's thinking about... He's thinking about letting it... I'm not thinking about that.

1164
04:00:06,969 --> 04:00:20,459
Just buy a fucking little food cube and it's already almost gone. God damn it. Dog come

1165
04:00:20,459 --> 04:00:39,940
over here. I can't walk this by anybody else. He ate it. Okay. Dog has eaten the rest of the

1166
04:00:39,940 --> 04:00:55,879
food cube. We're good. I'm gonna go back to do this. I got what I wanted. I'm gonna go

1167
04:00:55,879 --> 04:01:01,260
buy a couple more building materials and then I'm gonna come back. And actually I'm

1168
04:01:01,260 --> 04:01:09,350
gonna stop there and save it. Save the game and get out of this game. That's what we're gonna do.

1169
04:01:15,219 --> 04:01:35,299
Where's the... Where the fuck is the... No where is it? It's the one with the... Over here.

1170
04:01:43,129 --> 04:01:50,979
And I'm gonna give you my final thoughts on Kenshi as we sit here for a moment. I think

1171
04:01:50,979 --> 04:01:57,899
it's great. I think it's a lot of fun. I need a couple of these. Three. Just get...

1172
04:01:57,899 --> 04:02:03,190
Stack them up because I'm probably gonna need more. I know I need at least... I need... Yeah

1173
04:02:03,190 --> 04:02:08,569
I'm gonna need like four. Uh but yeah this is the last Kenshi stream you're gonna see

1174
04:02:10,329 --> 04:02:23,850
on the stream. End of Kenshi voice. Wait are you people really asking why? That can't be

1175
04:02:23,850 --> 04:02:36,469
happening in the chat right now. For real? It seems like every time I look over here

1176
04:02:37,639 --> 04:03:05,500
there's like a thousand complaints. One guy. One guy a thousand times. Not more Labo.

1177
04:03:06,889 --> 04:03:15,940
Oh shit no okay no it's not going. I like this game. I think it's fun. But I feel like the

1178
04:03:15,940 --> 04:03:22,709
downtime that the game is designed to have is not sitting well with a lot of people here.

1179
04:03:25,379 --> 04:03:44,459
So I don't know. I feel torn about this. All the people that hated it left. If I actually

1180
04:03:44,459 --> 04:03:51,590
listen to chat then... But that defeats the whole purpose of the game. But isn't the whole

1181
04:03:51,590 --> 04:04:03,540
point of this game to like just do whatever you want? You understand? That's the point of the

1182
04:04:03,540 --> 04:04:33,340
whole game. Don't listen to chat. Just play it all year. No I can't do that. Don't listen to them.

1183
04:04:34,680 --> 04:04:42,409
Well I mean it's kind of hard not to listen when a bunch of people are talking about how

1184
04:04:42,409 --> 04:04:46,090
they don't want this to be on the screen. You know what I mean? It's one thing to be like

1185
04:04:46,090 --> 04:04:51,049
oh forget about chat. Who cares? Well one it's a shitload of you. I mean if it's like

1186
04:04:51,049 --> 04:05:08,709
three people and you know at some point it's like what am I doing here? It was three guys.

1187
04:05:11,979 --> 04:05:29,450
All right so here's what we're gonna do. Do a poll? You played like four games this whole year?

1188
04:05:32,819 --> 04:05:45,819
It's January 8th. There's only been eight days this year. There's only been eight days.

1189
04:05:49,370 --> 04:05:57,850
All right here's what I'm doing. Here's what we're gonna do. I'm the only one that doesn't

1190
04:05:57,850 --> 04:06:10,010
want me to play this. Do I have a different chat? All right here we go. Here's your poll.

1191
04:06:14,459 --> 04:06:19,510
Let me save the game so I don't crash it though. I'm gonna name this.

1192
04:06:20,229 --> 04:06:56,549
Okay that's what I'm gonna name this. So here's your poll. Let's find out for real.

1193
04:07:07,340 --> 04:07:47,479
There you go. 34 guys. Oh Kenchi wins! What's the something else? Naked! I'm gonna get naked.

1194
04:07:47,479 --> 04:08:01,620
Only like three people voted for it. Nobody that didn't like change it at all.

1195
04:08:04,010 --> 04:08:18,040
You should have waited till I told you what the next thing was possible. All right I'm gonna keep

1196
04:08:18,040 --> 04:08:25,799
playing but just don't hear me out. Hear me out. All right hear me out. You know we're

1197
04:08:25,799 --> 04:08:32,760
having like we're just hanging out. We're just chilling. But like when I look over here and

1198
04:08:32,760 --> 04:08:38,040
I just see everybody so angry and annoyed and bored. That's not the kind of stream that I

1199
04:08:38,040 --> 04:08:57,159
want. I don't want that. You know what I mean? Like that's not what I want. I'm sorry if you

1200
04:08:57,159 --> 04:09:17,719
think the game is boring but like uh I don't what am I gonna do? Six more hours and kill! Oh

1201
04:09:17,719 --> 04:09:28,379
that was embarrassingly bad hair. You can't please everyone. I know but that doesn't mean

1202
04:09:28,379 --> 04:09:34,549
that everyone has to be bored. You know I try to make as many people happy as possible

1203
04:09:34,549 --> 04:09:38,840
because I want to have fun streams and if people aren't having fun then like I'm kind

1204
04:09:38,840 --> 04:09:51,479
of doing my job wrong. Right? I wanted to be fun. You know I'm concerned about it. I'm

1205
04:09:51,479 --> 04:10:04,409
concerned about this. It's not out of anger. It's not out of being annoyed or anything. It's

1206
04:10:04,409 --> 04:10:09,379
just I you know I want us I want you guys to have fun. I don't want you guys to be like

1207
04:10:11,510 --> 04:10:17,750
this sucks. You know what I mean? Like that's not that's not my goal. So if I look over

1208
04:10:17,750 --> 04:10:22,229
and I see a bunch of people going like I hate this. It's like well I got I have to think

1209
04:10:22,229 --> 04:10:44,940
about what I want to do. He's a concerned parent. Anyways I'm here's what's gonna happen.

1210
04:10:44,940 --> 04:10:53,690
Okay I know I've said that like three times. We're gonna stay on Kenshi for like another 40

1211
04:10:53,690 --> 04:10:57,770
minutes or so. I want to get to a position where I can move on out. Maybe we'll go on

1212
04:10:57,770 --> 04:11:09,459
one other expedition and we're gonna stop. I'm then going to transition from that. I'm gonna

1213
04:11:09,459 --> 04:11:19,079
play Book of Demons or GeoGuessr for like a couple hours. That's a pretty nice businessman

1214
04:11:19,079 --> 04:11:41,020
voice you got there. Alright so here we go. The last thing I was doing. Here's the last

1215
04:11:41,020 --> 04:11:55,780
thing I was doing. Let's see. I had it saved right? You guys okay you gotta bring the materials

1216
04:11:55,780 --> 04:12:04,809
back. So you go back where you were over here sir to the hub. You got the materials right?

1217
04:12:04,809 --> 04:12:18,200
Yeah yeah I got some food. Let's go. Let's move in the Lego Island waiting room.

1218
04:12:22,840 --> 04:12:29,479
I couldn't even get that fucking game to run. So that leaves the three of you here

1219
04:12:35,459 --> 04:12:43,030
and I'm gonna wait till you get back. Dog's been fed. Kind of just need to wait till you get back

1220
04:12:43,930 --> 04:12:47,049
and then get some food. The three I'm gonna leave canned roth here.

1221
04:12:47,850 --> 04:13:07,530
Whatever I want to go. Come on let go. Make sure. I hope I saved this right here

1222
04:13:07,530 --> 04:13:17,540
just in case he gets fucking. I knew it. Is this a wanderer? Bad guy? Good guy?

1223
04:13:19,559 --> 04:13:29,290
Tech hunter. Does that mean are you a person hunter? No. Alright thank god. Yes we're good.

1224
04:13:35,719 --> 04:13:41,399
Tech hunters are good guys. That's good to know. So in the meantime uh you just go back to what

1225
04:13:41,399 --> 04:13:50,010
you were doing. You were mining over here right at the copper vein which is over here.

1226
04:13:52,969 --> 04:14:06,649
Alright uh iron. Where is copper? Where the hell is it? It's right there. Oh that's like a

1227
04:14:06,649 --> 04:14:12,170
tiny little. That's a tiny one. It was it was that was a is that the one I was just on?

1228
04:14:12,170 --> 04:14:24,200
Have I almost depleted this thing? Alright where are you at? Almost there come on.

1229
04:14:24,200 --> 04:14:36,379
Hurry hurry hurry. Dog status alive. It's good. I almost just fucking poured this on myself.

1230
04:14:36,379 --> 04:14:57,100
My lord. I just almost drank out the other side. Alright build. Add the materials. Let's go.

1231
04:14:57,979 --> 04:15:09,500
Pour it down your shirt. God damn it. Alright hurry up and build this so I can get some

1232
04:15:09,500 --> 04:15:20,840
more food. All of you work together on it please. Almost done almost done almost done almost

1233
04:15:20,840 --> 04:15:23,559
done done done done done done done done done done done done done done done done done.

1234
04:15:24,680 --> 04:15:31,510
Small shack is built. Good. You get in there. And who's the who's the techie here? Oh yeah

1235
04:15:31,510 --> 04:15:45,299
muskets right? Musket in there. Where are you? What the hell are you? What are you doing

1236
04:15:45,299 --> 04:16:01,829
over here? What? What is he doing over here? Didn't I send Barnabas here? He just written

1237
04:16:02,549 --> 04:16:12,709
is he on follow? Did I accidentally click? I think I accidentally clicked on the hub

1238
04:16:12,709 --> 04:16:20,229
or the whatever. Oh my god. Okay well I don't I accidentally did that apparently.

1239
04:16:22,409 --> 04:16:33,930
So let's see if anybody else can build anything. Storage. Copper. Looks pretty good.

1240
04:16:34,649 --> 04:16:47,979
Tilt this again. How do I it's is it like this? Yeah this is so big. This is all that

1241
04:16:47,979 --> 04:17:00,059
can fit in this whole house. Alright what do I need? I need one iron plate through a bigger face

1242
04:17:00,059 --> 04:17:17,350
cam. Hold on give me a sec. Uh-huh. So now you're telling me that I could do mine cell mine cell

1243
04:17:17,350 --> 04:17:32,790
right? This is lagging. I just put a dumpster in my house that's all I did. How much in

1244
04:17:32,790 --> 04:17:55,139
this hole? A hundred. Okay that's alright. So now uh inventory auto haul. I'm assuming

1245
04:17:55,139 --> 04:18:03,690
that's what I need to do. So we're gonna put auto haul as a job right? And then

1246
04:18:04,489 --> 04:18:20,780
should I have this be? Where would he go? Stop stop stop stop. What are you doing?

1247
04:18:21,579 --> 04:18:29,690
So how do I get him to mine and bring it back automatically?

1248
04:18:34,620 --> 04:18:37,659
You put someone on a mining job they'll auto bring the ore back to the storage.

1249
04:18:39,260 --> 04:18:53,540
So this is use right? Operating machine copper resource. What's he doing?

1250
04:18:54,500 --> 04:19:07,139
Is he just doing it now? He's trying to go back now. He only has three. How often does he do that?

1251
04:19:07,860 --> 04:19:13,850
I tried that but for me it only mines one ore and then he goes back.

1252
04:19:14,729 --> 04:19:28,540
So he's only gonna pick up one. I feel like he's gonna wear himself out. He's probably gonna

1253
04:19:28,540 --> 04:19:42,170
mine five. This is kind of far away too. So he'll mine five at a time. How to get him to

1254
04:19:42,170 --> 04:19:48,870
mine a full? I think he needs food too. He's currently not doing terrible. Speaking of food,

1255
04:19:48,870 --> 04:19:54,309
I need to buy it. I need to have it. I guess like somebody was saying you can lure animals

1256
04:19:56,379 --> 04:19:59,899
and pull them back to the gate and have them get killed and then pick up their meat.

1257
04:20:00,620 --> 04:20:11,190
That's kind of a tall tale right now though. Well he's just gonna do that. So keep doing

1258
04:20:11,190 --> 04:20:17,700
that for as long as you can. Speaking of food, frog musky finally made it back.

1259
04:20:18,659 --> 04:20:37,379
This is my favorite stream. Let me tell you something. I'm happy you're watching. I don't

1260
04:20:37,379 --> 04:20:44,540
want you to be bored. I want you to have a good fucking time. So you know it is frustrating

1261
04:20:44,540 --> 04:20:49,819
for me right as the person that's doing the stream to know that a lot of people aren't. So

1262
04:20:49,819 --> 04:20:57,270
you know it's like nothing to do with anybody's personal taste or anything. It's just like damn

1263
04:20:57,270 --> 04:21:10,459
that sucks. He's insecure. No I'm not insecure. I'm broadcasting to twitch.tv. What's the goal

1264
04:21:10,459 --> 04:21:16,979
here? You know the goal is a community of people that watch and we hang out and we play games

1265
04:21:16,979 --> 04:21:24,520
and we do fucked up shit sometimes and we have fun. That's the goal. That's just the goal.

1266
04:21:25,159 --> 04:21:34,040
So I don't want it to be a situation where people are just like this is dumb.

1267
04:21:34,760 --> 04:21:39,959
Now I know a lot a huge amount of you guys didn't say that but a lot of people did and

1268
04:21:40,680 --> 04:21:47,559
not a lot but enough enough for me to notice. It has nothing to do with the game being bad.

1269
04:21:47,559 --> 04:21:50,440
It has to do you know obviously people don't want to watch somebody like mining for

1270
04:21:50,440 --> 04:21:56,579
like an hour and I get it. But you know it's not something that I take lightly. I hope you

1271
04:21:56,579 --> 04:22:09,399
know. That's pretty much it. So is he this three and all right so he is bringing it back

1272
04:22:09,879 --> 04:22:27,799
automatically. Make your face cam only show your eyes. No all right uh dog needs to eat

1273
04:22:27,799 --> 04:22:33,159
now otherwise dog is gonna die. You are doing your thing over here that's good.

1274
04:22:34,120 --> 04:22:39,879
Make sure you have like rooms shit you do. Okay you what the hell are you doing? Give

1275
04:22:39,879 --> 04:22:47,909
that food to that dog. No no no no pick that back up because somebody's gonna eat that off

1276
04:22:47,909 --> 04:23:12,920
the ground. That's not the dog. Dog come here. All right dog is eating. Get some more party

1277
04:23:12,920 --> 04:23:19,719
members and let's let them stay in town. Yeah I need money. I need to like add the the initial

1278
04:23:20,680 --> 04:23:28,860
the initial less than six eight party members is it's hard it's hard to make enough money to

1279
04:23:28,860 --> 04:23:31,899
have more people and make money to get more people and then send them on jobs. It's just

1280
04:23:31,899 --> 04:23:46,260
a slow process. Did he already take it? Okay Kanderoth is doing that job forever. I wonder

1281
04:23:46,260 --> 04:23:54,409
if somebody else should do it too because dog I need food I need to buy I need to okay new area

1282
04:23:54,409 --> 04:24:04,299
let's go. I'm going down here or I will go maybe I'll go to the way station. I have enough money

1283
04:24:04,299 --> 04:24:10,790
where I can buy food there. Dog can come with us he will just be mining until day dies.

1284
04:24:12,379 --> 04:24:22,489
Dog is back on the menu. No let's go over here don't go there to spite chat

1285
04:24:23,450 --> 04:24:26,250
because it's probably a good idea. It's probably actually a good idea.

1286
04:24:27,370 --> 04:24:41,219
You all need to run together though. Here we go. Who's the slowest one here?

1287
04:24:41,780 --> 04:25:02,500
No nobody's that slow. Save it. It almost spilled. All right way station see if I can

1288
04:25:02,500 --> 04:25:09,020
buy some food some supplies maybe. Who has shit on them? Somebody does don't they?

1289
04:25:09,979 --> 04:25:24,440
The operating copper machine good excellent. Where are you guys going?

1290
04:25:25,399 --> 04:25:46,100
Why did you change course like that? That was odd. What am I drinking? It's just coke.

1291
04:25:47,510 --> 04:26:03,850
It's just a coke. I thought that was an animal at first it's not. This is bridge.

1292
04:26:07,799 --> 04:26:16,680
Where does that lead to? What's this? Small copper no don't do it. How close am I to

1293
04:26:16,680 --> 04:27:06,170
the way station? Almost halfway there. 3,600 bucks good getting scary. Almost there. Enable

1294
04:27:06,170 --> 04:27:26,020
monka s. I probably will. I'll probably enable all of them eventually. Wait wait wait. Copper

1295
04:27:26,020 --> 04:27:33,940
I gotta hold on. I'm coming up there. This face cam is too big. There we go that's better.

1296
04:27:47,780 --> 04:28:07,909
Not big enough. How are you doing? Not terribly. Smart maps has been enabled.

1297
04:28:10,709 --> 04:28:37,750
Where are we? All right way station. Who the hell is this? Somebody get left behind. Can you

1298
04:28:37,750 --> 04:29:06,459
walk? We're almost there I promise. Got it. We're good. So where's the way station? Up here?

1299
04:29:07,100 --> 04:29:24,819
This is up like a fucking mountain. All right do I have to do anything weird?

1300
04:29:25,700 --> 04:29:37,270
Who's the group that owns this place? Are these? There's a bed. There's supplies. What about food?

1301
04:29:37,989 --> 04:29:44,969
Is there a place to buy food? I mean is it a bar? There's a bunch of random supplies huh?

1302
04:29:48,760 --> 04:30:00,420
A new buyer. Welcome. Hello. Let's do business. Show me your goods. Okay not literally not every

1303
04:30:00,420 --> 04:30:18,790
single one he has to come over here. You. You go. You solely just go. Cotton. No you

1304
04:30:18,790 --> 04:30:35,420
don't have anything do you? Let's go here. You have some food. Did a big donation come in?

1305
04:30:38,860 --> 04:30:45,260
Oh soup. We had a couple more than ten dollars. No soup for you thanks for the fourteen dollars.

1306
04:30:46,139 --> 04:30:50,489
Thought about giving fifty bucks for this occasion but I need money.

1307
04:30:51,690 --> 04:30:56,170
Don't that's more than enough. Thank you. German I know you love your fans but sometimes

1308
04:30:56,170 --> 04:30:59,610
you have to play the games you love. Many of us will stick around for it. The ones that

1309
04:30:59,610 --> 04:31:05,639
leave that's their own fault. Just please for your own sake don't let chat get to you.

1310
04:31:09,690 --> 04:31:16,459
Thank you. Don't worry about giving me fifty dollars. But there's two sides to that coin

1311
04:31:16,459 --> 04:31:22,659
right? There's do whatever the fuck I want. Whenever the fuck I want because I want to do

1312
04:31:22,659 --> 04:31:27,850
it. But the other side of that is remember you know there's a lot of people that pay

1313
04:31:27,850 --> 04:31:37,770
this stream money and it at the very end of the day I do want people to be happy.

1314
04:31:38,170 --> 04:31:41,850
I do want people that think ah this is not fun. You know what I mean? Like a lot of people

1315
04:31:41,850 --> 04:31:50,489
pay this free money. So there's like and I do agree. I do agree sometimes I am just going to

1316
04:31:50,489 --> 04:31:59,620
do whatever I want to do. But it's it's a weird balance that I think it is hard to do

1317
04:32:00,180 --> 04:32:13,690
in my personal opinion because I do want people to not be bored. I want people to have fun.

1318
04:32:13,690 --> 04:32:16,409
Do I not like this game? No I love this game. I think this game is great.

1319
04:32:17,290 --> 04:32:25,670
All right so with that being said Dry Ski also gave ten dollars.

1320
04:32:33,350 --> 04:32:43,579
Thank you for the ten bucks and thanks for the message. Appreciate that.

1321
04:32:44,889 --> 04:32:50,860
So did you just hear that like there's uh there's people in here.

1322
04:33:04,090 --> 04:33:06,169
I'm also looking to hire you. What do you think?

1323
04:33:15,779 --> 04:33:25,909
I don't have I don't have enough to do that right now. Uh who is even in here?

1324
04:33:28,779 --> 04:33:34,310
There's so many people in here. Mercenary captain. That's not something that's going

1325
04:33:34,310 --> 04:33:43,849
to be like 10 grand per day. Flash box. Looking to hire some bodyguards. I need

1326
04:33:43,849 --> 04:33:50,709
some mercenaries to guard my outpost. Two thousand per day. I can't afford that right

1327
04:33:50,709 --> 04:34:00,279
now. Peace. Looking for someone to join together with. Maybe. But who are you?

1328
04:34:00,279 --> 04:34:06,840
Just a nobody looking for like-minded people to band up with. Uh okay I'll join you. How much?

1329
04:34:06,840 --> 04:34:10,840
Three thousand cats. So there are two people in here that I can get the three thousand.

1330
04:34:11,479 --> 04:34:29,860
Plastic surgeon. Traders. Guild pacifier. Rin. Okay let's talk to Rin. Now looking to join

1331
04:34:31,060 --> 04:34:34,180
not much to tell. The city is getting pretty chaotic these days so I decided to

1332
04:34:34,180 --> 04:34:43,560
band up to find myself a new life. How much charging? Three thousand. Why not join for free?

1333
04:34:44,200 --> 04:34:49,459
Of course don't want you leaving me stranded and butt naked in the sands now do I? Give me some

1334
04:34:49,459 --> 04:34:56,229
value so I know I'm not just disposable fresh labor meat. Well this is apparently where you

1335
04:34:56,229 --> 04:35:01,590
go to hire a million people. Here to buy? Let's do business. What do you got? All right

1336
04:35:01,590 --> 04:35:09,180
thank god. You got a lot of food. That's exactly what I'm looking for. Let's get some

1337
04:35:09,180 --> 04:35:17,619
of these. The food cubes are great. That's all I can really afford but I have people to eat.

1338
04:35:18,500 --> 04:35:28,180
Can I get one another one? I can't afford another one. I do have enough. I should be okay now. Now

1339
04:35:28,180 --> 04:35:38,540
we got food. At least enough to survive. I can put the dog down. I might steal some

1340
04:35:38,540 --> 04:35:50,200
shit from here as well. It might be time to steal if you know what I mean. What's in here?

1341
04:35:52,119 --> 04:35:58,360
Wooden bowl, building material, fabrics, gears, fuel, but upstairs. What do you got upstairs?

1342
04:36:11,720 --> 04:36:22,549
Well it's not entirely true. This is a this is like this is a material bin. Storage or

1343
04:36:23,270 --> 04:36:42,099
hold on. Got nothing in there man. Not worth it. Holy shit that's a lot. Chain mail sheets.

1344
04:36:45,209 --> 04:37:02,279
Average price 2,500. 32% chance? That's a lot of money. The preemptive safe scum. Yeah I had to.

1345
04:37:04,310 --> 04:37:08,950
Five community subs from beer. Me a username. Thanks again for the community subs. A lot of

1346
04:37:08,950 --> 04:37:17,639
them tonight. You've done it before. You did it earlier. Thank you. Wait for this to load. 32%

1347
04:37:17,639 --> 04:37:20,520
might not be worth doing this over and over again but maybe it is. It's a lot of money.

1348
04:37:23,259 --> 04:37:35,540
I don't know. It probably it's probably not. It's probably not worth doing. Speaking of

1349
04:37:35,540 --> 04:37:44,340
money. How's shit going over here? How are you doing as a person? You need some food don't you?

1350
04:37:44,340 --> 04:37:54,790
Oh my goodness. Storage box. About to head back. How much is in the box?

1351
04:37:56,389 --> 04:38:02,900
Let me just see how much is in there because I'm gonna sell it. What do you got? Five yet?

1352
04:38:02,900 --> 04:38:08,259
Oh just pick up. Pick up one two three four five. Head back because I can't even look

1353
04:38:08,259 --> 04:38:32,680
in there. Time to sell the copper. Hurry hurry. 17. That's pretty good. Let's cash it in. Why not?

1354
04:38:38,380 --> 04:38:53,060
Oh what's happening here? Um what's going on? Okay sell it and then go back to what you were

1355
04:38:53,060 --> 04:39:00,630
doing. Dog's dead? No dog's eating. He's currently eating. Now I just gotta go sell

1356
04:39:00,630 --> 04:39:07,340
this at what is what are they doing in here? Oh my god is this free meat? This is gonna be

1357
04:39:07,340 --> 04:39:12,950
free meat. Uh how do I how do I get free meat? This is meat. They just wandered into the town.

1358
04:39:13,669 --> 04:39:27,500
What a godsend. Free meat. I can't kill them by myself. This is gonna sound the alarms or

1359
04:39:27,500 --> 04:40:00,619
something right? Help me help help help me. Run away. Thank you. Oh yeah beautiful. All right

1360
04:40:00,619 --> 04:40:27,750
now take the meat while they're fighting. That's food for a goddamn whole winter. That's

1361
04:40:27,750 --> 04:40:35,270
food for an entire winter. Yes. Oh my god that's so much food and the pelts are worth so much money.

1362
04:40:35,909 --> 04:40:44,169
All right I need to heal myself. I don't have a med kit. What's around my body?

1363
04:40:44,810 --> 04:40:51,319
What's around my arm? Am I holding holding my head? Okay I got a lot of stuff to sell and

1364
04:40:51,319 --> 04:41:12,540
shit. Wait okay I'm just gonna panic attack. Let's go. That was perfect. They just waltzed

1365
04:41:12,540 --> 04:41:18,259
right into the town. Oh my god I couldn't have asked for something better than that.

1366
04:41:18,259 --> 04:41:27,290
Put the camera in the top right corner. Uh I will just give me one second. What am I not

1367
04:41:27,290 --> 04:42:06,259
taking the ore out of the container? I thought I did. Uh am I going crazy? Am I am I doing this

1368
04:42:06,259 --> 04:42:24,139
right? What am I doing is wrong? It was weird. I guess maybe because he was doing the return.

1369
04:42:24,860 --> 04:42:35,159
All right I'm gonna sell all the pelts. I'm gonna cook all the meat and then I've got an

1370
04:42:35,159 --> 04:42:44,169
expedition. These pelts are worth 200 each. Should I save any of these or should I just get

1371
04:42:44,169 --> 04:42:53,060
fucking rid of all of them? I can turn them into leather but maybe it's not worth it.

1372
04:42:53,060 --> 04:43:04,250
5500. I've got a bunch of meat that I'm gonna cook in the fire. Didn't miss any meat right?

1373
04:43:05,209 --> 04:43:09,130
That was so lucky. I can't believe. I can't fucking believe that happened.

1374
04:43:11,349 --> 04:43:15,669
They just waltzed right in here and it was just free food for at least a week.

1375
04:43:16,389 --> 04:43:26,939
Does the food not go bad? Well I have to make sure I cook it. I don't know does it?

1376
04:43:27,740 --> 04:43:40,919
I do need some med kits. Three of them heal my broken head because you know I need to.

1377
04:43:43,779 --> 04:43:47,619
And then go back to mining. Well I'll actually cook this shit first

1378
04:43:48,919 --> 04:43:57,340
because does it go bad? Uncooked meat from some dead animal probably. Possibly edible.

1379
04:43:58,060 --> 04:44:03,779
Possibly edible. Dried meat does not rot. That's good to know.

1380
04:44:05,080 --> 04:44:15,619
Did I heal enough? I think I did. Yeah apparently I did. All right so now I need to cook this shit

1381
04:44:16,180 --> 04:44:32,459
in a fire. Is it gonna burn my house down? All right am I all right? I look tired.

1382
04:44:34,709 --> 04:44:53,659
Um I don't think so. Maybe a little maybe a little bit. Oh a little baby tired boy.

1383
04:44:54,459 --> 04:44:59,860
All right you're gonna you'll do this for a little while so that's fine. I'll check

1384
04:44:59,860 --> 04:45:04,889
back on you in a minute. Dog is still eating. That's good. You're up here you're

1385
04:45:04,889 --> 04:45:14,700
gonna go down and I want you up there when the night falls. Let's save it. Save game.

1386
04:45:28,279 --> 04:45:37,930
So what the fuck do I want to do now? I need to look for some veins that are close by.

1387
04:45:37,930 --> 04:45:41,290
Even if it's iron it's probably is it worth is it even worth collecting iron?

1388
04:45:42,090 --> 04:45:55,500
How much does it sell for? I can't. Depends on the zone.

1389
04:45:59,779 --> 04:46:10,459
The warning? Not if you start building a base. How much longer will I be streaming for?

1390
04:46:11,419 --> 04:46:14,220
Oh well because I decided I was gonna just stick with Kenshi.

1391
04:46:15,580 --> 04:46:19,099
It's been about six hours. Probably not that much longer.

1392
04:46:19,659 --> 04:46:27,830
Probably maybe like another hour or two I would say. And then I'm going to stream on Thursday.

1393
04:46:28,630 --> 04:46:32,549
I'm gonna go Thursday and Friday because I'll get 700,000 games on Thursday.

1394
04:46:33,270 --> 04:46:38,299
And then uh the um I probably shouldn't say that yet.

1395
04:46:39,020 --> 04:46:47,799
12 hours you should start just doing 12 hour streams every other day. I think my health would

1396
04:46:47,799 --> 04:46:56,500
decline. Yeah there's 700,000 games too came out and I got it. It's gonna be here on Thursday

1397
04:46:56,500 --> 04:46:59,689
so that's what we're gonna do on Thursday. And then we're gonna go Thursday and Friday.

1398
04:47:00,250 --> 04:47:07,060
So we'll do two days in a row after tomorrow. Uh how's that food doing?

1399
04:47:13,740 --> 04:47:16,459
Oh shit I'm eating it right okay well of course I am. It's food.

1400
04:47:17,180 --> 04:47:25,860
Is it gonna automatically put this in here? No I gotta I gotta do it manually I think.

1401
04:47:25,860 --> 04:47:40,630
Maybe I can just do this right on a halt. Uh it'll just keep going. I need what do I need to do?

1402
04:47:46,040 --> 04:47:50,680
Stream 24 7 for a week and then retire. I wouldn't be able to even stay up that long.

1403
04:47:51,720 --> 04:48:03,290
Let's go this way. What is what what people are freaking out for what?

1404
04:48:03,930 --> 04:48:10,229
That guy's sprinting around like a psycho. All right let's see uh personnel check.

1405
04:48:11,340 --> 04:48:20,299
5200 food is over here. He's cooking it all. Empty backpacks. Some food on

1406
04:48:21,099 --> 04:48:30,250
Barnabas. Actually quite a lot. The dog is still eating. That's good. I'm trying to think of

1407
04:48:30,250 --> 04:48:42,470
what else. I should probably check the other building here. So let's do that because I

1408
04:48:42,470 --> 04:48:50,860
went in this one. Did I go in? At least that's the only two that are here. Cool outpost.

1409
04:48:52,630 --> 04:49:02,740
I think I might want to go. I need to go get that food. I need that food from the hub and

1410
04:49:02,740 --> 04:49:11,060
then they need to go down because I want to keep him there mining. So we kind of have to go back

1411
04:49:11,860 --> 04:49:20,139
unless I can find something to fight. Great Canadian fuck club. Five community subs.

1412
04:49:21,340 --> 04:49:30,569
Thank you. More community subs. You guys are fucking awesome. Thanks. Five five five ten.

1413
04:49:31,369 --> 04:49:38,970
That's a lot. Thank you guys. Seriously. Every time he reads the username.

1414
04:49:42,220 --> 04:49:49,720
Well is it time to make my own damn town? Not yet probably. I need like another couple people.

1415
04:49:50,360 --> 04:50:00,389
Give it a total of 300 subs. 300 subs? That's uh that's fucking crazy.

1416
04:50:03,400 --> 04:50:15,939
You need more people and more money. Making your own town as a grind. I could probably

1417
04:50:15,939 --> 04:50:20,729
imagine. I'm trying to think of where I want to go from here. I just have to go back to the hub.

1418
04:50:21,610 --> 04:50:25,880
We got some food. We have some resources now. Now I'm going to take

1419
04:50:27,209 --> 04:50:31,930
the troop. Deck them out with food. Deck them out with resources and shit and we're going

1420
04:50:31,930 --> 04:50:48,360
to go down. These are slavers. I don't think my band of idiots can defeat them. Although it's

1421
04:50:48,439 --> 04:50:58,779
minus 12. Hold on a minute here. This number right here. 12 and then minus 13.

1422
04:51:00,970 --> 04:51:07,369
This number is what it is. It currently is now. That is with the minus 13 on it already.

1423
04:51:07,369 --> 04:51:18,790
Included. I just need to triple check that. So I am not going to go fuck with them. I'm

1424
04:51:18,790 --> 04:51:27,959
going to get my ass kicked. There's too many of them. Go this way if you will. So you

1425
04:51:27,959 --> 04:51:39,099
don't cross the path of all these dudes. Holy military base. I haven't looked at that yet

1426
04:51:39,099 --> 04:51:43,430
though. You guys are going to get on get off the road so I can walk on it.

1427
04:51:47,509 --> 04:52:09,959
How you doing? You still cooking food? Yes you are. Keep it cooking good. Dog is fine right?

1428
04:52:09,959 --> 04:52:24,759
Yeah. I want to get fucked over there. All right go. Just shift click it and automate it.

1429
04:52:25,720 --> 04:52:41,020
Hold on what the fuck is this? Escaped servant. Two six nine

1430
04:52:48,330 --> 04:52:58,380
three. Why do you all suck so much? From what what's happening here? Weather penalty.

1431
04:52:59,020 --> 04:53:16,299
That's this fucking weather. So they're not hostile right? State normal. This this should

1432
04:53:16,299 --> 04:53:24,540
be I should be able to walk right by them. I'm not going to cause a problem if you guys

1433
04:53:24,619 --> 04:53:27,099
don't cross don't cause a problem with me. I won't cause a problem with you.

1434
04:53:27,819 --> 04:53:42,250
In fact yeah that's fine. Recruit? I don't have an option to. I don't have mods installed right

1435
04:53:42,250 --> 04:53:58,389
now. I'm just going to playing the base game for a little while. All right so the hub. There

1436
04:53:58,389 --> 04:54:12,250
it is. I made it home. We're here. We did it. No we didn't. That's the military base. Might

1437
04:54:12,250 --> 04:54:25,830
as well take a look. All right let's auto haul this. Let me get a chance. I have so much fucking

1438
04:54:25,830 --> 04:54:42,310
food. Auto haul right? There we go. Where's the dog? Where's the dog? What are you doing back here

1439
04:54:42,310 --> 04:55:00,779
dog? Let's go. All right this is all destroyed. Why is this place destroyed? There's nothing here.

1440
04:55:00,779 --> 04:55:11,240
There's a ninja blade in here. Flesh cleaver. Mercenary club. What is all this stuff?

1441
04:55:12,040 --> 04:55:24,869
How do I get in there? Holy shit. Are you kidding me? Well that's fucking awesome.

1442
04:55:27,110 --> 04:55:36,090
Oh my god this is all free stuff. This is ridiculous. There's nobody. There's nothing

1443
04:55:36,090 --> 04:55:54,220
here. Can I fix this place up? Damn. All right well get to it then. You're the one

1444
04:55:54,220 --> 04:56:04,630
with the backpack. Iron plates. Long cleaver. I mean that's not that great but still it's

1445
04:56:04,630 --> 04:56:13,900
free. Ninja blade. Oh that's outside. All right hold on. Iron plates. Horse chopper.

1446
04:56:14,540 --> 04:56:32,409
What about stuff I can open? Go check out that ninja blade. Damage versus humans.

1447
04:56:33,610 --> 04:56:44,709
Attack bonus plus two. I mean it's all right. Cleaver. You can just sell them. This is not

1448
04:56:44,709 --> 04:56:53,180
technically stealing. It was just on the ground and nobody wants it right? Something like

1449
04:56:53,180 --> 04:57:04,889
that. Any other boxes to open? Look at this. Are you kidding me? Damn. How much does it even

1450
04:57:04,889 --> 04:57:13,740
sell for? 113? I mean that's not great but that's not terrible. How many are you just

1451
04:57:13,740 --> 04:57:39,349
gonna pick up? That's a lot. Well now I know why it's free. Because it kind of sucks.

1452
04:57:40,389 --> 04:57:49,450
Mercenary club. People could just load up and put that up. Iron stick. Worthless.

1453
04:57:50,409 --> 04:58:08,020
That's not terrible. Welcome to the mercenary club. Never do it for free. Ever. Unless there's

1454
04:58:08,020 --> 04:58:13,240
something I'm missing here. These aren't really that great. I kind of had a moment there.

1455
04:58:13,959 --> 04:58:21,779
There's no other tools or anything. I can tell. These really just kind of suck.

1456
04:58:22,500 --> 04:58:35,610
These sell for... I'm gonna get 99. 24. 84. 387. That's not bad. 197 is not bad. I might

1457
04:58:35,610 --> 04:58:45,560
as well just put this up here. That was weird. The storage purposes just hold on to it.

1458
04:58:46,360 --> 04:58:56,549
20 iron stick. Horse and mercenary. No. I think I'm gonna leave it all. Flesh cleaver.

1459
04:58:56,549 --> 04:59:18,840
Long cleaver. 93. 86. Well that's not good. I mean I guess just... I'm going back anyways.

1460
04:59:18,840 --> 04:59:37,419
Does everybody pick something up? It's free anyways. 19 attack. Not worth it. I'll get

1461
04:59:37,419 --> 04:59:45,740
my ass kicked. Somebody will get hurt and die. You fool. Where the hell are you? Get over here

1462
04:59:45,740 --> 04:59:59,740
man. You can't pick that up. Why the hell can't you? What do you mean you can't pick

1463
04:59:59,740 --> 05:00:17,610
that up? You stand right in front of it. Too long? Too long. All right. Everybody has a bunch

1464
05:00:17,610 --> 05:00:34,310
except for you. You need to actually keep that on. Get another stick. Let's go. Everybody has

1465
05:00:34,310 --> 05:00:49,959
their pockets full. You can head back to the hut. Make a fat 1.5k. Something like that,

1466
05:00:49,959 --> 05:01:20,540
yeah? So let's get together again and... minus three. Minus two. Minus five. Minus five.

1467
05:01:21,500 --> 05:01:29,590
Minus four. Minus six. Minus five. Minus six. Minus three. Minus two. Minus five.

1468
05:01:31,029 --> 05:01:48,740
Minus two. Seven. Isn't he better with unarmed? Four. Yeah he's better with unarmed.

1469
05:01:49,459 --> 05:02:20,740
Dogs here. Two with fifteen. I gotta get rid of this stuff. I gotta put it on the ground for

1470
05:02:20,740 --> 05:02:28,630
now. Where is everybody? Get back inside. Throw all this shit on the ground for now.

1471
05:02:29,750 --> 05:02:45,110
Because this is a fight here that I have to fucking win. Okay. Is it ten? What about you?

1472
05:02:45,750 --> 05:02:54,970
Doesn't matter. You? Drop. I gotta drop it? I have to. Otherwise I'm gonna die.

1473
05:02:56,009 --> 05:03:24,330
Really matter does it? Dog is fifteen. Ten. Oh they're all so weak. They're all doing

1474
05:03:24,330 --> 05:03:30,310
minus five. I can't get in there and just fucking destroy them. Dog is malnourished.

1475
05:03:30,310 --> 05:03:42,099
Not starving. We're good. Eight and fifteen. There's just so many of them.

1476
05:03:43,459 --> 05:03:55,419
Got one, two, three, four, five. How much do I have? I would have a heels.

1477
05:03:56,299 --> 05:04:03,560
Not very much. What's lowering my attack? It's the weather. There's like a weather

1478
05:04:03,560 --> 05:04:09,799
problem here. Equipment. This. It's like isn't there a weather penalty going on right

1479
05:04:09,799 --> 05:04:16,200
now? Because I don't have any like dust protection. Minus nine. Weather penalty.

1480
05:04:18,810 --> 05:04:24,139
Defense. What do they have for defense? Six. They have much more defense. It's probably not a

1481
05:04:24,139 --> 05:04:30,950
good idea. All right. I'm probably too bad I just threw everything on the fucking ground.

1482
05:04:30,950 --> 05:04:37,659
That's great. It wouldn't have worth that much money anyways. I'm going to save it

1483
05:04:37,659 --> 05:04:40,380
here and just see what happens if I could fight them. I'm just going to go for it.

1484
05:04:41,340 --> 05:05:06,700
Everybody get together over here. Just bring them in. Bring them inside. Okay. Jesus. Look

1485
05:05:06,700 --> 05:05:32,970
at this fucking mess. Let's go. We just got destroyed. There's too many. I just got my ass

1486
05:05:32,970 --> 05:05:45,209
kicked. That wasn't even a contest. This is too many. It didn't matter how much attack they

1487
05:05:45,209 --> 05:05:53,560
had. I mean there's fifteen of them. We're gonna have to run because they'll just take

1488
05:05:53,639 --> 05:06:03,029
everything I have. How much food do I have? That's the real question. The food. Actually

1489
05:06:03,029 --> 05:06:13,340
the food. That's a lot of food. These things are like six hundred bucks. They're gonna eat

1490
05:06:13,340 --> 05:06:39,189
the dog and shit. Let's try to get away. See if I can get out. No they might not even.

1491
05:06:39,189 --> 05:07:09,189
They might not be here. Dog turned into a food cube. No they're here. All right.

1492
05:07:10,409 --> 05:07:19,349
I mean the question is can we run? Look at how close I am. I might be able to just bait

1493
05:07:19,349 --> 05:07:28,459
them over here. If everybody's in a full sprint, go for it. Sneak away. It's too

1494
05:07:28,459 --> 05:07:35,930
late. I think they are running right at her right now. I think. Go! Okay. Apparently

1495
05:07:35,930 --> 05:07:43,099
no one's running. Why is that exactly? What happened there? I have everybody selected.

1496
05:07:49,240 --> 05:08:46,599
What? Okay. Pick that shit back up then. I'll take it. Let's go. Back to town. How

1497
05:08:46,599 --> 05:09:00,659
come none of you listen when I do that? All together now. Wait for...

1498
05:09:02,580 --> 05:09:10,220
Oh yeah. You're over encumbered. Ah yeah. Forget it. It's not worth that much money.

1499
05:09:15,720 --> 05:09:29,340
Hub. And everybody go. What's going on? I can't run. So once we get back to this town,

1500
05:09:29,979 --> 05:09:38,970
I'm probably going to call it for the night. I'm getting hungry. I need some food. I need

1501
05:09:38,970 --> 05:09:52,419
to go check on some things. Bad path. It probably is bad pathing. End it with karaoke.

1502
05:09:52,419 --> 05:09:59,560
No. I'm kind of drained at the moment. I can't do karaoke six plus hours into a stream.

1503
05:09:59,560 --> 05:10:10,889
Not right now. No geoguessert. We can... You know probably when I get 700,000 games in the

1504
05:10:10,889 --> 05:10:17,979
mail then we're going to... Maybe we'll just warm up with that and then play that on Thursday.

1505
05:10:18,779 --> 05:10:25,860
The way my facial hair sits on my cheeks makes me look malnourished.

1506
05:10:26,659 --> 05:10:30,700
I have to shave anyways. Thanks for the reminder. I need to do that.

1507
05:10:34,889 --> 05:10:47,830
The hub. Let's get in here and make sure we're safe. Monsters right now or something. Just

1508
05:10:47,830 --> 05:11:24,779
watch. Now I can't unsee it. It's all right. I'm well fed. We're safe. Everybody inside.

1509
05:11:25,580 --> 05:11:37,860
Everybody in? There's tons of food over here too right? Let me just check. Well that's a lot

1510
05:11:37,860 --> 05:11:45,860
of meat. Food will be cooking. People get to eat. That's good. Everyone's safe and sound.

1511
05:11:46,500 --> 05:11:54,659
Oh I'm gonna like burp. But that's gonna conclude the stream for tonight. We'll do the

1512
05:11:54,659 --> 05:12:02,220
bits and the subs too. About seven hours. It was kind of a wild one tonight. We started

1513
05:12:02,220 --> 05:12:08,860
with some extreme stuff and moved on to a chill stream and now I'm going to get some food.

1514
05:12:11,509 --> 05:12:15,509
Maintaining a beard can be difficult. Oh yeah. I can't grow a beard.

1515
05:12:15,509 --> 05:12:22,040
Facial hair does not grow here. It does not grow here. I get like a really sporadic

1516
05:12:22,040 --> 05:12:29,479
shitty beard here, here, and then like here. I don't grow any facial hair here. It's strange.

1517
05:12:31,180 --> 05:12:38,419
It's very strange. But thanks for sticking around. I'll see you guys not tomorrow.

1518
05:12:40,020 --> 05:12:52,119
I'll give you the tentative plan here. So tomorrow I have a few obligations. Human

1519
05:12:52,119 --> 05:12:58,180
obligations right? Thursday 700,000 games part two comes in so it's gonna be fun.

1520
05:13:01,430 --> 05:13:08,119
Knees never coming back. No I am. What's going on here? Itchy? And then Friday I'm

1521
05:13:08,119 --> 05:13:16,700
gonna probably try to plug in the Dreamcast. It's been a long goddamn time. So much love to

1522
05:13:16,700 --> 05:13:24,490
you if you take it off. See you on Thursday. Take care of yourselves. And I'm gonna disappear

1523
05:13:24,490 --> 05:13:30,950
from the camera. I'll give you a last final wave. See ya. I'll see you guys on Thursday.

1524
05:13:30,950 --> 05:13:34,790
Oh why? Okay hold on, hold on. Slow down, slow down. Where are you going? What are you

1525
05:13:34,790 --> 05:13:49,979
doing? Stop it. Please. And there's the outro. There it is. I like the game. I think it's

1526
05:13:49,979 --> 05:13:58,470
fun. I think it's an interesting experience. Just takes a while to get going and that's kind

1527
05:13:58,470 --> 05:14:08,389
of the way it is. With that being said I'll see you later. Let's go back a while ago for the

1528
05:14:08,389 --> 05:14:22,580
bits. Starting back here. Hey chicken foot thanks for the five dollars chicken foot. Hey Jeremy

1529
05:14:22,580 --> 05:14:26,099
I showed my 60 year old mother your videos and she loved them. My family also watched

1530
05:14:26,099 --> 05:14:30,740
your Christmas and New Year streams together and also I made this. YouTube was broken for me

1531
05:14:30,740 --> 05:14:46,860
so I uploaded it to streamable. Resident Evil? Resident Evil 4? I have only one very important

1532
05:14:46,860 --> 05:14:56,139
question. Do you eat ass? There's the link for those of you that'd like to see it.

1533
05:14:57,240 --> 05:15:03,080
Thank you chicken foot. I'm glad your mother likes the videos. Lazy Luke thanks for the

1534
05:15:03,080 --> 05:15:06,759
one dollar. What is something in your life now that you weren't you wouldn't have believed

1535
05:15:06,759 --> 05:15:17,139
five years ago? Besides your fans saving over 60,000 seagulls. Something I didn't

1536
05:15:17,139 --> 05:15:21,540
think was this streaming on like Twitch. I never thought this would ever be possible.

1537
05:15:25,430 --> 05:15:33,979
So this is you know impossible. What is playing right now? Oh that. But thank you Lazy Luke.

1538
05:15:33,979 --> 05:15:38,459
Thank you binary man for the five dollars. Hey Jeremy here's the thing that I think chat might

1539
05:15:38,459 --> 05:15:44,459
like. By the way I did make the stupid musical gnome song thing in FL studio. That thing you

1540
05:15:44,459 --> 05:15:55,349
have never mentioned definitely never told us you would stream. What's this? Spider-Man?

1541
05:15:56,150 --> 05:16:18,310
Is the guy throwing a dynamite out of a window in a Spider-Man video?

1542
05:16:23,860 --> 05:16:35,340
It's called oh uh whatever owo. Thank you binary man for five dollars. Hey Divus thanks

1543
05:16:35,340 --> 05:16:41,979
for three dollars. Drummage door. Drummage door thanks for the one dollar. Why are you

1544
05:16:41,979 --> 05:16:46,060
gonna play me like this man? You kind of hinted you check out Lisa but in viscera

1545
05:16:46,060 --> 05:16:52,900
stream you didn't even know that game. Um that's probably just messing around. I've

1546
05:16:52,900 --> 05:16:59,369
heard Lisa a thousand times. I was probably just kidding that I like never didn't know

1547
05:16:59,369 --> 05:17:19,880
what it was or something. Bart. I want to sample Jeremy saying thank you Divus and use it as a

1548
05:17:19,880 --> 05:17:29,619
tag. You give three dollars every single stream man. Thank you. Darkstar thanks for

1549
05:17:29,619 --> 05:17:36,740
the one dollar. You're a handsome motherfucker you know that. I think sometimes you know you

1550
05:17:36,740 --> 05:17:41,220
look in the mirror and you go I look okay. Sometimes you go maybe not so maybe not so

1551
05:17:41,220 --> 05:17:53,590
much today. But thank you. Appreciate it. Jornhorn thanks for the one dollar. Jerma

1552
05:17:53,590 --> 05:17:58,869
it's Jake from the video game accreditation agency. Your gamer license is about to expire.

1553
05:17:59,430 --> 05:18:12,330
Please complete the chips challenge level blob net to renew it. I don't even know what that

1554
05:18:12,330 --> 05:18:20,580
is. Crypt world thanks for the five dollars. Crypt world play your automaton. I want to

1555
05:18:20,580 --> 05:18:24,740
see some of your gifts you haven't used yet. Oh that's right I do that. That's true.

1556
05:18:25,459 --> 05:18:29,830
That's true I do have that. I do kind of I could break that out.

1557
05:18:29,830 --> 05:18:36,979
Thanks for the reminder. L on a you knee thanks for the one dollar.

1558
05:18:39,700 --> 05:18:46,979
Thank you. E dragon thanks for the one dollar. Darkstar thanks for the one dollar. By the way

1559
05:18:46,979 --> 05:18:52,700
it's been six months since I last changed my name. Any suggestions? As it is now most

1560
05:18:52,700 --> 05:18:58,380
streamers give up after Darkstar because they don't want to read a big number. Well think

1561
05:18:58,380 --> 05:19:05,909
about 700,000 games. It's 700,000 games. It's seven syllables. So you got Darkstar

1562
05:19:06,630 --> 05:19:17,750
700,000 games. So it's it's a it's a lot of syllables. Darkstar 700 it's it's it's

1563
05:19:17,750 --> 05:19:32,970
number 700. 700. Darkstar 7. Darkstar 700. Darkstar 70. But uh speaking of your name

1564
05:19:33,689 --> 05:19:40,779
that should be a very interesting stream on Thursday. Suggestions for your name?

1565
05:19:41,740 --> 05:19:53,849
I don't know. You want to keep the Darkstar apart? There's two years worth of content on there.

1566
05:19:54,810 --> 05:20:03,979
I'm sure we'll blow through it all in about four hours. But thanks a lot. I don't really know

1567
05:20:03,979 --> 05:20:14,380
what to yeah I keep keep your name the way it is. I think it's just fine. Jerma still short

1568
05:20:14,380 --> 05:20:21,959
ha ha ha ha one dollar they say five foot one. I mean your name just certainly you know

1569
05:20:22,040 --> 05:20:29,990
there it is. Jerma still short. I mean when was I supposed to be taller at some point?

1570
05:20:29,990 --> 05:20:40,950
How can I still be short? I didn't plan on getting any taller. But thank you for the

1571
05:20:40,950 --> 05:20:44,389
one dollar. Thank you Alec for the one dollar. Try not to use a face cam for like three months

1572
05:20:44,389 --> 05:20:50,549
and don't shave so that one day you'll turn it on and have a full beard. Oh it would look

1573
05:20:50,549 --> 05:20:56,729
bad. I could I try I can't. As long as it's ever been is really in October.

1574
05:20:57,529 --> 05:21:08,619
With the balloon thing. I can't do it. It doesn't grow. It just kind of spreads out strangely.

1575
05:21:12,180 --> 05:21:16,740
Hey Jess homeboy. Thanks for the one dollar. I'm still working on that painting. Sorry it's taken

1576
05:21:16,740 --> 05:21:23,049
so long. The beard looks good. Do you still main Pac-Man and Ultimate even though he sucks real

1577
05:21:23,049 --> 05:21:30,729
bad? Um I don't really play Ultimate. I had a realization when I played Ultimate that I

1578
05:21:31,689 --> 05:21:40,090
I just can't do it. It's very hard to get good at a fighting game. You have to put a lot of

1579
05:21:40,090 --> 05:21:47,209
time into it and getting dunked on by people in like 2v2s when me and it's Alex are playing

1580
05:21:47,209 --> 05:22:01,770
is just like holy shit. I ain't gonna be able to do this. It's still a fun game.

1581
05:22:02,569 --> 05:22:13,669
Still an interesting game. Still fun to play. Smash is still easier than something like

1582
05:22:13,750 --> 05:22:20,259
Street Fighter. Oh boy I could never ever. Not in a million years would I be able to handle that.

1583
05:22:27,020 --> 05:22:32,540
But thank you to Drummage Door again for the one dollar. Also to add up to that Lisa painful

1584
05:22:32,540 --> 05:22:37,099
RPG donation. I want to underline that these bits are basically my last money from my bank

1585
05:22:37,099 --> 05:22:41,959
account. But if you'd play that game the entertainment value would be worth it. You're

1586
05:22:41,959 --> 05:22:46,360
the funniest guy I know especially after super best friends split up. Greetings from Finland

1587
05:22:46,360 --> 05:22:54,139
love you man. Well thank you for the one dollar but I hope you take care of yourself.

1588
05:22:54,939 --> 05:23:03,110
Don't worry about me. And to kind of give a very very clear answer and I don't

1589
05:23:03,830 --> 05:23:08,630
the thing about games and recommendations and things that people want me to play or things

1590
05:23:08,630 --> 05:23:15,180
that I should play. It really just comes down to maybe one day I would maybe one day I won't.

1591
05:23:15,900 --> 05:23:21,299
I don't really I don't really have a necessarily like a day to day this is

1592
05:23:21,299 --> 05:23:23,779
the game I'm going to play. This is the game I'm going to play next. This is a game to play

1593
05:23:23,779 --> 05:23:27,459
after that. Usually it's like a week to week basis when I'm trying to figure out what I

1594
05:23:27,459 --> 05:23:34,979
want to do. So I don't really have a plan to play like Lisa for instance. I'm sure maybe at

1595
05:23:34,979 --> 05:23:39,139
some point like earlier today I was thinking about doing the Obra Dinn. It was like what I

1596
05:23:39,139 --> 05:23:43,779
want to do today Kenshi or just fuck around in IRL and it was kind of just a stream

1597
05:23:43,779 --> 05:23:54,340
where I was dicking around doing nothing today. So it really there's no rhyme or reason

1598
05:23:54,979 --> 05:23:58,979
to when I'm going to play a certain game. Just kind of happens organically if I want to.

1599
05:24:00,259 --> 05:24:03,750
So I know there's a lot of people that are like hey you should play this you should play this

1600
05:24:03,750 --> 05:24:07,349
and they recommend I take I've taken a lot of stuff already from that recommendation channel.

1601
05:24:09,110 --> 05:24:15,240
So I do know and I do see that they're worth playing but I just can't like guarantee like

1602
05:24:15,240 --> 05:24:19,240
oh hey you better stick around because in February middle of February you're gonna get a

1603
05:24:19,240 --> 05:24:31,340
Lisa playthrough. Like I don't know if that's gonna be the case. I'm always open to pretty

1604
05:24:31,340 --> 05:24:38,299
much anything. But take care of yourself thank you for the one dollar donation here

1605
05:24:40,139 --> 05:24:55,080
and have a great day and a great tomorrow. Oh shit is he gonna play Lisa? Is he gonna do that?

1606
05:24:55,080 --> 05:25:01,799
Whoa you sick. Hey Captain Scruffy thanks for the five dollars. It was awesome meeting you

1607
05:25:01,799 --> 05:25:12,540
the other day. You as well. Thank you so much for the five dollars and I love meeting people.

1608
05:25:12,540 --> 05:25:22,599
I love talking to people. It was a pleasure. Thank you and thank you for the five dollars.

1609
05:25:24,330 --> 05:25:31,290
ZeroSnakey thanks for the one dollar. Man Dom Requiem thanks for the one dollar. Stop singing

1610
05:25:31,290 --> 05:25:43,290
please. I did. I did. I did. Eventually. El Cobra thanks for the 10 dollars. This was

1611
05:25:43,290 --> 05:25:48,810
beautiful 10 out of 10. How have you not hit the top 10 yet? Top 10 on the billboards?

1612
05:25:49,689 --> 05:25:56,119
I don't know. I'm as shocked as you are. I can't believe that my singing voice has not carried me

1613
05:25:56,919 --> 05:26:02,200
to the top of the charts. It should be there. But thanks for the 10 dollars. Smelly Boy thanks

1614
05:26:02,200 --> 05:26:05,240
for the one dollar. The singing was more embarrassing than German Raptor. No it wasn't.

1615
05:26:06,979 --> 05:26:15,400
I don't think that's true. No way. Not in a million years. Thank you Schmegs for the five

1616
05:26:15,400 --> 05:26:20,090
dollars. I love all your content. Thank you. Thanks for sticking around. Thanks for paying me

1617
05:26:20,090 --> 05:26:32,069
money. Thanks for everything. Thanks for the five dollars. Super Frogman thanks for one dollar.

1618
05:26:32,069 --> 05:26:36,569
Hope this covers the cost of a name tag for the sneeze gun. Would have given it to you earlier

1619
05:26:36,569 --> 05:26:41,930
but had to name mine first. Seriously I've been watching since Burger Boy puked. I've never once

1620
05:26:41,930 --> 05:26:51,419
seen one of your videos and not laughed. You are a great inspiration. Oh yeah. Oh yeah I

1621
05:26:51,419 --> 05:26:57,500
forgot about that. He did puke on he well not on camera. He ran out of the room into

1622
05:26:57,500 --> 05:27:10,650
the bathroom. That's a fucked up video. Good old Burger Boy. Thank you Super Frogman. Thank

1623
05:27:10,650 --> 05:27:26,619
you Jess again for the one dollar. Look how terrifying this is. Pretty terrifying. Smelly

1624
05:27:26,619 --> 05:27:31,020
Boy thanks for the one dollar. You were for used to play Kenshi for this. I did play Kenshi

1625
05:27:31,020 --> 05:27:39,000
for about just about six hours. So I did. I did do that. I did. I did. I did. Thank you

1626
05:27:39,000 --> 05:27:42,279
though Smelly Boy for the one dollar. I think you see 4G for the one dollar. Karaoke Boy has

1627
05:27:42,279 --> 05:27:47,479
arrived and left at the same time. Hardcore candy store thanks for the one dollar. I love

1628
05:27:47,479 --> 05:27:57,669
your IRL streams. Sometimes we have some fun and sometimes I just don't know what to do with

1629
05:27:57,669 --> 05:28:06,389
myself in front of the camera so I embarrass myself profusely. Sky King TV thanks for the

1630
05:28:06,389 --> 05:28:10,950
one dollar. Hey I just finished a stream. Only had three people show up but you inspire

1631
05:28:10,950 --> 05:28:15,349
me man. Thanks for all the laughs. Wish I could give you more. Don't worry about that.

1632
05:28:17,560 --> 05:28:27,639
Thanks for even the consideration. Good luck with your stream. It's tough. I wish you

1633
05:28:27,639 --> 05:28:34,840
luck. Hey spuds thanks for the one dollar. What a good bit Jeremy. Very nice.

1634
05:29:15,259 --> 05:29:19,900
Maybe I should have picked a voice that was a little less ridiculous.

1635
05:29:22,549 --> 05:29:29,099
You couldn't hear a god damn thing I was saying. Absolutely nothing.

1636
05:29:30,229 --> 05:29:36,259
You couldn't hear anything. I was in there for like a full minute. At least or two minutes.

1637
05:29:38,810 --> 05:29:50,810
Oh my god. God damn it. Thank you Mini Clips for the 10 dollars. This is the engaging content

1638
05:29:50,810 --> 05:29:57,110
I come to watch. Wild Fox thanks for the one dollar. Thank you to 10 bucks though for real.

1639
05:29:57,990 --> 05:30:08,549
Thank you Wild Fox and one dollar. Hey Jeremy I want to thank you again for being such a cheery

1640
05:30:08,869 --> 05:30:12,790
and upbeat personality. The amount of emotion I'll help you streams have given me over the

1641
05:30:12,790 --> 05:30:16,869
years is ridiculous. I hope you find comfort in your community as much as we do with you,

1642
05:30:16,869 --> 05:30:29,459
Jeremy Hart. Yeah I do. I do. You guys are great. I butted heads a little bit today

1643
05:30:31,860 --> 05:30:49,700
but nothing serious. And by butting heads I mean me versus myself in a way. If you

1644
05:30:49,700 --> 05:31:00,729
hear earlier you probably know what that means. But uh no it's great. Everybody here is usually

1645
05:31:01,290 --> 05:31:09,419
99.9 percent of the time a fucking joy to be around. You know every point zero zero point

1646
05:31:09,419 --> 05:31:14,779
one percent somebody says German is short ha ha ha it's tiny man and you know some you know

1647
05:31:14,779 --> 05:31:31,459
that's just one zero point zero zero zero one percent. But it's all good. That's like 78

1648
05:31:31,459 --> 05:31:44,409
percent. No it's not that much. But thank you Wild Fox. Avon Grad thanks for the one dollar.

1649
05:31:44,409 --> 05:31:50,229
Jeremy Hart right back at you. Valky thanks for two bucks. Don't worry man this stream is great.

1650
05:31:50,790 --> 05:32:01,979
If it was boring you wouldn't have almost 4 000 viewers. Love you Jeremy. I can't even

1651
05:32:01,979 --> 05:32:05,459
believe that there are that many people that would be here in the first place so thanks.

1652
05:32:05,459 --> 05:32:13,450
Really really appreciate that. Bro Luck thanks for the 15 dollars. I was watching

1653
05:32:13,450 --> 05:32:17,369
a different streamer on mute open to your stream and watched the other for a little bit

1654
05:32:17,369 --> 05:32:22,490
I thought you were insane at the Witcher 3. I wasn't surprised when I realized what was going

1655
05:32:22,490 --> 05:32:27,130
on. It's okay I can go back to pretending you are good at video games. Beat Simpsons hit and run

1656
05:32:27,130 --> 05:32:44,759
first uh first sitting. I mean I don't know that's the latest one. Thank you for the 15

1657
05:32:44,759 --> 05:32:51,959
dollars though really appreciate that dude. Love it our speed run by the way. Yeah that

1658
05:32:51,959 --> 05:33:01,819
guy bit his controller. I didn't. Came kind of close. But thanks for the 15 dollars bro.

1659
05:33:01,819 --> 05:33:04,619
Luck thank you Freudian Weapon for the one dollar. I'm definitely checking out Kenshi

1660
05:33:04,619 --> 05:33:12,409
once I hook up my PC. Thanks for showing it to me. It's a great game. I feel like it just gets

1661
05:33:12,409 --> 05:33:21,159
better as you play it. Thank you Bro Luck again for the 20 total dollars. I just did it again.

1662
05:33:21,159 --> 05:33:24,840
I was looking at Shroud's stream on mute with yours in the background. I mean this is just a

1663
05:33:24,840 --> 05:33:28,919
lie at this point but that's uh I'll give it to you. And I thought maybe wow he's not a

1664
05:33:28,919 --> 05:33:51,700
trash at video at the game. Apparently. Thanks for the 20 bucks Bro Luck. Uh Yakubu thanks for

1665
05:33:51,700 --> 05:33:57,540
the one dollar. Jazz Jelly thanks for one dollar. Hi Jeffrey. Hey hi Jazz Jelly.

1666
05:33:59,659 --> 05:34:04,060
Prodbreaker thanks for the three bucks. Yo Jerma what's up man. Have been watching you

1667
05:34:04,060 --> 05:34:11,740
since the Jerma is mad and Jerma rumbled 2k14 days. I I'm wait you didn't know that I

1668
05:34:11,740 --> 05:34:22,119
streamed. I wonder how many people didn't know that I stream. I feel like it's probably a lot.

1669
05:34:23,560 --> 05:34:25,880
We talked about this like two days ago didn't we? Like three days ago.

1670
05:34:26,840 --> 05:34:49,720
Wait you stream? Because the uh from YouTube and all that people still don't know surprisingly.

1671
05:34:50,439 --> 05:34:56,599
Yeah I'm gonna have to think about how I want to handle that. It's more like internal conflict.

1672
05:34:57,560 --> 05:35:07,400
We have discussed it but we don't need to discuss it now. Thank you though Prodbreaker

1673
05:35:07,400 --> 05:35:14,380
for three bucks. Welcome. Swiggy swanky thanks for the one dollar. This is my favorite OST.

1674
05:35:15,180 --> 05:35:46,520
All right I gotta compose myself here. I'm fucking losing my mind. I really was losing my mind.

1675
05:35:48,950 --> 05:36:01,479
Thank you ToshirodoTV for the one dollar. Can't wait for the Kenshi exclusive Jerma

1676
05:36:01,479 --> 05:36:08,360
rumble at the end of the year with a full squad of dumb bitches primed for our entertainment.

1677
05:36:08,360 --> 05:36:23,299
I hope Massamoon wins. Oh goodness. Thank you Sir Tardigrad for the three dollars. Big fan of

1678
05:36:23,299 --> 05:36:26,659
the Kenshi streams. Keep it up. You really should keep playing Gungeon on stream. It's a lot of

1679
05:36:26,659 --> 05:36:47,740
fun once you get the hang of it. I don't know if I have the capacity to to play it. I've

1680
05:36:47,740 --> 05:36:55,639
watched people play Gungeon. It looks great but I think uh I feel like I need to like really

1681
05:36:55,639 --> 05:37:01,860
sink time into games like that. It's like Binding of Isaac. I put hundreds of hours,

1682
05:37:01,860 --> 05:37:08,939
hundreds and hundreds of hours into Binding of Isaac and Isaac is at this point is just

1683
05:37:08,939 --> 05:37:15,049
that game that I could go back and play and have a meltdown after Mario Tennis.

1684
05:37:18,630 --> 05:37:24,540
But thank you. Thank you Darkstar for the one dollar. You know if you value freedom to do

1685
05:37:24,540 --> 05:37:28,220
whatever the hell you want in sandbox type games you should get around to playing

1686
05:37:28,220 --> 05:37:32,540
Breath of the Wild. So if you ever did choose to stream it I would suggest maybe only one or

1687
05:37:32,540 --> 05:37:36,380
two streams considering how you can get bored when playing long games on stream.

1688
05:37:38,740 --> 05:37:44,470
What the fuck is playing in the background? It's like Michael Myers in my house.

1689
05:37:50,020 --> 05:37:57,380
Hello? What the fuck was that? All right well that was I'm just gonna mute the

1690
05:37:57,380 --> 05:38:11,049
desktop. That was weird. Yeah Breath of the Wild seems cool. I don't know. Thank you

1691
05:38:11,049 --> 05:38:22,250
the Jewish bro for the dollar 50. Oh sorry two three six hold on six seven eight nine ten.

1692
05:38:22,250 --> 05:38:27,580
Thanks for the ten dollars. Spread out over about probably 30 minutes or so. Thank you so much.

1693
05:38:32,500 --> 05:38:43,029
Really appreciate that. Uh thank you Ragtor for the one dollar. Dude I love Nightwing. I

1694
05:38:43,029 --> 05:38:47,189
love his emblem tattoo. I have his emblem tattooed on my arm. Do you remember where you got that

1695
05:38:47,189 --> 05:38:53,990
shirt? I gotta have one. Have you read Nightwing the new order? Hugs and kisses. Xoxo how do I

1696
05:38:53,990 --> 05:39:08,630
end these? Face caming. Wait what's happening? Oh I actually don't know where the hell I got

1697
05:39:08,630 --> 05:39:15,450
this. I think this is on a clearance rack somewhere. That's one of those music stores.

1698
05:39:16,250 --> 05:39:19,450
I don't remember exactly where I got it. I'm certain it was on the clearance rack though.

1699
05:39:20,169 --> 05:39:36,229
That's all I remember. It was like a buy five get five. Ghost hunting? What's going on?

1700
05:39:36,950 --> 05:39:47,080
But thank you uh brown cow balls for the one dollar. Thank you Garfield the Monday killer.

1701
05:39:47,080 --> 05:39:53,479
Thanks for the one dollar. Uh Garf stones meet the Garf stones of the modern feline family

1702
05:39:53,479 --> 05:39:58,360
from the land of Toontown. They give bits to Jeremy. Yabba dabba doo Jeremy your

1703
05:39:58,360 --> 05:40:02,279
trusty feline ambassador hath returned with a new kitty cat viewer in the chat.

1704
05:40:03,319 --> 05:40:09,000
Wait there are new cats? Who are the new cats? I bet you thought Garfield was slacking off with

1705
05:40:09,000 --> 05:40:17,080
his cat related duties but no siree potpourri. I know how to say potpourri. Garf just got you

1706
05:40:17,080 --> 05:40:22,009
like a ton of new viewers. They're in the chat right now. Make yourselves known. All cats.

1707
05:40:22,009 --> 05:40:34,889
Did Garf deliver or what? I don't see any cats here. Thank you Garfield. Thank you smelly

1708
05:40:34,889 --> 05:40:38,409
boy for the one dollar. Jeremy we like watching you play Kenshi. Stop pretending like you don't

1709
05:40:38,409 --> 05:40:48,139
know twitch chat is full of assholes who lie and fuck with you. No that was not. Come on

1710
05:40:49,259 --> 05:40:58,900
let's be completely real here. I can I know the difference between we're fucking with

1711
05:40:59,540 --> 05:41:15,720
Jeremy man and I don't like this. There's a big difference even before we switched to Kenshi.

1712
05:41:17,700 --> 05:41:31,770
You know come on. All you gotta do is look. Can Jeremy ban? Can you ban Jeremy?

1713
05:41:43,029 --> 05:41:53,700
Jeremy ban. Jeremy ban. Can you ban Jeremy? Jeremy ban. But thank you smelly boy. Thank

1714
05:41:53,700 --> 05:42:03,819
you dryski for the ten dollars. We caught you earlier. Thank you so much. And then no

1715
05:42:03,819 --> 05:42:08,060
soup for you. Came in with 14. Talked about how thought about giving 50. Don't worry about

1716
05:42:08,060 --> 05:42:13,619
that. They say don't let chat get to you. No it was it wasn't chat. It wasn't about

1717
05:42:13,619 --> 05:42:22,299
like the chat. It was about that the collective collective boredom that a lot of people were

1718
05:42:22,299 --> 05:42:31,849
experiencing. And even look even with a poll right 30 what like 30% said that they were

1719
05:42:31,849 --> 05:42:44,540
just like oh my god get off the game. So you know I gotta read that right. So when when

1720
05:42:44,540 --> 05:42:49,900
you when at least 30% of people are just like like telling me hey I don't like this.

1721
05:42:50,619 --> 05:42:57,619
I read it. I have I'm reading it. It's not about because look at to me it's if you don't

1722
05:42:57,619 --> 05:43:03,860
like a stream or if you don't like a game that's all right. But I at the end of the day

1723
05:43:03,860 --> 05:43:12,229
it's something that I need to either to do change or take care of. You made him sad.

1724
05:43:16,419 --> 05:43:22,889
You don't always have to listen to chat. And I mean I I don't I I kind of don't in a lot

1725
05:43:22,889 --> 05:43:34,790
of ways. But just but always but keep in mind right just always keep that in mind.

1726
05:43:37,340 --> 05:43:47,909
That I am reading the chat. So sometimes you look over it it's just like shit man and

1727
05:43:49,909 --> 05:43:58,729
that's this all right I guess. Oh fuck he saw all the bad things I've said about him.

1728
05:43:59,290 --> 05:44:27,849
Sometimes you look over it it's shit man. Hang in my badge tomorrow. But don't take this as me

1729
05:44:28,810 --> 05:44:36,500
complaining about chat. Complaining about things that people say. Because I like I told you that

1730
05:44:36,500 --> 05:44:57,939
I know there's a there's a very there's a huge difference between banter and boredom. I just

1731
05:44:57,939 --> 05:45:03,180
hope you guys know that I want to make sure every stream is fun and it's hard to do that.

1732
05:45:03,979 --> 05:45:17,819
And that's almost an impossible task. But I'm gonna try to do it.

1733
05:45:20,810 --> 05:45:28,229
Thanks for the 14 dollars and 10 dollars here. Dry Ski and no soup for you.

1734
05:45:46,490 --> 05:45:57,430
Well to touch up to kind of expand upon this one final time. It's it's it's tough.

1735
05:45:58,069 --> 05:46:07,580
Here's one reason why. Because I get a lot of requests to do stuff like today. Just play a

1736
05:46:07,580 --> 05:46:11,419
game and just hey let's play something and play it and do it again. Play that game again. Play

1737
05:46:11,419 --> 05:46:16,099
that game again. That was that was fun. It was relaxing. But it's almost an equal amount of

1738
05:46:16,099 --> 05:46:23,979
people that would rather see something else. So when maybe I'd say probably half the people

1739
05:46:23,979 --> 05:46:30,220
don't want to watch a game like Kenshi and half the people do. It's kind of this it's a

1740
05:46:30,220 --> 05:46:39,479
rock and a hard place. It wasn't equal. But but my point is that there's a lot of people

1741
05:46:39,479 --> 05:46:42,840
that want to watch me kind of just play a game and hang out. And there are a lot of people that

1742
05:46:42,840 --> 05:46:47,720
want to watch me do something else that's maybe a little more intense or a little

1743
05:46:47,720 --> 05:47:09,110
crazier or more interesting right. And it's trying to find a balance between those two

1744
05:47:09,110 --> 05:47:47,430
things. Do a live knitting stream. But I'm I'm really I'm really absolutely I'm just

1745
05:47:47,430 --> 05:47:55,979
absolutely nitpicking here. Because it's this is like that this is a great problem to have.

1746
05:47:56,779 --> 05:48:02,840
A bunch of people like this. A bunch of people like the other stuff. A bunch of people like

1747
05:48:02,840 --> 05:48:06,919
the other shit that I do. No I like that so much I want you to do that. No I like this

1748
05:48:06,919 --> 05:48:14,549
too. That's a good problem to have. And I wouldn't even classify it as a problem.

1749
05:48:15,509 --> 05:48:37,450
It means that I have a big audience. Yeah and as the channel continues to grow I need to

1750
05:48:37,450 --> 05:48:44,439
start to figure out how to handle stuff. Because this channel look I come from YouTube

1751
05:48:44,439 --> 05:48:53,029
right four years ago. Where I didn't have to oh it wasn't live. I could just upload a video

1752
05:48:53,029 --> 05:48:58,099
and that was it and like leave the comments. And what do people say about that video? This

1753
05:48:58,099 --> 05:49:03,380
video sucked. Oh shit all right I'll make sure to change that. I bet I'll change that video

1754
05:49:03,380 --> 05:49:10,069
style. In real time it's almost like oh fuck this is happening right now. This shit's

1755
05:49:10,069 --> 05:49:17,299
happening right now. You know not like days later when I go look at a comment section.

1756
05:49:17,860 --> 05:49:33,849
So it's different. And the channel has almost doubled at some points even tripled in viewership

1757
05:49:33,849 --> 05:49:57,110
over the last six months. It's been absolutely fucking insane. Yeah really yeah. Oh Jesus.

1758
05:49:59,830 --> 05:50:05,590
That's just me watching a bunch of times in a row. Wait like what right now?

1759
05:50:10,310 --> 05:50:18,389
Uh there's a huge amount of money just came in right now. Uh thank you thank you Jingo

1760
05:50:18,389 --> 05:50:30,069
Jango Wizard Spy for these 65 dollars. 65 bucks. Hey I only meant to buy 1500 bits but it kept on

1761
05:50:30,069 --> 05:50:35,509
saying purchase failed. Turns out it worked every time. Rip. Anyway I wasn't here for the

1762
05:50:35,509 --> 05:50:38,150
beginning of the stream but I know the kind of situation you're talking about and I hate

1763
05:50:38,150 --> 05:50:43,270
it when it happens because it grows from being a joke into being something real. Hope you know

1764
05:50:43,270 --> 05:50:46,790
that fans like myself love anything you put out. You're doing it great. You're doing great dad.

1765
05:50:50,939 --> 05:50:54,779
First of all apparently Twitch is having a strange bit problem tonight

1766
05:50:55,580 --> 05:51:08,979
and people are buying way fucking more than they wanted to. Holy shit. That error is

1767
05:51:08,979 --> 05:51:27,319
that's not all right but thank you anyways regardless. But yeah I it's hard to even

1768
05:51:27,319 --> 05:51:34,409
comment on because I do you think I I don't know how to like deal with that.

1769
05:51:35,130 --> 05:51:44,459
I mean I do to an extent but and I'm and I am acting like this was a huge this was a huge

1770
05:51:44,459 --> 05:51:52,150
problem. No it wasn't at all. Essentially if you if you weren't here there was a portion of

1771
05:51:52,150 --> 05:51:57,029
the stream where I felt that people were bored and they but they didn't want to see this

1772
05:51:57,029 --> 05:52:01,930
anymore and they wanted me to move on to something else and that's what I felt. That's

1773
05:52:01,930 --> 05:52:10,790
how the way that's the way I felt. And then it was kind of like an equal amount of people were

1774
05:52:10,790 --> 05:52:18,970
like no stay no go I'm leaving I'm out of here. It's like did you see Barnabas? Barnabas just

1775
05:52:18,970 --> 05:52:28,970
like just sat down in the bed and it's cool right? Dermot you work for Twitch. Fix this

1776
05:52:28,970 --> 05:52:43,189
problem. Enter. But I'll move on for a bit. It wasn't a big deal but might as well talk

1777
05:52:43,189 --> 05:53:08,759
about it because why not right? Thank you for the 65 accidental dollars. When Vinny played

1778
05:53:08,759 --> 05:53:11,639
Bad Dead Redemption 2 he finished the game because he enjoyed it and he had the lowest

1779
05:53:11,639 --> 05:53:17,619
numbers. No it's not but it's not a it's not a numbers thing. It's not a numbers thing. It

1780
05:53:17,619 --> 05:53:22,340
doesn't I don't doesn't the the fact that the viewers you know were dropping when I

1781
05:53:22,340 --> 05:53:33,540
started playing Kenshi that's not the problem that I'm describing. I'm talking about people

1782
05:53:33,540 --> 05:53:39,689
audibly in the chat room talking about how how badly they don't want me to do the thing

1783
05:53:39,689 --> 05:54:14,169
I'm currently doing. Audibly typing right but that but that's the only reason why

1784
05:54:15,209 --> 05:54:19,369
I even thought to address it in the first place because I was in the reception so let's just

1785
05:54:19,369 --> 05:54:25,689
give again an example here. So if you have like 4,000 people and that drops down to like

1786
05:54:25,689 --> 05:54:31,930
3,000 all right whatever that's fine but then like 3,000 people you know people still talking

1787
05:54:31,930 --> 05:54:36,569
about it maybe they're still bored they're still talking about it then you know did people

1788
05:54:36,650 --> 05:54:40,090
leave because they were bored or people still sticking around hoping that I'll change to

1789
05:54:40,090 --> 05:54:59,819
something else right it's tricky probably both yeah but regardless I don't want to I don't want

1790
05:54:59,819 --> 05:55:06,810
to smack into this dead horse anymore it's not an issue it's not it's just something to talk

1791
05:55:06,810 --> 05:55:20,310
about. Hey pin thanks for the one dollar coffee Cheetos chicken compact exoskeleton bug

1805
05:56:49,130 --> 05:56:54,409
these huge Boston paws for hands and it personally intimidated me when you shook my hand

1806
05:56:54,409 --> 05:56:58,250
and stared straight into my eyes as you squeezed my hand way too hard

1807
05:56:58,250 --> 05:57:26,970

1811
05:58:15,209 --> 05:58:17,689
raided you he had some really nice things to say I figured you should hear it

1812
05:58:31,610 --> 05:58:38,490
tonight I'm going to raid my main man Jerma because I never got to raid him and we played

1813
05:58:38,490 --> 05:58:44,650
with him ages ago eons ago and he's been absolutely destroying it on Twitch I actually

1814
05:58:45,209 --> 05:58:52,009
actively watch his stuff um he's really really funny everything that he does is great um

1815
05:58:52,729 --> 05:58:58,009
he will if you haven't seen any of Jerma's stuff I guarantee you he'll probably hook you in and

1816
05:58:58,009 --> 05:59:03,049
you'll probably continue to watch throughout the rest of the night I'd imagine if you're

1817
05:59:03,049 --> 05:59:09,369
looking for something entertaining um so we're gonna raid him he's really cool and I never

1818
05:59:09,369 --> 05:59:16,889
raided him before I'll see you guys next week next holy shit that was fucking yeah that was

1819
05:59:16,889 --> 05:59:28,889
an incredibly nice thing to say wow that I'm like floored right now that was that that's

1820
05:59:28,889 --> 05:59:38,970
unbelievable unless he's playing Kenshi come on you you had to say that you had to just say that

1821
05:59:38,970 --> 05:59:49,740
right now after that like 20 minute conversation about trying to make people happy and trying

1822
05:59:49,740 --> 06:00:07,130
to please everybody and people are bored and but now Nova Nova is you know back a long time

1823
06:00:07,130 --> 06:00:15,720
ago I used to watch his fucking YouTube videos he's like one of the he's one of those like

1824
06:00:15,720 --> 06:00:24,569
original still still doing it still having a blast still making people fucking laugh all these

1825
06:00:24,569 --> 06:00:32,569
years later so hearing that from somebody like him is that's unbelievable it's incredible

1826
06:00:40,869 --> 06:00:43,990
every time I ever watch something that he's that he always comes off as a fucking just

1827
06:00:43,990 --> 06:00:58,150
fun loving awesome dude so thank you for sharing that clip that that was if you're not following

1828
06:00:59,189 --> 06:01:28,340
Nova over hacks on Nova James if I absolutely do I would say the same thing uh about him so yeah

1829
06:01:28,340 --> 06:01:37,049
and you know that adds uh to kind of wrap up that conversation about how I don't want people

1830
06:01:37,049 --> 06:01:42,169
to be bored and how it it concerns me when chat is saying this I don't like this what the

1831
06:01:42,169 --> 06:01:53,400
fuck this is boring dude you know like it that like hearing shit like I want to make sure you're

1832
06:01:53,400 --> 06:02:03,259
entertained that's very important to me it's the most important thing and absolutely absolutely

1833
06:02:05,380 --> 06:02:16,409
I take that shit very very very seriously and I just imagine scenarios when people come over

1834
06:02:16,409 --> 06:02:20,330
and they something happens and they don't like it and they leave or something it's like fuck I

1835
06:02:20,330 --> 06:02:29,590
wish I could have convinced you otherwise but that's all I'm gonna say about it I'll see you

1836
06:02:29,590 --> 06:02:34,470
guys on Thursday I'm not even done what the fuck are you doing I'm out of here no no no no

1837
06:02:34,470 --> 06:02:40,680
no no no there's still like another 10 bits to read if you're worried about people being

1838
06:02:40,680 --> 06:02:47,479
bored wide then why do a poll in the first place I mean that's because I'm curious about

1839
06:02:48,040 --> 06:02:56,180
people want to see the reason for the polls is because I have a couple of ideas

1840
06:02:56,180 --> 06:02:59,619
and then you know most people whatever they think is they would want to see you know

1841
06:03:00,580 --> 06:03:20,169
but no I'm not I'm not gonna skip out I for some reason my brow is at the top

1842
06:03:20,810 --> 06:03:25,990
so I'm not skipping out on bits don't worry there's not very many more to do here anyway so

1843
06:03:27,979 --> 06:03:35,110
uh cherosophilia thanks for the one dollar also if you like this game we think you'd

1844
06:03:35,110 --> 06:03:40,310
really like rimworld I have 500 hours in it it's one of my favorite games it generates crazy

1845
06:03:40,310 --> 06:03:44,470
stories like the time I tried to replace someone's busted leg with a prosthetic

1846
06:03:44,549 --> 06:03:48,389
but I chopped off the wrong leg and she had to hop around on one foot for a few months

1847
06:03:49,029 --> 06:03:54,150
by the time my best sniper got his entire head bitten off by a lynx and then I re-grew it

1848
06:03:54,150 --> 06:03:57,830
good as new with some robo juice but his wife remained emotionally traumatized

1849
06:04:00,680 --> 06:04:04,439
I have heard I mean it's Alex plays a lot of rimworld and he talks about how it's

1850
06:04:04,439 --> 06:04:08,439
fucking hilarious and fun so maybe one of these days I'll load it up

1863
06:05:43,319 --> 06:05:50,709
not be um I would not be offended at all if twitch fixed this and you didn't that didn't

1864
06:05:50,709 --> 06:05:54,150
happen so hopefully that you didn't want that to happen that could be resolved because that's

1865
06:05:55,029 --> 06:06:00,939
that's what the hell is going on there is it a joke at this point I don't know if it is

1866
06:06:01,990 --> 06:06:08,330
I don't think it is drosophilia thanks for the one dollar also since you're not streaming

1867
06:06:08,409 --> 06:06:12,569
tomorrow I thought I'd say that it's that's my 21st birthday I've been struggling with depression

1868
06:06:12,569 --> 06:06:17,610
a lot this past year and you've helped bring me back to reality a lot of the time because

1869
06:06:17,610 --> 06:06:21,770
the green screen stream and your anticipation to see what people would make with it I created

1870
06:06:21,770 --> 06:06:25,529
almost a dozen things and I realized that I have a much greater drive to be creative

1871
06:06:26,250 --> 06:06:35,959
than I originally thought thanks for helping me discover that hell yeah thank you drosophilia

1872
06:06:35,959 --> 06:06:42,409
that was kind of the point of that whole thing and that's the point of the second

1873
06:06:42,409 --> 06:06:50,069
one that we'll do as well to have in the community dip down into their brains and come

1874
06:06:50,069 --> 06:06:56,069
up with stuff because I see you guys come up with some funny fucking shit all the time

1875
06:06:56,069 --> 06:07:06,439
interesting stuff all the time I'm so happy that that happened I am beyond beyond happy

1876
06:07:09,110 --> 06:07:19,349
I'm filled with joy that even one person got to get their creative juices flowing for a

1877
06:07:19,349 --> 06:07:35,000
little while I would love to do more stuff like that in the future so thank you take care

1878

06:09:04,919 --> 06:09:15,669
I lived in Massachusetts my whole life so it's the first time I've ever been away from New

1887
06:09:15,669 --> 06:09:25,900
England so I think it's a good change for now thank you germa is the best for the one dollar

1888
06:09:25,900 --> 06:09:29,099
do you ever try to learn another language if not what language would you want to learn

1889
06:09:31,240 --> 06:09:37,000
oh I think it's probably hard to learn a language at this point you have the easiest

1890
06:09:37,000 --> 06:09:44,889
time learning a language when you're a young kid and it's almost for me at least at this

1891
06:09:44,889 --> 06:09:55,639
stage of my life would probably be impossible for me everyone's watching it on repeat but if

1892
06:09:55,720 --> 06:10:02,119
I wanted to learn a language um that's really tough because it's probably like a bunch that

1893
06:10:02,119 --> 06:10:13,319
I would think would be interesting to learn and know to learn language in older age though

1894
06:10:13,319 --> 06:10:20,069
yeah he's been trying to learn English that's what those videos he keeps listening to are about

1895
06:10:22,150 --> 06:10:33,610
that's true um I don't know maybe like I can't even it's hard to even answer that

1896
06:10:33,610 --> 06:10:39,779
because that one answer is not right I'd probably want to know at least a couple of

1897
06:10:39,779 --> 06:10:47,139
European languages maybe be able to understand something like Japanese would be interesting

1898
06:10:48,180 --> 06:11:02,310
I don't know that's tough no no that's that's not why it's just I just would be interesting

1899
06:11:02,310 --> 06:11:07,189
I want to go to Tokyo one day so it'd be nice to maybe know and understand what

1900
06:11:07,909 --> 06:11:12,709
people are saying and read be able to read menus at a restaurant or something you know

1901
06:11:13,669 --> 06:11:23,000
by the way ladies and gentlemen no I'm not even going to announce this until Thursday's stream

1902
06:11:26,939 --> 06:11:36,630
I've got an announcement to make a big announcement I have watched my 2019 anime

1903
06:11:37,669 --> 06:11:41,880
big announcement coming up on Thursday and we're gonna have a conversation about it

1904
06:11:42,759 --> 06:12:01,700
and hey oh and I loved it I loved it uh thank you P337R for the five dollars they say hey man

1905
06:12:01,779 --> 06:12:10,299
seems good hey how you doing P337R how are you hope you have a great day great rest of your night

1906
06:12:10,299 --> 06:12:26,310
and a great afternoon P337R and that is the end of the bits except for one minute ago the one

1907
06:12:26,310 --> 06:12:31,720
Freeman gave two dollars hey Jerma are you aware of the concept of parasocial relationships

1908
06:12:31,720 --> 06:12:35,720
as a popular streamer I feel you'd have a unique perspective on the phenomena especially

1909
06:12:35,720 --> 06:12:40,279
after moving from YouTube to a platform with live interaction has been difficult to change your

1910
06:12:40,279 --> 06:12:45,400
relationship with chat as the channel has grown e.g. not being able to read subs chat going too

1911
06:12:45,400 --> 06:12:52,340
fast to interact with also do you make any conscious decisions to discourage the less healthy

1912
06:12:52,340 --> 06:13:05,459
interactions um I mean here's the the long and short of that I want everyone here to think

1913
06:13:06,500 --> 06:13:13,080
that they're part of a fun community right because I think they are I think hanging out

1914
06:13:13,080 --> 06:13:18,919
here hanging out in the discord making friends in the discord and being able to have a great

1915
06:13:19,720 --> 06:13:27,669
great time together is important but I think that there is I think there's a line

1916
06:13:28,790 --> 06:13:38,759
for at least for me because it's I it's so hard when I want to give personal attention

1917
06:13:39,959 --> 06:13:49,700
but I can't and even something like the end of the stream here is is is hard to do sometimes

1918
06:13:51,580 --> 06:13:56,220
just because of the fact that there's a lot more people and like you said chatted moves so

1919
06:13:56,220 --> 06:14:04,889
fast it's sometimes it's hard to even know what's going on but for the the main I guess

1920
06:14:04,889 --> 06:14:11,290
question that you're asking is discouraging a less healthy interaction I don't I don't think I

1921
06:14:11,770 --> 06:14:18,970
I don't think I do that I think that most of the time I collectively want to address everybody

1922
06:14:19,529 --> 06:14:27,299
as a community because once you if you start kind of having like a singling out people and

1923
06:14:27,860 --> 06:14:32,580
establishing uh what what some would call like a parasocial relationship with

1924
06:14:32,580 --> 06:14:39,380
a singular person or entity on the internet it's uh that that's not good both ways I think

1925
06:14:39,380 --> 06:14:48,069
because you know it almost takes that person out of what is the intent of this community is

1926
06:14:48,069 --> 06:14:54,950
and that's to have fun and enjoy everything together as essentially one large single entity

1927
06:15:03,580 --> 06:15:14,360
the hive mind and I look I'll be completely honest I'll be totally honest it's not it's

1928
06:15:14,360 --> 06:15:17,880
really not possible for me to even have that kind of relationship with a singular

1929
06:15:18,439 --> 06:15:25,529
person in the chat anyways it's not it's kind it's kind of impossible for all the aforementioned

1930
06:15:25,529 --> 06:15:40,979
reasons that you brought up I enjoy this community because we get to all experience it

1931
06:15:40,979 --> 06:15:49,139
together not because this one person or one small group or something that has to be the

1932
06:15:49,139 --> 06:15:57,400
group that is oh well like I'm here because of x I'm here because of y I'd rather everyone

1933
06:15:57,400 --> 06:16:00,680
just enjoy themselves and just be able to take their mind off of whatever they're currently

1934
06:16:01,319 --> 06:16:05,639
dealing with or if you're just kind of bored and you want to hang out and you want to just kind

1935
06:16:05,639 --> 06:16:24,310
of fuck around it's more fun that way it's a collective experience merchandise plans yes

1936
06:16:26,860 --> 06:16:39,419
they are the shirt so we'll be here in the next probably in the next week without a doubt

1937
06:16:39,419 --> 06:16:48,169
but thank you for the interesting question one freeman and yeah it's going from youtube to

1938
06:16:48,169 --> 06:16:51,529
twitch has changed a lot and it's it's still something I'm trying to deal with too

1939
06:16:52,250 --> 06:16:54,889
even though I've been doing this for a couple of years three years now total

1940
06:16:56,169 --> 06:17:01,139
it's uh it's it's always interesting but thank you thank you rad yourself for the one dollar

1941
06:17:01,139 --> 06:17:04,020
hey jerma just came to the realization that for the past week or two I've been doing

1942
06:17:04,020 --> 06:17:07,939
nothing but watching you non-stop when the stream is down I've been watching your sorcery

1943
06:17:07,939 --> 06:17:12,740
streams this is probably really unhealthy at any rate I recently got sorcery from myself and

1944
06:17:12,740 --> 06:17:16,979
I just got around to telling the time serpent to kill himself after making the water serpent

1945
06:17:17,060 --> 06:17:20,979
eat the sun serpent I'm surprised I never heard this weird fucking game until you

1946
06:17:27,860 --> 06:17:33,319
well first of all sorcery is probably one of the best games ever made

1947
06:17:34,200 --> 06:17:41,209
but also you know it's if you have time if you have free time and you like watching

1948
06:17:41,209 --> 06:17:47,159
something then that's there's nothing wrong with that you know there's not I don't I

1949
06:17:47,159 --> 06:17:51,959
I don't think there's anything wrong with watching something and enjoying something

1950
06:17:52,360 --> 06:18:01,369
as long as it's not negatively affecting you because if it is then you know you might consider

1951
06:18:01,369 --> 06:18:10,220
trying to figure out um some solutions as to how to not have something like that be a negative

1952
06:18:10,220 --> 06:18:22,819
influence but if you just if it's free time you're talking about and if it's if it's not

1953
06:18:22,819 --> 06:18:31,720
negatively affecting your life then I think I think that's fine but just be careful with

1954
06:18:33,500 --> 06:18:42,650
anything this stream included all time management and moderation of yourself is important

1955
06:18:53,159 --> 06:18:56,279
I would much rather and I know I know there's a lot of people that

1956
06:18:57,000 --> 06:19:02,119
would say oh I can't wait to stream again I'm gonna hang out here until you do right

1957
06:19:03,560 --> 06:19:06,840
that's incredible that to hear that somebody is that dedicated to this community

1958
06:19:07,560 --> 06:19:14,619
but just please take care of yourself first give time for yourself give time for you

1959
06:19:17,159 --> 06:19:28,060
allow yourself right because that kind of flows back into the but that question about

1960
06:19:28,060 --> 06:19:41,299
parasocial relationships just make sure you're taking care of you you all collectively take

1961
06:19:41,299 --> 06:19:48,259
care of me every fucking day so of course I want to make sure that you are taking

1962
06:19:48,259 --> 06:20:05,270
care of you too you know just stream less and now I don't like streaming way more than

1963
06:20:05,270 --> 06:20:17,819
I used to we're all yeah we're all you guys we're all just a couple of humans okay

1964
06:20:18,779 --> 06:20:33,139
he's making the parasocial stronger by saying that you guys get it you know what I'm trying

1965
06:20:33,139 --> 06:20:43,700
to say you know what I mean by this but that's kind of the end of the bits we have

1966
06:20:43,700 --> 06:20:49,619

1988
06:23:27,180 --> 06:23:31,180
so impressed with your ability to make such consistently funny and reusable jokes but then

1989
06:23:31,180 --> 06:23:36,779
I looked over at my screen and realized my mistakes anyway love you pop pop heed the warning

1992
06:23:47,930 --> 06:23:54,889
is not a bad this is not a bad stream I enjoyed myself during this stream very much so

1993
06:23:54,889 --> 06:24:03,900
from beginning to middle and then the end this is not I don't we're kind of what we're like

1994
06:24:03,900 --> 06:24:08,139
going through two or three different topics and kind of combining them in a bunch of strange

1995
06:24:08,139 --> 06:24:19,930
ways by no means that I not think this is I liked I just I had fun my concern was lying

1996
06:24:19,930 --> 06:24:29,159
with other people not having fun you know you know what I'm saying you know what I mean

1997
06:24:29,799 --> 06:24:45,209
he's finally done play somebody just wrote fuck him fuck him oh my god I know I'm not

1998
06:24:45,209 --> 06:24:58,549
gonna say that because that's I'm not gonna say that I just know I was reading what somebody

1999
06:24:58,549 --> 06:25:03,990
in chat said and I was very shocked by it that was the that was a shocked what the wtf

2000
06:25:04,069 --> 06:25:11,259
reaction hey dobski dude thanks for the one dollar germa you're just too damn nice you need to sit

2002
06:25:16,619 --> 06:25:22,060

2003
06:25:37,639 --> 06:25:44,599
thank you dobski dude pin thanks for the dollar oh one oh shit I meant to buy one bit

2004
06:25:44,599 --> 06:25:47,959
to send to you but I accidentally bought a hundred times what I was gonna get so

2005
06:25:47,959 --> 06:25:55,770
here you go germa thank you moo for the one dollar just accidentally remortgaged

2006
06:25:55,770 --> 06:25:59,689
my house to buy bits amazon's really acting up tonight thanks a lot bezos

2007
06:26:02,569 --> 06:26:06,009
is it true that jeff bezos makes like six hundred thousand dollars a second

2008
06:26:08,310 --> 06:26:22,299
is that real is that a made up is it a meme okay so you know you know when you get to

2009
06:26:23,900 --> 06:26:33,020
in the ipad idling game like let's just use cookie clicker as an example you know you

2010
06:26:33,020 --> 06:26:39,900
get to like the end of the cookie clicker where you have like 40 a thousand 40 giant

2011
06:26:39,900 --> 06:26:44,860
factories making the cookies and like 10 000 fucking grandmas making the cookies

2012
06:26:46,409 --> 06:26:49,049
and you get to the point where you're just like this game's not fun anymore

2013
06:26:51,159 --> 06:26:58,729
what do I do that's where jeff bezos is right now he has like 10 000 cookie factories

2014
06:26:58,729 --> 06:27:13,720
and he's just staring at the screen I mean at some point I would probably just be like

2015
06:27:14,950 --> 06:27:23,290
oh god it would scare me that would be scary can you imagine how scary that would be if you

2016
06:27:23,290 --> 06:27:30,169
were making tens of thousands of dollars a second it would be like what do I do what

2017
06:27:30,169 --> 06:27:33,689
the fuck is happening what do I do what do I do am I gonna get in trouble am I gonna get

2018
06:27:33,689 --> 06:27:44,740
in trouble I would think I was gonna get in trouble you gotta do new game plus at that

2019
06:27:44,740 --> 06:27:52,619
point he makes a hundred ninety one thousand dollars per minute I would think I was going

2020
06:27:52,619 --> 06:28:05,750
to jail somehow I don't know how but I would think that like what do you do at that point

2021
06:28:06,470 --> 06:28:13,049
what do you what like do you do with that money let's okay like how much is a private jet

2022
06:28:14,709 --> 06:28:22,659
okay we're talking okay somebody figure this math out because I'm actually curious okay how

2023
06:28:22,659 --> 06:28:30,279
much does it cost for every major city in the country in the United States so we're talking

2024
06:28:30,279 --> 06:28:37,259
every capital city you know obviously we're talking about Las Vegas that's not even the

2025
06:28:37,259 --> 06:28:49,319
capital of Nevada by the way but that's like a fun place to be so if you got 50 capital cities

2026
06:28:50,200 --> 06:28:57,580
and you have a like a million dollar house in every state every capital that's 50 million

2027
