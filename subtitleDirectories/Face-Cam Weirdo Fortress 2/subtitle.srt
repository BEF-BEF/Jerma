00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:15,070
I mean, the universe is such a large place, and it's a little disheartening that we don't spend more time and more effort with the research and development into certain things like the theory of relativity, for instance.

2
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:25,730
I mean, I'm not sure exactly why we don't spend that much money. I would implore the Congress and the Senate to do that, and it truly is a beautiful thing.

3
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:29,460
Did I just kill that many-

4
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:47,579
What is this? Look at how dirty this is. Like, it's like a- this was in my pocket, by the way, of these pants. You can't see them.

5
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:54,270
I have no- I must have like blown my nose in that and like wiped it on the concrete.

6
00:00:54,789 --> 00:01:01,369
Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2. It's been a while since the last Facecam Fortress, but let's go, cow man, let's-

7
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:13,799
Okay, I'm gonna show this to you because this doesn't make any sense. I don't know if I can get this in the camera.

8
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:22,700
This is my keyboard. That's my jump button. Can you-

9
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:29,780
How do they get those pita pockets? You know the little pita pockets that they make that you get at the grocery store?

10
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,459
How do they put those inside the pita? Like, how do they make the bread like that? That's- they can't make it.

11
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:40,420
It's impossible. Like, you need the dough to settle. You need there to be-

12
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,219
Am I missing? I'm missing. You need the dough.

13
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:52,569
I can't believe I'm- you know, the dough seriously needs to settle and I don't know what kind of dough you use,

14
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:58,489
but the dough that I use is truly- it sucks. It doesn't rise correctly. It smells a little bit.

15
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,489
It smells kind of like cheese and farts.

16
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:15,289
Come on. Somebody come over here. Somebody just walk over here right now. Come on. I could wait all day.

17
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:45,210
Get plenty of coffee. Got plenty of time. At least I killed somebody with that. This is the face I make.

18
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:57,159
When I'm really fucking mad. Now I'm mad. You made me fucking mad. Now it's time to show you

19
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:12,199
how we do things. Get behind enemy lines and start stabbing. Get like a nine-person chain stab.

20
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:23,879
Nobody up there. No snipers. What about back here? The only person on like red team is this like poor heavy.

21
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,689
That's about to- you know, we're not gonna kill this guy. I'm not gonna kill this guy. Yeah. Hey, what's up, man?

22
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:37,269
Got that health? He's like, huh? What was that? Who was that? Was that a spy?

23
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:40,310
I love how he's spy checking these guys, but not me.

24
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,990
Come on. Come on. Walk right into that crosshair. It wasn't the same guy, but it's okay.

25
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,509
I don't want to get shot in the face. That's the number one thing I don't want to have happen

26
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:55,509
accidentally by one of these snipers.

27
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,990
There was three and we lost because I wasn't capping the point, but

28
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:10,149
come on. Get it. Come on. Kill me baby. Baby speed. Come on. Turn around. Please turn around.

29
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:17,019
Turn around, please. Shoot me. Shoot me. I'm trying to walk in front of him.

30
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,149
Oh my god.

31
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:35,430
No, there's another one. There's two. Oh, no, they're gonna double team me.

32
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,699
Hold on a second.

33
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:48,649
They both have get this is on. They both just like

34
00:05:48,730 --> 00:06:04,199
Like

35
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:29,540
Head shot. Head shot. Head shot. Oh, and he landed and died. Get another head shot. Excuse me. What would you like?

36
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,420
No, it's a pyro and he's gonna get me.

37
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,579
I'm burning. It's over. I burnt.

38
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:42,040
Star Wars killed me. George Lucas presents Star Wars.

39
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:50,550
Gets the kill on Jerma or Greg. Are we really getting this badly destroyed right now?

40
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,480
We didn't even cap it once. How did this even happen? I don't even know. How did we do that?

41
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:04,860
What?

42
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:12,149
Yeah

43
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:13,800
Yes

44
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,759

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,420

48
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:37,819
redo just cut that out just slight just take in the file in the video file and they cut

49
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
And then drag that piece

50
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,180
To to the other piece to get rid of that fucking part talking to you Jerma

51
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,550
Don't leave this in don't accidentally leave this in

52
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,189
I know you're gonna accidentally leave this in and the people are gonna say you accidentally left this part in

53
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,660
And then i'm gonna say what are you even talking about? I didn't I didn't leave it in
