00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,439
Hey, what is going on everybody? Welcome to Scare Saturdays. My name is Jerma. Hopefully it's still Saturday.

2
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:18,440
I've been having a lot of problems today with rendering and uploading and stuff.

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,440
But if it's not Saturday where you are right now, then I'm sorry about that.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,440
But anyways, let's go over something first. I need a haircut really badly.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:33,439
I seriously look like Luke Perry and a mad scientist had a baby and it stars in a new feature film coming this August.

6
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:40,439
I look like a friggin' weirdo, but you know what, we're gonna leave it. It's Scare Saturdays. My hair's already standing up on end because I'm already scared.

7
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,439
So it makes perfect sense. But anyways, let's get started with Scare Saturdays. Welcome back to Scare Saturdays.

8
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:50,579
Gonna be playing an amnesia custom story by the name of Can't Remember.

9
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,329
Okay, so here we go. Can't Remember by Marv Studios.

10
00:00:55,329 --> 00:01:03,329
You wake up in an unknown house. You don't know how you got here. You can't see anybody and the only thing you can hear is the rain splashing against the window.

11
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:14,239
Alright, so I'm apparently lying on the ground somewhere. Your sanity is now dangerously low. Make sure to stay in light and try to make progress.

12
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,180
This is like shaking my screen. Cut it out, man.

13
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,519
Can I turn off the screen shake? What the hell, bro? Come on, get up.

14
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:32,140
Look, just because you had a party last night and you drank too much tequila doesn't mean you can stay on the ground.

15
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:40,709
Alright, I'm trying to make jokes, but I'm actually pretty nervous right now. It's been a while since I've played a game like this.

16
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,920
Is there a reason why it's all red? What the hell's the matter with me?

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,989
Can I just go back to bed and end the video?

18
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:52,989
Alright guys, thanks so much for watching. I'm gonna go to bed now.

19
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:58,489
Hmm, but this is a mod. This is an amnesia custom story, like I said in the beginning.

20
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,659
Let's just open up this dresser.

21
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,700
Apparently my dry cleaning isn't done. I gotta bring this to the dry cleaner.

22
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,770
I really don't want to leave this room. I don't want to leave the room.

23
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,520
Look at how all trippy this is, man.

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Something's gonna jump out of this door and it's gonna scream at my face.

25
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Because it's all trippy and it's all weird looking.

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,400
Alright, is there anything in here I need, by the way?

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,020
What's on the ground? Can I get this?

28
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,969
No, it's just like a bong.

29
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:33,969
Oh no, one of the guys is all screwed up. He's been smoking like a bunch of weed.

30
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:38,870
Mr. Bonin forced me to drink this potion of insanity.

31
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:46,870
He said that things who live in this house will kill me, but then they won't harass the people in our village nearby.

32
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,370
I'm going insane and I will lose my memory, Mr. Bonin said. What else should I do?

33
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,370
Great, so there's monsters in this house.

34
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,419
God damn it, man.

35
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:03,300
Alright, I'm dilly-dallying way too much. Let's just go outside.

36
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,300
This night is gonna do something weird.

37
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,300
The mental's been added to the journal.

38
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,860
Hit M. Explore the house and find a way to get out.

39
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,620
Easier said than done, okay?

40
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,370
Please don't, like, come after me.

41
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,930
God damn it!

42
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:30,849
Do I have to go just walk down this hall? I don't want to go down this hallway!

43
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:31,849
Let's go.

44
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,849
Please don't jump!

45
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,849
Beware when standing in darkness your sanity will slowly drain. Turn lights on.

46
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:41,289
There are no lights around here.

47
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:44,289
There are no lights around here, man. What's that? Can I, like, break this?

48
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:48,300
I have no idea what that is, but I don't think I can go this way yet.

49
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,199
What about this door that I just opened?

50
00:03:52,199 --> 00:04:00,840
Where am I? Oh, okay, so I can go in here.

51
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,719
There's a ladder.

52
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,719
And a couple barrels.

53
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,240
Is that a lantern?

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
No tinderboxes left.

55
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,250
Should I go up the ladder? Can I open this?

56
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,810
Oh yeah!

57
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,300
Got my lantern. You picked up a lantern and when filled with oil it can be turned on by pressing F.

58
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Oh yeah, I can see.

59
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,300
I can see clearly now the rain is gone.

60
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,980
Let's go.

61
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,750
Can I put the damn lantern back on, please?

62
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,569
That's pretty gross.

63
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:48,889
Are these, like, decapitated body parts?

64
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,449
Look at this cockroach!

65
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,449
This cockroach is friggin' huge!

66
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:56,819
Alright, I got a pig. Where are we going with the pig?

67
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:58,819
I'm gonna bring the pig to, like, dinner.

68
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:02,699
I thought that, like, friggin' thing on the right was a monster.

69
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,699
It's actually just a bunch of leaves.

70
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,220
Get out of here, pig.

71
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,220
There's the key to the basement, I'm assuming.

72
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,839
Picked up the basement's key. Let's go, let's go. Get me out of here.

73
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,939
There we go.

74
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:21,120
Open.

75
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Oh, open that basement door, you son of a bitch.

76
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,120
What the hell was that? Am I really going insane?

77
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,160
I don't know. I hope I'm not going insane.

78
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,790
Oh, the game didn't just crash, did it?

79
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,970
Oh, we were just getting, like, to the good stuff, probably.

80
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,970
And the game, like, no, no, I'm good, I'm good.

81
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:50,740
Okay. Note on the ground.

82
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,740
Somebody read this notice that you have to get out of here.

83
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
The monsters who live here kill everybody who's in the house.

84
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,740
You have to find some keys or tools to open the doors in the torture chambers.

85
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,540
One is in a small room in the middle of the basement.

86
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,540
Maybe you can find some tools in the kitchen.

87
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,540
The doors are very weak, so you can use a hammer or something like that.

88
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,540
People wear the monsters.

89
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,839
Alright, so I gotta break some tools open or something.

90
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,839
Can I open this thing?

91
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,839
Let's go. Let me get in this, like, trap door.

92
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,839
Oh, there's a lot of dead people in there.

93
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,589
Come on, open.

94
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,750
Come on, you physics engine piece of crap.

95
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,250
Wow.

96
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,680
Alright, well, there's a crowbar in here.

97
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,370
Let me get this crowbar.

98
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,370
Dave!

99
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,319
Where am I?

100
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,879
Pull up the lantern, pull up the lantern.

101
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:44,379
Where am I?

102
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:47,379
Get me out of this stupid, get me out of this, like, hellhole.

103
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:51,029
Get me out, get me out, please.

104
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:55,870
Alright, I'm making, like, a bridge to get out of here.

105
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,100
Alright, got out.

106
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Sick.

107
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,660
That was insane.

108
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,660
See, I just cut that, but that really took me, like, 35 minutes to, like, get...

109
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,259
Oh, no, I'm out of lamp oil.

110
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:15,189
Oh, I'm...

111
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:17,189
Is that a person standing there?

112
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,189
That's a person standing right there.

113
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,259
Or is that one of those knights in armor?

114
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,259
I have no idea.

115
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,660
Ah!

116
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,009
Go this way, go this way, go this way, go this way, go this way.

117
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:33,569
This door's locked.

118
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:35,569
Oh, my God, I have no idea what's going on.

119
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:37,870
I don't even know if there's a person here.

120
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,870
What if I hide over here?

121
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:45,540
Oh, my God, I don't have any oil.

122
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,230
What a stupid idiot I am.

123
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,230
I used all my lamp oil trying to figure out how to put boxes on top of each other.

124
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:57,220
It's a monster.

125
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,779
It's a monster.

126
00:07:58,779 --> 00:07:59,779
Where do I go?

127
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,779
Oh!

128
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:09,699
It's a monster right fucking behind me.

129
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:10,699
I don't have any oil.

130
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,459
I don't even know where to go.

131
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,459
I have no idea where to go, guys.

132
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,459
I have no oil.

133
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:17,459
I have no lights.

134
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,819
Can I take the torch from the top of this?

135
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:23,089
Holy God.

136
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:24,089
I have no idea where this is.

137
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,089
Am I in the right spot?

138
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:26,089
I can't light that.

139
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,089
Do I have any oil?

140
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:31,310
What the hell was that?

141
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,309
Give me some oil.

142
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,309
Give me some oil.

143
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,309
What's in this cup?

144
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:38,830
I'm going to throw hot acid in this guy's face.

145
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,830
Eat this.

146
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,460
I have no lamp.

147
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:59,559
There are bodies everywhere.

148
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:04,019
Just eat this, you bastard.

149
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,019
I don't know where to go, and I don't know what to do because I spent like 30 frigging

150
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:13,019
minutes trying to figure out how to put things on top of each other.

151
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:22,340
Oh, my God.

152
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,340
All right.

153
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:29,340
I got back here with lamp oil, and I'm ready to try to go actually and do this.

154
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,220
Yeah.

155
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
I know he's going to come out.

156
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,220
I know.

157
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,740
I know.

158
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
I know.

159
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,740
I know.

160
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,740
Is there anything in here I need to get?

161
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
Is there anything in here I need to get?

162
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,740
That's the real question.

163
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
What do I need to get in here?

164
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,750
I can't open that.

165
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,750
Where is he?

166
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,750
Where is he?

167
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,039
Where is he?

168
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,690
Where is he?

169
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,690
I don't want to run right into him.

170
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,690
Is he behind me?

171
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,690
No.

172
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,120
He's right there.

173
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
He's right there.

174
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,360
Just eat box, you prick.

175
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
All right.

176
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Jump over the bookcase, please.

177
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Thank you.

178
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:10,679
I knew that was there too.

179
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:16,059
Can I hide in here?

180
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:17,059
Get me in here.

181
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:18,059
Get me in here.

182
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:33,480
Oh, let's do it again.

183
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,320
Wait.

184
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Oh, I'm back.

185
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
He's not here.

186
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,259
He's not here this time.

187
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:42,759
Okay.

188
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,759
Okay, cool.

189
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,759
Don't do the lady jumping at me again.

190
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,450
All right.

191
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,309
She's gone.

192
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,309
Oh, I don't know how much lamp oil do I have.

193
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:54,309
What's that?

194
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:55,309
Tinder box.

195
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:57,259
All right.

196
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,259
Light these.

197
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,259
Put this away.

198
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,519
Holy crap, dude.

199
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,519
Anything here I can take?

200
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,519
You need oil or something?

201
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,519
Can I...

202
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,779
What's that?

203
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:07,779
Screwdriver?

204
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:08,779
I don't think I need that.

205
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:09,779
Oh, I'm burping.

206
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,789
Nervous burps.

207
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:12,789
These look like some type of tools.

208
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:15,120
Oh, what's that?

209
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Picked up oil.

210
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,740
All right.

211
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,350
Let's see.

212
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,350
How much oil do I got?

213
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,350
I got a decent amount.

214
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,350
I got a decent amount.

215
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,529
I can hang for a little bit.

216
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,049
Crowbar.

217
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,049
Definitely crowbar the hell out of this wall.

218
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:31,049
Nope.

219
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:32,049
Can't do that.

220
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:34,700
Anything in here?

221
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Don't think so.

222
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
Anything in here?

223
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Just take all the boxes out.

224
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,059
There's got to be something in here for me to like to take.

225
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:40,059
Oh, wow.

226
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:42,259
That whole encounter was just like brain-numbingly horrible.

227
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:46,190
All right.

228
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,190
So I got to find some tools.

229
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,840
Don't, please.

230
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Don't jump at me.

231
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,230
Now that that asshole's gone, I can probably...

232
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,230
Have I gone in here yet?

233
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,230
No, I haven't.

234
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:01,080
I haven't.

235
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
I haven't.

236
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
I haven't.

237
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
I haven't.

238
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
I haven't.

239
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
I haven't.

240
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,379
I haven't.

241
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:08,379
I haven't.

242
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,379
I haven't.

243
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,419
I haven't.

244
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:13,419
I haven't.

245
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:14,419
The crowbar's gone.

246
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:15,980
I can probably...

247
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,919
Have I gone in here yet?

248
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,820
I don't think so.

249
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,820
What's that?

250
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,190
A hollow needle.

251
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,649
Okay.

252
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:32,279
I thought that's where I came from.

253
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:36,289
This is locked, I guess.

254
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,000
Maybe not.

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,759
Can I like open this?

256
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:46,019
Open, you bastard.

257
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,200
I guess not.

258
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Maybe it will.

259
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Maybe I gotta shake it.

260
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,759
Shake the door open.

261
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,860
I can't go in there.

262
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,679
Can I pry the door open with a crowbar maybe?

263
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,519
Let's try that.

264
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,200
There we go.

265
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,259
Let's pry this thing open.

266
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:04,440
Did I get it?

267
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I think I got it.

268
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,039
Oh, I got it, all right.

269
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,000
Maybe I didn't.

270
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,559
What?

271
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,379
Did I open it?

272
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,240
Yeah, okay, I opened it.

273
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,639
Okay.

274
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,779
Rat.

275
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,129
How much lantern oil?

276
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:25,490
Need that lantern oil.

277
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,049
Tender box, okay.

278
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:29,629
I don't need to use the lantern here.

279
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:33,059
Let's go out through this door.

280
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,100
Can I not go out this one?

281
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,399
I need another crowbar?

282
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,549
You kidding me?

283
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:45,120
Maybe there's something else I can grab.

284
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,629
Can I pick this up?

285
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:52,240
Can I smash this wall?

286
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,529
Oh, damn!

287
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:58,710
All right, so I just smashed through this frigging wall.

288
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,110
All right.

289
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,100
Oh, do I really wanna go down here?

290
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,179
Can I even get in here is the question.

291
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:13,960
Oh, and give me this box.

292
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,519
What the hell is even?

293
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,799
This is bad, man.

294
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,799
Something's gonna frigging,

295
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:22,240
like a spider's gonna run down this.

296
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Left or right?

297
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,120
Left or right?

298
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,159
We're gonna go left.

299
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,070
Oh, man.

300
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:30,909
Grr.

301
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,080
I knew it.

302
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,179
I knew it was gonna happen too, and it's still.

303
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:39,759
It doesn't matter.

304
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,690
Can I break through this with the hammer?

305
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,039
What about the needle?

306
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,419
I'm running out of lamp oil, guys.

307
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,269
Running out of lamp oil.

308
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:50,509
I gotta conserve it.

309
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:53,190
I have no idea where I'm going.

310
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,809
Hmm.

311
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:56,730
I need more lamp oil.

312
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,610
We gotta go right.

313
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,450
It's gonna happen again.

314
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,110
Some son of a bitch is gonna pop up right in my face.

315
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,429
Lydianium.

316
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:05,269
Increase your health.

317
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:06,669
Okay, it's health potion.

318
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:08,809
Need to hold on to this lamp oil.

319
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,490
It is pitch black, but you know what?

320
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,820
We gotta make sure we keep that.

321
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,850
What's that?

322
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,230
Anything else I can do over here?

323
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,629
No.

324
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:20,190
Okay, well, I got something to break through

325
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,759
the rest of that door, I think.

326
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,019
I don't know how long it's gonna take me

327
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:25,909
to rage quit this game.

328
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't think it's gonna be very long,

329
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,240
because they just keep throwing shit in my face,

330
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,120
and it's making me wanna die.

331
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,419
Now, let's open this door.

332
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:41,279
Break open.

333
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,909
Okay.

334
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,909
Hello, sweetie.

335
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:50,240
Any lamp oil in here that I can take?

336
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,870
No, that's a sanity potion.

337
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,629
Blood all over the place.

338
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:00,830
And a, huh, huh, huh?

339
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:05,779
What, what, what, what?

340
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:06,620
Yeah?

341
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,440
Hi?

342
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,450
What is this?

343
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,470
What is all over you?

344
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:15,779
No more lamp oil, by the way.

345
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,960
I can't get out of here either?

346
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,929
Oh, damn it.

347
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:24,899
I need more tools.

348
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,399
What else is over here?

349
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,470
Crap.

350
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,889
Oh, duh.

351
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:38,860
What am I thinking?

352
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,059
I still don't have any lamp oil, though.

353
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:45,200
Still, ah!

354
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,480
That guy's not moving, though.

355
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,320
That guy's not moving.

356
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,100
Is that guy, is he friendly?

357
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,340
Can I, like, talk to that guy?

358
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,379
Hey, don't mind me, I'm just, like, in your house.

359
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,220
I'm just, like, looking at some stuff.

360
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,240
Can I pick up the key without you freaking out, man?

361
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,480
Ah, he's right behind me.

362
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,880
Get this stuff out of the way.

363
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,920
Get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way.

364
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:15,000
Open the key and go.

365
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,819
I have to take the, wait, what did that say?

366
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:25,069
Oh, Jesus.

367
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,700
Floating like specters.

368
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,539
Where's the, I need lamp oil.

369
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:32,500
Give it to me.

370
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,490
Where the hell are we?

371
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,809
Oh, I don't, what is that?

372
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:40,019
Get out of my way.

373
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:41,519
We're in water now.

374
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,900
Get out of the way.

375
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,299
So, oh, I thought that was another lantern.

376
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,380
I thought that was another person down here.

377
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,369
Holy shit.

378
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:54,089
Get me on top of something.

379
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,490
Get me out of the water, get me out of the water,

380
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:01,819
get me out of the water, get me out of the freaking water.

381
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,059
Are you serious, dude?

382
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,700
What the hell am I supposed to do here?

383
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,740
All right, we're gonna run for it.

384
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,579
Go.

385
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,089
Run for it, run for it.

386
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:21,579
Get out of the water.

387
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:27,420
Holy crap.

388
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,660
And the bitch is laughing at me now.

389
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,309
Get me, get me on top.

390
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:37,529
Get me on top.

391
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:40,079
Get me, get me, get up.

392
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,640
Get up here, get up here, get up here.

393
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,640
Holy Lord in heaven, find me out of this little area, please.

394
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:52,960
Is that a door?

395
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,519
It's a door.

396
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:59,210
Oh, there's a key in here.

397
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,960
Damn it.

398
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,799
I can make the jumps.

399
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,640
Just gotta make the jumps.

400
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,000
Just don't be such a psycho.

401
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,720
Just make the jumps.

402
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,579
You'll be good to go.

403
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:11,299
Okay, where's the key?

404
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:12,660
Where's the goddamn key?

405
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,180
Ooh, what's that?

406
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,309
I don't know, but I'm jumping over to it.

407
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,910
I think these are Tinder boxes.

408
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,109
Okay, nice.

409
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:28,150
Maybe I can light a frickin' candle now.

410
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,990
Is that a key?

411
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,829
Can't tell.

412
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:31,109
Yeah, there's the key.

413
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:35,029
Okay, a gun.

414
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,670
Wherever that door was, I don't even know where I am,

415
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,230
but I think it was over here.

416
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,220
Yep, it's right here.

417
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:48,900
Let's get the hell out of this friggin' swamp land.

418
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,720
Yes, I did it.

419
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,099
Walking the last few stairs to get outside.

420
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:54,779
Did I beat the game?

421
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,769
I beat the game.

422
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:00,609
What the hell is that?

423
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:01,450
I need to light something.

424
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:06,170
I have Tinder, but give me some oil

425
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,579
so I can get the fuck outta here.

426
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:11,660
Thank God, lamp oil.

427
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,420
Save my life.

428
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,210
Thank, but Jesus.

429
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,640
Hopefully that's not like my friend.

430
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,480
I'm dying, a monster hurts me.

431
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,730
Run to the little house in the forest and call the police.

432
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,809
I think I won't survive, but I hope you do.

433
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:35,069
Take the potion in front of the door to blow it up.

434
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,269
So I blow the door up.

435
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,319
Ah!

436
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,440
What?

437
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,220
What?

438
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,069
What the fuck was that?

439
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:52,869
Is that guy still in here?

440
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:53,869
Is that guy still in here?

441
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:54,710
Is that guy still in here?

442
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,529
Just run.

443
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:57,650
Just call the police.

444
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,079
Call the police, call the police.

445
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,440
Call the police, call the police.

446
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,079
911, what is your emergency?

447
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,519
Yes, hi, my name's Jerma,

448
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,200
and there is a bunch of people running after me,

449
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,039
and I'm trying to get to the house,

450
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,440
so I'm trying to call the police so you can come

451
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,200
and save me.

452
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
Oh, that was a good guy, that ghost was.

453
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,960
You called the police and they burned the house.

454
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,720
You survived.

455
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,329
The ghost helped you escape.

456
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:27,849
All right.

457
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:29,130
All right, I don't know what the hell that was

458
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,900
that came out of the door, but he wasn't there anymore.

459
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,140
Anyways, this has been Amnesia Customs Story.

460
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,539
The name of the custom story has been,

461
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:40,500
I like forget because I'm so like jumbled.

462
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,099
Can't Remember is the name of this custom story.

463
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:46,019
Pretty intense, pretty ridiculous,

464
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:48,500
but I beat the whole thing in one playthrough, so cool.

465
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,980
And I'll see you guys all next time.

466
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,339
Thank you so much for watching,

467
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:54,119
and of course, take care, everybody.
