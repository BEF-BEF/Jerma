1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,720
I didn't realize this was still playing.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,140
One more time, all right.

3
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:24,510
All right, I'll- all right, it's off. I'm turning it off. Hold on.

4
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,039
Oh, you're set, makers.

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,920
I'm not doing it one more time.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:39,439
The next game we're gonna play for an hour or two. Although, who knows?

7
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,880
This might be one of the ones that I don't stop for a while.

8
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:49,039
It's a classic one, my favorite that I ever owned in my whole life, and favorite SNES games ever.

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,719
Vegas Steaks.

10
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,920
Those of you know what that is. It's not Team Fortress, it's not Super Nintendo. It's a casino game. That's right.

11
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:12,500
This game, you gotta get to a million dollars, and if you don't get to a million dollars, then you lose.

12
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:25,459
This game actually is very, very, very good. Let me change the title. Another casino game.

13
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:29,129
It's- it's gonna- I'm telling you, you guys are gonna like this.

14
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:35,730
Random NPCs come up to you in this game, and they like try to take money from you and shit. You're getting, like, fights.

15
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:47,900
Yeah, I'm telling you, you guys are gonna like this. You know, Inc. Never Again? Well, I already did it.

16
00:01:49,180 --> 00:02:16,490
I already did Casino Inc. Let me get this right. All right, what should I title it? Road to a Million Dollars?

17
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:28,949
Road- I'm- it's gonna be Road to a Million. That works for me.

18
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,080
Make it E. Why would I make it just E?

19
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,740
It's not gonna happen.

20
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:45,210
All right, you guys ready? Las Vegas.

21
00:02:48,060 --> 00:03:07,150
Vegas States. Vegas Adventure. When are we going to get there? I'm so tired of riding in this car.

22
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:16,710
Oh, quit complaining. We'll be there soon enough. Well, it'll be nice to stretch my legs and walk around.

23
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm not complaining, just anxious to get there. Blackjack, sloth, roulette, craps, and poker. Which game should I play first?

24
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:31,379
Well, I'm heading right to the poker table. That's where I'll make my riches.

25
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,939
I don't know how to play poker, so I'm not gonna be doing that.

26
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,990
Hope I don't lose my shirt like I did the last time I went to Las Vegas.

27
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:46,259
We're here. Good luck and remember to go out in pairs. It'll be more fun. I don't know how to play poker.

28
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,500
I really don't. Like, I know like the basics of poker, but I don't know how to like look at a guy and be like,

29
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,979
Nah, fuck you. I bluffed you and then I lose a hundred thousand dollars. I don't know how to play.

30
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:01,139
You- all I know about poker is you wear sunglasses and just like- you're like the guy sleeping in the back of class.

31
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:05,939
That's how you be a good poker player. It's just emulate every college student that's sitting in the back.

32
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,659
Welcome to Golden Paradise Hotel. Checking in, please write your name.

33
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,539
Mr.

34
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:20,209
Mr. 23-D-C-T-3-4-5-F-G

35
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,990
Go back. How do I delete characters?

36
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:40,660
How do I delete this?

37
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,740
Mr. How about Mr. Space? Space? Like a ton of spaces.

38
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,769
Mr. L

39
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:12,660
Yes, Mr. L, we certainly have your reservation. I'll show you to your room. Please follow me.

40
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,750
Let's see if anyone wants to come to the casino with me.

41
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,180
How about

42
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:31,600
Cliff, Maria, Isabelle, or Richard? Who wants to go with me to the casino? Richard? How about Richard? Yeah.

43
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,079
I have to call him? We're not staying in the same room? Wait, wait, wait, wait. You guys didn't get a fucking suite?

44
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,860
Separate rooms?

45
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,379
What are you talking about? No, get like a- get like an executive suite. Everybody pull their money together and you get like fucking three bedrooms.

46
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,209
Hello, Richard. How about going to the casino with me?

47
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,339
Richard, wait for me in the lobby. I'll be right there.

48
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,300
All right, here we go. Select game.

49
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:04,939
What do you think we should do first? How about slots? Yeah.

50
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:12,879
All right, $50 slot. How much money do I have? I have $1,000.

51
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:21,600
Okay, that's just $250.

52
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:30,439
I just got something.

53
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,629
That's it?

54
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:42,220
$250, let's go. Give me another seven.

55
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:47,500
All right, I'm out. I'm out. Give me up. I'm out. How do I leave?

56
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
I didn't want to play again. I wanted to know.

57
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,420
No, I wanted to get out. I wanted to leave.

58
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,379
How do you get out? No, stop putting money into the machine and leave.

59
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,029
How can I help you? You got any advice?

60
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:07,709
There's only one way to win a slot machine. Insert a coin, pull a lever. With luck, you'll be a millionaire.

61
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,350
I'll be a- I'll be a millionaire?

62
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,379
Thanks for the advice.

63
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:34,399
What's that? Oops, all berries.

64
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:36,660
Go on, another orange.

65
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,620
That's fucking nothing.

66
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:49,459
Stop, Jeremy. This is my college money. There it is. All right, that's got to be something big.

67
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,220
All right, give me up.

68
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:03,019
Uh, I'm done with this one. I lost $400. It's okay. Let's go. We're gonna go. We're doing

69
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,649
Blackjack.

70
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:08,769
I actually kind of know how to play craps a little bit. Not really that much, but I know a little bit.

71
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:11,329
Max bet $250 to Blackjack.

72
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:21,519
At the start of this, I'll be a fucking idiot. At least you bet. I want to bet

73
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,389
$50.

74
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,230
Give me a hand. What do we got?

75
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,509
20.

76
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,470
Stay.

77
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:38,159
13, 20. This push gets the fuck out of here.

78
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,899
No, I'm staying on a 20. Why would he? Why would you? I'm not gonna hit it. I don't care. That's 20.

79
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,389
Just can't stay on 20. Why would you? I'm not hitting it. Why would I hit with the- No, what are you crazy?

80
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:57,889
You stand here too.

81
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:09,440
Uh, I've come to the realization the chat does not understand Blackjack. People don't know how to play this game, but don't worry.

82
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,519
Um, this is actually how you play Blackjack and you'll get corrected if you ever play.

83
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,720
Uh, this is basic strategy Blackjack. That's what it's called.

84
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,240
And uh, if the dealer has a four-five or a six,

85
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,759
is it- I'm talking to zoomers. Uh, sorry.

86
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,080
No, I'm not.

87
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,620
Why did you say that? I think I'm not talking to zoom. See, right? Just stand. Just take it. See, that's-

88
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,860
That's a 67% chance that he's gonna lose.

89
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:43,090
It's like probably 20 zoomers in this chat. Maybe. The rest of you are fucking doctors and shit.

90
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,090
You should know what I'm talking about. $250. Let's go. Big one.

91
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:50,539
It's horrible. All right. Should I split the twos? I guess the 10?

92
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,779
What do you think?

93
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:55,980
Split twos against the 10? That would be the worst thing ever.

94
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:05,120
Okay, we're gonna hit.

95
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Give me 18.

96
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,799
All right, stay on. I have to- I should have hit on that one.

97
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,899
Okay, uh, I don't know what happened. 20 fucking one. Give me a break.

98
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,279
See, what I did right there is you never do that.

99
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,159
Uh, that was the dumbest thing ever. I was doing it for a stream joke and I ended up losing all my money. Big one.

100
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,360
Let's go.

101
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,950
13 against a five. Don't do anything.

102
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,210
If you have a 12 or over, don't do anything.

103
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,440
As you see, again, people don't get this. People don't understand.

104
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,879
If the deal is showing a five or a six, especially a six,

105
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:51,309
if you have a 12 or more, do not do anything. Stand. Don't hit. Don't be like,

106
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,309
well, I would have hit and then you bust and you lose.

107
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,559
No, you don't. No, no, you- that- you- this is how you- that's how you play blackjack.

108
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,860
Not if your cards count. Well, that person's gonna get thrown out of the casino. Let's fucking split.

109
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,539
I have- wait, how much money do I have?

110
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:17,519
I can't- how could I split this? I only had 250. Doesn't make any sense.

111
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,039
Let's take a card here.

112
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:29,549
Nope!

113
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:34,159
So, I lost 250.

114
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:38,610
You just did what you said not to do. No, a four, five, or a six.

115
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,019
All right, I'm gonna get it all back.

116
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:51,549
Here it is. This is bad. Insurance. No, it's fucking- that is my- that's the blackjack, right?

117
00:11:52,269 --> 00:12:03,179
Okay, here we go. Come back. Just count cards. And now I know you guys don't- don't play blackjack.

118
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,980
You guys know that most decks have like eight decks.

119
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:12,539
Like between like six and eight decks is what people like to play. Good luck counting fucking like 500 cards.

120
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,379
By the way, get out. Kicked out of that- kicked that fucking person out of the casino.

121
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:26,960
All right. So, uh, where's the uh-

122
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:35,419
Where's the ATM? Why did I hit against a 10?

123
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,230
Yeah, that's a joke. Okay. That's a funny joke.

124
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,340
Uh, Gerber, we've been here for

125
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,580
10 minutes and you are- we- you know, we have like, uh, the hotel booked for four days, right?

126
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,440
Yeah, I'll just take a walk. I'll just- I'll just take a walk every day.

127
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:18,929
I gotta get that million, man. I think you actually like level up and shit. All right, just don't- no huge bets.

128
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:32,210
Need a new name here.

129
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,649
Mr.

130
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:58,000
Not Mr. L. This is- no, Mr. L is- is- Mr. Loss is more like it. No, no, no, no, no. Green. That's me. Greg Green.

131
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,779
Mr. Greg Green. God.

132
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,299
Let's see if anyone- okay. Richard was a bad- Richard was bad luck. We're gonna bring, uh-

133
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:11,179
Let's go with Maria.

134
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:13,419
Maria- no.

135
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:23,539
Yeah. Greg Green is the greedy Grinner's alter ego.

136
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:28,769
That's me in the lobby. All right. Here we go.

137
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,750
Select game. We're gonna do- gonna go to roulette.

138
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:42,100
Okay, no monster bets. Just play it well. What numbers? What am I choosing, guys?

139
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,289
All right. Always- always double zero.

140
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,759
Double zero. A hundred- no.

141
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,000
Twenty dollars on double zero.

142
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,620
And then we're gonna do, uh-

143
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,899
We're gonna do- can I do like corner bets in this?

144
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,259
Can you kind of go right? Okay. And then 13, 14, 16, 17.

145
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,149
Hundred bucks on the line. Let's go.

146
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:18,379
How do I say yes go? How do I say yes?

147
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:34,690
Ready. How do I say yes? Okay. Mr. Green, have you finished your bet? Yes, I have.

148
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:45,340
Let's go. Is that four?

149
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,259
Four black?

150
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:56,259
Anyway, all right. It's all right. You go- you go with the same strategy.

151
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,759
Same strategy right here. 13, 14, 16, 17. Hundred bucks. Get it on there.

152
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
Double zero. Zero and double zero.

153
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,919
Twenty bucks on each one.

154
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,429
Go for it. Let's go.

155
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,909
Mr. Green? I'm ready. 13, 14, 16, 17. Let's go.

156
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:21,500
The corner somewhere. Right here. 26. All right.

157
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:29,779
Just put one in every spot.

158
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,769
Dude, just put like a dollar on every number.

159
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:42,289
And then just sit there and stare while you don't win or lose anything.

160
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,899
You just are annoying.

161
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,679
No, you have to-

162
00:16:51,679 --> 00:17:19,009
If you did this at the casino, it would be like, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir. Stop, stop, stop.

163
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,750
What? I just want to make sure I win.

164
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:38,720
All right. Mr. Green?

165
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,220
Are you finished betting?

166
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,940
Yep. I'm ready. Spin that wheel.

167
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:55,970
Did I?

168
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,329
What? Okay. I was gonna say no way.

169
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,829
It cost $20.

170
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:12,099
Give me that all back. Thank you.

171
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Now, here's the real fucking play. Mr. Green knows how to play roulette.

172
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,660
$40

173
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,420
on half the number.

174
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,819
And there's a 50-50 chance for you to make it back.

175
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:49,259
Now, don't call me Mr. Green for nothing. Spin it. Don't ever doubt Mr. Green.

176
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,700
And then I do a full cigar in one drag.

177
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:00,029
I won $720.

178
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:06,190
How's your luck, Fred? Mr. Green? Mine's been awful. Mind if I hang out with you for a while?

179
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,680
Get out of here, you fucking loser.

180
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Well, that's okay. I think I'll just try someone else.

181
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,660
Copy the green strategy. Not on my watch.

182
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,430
Skip every number. Every other number.

183
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:39,299
See, right now there's like a group of like maybe 10 people have uh congregated behind me.

184
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:42,660
And like

185
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,599
I mean, they might be taking pictures of me and shit like like this is this guy's a fucking psycho. You know what I mean?

186
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,430
All right.

187
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,430
Hey, and just good luck.

188
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:07,420
All right, spin it. And the smoke comes out of my ears.

189
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,519
Mr. Green, you've won $640.

190
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:30,930
Thank you.

191
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:33,009
Oh, I can't put it all on red.

192
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,720
Sorry about that. It's Mr. Green sometimes. I'm out of your drink.

193
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:49,630
You know what?

194
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:55,170
Take my money somewhere else.

195
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,569
Let's take this to the slots. No. Blackjack.

196
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,170
$50 just came in 5,000 bits from Lesbian Bigfoot.

197
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,269
Thanks for the $50.

198
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,869
And they say, Jerma, today was my payday, so I thought I'd toss a couple bucks of your way.

199
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:19,230
You can use it on a couple more Funkos for your gamer room. Also, I know how much you hate playing Nancy Drew.

200
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:24,430
But I've had one request in the world. It would be that you play Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake from the series.

201
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,230
My sisters and I used to play those games all the time, and watching you play the games you did reminded me

202
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,630
of the fun we all used to have.

203
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,950
Thanks as always to the great content, Drew Crew Forever.

204
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:41,789
I'm such a w- I'm such a klutz. I sprained my ankle. I hate to ask, but Mr. Green,

205
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,269
would you please take me to the emergency room?

206
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:56,509
Who is the- why? Why me?

207
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,700
Can you imagine if I'm like a big high roller and I got a big crowd around me?

208
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:06,460
Like, wow, Mr. Green, that's another $100. Whoa.

209
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,980
All right, and like you push through this crowd. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, what is it? Yeah, what do you need?

210
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,380
Can you take me to the ER?

211
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,539
Can you sub- how many people did you push through?

212
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:27,920
And I'll tell you, you got gumption. You got gumption. No one's ever done that before. Get in the car. Let's go.

213
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:36,829
No one's ever fucking dressed me that way. Mr. Green took that person to the emergency room.

214
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,690
What?

215
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,890
That's it?

216
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:54,269
Let's go. 13 versus- yeah, I gotta hit, hit, hit, hit, hit.

217
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,700
Oh, I gotta hit again.

218
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,420
Okay, now you stay. He's gonna flip over 10. It don't matter. I lose anyways.

219
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:13,359
Oh, yeah. Mr. Green, you're so kind. Accept this gift I won at the slot machine.

220
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:21,420
Give me a thousand dollars?

221
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,420
Let's go. Uh, just spend her money.

222
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,339
Blackjack. Oh!

223
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:31,950
There it is. Blackjack.

224
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:36,269
Yeah, 3,500 bucks. Going pretty well. Do it again.

225
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,460
Nine, give me- oh, come on.

226
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
No, why would I double this?

227
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:45,660
Against a nine, that's stupid. Just hit. Take the card. Give me 10.

228
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:49,099
All right, I stay.

229
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:58,480
Flip over- oh, you motherfucker. Poor shit.

230
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,769
Remember, this is- we're spending her money right now. Blackjack again.

231
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,609
13 versus Jack. That sucks. Uh, I'm probably gonna lose.

232
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,980
Oh, that's even more annoying.

233
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:14,750
That's even more annoying that I probably have to take another card, but I can't.

234
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,160
I can't after three.

235
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:23,470
If I take- if you got three small cards like that, what the fuck, man?

236
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,549
Like eventually, I'm gonna get a monster card.

237
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:28,829
How's your luck been, Mr. Green? Mine's been awful. Mind if I hang out with you?

238
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,660
Yeah, sure. B.F. Bugleberry.

239
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:37,779
You can sit right here. You are always welcome.

240
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:47,710
Hope I can pick up some pointers.

241
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:54,369
You want to bet this? Yes.

242
00:24:57,549 --> 00:24:58,509
11.

243
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:01,230
Ah, versus 10. That's so stupid.

244
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:13,220
This is dumb. This would be like a gasp at the table if I doubled down right here. Jesus Christ.

245
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:23,089
Well, I hope-

246
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:27,170
I hope some of your luck rubbed off on me. See you later.

247
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:35,019
I felt a bump when the loser walked past you. Check your pocket. Everything was okay.

248
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,539
Why is he a loser?

249
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:41,339
I didn't call him a loser. The game's calling him a loser.

250
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:49,119
Blackjack.

251
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:55,329
Ah! Not 20, anyway.

252
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,160
Mr. Green.

253
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
Mr. Green.

254
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:13,119
Your luck didn't rub off. I won $15,000 on that slot machine. I can't forget my lucky charm. I want you to have this

255
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,900
$5,000.

256
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,200
Holy shit.

257
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:25,019
Some voice. What are you talking about?

258
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:32,589
This isn't right. This is wrong. This really isn't my voice. This is my voice.

259
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:49,119
All right, dude, I got $8,000 right now. Fuck you. I have to hit again. Oh, that's how you get it done at the table.

260
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:54,660
All right, get up. Let's go. Out.

261
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,660
What do I got? I got fucking 8,500 bucks. Out.

262
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,720
Game's really loud.

263
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,500
I can exit the casino.

264
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Should I go? Well, I'm gonna return to the room.

265
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:19,579
Just hang out in the room for a little bit. Go gambling with another friend. Save your scores and

266
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,980
let's go with another friend.

267
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,740
Get room service?

268
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,420
All right, Cliff. Let's go. Let's go, Cliff.

269
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:31,779
Keep your 8.5k.

270
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,140
This is road to a million. Not road to 8.5k.

271
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:50,529
Select game. Let's go. All right. Let's do. All right. How do you play poker? Does somebody help me?

272
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:55,839
$200 minimum. Maximum. It's easy.

273
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,980
Everyone's got 10 grand. Anti. 20. Minimum is 20. Maximum is 20.

274
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:05,619
Press A button to anti up.

275
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,779
All right. Anti up.

276
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:14,859
So do we all get five cards? This is gonna take forever.

277
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,240
I got a seven. I got a two. I got hearts.

278
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,519
At 20. All right. This is what I don't understand about poker.

279
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
This shit here.

280
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,599
Like bet. Raise. Call. Check. I don't know what that stuff means.

281
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:38,900
Um, what does call mean? It's an awful hand.

282
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,859
Call means like I don't want to raise.

283
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:50,130
Hold.

284
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,130
It means call your mother. It means

285
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:55,890
the call means you put the same amount that they did.

286
00:28:57,339 --> 00:28:59,740
Oh wait, the bugleberry's over there. He's using some of that money.

287
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:08,099
It's equal to current bet. Okay.

288
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:14,720
Call. Call. Call. Call. Call. So what does check mean?

289
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:23,650
No bet. Do nothing.

290
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:28,079
Don't bet anything.

291
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,240
I want to play. I want to participate.

292
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,460
What's the pot worth?

293
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,240
This dude's got two fours.

294
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:43,410
Hey, we got we got a pair over there.

295
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,319
Call. Call. Can I? Can I?

296
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:05,259
Can I hurry up?

297
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:07,259
Wait a minute. I thought you weren't supposed to

298
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,940
like

299
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,940
show emotions.

300
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,220
That's that guy's got like a royal flush.

301
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:28,799
This is getting to be five hundred dollars.

302
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,029
Why don't you guys make me fold? That that that was a chance.

303
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,759
Is anybody gonna they keep doing this?

304
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:44,029
Get a straight straight. Uh, yeah, of course.

305
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:46,269
What did he just win?

306
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:50,190
He just won 4100 bucks. Ha ha ha. I won. I won. Look at this pot.

307
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:53,309
All right. I lost 20 bucks. Let's do it again.

308
00:30:54,670 --> 00:31:03,599
Anyhow, this game's not even played anymore.

309
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,490
Yeah, Texas Hold'em is the one that's this at every casino now.

310
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,359
But this also sucks.

311
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:14,049
I'm staying in. I'm just gonna bluff the fuck out of everybody.

312
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:28,019
Raise a thousand dollars.

313
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,740
Raise 200.

314
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,619
Okay, go ahead and spin it around.

315
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:37,490
Yeah.

316
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,490
All right. What you don't know is I have pocket aces.

317
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,400
Call. Okay.

318
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:50,990
All right. Leave that queen. Oh fuck. That guy's got

319
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,940
Uh-oh.

320
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,779
Raise it again.

321
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:58,779
Maybe next time I fold.

322
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,000
Call.

323
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,009
Look at this dog shit hand.

324
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,990
I'm I just tried to scare everybody.

325
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:19,180
No, he's got I no no no no no that guy probably has like a three of a kind. I'm out.

326
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,859
This dude's got a three of a kind. He's probably has three jacks.

327
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,579
Yeah, who knows that guy could have a a flush.

328
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:44,460
No, I can't like just pretend. I mean look at he's look at how happy he is again. He's probably got like a

329
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:53,059
No, he's back to normal.

330
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:57,980
I want to see one of them get excited.

331
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,789
Raise 100.

332
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:05,140
Raise 100.

333
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,130
Call.

334
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:11,779
Call.

335
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:14,589
All right. What do you got?

336
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:17,809
I got 100. This looks like I want this money.

337
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:28,109
He only had two pair. Whatever. Two pair. Two pair. Two pair.

338
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,750
This is bullshit. I won. Look at this pile of chips and they're mine. Whatever.

339
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:35,009
Let's do it again.

340
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:40,539
I had shit. Yeah, I keep getting why am I the only person who gets bad cards? Not fair.

341
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:45,339
Leave the table. No, no, no, no, no, no, not yet. All right, come on.

342
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,980
I'm not gonna fold this time.

343
00:33:53,980 --> 00:34:01,730
Yeah, see you later. Get out.

344
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:16,780
Give me another. Give me a jack. That's I could get a flush here.

345
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:23,150
Check. What? Yeah, zero. Uh, wait. Hold on. What did I do?

346
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:37,679
Call. 50 dollars. Should I call that? Raise 20.

347
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,440
All right. Call. Call.

348
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,760
All right. Call. Call.

349
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,099
Can you just go around the table and just keep saying call, call, call, call until the cards come out?

350
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,579
Holy shit.

351
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:06,940
Get out. Good.

352
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:10,449
My secret is to know when to hold them and when to fold them. What about you?

353
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,480
I can't keep it. I can't keep up now. You can't because they all that's so they all saw the fucking they saw the royal flush.

354
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,539
That's a 900 dollar.

355
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:28,900
Wait, oh.

356
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:35,380
All right. Last one.

357
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,539
900 by the way. Yeah, well they had to take taxes out.

358
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,139
Got an ace.

359
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:48,639
I do have an ace.

360
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:51,679
Fold with an ace? No, no. I'm gonna get another ace.

361
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:55,070
Raise.

362
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,190
50 bucks.

363
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:06,880
Lower the game audio? I will. After this pan.

364
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,130
Ace.

365
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:22,139
All right, I'm leaving.

366
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:25,539
All right. Now we're gonna take this to the slot.

367
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,710
Well, should I play a crap? I know I have a very very basic understanding of crap.

368
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:37,099
How about just leave the table?

369
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:47,570
Sit on the toilet.

370
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:54,420
Fuck. Leave this casino. Go to a different casino.

371
00:36:57,139 --> 00:37:00,340
Go to a different casino. All right. I I don't want to see how happy they are that they're winning.

372
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:14,179
I want to go.

373
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:16,659
Why is it? It's because John he wins every time. Oh, no.

374
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:28,400
Carol wasn't all that difficult. Maybe next time I beat you. I'm so sorry to ask you for a favor, but I desperately need some cash.

375
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,119
Would you like to buy this diamond? I guarantee it is worth quite a bit. It's been appraised for five thousand dollars.

376
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,519
How much will you give me for it?

377
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,380
All right, I'll make him an offer.

378
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,139
Five thousand you say, huh?

379
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:46,699
Give you ten dollars to get the fuck away from me and stop talking to me and my friends.

380
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,940
About four thousand. Ten dollars.

381
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,150
Maybe you give me a little more. How about thirty six hundred?

382
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,219
Ten.

383
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:00,219
Dollars.

384
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,130
How about thirty two hundred?

385
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,739
Ten.

386
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:07,260
Fucking.

387
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,619
Dollars.

388
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,989
Can you give me a little more? How about twenty eight hundred?

389
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,530
Ten.

390
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,699
Dollars.

391
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:18,780
Can you give me a little more? How about twenty five hundred?

392
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,980
You're going to only get

393
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:24,699
ten fucking dollars.

394
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:27,739
Ah, what a pain.

395
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:42,860
God, some people. Let's get out of here. All right, I'm gonna pee. I'll be right back.

396
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,789
I'm full of piss today. Sorry.

397
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:51,469
Oh, mute. Oh.

398
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,179
See this.

399
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:57,340
It is. It is. The music's kind of annoying.

400
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:01,900
I'm gonna drop it. Here we go. I don't know if that's any better.

401
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:08,210
Better? Is it better?

402
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:50,159
I'll be right back.

403
00:39:50,159 --> 00:40:54,380
Screen is back.

404
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,380
Uh, exit casino.

405
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:00,579
Can you go to different casinos? Is that how this works?

406
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,860
Exit casino.

407
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,869
Exit casino.

408
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:11,619
Can I go to a different one?

409
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:12,739
Oh shit.

410
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:15,940
Which casino should we visit? Whoa, the 2020.

411
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:19,570
We have to go to the 2020. It's the current year.

412
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,119
Oh, check it out. This one has a sci-fi atmosphere.

413
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,960
Yeah, let's go.

414
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
2020. The 2020.

415
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:43,250
That's so weird.

416
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,489
Holy, this music is gonna drive me nuts.

417
00:41:46,130 --> 00:42:05,380
Oh, no, there's a higher minimum. There's a higher max. Oh, no.

418
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,739
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty, five hundred dollars for a spin.

419
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,389
Come on.

420
00:42:17,389 --> 00:42:20,909
Oh.

421
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:26,769
One more. That's it. I'm done.

422
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:27,650
Come on.

423
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,639
Okay. Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's fine.

424
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,460
All right.

425
00:42:38,460 --> 00:43:00,539
Oh shit. What was that?

426
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:10,130
All right. Let's play craps. I know very little of them.

427
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,289
All right. I'm gonna do a thousand dollar craps. Here we go.

428
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:13,650
I'm gonna fucking destroy this.

429
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:17,250
So I'm gonna put...

430
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:21,059
If I remember how craps works, I'm gonna...

431
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,460
The whole thing with craps is you don't want to roll a seven.

432
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:27,409
I'm gonna put a thousand dollars on the pass line.

433
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:29,010
Let's go.

434
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,610
And then I'm gonna put...

435
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:37,579
And these are bets that if this shows up, if you get double sixes, right?

436
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,500
Then you just get this payout.

437
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,500
Pass is the best out. Yeah, I know.

438
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,260
And these are sucker bets. This is 30 to one for snake eyes.

439
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,340
Can I do a thousand dollar sucker bet and make fucking 30 grand?

440
00:43:54,219 --> 00:44:00,769
All right. How about 50 dollar sucker bet?

441
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:05,500
Looking for two ones.

442
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,219
All right. I'm good.

443
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:14,800
I'm done.

444
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,360
No seven.

445
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,300
Six.

446
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,880
Yeah, there we go.

447
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,570
Too bad I didn't pay that.

448
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:29,900
Yeah, because of the fucking bet over there.

449
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:34,300
Okay. Now, if a six shows up...

450
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:36,980
Wait, hold on.

451
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,420
I'm trying to remember how this works.

452
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,920
All right. Now I want to...

453
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,320
Now I'm...

454
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,920
Okay. You're gonna land on a fucking four.

455
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,260
I can't bet here. Why not?

456
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:52,480
Yeah. Okay. I want to...

457
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,320
500 bucks and you're gonna fucking be hitting fours all day.

458
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,920
If a six shows before a seven, you win.

459
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,679
Right.

460
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:02,420
Okay. Good.

461
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:06,050
I'm gonna throw a four right now.

462
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,039
Nine.

463
00:45:12,219 --> 00:45:13,179
Nobody wins. Nobody...

464
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:13,579
He's gonna...

465
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:14,460
Come on.

466
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,179
Let's see a four.

467
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,730
Stay.

468
00:45:18,269 --> 00:45:25,469
The sucker bet.

469
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:26,989
I was gonna put a hundred dollars on that.

470
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:33,699
Do that four.

471
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:35,239
Six.

472
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:36,420
There we go.

473
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,389
That's it. I win.

474
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:40,190
Bingo.

475
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:43,980
Thousand bucks.

476
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,699
Keep going.

477
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:46,940
The thing about craps is you can just keep going.

478
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:51,730
Thousand bucks on the pass line.

479
00:45:57,659 --> 00:45:59,420
God damn it. I was gonna do that too.

480
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,099
I was gonna do one of these moron bets.

481
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:13,380
How's your luck been, Mr. Green?

482
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,110
Mr. Green, how's your luck been?

483
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,150
Oh, mine's been awful.

484
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,969
I have $15,000 I want.

485
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:21,170
Can I hang out with you again?

486
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:22,690
Sure.

487
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,269
Thank you. I hope I can pick up some more pointers from you.

488
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:27,070
I blew it out.

489
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:28,590
Hey, sit down.

490
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:38,800
No.

491
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,760
Give me a fucking break.

492
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,260
Okay.

493
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:53,380
Thank God.

494
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,019
Well, I hope some of your luck rubbed off on me.

495
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:56,820
I'll see you later.

496
00:46:59,389 --> 00:46:59,889
Oof.

497
00:47:00,269 --> 00:47:01,789
Bugleberry bumps into you as they walk by.

498
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:03,389
You check your pockets and everything is fine.

499
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:05,630
Go on, Bugleberry.

500
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,949
Go hit a fucking hundred million dollars.

501
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:11,670
Again.

502
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:16,960
Yes.

503
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,969
Don't hit a seven.

504
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:30,610
No sevens, no sevens, no sevens.

505
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:34,030
Oh, Mr. Green, you'll never believe it.

506
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:36,110
Your luck rubbed off on me again.

507
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:39,469
I want another $15,000 on a smart machine.

508
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,389
I can't forget you again.

509
00:47:41,389 --> 00:47:43,070
I gotta give you five grand again.

510
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:46,110
It's $10,000 in two days.

511
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:49,260
Hey, thanks for the $5,000.

512
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:49,820
And guess what?

513
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,539
Now I'm back up, oh boy, before I even walked in the fucking door.

514
00:47:53,179 --> 00:48:02,110
Back to roulette.

515
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,789
Back to roulette.

516
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:04,429
$1,000.

517
00:48:04,429 --> 00:48:04,909
We're going...

518
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,340
Okay, this is where we...

519
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:11,409
You're gonna think I'm fucking nuts.

520
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,650
You're gonna think I'm nuts.

521
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:16,690
I'm saying $1920, $22, $23, right in the middle.

522
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,369
$1,000.

523
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:19,090
Let it ride, go.

524
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:36,219
That was Bugleberry money.

525
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:37,179
Who cares?

526
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:39,489
That's all right.

527
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:40,449
I'm doing it one more time.

528
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:41,489
This is Bugleberry money.

529
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,070
Again, $1920, $22, $23.

530
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:54,289
$1920, $22, $23.

531
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:56,199
Oh.

532
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,400
Ah.

533
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,239
Ah, it was right there.

534
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:02,820
Right next to $19.

535
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,500
Oh.

536
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,809
$1920, $22, $23.

537
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:23,309
$18, you motherfucker.

538
00:49:23,309 --> 00:49:24,190
You gotta be kidding me.

539
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:36,699
$1920, $22, $23.

540
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,260
If I don't hit, I'm out.

541
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:39,980
Back to the slot.

542
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:57,820
Right, it lands on the one right next to it.

543
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,780
Put every cent that I have on $9, $8, and $5.

544
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:30,400
Ah, fuck.

545
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,119
Shit.

546
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,170
Mr. Green.

547
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,130
Mr. Green.

548
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:43,730
Mr. Green, are you all right?

549
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:46,210
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

550
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:49,070
Let it roll again.

551
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:52,190
And listen, don't ask me how I'm doing after this.

552
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:53,789
Just leave me alone.

553
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,019
And another drink.

554
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,019
If I could get one, it'd be really good.

555
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:05,389
Mr. Green.

556
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:05,889
Yep.

557
00:51:06,989 --> 00:51:08,190
That's a three.

558
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,630
Yeah, I can read.

559
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:20,130
Place your bets.

560
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,730
I'm telling you, I love this guy.

561
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:22,610
There's a guy I watch.

562
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:23,650
He's a live streamer.

563
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,949
He's really, really lucky.

564
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,150
It has to hit it at some point

565
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,400
because this guy just makes noises on the internet

566
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,840
and he's the master fortune.

567
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,760
He's got to be the luckiest person in the fucking world.

568
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,679
Mr. Green knows all.

569
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,239
Fortune.

570
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:03,650
What?

571
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:05,969
That's four times in a row?

572
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,690
An alien who's just in here

573
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,489
and just speared through my chest.

574
00:52:18,929 --> 00:52:19,730
Fuck, that hurts.

575
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:25,809
This is an alien from Aliens Vibes.

576
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,650
Just boom, bam, through my chest.

577
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:39,920
Let's go, 985.

578
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:50,269
Oh my god, ace right there.

579
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:56,260
God damn it.

580
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,590
Well, here's my last.

581
00:52:58,590 --> 00:52:59,630
Hey, Bugleberry.

582
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,230
Do you need any more luck?

583
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:02,269
Where's Bugleberry?

584
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:03,230
Can I have some more money?

585
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:06,670
He's losing his two.

586
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:08,659
All right, everything on four.

587
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:14,670
Everything on four.

588
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,940
Fucking piece of shit.

589
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:43,469
Mr. Green, thank you for your stay at the 2020.

590
00:53:43,469 --> 00:53:44,190
Yep.

591
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,889
How'd you do?

592
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:48,840
Yep.

593
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:50,429
Oh.

594
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:50,929
Yeah.

595
00:53:51,329 --> 00:54:06,800
Jerma sucks at this game.

596
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,360
Jerma sucks at gambling.

597
00:54:11,969 --> 00:54:14,610
No, I have to, I have to get, I want to be,

598
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,409
I want to get transferred to the executive suite.

599
00:54:17,409 --> 00:54:27,400
They're just kept playing half the numbers.

600
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:37,809
Mr. Green, you're back.

601
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:38,369
I'm back.

602
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:44,610
How about Mr. Green's?

603
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:50,130
I changed my name to make sure I, yeah, Mr. Green's.

604
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,559
Stop wasting your money on gambling.

605
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:58,079
Tax fraud.

606
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,989
See, I changed my name every two or three years.

607
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:03,030
Just add a couple of letters.

608
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:11,960
It makes me able to, hold on, wait, we need,

609
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,920
why am I talking like this?

610
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:16,360
All right, safe plays only.

611
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,079
We're going to make it.

612
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:30,599
I'm going to get, I got across the $10,000 threshold after.

613
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:31,320
Different casino.

614
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,349
You just ruined three people's lives.

615
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:37,590
What's another bankrupt person?

616
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,909
Okay, let's go to the Buffalo Head.

617
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:43,889
Let's make a killing in the Old West.

618
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:51,699
Easy Godina Crunch is the worst item ever.

619
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,019
You're just trying to get me to be angry with you?

620
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:55,300
Sound weird.

621
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:06,500
All right, here we go.

622
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:12,769
Face your bets.

623
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:17,199
Hey, Mr. Green's, do you remember me?

624
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,900
Uh, yeah, from poker.

625
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,260
Your face seems a little familiar.

626
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,510
I bet you thought you'd never see me again.

627
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:30,389
Thank, thanks for being so nice to me.

628
00:56:30,389 --> 00:56:31,750
I appreciate it so much.

629
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:32,630
I'd like to give you that.

630
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:35,190
What I've won here tonight is here's $2,000.

631
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,789
Oh, wait, no, this is the emergency room.

632
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:39,519
Oh, nice.

633
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:44,280
She knows your identity.

634
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,039
All right, this is Stephanie money.

635
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:48,679
This isn't even mine.

636
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,789
Bye, Jack.

637
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:52,920
Fuck.

638
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:56,179
Damn it.

639
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,219
I had to do it.

640
00:56:57,219 --> 00:57:06,679
This is Stephanie money.

641
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:08,820
14.

642
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:09,460
Fuck you.

643
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,340
Stay on.

644
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,059
It's just a six.

645
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:12,179
It's gonna, you're gonna bust it.

646
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:13,400
Boink.

647
00:57:14,019 --> 00:57:15,699
Oh, you got fucking 21.

648
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:19,139
There's like a 10% chance that you would get 21 with a six.

649
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:21,570
Unbelievable.

650
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:22,530
That's bullshit.

651
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:23,329
This is Stephanie money.

652
00:57:23,329 --> 00:57:23,829
Who cares?

653
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:25,909
19.

654
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:26,309
There we go.

655
00:57:27,989 --> 00:57:31,889
All right.

656
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:35,300
Good, good.

657
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,099
All right, do it again.

658
00:57:36,739 --> 00:57:40,130
Mr. Greens, I'm down on my luck.

659
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:41,969
Would you like to purchase my lottery ticket?

660
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:44,050
The payoff is $10,000.

661
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:49,440
It cost $1,000, but I will sell it to you for $500.

662
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:55,400
Yeah, sure.

663
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,280
This is Stephanie money.

664
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:56,780
Who cares?

665
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,690
Thanks a lot.

666
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,050
I'm sure that ticket's a winner.

667
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:00,550
Good luck.

668
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:04,360
What if it is?

669
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:10,440
No.

670
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:24,210
The winning lottery number is 98985?

671
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,570
98955.

672
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:27,760
You checked your ticket.

673
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,280
98955.

674
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,039
I just won $10,000.

675
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:36,789
This is Stephanie money.

676
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:37,289
Who cares?

677
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:38,949
Yes, finally.

678
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,630
Four versus.

679
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:41,510
Oh, no, no, no.

680
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,090
21 again.

681
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,409
You can't be fucking serious.

682
00:58:49,409 --> 00:58:56,929
I'm so sorry to ask you for a favor, but I desperately need some cash.

683
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,570
Would you like to buy this diamond?

684
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,409
I guarantee it's worth quite a bit.

685
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,119
How much were you willing to pay for it?

686
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:13,059
You know, there was another guy that used to come around here.

687
00:59:13,059 --> 00:59:15,219
And talk about his diamond.

688
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:25,539
I'll give you 100, 100, 100.

689
00:59:25,539 --> 00:59:32,179
This is fucking Stephanie money.

690
00:59:32,179 --> 00:59:32,739
Who gives a shit?

691
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:34,820
Seven.

692
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,800
Eighteen.

693
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,300
Stand.

694
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,280
I don't do it.

695
00:59:54,849 --> 00:59:55,969
Fifteen versus six.

696
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:57,409
Just fucking stay with this.

697
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:02,130
That's fucking unbelievable.

698
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,090
I hate this.

699
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:03,969
I hate this.

700
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:11,159
The coward play.

701
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:12,710
Whatever.

702
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,440
What the fuck is happening?

703
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:23,960
That's 212121212121.

704
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:33,269
Fuck you.

705
01:00:33,269 --> 01:00:33,909
I have to do it.

706
01:00:36,139 --> 01:00:37,119
What do you got under there?

707
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:37,619
Yeah, of course.

708
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:40,840
This table's fucked.

709
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,320
I'm out.

710
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,000
This casino I'm out out.

711
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,170
I'm out of here.

712
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:53,510
Maria, let's get the fuck out of here.

713
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:55,030
I let's go to another place.

714
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,269
This place fucking stacks their decks.

715
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,360
Let's go to the golden parrot.

716
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,559
No, let's go to the hideaway.

717
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,760
Hideaway club.

718
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,199
This place looks pretty run down.

719
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:10,639
We should make it our last resort.

720
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,769
You sure you want to go here?

721
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,920
Golden paradise, isn't that where I was?

722
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:26,659
This one seems okay. Which is the one that I started at?

723
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:37,539
Golden Corral? Go to Pasta Italiano.

724
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:42,320
All right, here we go. Let's see what I got. Slots.

725
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:50,519
What do we got? 50. All right. Now I can't get- I can't damage myself here. Even if I want to do something insane, like for instance.

726
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,599
Five dollar spins. Look at this.

727
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,050
How do I increase the bet?

728
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:10,710
It's 50 dollars? How do I do it? I want to do- I want to do 50 dollar bet.

729
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:21,269
Go back. Did I have to pick it? I had to pick it.

730
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:24,570
I need to go to a different machine. Oh.

731
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,260
Staff are asking for a raise.

732
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,889
All right, here we go. Let's do it.

733
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:36,969
250 a spin. Get a big hit.

734
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:40,380
And then I'll- I'll get a million dollars.

735
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:43,719
That's a- that's a pretty big hit. That's a million dollars, I think.

736
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:53,300
Nice.

737
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:57,829
Ah, your staff has died.

738
01:02:58,789 --> 01:03:01,349
Oh, that game is so fucked up.

739
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:16,630
No, I gotta get a good lineup with the 250 dollar bet. It's a terrible payout.

740
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,969
It's 50 dollars a line.

741
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:26,840
And this is the junkie payout? This is a junk payout you're gonna give me for this shit?

742
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:33,400
Oh, look at this junk.

743
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:40,780
Junkie payout.

744
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:48,699
What's that? Relax. This is just Stephanie money.

745
01:03:50,179 --> 01:03:51,300
Uh,

746
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,579
not anymore.

747
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:56,099
This is Mr. Green money now.

748
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:01,579
Come on.

749
01:04:01,579 --> 01:04:05,739
Say, Mr. Greens, do you remember me?

750
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,630
Yes.

751
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:14,570
I bet you thought you'd never see me again. Thanks for being so nice to me. I appreciate it. So here, here's two thousand dollars. People

752
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,769
just come up to me and give me money.

753
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:21,159
And uh, apparently because I-

754
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,280
I remember what they look like.

755
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:30,900
Hey, Mr. Greens. Yeah, that's me. Remember me? We sat at the same blackjack table for 20 minutes.

756
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:33,139
Oh, yeah, I guess we did.

757
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:36,820
Yeah, thanks for letting me play blackjack with you, even though that's just what you do at the casino.

758
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:40,500
Here's two thousand dollars because you sat next to me and know that- remember what I look like. Yeah.

759
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:53,820
This is realistic.

760
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,820
Casino plants.

761
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:59,210
Wait, I just- whoa, whoa. Oh, no, right, right, right, right.

762
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:08,059
Give me a big hit.

763
01:05:08,059 --> 01:05:11,579
How are these coward bets?

764
01:05:11,739 --> 01:05:16,150
This is 50 dollars a line and you're calling this a- these a coward bets?

765
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,050
Orange. Now that's gonna be big.

766
01:05:23,539 --> 01:05:25,219
Now that's gonna be good.

767
01:05:25,219 --> 01:05:30,420
That's not good at all. Can I see the- um, let me see, please.

768
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:39,940
Holy shit, this really is the worst machine ever. Um, okay.

769
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:55,210
Seven. I'm taking it down to- if I go under ten thousand, I'm fucking out of here. Watermelon. Oh.

770
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,300
Ten dollars for a bag of cheetos.

771
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,380
Watermelon. Shit.

772
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,679
Go big or go jump king. It's an interesting one to hear.

773
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,800
Go big or go jump king.

774
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:26,019
Ah, shit.

775
01:06:26,019 --> 01:06:28,659
All right, this is it. This is it. Nine, nine, nine, nine.

776
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:42,570
Let's go win it. Can I give you a lottery ticket? No, I don't want anybody's lottery tickets.

777
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,340
Under- okay, now I'm under ten thousand.

778
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,280
Hey. Hey, say Mr. Greens.

779
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,000
Do you remember me?

780
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,320
Yes. Um, you just walked over here, but at half an hour-

781
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:12,280
You're the girl who gave me two thousand dollars for remembering what you looked like. Yeah, I remember you.

782
01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:15,960
I bet you thought you'd never see me again. Thanks for being so nice to me.

783
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:20,119
I appreciate it. So I want to give back. Here's another two thousand dollars.

784
01:07:21,909 --> 01:07:24,139
Thanks.

785
01:07:24,139 --> 01:07:29,659
I know who you are. Remember that. I know what you look like if you ever want to give any money to people.

786
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:31,739
I know who you are.

787
01:07:31,739 --> 01:07:35,500
You're the two thousand dollar girl. Come on back if- I don't know. I remember.

788
01:07:43,099 --> 01:07:45,099
Nobody else will though. Nobody else. Come to me.

789
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,980
People have shit memories nowadays. Come to me.

790
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:53,300
This feels like a weird-

791
01:07:53,300 --> 01:08:00,280
Uh, like-

792
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:03,800
It's a- it's a- it's a simp?

793
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:08,980
Watermelon.

794
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:15,750
But no-

795
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:18,539
Come on.

796
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:21,180
German, no. Shut up. I- what do you want me to say?

797
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:24,409
I'm just reading.

798
01:08:24,409 --> 01:08:37,560
That's a big one. Give me a monster hit.

799
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:40,869
I mean an absolute fucking

800
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:48,649
monster of a hit.

801
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:50,659
You're the screamer.

802
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:51,699
Oh.

803
01:08:51,699 --> 01:08:53,699
There it is. Monster fucking hit.

804
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:55,460
Monster hit.

805
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,460
You all didn't believe in me.

806
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:00,020
You didn't believe in my monstrous ability.

807
01:09:00,739 --> 01:09:02,500
That's probably 20 grand.

808
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:12,220
Look at this. Oh, it's not 20 grand. It's a lot though.

809
01:09:12,939 --> 01:09:17,500
All right, that's it.

810
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:26,140
Far. Now stop. Not yet.

811
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:32,649
Just- I- I- if I go under 16, how do you give yourself a new ceiling?

812
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:34,970
16 is the ceiling.

813
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:40,069
If I go under 16, we're out.

814
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:42,949
Okay, now we make it- we're gonna make a new ceiling?

815
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,779
Okay.

816
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:47,779
Under 16, 5, we're out.

817
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:55,220
Bingo.

818
01:09:55,220 --> 01:10:06,680
Under 17, we're out.

819
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:07,880
Okay.

820
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,159
Same plan.

821
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:13,859
I'm gonna stop right now. This is not real. It's not my money. It's not real money.

822
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:20,180
Under 17, we're up.

823
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,539
What if it was?

824
01:10:21,539 --> 01:10:23,609
We fucked up.

825
01:10:23,609 --> 01:10:24,970
All right. This is it.

826
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,970
I got one more after this potentially.

827
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:32,119
Okay.

828
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:38,170
If I don't hit, we're up. Because we're under 17, fuck.

829
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:47,770
See?

830
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:49,770
8,500 fucking bucks.

831
01:10:49,770 --> 01:10:55,020
Stop. You're gambling your net worth.

832
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:59,529
All right. Now let's go to the- let's go to the nice casino.

833
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:04,119
I want to go to the one that has like $5,000 bets.

834
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:12,710
All right. Uh, Richard, come on with us.

835
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:17,159
Go to the shitty one. I'm not- you- why- are you kidding me?

836
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:20,420
You want me to bring

837
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,739
$17,000

838
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:25,859
into a casino that's supposed to be like a bad casino?

839
01:11:26,659 --> 01:11:34,460
Oh, this looks really really bad. This is pretty shady. We shouldn't go here. Oh, no, no, no, excuse me.

840
01:11:34,779 --> 01:11:38,460
All right, don't worry. Let me just take $17,000 in cash with me in here.

841
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:48,090
I'm Mr. Greens.

842
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:50,090
It's only 17k.

843
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:54,439
All right, let's go to- I don't want to go there with that much money.

844
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:57,340
Let's- we got to go to the big casino.

845
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:02,420
I can't go to Laurel Palace yet. 2020 is the one that is

846
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,260
big bets.

847
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:14,489
I'm ready.

848
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:16,489
Here we go. 2020, baby.

849
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:21,979
All right.

850
01:12:21,979 --> 01:12:23,270
Here we go.

851
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:28,119
Back to Blackjack.

852
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:30,119
Thousand dollars a hand. Let's go.

853
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:35,859
Let's go. I'm fucking- I'm bringing this down to ten. I got a $7,500 bankroll.

854
01:12:43,899 --> 01:12:46,060
Shit. Bad start. That's a bad start.

855
01:12:46,859 --> 01:12:48,869
Fuck you.

856
01:12:48,869 --> 01:12:59,880
Fuck. Mr. Greens, I found this wallet with a thousand dollars in it.

857
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:05,340
You fucking idiot. That's just the money I put on the table. I was about to place it and I dropped it.

858
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,579
What are you, dub? I'm sorry. I don't mean that.

859
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:12,380
Uh, turn it in. It's a thousand dollars. It means fuck. That's nothing to Mr. Greens.

860
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:15,260
Turn it in.

861
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:20,380
I'm so glad you found it. That's mine.

862
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,899
Stay.

863
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:26,810
Wow, you found a wallet. I've been looking for that. Thanks.

864
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:33,350
Double the bet? You can't double-

865
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,779
Why would you do that?

866
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:38,819
Mr. Greens, the hotel office said you turned in my wallet. Thanks.

867
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:45,539
I played roulette and put all the money on my favorite number and won. I would like to reward your honesty.

868
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:50,260
If you weren't so honest, I wouldn't have won. So I'm giving you half of my winnings.

869
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:54,100
Wait.

870
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,819
Is that just how- that's- that's just my money.

871
01:13:58,069 --> 01:14:00,789
You gave me 17.5? I had 17.5.

872
01:14:03,399 --> 01:14:04,840
Oh my god.

873
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,840
Okay, I got 34,000 dollars.

874
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:17,050
That's a 20 versus six. Why can't I split them?

875
01:14:18,939 --> 01:14:22,859
I wish I could split these. Why? I can't- I got- because it's not the same damn thing. Whatever.

876
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:41,989
Look at how well I did.

877
01:14:41,989 --> 01:14:45,350
You know, it's bad when you're playing a game, a casino game,

878
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,600
and the amount of, you know, your net winnings so far are probably

879
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:54,439
maybe like positive four or five hundred dollars at this point.

880
01:14:55,479 --> 01:15:01,399
But the amount of charitable donations to my bankroll has been upwards of 50,000 dollars.

881
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:11,590
That's kind of a strange casino game. My profit is just donations.

882
01:15:14,899 --> 01:15:16,020
Come on.

883
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:18,020
Something- why? Two aces.

884
01:15:18,739 --> 01:15:20,550
This is so dumb.

885
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:24,329
Ah!

886
01:15:24,329 --> 01:15:26,329
Just like in real life.

887
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:30,380
He's a streamer at heart. These are all bits.

888
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:34,970
There's a blackjack finally.

889
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:37,050
Life imitates art.

890
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:50,220
Another blackjack. Two in a row. I got 30 grand. When do I- oh, why?

891
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:56,220
When do I unlock the- the expensive casino? I have 35,000 dollars. Do I need to go- it's six figures?

892
01:15:56,539 --> 01:16:01,180
The only way that's gonna happen is if somebody loses another wallet.

893
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:16,329
Ah!

894
01:16:16,329 --> 01:16:27,140
That's so bad. The link? Link, link. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I just clicked a stay.

895
01:16:27,779 --> 01:16:35,670
Holy fuck. I didn't even mean to do that. I can't believe that just happened.

896
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:38,970
All right, click the link. Click the link. Hold on.

897
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:47,260
Where's this link? Is it on screen?

898
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:57,430
I don't- who-

899
01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:01,800
What is this?

900
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,079
Who is that?

901
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:05,420
Who is that?

902
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:12,119
Is that a- is that a- wait, is that a per- is that- that's a person. Mr. Green and Bugleberry?

903
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,319
I don't- but that's like a per- that's a real person.

904
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:52,279
Bugleberry.

905
01:17:52,279 --> 01:18:07,539
Do it again. Give me a blackjack. Four, five, six, man.

906
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:14,920
Howard.

907
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:23,380
Howard is not how you win in a casino game. I mean this- that is how you win. What am I talking about? Yes.

908
01:18:27,909 --> 01:18:30,760
Even.

909
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,760
Okay, sure. Could you put

910
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:38,199
$20,000 on the table right now and hit blackjack and have like 80 grand in your pocket? Sure.

911
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:42,840
Um, or you just don't win that hand and then the re- all your money's gone.

912
01:18:44,329 --> 01:18:50,569
Rather than just bleeding 500 to a thousand dollars like I'm doing here over the course of like seven hours.

913
01:18:53,079 --> 01:18:55,800
I'm not doing this because that ends everything now.

914
01:18:56,439 --> 01:19:00,789
I'll do this

915
01:19:00,789 --> 01:19:02,789
over the course of a few hours.

916
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:06,810
And then look, you lost 30 grand. I only lost 100.

917
01:19:07,449 --> 01:19:20,949
Insurance? No.

918
01:19:20,949 --> 01:19:22,149
Turd grand.

919
01:19:22,149 --> 01:19:25,220
It's just virtual. I- look, are you kidding me?

920
01:19:25,779 --> 01:19:27,779
Do you really think the guy with no self-control

921
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:33,939
if- if I was able to like legally at this table that I wouldn't do this three times? Are you kidding me?

922
01:19:34,819 --> 01:19:36,819
You know, you- you're on- what channel you're on, right?

923
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:52,359
There you go. This is blackjack. I want to be able to bet $10,000 a hand. That's what you don't understand. That's double blackjack.

924
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:00,920
All right. Oh, we've crossed.

925
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:07,500
17 versus a nine. I hate this but I'm gonna do it.

926
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:24,149
Don't let him. He could have just won so much. Yeah, but I- it's not allowed. The max bet is 10- is a thousand.

927
01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:26,710
I'm max betting right now.

928
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:37,449
Go all in. I would if I could. You know, I would. I would do a

929
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:40,390
$35,499 bet now.

930
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:49,750
See if I can break 40. Give me blackjack again. All right, let's split him up.

931
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:52,390
Here we go. This is it. Split him.

932
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:59,189
18 and 20. Stay on both of them. Stay on both.

933
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,619
Get the hell out of here. Yep. That's a double.

934
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:08,340
2,000 fucking bucks.

935
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:12,149
Okay. Now-

936
01:21:12,149 --> 01:21:17,689
Mr. Greens, my little girl is very sick and needs an operation. We're too poor.

937
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:21,050
I know we just met but could you please lend me a hundred dollars?

938
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:32,260
Absolutely. Thank you so much. I'll come back in about two or three hands with 50 grand.

939
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:36,420
Bye!

940
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,500
Do you- do you wish to come back?

941
01:21:39,579 --> 01:21:41,579
Remember me? I know your face.

942
01:21:58,939 --> 01:22:02,699
Mr. Greens, you've saved the life of my baby. Here's two hundred dollars.

943
01:22:04,409 --> 01:22:07,350
Oh. Two hundred?

944
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,300
I-

945
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:18,069
Uh, not more than that. Uh, I mean,

946
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,810
I had a guy sit next to me

947
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:24,489
and he sat behind me for a few hands and gave me five grand.

948
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:30,460
And then a lady came up and asked me if I remembered what she looked like twice and I got four grand.

949
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:36,039
Okay, I just saved your daughter's life and I only got a hundred dollars.

950
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:41,420
What is this?

951
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:43,260
Are you fucking serious?

952
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:55,850
And then just a huge- another huge inhale and I'm holding it in.

953
01:22:56,979 --> 01:23:00,340
Where is it? Where is it? Where's that- where's the smoke? He has to breathe the smoke out eventually.

954
01:23:00,819 --> 01:23:04,020
And then like a little trail of smoke is coming up from behind me.

955
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:13,800
And then I just stare and I go, you know where that's coming from. And then everybody's like what the- this guy's- fuck!

956
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:33,430
I can't wait till you get old. What? You think I'm gonna be like this?

957
01:23:38,619 --> 01:23:40,539
You know what? I'm gonna get insurance because fuck it.

958
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:44,619
God damn it. And one time I do-

959
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:56,340
The one time I- oh my god, whatever. Grymer's teeth are gonna be brown.

960
01:23:59,989 --> 01:24:01,989
Wait, why do I have brown teeth?

961
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:12,340
Damn it. All right. I'm getting up. I'm going.

962
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:18,010
Too much CBT oil?

963
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:21,420
I'm getting up. Okay, quick quick quick quick.

964
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:27,560
Okay.

965
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,640
I'm doing poker. I need your help here.

966
01:24:30,359 --> 01:24:34,010
I'm doing a thousand dollars on poker.

967
01:24:34,409 --> 01:24:51,739
I need you guys help. The ante's a hundred bucks. Let's go. Seven- seven cards start his ass.

968
01:24:53,239 --> 01:24:55,239
Did I just combine two messages in a row?

969
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:59,619
Stefan, you got- all right. I'm ready. Double Stefan. We're ready to go.

970
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:02,729
Go all in. A hundred- a thousand dollars.

971
01:25:06,739 --> 01:25:08,739
Raise 500. Sure. I'll do that too.

972
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:12,229
Hey, I'm gonna raise it a thousand dollars.

973
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:18,699
Who's this guy?

974
01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:19,739
Wait.

975
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:22,380
Who's the guy with like the- the cyborg face?

976
01:25:24,489 --> 01:25:26,569
This is a fifty one hundred dollar pot right now.

977
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:28,329
Paul.

978
01:25:28,329 --> 01:25:30,649
Paul.

979
01:25:30,649 --> 01:25:34,149
Give me another seven.

980
01:25:34,149 --> 01:25:36,310
Shit. Oh no. All right.

981
01:25:37,029 --> 01:25:41,859
Okay, let's keep going. He doesn't get shit over there. We got a pair of fours. Dickhead.

982
01:25:46,439 --> 01:25:48,439
Paul. Paul. Paul. Yeah, you got a pair of fours.

983
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,199
Dickhead.

984
01:25:50,199 --> 01:25:59,539
Seven, eight, nine.

985
01:25:59,539 --> 01:26:04,170
He's from the future. The year 2020.

986
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:11,000
He folded. That was the guy I was worried about. Wait. You got two aces.

987
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,880
Oh shit. You have two aces.

988
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:28,119
What an idiot. Holy shit. Did it work? He's got twos.

989
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:37,340
Fuck.

990
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:54,619
Call bluff. Call bluff. Get out. Oh shit. You just- oh my god. That's too much.

991
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:02,779
Call. Give me a se-

992
01:27:02,779 --> 01:27:06,489
What's that? Two pair?

993
01:27:06,489 --> 01:27:09,340
I got two pair though.

994
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:12,460
Holy shit. I'm gonna win ten thousand more dollars. All right. Raise it all in.

995
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,020
This is seven. I got a pair of threes and sevens.

996
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:29,130
Let's scare the shit out of him. Are you still- are you still at the table?

997
01:27:29,609 --> 01:27:33,140
Are you still at the table? Okay. You still want to go, huh? You want to go?

998
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,739
You got any more money? You got a thousand more dollars to put on this?

999
01:27:37,899 --> 01:27:39,899
Okay. All right. You want to play games?

1000
01:27:40,699 --> 01:28:08,949
That's one of- that's a scenario where you- you're like at the table

1001
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:11,670
and you just like sit up. You stand up and you like

1002
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:15,609
point like once just at the sky and you go, ah,

1003
01:28:17,619 --> 01:28:19,619
ah, um, good luck.

1004
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:21,539
Good luck everybody. Good luck everybody.

1005
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:22,500
I wish everybody good luck.

1006
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:27,460
And then you fucking just walk away and you walk with your hands in your pockets and you're just like one, two, three, four, five, six, count my steps.

1007
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:30,340
Okay, I gotta take a piss. Let's pee.

1008
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:42,329
Okay, then you're fine. Just go

1009
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:52,840
It's all right. Say fuck. Fuck. Let's hope. Ah, it's okay. All right. Let's go. Let's go to the buffet.

1010
01:28:53,239 --> 01:29:04,460
Oh my god, what's happening? Thirty one thousand five hundred dollars on one?

1011
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:15,609
Okay. Wait, what just happened? I can't do that. Stop doing that. I'm trying to-

1012
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:26,069
Why is it doing this?

1013
01:29:26,149 --> 01:29:29,670
Oh, I have to- minimum bet is a hundred. Oh shit.

1014
01:29:30,649 --> 01:29:32,970
Okay, we're gonna do one, two, three, four, five.

1015
01:29:45,369 --> 01:30:04,579
Six, seven, eight, nine. I'm ready. This song.

1016
01:30:14,119 --> 01:30:32,949
Is that a color? I thought I was a coward. Just bet one through twelve, but you don't get the same payback.

1017
01:30:32,949 --> 01:30:41,380
It's thirty five and one. I said the word thirty five and it landed on it. Great.

1018
01:30:41,939 --> 01:30:50,119
I'm pro- how am I- I'm this- I'm pro- look, this is not even my money. Somebody gave this to me.

1019
01:30:50,520 --> 01:31:13,800
And I'll bet my age. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1020
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:23,159
Thirty four. Why didn't I just do my fake age that I said that I am? I'm thirty three.

1021
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:29,289
Now, how old are you? Ah, thirty three. All right, now thirty five.

1022
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:48,899
I'm just on a fake age. God damn it. Do your real age. I'm not actually thirty five, but okay.

1023
01:31:49,779 --> 01:32:04,199
Let's see if it works. God damn it. I should have done how old people say that I look.

1024
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:08,119
It's not about the age that you actually are. The age that you pre- it's the how- it's how you feel.

1025
01:32:09,079 --> 01:32:26,739
People think I'm twenty five, twenty four. Fuck. All right, now I'm gonna- it's now- it's gonna be

1026
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:37,739
the age that I wish that I was. The age that I wish that I just still was. Twenty eight's great.

1027
01:32:37,739 --> 01:32:42,390
You know, it's like twenty eight. You're older, but you're not old. That's the age I wish I could

1028
01:32:42,390 --> 01:33:18,170
stay for. All right, fuck the whole twenties. Twenty- we'll start at twenty one. The twenties

1029
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:25,640
are gone, guys. I don't have them anymore. I'm now in my thirties. Well, dude, we'll do my entire

1030
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:39,189
demographic. Wait, how many is that? Okay, now this is like how old- I'm wrong. All right,

1031
01:33:39,189 --> 01:33:43,029
all right. I'll do the range. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. You're not gonna complain. You're not

1032
01:33:43,029 --> 01:33:48,710
twenty one. You're not even that same range, old boomer. I'm gonna say shut up. I'm gonna say shut up.

1033
01:33:56,550 --> 01:34:04,789
Okay, there you go. Twenty six. Twenty six to thirty five is like my age kind of range.

1034
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:25,939
God damn it. I should have bet on the fucking median age of the audience. Not about how old I

1035
01:34:25,939 --> 01:34:51,380
am. I keep getting this wrong. The age that we act. There's the thing. Here's the thing. All right,

1036
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:59,100
well, let's be- okay, here we go. Here's my- how I act. Not how you act. How I act. Okay,

1037
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:19,460
I think that's pretty good. Let's go. All in on eleven.

1038
01:35:19,539 --> 01:35:34,619
The gods wanted my real age again. I act thirty-four apparently. It's how thirty-four

1039
01:35:34,619 --> 01:36:11,029
year olds act. Okay, uh, a thousand dollars on one. All right, if you come over to a table

1040
01:36:12,229 --> 01:36:24,659
and- hold on, this is important. Let me- how do I- let me get out with this. Where's my camera?

1041
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:34,420
I'm gonna show you what you do. Here's- here's how this plays out. If you ever come up to a table,

1042
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:39,060
okay, and you put a thousand- here's how you're gonna- it's how you're gonna act. Wait a minute,

1043
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:51,449
hold on. Dougalberry again. I'm such a klutz. I- I'm such a klutz. I sprained my ankle,

1044
01:36:51,449 --> 01:36:55,979
and I hate to ask, but Mr. Green, would you please take me to the emergency room?

1045
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:05,699
Yeah, let's go. Hey, thanks for the free money. Mr. Green's took that person to the emergency room.

1046
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:13,210
Okay, here we go. We're gonna put a thousand dollars on, uh, twenty. This is what- if you put

1047
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:15,850
that much money on a number, you're gonna go up to the table, and you're gonna go like this.

1048
01:37:43,289 --> 01:38:22,920
Hey, who's back? Let's go. Thousand dollars on 13, 14 in the corner. 13, 14, 15, 7. What was it?

1049
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:45,060
It's gonna be impossible. The numbers are too close together. Okay, literally how this is going to

1050
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:49,939
work is I- the first- the first number that I see in chat is again a thousand dollars on it.

1051
01:38:49,939 --> 01:39:15,289
There's 10. Got it wrong. Boring number. Omega lol. What? Ban that person. Okay, yeah. Time that

1052
01:39:15,289 --> 01:39:32,819
person up. Time that person up for fucking five minutes. Okay, um, okay. I'm gonna pick a number,

1053
01:39:32,819 --> 01:39:39,909
and I'm gonna say your name. Uh, jbumbum. jbumbum. Twenty-three thousand dollars on it. If this

1054
01:39:39,909 --> 01:40:07,060
doesn't hit, ban that person for ten minutes. Uh, gun gun guy said 36. Gun gun guy. Hold on.

1055
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:25,100
Blown all of my money. I even spent my return fare home. Can you spare two hundred dollars

1056
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:36,739
for this watch? Yeah, sure. Thank you for saving. Well, all right, what was that guy's name? Uh,

1057
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:43,189
gun gun? Gun guy, whatever his name was. Okay, thousand dollars here. What's wrong? Time amount.

1058
01:40:51,989 --> 01:41:03,739
It left. Time amount anyways. Well, you ran because you knew that it was- it was not gonna

1059
01:41:03,739 --> 01:41:12,729
hit. You just said number. Uh, skeletoxin says 14. That's a nice watch. You want to sell it for

1060
01:41:12,729 --> 01:41:25,050
a thousand dollars? Yeah. Thirteen? Wait, what is it? Fourteen? What was their name? I don't even

1061
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:34,569
remember. Wait, I didn't put a bet down. If this is actually 14, don't even. I don't think. Thank

1062
01:41:34,569 --> 01:41:39,340
God. I didn't put the bet down, but they were wrong. Ban them anyways. All right, what are we

1063
01:41:39,340 --> 01:42:10,699
doing? 26. All right, the true Mechi. 26. Ban them for 10 minutes if this is wrong. Oh, 27 to 26.

1064
01:42:11,579 --> 01:42:20,619
So close, but it's still a 10 minute time up. Goodbye. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1065
01:42:20,619 --> 01:42:27,819
wait. What did they say? Double zero, stinky. Okay, fine. Psycho. Psycho. What was it? Psycho what?

1066
01:42:28,539 --> 01:42:46,760
I don't even know what the psycho in their name. Double zero. Ban them. Ban. What is it? Ban me 12.

1067
01:42:46,760 --> 01:43:02,859
Ban me- who said that? I said ban me 12. Ban me 12. Okay, ban them first. I'm gonna do 12. Do 20

1068
01:43:02,859 --> 01:43:27,130
minutes if this is wrong. 35 keeps popping up. Let's just put- I'm gonna- okay, I'm gonna put

1069
01:43:27,130 --> 01:44:01,270
a hundred bucks on 35 every time. Uh, MaxPowey31. You know the deal? 21. Okay. Somebody said get the-

1070
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:08,359
get the range and ban everybody writing the numbers. 11 to 35. Ban everyone.

1071
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:59,380
I have a kind heart. I can't believe this. All right. 16 or ban me. 16 read or ban me.

1072
01:45:00,819 --> 01:46:51,800
I will mute for five- I'll mute for five minutes. Ah! That's fucking ridiculous. I know I'm banned.

1073
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:55,399
Ban me again. Fucking whatever. I'm saying my piece. That's ridiculous. I didn't get the

1074
01:46:55,399 --> 01:46:59,779
last two. Whatever. It's been five minutes. Whatever. Fuck it. Here's what do you got.

1075
01:47:00,340 --> 01:47:07,560
Uh, it's one- 10 grand. Somebody said move on. What do you mean move on? I got 22 grand still.

1076
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:30,140
This is not even my money. Six or mod me. Okay. Who said that? Wait, this- this is or mod me? What

1077
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:46,729
do you mean? Six means if you- lands on six then you get mod. Yeah, you were wrong. No, no, it was

1078
01:47:46,729 --> 01:47:51,449
if they got- no, it's not mod me. No, they- if they have it hit, yeah, then you deserved it.

1079
01:47:59,689 --> 01:48:07,689
Game's muted. Oh, fuck. Seven or I eat eggs. Whoever said that. Seven or they- oh, they eat eggs.

1080
01:48:08,489 --> 01:48:23,619
Well, yeah, and you're gonna get timed out for 10 minutes. Ooh, that was close. That was close.

1081
01:48:23,619 --> 01:48:31,460
That was pretty close. All right, let's go burn the rest of this. Let's go. Ready? You know what

1082
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:36,899
I'm going- you know what I'm doing here. This is what we're doing. Let's go. Let's do it. Let's

1083
01:48:36,899 --> 01:48:58,729
fucking go. Let's go. We're going super mode. $2,500 a spin. Let's go. Go broke.

1084
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:17,699
Come on. It's gotta get one fucking monster hit. Oh, come on. I gotta do it. Come on. Where's the

1085
01:49:17,699 --> 01:49:36,420
monster hits? Derma sucks thanks for five community subs. God damn it. Seven. Seven.

1086
01:49:40,899 --> 01:49:51,479
I just won. That's like a hundred thousand dollars I win. Get the fuck out of here.

1087
01:49:51,479 --> 01:49:54,520
None of you believed in me. None of you believed in Mr. Green.

1088
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:02,460
Is there anything even left on this? I just put it in my mouth and breathe it in just to make you feel

1089
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:20,460
less than me. You see? This cigar cost $2,500. I got $110,000 fucking dollars. Yeah. Did I beat the

1090
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:27,510
game? Mr. Greens, I've got great news for you. Due to your great success, you have been awarded

1091
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:34,470
a high roller status and with it a complimentary room at the Laurel Palace. The Laurel Palace?

1092
01:50:35,189 --> 01:50:40,649
We could never go there before. Good going, Mr. Greens. Go pack your bags. Our limo is waiting

1093
01:50:40,729 --> 01:50:48,810
to take you to Laurel Palace. Oh, that's right. Where I belong with all the other rich people.

1094
01:50:49,850 --> 01:50:53,960
A high roller. I'll miss this old room, but not too much.

1095
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:58,119
Well, I hope my limo is ready. Now it's off to the Laurel Palace.

1096
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:05,220
That's my internal monologue. My internal monologue, I still think I'm a good person

1097
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:10,680
and I talk normally, but I'm actually horrible. But I like to pretend I am in my head.

1098
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:26,199
Welcome to the Laurel Palace. Wow. Check it out. A great room and free to boot. Well,

1099
01:51:26,199 --> 01:51:32,359
time to go back. Get back to the casino floor. And there'll be no stopping me till I reach $10

1100
01:51:32,359 --> 01:51:41,449
million. That's, uh, if you, if you go to the casino, going there with the goal to

1101
01:51:41,449 --> 01:51:50,569
come up with $10 million, um, what you should be trying to do is to be able to still afford to go

1102
01:51:50,569 --> 01:51:57,460
to Taco Bell when it's all over. So I think you're going in with weird expectations here.

1103
01:52:04,739 --> 01:52:16,520
Holy shit. Look at this place. Wow. Like games. Let's do, how, what's the slot like? Oh, that's

1104
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:37,699
a $5,000 bid. Oh, that's a lot of money. Oh no. I'm about to lose. I'm about to lose a comma.

1105
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:50,550
Come on, keep it up. Okay. Is it weird that I feel like if you're sitting at a,

1106
01:52:51,029 --> 01:52:58,149
if you're here doing a $5,000 a spin slot machine, you are like this amorphous blob thing that your

1107
01:52:58,149 --> 01:53:03,479
body is just folding over the sides of the seat and you're just like leaning back and

1108
01:53:03,479 --> 01:53:10,180
you have like two drinks attached to like a helmet on your head. And there's like people,

1109
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:15,539
you're getting a manicure and a pedicure on all of your hands and feet at the same time.

1110
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:22,460
And when you blink, somebody else presses the button for you. That's $5,000 a spin.

1111
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:41,850
If I get a big hit here. Oh my God. That would have been, I would have won. That would have been

1112
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:58,380
the whole game. Okay. All right. I don't want to lose all my riches. Don't get cocky. I just,

1113
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:08,470
I've got to give myself a limit down to $90,000. $90,000 is the limit. $80,000. That's a good call.

1114
01:54:11,159 --> 01:54:29,670
$80,000 is the limit. All right. I can, I'm still here. What about $70,000? No, that's pushing it.

1115
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:51,659
Damn it. That watermelon would have been sick. You know what? $80,000. Come on. What the

1116
01:54:51,659 --> 01:55:02,279
fuck are you doing in here? I'm so sorry to ask you for a favor. I desperately need some cash.

1117
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:09,640
Would you like to buy this diamond? I guarantee it is worth a bit. It's been appraised for $5,000.

1118
01:55:10,439 --> 01:55:20,680
How much will you give me for it? A lot of money. How about $500? I'll give you $500. Come on.

1119
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:44,170
$500. $3,600. No. $500. No. $500. $2,800. You got yourself a deal. $2,800 bucks. I mean,

1120
01:55:44,170 --> 01:55:55,590
I was $5,000. All right. Guys, I spent $5,000 a spin. Big one. All right.

1121
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:01,460
Mr. Greens, that's a very good imitation diamond. I'll give you $100 for it.

1122
01:56:04,729 --> 01:56:12,010
I don't need that. You were conned. How would you know?

1123
01:56:20,789 --> 01:56:30,180
How would you know? If I had a ring on and you came over, like, hey, you got a fake ring on.

1124
01:56:30,979 --> 01:57:10,119
Okay. I know. What if I knew that? Game sucks. $777,000. I got all $777. That's why I got out

1125
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:14,920
like game Blackjack. We'll be doing monster fucking hands here. No.

1126
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:37,859
I can't. I can't. I can't do it. I can't do it. It took me so long to get this.

1127
01:57:38,819 --> 01:57:48,520
I can't do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. Oh, shit. I have to stand here. This is handy.

1128
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:53,850
He's going to bust on. He's going to bust on it. Oh my God. Oh no.

1129
01:58:00,279 --> 01:58:14,149
Do it again. Do it again. Come on. $14 versus $8. Fuck. Oh shit. Don't turn over a $10.

1130
01:58:14,149 --> 01:58:29,189

1333
02:31:43,930 --> 02:31:48,430
250 remember when it comes to blackjack 17 is the magic number always hit if

1334
02:31:48,430 --> 02:31:57,440
below 17 and stay when above it it's not true the dealer is showing a four or five

1335
02:31:57,440 --> 02:32:03,079
or six and you have 12 or higher the correct play if you're playing basic

1336
02:32:03,079 --> 02:32:13,770
strategy is to do nothing especially versus five and a six that that is actual

1337
02:32:13,770 --> 02:32:19,489
basic strategy it's a term that's been used to bring the most returns over the

1338
02:32:19,489 --> 02:32:27,709
over that more than a dozen hands in blackjack this guy just lost a shit this

1339

bit I'm not on that coalition but I'll tell you anyways hey they they're very

1348

hard behind you what else hey somebody breaks into your house and they're

thanks for five dollars Jeremy I also recently started doing THC and CBD vapor

1355
02:34:59,229 --> 02:35:02,989
pen for my panic attacks talked about it last week at the recommendation of my

1356
02:35:02,989 --> 02:35:07,950
doctor it's so much more effective than taking a benzodiazepine orally it takes

1357
02:35:07,950 --> 02:35:12,229
30 minutes to actually take effect when the panic is already over also I'm not

1358
02:35:12,229 --> 02:35:15,950
substituting your e-clown shenanigans for professional help like you said last

1359
02:35:15,950 --> 02:35:28,329
time I donated fucking egomaniac all right yeah I have been doing small doses

1360
02:35:28,329 --> 02:35:36,610
of CBD THC combined three milligrams taking it because there's been studies

1361
02:35:36,610 --> 02:35:42,809
and data at THC and CBD have an effect potentially on kind of shutting up the

1362
02:35:42,809 --> 02:35:53,040
nerve response if you have potential nerve damage or nerve pain so giving it

1363
02:35:53,040 --> 02:36:02,180
a try to see if it kind of calms it down see what happens small dose not very

1364
02:36:02,659 --> 02:36:07,299
what's the term it's not very psychoactive just put it that way with

1365

germ stuttering chat was seeing at the start of the stream is due to some new

1424
02:42:31,899 --> 02:42:36,840
dumb Windows settings and newer games games use a hundred percent of your GPU

1425
02:42:36,840 --> 02:42:41,579
leaving none for OBS the game will look fine to you it will lose frames and OBS

1426
02:42:41,579 --> 02:42:45,700
no matter what encoding process you use if it happens limit the frame rate of

1427
02:42:45,700 --> 02:42:50,229
the game or lower its video settings I've had this problem I have an RTX 2080

1707
03:16:18,780 --> 03:16:22,159
something that you enjoy on your own taking the time to soak in the world the

1708
03:16:22,159 --> 03:16:25,819
same goes for chat the game is great as long as you don't mind talking to all

the NPCs all of them they're interesting don't worry higher however is a great

1710
