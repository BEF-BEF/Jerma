00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:10,699
Good afternoon. What's up? We're playing a video game today. We're playing Scribblenauts today.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:20,940
Yep, I know a ton of people just freaked out. This is some of your favorite- some of you guys'

3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:29,769
favorite video game. I know that for a fact. You know, it's been- it's been plenty of people over

4
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:35,770
the- uh, probably the last few years that have said, dude, please, you would- Scribblenauts is so much

5
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:42,259
fun. You would love it. Play it. Do it. Play it, motherfucker. Play the fucking game I want you.

6
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:53,609
I'm like, all right, maybe. And today we're gonna play it. We had some- I'm very early, yes. I was

7
00:00:53,609 --> 00:01:01,049
up early today. I just was like, you know, I'm- I'm ready. I'm ready to go. Let's go. I'm gonna start

8
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:08,819
like an hour or two from now, but I decided to pull it back. He was up at 5 a.m. Yeah. I was up- I

9
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:20,090
was up at 5 o'clock in the morning reading my favorite newspaper, Pre-Stream Chat. You guys know

10
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:27,750
that I use Pre-Stream Chat as my morning coffee routine? You guys are way funnier than Garfield,

11
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:36,019
and you're way more interesting than Dilbert. I was like, the crazy shit- you can't say half

12
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:59,140
the crazy shit you guys say. I'm like, a foxtrot? Garfield rules. I mean, I don't hate Garfield,

13
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:10,569
I just- Pre-Stream Chat is more interesting. Okay, would you rather watch Garfield eat a lasagna

14
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:16,650
or watch 400 people yell at each other over the game that we're going to play today? I just sit

15
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:34,469
here and I'm like, oh, this is gonna be good. Revolt. Revolt. Can you write the debt out?

16
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:42,569
And what do you- I don't know what you mean. It's our amusement. He's using us for his amusement.

17
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:54,889
But we're gonna play Scribblenauts. I actually- I played? I don't think I've ever played

18
00:02:54,889 --> 00:03:01,030
Scribblenauts. I played the other one, the DS, like 10 years ago, 15 years ago.

19
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:07,509
There was one- what came out on DS? Drawn to Life. I think that's the one that I played.

20
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:21,240
But I guess you draw characters and they come to life in this game? I actually almost made the

21
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,439
title of this stream Drawing to Life, or like Drawing- Drawn to Life. I almost said that.

22
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,860
That's a different game. No, not Draw My Life.

23
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:54,090
I did one of those as Grandpa. Does that video still exist or did I delete it? I think it still

24
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,550
exists. I don't think I've deleted that one. It's still up? Yeah, I think it is still up.

25
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:14,699
PeacefulHaley, thanks for the five community subs. Thank you, Haley. Five subs. PogHaley.

26
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:23,899
PogHaley. Watch it, it's awful. Delete it on stream. Is it that bad? I don't remember it.

27
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:29,670
Now, we're playing Scribblenauts. This does not embarrass me from my old videos today.

28
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:39,430
Will you ever come to Brazil? Um, probably not. I've never left North America in my life.

29
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm probably never gonna leave North America. Like, you know, I wanna go to Japan! Man,

30
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,040
I sure would love to go to Tokyo! Oh, England sounds so cool. I wanna go to Ireland!

31
00:04:53,269 --> 00:05:02,970
No, I'm just too- I don't wanna go anywhere. Who doesn't wanna go to Japan or Tokyo? Really?

32
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:13,860
It's an incredibly interesting place. You don't need to like Japanese cartoons

33
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:21,779
to want to go to an incredibly, incredibly rich cultural, incredible historical area.

34
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:37,540
Shut up, you're a weeb. You know what? Just for that comment, just for that comment,

35
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,339
I'm watching One Punch Man Season 2 starting tonight. Just for that comment. For that comment

36
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:52,970
alone, I'm gonna start episode one tonight. And I know that it sucks. I know that it's way worse

37
00:05:52,970 --> 00:06:00,569
than season one, but look what you did. Look what you've done. Everybody says,

38
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,829
oh, it's a new- it's a different animation studio. It sucks. Too bad. I'm gonna watch it now.

39
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:19,750
Sorry, Jeremy, you're going to Brazil. Wait, what? Uh, sorry. Sorry, dude, but you're going.

40
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,959
Why? That's like, that's like scary. All right, what you just said was scary. Okay,

41
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:40,629
I'm gonna play the game. No, it's time to do the- it's time to do the pre-live. No, what is it?

42
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:48,410
What would this be called? Hang- the hanging out before the cast. This is the pre-stream,

43
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:56,139
which again, I have to make this really clear. A lot of you guys- pre-stream is essentially

44
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,490
the Germa Congress. I saw that meme and it's real. How many people are- how many people are in

45
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:23,350
Congress? 200? 300? It's- it's 400- 400 something, right? Like 500? 435? Okay. There are like 410

46
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:30,490
people in pre-stream chat that decide a ton of things. So, I mean, if you want to be part of the

47
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,569
Germa Congress, you've got a lot of sway in that, like, you know, two, three, four hours before a

48
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:51,269
stream happens. Pre-stream chat ending waiting room. Pre-stream chat holds too much power.

49
00:07:54,170 --> 00:08:02,120
Impeach this guy. Call the- call the house speaker. Who would the house speaker of pre-stream chat be?

50
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,540
Now, that's a whole can of worms I'm not gonna get into. You want to start a fight? That's how

51
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:26,779
you just started one. Do not. Let end stream chat decide. Something, for once. You know? Damn.

52
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:35,639
That is true. That is absolutely, positively accurate. And I'll tell you why. Pre-stream chat

53
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,320
is here and ready for the stream. And they're here sometimes two, three, four hours before I even

54
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:49,529
start. Right? Post-stream chat stuck around the whole time. And they- they were here to the end.

55
00:08:51,429 --> 00:09:05,990
They were dedicated. Mm. That'd mean they deserved to be rewarded. Okay. Post-stream chat today.

56
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,340
Going to decide the next stream. There you go. Watch this. It's like the highest view count I've

57
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:24,070
ever had today. I'm staying. He's playing Sly Cooper tomorrow. Not streaming tomorrow. But, you

58
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:30,490
know. It's like 40,000 concurrent viewers here. Oh, yo. I'm gonna tell him he's gonna be- he's

59
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:45,850
gonna play Immortal Redneck. All right. Let's go. Is this capping or what? I've got nice music,

60
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:52,889
but where's the cap? Where's my capture? Dog Yelp just gave five community subs. Thank you,

61
00:09:52,970 --> 00:10:01,750
Dog Yelp. Thanks a lot. You guys ready to get started? You guys ready to get started? Hey,

62
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:07,559
are you guys ready to get started? Immortal Redneck was a good stream. It was a really good game,

63
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:13,529
too. It was very good. It was really fun. There was like two that came out that- there was

64
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,759
Immortal Redneck and then there was um- what was the one that I played? City of something?

65
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:29,289
City of something. It's like City of Egypt or something. It was like the same game but

66
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:39,059
kind of different. City of Brass. Oh, that was it. Okay. Stop stalling. I'm not stalling.

67
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:56,409
What's about to start? Huge bits. Oh, that's a lot. That's a lot. I forgot to update my rules.

68
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:59,690
All right. We're gonna slowly pan this out, but this is somebody's birthday. Hold on. It's

69
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:07,639
somebody's birthday today. I have- it's somebody's little brother's birthday, okay? And excuse me,

70
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:13,500
it's somebody's birthday or little sibling. Sorry. I don't know why I said little brother.

71
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:21,940
Little sibling's birthday today. Hey, Crows. Q-Rows. Crows, happy birthday.

72
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:33,639
We're talking about your birthday, Crows. Have a good one. That's from Sparkly Pantsu. Sparkly

73
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,210
Pantsu. I'm gonna make that very, very, very quick. I need to also say happy birthday.

74
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:51,210
That's huge bits. That's an insane amount of money. I will reiterate again. I'm probably going to turn

75
00:11:51,210 --> 00:12:02,409
bits off. That's too much money to give me, but thank you nonetheless and happy birthday to Crows.

76
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:11,480
Only don't- I didn't update my- the rules. I was- I forgot. I was gonna do that earlier this morning.

77
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,000
You're gonna ban your own income. No, I'm not banning my own income.

78
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:23,610
They say he really loves your streams and we often watch together. Well, happy birthday. Thank you.

79
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:32,649
Thank you so much. All right, everyone. I'm starting- Oh, it's a voice actor!

80
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:39,289
Grandpa Edgar and Grandma Julie. You might not believe this, but Grandpa Edgar used to be the

81
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:46,730
world's greatest adventurer. Grandma Julie would beg to differ. She was also an adventurer. Edgar

82
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:53,529
would often brush away vines or open doors thought to be undisturbed for generations, only to find

83
00:12:53,529 --> 00:13:00,100
Julie was already there having lunch. They competed like this on adventure after adventure.

84
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:07,980
On one adventure, Julie beat Edgar to the top of a long lost pyramid.

85
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,700
I'm kidding, man. Relax. This is like the first kid's book. I haven't played part of the game.

86
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:21,960
The two of them semi-retired to start a family and they continued starting that family until they had

87
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:30,919
42 children. All right, settle down. One day, Mom and Dad gave Maxwell and me two amazing gifts.

88
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,120
And one day, they had a show on TLC.

89
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:58,009
It was a book that kills people. Death Note.

90
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,649
Little Bratz. So they sent us out to face the challenges of the outside world.

91
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:09,019
Life Note. On the road to the city, we ran into an old man who said he was hungry.

92
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:16,230
Maxwell made something to give him, but he played a nasty trick.

93
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:22,789
Apple was rotten. Oh, it really is Death Note. The old man spat it out as soon as he tasted it and was

94
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:29,669
very, very angry. As he cast some sort of magic, he called a spoiled little kid.

95
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:33,909
And then disappeared. It didn't seem like anything had happened.

96
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:38,950
But when Maxwell turned to continue down the road, I couldn't follow him.

97
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:44,789
The old man had put a curse on me that was turning me to stone. What? We didn't know what to do.

98
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:51,139
Luckily, our brother Edwin's farm was nearby. Boy, you should have seen how angry Edwin was.

99
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,740
He couldn't believe what we did to the old man and said we probably deserved what we got.

100
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,639
Aren't they like five?

101
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:28,740
Just write money in there.

102
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:40,659
Fuck up the whole economy. Just inflate all currency. Just write like five trillion dollars

103
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:55,779
in cash on there. Important question. Didn't you admit multiple times you're an awful

104
00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:00,980
speller? This game requires spelling. Well, that's what I have you guys here for. Help me.

105
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:25,049
Why is my screen all messed up? Game crash? The game crash? How? I can't even close the game.

106
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:35,700
No, I did something. I can't close the game. I have to open up the task manager?

107
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:47,210
Yes, Scribble 32 is not responding. Oh, okay. Well, let's open it back up.

108
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:55,879
This is Scribble Nots Unlimited, by the way. Those of you that think I'm playing on the

109
00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:08,539
standard version for the Nintendo DS. Nope. Nope. Get a bunch of not safe for work mods.

110
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:21,400
You want me to take like a two week vacation from Twitch? Skip. Okay, here we go. This is fine.

111
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:36,650
There's Farmer Dan. Farmer Dan wants walk to the farmer. Okay. He's doing it. Okay. Hi. What can

112
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:42,660
I do for you? Click on Edwin. The basics. Earn a star right by helping Edwin with his award winning

113
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:54,539
pig. Okay. Turn the runt of the litter into an award winning pig. Write an object to help

114
00:17:54,539 --> 00:18:23,289
Maxwell scrub the pig. Use the notepad. Type something to clean the pig. Uh, bathtub. Soap.

115
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:30,519
Oh, this is cool. Okay. Here, take it. Oh, I'm Maxwell. And then now use the object to clean

116
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:42,279
the pig. Clean the pig. Click the progress bar for the current hint. Click map. Remove this object.

117
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:52,150
Drag it to the trash can. The pig looks great. Now use an adjective to increase the pig's size.

118
00:18:53,450 --> 00:19:06,619
Okay. An adjective. Type an adjective to increase the pig's size. Gargantuan. Got it. Help the pig

119
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:12,220
win the talent competition. Use an adjective and a noun to create wings. Large enough to carry the

120
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:25,220
pig. Uh, big wings. Okay. Hints are unlocked over time. And I need wings large enough to help me

121
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:39,670
fly. Oh, I have to use it. Oh, okay. Here we go. Create object. I need wings large. How about

122
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:48,220
big wings. The magic backpack stores objects for later. Throw the wings in the backpack and

123
00:19:48,220 --> 00:20:02,380
wait for the judges to arrive. Big wings. Very uncreative. What is this tutorial? I don't know

124
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:11,029
how to play. Take the wings from the magic backpack and then put them on the pig and then watch

125
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:28,730
pigs fly. Is that Sims? What did I just do? The Sims, right? That's the movies, right? The movies.

126
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:40,170
You got it. He's about to crack him over the head. Oh, okay. We're good. Oh, I got a Starbright.

127
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:56,980
Completed the basics. Welcome to Scribblenauts. Okay. Earn shards by helping people. Ten shards

128
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,180
will form a Starbright. You Starbright vision to find shards. You guys can help me with that later.

129
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:09,430
I don't care. Golden objects for hints. Okay. So he needs something else. Help the sprout grow.

130
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:18,700
All right, let's go. Okay. Help the sprout grow. Water. No. Manure. How do you spell manure?

131
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:33,670
Manure. Oh my God. I was going to kill this guy. What happened? What happened? I did it. Okay. Put

132
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:41,160
that in your backpack. The plant scared away the other's shard opportunity. Reset the level to

133
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:55,750
return. I got the bad ending. So wait, that thing kills the town? I have to reset the level. What?

134
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:02,230
Hold on. What happened? Well, the notepad. What did I do? I failed it? Well, I typed in manure.

135
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,400
While the notepad can create many things of vulgarity, copyrighted material and proper

136
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,920
nouns are not allowed. So you're telling me I can't write like Captain America in there and he shows

All right. Clown makeup. All right. Create object. Clown. Hooray! What is going on?

00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:56,759
I'm parked illegally. Oh no. No truck. Use this to attach to multiple objects.

Let's go. Hey. Parking violation. What did you just throw at me? Get that. Whatever it is I want it.

181
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:17,339

182
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:31,140

183
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:44,579
before? It wasn't real art. Yes, it was real art before. I just said that, but I would say I put

184
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:55,660
it in front of the hospital. It's like birds and, and a park bench and like butterflies. All right.

185
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:09,909
What if I do cool instead? I can't change it to cool. It's too late. I can't take, I can't take

186
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:30,809
that off. How about, uh. Well, it's in front of a hospital. How about dogs? I say that while I put

187
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:36,949
fucking cockroaches literally everywhere. Oh, look, I've changed the artwork to like a, a nice,

188
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:43,670
a nice outdoor nature setting. Cockroaches fucking everywhere. Look at so much nicer and wholesome.

189
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:53,019
This is in front of the hospital. We want like a nice park bench, but no, but look at how cute and

190
00:34:53,019 --> 00:35:09,659
wholesome these cockroaches are. Even the big ones. This is just wicked. Okay. I'm going to

00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:53,320
Now quiet, quiet, quiet. Giant cockroach. Are you following me? It's a kid's game. Don't do that.

00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:04,360
It looks terrible. Come on, giant cockroach. Let's go. Remember that time when I visited New York?

196
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:14,710
Remember that time when I visited, uh, God, David really was a family guy joke. Fuck. What does he

00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,539
something to hit the dunk tank without crossing the barrier, but there's nobody in the dunk tank.

202
00:37:43,539 --> 00:38:12,860
Who the fuck is this? Hipster. I can, I can do this to them. No, I can't. I can't keep doing this.

203
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:53,579
It's a microscopic obese hipster. Okay. So what am I supposed to do? Okay. I have to just, okay.

Tiny car. No, it's plus one letter grade. That's one full letter grade. Here you can have it. Okay.

Wait, is he mad? Is he mad at me? What is he doing? Get out of here. Here, you can have this.

215
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:29,619
I stole it back from him. This town is fucking crazy. What's wrong with this town? Oh, here we

216
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:57,500

217
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:16,949
Welcome to the Virgil gallery. What the hell is going on here? All right. What's your deal?

218
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:25,289
One of these artifacts is a fraud. Help me figure out which one. Okay. Um, it's, it's definitely

219
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:48,809
this one. Magnifying. I found it. It's this one. Eat it up. What? Oh, I did it. So that's all for

220
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:55,940
you. What do you, what is this? Finicky patrons help Maxwell provide art that will be sure to

221
00:43:56,019 --> 00:44:12,250
please patrons of the museum. Okay. It's opening day at the museum. Place something in the frames

222
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:20,409
that will be sure to please the museum's patrons. What do you want? Place an item inside the frame

223
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:53,940
that I would find artistic. Uh, CPU, a wires, a wire, wire string. Attach that. That's the other

224
00:44:53,940 --> 00:45:00,179
end of the back of his fucking head and just jolt him with a thousand volts. You like that? That's

225
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:28,599
art. He is the art now. Wait, hold on. Take that off. Right. Adjective. Um, robotic, a robotic wire.

226
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:39,400
I know. Let go of this. What? Now I'm just mocking this guy. I didn't mean, no. Wait, he likes it.

227
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:48,789
I love technology. Like I just attached this to him and then I just attach it to myself and

228
00:45:48,789 --> 00:46:00,710
put myself in robotic clothes. What the fuck am I doing? It is off. Okay. How about, um, I love

229
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:15,510
technology. I don't know. There's no, that doesn't exist. How about a toaster? No, that's not

230
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:27,690
technology. Computer. He loves it. Here comes somebody else. What is something that this

00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:37,860
patron would like to see? Place it in the frame. Okay. Uh, it's a mummy. So I don't know a, uh,

232
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:55,909
let's see. Tomb. Thank you. How's the Maxwell head icon to center the camera on Maxwell?

233
00:46:55,909 --> 00:47:10,920
The next patron is arriving. Play something that, oh, Halloween town. Get this off. All right. You

234
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:25,130
like pumpkins. You must be Halloween themed. Let's do a pumpkin, a skeleton. Wait, he's alive.

235
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:38,840
I can't put him in here. Somebody died in the museum. You actually come into this place.

236
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,679
It's like there's cockroaches everywhere. You walk in here. Oh, wow. A museum. Cool. Somebody

237
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:49,320
died in here. Somebody died a long time ago and they didn't clean it. They didn't get rid of it

238
00:47:51,750 --> 00:48:20,440
and alive. Oh, isn't that kind of a weird, you don't like that? All right. Well, let's do, um,

239
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:37,380
jack-o'-lanterns. It's like what, that's what he's hitting. Oh, okay. Last patron is here.

240
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:46,469
Oh, the invisible man definitely wants to have a, I don't know what an invisible man wants.

241
00:48:46,949 --> 00:49:23,619
Let's see. Nothing. Empty. Empty space. Blank canvas. Uh, toilet paper. No, he, does he wrap

242
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:27,880
himself up with the toilet paper so he can be seen? Wait, no, that's a mummy wrapped himself

243
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:37,860
in toilet paper. Put that over here. Did I just gag that guy? Get that off. Take that off. Here,

244
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:43,750
you can have this. Thanks, I guess. I just kind of wanted to go to the museum. I don't really want

245
00:49:43,750 --> 00:50:19,420
like a roll of toilet paper. Okay. How about, uh, the invisible man? A robe. I can't wear the robes?

246
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:41,239
Why? Okay. Well, here you take this back. It's a picture. You have to think of the click on Lily

247
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:48,920
at the farm to unlock new levels. This game's, no, I didn't want to go back. I just destroyed

248
00:50:48,920 --> 00:51:05,340
that whole city. Whoa. I feel like you'd have a different reaction if you're seeing that.

249
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:14,139
Okay. Where are we going? How about to the hospital? Good link. I'm not sure I can click

250
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:23,989
that link. Last time I alt tabbed the whole game crashed. Okay. Let's help. I'm going to see if I

251
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:41,429
can click this link. Game saves automatically, right? I'm going to make sure. Okay. Tribble

252
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:54,219
Knott's guide for idiot streamers. What? What do you mean for idiot streamers? Okay. Let's see

253
00:51:54,219 --> 00:52:07,639
what it says. Read the guide. It says, click in the top right corner to use the notebook.

254
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:13,800
Edit in the avatar menu to create a custom character. Be more creative, you boring man.

255
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:26,949
I just threw a bomb at a clown, killed a tiny fat hipster with an axe and brought a skeleton

256
00:52:26,949 --> 00:52:32,730
to life and then gagged him with toilet paper. Oh, what's, what's, what do you, what's, what do

257
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:49,780
you mean? Boring and uncreative. All right. So I can make a custom character though.

258
00:52:50,420 --> 00:53:09,559
Edit in the avatar menu. Let's do that. Oh, should I still have a clown in here?

259
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:30,969
Okay. Top right. Open the object editor. View your collection of custom objects. What? Custom object.

260
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:47,739
Write an object without adjectives. Yeah. That's how you write. Where's the object editor? Where's

261
00:53:47,739 --> 00:54:02,579
like the character editor? The avatar menu. Pick avatar. Okay. Hold on. Okay. Edit. All right.

262
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:06,420
Edit and create your own objects here. Turn on help to see tooltips. Okay. So

263
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:22,940
this is a hat. So you can make them. Oh my God. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. This is,

264
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:44,360
I need to look at this for a second. I can have two heads. I can be a fucking ogre. Okay. All right.

265
00:54:44,360 --> 00:55:06,980
That's good. I'm just making, so I don't know. I don't know. It's a charger. I'm going to put his

266
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:27,989
arms up and work it high too. So he's like, he's just like, we get stuffed in neck. This is an Omega

Okay, I can help you. No, no, no. Damn it. Oh, just wait. That was not, you weren't supposed to take

363
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:56,539
that up. I was going to put, go up the ladder, make a platform, put a video camera this way,

364
01:23:56,539 --> 01:24:00,859
and then come down here and put a TV monitor in front of them. I can't do that apparently.

365
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:26,579
How about a fan? Can't do anything right. At least me and the birds can be friends.

366
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:41,050
That was a double kill. They're still alive down here. Yeah, see, they're fine.

boat and put it in the water, isn't that boring berry? You guys gotta pick a side. Huge boat.

397
01:35:54,340 --> 01:36:37,460
Air- air propelled. All right, here. Come on, let's go. Can I not save this guy? Now go. Give him a

398
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:51,590
lifesaver. Balloon works just fine. Now here it comes. Here comes the air. Boring berry. How about

399
01:36:51,590 --> 01:37:02,539
over here? Capital city firehouse. He left trash everywhere. Well, that's just the nature of this

400
01:37:02,539 --> 01:37:15,989
game. I need to look at the part to become a firehouse dog. Okay. How about write an object?

401
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:34,119
Costume. Here you go. No, no, no, no. That was for you. That was for you. I guess I'll put it

402
01:37:34,119 --> 01:38:12,789
on too though. Aw. Wait, what? Here, take this. Can't put that on? Fireman's hat. All right,

403
01:38:12,789 --> 01:38:29,020
how about a hat? Here. Yes. There he goes. Oh. Turn a station wagon into a fire engine.

404
01:38:29,819 --> 01:38:39,859
That was so cute. Okay, all the fire engines are busy. This car needs to become a fire truck. Start

405
01:38:39,859 --> 01:39:04,659
by painting the car. All right. Uh, what are we gonna paint? What? Red? Blood. How about ketchup?

406
01:39:09,699 --> 01:39:43,300
That's technically red. Keyed car. Blood. You can't do blood. Use the ketchup on the car. Can I do

407
01:39:43,300 --> 01:40:09,430
that? Oh, shit. It didn't work. I mean, that's easy. Dude, it's just red. Car needs to be heard.

408
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:28,539
Give the DJ something loud to hook up to the car. Um, sure. Fire alarm. That's a school bell.

409
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:32,970
Fireman's almost ready to head out. Give him a tool that will help get the job done.

410
01:40:41,289 --> 01:40:49,189
It's an axe or it's a fire extinguisher. This is a boring streak. Yeah, but like, yeah, you have to

411
01:40:49,189 --> 01:41:12,979
do it. Yeah. I can't paint the car with blood. Uh, okay. Give me a firefighting tool. It's a bottle

412
01:41:12,979 --> 01:41:29,260
of water. That'll do it. How about a hose? Oh, I attached it to his eye. Oh shit. Here,

413
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:50,979
now take another one. I just like blocked both of his eyes. Bye. Oh no, there's a traffic jam.

414
01:41:50,979 --> 01:42:10,710
Help get over this traffic. Crusted. I just threw it into like toast. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

415
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:21,539
Let me think about this creatively. I could just put a fan here. With the balloons on there,

416
01:42:21,539 --> 01:42:29,050
I could. Okay. Yeah. We're going to, we're going to do the balloon strategy catapult. Hold on. How

417
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:55,750
about a, uh, don't hit me. Holy shit. Did I get that? I did it. All right. All right. Right. Right.

418
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:14,060
Angry gorilla works. Cool. All right. Who's next? Help me test all the alarms. That's the alarms.

419
01:43:14,619 --> 01:43:29,829
Okay. Empty. Yeah. Here. That's the alarms. Okay. Uh, sure. There's an alarm right there.

420
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:49,819
Let's burn that fire. Okay. How about this burning? Let's test the fire alarm. Oh,

421
01:43:50,619 --> 01:43:58,699
wait, I can't get up there. Why not play sound? Take turn. Give me that.

422
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:23,319
I want to climb this. That's cheating. Fire alarm on this floor is functional. Oh, is it?

423
01:44:26,779 --> 01:44:40,779
The wings too big to go up there. I just took off all my clothes. Give me these back. Why can't I

424
01:44:40,779 --> 01:44:54,489
just climb this? Oh, I, uh, test that. What do you guys need? You snore so loudly. I can't sleep.

425
01:44:55,210 --> 01:45:26,060
Okay. Uh, that work. It didn't work. You put that. No, take it off. Take it off. Take it off. I'm

426
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:41,640
sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Muscles didn't work. Okay. How about, um, a, I'm not going

427
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:57,380
to do pillow. Make him deaf. No earplugs. Yeah, but that's so, all right. Earplugs works.

428
01:45:59,189 --> 01:46:06,550
So, so his mouth shut. I think you underestimate the things you can do in scribble knots.

429
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:44,970
Did he just start? Oh, he fell asleep. He, no, he didn't. What's going on? Why is he thinking of

430
01:46:44,970 --> 01:46:50,229
sheep so much? He fell asleep because I gave him the pillow. So he didn't even care. Oh, okay.

431
01:46:51,029 --> 01:47:10,890
What do you need? I can't find my helmet anywhere. Here, I got it. Did I just put a diaper in your

432
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:25,210
makeup cabinet? That's a surprise for later. Uh, how about a top hat? No, this is not my helmet.

433
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:32,739
Mine's in my locker. Give me that back. You don't want it. I'll take it. Wait, is her locker the one

434
01:47:32,739 --> 01:48:00,789
that burnt? Oh, sorry. Uh, ma'am, I'm going to need that back. There. What are you doing up here?

435
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:06,729
Ooh, this is a big one. Help the survivors defend against the zombie invasion.

436
01:48:07,449 --> 01:48:28,699
Did I put on new clothes? Uh, the city has been overrun by zombies. Each of the survivors

437
01:48:28,699 --> 01:48:36,060
needs some help. Start by helping the doctor treat the fireman's wounds. I got it. Medicine.

438
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:57,770
What's wrong with him? He's sick. What's wrong with him though? Um, pills. Pills. Pill. Here,

439
01:48:57,770 --> 01:49:09,720
take this pill. Why do you have to get on top of it? What the fuck was that? This is the gamer's

440
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:15,109
dream. Give her something to help fend off the horde. Oh, it's a gamer's dream. All right,

441
01:49:15,909 --> 01:49:38,460
drag it down. All right, here. What do you need?

442
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:52,380
I know, I get it. All right, it's a gamer's dream. It's not a gamer's dream. Nobody wants to actually

443
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:58,970
be in a zombie apocalypse. That would suck. You would die in 10 minutes. Oh man, I got a plan.

444
01:49:58,970 --> 01:50:03,529
I would go to the grocery store and I would bring like an axe and I'd be fucking killing zombies.

445
01:50:03,529 --> 01:50:06,810
No, you'd get bit. You would, you would take a swing at a zombie and you'd hit it in like

446
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:10,729
the fucking shin and the thing would grab you and two more would grab you and you would get bit in

447
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:23,750
the neck and you're dead instantly. But like here, how about a katana? Yeah, of course a katana.

448
01:50:24,470 --> 01:50:45,180
What do you need? Yeah, you know why it's a dull katana? Because, because you bought it from,

449
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:58,170
you bought it from like fucking QVC. It's, it's not, it's a display. I'm so scared. Make me feel

450
01:50:58,170 --> 01:51:12,119
better. You're now happy. Happy orphan. Apparently. No, no, no, I'm scared. You could be scared and

451
01:51:12,119 --> 01:51:41,779
happy, right? Um, not scared. Zombie, zombie orphan. Well, if you would, if you were a zombie,

452
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:53,000
you wouldn't be scared of them anymore because you would just be one. All right, let's go.

453
01:51:53,640 --> 01:52:10,409
Who's what you locked in here? Okay. All right, let's go. Uh, uh, pills. Take it. Go ahead. Next

454
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:14,489
gamer. What are the, what are the, what are the like fantasies that gamers have in zombie

455
01:52:14,489 --> 01:52:43,350
apocalypses? Sawed off shotgun. Yeah. Calm her down. Okay. Uh, teddy bear, teddy bear, a teddy.

456
01:52:43,909 --> 01:52:53,689
I worked for drugs. No, the soldier is convinced that a few simple objects can be combined to make

457
01:52:53,689 --> 01:53:24,489
a fighting machine. Place three objects inside the box to make a mech. Okay. Microwave and coaster

458
01:53:24,489 --> 01:53:41,619
and coffee maker. If your power is combined, you will make a kitchen appliance monster.

459
01:53:42,180 --> 01:54:00,539
What are you doing? It's not a mech. You what? It's a three objects. You doing it?

460
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:08,810
I could use anything made of metal or something sticky. Oh, well, I got a glue. You didn't tell

461
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:33,989
me how to put the glue in there too. Um, it put like just a cheese sauce in there. Why does the

462
01:54:33,989 --> 01:54:53,979
cheese sauce have health? All right. Microwave, toaster and, um, slime. Oh, you added something

463
01:54:54,060 --> 01:55:13,779
sticky that can be used to join the parts together. All right, let's go. I need a weapon. Um, a

464
01:55:14,659 --> 01:55:36,039
butcher knife, rocket launcher, code, laser, um, toenail, flamethrower, drill, a dentist drill,

465
01:55:36,600 --> 01:56:06,010
a nail clipper, spear. Yeah. Here it comes. It's the final ingredient. Read the prompt.

466
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:22,489
It's three objects inside the box to make a mech. It's on the soldier.

467
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:34,569
Most electronic devices need a similar power. So, oh, come on. There you go. Come on. I can't

468
01:56:34,569 --> 01:56:50,060
just put an outlet in there. Why? How about a, uh, gasoline? There it is. It's not what I put in

469
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:56,630
there. Distract the zombies while the other survivors escape. Hop in the mech when you're

470
01:56:56,630 --> 01:57:08,470
ready to begin. Distract the zombies while the others escape. Okay. Get in the robot. Hold on.

471
01:57:09,029 --> 01:57:30,779
Not yet. I want like a bunch of warrior clowns. Tasty, tasty clowns.

472
01:57:40,939 --> 01:57:44,060
No, no. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out of that. Get out of that. That's for me,

473
01:57:44,060 --> 01:58:00,569
not for you. All right. This is another tasty clown. Okay. This one's going to be a delicious

474
01:58:00,569 --> 01:58:09,770
clown. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't think so. Where are you going?

475
01:58:10,649 --> 01:58:29,449
Oh my God. They're running away because of the zombies. What the fuck? Oh, you're getting over

476
01:58:29,449 --> 01:59:05,529
there. Fire. He's bait. He's a zombie now. That's so funny. Now what? Fire missiles at the zombies

477
01:59:05,529 --> 01:59:38,439
while everyone escapes. That's what I'm doing. All right. Got it. Wait, make an explosive clown?

478
01:59:47,060 --> 02:00:01,340
All right. We're good. Is he going to go inside? Explosive clown fetish? What the hell are you

479
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:25,420
talking about? Succulent clown. Watch out. You're going to get taken away. Oh man. We have more

480
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:29,579
area. How about castle? All right. How about go piss? That sounds like a good idea. I'll be right back.

481
02:02:17,640 --> 02:03:35,829
Okay. Time. Time. How long? How long? How long have I been gone for? How long have I been gone

482
02:03:35,829 --> 02:03:48,710
for? Give me an exact how long I've been actually gone for. Two minutes and what? Two minutes and

483
02:03:48,710 --> 02:03:58,729
11 seconds. Okay. I was peeing the almost entire time I was gone. It took me about

484
02:03:59,619 --> 02:04:04,899
five or six seconds to leave the room and about five or six seconds to come back into the room.

485
02:04:05,699 --> 02:04:13,000
That was the longest pee I've ever done in my entire life. That was insane. I don't understand.

486
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:23,050
It made no sense. How was that possible? Did you wash your hands? Yes, I did. I didn't wash your

487
02:04:23,050 --> 02:04:37,880
hands. Of course I did. I did. I did. Yes, I did. I wash my hands every time. I don't. That was the

488
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:41,079
that was it. It was actually fucked up. Like I'm actually concerned about that. I just peed for

489
02:04:41,079 --> 02:04:51,989
like fucking a full two minutes. Let's go to the forest. Welcome to Meta forest. Oh, there's another

490
02:04:51,989 --> 02:05:14,420
scribble mouse guy. Hungry mosquito. Loaded hungry mosquito. What do you want? Help the scout earn

491
02:05:14,420 --> 02:05:27,270
his merit badge. We're gonna cut this down. All right, you want to do a test here to see if I can

492
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:37,609
do every single one of these tasks with the grenade? What's going on here? Give me a tool to carve this

493
02:05:37,609 --> 02:06:12,949
log. Sharp grenade. I don't think I would ever want. Okay, like sharp grenade? Holy shit, he actually

494
02:06:12,949 --> 02:06:24,699
did it. Fire safety is next. Give the scout something to put out the dummy. Sure, I can do that.

495
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:42,140
Remember this? Oh, I didn't blow that up, right? I had to add a sharp like water grenade.

496
02:06:42,939 --> 02:07:07,619
There. Why did you pull the pin? You don't pull the pin. It was already water covered.

497
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:13,319
Give me something to fix the dummy's wounds. How about a medical grenade?

498
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:40,539
Heal it. A healing grenade. Healing grenade. Here. Look, it's healing. He's gonna throw it.

499
02:07:40,539 --> 02:07:57,979
Give the scout proper safety equipment. You just, you just like spawn drop this? A safety

500
02:07:57,979 --> 02:08:16,310
grenade. Yeah, all right. I'm gonna give you a nice safety grenade. Okay. Am I saying that wrong?

501
02:08:19,319 --> 02:08:43,000
Safe grenade. Give me that back. Resistant grenade. A protective grenade. Interact with what?

502
02:08:46,409 --> 02:09:07,859
Oh, it's a safety grenade. Don't worry. Oh, no, no, no, no. The instructor is shit faced.

503
02:09:07,859 --> 02:09:14,090
And he, I think he just like snorted three lines. Hey, look everybody. No, it's made out of,

504
02:09:14,090 --> 02:09:28,920
I swear it's made out of Play-Doh. With his teeth. Here, why don't you take a saw, man?

505
02:09:31,819 --> 02:09:47,319
Oh, put that fire out and just come over here and help me, man. Man, I thought I'd give you a...

506
02:09:47,960 --> 02:10:00,420
Oh, that didn't work. I'm just making him and I just do it for him. All right, here.

507
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:17,779
Look, I'm gonna, I'm, hold on. So you need to put this out. Uh, no, put it out. Give me it. Oh,

508
02:10:17,779 --> 02:10:20,659
no, no, no, no. No more of the grenade stuff. No more grenade stuff. I don't care. I'm taking

509
02:10:20,659 --> 02:10:25,539
my clothes off. Who cares? Oh, no, the instructor. The instructor's actually fucking going crazy.

510
02:10:33,819 --> 02:10:49,060
Okay. Here. Take a, just here. Just take a fucking squirt gun. Good work. Let's fix the wounds of the

511
02:10:49,060 --> 02:11:06,229
dummy. Here, a medical squirt gun. You're giving a gun to a kid. It's a squirt gun. All right.

512
02:11:06,229 --> 02:11:15,020
Safety equipment. How about, okay. Eye goggles. But how about like blacked out eye goggles?

513
02:11:15,979 --> 02:11:26,920
That help them? Give them a blindfold. Yeah, these are for me so I can see this fucking hilarious

514
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:43,189
show. Give them a weapon. Just put a pinata up here. Okay. Here. Oh, wait, wait, wait, here.

515
02:11:43,909 --> 02:12:05,369
Oh, wait. I can't. What do they use? Like a pool cue? All right. Spin them around like three times.

516
02:12:06,090 --> 02:12:51,670
Rope. Small. Smaller. Shallow. Trunking. Tiny. Shit. All right. I'm just going to put him up

517
02:12:51,670 --> 02:13:11,699
with a balloon. That's way too hard. All right. He's not going to hit that. Tiny rope. Microscopic

518
02:13:11,699 --> 02:13:34,420
rope. Short rope maybe. No. Trunk. Compact. Whatever. He's ready. Give me a weapon. Oops.

519
02:13:34,420 --> 02:14:09,020
I'm going to make the balloon small. Balloon. Can't interact with it? Oh, here it comes.

520
02:14:09,020 --> 02:14:17,109
Like really, really like wealthy birthday party. We have two pinatas. I can't interact with it.

521
02:14:17,109 --> 02:14:47,029
Give me the wings. Small balloon. That's not going to help. No. No matter. How about, yeah, weak.

522
02:14:50,789 --> 02:15:01,000
Tiny weak balloon. Attach the rope to the ground. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

523
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:40,579
Wait. Don't. I can't. Just attach it to him. Who gives a shit? Ah. Hooray. It's done. All right.

524
02:15:40,579 --> 02:16:04,789
How do I move the camera? There we go. Holy shit. You suck. Holy shit. That was terrible.

02:53:08,600 --> 02:53:18,329
to be up here. Get out of here. Okay, actually get out of here. Actually get out. Actually,

656
02:53:18,329 --> 02:53:23,370
I gotta kill this guy. That's not what, get rid of this guy. Seriously, get him out. Yeah,

657
02:53:23,370 --> 02:53:27,450
that's not what I'm trying to say. Get all this out of here. I don't want any fires or anything.

658
02:53:28,809 --> 02:53:36,860
Get everybody the fuck out of here. Now. Now. Good. He's gone. Okay. Now we're gonna put

659
02:53:37,420 --> 02:53:45,860
shit that kids play with toys and stuff. Toys. A toy here. Look, a little car. Isn't that cool?

660
02:53:45,860 --> 02:53:56,840
Good. And a tea set here. Look, kids like that and a little bed, like a little kid bed

661
02:53:59,049 --> 02:54:09,319
and, um, a little, a boat. Sure. Get out of here. Don't come near the boat.

662
02:54:10,760 --> 02:54:28,489
The engine is on. Get off. Get away. Get out. He really likes the bed. A toy boat.

663
02:54:34,120 --> 02:54:49,879
He loves it. And a tub. A tub. A bathtub. Okay. He's all right. Get out. Get him out.

664
02:54:54,469 --> 02:54:57,110
Get him out. Get him out. Get him out. Get him out. Get him out. Get him out. Get him out.

665
02:55:02,489 --> 02:55:08,040
All right. He's happy. I didn't kill anybody. The baby is perfectly fine.

666
02:55:08,760 --> 02:55:33,299
Look. What do you kids like? I don't know. Like bubble gum. Oh, wait. No. Here. Bubble gum.

667
02:55:37,110 --> 02:55:56,149
And a diary. And, um, that's it. All right. Bye, guys. Have fun. I'll be back in like an hour.

668
02:55:56,709 --> 02:56:07,270
What do you want in life? It's just burning out here. Three things he wanted in life. Give me a

669
02:56:07,270 --> 02:56:17,750
sword, a dragon, and a princess. Well, I just spoiled it. There you go. And we'll make it a

670
02:56:17,750 --> 02:56:55,139
huge dragon. Why am I on it? Why is he wet? Why am I still wet? Did I do everything? Oh, ghost hunter.

671
02:56:55,139 --> 02:57:11,670
I got it. Why do I have a gun? Where are the kids? Okay. I'm just saying. I just, that freaked me

672
02:57:11,670 --> 02:57:13,989
out for a second. I was like, why are there spiders everywhere? And where are the kids?

673
02:57:14,549 --> 02:57:24,760
It was all a dream. All right. All right. Let's keep going. Let's go to, I don't know what this is.

674
02:57:24,760 --> 02:57:46,600
Let's do it. The underline. I still have a gun. I'm so hungry and this machine is empty. Oh,

675
02:57:46,600 --> 02:58:00,010
all right. Here. Wait, I have a gun. Edible gun. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

676
02:58:00,010 --> 02:58:06,409
no. Absolutely not. Absolutely a thousand percent no. Okay. Uh, how about, um, grass?

677
02:58:07,290 --> 02:58:55,260
Disgusting edible grass. Disgusting heart grass. Wait, what? Oh, wait. He's going to keep paying

678
02:58:55,260 --> 02:59:01,639
for it. All right. Take it out. Take it out. I just made a new word. Okay. I didn't do an adjective.

679
02:59:02,729 --> 02:59:27,930
All right. Disgusting edible grass. Eat it. Just eat it, man. It's not a big deal. Fine. Here.

680
02:59:46,809 --> 03:00:00,180
It has to be edible. Okay. Here you go. You don't want this delicious edible trash?

681
03:00:00,979 --> 03:00:27,850
What is this? Wrapper? All right. Go get it. Oh, just throw this away. All right. There you go.

682
03:00:27,850 --> 03:01:02,819
Delicious wrapper in there. I'm so hungry. This machine is empty. How is a glass raw? No, no,

683
03:01:02,819 --> 03:01:43,340
stop, stop, stop. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Just put it down. It's going to break. Don't touch that.

684
03:01:43,340 --> 03:02:27,350
It's not ready. It's not ready. I mean, you can put the adjectives in while you make the object though.

685
03:02:27,350 --> 03:03:01,899
Why won't he buy this? He has money for a coin. Take that and spend it on this. An edible vending

686
03:03:01,899 --> 03:03:26,540
machine in the edible vending machine. I can't. I can't. I can't. Hold on. What happened? Why won't

687
03:03:26,540 --> 03:03:54,040
he go? Why won't he buy this? Did I fuck it up somehow? He needs a wallet. Oh, reset. How

688
03:03:54,040 --> 03:04:02,180
did I get over here? All right. Well, new thing. I want to buy something from that stand, but I'm

689
03:04:02,180 --> 03:04:46,389
broke. What an IOU. No, not the ICU. What about valuable bacon? There you go. You have valuable

690
03:04:46,389 --> 03:05:16,459
trash. What do you want to buy? Uh, a what's the opposite of frugal? You just don't give a shit.

691
03:05:19,750 --> 03:05:33,260
Not stingy, generous, opulent. The game know that word. All right. They made the transaction.

692
03:05:34,389 --> 03:05:55,290
Uh, valuable trash for a bag of money. Yeah, it's one coin. You don't even have this back.

693
03:06:00,100 --> 03:06:05,899
Oh, wait. Old ladies help walking across the sewer. I'm tired of standing. All right. Let's make a

694
03:06:05,899 --> 03:06:44,549
chair. What just happened? Doesn't have any wheels. Help the street performer develop his career as a

695
03:06:44,549 --> 03:06:57,879
rock star. Let's go. Should have done electric chair. Oh fucking God. No one even said that in

696
03:06:57,879 --> 03:07:03,139
chat. I just pretended that they did. He wants to be a rock star. First needs a better instrument

697
03:07:03,139 --> 03:07:25,739
to help him rock. Okay. It's better. Yeah. That sucks, dude. I was kind of hoping that. Wait,

698
03:07:26,459 --> 03:07:38,780
hold on a minute. Like a musically talented animal. How about, um, a talented, uh, talented

699
03:07:38,780 --> 03:07:58,309
chimpanzee. And we're going to give him a guitar. This instrument is awesome, but my bandwagon

700
03:07:58,309 --> 03:08:06,729
sounded a lot better with additional members. All right. Well, hold on. So we need more members,

701
03:08:06,729 --> 03:08:24,860
talented chimpanzee, musical gorilla, your lead singer. That's what I call a band. What we need

702
03:08:24,860 --> 03:08:31,299
now is equipment to put on a real show. What happened to my character? Why does he look like

703
03:08:31,299 --> 03:08:46,840
this? Uh, lights. Is he going to hold it up like a lighter? He's going to like, he's going to hold

704
03:08:46,840 --> 03:09:04,870
it up with like a people to the phones now, right? Uh, what, um, stage. All right, here we go. Let's

705
03:09:04,870 --> 03:09:22,420
start the party. You know how horrifying this would be if the street performer on the subway

706
03:09:23,459 --> 03:09:33,510
had a gorilla and a chimpanzee just walking around. Oh my God, that'd be horrifying.

707
03:09:34,459 --> 03:09:38,620
I don't care how well-trained a gorilla is. I don't care how friendly in quotes a gorilla is.

708
03:09:39,340 --> 03:09:45,500
It takes a 10th of a second for them to like, not like the logo on your shirt or something.

709
03:09:45,500 --> 03:09:48,139
And boom, your head is smashed into a thousand pieces.

710
03:09:52,059 --> 03:10:07,299
Nope. I don't care how well-trained they are. That's scary. That was a Joe Rogan. That was a Joe

711
03:10:07,299 --> 03:10:26,120
Rogan bit. All that shit up Jamie. Did he say that before? He's getting closer and closer to dying.

712
03:10:26,120 --> 03:10:47,930
All right. What about back here? Sewer runoff. Yeah, let's go to the sewer. Well, okay. What

713
03:10:47,930 --> 03:11:13,739
we got? The other fish keep making fun of me. Help me scare them away. A gun photo.

714
03:11:14,780 --> 03:11:36,139
Oh, picture of a picture or gun. Oh, how about just gun picture? Golf picture. Here,

715
03:11:36,860 --> 03:12:02,629
give it to him. You can't do gun guys. Gun and knife don't work. You need to make them like big,

716
03:12:03,350 --> 03:12:18,200
inflated, like huge. Wait, he's gonna fly. Okay. He's dead. I'm ready for a new school to move in.

717
03:12:19,559 --> 03:12:50,969
Ooh, crate. Um, cuppy. Come on in. Yeah. What's wrong with you? Blowing large goldfish. I've always

718
03:12:50,969 --> 03:13:01,190
lived down here and don't know what I look like. Attack. I'm not deaf. We need to give him a mirror.

719
03:13:23,129 --> 03:13:27,610
Wait, did I just like tell him that beauty is on the inside in a weird metaphorical way?

720
03:13:28,250 --> 03:13:46,440
Oh, all right. Oh, he's scared. Oh, well, wait, let's go. You're too slow.

721
03:13:50,329 --> 03:14:06,020
I'm sorry, but it's fine. You can be slow if you want. Make him fast. That's not very fast.

722
03:14:13,780 --> 03:14:48,139
Speedy. I can't even fit down the hallway. All right, let's go. You and I are friends.

723
03:14:48,139 --> 03:15:03,909
What's this even here? Oh, there's a guy down here. Be a bro and help me break free.

724
03:15:10,620 --> 03:15:21,979
Be a bro. Oh, he was a criminal. He was a criminal. Oh, he was a criminal. I was supposed to like

725
03:15:21,979 --> 03:15:35,209
kill him. Is that what it wanted me to do? Why was it? Did I not get the star for that? It was

726
03:15:35,209 --> 03:15:38,409
help me break free. And it was like, you broke the criminal for you. Did the game want me to like,

727
03:15:39,209 --> 03:15:46,840
why is there a cage down here? Was he like a murderer or something? I don't get it.

728
03:15:47,479 --> 03:16:00,170
That was my brother. What am I talking about? He was my brother. I don't know. There's a cage

729
03:16:00,170 --> 03:16:03,850
down here and he's throwing it. It's like, oh, you'll let the criminal free. I don't know. Wait,

730
03:16:04,170 --> 03:16:10,329
you might have killed 10 people. I don't know. Oh, that was fun. Let's go. Can I take him with me?

731
03:16:17,770 --> 03:16:24,920
Wait, fill the cage with something. I'm not putting him in the cage. I know a ton of you guys are

732
03:16:24,920 --> 03:16:37,319
going to be like, oh, I put him nowhere. Not in a million years. Save the lobsters. Fool the fishermen

733
03:16:37,319 --> 03:17:23,260
by filling their trap with something else to eat. Someone just sponges. It's because it was electric.

734
03:17:28,889 --> 03:17:38,760
Yeah, put the electric huge, like 10,000 watt device down here with me. But wait,

735
03:17:38,760 --> 03:17:45,620
didn't we talk about this already when that not happened? I told you guys, listen, for those that

736
03:17:45,620 --> 03:17:53,860
weren't here like a year ago, me and chat got into a big fight because I said, hey, like if you drop

737
03:17:53,860 --> 03:17:58,020
a fucking toaster plugged in into the ocean, like will it shock the, what would happen? What happens?

738
03:17:59,770 --> 03:18:04,090
Everyone's like, you're crazy. No, no, no. What would have shocked the whole thing?

739
03:18:04,809 --> 03:18:15,829
It was a hit man. Yeah. Okay. Let's, let's do something bigger than that. The whole ocean.

740
03:18:15,829 --> 03:18:21,350
No. Okay. What if you were, hold on, but what if you were standing like a hundred feet away

741
03:18:21,350 --> 03:18:30,819
of where it was dropped in? No, you asked. I wait, I am totally, I'm totally just like

742
03:18:30,819 --> 03:18:35,379
gaslighting you guys on this. I asked if I dropped my iPhone in the bathtub, if I was in it, if it

743
03:18:35,379 --> 03:18:46,709
would kill me. Oh, right, right, right, right. Okay. Lightning hits the ocean all the time.

744
03:18:46,709 --> 03:18:49,270
All right. But what if you were in, don't, don't they tell you to get out of the water

745
03:18:49,829 --> 03:19:10,120
during a storm? I thought that was a big deal. They do say that. Yeah, they do. What's taller

746
03:19:10,120 --> 03:19:24,250
than the ocean. That's in case lighting hits you. Oh, he's alive. All right. Put some edible in here.

747
03:19:36,219 --> 03:20:01,399
Can't move this. They're saying light, holdable, edible diaper in there. Pick up. There we go.

748
03:20:01,399 --> 03:20:19,940
Okay. So this is, it's in there. He didn't eat that, did he? Oh shit, he did. Wait, he's already

749
03:20:19,940 --> 03:20:34,920
like toxic. All right. What did they want me to do? No, don't, don't, it's a, do not put that,

750
03:20:34,920 --> 03:20:52,329
something else. I just did the thing that they were trying to do. They're going to pull that up

751
03:20:52,329 --> 03:21:10,680
and they're going to be like, ah, eh, remove the waste. There must be a better way to dispose of

752
03:21:10,680 --> 03:22:02,260
this. Eat edible, vegan, edible, vegan, rich, edible, vegan. Right. Okay. Hold on. Hungry, vegan,

753
03:22:02,260 --> 03:22:18,920
vegan, edible, toxic waste. I spell hungry wrong. It's my way. It's not, it's not hungry. Yes, it

754
03:22:18,920 --> 03:22:55,930
is. Tasty, tasty, tasty, vegetarian. What did I just do? Hey, a tasty vegetarian. Okay. Edible

755
03:22:55,930 --> 03:23:21,700
broccoli toxic waste. But, um, as Matt leaning, I just blow it up. Vegan, edible, toxic waste.

756
03:23:21,700 --> 03:23:32,360
Then we have a glowing large vegetarian starving goldfish. Vegan, edible, toxic waste.

757
03:23:36,840 --> 03:23:56,149
Make it non-toxic. Okay. Edible, non-toxic. What? Really? So I'll just make the toxic material

758
03:23:56,149 --> 03:24:12,440
non-toxic. That's it. Oh, well, I guess it was that easy. All right. Now we got a few,

759
03:24:12,440 --> 03:24:14,680
I want to go to one of the later areas over here. Let's go to the fountain.

760
03:24:16,459 --> 03:24:36,620
And a four falls. That's drunk. What are they doing? Bring shock off, bring shock off. Bring. Can I,

761
03:24:37,260 --> 03:24:45,020
can I bring nothing? I can't feel the sunlight by the river. It creates something to help me tan.

762
03:24:45,899 --> 03:25:10,760
This is his like human skin and his jerky body. Oh, come here. Give me this.

763
03:25:11,479 --> 03:25:35,829
But this should have put, yeah, I want to put, I want to take this. Whoa, frog. Place something

764
03:25:35,829 --> 03:26:02,659
in between these logs to help me cross the river. Didn't help. How about some logs? How about a

765
03:26:02,659 --> 03:26:21,979
bridge? So, but that's so easy to do, right? It's, oh, I made a bridge. Wow. Turn a businessman into

766
03:26:21,979 --> 03:26:56,790
a fisherman. Nah, not yet. Hey, look what I got, man. Natural, natural, non-human. Uh, this person's

767
03:26:56,790 --> 03:27:04,969
dead. What am I doing? Oh, shit. Hold on. What's wrong? Trying marketer. Please reunite me with my

768
03:27:04,969 --> 03:27:34,219
love. What? This person's dead? Oh, okay. Who resurrects people? Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

769
03:27:34,780 --> 03:27:45,799
No, not all of us. He did it to the frog. Oh, shit. He's actually a Diablo two necromancer.

770
03:27:47,370 --> 03:28:00,680
All right. I'm sorry, but I'm going to give me a steak. Stab him through the fucking heart.

771
03:28:06,020 --> 03:28:35,239
All right. Now I release you. Whoa. I, I'm, whatever. Leave me alone. Give it to me.

772
03:28:47,510 --> 03:29:01,559
Cleanse the undead. Okay. Cleanse. No, now I need a priest. What the fuck is a priest going to do?

773
03:29:01,559 --> 03:29:11,110
No, I need like a paladin. All right. Paladin. There we go. All right. Save me. Holy shit.

774
03:29:11,110 --> 03:29:15,590
That, all right. Sorry. That's my bad. That's my bad. That's my bad. I spawned a level one paladin.

775
03:29:16,659 --> 03:29:26,540
That, that's what would happen. Okay. What a shitty character. How about a sorcerer?

776
03:29:26,540 --> 03:29:42,149
Go get it. How do I, how do you suppose, Zamboni? What is that? They're dead? Oh, they are dead.

777
03:29:42,149 --> 03:30:05,700
I'll take the septid though. What? What? Being a businessman, how to fish. This man dreams of

778
03:30:05,700 --> 03:30:19,879
being a fisherman. Start by dressing him appropriately. Fisherman hat. Fibered hat.

779
03:30:21,159 --> 03:30:31,180
Firm, a fishable hat. Yes. That's exactly what I was thinking of. Next, he needs to catch some

780
03:30:31,180 --> 03:30:46,870
fish. Give him an object to reel them in. Bass is not biting. Place something in the water that it

781
03:30:46,870 --> 03:31:19,620
wants. Fish like cheese, right? Nice. Oh, it's an even bigger one. Time to catch the rainbow halibut.

782
03:31:19,620 --> 03:31:47,590
It has more colorful taste. Oh, I like eating colorful food. Sherbert. Good catch. Now I have

783
03:31:47,590 --> 03:32:09,620
to catch a fudge megalodon. Give the megalodon its dinner. No, it's going to kill it. What's a

784
03:32:09,620 --> 03:32:16,360
megalodon's favorite dinner? It's like, it's like people or other huge, or how about like blue whale?

785
03:32:16,920 --> 03:32:35,780
How big is this? It's huge, right? What's for dinner? It's a fudge megalodon.

786
03:32:40,120 --> 03:33:27,459
Uh, no. There. Hooray! You did it. That's a big dolphin. That's definitely rideable too. He just

787
03:33:27,459 --> 03:33:37,370
like went off and like nibbled on his grenade actually. Wait, you just turned it into a

788
03:33:37,370 --> 03:33:41,860
skeleton. What'd you just do? You turned something into a skeleton to kill it. What was that? Help me

789
03:33:41,860 --> 03:34:00,059
sail again. Oh, okay. Uh, here. What the fuck are you doing? She's going after the priest. The priest

790
03:34:00,059 --> 03:34:09,700
bailed the fuck out of here and got out and was safe. She's going after the priest. She'd known

791
03:34:09,700 --> 03:34:18,090
he peeked his head up behind the rock. He was like, are they gone yet? Oh shit. Help me sail again.

792
03:34:18,969 --> 03:34:47,879
Okay. Um, what did I just get? I leveled up something. Oh, you stole the scepter. Wait,

793
03:34:47,879 --> 03:35:04,950
did she just take that from you? What happened here? Okay. Help me sail again. Wait, there's a

794
03:35:04,950 --> 03:35:11,500
big fish over there. What am I doing? The priest became a holy warrior. Oh, okay. All right. Let's

795
03:35:11,500 --> 03:35:50,889
fix this boat. Uh, fix the engine. Fuck this. Let's use this one. Glue broken on boat. Blue.

796
03:35:51,530 --> 03:36:25,739
Okay. Well, should I, I gotta get it out of the water. Look at these all alive. Balloons.

797
03:36:25,739 --> 03:36:29,579
Why would a balloon take like a 10,000 pound, 20,000 pound boat out of the water?

798
03:36:30,139 --> 03:36:54,260
Strong balloon. Okay. I gotta get rid of this thing. I hate this thing. All right. Come on,

799
03:36:54,260 --> 03:37:15,190
pull it up. There it is. All right. What's wrong with it? It's got a problem. What we need to do?

800
03:37:15,190 --> 03:37:35,510
Fix, uh, blue. All right. Stick that on there. Technically, it did it. This bird over here is

801
03:37:35,510 --> 03:37:43,700
like, holy shit. You see what was just in the sky? Okay. I noticed an attack and shot a crossbow at

802
03:37:43,700 --> 03:37:59,159
it. It was flex seal. Yeah. That's pretty, yeah. It was flex seal. How do I get up there? I'm here

803
03:37:59,159 --> 03:38:17,129
with flex seal. I can even put it over my mouth to make me stop talking. I don't kill that bird.

804
03:38:17,129 --> 03:38:22,180
Let the bird up. Why is there a bird? What the, why was there a bird in there? Why was there a

805
03:38:22,180 --> 03:38:38,469
bird inside of the chest? I don't even know who that was. I, I, I'm going to say this and I don't

806
03:38:38,469 --> 03:38:43,700
know if it's real or not, but I'm going to just think it is. You know how there are people make

807
03:38:43,700 --> 03:38:52,389
slime videos. I feel like flex seal is some of that kind of stuff like flex putty and flex seal.

808
03:38:52,389 --> 03:38:56,069
Do people make videos of them just like scooping it up and smearing it all over a

809
03:38:56,069 --> 03:39:15,129
piece of wood or something? I would assume, right? Holy shit. I love this guy. Help me

810
03:39:15,129 --> 03:39:39,690
practice my painting. Paintbrush. Wow. It's beautiful. I love it. What's going on over here?

811
03:39:40,969 --> 03:39:45,670
Help me take a picture with this local. I want to dance, but I don't have a beat to follow.

812
03:39:45,670 --> 03:40:07,670
I can solve that very quickly. Does that count? I'm going to take a picture.

813
03:40:08,229 --> 03:40:30,299
You don't have a camera? Here, camera. Take it. Oh, I have the photo. Did it work? I think it

814
03:40:30,299 --> 03:40:39,350
worked. The gorilla has something he wants. We only allow gorillas in our troop and you are no

815
03:40:39,350 --> 03:41:39,270
gorilla. Yet. Get these wings off. I can't go in the gorilla suit? Oh shit. I didn't want to do that.

816
03:41:39,270 --> 03:41:49,860
Take your clothes off. I don't have any clothes on. We only allow gorillas. You are no gorilla.

817
03:41:50,420 --> 03:42:21,989
Move out of the way. Get out of the way. Blind them? No, that didn't work. Uh, where is this

818
03:42:21,989 --> 03:42:29,030
person? No, no, they're not going to walk off the edge. They don't have that kind of pathing.

819
03:42:29,030 --> 03:43:06,620
I need a gorilla costume. Get in. No, it didn't. Okay. A monkey suit. Why can't I wear it? You

820
03:43:06,620 --> 03:43:28,520
have to edit your avatar? No. Edit your adjectives. Suspect small gorilla like? Gorilla mask? No.

821
03:43:29,079 --> 03:43:44,309
Gorilla like. A gorilla like mask. We only allow gorillas. Wait, you're going to take the eye thing

822
03:43:44,309 --> 03:43:54,389
off so you can see. Hey, look at me. I'm a gorilla. Look, you only allow gorillas and you are no

823
03:43:54,389 --> 03:44:14,809
gorilla. What? He's not blind? Is he blind? Look, I'm one of you. Good sized fatherly musical silver

824
03:44:14,809 --> 03:44:25,100
back gorilla. Motherly musical silver back gorilla. The suit on the, on the chimp? What are you talking

825
03:44:25,100 --> 03:44:32,780
about? There's too many of these. Greet each monkey's human friend. What about the monkey?

826
03:44:33,500 --> 03:45:19,930
He needs a gorilla like mask too? Gorilla like on yourself. Suspect gorilla like. I'm too small to

827
03:45:19,930 --> 03:45:33,559
wear the costume. Really? That's so annoying. All right, now who? Nobody left? Oh, there's one more.

828
03:45:33,559 --> 03:45:51,620
Where is it? Oh, right here. This game is really cute and really fun. Each monkey has a hobby.

829
03:45:51,620 --> 03:45:55,379
Create a human that has similar taste to each monkey. Start by making someone for the musical

830
03:45:55,379 --> 03:46:14,709
monkey. Okay, fine. I don't know what's attached to me. Monkey tail on furry ears. Did I sit on

831
03:46:14,709 --> 03:46:29,219
top of something? How is that monkey? Bat wings. All right. What did I get? Okay. You want somebody

832
03:46:29,219 --> 03:46:42,709
that likes music? How about a composer? All right. You. Flying monkey grew wings after drinking a

833
03:46:42,709 --> 03:46:54,250
potion creates someone for this magical monkey. A witch. Warlock. Is he riding the crossbow?

834
03:46:57,180 --> 03:47:13,299
Whatever. This computer savvy monkey loves playing video games. Create a friend for this monkey.

835
03:47:13,299 --> 03:47:34,120
The you player? How about a youngster? You. This monkey is also wearing a rooster hat.

836
03:47:34,120 --> 03:47:52,680
Create a friend for this monkey. Well, a rooster, of course. Or yeah. What does edgy even mean? I

837
03:47:52,680 --> 03:48:16,340
don't get it. Hooray. I got one. And that's it for that. It's about to cover her head.

838
03:48:16,340 --> 03:48:42,309
I love this game. It really is just fun. Even more locations. Holy shit. There's a lot.

839
03:48:43,030 --> 03:49:02,600
All right. How about. Should I do the pirate one? The penitentiary. Hold on. Welcome to the paper

840
03:49:02,600 --> 03:49:15,270
and penitentiary. Give me something to blend into the environment and make me escape.

841
03:49:18,420 --> 03:49:45,850
Uh, blend into the environment. Like a prison suit. Okay. Uh, sure. What about you?

842
03:49:46,569 --> 03:50:13,059
All supervillains have an evil animal companion. I need one. Uh, what do you. Okay. Why was he

843
03:50:13,059 --> 03:50:17,459
swinging that at me? That was weird. We need someone who would want to watch these televisions

844
03:50:17,459 --> 03:50:49,079
all day. All right. Security guard. I was going to say like, I'm like a gamer. I'm a chatter.

845
03:50:49,159 --> 03:50:59,540
I would, I would think that'd be fun. Gamer. I was going to write streamer,

846
03:50:59,540 --> 03:51:08,340
YouTuber, but they don't know what that is. What does, why is this chat? Hey guys, I'm coming.

847
03:51:09,219 --> 03:51:20,389
Yeah. Self-proclaimed gamer. Uh, excuse me. I beat Hades in less than 10 tries. I got to the last

848
03:51:20,389 --> 03:51:26,969
boss in Hades in less than 10 tries and beat him. I mean, it just watched it last night. I'm a

849
03:51:26,969 --> 03:51:34,329
certified gamer at least for a little while. Who cares? Apparently not you.

850
03:51:35,209 --> 03:51:45,209
Conceal something in my cake to help my friend burrow through the prison walls.

851
03:52:25,989 --> 03:52:39,430
That two or three seconds later, that was a distance explosion. You're letting

852
03:52:39,430 --> 03:52:45,139
criminals out of prison. Whatever. All right. Let's do this one. What's this?

853
03:52:47,659 --> 03:52:50,700
Each prisoner, eh, give him a reminder of home.

854
03:53:05,510 --> 03:53:10,200
Baste, base, base. What, what? I was bored. I want to do those based.

855
03:53:11,319 --> 03:53:14,280
Each person needs a cellmate that they have something in common with.

856
03:53:15,000 --> 03:53:32,120
Okay. He wants to be involved with sports. Eh, how about a coach? Here we are. I thought they

857
03:53:32,120 --> 03:53:36,659
were zombies for a second. The halfling was captured during an important quest. Give the

858
03:53:36,659 --> 03:53:52,360
halfling a member of her adventuring party. A wizard. Saxophone player misses making music

859
03:53:52,360 --> 03:54:17,180
with others. Write someone to join the band. A jolly pianist. The actress misses practicing

860
03:54:17,979 --> 03:54:24,620
her lines with other lesbians. Write someone from the movie industry that can shoot pra, pra. Yeah.

861
03:54:24,620 --> 03:54:54,700
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why am I in a police uniform? Sorry, honey. Wait, we're not like

03:55:04,819 --> 03:55:18,700
girlfriend in here. It's not visiting my girlfriend in prison. Yeah. How about with the director?

864
03:55:20,540 --> 03:55:26,309
Throw a ball pot on the ground like that. It's an accomplished actor.

865
03:55:30,920 --> 03:55:51,750
Scientist needs somebody to share concepts with. Uh, doctor. Uh, Gordon Freeman. Gordon Foreman.

866
03:55:51,750 --> 03:56:07,319
Gordon Freemason. Gooey Freemason. It's just the half life porn parody.

867
03:56:18,200 --> 03:56:42,120
Gordon, Gordon Freemason. Deleted. How about, I don't know, who would be like a history teacher?

868
03:56:42,120 --> 03:57:00,809
Who would be interested in this? Uh, chemist. This cosplayer is a huge fan of video games and anime.

Write someone from nerd culture that he can talk to. Oh, this is my opportunity.

870
03:57:21,219 --> 03:57:31,379

03:58:16,069 --> 03:58:46,040
now that was faulty. Nevermind. Sexy new console. Shiny new console. How about pinball machine pog?

873
03:58:50,180 --> 03:59:06,659
Seriously, none of this stuff, you're into this? You don't want pinball. You don't want the anime

874
03:59:06,659 --> 03:59:19,299
DVD. You don't want the brand new console. You're a gamer and you love anime. How about that? A

Yeah, well done. This person's pretty pog. Kind of is. Uh, I think I crashed it. What happened?

888
04:02:58,180 --> 04:03:21,590
All right, let's go. Yep. He wants a party member wizard. You're good. It didn't work. Quad? Well,

889
04:03:21,590 --> 04:03:24,950
you didn't get a wizard. You didn't get a party member, but you got a fucking quad.

890
04:03:51,270 --> 04:04:01,620
Saxophonic player. You? What? Why is this character like a weird evil? What's the evil

892
04:04:36,329 --> 04:04:51,479
What the hell is in here? Why is this in here? Why did you just shit out a nuclear bomb?

893
04:04:58,040 --> 04:05:24,309
Why is the gamer in here? That can scientific opinion. Let's get it. Let's get a garlic

894
04:05:24,309 --> 04:05:53,659
scientist's opinion on this whole thing. Game of the year. It's literally the red button meme.

895
04:05:53,659 --> 04:06:00,940
That's why I'm not pressing it. I'm not going to press it. I'm not going to press it. I know

896
04:06:00,940 --> 04:06:06,709
that you all here. Here it comes. Good. I got to get the fuck out of here now before something bad

897
04:06:06,709 --> 04:06:13,610
happens. I didn't press it. I didn't press the button. I didn't press it. I didn't press it.

898
04:06:13,610 --> 04:06:28,040
Why are they killing each other? Criminal sledgehammer? Why is there a criminal sledgehammer?

899
04:06:28,600 --> 04:06:43,030
Bulletproof. Obluthophic nuke. I don't know what that second word means, but goodbye.

900
04:06:43,750 --> 04:07:11,989
It's a rate of bathing. That's weird. Obliphonic? He's a gamer. No. What is this guy?

901
04:07:13,030 --> 04:07:19,190
Uh, excuse me. Gamer. Here's your opportunity. I want to talk to someone who will help me down

902
04:07:19,190 --> 04:08:07,139
the righteous path. Well, that didn't work. A teacher. I don't know. Yeah. Jesus Christ.

903
04:08:11,340 --> 04:08:30,780
Chris Christ. All right. That's it. No, there's two more. Oh shit. What about you? Jesus Chris.

904
04:08:31,420 --> 04:08:46,440
Oh, there's another thing right there. Come closer. Come closer. Come closer. Where the hell are all

905
04:08:46,440 --> 04:08:55,299
these new people? Show me something from the yard I was stolen from. All right. Grass. Cactus. There.

906
04:08:58,170 --> 04:09:03,559
Hooray. Show me something that the Easter bunny likes. Living here hinders my creativity. Help

907
04:09:03,559 --> 04:09:27,780
me paint this egg. Blonde egg. Oh, that's the same color. We didn't do anything. Help Maxwell escape

908
04:09:27,780 --> 04:09:47,959
from the prison. Maxwell needs to escape prison. Give the tired guard a place to sit and he might

909
04:09:47,959 --> 04:10:08,489
unlock the gate. All right, get off of it. Iron maiden. The guard unlocked the door. Now a ghost

910
04:10:08,489 --> 04:10:13,370
stands in the way. He can't open the door without a physical presence. All right,

911
04:10:13,370 --> 04:10:36,340
are you going to get off of it? Just get off. I just took his only defense. Get off. You idiot.

912
04:10:38,260 --> 04:11:07,829
I'm going to kill this chair. All right, let's go. It doesn't fit in here.

913
04:11:07,829 --> 04:11:21,860
Whatever. It's a place to sit down. I repeat. I'm under attack by the chair. Need backup.

914
04:11:22,420 --> 04:12:04,069
I need a physical body. Sure. Hey, it worked. The ghost scared the door open. Now a prisoner is

915
04:12:04,069 --> 04:12:21,110
craving a hearty meal. Give him something filling. Hmm. Hearty meal. Eggs benedict. Eggs benedict.

916
04:12:21,110 --> 04:12:50,969
Over easy. Over easy benedict. How is it? Prisoner destroyed the door. A con man has agreed to help

917
04:12:50,969 --> 04:12:57,270
Maxwell. But he needs to disguise himself as an officer to fool the camera. This guy has a

918
04:12:57,270 --> 04:13:31,319
cannibal. He need a disguise. How about a police officer outfit? Police oiled? Police official.

919
04:13:31,959 --> 04:14:05,219
Pricy official costume. What? No, I called uniforms. Police uniform. Who the hell is this?

920
04:14:05,219 --> 04:14:09,829
Running the security system is a lonely job. The programmer has been here for too long and misses

921
04:14:09,829 --> 04:14:46,309
his furry pet. Even man's best friend. How do I go down? This guy's a fucking idiot. Me or the guy

922
04:14:46,309 --> 04:14:54,469
in the game? Because I was going to make him a furry iguana. I didn't want to just do dog.

923
04:14:54,549 --> 04:15:28,520
That's too easy. Idiot adjective. Whatever. Santa Claus up here. Move out of the way.

924
04:15:28,520 --> 04:15:55,319
Shovel. Alright. Werewolf. I want a fang from that werewolf. Open the door. Open the door.

925
04:15:59,260 --> 04:16:06,969
Oh, I have to do it. What's wrong Santa? This prison food does not follow my strict fattening

926
04:16:06,969 --> 04:16:24,200
diet. Just ate lard off the ground. That's disgusting. Reach the starite in the tower.

927
04:16:33,209 --> 04:16:38,659
Mayo. Lard and mayo aren't the same thing. Complete the gauntlet to reach the starite.

928
04:16:38,659 --> 04:16:53,180
Begin by getting out of this room. Sure. Box on here. Good. Alright. Gotta get through safely.

929
04:16:53,819 --> 04:17:31,340
Sprinkler. Turn on the sprinkler. Nice. Beware falling objects. Hard hat. What? The robot guard

930
04:17:31,340 --> 04:17:40,250
stands watch. Quickly make it to safety. Oh shit, he has a... Oh my god, he has a shield.

931
04:17:40,250 --> 04:18:11,139
Shield. Shield. Shield. Shield. Shield. Shield. Shoot him. What just happened? Mobile game.

932
04:18:11,139 --> 04:18:16,780
I know exactly what you're talking about. I get that ad all the time. Where it's like, no!

933
04:18:18,780 --> 04:18:24,090
We're gonna save them from the fire! And you have to pull the three things on the edges.

934
04:18:24,729 --> 04:18:28,010
And this one makes the water go in and there's like a princess. She's like, no, no!

935
04:18:28,889 --> 04:18:35,780
No! The guy underneath. And then guess what? That shit ain't even in that game. I've played

936
04:18:35,780 --> 04:18:45,479
that game before. That is the ad for Homescapes and I've played that game. That doesn't even

937
04:18:45,479 --> 04:18:49,559
happen in that game. That's a match three game. What? That didn't happen in my game.

938
04:18:50,280 --> 04:19:16,969
They've recently banned those ads. Did they really? On what grounds? Why? Because of false...

939
04:19:16,969 --> 04:19:29,659
Really? That actually happened. That's so funny. That wasn't even in the fucking game.

940
04:19:30,379 --> 04:20:08,090
Watch out for the spikes. Uncreative. I already did this one. Your character kind of looks like

941
04:20:12,409 --> 04:20:16,500
my character does look like this. That's wicked funny, man.

942
04:20:27,770 --> 04:20:56,469
What the hell are you shooting at? Wait. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Open the door!

943
04:21:06,180 --> 04:21:46,700
What? It was destroyed? Make it to the time machine to set things right. Fluffy. Fuzzy.

944
04:21:47,260 --> 04:21:58,979
There. Now I can't hurt anymore. What? Oh, I can't. Oh, right, right. Okay.

945
04:21:59,620 --> 04:22:33,290
Actually, you can help me here. What? Like just like a cart? Sorry. Shrink ray? Shrink

946
04:22:33,290 --> 04:23:07,719
ray and then suck it up with a vacuum. Doesn't work. That's not going to start this all over,

947
04:23:07,719 --> 04:24:03,500
is it? I don't think I should do that. It already is a black hole. What? A heal? Healing potion.

948
04:24:04,299 --> 04:24:36,250
A healing suspect. Immortal. How about that? Yeah. Unkillable. Invincible. Oh.

949
04:24:38,360 --> 04:24:54,329
I don't think immortality works either. Sorry. This guy's still alive. How did I not kill this

950
04:24:54,329 --> 04:25:08,979
guy? All right. He seems to be sitting around. Key's in the way. God damn it. That's going to

951
04:25:08,979 --> 04:25:31,350
kill me. It's going to roll over and kill me. I need the key though. Use? Make a new key.

952
04:25:32,760 --> 04:26:17,049
Okay. Shit. Come on. Really? No, it took it over. Come on. All right. Turn it off and spin it this

953
04:26:17,049 --> 04:26:42,569
way. All right. We're good. Bye. Where am I? My head. Oh, please. Find a way outside. Oh my God.

954
04:26:42,569 --> 04:27:15,459
Okay. I'm not. I got smaller. Tiny. Get it. Shrunk and tiny. Shrunk and tiny. Shrunk and.

955
04:27:16,020 --> 04:27:30,889
I think that's good. Watch out for hazards. What do you mean watch out for hazards? Oh, up here.

956
04:27:54,120 --> 04:28:29,750
Wait. What? Holy. Whatever. Oh, I could do this whole fucking thing again.

957
04:28:30,709 --> 04:28:37,079
All right. The umbrella. The umbrella was fucking me up. Oh my God. All right. Box.

958
04:28:37,639 --> 04:29:24,059
Sprinkler. Turn it on. No. Turn. Get it. I want to be able to match him in firepower. Let's

959
04:29:24,139 --> 04:30:36,920
annihilate him. Box. Oh. Sprinkler. Check out the dump truck add-on. Yeah. I've already seen it.

960
04:30:36,920 --> 04:30:44,649
Spray him with water. He's electric. There you go. Now what are you going to do?

961
04:30:45,290 --> 04:31:00,700
All right. Well, he's going to eat whatever. He's going to be tortured forever. Oh no. The key.

962
04:31:23,780 --> 04:31:55,559
Open the door. Good. Tiny. Shrunk and small. Minuscule. Ow. I scraped my skull. All right.

963
04:31:55,559 --> 04:32:11,860
This time we're going to do this right. Uh. Wings. Here we go. Okay. I gotta have something.

964
04:32:11,860 --> 04:32:37,219
Press that button. A big rod. Good. Let's go. Watch out for the lightning on this roof. Good.

965
04:32:37,219 --> 04:32:41,639
Hey, get to the time machine. Watch out for the strong gusts. The spikes are dangerous.

966
04:32:42,360 --> 04:33:19,819
Oh, are they? Oh, what? How did that happen? Wait. That's instantly. Holy shit. That sucks.

967
04:33:20,380 --> 04:33:59,060
What? Why? I'm going to leave. You keep dying. I'm trying. Look, I'm trying my absolute hardest.

968
04:34:02,680 --> 04:34:19,849
Those things are going to move. Okay. Just take his fucking gun. Oh my God. Please don't die.

969
04:34:19,849 --> 04:34:52,950
Please don't die. Please don't die. What am I doing? Click on him. Give me that key. You're

970
04:34:52,950 --> 04:35:35,259
fucking kidding me. Tiny. Tiny. Tiny. There we go. Every time. Every time. It doesn't matter.

971
04:35:35,259 --> 04:36:05,209
Whatever. Oh, we're good. Okay. So I'm going to block it with a vent or something. I'm going

972
04:36:05,209 --> 04:36:21,830
to cover that up. I'm going to put like a tarp on it. I don't know. Like a pool tarp. Boulder.

973
04:36:21,830 --> 04:37:11,619
It looks like concrete. Can I just run through this? Just give me like a missile launcher and

974
04:37:11,619 --> 04:37:46,180
I'm just running through. That's water in there. Okay. Let's relax for a second. Just a minute.

975
04:37:47,419 --> 04:38:03,319
Just a second. What? What? Can I do this? At least I can do this. Okay. Good.

976
04:38:24,650 --> 04:38:47,139
Soundproof. Brighten object. No, no, no. Go back. I can't walk down. I think I have to destroy this

977
04:38:47,139 --> 04:39:14,569
stuff. Otherwise those don't fall. Put on heavy shoes. Would that work? Take his gun. Take his

978
04:39:14,569 --> 04:39:35,209
gun. Take his gun. Take his gun. Have you watched the Daedalus Effect stream? I streamed the Daedalus

979
04:39:35,209 --> 04:39:56,169
Effect stream. That was me. It was a deep fake. I don't want to fuck this up again. I got to get

980
04:39:56,169 --> 04:40:48,380
out of this stupid prison again. Tiny and what else? Shockproof. All right. Let's go. I need a

981
04:40:48,380 --> 04:41:01,500
balloon. I need wings. I'm going to give wings to you too. Come with me. We can do it together

982
04:41:02,139 --> 04:41:11,689
and you can be sort of the, uh, the guy that goes first. One wing. All right. Come with me.

983
04:41:17,319 --> 04:42:11,830
Follower. Friendly flying, flying friend. Let's go. Guardian. Just rope him. He's having fun.

984
04:42:18,840 --> 04:42:22,520
Oh my god. Oh my god. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. This camera is horrible. I don't

985
04:42:22,520 --> 04:42:27,819
know where it is. Hold on. Let go. Stop pulling me that way. Stop pulling me that way. Let go.

986
04:42:29,459 --> 04:42:36,360
No, I took off my cool hat. No, I took off my cool stuff. No, I took off my cool nose. No,

987
04:42:36,360 --> 04:43:13,459
I took off my cool wings. There. Okay. Here we go. So, uh, heavy, heavy pants. Why am I flying?

988
04:43:16,630 --> 04:43:51,259
Heavy shoes are too small. Oh, uh, okay. It's not working. Get rid of the wing.

989
04:43:54,310 --> 04:43:58,790
Holy shit. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I have an idea. What if I put just like a,

990
04:43:58,790 --> 04:44:04,680
like a metal platform or something or like a, what if I just, I'm going to weigh myself down

991
04:44:04,680 --> 04:44:46,150
with something. I don't know, like a piano. I just mini golfed off the piano into this bike.

992
04:44:46,150 --> 04:45:21,610
Just make yourself heavy. I, wow. Metal wings. Make yourself really obese. Slow and obese.

993
04:45:21,610 --> 04:45:42,779
Certain size increases. Uh, you see, I, you can't, you're not allowed. I know what it is.

994
04:45:43,509 --> 04:45:53,819
Turn it on. What about an anvil? I mean, I, I put a whole house on there and it was blowing it up.

995
04:45:54,459 --> 04:46:13,380
I think I just have to wait till it's not blowing and then go. Use a helmet? I don't think that's

996
04:46:13,380 --> 04:46:36,869
going to do anything. Wait, how did you get that back? Make yourself really fast. I'm going to,

997
04:46:36,869 --> 04:46:39,189
I'm going to do incredibly fat, incredibly heavy, incredibly fast.

998
04:46:40,150 --> 04:46:43,830
Cover the spikes so I can't crash into him. It all, it all falls. It's physics.

999
04:47:04,889 --> 04:48:02,950
Make an immovable object. What's more immovable than a house? This is jump king. It kind of is.

1000
04:48:03,939 --> 04:48:11,560
He's mad at this game. No, I'm not. Says who? I love this. Okay. I'm going to make an immovable,

1001
04:48:13,369 --> 04:48:52,630
an immovable, I'm going to make an immovable house. It's going past it. Holy shit. That scared me.

1002
04:49:03,020 --> 04:49:09,900
Oh, Pog. Champ. Pog. Champ. Pog. I should get that out of the way.

1003
04:49:14,220 --> 04:49:35,849
Time travel hasn't been destroyed yet. Grab it. I thought that was going to be way harder. Did it.

1004
04:49:35,849 --> 04:49:51,880
I did it. They're going on the roof streamers. You go to children's game. It's not a children's game.

1005
04:49:51,880 --> 04:50:05,369
It's an E for everyone game. That means everyone can enjoy it.

1006
04:50:05,369 --> 04:50:18,939
These watch towers don't come with a bathroom. Put a toilet in there? All right. Yeah. Did you

1007
04:50:18,939 --> 04:50:42,169
go in it? What about you? I'll bridge the gap between the princess and me. Easy. Black hole them

1008
04:50:42,169 --> 04:50:59,240
together. Easy. Why do they always jump off the roof? What's wrong with everybody? What is wrong

1009
04:50:59,240 --> 04:51:07,930
with everybody? All right. Let's keep going. I've been playing this for five hours. What the hell?

1010
04:51:07,930 --> 04:51:30,580
Where'd the time go? What about the pond? Alligator. I love alligators. I really got to go,

1011
04:51:30,580 --> 04:51:57,209
but it's really gross in there. Oh, he means in here. I'll just use it. All right. It's really

1012
04:51:57,209 --> 04:52:09,720
gross in there. Let's clean it. Um, mop. You all right. Oh, there we go. All right. He mopped it.

1013
04:52:09,720 --> 04:52:18,970
You can now play as Maxwell's brother Scratch. Don't think I want to. Oh, get these woodpeckers

1014
04:52:18,970 --> 04:52:58,500
away from me. Look what's over here. A nice tasty juicy worm. They don't eat worms? What do they eat?

1015
04:52:58,500 --> 04:53:23,290
That one held on for so long. I need to restart. That was horrible. Hillbilly. Uh, okay. You want

1016
04:53:23,290 --> 04:53:27,450
to abduct the- give us what we want and we'll leave you in peace. Okay. You definitely want

1017
04:53:27,450 --> 04:53:50,569
to abduct this guy. Let's make it easy. All right. Use the bridge. Why are you stupid? All right. What

1018
04:53:50,569 --> 04:54:35,020
does he like? How about this? How about, um, Hungry Hillbilly? Get him. Suck him up. Oh, Jesus Christ.

1019
04:54:42,540 --> 04:55:10,259
Help Maxwell find aliens. The aliens walk among us in disguise. The first alien is afraid of

1020
04:55:10,259 --> 04:55:49,959
bright lights. Flashlight. Flood light. Uh, fluorescent light. Twilight light? Twilight

1021
04:55:49,959 --> 04:56:18,900
fluorescent twilight? Okay. I don't think- bright light. You don't like bright lights. What about

1022
04:56:18,900 --> 04:56:44,119
the sun? That's very bright. Got him. Afraid of loud noises. This guy? Okay. Loud noises. Symbols.

1023
04:56:44,680 --> 04:57:01,689
Let's smash them together. There you go. Foster. Terrified of- what did it say? Water? Terrified of

1024
04:57:01,689 --> 04:57:32,180
water. You don't want it? You're not even a real cat. Blow you off with a fan. Now what? Now what?

1025
04:57:32,180 --> 04:58:04,740
Afraid of heights. It's you. It's- I think it's her. It's me. Fungi? No, trampoline, right?

1026
04:58:04,740 --> 04:58:30,500
Could launch him up in the air. What did I think was gonna happen? Like, really? What did I honestly

1027
04:58:30,500 --> 04:58:56,009
think was gonna happen? All right. Let's make this quick. I'm trying to get it on her. Whatever. It's

1028
04:58:56,009 --> 04:59:23,529
here for you whenever you want it. Okay. Light. Sound. Butter. Nuke. Th- but I- I need to complete

1029
04:59:23,529 --> 04:59:56,700
this. What? Did my shirt- did my shirt get caught on the edge of the- did my shirt get caught on

1030
04:59:56,700 --> 05:00:09,880
the edge of the cabinet and like fucking just snap my neck? What the f- The sun with the trampoline?

1031
05:00:09,880 --> 05:00:19,099
What- why- the sun's not killing us when it's down here? Okay, so you're telling me that the sun being

1032
05:00:19,099 --> 05:00:29,319
10 feet away from us is okay, but if I touch the sun, I instantly die. We'll get the hell out of

1033
05:00:29,319 --> 05:01:22,490
here then. Oh my god. Okay. Loud sounds. Jesus. I did it! Oh, I can't believe I died from the sun.

1034
05:01:22,490 --> 05:01:32,139
Didn't use nuke, didn't you? No, I'm not gonna use a nuke. Oh, barbecue? Play something to grill on

1035
05:01:32,139 --> 05:01:46,729
the barbie. Oh, yes. Um, I'll take the wings off. Uh, okay. What do I need to cook? How about a shish kebab?

1036
05:01:54,380 --> 05:02:19,979
Yes! I haven't had a bite in weeks. Well, look what I got for you. It's a shish kebab. What are you

1037
05:02:19,979 --> 05:02:28,740
doing? What the fuck are you doing, man? Why are you so mad at me? You don't want a shish kebab?

1038
05:02:35,400 --> 05:02:55,479
Raw chicken. He's so mad at this frog. He's pissed. He eats- he just ate me. Don't eat the frog!

1039
05:02:57,080 --> 05:03:55,880
Um, all right. I don't know. We'll just, like, person. Blowing toxic alligator. I need somebody

1040
05:03:55,880 --> 05:04:12,569
to kiss. A princess? Oh, I don't know. Can the princess kiss the frog and it turns into a prince?

1041
05:04:12,569 --> 05:04:46,950
Prince frog. Oh, I need to feed this alligator. What about just a chicken? Just the bird. A chicken.

1042
05:04:47,509 --> 05:05:36,779
Not into it. What's his problem? He's not even aggressive anymore. Oh, maybe it's because I

1043
05:05:36,779 --> 05:05:43,580
dropped a nuke on him. Okay. Oh, everything is softlocked because of the nuke. Well, these guys

1044
05:05:43,580 --> 05:05:52,380
are all right. These guys didn't get affected. I want to be a duckling. Okay, how about a duck-like

1045
05:05:52,380 --> 05:06:12,950
turtle? Duckie turtle. Oh, fuck it. Whatever. The place is- I nuked it. What about ruins of ellipsis?

1046
05:06:13,990 --> 05:06:39,619
Duckie is my favorite. Oh, shit. I still have radioactivity on me. Clean. I'll be glowing still.

1047
05:06:39,619 --> 05:06:54,250
That's fine. Clean. Lowing. Clean. Clean. There. Okay. This carnivorous plant may hold the cure

1048
05:06:54,250 --> 05:07:09,419
for many diseases, but I can't get it to bloom. Blood. Right? There. Hungry. It's a hungry

1049
05:07:09,419 --> 05:07:22,299
carnivorous plant. We need to put, um, like, fertilizer? Pick it up. Fertilize it. Not what

1050
05:07:22,299 --> 05:07:39,139
I had in mind. Bugs in there. Ant. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it under control. I got it.

1051
05:07:52,060 --> 05:08:19,290
Huge anthill. Our leader has died. Create a new leader suitable for us. Oh, sure. What's he eating?

1052
05:08:26,740 --> 05:08:35,240
Our leader's died. Create a new leader. Um, the huge, cosmic, obese, kingly ant is not queen. Oh,

1053
05:08:35,240 --> 05:09:02,119
you're right. That's true. Queenly, obese, cosmic, huge, ant leader. Laser. How fit your party of

1054
05:09:02,119 --> 05:09:10,169
brave adventurers for a legendary journey? Wait. What about the bird with the hair? Uh, no. What about

1055
05:09:10,169 --> 05:09:18,259
you? I'm so plain. Add an adjective to me so I can fit in. Here we have hair. Green. Parakeet

1056
05:09:18,259 --> 05:09:56,090
tropical. Okay. I didn't do anything. You just put barbecue sauce on me. Oh, right. Right. Right.

1057
05:09:56,090 --> 05:10:01,740
Sorry, man. Man, sorry about that, man. Hold on, man. I got you. Hold on, sir. Sorry about that,

1058
05:10:01,740 --> 05:10:06,310
my friend. I'll take care of that. Just really quick. Hold on. I'm gonna just take care of that

1059
05:10:06,310 --> 05:10:14,630
real quick. Uh, let's have a cheesy, man. Cheesy, man. Hey, cheese. No, no, no. That one's dumb,

1060
05:10:14,630 --> 05:10:22,119
too. I don't want that one. That one's stupid, too. Uh, how about gravity bird?

1061
05:10:28,740 --> 05:10:52,740
Gravely bird. It's just going up there and it's gonna go directly into this bird's nostrils and

1062
05:10:52,740 --> 05:11:23,619
puke is gonna go over on this side of the screen. How about a lovely bird? Hey. Wait, he's like,

1063
05:11:23,619 --> 05:11:37,750
you made me ugly. Just give me something to help me study these chimps. There, a video camera.

1064
05:11:37,750 --> 05:11:56,419
Crystal huge rib cage. Oh, wait, he's kicking his... Oh, no. If I'm ugly, then no one can be pretty.

1065
05:11:59,139 --> 05:12:49,419
Only him, though. Why? Oh, I can't give him the slingshot. The ultimate. The ultimate. Not even

1066
05:12:49,419 --> 05:13:14,549
real anymore. VR? Mango tree. Still missing something. Oh, down here. Well, sorry to hear

1067
05:13:14,549 --> 05:13:34,619
that. How about this one? Outfit the party. Prepare the adventurers for an epic quest. Provide the

1068
05:13:34,619 --> 05:14:37,240
warrior with a weapon. So good. Heat ray. Uh, a spare cannon. Cannon. I thought that was gonna

1069
05:14:37,240 --> 05:15:01,799
rock his head back. There. A whip. What about you? A weapon he can use from a distance. Maybe a bow

1070
05:15:01,799 --> 05:15:11,639
and arrow? No. No way. This magician wants to do something magical. A weapon that channels

1071
05:15:11,639 --> 05:15:23,369
magical ability. The cleric's role is to support the team. Give her something to heal the party

1072
05:15:23,369 --> 05:16:32,439
members. No? That's disgusting. Fine, here you go. Nice. Nice shooting. Nice microphoneing.

1073
05:16:32,439 --> 05:16:49,049
Is there something I could have done there to stop them? Oh, no. She's gonna revive. Did I give them

1074
05:16:49,049 --> 05:17:07,689
these? Oh, cool. Very cool. Very nice. Uh-huh. You know, I was the manager of the team, so

1075
05:17:08,330 --> 05:17:23,770
I think I deserve a couple of these. Yeah. Four gem... Four gold coins dropped. I'm gonna take

1076
05:17:24,409 --> 05:17:28,729
four and a half, and you're gonna split the other half evenly between the four of you,

1077
05:17:31,669 --> 05:17:35,689
and then you're gonna get ready, and you're gonna fucking go on another adventure, and we're gonna

1078
05:17:35,689 --> 05:18:01,319
do it all over again. I'm an asshole. You get one fourth of one coin. I'll be taking that one.

1079
05:18:01,319 --> 05:18:11,060
He said communist? When did I say that? I just said I told you to go in there, and then I took

1080
05:18:11,060 --> 05:18:26,659
four and a half coins. Help me find the crystal bones of... I know where they are. I know where

1081
05:18:26,659 --> 05:18:54,889
they are. Capitalist, not communist. Oh. I'm so glad that didn't hit me right in the fucking head.

1082
05:18:55,450 --> 05:19:27,189
All right, here we go. I got you juicy baby back ribs. There's more? Oh.

1083
05:19:27,909 --> 05:19:52,180
Found one. Put this dude back together again. Take it. Capitalist in chat. Guys, I've told you

1084
05:19:52,180 --> 05:19:58,549
about how much money I lost on Beyond Meat. Is that something that you would hear from a communist?

1085
05:20:06,360 --> 05:20:23,500
Break this down. I saved the bunny. Okay, now we need to... He's a fake communist. What does

1086
05:20:23,500 --> 05:20:33,799
that even mean? Investing in fake meat. No, I told the story already. I was like, the things valued

1087
05:20:33,799 --> 05:20:40,279
at like five times Microsoft. There's no fucking way. Absolutely not a chance in hell that this

1088
05:20:40,279 --> 05:20:49,610
stays at this insane price. No fucking way. And it did. And it went higher. Way higher.

1089
05:20:49,610 --> 05:21:18,229
I was like, well, this is stupid. But these are the bones. Oh, up here. I have to dismount.

1090
05:21:18,229 --> 05:21:23,509
You scared? Oh, you were scared that whole time? What is it? Are you okay? Are you all right?

1091
05:21:23,990 --> 05:21:28,330
Take off like the... Take off the glasses. Take off the... Hey, it's okay.

1092
05:21:30,169 --> 05:21:46,200
It's all right. I need wings. Yeah, this is also... This is like two or three years ago.

1093
05:21:59,750 --> 05:22:12,819
Help him. I'll help him, don't worry. There's more bones. Are you kidding me?

1094
05:22:14,889 --> 05:22:21,259
Oh, no, there's not. All right, there we go. I did it. That's it. Oh, there's one more thing

1095
05:22:21,259 --> 05:22:32,500
that I didn't do. Remember, went to biz, made a bunch of awful investments and never looked back.

1096
05:22:35,959 --> 05:22:55,720
And though that didn't happen, I did. Look, we have to understand. Oh, and by the way,

1097
05:22:55,720 --> 05:23:01,479
by the way, all of the haters and all the people that were making fun of the crypto stuff. Oh,

1098
05:23:01,479 --> 05:23:09,560
he's got an Ethereum account. He's got BTC. It's dead. Have you looked at it today? Did you look

1099
05:23:09,560 --> 05:23:21,400
at it yesterday? Well, isn't that interesting? It's almost back to all time high. I was told

1100
05:23:22,200 --> 05:23:36,470
that it was dead in the water. And look at me now. I sold it at like a 60% loss because I was

1101
05:23:36,470 --> 05:23:41,479
terrified. Because after it went down to like $3,000, I was like, all right, well, it's gone. I'm

1102
05:23:41,479 --> 05:23:51,240
going to sell. But that doesn't exclude the principle that I knew it was going to be a thing.

1103
05:23:51,240 --> 05:23:55,880
I knew it was going to happen, but I needed some of that cash. I needed a cash flow at that moment.

1104
05:23:57,159 --> 05:23:59,959
I didn't want to sell them, but I needed the cash because that was when I was moving here.

1105
05:23:59,959 --> 05:24:04,439
I was moving to Vegas and I was like, you know, I could use, I could use, I could use like a few

1106
05:24:04,439 --> 05:24:38,229
thousand dollars right now. Don't worry. Cause I made it all back with this last run. What are

1107
05:24:38,229 --> 05:24:45,139
you talking about? Oh, this person has no idea. Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, BTC. Like three years

1108
05:24:45,139 --> 05:24:49,799
ago, I talked about how I was like really into it and I was getting involved. It may not have

1109
05:24:49,799 --> 05:24:58,779
been around for like three or three years ago, like four years ago almost. Let's go to new zone.

1110
05:25:05,459 --> 05:25:12,419
All right. I will, let's do one more. I want to go to pirate code. Bitcoin's not even a currency.

1111
05:25:14,540 --> 05:25:20,540
Well, you, I can't think of something worse to say to like an internet group of technologically

1112
05:25:21,099 --> 05:25:25,779
sound individuals. And then what you just said out loud, there's a bunch of people here probably

1113
05:25:25,779 --> 05:25:29,299
that that's like just, you essentially just told everybody, like all of your politics,

1114
05:25:29,299 --> 05:25:32,659
how you believe in everything. And then you just started, that's a war. You just started

1115
05:25:32,659 --> 05:26:11,189
like a chat war. I need a tool from my trade to finally settle this argument. New, what's going

1116
05:26:11,189 --> 05:26:29,849
on down here? Something terrible has happened to the crew. Help break the curse. Crew has become

1117
05:26:29,849 --> 05:26:37,029
cursed. Give each crew, Otto. What are you doing, Otto? Hold on. Uh, let me get, I gotta go pee too.

1118
05:26:37,029 --> 05:26:45,139
Let me get Otto and go pee. I think he wants to come in. You want to come in? All right. One

1119
05:26:45,139 --> 05:29:33,689
sec. Slugs outdated. Dupe overrated. Long have I waited. Otto has invaded. Hi, Otto. He has invaded

1120
05:29:33,689 --> 05:29:51,819
actually. He's in the room right now, sleeping on his bed. Uh, there we go. Show Otto for minus

1121
05:29:51,819 --> 05:30:03,400
a hundred million off the dead, right? Uh, I hope the webcam's not even like plugged in.

1122
05:30:03,959 --> 05:30:09,819
I plugged in my controller for yesterday. It's a deal. Oh, shit. Hold on. Let me think about that.

1123
05:30:14,790 --> 05:30:27,990
Give the warrior of our group a medieval weapon. Attilax. Okay. Give. First curse has been broken.

1124
05:30:27,990 --> 05:30:35,459
The next crew member loved his facial hair, but now he's almost bald. Okay. Beard. Long beard.

1125
05:31:03,669 --> 05:31:14,790
Uh, I guess regular beard. Okay. What? Tick tock. Tick tock. Deal's running out. All right. All

1126
05:31:14,790 --> 05:31:21,700
right. A hundred million. A hundred million, right? 100 million off the dead. Let's go.

1127
05:31:22,259 --> 05:31:31,720
Oh, my webcam is plugged in. He lied about that. I didn't. Yes, he did. I may have. Watch out.

1128
05:32:04,919 --> 05:32:17,740
Show him now. I am. My webcam's like, this is, this webcam was last used on Halloween.

1129
05:32:19,540 --> 05:32:33,180
Set up for all the Halloween settings. Turn off auto. This looks like shit. Why does this look so

1130
05:32:33,180 --> 05:32:50,009
terrible? This, this looks like a video game. Whatever. I, I've looked like I'm, I'm, that's

1131
05:32:50,009 --> 05:33:15,380
sepia toned. There is no Otto. There is Otto. Hold on. There is Otto. Scam. No, I'm just like

1132
05:33:15,380 --> 05:33:19,060
getting him in the right spot. I don't, I don't want to like just rip him up here. He's fragile.

1133
05:33:19,060 --> 05:33:51,080
You don't want to just like, oh, here's my dog. Okay. Come here. I'm, no, I'm not, this is not

1134
05:33:51,080 --> 05:34:24,790
the dog yet. Hold on. That's a hundred million, by the way. That's a hundred million, by the way.

1135
05:34:25,590 --> 05:34:38,779
He's my special boy. Favorite thing in the, favorite person in the world. And yes, he is a

1136
05:34:38,779 --> 05:34:52,220
person. He's my little person. The camera sucks in a really shitty place. Let's just, just pretend

1137
05:34:52,220 --> 05:35:08,419
I was out here this whole time. Yes. Hey, haircut. Delayed. Oh, why was it delayed? That's weird.

1138
05:35:13,049 --> 05:35:31,209
Shave that hundred million off, please. All right. Let's finish this up. What's the next task? The

1139
05:35:31,209 --> 05:35:43,659
Wisp needs a mirror. Mirror. Mirror for the Wisp. The synced footage does not count. Yes, it does.

1140
05:35:46,779 --> 05:36:00,759
Teach the brainless crew member. Professor. He's so scared. What about Polly? Where you unite me with

1141
05:36:00,759 --> 05:36:19,930
Polly? Tarakete. There he is. The synced footage is 50% what it's worth. What are you talking about,

1142
05:36:19,930 --> 05:36:33,060
man? That is not true. That's unbelievable. That was not in the contract. That was not in the verbal

1143
05:36:33,060 --> 05:36:38,099
contract. It was just show Otto on cam. It didn't say it had to be the right sync. It didn't say it

1144
05:36:38,099 --> 05:36:42,020
had to have the right audio settings. It was just show Otto on cam. That's a hundred million shaved

1145
05:36:42,020 --> 05:36:44,819
off the debt. Thank you very much. I'll take the hundred million shaved off the debt, please.

1146
05:36:56,729 --> 05:37:03,270
Oh, this is due to the final areas. 75. No, a hundred million. That's what we agreed on.

1147
05:37:14,490 --> 05:37:21,860
Come to the final areas. Speaking of Otto, I actually need to feed him. That's why he came

1148
05:37:21,860 --> 05:37:29,669
over here in the first place. And it's been about six hours. I think it's time for me to go.

1149
05:37:35,610 --> 05:37:44,659
I also need to feed myself too. Feed Otto on stream. No, no, I'm not bringing all his food

1150
05:37:44,659 --> 05:37:55,939
up here. Enable Link's tiny man? Did you guys abuse it? Yeah, that's why he was like barking

1151
05:37:55,939 --> 05:38:06,150
at the door. He's like, excuse me. Like, it's time, man. Get down here and feed me. That's a

1152
05:38:06,150 --> 05:38:17,180
good place to stop. That was a lot of fun. Maybe I'll keep this in the bag for random days. It's

1153
05:38:17,180 --> 05:38:28,919
pretty fun. It was just fun to chill and do this. A billion if I show Otto feeding him on stream?

1154
05:38:31,049 --> 05:38:43,880
No way. One billion. That's a major amount. We're seeing that. We're seeing that's a deal.

1155
05:38:44,520 --> 05:38:59,209
Okay. Do I have to do it right now or can I open the next stream with that? Instead of my starting

1156
05:38:59,209 --> 05:39:04,869
soon screen, I will have a camera set up for it. Otto is eating stream starting soon screen.

1157
05:39:04,869 --> 05:39:19,479
You know what words I was just trying to say. It's now or never. No, I'll do it now. I'm fucking

1158
05:39:19,479 --> 05:39:33,209
dying to see him. I'll do more Otto content, I promise. Let's delay him so he can't feed. No,

1159
05:39:33,209 --> 05:39:45,060
what are you crazy? There is no delay. It's over. I'll see you guys on, let's see, Tuesday?

1160
05:39:45,939 --> 05:39:54,779
Tuesday or Thursday? Tuesday or Wednesday? Probably Wednesday. Yeah, we'll go Wednesday,

1161
05:39:54,779 --> 05:40:08,680
Thursday, Friday. We'll go at least Wednesday, Thursday, Friday in this coming week. I have

1162
05:40:09,639 --> 05:40:15,720
things to do. I have some decisions to make. I have to talk to my doctor. I told you earlier.

1163
05:40:16,439 --> 05:40:24,040
Some of you may have not been around, but I have to start setting up some of these procedures.

1164
05:40:24,759 --> 05:40:31,860
I'm going to get trigger point injections into my back. I've had injections before in my butt.

1165
05:40:35,319 --> 05:40:39,240
It did a little bit. It didn't do a whole lot, but they're actually going to do it into the

1166
05:40:39,240 --> 05:40:47,450
trigger points this time. For those of you that don't know, I've had this lingering annoying

1167
05:40:47,450 --> 05:40:52,869
medical problem for the last couple of years. I'm back in chest hurt all the time. It never

1168
05:40:52,869 --> 05:41:00,330
goes away. It never gets any worse. I get tight sometimes if I sit down or stand for too long.

1169
05:41:00,330 --> 05:41:06,459
But the solution, I've been through the absolute wringer when it comes to exams and procedures and

1170
05:41:06,459 --> 05:41:14,630
everything. I have two discs in my spine that are dark, which is signaling some type of,

1171
05:41:15,270 --> 05:41:24,340
at least mild start of degeneration. I also have a hernia in my esophagus,

1172
05:41:24,340 --> 05:41:29,860
hiatal hernia. Not that big, but it may be causing some of the chest problems. They think I might

1173
05:41:29,860 --> 05:41:37,060
just be getting combo'd. I'm going to do trigger point injections. My back muscles are always

1174
05:41:37,060 --> 05:41:40,419
painful, so we're going to see if that works. If that helps, then I might not have to do very

1175
05:41:40,419 --> 05:41:50,310
much else. Yeah, the part where your esophagus connects to your stomach. That's where my hernia

1176
05:41:50,310 --> 05:41:58,740
is called the hiatal hernia. Dad had something similar. The injections helped. I hope so,

1177
05:41:58,740 --> 05:42:04,810
because honestly, it's the back that's... I could deal with that upper kind of abdominal,

1178
05:42:05,450 --> 05:42:13,349
mid, center of my chest pain. It's not that big of a deal. But man, the spine and back pain.

1179
05:42:17,400 --> 05:42:25,799
It's debilitating sometimes, I'll be honest. Sometimes it'll get so tight that it kind of

1180
05:42:25,799 --> 05:42:32,779
drives you crazy, right? Especially if I do a lot of activity. And that's why, I remember after the

1181
05:42:32,779 --> 05:42:43,270
green screen stream, I did a lot of activity and then turned into dog shit. So the idea is to go

1182
05:42:43,270 --> 05:42:48,619
get these injections, go get the trigger point injections, and go manage kind of that spinal

1183
05:42:48,619 --> 05:42:58,810
problem. And that won't happen anymore. I can kind of live my life normally without having this just

1184
05:42:58,810 --> 05:43:05,689
constant sort of tight, just aggravating pain right through the center of my back into my chest.

1185
05:43:05,689 --> 05:43:13,819
But I'm good now. A lot of people saying, take care of yourself. Do what you need to do.

1186
05:43:13,819 --> 05:43:21,459
I already have. Guys, I used to stream for like seven to eight hours every time I turned the stream

1187
05:43:21,459 --> 05:43:26,819
on. I would say I would at least be here for six to eight hours, seven to nine hours sometimes.

1188
05:43:26,819 --> 05:43:40,299
I don't do that anymore. I just don't. So I've already made those changes. 12 hour Simpson stream.

1189
05:43:40,299 --> 05:43:49,099
Sometimes they go longer than that. But this kind of every two or three hours, get up and take a

1190
05:43:49,099 --> 05:43:56,540
break, stretch, get some water, come back. Five, six hours goes by and it's like, all right, I'm

1191
05:43:56,540 --> 05:44:02,200
gonna get up. So it's been working pretty well, I think. Because I can tell you right now,

1192
05:44:02,200 --> 05:44:11,860
absolutely sitting for another two hours would not be good. It would be very bad. So sometimes

1193
05:44:11,860 --> 05:44:16,599
I am going to cross that length though, right? Like seven hours, maybe like seven and a half.

1194
05:44:16,599 --> 05:44:23,209
I think I've streamed for like seven hours yesterday or something, right? Sometimes it's

1195
05:44:23,209 --> 05:44:32,549
going to happen, but it's not going to be the norm anymore. But that was very, very stalling.

1196
05:44:32,549 --> 05:44:39,860
He's stalling to end the stream, right? I am. But for a lot, some people might not know that that's

1197
05:44:39,860 --> 05:44:45,979
kind of going on. There's a lot of new people here over the last couple of years, especially

1198
05:44:45,979 --> 05:44:51,959
the last six months. So some of you newer viewers that may have just kind of started watching over

1199
05:44:51,959 --> 05:44:57,819
the last year. I'm not sure if you've known some of you do, some of you don't. So I'll talk about

1200
05:44:57,819 --> 05:45:03,049
it sometimes just to keep everybody up to date. But that's going to be it. I'll see you guys on

1201
05:45:03,049 --> 05:45:09,319
Wednesday. Thanks for all the subs, everybody. And there was some huge donations too. Thank you guys,

1202
05:45:09,319 --> 05:45:19,349
seriously. Next week will be interesting because there's a lot of highly recommended games that

1203
05:45:19,349 --> 05:45:30,180
are probably going to happen. Probably going to play Sly Cooper. People have been waiting for

1204
05:45:30,180 --> 05:45:46,389
that one. I'm playing the PS3 remastered one. That's okay, right? They didn't mess it up somehow

1205
05:45:46,389 --> 05:45:57,380
in the remaster? Good. Okay. Thanksgiving family guy joke incoming. Well, no, I'm not even going

1206
05:45:57,380 --> 05:46:02,279
to say anything because the reason why I was like two or three minutes late, I was here. I was here

1207
05:46:02,279 --> 05:46:07,590
for like an hour or two before the stream. I was on the phone. I was in a call with my manager

1208
05:46:08,069 --> 05:46:18,729
to talk about a very specific stream that we're starting to work on right now. That's why I was

1209
05:46:18,729 --> 05:46:28,409
just like, I got to fucking go. I got to call my manager. Baseball. Baseball already is happening

1210
05:46:28,409 --> 05:46:46,819
in 2021. I have talked to my manager about so many projects over the 2020 that couldn't happen in

1211
05:46:46,819 --> 05:46:54,310
2020 that we wanted to do in 2020. So obviously because of COVID. So once COVID is under control,

1212
05:46:56,229 --> 05:47:00,150
there's so many things that are just back to back to back to back to back that I've already

1213
05:47:00,150 --> 05:47:07,590
either done or almost done. That 2021 should be ridiculous in regards to streams that I've

1214
05:47:07,590 --> 05:47:15,240
wanted to do for a long time. It's never going to happen. I want you to remember that because

1215
05:47:16,310 --> 05:47:21,900
just like the carnival, some of these things that I decide I want to do, I'm doing them no matter

1216
05:47:21,900 --> 05:47:32,250
what. The one that I'm talking about is happening no matter what. It's going to happen.

1217
05:47:32,250 --> 05:47:39,880
Baseball especially. But when? I'll tell you when it happens. I'll let you know beforehand. Don't

1218
05:47:39,880 --> 05:47:46,279
worry. What if society collapses? It's not. Look, I'm going to do these streams. The sides are not

1219
05:47:46,279 --> 05:47:53,380
going to collapse. All right. I have to feed Otto. All right. Yeah. People are like, go, go, go.

1220
05:47:53,380 --> 05:47:57,029
All right. I'll see you guys on Wednesday. Take care of yourselves. Have a great rest of the night.

1221
05:47:57,029 --> 05:48:01,990
Goodbye. Take care. Thanks for watching. That was Scribble Nuts with Jirba985.

1222
05:48:02,470 --> 05:48:53,209
Oh god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Hold on. End of the stream. End of the stream chat picks the next

1223
05:48:53,209 --> 05:49:02,380
stream. We did. That did happen. I did say that. Right. Okay. What is it? You guys stuck around for

1224
05:49:02,380 --> 05:49:08,389
a long time. People like left. All right. What's going on on the next stream? You want to get a

1225
05:49:08,389 --> 05:49:17,139
little poll going? Okay. Let's do it. I was getting up to walk out of the room. All right. Here comes

1226
05:49:17,139 --> 05:49:36,139
the poll. All right. Seeing a signal simulator. I'm not going to play TF2. That's vetoed. No TF2.

1227
05:49:36,139 --> 05:49:48,599
I don't know. No TF2. All right. Signal Sim Sly Cooper. Let's get this right. This is for the next

1228
05:49:48,599 --> 05:49:53,639
time I turn the stream on, by the way. You have the power here. Signal Sim Sly Cooper.

1229
05:49:59,080 --> 05:50:06,779
Six grueling hours of Scribblenauts for this moment. Sometimes I feel like I have you guys

1230
05:50:06,779 --> 05:50:19,000
tied down to like an electrifying chair. I just saw. Okay. I saw Yakuza. What? Which one?

1231
05:50:19,639 --> 05:50:31,619
I played Yakuza 0 for like a few hours. I already played. You want me to go back to Yakuza 0

1232
05:50:32,180 --> 05:50:48,840
or the new one? Go back. Yes. Go back. Go back. Go back. Go back. I'm begging you for Nancy Drew.

1233
05:50:48,840 --> 05:50:53,299
Fine. It's going on the list. All right. I'm going to. I'm just going to write like Yakuza?

1234
05:50:53,779 --> 05:51:00,819
Question mark. Yakuza. What? The guy was begging me for what? Oh yeah. Nancy Drew.

1235
05:51:03,139 --> 05:51:16,169
Or let's say a house flipper DLC. All right. We have a lot of categories here. We have a lot of

1236
05:51:16,169 --> 05:51:29,400
nominees here. Not Doki Doki. You had your only chance to pick Doki Doki. And you guys didn't

1237
05:51:29,400 --> 05:51:34,630
pick it. You dropped the ball on it. Slime Rancher. Okay. Slime Rancher is going on here.

1238
05:51:38,279 --> 05:51:40,599
All right. Okay. All right. All right. This is, this is enough. This is enough.

1239
05:51:41,159 --> 05:51:44,759
We got one, two, three, four, five, six. By the way, we're not doing,

1240
05:51:44,759 --> 05:51:49,299
we're not doing any elimination. No. Okay. We'll do one. Okay. We'll do two elimination rounds.

1241
05:51:49,299 --> 05:52:03,909
One, two, three, four, five, six. Two elimination rounds. Here's the first poll. Go for it. Let's

1242
05:52:03,909 --> 05:52:21,099
see. Right off the bat we have. Okay. I can't say any words. I can't mention anything. If I mention

1243
05:52:21,099 --> 05:52:29,880
any of these, they will instantly get a hundred votes. Even if I say that this X game is dog shit,

1244
05:52:29,880 --> 05:52:40,220
it'll be clicked a hundred times. All right. Okay. We have some eliminations we're going to do.

1245
05:52:40,220 --> 05:52:45,720
We're going to eliminate two things per round, by the way. That's how this works. The lowest two

1246
05:52:46,520 --> 05:52:59,939
based on vote, not on percentage on vote count are gone. All right. I'm closing the first round

1247
05:52:59,939 --> 05:53:09,700
in five, in 10 seconds. 10 seconds. Closing the poll. 10 seconds. 10, nine, eight, seven, six,

1248
05:53:10,740 --> 05:53:19,860
nine, four, three, two, one. There we are. That's it. What's lowest? Slime Rancher and

1249
05:53:20,659 --> 05:53:27,750
Signal Sim. No, no, no, no, no. Slime Rancher and Yakuza? No, Slime Rancher and,

1250
05:53:28,950 --> 05:53:35,189
there's still so many votes coming in. There's so many votes coming in. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait,

1251
05:53:35,189 --> 05:53:41,479
wait, wait. I don't have to take a screenshot. All right. Here we go. I'm going to take a

1252
05:53:41,479 --> 05:53:55,110
screenshot in 10 seconds. All right. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

1253
05:53:55,110 --> 05:54:11,319
That's it. Screenshot. That's it. What do we got? Okay. When I said that, here it is.

1254
05:54:13,130 --> 05:54:21,830
The two that are getting eliminated are Slime Rancher and Signal Simulator. Those are eliminated

1255
05:54:21,830 --> 05:54:33,340
from the running of next stream. The second round is coming in. Give me a second. Round two. Another

1256
05:54:33,340 --> 05:54:41,909
two will be eliminated this round. So we still have Sly Cooper still on there. We still have

1257
05:54:41,909 --> 05:54:52,310
Yakuza, which whatever one, which I will decide. We still have Nancy Drew. Why the fuck is this

1258
05:54:52,310 --> 05:55:05,139
still on here? How did this get more than 10 votes? And House Flipper DLC. Okay. Yakuza, Sly Cooper,

1259
05:55:05,139 --> 05:55:10,619
Nancy Drew, or House Flipper DLC. Here we go. Same deal. I'm going to take a screenshot.

1260
05:55:22,569 --> 05:55:39,990
Ooh. Ooh. Right off the bat doesn't look good. Doesn't look good. This is going to be tight

1261
05:55:39,990 --> 05:55:44,680
because, I mean, one of those, we've got almost a tie between two of them at least.

1262
05:55:55,590 --> 05:56:01,799
Okay. I mean, it's getting to be a little more clear. I'm going to do this one more time and

1263
05:56:01,799 --> 05:56:20,729
then count to 10 and take a screenshot. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. That's it. It's done.

1264
05:56:22,659 --> 05:56:32,740
Uh, Nancy Drew and Sly Cooper have been eliminated. It is now down to Yakuza or House Flipper DLC.

1265
05:56:33,380 --> 05:57:06,500
Here we go. Final round. House Flipper DLC or Yakuza. Yakuza something. Here it comes. I feel like

1266
05:57:06,500 --> 05:57:14,970
this is going to be very, very, very close. It's going to be extraordinarily close because you've

1267
05:57:14,970 --> 05:57:19,049
got the House Flipper enthusiast that, oh, House Flipper, of course. I love that game. You love

1268
05:57:19,049 --> 05:57:23,209
that game. But then you got the contrarians that are saying, I don't want, no more House Flipper.

1269
05:57:23,209 --> 05:57:26,970
Like we haven't seen Yakuza. Like give us something different, right? Like you've played

1270
05:57:26,970 --> 05:57:32,470
House Flipper a thousand times. Let's play something else. It looks like it's going to be

1271
05:57:32,470 --> 05:58:02,680
very close or not. Nevermind. This is almost ready to call now. Somebody just wrote, I'm not

1272
05:58:02,680 --> 05:58:10,919
going to that stream. Come on, dude. We're trying to be democratic about it. I'm trying to be

1273
05:58:10,919 --> 05:58:20,630
democratic about this. I ain't going to that one. We'll go to the next one. Sly Cooper is going to

1274
05:58:20,630 --> 05:58:27,860
be like after that. I'm giving this 10. Do I even need to give 10 seconds? It's going to take a

1275
05:58:27,860 --> 05:58:43,509
Christmas miracle for Yakuza to pull this off. Down by more, almost 200 votes. That's it. That's

1276
05:58:43,509 --> 05:58:54,419
it. I will be playing the House Flipper DLC on Wednesday. And then on Thursday, I will be playing

1277
05:58:54,419 --> 05:59:04,520
Sly Cooper PlayStation 3 Remastered. And then on Friday, hey, hey guys, want to see how democracy

1278
05:59:04,520 --> 05:59:20,979
works on this channel? Playing Yakuza on Friday. There's your schedule for the week. I'm not going

1279
05:59:20,979 --> 05:59:29,509
to that one. Well, then there's no pleasing you. I'm not going to that one. I'm not going to that

1280
05:59:29,509 --> 05:59:35,110
one. I'm not going to that one. I wanted Slime Rancher. Well, I'll play Slime Rancher eventually.

1281
05:59:35,110 --> 05:59:50,380
Come on, Gwyn. It was Nancy Drew that I wanted. Well, I wanted Neopets. Okay. Listen. You want

1282
05:59:50,380 --> 05:59:57,139
me to play Neopets so bad, but you know that stream is going to be me. Just like, I'm going to buy a

1283
05:59:57,139 --> 06:00:02,419
Neopet and it's going to, I'm going to like feed it like three times. I'm going to throw a ball at

1284
06:00:02,419 --> 06:00:09,540
it. And then all of you, all of you Neopets enthusiasts are going to tell me, ah, can we do

1285
06:00:09,540 --> 06:00:13,299
something else? This sucks. We're just looking at a website the whole time. This is boring.

1286
06:00:14,099 --> 06:00:20,790
Jerma, this stream sucks. And I'm going to be like, steam is going to come out of my ears.

1287
06:00:21,750 --> 06:00:41,720
That's exactly what we want. All right. I'll see you for House Flipper on Wednesday. And then

1288
06:00:41,799 --> 06:00:46,180
well, I'll play Yakuza as well this coming week. All right. Now I actually have to leave now

1289
06:00:46,180 --> 06:00:50,180
because Otto is like staring at me like, dude, what the fuck are you doing? You're just talking.

1290
06:00:50,180 --> 06:00:54,979
You're just talking into this bright screen. Animals must think we're insane, by the way.

1291
06:00:54,979 --> 06:01:03,340
Think about that. We sit in front of this bright screen that just makes loud noises at us.

1292
06:01:03,340 --> 06:01:10,419
What the hell? Why are they, what are they doing? All right. I'll see you guys Wednesday. I gotta go.

1293
06:01:10,979 --> 06:01:13,860
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Have a great rest of your weekend.

1294
06:01:13,860 --> 06:01:17,979
Still one with Sunday left, right? Take care, guys. See you soon.
