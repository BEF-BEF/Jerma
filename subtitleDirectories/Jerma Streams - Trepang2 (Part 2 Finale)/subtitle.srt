1
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:17,299
Hello there. How's it going? How you been? I can finally finish laundry now. Ooh laundry day.

2
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:26,310
All right. Sunflower reveal. Oh yeah. Not right now. I'm gonna have to make you wait for it.

3
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:35,909
You're gonna have to wait around for it. That's we're doing that at the end of the stream.

4
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:46,900
I keep my engagements up the whole day. Now good to see you. I go over the plan this week.

5
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:54,180
We'll talk about it. Are you gonna play Pikmin 4? Since you loved 2 so much. Um,

6
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:07,239
I don't know. I'd like to play Pikmin 4 but I don't know. Maybe not on stream. I don't. Everyone

7
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:14,060
thinks I hate Pikmin in the whole franchise. I don't. You're referring to complaints I had

8
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:23,560
about the Wiimote and how I was annoyed at the Wiimote controls. That's what that was. I really

9
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,090
enjoy Pikmin. I think it's a great franchise. I think it's an amazing group of video games.

10
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:38,379
I just had an issue with the way the Wiimote was. Okay. He hates Pikmin. Yeah whatever. All

11
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:43,860
right so here's the plan. Today I'm gonna finish Trippang 2. Just gonna play it and hang out.

12
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:53,750
I'm at the last mission but there are at least three or four side missions. I'd like to do at

13
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:01,139
least a few of them. There's also wacky cheat codes that I would like to do. So we're not

14
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:10,759
quite done with Trippang yet. This Sunday, the plan this Sunday is, well I actually forgot to

15
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:17,479
tell you too, and we're gonna go over the sunflowers. It's not just sunflowers by the way. We went ham

16
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:27,000
this year. We got marigolds. We got wildflowers. We got sunflowers. There's a whole fucking ecosystem

17
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:40,919
over here. You raised pigs. All right so yeah we'll do that. I'm very proud of what we've done.

18
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,449
They look wonderful. You said you're gonna play viewfinder when it comes out. It's out right now.

19
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:56,099
I'm gonna give you the what's what's happening on Sunday. Let me talk. On Sunday

20
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:08,219
I'm gonna play Team Fortress 2. Gonna play TF2 on Sunday. I'm gonna just kind of see. I'm gonna gauge

21
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:14,740
kind of how I like it. I'm interested in checking it out. I did mention a month or two ago at least

22
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:23,060
that I've had the itch to play like man versus machine TF2. So why not? Why not do it on Sunday?

23
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,370
We're gonna play it for like an hour or two, get back into the swing of things,

24
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:36,839
see if I like it, and maybe I'll keep playing it. After that we're gonna play viewfinder. So we'll

25
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:44,040
give it a little we'll give it a little try this Sunday. Not on Sunday. That's the day I'm watching

26
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:53,579
Barbie. Oh sorry. That's the plan. That's gonna be the worst stream of the year.

27
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:20,420
Why? I don't think you like TF2 then. Of the whole year? Why? What the heck? Is

28
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:33,560
Gunu gonna make another debut? No. Gunu is in one game. You should ban him. Hey I'm that's just you

29
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,620
that's an opinion of the stream. That's an opinion of the stream. I cannot change that opinion.

30
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:51,430
I can just scream at you. Okay anyways you guys ready? Last mission. I don't think I'm

31
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,509
gonna do the last mission yet. I think it's probably a good idea too because I haven't

32
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:01,209
played in like a week or two. I think it's a good idea. Is this good? Let's see if it's too loud.

33
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:14,899
Is it too loud? Can we check? How is that? Is that bad? That's all right. Shotgun's a little louder.

34
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:20,819
Seems all right. All right let me remember the buttons. I got that's the slide. That's grenade.

35
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:32,170
That's obviously that. H is to do well. I got Q is I believe slow down time and F is cloak. Okay I'm

36
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:44,300
good. We want to hear your loudest scream. I don't think I can't scream loud. Anytime I scream try to

37
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:52,939
scream loud or anything if I ever try to it just kind of goes oh it just kind of turns into like

38
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:58,939
an air horn that you press too hard like or like a you know what I mean like my voice just breaks

39
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:11,829
when I try to yell. You turn into a toy chicken. Yeah that's what I mean. All right so I'm not

40
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:18,019
going to do the final mission. I have been told that prep hang two has some really really good

41
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:23,740
side content side missions. We're going to take a look. We haven't done any of them. We've done

42
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:39,430
none of them. So what is left for us to do? Wait didn't I do this? Didn't I do site 83? Did it not

43
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:53,509
save? Is one of these new? Yeah it did. Green is the side missions. Yeah but is this shouldn't there

44
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:57,430
be shouldn't this one be open? Oh wait no that's also a side mission. All right so where's the

45
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:06,139
campaign mission? Where's the next camp? This one here then. Okay that's the one that's blinking.

46
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:14,439
All right let's do let's do crash site. Destroy the crashed plane's cargo or unidentified structure

47
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:18,660
in the United States. Which one of these is good? People said there's a couple of really good ones.

48
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:32,580
This one here unidentified structure. Oh yeah let's go. Satellites tracked three armed individuals

49
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:38,919
running in separate directions from the structure this morning at 3 30 a.m. I know how to read it.

50
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,409
Identified as Horizon from their uniforms. By 8 20 a.m. all three had expired from exhaustion

51
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:51,529
or exposure to the elements. Investigate the structure. Satellite scans initially detected

52
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,330
four or five. All right so we just go investigate the structure. I got it. We're doing it on hard.

53
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:15,340
We plan on hard. I'm good to go. Don't call the sus guy at 3 30 a.m. You can read a clock pog.

54
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:24,019
It gets a little weird once you go over. Okay once you once you go over I think 1800 hours.

55
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:35,399
My brain has trouble because okay oh 600 hours. That's 6 a.m. 1200 that's noon. Okay 1300 is one.

56
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:42,200
1400 is two. 15 is all right 1500 is three. 1600 hours is four. You know what I mean? It's

57
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,399
already I'm already I got it already fucked up already. I already I already have it fucked up

58
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:51,450
already is literally just everything minus 12. Yeah but I don't want to do any math. I don't

59
00:09:51,450 --> 00:10:00,019
want to do math. I am an a.m. p.m. Andy because like I just I don't know. It's just easier for

60
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:12,519
my brain to understand. American. I'm an a.m. p.m. Andy. I am. Are you scared that the sus guy

61
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:19,139
in quotes is going to be uttered at your funeral? No no I don't I don't think so. I don't think

62
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:23,620
that's happening. I think it's going to be more about like hey like let's that no one's going to

63
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:36,299
talk about the sus guy at my funeral. I'm not even going to give that one a response. Okay what

64
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:43,799
guns do I want to take? I actually like these two. I like shotgun and I like um but should I

65
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:56,539
take the sniper? Give me armor. Give me flash bangs. Bolt launcher was pretty sick especially

66
00:10:56,539 --> 00:11:07,539
when you do this. All right I'm going to take this and then also this. I like the smg. I'm going to

67
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:21,379
do dual smgs. I take this with me right? I think so. Are you going to add derma dumpy butt naked

68
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:28,419
emote? Uh I thought about it but no. I'm just thinking like what how much um what it would do

69
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:39,940
for me. All right let's go. All right let's turn the audio up for me. Test one more time.

70
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:57,190
Jump button works. All right let's go. Why do you read the worst chat messages? Sometimes what you

71
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,370
think is the worst chat message to me is something that I think is funny to read out loud. So I mean

72
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,690
there's that. But there's also here's the problem. You also don't want to make it. You don't want to

73
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,690
make it a thing where it's like oh I'm going to read I'm going to read like the wacky comment

74
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:18,250
out loud because then you start getting copycats. Oh I he's got to read my message. I'm going to say

75
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:24,490
something fucking crazy. That's why I can't tell you the secret sauce because then you know you

76
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:36,570
got to have it naturally. All right so the goal is there's people in this building or they ran away

77
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:42,679
from this building. Is there something in here? Is there like a monster? Let's find out. That scared the

78
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:50,549
fuck out of me. I forgot how loud that was. You could even see my mouse move. Did it move? Did I

79
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:56,889
go like okay whatever. Turn that down. Okay I'm gonna I actually am because that was pretty bad.

80
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:11,509
This should be all right. What's this? To patrol team when you're back meet us at the vault entrance.

81
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:15,830
We haven't heard from the eggheads in two days. The vault is locked. We're gonna breach it and

82
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:36,039
check. Can I break into this? Yeah what's in here? Okay this is kind of this is like a safe room.

83
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:51,720
There's the burp. Oh do I want to take this? I'm happy with these. It's a gamer room.

84
00:13:51,720 --> 00:14:04,149
Or kind of as a gamer room. It's all right. Go down. This is gonna be a monster that's in here

85
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,269
somewhere. This is gonna be the monster going into the fridge and like drinking out of the

86
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:37,379
fucking milk. I'm gonna catch him and it's gonna go. What was that? What the fuck was that?

87
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:45,429
I'm not even scared. All right what does this say? Feeling uncertain about any progress. The others

88
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:52,169
are mostly keeping me in the dark but had a good conversation with Dr Partridge yesterday. He seemed

89
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:57,610
unusually interested in my books especially the ones pertaining to my faith. I lent him an entire

90
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:14,500
bag of books to satiate his curiosity. It will be interesting to chat with him next time. I'm going

91
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:30,330
I'm taking this one out first. I okay I'm very aware of my nose right now and I hate it. You know

92
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:35,830
you know exactly what I'm talking about right? Right now in the game I'm very aware of my nose

93
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:44,679
and it's I'm looking down at it. I can see it. I can see my nose right there. Oh what the hell.

94
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:53,000
More intel. In game? Yeah in game but also that that's kind of what happens in real life. When

95
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:05,620
you become aware of your nose. Just wait it is just right there. I can see it. Big nose gang. I kind

96
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:19,539
of have a big nose. Yeah all right first sign of blood. What's going on here? Okay trial and error.

97
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:25,379
We've just decrypted the data encoded within the DNA of the biomass sample. The biomass exhibits

98
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:34,120
a remarkable ability to alter its own genomic sequence in response to the input data. Okay

99
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,470
limited internet access. The lack of availability training is okay. Mechanism underlying the

100
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:48,629
encryption scheme employed by the biomass is unusual. Okay I don't know why I don't know why

101
00:16:48,629 --> 00:17:00,039
read this right to left down to up. Do you notice that is what I just did? That was kind of weird.

102
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:24,019
I don't know why I did it like that. All right well whatever this looks promising. Oh shit okay

103
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:36,599
is it gonna be like a weird person in here? Oh god what is oh that's the biomass.

104
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:49,529
This is kind of a maze. I'm gonna this something's gonna attack me. All right I gotta be ready.

105
00:17:49,529 --> 00:18:20,250
Something growling like a coffin. System initializing training sequence with data set 41.

106
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:26,309
Unknown economic collapse poverty the end of civilization. Unknown the end is near. System

107
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:31,849
error unexpected output detected running diagnostics. The end is inevitable. Data corruption

108
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:38,059
identified data set 41. Contents replaced with unauthorized data by user A partridge. Unknown

109
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:44,299
apocalypse destruction the end of all things. Emergency such as everything's going absolutely.

110
00:18:45,660 --> 00:19:16,309
This thing's moving. I put a fucking hole in its head. What do I do? Oh my god it's talking. All

111
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:30,809
right this thing over here is blinking. I'm gonna press this button. Shut it down. What the fuck is

112
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:45,339
happening? Did I win? This is gonna be some Slenderman bullshit. Look at there's like five

113
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:59,400
TVs to turn off. Oh my god I'm just gonna run. I think I'm just gonna run over there. This is

114
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:16,549
actually gonna be horrible isn't it? Just go go go go as fast as you can. Oh what's that? Is that a

115
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:33,539
pencil? What's this giant pencil? Why is there a giant goofy novelty pencil? Am I looking for that?

116
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:38,740
It's the spear from the spear gun. Oh okay all right all right all right all right.

117
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:52,359
The thing is huge. Fuck you game. All right I'm just running. Whatever.

118
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:17,529
Something's gonna be right here. Yeah nice spoiler auto save. Oh god I think this

119
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:43,269
goes for a grenade over here. There's one more TV right in the middle. This thing's gonna get up.

120
00:21:44,299 --> 00:22:01,660
Oh okay okay okay okay okay. It's behind me. It's definitely right behind me. It's right behind me.

121
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:16,440
It's right behind me. What's going on? Why is everything so quiet? Why is everything so silent?

122
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:32,089
What's going on? That was scarier because it was so quiet. What do I do? This this no audio. Uh oh

123
00:22:32,089 --> 00:23:15,269
I think I broke it. I don't know what I did. I think I'm dead. Where do I go? Let's go. Wait what

124
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:30,059
did that say? Shit. Okay I think I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I have to turn these off.

125
00:23:30,059 --> 00:24:00,809
That's actually scarier than a loud sound. Just off-putting. All right is this it? There's only

126
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:38,700
one more. What the fuck was that sound? Turn it off. Got it. Do I fight that thing? Ah this sound.

127
00:24:38,700 --> 00:25:29,160
I think I did it. Nothing else to do right? I don't have any ammo left. There's got to be

128
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:43,670
something else I have to do. Jump into it? I don't know. I don't know what to do. Leave now? I thought

129
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:57,079
the door is locked isn't it? Oh shit it's open. I this was locked. I have one bullet. Um oh god

130
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:13,980
they're behind me. Give me my audio back. There's nothing. There's no bullets in this gun either.

131
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:33,299
All right we're good. What the fuck is going on? What? Is this us? Is this us? Is this us? Is this

132
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:49,319
our team? Where are they? All right all right all right. You can't get in here. I got a lock on the

133
00:26:49,319 --> 00:27:16,950
door. What are you doing? Turn it off. What the fuck? How many do you have? What does this do?

134
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:54,809
What? What? You? What the fuck just happened? Uh hey. Oh it's intel. Okay. PhD. Computer science. 62.

135
00:27:54,809 --> 00:28:12,019
PhD. 46. PhD. Okay. Personnel list. All right. I gotta be ready. Okay this thing's dirty. Where's

136
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:40,359
he? Where's he? Where's he? Where the hell's this guy? Oh there he is. I just took out all your men.

137
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:49,589
I'm right here. I'm out here. This is that guy. That guy's a sniper. I'm literally standing still

138
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:59,900
and he can't even hit me. Who actually sucks at this game? Look at this. You can't even hit me.

139
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:35,420
All right. There we go. I'm going up top. This gotta be a sniper. What the fuck is happening?

140
00:29:35,420 --> 00:30:08,859
Okay. Ow. What the fuck? They're at every angle. Single digit accuracy. Dude I'm being flanked at

141
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:30,759
all sides by guys in Omega armor. I'm going back. There's health in here. You can't even see me from

142
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:53,799
there. What is shooting? Well get in here then. Stop just firing. Get in here. What game are we

143
00:30:53,799 --> 00:31:18,329
playing? I'm one person in here. Yeah. Shit. I need a sniper rifle. I can't shoot. They're all

144
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:26,380
surrounding me from every angle with laser pointers. I need a rifle. I have a weapon that

145
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:32,200
is effective at like 15 feet range and then this thing is empty. I gotta. I'm going up top.

146
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:42,890
Hurry. Go, go, go, go, go. Quick. I gotta get up there quick. All right. I want to go up, up, up,

147
00:31:42,890 --> 00:32:06,920
up, up. But being outside is death. I need to go up. Who the fuck is this guy? I don't. This is

148
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:20,119
not even firing bullets, guys. What the? All right. Is there a rifle? There's gotta be a rifle

149
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:28,460
up here. It has to be. There's no way there's not a rifle up here. Is that a? Kind of? No. You.

150
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:44,549
What? Where's the rifle? You're holding a rifle? Ah, there we go. Now it's time for me to fuck up

151
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:56,410
everybody. Watch this. How do you aim? How do you zoom in? How do you, how do you zoom in with the

152
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:22,980
rifle? Anybody know how to zoom in? How do you zoom in? That's it? Oh, is it E? Where is this

153
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:31,740
guy? What's going on over here? What is going on over here? Why would they? I'm confused.

154
00:33:46,150 --> 00:34:01,259
He's mad. No, I, that was really weird. Get this smoke out of my fucking eyes. This guy sucks.

155
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:17,130
I'm fighting an entire team of legendary warriors right now. Okay. Where are you? Where? What the

156
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:39,719
fuck are you doing though? Don't scare me. Dude, are you zonked right now? No, no. It's just this

157
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:59,719
every angle is people and this smoke every, I need a gun. I need a gun. I need a gun.

158
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:48,280
Give me a gun. This dude is so high right now. I, I know I'm not. Yeah. Got him. Anybody else?

159
00:35:48,280 --> 00:36:09,719
What? All right. We're good. Who else? Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Here he comes.

160
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:15,780
Why is he so fast? Why is he so fast? Why is he so fast? What the fuck? There's so many people.

161
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:35,659
What the hell? So many people, dude. I got, oh my God. That guy was useless. I got him.

162
00:36:36,219 --> 00:37:09,659
What was wrong with that guy? All right. We're good. All right. All right. All right. Oh my God.

163
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:54,619
When do I win? That's gotta be it. That's not it. There's more. This guy's got a grenade launcher.

164
00:37:54,619 --> 00:38:29,349
Is that his head? You need to relax. Just a game. It's not just a game. It's an intense experience.

165
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:40,889
Can I have that grenade? Somebody said take the grenade launcher. Can I take it? That was intense.

166
00:38:40,889 --> 00:39:03,130
He's literally on a secret mission. Well, it's a side mission. Did I do it? That was crazy.

167
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:26,820
Defend the fort. There's a gun mod in the house. I did see that. Where, was this thing armed?

168
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:54,099
It didn't go off. He was on top of a shelf. Yeah. That was a fun one. That was a good one.

169
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:57,369
What about the other side missions? Any other good ones?

170
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:29,670
Snipers bastard off the hbt board. Do the oil rig this way. What's going on in here? What the hell

171
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:49,079
was that? Well, actually, what was that? That was weird, wasn't it? Okay. Um, any more unlockables?

172
00:40:49,079 --> 00:41:14,199
We keep the red shoes for sure. And fall rain. Let's just do fall rain. According to reviews,

173
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:21,260
there's more wave shootouts to come in the side missions. That's all right though. Site 32 is

174
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:38,500
caved in. All right. We just did this one. What's another good one for the side content? Oil rig is

175
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:53,690
locked, but it's really good. Okay. Do crash. Crash site is fun. Destroy the crashed plane's cargo.

176
00:41:53,690 --> 00:42:00,170
That sounds cool. I'll do it. Our forces downed a Horizon airplane. It was carrying high tech

177
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:06,230
weapons to be sold to an African warlord. Find the cargo and make sure it's destroyed. Unfortunately,

178
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:12,940
it crashed into a former nuclear testing site in Algeria. The air is heavily irradiated. So watch

179
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:32,599
your Geiger counter. Oh, I didn't even mean to do that, but I did for weapons. I think I want,

180
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:49,860
I need long range and short range. That's been my problem. That's my issue. What is a good long

181
00:42:49,860 --> 00:43:06,539
range? Let me just take the rifle. You don't need long range. Just run faster. I'll, I'll take the

182
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:23,880
rifle. I think this thing's pretty versatile. Do I want to do anything to it? No suppressor. Laser

183
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:33,300
sight, I feel like gives me away too much. All right. All right. Now for the short range. Can

184
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:38,659
you do aim down sights in this game? You can not unless it is, you have a scope on it or some type

185
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:53,860
of aim down sights thing on the weapon. Pistol. Okay. Somebody said, I fucking hate this dinosaur.

186
00:43:53,860 --> 00:44:04,010
Why was this? What's this dinosaur? What's this? Dino dance was a dinosaur. You guys don't like the

187
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:11,579
Dino dance. I figured you guys would like the Dino dance. This is a dancing community. We have

188
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:20,820
six or seven different dancing emotes. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to do shotgun, shotgun

189
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:29,400
rifle. In fact, we're going to go, we're going to double shotgun. Even though I don't like this,

190
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:43,590
I'm going to do it because I'm trying to make the fans happy. Incendiary unfolded. How do I

191
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:59,429
switch to the other weapon? Can I do the other weapon? Oh, that was weird. There we go. All right.

192
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:12,139
Now we're good. This thing is going to be destructive. Full ammo. I've got flash bangs,

193
00:45:12,139 --> 00:45:20,969
armor. Good to go. It has the other attachments on already if you do weld. Ah, okay. That's good to

194
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:27,480
know. It didn't look like it though. I had laser on one of the SMGs and it wasn't on the other one.

195
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:56,650
This is the hardest level in the game. Okay. This is the hardest level in the game. Hey,

196
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:15,400
I'm up for a challenge. Let's go. Somebody talking. What is all this? There is a sniper rifle here.

197
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:20,489
All right. I have an idea. I'm just going to, I'm going to come back and pick this weapon up.

198
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:23,989
Remind me that it's here because I'm definitely going to do some sniping here like this.

199
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:38,389
That was so bad. I have to restart the whole thing. I missed five shots in a row. I have to restart

200
00:46:38,389 --> 00:46:44,150
the entire mission. Honestly, I should verify, I should verify integrity of game cache on steam.

201
00:46:44,150 --> 00:47:07,449
Just, I feel like, I feel like I fucking corrupted the game being that bad. Okay. Let's go. I need

202
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:17,699
to put a suppressor on this. Suppressor. Okay. Here we go. I should be able to do this pretty

203
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:32,650
easily now. Easy. All right. Where else? Where's everybody else? There's a guy over here. Where is

204
00:47:32,650 --> 00:48:11,530
this guy? The guy is just spinning around with his flashlight. What's this guy doing in here? Hey,

205
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,409
you tell me this is the hardest mission in the game. I'm going to listen. Okay. I'm doing this

206
00:48:14,409 --> 00:48:42,460
the way I want to do it. I ain't, I ain't messing around. Ooh, nice. Weapon pot. Homing. Ooh. All

207
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,900
right. I don't think I need this anymore. I'm going to take this because this is pretty short

208
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:57,239
range. So I'm going to stick with this. I also have the double shotguns. I'm being here. I'm

209
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:35,659
going to see if I can. Oh my. What happened? Oh my God. What? Yeah. They did.

210
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:17,110
Oh, I'm the shotgun guy. I don't know how to. Where's my supplies? Wait, what? That's an enemy

211
00:50:17,110 --> 00:51:04,059
right there. That's got to be, that would have to have been terrible. Oh, come on. Bring it on.

212
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:45,050
Oh, they told me it was hard. Like I exploded. Supplies. Um, I'm going with this thing. Is it

213
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:57,079
the same weapon? Is it the same gun? No, it's not. I want this one. This thing's kind of hard to use.

214
00:52:08,949 --> 00:52:17,579
Two times scope. That's for this gun, isn't it? I'll put, all right, we'll do all this. We'll do.

215
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:35,860
Yeah. Yeah. That's fine. Two times scope. Nice. This is another two X scope. All right. Where are

216
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:55,559
they? Where is everybody? Ooh, give me that. There's one person just hiding somewhere. It's

217
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:31,980
still alive. You in the plane? Where even is this guy? Are you still alive? I don't see anybody.

218
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:41,239
Bro, please drink some water. I got, I got it right here. I'm good. I'm hydrating. Don't worry.

219
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:49,909
Nobody know where this guy is. He's down. Oh, you made that up. I'm trying to get to the highest

220
00:53:49,909 --> 00:53:59,110
point. So I get shot at. There is nobody left. Is there, I don't even know which object. Oh, wait.

221
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:06,329
Okay. He's over here. What have you been doing?

222
00:54:18,869 --> 00:54:46,119
Shooting it rocks. What the fuck was that? Get him. Get him. Ooh. Give me that. Look at this. All

223
00:54:46,119 --> 00:55:11,579
right. I'm ready. I didn't know he was going to do that. And it's got on by a bird. Really?

224
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:22,820
I just got bird shit all over me. What the hell? Airstrike means airstrike, dude. I didn't know

225
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:35,940
if they were talking about right here. I guess. So what do I do? Dude. What the hell? That almost

226
00:55:35,940 --> 00:56:02,250
hit me. What the fuck are you talking about? I thought that was a friendly plane because it

227
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:09,699
says supplies. Ready? Watch, watch, watch. Ready? Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Enemy activity firing.

228
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:17,610
Look that. Oh, that's it. I thought. Okay. Usually. Okay. Usually the ones that are indicated

229
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:46,699
with white means that I don't know. Maybe don't come down. I don't want that. No, no, no, no, no,

230
00:56:46,699 --> 00:57:52,409
no, no, no. I want this. Oh, oh, this thing's out of bullets. See ya.

231
00:58:06,199 --> 00:59:31,849
Hmm. Ah, shit. I helped. Where is he? There's only one left. Where is he? Yes.

232
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:46,059
Snipers. You got it. I need a sniper rifle. Oh, god damn it. Oh, god damn it. Hold on.

233
00:59:46,059 --> 01:00:12,070
I need a sniper. Where's my sniper rifle? Where'd it go? I need a good spot. Right here. That guy

234
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:56,039
dead. Right here. Oh, where is he? The hell is he? Where is this guy? Oh, you're

235
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:03,159
right there. I see where you are. What's wrong with my sniper rifle? Why is my sniper

236
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:39,030
rifle a go-kart? Oh, that's why. Get out of here. See? It's a white indicator. The enemy

237
01:01:39,030 --> 01:02:11,179
approaching is yellow. Yellow indicator. Um, good. I'll take the grenades. That doesn't work. I gotta

238
01:02:11,179 --> 01:02:29,190
get over there quick. Come on. Come on. Hurry, hurry. Hurry. What? What is, what are you talking

239
01:02:29,190 --> 01:03:21,800
about? You, I can't destroy the helicopter. I did not know that. It's okay. Oh, any more bullets?

240
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:52,619
No. You think I care? Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me. Why would he do that? Why would you

241
01:03:52,619 --> 01:04:06,150
do that? I didn't, I had no shots in that fucking gun. That was the last enemy too. God damn it.

242
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:17,320
What did you just drop? Uh, I just went like this. I just put my hands down on my chair. Okay. This

243
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:23,019
time I'm not going to blow it. Cause watch, I can't destroy the helicopter. So I'm going to wait.

244
01:04:23,019 --> 01:05:06,329
This whole thing is going to be so much cleaner now. Watch this. Okay. Much. What? I died like

245
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:28,630
instantly. Oh, somebody sniped me. I got sniped. It's all good. Shoot the rockets out of the air.

246
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:51,590
That was pretty cool. Nice. All right. I got to get up high because that would have been great.

247
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:24,550
Get on this. What are you doing? That just messed up everything. All right. Much better. We're good.

248
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:34,250
I'm almost dead. I don't know what just hurt me, but it was a sniper probably.

249
01:06:45,849 --> 01:07:40,500
Okay. I'm fine. Oh shit. Oh shit. I was, oh shit. Oh, he's still alive. Is he? That guy.

250
01:07:41,909 --> 01:08:01,989
I, that, that was pretty good. That's pretty good. I knocked that guy into next week. Nice.

251
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:15,940
Get him. I need a weapon. Just run around and get everything.

252
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:23,939
Primary objective incoming. He's going to land and I'm going to throw a grenade right in his face.

253
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:57,270
There's no more weapons. I can't get anything. Pick up a different gun. Pick it up. Pick the,

254
01:08:57,270 --> 01:09:07,640
I need a gun. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

255
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:26,140
This guy's fucking relentless. I, I don't even know who's firing at me.

256
01:09:26,699 --> 01:10:07,210
He'll run out of bullets eventually. Dude. I can't, dude. There's too many fucking people.

257
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:31,369
There's too many people. Die. Die. Oh my. I got one of those. I got one of those guns. I got one

258
01:10:31,369 --> 01:11:09,460
of those guns. I have one of those crazy guns. Oh, this guy's got so many grenades. Okay. Here

259
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:24,409
we go. Moment of truth. Moment of truth. I think I'm okay. I think I'm okay. Ah, yes. All right.

260
01:11:24,409 --> 01:11:29,670
I'm good. I'm good. There's only like two more people. We're going to be very safe about this.

261
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:47,340
Where are you? You're over here. There you are. One more. Ah, thank God. It's not it. What do you

262
01:11:47,340 --> 01:12:29,720
mean it's not it? Fuck what I just did. Nice. That was crazy. That was a wacky one. All right.

263
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:38,949
We're good. Very good. Very cool. I cannot imagine playing some of these on a harder difficulty.

264
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:49,319
I think hard is my limit. Very hard might actually be doable, but some of the two above very hard

265
01:12:49,319 --> 01:13:08,710
it seems almost impossible. All right. I wonder if I've unlocked any cheats.

266
01:13:28,069 --> 01:13:36,140
Uh, somebody I'm playing on hard. Let me see. Ah, okay. Unlock some squeaky voices. We're

267
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:51,939
turning that on. Uh, no, we're not. Spooky mode. No checkpoints. Well, I want to be able to unlock

268
01:13:51,939 --> 01:13:58,949
stuff on hard. So when I'm done unlocking stuff, we'll turn a bunch of random shit on because if

269
01:13:58,949 --> 01:14:03,750
I turn one of those on, regardless if it's just a goofy one, it means every difficulty is easy

270
01:14:05,159 --> 01:14:11,050
or it's it. I can't get achievements for playing on hard and I still have to beat the game.

271
01:14:11,909 --> 01:14:15,109
All right. What else we got? I'm going to let's all right. Let's beat the game.

272
01:14:15,109 --> 01:14:21,479
I'm going to unlock everything so then I can just play the side stuff with cheats. Do you

273
01:14:21,479 --> 01:14:28,149
really care about achievements? Well, I care about unlocking things and I think you have to play

274
01:14:28,149 --> 01:14:43,579
missions on normal or hard to unlock things. All right, let's do it. Lead an assault on

275
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:52,939
Horizon HQ. Destroy Horizon once and for all. We've finally done it. We destroyed Horizon's

276
01:14:52,939 --> 01:14:58,140
unethical research projects. We expose their dark secrets to the world. Their stocks are crumbling.

277
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:03,659
Employees are quitting en masse. The company lies in ruins. The CEO and executives are hiding

278
01:15:03,659 --> 01:15:08,300
in Horizon's corporate headquarters. Eliminate them and destroy Horizon once and for all.

279
01:15:16,069 --> 01:15:23,739
My accolades. All right, let me get different weapons because this is a normal mission. So I

280
01:15:23,739 --> 01:15:42,140
want some different stuff. All right. Flashbangs are useful because you have five armor, obviously.

281
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:57,939
I'm going single SMG and it's going to be unfolded, unfolded stock. It's no suppressor.

282
01:15:57,939 --> 01:16:12,279
And then I'm going to do honestly grenade launcher because it's just, I need some

283
01:16:12,279 --> 01:16:21,380
destruction power. Should I even do homing? Lower velocity grenades with a longer fuse that home

284
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:33,109
onto enemies. Meh, I don't think so. What kind of games do you like? I like games where you have

285
01:16:33,109 --> 01:16:44,550
upgrades. I love games that have interesting loot. I like casual games that you can play in bed.

286
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:59,619
Those are fun. I like upgrading. Oh, you know what I got to play? Uh, there's a new game.

287
01:17:00,739 --> 01:17:07,239
Torment. What's it called? It's kind of like Vampire Survivors. It's new and it looks great.

288
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:14,569
Falls of Torment. Yeah, that's fun. I got to play that. That looks really, really,

289
01:17:14,569 --> 01:17:33,300
that looks pretty damn good. Is it good? Can you please jump into the helicopter blades? I tried

290
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:37,579
already and it didn't work. So I'm sorry that I cannot do that. All right, here we go. Final

291
01:17:37,579 --> 01:17:47,829
mission of the game. Let's do it. I think I'm good. I think I have a pretty good arsenal.

292
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:55,000
Was that poker game you played on iPad? That would be pine tar poker. It's very good.

293
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:04,119
Pine tar poker, pine tar poker. They keep cutting me off. Pine tar poker on the app store. It's a

294
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:12,470
fun game. It's a combination of Yahtzee and also poker. It's a very, very fun game to play. You've

295
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:18,069
got maybe an airplane trip you're going to go on. It's a good thing to kill some time.

296
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:22,310
If you want to just relax and, you know, take, you want to get like a little bit of a wind down

297
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:36,380
scenario in your, you know, in bed. All right, let's go. Let's go get them. It's time to use

298
01:18:36,380 --> 01:19:39,189
everything I've learned. Do we swap or is it time to do a weld? How do I open the door? Am I missing

299
01:19:39,189 --> 01:20:35,500
something? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Holy shit. You're all so dead. All right. The other door is going

300
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:51,479
to open now, right? I don't know. Open up everything. Take everything. Blow this up.

301
01:20:51,479 --> 01:21:15,000
Other side for sure. I wasn't even looking in the right direction. I got 10 bullets for this. Oh,

302
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:25,579
yeah. This thing was a great pick. Good. Very good choice here. Yeah. I want the actual grenades.

303
01:21:25,579 --> 01:21:46,060
He's patting himself on the back. Yep. It's a good call. I made a good call. I'm not allowed

304
01:21:46,060 --> 01:22:08,020
to say that was a good call. All right. Somebody could be right here. No. All right. We're good.

305
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:19,159
We want to go to the bridge. You think I would wait till I got out of the elevator before pressing

306
01:22:19,159 --> 01:22:56,180
the button? All right. Let's go. Yikes. What was that? All right. Oh, my God. We'll be still

307
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:10,569
alive back there. Whatever. All right. Do I have to get in the building? What's that? Remind me

308
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:18,949
that this is here because they definitely want me to do this for some reason. Smart gun. Bullets

309
01:23:18,949 --> 01:24:23,500
home on two enemies. Yeah. Oh, OK. Dude, dude, these bullets. Smart. Not that smart. You have

310
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:46,710
to aim. Stand back. Stand back. Stand back. Stand back. Stand. How about these fucking smart

311
01:24:46,710 --> 01:25:23,779
bullets? Who's left? You? I got him. All right. Let's I got to do some inventory. Where is this

312
01:25:23,779 --> 01:26:15,989
guy? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I need to. Give me that. Give me that. Give me that. Give me that.

313
01:26:15,989 --> 01:26:32,569
Give me this. Give me this. Fucking ammo in this gun. I'm sorry. I can't fucking do anything.

314
01:26:32,649 --> 01:26:44,579
I can't reload the gun. All right. Come on. No more fucking around. Give me my smart gun.

315
01:26:51,939 --> 01:27:50,359
It's overstimulated. All right. These are smart. What the guy was aiming at the ground. Oh, shit.

316
01:27:50,359 --> 01:28:16,060
Are you all right? I'm going in. I'm going in. I'm going in. Oh, I give me some help up here.

317
01:28:28,789 --> 01:29:20,340
I don't know. Do you like it? What the fuck am I doing here? I need to go. Stop being an idiot.

318
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:32,579
No. Get off of there. Get out of my way. Dude, I got no guns left. I have no ammo left. You guys

319
01:29:32,579 --> 01:29:54,810
have to help me. You guys have to do a lot of work here. I have no bullets. Oh, my God. Please.

320
01:29:55,449 --> 01:29:58,489
Give me his gun. He had a gun. He had a gun. He has a gun. He has a gun. Give me that. No,

321
01:29:58,489 --> 01:30:42,460
give me the gun. Give me. Give me. That guy didn't even exist. That guy didn't exist. Oh,

322
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:59,260
my God. Your fucking oxygen tank is just such a pain in the ass. Okay. Move up. Move up. Move up.

323
01:30:59,579 --> 01:32:02,680
You guys getting? I got it. That was crazy. That's not it. Oh, my God. Wow. That was awesome.

324
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:12,600
That was hoggers. I'll keep the shotguns. Let me make sure I have ammo, though.

325
01:32:13,159 --> 01:32:25,590
Horizon factory explosion, chain explosion. It's just kind of a new story.

326
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:40,170
Everybody all right? Pick up all the intel. I hereby tender by resignation from Horizon

327
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:44,569
effective immediately. I am deeply troubled by the recent revelation of the company's

328
01:32:44,569 --> 01:32:57,859
immoral activities. Okay. You know what video games do a lot and movies do this too?

329
01:33:00,329 --> 01:33:06,409
The trope of the CEO has a message that's just being played on giant speakers throughout the

330
01:33:06,409 --> 01:33:15,829
entire building. There's like a CEO monologue that plays where is this an I don't think that's that

331
01:33:15,829 --> 01:33:22,550
normal of an occurrence to have the CEO be just like talking through giant PA system all day at

332
01:33:22,550 --> 01:34:22,140
work. You do this at work. Oh, I created you. Am I the bad guy? I'm sorry. I didn't really hear

333
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:25,819
much of what you said. I was thinking of a really cool way. I was going to kill you.

334
01:34:25,819 --> 01:34:48,760
Oh, we need to all just got to chill for a sec.

335
01:34:49,319 --> 01:35:13,050
Attention all personnel. Evacuate now. That's still got you, buddy.

336
01:35:27,859 --> 01:35:38,949
I don't know. No, no, no, no, no, no. How is he dead? All right. This is going to get intense

337
01:35:38,949 --> 01:35:48,199
right now. Or you take off. Just give me 30 minutes. I may be able to install something

338
01:35:48,199 --> 01:35:57,989
to help with the upload process. They're uploading the virus to the cloud. Almost got me.

339
01:35:58,630 --> 01:36:23,140
Oh, my arm. How is that? I want to know how it's possible that I just missed all those.

340
01:36:23,779 --> 01:36:46,979
How is that possible? That is impossible. More Intel. There's a lot of Intel here.

341
01:36:46,979 --> 01:36:53,270
Our employee satisfaction survey just leaked. It was all one star reviews. We need to find a way

342
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:56,310
to cover this up as soon as possible. Maybe a few incentives will change people's minds.

343
01:36:56,949 --> 01:37:46,279
One star. Here we go. I got running. They'll never see us through the blinds.

344
01:38:19,939 --> 01:39:06,199
That guy's head did a full 360. We're good. Oh, he's he has a lawnmower gun. All right.

345
01:39:06,199 --> 01:39:24,069
He has a lawnmower gun. I want a smart gun, but I want all right. There we go.

346
01:39:24,069 --> 01:39:46,569
And I only have one of these. I can only hold one. I can't do a well. The smart gun. That's too bad.

347
01:39:46,569 --> 01:39:54,340
That would have been so funny. You're reading this. You are among the few who chose to remain

348
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:59,979
and make a stand. I applaud your bravery. I am moved by your passion and belief in the company's

349
01:39:59,979 --> 01:40:07,189
values. Most of us will not live to see tomorrow, but the people of the future will thank us for

350
01:40:07,189 --> 01:40:11,989
the stand we make today. They may not know your names or your actions, but what we do here today

351
01:40:11,989 --> 01:40:19,029
will leave a mark in humanity's history. We cannot win today, but I still have one trick left up my

352
01:40:19,029 --> 01:40:26,939
sleeve. My last request. Buy me some time. Your children will live in a better world for it.

353
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:33,979
I'm gonna smart gun this guy. All right. Should I not even give this guy a second to talk?

354
01:40:33,979 --> 01:40:38,789
I'm thinking about just revving up the lawnmower, opening the door into slow motioning.

355
01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:57,350
Hi. He's just dead. Oh, no. He did. He did the joke. He did the joke.

356
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:15,609
Oh, no. It was the Puzzler. It's your lucky quarter. This looks like a FPS map.

357
01:41:20,949 --> 01:41:25,829
Okay. I didn't even know what we were doing. That was okay. That was like a first person shooter

358
01:41:25,829 --> 01:42:01,180
map. I didn't know we were changing maps. This thing is too hot. It's too hot. It's too hot.

359
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:50,699
It's too hot. Get this thing ready. I don't know who's up there, but I'm gonna make a funny joke

360
01:42:50,699 --> 01:42:55,590
and you'll know when it's about time for you to die. Here we go. Playing Mario Kart.

361
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:13,640
All right. Where the fuck are you? He's so silly. Oh, that was so silly. What I just did.

362
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:39,289
I need ammo. What's this? Oh, boy. Okay. Well, this is the final battle, I think, coming up.

363
01:43:39,289 --> 01:43:52,020
How do I want to be in the final battle? I feel like this thing is gonna- I'm gonna get rid of

364
01:43:52,020 --> 01:44:07,659
this very quickly. I'm not sure it's shotguns, honestly. I think I want a sniper rifle,

365
01:44:07,659 --> 01:44:18,649
as weird as that sounds. This might be really stupid, but I'm gonna go sniper rifle and smart

366
01:44:18,649 --> 01:44:39,420
gun. I'm gonna go in headshots only. Smart bullets work aim down sights. I don't think

367
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:49,050
there is an aim down sights unless I have to put it on. I'm gonna try it. Here's the last piece of

368
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:56,949
intel. Calling any personnel who meet or exceed the following requirements. Cranial capacity over

369
01:44:56,949 --> 01:45:11,100
1,800. Master's degree or higher. You're needed for an emergency project immediately. I gotta

370
01:45:11,100 --> 01:47:32,539
pee real bad. Give me one sec. For the final battle. I have returned. I'm ready for the final

371
01:47:32,539 --> 01:47:49,539
battle. Okay. I'll try sniper. Yeah, you gotta get the pee out of your system before you do

372
01:47:49,539 --> 01:48:10,060
something like this. You married into it. It is hot out. Sorry. It is hot out. It's on way more

373
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:21,689
Chad. It's hot and dry out here. All right. Give me some, give me a little bit of slack.

374
01:48:21,689 --> 01:48:30,060
It's very dry and it's very hot out here. I'm ready. All right. How do I, where's the,

375
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:51,779
let's go. Dry or humid heat worse? Humid heat is the worst thing on earth. I will take dry heat

376
01:48:51,779 --> 01:48:59,420
over humid heat every single day of the week. Every day of the week. In a dry heat, you do not

377
01:48:59,420 --> 01:49:05,670
really sweat, which is actually kind of more dangerous in a way because you don't, you don't

378
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:12,489
realize like, oh, I'm not sweating. It's so dry. Everything's fine. But it's like 110 degrees out

379
01:49:12,489 --> 01:49:20,489
and dry. You gotta be sure you're hydrating. Oh, we gotta go this way. All right. I got full

380
01:49:20,489 --> 01:49:25,109
grenades. I got full smart gun. I'm ready. This is it. Let's kick the door in and I'm ready.

381
01:49:25,109 --> 01:49:54,250
Cutscene. Ooh. Wait, what? Wait, what? He's just lying down naked in a chamber.

382
01:49:54,890 --> 01:50:12,710
That was never, that was never going to work. Brain upload in progress. Wait,

383
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:37,939
that guy just sprayed me in the face like a bottle. Well, water bottle. What? Oh, I don't know.

384
01:50:38,659 --> 01:50:59,859
Where's the brain? Where's the brain upload? Oh, can you do crazy frog? What's going on?

385
01:50:59,939 --> 01:51:15,670
Yeah. God damn it. You've leaned. You've leaned. Like I leaned.

386
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:55,720
I just picked up every single fucking health pack. I'm in so much trouble. I'm in so much trouble.

387
01:51:56,539 --> 01:52:31,260
Smart gun out. Did you hear that? I slid by that wall. It was just I picked up every health pack.

388
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:34,699
I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot what was going on.

389
01:52:35,180 --> 01:53:09,939
I forgot. All right. This is the one right here. Let's go. That took a lot from the smart gun.

390
01:53:09,939 --> 01:53:15,140
Damn it, man. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I got to take the smart gun out there

391
01:53:15,140 --> 01:55:03,220
and just spray. Where are they? Where are they? Get it. Oh, pick it up. Why would I have two sniper

392
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:11,220
rifles? This is not good at all. Where's the brain? Where's the brain? Holy shit. This is hard.

393
01:55:11,220 --> 01:56:00,859
This is hard. Did I get it? I didn't even. Dude, I die in three fucking hits. Okay.

394
01:56:38,649 --> 01:56:46,649
Dude, I just threw two grenades at it. Do I have to shoot it through the window?

395
01:56:46,649 --> 01:56:49,850
I have to shoot the glass. I can't load up with that. It didn't hit the glass.

396
01:56:52,550 --> 01:57:30,409
How does a grenade not hit the glass? Okay. Go back over there. All right. Go, go, go. It's

397
01:57:30,409 --> 01:57:57,079
on the other side. Other side. I'm not dead. Oh, where is it? Where are you? What the fuck are

398
01:57:57,079 --> 01:58:06,810
you doing over there? Oh my goodness, dude. You got to be fucking kidding me.

399
01:58:14,279 --> 01:58:22,010
God, what is happening? Wait, I didn't even reload this gun yet. Who's talking? Who is it? The

400
01:58:22,010 --> 01:59:20,090
dentist. No. No. Yeah. I need a gun right now. Dude, what do I do? No. I'm so glad I'm bad. I'm

401
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:35,930
so glad I'm bad. I'm so glad I'm bad at this game. I'm so glad I'm bad at this. Oh, fuck. It's just

402
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:43,289
so much going on. There's just too many things happening at the same time. Do I have to do it

403
01:59:43,289 --> 02:00:09,960
all over again? Oh, this sucks. Dude, I don't know. Just take it. Take it. Go, go, go, go. I don't

404
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:40,899
know. That's it. That's it. Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. Go, go, go. That's it. That's it. Where is

405
02:00:40,899 --> 02:00:57,159
this? There's still an upload going on. Where's this last upload? What the fuck are you talking

406
02:00:57,159 --> 02:01:11,739
about? What? Dude, where is this last part? I need a different gun. Like, give me ammo for the ships.

407
02:01:11,739 --> 02:01:46,859
Give me ammo for a different weapon. This is too much stimulation. This is like overload. This is

408
02:01:46,859 --> 02:02:03,640
just like, I feel like I'm playing the game at times 10 speed. Am I hitting anybody over here?

409
02:02:12,649 --> 02:02:18,729
I don't know where anybody is. There's no way to tell. I don't know, dude. They just keep respawning.

410
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:27,829
You have to aim a dude. Okay, here's what's going on right now.

411
02:02:33,050 --> 02:02:36,340
That's the only sound effect. I can't.

412
02:02:56,409 --> 02:03:21,779
Fuck you. Dude, I keep here. I keep getting put back to the dentist. Oh, and everybody has grenades.

413
02:03:22,579 --> 02:03:36,680
Oh my. I can't like brain upload. All right, now what the fuck do I do?

414
02:03:37,239 --> 02:03:44,279
You idiot. Why would you walk over to me? Why would you walk over here? You idiot. You dumb guy.

415
02:03:44,279 --> 02:03:58,329
What's wrong with you? Okay. I get rid of this thing. This thing does like too damage. This weapon

416
02:03:58,329 --> 02:04:20,630
is awful. I don't even, I don't want to snipe a rifle either. I picked the two worst possible

417
02:04:20,630 --> 02:04:44,779
weapons for this fucking mission. This grenades everywhere. They just crashed the helicopter.

418
02:04:44,779 --> 02:04:49,659
Crash the helicopter. They just crashed the helicopter. There's too much going on.

419
02:04:49,659 --> 02:05:02,039
I have to restart the level and pick different weapons. I have no ammo all of a sudden. Give

420
02:05:02,039 --> 02:05:29,779
me that. All right. Now fuck you. Perfect. How are you guys still alive? Shut up.

421
02:05:50,779 --> 02:05:54,550
Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

422
02:05:57,460 --> 02:06:16,420
All right. Now what? Smart gun, actual smart gun. I can't get in there.

423
02:06:32,649 --> 02:06:51,829
Okay. Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me. There's no way. There's no way.

424
02:07:02,649 --> 02:07:18,939
Shoot him. There's too many people. There's too many people there. I needed that. I needed it.

425
02:07:39,300 --> 02:08:06,840
Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. You better not kill me. Oh no. Oh my God. Oh my God.

426
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:13,079
There was like a hundred people there. There was a hundred. Why were there so many people there?

427
02:08:13,079 --> 02:08:24,390
Why were there so many people? Oh my God. Oh, thank God. There's a checkpoint.

428
02:08:25,189 --> 02:10:06,680
Give me that. Get out of here. Let me in. Let's do it. Yes.

429
02:10:24,979 --> 02:11:17,180
All right. I need some. All right. Give me your gun. Where is it? Okay. Fuck it. Let's go.

430
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:26,760
I'm ready. No, I'm not. I want help. This game doesn't look very Christian.

431
02:11:28,819 --> 02:11:36,859
Oh yeah. Probably not. I don't know. All right. I have, I want a different weapon than this.

432
02:11:37,420 --> 02:11:41,659
We'll go with this because I think I'm going to get spawned on. I'm going full firepower

433
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:48,279
and I have to take cover. Where am I going to take cover? It's probably a good idea to

434
02:11:48,279 --> 02:12:14,149
go in the building and hide here. Let's do it. Get the fuck out of here. Get out of here.

435
02:12:14,149 --> 02:13:16,840
Is it me? That's me. That's me. Wait, what? What did I do? I like teleported. Was I him?

436
02:13:17,479 --> 02:13:33,159
Did I like, my consciousness jumped? How did I get through the wall? Break the cycle. How did I

437
02:13:33,159 --> 02:13:44,869
get in the, how did I get in? There was some weird stuff going on early in the game. You know,

438
02:13:44,869 --> 02:13:50,729
those drones, they're like, Hey, don't trust people. And you're, it's not, everything's not

439
02:13:50,729 --> 02:14:21,100
what it seems. And now the room filled with gas. Liquidation process initiative. I'm getting

440
02:14:21,100 --> 02:15:13,689
liquidated. It's been cool to have one of those. That seemed like an awesome weapon. I'm everybody.

441
02:15:13,689 --> 02:15:41,369
It's a different 106 every time. I'm everybody. No, it isn't. Not if I have anything to say about

442
02:15:41,369 --> 02:16:11,770
it. Why would you pick a gun out? Why would you take a gun out? That's up and point it close

443
02:16:11,770 --> 02:16:19,909
to my face. I was about to be burned. Oh, that guy. Hey, they're going to write a whole

444
02:16:19,909 --> 02:16:23,670
entire history book about how you fucked up right there. There's going to be

445
02:16:24,229 --> 02:16:40,180
textbooks written about what you did. What's the Intel terminate rogue assets. This is what I am

446
02:16:42,389 --> 02:17:34,700
armor and speed improvements recommended for next cycle. Give me that. Oh, okay. Yep. I'll stand

447
02:17:34,700 --> 02:17:40,700
out. What would you want me to go back and lie on the, on the burn table thing? I can do that.

448
02:17:41,940 --> 02:17:51,500
Yeah. Where was it? It was back here, right? Stand. Yeah. Here we go. Okay. I'm ready. I'm really

449
02:17:51,500 --> 02:18:21,860
sorry. You can press, you can press the button. I won't do anything else. Ooh. Oh, watch out for

450
02:18:21,860 --> 02:18:55,459
enemies. We were friends quarter master. Really is not. It sucks to be that guy. The guy that opened

451
02:18:55,459 --> 02:19:38,700
the door. Yeah. I mean, come on. Oh my God. I'm so bad. Any health. There we go. There's a nice spam.

452
02:19:38,700 --> 02:20:02,500
Hey, you do what you got to do. All right. Nobody else. Okay. Uh, I don't, there's nothing really on

453
02:20:02,500 --> 02:20:12,840
the ground. Have I not picked up any shotgun ammo? It seems impossible. Okay. Where's the

454
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:37,860
off switch for this? What do you mean? Dude, dude, what, what? Shoot the red. I have to pull one of

455
02:20:37,860 --> 02:20:48,600
those fuse boxes. What do you mean? Shoot the red. Dude, I'm sorry. I've never had to do that the

456
02:20:48,600 --> 02:21:09,059
whole game. I have not had to do that the whole game. I've been looking for a fuse box, dude.

457
02:21:11,159 --> 02:21:48,790
Let's go. I didn't kill either one of them. You know what? I got a better idea. Oh, it didn't

458
02:21:48,790 --> 02:22:16,889
kill you. All right. It's all right. Okay. Good. Oh my God. Oh, are we okay? Am I alive?

459
02:22:18,940 --> 02:22:45,799
I have one shot. All right. I, I got to get ready. Shut down. I think I'm good with this for now.

460
02:22:45,879 --> 02:23:36,520
Send here. And, uh, yeah, here we go. Super soldiers or something. Oh, that's literally me.

461
02:23:36,520 --> 02:23:48,920
We're all. Oh, all right. What the, that's actually scared the shit out of me. That was right.

462
02:23:48,920 --> 02:24:16,889
That's behind my head. Oh my God. I hate that. What am I doing? I didn't mean to press that

463
02:24:16,889 --> 02:24:32,100
button. My fat fingered it. Okay. I'm thinking shotgun. Okay. I can see you cause you're on fire.

464
02:24:32,100 --> 02:25:06,860
This is perfect. Damn it. All right. All right. Spy checking. Yeah. How did I miss?

465
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:51,479
What are you doing? Where'd he go? Don't walk over here with that on your body.

466
02:25:54,280 --> 02:26:43,829
This place is like gonna blow. Oh, it's so dead. Anybody else? Where is he?

467
02:26:45,799 --> 02:27:20,979
I'm so sorry guys. I've just fucking, it's terrifying. Where's he going? What? What? Turn

468
02:27:20,979 --> 02:27:59,659
it off. Oh shit. Yup. Wow. Um, okay. I have one arm. Go, go, go, go, go. What is that sound?

469
02:28:19,659 --> 02:28:51,700
Oh my God. Oh my God. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Uh, oh, a drone. Location. Syndicate

470
02:28:51,700 --> 02:29:02,700
cloning facility. Accessing user memories. Successful. Package. Syndicate cloning activity.

471
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:15,270
Upload complete. Accessing attempt. Accessing network. Subject 105 termination. Verified.

472
02:29:15,270 --> 02:29:21,799
Pandora Institute. Evidence of anomalous research. Incomplete. Mission to terminate subject 91.

473
02:29:21,799 --> 02:29:30,729
Incomplete. Syndicate thermonuclear warhead. Cyperia. Tower massacre. Incomplete. Syndicate

474
02:29:30,729 --> 02:29:36,090
cloning activity. Mission critical data. Incomplete. You'll be remembered. There's

475
02:29:36,090 --> 02:29:42,420
no extraction. Destroy the facility. You'll be remembered. These are the drones that you missed.

476
02:29:44,659 --> 02:30:06,569
Bad ending. Okay. Exiting program. Well, how does it end? I feel like this is not a lot of bullets

477
02:30:06,569 --> 02:30:21,459
for what is about to happen here. I could be wrong, but let's just go. Uh, this is the way

478
02:30:21,459 --> 02:30:47,110
I came in. Okay. Let's go. Oh, that's the nuke. I remember. I tried to blow this thing up. All

479
02:30:47,110 --> 02:31:10,229
right. Don't let them get near the nuke. You think you can block that? What if I go invisible?

480
02:31:10,229 --> 02:31:59,700
I need a gun. Shotgun. I need a shotgun. There's the shotgun right there. Give me that. Give me

481
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:09,239
your gun. Give me that. Give me that. Oh, fuck you. Oh, I have nothing. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I...

482
02:32:10,280 --> 02:32:31,540
Where did they all come from? Dude, I... Oh my... Why do I have a pistol? This pistol... Can I just

483
02:32:31,540 --> 02:32:44,329
throw this in the trash? All right. Let's go. Why did I pick up a pistol for any reason?

484
02:32:57,690 --> 02:33:14,569
Where is he? I'm just trying to... Oh, I'm going to get hurt too. I'm getting too hurt.

485
02:33:14,569 --> 02:33:50,899
Way too hurt. What's going on? What's happening? What's going on? Did you hear that? That's way

486
02:33:50,899 --> 02:34:39,610
too many people. Stop throwing grenades. All right. I think I'm good. Only one more. Let's go. Let's

487
02:34:39,610 --> 02:35:10,200
go. Let's go. This is it. This is it. This is it. This is it. Where is he? I'm getting too greedy.

488
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:42,420
Too greedy. Don't be stupid. Don't be greedy. Goodbye. Yes. Those of you playing harder than

489
02:35:42,420 --> 02:36:08,920
hard, you're a god. You are a god. I think we just blow it up, right? I played this on very hard.

490
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:23,260
I have no idea how I'd go harder than that. Oh, we just nuked the base. Oh, that's the intro.

491
02:36:23,260 --> 02:36:41,239
I was wondering why they kept showing that. That's you nuking the base. I get it. Hey,

492
02:36:41,239 --> 02:37:07,959
Gianni, do you not have to nuke yourself for the good ending? That's a good question. I'm not sure.

493
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:20,569
Filing data. Publishing 3968 sources done. Reconstruction unavailable. Memories incomplete.

494
02:37:20,569 --> 02:37:34,200
Signing off. We uploaded it. Okay. Mission accomplished 106. Hope you enjoyed playing

495
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:40,520
the Trepang 2 campaign. You've just unlocked a ton of cool new camos, cheats, and combat simulator

496
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:45,829
missions. Go check them out sometime. Come join the community and hang out with us sometime. We

497
02:37:45,829 --> 02:37:56,010
love to talk with our fans. That was great. That was genuinely really, really, really wonderful.

498
02:38:01,030 --> 02:38:07,829
Okay. There's a lot of stuff here now. What do we want to do? Enemies activate physics thrusters

499
02:38:07,829 --> 02:38:16,250
on death? Insane gore. Let's do a couple at a time here. We're going to do squeaky voices.

500
02:38:16,889 --> 02:38:27,459
Wait, hold on. Let me just see what is actually unlocked here. Show the sunflowers. I will do

501
02:38:27,459 --> 02:38:40,389
that when I am done with Trepang 2. So soon. Not immediately, but soon. Anything else unlock?

502
02:38:40,389 --> 02:39:03,530
I only have one other mission here. The Gunnarsson complex is fun. Look at it just in the outskirts

503
02:39:03,530 --> 02:39:07,850
of Stockholm. The Gunnarsson complex is the center of Horizon's intelligence gathering in Europe.

504
02:39:07,850 --> 02:39:23,559
Solve the facility and retrieve the encrypted data. That's right. I don't really care about

505
02:39:23,559 --> 02:39:31,719
the achievements now. Let's do squeaky voices. NPCs throw a lot of grenades.

506
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:50,420
NPCs respond as jiggly boys when killed. Okay. Scale enemy accuracy. What does that mean? Scale

507
02:39:50,420 --> 02:40:01,690
NPC reaction speed. Move speed multiplier. Cloak removed. Focus removed. Slide does not do anything.

508
02:40:02,809 --> 02:40:11,610
Your health constantly drains until 1%. Spooky mode. Infinite ammo. For a second I thought

509
02:40:11,610 --> 02:40:18,469
they said can't read. I was like does that mean you can't look at intelligence? Everything is

510
02:40:18,469 --> 02:40:28,860
a knife. All weapons become inaccurate. Okay. There's a lot on right now. So we're going to

511
02:40:28,860 --> 02:40:42,569
do these. NPC thrusters. Okay. Why is it all so dark? Oh because it's spooky mode. That just

512
02:40:42,569 --> 02:41:08,180
means the game is dark. What do I want to bring? Blue double SMG. That sounds fun to me. And

513
02:41:09,299 --> 02:41:21,260
grenade launcher. Sounds good. Don't need homing on it. These are just default. He's fine. All

514
02:41:21,260 --> 02:41:29,620
right. Let's go check it out. All right. Spooky mode. Spooky mode just makes this really hard

515
02:41:29,620 --> 02:41:53,350
to navigate. Where's the stairs? Okay. Let's go. How come the voices aren't squeaky? There's no

516
02:41:53,350 --> 02:42:20,360
squeaky voices. What have we been waiting for? Probably just the enemies here. This was in the

517
02:42:20,360 --> 02:42:30,739
demo. This was in the demo. Spooky mode have turned it off. Oh shit. That's not going to help us.

518
02:42:31,700 --> 02:42:56,069
Okay. Yeah. So I, this is cool. I just can't really see very well. Let's go for it. Who has

519
02:42:56,069 --> 02:43:18,620
the squeaky voice? Oh, oh my, that hurts my ears. That hurts my ears. I can't see anybody. What is

520
02:43:18,700 --> 02:44:14,620
that? He's still alive. It's the minions. What? Jesus. All right. I'll take a more proximity

521
02:44:14,620 --> 02:44:47,879
mines. Oh my God. What is wrong with this guy? Okay. Can I have the light back now? There we go.

522
02:44:47,879 --> 02:45:57,020
Okay. Okay. Here we go. Okay. Hey, hey, holy shit. Everything. Get out of the way, dude. Get out

523
02:45:57,020 --> 02:46:06,950
of the way. It's too much. It's too much going on. I'll try it one more time. I'm going to try to

524
02:46:06,950 --> 02:47:09,129
win. I don't have any ammo. Almost done. I mean, it's kind of funny. It's kind of funny. It's kind

525
02:47:09,209 --> 02:47:44,360
of funny. All right. Where's the next one? Okay. Pack it. This one's done. Pack it.

526
02:48:23,930 --> 02:48:44,620
What just happened over here? Who's smoking? All right. More and more of those. All right.

527
02:48:44,620 --> 02:50:08,870
Hack. Oh, we good. Oh, holy shit. All right. I got to turn this on. I turn this on. Turn this

528
02:50:08,870 --> 02:50:15,110
on. It's funny. It's fun, but I got to, I don't know what I just did. Is this like one of those

529
02:50:15,110 --> 02:50:33,059
flash games? What do you mean flash game? What do you mean it's a flash game? I'm going to try

530
02:50:33,059 --> 02:50:41,079
this one for real, and then we're going to move on to the sunflowers. Restart level. I'm going to

531
02:50:41,079 --> 02:51:50,010
try this one for real. All right. Let's try it for real. Oh, wait. Somebody's hacking it. Hack it

532
02:51:50,010 --> 02:52:20,100
again. Hacking. Need to fill the dead air. Um, got him. Somebody up top two. Watch out. Yep. Right

533
02:52:20,100 --> 02:52:40,629
here. Got one. Specialists. It's another one of those words. Specialists. Specialists.

534
02:52:41,270 --> 02:53:32,579
Specialists. I did not even get hurt by that. All right. Whoa. Where are you? Woo. Where are you?

535
02:53:32,579 --> 02:54:36,920
One more. One more guy. Get off of me. All right. Load it up. Good shot. Good shot. Huh?

536
02:54:56,069 --> 02:55:41,979
Cool. No, you did not get me. Dead air. Um, uh, dead air. It don't matter. I'm just playing.

537
02:55:41,979 --> 02:56:05,659
I, it's all good. That was so not cool. What I just did. All right. Where's the last one?

538
02:56:08,340 --> 02:56:27,049
I need supplies actually. Where's the box? Here it is. Okay. Give me. What do I want?

539
02:56:27,690 --> 02:56:38,500
All right. What do I want? Should I get another grenade launcher? Give me the bolt launcher.

540
02:56:41,930 --> 02:56:49,780
I'm okay for now. Okay. I think this is all right now. This thing is destructive.

541
02:57:09,219 --> 02:57:58,180
Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh, ouch. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I'm out of ammo. Oh, this is not good.

542
02:57:58,180 --> 02:58:33,180
Get in there. Don't you dare kill me. I don't know for health kit. I can, I can do armor. Okay. Okay.

543
02:58:33,180 --> 02:59:06,940
Who's left? All right. Through the window. Oh shit. I didn't even start them. Oh,

544
02:59:06,940 --> 02:59:42,629
that's embarrassing, but whatever. I'm going to get flash bangs. Okay, boys. All right, boys.

545
02:59:57,559 --> 03:00:43,430
Oh, oh, fuck you. All of you. I'm in big shit. Oh, no way, dude. No way. No way. Oh, that's rough.

546
03:00:43,430 --> 03:01:04,809
That was the end right there. It's all right. Oh, dude. No way, dude. Open the door. Why would,

547
03:01:05,879 --> 03:01:36,549
what were you thinking? All right. All right. He's hitting gamer fatigue.

548
03:01:36,950 --> 03:02:30,579
Ah, maybe a little. Oh, the guy's head just went in so many different directions.

549
03:02:30,579 --> 03:02:52,540
That was fucking crazy. Oh shit. I got nothing left. I got nothing left. I got nothing left.

550
03:02:57,420 --> 03:03:30,950
Oh, fuck this guy. Oh, that guy sucks. I need a different weapon. Oh shit.

551
03:03:30,950 --> 03:04:04,340
I can't. I'm too stimulated. Get over here. Don't. Oh my God. Damn it. I need, I need two

552
03:04:04,340 --> 03:04:45,079
seconds to fucking reload. Give me more ammo for this thing. You can't be still alive. It's

553
03:04:45,079 --> 03:05:58,219
impossible. You exploded. I don't have any. Who's left? Oh, fuck that guy. Seriously. Oh,

554
03:05:58,219 --> 03:06:42,040
fuck off. There's too many of you idiots with these fucking power armor. Oh, eat shit. Oh my

555
03:06:42,040 --> 03:07:02,020
God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I need more weapons. I can't

556
03:07:02,020 --> 03:07:07,899
just go down there right now. I need to go to the supply thing. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

557
03:07:08,459 --> 03:08:01,610
Where's the supply thing? Hey. Hey. No. Oh, pick it up with H. You idiot. H. H. I can't even.

558
03:08:01,610 --> 03:08:32,520
There's too much shit on the ground. Oh, you piece of shit. Oh, I did it. I actually did it.

559
03:08:32,520 --> 03:09:08,579
Yeah. Okay. I'm ready. How do I get on the roof? How do I get on the roof? How do I get on the

560
03:09:08,579 --> 03:09:46,520
fucking roof? How do I get on the roof? Damn. All right. I did that on hard. There it is.

561
03:09:47,159 --> 03:10:11,670
Did I unlock? I unlocked a new cheat. Well, we have to do that. I need to see big head.

562
03:10:11,670 --> 03:10:15,530
I just want to see the big head and then we'll take a quick break and then we'll look at the

563
03:10:15,530 --> 03:10:41,379
sunflowers. Yeah. I don't need to do any outfitting or anything. Here's the oil rig. Everyone said,

564
03:10:41,379 --> 03:10:51,500
hey, do the oil rig when it's available. This is the last side mission. I don't think I'm going to

565
03:10:51,500 --> 03:11:09,620
beat this one. I think I'll just check it out. I mean, I'm already in here, but as well. Actually,

566
03:11:09,620 --> 03:11:43,639
no, let's do actual grenade grenades. I am all right with this. Tell us that there was some

567
03:11:43,639 --> 03:11:57,239
freaky shit at that oil rig, but they ain't said nothing else. All right. Let him game. Yeah,

568
03:11:57,239 --> 03:12:25,590
I'm just gaming. Oh, his head shrinks. Okay. Now it just feels like this is the mobile game they

569
03:12:25,590 --> 03:12:46,440
came out with at the same time as a marketing tool. This is the mobile game. Okay. I'm dead.

570
03:12:46,440 --> 03:12:59,770
All right. All right. All right. Let's do the sunflowers. It's time. I'm going to take a quick

571
03:12:59,770 --> 03:13:05,270
break. I'm going to get them over here so I can put them on the screen. We will showcase the

572
03:13:05,270 --> 03:13:14,760
sunflowers. You have no idea what's going on pretty much every year. The last two or three years,

573
03:13:14,760 --> 03:13:24,250
although didn't do very much last year, but it's been very, very, very hot. Sunflowers got a ton

574
03:13:25,590 --> 03:13:36,780
of sun this year, but yeah, I, Holly and I planted a bunch of stuff. We've been very good plant

575
03:13:36,780 --> 03:13:47,209
parents. At least I hope so. Are they taller than you? Yeah. Here's the thing. The last time we did

576
03:13:47,209 --> 03:13:56,420
this, we got ones that could go up to eight to 12 feet. I think is what it was. These ones were

577
03:13:56,420 --> 03:14:00,260
only supposed to go because it's like, Oh, but let's maybe we'll do some smaller ones this year.

578
03:14:00,260 --> 03:14:10,520
These were supposed to only go four feet and they're still 10 feet tall. These were not the big

579
03:14:10,520 --> 03:14:19,780
ones. It's just out here in Vegas. The sun just rains down all fucking day. They love it out here.

580
03:14:19,780 --> 03:14:29,530
They just absorb so many of these sun's rays and we fertilize, you know, fertilize them. All right.

581
03:14:29,530 --> 03:14:33,780
Give me a minute. I'm going to get it set. I'll come back. We'll hang out for a little bit longer

582
03:14:33,780 --> 03:14:38,389
and let's do some sunflowers. See you in like four or five minutes. I'm going to pee. I'm going to

583
03:14:38,389 --> 03:19:10,680
refill my drink. I'll be back. Okay. I am back. I'm going to put some nice music on while we sit here

584
03:19:10,680 --> 03:19:26,329
for like 15 minutes or so. Let me get some nice music. What should we do for nice music? What do

585
03:19:26,329 --> 03:19:39,180
you think? How about Stardew? Oh, that's not a bad one. That's right. All right. Stardew.

586
03:19:39,899 --> 03:19:59,860
We're going to go right in the middle somewhere. Stardew Valley OST. And there it is. Hey, there it

587
03:19:59,860 --> 03:20:14,440
is. I think that's a good start. Okay. So for those of you that are about to join me on the journey

588
03:20:14,440 --> 03:20:25,530
for this year's harvest. Okay. Let me figure out how I'm going to do this. How should I do this?

589
03:20:31,829 --> 03:20:35,579
I think I can just drag them over here. Yeah, this will work. All right. So here

590
03:20:36,780 --> 03:20:53,819
is the, here are the babies, as you can see. The thing about sunflowers and growing anything,

591
03:20:53,819 --> 03:21:00,469
it's actually kind of sad what you need to do. So when you plant sunflower seeds, oh wait,

592
03:21:00,469 --> 03:21:03,030
it doesn't, whatever. You have like a, you know, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that this

593
03:21:03,030 --> 03:21:11,139
year. You have to thin out the ones that don't really make it. If you're going to do them in a

594
03:21:11,139 --> 03:21:17,620
pot. Like if, let's just say for instance, you don't have a bunch of land to do like 50 sunflowers in

595
03:21:17,620 --> 03:21:27,219
a row, you plant, they have to be at least eight inches apart, 12 inches apart. But sometimes,

596
03:21:27,219 --> 03:21:34,299
as you see here, see the one on the left, that, that guy was ready and he was obviously the

597
03:21:34,299 --> 03:21:41,979
stronger one. So that was the one that was going to stick around. The other ones, unfortunately,

598
03:21:41,979 --> 03:21:51,319
they have to go purged. Yeah. And it's always like, no, but if you, I'm going to put you in a

599
03:21:51,319 --> 03:21:56,979
different pot. And what ends up happening is you end up having, you end up, you end up kind of

600
03:21:56,979 --> 03:22:02,680
transferring all the ones that weren't going to make it to a different pot. So you just end up

601
03:22:02,680 --> 03:22:07,159
having a bunch of pots of these ones that kind of don't make it in quotes. You kind of just try to

602
03:22:07,159 --> 03:22:18,629
spread them around. These ones all lived by the way, these were dwarf sunflowers. So I'll give

603
03:22:18,629 --> 03:22:30,360
you another picture here. It's the same group. As you can see the one in the back, a little bit,

604
03:22:30,360 --> 03:22:40,180
a little slow to rise, but all three of these made it. I think that's a pretty good one of them

605
03:22:40,180 --> 03:22:49,979
down here. There is. Yeah. So the big ones, the ones that we have in a big pot are here.

606
03:22:49,979 --> 03:23:09,739
Take a look at these ones. So that's how they start. Oh, hold on. What is this doing? There we go.

607
03:23:09,739 --> 03:23:13,739
They end up getting a little bigger. These ones are different though. These were not,

608
03:23:13,739 --> 03:23:22,280
these ones are not the little ones. Yeah. Again, we went with three this year. They're very,

609
03:23:22,280 --> 03:23:31,370
very strong, very healthy. They got to this stage pretty quickly. It was, it was,

610
03:23:31,370 --> 03:23:41,719
it was like, wow, they're growing really, really, really fast. We didn't just do sunflowers though.

611
03:23:41,719 --> 03:23:51,799
God, gardening is so nice. Let me show you this. What do you think about this one? So those are

612
03:23:51,799 --> 03:24:01,459
sunflowers. Take a look, take a look at this one. Ooh, I don't even know. We don't even know what

613
03:24:01,459 --> 03:24:06,059
this flower is. We just know that it looks really nice and we want to make it look like a national

614
03:24:06,059 --> 03:24:19,479
geographic photo. This is a wildflower. Don't even know what it is. Is it a tulip? I don't know.

615
03:24:19,479 --> 03:24:26,340
This opened, this opened wide. You'll see a couple of pictures of it. This thing was open. Here's

616
03:24:26,340 --> 03:24:39,319
another one from side by side here. So I believe this is the same area. There's a little moth on

617
03:24:39,319 --> 03:24:45,690
this too. There was a couple of orange ones. There was a few pink ones. There was some blue ones.

618
03:24:45,690 --> 03:24:54,629
They were all over the place. Oh no, there's a bug. Just getting some shade. There's a couple of

619
03:24:54,629 --> 03:25:09,399
really, really cute photos. Any more of the tall wildflowers? Yep, I got one here. So this is the

620
03:25:09,399 --> 03:25:16,969
one that you see on the right. Oh, sorry, on the left. Looking through the, looking through the

621
03:25:16,969 --> 03:25:29,000
jungle. Ooh, that's what it opened up into. So what is that? We don't really know what it is.

622
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:35,500
We just don't, because the wildflower packets, you just shake it out. It's just a ton of different

623
03:25:35,500 --> 03:25:58,459
random things. It's a Cosmo? Cosmo. That's cool. It's opium. It's not, it's not opium. This dude's

624
03:25:58,459 --> 03:26:09,690
growing fucking opium. But I know what you're really here for. You're here to see the fucking

625
03:26:09,690 --> 03:26:24,469
blue wildflower. Same pot? Yeah, same pot. And these just popped up kind of randomly. It's kind

626
03:26:24,469 --> 03:26:28,549
of cool to walk out here sometimes and be like, wait, there's a purple one now. That's kind of

627
03:26:28,549 --> 03:26:46,069
cool. Is there any? Let me see. Oh, here's a good one. So this is, this is right before one of the

628
03:26:46,069 --> 03:26:58,520
sunflowers opened. Take a look at that. So as you can probably see the color this year, we had,

629
03:26:58,520 --> 03:27:06,620
they were kind of yellow with brown in the middle and they opened like this,

630
03:27:06,620 --> 03:27:17,219
but then they got to be pretty much yellow. Let's even get that one open. Yeah. Hey, you ready? So

631
03:27:17,219 --> 03:27:23,540
this is kind of, I don't want to show that one yet. We'll just show this one. We'll show it's

632
03:27:23,540 --> 03:27:41,000
starting to open. So there's that one. Take a look at this. Ah, it is opening. So really wild color.

633
03:27:41,000 --> 03:28:00,459
It was like electric in a way. It's so weird because like I said, over time, these actually

634
03:28:00,540 --> 03:28:07,110
get paler. All that orange in the middle goes away almost completely. Just that's how they start for

635
03:28:07,110 --> 03:28:14,219
the first week. Do you grow them inside? No, no, these are all outside. They kind of have to be.

636
03:28:14,219 --> 03:28:20,899
They have to be in direct sun all day. I Googled sunflower and found this on the second page, bro.

637
03:28:20,899 --> 03:28:28,010
We stopped, we stopped fucking with me. Come on. Like we didn't do sunflowers this year. Okay.

638
03:28:28,010 --> 03:28:34,340
Fine. What would you, what do you want me to say? Don't, don't, don't get up in here and fuck it up

639
03:28:34,340 --> 03:28:49,610
for me. So yeah, I want to show you, can I show you my favorite one? And this is a big deal by the

640
03:28:49,610 --> 03:28:56,120
way. This is a big deal. A lot of times when you grow some flowers, you get yellow, yellow, yellow,

641
03:28:56,120 --> 03:29:08,500
yellow, yellow, yellow. This year we got a massive orange one and it stayed orange the entire time it

642
03:29:08,500 --> 03:29:28,950
was here. Bright orange. Let me make it a little smaller. I love the depth of field too. It looks

643
03:29:28,950 --> 03:29:45,030
so nice. And who's that? It's Otto. Yeah. This thing is the size, the middle there is as big as

644
03:29:45,030 --> 03:29:54,299
a fucking softball. This was almost two fists together. How big that middle is, is gigantic.

645
03:29:54,299 --> 03:30:00,500
It's my favorite. I don't want to play favorites, but that's my favorite one this year. Just,

646
03:30:00,500 --> 03:30:15,780
just saying. It looks stunning. Here is one of the dwarf sunflowers open. Very pretty. And these

647
03:30:15,780 --> 03:30:19,620
only get to be, and a lot of people say, Hey, this sounds like really fun. This sounds like really

648
03:30:19,620 --> 03:30:27,610
cool. I can't do that. These are like not even a foot tall. They're tiny. Actually, man, this might

649
03:30:27,610 --> 03:30:34,500
not be the dwarf one. No, this is just one of the regular ones. See the other head forming on the

650
03:30:34,500 --> 03:30:41,860
left side there? Yeah. These were vibrant. Sunflowers are so easy. Oh yeah. Absolutely.

651
03:30:41,860 --> 03:30:49,000
But as long as you, if you, let me learn to talk again. As long as you're in an area that gets a

652
03:30:49,000 --> 03:30:58,040
ton of sunshine throughout the entire summer season, you'll, it'll work. Sunflowers are pretty

653
03:30:58,040 --> 03:31:06,200
easy. And they just, they blow up sometimes. Remember I told you that one of them was a Hydra.

654
03:31:06,200 --> 03:31:12,709
We tried to get some decent pictures of just how many heads appeared on this thing. So let's see.

655
03:31:12,709 --> 03:31:23,540
Yeah. Take a look at this. Are you ready? Check this shit out. So this is at full growth for

656
03:31:24,540 --> 03:31:38,739
the one that I was just showing you. It's like a fucking Elden Ring boss. There are one, two, three,

657
03:31:38,739 --> 03:31:49,750
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. I believe there are 11 heads. It's just trying that they were

658
03:31:49,750 --> 03:31:57,879
facing the other way. And it's just like, ah, shit. It's all right. It's okay. There's a pretty

659
03:31:57,879 --> 03:32:07,670
cool one here looking up here. This one too. This is taken from like the bottom looking up.

660
03:32:07,670 --> 03:32:17,260
This thing was huge. It was probably 10 feet tall and there are heads that are still going to open.

661
03:32:17,260 --> 03:32:30,899
The photos are awesome. Yeah. This is Holly taking all of these pictures. I took one. Yeah. These are,

662
03:32:30,899 --> 03:32:40,409
these are all Holly. They are very, very, very good. All right. I'm going to show you something

663
03:32:40,409 --> 03:32:49,430
now that's going to make you cry. You're going to cry. Hope you're ready. You ready? I don't

664
03:32:49,430 --> 03:33:11,059
know if you're ready. It's a hummingbird drinking out of the big orange one. Not a, no big deal.

665
03:33:11,059 --> 03:33:18,520
Yes. We sat staring at these until one showed up. That was an entire afternoon at one point.

666
03:33:18,520 --> 03:33:33,479
But yeah, we did get a couple of visitors. Speaking of visitors, it was really nice to see.

667
03:33:33,479 --> 03:33:39,370
I don't know. It makes you feel kind of good. So this is a wasp and they would just kind of pop

668
03:33:39,370 --> 03:33:46,680
in from time to time. If you don't like wasps, then you know, you're about to see one. But what

669
03:33:46,680 --> 03:33:51,700
I told you guys last week, I was like, man, when you really kind of just sit here and watch,

670
03:33:51,700 --> 03:34:00,469
you kind of go, they're just kind of hanging out. So this was a wasp and this wasp found this

671
03:34:00,469 --> 03:34:05,850
piece of shade here because I told you, it's been insanely hot. It has been a hundred plus 110

672
03:34:05,850 --> 03:34:16,680
degrees every single day. And this little, this little guy found the shade and slept.

673
03:34:16,680 --> 03:34:22,739
He literally is sleeping here. He's lying down in the shade. He found a little spot

674
03:34:22,739 --> 03:34:31,059
and it's just like, it is too hot, man. Yeah. He's actually like lying down,

675
03:34:31,059 --> 03:34:42,600
just staying out of the, out of the heat. Did he get up? Yeah. No, he's not dead.

676
03:34:42,600 --> 03:34:50,100
Nobody tell him. Nobody tell him he's dead. No, he got up and flew away like 20 minutes later.

677
03:34:50,100 --> 03:35:01,850
He's not dead. Nobody tell him. Nobody tell him. Nobody tell him. He got up and flew away

678
03:35:01,850 --> 03:35:06,329
literally 10 minutes later. It was like, oh, there he goes. Wow. He's, he's still alive.

679
03:35:06,329 --> 03:35:22,709
All right. He's not dead. Stop saying that. He's not dead. Oh yeah. What do you think about that?

680
03:35:26,940 --> 03:35:38,389
We got visited by all kinds of creatures, ladybugs, lacewings, bumblebees, honeybees.

681
03:35:38,389 --> 03:35:44,709
And these are awesome because these eat all the aphids. Something I never knew before doing

682
03:35:44,709 --> 03:35:53,819
plants and gardening, whatever. There is an entire group of animal that just spawns a hundred million

683
03:35:53,819 --> 03:36:01,860
times out of fucking nowhere and eats everything that is green. It doesn't even make any sense

684
03:36:01,860 --> 03:36:11,049
where they come from. Lacewings eat them. Ladybugs eat them. And it was actually pretty under

685
03:36:11,049 --> 03:36:18,139
control this year. I'm glad that the ecosystem kind of could do it. You should go outside and

686
03:36:18,139 --> 03:36:28,920
paint yourself green. Why? What are you? Time that, time that person out for like at least five

687
03:36:28,920 --> 03:36:36,860
minutes. Hey dude, can you go outside and paint yourself green? Like what? And pretend to be a

688
03:36:36,860 --> 03:36:50,440
flower? Ants farm them. Yeah. Ants want the, the delicious juice that they secrete. So ants will

689
03:36:50,440 --> 03:36:56,500
farm them. Ants will literally turn them into like these, they just produce this liquid that

690
03:36:56,500 --> 03:37:02,500
the ants want. So the ants bring them there on purpose and just turn them into bug fucking

691
03:37:02,500 --> 03:37:09,479
like workers. They essentially have like, it's like, it's like slavery. It's crazy. It's fucked up.

692
03:37:09,479 --> 03:37:17,450
They literally take these aphids and like make them, it's fucking crazy. It's actually insane.

693
03:37:17,450 --> 03:37:22,010
If you look into it, go watch or read like anything about how, what ants do to aphids.

694
03:37:22,010 --> 03:37:30,069
It's like, huh? What are you talking about? They'd, no, they don't do that. Yeah, they do.

695
03:37:30,069 --> 03:37:49,430
It's fucked up. Farmer ants, bug, the aphids get protection from the ants. I was under the impression

696
03:37:49,430 --> 03:37:53,190
that they kind of would just like, you go up there and do this and we're going to take your like food

697
03:37:53,190 --> 03:38:04,309
from you. It's like, it's kind of, it's kind of, is it mutually beneficial? It's kind of like cattle.

698
03:38:04,309 --> 03:38:15,450
It's like livestock. Yeah. Ants farm them. It's fucked up. Well, we're looking at a cute wasp

699
03:38:15,450 --> 03:38:26,170
sleeping on a leaf and a ladybug. Okay. Speaking of the other plants, these are, I showed you the,

700
03:38:26,170 --> 03:38:30,649
why didn't you, actually didn't even see them. This is a good one of the other marigolds. The

701
03:38:30,649 --> 03:38:36,729
marigold, everything was orange this year. These are marigolds. And the reason why these are here

702
03:38:36,729 --> 03:38:45,399
is because they help actually deter, which I know the book is kind of out on this, but according to

703
03:38:45,399 --> 03:38:51,850
some people, marigolds actually repel a lot of insects. They hate them. They don't like the way

704
03:38:51,850 --> 03:39:03,159
they smell. So this is a little popcorn marigold. Is that a good ground cover? Yeah. Do bugs use

705
03:39:03,159 --> 03:39:12,379
neti pots? Uh, I don't think so. But over here, look, look at that. Out of focus, but there's one

706
03:39:12,379 --> 03:39:18,600
of the, see how small they are? That's one of the dwarf sunflowers that you saw before. And you see

707
03:39:18,600 --> 03:39:26,120
one, two, three, remember in the very beginning? That's them. So we did end up pulling them out

708
03:39:26,120 --> 03:39:37,530
and putting them in individual pots and they were very happy. They did very well. There's also,

709
03:39:37,610 --> 03:39:49,100
there's like a couple more I want to show. Let me see. Oh, this one's cool. This is another one

710
03:39:49,100 --> 03:39:56,120
kind of like looking up at the, the big Hydra. The sense of scale is hard to show, but this thing is

711
03:39:56,120 --> 03:39:59,159
about 10 feet tall and no, I'm not going to stand next to it because I know a lot of people would

712
03:39:59,159 --> 03:40:13,180
just like shrink me and make me like four and a half feet tall. Let's show. Ooh, this one. Oh yeah.

713
03:40:13,180 --> 03:40:19,290
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Take a look at this one. Remember that hummingbird you saw earlier? Yep.

714
03:40:19,290 --> 03:40:28,420
Look at how, look at how majestic she is. Yeah. They, they were all, they were all about this.

715
03:40:28,420 --> 03:40:44,309
They're all over these and we'll show how many more do we have? I think I could show this one

716
03:40:44,309 --> 03:40:48,889
too. It's actually kind of cool just to see them closed. But for instance, this one here,

717
03:40:49,450 --> 03:41:00,629
now let me put this one back. Where did it go? Yeah. It's I'll put this one back up. It's so weird

718
03:41:00,629 --> 03:41:08,819
because before these open, it's almost like there's like magic going on in here because the,

719
03:41:08,819 --> 03:41:15,899
the head is closed. It just, it stays closed pretty tightly. And then just one day you can start to

720
03:41:15,899 --> 03:41:22,229
see color in there. And then a day or two later, the whole thing is open. It's so weird that it

721
03:41:22,229 --> 03:41:34,379
does that. And then a few weeks after this, it generates hundreds of seeds that you then can eat

722
03:41:34,379 --> 03:41:41,510
or just plant in the ground again. Plants are ridiculous. Nature is insane. How long from start

723
03:41:41,510 --> 03:41:49,989
to finish? Uh, the first picture is here. Like for instance, these ones here. This was, I want to say,

724
03:41:49,989 --> 03:41:56,860
because you're supposed to plant them a week or so after there is no chance of a frost because it

725
03:41:56,860 --> 03:42:05,559
it'll, it destroys them. So once you're past the last frost of the year, so sometimes that's like

726
03:42:06,200 --> 03:42:13,299
May, sometimes it's mid-May, early May, sometimes it's late May. It really depends on where you are.

727
03:42:13,940 --> 03:42:20,059
But for us, uh, it was pretty early in May. So this is probably, I want to say like a month

728
03:42:20,139 --> 03:42:26,180
and a half of growth. Maybe as of these photos, probably like a month, like four to six weeks,

729
03:42:26,180 --> 03:42:41,879
I want to say. Yeah. So May 6th is when we put them in the ground or May 9th, maybe. And then

730
03:42:41,879 --> 03:42:51,979
you're seeing these photos as of like a month or so later. Where are their faces? Well, yeah,

731
03:42:51,979 --> 03:42:55,899
that's what I mean. Like it's, it's so crazy that this thing, right? This like piece of fucking lettuce

732
03:42:56,459 --> 03:43:06,200
right here develops this on its head. That's just, it does like, that's so wild that this actually

733
03:43:06,200 --> 03:43:14,440
does this. Hey, well, I'm just, I mean, look at it. It kind of looks like a piece of romaine lettuce.

734
03:43:14,440 --> 03:43:22,940
And then just one day after getting a lot of nutrients and sun and water, it turns into this.

735
03:43:22,940 --> 03:43:36,229
Let me get that orange one back up. This thing was rocking for like a week or two straight.

736
03:43:36,229 --> 03:43:46,629
I think somebody said, would you, would you ever do vegetables? Vegetables kind of scare me

737
03:43:46,629 --> 03:44:00,020
because, well, I mean, sunflowers are technically food, technically. But the thing about vegetables

738
03:44:00,020 --> 03:44:07,620
that freaks me out is I almost feel like I would, I don't know. I feel like it's, am I watering them

739
03:44:07,620 --> 03:44:13,030
enough? Are they going to taste okay? What about the water? Is the water, am I using like, should I

740
03:44:13,030 --> 03:44:19,129
use like purified water? What if it's going to be like gross water in there? What's the pH of this

741
03:44:19,129 --> 03:44:28,069
water? I don't know. I feel like I'd freak out about it. You should grow tomatoes. What actually does

742
03:44:28,069 --> 03:44:33,139
well in Vegas? I always felt like that anything that wasn't something that needs to get scorched

743
03:44:33,139 --> 03:44:40,280
by the sun just can't really work out here. Sunflowers work out here. Would tomatoes work?

744
03:44:40,280 --> 03:44:58,010
I feel like tomatoes would just get burnt. Money trees? Well, money tree, can you eat a money tree?

745
03:44:58,010 --> 03:45:01,639
I feel like that's kind of weird. I don't think I'd want to eat a money tree. Isn't it supposed to,

746
03:45:01,639 --> 03:45:04,760
you're supposed to have it for like good luck. I feel like, I feel like eating it is getting,

747
03:45:04,760 --> 03:45:16,540
is bad luck. Dragon fruit, peppers, and, so, wait, dragon fruit would do well out here? Like, that

748
03:45:16,540 --> 03:45:28,489
sounds actually kind of fun. Holy shit, you can actually grow pumpkins. Really? It was just a

749
03:45:28,489 --> 03:45:42,709
joke. I didn't even know money trees were real. What? Succulents? I actually think, I think that

750
03:45:42,709 --> 03:45:49,590
would be, yeah, that'd be really, because, I mean, there's a lot of cactus out here, just naturally.

751
03:45:49,670 --> 03:45:57,940
It's kind of everywhere. Did you use fertilizer? Yeah, just the generic stuff. Just that, you know,

752
03:45:57,940 --> 03:46:03,940
the bag you get at Home Depot that has, you know, you can just sprinkle it in and rinse it in there.

753
03:46:03,940 --> 03:46:13,020
It's pretty, pretty basic stuff. Every two or three weeks, drop it in there. We only did it,

754
03:46:13,020 --> 03:46:22,010
I want to say, maybe three or four times total. So, every two weeks. Prickly pear? Oh, yeah.

755
03:46:22,010 --> 03:46:31,239
What the fuck is this stream? It's in the title. It literally says,

756
03:46:31,239 --> 03:46:34,120
Trey Pang 2 and Sunflower Podcast.

757
03:46:34,120 --> 03:46:54,790
Grow some peppermint. You should grow aloe for the skin care. That's true. Ban that guy. Nah,

758
03:46:54,790 --> 03:47:04,579
it's all right. Would you get some creatures for the garden? We get a lot of, they just kind of

759
03:47:04,579 --> 03:47:13,530
show up. Last time there was praying mantis, there were honey bees. If you have this stuff,

760
03:47:13,530 --> 03:47:21,799
they kind of just show up on their own. You don't really have to do very much. Just like,

761
03:47:21,799 --> 03:47:27,559
jump scared you, I'm sorry. Yeah, like sometimes, oh, you know, I need shade. I'm going to hang out

762
03:47:27,559 --> 03:47:44,709
here. Hummingbirds are so cool. Can I tell you, hummingbirds are my new favorite animal. They're

763
03:47:44,709 --> 03:47:54,280
just so interesting. I can't even describe how, let me just tell you, they're great. Hummingbird

764
03:47:54,280 --> 03:48:03,850
feeders. Do you have hummingbird feeders? I sure do. We sure do. They're, that's essentially what

765
03:48:03,850 --> 03:48:14,250
these are. They are hummingbird feeders. That's kind of one of the points to do it in the first

766
03:48:14,250 --> 03:48:30,870
place. But yeah, that's probably it. That's pretty much it. Got to go over a bunch of them.

767
03:48:30,870 --> 03:48:36,569
I think we, there's a, there's a few more that we have that are really big close-ups, especially

768
03:48:36,569 --> 03:48:44,569
after we harvested some of them. So we can show, if you want to see, hold on, did I show,

769
03:48:44,569 --> 03:48:52,540
I'll show this one too. So this one, oh no, we already saw that one. We already saw that one.

770
03:48:52,540 --> 03:49:03,159
Okay. This one looks, oh, this, this is a good one. Take a look at this one. So this is sort of how

771
03:49:03,159 --> 03:49:07,620
they were set near each other. You're wondering, just kind of in placement, like, wait, where's

772
03:49:07,620 --> 03:49:15,290
that orange one? So there's the Hydra and there's the orange one. And as you see, see the one in the

773
03:49:15,290 --> 03:49:22,760
middle on the right? That one is ready for harvest. You essentially, once they're ready,

774
03:49:22,760 --> 03:49:29,290
you snip off the head and there it is. And there's your seeds in there. You just kind of fish them

775
03:49:29,290 --> 03:49:41,659
out. Yeah, you can see the color difference now too, much better. That sort of sprinkled in orange

776
03:49:41,659 --> 03:49:54,899
brown on the right one, the one on the left is like fire orange. Do you cook them? No. For the

777
03:49:54,899 --> 03:50:02,979
most part, it's more of, I want to keep these because I want it. I want to plant these ones

778
03:50:02,979 --> 03:50:09,930
next year. So you kind of keep the family. Now there's hundreds of them. So yeah, you can,

779
03:50:09,930 --> 03:50:14,629
you could cook, you can toast them up and eat them if you really wanted to take them out of

780
03:50:14,629 --> 03:50:24,840
the shells, toast them up. Yeah. There you go. There's this, there are the sunflowers. There's

781
03:50:24,840 --> 03:50:35,239
your big fiery orange sunflower. And then the, the family of 11 heads, very, it was wild this year.

782
03:50:42,090 --> 03:50:51,239
You need to name them. The one on the left is Blaze and the one on the right is Cerberus.

783
03:50:51,239 --> 03:51:12,629
You don't think we've already gone over this? Many, many times. Where's Otto? He's right here.

784
03:51:12,629 --> 03:51:37,370
You didn't see? It's Otto. All right, that's going to wrap it up. Short stream today, but

785
03:51:37,370 --> 03:51:47,399
you know, there'll be a lot more of these. I had fun. It's a good day. The next time I see you,

786
03:51:47,399 --> 03:51:54,579
here is the plan. Sunday we are going to do Team Fortress 2. I got to say it again. Make sure you,

787
03:51:54,579 --> 03:51:58,709
you know, clear your ears out a little and go, wait, what did he just say? Team Fortress

788
03:51:58,709 --> 03:52:04,149
2 on Sunday. I'm going to play it for an hour or two. See how I like it. See if I'm getting into

789
03:52:04,149 --> 03:52:16,819
it again. And then after that, probably start viewfinder. Play that for a couple of hours.

790
03:52:16,819 --> 03:52:26,520
That's the plan for Sunday. Hey, botanist here. Ooh, hold on. Some fun info about sunflowers is

791
03:52:26,520 --> 03:52:34,819
each place that bears a seed is a singular flower. Each head houses hundreds of singular flowers,

792
03:52:34,819 --> 03:52:41,850
two different kinds too. Disk flowers and ray flowers. The middle flowers are the disk once,

793
03:52:42,409 --> 03:52:47,940
and the ones along the rim are ray flowers. Each ray flower has a huge petal. Yeah, they're all

794
03:52:47,940 --> 03:52:54,379
into that. That's wild. We've got botanists here. We have scientists here. We have doctors here. We

795
03:52:54,379 --> 03:53:07,909
have lawyers. Most educated community on earth, by the way, on earth, I said. All right. I'll see you

796
03:53:07,909 --> 03:53:12,469
guys later. Thanks for watching. See you Sunday. Probably starting around the same time, around

797
03:53:12,469 --> 03:53:24,780
three o'clock. Hope you enjoyed the sunflowers. It was about a month and a half to get them there.

798
03:53:24,780 --> 03:53:34,170
Marigolds, the wildflowers. They're still around too. I'll probably show a couple more pictures

799
03:53:34,170 --> 03:53:40,790
later because the wildflowers are still going strong. There's a few more heads that are going

800
03:53:40,790 --> 03:53:50,100
to open on the orange one. So maybe we'll do an update in another week or so. Yeah. See you guys

801
03:53:50,100 --> 03:53:55,610
on Sunday around three o'clock. Take care of yourselves. Thanks for hanging out. Trippang

802
03:53:55,610 --> 03:54:00,149
too is, I would think that's probably one of the most fun games I've played this year. You want a

803
03:54:00,149 --> 03:54:05,450
real assessment of that. That's probably up there in the top five games I've played this year. It

804
03:54:05,450 --> 03:54:11,799
was just very fun. You can challenge yourself like crazy in that game and it's really interesting.

805
03:54:11,799 --> 03:54:18,149
You can go as hard or as easy as you want. I thought it was great. I would say that it was

806
03:54:18,149 --> 03:54:30,069
very good. Dude, you've only played like six games. That's in the top five. What's the one

807
03:54:30,069 --> 03:54:36,969
game that came out this year that I played that I've really despised apparently? I don't know.

808
03:54:36,969 --> 03:54:46,549
What have I not mentioned? Gollum? Yeah, yeah, that's true. Diablo IV. Yeah, I didn't really

809
03:54:46,549 --> 03:54:52,520
talk about it, did I? No. Yeah, we don't need to get into it. We don't need to get, we don't

810
03:54:52,520 --> 03:54:56,459
need to get into it. You know what I'm saying? We don't need to get into it. I'll be here for

811
03:54:56,459 --> 03:55:00,409
another six hours. We're not going to get into it. I'll be here for six more hours.

812
03:55:09,780 --> 03:55:18,500
Get into it. I'll see you Sunday. Maybe one day I'll get into it. When are you going to

813
03:55:18,500 --> 03:55:28,489
do the browser game and quiz stream? That's true. We do need to do that. We'll do it soon.

814
03:55:28,489 --> 03:55:40,629
Sorcery part four also as well. Dude, start ranting now. No, we just showed off all the

815
03:55:40,629 --> 03:55:47,000
sunflowers. I'm in a really good mood. I don't want to get into it because then I'll get all

816
03:55:47,000 --> 03:55:53,799
hot. The room will heat up. I'll have to go get a bunch of water and I'll be pacing back and forth

817
03:55:53,799 --> 03:56:01,420
for the next hour off stream thinking about it. I got it. Yeah, I got to log off. Let's log off

818
03:56:01,420 --> 03:56:12,649
for a little while. Hey, say happy birthday to my cat Goober. He turned one today. Happy birthday,

819
03:56:12,649 --> 03:56:21,780
Goober the cat. All right. I'll see you guys Sunday. Take care of yourselves. Call your mother,

820
03:56:21,780 --> 03:56:28,180
call your father. Hey, do something nice for yourself today. Do something nice for yourself

821
03:56:28,180 --> 03:56:41,989
today. You understand? Hey, do something nice for yourself today. See you guys later. Take care.

822
03:56:42,069 --> 03:57:34,299
See you Sunday. Have a great one. I'm also going to wait till four hours so it looks much better on

823
03:57:34,299 --> 03:57:41,959
paper. You know how it is. It just like, you know, four hours looks just on paper looks a lot better.

824
03:57:42,680 --> 03:57:48,620
I got just enough time to talk about D4 and I get it out in two minutes.

825
03:57:50,340 --> 03:57:53,879
All right, let's get into it. I'm gonna get into it. I got two minutes.

826
03:57:56,489 --> 03:58:06,500
I can't get it. I can't get into it. I can't get into it. It's like a whole, I have like a whole,

827
03:58:06,500 --> 03:58:11,290
I'm like just a whole thing about like modern video games and how it's almost like things are

828
03:58:11,290 --> 03:58:17,930
being they're not being made. No, I can't get into it. We have two minutes. I actually can't

829
03:58:17,930 --> 03:58:32,200
get into it. I just picking up Saigon's boots fucking eight times and that's the only item that

830
03:58:32,200 --> 03:58:36,729
you that drops something going on there. That's true. You know what I mean? Or like, you know,

831
03:58:36,729 --> 03:58:42,170
distant enemies are stunned for four seconds for the 15th time as an aspect. I just don't like this.

832
03:58:42,170 --> 03:58:45,770
That doesn't do it for me at all. That just doesn't do it for me at all. This doesn't do it

833
03:58:45,770 --> 03:58:59,459
for me at all. Go off. Go off. Log off. I'm going off. I'm going off. All right.

834
03:59:01,479 --> 03:59:06,440
Holy shit, dude. Wow. Super hot take. Oh, wow, dude. Did you hear that?

835
03:59:06,440 --> 03:59:13,479
No way. Nobody else has that take. Only German says that. Whoa, dude. He's so brave for giving

836
03:59:13,479 --> 03:59:19,879
his take on D4. Dude, no one else has said this. Not like six or seven million people that have all

837
03:59:19,879 --> 03:59:27,510
said that exact same thing. Dude, you are. You are. Whoa. You are a visionary, by the way.

838
03:59:28,309 --> 03:59:55,260
We're almost at four hours. We're good. These are CCO takes. I like how Diablo one just had a sword.

839
03:59:57,530 --> 04:00:00,729
It just it just I don't know. I just feel like I was like working.

840
04:00:02,649 --> 04:00:06,489
Does that make sense? I feel like I was like working when I was playing. It's like I was at

841
04:00:06,489 --> 04:00:15,940
I was like working. I was at work. I would go to work and then I would just salvage my entire

842
04:00:15,940 --> 04:00:32,170
inventory. He missed it. Oh, because the foot. No, it's fine. We're at overtime. Yeah, we're good.

843
04:00:32,170 --> 04:00:41,879
I can hit 420. No, I can't. I can hit. Let's try for four, one, four, one, two, three. OK,

844
04:00:41,879 --> 04:01:01,670
we're going to do four, one, two, three. No, not four, one, two, three, four. Yeah. See you Sunday.

845
04:01:03,430 --> 04:01:16,979
All right, here comes four, one, two, three. See if I can get it. Take care.
