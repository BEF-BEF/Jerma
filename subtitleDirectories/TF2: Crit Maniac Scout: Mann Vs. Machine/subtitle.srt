00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,130
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,129
Gonna be covering something on the Man vs. Machine update, something that I've been having a lot of fun with the last couple of hours.

3
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:22,629
And I had to just make a video on it because it is just so goofy.

4
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:26,629
It is a certain particular setup you're going to run with as the scout.

5
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:33,500
The choice of Scattergun is not really the big issue here. What is the issue is making sure you have the sun on a stick.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,500
The Bonk Atomic Punch, I was just doing some testing with it, so that is not anything to be concerned with.

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,000
Just the sun on a stick, and I guess the Baby Faces Blaster will talk about that.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,679
If you saw on the previous screen, I had the movement speed increased. I had it by 20% at that time.

9
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:56,679
I tried to get it to 30% to negate the downside of the Baby Faces Blaster. As we all know, it makes you slow down by 35%.

10
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:03,179
So having that enabled, you will negate the minus 35%. Well, you're still gonna have minus 5% movement speed.

11
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,680
But you'll move around somewhat normally as a scout with the Blaster.

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,109
But the reason why you have this thing on is to get the crazy, crazy running speed to use the sun on a stick.

13
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:19,609
Now, I need to be very clear about this. You can only do this setup if there is a Pyro on the team.

14
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:27,109
If there is no Pyro on the team, then you're sort of wasting a melee slot and wasting precious upgrades and money as well.

15
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:31,780
But if there is a Pyro on the team and you want to try this, I absolutely recommend you do this.

16
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:40,780
So what you are going to do is you're gonna pick the sun on a stick, go over to its upgrade center, and just jack up its swing speed.

17
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,959
And as you see here, I am swinging so fast right now, I don't even know how fast this is going.

18
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,459
And like I said, if there's a Pyro on the team, here's part two.

19
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:55,459
Once he lights people on fire, and as you know in this game mode, people bunch up really, really crazily.

20
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:06,459
These robots come in big, huge waves. So if they're all on fire, you use the movement speed from the Baby Faces Blaster and you just start smashing people.

21
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,259
Now, this is incredibly effective in two very specific ways.

22
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,259
The number one way is if you buy an Uber Canteen. That's one of the big, big things.

23
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:22,759
If you have a couple of Uber Canteens on you, wait till the Pyro lights one of these big, giant heavies or big, giant soldiers on fire.

24
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:29,759
Use the Uber Canteen and just sit there swinging away, critting the absolute crap out of somebody.

25
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:35,259
It is so fun, it is so goofy, and you actually are going to be doing a pretty substantial amount of damage to somebody.

26
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:39,259
It does about 240 damage a second when this is all utilized.

27
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:45,759
But the second reason why you use this thing is if your team is really pushed back and you're at the final little defense there,

28
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,259
and everyone's all scared and everyone's all bunched together,

29
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,759
because you can just kneel down like you're seeing me do on the screen, swinging wildly.

30
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:55,759
And if people get lit on fire, they're just going to come in and insta-die.

31
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,259
It is a great last resort. It's a great way to find yourself.

32
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:03,259
Just, don't kill me, don't kill me, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, quick, quick, quick, quick.

33
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,939
It's awesome. It's a lot of fun.

34
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:10,439
And that's the really cool thing about this mode. This is what excited me when I first saw all these upgrades, all these things.

35
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,939
There is a lot of different options here, guys. People are going to find just crazy things.

36
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,939
Oh, you know, what if you use the direct hit, the Righteous Bison, and the shovel?

37
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,439
There's a lot of cool things people are going to come up with.

38
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,439
I was actually talking to Boo about a certain thing he wanted to try, which is the Crusader's Crossbow.

39
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,939
Just max out the attack speed, max out all the stuff on it.

40
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:36,439
So it's just a rapid fire heal hurt gun. And it's just, that's the stuff I love.

41
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,439
I love having those kind of conversations with people, love hearing about different cool setups and stuff.

42
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,439
So in the comments section of this video, leave me an interesting setup,

43
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,939
whether it's certain amount of attack speed, certain amount of buffs, just leave me a cool setup.

44
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:53,439
I want to see what you guys have to say. Maybe I will try some of them out as the time goes on here.

45
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,810
And speaking of items and speaking of character customization and all that jazz,

46
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,810
I want to bring up in the last video I said that you can upgrade every single item in the game, and that is just not true.

47
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,310
There is actually a few items that you cannot upgrade, but most of the items you can.

48
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,310
Just wanted to clarify that for you guys, and that's going to wrap up the video.

49
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,310
So thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

50
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,310
And I will see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
