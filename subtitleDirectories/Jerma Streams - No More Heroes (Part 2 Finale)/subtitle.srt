00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:10,710
Hello. Good afternoon, everybody. Just realized that my Wiimote doesn't have a strap.

2
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:24,039
Physically, it doesn't. I don't have one. Why? Where did it go? I gotta be careful. Don't want

3
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:36,859
to put a hole in my monitor's head. He's not using protection. Unsafe? That's unsafe. It's not that

4
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:42,539
unsafe. As long as you don't play a game that requires you to, like, throw or move really

5
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:51,700
quickly. And the only movements in No More Heroes are you just shake. You know, I, if, do you need

6
00:00:51,700 --> 00:01:03,609
a strap for a salt shaker or a pepper shaker? No. That'd be kind of odd. That's the same motion

7
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:11,000
that I'm doing in this game. Anyways, we're going to continue No More Heroes. We're probably going

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,500
to get to the end tonight. Pepper shakers have a thick base. This is, like, as heavy as a pepper

9
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:28,700
shaker is. We are currently rank six assassin level. Climb in the ladder. And then tomorrow

10
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:37,689
is New Year's Eve. Tomorrow, we'll be doing a little bit of festivities. We'll be dropping

11
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:47,459
the ball Eastern time, not Pacific time. Remember, that's important. It's gonna be weird, though. I

12
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:54,900
think I did this last year, too. It was, like, 8.59 p.m. And I'm like, here we go, Ted! No, it's, like,

13
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:09,419
it's 9 o'clock, where I am. But we'll do that tomorrow. He's gonna drop his balls. I knew that

14
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:16,740
I was gonna show up somewhere. I just didn't know when. Do a countdown for every time zone in the

15
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:28,819
world. I'm not doing that. Winks are scams. Purple gang, rise up. Well, you just dropped 1200

16
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:34,469
channel points. You could have saved to get to 75,000 and got me to turn my camera on and wink.

17
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,610
That's too bad. All right, let's get going. Let me just give me one second. I'll be

18
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,860
here. I'll be here. I'm just moving something around. Maybe one second.

19
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,719
Yeah, that's true. Somebody just mentioned. When is the first New Year?

20
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:25,259
Australia? When is the first 2020? Somewhere in Australia? New Zealand? It's in New Zealand. All

21
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:33,900
right. So when? When? Or, like, I mean, like, relative to, like, hours from now, when is it

22
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:50,090
2020 for the first place? First time? It already happened. No, it didn't. New Year's is first

23
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:59,189
celebrated on the small island nations of Tonga. Okay. Well, happy. When is it? Let's see. I'm

24
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:08,419
gonna say, I'm gonna look up what time is it in Tonga right now. Tonga time. It is 102 p.m. Yeah,

25
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:17,110
it's 1 p.m. December 31st. Okay. We might be live when the first ever 2020 happens. It might be

26
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:24,459
possible. No, we won't. I'm not gonna be live in 12 hours. What the fuck am I talking about?

27
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:33,379
Oh, yeah, we're gonna be live in 12 hours. No way. That's not happening. It ain't gonna take

28
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:42,790
me that long to finish. No more heroes. Maybe six to seven. All right. Welcome back. Let's play with

29
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,589
Kat. Those of you that weren't here yesterday, this is the most important thing in the game.

30
00:04:46,389 --> 00:05:05,939
Hold on. This is a one-guy scenario. I need to read this. Jerma, how do you describe a streamer

31
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:18,600
to someone who doesn't understand anything about the internet? Um, it was like four in a row.

32
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,139
Okay, I feel like I'm playing Battlefield right now. What the fuck was that?

33
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:43,430
So, uh, what are you doing? What? Wait a minute. Wait, hold on. Dude, um, Freddy,

34
00:05:44,149 --> 00:06:03,850
Freddy, you gave 23,000 bits last night, and now you've dropped 75,000 bits right now. That's

35
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:16,579
a fucking hundred thousand bits in not even 12, 24 hours. You madman. Holy shit. That's a

36
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:29,829
thousand dollars in bits. Funding for the 2020 carnival. Freddy dreads. Seriously. Holy fuck,

37
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:34,470
man. That's ridiculous. They say, happy new year's Jerma. Thank you for making this year

38
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:45,779
hilarious for me. Freddy dread gaming. Holy shit, man. That's, all right, so that was so

39
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,100
ridiculous. This is fucking crazy right now. Somebody just said that wasn't even a car,

40
00:06:50,100 --> 00:07:01,990
that was a weed whacker. Um, thank you. Seriously, uh, Shazzo just dropped 20 community subs

41
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:10,970
also. That was a tiny car, huge bits. Uh, Shazzo 20 community subs and fucking Freddy with,

42
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,610
that's, I think that's one of the biggest drops of money I've ever seen on stream ever in one drop.

43
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,649
We've had during the thing was another scenario where there was like five, six, seven hundred

44
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:31,019
dollars worth of bits that would drop. It's fucking, this is unbelievable. Thank you. Happy

45
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:44,360
new year to you as well. Let's hope 2020 is, um, interesting as well. That's a lot of money. That

46
00:07:44,360 --> 00:08:12,279
deserves a wink. You know what? It sure does. What was that frame? What was that? I think that was,

47
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:23,240
that was, that wasn't, I wasn't naked. Hey, I can't wink. I know you just, that's, thank you.

48
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:44,019
75,000 bits equals 75,000 channel points. Give me my bike. Can somebody, was you in a tank top

49
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:50,169
looking at the camera? Can you clip that? Somebody show me what, I want to see like when that was.

50
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:55,860
Was that from yesterday? No, it couldn't have been. Oh, I know what it was. I know what it was.

51
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:05,460
I know what it was. Oh, fucking God damn it. Uh, okay. So I'm going to let me explain what happened.

52
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:12,580
Okay. This is very important. Um, that was from earlier today. That was, look at the hair. I'll

53
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:24,629
get it on stream. That was, uh, so earlier this day I got, I got out of the shower

54
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,789
and I said, Oh, okay. It's time. Let me set up my stream. Let me get like started here. Sounds good.

55
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,200
And I turned on the cam. I was setting the camera up and I realized, uh, I'm wearing the same shirt

56
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:52,139
that I was wearing yesterday, the same tank top. So I, um, I was like, people are going to talk shit

57
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,580
about this. They're going to be like, Oh, you in the same clothes as yesterday. And I'm just like,

58
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:03,340
yeah, uh, I have to tie hats. I just, I took off my shirt and put on another shirt.

59
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:15,299
That's what happened. But I got exposed anyways. So there you go. What the fuck is going on with

60
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:25,850
70? What the 75? What is happening today? Oh, God damn it. No, no, not God damn like

61
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:41,690
75. People are finding ways to circumvent that. All right. Uh, core monster. That's 75 subs.

62
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:55,259
You maniac. Holy shit. That is an unfucking believable guys. That's, that's too much money.

63
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:12,440
75 fucking subs from core monster right now. And 75,000 bits from Freddy. You guys are too,

64
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:20,340
you guys are too kind. You guys spoil me. I'm just going to spend it on McChickens.

65
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:32,779
That's going to buy a lot of pizzas. Well, it's, it's, I can't even believe it. I'm forever fucking

66
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:43,450
grateful that somebody would give this much money to this room. And, uh, hopefully, hopefully all

67
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:51,049
the money that comes into this channel, I can use it and try to make stuff that I think would be

68
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:55,529
interesting. That's pretty much what it is. Pay to link streamer.

69
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:04,620
Laugh my ass off. You call yourself a Jerma fan. I'm fucking loaded on channel points, bro.

70
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:19,080
Every message could wait one. Where is this by the way? All this for, uh, all this for a thousand

71
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:26,009
dollars. It's not even worth it. Try talking to chat again when you're a true fan. I highlight

72
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:36,379
every message because I just that jacked. Oh, I see. But yeah, that was a big,

73
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:46,870
huge money drops from a few people here. Um, hopefully I can get this stupid thing out of

74
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:54,600
the ground. Where? All right. Seriously, where is it? Why was my thing rumbling over there? What?

75
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:14,840
Holy shit. Freddy just gave 50. Is that person naked? Freddy just gave 50 community subs.

76
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:25,129
Wait there. What are they? Fuck their tier two. These are tier two. What the fuck is going on?

77
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:46,519
Holy shit. That's insane. 50 tier two community subs from Freddy.

78
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:58,100
Freddy Dread. You've got to be kidding me. I had a dream last night that Jerma literally. What?

79
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:11,190
What are you talking about? Or I have to. Why was that just in there? Why was that just in the part

80
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:29,929
of it? Like the chat. Why was that just in the chat? Oh, anyways, holy fuck, man. That's,

81
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:37,190
that's insane. Tier two. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. That's Freddy Dread. Thank

82
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:43,669
you, Freddy. Thank you. Evil program. Five subs. Collie Brady. Five subs. I had a dream. What was

83
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:58,629
it? I didn't. I didn't. Okay. I didn't like chill. I need to see. What the fuck? Go gaming. I had a

84
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:22,200
dream. What was it? Just somebody PM it to me. Don't PM me. I had a dream last night. Everyone was

85
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:41,320
cheering. That's so funny to me. Everyone was screaming TOS or cheering. What the fuck?

86
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:55,139
We didn't even start. I haven't even started streaming yet. Oh my God. Evil program. Five subs.

87
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:11,399
Collie Brady. Five subs. Produce. Produce. Imagine having that dream though. Like I can't imagine

88
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:22,179
having a dream like that. Produces. All right. Get it together. Produces. Produces. San. Thanks

89
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:32,659
for the five subs. Slonk. CR. Thanks for the five subs. Seriously, guys. Henry1810 gave five subs.

90
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:45,929
Jesus. I had a dream. Oh my God. I can imagine waking up from that dream. I think that's one

91
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:50,570
of those dreams where you wake up afterward. After you, you look in the mirror and you just go like

92
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:58,009
why did I have that dream? Why did I have that dream? There's gotta be something. Like there's

93
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:16,150
gotta be a reason why I'm having a dream like that. Oh my God. He watches too much. Yeah but

94
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,069
all right. There's a difference between watching too much and then having a dream that I'm having

95
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:26,470
sex with somebody on stream. Why was the camera on? What are you having that dream for?

96
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:51,240
Dude, this is fucked. I have to just do this mission. Oh. This is killing me.

97
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:04,220
This is killing. I don't know why this is killing me. I don't. Okay. I know this is gonna sound

98
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,299
crazy because it's gonna be fucked. Just like. All right. Just mute if you. Oh but seriously.

99
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:13,579
Like I just picture. I just like. Oh you know like images that like you just. Like I just see the

100
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:21,099
chat and like the screen. Like it's. We're screen grabbing somebody's web browser and it's just

101
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:26,059
that's on the video player and there's a chat next to it and it's like all my like rules are underneath.

102
00:18:33,980 --> 00:19:04,380
What is this one? What was this one? I don't even remember. Oh this one. Sometimes it seriously only

103
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,059
takes one thing that somebody says over here and it just fucks me up for the whole day.

104
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:14,299
I'm gonna be thinking about that all day. It's gonna pop up into my brain. I'm just. I'm a very

105
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:21,019
visual person. You know what I'm saying? Like I'm incredibly visual and I like. I will see the things

106
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:36,009
that people say up in my head and I'm gonna keep seeing that until tomorrow. Until it happens.

107
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:44,089
Okay I gotta relax.

108
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:51,299
Jesus Christ. We're good.

109
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:02,329
A lot of money from this one. Welcome back by the way to this is no more heroes.

110
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,970
It's been 20 minutes on stream. What the fuck has happened?

111
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:29,049
Is that it? One more. Did I get it? I didn't even see that. The video on the ground.

112
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,490
You got like a thousand dollars and then laughed at sex for 10 minutes. That's what's happened.

113
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:54,089
Yeah that about sums it up. You're right. That's pretty good recap. Oh there's a new job. There's

114
00:20:54,089 --> 00:21:04,680
a new job. Can I still vote in the poll? Yes you can. If we can get the poll in the chat please.

115
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,160
Check it out. You have until tomorrow afternoon to vote.

116
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:23,339
Germa NYE 19 on Serbian Monkey. That's the one. What's the new job? Mine sweeping. Oh this is not

117
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:28,059
the scorpions yet. Clean up the mines buried in the beach. A bonus will be paid due to how

118
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:39,769
dangerous the work is. We're looking for high voter participation. Actually I think I can look

119
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:50,099
and see how many people have taken it so far. And like six cars drove by. A weed whacker drove by.

120
00:21:50,099 --> 00:22:07,450
Like a bicycle. Like that was a weird first 10 minutes. Where do you vote on that survey monkey

121
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:22,630
page? Should be in the chat right now. Down to the beach. Let's do some mine sweeping. How much money

122
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:35,500
do we need? 350. The unspoken rules of Santa Destroy indicate danger. No one swims on the

123
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,460
beach here. There are military mines buried in the sand after all. The army used the beach for

124
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,339
testing out new maneuvers. You won't see any girls in bikinis and you'll need a metal detector to

125
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:50,779
avoid getting serious sunburn. What else would you expect in this place? No tourists. No sunbathe.

126
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:57,670
There's no logic. The god of landmines hates metal detectors. So work persistently. How does

127
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:06,329
this work? Safely remove the mines buried in the beach. Listen to your metal detector to locate

128
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:11,930
them. Then use your beam katana to destroy the mines. Do I need my the Wiimote thing?

129
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,769
Oh this. Where is it?

130
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:32,309
Where the hell is it? Oh it's it that's when I get when I get close enough.

131
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:57,400
I'm like insane. I'm insane. That scared the fuck out of me. That actually scared the shit out of

132
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:10,839
me. Jesus. Wow. He's a bad gamer. He's a bad gamer. He's not a very good gamer. He's a bad gamer.

133
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:38,650
I could change clothes too. Well where is it? How much are these worth? Because I only have three.

134
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:58,059
Holy shit. It's right here. It's two thousand per mine. That sucks. I have to pick up trash.

135
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:12,099
We gotta do each one once though. At close. Where is it?

136
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:19,190
What just happened? Boomer. Boomer. Boomer. He's a boomer.

137
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,460
It's gonna be 20,000. I'm gonna I'm gonna get a horrible grade.

138
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:38,950
This might be the first non-placing grade of the whole entire gameplay. This is not going to even

139
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:59,130
be bronze. I might not even place. You can't get below bronze? Really? Yeah this one kind of sucks.

140
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:03,140
I don't remember this one. Let me get 10. Let me get a clean 10.

141
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:10,339
Come on. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Come on. Come on. Come on. Just step on it.

142
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:23,079
Just step on it. Step on it. Step on it. T.O.S. What the fuck. T.O.S. dude. Yeah that one sucks.

143
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:34,259
20,000. Gold medal. I could pick up trash and make 60. Got another job for you. Something a little

144
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:48,859
shadier. Okay I just unlocked another assassin mission. Uh noodle is bad at gaming is the one

145
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:53,670
that had the dream. They said hey Jeremy glad I could make you laugh with that remark about my

146
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:58,630
dream. Laughing my ass off. I must say it had me pretty fucked up in the morning. Happy new year I

147
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:06,630
guess. I'm just happy that I was the one guy. Happy new. Happy new year I guess. Oh that means

148
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:18,980
it was hilarious. That was like a really funny thing to read. It was just outrageous. I guess.

149
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,420
Not eligible for funniest one guy moment unfortunately. Unfortunately.

150
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,779
Kill as many as you can within the time. Mission ends so just kill as many as you can.

151
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:59,269
3,000 per kill. I'll try it. It's at the beach. 2019 snub. You said how you're not going to get

152
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:03,910
this image out of your head until tomorrow. Try to imagine what it's like for them. They can't ever

153
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:26,359
watch a German stream the same way ever again. Uh this community is fucking hilarious. Sometimes

154
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:30,599
people think I'm like fucking I'm like kidding around when I say that or I'm like making it up.

155
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:43,500
There's just like so many things. Your viewers are fucked. I don't I don't know about that.

156
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:55,619
Jeremiah had 7.5k points. Please wink. No I'm sorry. That's not how it works.

157
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,750
I was hoping to like GTA style. Hit that and fly over into the beach.

158
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:14,809
But there's an invisible wall. I have 12k. Can you wink for me? Does it cost 12k or does it cost 75k?

159
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:33,380
Which one? He thinks this game is as good as GTA. Where's the entry here? Is it up? What?

160
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:41,779
Will you wink at 70 at the 75,000 bit guy's wedding?

161
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:54,980
I could have just. All right let's make some money. Let's make some fake money in game.

162
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:05,400
Kill as many as possible. Let's go. Do you guys all have guns?

163
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:14,839
There he is. Come on. My weapon's not good enough.

164
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:27,700
Let's bring it together. Was it 3,000 per kill? Already better than looking at the mines.

165
00:30:28,819 --> 00:31:02,740
What Star Wars game is this? I don't know. We talked about that yesterday. Did I fight

166
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:12,980
Holly Summers yet? I did. That's the last thing I did last night. Hey.

167
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:38,650
Oh, the best thing in this game is when you get like seven people to stand in a row and you do the

168
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:58,579
side swipe and you hit every single one. It's so satisfying. I only have one person left.

169
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:12,839
That's it. 20? Nuts or chocolate? Nuts or chocolate? What do you mean nuts or chocolate?

170
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:28,650
Why do I have to pick? That's a lot of money. Why do I have to pick? You have to pick. I mean

171
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:33,220
nuts are healthier than chocolate, but I think chocolate's better than nuts. But you can't,

172
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,700
you know what I mean? Like I think chocolate is better than a nut, but nuts are healthier,

173
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:59,910
so I'd rather eat nuts more than I would eat chocolate. What? What? What's wrong with that?

174
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:13,369
No, all I'm saying is, all I'm saying is that chocolate is good. I like chocolate.

175
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:19,509
I like to eat chocolate, but chocolate doesn't, you don't have to eat chocolate every single day.

176
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:27,480
Okay? Nuts are healthy, but the thing about nuts is they can be a little salty. You know what I'm

177
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,900
saying? Nuts can be too salty. Too much so that you don't want to eat them. Chocolate is sweeter.

178
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:42,099
It's a little tastier, but I don't know. It depends. Actually, some restaurants do it better

179
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:47,849
than others. Chocolate from one restaurant versus chocolate from another restaurant. What I'm saying

180
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:56,309
is like what you like. I just fucking, I just, I just fucking hit a pulp. God damn it, guys.

181
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:29,179
In my defense, I simply just looked up car crash sound, like car, and I found this video,

182
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:32,460
and it's like car crash, and it's got, this thing's got fucking 1.6 million views,

183
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:38,789
and I'm sitting there waiting for the car crash sound to play, and it took 24 seconds to go by.

184
00:34:39,590 --> 00:35:02,760
That's not, that sounded like a firework. Oh shit, my wee.

185
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:17,780
No, not my center bar. I didn't have my strap.

186
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:36,760
Fuck. Okay, let's go. Let's go. I have to play. I'm all twisted up right now. I'm,

187
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:56,780
I'm twisted up. I'm him. I'm twisted up today. I'm very twisted. Let's get a new,

188
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:19,000
let's get some new sunglasses. Okay. Black, pink, pink. Yeah. Get the Guy Fieri shades.

189
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:39,030
We'll do pink. Guy Fieri doesn't have pink shades. Ooh, ooh, I like that one.

190
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:48,789
The cobra? No, that's a, it's a lion. That's a cobra. I mean, that's very clearly a lion,

191
00:36:48,789 --> 00:37:09,670
but look at that cobra face. This is too much money. Ooh, I actually like that look. Black and

192
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:28,570
white. Black and white with pink shades. I would wear this out. Wouldn't wear these out. Ooh,

193
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,639
this matches. But there's, boy, there's a hamburger one.

194
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:01,719
I love chainsaws. You say psycho, like it's a bad thing. Yep. That's the one. No, not yet.

195
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:18,650
Give me that one. I got, I gotta get the one that's hung up in every single college dormitory.

196
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:25,670
Like on the wall. It's like beer cans and shit all over the place. Oh yeah. What's that on the

197
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:38,679
wall? What's that plaque over there? That's good. Matches the shades. What about jeans? New pants?

198
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:08,570
Now, where the black jeans? Right there. I love a good pair of black jeans. They go with everything.

199
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:17,340
I'll keep my, no, these ones are ugly. I'm spending all my money. No, actually, I don't like these

200
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:43,019
jeans. Get them off. I mean, this looks bad, but who cares? All right. That's, I do, I do like the,

201
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:46,780
the rocket popsicle. That's what that is. What is it? Is it America or popsicle?

202
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,539
By the way, you can't, where do you get those now? You can't buy those anymore.

203
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:09,829
Colgate. Now I see rocket popsicle. Yeah, Colgate too. Yeah. These are at the dollar store.

204
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:28,869
Wow. You're a clown. Let's get a good look. It's not bad. Although I just spent all my money.

205
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,639
Let's do another assassin mission. Let, no, let me see if I can do some of these because look,

206
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:40,550
it's been 20, I can, I can do some of these, uh, free missions. We don't get hit. Go to the beer

207
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:49,849
icon. You got it. Dude, does German, is German one of those people that looks at chat? You got it.

208
00:40:49,849 --> 00:41:11,929
I'm going in right now. I think I do have seven, a ball in return. Let me teach you something.

209
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:20,300
Select the technique that you want. Ooh. Memory of three displays the position of enemies on

210
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:29,190
the mini map. That's pretty good. Allows a jumping slash to be performed

211
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:45,300
by shaking the nunchuck. Also pretty good. Allow a dash to be performed by pressing B button.

212
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:59,780
I think I want that one. Memory of woman extends dark side mode. Time limit. All right. That's not

213
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:09,849
bad, but I, these are all increases the range of your grab. That's good too. Earn bonuses based

214
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:20,679
on your rank. What does that mean? Allows a jumping down attack. I'm going to do the dash.

215
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:27,690
This one I can dash with B. I feel like that's like a bloodborne dash, right?

216
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:32,469
Technically, or is it a sprint? We'll find out.

217
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:55,610
Learn the technique of Czar. You got that? I'm back. I'm really tired of the pre-recorded streams

218
00:42:55,610 --> 00:43:00,179
lately. Honestly, I mean, appreciate the effort, but it's just sad. I'm really tired about the

219
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:14,139
pre-recorded streams lately. I mean, I appreciate the effort, but it's just sad. Planted message.

220
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:30,699
Time for a, where is it? Let's do this one. Literally no one said that. Yes, they did.

221
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:51,639
Look at the logs. Let me take a look at his list. Which one of these haven't I done?

222
00:43:52,650 --> 00:44:03,739
Bronze on this one, but it's only 30k. So silver, silver, gold, nothing in the time limit. Okay.

223
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:13,480
90,000 kill 100 enemies mission. How long will this take though? I feel like it's going to take

224
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:28,650
too long. Going to bat. I'll do this one. 5,500 per kill. I'm here for the VOD chat.

225
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:50,840
Didn't they get rid of that? Doesn't exist anymore? Doesn't. The thing about VOD chat though,

226
00:44:54,809 --> 00:45:00,599
why would they get rid of it? I mean, I get, was it, were they trying to like save

227
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:13,349
data or something? Why would you have it? Yeah, I mean, I guess it's one of those things where

228
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:19,460
it's, it's just, there's no reason to get rid of it and there's no reason to have it. Right?

229
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:30,840
It's weird. Core Monster just came in with another huge money drop. Core Monster,

230
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:43,690
I have to hunt 10,000 bits from Core Monster. Another 100 fucking dollars. In bits, 10,000 drop

231
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:51,019
on top of the other stuff. Thank you Core Monster for your insane contributions. It's true that this

232
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:57,750
is a pre-recorded stream because these are pre-recorded bits. Now that would be very

233
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:08,360
interesting. That would be very interesting. How did I miss that? Fuck, I don't want to mess this

234
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:17,159
up. I have to get away. One more, one more, one more, one more. Give me, give me, give me one more.

235
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:33,050
Oh, pre-recorded stream, pre-recorded bits. How would you pre-record bits? You would have to,

236
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:37,050
you would have to sit here. That'd be really hard to do because you would have to sit here

237
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:44,170
the whole time and then wait for this exact moment where I'm about to address your bits

238
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,449
and time it correctly so I don't do it too early or too late.

239
00:46:50,409 --> 00:47:01,019
Hmm, would be interesting. What do I got for money? 330, I need, uh, we'll do, we'll do one more trash

240
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:12,949
pickup or I'll try to get one of the, uh, you are late in addressing bits half the time. Still have

241
00:47:12,949 --> 00:47:42,389
to get it close. Look at that one. LOL, he killed that guy. Don't take a single hit. This one's hard

242
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:46,070
because you have this one area and there's a shitload of people. You just have to, you gotta get

243
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,829
kind of lucky actually. Let's try this. I'm gonna go for this.

244
00:47:54,519 --> 00:48:12,039
Oh, I don't have any battery. How am I gonna do this? I don't have any battery.

245
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:40,170
The dash? Oh, it is a run. It's a sprint. Oh, it's a sprint. It's a sprint. It's a sprint.

246
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:49,219
It's a sprint. It's a sprint. I thought it was like a hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, like a dodge,

247
00:48:49,219 --> 00:49:09,539
like better than a better dodge. It's a sprint. All right, gold, gold, gold. I got gold on

248
00:49:09,539 --> 00:49:15,460
everything. What's, what is the most money? Ponpon. Probably garbage, right? And plus I can sprint.

249
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,460
Yeah, let me do garbage collector.

250
00:49:23,289 --> 00:49:30,539
Super frog. How can you not like it? Don't forget the new sword too. Yeah, I know. And I have to

251
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:39,460
train. There's a lot to do. I don't even need the motorcycle anymore, do I? Is this faster? Is this

252
00:49:39,460 --> 00:50:02,889
as fast as the motorcycle? It might be. Bike is faster? All right, yeah it is. When am I gonna

253
00:50:02,889 --> 00:50:13,619
get Jerma's super frog? There already is Jerma's super frog. It's a BTTV emote.

254
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,860
I know that song by heart.

255
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:52,329
Why is the bike so big? It just is. This actually might go smoother.

256
00:50:53,130 --> 00:51:01,500
Can I sprint with the thing on my back? Find out. Jerma uses BTTV emotes because he hates mobile

257
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:07,420
viewers. It's not true. Wow, this is gonna be great. I should be able to get like at least six to here.

258
00:51:31,179 --> 00:51:55,619
Hates mobile viewers. Which way? Bad route. You're playing death stranding. Not quite.

259
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:12,489
You know, it would be kind of interesting. You know, you, you, everyone makes like the,

260
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:15,610
oh it's a strand type game. That's like the joke, right? It's the strand game.

261
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:21,530
But imagine if there was a game like GTA where if you ate anything, if you actually just made trash,

262
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:29,610
it would be way worse than this. The streets would be made out of trash.

263
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:37,500
If you like ate food in a like a game like GTA, let's say you need to eat to live

264
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:49,510
and every time you ate something it just got thrown on the ground. If that went into everybody

265
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:55,059
else's game, there would be people specifically eating just to make sure there was trash on the

266
00:52:55,059 --> 00:53:12,820
ground. I wonder what an experiment would look like if you had like, if you actually had a game

267
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:17,780
whose sole purpose was built around people making trash and people cleaning up the trash

268
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:45,780
and you got to pick which one you wanted to do. That would be insane, right? I'd pick up the trash

269
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:52,300
and make picking up the trash way more difficult than just throwing it on the ground.

270
00:53:53,019 --> 00:54:15,239
Get to 50 please. Even with the sprint, not even good. Yeah and when you pick up the trash, you get

271
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,329
you pick up a hundred pieces. If you get like a hundred cans you get a new skin

272
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:27,059
or if you deliver a hundred bags of trash you get, you unlock like skins and stuff.

273
00:54:42,389 --> 00:54:55,530
All right I'm going for this one right here. The game could just be called Town Cleanup.

274
00:54:56,170 --> 00:55:05,980
I wonder how many different discord groups would appear to try to systematically put

275
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:11,019
as much trash down as humanly possible and how many others would be trying to do against it.

276
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:31,659
Kill him. Viscera Cleanup Detail? Yeah like Viscera Cleanup Detail but it's not a lot.

277
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:50,860
What the fuck was that lock on? What was that lock on? I tried to change the lock on and it got

278
00:55:50,860 --> 00:56:00,389
whacked. Yeah but imagine that would be, I actually, I'm a weirdo, okay? I would really

279
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:05,909
think that game was fun. I love House Flipper. I love Viscera Cleanup Detail. I think a lot of

280
00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:14,489
people severely underestimate just how much people like to tidy shit up in games. Or even if there

281
00:56:14,489 --> 00:56:25,139
was, it was only cleaning up and rebuilding. I'm a weirdo. I'm weird. See, see this hat? Oh it's weird.

282
00:56:25,699 --> 00:56:45,800
What does that mean? What does it, see this hat? I have enough money, let's go. No, I need to go

283
00:56:45,800 --> 00:57:00,500
to the uh, another big bit drop. It's a money stream. I'm gonna play No More Heroes every day.

284
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:10,519
Money streams. Violactory, who is one of our resident trillionaires, uh gave another 5,000

285
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:26,090
bits. Cranberry Chocolate Sundae, fuckhead. Is that like your favorite sundae? Cranberry

286
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:37,219
Chocolate Sundae, fuckhead. Oh is that like what he literally says? It's from this, oh yeah. Cranberry

287
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:49,000
Chocolate. Fuckhead. Listening to screaming sound effects and people diarrheaing sounds. Diarrheaing

288
00:57:49,000 --> 00:58:04,070
is uh really normal. I didn't say that I was normal. I, you know what guys, I am pretty normal.

289
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:15,769
I'm pretty fucking normal. I, I chores, I do errands, I go to sleep, I wake up, I do my taxes,

290
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:22,329
I fill up my gas, I drive around, I take care of, I'm a pretty normal goddamn person.

291
00:58:23,449 --> 00:58:37,739
I eat, I go, oh that was, that was good. This is a good steak and cheese sandwich.

292
00:58:38,900 --> 00:59:02,900
I'm pretty normal. You suck at acting normal. What a boring life. No, you can have a normal

293
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:12,219
life and not have a boring life? What's, what? Oh that's right, I did say that I did call it a

294
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:32,409
changer beeper last night and people wanted to literally murder me. You're right, I did. I know

295
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:51,219
because I, I, I saw it a million times. Strength increase, good. Well let's do the stamina. Squats.

296
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,420
Look at this ring. What is it? What, what, what, what, what? It's just Colgate ring, right?

297
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:03,670
Everybody, red, white, and blue lines. Everything, it's Colgate, right?

298
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,000
When I say it, it's not funny, but when you say it, it's funny.

299
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:34,070
What's going on there? What's up with that? What's up with that? Explain this normalcy.

300
01:00:34,869 --> 01:01:28,059
Hold on, wait, I can't, it's going too fast. You gotta have context with that image. You can't just

301
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:33,579
be like, look, hey, look, this, okay, that is a pretty normal occurrence. If, but if there's

302
01:01:33,579 --> 01:01:42,519
context behind what that image is. Did a live stream based around being slimed Nickelodeon style

303
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:48,679
by your audience and one of the games was trying to get the audience to say things that they,

304
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:54,039
maybe they would say, oh, you guys say diaper all the time. So I put on a diaper

305
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:59,639
to try to force everybody to say diaper and it worked. Is that, is that so weird? Is that

306
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:29,190
so abnormal? It's very abnormal. Well, all right, I gotta, how much is the new, the new prototype?

307
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:37,110
I hate absolutely everything about this game. This challenges yesterday's stream for worst of

308
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:50,170
the decade. This game, this game is really fun. What are you on about? This, this game is, I,

309
01:02:50,170 --> 01:03:11,059
this is a very, I like this game a lot. This is a very, very fun game and the second one's good too.

310
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,780
Let's be real here. All the most famous people in history are worth weird,

311
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:49,800
really fucking weird people. Shit, it's ready. I need $148,000. I need it. I need that. How much

312
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:57,110
is it? 140. What do I have? 25,000. All right. If I do a couple more kill missions and you do them

313
01:03:57,110 --> 01:04:02,230
right and not lose, then I'll get it. I've done my strength training. I've done my,

314
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:16,179
uh, my new techniques. I gotta make money. I need to make 120, $130,000. Let's go. Do coconuts. I'm

315
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:27,269
not doing coconuts. Coconuts is pound for pound the worst. What should I do? Uh, let's go to the

316
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:31,909
assassin. Kill a hundred people. Yeah, I'll do that one. I'll see how quickly I can get through that

317
01:04:31,909 --> 01:05:01,610
one. Ooh, this is a new one. Pizza, but the finale. Chain restaurant pizza, but planes to open up.

318
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:20,280
That's 75,000. I did another huge bit. Message just come in another huge one. Another 5,000 bit

319
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:35,000
drop right now from snoozing coffee. Holy shit, snoozing. 5,050, 50 bits. I'm sorry. I'm not

320
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,280
looking at the game right now. Uh, they say at, you know, you know, at first I was going to have

321
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:44,519
this message be dedicated to make you play God hand. And I was really angry in that message

322
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:49,320
because you like this game so much with it's similar being so similar to God hand. And we

323
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:53,480
all know you would like God hand if you would give it a real chance and learn the controls.

324
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:58,280
But then you said some nice things about us, the community. So I rewrote this message,

325
01:05:59,239 --> 01:06:04,440
but for real play God hand. I'll explain why in the afterstream hangout, Hey chat, God hand rise up.

326
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:21,699
I played God hand for like 10 minutes. I still own it. Rise up is a sick of play it for real.

327
01:06:21,699 --> 01:06:26,420
Like do it for real. Did I hate it? Did I just not get it? Did I like not give it the real chance

328
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:37,989
play it for 10 more, more than 10 minutes. So does anybody have a clip of me playing it?

329
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:48,940
I mean, I didn't remember he hated it. You said you played it for 10 minutes. Of course,

330
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:58,739
that's not a real chance. You didn't beat the tutorial because you couldn't get used to the

331
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:05,030
controls in five minutes. God hand is garbage to be honest. He didn't beat the tutorial.

332
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:20,780
When is, um, I gotta get this off. This, I just looked over my other monitor and full screen is

333
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:28,539
this image. Get that out of here. All right. Let's get pizza. But when does the cuphead

334
01:07:28,539 --> 01:07:33,739
DLC come out? I feel like they announced that a year ago. When is it? When, when did we get to get

335
01:07:33,739 --> 01:07:43,750
that? It's actually going to be pretty tough. They all have lightsabers. Holy shit.

336
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:54,980
What are you doing? Trying to run. I can't run. I can't run guys.

337
01:07:58,119 --> 01:08:02,360
Just stop at me. I can't get up.

338
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:08,869
Oh my God.

339
01:08:08,869 --> 01:08:42,970
Oh, well that's why it's the finale.

340
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:54,569
I saw the screamer last night of Chuck E. Cheese demanding bits from the kids when he won the games.

341
01:08:54,569 --> 01:09:01,939
He had a rat like grin. Oh, okay. God hand. No, let me beat this first. I need money.

342
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:23,380
The sprint doesn't work. I can't go that way. The sprint doesn't work. I got baited by my own chat

343
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:34,859
telling me to be baited by me. You can't sprint. You can't sprint and fight. It's out of combat.

344
01:09:34,859 --> 01:10:01,960
Sprint only. Give me this money. We told you that. Who told me that? Crazy Ann. All right. Time to

345
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:30,779
win. I can't even sprint here. It's truly absolute out of combat. Only out in the outside world.

346
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:52,199
Dude, you have no health. This is a bad thing to do when somebody's right behind you.

347
01:10:55,380 --> 01:11:15,350
I thought he was taunting. I thought he was taunting. I thought he was fucking taunting.

348
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:20,470
He put his hand up like yeah. I'm boiling. I haven't been able to do one of these

349
01:11:21,029 --> 01:11:29,109
in like three in-game hours. I mean what's with the yelling I just did? He said that I was taunting.

350
01:11:29,989 --> 01:11:56,310
It's not to relax. If I had anything to say to you it would be this exact message.

351
01:11:57,109 --> 01:12:03,100
You're the guy that gave me less chicken than one chicken wing last night at Arby's, right? You said

352
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:07,020
your name was Jeremy something. Never got to the last name. Let me just say on behalf of the chat

353
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:11,819
could you please make an Arby's chicken wing on stream and stop slacking off at work. Thanks.

354
01:12:11,819 --> 01:12:34,340
Mr. Jeremy Arby's. I'm going to kill that CEO. I'm taunting. Real voice.

355
01:12:36,739 --> 01:12:54,659
Why is everyone suddenly talking about that shitty god hand game? I would hold up. After you say that

356
01:12:54,659 --> 01:12:59,699
please go into the giant safe. That's like a you have to close yourself in that safe because you're

357
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:03,779
about to get like rained on. People are going to rain like rocks and fucking objects at you and

358
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:17,960
stuff. I'm still like put your shield up. I'm serious. Spam B. I can't take it anymore.

359
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:32,470
I just did. That's cool. I played this game a lot of times. I didn't know that was possible.

360
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:55,939
You having fun? Yeah. Just sucks when somebody is taunting and you get hit and you lose the

361
01:13:55,939 --> 01:14:14,600
one hit mission. All right. Let's go CEO. I got to make this count. Every single person you have to

362
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:19,130
jet. I have to get in there and kill somebody. I got to get in there and kill somebody. Somebody's

363
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:24,170
like right in the front row immediately. I'm going for the not greed. I'm just going to go in. Try

364
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:34,380
to go up. Let's go. I just have to get in there and get a swipe on someone like that.

365
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:35,579
Yeah.

366
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:37,579
There it is.

367
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:32,489
Get him. Kill him. He's on the ground. He's on the ground.

368
01:15:34,250 --> 01:16:11,850
Get him. And I'm not doing the extra swing. All right. Slow down.

369
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:26,710
Taunting. I was going to fill up gas. That one's so easy. Baby Jerma going to quit that mission

370
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:38,010
like he quit Godhand. Spam B. I can't fucking take it anymore. Another day. Another crash joke. No,

371
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:42,010
I just figured crashing into the wall was easy to get off the bike instantly. I'm just walking

372
01:16:42,010 --> 01:17:01,850
into the thing. This is a good stream. I'm happy. Well, I'm glad you're happy. Is it almost New

373
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:23,399
Year's? When is it New Year's? In like six hours? Tonga? What's the country that gets the New Year's

374
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:50,180
first? This is the second time I've done this and I'm just realizing that the nozzle's not

375
01:17:50,180 --> 01:18:10,039
connected to anything. I'm holding just a big grill lighter. It's wireless. It's a Bluetooth device.

376
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:20,550
Tesla portable battery charging. You still have time to make the worst voice of the decade.

377
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:27,739
I'm not even sure I could do that if I tried. It would end up being just a weird

378
01:18:28,859 --> 01:18:34,859
mix of me trying to sound horrible and terrible and loud and I think I've probably unintentionally

379
01:18:34,859 --> 01:18:55,720
done worse ones without trying. Can't talk. What? No, I'm like I don't give opinions on what's um

380
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:03,159
until tomorrow afternoon you're not going to know my opinion on any of these categories.

381
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:17,350
You'll get my opinion on them absolutely but not until tomorrow night. By the way, the nominees

382
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:38,359
are there. I want to vote on the on that but I don't want to watch a bunch of clips.

383
01:19:38,359 --> 01:20:09,159
Oops. Okay, I have to finish this. Am I subbed? Ah, it doesn't look like it. 20 is good. So you're

384
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:14,279
not supposed to use your cell phone at a gas pump, right? Is that like a weird myth or is that true?

385
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:28,840
Is it true? Is it false? I've heard conflicting data on if you should use your cell phone at the

386
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:44,010
it's an old myth. It could cause a spark. Did you get that from Facebook? No.

387
01:20:44,329 --> 01:20:54,489
You've confused gas stations and airplanes. No, look it up. Type in cell phone at gas pump and

388
01:20:54,489 --> 01:21:07,289
you're going to go what the really what time is the New Year's Eve stream? The New Year's Eve stream

389
01:21:07,289 --> 01:21:18,180
is going to be tomorrow at 6 p.m. Pacific time is when it's going to start. It's going to start

390
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:35,619
around 9 p.m. Eastern tomorrow. Yeah, New Year's Eve. That's so late. We have to count the ball

391
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:42,060
down. That's the point of doing a New Year's Eve stream is so I can count down the ball.

392
01:21:55,659 --> 01:21:59,020
It's going to be midnight Eastern is when we're going to drop the ball.

393
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:08,489
If you're going to stay up for New Year's Eve, what do you? Well, it looks like it's 1120.

394
01:22:08,489 --> 01:22:14,789
I think it's time to clock out. Happy New Year everybody. Just text me when it turns 1201.

395
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:24,100
I think it's time for me to have a nice relaxing day and not I don't care. No, you you you you

524
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:21,109
stamina i just hit them together i just smacked them together the vibrations just hurt my hands

525

hey uh anybody any baseball players or softball players in chat here

526
01:52:29,829 --> 01:52:42,500
at all yeah some yeah remember when you used to get a like a big a fastball would come down

527
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:47,619
and you'd get a nice big swing and it would hit the either the very end or right on the hands of

528
01:52:47,619 --> 01:52:58,229
the bat and it was the worst experience in your entire life all right that was the worst i hated

529
01:52:58,229 --> 01:53:06,789
that more than anything i would rather get hit by a pitch like i would have rather the fastball hit

530
01:53:06,789 --> 01:53:12,550
me right in the shoulder than to have it hit me right on the hands of the bat and vibrate electrocute

531
01:53:12,550 --> 01:53:17,029
my whole body and hurt for like no i'd rather get hit with a pitch

533
01:53:30,199 --> 01:53:35,159
bones from your arms and stomped on them and put them back in it's the worst

534

680
02:29:42,069 --> 02:29:47,610
memed to death and makes well actually hold on a minute here because that's how people start to

681
02:29:47,610 --> 02:29:52,170
hate something it gets really really really popular and then a bunch of people meme the

682
02:29:52,170 --> 02:29:58,420
fuck out of it to a point where nobody likes it anymore i don't know we're at that territory yet

683
02:29:59,219 --> 02:30:09,739
people still like the the marvel memes they did that with all of them yeah but i'm not sure we've

684
02:30:09,739 --> 02:30:15,719
crossed that let's put it this way i'm not sure we've crossed like the szechuan sauce threshold

685
02:30:15,719 --> 02:30:29,059

694
02:32:27,739 --> 02:32:36,250
pizza but more like pizza hut it depends on how many people are in the room and if they have

695
02:32:36,250 --> 02:33:03,579
lightsabers or not what's the worst thing on the menu at pizza hut oh i know uh the cheese stuff

696
02:33:05,159 --> 02:33:14,809
yeah the cheese thing is terrible um what's the best thing pizza stuff cross pizza i already know

697
02:33:15,370 --> 02:33:28,629
get the spaghetti the last few times i've had pizza hut this is the worst part about pizza

698
02:33:28,629 --> 02:33:36,790
for me at least personally i think that was a one hitter pizza hut always to me tastes

699
02:33:37,829 --> 02:33:44,149
this is awesome i love it but i think i've gotten sick the last two or three times

700
02:33:44,149 --> 02:33:44,549
a pack

701
02:33:54,120 --> 02:34:08,920
this happens very very quickly 15

702
02:34:14,440 --> 02:34:17,860
that's awful

703
02:34:20,420 --> 02:34:31,479
most chain pizza places are off the gas we've had this conversation on screen before already

704
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:36,760
i know that some people that don't have opportunities to eat anything that's not

705
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:41,879
something like a pizza but they're all pretty bad

706
02:34:48,440 --> 02:35:02,250
it's just kind of taking off my brain i don't think this one's fine for 100 000 but i don't like

707
02:35:02,250 --> 02:35:08,540
this i'm starting to see something get like blurred vision from this

708
02:35:25,819 --> 02:35:34,729
yeah this actually hurts my head so we're not doing this one again

709

715
02:37:24,469 --> 02:37:32,139

02:37:34,739 --> 02:37:49,000
i don't know anybody have a timer for that all right 488 let's do the next

717
02:37:49,000 --> 02:38:33,049
uh rank four rank four coming up right seeing a lot of purple in the chat that's so funny that

718
02:38:33,049 --> 02:38:47,639
that those mailboxes are just one asset that have pasted down atm deposit 400 000 dollars

719
02:38:48,520 --> 02:39:16,700
well maybe not yet did i do uh these yet i don't think i did you guys i'll give you i'll give you

720
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:24,489
credit you guys have been on point with the photoshop links these last few days but here's

721
02:39:24,489 --> 02:39:32,899
the thing is this don't read this this is real voodoo you are now cursed the only way to reverse

722
02:39:32,899 --> 02:39:38,979
this christine entire domino's meat lovers pizza on camera uh there's like over 5 000 people here

723
02:39:39,780 --> 02:39:47,100
i mean i think did i just curse everybody i just cursed everybody you have to eat a pizza on camera

724
02:39:51,100 --> 02:39:51,579
sorry

725
02:39:59,340 --> 02:40:08,180
you fool i'm sorry i had to show it so you guys can see what i was talking about

726
02:40:12,100 --> 02:40:38,950
no you have to eat 5 000 pizzas extended combo let's do this is another bench press

727
02:40:39,909 --> 02:40:54,979
let's do it domino's is gonna have a spike in sales today papa john's pizza is actually the worst

728
02:40:58,040 --> 02:41:06,819
um yeah it's like it does it does like it does like suck doesn't it um who out of all the chains

729
02:41:06,819 --> 02:41:15,319
who has the best people i know that's simple that would be pappagino's but that pappagino's i think

730
02:41:15,319 --> 02:41:28,979
is a new england thing so that's not technically like a like a national chain right it's only a

731
02:41:28,979 --> 02:41:47,159
northeast thing so i know that counts does it papa john's

732
02:41:56,200 --> 02:42:02,809
chain pizza is strange because if you have a bad chain pizza at least in my case

733
02:42:03,770 --> 02:42:11,750
there's never a single solitary fucking reason to ever eat it again i've eaten papa john's

734
02:42:11,750 --> 02:42:17,590
probably twice and it was 15 years ago i was like oh this is this sucks i don't like this

735
02:42:17,590 --> 02:42:22,069
oh this well let me look around in a circle there's like 700 pizza places around me

736
02:42:22,069 --> 02:42:34,819
oh well why would i ever eat here ever again ever again for any reason but if you don't have pizza

737
02:42:34,819 --> 02:42:40,100
places like sandwich shops pizza shops all over the place then i can understand why if papa john's

738
02:42:40,100 --> 02:42:56,010
is all you got then that's kind of all you got all right with any team we have pizza place but

739
02:42:56,010 --> 02:43:05,690
only the chain ones deliver that's another key part of this too is if a place doesn't deliver

740
02:43:05,690 --> 02:43:11,799
you know something sometimes you just wanted to sit around and have somebody bring you something

741
02:43:17,239 --> 02:43:27,739

776
02:50:06,649 --> 02:50:13,020
domino's i'm gonna be fair to domino's here do you remember when they had that whole campaign

777
02:50:13,979 --> 02:50:18,540
on ads on tv where the ceo read all the comments about people talking about how bad the pizza is

778
02:50:20,950 --> 02:50:28,709
hi i'm ceo uh kevin from domino's pizza we've seen your comments on how our sauce tastes like

779
02:50:28,709 --> 02:50:41,479
ketchup and it's the grossest pizza on earth remember that go and give the performance of

780
02:50:41,479 --> 02:50:59,909
your life you can do this and here's the thing after they did that whole campaign where they

781
02:51:00,709 --> 02:51:04,629
and i'll give it to them i really have to hand it to domino's they did this is a brilliant strategy

782
02:51:05,510 --> 02:51:10,870
they told everybody that that pizza was horrible they said our pizza sucks it's disgusting it's

783
02:51:10,870 --> 02:51:20,469
dog shit but we changed the recipe give it a try everybody tried it like oh yeah like domino's

784
02:51:20,469 --> 02:51:27,129
this sucks ass uh but they changed the recipe i'll order one just just from that campaign 10

785
02:51:27,129 --> 02:51:30,569
years ago they made more money probably that they needed to in the next 10 years

786
02:51:31,370 --> 02:51:49,139
what about you my stream sucks but we changed the camp it was brilliant it was an absolutely

787
02:51:49,139 --> 02:52:08,969
brilliant campaign it was brilliant hi germa985 here we've seen the complaints about how my

788
02:52:08,969 --> 02:52:15,450
stream is uh way too loud and way too quiet at the same time what we've decided to do

789
02:52:16,629 --> 02:52:40,969
is try it is double down harvey moys which world is sarski you're way quieter than the ads i don't

790
02:52:40,969 --> 02:53:01,879
want everyone to have a hurt ear get out of the kiosk oh my god you're annoying double down like

791
02:53:01,959 --> 02:53:21,190
i make it louder and i talk quieter remember when i had subsounds that were 10 times louder than me

792
02:53:22,069 --> 02:53:24,790
oh i remember i remember

793
02:53:36,950 --> 02:53:47,940
i miss those subsounds sometimes i do too but as this channel has gotten

794
02:53:49,059 --> 02:53:55,860
larger and the channel in the community has grown two or three times in the last three years

795
02:53:56,819 --> 02:54:18,549
i it would be like having tts on screen i missed the salt and sanctuary days when

796
02:54:19,270 --> 02:54:26,309
paul bearer would talk for like 25 straight i used to have a sub sound that was 25 straight seconds

797
02:54:27,270 --> 02:54:41,610
i wonder what that would be like if i did that again just for like 20 minutes so you guys could

798
02:54:41,610 --> 02:54:55,579
we could we could see but i feel like it would be an inaccurate sampling because i think people

799
02:54:55,579 --> 02:55:08,620
would just sub to make sure that it played over and over again right am i seriously stuck

800
02:55:11,290 --> 02:55:43,239
why is he not dead do it do it till the end of the decade we are not doing that oh that's

865
03:14:08,260 --> 03:14:15,129
i realize i'm the same age as travis how old is travis touchdown supposed to be

866
03:14:15,770 --> 03:14:33,290
27 i thought he was older 29 in this game so does that mean in no more heroes 3 travis is

867
03:14:33,290 --> 03:14:43,799
going to be 40 something he'll be like 38 or 38 he'll be like 40 that's pretty cool i like that

868
03:14:43,799 --> 03:15:03,000
i'll be i can relate to him more yeah because it's 10 years or nine years right from no more

869
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:14,149
heroes 2 or no more heroes 1 10 years from no more heroes 1 i think something like that

870
03:15:17,989 --> 03:15:24,469
the video you returned was a copy of one of our video titles um the best of raunchy amateur

871
03:15:24,469 --> 03:15:31,110
interviews too you didn't seem to copy the whole tape though it ended two minutes into the middle

872
03:15:31,110 --> 03:15:36,469
of the first interview anyway please be sure to return the original tape you borrowed thank you

873
03:15:37,750 --> 03:15:43,590
i was too young to know or care good morning mr touchdown understand are you on the throne

874
03:15:43,590 --> 03:15:47,670
could you have done that with blockbuster if you rented a movie from blockbuster could you have

875
03:15:47,670 --> 03:15:57,450
just taped over a new tape or something was that possible was that even possible you would need

876
03:15:57,450 --> 03:16:09,290
two decks right somehow 450 000 new amount of money it had to be legit well you would just you

877
03:16:09,290 --> 03:16:14,969
would keep the copy you wouldn't return the copy right you would copy the tape and then give the

878
03:16:14,969 --> 03:16:28,680
original tape back to blockbuster did people do that yeah probably should that would that's

879
03:16:28,680 --> 03:16:40,940
probably that was very horrible that's very rampant i'd say the game all right games already

880
03:16:40,940 --> 03:17:13,639
saved we need to make 450 000 new job yep yep yep yep yep is this scorpions this might be

881
03:17:13,639 --> 03:17:20,809
scorpion mission time i think there's only two more missions or two more uh jobs that exist in

882
03:17:20,809 --> 03:17:47,350
the game it's nine right and another five assassin missions something like that off bike i can't

978
03:43:05,049 --> 03:43:09,450
movie i've ever seen i'm so happy that there's at least one person giving me a five star review in

993
03:46:29,290 --> 03:46:47,610
i could you know i'm gonna do one more assassin mission and i'm gonna do a ninja warrior stream

994
03:46:47,610 --> 03:46:59,780
against an athlete i would probably be okay in those i would perform pretty well although i can't

995
03:46:59,780 --> 03:47:10,780
right now i would actually like to do that uh which one hasn't been done this one wrestling

996
03:47:10,780 --> 03:47:30,549
moves only let's do it 2012 germa could have done it probably how many channel points for a 5g gum

997
03:47:30,549 --> 03:47:58,860
joke i can not again that is really funny though that box box opens the street and said hey this

998
03:47:58,860 --> 03:48:05,799
is we're gonna raid let's go and it's oh his cam just turned on i thought we were in the clear

999
03:48:05,799 --> 03:48:33,639
oh well wrestling moves only you 70 000 away from a german wink save up is it only uh gun

1000
03:48:33,639 --> 03:48:44,739
people no that's actually sucks nice oh wait what i'm trying to

1001
03:48:48,500 --> 03:49:16,969
this is okay come on i wish i could sprint here this is gonna be hard to get this guy

1002
03:49:17,610 --> 03:49:50,760
the guy behind him get him give her this guy behind you get him this is 7 000 or 5 000 for kill

1003
03:49:51,479 --> 03:50:05,059
knock him out ddt that's the best move in all of wrestling it's seven night that's just that's

1004
03:50:05,059 --> 03:50:38,870
really good this would be all right wrong don't run don't run don't run don't run don't run don't

1005
03:50:38,870 --> 03:50:55,940
run don't run don't run don't uh and you've ran over here again again where's your wink

1006
03:50:55,940 --> 03:51:24,979
you need 75 000 channel points that's a lot oh well i think that's enough to level up

1007
03:51:25,700 --> 03:51:32,950
this game has worse graphics than gta 4 well this because it does it yeah this thing was on the wii

1008
03:51:41,909 --> 03:52:01,930
the wii was just a game cube that they injected with steroids it's not surprising let's go to the

1009
03:52:01,930 --> 03:52:13,049
gym i didn't mean the console was bad the wii was awesome i'm gonna make a statement here and it

1010
03:52:13,049 --> 03:52:22,420
might sound a little controversial to some of you guys i don't know we'll see i think the wii is the

1011
03:52:22,420 --> 03:52:31,659
best most appealing looking console it's like it i loved the shape and how much it weighed and how

1012
03:52:31,659 --> 03:52:38,620
small and compact it was i loved that just the the wii console i thought it was really really cool i

1013
03:52:38,620 --> 03:52:46,260
like the the top the pop the top off of the controllers i really really enjoyed the week

1014
03:52:47,739 --> 03:52:53,420
it was shiny sleek it was small enough it had a little tray putting discs and putting a game cube

1015
03:52:53,420 --> 03:53:07,180
disk in was so cool we're gonna do uh this one and that's it it was a very well designed machine

1016
03:53:07,819 --> 03:53:28,489
it had the virtual console it had super mario galaxy it had no more heroes it had carnival

1017
03:53:28,489 --> 03:53:39,799
games which i think sold better than no more heroes did in fact carnival games may have sold

1018
03:53:39,799 --> 03:54:03,139
better than mario galaxy it has manhunt isn't manhunt the games where you just walk up behind

1019
03:54:03,139 --> 03:54:16,489
people like strangling with plastic bags it is okay i'm making sure i'm thinking rock star made

1020
03:54:16,489 --> 03:54:29,209
it right i'm thinking the right game is this baseball arm what is this

1021
03:54:40,649 --> 03:55:02,440
manhunt is banned on twitch is that real i mean i i guess i can kind of understand

1022
03:55:02,440 --> 03:55:08,469
him i mean without that entire game is you just don't you just like hide like

1023
03:55:08,469 --> 03:55:13,670
sneak around and like i said flatten they just strangle people to death and that's it and like

1024
03:55:13,670 --> 03:55:19,670
put hooks in their heads and stuff is there is there a game to manhunt or are you actually

1025
03:55:19,670 --> 03:55:49,700
just sneaking around murdering people there is a flaw is there a point to this game would you

1026
03:55:49,700 --> 03:55:58,680
run yes i'm trying to be the number one assassin in the united states i'm not just creeping around

1027
03:55:58,680 --> 03:56:06,200
with a bunch of like grocery bags who's that guy over there yeah i'm gonna put a plow chugging

1028
03:56:06,200 --> 03:56:32,549
with a plastic bag it's not the same thing that was a lot of money let me go to the gym

1029
03:56:33,590 --> 03:56:41,340
and we'll do assassin number three get into the top three getting to the actual end of the game

1030
03:56:41,340 --> 03:57:11,049
here coming up soon the end game end of the game i know you want that right i had a dream where

1031
03:57:11,129 --> 03:57:28,409
jerma played manhunt on stream naked and everyone was spamming t.o.s like i wouldn't know dude hey

1032
03:57:28,409 --> 03:57:38,659

1034

1069
04:08:07,559 --> 04:08:30,870

1070
04:08:31,750 --> 04:08:52,940
this hello next up is a win and devil's laugh you didn't dream about me i'll fucking kill you i

1071
04:08:52,940 --> 04:08:59,979
swear if i ever hear you say another woman's name on your sleep you'll wake up the next morning with

1072
04:08:59,979 --> 04:09:07,989
your joystick missing got it anyway make sure you hit the red button on the iphone and when you

1073
04:09:07,989 --> 04:09:11,799
change number break the phone in half move to a different state

1074
04:09:12,440 --> 04:09:34,860
legions of more powerful opponents out there never forget that keep your feet on the ground

1075
04:09:34,860 --> 04:09:44,329
your head out of the clouds i am three billion six hundred and two million six hundred thousand

1076
04:09:44,329 --> 04:09:52,489
two hundred and eighteen percent certain you will die trust your force and head for the garden of

1077
04:09:52,489 --> 04:10:17,829
madness okay is there a bathroom on the bus i don't think so bathroom out here

1078
04:10:18,549 --> 04:10:24,950
bathrooms on the bus are the worst i'm not sure i've ever been on a bus long enough where i've had

1079
04:10:24,950 --> 04:10:43,770
to use the bathroom bus reverse that you know what i mean found the cat i think the longest i've been

1080
04:10:43,770 --> 04:11:01,590
on a bus was maybe a few hours a couple hours maybe the longest i've been on the bus was 14 hours

1081
04:11:03,399 --> 04:11:12,659
holy shit where were you going from where to where yeah i've never had to be on a bus long

1082
04:11:12,659 --> 04:11:24,139
enough for the bus to need to get gas so and not probably less than something like that

1083
04:11:24,940 --> 04:11:32,920
because if you're on a bus for 14 hours doesn't that bus need to stop and get gas how do you get

1084
04:11:32,920 --> 04:11:36,280
did you just pull all right this is a real question i might sound like a fucking idiot

1085
04:11:37,239 --> 04:11:43,239
so if you're on a bus for like 15 hours you have to stop and give gas do you just pull over to a

1086
04:11:43,239 --> 04:11:47,159
gas station and just everybody just kind of hangs out while the bus driver gets out and fills the

1087
04:11:47,159 --> 04:12:00,459
gas tank is that like what happens pretty much yeah so just kind of like a highway rest stop

1088
04:12:07,209 --> 04:12:20,979
stay back this one's mine so there is a guy that's been training me what cat you frightened me for a

1089
04:12:20,979 --> 04:12:32,629
second kitty master oh i have been so i'm coming master

1090
04:12:32,790 --> 04:12:45,579

1091
04:12:45,579 --> 04:13:08,200
the exploding that was a true explosion was the cat and so freaking ignorant they never learn no

1092
04:13:08,200 --> 04:13:17,030

1181
04:47:14,279 --> 04:47:20,470
yo

1182
04:47:40,889 --> 04:47:52,009
shaking around right now actually the thing is as you can tell me swinging around this is what it

1183
04:47:52,009 --> 04:47:55,209
sounds like when i talk when i do this you understand

1184
04:48:14,470 --> 04:48:20,549
this could be a shitload of money this is gonna be a huge amount of this is gonna be more than

1185
04:48:20,549 --> 04:48:24,970
a hundred thousand dollars it's gonna be like two hundred and eighty thousand dollars

1186
04:48:47,639 --> 04:49:10,630
eighty eight eight that's gonna be 1500 times 88 oh my god but that's three minutes

1203
04:53:42,779 --> 04:53:54,659
i would say that's probably peak fuckface i would say absolutely so i can slide from the left one

1204
04:53:54,659 --> 04:53:58,580
all the way to the right one in one go i can play fruit ninja across three screens

1205
04:54:15,500 --> 04:54:18,779
tape them together so they each other's back they're at each other's backs and

1206
04:54:18,779 --> 04:54:20,220
flip it around when you want to do something else

1207
04:54:25,700 --> 04:54:33,959
you know that's not i mean it's a that's not that's incredibly overdone but that's still

1208
04:54:36,549 --> 04:54:37,669
there's an application

1209
04:54:37,909 --> 04:54:52,939
all right

1210
04:54:53,180 --> 04:55:17,819
okay

1211
04:55:36,759 --> 04:55:46,860
minute 10 seconds left you save about a full minute or so and how much more do i get

1212
04:55:48,860 --> 04:56:07,130
yeah this one's worth doing time for the weapon well after when i get the new weapon i'll do the

1213
04:56:07,130 --> 04:56:14,330
gamble fight because then i probably kill way more people but i get 80 something last time

1214
04:56:14,330 --> 04:56:37,459
i probably go over 100 no more heroes part two string aka jeremy clicks every link in the chat

1215
04:56:46,389 --> 04:57:10,040
just hold on a second community content night yeah something like that okay here we go

1216
04:57:10,520 --> 04:57:18,860
subaki mk3 there goes all my money and there any parts for it there are not parts for it

1217
04:57:19,979 --> 04:57:45,740
it's just the best one somebody made this into a real pillow this image is freaking me out

1218
04:57:46,299 --> 04:57:55,419
this image is scaring the shit out of me where are you standing where are you this is a look

1219
04:57:55,419 --> 04:58:00,819
okay this look at this it's a table look at how high up you are from that cup of coffee

1220
04:58:01,540 --> 04:58:13,880
this is weird right it's it's like this that's that table look it's like almost like you're

1221
04:58:14,919 --> 04:58:32,740
why is that coffee so small this is not a table this is a floor that so this is just a gigantic

1222
04:58:32,740 --> 04:58:41,240
pillow then imagine forgetting that you put this on the pillow and waking up in the middle of the

1223
04:58:41,240 --> 04:58:47,099
night to go to the bathroom getting back situated comfortable and like turning your head in the dark

1224
04:58:47,819 --> 04:59:07,479
and seeing that that's pretty scary these dudes have never seen a rug before

1225
04:59:11,000 --> 04:59:17,209
i didn't expect the pillow to be that big i thought it was you look i'm working on it i'm

1226
04:59:17,209 --> 04:59:35,540
on the table i'm working on it i'm making this on the table jeremy's entire house is carpeted

1227
04:59:36,340 --> 04:59:46,180
yeah even the bathroom i want comfortable feet when i'm going to the bathroom all right where's

1228
04:59:46,180 --> 04:59:53,270
that one i got them i got the best weapon in the game it's this gamble fight yeah let's just go

1229
04:59:53,270 --> 05:00:08,779
carve up people for three minutes and see if i can make 200 000 i might be able to get more than

1230
05:00:08,779 --> 05:00:18,630
that how strong is this weapon strong is it equally as far distance between the third and

1231
05:00:18,630 --> 05:00:45,419
fourth blade it's not as strong but it's faster you'll find out oh that's cool this uh this is

1232
05:00:45,419 --> 05:01:07,979
awesome it's like it reminds me of a power ranger sword yes because he's walking away

1233
05:01:14,040 --> 05:01:25,580
holy shit okay that killed everybody rage is crazy

1234
05:01:35,029 --> 05:01:37,290
well this is worth it

1235
05:01:40,200 --> 05:01:43,259
you can't even spawn them faster if you kill them

1236
05:01:52,939 --> 05:01:55,180
it does take a little some of the windups take a little while here though

1237
05:02:18,889 --> 05:02:21,529
killing people dude yeah i know it's part of the game

1238
05:02:27,720 --> 05:02:35,450
ridiculous 39 what did i have 88 for

1239
05:02:38,330 --> 05:02:54,279
i love it i love that spin spin spin spin part of it it's great

1240
05:02:58,759 --> 05:03:03,319
what am i watching right now you're watching somebody farm money for the end game of no more

1241
05:03:09,799 --> 05:03:19,619
okay spawn me buddy let's go spawn spawn bring him over here all you

1242
05:03:26,229 --> 05:03:26,869
shit i didn't do it

1243
05:03:31,500 --> 05:03:32,380
why does it lie down

1244
05:03:36,500 --> 05:03:56,659
oh too many too many people one one guy

1245
05:03:58,580 --> 05:04:11,419
i'm killing people too fast

1246
05:04:11,819 --> 05:04:20,869
what a pain i killed less people than last time yeah i got only 80 i think they're dying so

1247
05:04:20,869 --> 05:04:27,529
quickly that it takes two or three seconds for them to respond it was less than the last time

1248
05:04:27,529 --> 05:04:42,740
it's actually too strong do the hot do this high charge attack oh you're right i didn't

1249
05:04:42,740 --> 05:04:45,619
i didn't even think to look for that let me try the heart let's try that

1250
05:04:46,419 --> 05:04:57,720
i say do the high charge attack in the gamble fight all right i'm gonna go for it but first

1251
05:04:58,439 --> 05:05:09,669
let's do this what that's an omega pog farming spot i know you already supposed to be dead

1252
05:05:21,340 --> 05:05:30,970
combo damn this is expensive all right combo it's probably the last upgrade maybe there's one more

1253
05:05:30,970 --> 05:05:45,580
after this

1254
05:05:54,810 --> 05:06:03,110
you're not hitting the right notes good strength and then health

1255
05:06:10,139 --> 05:06:14,919
so

1256
05:06:15,639 --> 05:06:27,049
only 15 pounds 15 30 45 90 this is like one bar is what is it how much is the bar 45

1257
05:06:36,119 --> 05:06:48,020
bar is 45 do i have enough to do i do the final health upgrade

1258
05:06:48,740 --> 05:07:22,090
i just spent all my money but i can get it all back i wait for you somebody do some quick math

1259
05:07:22,090 --> 05:07:37,240
here i need to get the full snake suit i need 500 000 for the entry fee snake suit was what 200

1260
05:07:37,240 --> 05:08:00,569
something let's do the let's try that technique that somebody said somebody in chat said hey dude

1261
05:08:00,569 --> 05:08:08,259
you can farm the fuck out of this place do the high charge at the gambling one with this weapon

1262
05:08:08,979 --> 05:08:21,380
with these upgrades you'll get a million dollars in no time let's try it

1263
05:08:25,299 --> 05:08:31,819
mr streamer there's a battery upgrade for the sword that gives infinite battery please get it

1264
05:08:33,180 --> 05:08:45,880
there was no it wasn't available i wasn't on the list when i went there

1265
05:08:46,759 --> 05:09:00,979
all right so he's saying high charge into the group of people

1266
05:09:03,099 --> 05:09:27,830
see if i can get this work low charge okay low charge to find a spot i can't see where i am

1267
05:09:38,069 --> 05:09:49,909
hello this camera sucks

1268
05:09:50,709 --> 05:09:54,169
oh it was high

1269
05:10:04,619 --> 05:10:06,540
all right well this technique ain't gonna work

1270
05:10:09,130 --> 05:10:13,049
take a long time to charge that up and look at this battery no this ain't gonna work

1271
05:10:13,689 --> 05:10:18,310
oh

1272
05:10:35,779 --> 05:11:05,540
someone getting one person wow this guy sucks i'm testing something this is not for real

1273
05:11:10,180 --> 05:11:23,799
oh shit this guy's so bad at this game yeah i'm all right i this is

1274
05:11:35,270 --> 05:11:39,430
oh he's gonna die in the gamble fight

1275
05:12:04,439 --> 05:12:07,240
you need to have infinite battery for it well that wasn't part of the deal

1276
05:12:08,279 --> 05:12:45,830
what the fuck is everybody still got 36 000 for that i think it was low actually i think

1277
05:12:45,830 --> 05:12:49,029
it was high actually i think it was low i think it was high you know it may have been low

1278
05:12:49,750 --> 05:13:01,509
oh fucking i'm just i'm just gonna do it my way i'm gonna do the scorpion mission right now and

1279
05:13:01,509 --> 05:13:22,380

1280
05:13:22,380 --> 05:13:37,909

1281
05:13:37,909 --> 05:13:47,369
risky i'll get a body pillow made of my face and it'll be in bed with me for at least three nights

1282
05:14:00,700 --> 05:14:14,220
kim is gonna think you're a psycho all right so that it's three thousand dollars per

1283
05:14:15,099 --> 05:14:23,779
scorpion which means to get a hundred thousand you need to do so let's say 30 would be 60,000

1284
05:14:23,860 --> 05:14:54,119
40 i need what 50 40 what how many 50 something 87 that's not correct let's go

1299
05:19:09,799 --> 05:19:31,099
choosing why does that exist wait what somebody's selling this for 57 dollars what in the name of

1300
05:19:31,099 --> 05:19:51,189
god 57 dollars read the reviews what i mean people have bought this people have not bought this

1301
05:19:53,659 --> 05:20:01,700
there's a four star review it's pretty big so only buy if you want to get something that fills a lot

1302
05:20:01,700 --> 05:20:07,939
of space but other than that it's very good the floor pillows look excellent the floor pillows

1303
05:20:07,939 --> 05:20:14,759
look excellent on my floor very good the print is clear and looks awesome very well made great

1304
05:20:14,759 --> 05:20:19,959
pillows which are a great pillows which are a wonderful decoration accessory for every room

1305
05:20:19,959 --> 05:20:39,430
quality is good colors are shining bright what is good what is going on we originally ordered this

1306
05:20:39,430 --> 05:20:44,549
product to use as cases for sleeping pillows since the fabric used is rather rough to the touch it

1307
05:20:44,549 --> 05:20:49,830
is not really so suitable for that purpose however as its original and stated intended use is to be

1308
05:20:49,830 --> 05:20:54,470
a floor pillow case i will not count our failed experiment against that product for its intended

1309
05:20:54,470 --> 05:20:59,509
purpose for the pillow case is really good robust fabric keeps its shape machine washable clear

1310
05:20:59,509 --> 05:21:04,869
vibrant colors that don't wash out very good quality and i can definitely recommend it if

1311
05:21:04,869 --> 05:21:10,630
you want a shiny pretty happy case for a couch or floor pillow to lounge on and then in brackets

1312
05:21:10,630 --> 05:21:15,270
consider getting a filler pillow along with the case if available we didn't and it's not trivial

1313
05:21:15,270 --> 05:21:20,389
to come by a 90 by 90 centimeter pillow where i live printing and shipping was fast without any

1314
05:21:20,389 --> 05:21:24,630
issues my only request for redbubble is to add actual sleeping pillow cases made out of the

1315
05:21:24,630 --> 05:21:39,319
same fabric as the bedding covers of the product line up shiny happy pillows similar designs

1316
05:21:43,020 --> 05:21:57,479
what's the fuck let's read these reviews this is on a different product completely separate it's

1317
05:21:57,479 --> 05:22:03,080
just it's my it's it's the germ of fear face on another pillow we originally ordered this product

1318
05:22:03,080 --> 05:22:07,080
to use as cases for sleeping pillows since the fabric uses rather rough to the touch it's not

1319
05:22:07,080 --> 05:22:11,319
really suitable for that purpose however as its original stated intended use it is to be a floor

1320
05:22:11,319 --> 05:22:14,680
pillow case i will not count our failed experiment against the product for its intended purpose the

1321
05:22:14,680 --> 05:22:18,040
pillow case is really good robust fabric it keeps its shape machine washable clear vibrant colors

1322
05:22:18,040 --> 05:22:20,759
that don't wash out very good quality that i can definitely recommend if you want a pretty

1323
05:22:20,759 --> 05:22:36,680
shiny happy pillow case it's the same fucking thing it's the same seven reviews he's just

1326
05:23:06,520 --> 05:23:11,880
it i was surprised at first because i didn't think it would be so wiggly but i soon started

1327
05:23:11,880 --> 05:23:19,529
to use it for a lot of notes the artwork on the spiral is great quality and the surface and pages

1328
05:23:19,529 --> 05:23:52,950
were immaculate amazing the notebooks were very sturdy is there a shower curtain wait this is

1329

1341
05:26:55,900 --> 05:27:01,799
you can hear the phrase for every door that's closed three open that's programmer lingo

1342
05:27:12,740 --> 05:27:19,450
for every for every door that you close three more open fixing bugs and shit that's for every

1343
05:27:19,450 --> 05:27:25,349
one that you get rid of 10 more will take your place we don't say that yes you do i know

1344
05:27:25,349 --> 05:27:29,590
programmer i know programmer and that's where i got it from they told me that's what they say

1353
05:29:48,299 --> 05:30:12,220

1354
05:30:14,619 --> 05:30:26,459
be big one one that goes up doesn't kill

1355
05:30:31,099 --> 05:30:44,229
come here

1356
05:30:46,979 --> 05:30:49,540
yeah the horizontal movement is the best one but it doesn't happen every time

1357
05:30:58,020 --> 05:31:21,619
very good 66 not good

1358
05:31:21,619 --> 05:31:53,189
80 again stuck at 80 forever not even 79 this is a very good stream i like the stream because it

1359
05:31:53,189 --> 05:31:57,029
is the one i watch definitely five stars the only thing is the stream is quite long so i'm

1360
05:31:57,029 --> 05:32:11,750
only glad if you want something that fills a lot of space very good product 235 000 that's enough

1361
05:32:11,750 --> 05:32:20,200
to get the snake outfit i think at least a couple pieces of it what about the entry fee

1362
05:32:32,020 --> 05:32:50,220
the entry fee guys i need five hundred thousand dollars yeah fuck the snakes i ain't doing it

1363
05:33:00,979 --> 05:33:05,299

welcome i got the money for it i'll get it i just bought these i don't want to do this one again

1365
05:33:15,900 --> 05:33:26,090
what's the uh this one's seven thousand per kill seven thousand kill all targets it's a secret

1366
05:33:27,319 --> 05:33:33,430
seven thousand per kill kill as many as you can within the time limit missing when time runs out

1367
05:33:34,150 --> 05:33:40,069
how's this one gamble fights is going to be the most efficient yeah but it's boring

1368
05:33:40,790 --> 05:34:01,979
it's just grinding all right fine i just saw something really funny um i can't i i'm not

1369
05:34:01,979 --> 05:34:06,779

1373
05:34:36,139 --> 05:34:53,610
title of the listing what are they trying to say i don't know nothing probably it's probably just

1374
05:34:53,610 --> 05:35:00,950
a robot

1450
05:55:08,759 --> 05:55:15,689

1451
05:55:15,689 --> 05:55:25,819
playthrough maybe for at least an hour that has been flipping myself upside down and pretending

1454
05:56:05,430 --> 05:56:09,669

1455
05:56:10,389 --> 05:56:15,509
to get to rank one if that's the case then you know it's gonna take a little longer than that

1566
06:39:47,860 --> 06:40:00,540

1567
06:40:00,540 --> 06:40:15,979
i know that's right on behalf of sylvia crystal i'm here to tell you that you are now officially

1569
06:40:27,159 --> 06:40:31,000
shit that was close so what is it is the last fight between oenstein and smog here

1570
06:40:45,990 --> 06:41:12,709
marvelous upgrade the sword first let's see how much money it takes so all those minus twos and

1571
06:41:12,709 --> 06:41:20,939
plus two referring to frame data but what people trying to tell me to save a few extra frames or

1572
06:41:20,939 --> 06:41:30,330
add a few frames i saw a lot of add some frames i don't i didn't need to lose frames i don't know

1573
06:41:30,330 --> 06:41:35,400
why everyone's saying that i didn't need to do it early it's kind of stupid it's weird why is

1574
06:41:35,400 --> 06:41:42,569
people saying that hi we're sorry to inform you that your video membership will be revoked until

1576
06:41:53,990 --> 06:41:59,990
good morning mr touchdown i wish you a pleasant journey to number one

1577
06:42:07,639 --> 06:42:17,290
five hundred and fifty thousand dollars that's a lot of money is there any more jobs no there's

1578
06:42:17,290 --> 06:42:47,180
two more right there must be two more assassin jobs then to round out 20 sure my time is running out

1579
06:42:47,180 --> 06:43:03,349
it's almost 8 p.m in tonga we ain't gonna see that a new there's a new job what's the new part-time

1580
06:43:03,349 --> 06:43:36,060
job what else is something after scorpion what's the end of the year almost almost not quite though

1581
06:43:36,939 --> 06:43:51,540
2020 is right around the corner almost here you always the germapillow yeah but i can't all right

1582
06:43:51,540 --> 06:43:57,459
can that be like an early 2020 thing i have to actually have one made i have to i'm not buying

1583
06:43:57,459 --> 06:44:12,549
like a 500 dollar one on red bubble whatever this thing is called you come here all right what's the

1584
06:44:12,549 --> 06:44:32,810
job bike jump jump your bike off the point try to fly as far as possible is this game on steam this

1585
06:44:32,810 --> 06:44:46,310
is not on steam this is for we and playstation 3 xbox if you live in japan this is the original no

1586
06:44:46,310 --> 06:44:58,259
more heroes the ps3 version sucks is what i've been told a bunch of times i'm told it's not great

1587
06:44:59,060 --> 06:45:07,880
i also was told that the ps3 version of this game for some reason maybe they just didn't think they

1588
06:45:07,880 --> 06:45:14,119
were ever going to remake the second game but didn't they put like five or six of the bosses

1589
06:45:14,119 --> 06:45:21,270
from no more heroes 2 in the game as just random just bosses you can fight afterwards so kind of

1590
06:45:21,830 --> 06:45:33,380
i'd rather just play a second no culture here nothing but dropouts and even dropouts can create

1591
06:45:33,380 --> 06:45:39,540
their own culture ride those waves dropouts rise those bikes but the biggest dropouts of all they

1592
06:45:39,540 --> 06:45:44,259
jump good jump will jump start your future it's a world that only those who experience it can

1593
06:45:44,259 --> 06:45:48,340
understand a wide and wonderful world the god of jumping away so you jump long and jump hard

1594
06:45:49,639 --> 06:45:54,439
speed up and jump from the ramp on the point but from a well-timed wheelie jump to jump further

1595
06:45:55,159 --> 06:46:19,000
three time there is a time limit so just straight ahead where is it how far down the road is it

1596
06:46:19,639 --> 06:46:38,979
here we go that's pretty fucking far okay i just jumped out of the world i jumped out of the

1597
06:46:38,979 --> 06:47:03,189
invisible i went past a barrier 50 000 50k for like 10 seconds let's see what the last two assassin

1598
06:47:03,189 --> 06:47:10,490
missions are yeah that's insane money for no time at all i'll just do that like five times

1599
06:47:15,430 --> 06:47:35,500
what is the final mission kill without taking a single hit from the enemy 10 000 per kill

1600
06:47:35,500 --> 06:47:42,090
holy shit that's a lot kill all the enemies with the time limit you'll face cloned humans

1601
06:47:45,060 --> 06:47:56,119
oh that's some i shouldn't even attempt it why is this one good kill all the enemies

1602
06:47:56,119 --> 06:48:03,209
within the time limit i mean this is the final one might as well do it

1603
06:48:03,930 --> 06:48:15,099
may you find 10k per kill but you can't get hit and it's probably three minutes so if you figure

1604
06:48:15,099 --> 06:48:19,819
if you have to not get hit for three minutes sure you might make 500 000 but you have to you can't

1605
06:48:19,819 --> 06:48:52,759
get it for three minutes shit i haven't peed in seven hours i probably should do that yeah after

1606
06:48:52,759 --> 06:49:05,639
this after this i'm gonna go grab some water and yeah i'm just gonna hydrate take pee and we'll

1607
06:49:05,639 --> 06:49:20,389
come back and we'll finish up the game after this though mission start so this is baseball

1608
06:49:21,189 --> 06:49:38,020
is it baseball it's not baseball oh no it's just no

1609
06:49:43,110 --> 06:50:00,900
you hear that audio too much blood he's not gonna pee till next year in tonga

1610
06:50:01,540 --> 06:50:52,040
that would be something now wouldn't it that's pretty crunchy can i do it 30 kills

1611
06:51:02,220 --> 06:51:15,419
that's really good too it takes that's one minute for 90 000 that's probably

1612
06:51:16,779 --> 06:51:20,060
that's probably better than more reliable yeah that's more reliable than the bike

1613
06:51:20,700 --> 06:51:34,119
is it 550 okay i also need to let me check the shop just the sword shop i also have to upgrade

1614
06:51:34,119 --> 06:51:53,830
my body yeah talk to the ball guy yeah he's right next to the get it all done here first

1615
06:51:53,830 --> 06:52:06,810
let's go check out the sword stuff actually this is right here isn't it yeah get this done

1616
06:52:21,700 --> 06:52:42,259
that dumpster is unopened bench press one more time 64 000 oh this is kind of tough now

1617
06:52:43,299 --> 06:52:51,610
so here we are 750 people ever recording this video 750 people are now subscribed to the channel

1618
06:52:52,250 --> 06:53:19,500
found the same site thank you so much it got deleted it got deleted right let me say and

1619
06:53:20,220 --> 06:53:45,479
squats wait i do appreciate little mini games like this like sort of san andreas style of

1620
06:53:45,479 --> 06:53:52,139
have an open world in a gym but i really wish that each one of these you had to do them faster

1621
06:53:52,139 --> 06:54:01,580
or something it's the same minigame every time wait for you it's so hard and no more heroes too

1622
06:54:01,580 --> 06:54:17,700
yeah that's the balls too that is you're right it isn't an open dumpster good catch

1623
06:54:29,319 --> 06:54:32,470
giving up on the balls i don't know

1624
06:54:34,409 --> 06:54:54,869
keep practicing shit do i need one more the real question is how much is the upgrade for the

1625
06:54:54,869 --> 06:55:19,060
katana if it's more than three or four hundred thousand i'm not i don't think i'm gonna do it

1626
06:55:28,979 --> 06:55:33,939
no balls if i don't do it single finger on anything something to drink all right weapons

1627
06:55:34,979 --> 06:55:46,409
parts well that has to be a joke 999 a million beam katana energy saving part

1628
06:55:47,369 --> 06:55:59,110
for sabaki mk3 set this into the heart of the motherboard inside the beam it's just

1629
06:55:59,110 --> 06:56:06,810
infinite battery it will never have to be recharged okay all right this one's power

1630
06:56:07,689 --> 06:56:21,349
uh i just i'm gonna do this one yeah this is the best one it's expensive but i'm gonna make it

1631
06:56:22,310 --> 06:56:32,599
one of the germa stream awards are going to actually take place

1632
06:56:34,810 --> 06:56:43,659
so the probably at uh the stream is going to start around six pacific so around nine p.m

1633
06:56:43,659 --> 06:56:48,119
eastern is when it's going to turn on i would assume we'll hang out for like 20 30 minutes

1634
06:56:49,000 --> 06:56:58,490
relax maybe go over some uh red bubble uh scams and probably around 6 30 i'd say

1635
06:56:59,450 --> 06:57:05,459
6 30 6 30 ish we'll probably start doing them probably they won't take more than a couple

1636
06:57:05,459 --> 06:57:10,099
hours like just like last year but i wanted to line up right when we do the last one we can count

1637
06:57:10,099 --> 06:57:15,610
the ball down all right i'm gonna do that mission again that fighting one because it was really

1638
06:57:15,610 --> 06:57:35,939
really good for some reason i we were saying gta grand theft auto and i don't know why you can

1639
06:57:35,939 --> 06:57:40,900
run through every chain link fence in grand theft auto and this game became grand theft auto for five

1640
06:57:40,900 --> 06:58:22,330
seconds i don't know why yeah no way did i just go across the bridge for no reason i did didn't i

1641
06:58:22,889 --> 06:58:41,400
i want a giant goddamn circle wait are we back in single letter emote only mode

1642
06:58:42,200 --> 06:58:56,409
i didn't even say anything we're just doing it this is 90k yeah this is almost 100,000

1643
06:58:57,209 --> 06:59:03,689
then after this i'll do the bike jump like a few times and we should be there

1644
06:59:14,360 --> 06:59:32,490
really good money 250,000 i need 550 i do have increased power though maybe i should try the

1645
06:59:32,490 --> 06:59:51,619
gambling one again right that sounds like a good idea doesn't it done in 20 years i will return

1646
07:00:06,520 --> 07:00:11,240
i love you david i can't wait for that game to come out that games we're gonna

1647
07:00:11,880 --> 07:00:15,080
hey prediction that game is going to be one of the best games come out in 2020 prediction

1648
07:00:15,959 --> 07:00:38,439
um derma i'm on a joke withdrawal i need a joke to fuel my addiction well you don't don't just

1649
07:00:38,439 --> 07:00:46,520
don't be don't we did it to jokes there's this two sides to the mask it's comedy and tragedy

1650
07:00:47,240 --> 07:00:55,029
it's not it's not just it's not comedy and comedy by the way those people just disintegrated he can't

1651
07:00:55,029 --> 07:01:12,979
even spawn what you're asking for is the equivalent of picking out all the grain cereal in lucky

1652
07:01:13,060 --> 07:01:33,299
charms not just only marshmallows man you can't just you do that yeah that's a mistake

1653
07:01:34,180 --> 07:01:50,069
i want to take this fully powered up sword into the gamble one i could probably get 150,000 easy

1654
07:01:51,669 --> 07:02:16,950
what version is this this is the original version being emulated through dolphin on his fake we

1655
07:02:18,380 --> 07:02:27,860
no every time every time somebody asks it's been i own it it's behind me

1656
07:02:40,380 --> 07:03:09,419
emulators are illegal when the president does something it's not illegal let's do a jump

1657
07:03:11,819 --> 07:03:16,939
how do i have the control set up in dolphin i have it actually was a this that's a great question

1658
07:03:16,939 --> 07:03:21,259
because anybody that's you know has you know owns a we and owns a copy of the game and emulates

1659
07:03:21,259 --> 07:03:31,819
their own software um the we mode is that it's kind of finicky and what i mean by that is i have

1660
07:03:31,819 --> 07:03:37,830
this is a we motion plus controller but all bluetooth is not made the same apparently

1661
07:03:38,549 --> 07:03:42,310
and even if you think you have oh yeah i've got a bluetooth it connects to your computer with

1662
07:03:42,310 --> 07:03:50,979
bluetooth but even still some bluetooth dongles don't work with it and it can't sync them i had

1663
07:03:50,979 --> 07:03:56,180
an internal i think it's actually the one that i had it was it was it was a qualcomm was the

1664
07:03:56,180 --> 07:04:02,779
bluetooth that i had and it just wouldn't sync with it the dongle that i have that works with it

1665
07:04:03,740 --> 07:04:11,639
is a targus bluetooth dongle that's the one that i'm using it right now it's like a target

1666
07:04:11,639 --> 07:04:18,259
targus 4.0 bluetooth dongle and it will sync if you have the original we motion plus controller

1667
07:04:18,259 --> 07:04:33,860
there's this one i have here usb dongle he's making up words don't use that word that's what

1668
07:04:33,860 --> 07:04:47,459
it's called it's a dongle it's a usb dongle i mean i guess technically it's a usb bluetooth

1669
07:04:47,459 --> 07:04:57,180
adapter but it's a it's a dongle that's what it is and what you do is in the settings in dolphin

1670
07:04:57,180 --> 07:05:02,840
there are obviously ways to connect directly to a real we mode they have it built into the software

1671
07:05:02,840 --> 07:05:09,860
so it's pretty good and again for some of the new viewers that might be here uh just going oh hey

1672
07:05:09,860 --> 07:05:13,619
he's well why is he what's he doing why he's emulating this hold on let me just fucking

1673
07:05:13,619 --> 07:05:25,380
destroy this um this game notoriously runs terribly on the week and the ps3 version is

1674
07:05:26,490 --> 07:05:36,630
not the version that i wanted to play when you have more than a few people on the screen

1675
07:05:37,509 --> 07:05:42,790
especially when you do the blood splatter on three or four people at the same time it can drop down

1676
07:05:42,790 --> 07:05:49,430
to less than 10 frames a second also all the open world stuff on the original week is painful

1677
07:05:51,270 --> 07:06:00,229
riding the motorcycle around town is of rich chugs chug chug chug and it runs at like 480p

1678
07:06:01,819 --> 07:06:18,700
so that's why i've decided to do this how much money do i have 339 all right the gambling

1679
07:06:18,700 --> 07:06:29,509
mission will take care of this and then it's time for the end of the game save your excuses for the

1680
07:06:29,509 --> 07:07:08,310
judge 17 right uh 18 you can do the secret ending um maybe maybe how much longer i i don't think

1681
07:07:08,310 --> 07:07:19,319
i've ever seen the secret thing is it um is it much longer after the game or is it something i

1682
07:07:19,319 --> 07:07:32,860
have to grind out for a while for more than a couple hours go pee or i'm gonna do it oh right

1683
07:07:32,860 --> 07:07:43,529
okay i'll do it after this let's see if this if i if i don't get over 80 on this then i'm gonna

1684
07:07:43,529 --> 07:08:05,419
be very upset because i have the maximum power upgrade tried to do it i waved just didn't pick

1685
07:08:05,419 --> 07:09:19,180
it up so fuck dude go pee i'm gonna be i'm fine oh no no no no it's over battery that's good you're

1686
07:09:19,180 --> 07:09:26,819
all dead all right line it up that's so stupid

1687
07:09:28,740 --> 07:10:07,959
42 i can do better than that i'm tired of my arm you know before you said that i didn't notice this

1688
07:10:09,000 --> 07:10:14,520
but i'm no now i do notice that my arm hurts i've noticed that now my arm does hurt

1689
07:10:15,720 --> 07:10:19,610
i've been kind of doing these motions for the last two straight days

1690
07:10:20,569 --> 07:10:52,099
there's too much key building on imagine that were real line it up yes

1691
07:10:53,939 --> 07:11:16,090
i might get over 100 if i'm good it's too late for 100

1692
07:11:22,659 --> 07:11:51,400
not even 88 126 i'm almost there it's getting late too what is it 2 a.m eastern 524 all right one

1693
07:11:52,360 --> 07:12:13,529

1694
07:12:15,750 --> 07:12:22,360
we'll probably finish up we'll finish up within the hour i can't imagine how this full area

1695
07:12:23,560 --> 07:12:27,240
and another boss will take more than a full hour i don't think so

1696
07:12:28,360 --> 07:12:51,349
i don't i need to do the jump one more time that would be 50k thermos dongle doesn't work like it

1697
07:12:51,349 --> 07:13:19,500
used to nice nice good good one why would i read that because my brain is a scrambled egg

1698
07:13:20,060 --> 07:13:37,830
and just says things out loud i don't know why i don't think nothing to compare to the dream

1699
07:13:37,830 --> 07:13:48,279
sequence from seven hours ago will germa read anything that's highlighted pretty much

1700
07:13:51,209 --> 07:14:20,650
yeah yeah i tried to hit that person and it was bad for me

1701
07:14:32,229 --> 07:14:36,979
nancy drew games of shovelware knockoffs of professor leighton games

1702
07:14:37,939 --> 07:14:44,569
i have some really bad news for you nancy drew series redates professor leighton by about

1703
07:14:45,529 --> 07:15:03,750
probably 25 years nancy drew and the golden shoe came out in what like 1996

1704
07:15:03,750 --> 07:15:31,959
oh that was a bad one 1982 yeah at least the leighton games are actually fun

1705
07:15:32,759 --> 07:15:40,470
i played the leighton games at least one of them whatever one they ported to the ipad i've played

1706
07:15:40,470 --> 07:16:01,939
it that's not a real leighton game how is it not whatever the first one is professor leighton in

1707
07:16:01,939 --> 07:16:19,880
the golden shoe it's one of the first ones why didn't i call this number in the first place

1708
07:16:20,040 --> 07:16:33,159
yes hello ask who's calling this is the assassin's association right look i gotta talk to you about

1709
07:16:34,680 --> 07:16:42,119
she's done it again hasn't she hey are you listening excuse me for asking but are you by

1710
07:16:42,119 --> 07:16:50,599
chance an assassin whoa don't tell the whole world then you have been had sir you are not her first

1711
07:16:50,599 --> 07:16:53,400
it's a fake association

1712
07:16:57,639 --> 07:17:01,720
listen lady i don't know what the hell you're talking about who are you anyway

1713
07:17:04,119 --> 07:17:11,720
but here's the thing if it's a fake association and you've convinced a hundred people

1714
07:17:11,720 --> 07:17:17,240
that they're part of a assassin association and you have rankings and they actually are ranked

1715
07:17:17,720 --> 07:17:25,479
do you know how many isn't it real she is a professional you mean a fraud are you telling

1716
07:17:25,479 --> 07:17:34,090
me this was all just bullshit she set everything up would you mind telling real fake assassins

1717
07:17:34,970 --> 07:17:46,169
since you've come this far are you serious what's the point this is all some make-believe charade

1718
07:17:46,169 --> 07:17:53,049
but a good man finishes what he started fight to the end your most formidable opponent awaits

1719
07:17:53,049 --> 07:18:06,459
in the castle now off to the garden of madness is it oh yeah the entry fees she's collecting

1720
07:18:06,459 --> 07:18:16,299
entry fees from those 11 12 15 20 potential people we still have to kill each other

1721
07:18:16,299 --> 07:18:21,500
and we've agreed that that person is higher in rank than us so we have actually just made an

1722
07:18:21,500 --> 07:19:00,810
assassin's league let's just sure the entry fee makes no sense cut out the middleman all right

1723
07:19:00,810 --> 07:19:17,700
gene this is the last time i'm going to be able to play with you okay let's look at the cards for

1724
07:19:17,700 --> 07:19:49,959
the last time cool missed a couple oh i like this one and this one and that's it darth vader

1725
07:19:53,419 --> 07:20:18,490
good thing i've got the dash call the bike uh now my friends has had enough of my shit

1726
07:20:29,180 --> 07:20:37,319
this is dumb though what's the point of doing this there really is no point in this segment here

1727
07:20:39,860 --> 07:20:58,549
it's just this is kind of annoying that's all oh i got how far away is that how far away is this

1728
07:20:58,549 --> 07:21:06,439
is it worth doing it's right there all right it's right here and then i'm gonna pee i promise

1729
07:21:07,080 --> 07:21:40,220
which one should i get what do you want a ball let's teach techniques displays the position

1730
07:21:41,340 --> 07:21:49,659
of somebody said hold c to make it go faster it's not working uh despite the position enemies allow

1731
07:21:49,659 --> 07:22:01,380
you to jump and slash cool okay extends your dark side now increases the range of your grab

1732
07:22:01,380 --> 07:22:10,490
that's pretty good earned bonuses based on now too late in the game allows a jumping down attack

1733
07:22:11,130 --> 07:22:25,979
probably this one grab range is good jump slash might be good too jumping slash

1734
07:22:26,139 --> 07:22:42,169
dash yeah let's do it technique of love

1735

you know uh your edge can be poison or cure to be learned is the path and to be ignorant is also

1766
07:37:47,419 --> 07:37:54,139
the path your path your path is that path that no one nothing can pass yet the path reach on

1767
07:37:54,779 --> 07:37:58,220
devotion is only given to those who perfect single thing reward them

1768
07:37:59,419 --> 07:38:05,099
no reward those who do not perfect does it reward or just evil lie down your path

1778
07:40:22,729 --> 07:40:45,880
phone here we go you're in the shrek outhouse i wonder how what the reaction in this chat would

1779
07:40:45,880 --> 07:40:51,639
be if shrek was the last boss somehow they made it happen and it was only in this game there was

1780
07:40:51,639 --> 07:40:56,759
some weird coincidence two of the executives of best friends or something and what would happen

1781
07:40:56,759 --> 07:41:08,810
what would people do like you know how a snake made it into smash brothers one of those scenarios

1782
07:41:25,669 --> 07:41:40,419
funny green man and it wasn't some kind of copycat voice actor it was mike myers

1783
07:41:40,419 --> 07:41:57,619
with original lines welcome to my castle i heartily receive you my son all right enough with the jokes

1784
07:41:58,500 --> 07:42:05,700

1785
07:42:05,700 --> 07:42:29,580
thanks you are full of it aren't you dark star it's a good story i'll give you that much

1786
07:42:30,939 --> 07:42:36,619
that thing's really difficult to use story that's not practical if you were my father it doesn't

1787
07:42:36,619 --> 07:42:44,139
matter the only thing that matters here is who's best remember son engraved into your memory is

1788
07:42:44,139 --> 07:42:52,220
the night when everything changed i fell to my feet right before my son's eyes do you not remember

1789
07:42:52,220 --> 07:43:03,619
this in my deepest memories i hear someone calling i remember it was a hot summer day

1790
07:43:04,259 --> 07:43:10,180
there was someone standing behind my father and mother that person killed my parents the

1791
07:43:10,580 --> 07:43:20,470
i can't make it out who are you remember who are you try harder i think i can see it

1792
07:43:24,169 --> 07:43:34,150
gamer posture now son she was the girl you loved

1793
07:43:43,319 --> 07:43:48,680
all right for one second i thought his sword went all the way behind him and stabbed him through

1794
07:43:48,680 --> 07:43:53,720
the pelvis because it was so unruly they couldn't get i told you the fucking weapon was bad at least

1795
07:43:53,720 --> 07:44:01,849
not anymore you killed him didn't you yes and that's why you became an assassin to kill me

1796
07:44:02,569 --> 07:44:06,090
now i get it all those fights it was for this

1797
07:44:14,180 --> 07:44:24,409
i can help you to get even she's a good con artist that's for sure she set up some killer fights

1798
07:44:24,490 --> 07:44:32,139
so you and i finally meet you should thank silvia jean there's just one thing i want to ask you

1799
07:44:32,860 --> 07:44:40,069
who are you me you don't need to know all of your trivial questions will be answered in the

1800
07:44:40,069 --> 07:44:48,069
afterlife answer me it's impossible impossible what do you mean it's too terrible it alone would

1801
07:44:48,069 --> 07:44:54,549
jack up the age rating of this game even further so what who cares what if the game gets delayed

1802
07:44:54,549 --> 07:44:58,869
you don't want this to become no more heroes forever just being emulated right doesn't matter

1803
07:44:58,869 --> 07:45:05,430
fast forward this so you can tell me okay i'll make it short and quick this ain't other way any

1804
07:45:33,779 --> 07:45:36,900
no it's not an emulation it's not an emulation error

1805
07:45:44,279 --> 07:45:51,479
maybe it had to be done but vengeance begets vengeance i hope it doesn't stay like this go ahead

1806
07:45:55,159 --> 07:46:27,619

1854
08:04:16,299 --> 08:04:22,459
about it's my brother yeah of course it is what the hell the craziest shit i've ever heard why

1855
08:04:22,459 --> 08:04:27,419
would you bring up something like that at the very last minute of the game i would have thought you

1856
08:04:28,060 --> 08:04:30,619
would have at least expected a twist of fate of some kind

1857
08:04:32,459 --> 08:04:37,979
and hey where's silvia anyway she disappeared without a trace where the hell is she

1858
08:04:40,139 --> 08:04:48,540
you mean my wife what wife yes you know spouse soulmate they really they really threw it all

1859
08:04:48,540 --> 08:04:55,180
away in the last 40 minutes here addressing the audience ten years ago fast boarding because we

1860
08:04:55,180 --> 08:05:02,759
were both in college at the time shit all news to me i'm gonna need shock treatment to get over

1861
08:05:02,759 --> 08:05:11,369
this one i'm sorry for all the trouble my wife has caused you forgive her she caused me some

1862
08:05:11,369 --> 08:05:17,450
trouble all right but it helped me clear up a lot of things you know how women are especially my

1863
08:05:17,450 --> 08:05:23,770
wife a really big spender yeah she knew my income wasn't enough so every now and then she just

1864
08:05:23,770 --> 08:05:32,709
disappear she's a bad wife but a good woman are you telling me that you and her oh come on

1865
08:05:36,900 --> 08:05:39,220
we're similar in many ways

1866
08:05:43,380 --> 08:05:47,459
you're right face too suddenly you being my brother doesn't sound so awkward

1867
08:05:50,099 --> 08:05:53,540
let me ask you how do you plan to put an end to all of this

1868
08:05:54,340 --> 08:06:00,340
wait a sec you want me to tie up all these loose ends i don't think so you're the protagonist i'm

1869
08:06:00,340 --> 08:06:07,139
just a cool handsome foil who happens to be your twin brother hate to say it but it's your job

1870
08:06:07,860 --> 08:06:11,860
i want to bail but where the hell's the exit there's no way out is there

1871
08:06:11,939 --> 08:06:16,659
no getting out right bro this is like a shitty metal gear solid cut scene

1872
08:06:17,220 --> 08:06:19,540
then let's find that exit they call paradise

1873
08:06:23,580 --> 08:06:32,970
let's go and that imagine looking out your window and seeing that yeah you look out your

1874
08:06:32,970 --> 08:06:43,369
window you see two guys just running by with lightsabers did they both die at the same time

1875
08:06:44,169 --> 08:06:47,450
well there's no more heroes too so i'm gonna have to say i'm sorry the answer is no

1876
08:06:52,619 --> 08:07:20,119
don't skip i'm not gonna skip the credits two is not canon i mean it is yes it is three is not

1877
08:07:20,119 --> 08:07:33,479
canon three is canon they're all canon even the top down one is canon doesn't the travis strikes

1878
08:07:33,479 --> 08:07:44,520
again set up the third game in a way i'm fairly certain there's introductions to people in them

1879
08:07:44,520 --> 08:07:54,470
well we're gonna have to play it gonna have to do it eventually before the new one comes out

1880
08:08:06,580 --> 08:08:10,259
why would they preemptively make a numbered sequel non-canon yeah that doesn't mean

1881
08:08:11,700 --> 08:08:30,090
travis strikes again is a half of visual novel is it i thought it was like a top down

1882
08:08:31,860 --> 08:08:41,500
bullet hell type game we still have a sword but isn't it really twitchy and it is top down

1883
08:08:42,139 --> 08:08:55,060
play killer seven as well now here you go here are the voice actors dd bradley baker told you

1884
08:08:55,060 --> 08:09:17,270
it was the fish killer seven killer seven's on the game cube right it's on steam when did they

1885
08:09:17,270 --> 08:09:34,549
put it on steam oh shit okay is it a good port or is it crappy it's good it's all right it's

1886
08:09:34,549 --> 08:09:53,619
good good good for it's pretty good all right i'll play it it's also on the switch it's not on the

1887
08:09:53,619 --> 08:10:10,099
switch as far wait iirc the port is literally just dolphin running the emulator is it really

1888
08:10:11,060 --> 08:10:29,159
that's pretty funny if it's that's true it's not it's not that was the trailer the footage

1889
08:10:29,159 --> 08:10:37,700
they used for the trailer was dolphin footage but the actual port isn't huh that's crazy

1890
08:10:38,340 --> 08:10:56,950
google is a powerful tool yeah it is all right everyone here we go post credit

1891
08:11:05,110 --> 08:11:29,959
don't you let's go gene why everybody named gene i know too bad there won't be a sequel

1892
08:11:29,959 --> 08:11:45,259
yes there will actually uh it never was supposed to be a series according to suda right so didn't

1893
08:11:45,259 --> 08:11:48,619
sort of say that this was supposed to be a one-off thing and he was never supposed to make any other

1894
08:11:48,619 --> 08:12:08,970
games that's actually real that's actually to be continued shit my wiimote got disconnected

1895
08:12:08,970 --> 08:12:27,779
oh i gotta sync this back up play the uh the other ending can i see the other ending anywhere

1896
08:12:27,779 --> 08:13:01,220
that's not on youtube all right also i think i've unlocked the hard difficulty right sweet mild

1897
08:13:01,220 --> 08:13:15,209
bitter extremely difficult many strong men await you perfect for beginners bitter does anything

1898
08:13:15,209 --> 08:13:31,639
change in new game plus it's just harder everything has more health and does more damage

1899
08:13:34,150 --> 08:13:47,720
you keep your money in your katana so what do you spend your money on on snake skin oh clothes i

1900
08:13:47,720 --> 08:13:55,029
guess sure i'm just curious to how hard the default enemies are on the hardest difficulty

1901
08:13:55,830 --> 08:14:14,540
well not bad considering i have the best weapon available but if i don't do new game plus i

1902
08:14:14,540 --> 08:14:27,909
actually can just start on bitter right yes you can okay cool all right well that's uh that's

1935
08:19:55,240 --> 08:20:04,599
streams in 2019 that were that required to hire people and resources and that shit is only possible

1936
08:20:06,549 --> 08:20:16,069
because of the support that this channel gets that's that that doesn't happen without

1937
08:20:16,950 --> 08:20:21,509
this ridiculous amount of money that some people give the continued subscriptions that people have

1938
08:20:21,509 --> 08:20:37,799
on this channel i'm not i can't do those things without it so seriously 2019 was crazy we'll talk

08:21:30,330 --> 08:21:35,610
set you can assign a move to each button basically if you want to drop kick on triangle you can put

1947
08:21:35,610 --> 08:21:41,930
it there or maybe on x and put an uppercut on triangle etc there's a casino that actually

1948
08:21:41,930 --> 08:21:48,470
functions and the composer is the same one as the one from this game the reason you didn't like god

1949
08:21:48,470 --> 08:21:54,549
hand is because you were exhausted and frustrated by a bunch of throwaway ps2 games that you were

1950
08:21:54,549 --> 08:21:59,830
rushing through that night god hand needs a single full-length stream dedicated to it back me up here

08:32:21,720 --> 08:32:28,360

2015
08:32:28,360 --> 08:32:47,159
cancer center in boston from what i've been told so far that's the plan sponsoring running a marathon

2016
08:32:48,119 --> 08:32:56,009
is yeah i think the way that the boston marathon works is you uh i don't i don't want to speak

2017
08:32:56,009 --> 08:33:04,520
completely out of place here but i'm fairly certain it's uh you raise money for a charity

2018
08:33:06,759 --> 08:33:14,040
and then you run in the marathon for that charity i guess something like that i'm not sure if every

2019
08:33:14,040 --> 08:33:26,630
single person that runs the marathon has to do that but i know that's what people do my god's in

2020
08:33:26,630 --> 08:33:37,479
the chat holy shit that's that's horrible i look like i made it a raw chicken meat this is disgusting

2023
08:34:10,009 --> 08:34:14,729
bits appreciate thank you bloody punker for the 500 bits hey germ i've been dealing with a lot

2024
08:34:14,729 --> 08:34:19,770
of insecurity and paranoia around dumb stuff like my voice as you have a background in voice acting

2025
08:34:19,770 --> 08:34:22,490
and bring life to countless funny characters with you i was thinking you'd be a good guy to

2026
08:34:22,490 --> 08:34:33,720
ask about experiences the vocal insecurity tips about overcoming it thanks pretty much that when

2027
08:34:33,720 --> 08:34:38,759
you first start talking to people and you hear you i'm not sure if you're talking about

2028
08:34:38,759 --> 08:34:45,750
referencing hearing your voice back but when anytime anybody listens to themselves back

2029
08:34:45,750 --> 08:34:52,169
they all you always sound a little weird you sound that's me i don't like that everybody has this

2030
08:34:52,169 --> 08:34:59,049
weird um sort of it not that i doubt that they hate your voice or anything but everybody seems

2031
08:34:59,049 --> 08:35:06,299
to have that sort of you squint your eyes when you hear yourself talking but it just takes time it

2032
08:35:06,299 --> 08:35:16,630
just takes a while i mean at this point you just kind of know the way you talk and after a while

2033
08:35:16,630 --> 08:35:20,709
if you hear yourself back enough times and you just accept the fact that that's just the way you

2034
08:35:20,709 --> 08:35:33,900
sound you become okay with hearing it back if you go back and watch my first maybe 10 to 20

2035
08:35:33,900 --> 08:35:45,830
youtube videos i was trying to sound better i was trying to sound smarter and more intelligent and

2036
08:35:45,830 --> 08:35:53,340
better and and and more articulated and after about 10 videos or 20 videos or so it's just like i

2037
08:35:53,340 --> 08:35:56,299
kind of just know the way i just talk like this this is the way that i talk and that's it this

2038
08:35:56,299 --> 08:36:05,220
this is just what you get this is how i speak but for dealing with the actual insecurity on

2039
08:36:05,220 --> 08:36:19,590
your voice i wouldn't read too much into it to be honest we communicate this way i can't think of

2040
08:36:19,590 --> 08:36:25,509
the last time that i heard somebody talk to me or somebody was giving a presentation or doing

2041
08:36:25,509 --> 08:36:31,029
vocal work and i thought even for a second about hey that that doesn't sound right no that's just

2042
08:36:31,029 --> 08:36:36,919
you that's who that's your voice that's you and that's good that's fine everyone has a different

2043
08:36:36,919 --> 08:37:03,240
voice the guy from the servers okay server germa but yeah it's that that's who you are that's how

08:39:42,970 --> 08:39:56,470
to shop at home depot after watching this ad with me together or did you all tab into a different

2064

screen and mute my stream maybe eight of you watched it and zero of you are gonna go there

2065
08:40:14,340 --> 08:40:29,900
for all i know half of you might not even be old enough to hold a hammer how old do you have to be

2066
08:40:29,900 --> 08:40:38,919
to hold a hammer what would you say what age would you say is i am comfortable with this person

2067
08:40:40,040 --> 08:40:52,619
using a hammer i'm gonna say i'm gonna say at least at least 15 to 16

2068
08:40:53,909 --> 08:40:59,750
i would not be comfortable with some with like a 12 or 13 year old you with a hammer and nails

2069
08:41:00,869 --> 08:41:13,590
i'm gonna say like 16 dude like six not you wouldn't get a six-year-old a hammer

2070
08:41:15,299 --> 08:41:28,680
are you are you out of your mind if they're being supervised well 10 um i would say at least like

2071
08:41:28,680 --> 08:41:35,849
13 and people get their driving permits at 15 yeah so if you can't if you can drive a car

if you're scared of flying the best thing for you to know and i'm gonna i'm gonna spit out a

2141
08:52:51,270 --> 08:52:57,110
incredibly inaccurate statement here but i know that there's an accurate one somewhere

2142
08:52:58,970 --> 08:53:07,180
i'm gonna paraphrase this accuracy it's something like you are 500,000 times

2143
08:53:08,220 --> 08:53:17,770
more likely to be injured in a car than ever in an airplane like you are more you're more likely to

2144
08:53:17,770 --> 08:53:26,540
get bit by a great white shark than have anything happen or go wrong on an airplane it's not that

2145
08:53:26,540 --> 08:53:39,529
much but the gist is true right that's somewhere in there paraphrased oh they're not they're not

2146
08:53:39,529 --> 08:53:46,889
afraid of flying i'm flying out of state for university and i'm scared oh fly like flying

2147
08:53:46,889 --> 08:53:52,090
like you're okay different topic entirely all right different topic entire so you're flying

2148
08:53:52,090 --> 08:53:58,090
out of state and uh don't be nervous be excited because that's a new experience you're gonna meet

2149
08:53:58,090 --> 08:54:03,880

2150

forward to reading it also you've you're 300,000 times more likely to be eaten by a great white

2151
08:54:10,229 --> 08:54:22,790

2164
08:55:56,869 --> 08:56:01,430
ace attorney it was originally on the wii shop you play without the flashing white screens

2165
08:56:02,310 --> 08:56:07,270
i even tested this and can confirm that at least the first case has no flashing

2166
08:56:08,310 --> 08:56:12,409
hopefully this can give you a chance to play it even if it's not on stream

really no flashing even if it's not on stream by the steam version i think the steam version
