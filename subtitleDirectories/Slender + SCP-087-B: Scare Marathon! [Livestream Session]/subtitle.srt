1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,500
Open up, please. I'm gonna have to lower the volume on it, too, because it is pretty loud.

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:19,179
Oh, I'm already getting the chills. And Abracadabra, can you see it? I hope so.

3
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:29,699
I think you can. Oh, I gotta get the chat up here. I cannot hit escape, though. That's one,

4
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:43,740
the one big thing. Cannot hit escape. So I can see what you guys are saying. There's that.

5
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:57,130
Oh no, the chat just can't fit anywhere. Hold on, can I move this? I can. Excellent. Here we are.

6
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:16,980
One more second, guys. This here. Perfect. Perfect. Now I can see what everybody's saying.

7
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:29,129
Time to play Slender. Oh boy, oh boy. So the goal here tonight, guys, is I'm gonna try

8
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,819
and get all the pages. I'm gonna try and beat this game. I'm gonna do it.

9
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:50,489
Let's go! Gonna beat Slender. I'm gonna beat Slender. Definitely not gonna beat Slender,

10
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:56,010
because it is like impossible to beat. Because once you get like seven pages,

11
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:04,340
he just eats your soul. All right, here comes page one, guys. Welcome to the Scare Stream.

12
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:11,460
Happy preliminary Halloween. Let's do... Oh, wait. Hold on. Oh, that just ruined my whole entrance.

13
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:20,360
I hit E, not click. Here we go. I only have the headphone in one ear. I know. You can call me

14
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:31,530
whatever you want to call me. I thought I just saw him. I thought I just saw him. I'm gonna try

15
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,129
to upload this to YouTube, so if you are gonna miss some of this, I'm gonna try and get the whole

16
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:41,719
thing up there. If you're watching this on YouTube, hey, what's up? How you doing? Did I just walk in

17
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:52,870
like a circle? All right, let's see. I'm not looking behind me. Everyone's like, oh, behind you,

18
00:02:52,870 --> 00:03:07,340
behind you. I ain't looking behind me. I need to go left. Whoa, I hear static. Where is he? I hear

19
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,889
static right now. Where the hell is he? I hear static right now. Where is he? He's probably right

20
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:21,990
there. What? Where is he? I don't even know where he is. I don't know where the hell he is. Where is

21
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:33,219
he? Oh, my God. Where is he? He's probably like right... If I... Ready? He's right there. He's right

22
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:37,780
there. He's right there. Run to the tree. Run to the tree. Run to the tree. Run to the tree. The tree

23
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:45,509
of life. Don't look for him. You have... But that's the thing. You have to look for him. You have to

24
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:53,270
like turn and look. Hello, page two. He's... As long as I know where he is, he's fine. He's right behind

25
00:03:53,270 --> 00:04:00,840
me. He's right up my ass. I'll tell you a thing or two, slender man. You want to mess with me?

26
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:08,550
I'll give you the one, two... Why am I taking my hands off? I'm like... Oh, let me make like a joke

27
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:19,399
and die. That's a great idea, Jeremiah. Is there anything on here? Can I like go in there and go

28
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,860
to the bathroom? I thought he was like right there. Come on, get three. Go. He's still behind me. I

29
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:38,180
know exactly where he is. I wish I could run. Damn. I wish I could sprint. I can sprint now.

30
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:50,410
I love reading the chat. It's so fun. I can't believe I said I was going to beat this game.

31
00:04:50,410 --> 00:05:05,029
There's no way I'm going to beat this game. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Did I just walk in

32
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:13,209
a giant circle? No, there's... I can't even see. Yeah, that's the next part. I got to go there.

33
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:18,949
You needed something to fall asleep to. Larry, I'm sorry. This is what you have to fall asleep to.

34
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:32,069
It would be tough if I was you. Slender and SCP containment breach. See, it's good having you guys

35
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:36,949
here in the chat because when I play this game alone, whenever I play like scary games alone,

36
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:44,389
there's not a whole lot... It's so terrifying. I can't... I'm much better looking over and seeing

37
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:51,579
all you guys in the chat. It makes it so much better because now I won't crap my pants,

38
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:57,129
except I already did in the first 30 seconds of this game starting. I'm scared right now.

39
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:24,550
My teeth are chattering. There was no indication that that was going to happen.

40
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:40,259
One down. It's like only three more games to play. Oh, man. That hurt my whole body. I thought it

41
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:52,470
was supposed to play static whenever it gets close to you. Jeez. All right. We're going to do this

42
00:06:52,470 --> 00:07:07,480
again. Let me load it up again. We're doing Slender again. Yes, of course I want to run it.

43
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:20,540
Honestly, like that, I really did not think that he was there. I really did not think he was there.

44
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:29,579
How does that look? No, I didn't want to do that. I wanted to go to here. Okay, looks fine.

45
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:43,860
Not big surprise. All right, looks good. Let's go. Drag you over here. See, the bad part about

46
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,699
these SCP and Slender and stuff, if you try to hit escape or get to a menu or something,

47
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:56,089
you just close the game. So you have to be a little weird with it. Try to keep it on the

48
00:07:56,089 --> 00:08:03,209
side and drag the chat over. Hey, do I want a hug? Yeah, I do. Especially after that. All right,

49
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:07,449
what'd I get? Three pages? Four pages? Yeah, that was great. Great job, Jeremy. You did a great job

50
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:20,810
there. All right, I got to get ready for this one. Last time I was stupid and I turned around

51
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:31,240
and looked at him and said, hello, page one. All right, I got to think of a plan of action here

52
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:38,779
before I pick this up. Where's the page? What the hell? Okay, there's the page one. I'm going

53
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:45,419
to go straight through here. No, wait, do I want to go there? Or straight down there? Let's see.

54
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:54,980
I'm going to go straight down there. Here we go. Ready? Go. You can't run. You can't hide. You

55
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:03,909
can't get away from the Shenderman. Do I already hear static? I think I already hear still. No,

56
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:07,269
I don't. Oh, great. Good thing I decided to run into a fence. Now I'm going to turn around. He's

57
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:28,330
going to be right there. Cool. Great. I shouldn't have ran. That was a dumb idea. I should have

58
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:34,440
sprinted. Oh, you know what I wish? I wish there was a stamina bar. Somebody said the

59
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,600
stamina is like, it's hard to read. I wish there was a bar right there, like right on the screen

60
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,659
that said, oh, you have like this percentage or this amount. I just walked in a circle.

61
00:09:53,669 --> 00:10:00,779
Man, I hate this. I hate this guy. Where's like the gun so I can turn around and just

62
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:09,190
just unload on his and touch static or is that water? I don't think there's water in this game.

63
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:16,539
Oh, is that water or static? There's no water. I'm not looking behind me. I'm not making that

64
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:25,990
same mistake. See, last time I looked behind me, that was a massive mistake. What are you guys

65
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:32,919
saying? Let's see. Strafe jump. You can jump in this game. I don't think you could jump. I thought

66
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:38,259
that was him right there, by the way, like whatever the hell that is. Oh, we have some moss on the

67
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:47,820
tree that's painted just like Slenderman's body. No, I'm not looking behind me. Don't ever look

68
00:10:47,820 --> 00:11:00,330
behind you. Worst idea. You know, it's people that talk about the spy and Slenderman. Think about it.

69
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,919
He's in a suit. He has like no face. He's got like a mask on or whatever. I don't know. Maybe

70
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:13,850
doesn't have a mask on, but tall guy in a suit that gets behind you. Slenderman is a spy. What?

71
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:23,460
I hate being in here. Get. Oh, hi. Fantastic. How you doing, man? Good to meet you. Get me

72
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,659
out of this hellhole of a bathroom. I don't even care. Screw that frigging paper. I don't even

73
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:33,480
care. I'll lose the game. I don't even, I don't even want to be in there. If I get stuck in there

74
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:43,210
with him, I, I'm dead. It's over. I'm dead. I'm so dead right now. I'm going to back up right into

75
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,679
him and it's going to scare me. I'm not going to get scared. I'm not going to get scared this time.

76
00:11:46,679 --> 00:12:05,529
I'm going to look him right in his eyes. Run. I'm going to get, I'm going to spit that out.

77
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:08,730
I was, if he jumped at me right there, I would have spit that all over my screen and the stream

78
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:22,389
would have had to like end. Getting stuck on trees now. That's not cool. Probably right behind me.

79
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:33,539
It's going to make that noise. Move faster. You piece of. Oh, there's so many things I could say

80
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:42,419
right now. I don't even know what adjective to use. What's, what's somebody say? Jerma is Slenderman.

81
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:47,740
I don't know. I don't even know what that said. I'm too scared. There's another one right here.

82
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:57,419
He's probably this asshole is probably going to be standing right here. I wish I could just take

83
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:05,370
my headphone out and not have to hear this music. I'm going to have to turn around. Yeah. I got to

84
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:25,340
turn around. Great. Is that him? No, it's not. Go. I'm going to, I can't look. I seriously can't

85
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:38,139
look at the screen. He's, he's like to the left of me. He's like right there. And I, I need to go

86
00:13:38,139 --> 00:14:00,620
that way. This is the worst, especially because I can't run anymore. This is it for Slender. I

87
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:07,110
can't take Slender anymore. It's, it's, I can't take it anymore. He's, he's, when he's going to,

88
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:17,860
you know what, you ready for this guys? I'm going to run right at him. Wait, no, no, no. Opening,

89
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,549
opening. Make sure, you know, we're going to just, we're going to check. We're going to do a quick

90
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:29,769
check. Hey, where are you? You're right behind me. Yep. He's right behind me. You know, now I'm not

91
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:35,509
so scared because I know the son of a bitch is right behind me and he's a slow slug. He ain't

92
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:48,730
catching up to me. Good luck catching up to me. I got legs. I can run. He has legs too. What's

93
00:14:48,730 --> 00:15:00,950
that? Okay. Definitely still right behind me. I'm going to grab it. Oh my God. I can feel him

94
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:10,980
behind me. Is there a note there? I don't even care. I can't even turn to look and see if there's

95
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:27,960
a note. I think there is. What if I do this? No, I just got to keep moving. Oh, there's another

96
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:50,149
note. I see it. Is that a note? It is. Okay, good. Grab the note. Grab the note. Hey, can't run. Yeah,

97
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,269
I wish I had more stamina. Oh, is that him? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

98
00:15:53,269 --> 00:16:08,519
know. I don't know. Who knows? I don't know, man. Did I already get the one on the tree? I don't

99
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:23,019
remember. I don't know if I got the one on the tree. I don't think I did. Go. I don't want to

100
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:37,740
turn around to grab this. Got it. Hello. It's going to do it. He's right here. He's right here. I

101
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:49,539
knew it. See? I told you. I knew it. I knew it. I could feel him. I could feel him like right

102
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:59,340
up my... He was grabbing onto my butt cheeks and squeezing them. That's like how much I felt him.

103
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:12,230
Slender Man. I'll punch Slender Man in his Slender face. I'll knock his teeth out. All right. I

104
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:20,009
can't play Slender Man anymore. I can't play you anymore. I got to move on to Containment Breach.

105
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:36,759
We'll play Containment Breach. Actually, Containment Breach is probably worse than Slender.

106
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:52,279
Containment Breach. All right. This game is loud as hell. Memory access violation. What the hell

107
00:17:52,279 --> 00:18:09,849
does that mean? Memory access violation. I'll give you a violation. I'll like park my car at

108
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:15,029
double parking after seven o'clock and I'll get a violation. I'll show you. That was a bad joke.

109
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:26,150
I apologize for that one. All right. Looks like we're playing SCP-087-B. It's next up on the list.

110
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:37,420
Next up on the list. Let's do it. Here we go. Oh, wow. This is loud. This is loud. Got to turn you

111
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:47,829
down. Oh, God. Ow, my head. Wow. That's loud. You are loud as hell. Wow. Sorry about that.

112
00:18:48,549 --> 00:19:11,509
That was bad. That was loud. Hey, hold on a second. That was weird. That was weird.

113
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:17,109
Hold on. Yeah. I'm going to turn it down the window. Was that loud for all you guys too?

114
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:29,019
That was like, I felt like somebody shot me in the side of the head. Okay. I can turn it down

115
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:36,920
from here. All right. Let's do this again. In fact, hell no. I'm going to turn this all the way down.

116
00:19:46,630 --> 00:20:03,509
Can I open that up? Open up. All right. Oh, can I, I gotta, no, no. Why am I stuck again? What in the

117
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:18,390
name of God? It keeps on locking up my mouse and I can't change anything. Let's see if I can catch

118
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:25,619
it quick. Yeah. I gotta, I gotta hit the, I gotta make direct show go through. I know it's a black

119
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:41,579
screen. I'm sorry. Let's try this again. I gotta catch it right when it pops up. So I need this open

120
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:52,309
and come here. You come here, come here, come here, come here. Oh, I had it. Oh, move over here so I

121
00:20:52,309 --> 00:21:06,119
can catch you quicker. Got it. No, now it's at zero. Damn it. I'll get it. I'll get it. There we go.

122
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:25,019
Okay. Bingo. Bingo. Please proceed with caution. All right. Here we go. Oh, wait, seven B. B is for

123
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:41,980
ball. You know the rest. Going down the stairs. So this is like a hallway simulator and stuff jumps

124
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:57,960
out at you and scares you and it's horrible. I get, we got three. I don't want to go down there.

125
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:14,180
Screw that. Screw that. Oh, eight, seven B. You are now entering. Whoa. Hello. What the hell was that?

126
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,380
It's been a long time since I played. Oh, eight, seven B. So I forget whatever. I forget what

127
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:43,660
happens. It's been a while. Can I, can I just say that we, we, we live in the 21st century.

128
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:51,299
How can you have a radio that sucks that bad? I mean, really, seriously, where did you get that

129
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:56,579
radio? Dude, your radio sucks big time. You might want to replace the batteries. Why is everything

130
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:01,960
getting all weird looking? What's going on? Why is there something, is there something right here?

131
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:16,019
Why, why? Everything's changing. Everything looks like weird now. Maybe I'm just going absolutely

132
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:30,099
crazy. Floor seven. Oh, I don't know how much longer I can do scary games. Oh, hi. Thanks for

133
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:36,500
closing in on me. I appreciate it. Come on. Something jumped out at me. I'm ready. I'm ready.

134
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,779
I'm ready to just, just, just throw up on my screen. Come on. I know what this means. I know

135
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:44,819
what this means. Something's going to happen right now. Something's going to happen right now. I know

136
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:51,140
it. I've been here before. We've been down this road before, man. Yeah. I see you. I see it. I can

137
00:23:51,140 --> 00:24:12,460
see it. What? Yeah. Hi. What was that noise? What is going on? What is going on? I am, I'm ready to

138
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:36,440
just jump and run. Oh, no floor number. No. Okay. Hey, whoa. Hi. Damn man. Come on. Hey, how are

139
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,440
you? How's your, how's your kids and your wife and your, and your son? How's it? I heard he plays

140
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:52,920
baseball now. Good to see him. Yeah. He's growing. He's big. I need the chat's help. Hold on chat.

141
00:24:52,920 --> 00:25:02,970
What do you think? What do I do? All right. Okay. I got, I have the support from the chat. I'm ready.

142
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:10,299
I'm ready to play the game now. Oh, I don't even want to see it. I don't even want to see it. I

143
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:16,460
know it's going to be something to be. Oh, was that a bug? What the hell was that? I don't know

144
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,180
if you could just see that right there, but I did. A bubble just came out of my mouth, a floating like

145
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:34,380
soap bubble. Don't ask me how the hell that happened. God, I'm about to rage quit this game

146
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,700
because I can't handle it because this game I know is horrible when it comes to things jumping at

147
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:52,869
you. What if I just put my head down? Oh man, this is worse than, this is probably worse than slender.

148
00:25:53,509 --> 00:26:01,589
I'm about to hit escape. I'm, my hand is on escape right now. I'm about to just exit the game.

149
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:14,140
It's on, my hand is on escape. The second I see something I don't like it, I'm hitting it.

150
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:24,900
Man, come on, show me something scary so I can just insta quit the game. It's throwing all kinds

151
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:35,220
of noises. Bye. See you later. Have fun. Have fun. Slender man, whatever the, who the hell you are.

152
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:54,819
Did you see that damn thing? It was like right here on the screen. That was hard. That was horrible.

153
00:26:54,819 --> 00:27:15,420
Oh wow. That was so stupid. Oh, all right. Give me a second. That one took a lot out of me right

154
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:31,960
there. Oh, I think I might have to change my pants. Let's see. Let's, let's, let's check. Nope, I'm fine.

155
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:43,210
Oh, all right. I need a break. I need like a five second break. I want to play containment breach. I

156
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:47,400
don't know why I can't get it to load. Hold on. Let me try loading this again. This is, this is stupid.

157
00:27:47,400 --> 00:28:01,900
It should load. Open. Yes, I want you to run. No, why? I had, I ran earlier. Hold on a second. Give me

158
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:24,710
a second. Let me go options. Change this to 1600 by 900. I haven't set to launcher. Let's do launcher.

159
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,619
Okay. I think I got it. I'm going to get it. I got it. I'm going to get it guys. Watch this magic

160
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:40,710
right here. Watch this magic you're about to see right here. Are we ready for the magic?

161
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:48,339
Here comes the magic. Here it comes. And for my next trick, I'm not going to be able to do the

162
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:54,599
magic trick because it still doesn't work. Wait, wait, wait a second. I could get this to a hold

163
00:28:54,599 --> 00:29:16,339
on screen. False launcher enabled. Yeah. I mean like, hello. Of course. Damn it. Yeah. I'm getting

164
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:23,500
that memory access violation, whatever the hell it is. Run it as administrator. Good call. Good call.

165
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,269
Those of you that said that, good call, because that's probably what's going to happen. It's

166
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:36,299
going to work right now. I had this working too. I made sure it worked before I started the stream

167
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:44,180
and it worked. Now it's being a real piece of crap. All right. Run as administrator.

168
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:57,259
And that's what I want. That's what I want. Launch again. That's what I want. Launch. Nope.

169
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:05,799
It's not going to launch. Oh, it looks like I'm going to have to drink a bunch of Dr. Pepper

170
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:19,240
that. I mean, come on. What if I just like freaking puked? How many like, how many like people

171
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,680
you think would want to see that if I was just like, oh yeah, you know, I'm going to say drink

172
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:31,049
some Dr. Pepper. I just like hurled all over the place. I would, I wish I could see something like

173
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:39,720
that. I would laugh my absolute ass off if I got to see something like that. I do. Me, me, me, me.

174
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:47,000
That's so funny. Well, it looks like we're playing contain 087B again, which is my favorite game of

175
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,200
all time. After this, I'm going to play some TF2. So stick around. You're not going to want to miss

176
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:01,460
this. I can't believe I'm loading this game up again. I did not want to play contain 087B again.

177
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:11,240
I wanted to play it once and that was it. I didn't want to have to do this damn game more than once.

178
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:20,140
Here we go. It's going to be like, so I prepare your ears. I'm warning you guys right now, turn

179
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:25,720
your headphones down because I got to catch this. If I don't catch it immediately, then it's going

180
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:33,430
to be an issue. So give me a minute. Let me make sure the face cam is nice and big in the corner.

181
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:44,869
Here we go. I got to make sure the mixer is here. Wait, wait, wait. Why does it say containment

182
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:53,779
breach is in the background? Hold on a second. Hold on a second. One second here. I think the reason

183
00:31:53,859 --> 00:32:00,869
why it's screwing up is because it thinks it's running in the background. Oh, whatever. I don't

184
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:05,450
want to waste your guys' time anymore. You guys have been patient. Let's do it. You guys have been

185
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:21,660
patient. Let's do it. Here we go. Here we go. I'm just stalling as much as I can. Here we go.

186
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:32,700
Super Crate Box? That's a great game. I don't want to click this button. I don't want to play

187
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,700
this game again, but you know what? I'm going to play it again because you have to man up sometimes

188
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:55,940
and do it. So here we go. All right. Please proceed with caution. Please. I'll give you.

189
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:11,480
No, what's this? Oh, Smite. That game's fun. What if I just don't look at the screen once?

190
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:20,809
What the? See you later. Bye. No. No. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.

191
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:35,049
See ya. That's not happening. Did you see that? It just was like, all right, fine. Fine. Fine. We'll

192
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:53,369
do it again. We'll do it again. I don't want two in there. If you missed what just happened,

193
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:57,690
something just flashed on the screen. Like a face just flashed in my face.

194
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:08,059
It looked like the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. What happens if I go down here?

195
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:29,780
What? Third time's a charm, guys. I can't believe it. You gotta be kidding me. Oh,

196
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:41,320
make sure you don't fall down the hall and die. Let's go. This is going to be the real one.

197
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,219
I'm not going to do any dumb mistakes and I'm not going to leave right off the bat.

198
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,860
Yeah, I know. I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure I know that that's where I am at this point. You

199
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:59,400
don't have to keep telling me. Well, let me get like the dust off my screen because it's making

200
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:09,159
me think that there's stuff on there. You are now entering some gauntlet legends. You are now

201
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:15,719
entering the crypt of the spider kingdom or something, whatever it was. Just keep talking

202
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:19,880
and I won't be scared. Just keep talking. Just keep making noises with your mouth and you won't

203
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,119
be scared about things that are jumping out at you on the screen.

204
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:37,800
You know what, man? I am just so sick of your- Why do you have to keep doing that?

205
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,300
What? What? What is this? What the hell is this? Why is there- What's this?

206
00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:59,659
Stair- Why? Where am I? I don't have a flashlight. I don't even know where I am. Do I go in there

207
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:11,539
or do I go over here? I don't know. I don't- I don't know. Do it with one eye. If I do it with

208
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:16,760
one eye, it's not that bad. If I do it with one eye, it's still as bad. It's still just as bad

209
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,719
with one eye. Forget that. Never mind what I just said. It's still just as bad with one eye closed.

210
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:28,489
What about both eyes closed? But I can't see where I'm going. Things are getting weird looking

211
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:34,650
again. Things are getting like green and like opaque and- Oh, this is it. Get me out of here.

212
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:50,280
Pinkies on escape. Stop it. Hi. This is what happened last time and then the thing jumped

213
00:36:50,280 --> 00:37:08,570
out at me. Floor 10. If you- I gotta think of a song, a nice happy song. Hold on.

214
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:17,670
Raindrops keep falling on my head, but I don't believe my life's a true beauty.

215
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:25,829
Red, red, the super bad, red, the raindrops keep falling on my head. They keep falling,

216
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:37,190
but blue, blue, blue, blue, blue. I don't know the lyrics, but it's helping lots. It is helping

217
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:54,599
lots when- No, it's not. No. Just get- Oh, man. I'm down pretty far. I didn't get down this far

218
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:08,440
last time. I think I did. I don't remember. It's just a blur at this point. 15. Hi. Itchy nose. Itchy

219
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,360
nose. It's a way for me to pretend like I have an itchy nose so I can not look at the screen

220
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:33,300
kind of really maybe. God damn it, man. Get them. I'm not going down further. I'm not going down

221
00:38:33,300 --> 00:39:06,119
further than that. Containment breach. This game hurts my head. Wow. Beatbox the Halloween theme.

222
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:21,820
I'll do that. Well, how does it go? Here we go, ready? Let's see if I can do this.

223
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:28,900
because it's halloween makes sense right well it's not halloween right now but it will be

224
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:51,369
here we go i can't even do it it's too hard i'll slow it down hold on

225
00:39:53,750 --> 00:40:09,000
that was better that was a little bit better i tried to do it like way too fast the first time

226
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,829
like that wasn't gonna work all right
