00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,379
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here, with sort of a different video today. I apologize if I sound a little nervous, because I am.

2
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:24,620
I just found a wild spee nest on Dustbowl, and this is- they pop up from time to time, but I've got to be really careful here, guys.

3
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:33,049
This is the middle of mating season. Blue spees and red spees are going to be mating. I've got to be very, very quiet here.

4
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:37,850
Oh shit. Oh shit. Does he see me?

5
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,850
That would have been very bad.

6
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,850
I don't like how they're reacting to this, though. I don't like how- oh god. Oh god, just run, I've got to get out of here.

7
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,850
Oh no, they're killing each other.

8
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,850
Gee, I'm going to die. I'm going to fucking die here.

9
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,850
I can die here.

10
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,019
I think it's still growing. Your head's big, too.

11
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,019
Is mine big, too?

12
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:07,019
Yeah, taunt.

13
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,019
It's still growing.

14
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:14,739
It's not stopping.

15
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:16,739
It's not stopping.

16
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:17,739
Help me. Help me.

17
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:19,739
It's spee. It's spee.

18
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:21,739
It's getting bigger.

19
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:23,739
Oh my god.

20
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:34,459
You cannot publish me.

21
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,140
It's getting so big, you're taking up almost the whole map.

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,780
Your head is upside down, growing, by the way.

23
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,579
What? Why is it backwards? What is going on?

24
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,579
I put a negative value in.

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
It's just taking up your body.

26
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,329
That is so stupid.

27
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,719
Dude, it is so dumb.

28
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,659
Okay, okay, okay.

29
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:15,289
Have you ever seen the Super Mario Brothers live action movie?

30
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:17,289
Yes.

31
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:19,289
You know, the Goombas in that movie.

32
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,780
It's hard to remember. It's been so long.

33
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,389
You have the cigarette coming out of your neck.

34
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,020
Yeah, you do.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Look at these little fucking peanut heads.
