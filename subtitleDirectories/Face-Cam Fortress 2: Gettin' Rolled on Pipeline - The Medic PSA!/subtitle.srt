1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,140
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jermok here with Facecam Fortress 2.

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:19,320
The first episode in quite a long time, as most of you will probably recall.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,250
The kit. Pyros.

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,550
Playing on pipeline, as you can probably tell, Sniper, you're gonna die in 3, 2,

5
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,550
Oh, even before the countdown ended?

6
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,500
He did not see a 150 on me. Did you? Oh!

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,450
Did you see that 150? Spy, get out of my face!

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,759
And just like that, you can get like 4 kills in a row.

9
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,759
What are we voting on? Kick somebody?

10
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,899
I don't know. Should we kick this guy?

11
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:55,780
I need health. I forget what the health is in pipeline. I'm such an idiot.

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,979
Oh, watch this. Watch this.

13
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:02,979
Oh, that's all he needed to do! What's wrong with me?

14
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,159
If he had gotten one tiny little pellet on me, he would have killed me.

15
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,159
And he did.

16
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,909
God damn it, Jerma. Sometimes I just want to fart in your face.

17
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,909
Get up! Do something!

18
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,670
Jump on his jump over there!

19
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,670
Come on, come on, come on, we lost.

20
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:31,099
Oh, I didn't even say like, I'm using the direct hit, and I have,

21
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:36,670
Hold on.

22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,790
Flying Pyro! Flying Pyro!

23
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,099
I probably should mention the hat I'm wearing too.

24
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,409
It's this weird, like, stupid Pilgrim hat that was in my closet.

25
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:56,890
I think I wore this in a very old Facecam Fortress from like at least a year ago.

26
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,819
So if you see this hat again, and you recognize it, then hell yeah, do it.

27
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:04,569
I'm wearing an old hat. Where are you going?

28
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:06,579
Where are you going?

29
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:08,580
Where are you going with your goddamn sweater vest?

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,099
We did it. We got it. Get the health.

31
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:19,780
Pick the health up. You just called.

32
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,919
This guy's calling for a doctor, and he's looking at the health pack.

33
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,889
We're getting smoked again. All right, I'm going to put my tri-hot pants on.

34
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:32,750
No more messing around. No more messing around.

35
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,750
Come on, get me out there. Get me out there.

36
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,750
I'm going to kill everybody that's out there. Come on.

37
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,379
I'm going to land every single direct hit shot when I get out there.

38
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:47,849
Everybody watch this. Here we go.

39
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:48,849
Oh, we'll just get spawn camped.

40
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:57,270
Oh, do you see? I picked up the guy's brass beast.

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,120
Using my detective work, I think he died up there.

42
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,120
All right, let's actually win this goddamn round.

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,680
Well, can that be a thing? Can we win a match, please?

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,240
Should I change off direct hit? I don't know.

45
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,740
No, I'm not going to change off it.

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,270
These two guys are running around with their BS.

47
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:29,610
Oh my God, this is too hard.

48
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,870
Oh, death from above.

49
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:40,409
Got to hit that medic.

50
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:47,050
There you go, Sergeant. Nice try.

51
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,120
Don't let him get you with that.

52
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,659
I'm going to go down and defend the actual burp cop.

53
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,659
That guy got wrecked.

54
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,219
That guy.

55
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,770
Look, look, look.

56
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,770
Oh, come on.

57
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:11,150
Come on and get this.

58
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,120
Will you land a shot?

59
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:26,230
So in the land of...

60
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,230
This is my password book.

61
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,300
Oh my God.

62
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,300
I almost showed my passwords on screen.

63
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,300
I was going to do a thing where I...

64
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,660
I got to go on a complete rampage right here.

65
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,660
I have to make this happen.

66
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,110
Put on your pants.

67
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,110
Even though I'm not wearing any pants right now,

68
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,610
I'm wearing just like underwear.

69
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,610
This is what I do.

70
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,610
Whenever I want to do like a face game video,

71
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,610
I'm like, God, but I got to put pants on.

72
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,779
No, you don't.

73
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,779
Because like all you can see is like right here.

74
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:59,779
The magic of video editing.

75
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:03,689
I'll get out of here.

76
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:07,910
Get you little pricks.

77
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,470
Don't worry.

78
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,470
Don't worry.

79
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,839
Don't worry.

80
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,839
Don't worry.

81
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:22,569
Oh, I wonder what's going to happen in this round.

82
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:25,000
We're going to get steamrolled.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Is that really a surprise to anybody on this team?

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,310
This is just ridiculous.

85
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,300
Keep them off.

86
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,300
Come here, dude.

87
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,740
Come here.

88
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,509
There you go.

89
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,819
There you go, beef.

90
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:44,819
Get this...

91
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:45,819
Get me off me, beef.

92
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,379
Come on, beef.

93
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,379
Somebody kill this guy.

94
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:49,379
Somebody kill this son of a bitch.

95
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,189
Thank you so much.

96
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,189
Oh, I need health.

97
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:56,779
Abandon the team.

98
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:59,589
I don't think we're going to win this,

99
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:07,459
but at least we're probably going to have the match go longer than 30 seconds.

100
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:09,459
All right, let's do this after this Uber wears off.

101
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:12,980
Don't let the heavy die.

102
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,920
He's going to die.

103
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,670
The heavy is going to die.

104
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,670
Oh, goodness.

105
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,670
Oh, goodness.

106
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,670
Oh, goodness.

107
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,670
Come on, overdose.

108
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,259
Overdose, you got to pull through here.

109
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,500
Come on, overdose.

110
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,079
Just do something.

111
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,540
There it is.

112
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,540
There it is, baby.

113
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,540
Come on, do it again.

114
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,839
Oh, my goodness gracious, beef.

115
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,839
Beef.

116
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,360
Look at this guy going absolutely beast.

117
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
That's how you do it right there.

118
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,579
I got you.

119
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,660
I got you.

120
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
Watch out.

121
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,689
We got to watch out.

122
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:53,689
Get him out of the spawn.

123
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:58,420
That went right by my face.

124
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,180
Let's go.

125
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,629
Somebody got to get that sniper that's up there.

126
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,319
You prick.

127
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,319
You know what?

128
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,860
I should probably go get him.

129
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,810
Turn around.

130
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,839
You want to play that game?

131
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,839
You want to play that game?

132
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,839
That's fine.

133
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,019
All right.

134
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:23,019
Wait.

135
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:25,480
Holy hell.

136
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Help me.

137
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,959
Somebody help me.

138
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,709
Oh, boy.

139
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:32,709
I'm going to have to use this.

140
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:37,540
Keep it going.

141
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,540
Shoot some down that hall.

142
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,889
It's all right.

143
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:42,889
It's all right.

144
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,879
Nice job.

145
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,879
Nice job.

146
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,699
It's okay.

147
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:48,699
We got to move this guy.

148
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:51,540
I'm dead.

149
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,949
What is this guy doing up here?

150
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:54,949
Oh, my God.

151
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:55,949
Free overcharge.

152
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:00,579
Come on.

153
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:01,579
I don't want to crit him.

154
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:17,829
Get him, Iron Man.

155
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:18,829
Watch out, Heidi.

156
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:19,829
They got two medics.

157
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:23,120
Two asshole medics.

158
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
That crit.

159
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,089
Not fair.

160
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,290
Push it.

161
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,290
Push it.

162
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,529
Push it.

163
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:32,529
Push it.

164
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:35,789
Remember, guys, what you're seeing right now is what happens when somebody goes medic.

165
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:42,330
When one goddamn person on your team goes medic, you can win the game.

166
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,649
That's a good PSA right there, because we were just getting destroyed the entire time.

167
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:49,690
And then we had one medic on our team, and we won the game.

168
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,850
So that's going to wrap it up here, guys.

169
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,970
Thank you all so much for watching Face Game Fortress 2, and I'll see you all next time.

170
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,129
And of course, how messy is my hair?

171
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:58,129
Take care, everybody.
