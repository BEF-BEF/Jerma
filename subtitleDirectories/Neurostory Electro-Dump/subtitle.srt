1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,400
I hear it's a good game. I hear it's an incredible franchise. I haven't played

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,660
Metal Gear Solid since I was probably 16. I played the first one and I played the

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,750
second one. I don't know the story and it's become so complicated and so

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,170
intertwined at this point. I seriously don't even know where I would even start.

5
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,929
Dozens of hours of cutscenes, tons of reading. I don't got time to read. You

6
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:36,890
always got time to read nowadays, you know? So what I did is I picked up this.

7
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:45,100
This is, got this online, a comprehensive Metal Gear NeuroStory

8
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,359
Electrodump. They have them for all kinds of things. This is for Metal Gear

9
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,979
because obviously the story is so complicated like we've talked about. So

10
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:59,179
that goes into the CD tray. I think it's just a standard disc at the sole. Now we put

11
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:08,709
on the electrodes. That goes there. Okay. Standard USB. It goes right in the back

12
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:26,219
of your computer. Just like that. That should be it. Ow, my teeth. Ow. Okay. Let's all

13
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:32,900
get hype for Metal Gear Solid 5. Get hype. Play button.

14
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:59,269
Big Boss was the boss. No, the boss was the boss and then Big Boss, Big Boss Man

15
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:03,069
took over because he had to kill her because the third game into the fifth

16
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:11,150
game, the fourth game in the worse than second. God damn it. I gotta watch it

17
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:17,060
again. I gotta start over. I gotta start over. I'll get it this time because I just,

18
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,409
it was getting confusing when they were all clones and shit. One more time. Get

19
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:27,389
hype. Get hype for Metal Gear Solid 5. Get hype.

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:19,199
What's happening? Where am I? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Metal Gear Solid story. I must

21
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,039
not have hit play. I must have fallen asleep. I got time. It's for the launch of

22
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:30,319
Metal Gear. Metal Gear Solid 5, the launch party.
