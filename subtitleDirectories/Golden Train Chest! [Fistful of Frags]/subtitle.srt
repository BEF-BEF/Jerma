1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:17,109
Give me that chest. Give me that chest. Give me that golden chest. Give me that chest. Give me that chest. Give me, give me, give me, give me.

2
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:23,910
Come on, protect me. Protect me, team. You have to protect me. Oh, I got it.

3
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:35,909
Okay, get me, get me to a safe spot. This map is crazy, dude. This map is like, oh, I got full health, huh?

4
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:45,539
So anyways, let me, like, introduce this. Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with a fistful of frags, gameplay commentary.

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:56,619
And tonight, we're on the new map. This is Depot. It's a community-made map. And it's pretty fun, as you saw me get on top of that train.

6
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:07,739
The big train robbery. And pick up this fantastic weapon. This guy, really? Where are you going? Two of these guys now.

7
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:14,620
And this is where you swoop in and you just, you just absolutely clean up. That's all you got to do.

8
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:22,620
Just don't get hit in the face by that. You should be good to go. Why is that missing so much, is the question at hand.

9
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:35,209
No! No, I don't want to lose my gun. Just don't shoot me. Oh, what? What? What on earth just happened?

10
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:40,579
Whiskey, whiskey. I don't want to be up here. I want to be in a better position.

11
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:49,049
Man, I really do need to reload this, but I don't think I have an opportunity to. I don't want to go that way either.

12
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:57,730
Yeah, I know. I know you're aiming in here. I can see you. I'm screwed. The only thing I can hope for is a lucky shot right here.

13
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:06,549
Three, two, one, bang. I hit him. Didn't kill him. Oh, damn it. Okay, help me. Protect me. Here comes the train.

14
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:16,430
I got to get out of this room. Oh, I thought that was an enemy. Okay, we're good. Time to make a run for it. Time to make a run for it.

15
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,979
Make sure no one's behind me. Maybe pick up this guy right here. Goodbye. Get his friend too. Goodbye.

16
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:34,599
I got a pretty big streak going here, don't I? One more hit. Reload. Reload. We're going to be cautious here. Be cautious.

17
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:45,979
Don't let this guy see you. Don't let this guy see you. If he sees you, it's over and your streak ends. That's good enough. Good enough.

18
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:58,750
Stop reloading. Good enough. Whiskey. We got this guy right here. Going up this man up here as well.

19
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:14,259
Oh, damn it. That was bad. Oh, that was bad too. Oh, what the? Would I get 11 kills in a row? Sweet. I don't think so.

20
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:22,889
So I'm going to give you guys just a couple of Fistful of Frags tips because there's not really a tutorial in this game.

21
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:34,740
And it can be kind of difficult to understand what's really happening. So have you noticed what I'm doing?

22
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,719
I'm holding down right click and alt at the same time because see what my crosshair does?

23
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:52,520
If somebody gets that close to you, like for instance this guy right here, when they get this close, that's when you hold down right click and you can shoot much faster.

24
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,580
So keep that in mind. And also when you're holding alt in general is good to do because you move around much slower.

25
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,750
Like see if I see if I just like kind of aim at this guy like, oh, I'm going to like, oh, look at my crosshair.

26
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:12,930
Holding alt makes your shots much more accurate. And on top of that, if you stand still, makes it even more accurate.

27
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:20,819
So I would suggest you do it if you're missing everybody because that's one of the biggest complaints I see if people that try this game.

28
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:24,819
They're like, well, I can't hit anything. What the hell is going on? This is like stupid.

29
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:39,379
And then you got to remember kind of in the same realm as something like Counter-Strike where you have to really just place your shots and holding control in Counter-Strike or crouch.

30
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:49,759
Is somebody going to get this thing? Oh, I guess he got it. Yep. You got this. You got the shotgun. Why? What the hell?

31
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,759
Oh, didn't they nerf the shotgun? I'm pretty sure they nerf the shotgun. That's why. That's what's going on.

32
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:09,819
It's all right. Don't follow me up the stairs. Oh, hold on. I want to see what the train looks like. I want to see what the train looks like at night.

33
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,019
What does the train look like at night? I want to just, I don't want to fight you. I just want to see the train.

34
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:21,509
I don't know what the hell. I don't. Okay. I just want to see the train. Where's the train? It's over there. Escape.

35
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:34,180
Look, there's the train with the lights on. How many of you guys? I just want to see the train. Cool. I want to ride the train.

36
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,420
Beep, beep. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

37
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,689
How come I keep running into those guys? They're the only people I've attacked.

38
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:48,250
I'm just going to grab this. Nobody's really paying attention except for this guy. Come on, come on, come on.

39
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:55,980
I don't even care what gun it is. Don't even care what gun it is. Don't even care. Don't even care.

40
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:09,500
Get me to a safe spot for one second. Can I have one solitary second? No. Switch the hands. Switch the hands.

41
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,300
Okay, now pull it up. And we're good to go. Now I can relax for just a moment.

42
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,720
Shoot that guy right in his balls. You know, that's okay. I still have two shots.

43
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:35,980
God, this thing is so powerful. This gun. This gun. This gun. Oh, my dear. Just going to sit here. I'm going to chill.

44
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,220
Nobody's paying attention to me. These guys are on my team. That's a good thing.

45
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:48,430
All right. Stop reloading. Stop reloading. Stop reloading. Holy shit. Why can I? I'm trying to stop reloading, but it won't stop.

46
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:57,420
I might be in like freak out mode right now, man, considering this gun is doing a whole lot of good for me.

47
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:12,279
Oh, meet me at the old oil thing or the water tower or whatever that thing is. What is this thing? Is it like a big bird feeder?

48
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,339
I don't know. Let's keep going. I got to keep this streak on. I'm going to watch out for the train. Don't get hit by the train.

49
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:26,589
Don't get hit by the train. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. I wonder how long I can keep this going for.

50
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,550
I need to reload. It's so dark right now. It is so dark.

51
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,750
Shit, I wasted a shot.

52
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:43,319
Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mosquito. Oh, they're chasing me.

53
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:51,660
How many did I have? 13 kill streak. Holy crap. Whoa. Whoa.
