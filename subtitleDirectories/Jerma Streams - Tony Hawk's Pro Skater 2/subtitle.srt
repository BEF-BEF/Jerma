1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,490
All right, convinced myself of something very recently here right now.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:15,400
I'm certain, you know a cow has four stomachs. I've never had an x-ray before on my, you know,

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,440
bladder. I bet you I have three or four bladders. Some kind of genetic mutation.

4
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:35,780
Well everybody's messages are getting deleted. What are you guys doing? All right, let's do it.

5
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:49,719
Create skater. Skater one. Site. Name. Who does this- what's this? Because you put like stat points

6
00:00:49,719 --> 00:01:02,439
in and shit, don't you? I can't make Thanos right now. It could be me. This is just going

7
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:26,950
to be Jeremy. Why would it be anything else? Enough room? I don't have enough room. This

8
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:42,859
character career is going to take two hours? This- not a very significant amount of things

9
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:49,349
you can do in this character career. Jax Albertson. I got it. That's actually a pretty

10
00:01:49,349 --> 00:02:05,319
good idea. Thank you for the suggestion. All right, there is Jax Albertson. My real name.

11
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:37,930
Name. Uh, hometown. I'm gonna spell it like that. Age. Style. All around. Vert. Street. All

12
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:44,280
around. Hmm. Vert I believe is air. Height. Street is being able to jump around. It's

13
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,199
grind on shit. And all around is kind of your style is all around. I'm gonna say,

14
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,680
uh, no Goofy. Goofy is just, uh, you sitting out the other way. Street is probably better,

15
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,979
but I don't know. I think I like all around. Street. Street. Weight. I don't weigh that much.

16
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:12,810
I don't weigh that little- oh my lord. You can literally make a sausage with it. Thank you

17
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:24,789
Herbert for the five community subs. Thanks a lot Herb. Herbert. I'm like- I'm like 154 or

18
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:34,949
something, so that's close enough. I'm not gonna make him a hot dog. Complexion. Uh,

19
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:45,909
let's load everything. Okay, roll easy. Head. Slick. I think that's just Tony Hawk's face.

20
00:03:47,590 --> 00:04:30,060
Suck. Suck too. I actually kind of like this one. Striped shirt. Uh, what do I got on

21
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:47,610
right now? I have like a gray shirt on. Camo. Tank top. Jersey. Sweat bands.

22
00:04:50,329 --> 00:05:03,779
Three. Sweat bands. Sweatshirt. T-shirt. That's kind of boring. I wear kind- I wear shit like

23
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:20,220
this. I do. No logo. The one I have on right now is gray, but I'll do like a blue.

24
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:33,930
That's all right right there. The same color. Pants. If they have a Star Wars logo pants,

25
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:40,120
I'll do it. If not, I'm just gonna do pair of jeans. Really wear shorts.

26
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:49,939
Uh, regular pants. I'm just gonna make them blue. There we go. Shoes.

27
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:58,230
All right, that's- that's- that looks all right. That's not what I look like though,

28
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:10,600
at all. That- that kind of looks like me. The guy with the helmet on. Or one of these.

29
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:29,740
Maybe. Yeah, that looks like me. Okay, I'm gonna keep the helmet on. You can just pretend

30
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:36,139
I'm bald under there. Whatever. All right, this is important. I've got five points left.

31
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:44,060
This is very important. Hang time. Olly. Speed. Spin. Landing. Switch. Rail. Bail.

32
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:56,699
Lip balance. Rail balance. I need some like- ah, no. Rail balance. I want at least a couple.

33
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:10,579
I love riding manuals as well. Speed. Maybe air as well. Or hang time. That rail balance

34
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:17,290
is so important. All right, that's all right. That's okay. I think that's good. 100% into

35
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:29,779
Olly. I'm gonna get points as I get cash. Is rail balance more important than manuals in the

36
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:40,920
first part of the game? Yeah, you can't take points away. You can just add. I think it's

37
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:50,170
all right. I'm good. I'm good with this. Trick setup. I forgot you could do all this shit.

38
00:07:50,889 --> 00:08:00,660
I forgot about this. Up and X. I got no money, but we can. Okay. Inward heel flip.

39
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:10,180
Heel flip. And some of these are worth more points. Yep. Up, up, X. What do we got?

40
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:21,220
Possible varial kick flip. Let's put this on. Do I have any? No, I have varial heel flip.

41
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,500
No varial kick flip, though. No, actually, I already do.

42
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,339
All these cost money. Hard flip. No, I still, I think I pretty much I have

43
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:40,419
everything. You can buy shit. Let's see. Inward heel flip, varial, X shove it, kick flip,

44
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:47,610
hard flip. Flip all the way north. Inward heel flip. Yeah, I gotta buy these.

45
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:55,379
There's the mute, the whole other mute. Got a stale fish. Indy, stiffy, crossbone.

46
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:23,210
Close beef. Grab. Grab tricks. Yeah, actually, that's really not. These are the grabs.

47
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:34,070
Up, up, and B. These are, we're getting into the, not necessarily, they're not that important.

48
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:43,159
Lip tricks. Yeah, nose stall. Disaster. What else is there? Something else.

49
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:53,220
Specials. Now, this is important. Dark slide. Can't do it? Oh, it's already assigned.

50
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:09,419
Right down B is kick, flip, kick, twist. Up, up, 540 flip. Bang, bang. Okay, I gotta remember

51
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:17,690
this one. Left, right. Left, right, grind, dark slide. All right, well, we'll just go.

52
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,690
Let's get, let's just get it going. I'm ready. Oh, let me just crack open.

53
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:31,059
You can only pick tricks that you can do in real life. Well, then I wouldn't even stand

54
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:41,620
on the skateboard. These are all just dog shit boards. I can't afford anything else.

55
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:49,720
Save skater into career file. Yes. What am I drinking? This is a, it's a Coca Cola.

56
00:10:49,720 --> 00:11:04,470
It's just a Coke. What the hell was that? No, this is my VMU. Career mode. New career.

57
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,330
There he is. Jax Alberton. Let's see how bad he is compared to everybody else.

58
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:21,259
It's not bad actually. I mean, yeah, everybody else is more balanced, but

59
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:28,600
let's do it. Buy stats, buy tricks, skate shop. All right, he did all that.

60
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:40,600
Let's go. This is the hanger. Mullet Falls. Minnesota, Kentucky. So the goals here.

61
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:49,240
What do we got? Get a high score of 10,000, 25,000, and 75,000. Let's skate.

62
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:58,789
The nose grind over the pipe. Hit the hang time gaps. Secret tape. 100% goals. Let's just go for

63
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:04,970
points. You kind of have to do these in sessions because they're timed. And let's like try to

64
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:12,940
remember how to play this video game. Let's go. Welcome to Tony Hawk 2 for the Sega Dreamcast.

65
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:44,100
RIP Vaude. Oh, first fall. Manuals. Oh my God. I forgot how great this was.

66
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:55,580
I'm going to just get used to the controls. Is there no uh, is there no bar

67
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:20,279
for when you're on the reel? I just thought there was. It's been so long. Turn it up.

68
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,100
All right, I'll turn it up. Sound levels. Music. That's good.

69
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:54,220
Oh yeah, I'm feeling it. I'm feeling it. One thing I gotta remember how to do

70
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:35,289
whole jumping. Yeah. That was perfect somehow. So what did I get in my in my tutorial run?

71
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:48,860
So I gotta work on jump speed. Definitely. So high score, high score. So maybe you're

72
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:55,480
noticing my ollie and my air. That needs a little work. Let's go for 75,000. I'll get it.

73
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:09,740
Okay. Audio delay on the PlayStation. On me or the PlayStation 2?

74
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:19,539
Dreamcast. Retried. That's the best part about Tony Hawk is you can just do it again

75
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:53,000
right now. Oops. I gotta get used to the uh, here it is. You got the multiplier up there.

76
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:13,289
Dark slide. Tony Hawk is fucking back in town baby.

77
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:30,580
Wait. No. Just wait till I get like a couple of hours in here, man. I'm gonna be fucking

78
00:16:30,580 --> 00:17:02,820
rubbing. Shit. Oh god damn it. I'm so happy. I got the barrels at least. I can't hold on to

79
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:30,180
the lip for long. I'm just a bum. Got it. Dammit. No. Oh, you can keep this. You can

80
00:17:30,180 --> 00:18:08,539
keep it going. Do it again. One hang time. Get the barrels too. Shit. I need enough points.

81
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,319
By the way, this is not going to be a very talky game because I've got to concentrate.

82
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:51,779
Daisy. One thing I'm trying to get used to is when you jump off, usually you can as you

83
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:55,940
jump off and do another trick even more easily. I can grind it because it's like I'm tripping.

84
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,269
That's how you like string together shit real well.

85
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:29,609
One fifth of the way to a million. Yeah. That ain't gonna happen anytime soon.

86
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:56,579
Like almost a tenth of the way to a million. You got to get it like started immediately.

87
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:04,519
There it is. This is the song. This is the song. You know, it also is just stats too.

88
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:17,339
Stats too low to do anything crazy. Just got to work on just doing it. Forget about

89
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:35,289
stringing points together. Just get them in the kind of normal. Oh, what was I thinking?

90
00:20:36,170 --> 00:21:02,730
All right. I'm so obsessed. Shit. All right. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I got, I don't, I don't have

91
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:07,210
enough points yet. Just do it the normal way. Jeremy, you can't string things together with

92
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:36,279
three points in one. Fuck. You know what I'm saying? Let's go. Thanks so much.

93
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:52,359
Oh, you know what it is? There is, I don't have one set to up. Okay.

94
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:06,539
Damn it. Okay. No, no, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

95
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:14,619
I don't have anything set to up X. The tricks would reset.

96
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:46,869
Get it. Oh, I didn't get it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I love the hang time.

97
00:23:46,869 --> 00:24:01,880
I should have done more hang time. Grab the edge there. I got the points.

98
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:28,009
Okay. I got it. One 10th of the way to a million. Sound is not synced. Let me see.

99
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:42,220
The sound is happening too early. See if that helps. This is on PlayStation 2. Yes.

100
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:51,799
But this is the best version of Tony Hawk. This is the most, this is the most polished

101
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:09,099
Oh, did I get it? I got it. Let's go with the, uh, I don't, let's get the barrel.

102
00:25:09,740 --> 00:26:36,740
Wait, I can go across there. Holding up. There it is. Okay. Secret tape. Barrels. That's it.

103
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:56,809
Not quite. No, I got them, didn't I? I got the tape. No, I didn't get it.

104
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:06,680
You open school to the best map across the entire series. But we're not, I want to,

105
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:16,250
let's look at one, one place at a time. There was a string from school two a long time ago

106
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:21,930
that I used to be able to do. Starts at that first staircase going down. You go down,

107
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:27,609
you jump on the two benches on the left side. You can string together a million fucking points

108
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:46,680
in school two. It's the best map in all Tony Hawk. I need pilot wings and skate. Okay. Yes.

109
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,970
Flames.

110
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,559
There's a secret in there, a secret up top too.

111
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:13,990
E is up there.

112
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:23,829
Got it. Hold L and R in the air to even out.

113
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:36,019
L and R are spinning in the air.

114
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:57,180
Two more pilot wings. This way. You skate or you die.

115
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:21,670
Oh, there it is.

116
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,670
Got them all.

117
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,670
I think that's all I can do for now.

118
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,069
Ain't hot no more.

119
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:55,880
Turn the sound effects down. So we got barrel hunt, all the hang time gaps, and nose grind.

120
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:10,470
Turn up the effects. Where the sound level? Is the sound level too high? Five, eight, and nine.

121
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:26,259
It's not, is it all right? Make sure it's not terrible. Yeah, that's one. Two, I believe,

122
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:39,269
across this, didn't have much speed, but okay. That one hits it right here.

123
00:30:48,039 --> 00:31:25,509
And no. The last one? All right, it's through the wall, right?

124
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:29,910
So

125
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:46,970
I thought it was the helicopter.

126
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:35,079
Remember, you can spend your, yeah, no, not yet. Where's that last jump that I'm missing?

127
00:32:36,630 --> 00:33:10,740
All right, let's get the barrels. Tony Hawk and Chad?

128
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:18,819
This is seriously the best skateboarder game ever.

129
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:25,690
I really wish, I really wish you could get another one of these plastic.

130
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:43,670
Come on, done.

131
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:51,670
As the grind the nose pipe. Which one is that? That's the question. Grind the nose pipe. Up there?

132
00:33:51,670 --> 00:34:38,360
Oh my god. Great Canadian Fuck Club just came in with 20 more community subs.

133
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:51,940
A thousand of them essentially at this point. Thank you, great Canadian, for your $50,000 probably.

134
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:02,179
Now that means a lot. Thank you so much. You've given so much money to this channel, man.

135
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:07,380
Thank you. Nose grind over the pipe and then we're done.

136
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:26,699
Nose grind over the pipe. Over the pipe. This one up here?

137
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,690
Oh, it's dry.

138
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:20,940
100% we did it. Level one complete.

139
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,619
Let's get a, get a dark slide here.

140
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,300
That's not it. Left, left, right, right?

141
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,300
Left, left, right, right?

142
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:06,980
That was such a loud noise.

143
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,230
Wall exploiter.

144
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:38,789
Got it all. 100% goals and cash. Wait, I need cash. I mean I don't have to 100% every level.

145
00:37:49,610 --> 00:38:12,010
The helicopter. There's the cash up top. I need cash up here.

146
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:21,369
Wow. I gotta get up. I need a bunch of speed. I need to get up here.

147
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:35,320
100 bucks.

148
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,670
Is there any more money? I think I got all the cash.

149
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,460
Big bits. Big bits.

150
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:35,139
Pellar grind? Grind the propeller grind. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

151
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:47,690
Like the propeller on the plane?

152
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,690
Okay, on the pipe itself. Half pipe.

153
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,239
50 bucks. That should be it.

154
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,480
Oh, there's so much more money in here.

155
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:22,550
That was a gnarly wipeout.

156
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:49,139
Holy shit, that was so high in the air.

157
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:53,820
One more pill right here.

158
00:40:53,820 --> 00:41:04,500
Going too fast.

159
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:19,340
Leveled. No such thing as too fast.

160
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:29,400
Now we just free skate for a little bit.

161
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,699
And then we're gonna buy some points. Maybe a new skateboard.

162
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:51,500
I love this game.

163
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,940
I got 2,500 bucks.

164
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,030
Save career. Let's go buy some stuff.

165
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,030
This music makes me feel like I want to punch something.

166
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,289
So what do you think?

167
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:18,199
Do some points?

168
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:21,400
Or tricks?

169
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
I'm gonna say stats are probably more important first.

170
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,639
Points.

171
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:37,159
Manuals.

172
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:39,159
I mean air.

173
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:49,780
Full rail balance.

174
00:42:49,780 --> 00:43:10,500
Music is so loud.

175
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
I'm sorry.

176
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,469
Speed.

177
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,469
All the air and rail balance.

178
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:21,030
I think that's pretty good for now.

179
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,099
Landing also could use it.

180
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:26,099
Maybe take one off of all the important landing.

181
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:32,570
The rail balance is the most important thing.

182
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,570
That's how you stay

183
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,570
moving forward just to string more shit together.

184
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:46,550
100% level goal on the hangar.

185
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,550
Let's move our way to school 2

186
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,550
in southern California.

187
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:53,880
100,000 points.

188
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
Let's skate. Wall ride the bells.

189
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,059
Ball passes.

190
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:01,320
Find secret tape.

191
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,820
This is where we're probably not gonna 100% everyone.

192
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,980
I'm willing to give it a try.

193
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,980
Let's see if I can remember the route.

194
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,980
To do

195
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:18,760
a shitload of points.

196
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,760
Nobody's made a new skating game because peak skater

197
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,760
counterculture hasn't had as much traction

198
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,760
since the Tony Hawk era.

199
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,059
Yeah that's true but doesn't mean that I don't

200
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:29,059
necessarily...

201
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:35,590
It's right here. There it is.

202
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,590
That's how you do it. That's it. Do you see what I'm talking about?

203
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:43,480
You go across and you keep going.

204
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,480
You need more speed though.

205
00:44:45,480 --> 00:45:01,539
I'm not sure I'll be able to do it.

206
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:03,539
That's 50 grand.

207
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:10,900
This place really is so awesome.

208
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:20,570
There's so much to do here.

209
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,570
Throw skater. I didn't even do it right.

210
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:28,500
I gotta get something on up.

211
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:35,539
Up and kickflip.

212
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:39,059
That's like one of my favorite ways to grab.

213
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:41,059
That rail balance though. That's why we buy...

214
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:54,059
That's why we bought it.

215
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:56,059
I got some...

216
00:45:56,059 --> 00:46:04,699
What the hell happened there?

217
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:06,699
I need to do it but...

218
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:12,329
It's a long ride.

219
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:14,329
I'll get the high score right now.

220
00:46:14,329 --> 00:46:16,329
That's good.

221
00:46:16,329 --> 00:46:18,329
Try to do the special.

222
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:29,320
Oh yeah.

223
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,320
And then you go across these and you end up across this.

224
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,320
It's so much. It's amazing.

225
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:43,239
The one more try mentality.

226
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:45,860
It's so evident here.

227
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,550
I'm gonna be obsessed with this.

228
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:54,630
It's a lot of money too.

229
00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:00,199
So we need to grab skate.

230
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:02,199
Five bells.

231
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:18,900
Let's go.

232
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:41,619
Come on. Let's go.

233
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:48,150
Do it again. I gotta make something up.

234
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,150
I don't have anything on up or down.

235
00:47:50,150 --> 00:48:01,800
One more try. Come on.

236
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,000
I don't think I got it. I think I need some more stats before I can attempt it.

237
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:16,329
One more.

238
00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:19,340
Stop skipping music. I'm just restarting the level.

239
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:34,949
Alright. Alright. Come on.

240
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:38,539
I'm obsessed.

241
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:45,639
I didn't even do it.

242
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:47,639
Come on. Why did I not do it?

243
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:49,639
I'll do it later.

244
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:51,639
I've got no stats.

245
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:58,619
Alright. Ride the bells.

246
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:02,969
I see one over here.

247
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:15,579
Across the dumpster.

248
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:22,489
Five. Where are the other five?

249
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:38,150
Any of the bells over there?

250
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:40,150
Up top maybe?

251
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,579
I think I'm gonna go buy speed and ollie.

252
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:47,699
I'm pretty slow.

253
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:55,769
Is this way to go down too?

254
00:49:55,769 --> 00:49:57,769
Possible? It might not be possible.

255
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:04,550
We'll see.

256
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:12,619
Maybe you can actually grab onto that part.

257
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:14,619
School bell. We'll give her a school bell.

258
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:19,219
I got some money.

259
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:27,739
I'll spend it.

260
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:29,739
There's so much in this level. I love it so much.

261
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:33,510
I'm overwhelmed by all the awesome things

262
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:37,420
to do.

263
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,099
You end up over here.

264
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:42,099
And then initial string going off the bench.

265
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:44,099
You come all the way down. Up there.

266
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:46,340
That's how you get a million points.

267
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,340
Let's spend some cash.

268
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:56,389
I need to go faster.

269
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:58,389
Let's see.

270
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,829
Speed.

271
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:05,539
This backs out speed.

272
00:51:05,539 --> 00:51:11,559
Speed and air.

273
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,019
Or speed and ollie probably.

274
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:24,300
Change the one for up.

275
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:31,340
Up and x.

276
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,340
Down and x.

277
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,920
Empty.

278
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,920
I'm gonna say...

279
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:59,769
Let's try it again.

280
00:51:59,769 --> 00:52:05,269
There's a new skating game on Steam.

281
00:52:05,269 --> 00:52:09,300
There's a lot of

282
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,530
skating games that have come out since.

283
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,019
But even after

284
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:18,019
something like Skate 2 and Skate 3.

285
00:52:18,019 --> 00:52:21,219
Like somebody was mentioning that

286
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:23,219
the skating culture is...

287
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:25,219
Nobody really cares anymore.

288
00:52:25,219 --> 00:52:27,219
But...

289
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:29,219
I don't really care about

290
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:31,219
skateboarding.

291
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:33,219
But skateboarding games are just

292
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:35,219
fun.

293
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:42,969
They always have been.

294
00:52:42,969 --> 00:52:44,969
That's what I'm talking about.

295
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:57,639
I need to get this bell over here.

296
00:52:57,639 --> 00:52:59,639
One more bell.

297
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:01,880
What do you think?

298
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,880
I heard it. Where was it?

299
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,059
There's this bell.

300
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,059
Is it up top?

301
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:23,619
Got stuck in a wall.

302
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:25,619
One thing about Tony Hawk is

303
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,619
you really need to start to memorize

304
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:29,619
the maps.

305
00:53:29,619 --> 00:53:31,860
It takes a while.

306
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,170
Then you'll know exactly where everything is.

307
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,170
You really just do it by skating around.

308
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,170
I shouldn't really be looking for them.

309
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:40,170
Just skating.

310
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,170
I always have skate.

311
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,170
T.E.

312
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,730
This one.

313
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:02,730
Whoops.

314
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,730
Whoops.

315
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,730
He'll do it for this game

316
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,730
but not hit and run.

317
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:14,730
I don't think

318
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:16,730
it's a fair comparison to compare

319
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,730
Tony Hawk 2 with

320
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,730
The Simpsons hit and run.

321
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:43,829
Beautiful.

322
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:45,829
Get up there!

323
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:49,860
There's a lot to do up there.

324
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:54,090
Shit!

325
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,090
I'm trying to grab it.

326
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:58,780
How many songs does it have?

327
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,780
I don't know.

328
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,780
I have no idea.

329
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,780
Probably like 15.

330
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:24,760
Three of five school bells!

331
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,699
There's another one over here.

332
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:35,559
Where's there?

333
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:39,559
It's up there.

334
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:43,559
How can I reliably get

335
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:45,559
up there?

336
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:47,559
I don't think it goes from here.

337
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,860
I hear the bell.

338
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,860
Where is it?

339
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,860
I can hear you.

340
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,860
Where are you bell?

341
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,860
I just heard you.

342
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,860
There it is.

343
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,739
One more.

344
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:11,880
Where's that last bell?

345
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,590
I hear it.

346
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:18,789
Where's the bell?

347
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:24,920
Where is it?

348
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,760
Where's the bell?

349
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,760
Where is the bell?

350
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,940
I don't even know.

351
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:44,139
Was it this one?

352
00:56:44,139 --> 00:57:03,829
Did I not even get it?

353
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:05,829
Skate around.

354
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:29,000
That's all I can do.

355
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I think the music is too loud for me.

356
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I can't hear any sounds.

357
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Sorry guys.

358
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,940
I can't really hear what I'm doing.

359
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:51,369
Yeah, that's better.

360
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:53,369
20 community subs from Freudian Weapon.

361
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:57,210
You guys with the community subs lately.

362
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,900
It's been so many of them.

363
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,219
Just hundreds.

364
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:05,659
Almost a thousand probably.

365
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:07,659
In the last five or six days.

366
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:09,659
Get it?

367
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:17,719
Ah.

368
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:19,719
Walride is so finicky with these.

369
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:21,719
Some of them are just stuffed in a corner

370
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:23,900
and you really have to just...

371
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,900
There's no real reliable way to get some of them.

372
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,900
Just stop what you're doing and go get them.

373
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,480
Holy shit guys, seriously.

374
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,340
I'm always missing one.

375
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,340
Because this is four.

376
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:42,889
Now let's see what this is.

377
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:44,889
This is down here in the little school yard.

378
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:56,340
Let's try to get them.

379
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,579
Is this one?

380
00:58:58,579 --> 00:59:01,400
And down here.

381
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,730
I'll just grab everything I can.

382
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,730
That makes it down here.

383
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,349
It's not one itchy fucking neck.

384
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:12,619
It was so bad. It was so itchy.

385
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:22,090
What is going on with my neck?

386
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:29,130
It's like

387
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:31,300
under my chin area.

388
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,670
That's getting like bit by a fucking

389
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,670
scorpion? What the hell is going on?

390
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:38,489
Speaking of what's going on.

391
00:59:38,489 --> 00:59:40,489
Ten more community subs by getting the clown car.

392
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:45,860
Ten

393
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,489
more on top of everything else.

394
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:52,650
Fucking ridiculous.

395
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:54,650
Unbelievable.

396
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:59,320
Ah.

397
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:12,380
I didn't get it. I get it.

398
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,380
Let's see if I can just hop over.

399
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:18,460
Right here. Shit. A little too far.

400
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:21,400
Five more from Juno.

401
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:27,539
Juno. On top of the

402
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:29,539
probably two, like there's probably

403
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:31,719
two thousand community subs on this channel.

404
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:33,719
I'm not even going to lie.

405
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:35,719
I really think there are probably at least

406
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,719
fifteen hundred to two thousand community subs on the channel.

407
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:39,719
That's insane.

408
01:00:39,719 --> 01:01:00,199
Forget about just getting speed to do it.

409
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:07,940
Oh I made it.

410
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:10,179
No no no. Stop stop stop.

411
01:01:10,179 --> 01:01:12,179
There's something down here right?

412
01:01:12,179 --> 01:01:15,639
Not really. This just kind of ends the trick.

413
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:27,670
Ah coming at an angle.

414
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:30,099
That's the worst one to get.

415
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:32,099
Because you have to go at a slight angle

416
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:34,099
to get the bells.

417
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:36,099
And that's just plopped right in this weird spot

418
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:38,099
in the corner. You have to get it almost from this side.

419
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:42,139
Because trying to reliably get it

420
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:44,139
this way is sort of not

421
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:48,170
really feasible.

422
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:51,110
What else we got? Money?

423
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:05,059
Hitbox is dumb.

424
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:07,059
Yeah it is a little dumb but it's alright.

425
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:16,409
I think I want to try the other level first.

426
01:02:16,409 --> 01:02:20,949
I'm going to hop past this other.

427
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:27,670
Some of you guys seriously

428
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:32,019
have so many subs.

429
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:34,019
There's almost seven thousand subs on this channel.

430
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:36,019
In the last three days.

431
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:38,019
Do you understand how insane that is?

432
01:02:38,019 --> 01:02:41,539
There wasn't...

433
01:02:41,539 --> 01:02:43,539
There's been like almost a couple thousand

434
01:02:43,539 --> 01:02:45,539
added in the last week and a half.

435
01:02:45,539 --> 01:02:47,539
That's absolutely ridiculous.

436
01:02:47,539 --> 01:03:01,500
This is all

437
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,500
really seriously has been in the last not even

438
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:06,179
thirty days. I really hope

439
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:08,179
you guys can like afford it.

440
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:10,179
Because that's a lot of money.

441
01:03:10,179 --> 01:03:13,699
That's like a huge

442
01:03:13,699 --> 01:03:17,289
amount of money. My God.

443
01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:19,289
Thank you.

444
01:03:19,289 --> 01:03:21,289
I just hope you take care of yourself first.

445
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:30,380
Visual Warlock

446
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:36,519
ten community subs. I'm going to try

447
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:41,769
the other level. I want the points.

448
01:03:41,769 --> 01:03:54,630
Thank you so much guys.

449
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,630
That's twenty from AmScoots.

450
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:58,630
Thank you AmScoots for twenty community subs.

451
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:04,900
Dropping sub missiles.

452
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:14,230
This is France.

453
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:16,230
What was the point? Things for France.

454
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:21,159
Alright, not again.

455
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:24,039
No, not again. No.

456
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:26,039
Every stream can't be a money stream.

457
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:29,050
That's thirty-three from

458
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:31,050
Soft33. With the namesake.

459
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:35,400
Thank you so much for the

460
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:41,670
thirty-three community subs.

461
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,550
I don't even know what to say. It's

462
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:49,289
shocking to me.

463
01:04:49,289 --> 01:04:55,559
You guys are fucking too much. Thank you.

464
01:04:55,559 --> 01:05:00,360
Five more from getting the clown car.

465
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,820
He's

466
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,820
complaining about getting money.

467
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:08,570
No, it's just

468
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,570
those of you that have been watching the channel for the last

469
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:12,570
week. It's been

470
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:14,570
an uncountable amount of money.

471
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:16,570
An extreme

472
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:18,570
amount of money.

473
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:20,570
Thousands of dollars. Like probably five or six

474
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:22,570
thousand dollars.

475
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,570
I don't know how to react.

476
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:26,570
It's so much money.

477
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:34,250
It's super overwhelming.

478
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:52,679
The more money the more taxes.

479
01:05:52,679 --> 01:06:10,650
I wish there

480
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:12,650
was more I could say. I really wish

481
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:20,579
there was. Some of you guys are

482
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:22,579
so generous that I don't even know what to say.

483
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:26,679
Let me restart this.

484
01:06:26,679 --> 01:06:31,800
You're just telling him to stop because you're going to blow it at the casino

485
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:38,139
anyways.

486
01:06:38,139 --> 01:06:40,139
So this one is in heats. I'm in direct competition with

487
01:06:40,139 --> 01:06:52,230
other people. But you guys are

488
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:57,159
incredible. Thank you so much.

489
01:06:57,159 --> 01:07:08,739
Fucking incredible.

490
01:07:08,739 --> 01:07:22,820
I gotta string something together here.

491
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:29,929
No!

492
01:07:29,929 --> 01:07:34,280
I had it. That's ten songs in

493
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:40,039
one minute I know.

494
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:42,039
That's the nature of Tony Hawk though. You gotta restart.

495
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:44,409
You have a good string going.

496
01:07:44,409 --> 01:07:47,480
I'll close it up there.

497
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:55,860
Oops.

498
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:57,860
Shit. Don't restart.

499
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:04,150
Stay on it.

500
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:13,619
It's ruined for like fifty thousand.

501
01:08:13,619 --> 01:08:20,149
I think that'll be good.

502
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:24,119
Special.

503
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:30,119
Oof. Got it.

504
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:37,529
Ninety-three thousand.

505
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:41,819
That should be enough to give me a cross, right?

506
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:43,819
Ninety-five point three. I'll take it.

507
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:50,979
Ninety-five. Ninety-one.

508
01:08:50,979 --> 01:08:53,220
Fifty-seven. I win.

509
01:08:53,220 --> 01:09:02,569
Boomer becomes expert skater in an hour.

510
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:06,470
And I like to see myself

01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:14,539

Over here.

514
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:26,500
This one has a lot of rails.

515
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:32,970
A lot of strings you can do in this one.

516
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:37,189
Going for a hundred thousand.

517
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:39,560
Ow.

518
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:54,149
Shit. I'm trying to get too funky with it.

519
01:09:54,149 --> 01:10:04,069
I need like at least

520
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:06,069
I gotta string it together right now. Let's go.

521
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:13,239
Alright. Here we go.

522
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:22,710

community subs. We're gonna have more

526
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:37,239
subs than viewers.

527
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:42,100
We actually do. Still in first place?

528
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:55,020
The math works out.

529
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:57,020
Last heat. I need a hundred thousand here.

530
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:05,850
Alright. End it. End it. End it. End it. End it.

531
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:22,939
Hop off. Let's try it again. String it up

532
01:11:22,939 --> 01:11:32,859
around the bench.

533
01:11:32,859 --> 01:11:36,569
I didn't get the dark slide. Come on.

534
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:46,170
I need a hundred thousand. Oh no.

535
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,600

01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:59,100
Go. Go. Go. Go.

537
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,529

538
01:12:01,529 --> 01:12:06,250
enough.

539
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:09,899
Thank you Tyga for the five community subs.

540
01:12:09,899 --> 01:12:11,899

the Dreamcast.

548
01:12:37,909 --> 01:12:42,899

01:50:56,010 --> 01:51:03,670
game but this one this is definitely my favorite skating game of all time it's ollie north is

662
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:42,060
just fucking me so bad right now it really is whoa manual there whoops a daisy

664
01:52:04,069 --> 01:52:12,739
like tony hawke three i've come to the determination that there's no way i'm

665
01:52:12,739 --> 01:52:17,859
going to be able to do any of these strings without more ollie and more air because that's

666
01:52:17,859 --> 01:52:25,770
what's actually the problem that is the actual problem but tony hawke pro skater 3

667
01:52:26,489 --> 01:52:28,569
was very good too it was really good actually

668
01:52:32,010 --> 01:52:34,569
i like the stages in this better than i do in three though

669
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:48,420
yeah just end i'm gonna go to the next level oh no let me uh

670

672
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:32,199
this way

673
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:56,119
this way there's a couple things i think a little bell there's three okay now this is the

674
01:53:56,359 --> 01:54:05,960
there's another bell down here i think there's a bell up top left it's pretty certain i'm not

675
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:11,239
over here i'm gonna get up top i can hear it

676
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:34,500
i can hear you but i don't know where you are where is it i can hear it

677
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:48,380
i just heard them right okay i hear it right here

678
01:54:48,460 --> 01:55:09,000
i take it not over there where are you i just heard it again there's one down there but that's

679
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:23,000
not the one i'm hearing oh it's not this one it's oh it's right there whoa why was i hearing

680
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:28,359
these bells i'm hearing the bells all the way back there shit okay well i know where they are

681
01:55:28,359 --> 01:55:42,470
let's go it's just ambient noise i'm like where are the bells i hear them they're somewhere

682
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:52,279
over here speaking of bells it's like freaking me out i already got it

683
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:05,779
first of all take the other headphone out because i can't breathe with the two headphones in

684
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:19,399
all right let's go after this i'm gonna i'm gonna end the stream i think i think i'm like

685
01:56:19,399 --> 01:56:25,399
getting a migraine i think a migraine is coming on i'm feeling it like in my face

686
01:56:26,359 --> 01:56:32,180
sometimes it happens like i i can feel a migraine coming on here

687
01:56:32,979 --> 01:56:49,590
irritating but not yet let's go get these down here

688
01:56:51,909 --> 01:57:03,909
okay they call them oras it's called an aura when you just know you're gonna get a migraine

689
01:57:03,909 --> 01:57:08,869
and then you get a migraine it's really fucking weird all right where is this last

690
01:57:08,869 --> 01:57:10,630
bell it's uh i got the two that are down here

691
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:15,880
there's only one more like this way right

692
01:57:20,119 --> 01:57:25,369
i got that one over there that wall here i think right

693
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:36,359
five bells do i have enough to do anything else

694
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:44,979
yeah sometimes uh the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me with a migraine

695
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:52,260
is like sometimes an hour or two before i get a migraine i will get like splotching vision

696
01:57:52,979 --> 01:57:55,539
almost like i'm people when i look at them they look like they're a Picasso painting

697
01:57:57,460 --> 01:58:01,380
and that's not really happening right now but i'm getting like i don't know i feel like it

698
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:09,819
i feel like it might start happening here soon i get that with every migraine it's really weird

699
01:58:17,449 --> 01:58:23,880
it's called allison wonderland syndrome that's not happening right now i just have that like

700
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:37,720
kind of heavy back of the head feeling what was that what else was here let me see i got

701
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:48,579
that gamer nerd neck going a hangover i haven't had any alcohol i didn't drink today didn't drink

702
01:58:48,579 --> 01:59:01,189
yesterday this is a coke i'm drinking a coke coke but yeah i'm gonna call it here

703
01:59:01,189 --> 01:59:07,699
that's probably the smart thing to do for my health i thought it was gamer fatigue i wasn't

704
01:59:07,699 --> 01:59:11,539
the last like 45 minutes or so i i really thought it was gamer fatigue it's probably

705
01:59:11,539 --> 01:59:35,260
migraine yeah i gotta save it save the career it's already saved i think right

706
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:44,520

736
02:04:38,279 --> 02:04:44,520

737
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:52,170
i was like itchy i don't i think that was just like i don't know that was weird it was like my

738
02:04:52,170 --> 02:04:58,710
back yeah i don't know weird very strange and that was like an hour and a half ago so it

739
02:04:58,710 --> 02:05:17,609
wasn't gamer fatigue but uh thank you for the concern and i yeah i'm i'm absolutely going to

740
02:05:17,609 --> 02:05:23,609
prioritize my health and that's why we're ending early because i'm trying to escape this

02:05:23,689 --> 02:05:32,010
potential uh future issue for sure but thank you thank you uh soft for the 10 bucks soft 33

742
02:05:32,569 --> 02:05:38,250
and 33 community subs as well hey germa sorry i've been too busy with work to watch the streams

743
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:41,210
lately i've been wanting to give back to this awesome community and you for a while

744
02:05:41,770 --> 02:05:53,189
thanks for the years of laughs thank you yeah i get fairly stuck and overwhelmed sometimes

745
02:05:53,189 --> 02:05:59,420
when a huge amount of money comes in and it happened it's happened this this is kind of the

746
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:11,020
third stream in a row of monumental money and support and i i'm sorry i don't i don't necessarily

747
02:06:11,020 --> 02:06:16,149
sometimes i don't take it very well not necessarily take it well but sometimes it's

748
02:06:16,149 --> 02:06:26,819
hard for me to um mentally accept it sometimes and i know some people would just

749
02:06:26,819 --> 02:06:31,539
say well whatever you're gonna you're gonna be upset about somebody giving you money no it's not

750
02:06:31,539 --> 02:06:38,140
it's not that it's just it's it's a lot of support and a lot of money from people

751
02:06:39,670 --> 02:06:46,170
and sometimes it can be i i just want to make sure that it's worth it's worth it it can be

752
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:59,930
very very um i'm trying the word i'm looking for is it's not it's not a bad thing but when

753
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:02,729
i look at some of these numbers and i and i see some of the amount of money that people

754
02:07:02,729 --> 02:07:08,250
give and the amounts of subscribers that are on the channel it's kind of light kind of goes

755
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:14,890
into my eyes and it's like holy shit what the fuck this is fucking crazy and it happened very

756
02:07:14,890 --> 02:07:34,789
very quickly i do appreciate it it's it's a huge deal the hyper growth monetarily on this

757
02:07:34,789 --> 02:07:44,699
channel over the last two months three months is just it's wild and sometimes i just don't

758
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:53,140
kind of don't know what to say but i i'm i'm incredibly honored and happy that people

759
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:56,579
think this is a good community to be a part of and to spend that much money on

760
02:07:57,779 --> 02:08:17,939
thank you so much please excuse my sometimes shocked demeanor when it happens but thank

761
02:08:17,939 --> 02:08:25,399
you novi for the three dollars and 33 cents road to 10 000 subs i can't even imagine i

762
02:08:25,399 --> 02:08:38,380
can't even comprehend that number so you don't have to say anything just

763
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:48,840
yeah but also keep in mind sometimes when uh the string of the last few streams when thousands

764
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:54,630
thousands of dollars come in i i mean i don't want somebody to think that i'm just glazing

765
02:08:54,630 --> 02:09:02,310
over the donation but it it's it's it's difficult because i don't want people to

766
02:09:02,310 --> 02:09:05,270
think that like oh you don't have to say anything whatever here's just here's like five

767
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:23,539
grand it's like wow so i want to address it and but sometimes i kind of lose it a little bit

768
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:37,130
but it means a lot thank you all of you thank you uh jess homeboy for the one dollar tony

769
02:09:37,130 --> 02:09:43,430
hawk status in 2003 i was requested to meet with warner brothers about doing a film

770
02:09:43,430 --> 02:09:52,380
about it's called skate jam so there was going to be a tony hawk space jam that would have

771
02:09:52,380 --> 02:10:03,640
been ridiculous that would have been so good probably not though it would have been kind of

772
02:10:04,279 --> 02:10:07,399
i don't even know how good that could have been this potential there but i'm not sure

773
02:10:07,399 --> 02:10:13,239
where the ceiling is for that potential thank you dork cube for the one dollar another

774
02:10:13,239 --> 02:10:18,600
game for you to look into is thug pro it's a modded version of tony hawk underground 2

775
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:22,760
that has a handful of maps from every game in the series and an awesome character creator

776
02:10:23,319 --> 02:10:30,979
and online is fun i forget just how many tony hawk games there are there's a lot of

777
02:10:30,979 --> 02:10:38,359
tony hawk games but that's cool tony hawk's underground 2 was it playstation 3

778
02:10:42,359 --> 02:10:48,500
you just started watching and i mean yeah i'm sorry for the end i was gonna go for like

779
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:55,130
another couple hours but something in my i'm getting a like a little bit of of a

780
02:10:55,130 --> 02:11:03,539
headache-y feeling so i kind of gonna go relax but sorry for the five hour stream

781
02:11:04,180 --> 02:11:10,329
i like to go for at least six to seven nowadays uh but thank you dork you began

782
02:11:10,329 --> 02:11:14,090
for the one dollar you better play sonic adventure in its entirety including big the cat missions

783
02:11:14,810 --> 02:11:26,460
i'm not sure i'll get that far but maybe thank you peter for the five dollars actually beat

784
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:34,600
valgas on stream i went kicking and screaming but i did it peter thank you 15 dolls from

785
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:48,170
peter beat valgas on stream that was me uh thank you tar alecran for the two bucks hey

786
02:11:48,170 --> 02:11:50,970
germa now that we've got the dreamcast out is there any date on if when you're going to

787
02:11:50,970 --> 02:11:56,760
play shinmu i'm super excited for that stream and i don't want to miss it yeah i actually have

788
02:11:56,760 --> 02:12:03,819
shinmu now on pc so it'll be a little bit more higher fidelity you can probably expect

789
02:12:05,859 --> 02:12:13,640
the shinmu stuff to happen i would assume i'll probably start shinmu one after

790
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:18,439
resident evil 2 and resident evil 2 will probably only take one stream

791
02:12:19,079 --> 02:12:24,359
because from what i've gathered it's only about a seven to eight hour game to do

792
02:12:24,359 --> 02:12:36,100
there's like two campaigns right so at least for one of those campaigns bring back monster rancher

793
02:12:38,579 --> 02:12:44,789
but shinmu will happen eventually i own them all i own both of them uh thank you anon a list

804
02:13:47,909 --> 02:13:54,170
instead of two to get our bits read no how did six dollars come about six dollars

805
02:13:55,210 --> 02:14:09,180
well it was three who's spreading the six dollar lie that's not true thank you door cube

806
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:12,779
for the one dollar not only did domino's pioneer the stuffed crust this is how they

807
02:14:12,859 --> 02:14:17,340
advertised it domino's did not really think this is the right thing for us to be doing

808
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:27,500
divana what do people think let them talk it's wrong isn't it but it feels so right

when i think of bad games the good bad games i always think of these dreamcast exclusives

813
02:14:53,319 --> 02:14:56,520
you can tell the developers wanted to do so much but the system was holding them back

814
02:14:57,720 --> 02:15:08,100
maybe a lot of these old games a lot of the developers are still making stuff you really

815
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:15,659
only had it's like a goldfish right when you're in a tiny little bowl you're a tiny

826
02:16:24,039 --> 02:16:29,609
that up power stone i beat the game it was a lot of fun it was very challenging at the end

827
02:16:29,609 --> 02:16:36,840

834
02:17:25,979 --> 02:17:29,979
not all the dlc could be released before the dreamcast discontinuation so the developers

02:23:11,819 --> 02:23:21,159
people think are really great and i'd love to give them a try but thank you for the suggestion

i will definitely put it on the list and then finally here thank you tingy for the two bucks

886
02:23:25,559 --> 02:23:28,440
in a couple months my best friend might come visit me and we plan on hanging out and

887
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:34,040
drinking but this will be my first time consuming alcohol since you were since you

888
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:41,020
drink alcohol uh what's your best advice for first time drinking go slow go slow a lot of

889
02:23:41,020 --> 02:23:45,260
people do this thing when they first start drinking where they want to look like they

890
02:23:45,260 --> 02:23:52,120
can handle it to a point where fault you know no i'm good i'm good i'm good you want

891
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:58,680
to take a shot yeah yeah yeah and you overdo it so nobody no one's gonna be like no one's

892
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:03,579
gonna care if you have like two you know what i mean so you don't worry about what somebody

893
02:24:03,579 --> 02:24:14,469
might think and especially in the chat people are saying it already uh every pretty much every

894
02:24:14,469 --> 02:24:21,299
one drink you consume you want to drink like a glass of water well maybe every every two drinks

895
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:26,420
if you let's say you go into a bar after you've had two drinks order the third one

896
02:24:26,420 --> 02:24:29,620
and just be like hey can i get a water they'll just it's free they just they

897
02:24:30,739 --> 02:24:40,790
and drink the water now you don't have to like suck down water every 10 minutes because

898
02:24:40,790 --> 02:24:50,440
i mean that's not good for you anyways but you really look into maybe like every two or three

899
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:56,489
drinks make sure you have a water if you're at the bar and if you're not at the bar then just

900
02:24:56,489 --> 02:25:07,940
take it slow you still drink water and yeah and self-control too you just want to make

901
02:25:07,940 --> 02:25:13,479
sure you don't go too overboard but again that feeds back into the first thing that i said

902
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:22,100
which is you don't you don't have to impress anybody just take it slow and then finally clue
