00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,460
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with one of the weirdest games I've ever played in my entire life.

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,579
This is Pac-Man 2 The New Adventures, and if you don't know what this game is, then you are in for a treat.

3
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:28,219
You're in for quite a surprise, mainly because of the game's gameplay. It doesn't make any sense at all.

4
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:31,920
I'm not gonna spoil it. You'll see it in just a second. Gonna go into the live commentary here,

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,979
and I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.

6
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:44,530
So, as you can probably imagine, this game is not Pac-Man. This has nothing to do with the old Pac-Mans.

7
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,990
This is, like, I have a baby, I have a wife, that's Ms. Pac-Man, I'm assuming.

8
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,090
We're out of milk and Pac-Baby's still hungry. Can you go get some more milk, please?

9
00:00:55,929 --> 00:01:01,549
Sure, I guess why not? No problem. Welcome to Pac-Man 2 The New Adventures.

10
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,560
So, let me break down the controls real quickly here.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,719
I move this cursor around, and I can either shoot a slingshot to, like, get his attention,

12
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,890
and make him stop moving. Like, for instance, that didn't work. He just got really happy.

13
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,840
Stop. No, no, no. Stop with me. Stop with me. Stop moving. I have to, like, do this.

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,290
Okay, you're safe now. So, you have to interact with the world around Pac-Man to...

15
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,500
What the fuck are you doing? You're supposed to go that way.

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,459
Pac-Man has the attention span of a goldfish in, like, the first grade.

17
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,370
Alright, so you're getting happy.

18
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:55,219
What was that face? No, go back. You're going the wrong way, stupid.

19
00:01:55,219 --> 00:02:01,420
He just did this, like, I don't know, like, he did this crazy, like, old man, curled up litho.

20
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:09,259
I wouldn't even do that again. Go over and get the milk, you friggin' baby.

21
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:15,389
Oh, look, it's a chicken. Get the chicken. Shoot the chicken. Alright, get it.

22
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:25,009
I'm not exactly sure what the whole point of this game is, because it...

23
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,050
I'm sure it's becoming very evident right now, guys.

24
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,199
They thought Namco thought it was... Are you serious?

25
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,830
Did he just seriously walk into that? What an idiot.

26
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,240
Alright, just walk into something and let me have one of these.

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,300
No, go over here. Go to the hot dog man.

28
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,560
You pissy bitch, just go this way and look up. Talk to him.

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,379
Do you not see the hot dog man? Oh, oh, did you finally see him?

30
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:00,750
How do you not see this hot dog guy? Are you kidding me right now?

31
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,099
I just pissed him off.

32
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:09,680
What just made him so happy?

33
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,240
Why can I not just control him? Why didn't they make a platformer?

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,639
Why did they not make this game a platformer?

35
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,539
Why is it, like, a point and click, like, follow the moron around

36
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:28,389
and make him, like, look at stuff and get scared by, like, animals?

37
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:34,009
Nobody has any mail for Pac-Man?

38
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:37,909
I love that face so much. I love everything about that face.

39
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:46,199
Eat the apple. Eat it. You know, it's good. It's delicious.

40
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:52,319
All right, now sneak by this dog. Be careful. Look at the dog.

41
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,229
You just had an apple. You fucking idiot.

42
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:58,949
I just, I didn't tell you to do that.

43
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:02,770
Read the sign. He is so happy.

44
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,120
He doesn't even care that this could be, like, dangerous.

45
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:17,060
Grab that apple. Pick it up. What the fuck was that?

46
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:23,769
What the fuck are you doing?

47
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:28,379
Why did he just scream? What was the point?

48
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,870
What, what, who, who screams? Who screams for no reason?

49
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,839
Who, who, who screams?

50
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:53,649
Now he's depressed. Where are you going? Where is he going?

51
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:55,350
Oh, yeah, you should have looked out for that.

52
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:01,019
Yeah, you should have paid attention to your surroundings, you idiot.

53
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:03,220
Look, look, look, look, look. Don't trip. Don't trip.

54
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,389
You see it? Okay, step over it.

55
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,579
Yeah, it's a skateboard. Get on the skateboard.

56
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:13,990
Go have some fun for once in your life.

57
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,550
It's still telling me to get the milk.

58
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,639
All right, go get the milk. Go get the milk.

59
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,430
I need to do something. Go get the milk.

60
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,579
Go that, yes, yes, yes, yes, this way.

61
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,079
Sure, I know you're, I know you're upset.

62
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:41,740
I would be upset too if I tripped on a rock and screamed at a bird for, for seemingly absolutely no, my fucking God.

63
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,430
Pac-Man's very chaotic life is kind of like managing a sim.

64
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,329
When you have a sim that is unhappy, they don't go to work right, they don't perform well, they have bad...

65
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,850
Oh shit, hold on. Okay, I don't want to get in trouble by that.

66
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,290
But when you have a sim and they're not like at their peak happiness, you can't do anything with them.

67
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,089
They don't want to do anything. They're too tired. They're too hungry.

68
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:08,779
I at least have all my bars filled up on the happiness and energy meter.

69
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:17,459
So I should be able to do this now. Pick up the milk, please.

70
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,129
Stop whistling to yourself and pick the milk up.

71
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:30,250
Please, please pick up the, please just stand, stand, get underneath it.

72
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,829
There you go. Do you see it? Okay, you see it.

73
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:37,879
Here we go. Bang. It worked. I'm going to, I'm going to get the milk.

74
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,579
I know I pissed him off in the process, but it's okay. Just, just get your composure together.

75
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:48,939
Get yourself together Pac-Man and pick up the milk and go get the milk.

76
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:57,240
Watch out. Don't trip on the rock. Get off the skateboard.

77
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,639
Actually ride the skateboard. There we go.

78
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:21,600
I even told him to look too and he just didn't. I think he just has tunnel vision.

79
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,579
Are you going to actually listen to me this time? Look, look to the ground.

80
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:31,360
Stop. Why are you riding a skateboard with your eyes closed? What are you doing?

81
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,259
Who closes their eyes and rides a skateboard?

82
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,160
That's the dumbest thing I've ever fucking seen somebody do.

83
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,829
Hey, yeah, I'm going to get on a skateboard. Might as well close my eyes as tight as I can.

84
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:52,569
This is ridiculous. How am I supposed to make him not close his eyes?

85
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:55,069
Here he goes again, closing his eyes.

86
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:58,120
What if I shoot him? Will he like open his eyes?

87
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:10,069
Hey, there we go. All right. So to get him, yeah, yeah, thanks.

88
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,120
Does this honestly surprise you every time?

89
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,949
This can't surprise you every time it happens.

90
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:21,689
I wonder if he's going to stop and like look at the cow for the fourth, fifth fucking time in a row.

91
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:25,490
Hey, look, I love cows. Hey, let me stop and like look at the bird too.

92
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:31,009
He's like, I've never seen a bird before. Is there another bird in here?

93
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:36,120
Yes, birds. Oh, look, another bird. Isn't that wonderful?

94
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,279
Goal. Goal.

95
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,080
That's a nice walk you got there, Pac-Man. Nice high legged walk.

96
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:52,409
Oh, yes, you want a hot dog. Oh, yes, I love hot dogs.

97
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:56,940
You cat son of a bitch.

98
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,629
What are you doing? What does he do? What does he do?

99
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:11,309
Get the cat. No, no, no, no, no, don't get another one.

100
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:12,309
Don't get another one. He's going to spray you.

101
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:18,220
He's going to spray you with ketchup. Eat the pill and it'll make you feel better.

102
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,519
Oh, my God.
