00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,370
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,330
Got a couple of things in this video. This is gonna be a Spicycle one-life gameplay.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:15,939
Gonna show you two lives though. The first one's gonna be with the Default Invisibility Watch,

4
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:21,699
and the second one's gonna be with the Dead Ringer, and in between I've got a crazy Demoman thing

5
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:26,820
that I did. So the intermission between the two one-life gameplays is gonna be something I'm

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:34,329
coining right now. The most destruction I've ever done as a Demoman. Period. Comma. Quotation

7
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:40,009
marks. So stick around, we've got some things to talk about, especially about this knife.

8
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,929
So let me get you the loadout for the match. The loadout is gonna be the Spicycle, obviously,

9
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:49,609
get this nice sap and stab on that engineer. The Spicycle. The Diamondback. Now I know,

10
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:53,929
hear me out on this one. The Diamondback and, of course, the Default Invisibility Watch.

11
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,259
So I get a couple of kills with the Diamondback. I feel like the Diamondback is very,

12
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,939
very underused when it comes to spies. A lot of spies would just rather say,

13
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:06,180
why don't you just put on the Ambassador? And I'd say, well, because I can get guaranteed

14
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,549
critical shots like this right here. Miss. Don't miss. But with this gun, you don't have to shoot

15
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:17,189
somebody in their face to get a crit. All you have to do is destroy one little building,

16
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,109
it could be a teleporter, it doesn't matter, dispenser, anything, and you'll get a guaranteed

17
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:26,709
crit. The reason why I would say to use this is because I've found in so many situations,

18
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:32,150
I've been backing up with the Ambassador, trying to headshot somebody that's coming after me,

19
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,950
and I just miss, no, hold on, I got it, miss, no, I can get it, and you just miss over and over again.

20
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,870
With this thing, you just have to land a body shot and you'll crit them. And they both do the

21
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,909
same amount of damage. They both crit for 102. So if you're having trouble aiming at heads with

22
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:50,810
the Ambassador, try the Diamondback. Unless, of course, there are no engineers on the other

23
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,609
team. If there's zero engineers on the other team, you're just taking a 15% damage penalty,

24
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:00,980
that's all you're doing. So enough about the Diamondback, let's talk about the Spicycle.

25
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,620
So this knife is pretty close to taking over all the other knives and being the best one in the

26
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,939
game. Now there are plenty of downsides, of course, as you'll see here when I stab somebody,

27
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:14,580
they turn into an ice sculpture. And that's a huge dead giveaway that you're around, and of course,

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,020
if you get sprayed by a Pyro, you lose the knife for 15 seconds. But the really good thing about

29
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,219
this knife, it's the only other one in the game that shares the same attributes as the default.

30
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:29,539
There's no crazy health mechanic or no weird stabbing mechanic, which is something I really,

31
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:35,139
really like about the knife. And now let's talk about Pyros for a second. Pyros are the number

32
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:42,039
one counter to a Spy. And with this knife, they're no longer your counter. You'll see so many times

33
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,919
in these couple clips where I get sprayed by a Pyro and nothing happens and the Pyro just goes

34
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:53,319
on his merry way. That is a huge, huge upgrade, insane upgrade, because now you don't have to

35
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:59,430
worry about Pyros. If you have this knife out, you completely negate your counter. So here comes the

36
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,909
end of this particular run. Got a bunch of kills, got a bunch of saps on Sentries. Pretty decent,

37
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:08,710
but now I want to go to a Demoman clip, just because I have to put it in here, use it as an

38
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,189
intermission. So I have the default sticky launcher, the default grenade launcher, and I think the

39
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:17,909
frying pan, but none of that really matters. Watch what happens here in a second. I get an uber charge,

40
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:22,949
and over on the left, if this is not a great example of why you should never build close to

41
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:27,349
each other as an engineer, then I don't know what is. Look at this. Look at all this stuff,

42
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:33,430
all these buildings. Goodbye. Everything and everyone over there is dead or destroyed. I'm

43
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,979
going to do a slow-mo for you. I want to count. Let's count together. Ready? So it looks like

44
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:44,310
one, two, three, four, five buildings and like four people. So I just thought that was insane.

45
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,310
Had to put that in here for a little intermission, because I've never done something like that before.

46
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,870
So moving right along here, this is the second Spy gameplay using the Dead Ringer instead of

47
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,629
the Invisibility Watch. I also have on the Letronjo or the La Torenga, however you want to pronounce

48
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:04,469
that pistol. So I come up here, get this Pyro, and I want to explain why the Dead Ringer is a great

49
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:09,349
option with this new knife. So pretty much the reason why you use these two things together is

50
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:14,469
because it allows you to escape more than once. How many times have you been a Spy and gotten

51
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:19,509
sprayed by a Pyro and then sprayed immediately after pulling out the Dead Ringer? Say goodbye

52
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:24,790
to that ever happening ever again by using these two together. Pretty much what you can do now is

53
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,430
you can take out the knife when you get sprayed, and it's sort of the first Dead Ringer. You get

54
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,029
two Dead Ringers now, and then when you actually really need to use your real Dead Ringer, you pull

55
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:39,829
it out. So you get two second chances, I guess, rather than one second chance, if that makes any

56
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:44,870
sense. Now which one of these would I rather play with, the Dead Ringer or the Invisibility Watch?

57
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,620
Kind of a tough question, because they're both very, very good. It just depends on your play style.

58
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,259
Something very, very important that I really need to bring up is make sure you do not have the knife

59
00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:00,259
up and the Dead Ringer up at the same time. If a Pyro sprays you, it's going to use your knife and

60
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:04,420
the Dead Ringer. So be very, very careful in those situations. You want to make sure you have your

61
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,420
pistol out. If you see a Pyro, pull out something else rather than the knife, like the Sapper or

62
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,819
the pistol. Get sprayed with the knife out, and then you can go on your way and use the Dead Ringer.

63
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:16,100
It's happened to me a couple of times. I'm still trying to get used to it, where I'm walking around

64
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,019
with the knife. I get sprayed and I have the Dead Ringer out, and it's like, whoa, what just happened?

65
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:25,290
I lost everything. Just be careful. That's all I'm saying. Be careful. And I'll just talk about the

66
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,370
entertainment value of this knife. It doesn't matter if it's with the Dead Ringer or with the

67
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,810
Invisibility Watch. The entertainment value is awesome. It's so much fun, because this knife

68
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:41,050
allows you to be a real master of disguise and master of deceit. Because when you get sprayed

69
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,850
and you don't light on fire, you kind of have to play the role and kind of look at them and be like,

70
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:52,250
ah, dude, I'm not a spy. Screw you. Excuse me. And it really does add another layer to the

71
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,930
meta game as a spy. You could go an entire round as the spy, not even killing anybody,

72
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,170
but just trying to blend in with the other team. I've seen people do that before. I've seen funny

73
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,730
videos where people just troll the other team, and they just put a disguise on, and they pretend to

74
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,810
be like an engineer or something, and it's actually kind of funny. So it makes it a whole lot easier

75
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,579
to blend in now, and it makes it a whole lot more fun, too. So we are coming up here to the end of

76
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:20,139
the video. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. I get myself killed by

77
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:26,379
a Crusaders crossbow medic, and I think that's only happened like two or three times since that item

78
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:32,149
released. So thumbs up to that guy. Actually, I love that weapon. I could talk about that weapon

79
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:37,509
for a while, but that's for a different commentary. So I come back here. I believe I kill a heavy,

80
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:41,670
and my demise is I didn't do this in the right order. I should have sapped that little mini

81
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,709
century first, but I didn't do that. 2020 hindsight, you know. But yeah, thank you all

82
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,870
so much for watching. I'll see you all next time. Take care, everybody.
