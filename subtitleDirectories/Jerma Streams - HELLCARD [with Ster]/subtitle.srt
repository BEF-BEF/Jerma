1
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:29,530
Hello, how are you? Early stream? Hmm, earlier. Earlier.

2
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:46,740
I hope everybody had a good 4th of July. That sounded like I just sipped a bunch of whipped cream off.

3
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,250
Well, I don't even care. That's a new me.

4
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,149
I'm not gonna do something that sounds weird and then explain it for five minutes.

5
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:11,370
No, it's a new me. New me. Yes, you will, probably.

6
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,469
And in pre-stream earlier, somebody was saying,

7
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:22,239
Oh man, I... What if it happened to the... That like, jacked, like wicked red Jerma.

8
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:32,760
Man, like what happened to him? I just want to say, welcome 25 to 35. Good luck.

9
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:48,150
Mm-hmm. Yeah, 25 to 35. Okay. We'll see. New? You're old.

10
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:57,959
They were just joking? As am I. As am I. Don't worry, we're all joking here.

11
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,599
So today we're playing with Ster. Ster is here.

12
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:08,759
I don't want to introduce him yet because I want it to be a big surprise when he shows up.

13
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,889
The plan today, Ster was like, hey, this is a game called Hail Card. Looks pretty cool.

14
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:17,789
I was like, yeah, I'll get it. So I got it.

15
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:24,800
We also have two other games that we might move to. Maybe not. We'll see.

16
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,020
I didn't mean it in a bad way. No, I know. I'm just kidding around too.

17
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,280
I have a very important question for Ster. Actually, a couple.

18
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,490
Hey, I have a couple questions for you. Oh, yeah.

19
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:48,960
Question number one, what temperature do you put your thermostat on a hot day?

20
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,110
That's a really complicated variable question. It is. I know it's loaded.

21
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,650
Because in the winter, I was explaining this the other day,

22
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,250
you got to set it at a certain temperature at which the AC triggers,

23
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,620
not the temperature you actually want it.

24
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,020
Do you understand what I'm saying?

25
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,919
So like in the summer, if I turn on the AC and put it at like 78,

26
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,620
it'll trigger and it'll be really cold in here.

27
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,520
But in the winter, if I put it at like 72, that's when it'll, I don't know.

28
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,520
That's what you mean. But you said 78.

29
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,919
Well, I don't think it's actually 78 in here.

30
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,020
That's what I'm saying is that it's like the AC is fighting that the fact

31
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,259
that it's a hundred degrees outside and it's just on.

32
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,460
I would like a like a true thermostat because this thing, I think it's a liar.

33
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,659
You also have the same problem where the room that you are in right now

34
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:45,759
gets to like a hundred degrees, but then you will go out of that room

35
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,460
and the room that actually has a thermostat in it is like nice and cool.

36
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,259
Yeah. Well, that's the also if you stream in a room, it will be 80 degrees.

37
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,870
There's no way around it.

38
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,659
And those of you that have like your gamer room.

39
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:03,830
So I put my AC when I'm streaming 73.

40
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:10,150
Okay. Yeah. I usually try to keep my between 76, 75, 77.

41
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,650
Maybe if I'm not really streaming or anything, I could fill up.

42
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,220
Good answer.

43
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:22,259
Oh, yeah. Well, like if it was 75 or 78, this room would be 85 degrees to 90.

44
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,160
Regardless of the rest of my apartment would be cold.

45
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,360
Yeah, I put it at 73.

46
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,240
So it like continues to pump cold air in here because otherwise it doesn't care.

47
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,040
I don't exist to my AC. All right.

48
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,240
What about let me ask you this.

49
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,839
What about the I'm seeing a lot of people in chat right now.

50
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,439
And I know a lot of people in my, you know, personal life to like friends

51
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,579
and family members that say that I'm fucking nuts for having my thermostat

52
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:51,439
at like 77 or 76 because they like what are you talking about?

53
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,420
Like it needs to be in the low 70s or high 60s for me.

54
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,980
And to me that kind of that's kind of like a like like a freezer to me.

55
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,120
Is it to you too?

56
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,220
I don't know.

57
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,819
See, that's where it all comes down.

58
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,379
It might be 60 in the rest of my apartment sometimes,

59
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:12,180
even though it's set to like 73.

60
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,180
That's what I'm saying.

61
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,279
Yeah, like I don't get an even distribution.

62
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,279
If you set your thermostat to like if it's a hot day or whatever,

63
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,180
if it's like during summer and you set your thermostat to 68,

64
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,180
I'm not even sure my therm.

65
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,579
I don't think I could even get the temperature to be 70 degrees right now.

66
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:29,980
If I tried it's just like a hundred hundred and ten degrees out right now.

67
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,759
Hundred five, whatever it is.

68
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,910
I'm not even sure I could actually even happen.

69
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,310
Do you like going out in a hundred and five degree weather?

70
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,310
Actually, I do.

71
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,410
And that's like that makes me a weird thing too.

72
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,509
I if it's a hundred and five out, I want to go outside.

73
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,209
But then when I'm inside, it's got to be really cold.

74
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:49,209
If it like if it gets to like 80 90 in here, it's disgusting.

75
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:50,009
Can't handle that.

76
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,009
So but so you like it at like a hundred and ten outside

77
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,550
and you like it at like 70 inside.

78
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,449
Yeah, I need a refugee.

79
00:05:58,449 --> 00:05:58,850
Okay.

80
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:58,949
Yeah.

81
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:01,350
So that's refuge.

82
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,149
I need refuge.

83
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,350
Germa.

84
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,750
Are you a lizard?

85
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,149
I like it hot.

86
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:07,449
I like the hot weather.

87
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:10,779
I actually enjoy it.

88
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,990
You two are reptiles.

89
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,120
Oh, it's going to be heating up in here.

90
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,920
I hate the heat.

91
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,879
I want to cry if it's hotter than 85.

92
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,079
Just start crying.

93
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,379
The moment it goes from 84 to 85.

94
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,579
You just start like, no, this is too much.

95
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:32,379
You're sitting there looking at a thermostat like, no, don't please don't.

96
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:33,480
It's like 84.

97
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,879
No, no, no 85.

98
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,120
But the real feel is 70.

99
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,720
72 to 73 is perfect.

100
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,759
I think.

101
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,779
Do you want to play the game that you want to play here?

102
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:49,079
It's funny that you phrased it like that.

103
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:55,500
I mean, because I feel like this is just not going to hold your attention.

104
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,399
And the first thing someone said in my chat was like, can't wait for

105
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,889
Germa to get bored of this in 30 minutes.

106
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,189
So we have two backups.

107
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,189
But here's the thing.

108
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:06,399
Hold on.

109
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:12,139
Yeah, I'm ready.

110
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,040
Okay, there's the alright.

111
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,939
I am ready.

112
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:16,540
You say like, you know what?

113
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,139
On one hand, I appreciate you agreeing to play this.

114
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:19,439
Yeah.

115
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,139
On the other hand, I wish you'd just say shut up.

116
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,040
That's I don't know.

117
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,139
I'd rather do something else.

118
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:27,629
Oh, like you said when I invited you to the house flipper thing on Tuesday.

119
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:28,129
I don't know.

120
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,620
I don't know if I'm going to be here on Tuesday.

121
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,120
I mean, I'll do it.

122
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,420
Well, no, yeah, you can't because now I can't.

123
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
Well, I confirmed the list.

124
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,319
I confirmed the list.

125
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,519
You couldn't add plus one to the list.

126
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:47,029
I could fucking your best man at your wedding.

127
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:49,629
Do you want I I was just messing around.

128
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,550
But do you actually have you want to do it?

129
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:53,750
I can know by the end of the day.

130
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,750
I'll be here on Tuesday.

131
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,660
Okay, you're going to do it and you're not here's what I think you're going to do.

132
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,360
It's everyone's timed everyone gets 70 minutes to make a house.

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,160
And I know you're going to do 70.

134
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,060
It's not enough time.

135
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,459
Trust me.

136
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,990
We I've tested you're going to get in there.

137
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,189
He's doing full runs to test.

138
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:12,790
Oh, I have a hole.

139
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,389
You're slow.

140
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:14,689
You're slow as shit.

141
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:18,189
How many times did you like stop to explain something when you were building your house?

142
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:19,990
Yeah, but when you're on a timer, you can't do that.

143
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,490
You got to go.

144
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,490
But here's what I think you're going to do.

145
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,600
I'm going to take your joke from you and I'm going to ruin it.

146
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,899
Okay, you're going to show up.

147
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,160
It's going to be like, all right, everybody get started and everyone's going to be so like, let's go.

148
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,560
I'm hype.

149
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,519
You're going to make a big deal about how hyped you are about this.

150
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,429
You are then going to exit house flipper and go do something else.

151
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:40,230
And then when your time slot is up, it's just going to be the default house.

152
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,169
It's like that you didn't even do anything.

153
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,269
I'm not going to lie.

154
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:44,570
That was my first idea.

155
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,870
Yeah, and it's a good idea.

156
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,269
Like I don't want to agree to do this whole thing for this one joke.

157
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,970
And it's the most predictable joke.

158
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,769
He knows I'm going to do but then I came up with joke too.

159
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,039
Still like it's still just like 60 minutes for one joke.

160
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,740
I don't know.

161
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,590
You could if you really want me in this room.

162
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:09,620
I mean, what is it scored on creativity complexity going to be really biased

163
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,220
because someone told me that you could like import images.

164
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,620
Yes as your wallpaper.

165
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,220
So I just feel like whoever does the drama memes on the wall is going to win.

166
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,470
If why would I I'm going to I'm going to be doing it very seriously.

167
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,070
I'm going to be taking it dead seriously.

168
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,570
It's I don't think you can creativity.

169
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,870
I don't think you can separate yourself.

170
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,570
Like once you enter a room and it's like, oh, this is the auto room

171
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,970
and it's like all dog toys and pictures of auto on the wall.

172
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,120
That person won.

173
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,899
So they didn't win.

174
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:41,720
They got points for philosophy because that's one of the categories.

175
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:41,919
Okay.

176
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:50,340
Yeah, there is creativity complexity structural integrity cleanliness

177
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,950
philosophy and chats grade.

178
00:09:52,950 --> 00:10:02,070
Well, let me ask you this in your own home decor decoration type

179
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,070
strat like your own home.

180
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,269
Yeah, what how is your home decorated?

181
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,269
Do you decorate your home?

182
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:11,220
Do you go around like all this painting would look great in my Fourier?

183
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,019
I mean sometimes.

184
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:15,860
Yeah, I think when you get like a new place you kind of look around

185
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,769
and you go, all right, I could see maybe like a painting there

186
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:23,470
and be like a furniture piece that you do your own design philosophy

187
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,370
when you first I guess when you first move in I don't do this every day.

188
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,769
I don't walk around and go I don't walk around my you know, look at my Reddit

189
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:32,669
shelf and be like, hmm, what should I add?

190
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:33,470
I did it.

191
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,870
I did my decoration shelf.

192
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,169
I read it shelf.

193
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,129
You have a Reddit shelf.

194
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:40,929
It's just that's like the what everybody calls it because they make fun of me

195
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:41,629
for it.

196
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:44,980
I have a shelf that has a bunch of like trinkets on it.

197
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,179
Oh, you like framed photographs of all of your favorite comments from Reddit.

198
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:55,210
No, it's all my favorite stream items.

199
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,009
It's a little like pieces of memorabilia for me to remember like,

200
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:59,809
oh wait, I remember I did the dollhouse.

201
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:02,409
There's like the dollhouse the 985 sign.

202
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:04,269
It's nice to come in and look.

203
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:06,470
Yeah, I would be all white walls.

204
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,470
No decorations.

205
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:15,200
The only reason I have anything on my wall is because the camera points at it.

206
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,629
It's like you want me to come in a house flipper and I'm a minimalist.

207
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:20,929
Hey, the invite is there.

208
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:24,230
If you if you want to do it, I can get you just said the invite wasn't there

209
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,730
anymore.

210
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,230
But then you told me you had like, okay.

211
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,909
Well, here's the way we got to give the context to everybody listening.

212
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:35,789
I reached out and hey stir good buddy know each other for like 30 years.

213
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:42,889
You want to do a house flipper house and your reply was stop talking to me,

214
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:45,220
which was which was hurtful.

215
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,789
And I figured it was I give you a few days.

216
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:50,690
And then when I tried again, I said, hey, just want to check it in again.

217
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,750
If you curious if you want to do that house flipper thing, you sent me a gift

218
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:01,110
of the current the frog drinking the tea and was like, yeah, it was like one.

219
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,179
I don't know.

220
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,250
It was kind of it was kind of hurtful.

221
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,049
Do you know my favorite gift images?

222
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:07,059
What is it?

223
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,779
And it relates to this.

224
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,950
He doesn't know my favorite gift.

225
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,750
You have a giga Chad is a giga Chad.

226
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,990
No, it's the orangutan trying to nail the nail into the wood, but he's not

227
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,620
actually doing it.

228
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,820
David Attenborough are doing a tumbleweed just went by.

229
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,080
We have to like press play.

230
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,679
All right.

231
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,679
I mean, you're going to like a check out.

232
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,580
I got a laugh.

233
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:34,980
You got it.

234
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,149
Well, we have a DM open if you want to show it to me.

235
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:40,519
I could find it.

236
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:40,720
All right.

237
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,269
It was just if I laugh then you don't have to do a house flipper house.

238
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:49,190
If I do laugh then you do wait.

239
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,200
They said it wrong.

240
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,250
Which one is more beneficial to you me losing or winning?

241
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,860
I didn't even hear the terms and conditions.

242
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,059
I just said it and I don't remember either.

243
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:04,769
Let's just play while I'm opening.

244
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:09,580
I just got it.

245
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,879
You're a don't laugh.

246
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,750
Okay, if I laugh at your gift, I'm I can see it.

247
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,450
It's over there right now.

248
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,629
I'm not going to look though.

249
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,759
If I laugh at this if I genuinely go, okay, that's funny.

250
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:22,919
Then you don't have to do a house flipper house.

251
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:33,799
If I do laugh if I don't laugh, you know, I'm just going to look at it.

252
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,100
All right.

253
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,899
That's funny.

254
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,200
It's the best thing on the internet.

255
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,000
It's pretty funny.

256
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,500
Yeah.

257
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, that's all I love that.

258
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,899
It kind of looks like it loops and he's just trying.

259
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:43,500
He's been trying for a really long time.

260
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,830
My favorite part is he's got it in his mouth and he kind of like he kind of takes it out.

261
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,000
Okay, you ready?

262
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,659
I don't know.

263
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:57,820
You have any any more anymore zany things to talk about before we come up with it.

264
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,220
We're ready.

265
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,720
We're okay.

266
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,840
Yeah, it'll it'll it'll come up.

267
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,340
I don't know if you can see the screen.

268
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,539
I'm choosing the destination.

269
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:05,340
It's like a roguelike.

270
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,440
There's 12 floors to the final boss.

271
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,320
I get to do you give like a TLDR for what is going on.

272
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,019
I haven't played this game before.

273
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:16,019
My interpretation is that it's slay the spire with friends who play the spire.

274
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,460
You know, you battle the enemies of the gift.

275
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,009
It's quite clear.

276
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:24,509
Did you not show it on your stream?

277
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:26,110
I just looked over at your channel.

278
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:26,980
Let me get it.

279
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,279
Okay.

280
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,370
He doesn't care about the viewer experience.

281
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,889
I guess how do I even doubt?

282
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:40,570
Well, it's not I don't have this on my computer like you do.

283
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,269
You do because I sent it to you.

284
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:46,549
But I have to save it and like copy it and then put it over here.

285
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:51,139
Not I mean, no really.

286
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:55,500
You can drag it from discord into your OBS window.

287
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:02,139
I can't it doesn't let me do that.

288
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:03,740
Don't don't make up stuff reviews.

289
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,639
Okay.

290
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:19,299
Okay.

291
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:20,799
That's it's pretty funny.

292
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,500
It's okay.

293
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,700
You don't have to make a house if you don't want to but wait, what if I want it to then?

294
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,409
Yeah, then I'll give you a time slot.

295
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:30,220
Wait, there's time slots.

296
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,120
I don't think there's like 12 streamers doing this.

297
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,419
I thought they were all going to be doing it at the same time.

298
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:38,720
Yeah, but then after you have to give me a tour like you can't do it.

299
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,519
Everyone can't do a tour at the exact same time and you have to like schedule an open house.

300
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,679
Yes, there are 12 people doing this is the game multiplayer.

301
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,379
Like you walk you go to their house.

302
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:55,899
No, it's going to be discord sharing or through their stream.

303
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:58,279
You mean there's going to be 13 people.

304
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,379
Well, it depends.

305
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:01,879
There's still one or two you in the game.

306
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,580
I'm Vince.

307
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
I've been in the game the whole time.

308
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,279
I don't we were choosing floor one.

309
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,179
It gives you an option you encounter skeletons and a Smith or a vault where I haven't played this either.

310
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,179
I'm ready stir.

311
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,580
The only reason why people are here is to watch us argue.

312
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,580
So don't worry.

313
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:27,070
I know but I picked the most complicated game to argue over because you're going to have to like read cards and understand things and mechanics when we really should just be like doing a food podcast.

314
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:32,250
Yeah, how do I ready up?

315
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:32,850
I don't know.

316
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,070
I've never played this before.

317
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,700
Do I have to choose a ready button on each floor?

318
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,399
You have a choice between two monsters guarding different locations.

319
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,840
Each hero makes their own choice.

320
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,789
Oh, oh, okay.

321
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:49,299
Zombie corpse or skeleton.

322
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,200
Would you do left one?

323
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,940
I don't I think maybe it'll even pick whatever a skeleton.

324
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,340
Okay, it shows what we picked above our characters.

325
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
All right, let's go.

326
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,539
Yeah.

327
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:00,039
Yeah.

328
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:00,740
Wow.

329
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,940
No cam.

330
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,580
If you're good, I'll turn it on.

331
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,019
You have a cam on right now.

332
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:11,230
I mean, I do.

333
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,829
All right.

334
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,089
So what do we do?

335
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,000
You attack cards drag to the enemy using your mana.

336
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,299
You've never played slay this fire.

337
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:20,599
I have.

338
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,779
Yeah.

339
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,279
But do we go at the same time?

340
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,480
Is it turns or is it?

341
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,250
I we're going to find out block cards.

342
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,849
Yeah, that just gives you the armor.

343
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,160
Yep.

344
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,359
Tell what a monster is doing by the things above their head.

345
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,940
Yeah, they're intent intent.

346
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,539
Yep.

347
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:42,880
Just like I played a little bit of Slay This Fire.

348
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,079
Okay.

349
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,380
The circle around us represents melee range and rain.

350
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,880
And okay, I'm done.

351
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,579
I can't I'm done.

352
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:49,279
Okay, that's it.

353
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:49,680
That was it.

354
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,079
That's it.

355
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,579
I read it all.

356
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:50,980
We're good.

357
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,079
I think we go simultaneously.

358
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,579
So like where are you?

359
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,450
I'm on the left.

360
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,849
Oh, we have like, okay.

361
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:00,150
We have two halves of a screen.

362
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:04,420
Yeah, and then your manas you got three mana.

363
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,829
I assume at the bottom.

364
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:06,630
It's a dude.

365
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,930
So I'm going to attack this try to attack people on your side.

366
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,930
Should we just go the same person?

367
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:13,069
Can you attack the zombie?

368
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,430
Yeah, I don't.

369
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,259
Okay, can you kill that guy?

370
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:22,940
And then I'm the Ranger then I have one mana to kind of cool

371
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,240
actually.

372
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,539
All right.

373
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:29,130
So I have to block now and now we in turn this is kind of cool

374
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,680
and then they come get us.

375
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:39,759
So when they're in the circle here that imagine that it said

376
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:42,160
when they're in the circle, they count as being in melee range.

377
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,460
Oh, okay.

378
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,490
Special heart icons to read their tooltips special features

379
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,269
only attacks only from near range.

380
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,799
I picked the game with reading man.

381
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:00,799
I can read I just did source.

382
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,799
When are you going to play sorcery?

383
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,500
You ever going to do that?

384
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,900
I played sorcery one on stream.

385
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,599
It's I'm telling you your chats going to love it.

386
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,450
Just going to love it if you do but every time I play a game

387
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,250
like that my chats like you why do you just play every game

388
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,900
Jerma plays stop saying that to him.

389
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
Stop saying that to him.

390
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,990
Stop you're hurting my feelings.

391
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,220
Stop saying that the great game.

392
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:29,420
They said if you play sorcery, we're done with you.

393
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,309
There's a better playthrough on the internet.

394
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:35,069
It's not true.

395
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:40,650
All right, so mighty blow you'll to damage in a medium radius

396
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,349
random monster and radius is okay.

397
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,980
So this will hurt to these two people.

398
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,890
I should probably block right with the mana because I'm going

399
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,890
to be the one taking all these hits.

400
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,230
You're taking a lot of hits you're taking out.

401
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:54,930
Oh, you're good.

402
00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:02,109
You were taking a minus three fantastic for in the tutorial

403
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:02,609
level.

404
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,349
I think we got this why have a max amount of shield I can have

405
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,200
as I probably just what the hell just happened.

406
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,299
I just did two shield blocks and it took me down to one shield.

407
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,400
Oh, that's mana.

408
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:14,799
Oops.

409
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,480
All right, so that's one whoops.

410
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,230
Are you going to hit them ever?

411
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,829
I mean it's I could try hitting them but seems like that's

412
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:33,730
something that's on your agenda.

413
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,430
Well, your armor doesn't carry over to the next turn.

414
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:39,130
So you had six armor and they did like two damage to you.

415
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,799
That's Matt.

416
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,769
That's just simple math or Sarah.

417
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:48,869
Are you turned on your webcam to compete with me?

418
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:49,369
Yes.

419
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,210
Nice.

420
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:52,309
You what do you have?

421
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:53,509
What kind of hair do you have?

422
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:01,859
What I'm going to swing what kind of hair all right my sides

423
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:10,180
clear yours isn't my sides clear easy.

424
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,279
No jokes.

425
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,380
This is actually pretty cool.

426
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,380
This is like a cool concept.

427
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:16,029
No jokes.

428
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,329
That's why we're playing it.

429
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,119
Do we share this or is this for each of us?

430
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,619
I believe it's for each of us.

431
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:24,220
It's offering me rogue cards and you're getting warrior cards.

432
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,819
I thought you were going to be the wizard to be honest.

433
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,589
I feel like we needed a shield guy.

434
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,940
I took some aoe and I don't know what this gem is to what

435
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,539
a stamina can be added or subtracted by special card.

436
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:42,640
What does stamina do?

437
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,539
Is that just like the stamina?

438
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,420
I don't know.

439
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:51,549
I feel like this is going to be hard to use.

440
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,559
I'll get the short sword stamina is mana.

441
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:56,859
Okay.

442
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,910
Nice.

443
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,009
No sporadu here.

444
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:00,609
That's fine.

445
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,779
Why does everyone all of a sudden think you're a vampire?

446
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:12,630
Because we made like a little jokey reference.

447
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,900
Somebody made a picture of me with like powdered face in

448
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,299
like a full Dracula costume.

449
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,700
And then I said I would do it on Halloween.

450
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:26,539
I would do that exact outfit and you didn't do it.

451
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,039
Well, it's not Halloween yet.

452
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,339
Halloween is on October.

453
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,789
I guess I don't have enough money.

454
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,039
Vault.

455
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,309
Oops.

456
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,509
Okay, those look kind of grayed out.

457
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:39,769
Okay.

458
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:43,089
Wait, what are you picking any of these?

459
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,230
Yeah, so you get gems.

460
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,230
I got four gems.

461
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,650
Scoop is given you like, I don't know if we would choose.

462
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,549
I don't know if we have like the same choices.

463
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,019
Yeah, how come there's a refine?

464
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,660
Ooh, okay.

465
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,940
I'm going to write a random card shield block is going to

466
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,839
turn into.

467
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:06,819
Ooh, this is good for both of us.

468
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,319
That's good for both of us.

469
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,720
That gives you shield as well.

470
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:10,819
I'll be support.

471
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,869
Okay, get a random artifact of any rarity.

472
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:22,789
I'll try that you'll free HP after each battle.

473
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:23,490
You survive.

474
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,089
That's pretty good.

475
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,339
Maybe we shouldn't spend all of our money.

476
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,579
Yeah, I only spent one.

477
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,980
Not all of them cost money.

478
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:40,160
Cool.

479
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:47,190
Okay, and then we go down to the next floor and I get it.

480
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,589
That's fun.

481
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:49,920
What did you get for eight max HP?

482
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,519
That's pretty good.

483
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:53,119
You should think about a new haircut.

484
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,019
Well, I was in the middle of growing out every single like

485
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:57,819
piece of hair.

486
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:00,160
It got pretty long up here.

487
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:01,859
It was I had a really big beard.

488
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,890
No, it was unbearable in the heat.

489
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:09,960
It was like 115 at one point in Vegas here last week.

490
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,640
I want to say and I just it just like it had to go.

491
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,940
It was unfucking bearable.

492
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,460
Skeletons weren't that bad.

493
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,960
What is the fucking you've been in Vegas too long.

494
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,190
We're doing like some Elvis shit.

495
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,309
What is this?

496
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:31,710
What is what you seen Street?

497
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,609
You played Street Fighter.

498
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:33,819
Yeah, right.

499
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,119
What are you talking about?

500
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:37,220
You just really got inspired by Marissa.

501
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:39,119
You thought like I hairstyle looks sick.

502
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:39,920
I can pull that off.

503
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,880
I don't know what you're describing.

504
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,480
What's going?

505
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,180
What are you talking about?

506
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,289
You ready to go next floor?

507
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,930
I've had this hair for I I used to do e3 presentations

508
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:49,630
with this hair.

509
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,769
This has been a lot e3 presentation.

510
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:53,970
Yes for a long time.

511
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,809
Not officially not officially speaking, but you know,

512
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:02,700
I would everybody it's this is I do this all the time.

513
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:05,339
Oh, yeah.

514
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,039
I was presenting for my game company that I was a part of.

515
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,299
Oh, yeah, I remember I remember.

516
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:15,789
We keep teaching new things.

517
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:20,140
They work over time.

518
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,900
Okay cooperation is key.

519
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,200
Click on your teammates avatar to see their deck and map right.

520
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,299
Click on a spot on the floor to get okay.

521
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:33,500
Well, we're in a call so we can just yeah, we're not we that's

522
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,700
all irrelevant to me.

523
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,769
I think we actually have to start doing strategy though.

524
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:42,470
I think that that they that pop-up was hey, you know, you know

525
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,039
how to play the game now.

526
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,140
You need to communicate.

527
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,140
So how do you want to do this?

528
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,390
We got I don't understand.

529
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,589
What was the buff thing that they were talking about?

530
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:56,029
Yeah, they went away the influences.

531
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:00,339
I'm going to give us or block.

532
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,859
I think that's a good use of our time here and then I'm going

533
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:05,759
to deal.

534
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,680
This is going to be three four.

535
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,279
I'm good.

536
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:15,720
I can take all these hits and I'm going to do a I'm going to

537
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
hit these this guy right here.

538
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,039
Actually, I'm going to hit the archer.

539
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:25,380
That's weird that sometimes when I shoot enemies out of my

540
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,259
out of this like far away this zombie and I don't kill them.

541
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:31,460
They've returned one damage to me like it's like slay this

542
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:31,660
fire.

543
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,559
Like, you know, you hit the thing but it feels weird when

544
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,660
you're a range character and they're that far away and he's

545
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,259
a zombie and I can clearly see that he's a zombie.

546
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:42,759
Was it a ranged zombie like a zombie mage or something?

547
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,460
No, it's like when you hit something they hit you back.

548
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:46,859
Oh, it's like the boom.

549
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:47,660
You both did damage.

550
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:47,859
Okay.

551
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:48,259
I see.

552
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,160
Yeah, the hearthstone cards bumping.

553
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,460
Yep.

554
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,380
Okay.

555
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,220
Rose a bone in me.

556
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,619
This monster is buffed.

557
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,019
He's got five damage.

558
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,319
This is going to hurt a lot.

559
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,920
I'm about to take 10 damage.

560
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,420
If you die, I can kill me.

561
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:05,019
I'm shooting him.

562
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:09,470
God you're about to take five still.

563
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:11,660
Well, not necessarily true.

564
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:12,859
Wait, wait.

565
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,559
Oops.

566
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,430
Can you block me?

567
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:19,059
It doesn't matter.

568
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:19,960
I can block you.

569
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,789
Yes, and then I can kill this guy.

570
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,450
I'm still going to take one damage though.

571
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:32,420
Oh, cuz those long-range guys are shooting you know, what

572
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,220
is shake down?

573
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,420
You'll did you just do that?

574
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:36,490
Yes.

575
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,089
Oh, that's what you are playing.

576
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,490
I get it my gems.

577
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,900
Yeah, better be better be grateful.

578
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,460
Wait, how do I I can't use my blocks on you.

579
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,660
That's that's a you thing.

580
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,859
You can't do it to me.

581
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,289
I'm getting kind of hurt here.

582
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:04,509
All right, you you're okay.

583
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:07,829
Yeah, why do they all want to kill you?

584
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:09,529
I think I'm the tank, right?

585
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,059
I'm going to give us this yourself like a tank.

586
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,099
Let's do that.

587
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,039
I mean I could I do I I deal more damage to things when

588
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,240
they're outside the circles.

589
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:23,109
So when they're all coming in this circle, I start to

590
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:24,210
become pretty useless.

591
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:26,660
So I can kill the range guy.

592
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,950
I guess I can kill the guy right next to me and then

593
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:33,849
you're kind of on your own.

594
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:34,349
Yeah, we're good.

595
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:35,250
We're good.

596
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,720
And take any damage.

597
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,509
I had your stream muted for like two minutes and I

598
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:42,609
didn't even realize it.

599
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,430
You probably busy with something.

600
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,140
You probably had something else going on.

601
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:58,279
I can kill this guy and then I'm going to give you

602
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:02,190
some block and then I'm going to swing my sword at

603
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:04,309
this one.

604
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,609
Okay, I didn't spend the gems.

605
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,450
It just isn't showing the gems on the UI yet or

606
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,839
while we're in combat.

607
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,440
You asked her if he had a good breakfast.

608
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Did you have a good breakfast?

609
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:21,950
Did I did I would you have let's compare breakfasts

610
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:28,029
as that's on I think today I had a what did I have

611
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:32,779
I had a I just had a sandwich just like a two slices

612
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:33,180
of bread.

613
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,779
You put meat and cheese in between it tight.

614
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:35,480
What was this?

615
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:36,180
What was the meat?

616
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,660
Ham salami Muenster cheese sandwich.

617
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,180
Okay, that's like I would eat that.

618
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,759
Okay, but you're you're about to like embarrass me

619
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:53,759
with this incredible.

620
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,740
No breakfast you had I had.

621
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,940
I drank full serving of kefir.

622
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:04,819
It's just like a yogurt drink and then I had some

623
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:09,900
greens what I don't know when I say it like that.

624
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,099
It sounds like I am kind of trying to be better

625
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:12,500
than you.

626
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:16,349
There's the inflection of the green and some greens

627
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,250
because like you didn't say you had green so I was

628
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,950
like trying to make it seem like I was like way

629
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,049
better than you at breakfast.

630
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:23,750
Hey, I didn't I did not have a balanced breakfast.

631
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:26,150
I normally wouldn't have that for breakfast and

632
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,549
I'm kind of embarrassed and you're putting me on

633
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:28,049
the spot.

634
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,029
What a health nut.

635
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:38,829
I'm really not.

636
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:43,230
Oh, is it just gambling?

637
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:46,559
You have a 50% chance to find three gems.

638
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:48,579
Well, I lost.

639
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:52,849
I got him.

640
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,099
I'm doing the I'm doing the gem build.

641
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,200
There's a lot of rogue gem cards.

642
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,279
Okay, I can exchange this you'll damage equal to

643
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,079
your block.

644
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:07,880
Hmm.

645
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,940
I don't like that in a boomerang shield.

646
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,859
I mean why not free free and then I'll do this

647
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,160
and I lost again.

648
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,099
You're poor.

649
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:34,079
That was like 50 52 50 50s losing them both you

650
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,779
will encounter Templar.

651
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,980
So this is we can upgrade our cards.

652
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:43,150
All right, so they these these mean very important

653
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,250
thing.

654
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:47,500
Yeah, the type of enemy you fight and the reward

655
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:48,730
you want.

656
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:49,930
What do you have on you?

657
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,329
We choose our own and then the end where it shows

658
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,529
like the three options I think are based on

659
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:55,230
what we chose.

660
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:55,730
Okay.

661
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,369
Well, I made it hard because I Templar is going

662
00:31:58,369 --> 00:31:59,690
to fight us.

663
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:00,089
Okay.

664
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:03,490
Well, how do you know what Templar is hard Templars

665
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,289
are usually weak because when they go to swing

666
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:07,690
at you they go wait would God want this and they

667
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,930
hesitate that looks like a hard enemy as 15 health

668
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:15,410
I got an I got a card.

669
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:17,009
I got a trump card for that guy.

670
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,940
So right now I'm going to shield block you out.

671
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,710
Let me shield block you first if you're going to

672
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,509
take damage because you'll get it did literally.

673
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:28,109
I don't know why I did literally nothing.

674
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:34,900
I'm going to do mighty blow.

675
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,200
What is this new thing here?

676
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,599
What is that above the imp block against three

677
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:53,720
block from a fix your sideburns there?

678
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,819
They probably all messed up right now.

679
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:55,220
It's fine though.

680
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:04,930
I don't care to ignite bombs.

681
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,140
All right.

682
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,180
Well, I'm in a little bit of trouble here.

683
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,940
Oh, you see, okay.

684
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
I put a bomb out there.

685
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,410
You see the bomb on the right this thing here.

686
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:25,470
Yeah, and I have to ignite it and the other Templar

687
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:32,309
I bombed him you're in danger there pal the first

688
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:34,210
monster I could kill the one here.

689
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:34,809
I could do okay.

690
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:37,009
I could do for damage to the Templar.

691
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:38,920
I got it.

692
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,220
I'll just okay.

693
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,190
I can't kill this imp but I could kill the yeah,

694
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,190
I'm going to kill this guy and then I will just

695
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:54,569
do a oh with it not in the circle thought he's

696
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:55,069
in the circle.

697
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,799
I think when they're on the line that's considered

698
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:06,769
mid-range or can you remove this charm that you

699
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:09,309
put on me just go eat a banana.

700
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:12,260
You'll be all right that does fix it.

701
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:20,880
Usually I'm going to I was going to attack this

702
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:21,880
person right next to you.

703
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:24,079
Thank you.

704
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,000
What did you do?

705
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:29,690
I kicked him away.

706
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,579
We don't got to kill him this turn or you had

707
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:36,280
lethal you had to make them did I did I actually

708
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,780
have lethal I can't see your cards.

709
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,079
Why do you have two webcams?

710
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:51,949
Do you you should get like five of all different

711
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:52,750
angles of your head.

712
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,449
Did I tell you about the stream that I really

713
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:58,360
wanted to do and it was I wanted to get like 30

714
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,190
webcams and have them all set for different

715
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,590
timings and stuff and have them delayed at

716
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,389
different times so I could like yell at myself

717
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:06,590
and fight myself and stuff.

718
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:10,920
Okay, you go Andy.

719
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,579
Well, I I talked to I talked to Jake about it

720
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:21,300
community Jake and he was just like I don't

721
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,300
think what you want to do is physically fucking

722
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,000
possible.

723
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,599
I was like, okay, I was like, all right yourself

724
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,500
on a camera.

725
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,340
I was like, whatever if it's not going to work.

726
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,139
It's not going to work.

727
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:44,710
Here there's also it was it was this was like

728
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,210
kind of COVID was still kind of COVID was like

729
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:50,510
people were locked down was happening and I

730
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,510
didn't want to because like webcams people doing

731
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,210
a bunch of zoom calls and be needing to buy

732
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,019
webcams and I didn't want to be the guy that

733
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:59,420
like wiped out the fucking webcam supply during

734
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,320
COVID by buying like 40 of them.

735
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:04,539
It was like, I don't think I want to do that.

736
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:06,639
I think that's probably like not a good idea.

737
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:09,619
Oh, we won.

738
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:11,219
I could understand that argument if you went to

739
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:13,590
the grocery store and like bought all of the

740
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,460
food, but these you're talking about webcams.

741
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,360
Yeah, but there was I feel like there was like a

742
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,559
weird price surge with webcams and it was like,

743
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,460
oh, they're like very expensive now because

744
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,760
people are buying them to a ton of people are

745
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,920
buying them.

746
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,119
I was like, I don't I want to be the guy that

747
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,719
has I don't know.

748
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,619
I don't know if I want to do it.

749
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,840
I got like test ones at one point at some point

750
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,239
later.

751
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,340
I got I want to say like six and I tried to

752
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,809
hook them all up and it was like this is fucking

753
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,809
impossible and it just made me frustrated and

754
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:57,679
I just can the whole thing just delay the single

755
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,880
webcam 30 times.

756
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,980
There is some weird reason why I couldn't do that.

757
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,409
I forget what it was, but I thought of that you

758
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:09,710
can barely use one webcam.

759
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,010
Yeah.

760
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:12,309
Yeah, it was a USB thing, right?

761
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:15,210
Yeah, it was like the amount of USB bus slots

762
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:17,309
that are on a motherboard like it couldn't do

763
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:17,909
it or something.

764
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:21,880
You can you can get a like a USB extension.

765
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,579
Yeah, but I think it's still uses the same bus

766
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:24,980
lane.

767
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,179
I really think so.

768
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:27,980
I looked into this and I was like, well fuck.

769
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,579
I can't do this.

770
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:32,489
I have a I forget what you call him like a graphics

771
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:32,690
card.

772
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,389
You plug it into that slot and it has USBs on it.

773
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:39,659
I have one of those like why couldn't you do that?

774
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:40,730
I wouldn't.

775
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,429
It was something it was something and I think the

776
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,230
only way I would have needed to have like four

777
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,420
motherboards and it's just like this is this this

778
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,920
is turning into like a like a science YouTube video

779
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,119
that I'm not making and I'm not I don't think so.

780
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:58,559
So you so you gave up I did.

781
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,159
Yeah, some ideas you just kind of move on.

782
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,320
Okay.

783
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:03,619
Yeah, that's true.

784
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:05,320
All right.

785
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:13,550
I'm going to refine this one's good.

786
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,050
Hey maker.

787
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:21,579
All right.

788
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:23,940
Hey maker or maim.

789
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:27,130
Oh, I love my names.

790
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:41,340
I'm doing a maker and then I'm going to do so I

791
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,340
get both of these.

792
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:49,780
Oh, I like that.

793
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,480
Wait, what a strain do is that like you can't lose

794
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:52,980
you lose.

795
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:54,280
Why you spend your money?

796
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,559
No, my build gained strength from how many gems

797
00:38:58,559 --> 00:38:59,059
I have.

798
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:03,269
I are in my build German.

799
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,019
Do you want removal on the next rest period?

800
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:14,579
Do you want new cards new cards?

801
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,780
I want to see the new cards.

802
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,599
Okay, I want to see what's out there in the big wide

803
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,570
world just by 40 PCs.

804
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,599
I agree with that.

805
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:32,090
I know this one looks hard.

806
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,840
Yeah, you ever seen a snail dude.

807
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,239
Yeah.

808
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,269
So when these firearms fly into the near range,

809
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:43,570
they explode when they die.

810
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,440
So you got to watch out for that.

811
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,739
I heard us with it last round.

812
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:53,909
I didn't know I'm going to give this to you and

813
00:39:53,909 --> 00:40:02,269
then I'm going to slash this one.

814
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:04,070
I'm going to slash this morning.

815
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,269
Yeah, wait, should we kill this thing?

816
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:09,639
It's in here at the top this thing right here.

817
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,739
Do you have one damage not in close range?

818
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:16,139
No, oops.

819
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:22,880
Well, I killed it didn't have to hello.

820
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,480
It was weird.

821
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,289
You look like Anakin from episode 3.

822
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,559
That sounds like a compliment Anakin is one of

823
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,960
the most powerful Jedi's to have ever existed.

824
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:43,440
Cool.

825
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,349
How come every time I take that test I get Yoda

826
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,719
which is also amazing by the way.

827
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
Yoda's pretty sick.

828
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:02,739
All right, you're just kind of cute five damage.

829
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,179
Does anybody have block on right now?

830
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:08,550
No, I can't really do anything this round.

831
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,650
You want me to just do here.

832
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:19,909
It's hard out here.

833
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,960
Can I hit everybody with this?

834
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,599
I thought it would could only hit two people.

835
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:27,500
That's amazing.

836
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:27,800
Okay.

837
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,300
Well, I almost just cleared my whole side.

838
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,699
You have a favorite Star Wars character.

839
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,070
I don't know the big one.

840
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,900
Jabba.

841
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:45,860
Yeah, how about the Hutt is your favorite Star Wars

842
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,460
character.

843
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,369
I'm not I don't know too much about Star Wars,

844
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:50,269
but I know he's cool.

845
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,199
Mine's Luke.

846
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:56,920
Lame.

847
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:59,619
If your answer of your favorite Star Wars

848
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:01,719
character is like the protagonist.

849
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,579
Lame.

850
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,480
Luke is actually really cool though.

851
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,679
It's not Luke, but I would say Luke is cool.

852
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:14,710
That's a bad take.

853
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:16,510
Yeah, that's a pretty shit take stir.

854
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:25,409
Why because okay, what if the main character

855
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:28,610
of a show is really really awesome like really

856
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,010
cool and like wow, what a great character.

857
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:33,590
Let me ask you this.

858
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:35,289
Have you played Red Dead Redemption 2?

859
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:39,960
No, what?

860
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:41,900
Okay.

861
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,400
I played half of the tutorial and I was like,

862
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,800
I don't think I really want to do this.

863
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,199
What no way you've never really good.

864
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,260
Wow.

865
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:51,760
Okay.

866
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:55,699
But did you play GTA 5 all the way through you did

867
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,900
didn't know I got to that mission where you had

868
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,199
to start like loading cargo at the shipyard

869
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,179
and I was like, this isn't what I signed up for.

870
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:08,159
I kind of lost interest in the story.

871
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,860
Oh, I just exploded that you got any armor for me?

872
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,099
I did.

873
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,699
I got rid of it.

874
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,260
But anyways, my point was going to be that Arthur

875
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,860
Morgan is the main character and I think Arthur

876
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,159
Morgan is probably one of the coolest characters

877
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:24,960
in that whole game.

878
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:27,159
Like is that is that wrong?

879
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,659
Which one's Arthur Morgan?

880
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,480
Dutch.

881
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:32,969
I can't do it.

882
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,670
Oh and Red Dead Redemption.

883
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:34,969
Yeah.

884
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:37,400
What are you talking about?

885
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,420
That was not a great impression, but yeah,

886
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,019
but we're talking about Star Wars.

887
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,019
Yeah, but I'm saying but you said the main character

888
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,019
thinking the main character is the best character

889
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:52,260
in the series is lame is what you said.

890
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,559
Arthur Morgan is not lame and I think he's the

891
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:55,360
best character in that game.

892
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,860
No, no, no, no.

893
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,760
I'm talking about Star Wars.

894
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:00,760
Okay, I'm talking about in general.

895
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,059
Oh, characters are bad.

896
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:05,460
Okay, everybody settle down reason, but like when

897
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,659
you're talking about Disney Star Wars, like I want

898
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:08,960
to be the protag Luke.

899
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,659
He's so strong.

900
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,360
They have like no personality.

901
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:15,239
You really want to you your main your favorite

902
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,440
character is Luke when there's characters like

903
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,590
Jabba the Hutt all the side characters in Star

904
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:24,090
Wars are cooler than the main protags because

905
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:24,989
they're not human.

906
00:44:25,389 --> 00:44:29,789
It's always the default anime protag human male

907
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:31,489
white male hit with the hair.

908
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,320
I did not I did not know you with this strongly

909
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,219
for I thought you meant all I thought you meant

910
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,820
all fucking like media.

911
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:47,619
Dude any show I've ever seen the main character

912
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:49,059
so boring.

913
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,059
That's what I thought you like our main character.

914
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:51,659
I don't like that.

915
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:54,059
I like the weird side character that was in two

916
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:56,690
episodes, which is they're still cold.

917
00:44:56,789 --> 00:44:58,590
I have a lot of favorites that are like that.

918
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,170
They're the they're the blank slate that you put

919
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,210
inject yourself into and you you love that guy.

920
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,309
Don't you know?

921
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:12,409
Well, hold on this thing.

922
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,809
I think silent protagonist.

923
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:18,840
Yes, I think a silent protagonist you're imprinting

924
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,139
yourself on a silent protagonist.

925
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,420
I think that it has a kiss his sister.

926
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:27,869
I don't maybe I don't know.

927
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,199
Yeah, no points for that.

928
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,599
I was ironically saying Luke.

929
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:37,199
I don't think Luke is the coolest character in the franchise.

930
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:38,099
It's ironic.

931
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:38,900
I was pulling back.

932
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,000
I was just being ironic.

933
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:43,389
So is your general Grievous is my favorite character

934
00:45:43,389 --> 00:45:44,489
in all of Star Wars.

935
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:48,400
Okay, if you want me to give it to you, I do.

936
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,900
Did you pick a card yet?

937
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,400
I'm confused.

938
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,239
Sure.

939
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:02,500
I picked a card general general Grievous.

940
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:02,900
There it is.

941
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,599
I think I've told this story to you and multiple times

942
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,699
before that when I was a child in the first grade

943
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:08,699
Star Wars was really cool.

944
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,800
I'd never seen any of them, but I knew it was cool.

945
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,199
And when I was out shopping with my mom, I saw

946
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,099
a t-shirt with one of the droids on it because that movie

947
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:18,400
had just come out and I was like I want that so I can fit in

948
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,400
and that's all I know about the Clone Ward bought movies.

949
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,690
Okay, that's kind of cool though.

950
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:26,590
I don't know anything about general Grievous.

951
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,289
I just know that he's got four lightsabers and he still

952
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:30,789
can't beat a guy with one.

953
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:39,099
I'm about to get really heated at that point in episode 3

954
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,400
general Grievous was already very injured.

955
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,300
Not only that he was injured previously before the events

956
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,000
that happened in the prequels very seriously injured.

957
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,409
Okay, hold on.

958
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:53,800
I got to settle down.

959
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,599
He literally wasn't.

960
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:01,059
I don't know the lore.

961
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:03,659
I wish I could debate you more, but I actually haven't seen

962
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:03,860
it.

963
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,760
You just don't know the lore.

964
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,260
That's okay.

965
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:13,489
Oh, you're great out.

966
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:18,559
You're a Star Wars nerd.

967
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:20,519
I'm not really.

968
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,420
I haven't seen any of the newer things.

969
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,559
Why not?

970
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:28,900
I don't know because it's just too much of it.

971
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:33,519
It's like I it's there's just too much.

972
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:34,320
It's too much.

973
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,960
I don't I don't I don't want I don't there's too many

974
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,860
things to watch.

975
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:41,449
It's just like I it's like, oh the Mandalorian Mandalorian

976
00:47:41,449 --> 00:47:43,750
and then we got like all these other like Obi-Wan stuff.

977
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,550
And then there's they're making like another movie.

978
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,360
They're making like another TV show and then it's kind of

979
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,360
like the Marvel stuff for me.

980
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,860
It's like my this is too much of it.

981
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,579
It's just I don't even it's like I don't yeah.

982
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,679
Yeah, I you know, I agree.

983
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:56,980
I would much prefer if they made a Dune movie and it was

984
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:01,699
like one third of the first book and nothing really happens.

985
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,599
I made this joke like a year or two ago, but I was going

986
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:06,900
to say like I can't like let me just say it out loud

987
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,400
because it's very good.

988
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,190
I think I made a tweet that I didn't tweet it saved in

989
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,690
drafts.

990
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,329
So, you know, like that as you will it said I can't wait

991
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:19,230
for phase six of the Marvel Cinematic Universe when it's

992
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,429
a baking competition between Wolverine Cyclops and

993
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:25,469
Professor X like reality show.

994
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:31,409
That's pretty damn weird.

995
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,610
Wait, where did I missed a few sentences there?

996
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:38,619
How did we jump from the what I don't think you were

997
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:40,119
paying attention to what I was saying, but it's okay.

998
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:40,789
Okay.

999
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:41,389
No, I wasn't.

1000
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:45,880
I was thinking about doing wait.

1001
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,980
There's a TV series.

1002
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,730
You ready there were what a boss fight.

1003
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:54,480
I think we're fighting the Whopper from the Big Mac.

1004
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,579
We're fighting the Whopper.

1005
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,579
Yeah, I don't think we're there yet.

1006
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:00,579
We have another floor.

1007
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:01,349
All right.

1008
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:02,349
How about the wild hog?

1009
00:49:02,349 --> 00:49:02,949
That sounds good.

1010
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:12,300
We're gonna eat a VLT kill curse ghost.

1011
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:17,730
That's a lot.

1012
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:20,230
That is a lot boys.

1013
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:26,219
What do these do attacks only from near range heels itself

1014
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:30,159
at the beginning of monsters turn and it's rotten.

1015
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,760
So you have to kill these things that they hurt you.

1016
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,829
Okay, the big skeleton the Whopper is the Whopper.

1017
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:37,429
All right spawns a skeleton every time it receives damage.

1018
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:39,619
So don't just go tickling him.

1019
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,320
Oh, I thought a lot of skeletons.

1020
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,119
I thought you were just saying the Whopper.

1021
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,320
This is the actual name of the Whopper.

1022
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,679
Oh, I went to McDonald's.

1023
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,579
I went to McDonald's.

1024
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:52,280
This is important.

1025
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,280
I went to McDonald's and I was so confident like, oh yeah,

1026
00:49:56,679 --> 00:50:00,980
McDonald's and I turned to the I turned to the the speaker

1027
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,780
and I'm like, hey, how are you?

1028
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,579
How are you doing today?

1029
00:50:03,579 --> 00:50:04,380
Having a good day?

1030
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,980
I'll take one Grimace meal, please.

1031
00:50:08,489 --> 00:50:10,559
I was like, dude, that's over.

1032
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,059
It's not happening anymore.

1033
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:16,159
And I was like, and I said, oh fuck, I missed Grimace's birthday

1034
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:17,159
and I think he heard me.

1035
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,800
I didn't drink the fucking shake.

1036
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:24,949
I don't even know what it tastes like.

1037
00:50:24,949 --> 00:50:26,750
I've tried to get it, but I was too late.

1038
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,289
I said, oh fuck, I miss Grimace's birthday.

1039
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:31,500
All right.

1040
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,599
We're killing the Whopper.

1041
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:35,699
I stun the Whopper.

1042
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:38,329
So what do you want me to do?

1043
00:50:41,619 --> 00:50:42,519
I'm going to kill this character.

1044
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:48,000
I mean, I did a lot.

1045
00:50:49,909 --> 00:50:50,510
I'm done.

1046
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:53,769
I just took out three flying hogs and end turn.

1047
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,550
I had a funny idea too.

1048
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,250
You know, over and like drinks the Grimace shake and like, oh

1049
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,650
my god, I'm I like died because I drank the shake or whatever

1050
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:02,949
that like the trend is.

1051
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,539
Yeah, I was going to take a sip out of the Grimace shake on

1052
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:08,039
camera.

1053
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:09,210
No way.

1054
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:09,610
Yeah.

1055
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,210
And then that's crazy.

1056
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:12,010
Stop it.

1057
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:14,510
And then after I took a sip out of it, it was going to cut to

1058
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:17,519
me like lifting weights really well.

1059
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:20,860
It was going to cut to me like relaxing on a couch.

1060
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,659
It was going to cut to like I was going to do a lot of great

1061
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:24,659
things were going to happen to me.

1062
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,710
I was going to be like, wow, everything's like wonderful today.

1063
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:28,510
I feel like great.

1064
00:51:28,909 --> 00:51:30,210
Everything feels amazing.

1065
00:51:31,809 --> 00:51:33,210
But I was like, oh, that's meh.

1066
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:34,610
I thought it was all right for a second.

1067
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:38,530
I mean, I would like that if also amongst those things.

1068
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,929
It was like you making out with someone in a Grimace costume.

1069
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,070
Lifted weights.

1070
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,170
Everything's going so well.

1071
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,050
Yeah.

1072
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:53,250
Oh, that's like, I don't know what's wrong with everyone

1073
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:53,449
else.

1074
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:54,449
Like Grimace gets me.

1075
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,980
Grimace gets me.

1076
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:03,960
Oh, that's funny.

1077
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,119
I was going to get like eight full hours of sleep.

1078
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:15,210
But like during that trend, how expensive a Grimace costume

1079
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:15,710
must be.

1080
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:18,210
Yeah, you want to talk about buying the webcams during

1081
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:20,309
when like the all five by 40 webcams.

1082
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,809
How expensive was a fucking Grimace costume?

1083
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:24,610
They got wiped out.

1084
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,610
They were off of every shelf.

1085
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,409
Well, no, I haven't seen a Grimace costume in any of those.

1086
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:31,710
Maybe it wasn't effective, but you have to you know, and

1087
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:32,710
it's got to get delivered.

1088
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,110
Then Grimace's birthday is over.

1089
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,110
How long can you guys birthday last?

1090
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,210
It was I think the whole month of June.

1091
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:42,230
Was it all of June or was it like just two weeks into how

1092
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,429
long?

1093
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:44,730
Oh, yeah, my birthday is June.

1094
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:49,030
Hey, my whole birthday is an entire month.

1095
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:50,829
You better give me presents every day.

1096
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:52,730
It was a painful birth.

1097
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:07,519
He's a big guy.

1098
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,420
Oh my God.

1099
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:10,920
Are you done with your turn?

1100
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,219
Dude, you can't you can't drop a fucking nuke like that

1101
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:15,619
and they don't expect me to take a minute.

1102
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,110
All right.

1103
00:53:17,409 --> 00:53:18,110
What do we need?

1104
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,059
How about how about just a block?

1105
00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:26,760
Sounds good.

1106
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,199
That sounds good to me.

1107
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,929
Hey, you want some card draw?

1108
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:33,889
I'm done with my turn.

1109
00:53:34,289 --> 00:53:36,190
I needed that card a while ago.

1110
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:36,690
Did you?

1111
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:38,289
Well, you need to communicate.

1112
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,179
I think we're gonna lose.

1113
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,329
Wait, don't do anything yet.

1114
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,599
Did you get a good card?

1115
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,099
Mildly.

1116
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:00,230
Oh, wait.

1117
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,829
Okay, deal five additional damage if the monster has block.

1118
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:05,139
Does the whopper have block?

1119
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:07,780
Not yet.

1120
00:54:10,659 --> 00:54:11,159
What did you just do?

1121
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:11,559
I got him.

1122
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:13,360
I got him.

1123
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,360
Shit, that was pretty cool.

1124
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:14,659
All right.

1125
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:15,559
Well, I'll kill this guy now.

1126
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:16,159
No, I won't.

1127
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,159
You just took all my mana.

1128
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:19,380
Did I?

1129
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,780
How I took your mana?

1130
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:22,840
I don't know.

1131
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,739
Just go pull up my stream and rewind the VOD to see what you did.

1132
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:41,519
We definitely have had this conversation before but

1133
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:45,250
I can just kill that guy up there.

1134
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,539
I'm gonna wait till the whopper has.

1135
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,440
Okay, so I can kill a wounded monster with 10 or less HP.

1136
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,099
Should we just get wait until the whopper is 10?

1137
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:01,250
Dude, I think we're totally fine.

1138
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:02,750
I don't think it really matters.

1139
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:24,030
Thought they haven't said anything in literally 30 seconds time to leave.

1140
00:55:24,929 --> 00:55:26,900
That's what I do.

1141
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,099
I'm just gonna keep kicking them.

1142
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,210
Yeah, just keep pushing them back.

1143
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:37,619
All right.

1144
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,099
I mean, I should have waited till I did that.

1145
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:43,659
I didn't take any damage.

1146
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,550
I got 12 armor.

1147
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,460
Every time I play an arrow, I get four block.

1148
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,699
Is this game fun?

1149
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,900
Yeah, actually it's pretty fun.

1150
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:56,820
I like it.

1151
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,420
Do you like it?

1152
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,179
I like it so far.

1153
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:08,960
We got the whopper.

1154
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,760
Destroyed.

1155
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,880
I was gonna sing like the Burger King song thing, but no.

1156
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:16,690
No, I'm not doing that.

1157
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:22,739
It's like that would be like dumb.

1158
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:25,539
That would be very silly.

1159
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:26,340
Yeah, it would be.

1160
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,079
Keep killing.

1161
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:36,199
That's like wow keyboard turned.

1162
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,960
I just like want this because I just think of that.

1163
00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:58,659
Okay, gain one stamina for every eighth damage you deal and two stamina.

1164
00:56:58,659 --> 00:57:01,260
If the monsters attack leaves you with block.

1165
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:08,960
Okay, so if I have too much block, I'll take I'll take the taunt.

1166
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,059
That sounds fine.

1167
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,880
You have nine money.

1168
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,679
Yeah, what do you want me to do with it?

1169
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,219
I just have a lot.

1170
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:22,449
You're I also have like 18 more health than you.

1171
00:57:22,449 --> 00:57:23,250
What are you doing?

1172
00:57:28,539 --> 00:57:31,139
All heroes get two block at the start of each turn the next battle.

1173
00:57:31,139 --> 00:57:31,639
That sounds great.

1174
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:33,539
We're going with this is a boss coming up real.

1175
00:57:34,269 --> 00:57:35,570
Wait, wasn't that just the boss?

1176
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:36,269
I don't think so.

1177
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,119
I'm gonna do that one.

1178
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:50,659
And then I'm gonna remove that like the heel.

1179
00:57:52,829 --> 00:57:54,630
I think this is the boss, right?

1180
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:58,230
Because one floor six the whopper was the boss.

1181
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:00,030
Well, how come we have another boss then?

1182
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,030
Okay, maybe we have another one.

1183
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:02,429
Hold on.

1184
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,230
Wait, that was a special whopper.

1185
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,659
What did that say?

1186
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,300
I think well my screen that said was a special whopper that things got

1187
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,599
pickles mustard relish onions on it.

1188
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:13,800
That's a special whopper.

1189
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,989
Floor five was the whopper.

1190
00:58:18,389 --> 00:58:23,039
If we have that we're going against another whopper on floor eight.

1191
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,739
We just did the whopper.

1192
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,039
Now you got to pick floor six.

1193
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:29,639
Yeah, I have one choice for floor six and it is the whopper.

1194
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:32,679
We either we have different things.

1195
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,980
So there's another look at look at my look at see.

1196
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,780
Okay, then we got another whopper coming in.

1197
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,480
I didn't have a choice of another whopper.

1198
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,679
I thought we had the same choices.

1199
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:49,519
Grimishake was the one of the worst milkshakes I've ever had.

1200
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:50,860
I wanted to try it.

1201
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,460
I was just late.

1202
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,659
I thought you were going to go in there and do McDonald's and ask

1203
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,159
for a whopper is where that was going.

1204
00:59:02,449 --> 00:59:04,050
That's no that is like that.

1205
00:59:04,349 --> 00:59:06,550
That's oh, that is a spectral whopper.

1206
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:09,130
Yeah, that's bigger than the boss whopper.

1207
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,199
Where is the whopper?

1208
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:13,190
Oh, right.

1209
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,360
Summon.

1210
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,280
What is this puffy corpse?

1211
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:25,800
I honestly thought whopper was the punch line.

1212
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:27,699
Um, I don't think there was a punch line.

1213
00:59:27,699 --> 00:59:30,199
We just was saying whopper because he said it and we was like,

1214
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,500
oh whopper and then we started talking about like McDonald's

1215
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,199
Grimishakes.

1216
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:37,980
I still can't get over the fucking comment you made earlier.

1217
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:42,590
It's like fucking up my whole day, by the way.

1218
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,889
Okay, I I'm sorry.

1219
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:48,389
I thought it would make your day better.

1220
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:51,090
I mean it was it was a wild comment.

1221
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:56,170
Should I taunt something?

1222
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:02,920
I'm getting I'm taking nine damage at the moment.

1223
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,219
You are taking a lot of damage from what I don't know where

1224
01:00:05,219 --> 01:00:05,820
it's coming.

1225
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,420
Oh the two ranged guys.

1226
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:10,019
Oh all the way like I have to scroll up.

1227
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:12,320
Wait, what there's a big guy up.

1228
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,119
Oh, you can actually move the camera.

1229
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:18,860
Yeah, WASD works.

1230
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:19,659
I'm gonna stun him.

1231
01:00:24,769 --> 01:00:25,369
That's my turn.

1232
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:27,070
I guess I'm taking six.

1233
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:35,739
Did you have the Grimishake?

1234
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,480
No, I did not.

1235
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:43,789
Did you want Grimishake at any point in your life in June?

1236
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:45,719
No, I didn't.

1237
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:49,849
I didn't I legitimately didn't even consider it as an option.

1238
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,690
I didn't I saw all the TikToks.

1239
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,090
It never triggered in my brain.

1240
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:58,690
Wait, that's a real thing that people can acquire.

1241
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:03,030
Dude, they're blasting me.

1242
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:08,530
I tried to give you some protection, but it didn't really

1243
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:08,929
work.

1244
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,579
Why didn't you use a deep breath?

1245
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,760
I think that's not for me.

1246
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,159
I think I mean, I think that's not for that's only for me.

1247
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:24,679
We're gonna be fine.

1248
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:26,860
I'm gonna be fine.

1249
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:28,400
Yeah.

1250
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,900
What about the Hamburglar's birthday?

1251
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,599
Yeah, does this mean we're gonna get a birthday for every

1252
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:32,400
McDonald's character?

1253
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,570
I mean now now they're gonna do it like that the Hamburglar's

1254
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:41,539
birthday and the meal and the the fries and the is this like

1255
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:43,039
a bunch of characters that all had birthdays.

1256
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:46,719
It's my wife's birthday today.

1257
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,099
Happy birthday birthday.

1258
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:49,500
Thank you.

1259
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,619
I've been waiting for you to say that you're about to die.

1260
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,460
You know, they all want me.

1261
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:57,559
Can you help?

1262
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:03,739
I can do that.

1263
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:06,000
I can do that.

1264
01:02:06,769 --> 01:02:10,179
Can you kill one of the like guys trying to shoot me?

1265
01:02:10,179 --> 01:02:12,579
No, I have card draw and two damage.

1266
01:02:12,579 --> 01:02:13,179
That's all I have.

1267
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,300
Your cards suck.

1268
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:42,230
Hamburglar is bad.

1269
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:47,610
He doesn't get a birthday there.

1270
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:51,650
Okay, out of like the the tier list of McDonald's characters

1271
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:53,449
the Hamburglar probably is pretty low.

1272
01:02:55,300 --> 01:03:01,780
I would say can you name the tier list of burgers?

1273
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:03,500
What do you mean wrong?

1274
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,800
I could you I think I could do some of them.

1275
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,099
There's the Hamburglar, there's Grimace and then there's Ronald

1276
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:14,440
McDonald and then there's a girl one.

1277
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:16,179
There's also the fry.

1278
01:03:16,179 --> 01:03:19,079
There's like the there's like the nugget crew, right?

1279
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,780
Isn't it like a whole chicken nugget crew?

1280
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:23,079
This is not my area of expertise.

1281
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:31,739
I don't the Hamburglar's schtick was like, Hamburglar was

1282
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:34,139
gonna go on screen and go like what does he say?

1283
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,340
He says that he has like says two words in a row and it's

1284
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,369
like, what is it?

1285
01:03:38,369 --> 01:03:39,369
It's like, what is it?

1286
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:41,960
What is it?

1287
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,260
Yeah, rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble, right?

1288
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:48,159
And then they would like speed up the footage by like 30%

1289
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:51,760
and they would run around in a circle and anytime the

1290
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,360
Hamburglar was in a commercial you could expect a 30 to 40%

1291
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:03,269
fast-forward moment and it was like they do this every time.

1292
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:04,869
I'm gonna kill.

1293
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:08,630
So McDonald's commercials were upsetting to you as a child.

1294
01:04:08,829 --> 01:04:12,880
No, I just you think you could have done them better.

1295
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:13,280
Yeah.

1296
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:29,510
Yes, going in my notebook cataloging early German thoughts

1297
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:30,510
and belief systems.

1298
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,340
Well, when I was younger, I didn't think that but now

1299
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,340
thinking back I could be like, you know what?

1300
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,239
I could probably do a pretty good McDonald's commercial

1301
01:04:39,969 --> 01:04:41,670
bring back like a weird cartoon shit.

1302
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:48,750
No, why not?

1303
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:53,340
Everyone trying to kill me help I can taunt.

1304
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,739
All right, who should I taunt who's doing the most damage?

1305
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:00,179
I'm gonna taunt this one then now that it's okay.

1306
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,380
Now it looks good.

1307
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:05,000
We'll give us some block and then that's good.

1308
01:05:06,889 --> 01:05:07,289
There you go.

1309
01:05:16,739 --> 01:05:19,699
How all right I can get rid of this one on the left don't

1310
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:22,639
attack wait 10 or less, right?

1311
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,039
Can you do one damage to the big guy?

1312
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:28,989
Yes.

1313
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:29,690
No.

1314
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:32,159
Yes.

1315
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,219
What that what did you do?

1316
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:46,340
I don't know do it says deal double the amount of damage

1317
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,239
is my gems.

1318
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:49,139
I have eight gems and it did for damage.

1319
01:05:58,809 --> 01:06:01,610
Bermis has an undertale song in his playlist.

1320
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:04,710
Oh, he never takes more damage than a single hit.

1321
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,409
He never takes more than four damage a single hit.

1322
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:08,110
He never takes more for damage.

1323
01:06:12,739 --> 01:06:15,139
First of all, is that an official grimace playlist that

1324
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:16,539
you're talking about on Spotify?

1325
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,199
Because what what do you mean?

1326
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:25,139
There's a this is there an official birthday playlist.

1327
01:06:30,579 --> 01:06:31,480
You can't listen to that.

1328
01:06:31,579 --> 01:06:32,780
It's insane.

1329
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:41,880
It's really what a lot.

1330
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:46,909
Wait, how much block do I got enough the perfect amount

1331
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:49,519
you kill that now.

1332
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:56,809
I am out of actions.

1333
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:57,610
Don't play it.

1334
01:06:57,909 --> 01:07:00,710
I I'm not playing the grimace playlist right now.

1335
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,360
Maybe we'll listen to it tomorrow.

1336
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:04,619
Coward.

1337
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:09,860
They're trying to kill me.

1338
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,480
You could deal three damage to him.

1339
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:18,039
Come on.

1340
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:18,639
I'll go.

1341
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:21,300
I actually don't think I can come on.

1342
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:26,659
Yes, I can now.

1343
01:07:26,659 --> 01:07:27,960
You only going to take 10 damage.

1344
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,159
How much health you have you've 30 health.

1345
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:29,559
You're fine.

1346
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:32,980
Yeah, but it's it like goes away forever.

1347
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:50,150
I'm never going to get this youth back who's got block.

1348
01:07:55,460 --> 01:08:03,380
You got this student him wait.

1349
01:08:04,809 --> 01:08:07,780
This will be how much would this be?

1350
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:12,730
This will be for one health left.

1351
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:14,429
I was counting.

1352
01:08:14,429 --> 01:08:15,730
What were we talking about?

1353
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,079
Grimace shake.

1354
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:22,180
You see he drank to do grimace shake and he got the purple on him

1355
01:08:25,109 --> 01:08:26,210
regems for that.

1356
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:34,079
That's a good one.

1357
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:34,680
I like this one.

1358
01:08:46,939 --> 01:08:48,140
I don't want to remove any cards.

1359
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,659
So, okay, Slay the Spire did this too.

1360
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,739
We're removing cards always felt like I don't want to take anything away.

1361
01:08:56,739 --> 01:08:57,939
Don't don't want to add more.

1362
01:08:57,939 --> 01:08:59,039
I don't want to take cards.

1363
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:02,710
You can press back at the bottom left and skip rewards.

1364
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:06,840
I'm not I'm not taking anything either.

1365
01:09:12,039 --> 01:09:12,539
Brown.

1366
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:16,960
That's actually really good.

1367
01:09:32,409 --> 01:09:33,310
Oh, I'll take that too.

1368
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,680
There's a lot of reading going on right now.

1369
01:09:38,289 --> 01:09:39,989
You think we're going to get to the final floor?

1370
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:45,319
Maybe index are better than decks bloated with garbage.

1371
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:46,920
That that makes sense.

1372
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:03,289
What's your nighttime routine?

1373
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:08,460
I just go into my bedroom and I go straight on my back like that

1374
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:10,659
close my eyes and I don't move until I fall asleep.

1375
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:18,289
That about sums up for me too.

1376
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:21,420
I take my horse tranquilizer.

1377
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,239
I'm out.

1378
01:10:33,399 --> 01:10:35,399
Yeah, I really am just iPad.

1379
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,380
I hate it.

1380
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:40,779
But so I'll just kind of lie in bed.

1381
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:41,479
Do you do this too?

1382
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:44,510
I just kind of lie like when I'm ready to go to bed.

1383
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:45,510
It's like, all right.

1384
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:46,510
I have my iPad.

1385
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:51,659
I've got like games and like videos and okay, like TV shows.

1386
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:56,399
I'll look at the clock and I'll be like Jesus what the hell is going on?

1387
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:58,000
Like two hours have gone by.

1388
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,699
I was supposed to go to bed like three hours ago.

1389
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:04,029
Two hours ago and then I just go put it down and get away from it.

1390
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:05,840
I do not do that.

1391
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,340
I take my horse tranquilizer and then I go to bed.

1392
01:11:11,569 --> 01:11:13,569
Part of me is starting to understand that this is not a joke.

1393
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:19,199
I am not a phone reader on the toilet like you are.

1394
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,199
I'm not a device addicted.

1395
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,800
You know, I can I can just let it go.

1396
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,199
I feel like I could hear your like lips moving to say idiot.

1397
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,199
I could hear it.

1398
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,199
I'm not a device addicted.

1399
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,800
I could hear like the idiot no judgment in my tone.

1400
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:41,800
If you're going to have to sit on the toilet and read your phone and go to bed and read your phone.

1401
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,800
There is no judgment.

1402
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,600
But if you want to do that, that's fine.

1403
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,500
I guess I'm going to get I'm going to die this round by the way.

1404
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,699
You're killing me moment.

1405
01:11:49,899 --> 01:11:51,899
Yeah, you should like start playing cards.

1406
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:53,699
I feel like I've been doing a lot for you.

1407
01:11:54,529 --> 01:11:55,329
Now it's time to you.

1408
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:58,229
You gained a four block for your turn.

1409
01:11:58,229 --> 01:12:01,430
Look how many I don't have what other cards that I have to play.

1410
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:04,329
What have you been selecting every time we go to a ball?

1411
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Let me take the hamburger is commercials were not good.

1412
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,199
Okay, they sped it up.

1413
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:14,899
They did chase the hamburger burglar around.

1414
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:16,810
Here we go.

1415
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:17,109
All right.

1416
01:12:17,109 --> 01:12:17,210
Now.

1417
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:17,609
I'm good.

1418
01:12:17,609 --> 01:12:17,909
I'm good.

1419
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:18,210
I got you.

1420
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:18,510
I got you.

1421
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:18,909
I got you.

1422
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:22,340
What's priority?

1423
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:28,689
But you're not communicating to any of your cards do stuff like that.

1424
01:12:28,689 --> 01:12:29,989
I put this you okay.

1425
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:34,390
Here's my every turn you just go like and then I'm just like, okay, what do we do?

1426
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,890
We're supposed to be communicating as a team.

1427
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:40,010
Are we?

1428
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:42,390
We're standing next to each other.

1429
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:52,579
What my turns over here the cards I had defend me.

1430
01:12:53,079 --> 01:12:53,880
What do you think I'm doing?

1431
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,289
I guess I'm going to swing it this person.

1432
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,899
What are you reading on your phone?

1433
01:13:01,899 --> 01:13:02,199
What's up?

1434
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:03,199
What's on the iPad?

1435
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:03,600
Are you doing you?

1436
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,960
That's when your mobile game time is I actually don't use a device really at

1437
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,359
all unless I'm on the toilet or in bed.

1438
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:11,260
I don't use it ever.

1439
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:17,979
You can't follow up that statement by I don't use it ever.

1440
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:20,479
We have to kill this whopper up here by the way, because they just look at

1441
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:23,779
how much shit this I know there's a lot of stuff on your side of the

1442
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:24,479
battlefield.

1443
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:29,079
Yeah, but I have gained two block and like deal for damage.

1444
01:13:29,779 --> 01:13:30,079
Okay.

1445
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:32,279
Maybe you should be picking some cards that do things.

1446
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:34,539
Hey.

1447
01:13:34,739 --> 01:13:35,340
Oh, yeah.

1448
01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:38,340
What about this?

1449
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:47,789
Oh, what's this minus 24?

1450
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:48,989
That's about to kill you.

1451
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:02,380
I think we just is this is a game where you lose and you put like points

1452
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:03,479
into permanent upgrades, right?

1453
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,600
I don't think I don't think we could have beaten this.

1454
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:12,119
I mean, I don't want this to be one of those games where you have to lose

1455
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:12,720
to win.

1456
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,470
I would like to just kill them.

1457
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:16,869
I think we just die.

1458
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,850
I think that's I mean me the first time ever playing it.

1459
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:24,039
Who's killing you?

1460
01:14:24,039 --> 01:14:25,939
Who's the who's doing the most damage to you right now?

1461
01:14:25,939 --> 01:14:29,439
I hate the problem of throw just throw a stone dude that everybody

1462
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:30,140
is hurting me here.

1463
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,840
I actually I actually die still.

1464
01:14:35,149 --> 01:14:35,949
No, you don't you're good.

1465
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:38,350
I have actually have to you're right.

1466
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:41,149
It would be flashing emergency colors.

1467
01:14:41,149 --> 01:14:46,090
If you were going to die and you guys watch the FNAF trailer after you

1468
01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:47,289
I've already done that.

1469
01:14:47,289 --> 01:14:48,289
I'm not watching another one.

1470
01:14:48,789 --> 01:14:51,390
They're going to come up with like five trailers of the next six months.

1471
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:52,560
I'm not watching them all.

1472
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:55,659
Isn't it kind of crazy though that they're making a five nights movies

1473
01:14:55,659 --> 01:15:06,479
just because I played it or your trailers.

1474
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:08,979
I'm not a big fan of trailers, especially when they make like eight

1475
01:15:08,979 --> 01:15:13,159
of them and it effectively they just they they take a scene they

1476
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:17,779
take a scene from every single scene in the entire movie and over

1477
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:19,279
the course of like five trailers.

1478
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:21,579
You won't you've almost seen the entire movie.

1479
01:15:21,579 --> 01:15:22,680
I watched the trailer.

1480
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:25,819
I was like, okay, so that's how it ends, right?

1481
01:15:25,819 --> 01:15:27,220
Like that's the whole plot.

1482
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:30,520
That's everything if you took like the three or four five different

1483
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,920
trailers, some of these big franchises do you can take out all the

1484
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,920
scenes and be like, well, there's a scene from literally every

1485
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,920
single scene in the movie.

1486
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,600
You already did this rant, but we're doing it again.

1487
01:15:40,819 --> 01:15:43,119
Some people haven't heard it and some people haven't awoken.

1488
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:44,220
You're dying.

1489
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:45,119
I know I am.

1490
01:15:46,619 --> 01:15:48,520
Wait, can you kill one enemy this game?

1491
01:15:48,520 --> 01:16:03,010
I can I can I can kill this guy and then I can kill this one,

1492
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:06,510
which is this one's doing five.

1493
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:09,819
Good luck because I lose.

1494
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:16,329
No, you don't.

1495
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:17,430
Are you going to save me?

1496
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:19,130
There's got to be a way to save you.

1497
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:22,430
There's simply got to be a way to kill every enemy this time.

1498
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:25,329
There's no way I had the summoner on my side.

1499
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:31,989
You got six health.

1500
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:34,789
I'm about to take 22.

1501
01:16:35,229 --> 01:16:36,529
So technically 10.

1502
01:16:38,789 --> 01:16:39,189
All right.

1503
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:40,590
I think I think this is over.

1504
01:16:43,789 --> 01:16:45,890
They all came with they all walked over to my side.

1505
01:16:51,739 --> 01:16:52,739
Death is not the end.

1506
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,140
You've fallen in battle.

1507
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,939
You can no longer play cards or take other active actions during this

1508
01:16:56,939 --> 01:16:57,239
fight.

1509
01:16:57,239 --> 01:17:00,140
If your team survives, you'll get rewards as usual.

1510
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:06,710
I wait I can stay if you can do this somehow.

1511
01:17:06,909 --> 01:17:08,109
Then we continue.

1512
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:12,510
I don't there's that awful at this game.

1513
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:14,270
Well, hold on.

1514
01:17:14,739 --> 01:17:17,939
This is a game that I would never normally really play and it's also the

1515
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:19,539
first time we've ever played it.

1516
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,199
Why don't do we not just get any slack at all?

1517
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,899
We don't get any slack at all.

1518
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,060
No, you're dead weight.

1519
01:17:30,449 --> 01:17:31,949
You just took that personally.

1520
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,619
Are you some they're all summoning?

1521
01:17:39,829 --> 01:17:40,729
This is what I'm telling you.

1522
01:17:40,729 --> 01:17:43,529
I was I was telling you there was a summoner on my side and you were

1523
01:17:43,529 --> 01:17:46,130
busy talking about grimace was trying to kill him.

1524
01:17:54,029 --> 01:17:56,430
Okay, but like to any of your cards do stuff like this.

1525
01:17:57,229 --> 01:17:59,260
No, why not?

1526
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:02,029
I don't know because I what happened.

1527
01:18:02,029 --> 01:18:03,130
Maybe I should pick some of them.

1528
01:18:03,329 --> 01:18:04,630
Yeah, I don't have any of that.

1529
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:09,250
I have gained block and hurt with block.

1530
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:11,760
I am one.

1531
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,239
I'm I'm I'm dead by two damage.

1532
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:23,960
No, no, you're a streamer.

1533
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,659
You should know how to play every game ever.

1534
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:31,439
All right.

1535
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:35,680
So now what happens we unlocked stuff.

1536
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:42,260
Okay, there we go.

1537
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:43,760
We got a rare voice line.

1538
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,750
Oh, you got you got the new spray new artifact.

1539
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,100
This is Harley Quinn.

1540
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,199
You finished your run your heroes died, but the world mysteriously

1541
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:04,399
reset to the time before they embarked on their quest.

1542
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,100
Maybe the next heroes you create will avenge them and break this

1543
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:10,899
cycle with each finished run you unlock new cards and artifacts

1544
01:19:10,899 --> 01:19:12,199
for the next heroes to use.

1545
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:15,270
So we get better stuff.

1546
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:19,859
We got one new artifact unlocked basically.

1547
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:24,569
Okay, you want to go again?

1548
01:19:25,239 --> 01:19:26,539
Yeah, do you want to go again?

1549
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:28,260
Yeah.

1550
01:19:28,359 --> 01:19:28,659
Okay.

1551
01:19:28,659 --> 01:19:29,359
Yeah, let's do it.

1552
01:19:30,289 --> 01:19:31,390
You want to throw me an invite?

1553
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:34,810
I'll do it again.

1554
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:38,239
I mean, it's not we're not going to be it's not going to be

1555
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,359
probably not going to be better than the last time.

1556
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:49,479
Wait, what wants me to make a new character new character?

1557
01:19:51,779 --> 01:19:53,680
Can I get a coffee and be back in like two minutes?

1558
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:57,020
I want I need another coffee.

1559
01:19:58,909 --> 01:19:59,310
Sure.

1560
01:20:00,189 --> 01:20:00,489
Sure.

1561
01:20:00,489 --> 01:20:01,289
You go.

1562
01:20:01,289 --> 01:20:02,890
I'll take care of everything.

1563
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,310
Well, you just have to invite me to your game.

1564
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:06,510
I'll do the stream.

1565
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:10,270
I'll do everything in the mission.

1566
01:20:12,449 --> 01:20:15,250
Oh, no, it's our artifacts are things you start with that

1567
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:16,850
makes more sense.

1568
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:19,649
You'll see and I had to make a new character and that new

1569
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:20,750
character got the artifact.

1570
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:21,250
All right.

1571
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,449
I'm going to be and grab another coffee.

1572
01:20:26,449 --> 01:20:27,050
I'll be right back.

1573
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:32,670
Okay, don't mute stir.

1574
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:34,170
You haven't been on this channel for a long time.

1575
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:34,869
I'm not muted.

1576
01:20:36,439 --> 01:20:38,649
Well, you're about to be thank God.

1577
01:20:38,649 --> 01:20:42,890
Yeah, don't mute nice minute.

1578
01:20:46,359 --> 01:20:47,060
I have right back.

1579
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:41,560
I am back.

1580
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:44,789
I am back and you are

1581
01:25:45,189 --> 01:25:48,189
but I've never met her you are unmuted and let me just

1582
01:25:48,189 --> 01:25:49,090
tell you something right now.

1583
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,760
You made me laugh so bad.

1584
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,140
I was in the middle of I was mid piss and I thought about

1585
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,140
the fucking grimace comment again, and I think you actually

1586
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,449
hurt me like it hurt.

1587
01:26:00,649 --> 01:26:01,850
I was I just sit in the pain.

1588
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:03,250
It's just like I just thought of it.

1589
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:05,250
It's thought of the fucking comment and just like I

1590
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:05,949
I'll it hurt.

1591
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,920
That's this stream was a success.

1592
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,619
Then I want it like I want you to be in pain from at least

1593
01:26:10,619 --> 01:26:11,720
one joke per stream.

1594
01:26:13,619 --> 01:26:16,520
I feel like I don't have to do another like it's already

1595
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:22,220
enough.

1596
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:22,819
All right.

1597
01:26:24,069 --> 01:26:24,670
We good.

1598
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:28,039
I invited you you got to join.

1599
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:29,340
Oh, there's an invite.

1600
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:36,750
You know, I knew I knew you were going to do that.

1601
01:26:36,949 --> 01:26:39,149
You what make a mage.

1602
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:42,279
I feel like you're the one coming in saying I don't

1603
01:26:42,279 --> 01:26:43,380
understand these games.

1604
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:45,279
How come you can't give me a break and you're like, okay,

1605
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:46,880
I learned all the warrior cards.

1606
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,720
Let me make a mage now, which is probably going to be

1607
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,720
more complicated.

1608
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:53,220
Proud of you for choosing the like I'm dumb warrior.

1609
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:56,439
I hit this was randomly generated.

1610
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:57,869
All right.

1611
01:26:58,170 --> 01:26:59,270
Should I not be a mage?

1612
01:26:59,569 --> 01:27:00,869
You could be anything you want to be.

1613
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:01,069
All right.

1614
01:27:01,069 --> 01:27:01,470
Let me see.

1615
01:27:01,569 --> 01:27:02,770
There's a lot of characters here.

1616
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:03,369
Okay, hold on.

1617
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:07,560
What's your favorite spell of all the spells lightning?

1618
01:27:07,659 --> 01:27:08,260
Absolutely.

1619
01:27:08,659 --> 01:27:10,859
What lightning you want for him ball lightning lightning

1620
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:13,359
bolt lightning storm chain lightning.

1621
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:17,449
Why there?

1622
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:20,649
Why because I like lightning moves in games.

1623
01:27:20,649 --> 01:27:21,350
I think are fun.

1624
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:25,520
Lightning is erratic lightning is it's like, whoa, it

1625
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,119
could do this damage or could do that damage.

1626
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:28,720
It's always kind of all over the place.

1627
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:30,859
I think it's the most fun to play with.

1628
01:27:33,859 --> 01:27:35,529
So what are you going to do?

1629
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:37,699
Hold on.

1630
01:27:37,699 --> 01:27:39,899
I'm going to do what I know right because like I'm not

1631
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:45,380
I don't want to I got an artifact for the warrior

1632
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:47,479
character a follow-up question.

1633
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:49,829
We haven't talked about it in a while.

1634
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:50,229
Okay.

1635
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:50,630
What is it?

1636
01:27:52,449 --> 01:27:54,649
How quickly did you give up on Path of Exile?

1637
01:27:55,739 --> 01:28:01,390
No, I didn't know I didn't know I didn't know I played

1638
01:28:01,390 --> 01:28:03,989
a lot of peewee because I was kind of preparing for

1639
01:28:03,989 --> 01:28:07,539
peewee to you board you stop.

1640
01:28:07,539 --> 01:28:08,340
Where did I stop?

1641
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I don't act to maybe act three.

1642
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,720
I think it's great.

1643
01:28:18,819 --> 01:28:22,710
I okay once I figured out what was going on like,

1644
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:24,510
okay, I get it now and I think this is fun.

1645
01:28:24,609 --> 01:28:27,779
I think waiting for peewee to is smart.

1646
01:28:27,779 --> 01:28:34,159
I think that's what you said to it's a play is apparently

1647
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:40,609
it's going to be longer than people thought but trying

1648
01:28:40,609 --> 01:28:42,810
to get the area that I was named some areas in like

1649
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:45,689
Act two or three because I know that you were doing

1650
01:28:45,689 --> 01:28:47,689
the bandits and you were confused about the bandits

1651
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:47,989
last.

1652
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:48,289
Yes.

1653
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:48,689
Okay.

1654
01:28:48,689 --> 01:28:49,189
Was it right?

1655
01:28:49,189 --> 01:28:49,789
It was after that.

1656
01:28:49,789 --> 01:28:51,989
It's probably like maybe four or five hours of game

1657
01:28:51,989 --> 01:28:52,789
time after that.

1658
01:29:01,930 --> 01:29:02,930
So you're not doing a mage.

1659
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:04,130
Oh my God, this coward.

1660
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:07,029
I think about a mage and he crumbles and he folds.

1661
01:29:07,329 --> 01:29:09,029
Well, I got an artifact.

1662
01:29:09,539 --> 01:29:12,039
Okay, let's play and this is going to make me better.

1663
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:13,670
Yeah, we're going to win.

1664
01:29:15,449 --> 01:29:17,250
We're going to lose in the first like three or four

1665
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:17,550
rooms.

1666
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:19,750
Then we're going to play that game that you liked.

1667
01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:21,989
Well, you also linked a game.

1668
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:23,090
We're going to have to like flip a coin.

1669
01:29:24,170 --> 01:29:27,770
I think is I think we would have more fun in your in

1670
01:29:27,770 --> 01:29:28,470
your suggestion.

1671
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,840
Okay, but I think I would like to do your suggestion.

1672
01:29:32,039 --> 01:29:34,340
We could one day we absolutely could.

1673
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:36,520
All right.

1674
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,420
Now we get it.

1675
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,720
So let's go.

1676
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,420
Oh, I get it.

1677
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:50,420
Yeah.

1678
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:52,119
What do you think of that zombies?

1679
01:29:53,829 --> 01:29:55,630
I genuinely do like you.

1680
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:58,729
We I warmed up to it.

1681
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:04,619
Okay.

1682
01:30:04,619 --> 01:30:06,619
I mean, it's just that we talked it like we were last

1683
01:30:06,619 --> 01:30:08,619
talking about this kind of stuff like two weeks ago

1684
01:30:08,619 --> 01:30:09,619
and that's where you were.

1685
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,119
So I guess you just stopped.

1686
01:30:11,619 --> 01:30:13,020
Oh, I've been busy.

1687
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:15,619
I've been pretty busy at the honest answers.

1688
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:16,319
I've been pretty busy.

1689
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:18,189
I accept.

1690
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:24,079
All right, three damage go which one is attacking this

1691
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:24,779
one here.

1692
01:30:26,449 --> 01:30:27,449
You're get all dude.

1693
01:30:27,449 --> 01:30:28,149
He's getting it.

1694
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,920
Yeah, this guy fucking gets it.

1695
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:41,720
The man's a cool guy yet.

1696
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:42,220
Yeah, I get it.

1697
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:43,020
This man's getting it.

1698
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:43,520
I'm getting it.

1699
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:43,920
You're getting it.

1700
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:44,619
We're all getting it.

1701
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:46,619
I let him hit me by accident.

1702
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:51,369
Wish I could give you my two block and we don't have

1703
01:30:51,369 --> 01:30:53,470
to pause every time I play a card and be like so

1704
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:53,970
grimace.

1705
01:30:55,399 --> 01:30:59,479
I mean unless you've got another grimace take I see

1706
01:30:59,479 --> 01:31:01,180
you unless there's more to the grimace.

1707
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:04,180
I mean, I'm feeling kind of empty inside like what's

1708
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:06,380
the next tick-tock trend like we're like grimace is

1709
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:06,779
over.

1710
01:31:07,079 --> 01:31:07,779
It's over.

1711
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:08,779
What now?

1712
01:31:09,079 --> 01:31:09,579
I don't know.

1713
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,079
I need my dopamine.

1714
01:31:11,689 --> 01:31:12,289
I don't know.

1715
01:31:13,149 --> 01:31:17,560
No, you have one damage the monster monsters attack

1716
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,560
leaves you with walk.

1717
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:21,479
I think it's this one here.

1718
01:31:22,079 --> 01:31:23,180
Just I just need damage.

1719
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:24,380
I didn't have any last time.

1720
01:31:32,439 --> 01:31:33,640
What does strain do?

1721
01:31:35,149 --> 01:31:36,750
If you hover over it, it'll explain it.

1722
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:40,140
I don't know hover over the card with it.

1723
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,899
Okay, select one of three rare and legendary artifacts.

1724
01:31:43,899 --> 01:31:51,689
I want that I'm liking where this is going for me.

1725
01:31:52,649 --> 01:31:55,750
Whoa, keep unspent mana points between turns.

1726
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:57,550
That seems kind of unbelievably good.

1727
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:59,250
I hope I don't you got ice cream.

1728
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:01,649
I hope I don't piss off everybody watching because I'm

1729
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:02,149
not going to use it.

1730
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:12,029
Well, I didn't mean to click that.

1731
01:32:12,029 --> 01:32:12,430
That's okay.

1732
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:14,739
You can re-select.

1733
01:32:16,439 --> 01:32:18,340
Yeah, we need like upgrades and shit.

1734
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:21,640
Yeah ice cream.

1735
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:24,020
What's your favorite ice cream?

1736
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:27,220
What's your like favorite like top three vanilla?

1737
01:32:27,619 --> 01:32:30,520
I never used to be a vanilla or what I feel like I

1738
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:34,520
just awoke and became correct that my whole life.

1739
01:32:34,619 --> 01:32:35,920
People were like chocolate chocolate chocolate and

1740
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:36,720
I was like, yeah chocolate.

1741
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,020
So I like chocolate and then I kind of just woke up

1742
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:44,640
one day and I was like, you know, okay.

1743
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,840
Who I'm going to kill this person right now.

1744
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:48,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, do not shoot

1745
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,010
anyone in the in the in the near.

1746
01:32:51,409 --> 01:32:51,810
Okay.

1747
01:32:53,489 --> 01:32:55,090
How come I don't have something like that?

1748
01:32:57,899 --> 01:33:01,020
I don't know why don't you be rid of this guy.

1749
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:03,220
I just deleted my whole hand, but it's okay.

1750
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:06,850
All right.

1751
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:07,449
Okay.

1752
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:11,470
So chocolate vanilla strawberry.

1753
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:12,470
Let's go with like the basics.

1754
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:13,869
Your vanilla is what you would say.

1755
01:33:15,949 --> 01:33:17,449
We're talking about just the three basics.

1756
01:33:17,649 --> 01:33:21,550
I feel like we talked about this before I whenever we

1757
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:22,649
can recycle content is fine.

1758
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:26,250
Okay, my my go-to grocery store treat when I'm feeling

1759
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:28,850
a little bit sussy is when I go to the ice cream

1760
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:31,149
section at the Hebs in Texas.

1761
01:33:31,149 --> 01:33:33,819
They've got all these crazy flavors like all these

1762
01:33:33,819 --> 01:33:36,020
weird combos and they're always really really really

1763
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:36,520
really good.

1764
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,819
And so I like just try a new one.

1765
01:33:37,819 --> 01:33:44,789
I'm a new I'm going to try a new one that was pretty

1766
01:33:44,789 --> 01:33:46,890
cool as the staple and then beyond vanilla.

1767
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:49,489
It's like I'm going to get a little bit crazy today

1768
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:51,189
and you kill that other guy on the left.

1769
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:53,609
Here we go.

1770
01:33:53,609 --> 01:33:54,109
Look at that.

1771
01:33:57,899 --> 01:34:01,239
Okay, so but okay, but strawberry chocolate vanilla

1772
01:34:01,239 --> 01:34:04,510
you are now a vanilla ice cream enjoyer.

1773
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,619
I would say of the three base flavors.

1774
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:13,529
I think it's strawberry for me with a very important

1775
01:34:14,069 --> 01:34:15,069
very important caveat.

1776
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,000
It has to be smooth strawberry.

1777
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,140
It cannot have strawberry chunks in it.

1778
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,569
No, it has to be smooth strawberry ice cream.

1779
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:27,770
No strawberry chunks.

1780
01:34:29,079 --> 01:34:31,880
There was one of those crazy sussy ice creams.

1781
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:32,779
I was talking about.

1782
01:34:33,079 --> 01:34:37,000
That was a strawberry ice cream with chunks of like

1783
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,340
cheesecake in it.

1784
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:38,840
Okay, though.

1785
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,340
That's all right.

1786
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:39,840
That's good.

1787
01:34:39,939 --> 01:34:40,340
That's fine.

1788
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:44,760
That that was kind of you know what I'm saying?

1789
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,060
Yeah.

1790
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:48,600
Oh, yeah hot for a minute, but just regular strawberry

1791
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,000
ice cream.

1792
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,199
I don't want strawberry chunks in it my all-time favorite

1793
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:53,800
ice cream.

1794
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,800
If we're just talking get away from like the base

1795
01:34:55,800 --> 01:35:01,220
flavorings chocolate chip cookie dough is it just

1796
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:04,220
a date nothing compares and nothing ever will compare

1797
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:04,619
to that.

1798
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:06,720
I just don't think I can I have to wonder if I've told

1799
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:08,720
you my chocolate chip cookie dough story.

1800
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:09,619
I don't know.

1801
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:10,720
Did you puke or something?

1802
01:35:10,819 --> 01:35:13,720
Did you eat it and puke no is Easter one year they

1803
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,619
got the they had these like Easter chocolate chip

1804
01:35:15,619 --> 01:35:18,020
cookie like eggs you like unravel the egg and you

1805
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:20,979
it's like just all like that kind of like Oreo

1806
01:35:20,979 --> 01:35:22,380
chocolate chip cookie dough thing.

1807
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:26,489
Okay, and then I ate some of them and I got really

1808
01:35:26,489 --> 01:35:29,390
sick like really really really sick and then like a

1809
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:32,090
week later the next like in the morning my brother

1810
01:35:32,289 --> 01:35:34,489
knowing that I got sick from these Easter eggs and

1811
01:35:34,489 --> 01:35:35,689
it was a big deal to me.

1812
01:35:36,090 --> 01:35:38,590
He took all of the Oreos out of an entire like

1813
01:35:38,590 --> 01:35:42,590
double sleeve of Oreo put all of the double stuff

1814
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:45,090
Oreo into a baseball and just took a big bite out

1815
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:45,390
of it.

1816
01:35:45,390 --> 01:35:46,289
Oh you did tell this.

1817
01:35:46,289 --> 01:35:47,590
Yeah, that's kind of gross.

1818
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:48,619
Yeah.

1819
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:49,119
Okay.

1820
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:49,720
My bad.

1821
01:35:49,819 --> 01:35:51,119
I was a double storyteller.

1822
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:56,560
You can banish me now clean your weapon transform

1823
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:01,930
and upgrade sacrificial lung into what doesn't

1824
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:02,130
set.

1825
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:03,130
What is it transforming into?

1826
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:09,100
It gives you like three options or two or three

1827
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:09,600
options.

1828
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:15,649
Whoo.

1829
01:36:20,729 --> 01:36:21,829
I'm going to let's go.

1830
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:29,550
New cards.

1831
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:31,909
Yeah, new artifacts.

1832
01:36:31,909 --> 01:36:33,109
That's what oh that's next.

1833
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,000
Okay, but what is your we're talking not just base

1834
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:39,600
flavors.

1835
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,300
What is your favorite ice cream that could have any

1836
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:46,680
amount of kind of combinations in it, but now

1837
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:51,699
we'll yeah, but we're talking a different tier of

1838
01:36:51,699 --> 01:36:55,100
ice cream now like what other ice creams do you

1839
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:57,000
like that aren't just a base flavor.

1840
01:37:01,539 --> 01:37:03,840
I think that it was the way I said the strawberry

1841
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,140
with the cheesecake in it.

1842
01:37:05,239 --> 01:37:07,970
That was some high quality ice cream.

1843
01:37:08,170 --> 01:37:09,270
I'm going to drop this over here.

1844
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1845
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:14,659
You just did something.

1846
01:37:14,659 --> 01:37:15,960
You just did something.

1847
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:18,260
Yeah, I just killed everybody on your side.

1848
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:19,060
We're winning this.

1849
01:37:19,159 --> 01:37:22,960
This is the run and then check this out.

1850
01:37:23,850 --> 01:37:26,680
Nah, I'll let you I'll let you be able to hit

1851
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:27,180
something.

1852
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:42,869
I'm doing it.

1853
01:37:46,859 --> 01:37:47,460
God damn it.

1854
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:49,159
I spilled coffee fucking everywhere.

1855
01:37:50,779 --> 01:37:52,079
You're taking a lot of damage.

1856
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:54,680
It's just everyone is everywhere and I don't

1857
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:55,880
know what I don't know do about it.

1858
01:37:58,539 --> 01:37:59,739
Oh, I have to get it.

1859
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,640
It's oh, it's I actually don't even know what to

1860
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:02,340
do right now.

1861
01:38:02,439 --> 01:38:05,609
I wish I was there to help you pat you down.

1862
01:38:05,609 --> 01:38:06,109
It's all right.

1863
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:21,500
I deserve it for making that.

1864
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,000
I feel like this has happened the last like three

1865
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,399
times.

1866
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:27,800
It happens all the time all the time every time

1867
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:30,869
because especially especially when I take a sip

1868
01:38:30,869 --> 01:38:31,369
of coffee.

1869
01:38:31,369 --> 01:38:36,189
I'm like who it's like I need to like relax.

1870
01:38:36,789 --> 01:38:38,390
I feel like two years from now.

1871
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:40,989
You're going to be Hector from Breaking Bad with

1872
01:38:40,989 --> 01:38:45,020
a ding ding just rolling around waiting for help.

1873
01:38:45,319 --> 01:38:49,420
What it's you're progressing quickly.

1874
01:38:50,449 --> 01:38:53,539
Just wait till you get to be 37.

1875
01:38:54,699 --> 01:38:55,399
It's rough.

1876
01:38:55,399 --> 01:38:57,140
All right, man.

1877
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:04,970
This hill is steep hold you right now for real almost

1878
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:07,069
I'm almost dirty tweet.

1879
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:12,720
I'm dirty doing a half as long as didn't get on

1880
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,119
the ground.

1881
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:14,319
I don't get on the ground.

1882
01:39:15,529 --> 01:39:18,329
There's a pool of coffee underneath my zero key

1883
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:20,050
and that's over.

1884
01:39:20,050 --> 01:39:22,850
Say desk like from all of the times you've done this

1885
01:39:22,850 --> 01:39:24,350
and it's just going down.

1886
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:27,060
They got I don't know what to do about this.

1887
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,460
I don't let's keep gaming.

1888
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:29,159
I think I'm all right.

1889
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:31,359
If there's a pool of coffee underneath the zero on

1890
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:34,920
my numpad and that's going to be a problem and this

1891
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,520
is annoying because I like this keyboard.

1892
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,619
My keyboard doesn't even have a numpad who uses

1893
01:39:38,619 --> 01:39:39,220
a numpad.

1894
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:40,720
I don't want time you use your numpad.

1895
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,319
I haven't I'm just saying that's where it is.

1896
01:39:44,199 --> 01:39:44,399
All right.

1897
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:45,300
Well, it's no problem.

1898
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:46,899
I hate looking at it though.

1899
01:39:47,699 --> 01:39:48,600
And then I'm low.

1900
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:52,199
Now I have to go get a paper towel and turn it into

1901
01:39:52,199 --> 01:39:55,699
a little stick and then slide it under and let it

1902
01:39:55,699 --> 01:39:57,000
absorb and then pull it out.

1903
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,800
And oh my God, what a fucking disaster.

1904
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:01,699
Okay, what are we doing now?

1905
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:05,909
Didn't get on the floor.

1906
01:40:05,909 --> 01:40:09,310
So it's our tip the keyboard.

1907
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:10,510
No, it's going to get everywhere.

1908
01:40:13,609 --> 01:40:15,810
I'll take the keys out and clean it up later.

1909
01:40:18,409 --> 01:40:20,409
Yeah, I can't take all the keycaps off and clean my

1910
01:40:20,409 --> 01:40:21,210
keyboard right now.

1911
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:23,609
We're in the middle of a game and I'm streaming with

1912
01:40:23,609 --> 01:40:28,159
my friend stir my hands are up and this is the one

1913
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:32,569
time the one time I put like creamer in my coffee.

1914
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:39,869
How is that relevant?

1915
01:40:44,859 --> 01:40:49,229
I am deeply like normally be like I Jeremy so bad

1916
01:40:49,229 --> 01:40:50,130
Jeremy bad.

1917
01:40:50,869 --> 01:40:54,789

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1924
01:41:05,489 --> 01:41:08,689
in my I know like so like if I had all these extra

1925
01:41:08,689 --> 01:41:11,090
elements getting in the way who knows where I'd be

1926
01:41:12,649 --> 01:41:15,850
but here's the thing Holly just slipped a paper towel

1927
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:16,550

01:41:18,899 --> 01:41:20,100
Hold on give me one second.

This is perfect.

1935
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:44,579
That's actually perfect.

1936
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,500
I can get it under there and it's like soaking it

1937
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:48,000
all up.

1938
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:56,069
Look see nice.

1939
01:41:56,069 --> 01:41:57,170
That's actually a good idea.

1940
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,159
Oh, let me this is a little extra here.

1941
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:12,779
This is got 12.

1942
01:42:15,649 --> 01:42:15,949
All right.

1943
01:42:15,949 --> 01:42:16,850
I'll be ready in a second.

1944
01:42:16,850 --> 01:42:17,350

Appreciate all your patience.

1948
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,779
Just like my eyes like big day is really excited to play

1949
01:42:26,779 --> 01:42:28,350
Hell card my friend.

1950
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:32,779
Yeah, this big day kind of a big day.

1951
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:34,289
It's kind of a big day.

1952
01:42:36,329 --> 01:42:38,729
This was this is what my wife wanted for her birthday.

1953
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:42,180
You're just kind of taking a mess.

1954
01:42:43,899 --> 01:42:45,100
I think I'm all right now.

1955
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:51,359
I thought I just ended the stream by pressing like this

1956
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:51,859
button.

1957
01:42:54,329 --> 01:42:55,829
That's as good as it's going to get for now.

1958
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,609
You know this see this was a good choice turn-based

1959
01:43:05,609 --> 01:43:06,010
game.

1960
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:09,920
Oh, I knocked one of the keys off.

1961
01:43:10,979 --> 01:43:11,380
Hey,

1962
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:30,800
anybody missing a two isn't going to stink when coffee

1963
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:31,199
dries.

1964
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:33,000
It smells like fucking dog shit.

1965
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:39,920
All right.

1966
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:40,920
That's as good as it's going to get.

1967
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:47,520
I just want to make sure it didn't actually get anywhere

1968
01:43:47,819 --> 01:43:49,520
where it's going to be actually like a real problem.

1969
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:50,819
And I don't think that's the case.

1970
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:55,909
I don't know.

1971
01:43:55,909 --> 01:43:57,409
You're always making fun of me when I tell you I take

1972
01:43:57,409 --> 01:43:58,310
caffeine pills.

1973
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,220
Stop doing never never spilled them stop all over my

1974
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:02,520
desk.

1975
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:03,319
Stop doing that.

1976
01:44:04,119 --> 01:44:04,619
Stop it.

1977
01:44:04,619 --> 01:44:05,319
Stop doing that.

1978
01:44:11,770 --> 01:44:12,170
All right.

1979
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:13,170
There we go.

1980
01:44:14,289 --> 01:44:16,890
Oh, but there's going to be a stain on my desk.

1981
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:22,630
All right.

1982
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:24,029
The rest can be done later.

1983
01:44:25,729 --> 01:44:26,729
Calm down Hector.

1984
01:44:28,039 --> 01:44:28,340
All right.

1985
01:44:28,439 --> 01:44:28,840
I'm good.

1986
01:44:36,189 --> 01:44:37,489
I took a lot of damage.

1987
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:45,300
Yeah, you are you kill the close guy the near guy.

1988
01:44:45,399 --> 01:44:47,100
I can kill the near guy.

1989
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:52,359
And I'm also going to kill the far away one over here

1990
01:44:52,359 --> 01:44:52,859
too high.

1991
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:53,960
I got them.

1992
01:44:54,649 --> 01:44:55,449
We do got them.

1993
01:44:56,340 --> 01:45:00,869
My hands are very sticky and the reason why I say

1994
01:45:00,869 --> 01:45:03,670
this is because I usually just drink my coffee black

1995
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:06,439
but I decided I'll put some hazelnut in it and then

1996
01:45:06,439 --> 01:45:07,640
I'll spill it all over myself.

1997
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:08,140
That's smart.

1998
01:45:19,039 --> 01:45:20,140
I actually really like this card.

1999
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:20,739
I'm going to get it again.

2000
01:45:23,649 --> 01:45:29,880
I've got omega aoe in the the near circle like one

2001
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:32,279
when they're getting near I just kill everything.

2002
01:45:33,899 --> 01:45:35,399
I think we're going to be aware.

2003
01:45:38,659 --> 01:45:46,680
I think this is the one I'm going to heal me gets two

2004
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:47,479
gemstones.

2005
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:49,979
Yeah, I have that too.

2006
01:45:50,819 --> 01:45:54,899
That seems very good because it cost one.

2007
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:55,100
Yeah.

2008
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:56,199
So then I just did it for you.

2009
01:45:56,199 --> 01:45:57,100
Now you do it for me.

2010
01:45:58,090 --> 01:45:58,390
There we go.

2011
01:45:58,390 --> 01:46:00,189
We just both gained one gemstone for free.

2012
01:46:04,359 --> 01:46:05,460
You're going to heal use.

2013
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:06,560
We got the heal.

2014
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,060
I did feel like you need a heal.

2015
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:08,659
I did heal.

2016
01:46:11,029 --> 01:46:12,930
That's oh, that's your health after healing.

2017
01:46:13,229 --> 01:46:15,430
It is you're at 26.

2018
01:46:15,430 --> 01:46:16,329
You're only forehead.

2019
01:46:16,729 --> 01:46:22,960
Oh, hey Trevor.

2020
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:26,760
Can you play the original ET on Atari next year for my birthday?

2021
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:27,359
I don't know.

2022
01:46:35,630 --> 01:46:36,630
Come on, do it.

2023
01:46:37,229 --> 01:46:37,829
You do it.

2024
01:46:38,229 --> 01:46:39,329
What else you got going on?

2025
01:46:40,659 --> 01:46:41,359
Are you going to do it?

2026
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:46,060
No, I don't know that guy.

2027
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:47,479
All right.

2028
01:46:47,479 --> 01:46:50,960
Let's actually pay attention because we got a walk that

2029
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,460
we got that's a skill of Zerker.

2030
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:59,020
I'll get that this needs to die 50 health 50 health on this

2031
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:01,520
one 50 health on this one.

2032
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:02,020
Okay.

2033
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:03,020
What do you want to do about this?

2034
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:11,659
I could I could kill I could kill this thing deals one damage.

2035
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:17,680
Yeah, but I think is he a summoner he is giving strength

2036
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:23,729
to all allies to every anything comes in the circle.

2037
01:47:23,729 --> 01:47:24,430
I can kill him.

2038
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:28,060
Well, let's kill.

2039
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:30,659
I'm going to kill the flying hog in the circle.

2040
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:40,109
Then I'm going to give you want to give block to you and

2041
01:47:40,109 --> 01:47:41,710
then I'll take some block.

2042
01:47:43,090 --> 01:47:45,890
Does this carry over to each turn the block it does right?

2043
01:47:46,939 --> 01:47:50,880
No, it doesn't you've been playing this game the second

2044
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:50,979
time.

2045
01:47:50,979 --> 01:47:55,880
We've done a run kind of a important thing to notice.

2046
01:47:56,279 --> 01:47:59,750
Don't you think at the start of the round your armor is

2047
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:03,130
going to immediately come off a fuck you grimace.

2048
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,840
All right, we can lay the fire.

2049
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:11,140
We should be able to get rid of these.

2050
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:19,750
Wait, can we I can get rid of like the half of the people

2051
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:20,350
on my side.

2052
01:48:24,359 --> 01:48:24,760
Okay.

2053
01:48:25,649 --> 01:48:27,350
I can also get rid of those two as well.

2054
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:30,319
It's going to hurt but I can get rid of them.

2055
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:32,720
It's not going to hurt.

2056
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:33,619
Yes, it is.

2057
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:35,590
I know it's not.

2058
01:48:35,989 --> 01:48:36,189
Okay.

2059
01:48:36,189 --> 01:48:36,890
Now, what are you going to do?

2060
01:48:37,819 --> 01:48:49,539
I am going to I'm going to kill this guy and I'm going

2061
01:48:49,539 --> 01:48:50,640
to kill this guy.

2062
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,640
I'm I still taking nine damage this guy.

2063
01:48:53,039 --> 01:48:53,640
Oh, there you go.

2064
01:48:55,409 --> 01:48:58,310
And then I can't do anything else with my other cards

2065
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:59,109
are blocked.

2066
01:49:03,329 --> 01:49:09,189
Also remember you got that ice cream to keep your energy

2067
01:49:09,189 --> 01:49:09,890
between turns.

2068
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:10,590
That's true.

2069
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:12,789
You know, so like don't play too many cards there.

2070
01:49:12,789 --> 01:49:17,380
Bucco, I can get rid of these two in front of us.

2071
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:19,579
You want to focus on the big guy.

2072
01:49:28,439 --> 01:49:31,710
I'm going to hold as I want to save my man.

2073
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:40,470
Oh, I just got a diamond pickaxe.

2074
01:49:41,069 --> 01:49:43,430
Well, well, okay.

2075
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:47,100
What is this?

2076
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:48,899
Is he buffing himself next turn or something?

2077
01:49:50,479 --> 01:49:54,789
He's yeah, he's buffing.

2078
01:49:55,590 --> 01:49:56,689
It's growing in power.

2079
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:58,989
I mean, I just smoked him.

2080
01:49:59,390 --> 01:50:00,289
You what are you doing?

2081
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:04,159
I'm going to smoke this guy.

2082
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:23,710
Smoked new card.

2083
01:50:24,109 --> 01:50:25,909
Your swords deal plus two damage.

2084
01:50:28,029 --> 01:50:28,729
I like that one.

2085
01:50:30,199 --> 01:50:32,800
This one's good, too, but I need to be able to get block

2086
01:50:32,899 --> 01:50:35,079
first, but it's definitely this one.

2087
01:50:38,989 --> 01:50:42,090
I'm feeling quite good about this one here.

2088
01:50:42,390 --> 01:50:43,489
I'm getting an artifact.

2089
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:48,039
That's pretty good.

2090
01:50:49,479 --> 01:50:50,380
That's also really good.

2091
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:51,180
I need healing.

2092
01:50:52,359 --> 01:50:53,159
I'm taking the blood.

2093
01:50:54,930 --> 01:50:56,029
Oh, yeah, get that blood.

2094
01:50:56,430 --> 01:50:59,020
I need healing very badly.

2095
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:10,869
No, no.

2096
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:22,210
What is that?

2097
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:24,109
What what are you groaning about?

2098
01:51:24,109 --> 01:51:25,010
I'm just looking at cards.

2099
01:51:25,609 --> 01:51:26,510
We just moaning.

2100
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:28,729
I'm just looking at cards.

2101
01:51:44,699 --> 01:51:45,600
Oh, that's a good one.

2102
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,529
Okay.

2103
01:51:47,630 --> 01:51:49,229
Oh, I want the upgrade.

2104
01:51:53,359 --> 01:51:54,460
This is a stir game.

2105
01:51:58,039 --> 01:52:00,340
Yeah, I could see that I could see this being a stir game.

2106
01:52:01,739 --> 01:52:12,119
I did recommend it is my choice a lot of enemies.

2107
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:16,159
Okay, but they're all like stinky pigs.

2108
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:16,859
Okay.

2109
01:52:17,699 --> 01:52:20,430
And we got one big guy.

2110
01:52:23,369 --> 01:52:26,770
I can get rid of two of these or three of these actually.

2111
01:52:27,170 --> 01:52:27,569
Okay.

2112
01:52:28,170 --> 01:52:28,270
Okay.

2113
01:52:28,270 --> 01:52:29,369
I'm not going to do that anymore.

2114
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:32,220
Hey, better not.

2115
01:52:37,409 --> 01:52:38,609
I can do this.

2116
01:52:39,909 --> 01:52:43,350
You're the big guy and not do anything else.

2117
01:52:51,579 --> 01:52:52,380
Talon arrow.

2118
01:53:05,859 --> 01:53:08,960
I'm feeling a nap creeping up a nap.

2119
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:09,960
Take a nap then.

2120
01:53:11,319 --> 01:53:12,520
Oh, I thought you were going to take a nap.

2121
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:13,720
I thought you were so bored.

2122
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:14,819
You were going to know.

2123
01:53:17,659 --> 01:53:19,659
It's actually big because I could probably kill all these.

2124
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:28,199
If you can I can they all did.

2125
01:53:28,699 --> 01:53:29,600
They all did.

2126
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:30,899
I'm going to kill them all.

2127
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:31,399
Okay.

2128
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:32,100
Okay.

2129
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:35,409
What the fuck your curtain is cool.

2130
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:39,279
Sorry, I apologize.

2131
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:44,319
That's all I got.

2132
01:53:48,199 --> 01:53:52,069
I might as well use it to not take any damage.

2133
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:54,569
No, you shouldn't because you have ice cream.

2134
01:53:55,170 --> 01:53:56,369
Oh, you were taking damage.

2135
01:53:56,369 --> 01:53:57,569
I was going to take that you were taking damage.

2136
01:53:57,569 --> 01:53:57,869
Okay.

2137
01:53:57,869 --> 01:53:58,069
Yeah.

2138
01:53:58,069 --> 01:53:58,470
No, you're great.

2139
01:53:58,470 --> 01:53:58,970
You're great.

2140
01:53:59,170 --> 01:53:59,670
That's great.

2141
01:53:59,670 --> 01:54:00,270
You're gravy.

2142
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:01,170
You're gravy, dude.

2143
01:54:02,359 --> 01:54:03,260
We yeah, we can kill him.

2144
01:54:08,229 --> 01:54:09,329
We're so good at this game.

2145
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:11,229
We're incredible.

2146
01:54:11,329 --> 01:54:14,130
They didn't make this game no one we were going to play it.

2147
01:54:24,189 --> 01:54:24,989
I don't like this one.

2148
01:54:25,090 --> 01:54:28,500
I'll take this one black or green olives.

2149
01:54:30,869 --> 01:54:36,039
Green olives for the oil black olives for the topping is my

2150
01:54:36,039 --> 01:54:36,439
answer.

2151
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:47,180
What was the question on oil olives black or green olives

2152
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:53,590
never either never really?

2153
01:54:54,739 --> 01:54:55,039
Yeah.

2154
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:00,079
Oh, that's good.

2155
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:08,909
In a near range before damage in a medium radius.

2156
01:55:08,909 --> 01:55:10,909
I actually like that one probably more than at all.

2157
01:55:11,109 --> 01:55:12,310
I like the ground breaker.

2158
01:55:12,409 --> 01:55:13,409
It's too man of though.

2159
01:55:13,409 --> 01:55:13,909
That's a lot.

2160
01:55:17,739 --> 01:55:19,039
We got a boss coming up here.

2161
01:55:19,539 --> 01:55:22,880
The skeletal zorker deal five damage.

2162
01:55:23,079 --> 01:55:25,180
If it kills the monster increase the damage of this card

2163
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:25,579
by five.

2164
01:55:25,579 --> 01:55:32,819
Is that permanently or just for the round drive?

2165
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:34,869
I don't know.

2166
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:36,439
It's permanent.

2167
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:51,659
Oh, a new artifact and we off sync that now I have to do

2168
01:55:51,659 --> 01:55:53,560
a boss like you just did the boss.

2169
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:54,960
I think that's what's happening.

2170
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:08,779
But how we need to hold on.

2171
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:18,159
That's a lot of that is a lot of damage a lot and I only

2172
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:20,520
have one lock.

2173
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:25,060
I can even do if you see what you can kill before you block

2174
01:56:26,859 --> 01:56:30,260
because you got four block guys are dealing three damage

2175
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:35,659
and I can only do I can only do five damage total to

2176
01:56:35,659 --> 01:56:37,359
somebody and I can't kill anything.

2177
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:40,659
I guess I could kill and deal damage to things as well.

2178
01:56:40,859 --> 01:56:42,659
I can kill the part of this.

2179
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:43,159
All right.

2180
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:48,140
Hold on.

2181
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:48,840
I kill.

2182
01:56:49,989 --> 01:56:51,090
Why did I not do more damage?

2183
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,000
What the fuck happened?

2184
01:56:56,100 --> 01:57:00,750
I well tried.

2185
01:57:01,630 --> 01:57:01,930
Okay.

2186
01:57:01,930 --> 01:57:04,930
Well now that you killed the ghoul they curse us.

2187
01:57:05,329 --> 01:57:06,029
I know that first.

2188
01:57:06,029 --> 01:57:08,729
You waited what first you you cursed you you know,

2189
01:57:08,729 --> 01:57:09,029
you're good.

2190
01:57:09,029 --> 01:57:09,529
You're good.

2191
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:10,800
You're fine.

2192
01:57:10,899 --> 01:57:12,199
A delusion card.

2193
01:57:12,199 --> 01:57:22,949
You're you're delusional how much you know, we've been

2194
01:57:22,949 --> 01:57:28,960
here before like Doki Doki Literature Club.

2195
01:57:29,689 --> 01:57:31,689
You just got out of a time machine from this chat in

2196
01:57:31,689 --> 01:57:32,590
like 2018.

2197
01:57:37,399 --> 01:57:38,100
What do you want me to look at?

2198
01:57:39,489 --> 01:57:40,489
This is bad.

2199
01:57:40,989 --> 01:57:44,689
I feel like like what there's a lot of shit.

2200
01:57:44,989 --> 01:57:58,899
Are they going trouble weird that me as the Ranger can

2201
01:57:58,899 --> 01:58:01,199
only kill all of the things if they're in close range.

2202
01:58:03,550 --> 01:58:04,449
This hurts a lot.

2203
01:58:09,899 --> 01:58:12,100
Okay, your sword steel plus two damage.

2204
01:58:12,699 --> 01:58:14,000
This would never happen.

2205
01:58:14,930 --> 01:58:15,829
If you were the mage.

2206
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:24,399
Yeah, I mean, okay, but hold on a second.

2207
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:26,659
How the fuck are we supposed to do this?

2208
01:58:27,229 --> 01:58:30,130
You got to kill these big ass zombies with the 9 HP.

2209
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:32,829
Okay, they're not dealing all the damage and they got

2210
01:58:32,829 --> 01:58:33,630
buffed a lot deal.

2211
01:58:34,029 --> 01:58:36,329
I can deal two damage in a medium radius.

2212
01:58:37,390 --> 01:58:38,090
I can do five.

2213
01:58:38,090 --> 01:58:40,590
Okay, I can do five damage to this guy on the right.

2214
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:43,119
I can't kill it though.

2215
01:58:43,119 --> 01:58:44,720
So it's like a waste of me using it.

2216
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:45,819
There's nobody in a cone.

2217
01:58:46,119 --> 01:58:48,720
Wait, no, the only thing that's in a cone is this one.

2218
01:58:52,939 --> 01:58:55,140
How much damage can you do to the guy on the right?

2219
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,100
Talk to me.

2220
01:59:02,739 --> 01:59:06,239
These big zombies the big ghoulies the green guys are

2221
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:07,340
hitting both of us.

2222
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:09,640
That's why we're both taking time about damage these

2223
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:10,140
guys here.

2224
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:11,479
Yeah, okay.

2225
01:59:11,479 --> 01:59:13,779
Yeah, but so how much damage can you do to one of them

2226
01:59:13,779 --> 01:59:14,079
right now?

2227
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:27,720
I can do I need to I can I can kill this one.

2228
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:28,779
Wait.

2229
01:59:28,779 --> 01:59:29,380
No, I can't.

2230
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:33,479
Can you hit that guy one more time?

2231
01:59:34,539 --> 01:59:38,300
I can but because I can kill that one if you could do

2232
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:39,199
one more damage to it.

2233
01:59:46,869 --> 01:59:48,869
Okay, we still both take like 20 damage.

2234
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:54,920
I did some major miscalculating.

2235
01:59:55,659 --> 01:59:59,800
Yeah, I think I'm dead.

2236
02:00:00,619 --> 02:00:01,319
You dead.

2237
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:02,420
Oh, you are dead.

2238
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:02,920
You're dead.

2239
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:04,720
You die right now.

2240
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:08,619
What?

2241
02:00:09,710 --> 02:00:13,550
Yeah, I don't I mean, I think it's that we didn't know

2242
02:00:13,550 --> 02:00:16,270
these things hit both of us as well.

2243
02:00:16,270 --> 02:00:18,369
Like you focused all your damage the first turn on the

2244
02:00:18,369 --> 02:00:21,270
thing that cursed you when these guys are double hitting

2245
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:24,170
us and they're getting the damage this this arena is

2246
02:00:24,270 --> 02:00:26,569
crazy because he's buffing their damage every turn.

2247
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:29,020
Oh shit.

2248
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:30,859
Death is not the end.

2249
02:00:31,159 --> 02:00:31,659
Hold on.

2250
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:56,810
Let's go get apparently they don't have to attack every

2251
02:00:56,810 --> 02:00:57,109
turn.

2252
02:00:57,109 --> 02:00:57,810
They just were.

2253
02:00:58,510 --> 02:01:05,930
Oh, I'm dead.

2254
02:01:11,079 --> 02:01:12,380
I guess I could kill.

2255
02:01:14,850 --> 02:01:17,350
Who's attacking you nine damage.

2256
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:21,119
I could do five.

2257
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:22,819
No, I could do eight.

2258
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:25,050
You're dead.

2259
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:26,119
Hold on.

2260
02:01:26,119 --> 02:01:26,520
I don't know.

2261
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:27,119
I don't think I am.

2262
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:28,619
You're dead there buster.

2263
02:01:28,819 --> 02:01:29,319
Are you sure?

2264
02:01:29,319 --> 02:01:29,920
I don't think I'm dead.

2265
02:01:31,619 --> 02:01:32,720
Kind of dead there buster.

2266
02:01:41,729 --> 02:01:51,279
I'm oh wide one fucking health shit.

2267
02:01:53,130 --> 02:01:53,430
All right.

2268
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:54,029
This gets hard.

2269
02:01:54,329 --> 02:01:56,529
This game is pretty pretty intense.

2270
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:02,500
I think you also got to consider when we're choosing

2271
02:02:03,630 --> 02:02:04,829
the vaults and stuff.

2272
02:02:07,939 --> 02:02:11,739
What other enemies were making but I'm confused at why

2273
02:02:11,739 --> 02:02:13,439
we had to fight two bosses in a row.

2274
02:02:14,949 --> 02:02:16,149
Do you think this game is cute?

2275
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:19,640
I think it's good.

2276
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:26,479
I think it's fun, but I am going to suggest we play

2277
02:02:26,479 --> 02:02:30,039
that other one which other one the one the one you

2278
02:02:30,039 --> 02:02:31,850
liked the one I liked.

2279
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:32,149
Okay.

2280
02:02:32,149 --> 02:02:33,449
I feel like that's gonna be very fun.

2281
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:37,680
We played like two hours.

2282
02:02:37,979 --> 02:02:38,779
I think we can pivot.

2283
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:39,960
Okay.

2284
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:40,760
No, I'm fine with that.

2285
02:02:42,859 --> 02:02:43,560
I like the concept.

2286
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:44,260
I think it's really fun.

2287
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:46,619
Yeah, I'm probably gonna play more of that.

2288
02:02:47,020 --> 02:02:48,920
This is a stir game if you by the way, if you want to

2289
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:53,420
see more of hell card stir will be playing it tomorrow.

2290
02:02:56,319 --> 02:02:58,319
Okay, apparently I'm playing it tomorrow.

2291
02:03:02,079 --> 02:03:03,579
Are you planning on streaming tomorrow or no?

2292
02:03:03,979 --> 02:03:07,880
I have no I feel like the last couple of days in a row.

2293
02:03:08,079 --> 02:03:10,579
I have like scheduled things and I can't remember what

2294
02:03:10,579 --> 02:03:11,680
any of them are at the moment.

2295
02:03:12,479 --> 02:03:14,680
I get that I might not be streaming.

2296
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:15,680
I don't know what I'm doing.

2297
02:03:16,079 --> 02:03:16,779
I get that though.

2298
02:03:17,250 --> 02:03:17,750
Seriously.

2299
02:03:18,739 --> 02:03:18,939
Okay.

2300
02:03:18,939 --> 02:03:28,529
