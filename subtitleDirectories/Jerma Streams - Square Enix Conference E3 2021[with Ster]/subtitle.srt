1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:04,599
What are you, what are you doing?

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:07,480
I was explaining my theories on being a furry.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,839
No, I don't.

4
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:12,679
And I was, I was just saying out loud that you would not want to hear this.

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,480
Just like, okay, if you, listen, if you guys want to, if you guys want to hear

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,329
Ster go off on his, on his takes or whatever, or whatever we have to say about whatever.

7
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,969
Yeah, he's, he's got a stream that you can watch like,

8
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:25,800
when I'm not on it, so I can run the fuck away from him.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,179
Yeah, no, I, I respect your, how, uh, how much of a prude you are,

10
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:35,500
that you are not evolving with the times that you're stuck back in the 80s.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,170
And, you know, the world is becoming more and more woke.

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,179
And you just can't accept that some people have.

13
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:50,340
He's, oh, he's, well, he's muted again. He's, he's been muted again.

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,759
All right, so he's back. So, um.

15
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,640
Yeah, so no, I wasn't reminded. So you were a cat boy.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,179
So I was talking about furries. You were a cat boy.

17
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,709
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:10,519
My chat keeps telling me because I, okay, long story.

19
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:15,159
I'm doing a cosplay trade with another streamer who is a VTuber who is a cat girl.

20
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,540
So I'm going to become a cat girl.

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,700
And my chat, every time this gets brought up is like,

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,859
oh, he's going to do it before German does it.

23
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:25,140
But ever since your, your hot tub stream,

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,340
they've been saying that you beat me to the punch.

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:28,900
I did.

26
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,129
But you were just denying it.

27
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:33,609
When I asked you if you were a cat boy, you said no.

28
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:35,930
I didn't do a hot tub stream.

29
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,989
I see what's happening here.

30
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:42,099
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:44,819
When Bugleberry, did Bugleberry become a cat boy?

32
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:47,269
Of course, of course I remember that, yeah.

33
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:52,090
Okay, I see.

34
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,620
You have like such a profound amount of shame within you

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,180
that I think one day the cap's going to burst and the pride is just going to fall out.

36
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,700
What are you doing?

37
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,819
He's got to put on a fucking mask of an old guy to get in the hot tub.

38
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,020
Like just live a little, man.

39
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,419
Time for some stretches.

40
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,240
Hey, if you want to be able to do some stretches, you got to start now.

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,039
All right.

42
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:27,590
So can we talk about video game conference stuff?

43
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,229
Absolutely.

44
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:31,110
If you would like to talk about what you enjoyed from the first day,

45
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,030
because that's the day that we've both seen.

46
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,509
Okay.

47
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:34,150
Elden Ring.

48
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,030
That would be fine.

49
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,990
Elden Ring.

50
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,979
I want to hear, I really do want to hear, and I really mean this.

51
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:41,509
Stop muting him.

52
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:43,300
I'm not.

53
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,120
Stop muting him.

54
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,770
So I want to hear what you have to say about Elden Ring,

55
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,150
because you, correct me if I'm wrong, you did not like Sekiro.

56
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,949
I think Sekiro was the worst Souls-like.

57
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:59,270
Okay.

58
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,530
I don't.

59
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,250
Not by much.

60
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,409
I think it's still a good game, but I think it was the worst in the series of Souls-likes.

61
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:06,909
Okay.

62
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,020
Which without context, people are mad.

63
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,219
I don't like that they made you have to grind healing potions.

64
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:15,939
Why?

65
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,400
They did that in Bloodborne.

66
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,129
Bloodborne had that.

67
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:25,750
Oh, I'm remembering it being a lot worse than Sekiro.

68
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,699
And honestly, it's been so long since I played it.

69
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,460
I don't want to unpack this.

70
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,139
Look, they're all Dark Souls games, and they're all great games.

71
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:35,340
There's no opinion other than,

72
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,180
I saw Elden Ring.

73
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,639
It looked cool.

74
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,909
I signed me up.

75
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:46,259
Do you think it's going to be like a Dark Souls game,

76
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,939
or do you think it's going to be more like Sekiro?

77
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,490
Do you think they're going to go back to, it's Dark Souls, but not really?

78
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,090
I think it's going to be just another Dark Souls game,

79
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,500
with the twist that you can get on a horse, so a little bit added to it.

80
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,460
But it's like the same thing.

81
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,219
Oh, Arise, Tarnished.

82
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:09,379
Oh, you changed the word that you call it.

83
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,500
They're not Hollows.

84
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,620
They're Tarnished now.

85
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,719
It's just Dark Souls.

86
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, but all right.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,040
People that keep saying that.

88
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,560
They brought on, what's his name?

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,160
What's the guy that the Game of Fire and Thrones?

90
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,759
They brought him on, and he just did, what's the hotkey?

91
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,939
In the program I use, it's Ctrl-H for Find and Replace.

92
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:31,180
And he just did Find, Replace, Hollow, Tarnished.

93
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,459
And he did a whole bunch of words, Replaces.

94
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,459
And then they were like, okay, let's go.

95
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,139
You don't know what the story is yet.

96
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,360
Sure, it could be just, oh, the Tarnished.

97
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
But you don't know what's going on yet.

98
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,720
It could be something cool.

99
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,680
I know that the trailer showed like, oh, you're in a hub world.

100
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,279
And here's like the soft-voiced girl with a hood on.

101
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,230
And she's the one that lets you level up.

102
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,790
Yeah, but okay.

103
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,600
I've been willing to give From Software a shitload of leeway.

104
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,930
And tons of room to just, oh, they've done that before.

105
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,540
The Dark Souls and the Souls-like games that they have made

106
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,699
are so fucking fun.

107
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:18,939
And they're so good that I want like more of that.

108
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,790
I don't want less of that.

109
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,750
I want more of that.

110
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,029
Again, I'm not disagreeing that I expect it to be a very good game

111
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:27,980
and I'm going to play it and enjoy it a lot.

112
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,620
But you're asking for opinions and saying that it's going to be a great game

113
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,060
is really just a very boring conversation if we keep going back and forth on this.

114
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,259
So let me bring you way back to The Binding of Isaac

115
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:41,579
when you used to have the joke that you would say all the time,

116
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,100
it's the same game, Ed.

117
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:49,300
Why don't you say it's the same game, Miyazaki?

118
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,170
Because, well, there's two reasons why.

119
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,290
Because I really wanted...

120
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,149
Well, we'll break this down even further.

121
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:09,110
So The Binding of Isaac was so unlike anything, right?

122
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,829
And I loved playing it so much.

123
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,189
It was like, I have probably...

124
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,670
I probably have...

125
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,389
He's struggling.

126
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:14,949
It's quiet.

127
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm working on it.

128
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,879
I have probably...

129
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,319
I read a comment that was like, did these guys hate each other?

130
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,360
I don't like having him on.

131
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,360
He challenges me and I don't like it.

132
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,800
Okay, so...

133
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,959
I enjoy a divisive conversation.

134
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,160
That's too challenging.

135
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,800
You got to give me like...

136
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,399
Give me like softball question.

137
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:31,639
Okay.

138
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,079
Give me softball question.

139
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:35,639
Do you think that Miyazaki is...

140
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,000
Give me like a what's your favorite fucking like...

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,480
What's your favorite drink like whiskey?

142
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,120
You know, that's very easy.

143
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,600
The guy's name that did Death Stranding?

144
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:49,129
Kojima.

145
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:50,250
Kojima, yeah.

146
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,850
Kojima had an interview on the first day.

147
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,569
Did you see that?

148
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:57,430
That's my highlight of E3 is his interview.

149
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,389
The first part that I...

150
00:06:58,389 --> 00:06:59,910
I'm not going to go on about the first part,

151
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,629
but he actually said if aliens came to Earth the way things have been,

152
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:06,870
you would not be excited by that,

153
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,430
but you will be excited by my next game.

154
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,779
This dude's crazy.

155
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:19,420
So wait, he's saying that his new game is going to be more interesting

156
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,259
than if aliens invaded Earth.

157
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:22,060
Yeah, and I don't...

158
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,259
He said he brought up 9-11 for some reason

159
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,889
and the guy threw him the softball questions like,

160
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:30,329
oh, hey, Kojima, how's it going?

161
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:31,370
Hope you've been having fun.

162
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,050
He's like, we're in a state of emergency.

163
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,459
It's like 9-11-2 over here.

164
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:36,740
It was really weird.

165
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,699
Really? I didn't even see it.

166
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:42,870
And then he said that aliens were less interesting than the games he make.

167
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,310
Anyway, as you were saying,

168
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,060
you were defending your position on the binding of Isaac.

169
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,019
No, okay.

170
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:49,899
So I didn't see that.

171
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:51,420
That's weird.

172
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:51,660
Okay.

173
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,139
I kind of want to rewatch it to make sure I didn't mishear it

174
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,259
and that I'm not misquoting

175
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,060
because these are pretty wild allegations I'm throwing out

176
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,660
for the public statement he made.

177
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,899
Well, anyways, I have probably the same amount of time

178
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:09,800
in Binding of Isaac that I did in...

179
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,660
It's probably pretty close.

180
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,459
It's probably my second or third most played game on Steam.

181
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:15,579
It's close to TF2.

182
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,689
It's like, if not more than 500 hours, it's close.

183
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:23,420
And I have played Binding of Isaac across multiple devices.

184
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,339
We're talking, I've played it probably two or 300 hours on the Switch.

185
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,660
I played it like two or 300 hours on PC.

186
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,860
I played like two or 300 hours on like PlayStation.

187
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,500
I just kept, I kept taking, I kept redoing save files

188
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,820
because I would play it for like 200 hours and I would delete it.

189
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,340
I would just uninstall it from Steam

190
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,940
or uninstall the game from like Switch.

191
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,740
So I would constantly start over

192
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,659
and I have like probably a thousand hours total in the game.

193
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:55,269
So there was a lot of stuff that I wanted in the game.

194
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,710
And when I kept saying, oh, same game, Ed.

195
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,509
That was just like a joke to say

196
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,269
because there was silence in the chat room

197
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:04,470
when we would be in like vent.

198
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:06,629
It didn't even mean anything.

199
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,110
I'm noticing a trend with silence for you.

200
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,870
It didn't even mean anything.

201
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,070
Dude, you're talking about somebody

202
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,909
that literally walked around saying Thanos lines

203
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:17,190
into the shower and shit after.

204
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,350
I just say words.

205
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,470
They don't even mean anything.

206
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,620
Okay, does it feel good to get this out?

207
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm not getting anything out.

208
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:28,980
He vented.

209
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,659
You guys don't, people don't even vent.

210
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,039
Is that, are we old?

211
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,320
That's not that old.

212
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,379
That's not that long ago.

213
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,580
So how does this relate to, it was just a joke back then.

214
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,220
And that's why you don't say it's the same game Miyazaki.

215
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,340
That's what we're getting at.

216
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,360
Well, because I like it.

217
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,120
I like, it's the stuff that I like.

218
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,960
And when you get more of the stuff that you like.

219
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,679
Okay, so I have a great direction to take this.

220
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,159
What was your favorite Souls like?

221
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,379
Bloodborne, without a doubt.

222
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:06,259
Okay, actually that totally, I agree.

223
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:09,460
That kind of takes away the point I was gonna make.

224
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,100
Because you know what?

225
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,700
Bloodborne, actually like one of the best games ever made.

226
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,620
If Bloodborne was 60 FPS,

227
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,940
it would be the best game that's ever been made.

228
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:18,899
Second best.

229
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:22,009
What's better?

230
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:23,049
I don't know.

231
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:25,179
Diablo 2?

232
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:31,299
Um, like a true, okay, if they read kind of,

233
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:34,259
and I don't even want to use the word remaster, because.

234
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,019
I don't think they're worth comparing, actually.

235
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:36,500
I just.

236
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,779
Okay, if they, okay, if they was a,

237
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,629
you know how the PS4 Pro came out?

238
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:42,870
And hold on, like the gas is coming up here

239
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,870
and it's hard to not, okay.

240
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,049
So don't do that shit.

241
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,220
So, because you just freaked me out.

242
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,860
Okay.

243
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,940
So when, you just threw me off.

244
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,740
What was I even saying?

245
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:58,659
Fuck, it's gone.

246
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,620
It just went, you just, a hole came out of my head.

247
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,340
Well, we were talking about an incident in your childhood.

248
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,539
You said it disturbed you greatly.

249
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,419
So listen.

250
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:10,250
So when the PS4 Pro came out, I remember being like,

251
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,809
I'm going to get, I'm gonna get a PS4 Pro.

252
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:17,220
I can't wait because they're definitely going to put

253
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,059
Bloodborne on it and have it be 60 FPS.

254
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:21,610
I was like, that's the reason why the console is coming out.

255
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,059
And they just, they didn't do it.

256
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:24,179
So I was like, what?

257
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,289
And then PS5 has like the PS5 mode for a lot of games.

258
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,090
PS4 games, right?

259
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,259
And I'm like, this is it.

260
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,059
They got to do that.

261
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:33,620
Like, come on.

262
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,460
It's, I don't know if it's so baked into the game's code

263
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,659
or something that they can't do it.

264
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:40,100
Because remember the Dark Souls shit

265
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,299
where if you made it 60 FPS, like they went like 100% faster.

266
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:47,980
Just give me that.

267
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,659
Give me like a 60 FPS Bloodborne.

268
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,909
And I would, oh, I would play it again.

269
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,690
I would.

270
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,610
Bloodborne 2 or something.

271
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,879
I don't know that I would really even, it's just a good game.

272
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,220
The atmosphere, everything about that game.

273
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,899
To like the art style, the atmosphere, the story,

274
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:10,139
the gameplay, the trick weapons.

275
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,389
It's like, I hope.

276
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:15,429
Look, if Elden Ring even has a 10th of that kind of stuff.

277
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,610
I want just trick weapons.

278
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,929
The trick, no, they need to do that again.

279
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:22,840
Trick weapons were the coolest thing of any game

280
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,940
that's a single player game that can come out in a long time.

281
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,139
Having the two weapons you can switch between are amazing.

282
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,860
It was so much fun to be able to transition between the two.

283
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,340
You know what I mean?

284
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,519
Like you go like one, two, big load, L1, slash.

285
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,080
And then you had two.

286
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,440
And then there's like two guys coming at you over here.

287
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,200
You slash with the big two-hander.

288
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,000
I loved that.

289
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,879
It was the best thing that I've ever seen in a single player game.

290
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,740
What are trick weapons?

291
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,259
I'm just in agreement.

292
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:51,019
I don't have a, I don't have a counterpoint.

293
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,860
Bloodborne, when Bloodborne came out, everybody was like,

294
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,179
oh, hold on, there's only like 20 weapons in the game?

295
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:57,899
What the fuck?

296
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,470
That's, but every weapon is like two weapons.

297
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,870
So each weapon has like a different mode, essentially.

298
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,809
There's two modes for each weapon.

299
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:07,850
I think when Bloodborne came out for about a full year,

300
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,210
you would just randomly say like quotes from it too.

301
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,750
Like Amigdala, you just say that randomly all the time.

302
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,940
Yeah.

303
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,299
You're really asking the guy why he's going, oh, same game, Ed.

304
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,610
It doesn't mean anything.

305
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,730
I'm just saying words.

306
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,460
Okay.

307
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,409
So how do I know what you're saying now has any meaning?

308
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:32,809
Because you were quite, there's a lot of conviction in your words.

309
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:34,570
You should know this more than anybody.

310
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:43,929
That when 24 hours go by, the last day, I don't remember half the things I've ever said.

311
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:46,490
People will like bring up stuff like, hey, dude, remember when you said this?

312
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,090
Like, oh, remember on that stream?

313
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:48,889
I'm like, what the fuck?

314
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:50,009
What are you talking about?

315
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:53,080
Why does everybody want me to do Aaron?

316
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,659
Why is everybody saying Aaron?

317
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:59,509
Aaron, why?

318
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:00,870
Well, can you do Aaron?

319
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,350
Aaron?

320
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,139
Yeah.

321
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:04,700
Okay.

322
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,899
Wait, have you seen, have you seen, have you seen Snack on Titan?

323
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:08,220
Yes.

324
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,779
Okay.

325
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:09,259
Are you ready?

326
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:10,620
I've not seen the newest season.

327
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,100
Aaron?

328
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,259
Yeah.

329
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:11,659
Aaron?

330
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:13,179
Okay, no, Aaron?

331
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:15,460
Right?

332
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,460
I, are we talking like a dub here?

333
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,899
No, like, you don't, you didn't watch the dub?

334
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:21,460
No.

335
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,820
Oh, well, then you don't get it.

336
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,700
I'm sorry.

337
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:27,110
You don't get it.

338
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,269
Okay.

339
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,909
Whatever.

340
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,789
I don't, I'm sorry.

341
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:29,830
I don't get it.

342
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,870
Well, I tried.

343
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,710
And now I do remember it was been a long time since the early seasons, but I do remember

344
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,600
that girl really did like to say Aaron while crying.

345
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,240
So I, I can piece the things together.

346
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,620
Dura says Jerma is unfunny.

347
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,580
When did he say that?

348
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,340
Did he?

349
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,379
You say that all the time.

350
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,259
You say that I'm not funny?

351
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,100
Wait, no, you know, you say that I'm not funny.

352
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,580
No, I don't.

353
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,220
I say that you're very funny.

354
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,500
I'm always on the defensive.

355
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,860
You're always trying to mute me.

356
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:07,019
I have said on this broadcast that I think that you're one of the funniest like YouTubers.

357
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,980
I've said that.

358
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,179
I've seriously said that.

359
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:10,580
Tell them.

360
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:10,899
Okay.

361
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:13,379
I'm laughing because of the qualifier.

362
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:24,919
Jerma, Jerma, you're one of the funniest influencers I watch.

363
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,799
I don't like that word.

364
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,149
Well, you know what?

365
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:30,950
Of all of the influencers, you're probably the funniest.

366
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:36,299
Make sure to check out Star.

367
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,019
Wait, who's the other guy?

368
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:44,740
Trow's channel.

369
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,539
He's streaming right now.

370
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,620
Yeah, don't, you know, you don't come over here.

371
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,580
I got to warn you though.

372
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,539
Like if you're like a new viewer and you go over to his channel,

373
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:56,179
he's going to say something you're probably going to be like,

374
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:57,059
this guy sucks.

375
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:00,500
Like he's going to say he's going to have a take on something.

376
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,580
I'm like a gorilla song.

377
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:09,539
You got to listen to it like five times before you see where it's coming from.

378
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:12,019
Currently running Myriad, right?

379
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:13,379
Or not right now?

380
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:18,659
Well, no, I am like developing a replacement for D&D because D&D sucks.

381
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:22,580
While it's simultaneously the best game, it's also not good enough anymore.

382
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,580
So I've been trying to make my own D&D.

383
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,700
It's coming along quite well and I'm hoping to start running games again

384
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,259
in a few months, two or three months.

385
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:35,029
But with that last comment, I think 60 to 70% of everyone that would have come over

386
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:36,389
probably just decided they weren't.

387
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,169
Well, I mean, if you want me to back up the things I say,

388
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:41,450
I can back them up.

389
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,490
We were talking about this again.

390
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,820
You've got four and a half minutes in my head.

391
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,620
Four and a half minutes.

392
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,419
Why D&D sucks?

393
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:48,820
Okay.

394
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,580
You have the floor.

395
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,220
I have the floor.

396
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,100
I'm going to explain one mechanic in Dungeons & Dragons.

397
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:01,179
When you cast a spell on an enemy, when you are attacking an enemy with a spell

398
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,220
and they are defending against and they need to roll a saving throw,

399
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,460
they are actually attacking your spell with their defense.

400
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,700
And that's very significant to note because when you're attacking a spell save,

401
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:26,599
you then a tie win.

402
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,369
And I yield the rest of my time to the speaker.

403
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:38,490
So, you're making what you would call, in your own words, a better version of D&D.

404
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,769
Well, my-

405
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:42,089
Or a more refined version of D&D.

406
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:42,970
Is that what you're saying?

407
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,089
The more precise way to look at it.

408
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:44,970
This is an interview now for you.

409
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,410
This is like a me interview.

410
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,450
Thank you for interviewing me.

411
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,769
I know you're really excited about the Myriad coming soon.

412
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:56,809
The important part is that most people play D&D on the internet, like Roll20 and stuff.

413
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,450
But D&D is not made to be played on a computer

414
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,849
that can calculate things more than a person can.

415
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:07,420
So, I'm trying to make something that utilizes the fact that you're on a computer to begin with

416
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,950
and then make combat more interesting and have a lot more things auto-generate.

417
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:14,710
Have you guys heard of the best game Diablo 2

418
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,500
that automatically rolls loot for you and stuff?

419
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,049
Yeah, it's got all that.

420
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:19,930
Oh, what?

421
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,490
That's cool.

422
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,009
Yeah, like Diablo 2.

423
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:24,650
Now that it's like that thing you've heard of, I get it.

424
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:31,160
We probably should open the stream because here comes the conference.

425
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,200
Square Enix, right?

426
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,660
Oh, shit.

427
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,390
Wow, 40 minutes went by actually pretty quick.

428
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,190
He muted you.

429
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:45,539
Not really, only a small amount, like only just a little bit.

430
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,599
All right, so this is, we gotta get this back up.

431
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:55,579
What's for dinner?

432
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:58,299
Switch, the Switch gaming one's the one, yeah, that's the one.

433
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:08,490
All right, so what else are we working on here?

434
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,690
Brand risk stir?

435
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,809
I did legitimately prepare like 20 questions for an interview for you.

436
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:20,730
So, if we really need to kill time, I can just start asking things.

437
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,890
No, it's starting in like two minutes.

438
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,759
Um, what's a good one here?

439
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:34,680
All right, so they're at, okay, yeah, we're almost there.

440
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,500
I actually looked up some videos of like worst all-time interview questions,

441
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,460
so this is a real one.

442
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,140
They're funnier when you know they're real.

443
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,539
Okay.

444
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,779
All people are prejudiced.

445
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:46,380
All people are prejudiced.

446
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,740
Which prejudice do you have?

447
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,140
Probably against not liking you.

448
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,359
All right, so let's open it up.

449
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,440
Eric Hobbs.

450
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,460
Aaron, ready to do it?

451
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,480
Are you ready?

452
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,079
Yeah, I have it open.

453
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:09,700
All right, so wait, refresh it.

454
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,279
Let's make sure we're on the same thing here.

455
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,950
Like I just refreshed it, like right now.

456
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,750
Uh, refresh.

457
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:20,069
I'm on a bright white screen.

458
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,730
It's the schedule, right?

459
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,210
And it is the schedule, and it should be starting in one minute.

460
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,250
It's starting in one minute.

461
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,450
We got Square Enix.

462
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,880
And by the way, I am going to start muting him

463
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,140
because he's been talking over too many cutscenes.

464
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,180
How come I don't hear anything, though?

465
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:35,579
Okay.

466
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,559
Let's listen to these guys.

467
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,240
This looks like comfy.

468
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,200
This looks like comfortable.

469
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,759
I want to sit in one of those chairs.

470
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:49,619
All right, Square Enix.

471
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:50,660
What are those robots?

472
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,460
What's going on?

473
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,259
What is this?

474
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:52,819
What is that?

475
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:55,849
What was that?

476
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,049
That was, what the hell was that?

477
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:07,109
Those, those were like, those are robots.

478
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:07,910
But what were they doing?

479
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:11,940
The people are controlling them.

480
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,539
Oh, I put, wait, I put a lot of creamer in this coffee.

481
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:24,779
And I didn't stir it because I want to get back up here.

482
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,339
No, and it's, I just got to this part

483
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:30,539
where all the creamer is.

484
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,299
And I'm just drinking essentially warm cream.

485
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:34,730
It's all right.

486
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:37,990
Oh, you're allowed to talk about the warm cream you're drinking.

487
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,750
And I can't say when I was in elementary school,

488
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,670
I could bend to my, to my face on the ground.

489
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,900
Kind of a one-sided relationship here.

490
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:58,420
I feel like you're in the chat right now.

491
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,660
Like when you close your eyes at night,

492
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,140
you don't just like have chat scrolling.

493
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,980
No, this is like, like you close your eyes.

494
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,740
I want, I want the remainder of this conference

495
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,180
to be us describing video game material.

496
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,059
I don't want to hear,

497
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:14,980
I don't want to hear about you bending over.

498
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,420
I don't want to hear about you talking about

499
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,460
creams.

500
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,740
I don't want you talking about.

501
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,380
And I want, I want video game discussions.

502
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,660
Nothing else.

503
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,420
I don't want to hear about you bending over anymore.

504
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,259
No more game.

505
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:27,619
So far game of the year.

506
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:29,140
Germa 2021.

507
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,779
Uh, the only one I played, which is Resident Evil 8

508
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:33,859
is the only game I've played so far that's come out in 2021.

509
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,220
Oh, okay.

510
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,519
That's a lot to choose from.

511
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,000
What have you played this year?

512
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,430
What about the power washer?

513
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,630
Yeah, that was pretty good.

514
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,450
I don't even know.

515
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:56,329
I'm in that Lost Ark technical alpha.

516
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:56,809
Oh shit.

517
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:57,930
Are you really?

518
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,819
Yeah, pretty good.

519
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:04,250
That's like seven years in the making, apparently,

520
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,130
or five, whatever it is.

521
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,289
Well, I mean, it's been made, just not,

522
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:08,250
it wasn't made for us.

523
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:11,220
Guilty gear?

524
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:11,940
I don't like it.

525
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,579
All right, here we go.

526
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:13,140
Quiet.

527
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:23,000
Good afternoon, everyone.

528
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,200
It's Matt Mercer here,

529
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,920
and I'm back as your host of Square Enix Presents.

530
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,839
Today, we have a special E3 edition of the show for you

531
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:33,079
with new game announcements, updates,

532
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,720
and exciting news from our studios across the globe.

533
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,279
So let's kick off with the world premiere

534
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,759
of a brand new game from Eidos, Montreal.

535
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,920
We hope you enjoy the show.

536
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:53,029
I am so proud of you.

537
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,609
Do you know what a birthright is, Peter?

538
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,940
Is this Starfield again?

539
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,519
Or is it just another space game?

540
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,480
This is not supposed to be talking.

541
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,920
All the space games look the same.

542
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,799
Stop talking.

543
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:06,279
It looks the same.

544
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:06,920
It's Marvel.

545
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,720
On your side.

546
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:13,099
News of the galaxy?

547
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:13,819
Rocket.

548
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:17,720
So I let Groot fill out the paper.

549
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,359
Space games are fine if they're Marvel.

550
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:24,539
So we got to be 6,900.

551
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:29,210
Need a plan.

552
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:38,230
Crystal Dynamics didn't make this one, right?

553
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,029
We got this.

554
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:57,930
Put your pants on.

555
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:07,140
Push him off tracks.

556
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,250
Make your main questions here, right?

557
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,690
Maybe we can work something out.

558
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,190
Get him.

559
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,049
You had one job, Quill.

560
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:16,410
I did exactly what?

561
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:21,450
The more no killing teammates.

562
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,089
Says who?

563
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,769
It's literally in your contract.

564
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:25,450
I made no such commitments.

565
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,769
In less than three cycles, all would be lost.

566
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:32,490
The galaxy cannot be saved either, Quill.

567
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,170
We could do this together.

568
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:51,509
Licensed music has been replaced.

569
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,430
Good.

570
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,630
It means we don't have to worry about it.

571
00:25:55,349 --> 00:26:05,299
What's the actual song that's supposed to be there?

572
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:19,259
Hi, my name's Olivier Poul, senior producer here at Eidos Montreal.

573
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:23,019
For the past few years, we've had the privilege to work on our version

574
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:26,140
of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy and reimagine it.

575
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,019
Okay, react.

576
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:28,299
He's just talking about it.

577
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:28,940
React.

578
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,440
Now.

579
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,240
Faster.

580
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:35,579
You don't have much time.

581
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,980
I would give that a...

582
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,480
I don't know.

583
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,940
Game reviewers say blah.

584
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,660
8 out of 10.

585
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,460
It was a game that looks like it's gonna...

586
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,500
Fans are gonna think it's cool.

587
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:53,109
Join us on this journey and you'll hear more about the game from our team behind this project.

588
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:53,990
All right, let's do this.

589
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:59,079
He's trying to find something nice to say.

590
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:02,279
I don't have anything to say because it was just like a trailer that had like...

591
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,400
They had like the song of the Hedgehog music playing.

592
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
And they were just shooting monsters and it was like,

593
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,519
look at these characters you like.

594
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,480
I don't know.

595
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,680
I don't know what it is.

596
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,920
Characters from Marvel's past.

597
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,000
You can't watch a trailer and go, wow, that game sucks.

598
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,440
I think it's a piece of shit.

599
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,160
I don't even know what it is.

600
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,220
You can.

601
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:21,720
You can't.

602
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,920
I don't even know what it is though.

603
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,039
Like I don't know.

604
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,000
It's just like a video game.

605
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,759
You're right about that.

606
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:29,640
It is a video game.

607
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,039
Does it look good?

608
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:33,799
I don't know.

609
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,839
You know, I felt as someone who isn't really a fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy,

610
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:43,400
I felt as though the vibes that it put off were quite authentic to the series

611
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,839
and really captured exactly what the movies were all about.

612
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,359
It's probably going to make you really feel like you are Star-Lord.

613
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,839
Well, all right.

614
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:57,720
I'm not, I haven't really seen, I'm not a big Guardians fan, okay?

615
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:01,720
I don't, I didn't, I thought the movies were cool,

616
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,440
but I didn't really get it.

617
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,680
I'm like, oh, I don't like love Guardians of the Galaxy.

618
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,559
It was like, cool.

619
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,119
It's not that I thought it was, they were bad.

620
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,440
I just, pretty much all the Marvel stuff.

621
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,519
I love Spider-Man, okay?

622
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,019
Okay.

623
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,160
That's my barometer.

624
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,160
Like Homecoming, Far From Home, like those Spider-Man movies are my barometer.

625
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,920
And like, I don't put Guardians higher than Spider-Man Homecoming.

626
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,460
Okay.

627
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,920
So your reaction to the Guardians of the Galaxy game is, I love Spider-Man.

628
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,640
Star-Lord is really empowering.

629
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,720
He's very agile on the battlefield.

630
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,680
He can slide.

631
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,119
I hate to say it, but that's actually my reaction to every game.

632
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:47,880
It's just, oh, Guardians of the Galaxy, yeah, I love Diablo 2.

633
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,079
You're doing the same thing, but you're not getting shit on for it.

634
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,240
Or I don't like it, okay?

635
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,200
I don't think this game looks, it's not for me.

636
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,079
I don't, I don't know.

637
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,039
Maybe it is though.

638
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:02,839
I don't know.

639
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,480
They've shown like a guy going like this, like a belly of an alien.

640
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,000
I don't know what the video game is.

641
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,720
It could be great.

642
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:12,119
I need more time to process it.

643
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:19,160
And no, I'm going to defend myself here, because yes, there's a reason why.

644
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,240
I said that I, yes, it's Guardians of the Galaxy.

645
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,319
I like Spider-Man, because if this was a Spider-Man game, I'd be like, oh, yup.

646
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:31,960
But it's, I put, in Marvel, I put Spider-Man over Guardians.

647
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,519
You understand?

648
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,079
That's what I mean.

649
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:35,579
Okay.

650
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,079
Is that relevant?

651
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,440
Yes, because it's a Marvel game.

652
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,480
It's the same universe.

653
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:45,079
That's like saying that like if Diablo had another game in the same universe,

654
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:48,680
that was the different characters, and you liked those characters more

655
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,920
than like Deckard Kane, which, excuse me.

656
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,839
Why would you say that?

657
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,359
But that's my point.

658
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:58,279
Like if it's different, it's the same universe, but different characters.

659
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,599
I am more interested in a Spider-Man game than a Guardians game.

660
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,240
That's my point.

661
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,740
That's it.

662
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,680
In a Guardians game.

663
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,559
Okay.

664
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,599
And I'm more interested in Diablo 2 than I am a Guardians game.

665
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:16,680
Oh, but then you can't, but all right, that's fine.

666
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,279
But like they're not in the same universe.

667
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:26,789
Honestly, the Marvel universe is so just like, oh my god, I gotta get rid of everything.

668
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,410
So who's to say it's not in the universe?

669
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:36,230
What's going on?

670
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,829
I feel like I'm in the, I'm playing the game.

671
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,289
Yeah, it was weird.

672
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:42,730
Let's play.

673
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,690
I was not prepared for that.

674
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,569
Oh, should it be playing?

675
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:47,289
All right, here we go.

676
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:47,789
All right.

677
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:56,650
We appear to be 6,963 units short.

678
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,490
We intend to keep our ship, Peter Quill.

679
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,130
I know.

680
00:30:59,130 --> 00:30:59,690
I know.

681
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,009
We clearly need a plan.

682
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:03,369
Are these the characters from the movie?

683
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:03,869
What?

684
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:05,359
No.

685
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,500
I mean, they're the characters.

686
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,299
They are the characters as portrayed by other people.

687
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,019
My figurines are not knickknacks.

688
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:15,519
Is it?

689
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,220
I mean, I see Groot.

690
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,460
I will sacrifice your head.

691
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,339
And take us to the majestic mountains of Kakarantara.

692
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:28,859
Guys, I think we should hear out Groot for once.

693
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,339
I am.

694
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:39,240
Now, the only problem with your plan is that Lady Hellbender only buys monsters,

695
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,319
and you are not a monster.

696
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:43,400
Groot, are you really offering to-

697
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,920
No, no, he is not offering that, okay?

698
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,880
It could work.

699
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,599
So Groot, I guess we could bust him out after.

700
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,099
Absurd.

701
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:55,420
Lady Hellbender seeks the monster with him.

702
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,059
The small ugly one is clearly the correct choice.

703
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,220
He's cruel, sadistic, and his soul is filthy and filled with rage.

704
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,180
I vote we sell Groot.

705
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,680
Yeah?

706
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,900
I honestly think Lady Hellbender will go for it.

707
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,700
Yeah, well-

708
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,619
Yeah, this is the first 10 minutes of the game.

709
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:10,539
I also vote for the creepy little beasts.

710
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:12,059
Two votes each.

711
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:13,359
Peter?

712
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,119
But is this-

713
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:21,000
Well, Rocket's definitely scarier on the inside.

714
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,039
He's unstable and vicious and totally oblivious to the needs of us.

715
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,559
Are we still into dialogue trees?

716
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,279
I feel like that's-

717
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,079
All right, let's do this.

718
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:27,559
That's gone.

719
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,680
Let's go sell a monster.

720
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,720
But I think everyone learned that they don't change anything.

721
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,519
Because you're going to sell either one of those two characters,

722
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,200
arrive in the level,

723
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,799
and then they're going to jump through a wall and say,

724
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,299
I was here.

725
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:16,569
It's not Spider-Man.

726
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:17,069
No, it's not.

727
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:20,509
True?

728
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:27,700
I honestly think the dialogue, as much as I'm-

729
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:29,940
It's not for me.

730
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,680
They're doing a good job, like, delivered well.

731
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,539
I mean, it's going to be-

732
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:43,019
It's going to be like a licensed video game, right?

733
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:43,420
I don't know.

734
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:48,180
It's probably going to be 10 hours, 8 hours or something.

735
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,660
All your favorite characters are here.

736
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,779
Look, some people really do love this franchise, and that's fine.

737
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:54,740
And I hope you like it.

738
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:00,980
Okay, if this was Diablo II, right?

739
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,500
And like, imagine this perspective.

740
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:07,140
Imagine you're controlling the character here,

741
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,380
and this is a third-person perspective.

742
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,820
It's Diablo II and items fall down.

743
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,539
I'd be excited for it.

744
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:25,159
This is a really good indicator of what we're talking about.

745
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,840
What's your favorite movie?

746
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:28,869
My favorite movie?

747
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:29,510
What's your favorite movie?

748
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,630
What's your favorite movie?

749
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,989
There's so many movies.

750
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,190
You're putting me on the spot.

751
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,230
Whatever I pick.

752
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,269
What's like a top-

753
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:35,750
What's on your top 10?

754
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,789
I said my favorite movie was Coraline like 8 years ago,

755
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:39,829
and people quote me on that.

756
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,590
I don't think I can commit to this.

757
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,150
Okay, well, so you would put Coraline in your top 10?

758
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,030
No, I wouldn't.

759
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,030
That's why it hurts me.

760
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,789
So what's a movie that you think is in your top 10?

761
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,119
I'm going to go with the tried, the true, the classic.

762
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,880
You can't go wrong with Forrest Gump.

763
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,599
Like, I won't be upset by saying that.

764
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,099
Okay.

765
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,400
If they made a Forrest Gump video game that was nerd person,

766
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,199
would you play it?

767
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,719
If you could, like, play as Forrest Gump.

768
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:13,599
Never mind.

769
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah, like a top-down game where Forrest Gump is, like,

770
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,480
beating people up and, like, loops dropping, like, Diablo 2.

771
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,480
Yeah, I'd play that.

772
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,159
I concede, I would.

773
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,400
You would play that.

774
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,119
You would like it.

775
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,800
Gump Royale, last runner standing.

776
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,559
Yeah, you would play the shit out of that.

777
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:46,119
Are you kidding me?

778
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:51,559
I'd give it a try.

779
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:52,679
I'd try anything once.

780
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:53,880
I mean, if you can bend that far,

781
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,000
you're going to try anything once.

782
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,280
God, get out of here.

783
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,880
I have to have, like, a three-strike policy with you.

784
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,239
Like, when you cross two strikes,

785
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,920
I need to, like, send you a message to Discord

786
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,079
and be like, hey, you're on two strikes.

787
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,679
Do I get a cooldown?

788
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:09,179
No.

789
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,639
Okay, so are we on one strike?

790
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:14,119
No, you're on five strikes.

791
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,239
I'm reducing it back to two.

792
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:16,920
One more strike and you're out.

793
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,269
And I'm just going to have to be

794
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:24,980
the neutral planet from Futurama.

795
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:26,420
Yes.

796
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,460
That's me from now on.

797
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,820
This game looks complete.

798
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,440
Oh, look, okay, let's give them some credit

799
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,400
because they should get it.

800
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:43,559
They are showing this is the video game.

801
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,199
Okay, compare this to Avengers.

802
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:48,440
But this is not, like, rock music playing

803
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,360
and, like, a CGI cut scene of people,

804
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,039
like, holding their guns in the camera.

805
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:54,280
Like, this is the video game.

806
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,320
They're showing the game.

807
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,679
This is probably the first 10 minutes of the game.

808
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,440
That's all right.

809
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,880
They're doing that.

810
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,880
They should deserve a little bit of credit.

811
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,679
They should.

812
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,800
I also respect the bare minimum of presenting something.

813
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,139
Like, they're not, look,

814
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:09,739
there's a little bit of frame rate dropping.

815
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:12,380
Like, it's fine, but that's going to happen, right?

816
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:12,880
Ah.

817
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:15,269
This actually kind of looks fun.

818
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:16,550
Like, I don't hate this.

819
00:37:17,429 --> 00:37:21,989
Although, like, I don't know about the character switching.

820
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,300
I don't know.

821
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,420
Maybe it would be fun for a little bit.

822
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,659
Look, if you're a fan of the game, a fan of the series,

823
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:39,429
I don't want to get into the uncharted territory of, like,

824
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,349
oh, this is stupid.

825
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:41,909
I don't like this.

826
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:42,869
Dumb game sucks.

827
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,750
If I was a fan of this game, I would love this shit.

828
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,989
Like, people, you're allowed to like things.

829
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:50,469
You know what I mean?

830
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,630
How should we decide?

831
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,550
I would love each frame.

832
00:37:55,349 --> 00:38:02,179
So that's why I was like half joking, but it really is like,

833
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,260
it is authentically Guardians of the Galaxy.

834
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:10,949
It honestly seems like a lot of effort to put into one of the less popular series.

835
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:13,139
Who made this?

836
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:16,260
Did they say, oh, there's a Square Enix, but like a publisher.

837
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,219
Eidos Montreal.

838
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,619
Oh, that's what my shot was complaining about.

839
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:24,340
They said Deus Ex died for this.

840
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,219
Now I understand.

841
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:29,500
Oh, wait, is that Eidos Montreal?

842
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,019
Fairly certain.

843
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:36,579
I only got one face quote.

844
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:37,860
Are you sure about this, Peter?

845
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:39,780
Look at him.

846
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:48,420
Oh, isn't it super popular?

847
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:48,900
I don't know.

848
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,619
I'm a boomer.

849
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,539
I only like Spider-Man.

850
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,079
Guardians is really popular, yeah.

851
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,800
I mean, Disney knows.

852
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,360
They're making a bunch of rides, aren't they?

853
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,840
Aren't they changing Guardians to like a bunch of rides at Disney?

854
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,460
But when the time comes, it's definitely popular enough to do that.

855
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:18,730
True.

856
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,730
I think I'm still stuck like really.

857
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,010
It really is like a boomer thing.

858
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:26,730
I'm stuck when Guardians of the Galaxy only existed in Marvel's versus Capcom

859
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,250
and nobody knew who the characters were.

860
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:31,449
That's where my like brain ages.

861
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:33,989
Wait, what they they were.

862
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,289
Yeah, they were in the game.

863
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:37,769
That's right.

864
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:39,610
Holy shit.

865
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:42,179
I completely forgot about that.

866
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:50,250
Yeah, they also had a lot of the Doctor Strange characters in it.

867
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:54,250
And then Doctor Strange didn't have a movie either for like five years after Marvel.

868
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:59,289
So like everyone's like, who's Dormammu?

869
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:00,809
The heck is a dagger of Denon?

870
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:03,849
Isn't Dormammu like a playable character?

871
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:05,690
No, he's a boss, right?

872
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:07,210
No, he's playable.

873
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:09,130
The boss is Galactus.

874
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:09,630
Oh, right.

875
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,849
Yeah, Dormammu is in the game.

876
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,289
You're unlocking a part of my memory I did not think was going to get unlocked.

877
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:22,760
Dormammu, I'm here to bargain.

878
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,440
Yeah, I think they were working on all these movies

879
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,679
and didn't realize how long they would take to finish.

880
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,599
And then Marvel came out with all these characters

881
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,599
for like upcoming movies 10 years later.

882
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:39,690
This is a very long earlier.

883
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,170
Well, what else is this work?

884
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,050
What else are they going to show?

885
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,219
Hitman, I would assume.

886
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,679
There's a new Hitman like every month.

887
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:51,159
How could they?

888
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,280
No, no, no.

889
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,360
But Hitman is, I mean, I did hate one of the levels.

890
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:59,400
But didn't they just come out with like a new one?

891
00:40:59,400 --> 00:40:59,719
Yeah.

892
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,559
And I hated one of the levels.

893
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,840
I thought it was the worst game.

894
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,000
I thought it was the worst level they've ever put in a Hitman game.

895
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:06,679
Germa speaks out.

896
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,960
But it was great.

897
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,670
Never mind.

898
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,690
But yeah, maybe they wouldn't be doing Hitman.

899
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,190
I don't know.

900
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:17,239
Tomb Raider, that's true.

901
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:18,039
Probably another Tomb Raider.

902
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:26,869
October, that's coming out like this way in like a couple months.

903
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,309
What year is it?

904
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,210
I'm not playing it until the Snyder cut.

905
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:33,300
That's only four months from now.

906
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:40,550
Going to revisit two iconic brands that are being remastered for modern platforms.

907
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:40,949
Oh.

908
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:45,030
First up, relive the classic games in the Final Fantasy series.

909
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:49,349
And then get one more peek at Legend of Mana ahead of its June 24th launch.

910
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:50,309
Oh, wait a minute.

911
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:51,030
I'm interested in that.

912
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,230
Am I pretending to like that?

913
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,789
Let's find out.

914
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:55,349
Are you what?

915
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:56,309
I might be pretending to like that.

916
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:58,469
I don't know why, but I think I like that.

917
00:41:58,469 --> 00:41:59,510
Legends of Mana?

918
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,010
Yeah.

919
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:09,840
Mana?

920
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:14,579
What are they remastering?

921
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:15,619
All of them?

922
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:18,710
Wait, that's a lot.

923
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:24,300
Yeah, we're going to remaster every Final Fantasy ever.

924
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:27,119
Okay.

925
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,500
Do you like this?

926
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:33,860
I mean, that was...

927
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:37,159
I guess that's kind of cool.

928
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,500
Do you think that the last Final Fantasy is going to be called The Final Fantasy?

929
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:56,519
When they decide to stop?

930
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:59,239
I don't think they'll know it's the final one until it's too late.

931
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:05,179
Next, Earth's mightiest heroes continue their fight to defend the world in Marvel's Avengers.

932
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:08,860
The team at Crystal Dynamics is excited to share the latest updates with you.

933
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,500
Including new missions...

934
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:09,980
Oh, nice.

935
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,099
I've been wondering about this.

936
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:11,739
Yeah.

937
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:13,420
Please, God, come back to our game.

938
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:15,900
Please, for the love of God, play it again.

939
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,010
We swear.

940
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,130
We swear it's worth it.

941
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,250
Please, more than eight of you.

942
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,889
...secure that super weapon at all costs.

943
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:26,699
Cosmic energy...

944
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:29,539
Is that...

945
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:30,980
Was that normal guy Thor?

946
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,780
...counts, people.

947
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,900
Keep it moving.

948
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:44,199
It's beautiful, isn't it?

949
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:44,679
Marvel.

950
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:45,960
Yeah, it is like Marvel.

951
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:54,300
No music.

952
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:58,340
Yeah, they didn't even try on this one.

953
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,539
This is like when you put on like Big Bang Theory without the laugh track.

954
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:02,980
I will save it.

955
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,659
There you go.

956
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:05,579
Cool.

957
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,059
They're fucking up that cube.

958
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:12,019
You don't understand what that cube is capable of.

959
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:15,099
Cosmic cube.

960
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,559
Uh-huh.

961
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:35,219
Yeah, this feels really weird.

962
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,550
I feel like I...

963
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:47,510
I feel like I have like...

964
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,190
In like, Premiere.

965
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,809
Like I forgot to put the music track on it.

966
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:56,010
If you were gonna forget to put music on a game, it would be this one.

967
00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:58,730
Oh, here we go.

968
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:08,699
So is every...

969
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,139
When did Square Enix get like all this Marvel license?

970
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:15,820
It's like the first two games are shown.

971
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,210
But when you get it, you run with it.

972
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,730
The sound of his like leather daddy suit as he walks to his throne.

973
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:34,099
I love it.

974
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:36,099
There needs to be music.

975
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,659
No, there doesn't.

976
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,659
It's way better without it.

977
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:52,300
How would you hear Black Panther's thighs grinding with music?

978
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,809
Can I just play this game?

979
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,989
I don't want like the Avenger...

980
00:46:05,989 --> 00:46:07,989
All the Avengers Avengers crystal nightmare.

981
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:11,030
It does just have like a bunch of replayable enemy spawn games.

982
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:15,639
So what you're asking...

983
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,840
Okay, Jerma, what you're asking for is the Guardians of the Galaxy game.

984
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,449
This looks like way cooler than everything they just showed.

985
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:27,780
Yeah, because it's not in-game footage.

986
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,110
Did you get confused again and think that it was gameplay?

987
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:38,719
Fuck!

988
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:43,019
No, I'm not that stupid.

989
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,400
Okay.

990
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:52,940
Oh shoot!

991
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,440
Hitman!

992
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,639
I keep just turning on my webcam for four seconds.

993
00:46:58,639 --> 00:46:59,679
Like, why do I even have it?

994
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:03,920
You're looking good today.

995
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,380
Wait, are we gonna get to play a mobile Hitman?

996
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,099
Oh, it's a sniper.

997
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:14,780
Like, they keep making the sniper game.

998
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,739
Yeah, they put snipers in it.

999
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:21,179
Earth, space, sniper, the trifecta.

1000
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:24,809
Oh, they're not even trying.

1001
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:29,469
There's no music.

1002
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:34,320
At least make it funny and put crickets here, you know what I mean?

1003
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,639
But I guess that'd be kind of rude to the developer, right?

1004
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:41,579
Well, I don't know if it's Twitch that did this or they that did this.

1005
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:44,840
Or they that did this.

1006
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:53,820
So, there's definitely a voiceover here that is part of this.

1007
00:47:53,820 --> 00:48:01,480
Yeah, I mean, it must be Twitch because it's not like Square Enix had Sonic music.

1008
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:07,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1009
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,239
They listened, they heard us.

1010
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:15,019
No, this is like old movies back in the olden days.

1011
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:16,860
You probably remember when they would have to have

1012
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,340
someone actually do the sound effects behind the projector.

1013
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:21,960
Like, Twitch is doing this live.

1014
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:29,530
What is this?

1015
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:30,329
Is this Final Fantasy?

1016
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,420
Yeah, I think there's a Final Fantasy Battle Royale.

1017
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:36,920
Oh, wait.

1018
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,360
No, that's the...

1019
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,329
Catsith is going to be in that one, right?

1020
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:42,730
Cats?

1021
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:43,769
Catsith.

1022
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:50,409
Today, the team at Platinum Games is giving you an exclusive look at the epic world of Babylon's Fall.

1023
00:48:50,409 --> 00:48:52,090
Final Fantasy VII.

1024
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,489
Powerful weapons and a unique art style.

1025
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:59,710
Yes, he has six strikes now.

1026
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,590
And he hasn't given me any more.

1027
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:05,440
I should have, twice at least.

1028
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,059
Well, then you got to stay on it.

1029
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,059
Catsith?

1030
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:13,099
No, Catsith.

1031
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,920
One with the dice.

1032
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,119
That's my favorite character in any...

1033
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,039
That's the only Final Fantasy character I even care about.

1034
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:57,659
Does the savior of Neo Babylon stand among us?

1035
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:00,699
Let's find out without further ado.

1036
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:04,599
I like this game, though.

1037
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,480
I knew you would.

1038
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,840
I knew that'd sell you.

1039
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,800
I'm sold already.

1040
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,300
What Jerva voice was that?

1041
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,900
If I'm to die, then I'll die for hope.

1042
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,559
For what little hope?

1043
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:25,800
This...

1044
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,909
This does not look good.

1045
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:32,510
I'm just gonna...

1046
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,710
I'm gonna be blunt about it.

1047
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,869
I feel like they announced this game like four or five years ago.

1048
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:44,860
I don't understand, but it has...

1049
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:50,059
Doesn't mean it's gonna be good.

1050
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:52,699
It has 10 out of 10 voice acting and music choice.

1051
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:54,829
Not muted music.

1052
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:05,309
This voiceover reminds me of a lot of rock songs in the 80s.

1053
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:10,889
It would kind of just like talk really weirdly over the music for a second,

1054
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:11,769
and then they'd go into it.

1055
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:27,400
It looks like they didn't finish the graphics.

1056
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,480
They put a watercolor filter over everything to like hide it.

1057
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,760
They just like smudged it all together.

1058
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:39,530
I can't say I'm not interested, though.

1059
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:42,170
I think I'm interested for a bunch of different reasons.

1060
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:45,840
Well, because you're in it.

1061
00:51:57,389 --> 00:51:58,349
Did you play any of the near games?

1062
00:52:00,429 --> 00:52:01,789
I played near automata.

1063
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:03,949
I thought it was fun.

1064
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:05,949
What is it again?

1065
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,190
I played near automata.

1066
00:52:09,469 --> 00:52:10,429
It's not automata?

1067
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:13,150
Near automata.

1068
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:16,349
Near automata?

1069
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,070
Oh, well, all right.

1070
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:19,389
Anyways.

1071
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:21,869
Automata.

1072
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:23,230
Yeah, I played near automata.

1073
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:25,869
And it was fun.

1074
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:29,630
But then everyone will tell you that you have to beat the game six times to actually enjoy it.

1075
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,869
To which I say, nah.

1076
00:52:35,309 --> 00:52:36,110
It always looked fun.

1077
00:52:37,469 --> 00:52:38,269
I just never played it.

1078
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:49,800
Should I play that?

1079
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:54,440
Should I like stream near automata?

1080
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,000
You're not going to do anything like weird while you play it, are you?

1081
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,519
You're not going to, like, try and look up her skirt.

1082
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:02,280
It's strike three.

1083
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:02,679
He's gone.

1084
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:03,719
Strike three.

1085
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:04,199
He's out of here.

1086
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:05,400
I'm voting him.

1087
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,920
No, they built that into the...

1088
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:09,719
He's beautiful.

1089
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:10,440
He's gone.

1090
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:10,920
It's strike three.

1091
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:18,119
All right, you can come back if you apologize for getting a third strike.

1092
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,000
I'd like to apologize to the German985 community about the remarks I made

1093
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,760
in relation to German985 looking up a skirt.

1094
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,000
He would never do that.

1095
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,400
And I'd like to apologize for anyone that I offended that

1096
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,000
enjoys even casually 2B fan art.

1097
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,280
Highbrow 2B fan art.

1098
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,599
You're the worst.

1099
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,719
Now let's check out the next major entry in the popular Life is Strange series.

1100
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:49,920
True Colors.

1101
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,079
The team at Deck Nine is ready to give you a deeper look at Alex Chen's psychic power.

1102
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:54,639
All right.

1103
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:56,639
Did you play Life is Strange 1?

1104
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:57,840
Yes.

1105
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,719
Oh, you want to know how...

1106
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:01,280
Like, okay.

1107
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,000
I just...

1108
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,239
I have every opinion that no one likes.

1109
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:08,639
I think Life is Strange 1 is great and I think the ending is perfect

1110
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,320
and exactly how it had to happen.

1111
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,679
And everyone hates the ending.

1112
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:13,199
So I'm just always wrong.

1113
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,349
I thought it was good, yeah.

1114
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,360
I thought it was really, really cool.

1115
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:22,059
But I don't like...

1116
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,300
I played Life is Strange.

1117
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,059
I was like, oh, that was pretty cool.

1118
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,579
I liked that.

1119
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:29,099
That didn't look like much of a difference.

1120
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,739
That doesn't look like it's very much of a change at all.

1121
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:32,780
Oh, I didn't even notice.

1122
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,739
This is a remaster.

1123
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:34,940
Didn't this come out like...

1124
00:54:35,659 --> 00:54:36,780
That looked like...

1125
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:42,380
That looked like when they do like the PS4 versus Xbox One graphic changes.

1126
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,019
Like differences.

1127
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:48,010
And I kind of felt like the splotchy characters was on purpose.

1128
00:54:48,969 --> 00:54:50,170
It was kind of the way it looked.

1129
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,130
No, I liked Life is Strange.

1130
00:54:53,929 --> 00:54:55,449
I thought it was like really interesting.

1131
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:57,289
I'm trying to remember...

1132
00:54:57,289 --> 00:54:58,650
Okay, obviously don't spoil the whole game.

1133
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:02,079
I'm trying to remember the ending of Life is Strange.

1134
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:02,480
Oh, my...

1135
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:02,880
Well, there...

1136
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,199
Oh, well...

1137
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:07,230
Can't spoil that.

1138
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,030
But wait, wait, wait.

1139
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:08,510
Hold on.

1140
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:09,150
This is...

1141
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:10,110
Wait a minute.

1142
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:10,750
I want to watch this.

1143
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:22,090
No, this is not...

1144
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,050
Life is Strange is like...

1145
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,050
No, this is a remake.

1146
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:25,929
I already know what's going on.

1147
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:32,809
It's spoiling everything.

1148
00:55:33,769 --> 00:55:35,769
I guess they just assumed that you like already played it.

1149
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,860
People didn't like the ending to Life is Strange.

1150
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,579
Yeah, it was one of those like reddit opinions.

1151
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:48,460
So it was probably a small minority of very vocal angry people.

1152
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,059
I think it kind of fell in line with like none of your choices matter.

1153
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:55,099
But that's...

1154
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:57,340
I mean, that's just true of life because life is deterministic

1155
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:01,099
and the simulation won't let you escape the bounds predetermined for you.

1156
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:03,260
So like how is that not realistic?

1157
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,539
Hey, you want me to go off on this?

1158
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,619
You can see what he said.

1159
00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:07,260
What are you talking about?

1160
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:07,739
It sucks.

1161
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,099
This is...

1162
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:13,980
You know what this reminds me of?

1163
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,900
That reminds me of like those old infomercials for the HD sunglasses.

1164
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,039
Remember those?

1165
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:23,159
Put on the HD sunglasses and look at what the world looks like.

1166
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:25,159
Brighten up your day.

1167
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,159
Oh, this road sure does look boring, but with our HD technology.

1168
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:30,519
And it does that little...

1169
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:31,000
Oh, wow.

1170
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,039
Look at how much different it looks.

1171
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:33,719
Is this like a little bit better?

1172
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:36,909
Of Hayden Springs.

1173
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:41,639
Today, we have a first look at Alex's unique power in action.

1174
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:44,199
Here's game director, Zach Harris, for more.

1175
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:44,599
Haha.

1176
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:45,960
Laugh my ass off, you're cringe.

1177
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,480
Whoa.

1178
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:47,800
Whoa.

1179
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,000
Can we not bring up Kringa?

1180
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,960
Alex's psychic power of empathy is integral to the story of Life is Strange True Colors.

1181
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:54,360
Okay.

1182
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,639
Quiet actually, because I'm interested in this.

1183
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:59,239
Every relationship she builds and every decision she makes.

1184
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:02,039
Never thought I'd have a freaky and bad friend.

1185
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:06,920
For years, Alex has been unable to shut out the strong feelings of others.

1186
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,159
The fear, sadness, and anger of those around her.

1187
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:14,039
Leading her to believe her power is a curse.

1188
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:16,760
In the wake of Gabe's death,

1189
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:21,239
Alex realizes the only way she can find the truth is to embrace her power.

1190
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:22,679
Is this part of the remaster or no?

1191
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:23,480
This is a new game, right?

1192
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,440
No, this is the new game.

1193
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:31,159
And the only way to understand is to feel what he's feeling.

1194
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:36,119
From the very start, you can use Alex's power to focus on brightly colored auras,

1195
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,760
to gain an insight into people's emotions.

1196
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,829
Gabe was too young.

1197
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:43,309
Just too young.

1198
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:48,349
These valuable insights deepen Alex's relationships with the folk of Haven Springs,

1199
00:57:48,349 --> 00:57:51,550
as well as sparking new dialogue options and events.

1200
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:54,269
As here, from a scene very early on in the game.

1201
00:57:54,829 --> 00:57:55,710
You're gonna lose her.

1202
00:57:56,269 --> 00:57:59,469
You're gonna lose her and it's all your fault.

1203
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:05,289
Alex has uncovered a secret that Mac wants to keep hidden from his long-term girlfriend.

1204
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:10,809
And now he is terrified that Alex will reveal it before he can talk to Riley.

1205
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:14,650
She is the best thing that's ever happened to me.

1206
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:17,900
Please.

1207
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,900
Wait, do they know she's in their head?

1208
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:24,880
Mac's telling you a whole lot of bullshit.

1209
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:27,119
Thanks for telling me the truth, Alex.

1210
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:28,559
Do they know?

1211
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:33,599
I think they were implying that you confronted him or he caught you.

1212
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,559
I don't know, man.

1213
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:34,960
I don't know.

1214
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,519
That would be really weird if they could know.

1215
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:41,440
Honestly, that's actually kind of an interesting idea.

1216
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,119
Being able to read people's minds and have to make decisions based on knowing what they know.

1217
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,400
They don't know that you know.

1218
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,039
That's kind of weird.

1219
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,679
I think what this really just comes down to is that people should just talk.

1220
00:58:57,679 --> 00:58:59,280
They should tell everyone how they're feeling.

1221
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,159
Um, and they should open up.

1222
00:59:03,869 --> 00:59:06,989
And, you know, let's just let it out, Jerma.

1223
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,349
What have you been hiding?

1224
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,460
Scream Disco Elsion.

1225
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:25,019
Oh, it's a long game.

1226
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:55,179
The only emotion she can't feel are her own.

1227
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:06,139
That's not that far away.

1228
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:21,900
Somebody said acting.

1229
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:23,340
Oh, yeah.

1230
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,380
I mean, they're actors acting as characters in a game.

1231
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:28,679
Oh, fuck it.

1232
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:29,559
Oh, actors.

1233
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:32,840
What?

1234
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,519
Somebody said, well, fucking acting.

1235
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,719
Yeah, but why did you pick that comment out?

1236
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:39,039
I don't know.

1237
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,400
Like, make a point.

1238
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,679
Like, everyone else are you guys.

1239
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:42,079
It's interesting.

1240
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,119
We are excited to...

1241
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,199
Anyone who missed out, these are actors.

1242
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,519
I thought it was funny.

1243
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:48,320
I thought it was interesting.

1244
01:00:49,039 --> 01:01:00,250
To kill Chaos.

1245
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,010
That's my mission.

1246
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,360
I just want...

1247
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,079
At one point...

1248
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:05,880
Oh, wait, quiet.

1249
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,250
Looks like Chaos has been waiting for us.

1250
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:14,280
You gonna make us go in there and find you?

1251
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:17,050
Guess we'll just show ourselves here.

1252
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,000
I only know one thing.

1253
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:23,820
We want to kill Chaos.

1254
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:25,500
We need to.

1255
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,460
It's not a hope or a dream.

1256
01:01:29,179 --> 01:01:31,630
It's like a hunger, a thirst.

1257
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:35,630
I'm pretending Andy right now.

1258
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,949
I've not played one Devil May Cry game.

1259
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:44,110
I'm not even sure I've put a Team Ninja disc into the tray of any console I've ever owned.

1260
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:44,909
I'm serious.

1261
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,510
Why am I pretending to be excited for this?

1262
01:01:46,989 --> 01:01:49,230
This is the shrine of Chaos.

1263
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:50,349
He's here.

1264
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:54,429
Is that rhetorical?

1265
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:57,869
Maybe it's because I think everyone's really excited for this.

1266
01:01:57,869 --> 01:02:01,469
So if I say like, oh, whoa, Team Ninja, people will think I'm cool and like me.

1267
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:02,030
This is it.

1268
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:02,909
Yeah.

1269
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:03,869
Yeah.

1270
01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:04,429
No, you know.

1271
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:06,190
Yeah.

1272
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:09,789
Like, I know they make good games and I know the games usually are pretty good.

1273
01:02:09,789 --> 01:02:13,309
You know that other people care about it and you're receptive.

1274
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:18,030
You have the empathy power to know what empathies other people are feeling and you respect their

1275
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:22,269
feelings and you want to not have me talking over their favorite games so they don't say comments

1276
01:02:22,269 --> 01:02:24,030
like shut up, star shot, I'm listening.

1277
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:24,670
I needed him.

1278
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:25,389
Let's strike five.

1279
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:43,610
I think this plot of this game has something to do with killing Chaos.

1280
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,260
Stranger of Paradise.

1281
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:06,619
Final Fantasy Origin.

1282
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,639
No, see, they didn't call it the Final Fantasy.

1283
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:12,199
They didn't.

1284
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:13,320
They called it.

1285
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,440
Well, that's the first one.

1286
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,119
This is this is Final Fantasy zero.

1287
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:19,079
Well, isn't the first one also the Final Fantasy?

1288
01:03:21,789 --> 01:03:22,829
No others have happened yet.

1289
01:03:25,449 --> 01:03:29,050
I mean, it's Final Fantasy one, essentially.

1290
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:37,389
Like what?

1291
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:39,070
Oh, Final Fantasy seven.

1292
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:44,750
I actually okay.

1293
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,510
I talked a lot of shit about this game.

1294
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:50,670
When we remember the original trailer that like three or four years ago.

1295
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:53,550
I was I talked about Final Fantasy seven's remake.

1296
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:59,230
I talked a bunch of shit and it I mean it looked actually kind of looks kind of fun.

1297
01:04:01,949 --> 01:04:03,579
Okay, is that it?

1298
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,269
Is it no more?

1299
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:09,239
Who could say?

1300
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:14,639
Well, it was just like a couple of Marvel games and I guess they did show.

1301
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,000
I mean, Square Enix is not like fucking Microsoft.

1302
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:28,280
Just a couple of Marvel games.

1303
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:28,760
Fuck you.

1304
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,800
Thank you for joining us.

1305
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,280
That's it.

1306
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,000
Keep an eye out for news about our next Square.

1307
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:33,880
Thank you for joining us.

1308
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:39,239
All they showed was just a couple of Marvel games and some Final Fantasies.

1309
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:40,440
Like thank you for joining us.

1310
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,320
Our entire fucking budget of like 700 million dollars went to getting the licensed characters

1311
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:48,599
for Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers.

1312
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:55,610
So we had no leftover for the licensing for the music we used in that same trailer.

1313
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:56,489
Well, all right.

1314
01:04:56,489 --> 01:04:57,610
No, I guess they have it.

1315
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:58,489
Twitch doesn't have it.

1316
01:04:58,489 --> 01:04:59,820
Never mind.

1317
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,780
I'm just wrong.

1318
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:01,659
And no, Spider-Man.

1319
01:05:05,789 --> 01:05:10,429
We are definitely not going to sit around and let stir become a brand risk for an hour

1320
01:05:10,429 --> 01:05:11,710
and a half to wait for the PC show.

1321
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:13,550
So that's not going to happen.

1322
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,659
What did you think?

1323
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:23,550
Um, none of that was for me.

1324
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:25,869
I gotta get a haircut.

1325
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,800
Hey, talk about the game.

1326
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,079
This guy's coming to here talking about haircuts.

1327
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:32,639
Look, we're trying to talk about the games.

1328
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:35,130
I'm hiding it very well, aren't I?

1329
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:38,570
No, honestly, if Square Enix were going to show anything,

1330
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:43,530
I don't understand why they wouldn't show the new Final Fantasy that they've been working on,

1331
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:45,289
which seemed mostly complete.

1332
01:05:45,289 --> 01:05:47,289
So you would think they would have gameplay or some more.

1333
01:05:47,289 --> 01:05:50,809
Because what I've I've never really cared about a Final Fantasy before,

1334
01:05:51,369 --> 01:05:55,050
but that one looked really pretty and had like garbage swamp monsters.

1335
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,610
So I wanted to see more and I don't know where it was.

1336
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:58,809
Do you think I would count all off?

1337
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:03,050
You're still talking about your hair.

1338
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,880
Um, Square Enix.

1339
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,639
Well, we're just giving free advertisements here.

1340
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:09,139
Turn it off.

1341
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:18,489
Um, what is, um, oh, no, I don't know.

1342
01:06:18,489 --> 01:06:18,889
What is it?

1343
01:06:18,889 --> 01:06:22,329
So Square, I guess the Final Fantasy thing is pretty cool, right?

1344
01:06:22,889 --> 01:06:24,219
That actually is probably the biggest thing.

1345
01:06:24,219 --> 01:06:24,719
Which one?

1346
01:06:25,659 --> 01:06:29,900
The final fantasy origins thing, the actual like the team ninja game.

1347
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,349
That's kind of a big deal.

1348
01:06:32,349 --> 01:06:34,030
Okay, I agree.

1349
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,559
That game probably be fun.

1350
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:41,579
Yep.

1351
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,679
What else are you supposed to do on?

1352
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:45,480
You know what I mean?

1353
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:46,440
That's the thing.

1354
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,860
Like, okay, I just.

1355
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:49,980
Exactly, Jerma.

1356
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,199
If you're just excited about everything, you can't say anything.

1357
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:58,250
You need to let your hate out.

1358
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:02,329
You have so much within you.

1359
01:07:02,329 --> 01:07:02,969
Just give it.

1360
01:07:02,969 --> 01:07:04,570
Yes, chaos.

1361
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:11,420
I, but I've, I've, I've said my pieces about how I don't like certain things.

1362
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:13,019
We've already, we've gone over them today.

1363
01:07:13,019 --> 01:07:18,650
We've talked about things that I didn't like.

1364
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:22,329
This is mostly me, but there wasn't much.

1365
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,110
I know what you're talking about.

1366
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:25,869
You're, I, you, I really like you.

1367
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:28,190
I just keep getting attacked lately.

1368
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:30,030
My wife keeps attacking me.

1369
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:33,929
Well, I don't, that's between you and your wife.

1370
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:35,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

1371
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,550
So he hates Capcom.

1372
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:40,349
Wait, Capcom?

1373
01:07:40,349 --> 01:07:41,230
What, what?

1374
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:45,320
I said fuck Capcom like two, three weeks ago because.

1375
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,360
All right, let me ask you this.

1376
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,679
The only game you've played in like the last year was the Resident Evil one, which is Capcom.

1377
01:07:51,159 --> 01:07:56,219
Listen, so I said I've opened up Resident Evil 8 on PC

1378
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:57,900
and the game's not 90 FOV.

1379
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,940
It's locked at like 81 and you can't change it.

1380
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,519
So I freaked out.

1381
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:04,360
I've said, I said, fuck Capcom.

1382
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,800
Fuck this whole company.

1383
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,119
And people were like, whoa, dude, fucking relax.

1384
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:11,159
People were like actually like selling, saying, hey, dude, relax.

1385
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:12,360
Like it's not that big of a deal.

1386
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,909
And I was like, I, I didn't even backpedal.

1387
01:08:14,909 --> 01:08:16,989
I just doubled down and was like, no, fuck that.

1388
01:08:16,989 --> 01:08:18,109
That's fucking bullshit.

1389
01:08:18,109 --> 01:08:22,329
And I went off on how like surprised that 81 FOV.

1390
01:08:22,329 --> 01:08:24,329
Cause it's like, it makes me sick.

1391
01:08:24,329 --> 01:08:24,970
It doesn't, it makes me.

1392
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:27,529
And they're like, yeah, I got used to it after like three hours.

1393
01:08:27,529 --> 01:08:28,970
But like, what, how do you feel about that?

1394
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,189
Don't you feel like it?

1395
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:32,670
I feel that you shouldn't have to get used to it.

1396
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,510
They should get used to developing games

1397
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,750
that you can play without feeling nauseous.

1398
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,350
Thank you.

1399
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:39,560
Yes.

1400
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,840
But when you come, see, you're, you're, you put a foot into my world.

1401
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:46,039
When you complain about a game, it's your fault for complaining.

1402
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:49,880
And then a whole bunch of people show up to like praise the corporation

1403
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,880
who created this for me.

1404
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,079
And you're just satisfied with it.

1405
01:08:53,079 --> 01:08:57,310
But if you're satisfied, they just keep shitting on you.

1406
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:59,949
So in reality, you want.

1407
01:08:59,949 --> 01:09:00,909
No, no, no, no, no.

1408
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:02,270
Resident Evil 2 is like one of my favorite games

1409
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:03,069
the last like five years.

1410
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:04,039
Don't say that.

1411
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:04,840
Resident Evil 2.

1412
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:06,699
The remake.

1413
01:09:06,699 --> 01:09:12,270
Doesn't that make you sad that your favorite game is a remake of an old game?

1414
01:09:12,989 --> 01:09:13,949
It was very good.

1415
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:17,069
Like, look, I know, I understand the sentiment of like remake.

1416
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,310
Oh, it was so good.

1417
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:22,989
Mr. X is like one of my favorite things and, and five years at least.

1418
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:27,739
But no, so what you're saying is you're, you just want it.

1419
01:09:27,739 --> 01:09:29,340
You want things to be better, right?

1420
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:31,020
You want the world, you want things to be better.

1421
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:32,460
You want the game to be better.

1422
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:32,779
Okay.

1423
01:09:32,779 --> 01:09:35,500
Yeah, I can say I can sit there and listen to that.

1424
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:39,239
The remake is so different from the original.

1425
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:40,439
That's also true.

1426
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:42,199
It's very different than the original.

1427
01:09:42,199 --> 01:09:42,680
So I don't know.

1428
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,659
Is it an entire I've never played.

1429
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:50,109
I played like half of Resident Evil 1.

1430
01:09:50,109 --> 01:09:52,270
Remake 2 is a great example of a good remake.

1431
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:52,989
Yeah, it is.

1432
01:09:52,989 --> 01:09:55,069
It's fantastic.

1433
01:09:55,069 --> 01:09:58,350
I think by compact, like I think they gave people so much hope

1434
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:01,630
for how good Resident Evil 2 was because I actually I didn't play it.

1435
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:04,270
But I watched a lot of speed runs and a lot of people were really enjoying it.

1436
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,390
And I watched playthroughs and all that.

1437
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:07,770
But what was the one that came out after that?

1438
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:15,039
The next remake that was like, yeah, that in comparison was like severely lacking.

1439
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,640
And that's what you that's what I'm saying.

1440
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,920
You get complacent.

1441
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,159
You let Capcom take a fucking inch.

1442
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,760
I don't think the same team.

1443
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,720
I don't think Resident Evil 3.

1444
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,260
The remake was made by the same people that made the second one.

1445
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,319
Am I wrong?

1446
01:10:27,319 --> 01:10:28,600
You make an excuses for him.

1447
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,640
No, I'm just saying I don't.

1448
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,880
I think it was a different team that made Resident Evil 2.

1449
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,800
He's making excuses for our remake.

1450
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,529
It was a different team.

1451
01:10:35,529 --> 01:10:38,329
Yeah, no, it was a different team entirely.

1452
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:41,289
Made the third remake versus the second remake.

1453
01:10:41,289 --> 01:10:42,010
So there you go.

1454
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:44,600
There's your answer.

1455
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,159
Okay.

1456
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:51,840
You're a Capcom shill.

1457
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,949
Okay, let's be honest besides Resident Evil 3's remake.

1458
01:10:55,949 --> 01:11:02,970
The last the last like four or five major Capcom releases have been very good.

1459
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:05,050
Haven't they?

1460
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:07,130
Monster Hunter World was really fun.

1461
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,649
I like how I liked it.

1462
01:11:08,649 --> 01:11:11,689
They have been doing a redemption story.

1463
01:11:11,689 --> 01:11:18,109
Resident Evil 7 was really fun except the boat sequence was like a fucking zero out of 10.

1464
01:11:18,109 --> 01:11:21,550
So the game the first like three hours of Resident Evil 7 were like a 9.0.

1465
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:23,710
And then I've said this a million times.

1466
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:26,750
The last like third of Resident Evil 7 is like a two.

1467
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,090
So it averages out.

1468
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:30,359
But Resident Evil 8 was really fun too.

1469
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:31,399
I really liked Resident Evil 8.

1470
01:11:31,399 --> 01:11:34,319
I thought it was great.

1471
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:35,279
Did you play 7?

1472
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:35,680
I did.

1473
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,159
Yeah.

1474
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,800
Did you just not listen to a single thing I just said for the last two minutes?

1475
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,119
I'm just checking and make sure no chatter left behind.

1476
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:42,079
There were some people asking.

1477
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,880
Do you like 7 more than 8 or which one more?

1478
01:11:45,949 --> 01:11:47,390
I had that debate here in this chat.

1479
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:48,189
I don't know.

1480
01:11:48,189 --> 01:11:50,430
I think 8 is a better video game.

1481
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:54,960
But I think 7's potentially like more interesting setting.

1482
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,819
8 is probably a better video game to me.

1483
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:00,779
7 is like a more interesting place I think.

1484
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:01,180
I like them.

1485
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,619
I like the idea.

1486
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:05,659
From my perspective of again I haven't played either of them.

1487
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:07,340
I just watched people play them.

1488
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:09,420
I thought 7 was much much better.

1489
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:12,939
But to say like yeah I could see how you could enjoy the gameplay of 8 more.

1490
01:12:12,939 --> 01:12:14,619
And I'm like I'm not even playing it.

1491
01:12:14,619 --> 01:12:15,500
Did you play 7 and 8?

1492
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,880
Did you play both of them or no?

1493
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:17,119
No.

1494
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:19,600
Like I just said are you even listening to me?

1495
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,380
I watched people play both of them.

1496
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:24,060
We don't even listen to each other.

1497
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,460
We just wait for the opportunity for the next person to talk.

1498
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,460
Fucking political argument right here.

1499
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,460
This is ridiculous.

1500
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:31,819
This is like a case study.

1501
01:12:31,819 --> 01:12:38,670
We both just did not comprehend completely the last sentence both of us just said to each other.

1502
01:12:42,329 --> 01:12:44,010
That just happened in real time.

1503
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:46,649
I'm just going to space out until it's time to make my point.

1504
01:12:46,649 --> 01:12:49,289
I'm going to space it out until I'm going to say yeah Resident Evil 8 was fun.

1505
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:52,199
I liked it.

1506
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:55,439
I think because here's the thing.

1507
01:12:55,439 --> 01:13:02,590
There's like this this period of Resident Evil before 6 and Resident Evil after 6.

1508
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:07,789
They like there was like an absolute like catastrophe around Resident Evil 6.

1509
01:13:07,789 --> 01:13:08,430
Because Resident Evil 4 was incredible.

1510
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:13,100
I don't even remember what 6 was.

1511
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:16,939
Was that the like action-y co-op like I don't even know.

1512
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:18,380
It was awful.

1513
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:21,659
It was just like you shoot machine guns at other guys with machine guns.

1514
01:13:21,659 --> 01:13:23,899
The game was awful awful awful.

1515
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:28,939
So before 6 they had this kind of idea of like oh yeah we'll do like the third person stuff.

1516
01:13:28,939 --> 01:13:31,340
And like well yeah 4 was incredible.

1517
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:32,539
5 was really good.

1518
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:35,579
There was some issues with 5 but it was very very very fun.

1519
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:36,539
I love 5.

1520
01:13:36,539 --> 01:13:39,500
And then they just went full-blown like third person shooter.

1521
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,000
And it was just like well this is kind of stupid.

1522
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,399
So then then we're like oh like we gotta fucking get out of here.

1523
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:45,840
We gotta we gotta change this completely.

1524
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,239
They go back to 7 which is first person.

1525
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:50,970
More scary kind of scary shit.

1526
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:54,170
And then they go to 8 which is more kind of scary shit but more gameplay.

1527
01:13:54,989 --> 01:13:58,680
I am terrified of Resident Evil 9.

1528
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:02,119
Because they might just go full first person like shooter and ruin it.

1529
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:04,380
When they do the third one in a new set.

1530
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,819
That's why you have to be careful.

1531
01:14:05,819 --> 01:14:08,760
Did Capcom show stuff?

1532
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,279
I don't know I don't think so.

1533
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:12,960
5 was good yeah no 5 was good.

1534
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,800
But I'm concerned if they continue the first person shit with Resident Evil.

1535
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,970
If 9 is going to be like the one that everybody goes oh I don't know about this one.

1536
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:26,079
They they have a tendency to do that.

1537
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:29,279
Capcom's tomorrow they're spreading this out to Monday?

1538
01:14:30,439 --> 01:14:31,399
I guess so yeah.

1539
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:33,399
They usually it's four days.

1540
01:14:33,399 --> 01:14:39,710
Okay oh I can we just show all the games on one day.

1541
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:42,510
Then have all the bad ones like not be upvoted on Reddit.

1542
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:44,670
And everyone like misses the announcement.

1543
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:46,270
Well you can't do everything in one day.

1544
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:47,630
Because if you do everything in one day.

1545
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:51,630
Then it would be there would be no time to even digest what happened.

1546
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:56,060
I guess I'm looking forward to see if Dragon's Dogma 2 gets announced.

1547
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:57,340
That's the stir game.

1548
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,039
That is the stir game.

1549
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:00,810
I remember you loved that game.

1550
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:06,000
You played Resident Evil 4 on stream.

1551
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,560
No I I played Resident Evil 4 like five times across five consoles.

1552
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:15,930
So I don't think you'll ever see it here.

1553
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:20,520
I beat the Resident Evil 4 Wii port three times.

1554
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,720
That was so good.

1555
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,520
The Wii version of that game was I remember playing it and going.

1556
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,359
This is what the Wii is for.

1557
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:28,760
This is this is exactly what the Wii is for.

1558
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:31,579
So I love that version.

1559
01:15:31,579 --> 01:15:37,659
It was great.

1560
01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:38,810
Yep.

1561
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:39,529
But yeah.

1562
01:15:39,529 --> 01:15:40,029
Yep.

1563
01:15:42,109 --> 01:15:47,550
Any final thoughts stir before you get a seventh or eighth strike.

1564
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:50,590
I am I'm not getting a seventh strike.

1565
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:51,550
I'm being a good boy.

1566
01:15:52,109 --> 01:15:52,510
I don't know.

1567
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:54,350
Are you waiting for the PC gaming show?

1568
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:55,229
Are you doing that?

1569
01:15:55,229 --> 01:15:56,989
Are we going to like reconnect?

1570
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:59,390
You got to get another coffee.

1571
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:01,949
I mean that's in that's in like an hour and 12 minutes.

1572
01:16:02,829 --> 01:16:06,539
There's no way we're going to sit here and burn an hour and a half.

1573
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:07,340
I'll watch it.

1574
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:08,699
I'll watch it on my big screen.

1575
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:11,199
Big screen.

1576
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:17,119
You know I've had the same TV for like probably 10 years.

1577
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:19,279
I don't know why I get another TV.

1578
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:19,760
You know what I mean.

1579
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,119
If it's a flat screen it's fine.

1580
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:21,680
It's 1080.

1581
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,239
What's the problem?

1582
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,350
I don't know what's the problem.

1583
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:29,550
I think my TV that I have I bought because YouTube gave me a gift card

1584
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:31,949
for getting like 20,000 subscribers.

1585
01:16:31,949 --> 01:16:33,149
Wait what?

1586
01:16:33,149 --> 01:16:37,050
So they gave a gift card to like some electronics store.

1587
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,489
It was like 500 bucks.

1588
01:16:38,489 --> 01:16:38,970
They did?

1589
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:44,250
And I bought a $500 TV and I still have it and it's really it's really aging.

1590
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:45,850
Where's my $500 gift card?

1591
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:47,529
That is really weird that they did too.

1592
01:16:47,529 --> 01:16:49,369
Thinking back and I was like wow that what?

1593
01:16:49,369 --> 01:16:52,920
I didn't get a $500 gift card to go get a new cool TV.

1594
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:59,069
Yeah well all right well I don't know what to say.

1595
01:16:59,069 --> 01:17:03,050
Well what's the next video game you want to play?

1596
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:07,210
I think I think I would like to I would like to if you would agree to it.

1597
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:11,130
I would like to get in I would like to do VR with you again because that was a lot of fun

1598
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:12,970
and I have a lot of good memories a lot of fun times

1599
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:14,409
during that VR stream that we did together.

1600
01:17:14,409 --> 01:17:16,729
Would you would you do VR again multiplayer stuff?

1601
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:17,930
Let's do VR.

1602
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:22,600
Are there any VR like Half-Life Alex mods that are multiplayer?

1603
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,670
It might be well if we can look into it.

1604
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:29,069
I feel like I feel like someone and not Valve I wouldn't I wouldn't put this on Valve.

1605
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:30,909
Someone else has to make that.

1606
01:17:30,909 --> 01:17:32,909
Have we even talked since Alex even came out?

1607
01:17:32,909 --> 01:17:36,279
Like have we even like what have we talked about that?

1608
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:37,560
Uh I think so.

1609
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:41,930
Oh Game of the Year was Half-Life Alex right it wasn't Hades it was Half-Life Alex I forgot.

1610
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:45,770
I I bought it when it came out instantly I still have not played it.

1611
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:48,090
You would yeah we definitely have talked about it because

1612
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:50,409
I was talking about it with you and saying how I didn't

1613
01:17:50,409 --> 01:17:52,970
you didn't like how it looked like the game had a lot of downtime

1614
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:54,890
and like puzzles in between shooting.

1615
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:57,439
That part and you were like it sucks but it's all right.

1616
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:00,779
Yeah there's a lot of like just hold the globe

1617
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:03,420
and like turn it awkwardly while you press like four buttons.

1618
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:07,659
Yeah that happens a lot but you got to play that game.

1619
01:18:07,659 --> 01:18:11,500
You have to that's that that game is for all like the tiny little

1620
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,020
like turn the globe puzzles.

1621
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:16,699
They put like there's probably realistically like 50 of those in the game.

1622
01:18:16,699 --> 01:18:18,539
People are saying there are multiplayer mods.

1623
01:18:18,539 --> 01:18:22,600
Is it just of the campaign or I don't know.

1624
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,760
I think it would be pretty funny actually if you backseat at me through Half-Life Alex in VR.

1625
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:31,640
You having played it and me not having you make you make me the uh the

1626
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,239
I turn into Dinklebot.

1627
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:36,590
I just like float around with you and just tell you things.

1628
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:37,149
Yeah.

1629
01:18:37,149 --> 01:18:40,649
So I would just be like experiencing the whole game again without doing anything.

1630
01:18:41,449 --> 01:18:44,399
Well now you can like play I don't know.

1631
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:47,949
I would just have to play the whole game again.

1632
01:18:47,949 --> 01:18:51,159
Well it's your game of the year is that like is that so bad.

1633
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,640
Yeah but I look I listen to me.

1634
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:57,789
I was that one game that we played the one YouTube video the Groundhog Day

1635
01:18:57,789 --> 01:19:01,069
where like I was the cameraman and you were running in every single time.

1636
01:19:03,369 --> 01:19:04,569
Damned of something.

1637
01:19:04,569 --> 01:19:07,050
It was a motorcycle where you were you like Burger Boy.

1638
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:09,130
No there was no motorcycle.

1639
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:10,649
Yeah no it was it was the Pop-Tart joke.

1640
01:19:10,649 --> 01:19:11,930
They're going through the glass.

1641
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:14,010
No that's a totally different game.

1642
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:15,449
No it's not.

1643
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:16,250
Yes it is.

1644
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:19,930
Where I kept what you kept jumping into like frame through the glass.

1645
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:22,170
That was the that was like the you Burger Boy puked on yourself.

1646
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:23,130
That's not what I was talking.

1647
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:27,529
I was talking about the game where I was like the hacker and you were the person in the world.

1648
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:31,949
Like clandestine clandestine clandestine something clandestine.

1649
01:19:31,949 --> 01:19:34,380
Yeah that's the game that was really fun.

1650
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,920
You can clandestine me.

1651
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,020
Don't you think that like Half-Life Alex.

1652
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:44,779
Do you ever just want to go back and like delete all the your old YouTube videos so

1653
01:19:44,779 --> 01:19:47,260
we could like play those like games and do it again on stream.

1654
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:51,930
So they never look we're doing it it's like fun.

1655
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:56,960
Hey you know what uh blood packed if you delete your YouTube channel I'll delete mine.

1656
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:02,590
No that's not happening.

1657
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,590
I'm not deleting my YouTube channel.

1658
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:08,960
And then we'll go back and try and remember our videos and try and remake them

1659
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,159
and then you can watch them at the remastered German.

1660
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:15,520
Holy shit that sounds like a fucking brilliant goddamn idea.

1661
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,279
It actually does.

1662
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:22,170
We we should pick out like three of everybody's favorite videos we've ever done

1663
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:24,250
and try to remake.

1664
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:27,930
Oh yeah that sounds fucking incredible.

1665
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:30,569
And then we'll we'll like we'll premiere them on stream

1666
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:33,979
and see if they're as good as the original.

1667
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:39,310
Yeah I bet we could do that with that damned one.

1668
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:40,510
I can't even remember the name of it.

1669
01:20:42,189 --> 01:20:44,909
Breakfast time with goofus and doofus or something whatever the title was.

1670
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:48,590
You want to try to remaster an old video.

1671
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:51,079
That's actually weird enough to be funny.

1672
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:51,640
Let's do it.

1673
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,520
All right write that down.

1674
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:53,319
We'll we'll we'll get that.

1675
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:54,439
I'm writing that down.

1676
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:57,850
I'll put it right underneath among us.

1677
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,880
All right that's that sounds like fun.

1678
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:01,640
Uh I'm gonna get going.

1679
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:05,819
I don't know if you're sticking around but if you are then are you gonna keep going?

1680
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:11,020
Uh I may play like Guilty Gear until the PC gaming show.

1681
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:11,420
Okay.

1682
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:12,460
But just fill time.

1683
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,659
Well we're just gonna raid you.

1684
01:21:13,659 --> 01:21:19,260
So okay where you'll everyone uh that has hated everything you've said tonight.

1685
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:23,850
Probably won't go but people may have loved what you said today and we'll join you.

1686
01:21:25,449 --> 01:21:26,170
I'm gonna get going.

1687
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:32,430
If if you just fair warning if you send people over here we might I don't know.

1688
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:32,909
I don't know.

1689
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:39,390
I like honestly just like just hang out and be the last time you hang out.

1690
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:43,149
I said this too it's something about being hosted.

1691
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:49,180
The expectation that everyone brings over to you makes me very uncomfortable.

1692
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:51,579
All right so we won't raid you.

1693
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:53,180
We'll we'll say goodbye.

1694
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:54,539
But you have to raid me.

1695
01:21:54,539 --> 01:21:59,579
You said you were like no no no no how about this how about this how about this.

1696
01:21:59,579 --> 01:22:01,800
Right now you're currently live.

1697
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:02,039
Yeah.

1698
01:22:02,039 --> 01:22:05,640
If people would look at them directly I'm directly addressing you.

1699
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,380
If people would like to continue to watch the show with stir this channel.

1700
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,739
He's currently live right now.

1701
01:22:11,739 --> 01:22:17,420
I will we're not we're not going to put the pressure of of 23,000 people right.

1702
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:18,779
Like with just no pressure.

1703
01:22:18,779 --> 01:22:23,899
It's not a number it's the the expectation of content.

1704
01:22:23,899 --> 01:22:24,220
Okay.

1705
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:29,520
Coming from you to me is like I I it doesn't matter how many people there are.

1706
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,199
I know I'm disappointing them all.

1707
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:33,119
All right well then I'm not going to raid you.

1708
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:38,880
I then I'm just you're giving such an extraordinary strange circumstance.

1709
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,800
No no no no no you're giving expectations.

1710
01:22:43,229 --> 01:22:46,189
Life is about overcoming expectations.

1711
01:22:46,189 --> 01:22:48,829
So you have to do it to help me.

1712
01:22:48,829 --> 01:22:55,479
Okay so everybody be aware stir is not going to produce any content apparently.

1713
01:22:55,479 --> 01:22:56,359
But what do you mean content.

1714
01:22:56,359 --> 01:22:59,000
You're watching E3 and just hanging out.

1715
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,359
That is content.

1716
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:02,680
But like that's you're not expected to do anything else.

1717
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,760
You don't have to like do a magic show for everybody.

1718
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,520
But there's no E3 for another hour.

1719
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,159
Am I supposed to be an entertaining person on my own.

1720
01:23:09,159 --> 01:23:12,909
Well all right how about this then I'll just host you in an hour.

1721
01:23:12,909 --> 01:23:14,029
No that's stupid.

1722
01:23:14,029 --> 01:23:15,550
Well what what do you what do you mean.

01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:24,300
Well in an hour like everyone would have already like gone and ate dinner.

01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,060
I'll just sit around the dinner table.

1725
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:26,859

So I'll see you later.

1728
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:33,659
People can stay or they don't stay.

1729
01:23:33,659 --> 01:23:35,180
It doesn't whatever like who cares.

1730
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:38,729
Okay I'm like I'm mentally preparing myself like okay.

1731
01:23:38,729 --> 01:23:41,210
German German viewers coming over German content.

1732
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:43,369
Do I need to put on like a like a funny costume.

1733
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:47,399

Okay all right.

1736
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:51,720
That's the last.

1737
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,039
It's a pleasure.

1738
01:23:54,039 --> 01:23:55,560
I'll talk to you soon.

1739
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,479
Well I want to I actually really do want to do that.

1740
01:23:57,479 --> 01:23:58,920
The remaster an old video.

1741
01:23:59,479 --> 01:24:00,520
Yeah we'll talk about it.

1742
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,159
We'll figure it out.

1743
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:01,880
We'll set a date.

1744
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:02,600
We'll do it.

1745
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,640
All right I'll see you guys.

1746
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:05,960
I'll actually I'm going to say my I'm going to do my outro.

1747
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:06,920
You know you know how it is.

1748
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,380
YouTubers you know what I'm saying.

1749
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:10,300
Yeah you know I'm going to run to the bathroom real quick.

1750
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,699
So people they cannot show up while I'm peeing.

1751
01:24:12,699 --> 01:24:14,539
I will not one day.

1752
01:24:14,539 --> 01:24:15,420
Okay goodbye.

1753
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:17,319
He's gone.

1754
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:19,319
So I will see you guys.

1755
01:24:19,319 --> 01:24:21,640
Thanks for watching the Slime Rancher 2.

1756
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,520
Huge pog moment.

1757
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:24,670
I'm really interested in that.

1758
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:25,869
That's probably the number one thing.

1759
01:24:26,859 --> 01:24:30,060
I'm kind of interested in the nothing else.

1760
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:32,699
I don't think I can't think of anything.

1761
01:24:32,699 --> 01:24:34,859
Slime Rancher 2 looks really fun.

1762
01:24:34,859 --> 01:24:37,340
I also want to say I did say it on Twitter.

1763
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,500
But I mean we're live right now.

1764
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,720
I might as well address it.

1765
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:45,399
I have been who cares right.

1766
01:24:45,399 --> 01:24:50,399
It's been 10 years as of what yesterday day before.

1767
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:52,800
I've been doing this for 10 years.

1768
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,560
I'm a 35 year old man.

1769
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:59,069
Started my YouTube channel June 11th 2011.

1770
01:24:59,069 --> 01:25:00,800
It's been a fucking long time.

1771
01:25:05,149 --> 01:25:10,250
I I do people don't watch TV shows for more than five 10 years.

1772
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:12,729
So it's shocking that 10 years later people still watch.

1773
01:25:13,529 --> 01:25:16,319
It's remarkable to me.

1774
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:17,680
And especially considering that.

1775
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,920
I'm looking at the view count number right now.

1776
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:23,920
People keep coming here.

1777
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,470
And I hope you like the stream.

1778
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:28,989
I don't want to.

1779
01:25:29,869 --> 01:25:31,550
Here's the thing that I don't want to ever have happen.

1780
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:35,529
The more that that number goes up.

1781
01:25:35,529 --> 01:25:39,850
I don't want to have myself be like oh shit.

1782
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:42,109
20,000 30,000 okay.

1783
01:25:42,109 --> 01:25:42,590
What do I do?

1784
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:43,069
I gotta be good.

1785
01:25:43,069 --> 01:25:43,550
I gotta be funny.

1786
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:44,590
Like Star was just saying right.

1787
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,279
I gotta try to keep grounded.

1788
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:50,029
Because the more that I see people come in.

1789
01:25:50,029 --> 01:25:51,229
The more that I want to.

1790
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:53,560
I just want to stay the same.

1791
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,920
I don't want to like do anything different.

1792
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,539
That's something that I'm concerned about.

1793
01:25:58,539 --> 01:26:00,960
Because when you look over and you see that it's just like oh fuck.

1794
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,800
Why are there this many people here?

1795
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:06,010
He's retiring.

1796
01:26:06,010 --> 01:26:06,989
Not yet.

1797
01:26:06,989 --> 01:26:07,630
Not yet.

1798
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:08,430
Not yet.

1799
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:09,149
Relax.

1800
01:26:09,149 --> 01:26:11,600
Not yet.

1801
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,479
Yeah.

1802
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:14,640
Thanks for uh thanks for sticking with this channel for this long.

1803
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,920
It's been a very long time and I'm surprised every day.

1804
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,319
We'll see how much further it goes.

1805
01:26:21,319 --> 01:26:23,640
We'll see how how it does right.

1806
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,920
I don't have any expectations.

1807
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:25,479
I never did.

1808
01:26:26,039 --> 01:26:27,319
So I'm just going to keep going.

1809
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:29,789
Thanks a lot.

1810
01:26:29,789 --> 01:26:36,939
Hope I can continue to do the things you want to see.

1811
01:26:36,939 --> 01:26:37,500
I watch.

1812
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:37,979
I watch.

1813
01:26:37,979 --> 01:26:38,380
I watch.

1814
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:39,470
Thank you.

1815
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:40,829
So uh very important though.

1816
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:46,970
Tomorrow I am going to be live on Ms. Kip's channel.

1817
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,090
I'm going to be on OTK Schooled.

1818
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:52,880
I'm going to be a contestant on that stream.

1819
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:58,199
So if you want to see me tomorrow uh potentially embarrass myself completely.

1820
01:26:58,199 --> 01:27:03,720
With uh not being able to answer what like 10 times like 30 is or something.

1821
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:04,600
I've been practicing.

1822
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,640
I'm hoping I can be good.

1823
01:27:06,909 --> 01:27:07,390
I'm ready.

1824
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:08,989
I'm ready.

1825
01:27:08,989 --> 01:27:12,619
That's tomorrow at 1 p.m pacific.

1826
01:27:12,619 --> 01:27:13,979
Ms. Kip's channel.

1827
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:15,960
Two Central.

1828
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,989
One Pacific.

1829
01:27:18,989 --> 01:27:19,869
I have to practice.

1830
01:27:19,869 --> 01:27:21,310
I can't get eliminated in kindergarten.

1831
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:23,949
That would be so awful.

1832
01:27:23,949 --> 01:27:27,949
People make that joke but I can't get eliminated in like the first grade.

1833
01:27:27,949 --> 01:27:29,630
I would never live that down.

1834
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:35,760
I've been panicking about it for the last like four days.

1835
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,039
All right let's raid stir.

1836
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:38,000

1840
01:27:45,579 --> 01:27:49,800
Why do I I can't see it now.

1841
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:50,439
Where'd it go?

1842
01:27:50,439 --> 01:27:57,260
Oh my stream's been playing the whole time in the background.

1843
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:58,859
Good thank god it's muted.

1844

Uh but yeah I'll be there at 1 p.m pacific.

1847
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:13,390
I just don't want to be the first person to get eliminated.

1848
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:17,149
I really hope that like everybody's like as stupid as I could be.

1849
01:28:17,149 --> 01:28:18,109
You know what I mean?

1850
01:28:18,109 --> 01:28:20,430
I don't want to be the first person out.

1851
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:26,829
All right we had a lot of subs.

Well that was a very interesting stream.

There's a lot of um it's always interesting when stirs around uh for better or for worse.

1862
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:57,680
As you have probably come to see over the last three and a half hours.
