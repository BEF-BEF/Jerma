1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,250
How you doing? What's happening?

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,689
I cleared my throat right before talking to you, and that's the worst.

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,160
You know anything you're just ready to talk?

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,260
This happens sometimes when I answer a phone call too.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,800
Milk voice? Did you say milk voice? What the hell? That's weird.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,420
I know exactly what that means. I don't even like drink milk anymore. I don't even like milk.

7
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:31,739
That is weird.

8
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,060
All right. Anyways, right before you answer a phone call, you go...

9
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,780
Don't ring me for salt. Don't ring me for salt.

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,460
Hello? And then you answer and say that.

11
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,460
You get like prepared, and then you answer the phone call.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,780
But after that, it sucks when you do all that.

13
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,820
So your phone starts ringing, and you go...

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,140
You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this.

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,739
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:08,540
Hello? Hello?

17
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,459
I hate it. It's the worst.

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,359
Next game? What?

19
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:18,859
What?

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,140
I'm just fucking around. Why does everybody take everything I say so seriously?

21
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:35,209
You know what I mean? Why are you so serious, Batman?

22
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,019
I'm fucked up today. I'm in a really weird mood.

23
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:44,500
And I think the reason why I'm in such a weird mood today is because

24
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:52,260
there's a whole hands worth of olives sitting next to me, and I'm gonna put them on my fingers, I guess.

25
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:59,780
As I was buying the olives, and as I was walking around, and as I was getting prepared for the stream,

26
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:05,260
every five to six minutes, I'd say,

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,819
who am I doing this for? It's not for me.

28
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,870
Because I don't care, right? I like don't care about putting olives on my fingers.

29
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:22,500
It's one person said this. One person.

30
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,340
Why do I do this? I don't even... Why do I do this?

31
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,539
I don't care either. I don't know why. I don't know. Yeah, exactly.

32
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:35,460
Does anybody here actually want to see this? I don't think anybody cares.

33
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:42,889
But we're doing it anyways.

34
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:49,849
And I'm not going to do it till there's at least 10,000 people here.

35
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,860
I know. I'm like, what a psycho. An egomaniac.

36
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,930
No, I'm not going to eat olives off my fingers unless there's 10,000 people here watching.

37
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:13,379
Anyways, today, probably saw the title. I'm going to play Thief Gold.

38
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:18,789
Give you a short story here. Thief Gold has been installed.

39
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:20,949
Well, not installed. It's been purchased.

40
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:25,509
And in my, you should stream this list.

41
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:28,629
Uh, for probably three or four years.

42
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,680
Since I was back in Massachusetts, I just kind of looked at it today.

43
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,840
I was like, fine, I'll put it on the poll. Why not?

44
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:46,150
And it won. So, uh, this is the GOG version.

45
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,750
Yes, this is not the Steam version.

46
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:54,620
This is somebody said, do you collect trinkets around your house pretending to be a goblin,

47
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,870
laughing as you throw them into a sack? Why would I do that in my own house?

48
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,879
No, in your house is where you start counting the things you took.

49
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,819
I took the goblet. I took the treasure chest.

50
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,379
I took the gold coins. I don't put them back in the sack.

51
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,219
I count them. Why would I do that?

52
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:21,779
I've already put them in the sack. I took the urinal.

53
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,209
Uh, I took the urinal. Yeah.

54
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:33,500
What a shitty, that, what like, that sucks.

55
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,790
What am I going to do with that? What would I do with that?

56
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:47,160
That's just stupid. You converted it into a fan.

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,379
That thing's nice. In fact, thanks for reminding me.

58
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:57,029
I'm going to turn it on now. I'm turning my rotating urinal on

59
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:05,819
because I want some air. It's got a filtering.

60
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,899
Do you know that? This has got like an air filter

61
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:13,379
baked into this, in the middle and inside of it.

62
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,500
And it sucks air in through the filter and then blows it off the top.

63
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,759
It's actually pretty cool. And there's no, there's no fan on it.

64
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,050
It's a fanless fan. Need an olive on stream.

65
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,209
I'm just, hold on. I just turned it on.

66
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,579
All right. So we're talking, you want like the,

67
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,980
hold on. I got to, I got to go on campus.

68
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,269
But you want, what you want is you want,

69
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:46,069
you talking about like, I get it on my hand and I go like,

70
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:51,019
right? That's what you want. Like one, two, three, four, five, right?

71
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,040
That's what you're looking for. I think that's what you want.

72
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:00,069
Can I even get these on? It's going to be hard.

73
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:07,370
We're moving on real quick from this too, by the way.

74
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,470
This is like, I'm not spending more than a minute on this.

75
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,389
I can't, how am I supposed to do it on both hands?

76
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:21,110
I just broke one. Fucking hit the goddamn ground

77
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,870
and it's your fault. You did this to me.

78
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,839
All right. Look, my fingers.

79
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,939
I, it hit the ground. I can't, these ones have like pimento in them.

80
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:42,949
I can't put these on my finger. I mean, I can.

81
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,389
I don't care. Is that the one that hit the ground?

82
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,660
I got the wrong olives. I don't know anything about olives.

83
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,100
What do you think I know? Anything about olives?

84
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,540
Why would I know anything about olives?

85
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,060
Why would I know anything about olives?

86
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,560
Why would I know anything about olives?

87
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,100
Hey dude, you got the wrong olives. Oh yeah. Oh, sorry.

88
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,220
There's like fucking 40 cases at the grocery store.

89
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:20,389
I can't get them on all my fingers. You can just Photoshop it.

90
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:26,060
Here, look. I got the wrong olives.

91
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:33,319
Ego, ready? Like, oh, that looks gross.

92
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:40,069
Oh, okay. What is pimento?

93
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:45,509
Your hand's too big or they're too small? I don't know.

94
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,189
They're just olives. I just got like olives.

95
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:50,199
I didn't know. This is this black olives.

96
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,480
This is green olives. Black olives are like cut into rings sometimes.

97
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,920
Is that what you meant? I just bought olives at the grocery store.

98
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:07,620
I don't know. I got one. I got two on my fingers.

99
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:12,839
What the fuck is he doing? I don't, I, you know, and that's exactly why we're done.

100
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:18,949
I just used one of my dog wipes. These are actually dog wipes.

101
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:21,269
I'm not kidding. These are dog grooming wipes.

102
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:31,850
Like, wipe on his paws. No deal? I didn't even make a deal.

103
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,529
I don't even care if I don't have, what do you mean deal?

104
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:40,120
I don't care. I was just like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to put them on.

105
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,960
You got scammed? There was no scam. There's no deal.

106
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,120
I just, somebody said, put olives on your fingers and go like,

107
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,080
hoo hoo hoo at the screen. And I was like, okay, I guess I'll do it. Why?

108
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:59,379
Put an olive on each nostril. No, because that's fucking weird.

109
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,460
That's like, I don't know. I don't, no, not happening.

110
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,789
I don't even like olives. I like olive oil, but like olives are like a little too acidic.

111
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:13,990
You considered it? I did because it's stupid.

112
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,830
And, but like that's childish, right? It's childish.

113
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:24,059
It's, it's childish. It's what it is. It's, it's, it's like, oh, look at it.

114
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,419
It's like I got olives in my nose.

115
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:31,750
Clowns don't even do that at children's birthday parties.

116
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,950
Nobody should ever do that. No one should ever do something like that.

117
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,779
Sneeze out the olives. Yeah, that's just weird.

118
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,620
Why would somebody, why would anybody do that?

119
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:47,419
Anyways, we're going to play, there you go.

120
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:50,059
The one, for the one person that said put olives on your fingers and eat them.

121
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:59,690
I don't know what that was for, but there, yeah, I got the wrong olives.

122
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,659
A scam? I mean, maybe I'll put it on for a little bit,

123
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:04,340
but I got to move it though. It's in the wrong spot.

124
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:07,669
Actually, well, who cares? Doesn't matter.

125
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:11,460
Because I can crop it, but we're going to play thief.

126
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,480
Drop this here. That looks all right.

127
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:27,480
I don't, you know what? I don't like forward-facing face cam.

128
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,840
I feel like I'm in like an interview with you, right?

129
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,940
Oh, I feel like you're inside the monitor and it's weird.

130
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,220
I like an angle because it's like you're, you're like over here.

131
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,179
You're not just like literally staring in my eyes like here.

132
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:42,019
I don't know. I don't like forward-facing webcam.

133
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:46,360
All right. Well, whatever. We're going to move this out of the way.

134
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,379
I'm going to, let me just move the camera in case I want to use it for any reason.

135
00:10:52,379 --> 00:11:00,809
I'm going to play thief, thief gold. It's the GOG version.

136
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:04,090
I don't know anything about this game. No, nothing at all.

137
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,009
Move the pair of underwear that's on the ground over here.

138
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:19,580
So you don't see it. I don't want you to see the underwear that I have on the ground.

139
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,649
Don't worry about it. Close my door.

140
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,820
All right. Let's go.

141
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,080
Why is there underwear in your office? I don't know.

142
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:36,220
Because I was probably like doing laundry or something.

143
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:46,460
All right. Is it in a good spot? Tell me. Not really.

144
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,940
Oh, should I have a ring light? I can turn, no, it hurts my eyes.

145
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,580
I don't want to use it. All right.

146
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,820
We got pretty much everybody's here. We can get going.

147
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,360
Thief gold. Make sure I'm comfortable.

148
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,759
I need to, no, you know what? I got to get, these olives are going to smell

149
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,440
and it's going to make me fucking gag.

150
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:10,840
Put the ring light around your neck.

151
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:17,639
If I put the ring light around my neck, I, it could actually fit.

152
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,440
That would be fucking stupid.

153
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,259
Oh, don't, don't stall this stream any more than it has to be.

154
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:28,580
Please let me just play thief.

155
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,679
That's so stupid. I think my, no, what if I get stuck?

156
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,360
What if I get stuck and I have to like go get it, go until I get it removed?

157
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,669
What if I get stuck? No, I might get stuck.

158
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:44,070
I think I could get it in there, but what if I, what if I can't get it out?

159
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,190
If I get stuck, I'm 36. Okay.

160
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,190
I can't make those mistakes anymore.

161
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:57,539
I can't put my head in a ring light and blame it on like, like, oh man, you know,

162
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:01,299
I, it's just, I was in college and we were drinking Bud Light and I was like,

163
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,860
yeah, you know, give me the ring light. I'll put it, I'm 36.

164
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,870
I'm an older man now. I can't do that.

165
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,669
I can't go to like the emergency room and like blame it on like the fucking Bud Reds

166
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:14,789
we were all drinking, like having a fun, just hanging out and like put it around.

167
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:21,110
No, no, no, I could, that's dangerous.

168
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,789
Just tell the nurse that you're famous.

169
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:26,299
What, who cares?

170
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:30,059
Oh yeah, see, I'm famous. That's why I put a ring light around my head and got stuck.

171
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,259
What does that, what does that have to do with anything?

172
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,299
Like the idiocy is still just the same as if I had one viewer or 10,000.

173
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:43,340
All right, let's go.

174
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:50,070
I'm imagining the drunk guy that just comes in.

175
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:54,809
Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I'm famous by the way.

176
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:55,450
Famous where?

177
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:57,860
Get out of my college dorm room.

178
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:02,230
It's the same. It's the same exact argument.

179
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:08,139
Yeah, they call, they call me fucking crazy, crazy Bill, pretty famous.

180
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,539
No, I'm not doing it. Maybe I'll see if I can put my head in there.

181
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:20,039
Not today though. On the next stream, if it's safe, I'll do it.

182
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,460
All right, turn this shit off.

183
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,759
All right, we're going to play thief.

184
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,500
Are you ready?

185
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:34,779
Oh, I'm famous.

186
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,559
Well, then you should, you should probably know better.

187
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,870
Like what you, you hold on.

188
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,070
You're telling me that you showed an audience of like 15,000 people.

189
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:46,539
Ha ha ha, look how funny it is.

190
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:47,980
I just got my head stuck in a light.

191
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,299
You should be way more responsible.

192
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:53,879
What are you talking about?

193
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:54,759
All right, we're gonna play thief.

194
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,100
I'll do face cam eventually, maybe in like 10 minutes.

195
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:03,929
How hard is this game? Is this game hard?

196
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,769
Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth.

197
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,480
Is this a hard game?

198
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Yeah, if chat is good, I'll turn the face cam on.

199
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:17,690
Only if you're good though.

200
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,370
And you, I, I knew, and you better prove it.

201
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:21,990
Start training normal heart.

202
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,029
Not playing this on export.

203
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:24,070
I'm not playing it on hard either.

204
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,990
Not happening.

205
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,950
My arms are too high.

206
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:28,759
What's going on here?

207
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,379
I don't know. I need to be.

208
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:34,980
There we go.

209
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,120
I'm going to be higher than chair.

210
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,490
There it is. Okay.

211
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,610
All right, start training.

212
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,250
I don't know how to play.

213
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:43,539
I'm playing on normal.

214
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:44,500
I'm not playing on hard.

215
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:49,509
It's a boomer stealth game.

216
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh God, the essence of balance is detachment.

217
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,820
To embrace a cause to grow fond or spiteful is to lose one's balance.

218
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:07,269
After which no action can be trusted.

219
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:13,500
A burden is not for the dependent of spirit.

220
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:18,059
I'm Maillard, third keeper.

221
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,580
I was a kid.

222
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:22,419
No parents, no home.

223
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,899
Running messages and picking pockets to keep my ribs from meeting my spine.

224
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,059
One night I saw a man.

225
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,340
Folks just passed him by like he wasn't there.

226
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:34,100
I thought he must have something valuable.

227
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,179
So I snuck up on him and made a grab.

228
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,659
That's not for you.

229
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:43,820
Please sir, I'm hungry.

230
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,779
Don't tell the hammers.

231
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:45,419
I promise.

232
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:47,100
What is your name, boy?

233
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:48,700
Garrett.

234
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,539
You have talent lad.

235
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:52,460
Let go of me old man.

236
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,539
To see a keeper is not an easy thing.

237
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,899
Especially one who does not wish to be seen.

238
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,580
We have a need for those as gifted as yourself.

239
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,259
If you've grown tired of how you live then follow me and we will show you a different way.

240
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,940
It's worth paying for a young actor to do this.

241
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,980
I caught up with him just before he vanished into the crowd.

242
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,259
It was the beginning of a very long education.

243
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:19,019
This is always the problem I have with audiobooks too.

244
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,619
I like I don't reading I don't reading is fine, right?

245
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,779
You can kind of make up your own voices and stuff.

246
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:30,759
But anytime you listen to an audiobook and the it's usually just one person

247
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:35,000
who reads the whole book and they'll typically do voices for everybody.

248
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,180
And it's usually like if they get to like a young character

249
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,940
or a higher character with a much higher pitched voice that they think.

250
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,299
And when they have a conversation with themselves it's always funny.

251
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,940
It's like I didn't want to do that.

252
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,140
I didn't want to go there.

253
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,700
Well you you had to at school is very important.

254
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,019
As she said leaning down it's always kind of feels off somehow.

255
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,210
But that can almost add to the charm in a way.

256
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:08,220
But I like to make up my own voices in my head when they when they do it.

257
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,019
That's literally you.

258
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,759
That's what I'm saying.

259
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:13,160
All right normal follow the directions of your instructor

260
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,759
in order to pass the training tests.

261
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,839
I use your last chance to make it not normie.

262
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:27,029
Instruct you in the various skills you will need to survive.

263
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,829
Please stay in the entrance area to each room while I explain the room's purpose.

264
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:35,990
When you are ready to begin your lessons proceed down this hallway to the first room.

265
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,259
Who's walking?

266
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:39,940
What if I'm not ready?

267
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,670
Are those health?

268
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:46,549
Why do I have like little health icons?

269
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:48,230
Um hold on a minute.

270
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,029
This is freaking me out.

271
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,829
What are these controls?

272
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,690
Wait wait wait wait what's happening?

273
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,170

Okay A and S is not strafe.

W and W is walk forward.

277
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:05,220

278
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,480
Holding S walks me forward.

279
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:11,880
It's tank controls?

280
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,440
No it's not.

281
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,380
I need to rebind the keys.

282
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,789

00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:51,509
Control jump slash block keyboard insert.

337
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,690
Gamma gamma rays.

338
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,940
Gamma plus lean forward W alt shift quick save.

339
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,200
All right we know what quick save is.

340
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,559
Take a screenshot.

341
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,200
Increase main volume decrease volume.

342
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,109
I'm just gonna play.

343
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:16,950
Okay at least like the basic controls are fine.

344
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:23,180
You must learn.

345
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,140
Okay I'll just see.

346
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,940
The indicator on your screen will tell you how visible you are.

347
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,670
Reach the top of the platform scene.

348
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,029
Okay top of the platform.

349
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,990
Where's the top of the platform?

350
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,269
So just don't be seen by this guy.

351
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:38,150
I see you there lad.

352
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,430
He's literally facing the other way.

353
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,269
What his head is facing the door.

354
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,099
I see you then.

355
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:44,980
He's not even looking this way.

356
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,779
He's looking at the door.

357
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:53,529
He's literally facing the other direction.

358
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:58,220
But just because I'm in the shade he can't see me.

359
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,190
Oh he's not he's looking this way.

360
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,789
All right so get to the top of the platform.

361
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:05,829
So I gotta get behind him.

362
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,700
Well done.

363
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:11,619
I did not see you approach.

364
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:13,859
Open this door to continue.

365
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:14,099
What?

366
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:17,380
When the door is near the center of your screen it will light up.

367
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,299
Indicating that it is selected.

368
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:19,619
Okay.

369
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:22,980
To manipulate selected doors and other objects use them.

370
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:25,960
That's bad.

371
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,160
Mouse three to use.

372
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,119
What a dumb idea.

373
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,079
Proceed down this corridor for your next test.

374
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:31,880
Are you sprint?

375
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,240
You can check your map at any time.

376
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,019
Does the show where?

377
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,460
Oh no please.

378
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,339
No no no no no.

379
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,490
It doesn't give you like a you are here in the mall.

380
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,009
Oh this is bad.

381
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:42,890
I guess I'm right here.

382
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:49,430
You must learn to move.

383
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,930
Some surfaces are louder than others when walked upon.

384
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,410
And moving quickly makes more noise than moving slowly.

385
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,769
Okay don't walk on like the glass.

386
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:58,569
Listen to your own footsteps to hear how much noise you are making.

387
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:00,970
The instructor will have his back turn.

388
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,410
You must get to the top of the platform without being heard.

389
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,849
Isn't he the instructor?

390
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,390
All right so just don't step on that.

391
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,269
That probably makes noise.

392
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:16,730
Do you didn't hear me?

393
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,720
Very good.

394
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,119
I did not hear you traverse the room.

395
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,279
Grab him by his top of his head and bottom of his head and just twist.

396
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,880
That will lead you to your next task.

397
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:40,660
What?

398
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,859
They're gonna teach me how to kill people like whoa.

399
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:48,339
To pick up objects select them by centering them on screen until they light up.

400
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,299
I got a weapon.

401
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:49,779
Then use them.

402
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,299
Choose your weapon now.

403
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,380
Try readying your sword and then your bow.

404
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,019
You can hold.

405
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:56,339
You can always put them away again if you need your hands free.

406
00:24:57,859 --> 00:24:58,819
I feel like I'm in VR.

407
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,539
This is a VR moment.

408
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:03,049
Where is he?

409
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:04,329
I can't get him.

410
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,849
Oh he's over here.

411
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,210
Ow!

412
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,250
He didn't make the noise but you know.

413
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:12,200
Ready your bow.

414
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:16,119
Knock an arrow and draw back the string by holding down the attack button.

415
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,480
Make sure you draw all the way back or your shot will not have full power.

416
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:20,680
Take aim.

417
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:20,920
Nice.

418
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,559
When you are ready to shoot release your attack.

419
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,400
See if you can hit one of these targets.

420
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,160
That mouse sensitivity drops a lot.

421
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,750
Did I miss every shot?

422
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,309
What?

423
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:35,349
Wait a minute.

424
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:39,859
Did I miss every shot?

425
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:48,500
What's happening?

426
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,059
Turn around.

427
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,329
Oh good shot.

428
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:55,529
Keep practicing if you wish.

429
00:25:55,529 --> 00:26:03,400
When you are ready to proceed approach the training dummy and ready your sword.

430
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,960
Head shot.

431
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,170
Ready your sword.

432
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,500
Swing at the target with the attack button.

433
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,579
A quick tap will give you a slash.

434
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:19,420
Move the tip of your sword to the left of the target for a left slash and to the right

435
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,859
of the target for a right slash.

436
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:22,059
Nice.

437
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,539
Then release for an overhead swing.

438
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,940
Try both slashes and the overhead swing on the practice dummy.

439
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,339
You can tell how good you're doing based on the cartoon sound effects.

440
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,539
Ready for a live opponent.

441
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:33,990
Practice against your partner.

442
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,869
Enter the cobbled sparring area.

443
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:39,910
The more it sounds like Scooby Doo the better you know you're doing.

444
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,380
You want to go?

445
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,819
Wait is this the trainer?

446
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:50,519
Hack him with your sword.

447
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,240
Wait did I just get disqualified?

448
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:01,430
His ears are ringing right now.

449
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,140
Oh I can block right?

450
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:07,339
Yep.

451
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:18,259
Oh we're not actually fighting.

452
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,069
It's right in the teeth.

453
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:22,710
Alright let's go.

454
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,240
Leave me alone.

455
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,680
That's enough sparring for today.

456
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,559
Well he's following me.

457
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,759
Let's walk over to the table.

458
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:29,960
He's literally following me.

459
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,599
Get away from me.

460
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,380
That was just like the me and my little brother were in a little bit of a fight

461
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,180
before we came to dinner and we just got called to dinner and I was like

462
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,980
I gotta get one more.

463
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,700
Coming mom.

464
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:54,309
Shut up idiot.

465
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:56,279
Okay so now what?

466
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,640
Why are you following me around?

467
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,299
How do we open this?

468
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:00,779
Open this.

469
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,339
Open the door.

470
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:08,839
Go to the table?

471
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:18,809
What table?

472
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:23,990
Would you care for some refreshment before you move on young Garret?

473
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:24,970
Apple.

474
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,130
Please pick up all of the items on this table.

475
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,650
Cycle through your inventory to see the objects you have in your pocket.

476
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,210
Apple.

477
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:31,930
Compass.

478
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,769
Once an object is displayed you may use it.

479
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:34,410
Healing potion.

480
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:34,569
Alright.

481
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:36,009
Have something to eat if you wish.

482
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:37,289
Then you may proceed.

483
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:40,490
The next test is waiting on the other side of the metal door.

484
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:40,809
Okay.

485
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:43,130
I have a compass too.

486
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:46,150
How do I use it?

487
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:46,869
Oh it's just up.

488
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,549
The door is locked.

489
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:50,309
But the key from the table will open it.

490
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:53,109
To unlock the door select the key in your inventory.

491
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:55,670
Center the door on screen until it lights up.

492
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,109
Then use the key on the door.

493
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:57,430
Good.

494
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,230
Now head down this hallway to get to your next test.

495
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,029
What's the next test?

496
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,089
Apples are nice.

497
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:06,410
Well only one kind of apple is worth eating in my opinion.

498
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:06,890
Well two.

499
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,539
Green or Macintosh.

500
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:11,579
The rest are dog shit.

501
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:14,859
First climb the rope by jumping onto it.

502
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,940
Move while looking up or down to climb up or down the rope.

503
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,660
So you can look up?

504
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,220
Turn to change your places.

505
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,420
Okay it's not S.

506
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,660
If you jump again you will release the rope.

507
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,059
Now climb the rope to get to the top of the platform.

508
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:26,700
Well done.

509
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,420
Run and jump across the gap to the other side of the stream.

510
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,180
I feel like I'm not running fast enough.

511
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,220
Is this how fast I can go?

512
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,539
Good jump.

513
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,619
This obstacle is easy to climb if you know how.

514
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:39,140
First move close to the wall.

515
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:43,299
Next jump to grab the edge of the wall and pull yourself up.

516
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:44,180
Good job.

517
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,099
I am most pleased with your progress.

518
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,019
I just breathed on it.

519
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:48,579
All right.

520
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:51,299
If you wish you may stay to practice your climbing and jumping.

521
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,779
Or swimming, ducking, leaning or crawling.

522
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:55,140
Okay this ball damaged.

523
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,940
You may return to your chambers by going through that red door.

524
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,240
Farewell.

525
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:01,420
Okay so it's jump.

526
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,430
Let go.

527
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:07,910
All right let's do it.

528
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:15,430
The keepers were training me to be one of them.

529
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:17,269
Mushroom.

530
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:18,309
Other uses for those.

531
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:19,349
Oh shit mushroom.

532
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:19,670
Eat it.

533
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,579
What is that?

534
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:22,619
What happened?

535
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:26,549
Wait what what wait no I wanted to explore.

536
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:39,400
All right so now I'm an expert thief.

537
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:48,630
You didn't explore don't need to explore the tutorial.

538
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,390
Well I just wanted to see I was just curious.

539
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:58,329
Where are my parents?

540
00:30:58,329 --> 00:30:59,289
I don't know.

541
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:02,740
The most promising acolyte left us.

542
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:09,720
Not out of the lesser folly of sentiment but the greater folly of anger.

543
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:16,740
His heart was clouded and his balance was lost but his abilities were unmatched.

544
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:22,779
Even then we knew to match watch him most carefully.

545
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,240
Keeper.

546
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,119
Annals.

547
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:33,210
Stealing is wrong.

548
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,890
I have a simple job planned for this evening.

549
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,809
Break into a guarded mansion.

550
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:39,450
Break into a mansion.

551
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,769
Steal another fat nobleman's priceless trinket.

552
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,690
Steal a trinket and leave quietly.

553
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,930
Lord Bafford is out of town and rumor has it that the captain of his house guard went

554
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,369
with him as a bodyguard.

555
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:52,730
The time is ripe for a bit of burglary.

556
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:54,170
All right.

557
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:01,720
The front gate of Lord Bafford's manor is always guarded and the main street is far to expose.

558
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,079
Sounds like the guy in Hitman 3.

559
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:04,519
The constant.

560
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,079
Miss Burnwood.

561
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:28,519
Up floor.

562
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,640
All I need is to give you two bricks.

563
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,660
Give me two bricks.

564
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:38,059
An extra large heel.

565
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:43,130
And a fucking ski mask.

566
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,910
I'll get what you need.

567
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,670
I'll get up there and get that trinket.

568
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:58,859
Sneak into Lord Bafford's manor and case the place.

569
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:04,779
Well house in back is your best bet if you can get the key from the guard.

570
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:07,500
Lackjacking or pickpocketing him would be quietest.

571
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:13,430
Find the prized scepter and redistribute it to yourself.

572
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:18,599
Try to do it without causing too much commotion.

573
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:26,490
All right so I gotta get into the manor.

574
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,319
There's a well house out the back.

575
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:32,839
I can get the key from the guard or just all right I gotta get in there.

576
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:36,299
Starting gear.

577
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:41,430
I got a blackjack, a sword, an archery healing potion, water arrow.

578
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,220
Water arrow does not do any damage but it douses torches and other burning.

579
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,819
Okay that's really important.

580
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:50,140
What is blackjack?

581
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,420
This weapon will knock out an unsuspecting target with little noise and no blood.

582
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:53,980
Oh okay.

583
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:58,039
All right let's go.

584
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:01,460
Where am I?

585
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,619
Watch.

586
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:07,180
Okay watch for interior patrols.

587
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,380
There's the front entrance.

588
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,579
This is heavily guarded.

589
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:11,179
Do not try frontal assault.

590
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:14,900
Arrow cache pickup en route to the second floor.

591
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:16,340
One guard.

592
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:18,980
This well leads to the basement.

593
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,780
Basement entrance.

594
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,260
Okay we're gonna try to go to the basement.

595
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,900
So I gotta go to the right here this way.

596
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,780
I drew this map I hope it helps.

597
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,179
Is it illegal for me to like be right here?

598
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:33,579
No I haven't done anything illegal.

599
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,380
All right I haven't done anything illegal though.

600
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,420
So like it's okay that I.

601
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,239
All right so that's the front door.

602
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,909
Go in the front.

603
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,460
It's three guards.

604
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,219
I don't think let me try let me see if let me go to the well.

605
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:57,059
It's a well out back.

606
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:59,269
There's a cheese factory.

607
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:01,880
I can't go in there.

608
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,639
All right here's the here's the underground well.

609
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,860
You can't fight all these people at once.

610
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,460
I mean I can but it's probably bad.

611
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:17,300
All right where am I at?

612
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,420
There's one guard.

613
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,300
I'm okay here's the well.

614
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,579
That's where I am right now.

615
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:24,920
So there's a guard here.

616
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,719
Basement entrance.

617
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,320
The well leads to the basement waterway.

618
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,440
Basement waterway.

619
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:28,920
I got it.

620
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,960
All right cool.

621
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,260
I have to save the game.

622
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,650
Well that would have been a fucking disaster.

623
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,869
Where's the uh blackjack?

624
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:41,989
All right I can so this thing.

625
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:45,639
Or this thing you just whack somebody's head.

626
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:48,420
All right this will go up to the basement.

627
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,909
Is anybody here?

628
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:57,960
This doesn't look like a basement.

629
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:09,539
What's this way?

630
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:10,980
Oh okay this is where I am right now.

631
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,340
So I'm underground.

632
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:12,900
Keep going.

633
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:14,739
Thank god it tells you where you are.

634
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,440
Okay basement.

635
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:34,489
There's a door.

636
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,179
Oh shit hold on.

637
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,489
God damn it give me a break.

638
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,599
Can I get in this door?

639
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,139
All right stealth stealth stealth stealth stealth.

640
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,090
Somebody's coming somebody's coming.

641
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:58,119
Water water water water arrows water arrows.

642
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:01,179
Oh shit.

643
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:08,789
How many times do I have to shoot somebody in the head before they die?

644
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:13,289
What how do I move the body?

645
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,340
Oh my god all right dump them.

646
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,059
Dump them down here.

647
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:31,030
Okay I gotta get rid of the blood.

648
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:37,769
All right that's one guard.

649
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:39,500
All right save it.

650
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:49,719
F11 what's that?

651
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,920
What I can't go in here.

652
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,860
This I can't open this door.

653
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,300
I thought this is a place into the mansion.

654
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:57,780
Wait a minute.

655
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,420
I need to figure out how do I put the other arrows on.

656
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,730
How do I do it?

657
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,690
Who's in the options?

658
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:11,079
Okay water at four.

659
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,280
So I just have it up four.

660
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,320
There we go.

661
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,760
All right so what if I if I do this.

662
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,659
I just need to test this and see what happens.

663
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:19,510
I didn't do anything.

664
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:33,079
What what the?

665
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,519
No no I want to get points.

666
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,380
This guy's drunk.

667
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,059
All right wait what do I do about this guy?

668
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:44,420
Can you see me?

669
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,619
This is not very stealthy.

670
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:01,340
Where's he going?

671
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,809
Oh he's got the key.

672
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:07,449
He's got the key.

673
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:17,900
All right all right dump him.

674
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,460
All right I got it.

675
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,179
Did I take the key?

676
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:22,699
Close it.

677
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:23,820
Okay I was never here.

678
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,159
I got the key right?

679
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:28,920
Yep nice.

680
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,880
Hold down.

681
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,480
Yeah I can do like a big swing.

682
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,190
Can I take the beer?

683
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,670
I can.

684
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,469
Oh it's a bottle.

685
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:38,389
Don't do that.

686
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:39,030
I was trying to drink it.

687
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,510
I was trying to drink it.

688
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,150
I was trying to drink it.

689
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,349
Oh my goodness slow down.

690
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:45,849
I can't just pick it up.

691
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:53,929
How do I just okay drop.

692
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:55,690
That's so loud.

693
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,929
I think I'm in.

694
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:00,489
Oh here's the well.

695
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:01,929
All right let's bring this with us.

696
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:10,539
There's the well.

697
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:13,900
That was a tuber reaction.

698
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,159
It was genuine though.

699
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:18,679
All right so I have to go down the well.

700
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,369
Am I gonna get hurt?

701
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:31,610
All right so now I'm underneath the estate right?

702
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,650
This is all pre-recorded.

703
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:38,170
Now I'm just sitting back with my legs up on the desk.

704
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,690
My arms behind my head just relaxing while I watch this with you.

705
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:45,929
All right where am I at?

706
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:47,530
Basement is coming up here.

707
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:51,380
What's that?

708
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,280
Secret.

709
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:06,179
I don't know where I'm gonna end up.

710
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:07,699
Oh my god what is that thing?

711
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,619
Wait is this is that attack?

712
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:10,820
Is this evil?

713
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,460
Are these evil?

714
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:12,659
Do these attack?

715
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:17,380
I feel like do these attack?

716
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,579
I'm kind of I hate this.

717
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:25,400
Get out of the water.

718
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:28,199
Grab the edge and get out of the water.

719
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,480
Get out of the water.

720
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,199
Get out of the water.

721
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:34,730
Oh get back in the water get back in the water get back in the water back in the water.

722
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,659
All right I got it I got it.

723
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:51,300
I got one.

724
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,440
This is how I actually treat when there's a spider in the house.

725
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,670
Oh there's a chest over here.

726
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:12,579
Since I'm in here I'm gonna pick up something for myself.

727
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:13,380
There's nothing in here.

728
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:18,710
Waste of time.

729
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:23,989
What?

730
00:42:27,289 --> 00:42:34,460
Okay well I got gold.

731
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:40,650
Oh swim come on.

732
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:46,889
Do you have a time limit?

733
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:48,329
I don't have a time limit.

734
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:51,780
And that person for a day.

735
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:54,650
Which way do I have to go?

736
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,530
I forget.

737
00:42:55,530 --> 00:43:03,099
Do I have a face cam?

738
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:05,019
Yeah just I'll put it on in a minute.

739
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:09,429
Or maybe I won't.

740
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:10,969
I don't have to have face cam.

741
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:13,210
It's fun to use sometimes but you know whatever.

742
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:21,900
Okay I gotta be careful now.

743
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:24,139
Take out the uh take out the bludgeoner.

744
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:27,210
Wait are these explosive?

745
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:34,360
These are explosive I think.

746
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,119
Inside at last.

747
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:38,780
Are they the blow up?

748
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:44,219
Doesn't look like it.

749
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:53,030
Can I do anything with this stuff?

750
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,780
I'm making so much noise here.

751
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,659
Okay you know what?

752
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:57,940
This is actually good.

753
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,380
Because they're not going to investigate this.

754
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,139
Because they just probably assume a raccoon is in here.

755
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:11,420
All right we're gonna get upstairs.

756
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:25,739
Where are they?

757
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,550
Oops.

758
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:33,699
I was trying to hit him in the face in the box.

759
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:41,980
I can't go anywhere.

760
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:43,369
What?

761
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:48,619
No I just made a problem for myself.

762
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,300
I can't clip through those.

763
00:44:50,300 --> 00:45:01,750
Go investigate that.

764
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,500
Wait opportunity.

765
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,300
I'll get this guy in the head.

766
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,300
I see you there.

767
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:25,719
Die.

768
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,500
Why won't he fight me?

769
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:37,000
Hurry up run.

770
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,170
God damn it.

771
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,130
I knew it was a problem.

772
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:45,530
I have to be off to this guy.

773
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,969
Before he brings the alarm.

774
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:56,920
Fuck come on.

775
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,440
Why is he so much faster than me?

776
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:04,949
I got him.

777
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:09,900
Wait there's so much stuff over here.

778
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,219
Hold on.

779
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:18,840
No I want the apple.

780
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,909
My health is okay.

781
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:24,570
Oh nice all right.

782
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:24,889
Money?

783
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:29,320
I gotta get these guys out of here.

784
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,409
What's that music for?

785
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:36,300
I'm so turned around though I don't even know where I was.

786
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,070
Was that a shovel?

787
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,170
Oh hell yeah.

788
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,500
Wait come here.

789
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:54,739
That means guards are coming?

790
00:46:54,739 --> 00:46:59,159
Put him in the chest.

791
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:04,920
All right where am I?

792
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:16,170
I gotta get up from here.

793
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:16,489
Save.

794
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:17,130
Yeah yeah yeah.

795
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:23,079
This isn't Far Cry dude.

796
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,760
I'm not treating it like Far Cry.

797
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,860
I would have gone on the front door.

798
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,900
Goodness okay.

799
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,070
Anybody patrol this?

800
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:43,429
All right slow down.

801
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:43,989
Save.

802
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:51,289
Guys my Wendy's forgot special sauce.

803
00:47:51,289 --> 00:47:52,440
What?

804
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:55,059
Dude that's not cool.

805
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:58,789
What was that?

806
00:47:58,789 --> 00:47:59,190
Vase.

807
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:04,219
I want to hold on to this stuff.

808
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:06,090
I don't just want to throw it.

809
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:06,409
Okay.

810
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,940
What was that?

811
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:13,690
All right where am I now?

812
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:14,889
I'm in here.

813
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,500
Sneak into the manor.

814
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:19,380
Okay.

815
00:48:20,489 --> 00:48:23,530
Steal the scepter with as little notice as possible.

816
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,469
There's another chest there.

817
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:27,269
I couldn't pick it up.

818
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,329
Oh I could.

819
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:31,369
All right cool.

820
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:39,769
All right I just gotta find the way up.

821
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,420
What the hell?

822
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:48,099
Who made that sound?

823
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:55,539
I'll never know.

824
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:56,099
He's just sleeping.

825
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,900
That guy's just sleeping in bed.

826
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,820
I gotta make it look not as bad though.

827
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,110
Okay that's fine.

828
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,150
He's asleep.

829
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,949
Now is this an innocent person?

830
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:13,349
Is this?

831
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,500
Can I loot their bodies?

832
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:26,920
They're all innocent.

833
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:34,099
Who's there?

834
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:35,940
No no no one's here.

835
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,739
Get out of here.

836
00:49:36,739 --> 00:49:37,300
No one's here.

837
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,769
The humming makes that even better.

838
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:52,730
Did you hear something?

839
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:54,170
No.

840
00:49:54,170 --> 00:50:03,349
I think we're almost there.

841
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:04,389
Yep let's go.

842
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:10,500
I think we're in.

843
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:14,460
Yeah we're in.

844
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,199
This is up.

845
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:17,719
We gotta get to the second floor.

846
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:20,710
Take out the bludgeoner.

847
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:25,030
Excuse me?

848
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,110
Is it like Resident Evil?

849
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,389
Can you like close the zombie out?

850
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:53,000
Shit.

851
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:03,579
No.

852
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,219
God damn it.

853
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:14,039
I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine.

854
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:14,519
Everything's fine.

855
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:15,000
Everything's fine.

856
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,440
Everything's fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine.

857
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,079
I gotta dump him.

858
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:23,510
You have no choice.

859
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:24,150
You must kill.

860
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:26,820
Well I need to put him somewhere.

861
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,260
Wait where am I?

862
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:37,289
What's happening?

863
00:51:37,289 --> 00:51:37,849
I hear somebody.

864
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,670
Nice.

865
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:54,070
All right.

866
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:54,869
We're good we're good we're good.

867
00:51:55,429 --> 00:52:04,409
How long do they stay unconscious for?

868
00:52:04,409 --> 00:52:09,179
Oh god.

869
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:11,300
Is there a torch in here?

870
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:17,940
Mushroom.

871
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:34,699
Where are they?

872
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:37,699
Oh god.

873
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:40,550
Where are they?

874
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:43,130
Why are they getting closer?

875
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:53,030
Is it dark right here?

876
00:52:53,030 --> 00:53:04,809
Where is this person?

877
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:16,840
We gotta get to the second floor.

878
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:25,059
Yaron made me smile?

879
00:53:25,059 --> 00:53:27,769
Oh all right.

880
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:29,239
What did I do?

881
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:35,849
Oh god.

882
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:36,730
Okay this looks...

883
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:42,840
Is this like the kitchen?

884
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,630
All right this is the kitchen.

885
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:47,349
There's the chef.

886
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,690
What's he making?

887
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,889
The chef is making a delicious meal of apples.

888
00:53:52,889 --> 00:53:56,070
I gotta knock you out man.

889
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:56,389
I'm sorry.

890
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:58,869
What was that?

891
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:05,750
I hit the chandelier.

892
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,699
Oh give me all these crunchies.

893
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:12,900
I didn't kill him.

894
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:17,750
I'm not gonna be a weirdo.

895
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,610
I'm gonna put him in a place where he's gonna be.

896
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:20,730
He's gonna wake up in a few hours

897
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:21,929
and it's gonna be fine.

898
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:25,539
I'm gonna hide him over here.

899
00:54:25,539 --> 00:54:33,500
There's a note right here.

900
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,460
What does it say?

901
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,820
Cedric please speak to Cook about last night's dinner.

902
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,619
While technically the menu conformed to my instructions

903
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:45,059
I suspect that the lamb was somewhat older than this spring.

904
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:48,179
And I am in no way fooled by his practice of

905
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:51,780
warming the salad to disguise wilting.

906
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:55,139
If Cook is incapable of finding adequate ingredients

907
00:54:55,139 --> 00:54:56,599
he can be replaced.

908
00:54:56,599 --> 00:54:58,679
And if he offers those same excuses

909
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:01,079
about the stone market shortages

910
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:02,920
please remind him that the grocery budget

911
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,559
is a good 50% above last year's figures.

912
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:07,559
And even he should be able to procure

913
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:10,760
adequate victuals at those prices.

914
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:17,929
Oh we have his bread.

915
00:55:17,929 --> 00:55:20,309
Oh carrots.

916
00:55:20,309 --> 00:55:20,949
Bread.

917
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:22,730
A little mallet.

918
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:30,309
Leesies.

919
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:33,659
Ooh a pan.

920
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:34,219
More cheese.

921
00:55:35,659 --> 00:55:39,320
I should probably eat some of this stuff.

922
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,280
Does this heal?

923
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,730
I don't see it.

924
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:43,610
This doesn't heal.

925
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:50,389
Hope you're having fun.

926
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,190
I'm having fun.

927
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,699
Oh I can't alt tab this game.

928
00:55:54,699 --> 00:55:55,340
Let me see.

929
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:05,349
I got it on my phone.

930
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:24,949
What the fuck is alt-ish man?

931
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:34,869
I'm not even gonna react to this.

932
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:36,070
I'm not even gonna react to it.

933
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:39,820
That's it.

934
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:40,619
I'm gonna play Thief.

935
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:48,860
I was playing Thief.

936
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:49,820
I'm just playing a game of Thief.

937
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:50,300
That's it.

938
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,269
That's it.

939
00:56:51,269 --> 00:56:51,989
I'm gonna keep going.

940
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:57,820
What was that?

941
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:03,219
Please, I just browsed it for a second, all right?

942
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,420
I saw it.

943
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,380
Why I saw it?

944
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:14,679
All right, where am I now?

945
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:17,989
All right, I gotta get up here into the interior courtyard.

946
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:27,480
Is it like a secret door?

947
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,280
Oh nothing.

948
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:35,940
I thought these were coffins.

949
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,860
All right, I gotta get upstairs.

950
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:45,510
What is all this?

951
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:48,360
Are you mad at us?

952
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,940
Mad at you?

953
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,199
Whoa, I just stole a bunch of stuff.

954
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:58,090
Okay, cool.

955
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:58,650
Hey.

956
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:26,619
Whoa, how did I turn around though?

957
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:29,449
My neck just enlarged.

958
00:58:29,449 --> 00:58:32,010
My neck just stretched like 13 feet.

959
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:43,030
Stop it once and-

960
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:43,750
Shit, shit.

961
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:44,309
I'm dead.

962
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:54,840
How do we load?

963
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,340
F12.

964
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,519
What?

965
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:03,719
What are you talking about?

966
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:04,199
What?

967
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:05,079
What are you talking about?

968
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:06,519
What are you talking about?

969
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:07,079
What?

970
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:08,659
I don't understand.

971
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:10,010
Wasn't I saving it?

972
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:15,559
Okay, what?

973
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:17,880
I was gonna say that was like 30 minutes of progress.

974
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:29,780
All right, I can't mess around.

975
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,670
This is where I was.

976
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:33,860
Get out of the way.

977
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,380
I gotta get up the stairs.

978
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:41,619
Steal some of this stuff.

979
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:44,809
All right, slow down.

980
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:46,969
Use your sword on the banners to cut them.

981
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:56,940
I gotta be careful.

982
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:57,900
You can see me?

983
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,130
Stay out of the light.

984
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,500
All right, headshot this guy with a bow and arrow.

985
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:11,539
God damn it.

986
01:00:11,539 --> 01:00:24,570
I need to throw something up there.

987
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:27,619
Stay in the dark.

988
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:29,610
Strange.

989
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:30,730
Whoa, that guy saw me.

990
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:32,250
Shit.

991
01:00:33,289 --> 01:00:34,250
Oh, shit.

992
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:34,650
Oh, shit.

993
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:35,610
What if I just stay hidden?

994
01:00:36,489 --> 01:00:47,000
Where is he?

995
01:00:56,730 --> 01:01:02,619
Why would you still be using your bow?

996
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:03,579
Just duck.

997
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:11,880
Come under the stairs.

998
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,920
All right, here's the second floor right here.

999
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,880
We got it.

1000
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,519
Oh, they're coming in.

1001
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:27,429
Oh, shit.

1002
01:01:27,429 --> 01:01:37,590
Get him out of the light.

1003
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:45,449
I think I'm okay.

1004
01:01:45,449 --> 01:01:46,570
I think I can go up the stairs now.

1005
01:01:46,570 --> 01:02:02,900
Where am I now?

1006
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,969
All right.

1007
01:02:04,969 --> 01:02:06,010
Where is this guy?

1008
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:13,179
I'm almost in his quarters.

1009
01:02:13,179 --> 01:02:14,059
Minecraft sounds.

1010
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:21,929
These are Minecraft sounds.

1011
01:02:21,929 --> 01:02:23,449
Oh, boy.

1012
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:24,889
Upstairs to the private chambers.

1013
01:02:24,889 --> 01:02:35,849
Bottom of the screen is light level.

1014
01:02:35,849 --> 01:02:38,360
Nobody will see you if it's dark.

1015
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:44,809
Somebody had a lot of good advice there.

1016
01:02:44,809 --> 01:02:50,949
Oh, wait.

1017
01:02:50,949 --> 01:02:51,829
Okay.

1018
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:53,269
You can load preset controls.

1019
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,820
Blackjack only works if they don't know you're there.

1020
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,420
If you pick something up

1021
01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:59,780
and it doesn't go in your inventory,

1022
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:02,329
it's not worth anything.

1023
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:03,530
Expert is not harder.

1024
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:04,489
Just more objectives.

1025
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,210
Oh, okay.

1026
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:08,780
So this only works if you...

1027
01:03:10,139 --> 01:03:11,019
They can't see me.

1028
01:03:11,019 --> 01:03:20,309
But if they don't see me, is it an instant KO?

1029
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:20,550
Yes.

1030
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:21,349
Okay, cool.

1031
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:23,059
There's no...

1032
01:03:23,059 --> 01:03:26,440
It's up here.

1033
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,739
I thought those were guards.

1034
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:33,300
Nothing up here.

1035
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:39,260
It only works with the blackjack.

1036
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:39,500
Okay.

1037
01:03:40,139 --> 01:03:46,039
Oh, we got a goblet here.

1038
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:46,519
Nice.

1039
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:48,679
Does it say how much this stuff was worth at the end?

1040
01:03:48,679 --> 01:04:04,300
I just ate a lot of food.

1041
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:04,860
What does that do?

1042
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:05,900
What does food even do?

1043
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:09,000
All right.

1044
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,199
We got to go up, not down.

1045
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:15,300
Okay.

1046
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,739
I cannot be seen right now.

1047
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:28,860
I'm...

1048
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:29,500
Oh, no, no, no.

1049
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,139
Easy, easy.

1050
01:04:30,139 --> 01:04:32,460
It's probably somebody in the courtyard.

1051
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:40,489
All right.

1052
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:40,969
We're fine.

1053
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,329
Don't just load.

1054
01:04:44,329 --> 01:04:44,969
Thank God.

1055
01:04:44,969 --> 01:04:47,449
I saved and loaded the same exact time, I think.

1056
01:04:47,449 --> 01:05:00,139
It's creepy.

1057
01:05:00,139 --> 01:05:02,780
What is this?

1058
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:03,099
Yeah.

1059
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:03,579
All right.

1060
01:05:03,579 --> 01:05:09,929
Walk on the carpet.

1061
01:05:09,929 --> 01:05:10,650
Where am I?

1062
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:14,869
I have to mention second floor.

1063
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,829
Throne room is right up here.

1064
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:19,190
Is he in the throne room?

1065
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:27,980
It's like the big dining hall.

1066
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:37,460
What is this?

1067
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:39,820
Is this like a secret room?

1068
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:49,130
Oh, fuck you.

1069
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:54,150
Stay right here.

1070
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:06,710
All right.

1071
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:13,260
If he's already seen me, does that mean...

1072
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,699
Can I still get him in one hit?

1073
01:06:14,699 --> 01:06:22,340
Yes.

1074
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:22,579
Okay.

1075
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:22,900
Good.

1076
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:37,289
I'm just saving it every five steps.

1077
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:40,380
What?

1078
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,420
How is that possible?

1079
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:41,739
No.

1080
01:06:41,739 --> 01:06:49,179
Reload.

1081
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:50,219
Somebody's seeing me.

1082
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:53,670
I'm making noise.

1083
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:54,150
Oh, whatever.

1084
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,030
I don't have to hit anybody.

1085
01:06:55,030 --> 01:07:02,619
Let's just go.

1086
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:02,860
Okay.

1087
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,619
So where's my orientation here?

1088
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:07,590
Throne room is this way.

1089
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,820
The tile floor is really loud.

1090
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:10,219
Yeah.

1091
01:07:10,219 --> 01:07:23,030
I have to go that way.

1092
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:23,670
Shit.

1093
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:23,909
Okay.

1094
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:24,389
We're fine.

1095
01:07:24,389 --> 01:07:28,360
Is this a big bath?

1096
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:36,250
Do you hear me go in the water?

1097
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:38,010
Oh, great.

1098
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:38,969
That's not good.

1099
01:07:38,969 --> 01:07:43,900
Does he care?

1100
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,940
I don't think he cares.

1101
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:54,519
Just don't move in the water.

1102
01:07:54,519 --> 01:08:01,300
I want to go inside of that thing,

1103
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:06,820
but I don't want to.

1104
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,019
Oh, boy.

1105
01:08:08,019 --> 01:08:15,420
You killed me in one hit.

1106
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:15,900
Are you kidding me?

1107
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:32,939
What do I have for armor?

1108
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:33,260
No.

1109
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:33,659
Fuck off.

1110
01:08:33,659 --> 01:08:34,729
I got it.

1111
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:43,609
He didn't see me.

1112
01:08:43,609 --> 01:08:44,329
I'm fine.

1113
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:53,430
Where's this other guy?

1114
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:54,300
All right.

1115
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,100
Nobody here.

1116
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:59,670
Is it my going to the throne room?

1117
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:01,989
I'm going back down.

1118
01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:13,560
Shit.

1119
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,399
You jump from carpet to carpet.

1120
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:22,970
Will they hear me jumping?

1121
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:30,949
All right.

1122
01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:31,909
Water arrows.

1123
01:09:31,909 --> 01:09:34,699
So I can do this on torches, you said, right?

1124
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:38,729
You got to use the rubber chicken

1125
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:46,100
with a pulley in the middle of the water.

1126
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:46,739
That's just good.

1127
01:09:46,739 --> 01:09:47,380
Absolute shit.

1128
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:48,979
Why did that scare me so much?

1129
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:51,340
I didn't expect he was going to be that close to me.

1130
01:09:51,340 --> 01:10:05,880
This guy's got golden armor on.

1131
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,000
Swing at me, please.

1132
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:17,449
He gave me a goddamn break.

1133
01:10:17,449 --> 01:10:22,420
All right.

1134
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,779
Jump from place to place.

1135
01:10:23,779 --> 01:10:27,770
Holy shit.

1136
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:28,250
It worked.

1137
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:37,659
It worked.

1138
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:38,859
What a bunch of geniuses.

1139
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:39,579
Seriously.

1140
01:10:39,579 --> 01:10:45,100
Get you in the dark.

1141
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:45,819
All right.

1142
01:10:45,819 --> 01:10:47,180
I have to save it.

1143
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,939
I have the key to the throne room now.

1144
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:00,039
Recent delivery of antiquities from Vaughn

1145
01:11:00,039 --> 01:11:02,840
contains several items which we felt might be of interest to you.

1146
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,239
Descriptions follow, but you are welcome to drop by our shop

1147
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:07,399
to examine them or other goods in person.

1148
01:11:07,399 --> 01:11:10,039
An ornamental scepter three feet in length.

1149
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:11,000
That's huge.

1150
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,130
The body of the stave is weird.

1151
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:17,609
Carved in the star and dot pattern.

1152
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:21,130
Six inches of the ferrule and five inches of the grip

1153
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:25,050
are bound with burnished copper overlaid by an ink and glaze

1154
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:26,979
varnish.

1155
01:11:26,979 --> 01:11:28,819
It's pretty good looking, I think.

1156
01:11:28,819 --> 01:11:31,050
Cloudstone, one of the finest of its type,

1157
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:34,250
we have seen a treasure box of two feet by three feet of four feet

1158
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:36,010
by silver birch wood.

1159
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:38,970
The lid is really pretty.

1160
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:42,010
The inside of the box contains two principal compartments,

1161
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,489
one with glass shelves, and it's very expensive.

1162
01:11:44,489 --> 01:11:49,529
No.

1163
01:11:49,529 --> 01:11:51,640
Ooh.

1164
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,439
Dog bone.

1165
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:57,079
OK.

1166
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:57,960
Let's keep going.

1167
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:04,260
Where am I now?

1168
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:04,819
All right.

1169
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:06,659
I definitely have a key to the throne room.

1170
01:12:06,659 --> 01:12:11,510
Healing potion key.

1171
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:12,310
That's a big key.

1172
01:12:12,869 --> 01:12:15,270
Where's the throne room, though?

1173
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:30,890
Think you can just vanish in the shadows again, tricksy boy.

1174
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:32,810
I've played enough Dark Souls to be able to do this.

1175
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:33,449
OK, never mind.

1176
01:12:46,649 --> 01:13:02,869
Where did he come from?

1177
01:13:02,869 --> 01:13:04,069
No, don't shoot it.

1178
01:13:04,069 --> 01:13:05,029
How do I pull it back?

1179
01:13:05,029 --> 01:13:09,640
What happened?

1180
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,000
I hit him in the leg and he died.

1181
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,739
All right, we're good.

1182
01:13:12,739 --> 01:13:28,760
All right, I think I got to go down that hallway.

1183
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:33,260
Let me see.

1184
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:34,460
I can cut the banners.

1185
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:35,659
I'm curious what that means.

1186
01:13:35,659 --> 01:13:39,079
What does that do?

1187
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:47,899
I need the throne room.

1188
01:13:47,899 --> 01:13:48,859
Now I'm on this edge.

1189
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:49,899
I got to go over here.

1190
01:13:49,899 --> 01:13:51,500
I wish I had an indicator of where I was.

1191
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:56,279
It's probably the courtyard, right?

1192
01:13:56,279 --> 01:14:01,619
Press Y to fart.

1193
01:14:01,619 --> 01:14:05,500
I mean, I did it, just curious.

1194
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,569
I have a compass.

1195
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:12,380
It's a grenade.

1196
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:14,539
All right, so what is the compass telling me to go?

1197
01:14:14,539 --> 01:14:20,470
So the compass is pointing in the direction I need to go?

1198
01:14:22,739 --> 01:14:26,329
Or OK, so is this north, southeast, right?

1199
01:14:26,329 --> 01:14:26,890
Am I?

1200
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:29,189
Is that correct?

1201
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:34,819
So I got to go this way, right?

1202
01:14:34,819 --> 01:14:36,260
Is this would be east?

1203
01:14:41,829 --> 01:14:44,869
The painted top is facing north, right?

1204
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:50,260
Guys, I haven't looked at a compass in probably 20 years.

1205
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:51,619
I don't even care what they are.

1206
01:14:52,979 --> 01:14:54,340
This is pointing north.

1207
01:14:54,899 --> 01:14:57,140
So that means that if I'm going this way,

1208
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,819
that I'm currently going east.

1209
01:14:58,819 --> 01:15:01,479
That's correct?

1210
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,119
Yes.

1211
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:06,760
OK, right.

1212
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,720
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1213
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,090
All right, so I got to go.

1214
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:12,569
There we go.

1215
01:15:12,569 --> 01:15:13,210
Through that door.

1216
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:16,869
OK, here we go.

1217
01:15:16,869 --> 01:15:25,239
This is it.

1218
01:15:25,239 --> 01:15:26,119
That's the throne, right?

1219
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,479
No, it's a bed.

1220
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:28,199
I thought it was it.

1221
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:31,479
OK, from this angle, it looked like a big throne.

1222
01:15:31,479 --> 01:15:33,579
It's got a lot of money, though.

1223
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:39,140
Another key.

1224
01:15:39,939 --> 01:15:40,500
What?

1225
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,380
I don't know.

1226
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:51,239
All right, not the throne room.

1227
01:15:51,239 --> 01:15:53,479
OK, it's another door on this side, then?

1228
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:55,510
This is a personal bedroom.

1229
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:57,930
Right here.

1230
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:05,449
OK, this is locked.

1231
01:16:05,449 --> 01:16:06,170
This is locked.

1232
01:16:07,449 --> 01:16:08,090
Is he in here?

1233
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:32,420
You're the flash bomb.

1234
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:56,100
But I see this.

1235
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,529
Ah!

1236
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:58,170
I got him.

1237
01:16:58,170 --> 01:17:05,500
Is that a gong?

1238
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,060
Don't touch that.

1239
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:06,859
That's definitely like...

1240
01:17:06,859 --> 01:17:10,779
That's probably like an alarm.

1241
01:17:10,779 --> 01:17:13,050
All right, I made it to the throne room.

1242
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:17,859
Tenches.

1243
01:17:17,859 --> 01:17:18,579
Here it is.

1244
01:17:18,579 --> 01:17:22,250
I found the scepter.

1245
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,449
OK, scepter's right here.

1246
01:17:24,949 --> 01:17:26,069
Here we go.

1247
01:17:26,069 --> 01:17:26,550
All right.

1248
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:31,180
Hell yeah.

1249
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:38,500
I did it.

1250
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,220
30 minutes.

1251
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:41,140
Found 705 loot.

1252
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:44,680
I picked one pocket.

1253
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:45,960
Zero knockouts out of...

1254
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,239
Wait, zero knockouts?

1255
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:49,060
How?

1256
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:50,420
Innocence killed some.

1257
01:17:51,369 --> 01:17:53,689
That's such a weird statistic.

1258
01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:56,539
This doesn't say how many.

1259
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:59,939
Innocence killed, I don't know, a few.

1260
01:17:59,939 --> 01:18:01,380
I was not paying attention.

1261
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,539
When I was writing down my debriefing,

1262
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:05,539
I don't remember how many innocent people I killed.

1263
01:18:05,539 --> 01:18:08,220
So I just wrote some.

1264
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:08,939
And others.

1265
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:12,680
Ah.

1266
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:13,720
Some and others.

1267
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:14,359
I don't know, whatever.

1268
01:18:14,359 --> 01:18:18,819
I don't know who they were.

1269
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:23,739
That was kind of fun.

1270
01:18:23,739 --> 01:18:24,539
You didn't hit the gong?

1271
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:26,460
I didn't think I was going to end the mission right there.

1272
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:35,939
Melting this down.

1273
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:51,449
Someone just called Thief an unknown game that I dug up.

1274
01:18:51,449 --> 01:18:54,760
It got remade, what, four or five years ago?

1275
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:56,649
Didn't they kind of do a remake?

1276
01:18:57,210 --> 01:19:00,439
I think so.

1277
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:08,619
I went to Cuddy's place to deliver the sector.

1278
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:09,899
That was ten years ago.

1279
01:19:09,899 --> 01:19:11,020
Wait, what?

1280
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:12,619
It was ten years ago?

1281
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:14,939
I thought that was like two years ago.

1282
01:19:14,939 --> 01:19:16,300
Apparently, they all proved of his occupation.

1283
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:16,380
And I doubt they proved of mine.

1284
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:18,220
It was 2014.

1285
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:18,380
Really?

1286
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,380
So hopefully, they'll never catch sight of me

1287
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,899
when I break him out of their prison.

1288
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,859
Which is what I'm going to do.

1289
01:19:24,859 --> 01:19:26,060
It was 2012.

1290
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:31,000
They're holding Cuddy in a mine where he's flooded,

1291
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,560
but the hammers still work the top-level mines

1292
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,239
and have converted part of the complex

1293
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:39,159
into a penitentiary for those who violate their tenets.

1294
01:19:39,159 --> 01:19:40,279
Reface came up for this one?

1295
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,760
An associate of mine was confined there.

1296
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:43,319
That was weird.

1297
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:44,119
I don't know what happened there.

1298
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,439
It would be difficult to get in by way of the main gate,

1299
01:19:48,439 --> 01:19:50,039
but there is another option.

1300
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,640
The mines break the surface of a hill south of the quarry.

1301
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:55,800
I'll drop into the mines and head for the mine.

1302
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:56,840
Hairline check?

1303
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,319
Got it.

1304
01:19:57,319 --> 01:19:59,479
Which way we found somewhere uphill into the north.

1305
01:20:00,199 --> 01:20:02,199
The hammers can venture into these lower mines.

1306
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:03,079
It's getting worse, but it's okay.

1307
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:07,670
Because they're reputed to be on this job,

1308
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,350
but Cuddy's a reliable fence,

1309
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:12,229
and I don't appreciate the hammerites abducting him.

1310
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:13,670
All right.

1311
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:16,069
So I got to break money for the Bafford job.

1312
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:17,510
Break people out of jail?

1313
01:20:18,229 --> 01:20:24,460
Oh, your map doesn't show the way through the mine,

1314
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:25,739
so you're going to have to scout around

1315
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:27,579
to make your way to where they hold the prisoners.

1316
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:30,819
Cuddy still owes you for the Bafford job.

1317
01:20:30,819 --> 01:20:32,420
Break him out and you'll get your cash.

1318
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:33,380
All right.

1319
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:36,340
I'm back.

1320
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:36,659
Hold on.

1321
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:38,260
Let me get the camera to look okay.

1322
01:20:38,819 --> 01:20:41,779
Let me wait.

1323
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:43,060
Let me just get this done.

1324
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,939
This is a dog bone.

1325
01:20:48,939 --> 01:20:49,579
How much is this?

1326
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:50,939
I can buy this?

1327
01:20:50,939 --> 01:20:51,500
It's a tip.

1328
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:55,640
It's 300 bucks,

1329
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:59,000
and it reveals where the hammers are keeping Cuddy.

1330
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:01,659
Speed potion.

1331
01:21:01,659 --> 01:21:03,659
This potion will greatly increase your speed for a little while.

1332
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:04,380
I can just bunny hop.

1333
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:09,609
I thought I said in Craigslist.

1334
01:21:09,609 --> 01:21:13,289
A former prisoner of Craigsleft says he has info about the haunted mines.

1335
01:21:15,449 --> 01:21:16,970
I have plenty of these.

1336
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:17,609
Moss arrow.

1337
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:20,819
Oh, okay.

1338
01:21:20,819 --> 01:21:22,340
That's actually really helpful.

1339
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,060
Noisemaker?

1340
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:25,319
Yeah, I want those.

1341
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:32,180
I think I'm all right.

1342
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,659
Is there anything?

1343
01:21:33,659 --> 01:21:35,420
Maybe I should buy another healing potion.

1344
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:36,060
250.

1345
01:21:36,699 --> 01:21:37,720
I think it's worth it.

1346
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:39,930
Probably buy it.

1347
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:47,260
It's worth it.

1348
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:49,579
Your cash does not carry over between missions.

1349
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:50,779
It does not.

1350
01:21:50,779 --> 01:21:55,800
So should I just buy everything?

1351
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,760
Okay, so there's no point.

1352
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:58,600
So wait, give me that hot tip.

1353
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:02,340
I want to know exactly where he is.

1354
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,890
Give me the hot tip and give me a potion.

1355
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:08,140
And how many arrows do I need?

1356
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,500
Maybe a couple more of these moss arrows.

1357
01:22:11,239 --> 01:22:11,880
30 cents.

1358
01:22:12,739 --> 01:22:13,539
All right, I think that's good.

1359
01:22:17,029 --> 01:22:17,590
Spend it all.

1360
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:17,829
All right.

1361
01:22:17,829 --> 01:22:19,560
Yeah, that's good to know.

1362
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:19,960
All right.

1363
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,720
This one, I'm going to save it right here.

1364
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,640
I'm going to do like a hard save.

1365
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:26,890
Let me get my camera to work.

1366
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:30,819
Because the camera is like all buggy right now.

1367
01:22:30,819 --> 01:22:31,140
Hold on.

1368
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,659
Let me turn on the ring light.

1369
01:22:32,659 --> 01:22:39,210
I've got a ring light.

1370
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:45,579
How does that look?

1371
01:22:45,579 --> 01:22:48,279
That looks better or worse?

1372
01:22:48,279 --> 01:22:52,359
It needs to be a little bit brighter.

1373
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,960
I like that.

1374
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:59,399
It looks all right.

1375
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:04,939
Is it better?

1376
01:23:04,939 --> 01:23:08,600
Yeah, look, I've got my ring light on now.

1377
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:13,300
Okay.

1378
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:19,659
How does that look?

1379
01:23:19,659 --> 01:23:20,539
Fine.

1380
01:23:20,539 --> 01:23:21,180
Do we look okay?

1381
01:23:21,739 --> 01:23:23,989
What is it, Ronnie?

1382
01:23:23,989 --> 01:23:26,229
I'm not putting the ring light around my neck.

1383
01:23:26,229 --> 01:23:27,109
It's not happening.

1384
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:28,899
No.

1385
01:23:28,899 --> 01:23:31,619
Maybe if I can confirm that it's going to be safe, I'll do it.

1386
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:32,869
All right.

1387
01:23:32,869 --> 01:23:34,949
You get face cam for a half of one mission.

1388
01:23:34,949 --> 01:23:38,600
Here we go.

1389
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:46,020
I hope I didn't need that.

1390
01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:51,399
One full mission or no.

1391
01:23:51,399 --> 01:23:52,119
There is no deal.

1392
01:23:52,119 --> 01:23:54,279
I just turned it on and the white balance is wrong anyways.

1393
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:54,840
Who cares?

1394
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,119
Let me fix that quick.

1395
01:23:56,119 --> 01:24:01,289
All right.

1396
01:24:01,289 --> 01:24:04,649
It resets my camera settings every time I start.

1397
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:11,399
It's better.

1398
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:19,859
There we go.

1399
01:24:19,859 --> 01:24:22,500
That's like what it looks like in this room right now.

1400
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,710
Like that.

1401
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:25,430
Okay.

1402
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:26,149
That's fine.

1403
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:31,659
Is it a blue light?

1404
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:32,619
I didn't even...

1405
01:24:32,619 --> 01:24:32,939
Whatever.

1406
01:24:32,939 --> 01:24:33,260
I don't care.

1407
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:33,739
Let's just go.

1408
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:35,380
All right.

1409
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:38,020
I got to go through the mines and I got to find the...

1410
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:39,300
I got to find the person.

1411
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,880
I got to break the person out.

1412
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:45,100
Can I smash somebody's head with a boulder?

1413
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:45,659
I hope so.

1414
01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:46,300
We're going to try it.

1415
01:24:46,939 --> 01:24:58,010
Is it such a Bostonian?

1416
01:24:58,569 --> 01:25:01,220
Not anymore.

1417
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:05,699
I've been not in Massachusetts for quite a while now.

1418
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:09,079
Swim down.

1419
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:16,470
So the goal is to get through...

1420
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:25,270
I think I need to turn the bright...

1421
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:25,909
What happened here?

1422
01:25:37,609 --> 01:25:38,250
That I deserve.

1423
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:39,829
I did not realize...

1424
01:25:39,829 --> 01:25:40,869
I didn't know what was going on there.

1425
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:40,949
Okay.

1426
01:25:40,949 --> 01:25:42,310
Give me my boulder back.

1427
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:50,619
It was a...

1428
01:25:50,619 --> 01:25:51,100
All right.

1429
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,380
It's marked on the map where he is, right?

1430
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:55,000
Mines prison factory.

1431
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:59,220
It's just like Dante's Inferno.

1432
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,260
These are the layers of hell.

1433
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:03,529
These are the layers.

1434
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:10,279
What's this?

1435
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:14,180
I thought that was an enemy.

1436
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:16,020
I thought that was a person coming to get me.

1437
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:19,189
What does that do?

1438
01:26:19,829 --> 01:26:25,020
Can I slash this?

1439
01:26:25,579 --> 01:26:29,460
What does this do?

1440
01:26:30,970 --> 01:26:32,250
Water arrows in it?

1441
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,960
That's not a bad idea.

1442
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:45,130
Holy water will kill zombies.

1443
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:46,970
There are no zombies in this game.

1444
01:26:46,970 --> 01:27:01,560
There are zombies in this game.

1445
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:13,500
Oh, that didn't do anything.

1446
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:15,659
That didn't do anything.

1447
01:27:15,659 --> 01:27:32,500
What's that?

1448
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,829
Where's the water?

1449
01:27:35,829 --> 01:27:36,550
Factory.

1450
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:39,239
There it is.

1451
01:27:39,239 --> 01:27:40,680
Do I have to like bless myself?

1452
01:27:41,319 --> 01:27:42,039
All right.

1453
01:27:42,039 --> 01:27:44,699
I'm blessed.

1454
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:53,720
It only lasts for 30 seconds.

1455
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,000
It doesn't kill in one...

1456
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:00,810
Holy shit.

1457
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:11,960
What do I do about this?

1458
01:28:25,539 --> 01:28:26,500
I'm going to get up there somehow.

1459
01:28:28,739 --> 01:28:30,260
I'm going to turn the gam up.

1460
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:31,779
I'm going to turn the gam up, I think.

1461
01:28:31,779 --> 01:28:33,989
Is that safe to go down there?

1462
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:37,850
I'm going to turn the gam up.

1463
01:28:43,909 --> 01:28:47,819
I'm going to turn the gam up.

1464
01:28:47,819 --> 01:28:53,590
It's probably better, right?

1465
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:56,630
I have more.

1466
01:28:57,109 --> 01:28:59,109
This is cheating probably, but I don't care.

1467
01:28:59,109 --> 01:29:04,619
Is it buying to lean over edges and look down?

1468
01:29:04,619 --> 01:29:11,100
I think I'm supposed to go down here.

1469
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,060
Or up, I guess.

1470
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:21,189
How high should I go?

1471
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:26,810
I'm already dead right there.

1472
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:34,300
Is that guy a zombie?

1473
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:38,170
I think so, yeah.

1474
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:42,149
Can I just...

1475
01:29:42,149 --> 01:29:43,350
Okay, can I kill him?

1476
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:44,550
Like with the sword?

1477
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:50,539
Is this the zombie?

1478
01:29:50,539 --> 01:29:51,659
Why is he just breathing?

1479
01:29:57,529 --> 01:29:58,409
What happened?

1480
01:29:58,409 --> 01:29:58,970
Is he dead?

1481
01:29:58,970 --> 01:29:59,369
Ah!

1482
01:29:59,369 --> 01:30:00,569
I knew somebody was right near me.

1483
01:30:00,569 --> 01:30:01,289
What happened?

1484
01:30:01,289 --> 01:30:01,930
What?

1485
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:03,210
It's not even fucking scary.

1486
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:03,689
Relax.

1487
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:05,050
Don't overreact for no reason.

1488
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:06,489
Overactor.

1489
01:30:06,489 --> 01:30:07,289
Overreactor.

1490
01:30:08,789 --> 01:30:10,149
I thought that was him breathing.

1491
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:12,460
I can't hurt him.

1492
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:13,100
Okay, bad.

1493
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:18,329
Are you going to give me a dead end?

1494
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:31,260
They're taking up the exact space that I need to run around them.

1495
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:38,260
I still have a grenade.

1496
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,619
What is happening in this game?

1497
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:07,909
Okay.

1498
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,279
Is this a haunted house now?

1499
01:31:14,819 --> 01:31:15,380
All right.

1500
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:16,100
Um, okay.

1501
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:17,220
I got to keep going up.

1502
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,819
Keep going north, I guess.

1503
01:31:18,819 --> 01:31:19,300
Or up?

1504
01:31:19,939 --> 01:31:26,840
I hear...

1505
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,420
I hear humans.

1506
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:29,220
I hear human life.

1507
01:31:51,609 --> 01:32:03,350
You get one little measly health back for a fucking $300 health potion.

1508
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:13,670
I have those noise arrows, right?

1509
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:14,149
Let me...

1510
01:32:14,149 --> 01:32:16,279
Okay, let me use them.

1511
01:32:16,279 --> 01:32:16,920
Moss arrow.

1512
01:32:17,739 --> 01:32:18,380
Noise arrow.

1513
01:32:18,939 --> 01:32:51,430
Quiet.

1514
01:32:51,430 --> 01:33:04,199
He's right there.

1515
01:33:04,199 --> 01:33:08,739
Get him right now.

1516
01:33:08,739 --> 01:33:16,979
I thought I spied something.

1517
01:33:16,979 --> 01:33:17,779
Hiding shall...

1518
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:22,859
I threw a shovel at him and he didn't even care.

1519
01:33:22,859 --> 01:33:31,100
It takes care of those too.

1520
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:34,140
Where am I at?

1521
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:35,020
I got to go up.

1522
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:36,039
This, uh...

1523
01:33:36,039 --> 01:33:37,479
I can go up that way, but what's over here?

1524
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:47,050
This is a secret or something?

1525
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:47,609
Something I can get?

1526
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:49,109
I'll check it.

1527
01:33:49,109 --> 01:33:49,430
Why not?

1528
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,600
Oh, I think this is a different entrance.

1529
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:57,460
Can I swim up it like a salmon?

1530
01:33:59,859 --> 01:34:00,420
No.

1531
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:00,819
Okay.

1532
01:34:00,819 --> 01:34:02,020
So this is another way to get down here.

1533
01:34:02,579 --> 01:34:06,340
Excuse me.

1534
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,659
What's this?

1535
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:20,680
Too far, too far, too far, too far.

1536
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:23,189
I'm gonna get lost if I don't cut it out.

1537
01:34:29,899 --> 01:34:30,779
Guards had keys.

1538
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,380
I think I got them.

1539
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:35,350
I didn't get the keys?

1540
01:34:35,989 --> 01:34:38,810
I thought when I picked them up, it would just give it to me.

1541
01:34:39,369 --> 01:34:47,750
According to Dickit, a heretic who was recently let out of Craigslist,

1542
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:50,470
Cutty's being held in cell block four.

1543
01:34:51,029 --> 01:34:52,470
Okay.

1544
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:53,750
So he's in cell block four.

1545
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:55,859
They had keys?

1546
01:34:55,859 --> 01:34:56,340
I didn't take...

1547
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,439
Oh, shit.

1548
01:35:00,439 --> 01:35:00,760
Okay.

1549
01:35:01,479 --> 01:35:07,750
I thought I was gonna just pick it up on their body and not get his key anymore.

1550
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:14,970
Where is it?

1551
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:18,199
I don't know.

1552
01:35:18,199 --> 01:35:29,000
Babe.

1553
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,979
It was just the potion?

1554
01:35:30,979 --> 01:35:31,380
All right.

1555
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:37,640
So cell block four.

1556
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:38,279
Here we are.

1557
01:35:38,279 --> 01:35:39,399
Careful, guard stations.

1558
01:35:39,399 --> 01:35:40,039
All right.

1559
01:35:40,039 --> 01:35:42,359
Control room, machine room, power station.

1560
01:35:42,359 --> 01:35:43,079
This is to the mine.

1561
01:35:43,079 --> 01:35:45,079
So we're going through and we're gonna be in the control room.

1562
01:35:45,079 --> 01:35:47,180
I'm gonna get to the prison.

1563
01:35:47,819 --> 01:36:02,939
Shit.

1564
01:36:02,939 --> 01:36:10,979
You idiot.

1565
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:11,539
You idiot.

1566
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:14,869
It's dark right here.

1567
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:15,430
He can't see me.

1568
01:36:27,449 --> 01:36:29,100
What are you saying?

1569
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:44,359
Do you have anything on you?

1570
01:36:44,359 --> 01:36:45,079
A key or anything?

1571
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:46,579
No.

1572
01:36:46,579 --> 01:36:46,899
All right.

1573
01:36:46,899 --> 01:36:48,100
Move this shit out of the way.

1574
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:58,470
Mine...

1575
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:00,489
Okay.

1576
01:37:00,489 --> 01:37:05,779
I need those arrows right now.

1577
01:37:05,779 --> 01:37:06,579
Oh, shit.

1578
01:37:06,579 --> 01:37:07,380
He didn't see it.

1579
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:07,779
I don't want...

1580
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:27,640
All right.

1581
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:27,960
I'm good.

1582
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:28,279
I'm good.

1583
01:37:28,279 --> 01:37:29,159
Good, good, good, good, good.

1584
01:37:29,159 --> 01:37:29,560
He can't...

1585
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:30,600
I'm in pitch black right now.

1586
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,159
He can't see me.

1587
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:42,310
Like there's a steam engine over there masking my sounds.

1588
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:44,010
All right.

1589
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:44,489
Come on.

1590
01:37:44,489 --> 01:37:44,890
This way.

1591
01:37:45,529 --> 01:37:49,510
All right.

1592
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:54,409
Tread softly.

1593
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:59,640
All right.

1594
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,279
Toss him in the corner.

1595
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:10,170
Okay.

1596
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:11,050
That's the only thing I can press.

1597
01:38:14,869 --> 01:38:19,479
I thought I was going to shock the floor.

1598
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:36,680
I thought I was going to just electrocute the ground in this.

1599
01:38:37,819 --> 01:38:38,859
That was so loud.

1600
01:38:38,859 --> 01:38:39,659
My ears hurt.

1601
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:40,779
Okay.

1602
01:38:41,739 --> 01:38:43,180
Machine rooms, control room.

1603
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:44,539
We've got to go up here.

1604
01:38:44,539 --> 01:38:48,760
Okay.

1605
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:49,720
Get to the prison.

1606
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:51,079
That's what that's all I got to do.

1607
01:38:51,079 --> 01:38:53,239
Save it right here.

1608
01:38:53,239 --> 01:38:54,279
Why you like this?

1609
01:38:54,279 --> 01:38:56,840
Because I attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

1610
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,479
And I'm like irrational and compulsive.

1611
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:02,090
Very high, strong, neurotic.

1612
01:39:02,649 --> 01:39:03,050
I don't know.

1613
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:05,670
That's why.

1614
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:06,630
And I'm like being cut off.

1615
01:39:07,659 --> 01:39:08,460
Nice excuse.

1616
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:09,579
I know it's not an excuse.

1617
01:39:09,579 --> 01:39:10,220
It really isn't.

1618
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:11,020
I know.

1619
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:24,819
I said neurotic, not erotic.

1620
01:39:26,489 --> 01:39:27,369
Open your ears.

1621
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:34,819
Are there people down here?

1622
01:39:34,819 --> 01:39:35,779
Because this is the...

1623
01:39:35,779 --> 01:39:39,020
Oh, this is the way to get to the factory.

1624
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:39,899
I mean to the prison.

1625
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:44,069
I'm not erotic.

1626
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:55,180
Why does it not work?

1627
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:58,649
What am I dumping?

1628
01:39:59,210 --> 01:40:06,710
What happened?

1629
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:09,140
What happened?

1630
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:09,939
Why somebody screamed?

1631
01:40:10,659 --> 01:40:17,819
What?

1632
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:21,449
It was me screaming.

1633
01:40:21,689 --> 01:40:27,779
I was not even close.

1634
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:28,819
All right.

1635
01:40:28,819 --> 01:40:30,579
I'll fucking take out some people here.

1636
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:41,510
Let's turn him into hot fucking magma.

1637
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:42,229
Come on over here.

1638
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:44,069
Come on over here.

1639
01:40:44,069 --> 01:40:44,710
Come on over here.

1640
01:40:46,119 --> 01:40:47,079
Come on over here, coward.

1641
01:40:47,079 --> 01:40:47,399
Hey, look.

1642
01:40:47,399 --> 01:40:48,039
You flipped me off.

1643
01:40:55,510 --> 01:40:55,989
Where is he?

1644
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:05,800
What?

1645
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:07,619
What is that?

1646
01:41:28,149 --> 01:41:29,510
Where is he going?

1647
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:30,069
Where are you going?

1648
01:41:37,529 --> 01:41:41,369
Oh, somebody's bleeding.

1649
01:41:43,989 --> 01:41:44,310
Got him.

1650
01:41:45,109 --> 01:41:49,880
Oh, I got the...

1651
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:50,439
I got a hammer.

1652
01:41:50,439 --> 01:41:51,159
What do I do with this?

1653
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:56,729
What do I do with the hammer?

1654
01:41:56,729 --> 01:41:57,770
Is somebody still alive?

1655
01:41:58,329 --> 01:42:12,300
Oh, I got two hammers.

1656
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:12,619
All right.

1657
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:16,819
What does this one make?

1658
01:42:16,819 --> 01:42:19,960
This one also makes hammers.

1659
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:20,760
No, I don't want any of this.

1660
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,239
Give me the...

1661
01:42:21,239 --> 01:42:21,880
Just give me the hammer.

1662
01:42:22,439 --> 01:42:34,300
Fucking asshole.

1663
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:39,210
I tried to jump over it.

1664
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:41,289
All right.

1665
01:42:41,289 --> 01:42:42,170
No more messing around.

1666
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:06,119
Fucking idiot.

1667
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:19,779
He's up here.

1668
01:43:32,899 --> 01:43:33,380
Oh, shit.

1669
01:43:34,579 --> 01:44:00,359
Oh, fuck you.

1670
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:01,159
Come on, dude.

1671
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:09,289
Don't even...

1672
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:25,050
Who swings a hammer like this with one hand?

1673
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:27,770
Like up that you can't even do that move.

1674
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:29,289
That move isn't even possible.

1675
01:44:30,090 --> 01:44:35,609
You can't take a huge two-handed hammer and go like this

1676
01:44:35,609 --> 01:44:37,930
and have it hit me right square in the front of the nose.

1677
01:44:38,729 --> 01:44:53,060
I got an idea.

1678
01:44:59,319 --> 01:45:00,279
Madka's bad.

1679
01:45:00,279 --> 01:45:00,520
Yeah.

1680
01:45:01,319 --> 01:45:04,539
I saw.

1681
01:45:04,539 --> 01:45:04,939
Move.

1682
01:45:56,569 --> 01:46:09,510
You guys have anything on you?

1683
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:09,989
No.

1684
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:19,460
Kind of show me her right.

1685
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:20,420
Yeah, rats.

1686
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:21,380
Just rats.

1687
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:32,680
That guy was singing.

1688
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:55,960
All right, he's hidden.

1689
01:46:55,960 --> 01:47:03,539
I think there's one more guy here.

1690
01:47:03,539 --> 01:47:04,340
The prison.

1691
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:07,779
Did I make one of these things though?

1692
01:47:07,779 --> 01:47:09,989
I feel like I need to take one of these.

1693
01:47:10,069 --> 01:47:32,380
Never face tribulation in their lives.

1694
01:47:33,659 --> 01:47:33,979
What?

1695
01:47:33,979 --> 01:47:34,619
There's nobody...

1696
01:47:34,619 --> 01:47:35,979
No, you don't look in the...

1697
01:47:35,979 --> 01:47:36,300
What?

1698
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:37,659
You don't look over here.

1699
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:39,500
Why would you be like,

1700
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:44,140
in time, I believe that thief Cuddy's friend has some...

1701
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:44,939
Why would you be doing that?

1702
01:47:44,939 --> 01:47:45,979
You're just having a conversation.

1703
01:47:50,649 --> 01:48:06,300
There's no way you're as fast as me be hopping, bro.

1704
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:06,939
I'm sorry.

1705
01:48:06,939 --> 01:48:07,579
There's no way.

1706
01:48:17,609 --> 01:48:18,729
You stupid game.

1707
01:48:18,729 --> 01:48:19,609
Whatever.

1708
01:48:19,609 --> 01:48:27,300
What do you mean mad at somebody?

1709
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:28,420
I'm just saying.

1710
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:29,380
If you have...

1711
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:29,619
Okay.

1712
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:31,859
If you and I are having a conversation.

1713
01:48:32,420 --> 01:48:33,140
We're just talking.

1714
01:48:33,859 --> 01:48:34,260
Yes.

1715
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:35,699
Okay, you're right here.

1716
01:48:37,109 --> 01:48:39,029
Like this whole space,

1717
01:48:39,029 --> 01:48:42,649
like this spot over here in the corner,

1718
01:48:43,289 --> 01:48:44,170
I am not going to...

1719
01:48:44,170 --> 01:48:46,489
If I see like a squirrel move over there,

1720
01:48:46,489 --> 01:48:48,729
I'm not going to immediately take a sword out and run over there.

1721
01:48:49,289 --> 01:48:50,569
We're in the middle of a conversation.

1722
01:48:50,569 --> 01:48:52,890
I'm not just going to peer that way

1723
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:54,329
and go after whatever it is.

1724
01:48:54,890 --> 01:48:56,250
No, it's not going to happen.

1725
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:03,300
They're prison guards.

1726
01:49:03,939 --> 01:49:04,579
Oh, but that...

1727
01:49:11,819 --> 01:49:23,529
We didn't even know I was there.

1728
01:49:49,449 --> 01:49:51,609
So you're telling me that they're prison guards.

1729
01:49:51,609 --> 01:49:52,649
Do you remember they're prison guards?

1730
01:49:52,649 --> 01:49:53,130
They're guards.

1731
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:55,109
Do you remember they're prison guards?

1732
01:49:55,109 --> 01:49:56,949
I just threw one of those nerf...

1733
01:49:58,039 --> 01:49:59,560
You know those nerf whistleers?

1734
01:50:00,199 --> 01:50:02,439
The thing that like Brett Favre was in the commercial

1735
01:50:02,439 --> 01:50:03,640
and he threw it like, look this,

1736
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:04,840
I can throw this 100 yards.

1737
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:05,319
And it goes...

1738
01:50:07,319 --> 01:50:10,010
I just threw one of those right next to them

1739
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:11,130
and they didn't even hear it.

1740
01:50:11,130 --> 01:50:13,539
I just whipped one of those

1741
01:50:13,539 --> 01:50:15,060
and you're telling me that they're...

1742
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:16,500
Aren't they supposed to be aware?

1743
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:33,859
No reaction.

1744
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:24,220
Why are they doing this?

1745
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:45,819
Block four.

1746
01:51:45,819 --> 01:51:46,380
All right, let's go.

1747
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:59,029
What happened?

1748
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:12,579
Why did...

1749
01:52:12,579 --> 01:52:13,140
What happened?

1750
01:52:13,699 --> 01:52:19,060
I'm confused what just happened.

1751
01:52:19,779 --> 01:52:23,100
This guy didn't see me.

1752
01:52:23,739 --> 01:52:28,390
It was a medieval security camera.

1753
01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:31,850
Who saw me?

1754
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:32,409
I don't get it.

1755
01:52:36,779 --> 01:52:38,779
It's just like a little thing going like this.

1756
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:54,579
Who can see me right now?

1757
01:53:01,159 --> 01:53:04,039
They didn't even have sound effects like this back then.

1758
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:05,079
What?

1759
01:53:08,710 --> 01:53:09,909
It's in the ceiling.

1760
01:53:09,909 --> 01:53:10,710
No, it's not.

1761
01:53:15,979 --> 01:53:17,739
That's what's seeing me?

1762
01:53:17,739 --> 01:53:19,100
I thought you guys were making it up.

1763
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:20,859
I thought that was a joke.

1764
01:53:21,659 --> 01:53:23,659
There's a medieval security camera.

1765
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:28,729
Are you kidding me?

1766
01:53:29,529 --> 01:53:34,170
So what am I supposed to do about that?

1767
01:53:34,890 --> 01:53:36,619
I guess put this out?

1768
01:53:38,890 --> 01:53:40,010
Can it see in the dark?

1769
01:53:40,649 --> 01:53:51,130
Okay, I can't go this way.

1770
01:54:03,479 --> 01:54:04,840
I thought I could get him.

1771
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:06,279
I thought I'd just go into the window.

1772
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:25,880
Oh, can I go under here and then above?

1773
01:54:27,699 --> 01:54:29,539
I guess I can wrap around maybe and go up.

1774
01:54:32,329 --> 01:54:32,810
I don't know.

1775
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:35,899
It's steampunk.

1776
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:43,189
You know, steampunk is like the Jedi hand wave for all fiction.

1777
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:52,010
Who passes there?

1778
01:54:52,649 --> 01:54:57,619
It's steampunk.

1779
01:54:57,619 --> 01:54:58,420
I would not have thought...

1780
01:54:58,420 --> 01:54:59,220
Therefore, it's fine.

1781
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:00,819
...dare their teeth against the builders' house.

1782
01:55:00,819 --> 01:55:01,380
Steampunk.

1783
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:02,260
Therefore, it's fine.

1784
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:06,539
Oh, shit.

1785
01:55:06,539 --> 01:55:06,939
Oh, shit.

1786
01:55:06,939 --> 01:55:07,420
Oh, shit.

1787
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:15,289
Who are thou?

1788
01:55:15,289 --> 01:55:15,770
Okay.

1789
01:55:15,770 --> 01:55:16,170
All right.

1790
01:55:17,050 --> 01:55:17,689
Very clearly.

1791
01:55:17,689 --> 01:55:18,409
That guy's got a key.

1792
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:24,300
Use the walk button?

1793
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:26,760
I'm thinking about just running in.

1794
01:55:30,149 --> 01:55:39,319
Somebody comes up here and patrols, and I need to be aware of that.

1795
01:55:40,119 --> 01:55:40,920
Just rush in.

1796
01:55:42,859 --> 01:55:44,060
I can't just rush in.

1797
01:55:45,479 --> 01:55:46,279
I think I can...

1798
01:55:48,979 --> 01:55:49,779
He heard you walk.

1799
01:55:49,779 --> 01:55:55,829
I think I have to go down to the sewer as much as I don't want to.

1800
01:55:56,550 --> 01:55:57,750
Okay, this guy's coming over here.

1801
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:02,920
I'll knock this guy out in the corner.

1802
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:09,180
The light goes out for a minute.

1803
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:11,819
It does.

1804
01:56:12,539 --> 01:56:13,579
One, two, three.

1805
01:56:15,399 --> 01:56:16,359
One, two, three.

1806
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:43,989
This guy's just gargling in the mirror.

1807
01:56:48,649 --> 01:56:49,369
Nobody.

1808
01:56:49,369 --> 01:56:50,090
Nobody goes.

1809
01:56:52,010 --> 01:56:53,260
How...

1810
01:56:53,260 --> 01:56:53,819
When do I go?

1811
01:56:54,539 --> 01:56:56,300
Oh, that's not much time at all.

1812
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:59,899
One, two, one, two, three.

1813
01:56:59,899 --> 01:57:00,399
Go.

1814
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:04,729
Save it?

1815
01:57:04,729 --> 01:57:05,369
Save it, save it, save it.

1816
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:08,220
Double up four.

1817
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:22,300
Which one...

1818
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:23,260
What is he in?

1819
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:25,539
I need my hot tip.

1820
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:31,420
According to Dickit, a heretic who was recently let out of Craig's Cleft,

1821
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:33,819
Cuddy, is being held in cell block four.

1822
01:57:34,619 --> 01:57:36,340
How do I distract this guy?

1823
01:57:41,819 --> 01:57:42,380
I need it.

1824
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:42,859
I need help.

1825
01:57:42,859 --> 01:57:43,579
All right.

1826
01:57:43,579 --> 01:57:44,220
Let's see what I can do.

1827
01:57:46,069 --> 01:57:46,710
Noise arrow?

1828
01:57:47,430 --> 01:57:51,560
I hear somebody coming over here.

1829
01:57:52,939 --> 01:57:53,340
Oh, God.

1830
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:53,659
Oh, God.

1831
01:57:53,659 --> 01:57:54,060
What do I do?

1832
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:54,859
What do I do?

1833
01:57:54,859 --> 01:57:55,260
Oh, God.

1834
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:55,659
What do I do?

1835
01:57:56,539 --> 01:58:01,449
Let me in.

1836
01:58:01,449 --> 01:58:01,689
Let me in.

1837
01:58:01,689 --> 01:58:02,090
Open the door.

1838
01:58:02,090 --> 01:58:02,569
Open the door.

1839
01:58:02,569 --> 01:58:02,729
Open.

1840
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:10,329
Where?

1841
01:58:19,289 --> 01:58:20,010
Out of here.

1842
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:25,079
Got him.

1843
01:58:25,079 --> 01:58:37,979
We good?

1844
01:58:37,979 --> 01:58:38,699
Where is this guy?

1845
01:58:46,439 --> 01:58:51,560
Oh, shit.

1846
01:59:06,779 --> 01:59:08,699
You piece of...

1847
01:59:08,699 --> 01:59:09,659
No way.

1848
01:59:09,659 --> 01:59:10,140
No way.

1849
01:59:10,699 --> 01:59:20,779
No, turn it off.

1850
01:59:20,779 --> 01:59:21,819
Turn it off.

1851
01:59:21,819 --> 01:59:22,300
Turn it off.

1852
01:59:27,829 --> 01:59:29,109
Kill this motherfucker.

1853
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:29,989
What?

1854
01:59:30,789 --> 01:59:44,460
I was just kidding.

1855
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:46,600
I was just testing to see if it worked.

1856
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:51,399
We were just having an electrical test to see if it worked or not.

1857
01:59:51,399 --> 01:59:52,840
If we just have an electrical test.

1858
02:00:00,699 --> 02:00:01,739
Get out of the fucking way.

1859
02:00:01,739 --> 02:00:02,300
He's in the way.

1860
02:00:20,060 --> 02:00:22,390
You got to be kidding me, dude.

1861
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:23,029
He's going to go...

1862
02:00:23,829 --> 02:00:25,510
I'm going to go channel channel.

1863
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:26,310
He's kidding me.

1864
02:00:27,350 --> 02:00:28,390
Run away, coward.

1865
02:00:29,029 --> 02:00:29,829
Run away, coward.

1866
02:00:32,119 --> 02:00:32,359
All right.

1867
02:00:32,359 --> 02:00:33,960
No more Alex Jones.

1868
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:36,899
He's...

1869
02:00:36,899 --> 02:00:38,420
Oh, yeah.

1870
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:39,939
I can't get in there now, can I?

1871
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:48,420
You didn't think I was going to be able to get in and get you, did you?

1872
02:00:57,850 --> 02:00:58,890
Ah, now you can't get in.

1873
02:00:59,529 --> 02:01:00,649
Now I can stay here.

1874
02:01:01,369 --> 02:01:05,420
Awesome.

1875
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:06,539
Lady Taker.

1876
02:01:06,539 --> 02:01:07,340
Lisa Vandal.

1877
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:08,939
Wills.

1878
02:01:08,939 --> 02:01:09,579
Number six.

1879
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:10,699
Cutty.

1880
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:16,199
How do I turn this off?

1881
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:22,840
How do I turn this off?

1882
02:01:23,479 --> 02:01:30,550
Good luck.

1883
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:32,699
It's kind of crazy out there.

1884
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:35,420
That guy's going to get fucking grabbed.

1885
02:01:49,289 --> 02:01:50,569
How many cells do I have?

1886
02:01:50,569 --> 02:01:51,210
Where's six?

1887
02:01:52,090 --> 02:01:52,890
Hey, Cutty.

1888
02:01:52,890 --> 02:01:53,130
Come on.

1889
02:01:53,130 --> 02:01:53,850
Come with me.

1890
02:01:53,850 --> 02:01:54,729
We got to get out of here.

1891
02:01:54,729 --> 02:01:55,369
Immediately.

1892
02:02:00,539 --> 02:02:01,340
Speak into my ear.

1893
02:02:19,659 --> 02:02:31,800
I'm imagining the guy that ran out first.

1894
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:37,800
They're all going to just pile on top of that guy.

1895
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:39,159
And like, he's the bad guy.

1896
02:02:39,159 --> 02:02:40,279
He's the one that broke out.

1897
02:02:40,279 --> 02:02:41,720
He caused all this.

1898
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:42,520
What happened to you?

1899
02:02:43,159 --> 02:02:43,399
What?

1900
02:02:44,359 --> 02:02:45,899
What happened?

1901
02:02:45,899 --> 02:02:46,619
What's wrong with him?

1902
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:53,000
Was that supposed to happen?

1903
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:53,560
I'll get him out.

1904
02:02:54,199 --> 02:02:55,640
What's the new objective?

1905
02:03:01,449 --> 02:03:02,489
I failed this one.

1906
02:03:02,489 --> 02:03:03,289
Okay.

1907
02:03:03,289 --> 02:03:05,529
Find the evidence locker and retrieve Felix's map.

1908
02:03:06,090 --> 02:03:09,020
All right.

1909
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:09,739
Evidence locker.

1910
02:03:11,189 --> 02:03:12,390
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1911
02:03:12,390 --> 02:03:12,710
Off.

1912
02:03:12,710 --> 02:03:12,949
Okay.

1913
02:03:12,949 --> 02:03:14,069
Barracks and offices quarters.

1914
02:03:14,069 --> 02:03:14,710
We've got to go this way.

1915
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:21,260
Did I save it?

1916
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:22,619
I feel like I shouldn't.

1917
02:03:22,619 --> 02:03:29,130
How do I get out of here?

1918
02:03:29,130 --> 02:03:42,819
Level two.

1919
02:03:42,819 --> 02:03:42,979
All right.

1920
02:03:42,979 --> 02:03:43,699
I'm in level two.

1921
02:03:44,819 --> 02:03:45,380
Guards.

1922
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:49,420
I couldn't hear anything from that cut scene

1923
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:50,460
because the blaring...

1924
02:03:57,300 --> 02:03:57,939
Open the door.

1925
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:05,960
How do I turn the alarm off?

1926
02:04:09,779 --> 02:04:10,819
I need the key.

1927
02:04:10,819 --> 02:04:11,619
Leave the corpse.

1928
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:19,380
What is this?

1929
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:19,939
What kind of...

1930
02:04:22,489 --> 02:04:23,210
What?

1931
02:04:23,210 --> 02:04:24,649
A weird door.

1932
02:04:24,649 --> 02:04:24,890
What?

1933
02:04:25,850 --> 02:04:26,569
That's...

1934
02:04:26,569 --> 02:04:26,890
Okay.

1935
02:04:27,449 --> 02:04:37,130
Just in case shit hits the absolute fan,

1936
02:04:37,130 --> 02:04:38,649
I have a save point back there.

1937
02:04:39,289 --> 02:04:40,039
All right.

1938
02:04:40,039 --> 02:04:43,079
I need to find the map in the officer's quarters.

1939
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:45,000
Find the evidence locker.

1940
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:49,239
Evidence locker.

1941
02:04:53,899 --> 02:04:54,460
Nothing in there.

1942
02:04:54,460 --> 02:04:54,859
All right.

1943
02:04:54,859 --> 02:04:55,100
Shit.

1944
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:55,420
Hold on.

1945
02:04:55,420 --> 02:05:01,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1946
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:03,239
Why does the prison have door locks?

1947
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:05,640
I don't know, dude.

1948
02:05:08,539 --> 02:05:09,020
What did you do?

1949
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:10,060
I'm needing to be distracted.

1950
02:05:10,539 --> 02:05:11,100
I want you to...

1951
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:13,180
What I want you to do is I want you to scream really loud

1952
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:14,380
when I walk over this way

1953
02:05:14,380 --> 02:05:16,060
so the guard will come over and I'll knock him out.

1954
02:05:44,630 --> 02:05:46,890
He's dead?

1955
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:50,699
Hey.

1956
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:52,890
Excellent job.

1957
02:05:53,529 --> 02:05:55,100
I was thinking about it.

1958
02:05:55,100 --> 02:05:55,420
No.

1959
02:05:55,420 --> 02:05:56,460
I can't zoom out, though.

1960
02:06:08,819 --> 02:06:09,380
Where is he?

1961
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:16,340
So...

1962
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:17,619
Oh, don't, dude.

1963
02:06:17,619 --> 02:06:18,420
Don't scare me like that.

1964
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:19,539
You're pretending to hold a weapon.

1965
02:06:19,539 --> 02:06:21,300
He's walking around holding a fake weapon.

1966
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:21,939
Get out of here.

1967
02:06:22,579 --> 02:06:35,510
All right.

1968
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:39,109
Get out.

1969
02:06:39,109 --> 02:06:39,590
Go for it.

1970
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:51,079
Let's get out of here.

1971
02:06:51,079 --> 02:06:51,880
Everybody, get out.

1972
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:53,560
Everybody, get out.

1973
02:06:54,199 --> 02:06:57,100
It's everywhere for himself.

1974
02:06:57,659 --> 02:07:02,699
Where's the guard quarters?

1975
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:07,739
No, we can take them.

1976
02:07:07,739 --> 02:07:08,460
We can take them.

1977
02:07:09,020 --> 02:07:09,819
We can take them.

1978
02:07:10,460 --> 02:07:31,720
I don't know why I did that.

1979
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:33,319
I just pressed it like an idiot.

1980
02:07:33,319 --> 02:07:33,640
Okay.

1981
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:34,520
All right, all right, all right, all right.

1982
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:35,560
Where's the guard's quarters?

1983
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:42,920
Over here.

1984
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:43,399
You all right?

1985
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:45,529
You're smart.

1986
02:07:45,529 --> 02:07:46,250
This is a smart one.

1987
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:52,020
You need a weapon.

1988
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:53,060
You don't have a weapon.

1989
02:07:53,060 --> 02:07:53,939
You don't have a weapon.

1990
02:07:54,579 --> 02:07:54,979
You don't...

1991
02:07:54,979 --> 02:07:56,340
You need to get away from me, though.

1992
02:07:56,340 --> 02:07:57,380
You have to leave me alone.

1993
02:07:58,949 --> 02:07:59,590
Yes.

1994
02:07:59,590 --> 02:08:00,710
It's good to see you.

1995
02:08:00,710 --> 02:08:01,510
Very nice to meet you.

1996
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:01,909
This is...

1997
02:08:01,909 --> 02:08:02,229
Okay.

1998
02:08:02,869 --> 02:08:03,510
Save me.

1999
02:08:04,229 --> 02:08:05,510
There's someone here.

2000
02:08:05,510 --> 02:08:06,149
Stay with me.

2001
02:08:07,189 --> 02:08:07,750
Ooh.

2002
02:08:07,750 --> 02:08:08,390
Stay with me.

2003
02:08:14,739 --> 02:08:25,130
I just let him out of prison.

2004
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:26,569
I just broke him out of prison.

2005
02:08:26,569 --> 02:08:28,010
And he's screaming assassin.

2006
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:32,710
I'm sorry.

2007
02:08:32,710 --> 02:08:33,430
That was fucked up.

2008
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:42,659
All right.

2009
02:08:42,659 --> 02:08:43,300
Where...

2010
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:45,699
I got a barracks in officer's quarters.

2011
02:08:45,699 --> 02:08:46,260
Wait, what?

2012
02:08:46,979 --> 02:08:54,420
I can write on this?

2013
02:08:54,420 --> 02:09:12,300
I gotta head this way.

2014
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:17,779
So I have to go down.

2015
02:09:17,779 --> 02:09:20,180
And then across.

2016
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:21,300
I don't know where the hell I'm going.

2017
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:22,420
I need to drink a health potion, though.

2018
02:09:23,060 --> 02:09:28,810
Officers quarters.

2019
02:09:28,810 --> 02:09:30,329
Officers cell block one.

2020
02:09:30,329 --> 02:09:31,130
Officers quarters.

2021
02:09:31,689 --> 02:09:37,000
All right.

2022
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:37,800
Cell block one.

2023
02:09:38,439 --> 02:09:39,960
Which is across the way.

2024
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:58,569
Link, can I just go through this door?

2025
02:10:01,609 --> 02:10:10,939
All right.

2026
02:10:10,939 --> 02:10:11,979
Cell block three.

2027
02:10:12,539 --> 02:10:13,659
I gotta get to cell block one.

2028
02:10:15,210 --> 02:10:17,289
Cell block one was on the other side.

2029
02:10:20,090 --> 02:10:20,890
Oh, shit.

2030
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:22,569
And how...

2031
02:10:22,569 --> 02:10:25,210
Explain to me how you saw me, you piece of crap.

2032
02:10:37,079 --> 02:10:48,069
Don't hit your head on the ceiling.

2033
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:50,939
Cell block one.

2034
02:10:50,939 --> 02:10:51,979
One, one, one, one, one, one.

2035
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:02,779
Leave me the fuck alone.

2036
02:11:05,140 --> 02:11:05,779
Leave me alone.

2037
02:11:05,779 --> 02:11:06,500
This guy chased me.

2038
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:07,539
What's the aggro range?

2039
02:11:07,539 --> 02:11:07,939
Leave me...

2040
02:11:07,939 --> 02:11:09,140
Get away from me.

2041
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:09,859
Leave me alone.

2042
02:11:16,890 --> 02:11:18,970
This guy is seriously a superhero.

2043
02:11:18,970 --> 02:11:19,930
Get away from me.

2044
02:11:20,649 --> 02:11:38,520
Why would I even start...

2045
02:11:55,850 --> 02:11:59,989
I know where to go.

2046
02:12:05,770 --> 02:12:16,729
Do no emotion.

2047
02:12:17,289 --> 02:12:20,600
This is a stream sniper.

2048
02:12:34,619 --> 02:12:35,260
No emotion.

2049
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:36,060
Should I do no emotion?

2050
02:12:36,060 --> 02:12:36,380
I can't...

2051
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:37,420
I'm just trying to concentrate.

2052
02:12:37,420 --> 02:12:38,970
This game's hard.

2053
02:12:38,970 --> 02:12:39,689
Stop singing.

2054
02:12:39,689 --> 02:12:40,729
Why is everybody singing?

2055
02:12:40,729 --> 02:12:43,500
All right.

2056
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:44,140
Here we go.

2057
02:12:44,140 --> 02:12:46,619
I don't have somebody chasing me now.

2058
02:12:46,619 --> 02:12:48,300
I can get to cell block one from here.

2059
02:12:49,100 --> 02:12:54,890
It's a scary game.

2060
02:12:54,890 --> 02:12:55,689
It's kind of scary.

2061
02:12:56,250 --> 02:12:56,489
All right.

2062
02:12:56,489 --> 02:12:56,970
Here we go.

2063
02:12:58,659 --> 02:12:59,300
Get through this.

2064
02:13:02,329 --> 02:13:03,369
Wait till it turns off.

2065
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:06,939
You got like a two second window.

2066
02:13:06,939 --> 02:13:07,180
One.

2067
02:13:08,739 --> 02:13:09,460
Did you see that bait?

2068
02:13:09,460 --> 02:13:10,020
What was that?

2069
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:13,159
Okay.

2070
02:13:14,260 --> 02:13:15,220
Oh, my goodness.

2071
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:15,619
I'm fine.

2072
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:17,239
All right.

2073
02:13:17,239 --> 02:13:18,279
Save it right here.

2074
02:13:18,279 --> 02:13:19,159
Drink a health potion.

2075
02:13:19,159 --> 02:13:19,640
I'm ready to go.

2076
02:13:21,479 --> 02:13:22,760
You just heard me gulp that.

2077
02:13:23,319 --> 02:13:24,199
You just heard me drink.

2078
02:13:26,659 --> 02:13:27,619
You got to be kidding me.

2079
02:13:35,380 --> 02:13:36,659
That would be so scary.

2080
02:13:38,810 --> 02:13:40,729
If you're just in like a pitch black area.

2081
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:43,300
And all you hear is this.

2082
02:13:46,810 --> 02:13:56,069
Okay.

2083
02:13:56,069 --> 02:13:56,630
Save it here.

2084
02:13:59,939 --> 02:14:00,819
Cell block one.

2085
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:03,659
And to the barracks.

2086
02:14:03,659 --> 02:14:13,210
All right.

2087
02:14:13,210 --> 02:14:14,090
No more alarm.

2088
02:14:14,729 --> 02:14:15,449
Finally.

2089
02:14:15,449 --> 02:14:18,100
I can take this guy out.

2090
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:19,670
What happened?

2091
02:14:19,670 --> 02:14:20,550
What's going on?

2092
02:14:20,550 --> 02:14:21,050
What?

2093
02:14:21,289 --> 02:14:24,520
Stay in shadow.

2094
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:26,279
Did he just turn the alarm back on?

2095
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:37,420
I think he just got himself stuck.

2096
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:39,930
All right.

2097
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:42,060
We're good.

2098
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:44,140
Cell block one is this way.

2099
02:14:50,619 --> 02:14:52,220
Bring this over here so nobody hears it.

2100
02:14:52,779 --> 02:14:59,500
I got to go get the map.

2101
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:07,869
Okay.

2102
02:15:08,430 --> 02:15:08,989
Up here.

2103
02:15:08,989 --> 02:15:10,989
Barracks offers his quarters straight ahead.

2104
02:15:10,989 --> 02:15:13,500
I just have to sneak through with the shadows.

2105
02:15:17,439 --> 02:15:28,319
Let's have a good bad gamer neck there for a second.

2106
02:15:28,319 --> 02:15:37,739
Here we go.

2107
02:15:38,699 --> 02:15:43,149
The barracks.

2108
02:15:43,789 --> 02:15:47,720
Hit it again.

2109
02:15:48,279 --> 02:15:57,739
All right.

2110
02:15:57,739 --> 02:15:58,619
Where are we at?

2111
02:15:58,619 --> 02:16:04,649
Is it in here?

2112
02:16:04,649 --> 02:16:06,010
Oh, carpet, carpet, carpet, carpet, carpet.

2113
02:16:06,010 --> 02:16:11,739
I didn't want to pick this.

2114
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:23,789
Not hidden.

2115
02:16:23,789 --> 02:16:30,649
Who is that?

2116
02:16:30,649 --> 02:16:31,050
Who is that?

2117
02:16:31,050 --> 02:16:31,529
Who is that?

2118
02:16:31,529 --> 02:16:32,329
A prince?

2119
02:16:32,329 --> 02:16:33,129
Who is that guy?

2120
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:52,190
Got anything on you?

2121
02:16:52,190 --> 02:16:52,670
Oh, shit.

2122
02:16:52,670 --> 02:16:52,829
Nice.

2123
02:16:52,829 --> 02:17:00,270
There's tons of stuff in here.

2124
02:17:00,270 --> 02:17:00,750
All right.

2125
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:01,790
I'm going to...

2126
02:17:01,790 --> 02:17:02,829
These are all the guards' quarters.

2127
02:17:07,739 --> 02:17:08,299
Knife.

2128
02:17:08,299 --> 02:17:44,649
Give me a knife.

2129
02:17:44,649 --> 02:17:46,250
Looking for the map now.

2130
02:17:46,250 --> 02:17:47,389
Wherever that is.

2131
02:17:47,389 --> 02:17:47,950
Hold on.

2132
02:17:47,950 --> 02:17:48,989
I came in through here.

2133
02:17:48,989 --> 02:17:57,500
How do I not have full health after eating all that?

2134
02:17:57,500 --> 02:17:58,059
All right.

2135
02:17:58,059 --> 02:18:01,149
I explored all the quarters.

2136
02:18:01,149 --> 02:18:04,649
Here we go.

2137
02:18:04,649 --> 02:18:06,409
I don't know who this person was.

2138
02:18:06,409 --> 02:18:12,569
I'm coming.

2139
02:18:19,159 --> 02:18:20,120
I'm going to throw the knife in his neck.

2140
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:21,819
Can I think I can hit it from here?

2141
02:18:26,969 --> 02:18:27,370
Nope.

2142
02:18:27,370 --> 02:18:28,090
But it don't matter.

2143
02:18:28,090 --> 02:18:37,840
I'll get him.

2144
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:39,520
He just baited me, but I still hit him in the head.

2145
02:18:39,520 --> 02:18:40,079
Okay.

2146
02:18:40,079 --> 02:18:51,180
I don't even know who this person is.

2147
02:18:51,180 --> 02:18:52,840
Does he have a key or something?

2148
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:53,559
It doesn't look like it.

2149
02:18:53,559 --> 02:18:58,350
He's throwing a handle first.

2150
02:18:58,350 --> 02:18:59,950
It's not going to kill anybody.

2151
02:18:59,950 --> 02:19:12,190
Is somebody walking?

2152
02:19:12,829 --> 02:19:22,569
Where is this map?

2153
02:19:23,899 --> 02:19:26,139
Find the evidence locker in the tree...

2154
02:19:26,139 --> 02:19:27,420
Evidence locker in the...

2155
02:19:27,420 --> 02:19:28,459
Am I going too far?

2156
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:35,920
This guy's got magical powers.

2157
02:19:41,959 --> 02:19:57,209
There's a lot of talking, but he's got magic powers.

2158
02:19:58,090 --> 02:20:05,899
Is this a spell book?

2159
02:20:06,459 --> 02:20:10,360
When I was cold, thou taught of hearth in roof beam.

2160
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:13,319
When I was hungry, thou taught of pot and cauldron.

2161
02:20:13,319 --> 02:20:16,040
When I was beset by foes, thou taught of spear and shield.

2162
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:20,520
Thy hammer pounds thy nail, holds the roof beam.

2163
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:22,760
Thy hammer strikes the iron, shapes the cauldron.

2164
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:25,159
Thy hammer in my hand, unto my foes.

2165
02:20:27,719 --> 02:20:29,079
I think I had fire powers.

2166
02:20:30,809 --> 02:20:32,010
These magic potions?

2167
02:20:34,940 --> 02:20:37,049
Okay.

2168
02:20:37,049 --> 02:20:38,010
Wait a minute.

2169
02:20:38,010 --> 02:20:42,670
Do I need to bring a hammer here in front of the door?

2170
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:52,639
I hope not.

2171
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:56,959
Still walking around here.

2172
02:20:56,959 --> 02:20:58,479
Hopefully I'm able to get to the next part.

2173
02:21:06,170 --> 02:21:07,129
What are these hammers?

2174
02:21:07,770 --> 02:21:18,559
Oh, I found a hammer.

2175
02:21:30,969 --> 02:21:31,469
What?

2176
02:21:41,739 --> 02:21:42,700
Holy shit, diamonds.

2177
02:21:45,149 --> 02:21:46,270
Oh, I got it.

2178
02:21:46,270 --> 02:21:49,399
All right.

2179
02:21:49,399 --> 02:21:51,610
I got it.

2180
02:21:51,610 --> 02:21:55,770
It was right there.

2181
02:21:55,770 --> 02:21:56,489
All right.

2182
02:21:56,489 --> 02:21:58,120
I couldn't save Cuddy.

2183
02:21:58,120 --> 02:21:59,079
I think that's scripted though.

2184
02:22:18,139 --> 02:22:24,360
The man-fools piled rock on rocks and raised a treacy roof.

2185
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:31,870
Hammer saws tear the skin of goodsy wood and laughs at the woodsy lord.

2186
02:22:31,870 --> 02:22:38,829
And when learns of the lord of this, he sends his beasties to the man-fools

2187
02:22:38,829 --> 02:22:41,709
who attacks and hammer saws their useless flesh.

2188
02:22:42,350 --> 02:22:45,639
And build him a house of thy rotting skins.

2189
02:22:46,520 --> 02:22:50,360
I was pissed at Cuddy for a good one.

2190
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:54,030
But hey, I gotta like stand up.

2191
02:22:54,030 --> 02:22:55,629
I like him for what the hammers did to him.

2192
02:22:55,629 --> 02:22:56,909
It sort of like stuck to him.

2193
02:22:56,909 --> 02:23:00,190
So I decided to go after that horn that Felix talked about.

2194
02:23:00,190 --> 02:23:02,510
Not like I had a whole lot of choice, really.

2195
02:23:02,510 --> 02:23:03,870
The rent is due.

2196
02:23:03,870 --> 02:23:05,040
The landlord's...

2197
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:05,760
Manslide!

2198
02:23:06,639 --> 02:23:07,280
Man-filth!

2199
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:09,680
The map's pretty specific about where the entrance is.

2200
02:23:10,479 --> 02:23:12,959
Too bad it's not as clear about where the horn is.

2201
02:23:14,079 --> 02:23:16,079
Felix did some scrounging before he left

2202
02:23:16,079 --> 02:23:18,799
and his notes say the horn is in the tomb of some nobles.

2203
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:21,040
The Aquintus family.

2204
02:23:22,079 --> 02:23:23,520
Guess I'll just have to explore.

2205
02:23:25,309 --> 02:23:26,190
Felix.

2206
02:23:26,190 --> 02:23:27,389
Always helpful.

2207
02:23:27,389 --> 02:23:30,030
Also said that the catacombs are supposed to be haunted.

2208
02:23:30,909 --> 02:23:31,229
Great.

2209
02:23:31,229 --> 02:23:34,190
I think I'll go make some inquiries about where a heretic like me

2210
02:23:34,190 --> 02:23:35,629
can get some holy water.

2211
02:23:36,829 --> 02:23:38,670
I'll always go prepared.

2212
02:23:38,670 --> 02:23:39,870
Filthy man thing.

2213
02:23:42,030 --> 02:23:43,229
Uh, should I go pee?

2214
02:23:43,229 --> 02:23:44,030
Should we take a pee break?

2215
02:23:44,670 --> 02:23:50,600
Search through the ancient bone hoard and procure the legendary horn of Quintus.

2216
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:53,200
Let me just get a good save point here.

2217
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:54,319
Oh wait, let me spend some money.

2218
02:23:57,770 --> 02:23:59,129
These are pretty useful.

2219
02:23:59,129 --> 02:23:59,850
So I want some.

2220
02:24:02,360 --> 02:24:03,959
That's way too expensive.

2221
02:24:03,959 --> 02:24:05,879
Never mind, I'd rather have the alarm get set off

2222
02:24:05,879 --> 02:24:06,920
than spend that much money.

2223
02:24:09,399 --> 02:24:10,680
Water arrows.

2224
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:13,129
50 rope arrows.

2225
02:24:13,129 --> 02:24:13,450
Okay.

2226
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:16,139
I want health.

2227
02:24:16,860 --> 02:24:17,979
It's so much more important to me.

2228
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:19,920
Holy water.

2229
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:22,399
This vial of hammer-sanctified liquid.

2230
02:24:22,879 --> 02:24:25,840
It's potent protection against the undead when used on your water arrows.

2231
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:26,559
I have a few of them.

2232
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:30,159
Maybe I'll get more of these, yeah.

2233
02:24:30,879 --> 02:24:34,329
Okay, I don't want to...

2234
02:24:34,329 --> 02:24:35,049
I gotta be careful.

2235
02:24:35,690 --> 02:24:39,069
The money's about previous missions.

2236
02:24:39,069 --> 02:24:39,709
That's pretty cool.

2237
02:24:40,270 --> 02:24:41,770
This game's fun.

2238
02:24:41,770 --> 02:24:42,250
I like this game.

2239
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:49,559
I'm gonna save it right here.

2240
02:24:49,559 --> 02:24:50,680
I'm gonna take a quick pee break.

2241
02:24:51,239 --> 02:24:54,479
I'll be right back.

2242
02:24:57,069 --> 02:24:58,190
You know, it's not...

2243
02:24:58,190 --> 02:25:01,309
I know it's like January 10th or whatever.

2244
02:25:01,309 --> 02:25:03,930
How about the Christmas one one more time?

2245
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:04,649
What do you think?

2246
02:25:04,649 --> 02:25:06,319
Christmas one one more time?

2247
02:25:10,860 --> 02:25:11,739
Yeah, oh yeah.

2248
02:25:11,739 --> 02:25:12,940
Yeah.

2249
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:13,579
All right.

2250
02:25:13,579 --> 02:25:15,290
I'll see you guys in two minutes.

2251
02:25:15,290 --> 02:25:16,489
I'm just gonna go pee real quick.

2252
02:25:17,290 --> 02:25:17,930
Grab some water.

2253
02:25:18,489 --> 02:25:32,440
See you guys in a minute.

2254
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:33,159
Oops.

2255
02:25:33,159 --> 02:25:34,120
All right, we're good.

2256
02:25:34,120 --> 02:30:14,700
Beer B.

2257
02:30:14,700 --> 02:30:15,579
I have returned.

2258
02:30:21,100 --> 02:30:22,299
How are you doing?

2259
02:30:22,299 --> 02:30:26,489
Are you a Raiders fan ever since you went to Vegas?

2260
02:30:29,629 --> 02:30:31,549
I never really was a football fan to begin with.

2261
02:30:31,549 --> 02:30:36,010
I think it's cool.

2262
02:30:36,010 --> 02:30:40,319
I really kind of feel bad for Oakland though.

2263
02:30:40,319 --> 02:30:42,799
Because Vegas took the Raiders.

2264
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:45,600
And Vegas might take the A's too.

2265
02:30:47,639 --> 02:30:49,000
So that's kind of...

2266
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,610
I feel bad for Oakland.

2267
02:30:55,559 --> 02:30:56,840
Oh, we're doing sports talk now.

2268
02:30:57,399 --> 02:31:08,639
This is a prime 90s PC boomer game.

2269
02:31:08,639 --> 02:31:09,920
How did you not play it yet?

2270
02:31:10,639 --> 02:31:12,479
I'm telling you, it's been installed for like years.

2271
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:18,520
I just had to decide on a day to do it.

2272
02:31:19,559 --> 02:31:20,840
And I just put it in the poll.

2273
02:31:21,559 --> 02:31:24,000
All right, let's do it.

2274
02:31:24,639 --> 02:31:27,479
Did you wash your hands?

2275
02:31:27,479 --> 02:31:28,600
I always wash my hands.

2276
02:31:30,409 --> 02:31:30,809
Always.

2277
02:31:31,450 --> 02:31:39,770
Are you gonna do Thief 2 and Thief 3 as well?

2278
02:31:39,770 --> 02:31:40,409
I don't know.

2279
02:31:42,079 --> 02:31:43,280
That's actually a pretty good question.

2280
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:45,120
It really depends on how much I enjoy this one.

2281
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:46,799
Which so far I think it's pretty fun.

2282
02:31:46,879 --> 02:31:51,209
Bring the scary music back up.

2283
02:31:53,629 --> 02:31:54,350
Back to this.

2284
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:00,639
Thief 2.

2285
02:32:00,639 --> 02:32:02,399
Thief 2 is this but better.

2286
02:32:04,110 --> 02:32:05,719
Okay.

2287
02:32:05,719 --> 02:32:06,760
Reboot is trash.

2288
02:32:06,760 --> 02:32:07,319
Don't play it.

2289
02:32:08,489 --> 02:32:10,090
I kind of wanted to play this one anyways.

2290
02:32:10,809 --> 02:32:16,270
Add it to the list of old PC boomer games.

2291
02:32:16,270 --> 02:32:16,829
That's right.

2292
02:32:16,829 --> 02:32:18,190
Basecam or Outrage.

2293
02:32:21,850 --> 02:32:22,649
Wait a minute.

2294
02:32:22,649 --> 02:32:30,090
All right, so this one...

2295
02:32:30,090 --> 02:32:30,649
What are we gonna do?

2296
02:32:32,379 --> 02:32:33,979
Find the Horn of Quintus.

2297
02:32:34,940 --> 02:32:36,059
That's all the info I got.

2298
02:32:36,059 --> 02:32:37,100
And I have nothing else to go on.

2299
02:32:37,659 --> 02:32:38,620
This guy's gonna get up.

2300
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:40,219
Yep.

2301
02:32:40,219 --> 02:32:42,139
Who cares though?

2302
02:32:42,139 --> 02:32:42,639
What?

2303
02:32:43,850 --> 02:32:44,489
Do I really care?

2304
02:32:44,489 --> 02:32:44,809
Just...

2305
02:32:44,809 --> 02:32:45,850
I'm just gonna go.

2306
02:32:45,850 --> 02:32:46,090
Right?

2307
02:32:46,090 --> 02:32:46,889
Like he's gonna...

2308
02:32:47,450 --> 02:32:49,290
That was just a jump scare that didn't happen.

2309
02:32:49,290 --> 02:32:52,510
Kind of creepy.

2310
02:32:52,510 --> 02:32:53,229
All right.

2311
02:32:53,229 --> 02:32:57,790
Do I have any notes?

2312
02:32:59,309 --> 02:33:00,510
Mario family.

2313
02:33:00,510 --> 02:33:01,629
Halls of Echoing.

2314
02:33:01,629 --> 02:33:02,510
Repose.

2315
02:33:02,510 --> 02:33:03,469
Hammerite crypts.

2316
02:33:04,329 --> 02:33:05,370
Quintus family.

2317
02:33:05,370 --> 02:33:06,969
So we gotta go down.

2318
02:33:06,969 --> 02:33:08,090
Down and north.

2319
02:33:08,090 --> 02:33:13,120
I guess.

2320
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:19,079
Do you die from this?

2321
02:33:30,559 --> 02:33:31,040
Watch it.

2322
02:33:33,069 --> 02:33:33,549
I need...

2323
02:33:33,549 --> 02:33:35,069
Should I kill this thing with holy water?

2324
02:33:35,069 --> 02:33:35,790
Probably, right?

2325
02:33:43,450 --> 02:33:44,250
Fire!

2326
02:33:44,250 --> 02:33:50,280
Fire!

2327
02:33:50,280 --> 02:33:50,920
Anybody else quick?

2328
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:51,959
I only have 19 seconds.

2329
02:33:51,959 --> 02:33:53,000
Anybody else down here?

2330
02:33:53,000 --> 02:34:02,520
Oh, there's a goblet though.

2331
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:02,840
Nice.

2332
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:06,459
All right.

2333
02:34:06,459 --> 02:34:07,739
Oh, shit!

2334
02:34:07,739 --> 02:34:08,299
No!

2335
02:34:08,299 --> 02:34:09,260
That's bad.

2336
02:34:09,260 --> 02:34:10,780
I thought I was touching this.

2337
02:34:10,780 --> 02:34:11,899
I have to reload.

2338
02:34:11,899 --> 02:34:15,440
I thought I was touching...

2339
02:34:15,440 --> 02:34:16,159
Okay.

2340
02:34:16,159 --> 02:34:17,040
Sorry about that.

2341
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:25,959
I'm an idiot.

2342
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:37,040
All right.

2343
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:37,520
Here we go.

2344
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:38,479
Third time's the charm.

2345
02:34:38,479 --> 02:34:46,750
Shoot the arrow, please.

2346
02:34:47,549 --> 02:34:52,219
Anybody else down here?

2347
02:34:53,340 --> 02:34:53,979
I don't think so.

2348
02:34:59,200 --> 02:34:59,920
15 seconds.

2349
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:00,559
Any other enemies?

2350
02:35:00,559 --> 02:35:01,040
Come on.

2351
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:09,440
That's weird.

2352
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:12,120
Three seconds.

2353
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:12,440
Nothing.

2354
02:35:12,440 --> 02:35:12,920
All right.

2355
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:19,610
So I guess I'm just gonna keep going.

2356
02:35:19,610 --> 02:35:20,729
Argoil wall?

2357
02:35:20,729 --> 02:35:23,280
All right.

2358
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:27,399
Diving board.

2359
02:35:27,399 --> 02:35:36,090
What are your thoughts on...

2360
02:35:36,090 --> 02:35:37,209
Alaris.

2361
02:35:37,209 --> 02:35:43,600
Alaris.

2362
02:35:44,459 --> 02:35:45,260
Does that mean anything?

2363
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:53,149
All right.

2364
02:35:53,149 --> 02:36:02,430
I'm still in the upper vaults.

2365
02:36:02,430 --> 02:36:03,069
Ooh.

2366
02:36:03,069 --> 02:36:05,579
Very useful.

2367
02:36:05,579 --> 02:36:06,059
All right.

2368
02:36:06,059 --> 02:36:07,020
I got 30 seconds now.

2369
02:36:07,020 --> 02:36:09,229
I'm gonna be some monsters right here.

2370
02:36:09,229 --> 02:36:10,110
Guaranteed.

2371
02:36:10,110 --> 02:36:13,389
Crap door.

2372
02:36:13,389 --> 02:36:26,959
Don't stand on that.

2373
02:36:26,959 --> 02:36:27,600
Oh.

2374
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:30,559
I thought it was gonna fall.

2375
02:36:30,559 --> 02:36:47,040
Is this gonna be over my head?

2376
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:48,799
All right.

2377
02:36:48,799 --> 02:36:49,440
Got it.

2378
02:36:49,440 --> 02:36:50,159
So, wait.

2379
02:36:50,159 --> 02:36:56,000
Will this shoot over my head?

2380
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:03,600
It is.

2381
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:04,159
Okay.

2382
02:37:04,159 --> 02:37:08,200
Is this just a depressing box?

2383
02:37:08,200 --> 02:37:14,909
I think so.

2384
02:37:14,909 --> 02:37:15,069
Okay.

2385
02:37:15,069 --> 02:37:18,860
I thought it was gonna fall.

2386
02:37:18,860 --> 02:37:20,219
Well, that's why I need the holy water.

2387
02:37:20,219 --> 02:37:24,700
Gotta go back and get it free.

2388
02:37:24,700 --> 02:37:26,700
All right.

2389
02:37:26,700 --> 02:37:27,260
Here we go.

2390
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:27,979
Save it.

2391
02:37:27,979 --> 02:37:30,540
And...

2392
02:37:30,540 --> 02:37:31,180
All right.

2393
02:37:31,180 --> 02:37:47,770
Well, I got you.

2394
02:37:48,250 --> 02:37:54,969
Grab it.

2395
02:37:54,969 --> 02:37:55,770
All right.

2396
02:37:55,770 --> 02:37:56,729
Nothing else in here?

2397
02:37:56,729 --> 02:38:01,200
Why is the body exploding so funny?

2398
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:01,520
I don't know.

2399
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:02,159
It just is.

2400
02:38:02,159 --> 02:38:03,899
Nothing about it.

2401
02:38:03,899 --> 02:38:12,219
Upper vaults north.

2402
02:38:12,219 --> 02:38:16,479
Should I go down here?

2403
02:38:16,479 --> 02:38:21,040
Or deeper into the crypts?

2404
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:21,680
What do you think?

2405
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:23,950
How is it not funny?

2406
02:38:23,950 --> 02:38:24,190
I know.

2407
02:38:24,190 --> 02:38:24,909
It just is.

2408
02:38:24,909 --> 02:38:29,639
Is there any other holy water things over here?

2409
02:38:29,639 --> 02:38:31,600
These are both gonna get up.

2410
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:32,319
Guaranteed.

2411
02:38:32,319 --> 02:38:37,309
Let me just see if this...

2412
02:38:37,309 --> 02:38:38,510
There might be a well right here.

2413
02:38:38,510 --> 02:38:39,760
No, there's not.

2414
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:40,000
All right.

2415
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:41,690
Well, do I need to kill these things

2416
02:38:41,690 --> 02:38:42,649
or can I just run away?

2417
02:38:42,649 --> 02:38:46,010
Yeah.

2418
02:38:46,010 --> 02:38:46,969
There's no reason to.

2419
02:38:46,969 --> 02:38:47,530
Just leave.

2420
02:38:47,530 --> 02:38:48,559
Just leave.

2421
02:38:48,559 --> 02:38:48,959
All right.

2422
02:38:48,959 --> 02:38:54,860
Let's go in here.

2423
02:38:54,860 --> 02:38:55,659
Neck light?

2424
02:38:55,739 --> 02:38:59,040
I mean, neck light.

2425
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:04,200
Have I ever worn an apron before?

2426
02:39:05,799 --> 02:39:07,399
Maybe when I was barbecuing.

2427
02:39:08,620 --> 02:39:10,059
I was probably barbecuing somewhere

2428
02:39:10,059 --> 02:39:11,420
thinking it was funny.

2429
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:13,659
Like, oh, here I am, the chef.

2430
02:39:13,659 --> 02:39:15,920
Nobody wants to be that guy, by the way.

2431
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:19,040
You know how much panic I have

2432
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:22,959
if I ever am the guy that is in charge of the grill?

2433
02:39:22,959 --> 02:39:24,239
The whole time, I'm just like,

2434
02:39:27,159 --> 02:39:28,040
everyone's gonna get poisoned.

2435
02:39:30,170 --> 02:39:31,049
Is that cooked enough?

2436
02:39:31,049 --> 02:39:31,770
I'm gonna kill somebody.

2437
02:39:32,489 --> 02:39:36,670
Is that too red in the middle?

2438
02:39:36,670 --> 02:39:37,469
Someone's gonna die.

2439
02:39:37,469 --> 02:39:38,350
Someone's gonna die.

2440
02:39:38,350 --> 02:39:39,389
Someone's gonna get too sick.

2441
02:39:39,389 --> 02:39:39,950
No, just me.

2442
02:39:39,950 --> 02:39:41,549
And then I overcook everything.

2443
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:44,639
I have to kill this guy.

2444
02:39:49,979 --> 02:39:50,620
That's raw.

2445
02:39:50,620 --> 02:39:52,059
And those chicken wings are raw.

2446
02:39:52,059 --> 02:39:54,120
I can't serve them.

2447
02:39:54,120 --> 02:39:56,840
And then I always, if I'm ever in charge of...

2448
02:39:56,840 --> 02:39:57,719
Anytime you cook anything,

2449
02:39:58,909 --> 02:40:00,430
I always want to eat it first.

2450
02:40:01,659 --> 02:40:04,620
I'm gonna be my own tester for my own food, right?

2451
02:40:05,639 --> 02:40:06,200
You missed?

2452
02:40:08,719 --> 02:40:11,520
So like, the food's not ready yet.

2453
02:40:12,239 --> 02:40:13,840
Hey, when do you think the food's gonna be ready?

2454
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:18,750
Well, maybe 20 minutes.

2455
02:40:18,750 --> 02:40:19,229
We'll see.

2456
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:23,559
Because if I get sick, then I know, right?

2457
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:28,719
So nobody eat it.

2458
02:40:32,299 --> 02:40:32,940
What was even in here?

2459
02:40:36,680 --> 02:40:38,120
You just ate raw food.

2460
02:40:38,120 --> 02:40:40,120
No, I'm just saying, I always want to make sure

2461
02:40:40,120 --> 02:40:42,829
I don't make anybody sick or anything.

2462
02:40:42,829 --> 02:40:44,270
And it can be really...

2463
02:40:44,270 --> 02:40:44,909
Where am I?

2464
02:40:47,709 --> 02:40:48,590
Wait, did I just go in a circle?

2465
02:40:50,959 --> 02:40:52,799
Whenever you have a guy at the grill

2466
02:40:52,799 --> 02:40:55,520
and you have like 15 hamburger patties on there,

2467
02:40:56,760 --> 02:40:57,239
it can be...

2468
02:40:57,799 --> 02:40:58,520
I don't know.

2469
02:40:58,520 --> 02:41:00,520
You can't really focus on one patty.

2470
02:41:01,079 --> 02:41:03,209
So you have to really make sure

2471
02:41:03,209 --> 02:41:04,889
that everything is cooked correctly

2472
02:41:04,889 --> 02:41:05,450
and everything's...

2473
02:41:06,250 --> 02:41:07,770
Why are you guys saying neck light?

2474
02:41:08,329 --> 02:41:13,159
I don't get this.

2475
02:41:13,159 --> 02:41:15,600
What are you doing?

2476
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:16,399
Back in the water?

2477
02:41:16,959 --> 02:41:21,450
Put the light on your neck.

2478
02:41:21,450 --> 02:41:22,329
It's not gonna fit.

2479
02:41:25,530 --> 02:41:35,870
Okay, no, no, I gotta go back down.

2480
02:41:35,870 --> 02:41:36,670
No, you guys are gonna...

2481
02:41:36,670 --> 02:41:37,870
This is gonna turn into a cartoon.

2482
02:41:38,430 --> 02:41:43,290
Go this way?

2483
02:41:43,290 --> 02:41:45,360
Do I have enough breath to do this?

2484
02:41:45,360 --> 02:41:53,239
Where is this taking me?

2485
02:41:53,239 --> 02:41:53,959
It'll fit, trust me.

2486
02:41:53,959 --> 02:41:55,000
I'm an engineer.

2487
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:02,940
Am I going?

2488
02:42:02,940 --> 02:42:11,520
Leave it open so you know where you've been.

2489
02:42:12,079 --> 02:42:14,250
Where the hell am I supposed to go?

2490
02:42:14,889 --> 02:42:19,049
All right, I went right and down,

2491
02:42:19,049 --> 02:42:20,649
so now I'm just gonna go over?

2492
02:42:20,649 --> 02:42:25,420
What do I hear?

2493
02:42:25,420 --> 02:42:26,059
Sleigh bells.

2494
02:42:26,700 --> 02:42:39,200
This is kind of creepy.

2495
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:40,239
All right, wait, I see.

2496
02:42:40,239 --> 02:42:42,649
I see the cannon.

2497
02:42:42,649 --> 02:42:44,989
Yeah, you think you're so funny.

2498
02:42:44,989 --> 02:42:46,459
Nope, sorry.

2499
02:42:55,719 --> 02:42:56,600
I think I just drank all my potions.

2500
02:42:56,600 --> 02:42:57,239
No, I didn't.

2501
02:42:57,239 --> 02:43:04,459
Okay, so how do I get through here?

2502
02:43:04,459 --> 02:43:10,110
You promised all of things.

2503
02:43:10,110 --> 02:43:11,229
I did it in the very beginning of the stream

2504
02:43:11,229 --> 02:43:12,270
and it was stupid.

2505
02:43:12,270 --> 02:43:17,979
I couldn't even get three on my hand.

2506
02:43:17,979 --> 02:43:18,540
You...

2507
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:30,399
All right, we're going down to wherever like...

2508
02:43:36,110 --> 02:43:37,069
We're going down here.

2509
02:43:37,069 --> 02:43:57,629
Oh, don't touch that, right?

2510
02:43:57,629 --> 02:43:58,989
Is this gonna do something if I touch it?

2511
02:43:58,989 --> 02:44:03,280
This looks lower, right?

2512
02:44:03,280 --> 02:44:04,159
There's a lip here.

2513
02:44:04,159 --> 02:44:05,280
Does that mean anything?

2514
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:08,860
Washrooms.

2515
02:44:08,860 --> 02:44:13,950
I can't pick them up.

2516
02:44:13,950 --> 02:44:35,120
This feels like Castle Gryphonsteed.

2517
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:37,040
What is that thing?

2518
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:38,639
What is that thing?

2519
02:44:38,639 --> 02:44:43,530
I gotta try to drop this on his head.

2520
02:44:43,530 --> 02:44:50,829
I'm by again.

2521
02:44:50,829 --> 02:44:51,229
Does this even...

2522
02:44:51,229 --> 02:45:09,200
Can you even hurt enemies with this stuff?

2523
02:45:09,360 --> 02:45:25,309
I don't like those sounds.

2524
02:45:25,309 --> 02:45:26,030
Relax, shut up.

2525
02:45:26,030 --> 02:45:35,120
Does this hurt?

2526
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:41,020
This looks like one of those guys

2527
02:45:41,020 --> 02:45:43,340
in those inflatable T-Rex costumes.

2528
02:45:43,340 --> 02:46:06,670
It's like a pig and a...

2529
02:46:06,670 --> 02:46:07,629
I don't want to hurt it.

2530
02:46:07,629 --> 02:46:08,030
I don't...

2531
02:46:08,030 --> 02:46:09,790
I wish I could just say I'm not gonna hurt you,

2532
02:46:09,790 --> 02:46:24,329
but it's not gonna let me pass.

2533
02:46:24,329 --> 02:46:24,889
Jump!

2534
02:46:24,889 --> 02:46:36,780
I'm sorry, I had to.

2535
02:46:36,780 --> 02:46:39,840
It's because you threw a boulder at it.

2536
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:40,479
I don't know.

2537
02:46:40,479 --> 02:46:41,920
It was trying to get me.

2538
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:51,819
I'm coloring...

2539
02:46:51,819 --> 02:46:53,340
I'm coloring a cat coloring book.

2540
02:46:53,340 --> 02:46:54,540
What's your favorite cat?

2541
02:46:54,540 --> 02:46:55,959
I don't know.

2542
02:46:55,959 --> 02:46:56,840
I think cats are cool.

2543
02:46:56,840 --> 02:47:04,440
Oh shit, here comes the whole family.

2544
02:47:07,209 --> 02:47:08,620
Okay.

2545
02:47:08,620 --> 02:47:09,579
Where am I?

2546
02:47:09,659 --> 02:47:15,129
Why is there a little arrow scratched over here?

2547
02:47:15,129 --> 02:47:15,610
What?

2548
02:47:15,610 --> 02:47:22,059
I'm gonna follow the arrow.

2549
02:47:22,059 --> 02:47:28,219
I'm kind of scared to do this.

2550
02:47:28,219 --> 02:47:42,479
Okay.

2551
02:47:42,479 --> 02:47:42,719
Where...

2552
02:47:42,719 --> 02:47:43,920
I still don't know where I am.

2553
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:52,520
I think I made it.

2554
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:58,559
Is this it?

2555
02:47:58,559 --> 02:47:59,040
Watch out.

2556
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:00,079
There's all these things everywhere.

2557
02:48:00,079 --> 02:48:00,719
Be careful.

2558
02:48:00,719 --> 02:48:08,440
If I crouch, it's fine, right?

2559
02:48:08,440 --> 02:48:11,360
Yeah, just stay crouched.

2560
02:48:11,360 --> 02:48:11,680
Ah!

2561
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:12,079
The back...

2562
02:48:12,719 --> 02:48:16,440
B-boom!

2563
02:48:16,440 --> 02:48:17,239
This is dead.

2564
02:48:18,750 --> 02:48:26,079
Maybe right in the back of that.

2565
02:48:26,079 --> 02:48:27,120
Don't push that down.

2566
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:29,549
All right, we got cheese.

2567
02:48:29,549 --> 02:48:30,590
Excuse me?

2568
02:48:30,590 --> 02:48:31,069
What?

2569
02:48:31,069 --> 02:48:38,399
He's right.

2570
02:48:38,399 --> 02:48:39,200
Bedroll?

2571
02:48:39,200 --> 02:48:49,930
What's this stuff?

2572
02:48:49,930 --> 02:48:51,049
Is dinosaur teeth or something?

2573
02:48:51,049 --> 02:48:51,770
What are those?

2574
02:48:51,770 --> 02:49:01,309
Speed potion.

2575
02:49:01,309 --> 02:49:03,639
Fire arrow is...

2576
02:49:03,639 --> 02:49:04,280
Oh, nice.

2577
02:49:04,280 --> 02:49:04,920
All right.

2578
02:49:04,920 --> 02:49:05,319
Cool.

2579
02:49:05,319 --> 02:49:30,479
All right, be careful here getting out.

2580
02:49:30,479 --> 02:49:33,629
All right, nice.

2581
02:49:33,629 --> 02:49:34,510
That got me that.

2582
02:49:34,510 --> 02:49:35,469
So now I gotta go the other way.

2583
02:49:35,469 --> 02:49:37,360
All right.

2584
02:49:37,360 --> 02:49:38,879
Can you throw up on stream, chat?

2585
02:49:38,879 --> 02:49:40,079
No, I'm not gonna throw up on stream.

2586
02:49:40,079 --> 02:49:41,360
Ha ha, vomit's all over the place.

2587
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:45,000
That you thought it was funny?

2588
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:52,489
Okay.

2589
02:49:52,489 --> 02:49:55,690
So now I gotta take these...

2590
02:49:55,690 --> 02:49:56,569
I gotta change pants.

2591
02:49:56,569 --> 02:50:10,590
I probably don't understand the concept here of climbing.

2592
02:50:10,590 --> 02:50:11,469
I think you just have to hold it.

2593
02:50:17,069 --> 02:50:22,520
I gotta be ready.

2594
02:50:22,520 --> 02:50:23,559
All over the place here.

2595
02:50:23,559 --> 02:50:24,040
Where...

2596
02:50:24,040 --> 02:50:25,639
Yeah, where am I actually going?

2597
02:50:25,639 --> 02:50:36,040
Down...

2598
02:50:36,040 --> 02:50:36,760
Okay.

2599
02:50:36,760 --> 02:50:39,680
There's dinosaurs down here.

2600
02:50:39,680 --> 02:50:41,260
I don't want...

2601
02:50:41,260 --> 02:50:43,180
I want to try to avoid them if I can.

2602
02:50:43,180 --> 02:50:47,840
Fire arrows on the dinosaurs?

2603
02:50:57,309 --> 02:50:58,110
Wait, did I kill that?

2604
02:50:58,110 --> 02:51:13,159
No, I didn't.

2605
02:51:13,159 --> 02:51:14,600
Where am I supposed to go here?

2606
02:51:14,600 --> 02:51:17,680
Let's go up.

2607
02:51:17,680 --> 02:51:27,680
They're not gonna get up, right?

2608
02:51:27,680 --> 02:51:28,239
They're dead?

2609
02:51:28,239 --> 02:52:16,799
This is such a maze.

2610
02:52:16,799 --> 02:52:18,000
Ooh.

2611
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:18,879
That's it?

2612
02:52:18,879 --> 02:52:20,569
Are you kidding me?

2613
02:52:20,569 --> 02:52:21,290
That's it?

2614
02:52:21,290 --> 02:52:27,549
Why are you so mad?

2615
02:52:27,549 --> 02:52:31,559
I'm not.

2616
02:52:31,559 --> 02:52:32,200
Eat the shrooms?

2617
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:33,559
I think they're just light shrooms.

2618
02:52:33,559 --> 02:52:35,159
I don't think they're actual shroom shrooms.

2619
02:52:35,159 --> 02:52:36,040
I don't think I can eat them.

2620
02:52:36,040 --> 02:52:41,659
I gotta turn this up.

2621
02:52:41,659 --> 02:52:43,180
People saying, follow the music.

2622
02:52:43,180 --> 02:52:57,469
That was a pig.

2623
02:52:57,469 --> 02:52:59,069
That was clearly a pig.

2624
02:52:59,069 --> 02:52:59,629
That was that...

2625
02:53:01,149 --> 02:53:02,430
You know that pig sound?

2626
02:53:02,430 --> 02:53:03,709
The default pig sound?

2627
02:53:03,709 --> 02:53:16,680
All right, up here?

2628
02:53:16,680 --> 02:53:26,969
That's why I don't put the two goddamn headphones in.

2629
02:53:29,290 --> 02:53:30,250
Get up!

2630
02:53:30,250 --> 02:53:35,420
Climb up here.

2631
02:53:35,420 --> 02:53:39,129
Oh, now I'm back here.

2632
02:53:39,129 --> 02:53:44,620
All right, get away from me.

2633
02:53:51,319 --> 02:53:52,959
Shit.

2634
02:53:52,959 --> 02:54:02,639
Shit.

2635
02:54:02,639 --> 02:54:13,979
Oh, get away from me.

2636
02:54:14,540 --> 02:54:15,500
I'm gonna die.

2637
02:54:15,500 --> 02:54:17,260
I'm gonna die.

2638
02:54:17,260 --> 02:54:18,059
I'm gonna die.

2639
02:54:18,860 --> 02:54:19,899
You gotta be...

2640
02:54:19,899 --> 02:54:20,860
How did he get up here?

2641
02:54:20,860 --> 02:54:21,659
How did they get up here?

2642
02:54:21,659 --> 02:54:22,780
They can't get up here.

2643
02:54:22,780 --> 02:54:25,040
I missed again.

2644
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:27,040
I missed again and I went all the way to the back.

2645
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:28,000
I'm gonna die right now.

2646
02:54:38,489 --> 02:54:40,010
I can't believe that just happened.

2647
02:54:40,010 --> 02:54:40,809
I can't believe it.

2648
02:54:41,370 --> 02:54:46,040
You've gotta be kidding me.

2649
02:54:46,040 --> 02:54:47,079
I don't even know where the save is.

2650
02:54:49,370 --> 02:54:50,010
Not that bad.

2651
02:54:51,770 --> 02:54:52,969
How did it miss?

2652
02:54:52,969 --> 02:54:54,729
There were three in the...

2653
02:54:54,729 --> 02:54:56,649
And all my field of vision.

2654
02:54:56,649 --> 02:55:03,629
That's so unfortunate.

2655
02:55:03,629 --> 02:55:12,329
Oh, well.

2656
02:55:12,329 --> 02:55:13,770
You got so much on my mouth.

2657
02:55:13,770 --> 02:55:18,510
Go change your pants and I'll be all right.

2658
02:55:18,510 --> 02:55:19,870
That's a worst gamer moment.

2659
02:55:19,870 --> 02:55:21,790
Uh, I mean, that was bad.

2660
02:55:21,790 --> 02:55:23,149
But that wasn't even my fault though.

2661
02:55:23,149 --> 02:55:24,110
That was such bullshit.

2662
02:55:25,760 --> 02:55:26,399
I...

2663
02:55:26,399 --> 02:55:27,040
You saw...

2664
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:28,879
It was like the hitbox got weird.

2665
02:55:28,879 --> 02:55:29,280
I...

2666
02:55:29,280 --> 02:55:30,319
It just missed.

2667
02:55:30,319 --> 02:55:31,840
I don't even know how it missed.

2668
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:34,010
I don't even know where I am right now.

2669
02:55:34,010 --> 02:55:35,930
But I'm just gonna grab onto this and go up.

2670
02:55:35,930 --> 02:55:37,770
And I think I just found it accidentally.

2671
02:55:37,770 --> 02:55:42,969
Did I just find it?

2672
02:55:46,940 --> 02:55:47,979
I just found where I need to go.

2673
02:55:48,540 --> 02:55:54,479
No, I didn't.

2674
02:55:54,479 --> 02:55:57,469
Is it still alive?

2675
02:55:57,469 --> 02:56:01,959
There's a sick McDonald's ceiling.

2676
02:56:08,399 --> 02:56:09,280
It's like not even...

2677
02:56:09,280 --> 02:56:10,239
It's not even close.

2678
02:56:10,239 --> 02:56:12,799
I mean, it's kind of close but not really...

2679
02:56:12,799 --> 02:56:14,319
Not enough for you to say that.

2680
02:56:14,319 --> 02:56:24,250
I don't think there's anything here.

2681
02:56:24,250 --> 02:56:25,850
All right, I gotta get through that.

2682
02:56:25,850 --> 02:56:29,079
There's nothing else here I can do.

2683
02:56:29,079 --> 02:56:30,120
Can I take something?

2684
02:56:30,120 --> 02:56:30,760
Push something?

2685
02:56:30,760 --> 02:56:31,260
No.

2686
02:56:32,920 --> 02:56:33,559
Secret.

2687
02:56:33,559 --> 02:56:37,450
It returns into the Joker.

2688
02:56:45,870 --> 02:56:46,350
Wait a minute.

2689
02:57:02,680 --> 02:57:04,040
Works on monsters.

2690
02:57:05,069 --> 02:57:05,709
That...

2691
02:57:05,709 --> 02:57:06,590
Good to know.

2692
02:57:06,590 --> 02:57:08,510
Very good to know that the...

2693
02:57:09,399 --> 02:57:20,270
The little bludgeoner works on huge monsters.

2694
02:57:20,270 --> 02:57:20,989
All right.

2695
02:57:20,989 --> 02:57:22,829
Time to get turned around a million times again.

2696
02:57:24,829 --> 02:57:25,549
Follow the music.

2697
02:57:26,270 --> 02:57:27,389
I feel like I was on the right track.

2698
02:57:35,229 --> 02:57:37,309
It works on anything that's alive.

2699
02:57:37,309 --> 02:57:38,639
Good to know.

2700
02:57:38,639 --> 02:57:39,200
That's funny.

2701
02:57:39,840 --> 02:57:41,920
Yep.

2702
02:57:41,920 --> 02:57:42,959
I remember getting the jewel here.

2703
02:57:43,600 --> 02:57:49,100
Follow the music.

2704
02:57:49,659 --> 02:57:52,200
Put in both headphones.

2705
02:57:52,200 --> 02:57:53,079
I hate doing that.

2706
02:57:53,639 --> 02:57:55,100
I hate it.

2707
02:57:55,100 --> 02:57:55,739
I don't like it.

2708
02:57:57,629 --> 02:57:58,909
It's too immersive.

2709
02:57:58,909 --> 02:58:19,149
What's wrong with being immersed?

2710
02:58:19,149 --> 02:58:20,670
I'm not aware of my surroundings.

2711
02:58:20,670 --> 02:58:34,379
I don't hear any music.

2712
02:58:34,379 --> 02:58:34,620
All right.

2713
02:58:34,620 --> 02:58:36,860
I gotta start burning this into memory here.

2714
02:58:36,860 --> 02:58:40,379
Oddwatches skip.

2715
02:58:40,379 --> 02:58:41,340
Don't skip.

2716
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:42,379
You need to help me.

2717
02:58:42,379 --> 02:58:46,760
All right.

2718
02:58:46,760 --> 02:58:47,639
I hear the music now.

2719
02:58:48,280 --> 02:58:59,899
Okay.

2720
02:58:59,899 --> 02:59:05,319
This is where I got messed up last time.

2721
02:59:05,319 --> 02:59:16,590
I just burped.

2722
02:59:16,590 --> 02:59:17,549
Oh, I thought that was me.

2723
02:59:18,110 --> 02:59:20,829
Shut up.

2724
02:59:20,829 --> 02:59:21,389
Shut up.

2725
02:59:21,389 --> 02:59:21,870
Shut up.

2726
02:59:21,870 --> 02:59:22,510
Shut up.

2727
02:59:22,510 --> 02:59:27,069
Shut up.

2728
02:59:27,069 --> 02:59:27,870
Music.

2729
02:59:27,870 --> 02:59:29,469
Music.

2730
02:59:29,469 --> 02:59:32,040
Come on.

2731
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:32,680
Get up there.

2732
02:59:32,680 --> 02:59:39,879
How do I get that?

2733
02:59:39,879 --> 02:59:44,299
Why is it saying go down?

2734
03:00:12,909 --> 03:00:15,209
Over there?

2735
03:00:15,209 --> 03:00:24,760
Do I rope arrow over there?

2736
03:00:24,760 --> 03:00:25,879
Music's in this room.

2737
03:00:25,879 --> 03:00:45,579
These zombies or these people?

2738
03:00:45,579 --> 03:00:57,149
It's hard to tell.

2739
03:00:57,149 --> 03:00:59,389
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2740
03:00:59,389 --> 03:01:00,590
Golden arm.

2741
03:01:00,590 --> 03:01:01,389
Golden arm.

2742
03:01:01,389 --> 03:01:03,389
No.

2743
03:01:07,399 --> 03:01:07,559
All right.

2744
03:01:07,559 --> 03:01:10,670
How do I get out?

2745
03:01:10,670 --> 03:01:11,309
I got a golden arm.

2746
03:01:12,110 --> 03:01:23,469
How do I get out?

2747
03:01:23,469 --> 03:01:23,870
How do I get out?

2748
03:01:23,870 --> 03:01:26,479
How do I get out?

2749
03:01:26,479 --> 03:01:26,979
Oh.

2750
03:01:59,040 --> 03:01:59,920
Eat him, not me.

2751
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:01,209
Eat him.

2752
03:02:01,209 --> 03:02:02,090
Eat him, not me.

2753
03:02:02,090 --> 03:02:02,329
All right.

2754
03:02:02,329 --> 03:02:03,209
How do I get out of here?

2755
03:02:03,209 --> 03:02:08,270
The horn is somewhere down here.

2756
03:02:08,270 --> 03:02:08,909
Oh, my God.

2757
03:02:08,909 --> 03:02:10,270
I'm actually in the horn room.

2758
03:02:10,270 --> 03:02:14,569
I need to heal.

2759
03:02:14,569 --> 03:02:15,450
Golden arm.

2760
03:02:15,450 --> 03:02:35,479
I was just frozen in fear.

2761
03:02:35,479 --> 03:02:42,040
I couldn't do anything.

2762
03:02:42,040 --> 03:02:43,319
I was just frozen.

2763
03:02:50,110 --> 03:02:50,909
Die.

2764
03:02:52,120 --> 03:02:53,530
I can't.

2765
03:03:01,739 --> 03:03:03,340
Shut up, everybody.

2766
03:03:03,340 --> 03:03:06,200
All right.

2767
03:03:06,200 --> 03:03:06,920
Let's go, bro.

2768
03:03:17,790 --> 03:03:19,229
No, I'm trapped.

2769
03:03:19,229 --> 03:03:20,110
I'm trapped.

2770
03:03:24,510 --> 03:03:24,829
Okay.

2771
03:03:24,829 --> 03:03:25,309
Fuck this.

2772
03:03:25,309 --> 03:03:26,270
I'm out of here.

2773
03:03:26,270 --> 03:03:27,709
I'm just going to bunny hop through the whole thing.

2774
03:03:28,270 --> 03:03:37,040
What's in here?

2775
03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:37,440
What's in here?

2776
03:03:37,440 --> 03:03:38,000
What's in here?

2777
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:38,319
All right.

2778
03:03:38,319 --> 03:03:38,639
I got it.

2779
03:03:38,639 --> 03:03:38,799
I got it.

2780
03:03:38,799 --> 03:03:39,520
I got it.

2781
03:03:39,520 --> 03:04:00,540
He sucks.

2782
03:04:00,540 --> 03:04:01,100
I...

2783
03:04:01,100 --> 03:04:03,309
Another golden arm.

2784
03:04:03,309 --> 03:04:14,059
I keep hearing the horn.

2785
03:04:14,059 --> 03:04:20,540
I'm going to go up.

2786
03:04:20,540 --> 03:04:22,700
Stop fucking breathing in my ear.

2787
03:04:22,700 --> 03:04:23,899
It's like ASMR.

2788
03:04:23,899 --> 03:04:24,940
Leave me the fuck alone.

2789
03:04:28,280 --> 03:04:29,319
He takes a sip and then he goes...

2790
03:04:43,520 --> 03:04:45,360
Why would you jump off?

2791
03:04:45,360 --> 03:04:58,649
I don't like this level.

2792
03:04:58,649 --> 03:04:59,610
I really don't.

2793
03:04:59,610 --> 03:05:00,959
I don't like this level.

2794
03:05:00,959 --> 03:05:04,239
I'm trying to jump onto the stupid platforms over there.

2795
03:05:06,879 --> 03:05:08,319
Oh, my freaking god.

2796
03:05:08,319 --> 03:05:11,500
Why would I jump off?

2797
03:05:11,500 --> 03:05:12,620
I'm not jumping up.

2798
03:05:12,620 --> 03:05:13,979
I'm trying to get off the ladder.

2799
03:05:13,979 --> 03:05:15,180
I can't just walk forward.

2800
03:05:15,180 --> 03:05:17,420
I have to jump like that.

2801
03:05:18,059 --> 03:05:20,909
I'm holding on for dear life.

2802
03:05:20,909 --> 03:05:21,950
What do I do?

2803
03:05:21,950 --> 03:05:22,989
Do I let go of space?

2804
03:05:22,989 --> 03:05:23,870
Should I let go of space?

2805
03:05:23,870 --> 03:05:26,190
I think if I let go of space, I pull myself up, right?

2806
03:05:47,819 --> 03:05:49,500
Weird dinosaur raptor guard.

2807
03:05:49,500 --> 03:05:57,360
All right.

2808
03:05:57,360 --> 03:05:58,000
Pig noise.

2809
03:06:10,969 --> 03:06:11,209
Whoa.

2810
03:06:27,260 --> 03:06:27,899
Got him.

2811
03:06:27,899 --> 03:06:38,000
Did I find a door?

2812
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:41,530
I got a door.

2813
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:44,799
Oh, my head.

2814
03:06:47,049 --> 03:06:48,010
I can't open this.

2815
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:54,719
Come on.

2816
03:06:54,719 --> 03:07:02,670
So what am I doing up here?

2817
03:07:02,670 --> 03:07:14,120
Clean your face here.

2818
03:07:14,120 --> 03:07:15,000
A little bit sweaty.

2819
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:20,760
This way.

2820
03:07:20,760 --> 03:07:24,600
I only have two earbuds in so I can tell where this horn is.

2821
03:07:24,600 --> 03:07:29,340
The game is too dark.

2822
03:07:35,200 --> 03:07:35,680
It's dark.

2823
03:07:35,680 --> 03:07:35,840
I know.

2824
03:07:35,840 --> 03:07:37,040
I'm trying to make it brighter.

2825
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:42,170
By the way, why is it doing this?

2826
03:07:42,170 --> 03:07:48,809
It is dark, isn't it?

2827
03:07:48,809 --> 03:07:50,090
I don't know why it's so dark.

2828
03:07:50,090 --> 03:08:09,950
Is that better?

2829
03:08:09,950 --> 03:08:10,430
That's better.

2830
03:08:10,430 --> 03:08:11,290
Yeah.

2831
03:08:11,290 --> 03:08:12,170
It's meant to be dark.

2832
03:08:12,170 --> 03:08:13,530
I know, but like, come on.

2833
03:08:13,530 --> 03:08:14,409
We're gamers.

2834
03:08:14,409 --> 03:08:14,809
We're streamers.

2835
03:08:14,809 --> 03:08:15,770
I want to be able to see.

2836
03:08:15,770 --> 03:08:17,719
All right.

2837
03:08:17,719 --> 03:08:22,399
Honest to god, I think I have to go back down.

2838
03:08:22,399 --> 03:08:23,040
Wait.

2839
03:08:23,040 --> 03:08:24,000
No, I don't.

2840
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:27,709
Check this shit out.

2841
03:08:27,709 --> 03:08:32,040
We're going to Donkey Kong Country this shit right now.

2842
03:08:32,040 --> 03:08:35,500
There's a rope.

2843
03:08:35,500 --> 03:08:43,840
Where's the rope?

2844
03:08:43,840 --> 03:08:44,719
Rope arrow.

2845
03:08:44,719 --> 03:08:54,110
This doesn't work.

2846
03:08:54,110 --> 03:08:54,879
It only...

2847
03:08:54,879 --> 03:08:57,120
It doesn't...

2848
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:59,120
I want to reload then because that sucks.

2849
03:08:59,120 --> 03:09:08,760
It only works on wood.

2850
03:09:08,760 --> 03:09:09,639
Oh, that's annoying.

2851
03:09:11,770 --> 03:09:15,200
That's annoying.

2852
03:09:15,200 --> 03:09:15,440
All right.

2853
03:09:15,440 --> 03:09:16,479
I got to go back down.

2854
03:09:16,479 --> 03:09:17,680
Get the arrows ready.

2855
03:09:17,680 --> 03:09:39,450
Go down the ladder.

2856
03:09:39,450 --> 03:09:57,770
What is all this?

2857
03:09:57,770 --> 03:09:59,129
Hold on.

2858
03:09:59,129 --> 03:10:00,329
Ladder right there, too.

2859
03:10:00,329 --> 03:10:03,239
Trinkets?

2860
03:10:03,239 --> 03:10:03,639
Nope.

2861
03:10:03,639 --> 03:10:05,680
Are we trinket up here?

2862
03:10:05,680 --> 03:10:11,690
What's the point of this?

2863
03:10:11,690 --> 03:10:12,670
It has to...

2864
03:10:12,670 --> 03:10:13,870
It can't just be for no reason.

2865
03:10:13,870 --> 03:10:15,069
It has to be a point to do this, right?

2866
03:10:15,069 --> 03:10:20,920
What's the point?

2867
03:10:20,920 --> 03:10:22,940
For realism?

2868
03:10:22,940 --> 03:10:24,219
To avoid enemies.

2869
03:10:24,219 --> 03:10:47,520
Hey!

2870
03:10:47,520 --> 03:10:50,569
Hey!

2871
03:10:50,569 --> 03:10:51,129
Hey!

2872
03:10:51,129 --> 03:10:52,649
Somebody's shooting arrows at me.

2873
03:10:52,649 --> 03:10:53,930
Who's shooting arrows?

2874
03:10:53,930 --> 03:10:58,250
I hear arrows firing at me.

2875
03:10:58,250 --> 03:10:59,690
I don't know from what direction.

2876
03:10:59,690 --> 03:11:07,260
Don't go down there.

2877
03:11:07,260 --> 03:11:21,100
Okay.

2878
03:11:21,100 --> 03:11:22,620
They're going around in a circle.

2879
03:11:22,620 --> 03:11:46,379
Wait.

2880
03:11:46,379 --> 03:11:47,180
What did I do that for?

2881
03:11:47,180 --> 03:11:49,760
This is a giant circle.

2882
03:11:49,760 --> 03:11:52,329
What do I do?

2883
03:11:52,329 --> 03:11:52,649
Wait.

2884
03:11:52,649 --> 03:11:53,290
Hold on.

2885
03:11:53,290 --> 03:11:56,729
Here we go.

2886
03:11:56,729 --> 03:12:04,680
Oh, this place is so confusing.

2887
03:12:04,680 --> 03:12:05,959
This place is so confusing.

2888
03:12:05,959 --> 03:12:08,989
Can I go over here?

2889
03:12:08,989 --> 03:13:02,030
The music's getting louder.

2890
03:13:02,030 --> 03:13:04,190
I was trying to just fucking run by him.

2891
03:13:04,190 --> 03:13:12,489
What's that say?

2892
03:13:13,600 --> 03:13:14,399
Quintus.

2893
03:13:14,399 --> 03:13:15,079
I made it.

2894
03:13:15,079 --> 03:13:15,639
I made it.

2895
03:13:15,639 --> 03:13:16,120
I got it.

2896
03:13:16,120 --> 03:13:16,680
I got it.

2897
03:13:22,959 --> 03:13:23,360
Safe.

2898
03:13:23,360 --> 03:13:26,090
Jerma, be quiet.

2899
03:13:26,090 --> 03:13:27,450
My mother's trying to sleep.

2900
03:13:27,450 --> 03:13:29,129
Turn my volume down.

2901
03:13:29,129 --> 03:13:30,190
Turn me down.

2902
03:13:30,190 --> 03:13:34,059
I was trying to...

2903
03:13:34,059 --> 03:13:34,540
Whatever.

2904
03:13:34,540 --> 03:13:37,520
Okay.

2905
03:13:37,520 --> 03:13:38,639
I can take this out now.

2906
03:13:38,639 --> 03:13:42,079
I was trying to match the guy's speech.

2907
03:13:42,079 --> 03:13:47,870
Climb the ladder.

2908
03:13:47,870 --> 03:13:48,670
You dumb.

2909
03:13:48,670 --> 03:13:58,110
Get the holy water ready.

2910
03:13:58,110 --> 03:14:08,010
Okay.

2911
03:14:08,010 --> 03:14:08,409
We're fine.

2912
03:14:13,180 --> 03:14:14,059
I knew it was going to happen.

2913
03:14:14,059 --> 03:14:15,899
It's so wonky to jump off the ladder.

2914
03:14:15,899 --> 03:14:21,049
Why is Beard Jerma so mean?

2915
03:14:21,049 --> 03:14:22,510
I'm not mean.

2916
03:14:22,510 --> 03:14:22,989
What are you talking about?

2917
03:14:22,989 --> 03:14:23,950
I'm just chilling around.

2918
03:14:23,950 --> 03:14:29,040
I'm right there.

2919
03:14:29,040 --> 03:14:29,600
Just do it.

2920
03:14:29,600 --> 03:14:37,959
Is there ever a game that's gotten ladders right?

2921
03:14:55,420 --> 03:14:56,299
Dark Souls.

2922
03:14:56,299 --> 03:14:58,250
Dark Souls ladders were fine.

2923
03:14:59,500 --> 03:15:00,219
Because you didn't...

2924
03:15:00,299 --> 03:15:02,780
I have to kind of first person stick on them.

2925
03:15:02,780 --> 03:15:06,329
You actually climbed them.

2926
03:15:06,329 --> 03:15:09,850
So your character was just on it, you know?

2927
03:15:09,850 --> 03:15:14,250
But in FPS where you have to attach to a ladder and get off of a ladder.

2928
03:15:14,250 --> 03:15:14,729
I don't...

2929
03:15:14,729 --> 03:15:16,889
I don't think it's possible to make that good.

2930
03:15:16,889 --> 03:15:17,450
I don't.

2931
03:15:17,450 --> 03:15:24,250
It's such an awkward movement.

2932
03:15:24,250 --> 03:15:24,969
Just by...

2933
03:15:25,610 --> 03:15:28,760
You think you can snipe me from down there?

2934
03:15:28,760 --> 03:15:59,120
There it is.

2935
03:15:59,120 --> 03:15:59,760
Go up.

2936
03:16:00,399 --> 03:16:06,760
Thank you.

2937
03:16:06,760 --> 03:16:07,479
Now what?

2938
03:16:07,479 --> 03:16:16,239
Did I win?

2939
03:16:16,239 --> 03:16:17,440
Find the horn of Quintus.

2940
03:16:17,440 --> 03:16:27,129
Got it.

2941
03:16:27,129 --> 03:16:31,049
The ancient corruption was again contained.

2942
03:16:31,049 --> 03:16:32,969
To do more would have upset the balance.

2943
03:16:32,969 --> 03:16:36,489
But we knew to remain ever vigilant lest it resurface.

2944
03:16:39,659 --> 03:16:43,819
Neither the hammers nor the pagans could be trusted not to meddle.

2945
03:16:46,489 --> 03:16:47,610
Keeper annals.

2946
03:16:48,409 --> 03:16:51,530
I had some money to spare after disposing of the horn.

2947
03:16:51,530 --> 03:16:54,489
So it seemed time to invest in some new tools.

2948
03:16:55,370 --> 03:16:55,850
Farkas.

2949
03:16:55,850 --> 03:16:56,409
Functionals.

2950
03:16:56,409 --> 03:16:59,770
Farkas is one of the few merchants willing to risk selling to an independent like me.

2951
03:16:59,770 --> 03:17:01,450
And his prices are steep.

2952
03:17:01,450 --> 03:17:05,770
But the other choice is to let one of the so-called wardens give me orders.

2953
03:17:05,770 --> 03:17:07,370
And take a cut of my profits.

2954
03:17:08,329 --> 03:17:12,170
They've been after me for years to join one of their stables but I'm not interested.

2955
03:17:12,809 --> 03:17:14,649
Maybe they'll get the idea and give up.

2956
03:17:15,290 --> 03:17:17,690
More likely they'll just ramp up the threats.

2957
03:17:18,969 --> 03:17:20,969
Nothing I can't handle if I'm careful.

2958
03:17:22,010 --> 03:17:23,129
And lucky.

2959
03:17:23,129 --> 03:17:26,010
And my luck seems to have finally turned for the better.

2960
03:17:26,010 --> 03:17:26,729
Where we going now?

2961
03:17:27,770 --> 03:17:34,200
Now that you've got the finest in lockpicks you can go after more challenging and lucrative targets.

2962
03:17:34,840 --> 03:17:36,360
How about the local hammer temple?

2963
03:17:36,360 --> 03:17:38,200
Get at least a thousand loot.

2964
03:17:38,920 --> 03:17:40,170
Ahem.

2965
03:17:40,170 --> 03:17:40,670
Okay.

2966
03:17:41,049 --> 03:17:43,000
So I got lockpicks.

2967
03:17:43,719 --> 03:17:45,450
Gotta steal a bunch of loot.

2968
03:17:45,450 --> 03:17:46,170
I got a lot of money.

2969
03:17:48,600 --> 03:17:50,360
The fire arrows are explosions.

2970
03:17:50,360 --> 03:17:54,969
They're so loud and annoying.

2971
03:17:54,969 --> 03:17:56,409
I want at least a couple health potions.

2972
03:17:57,049 --> 03:18:00,030
Can I take more moss?

2973
03:18:00,670 --> 03:18:03,920
I don't use them though.

2974
03:18:04,479 --> 03:18:06,120
Playing on normal.

2975
03:18:06,120 --> 03:18:07,799
Yeah I'm a normal gamer.

2976
03:18:08,360 --> 03:18:13,500
The water arrows maybe I'll take a couple.

2977
03:18:13,500 --> 03:18:14,620
They're expensive though.

2978
03:18:19,290 --> 03:18:23,450
Fine I'll take one fire arrow and then a moss arrow.

2979
03:18:24,170 --> 03:18:25,049
And then just more of these.

2980
03:18:25,610 --> 03:18:25,930
Sure.

2981
03:18:25,930 --> 03:18:26,729
Alright sounds good.

2982
03:18:27,450 --> 03:18:29,389
Okay here we go.

2983
03:18:29,389 --> 03:18:30,110
Let me save it.

2984
03:18:31,399 --> 03:18:33,959
You get uh I'll get back here for you guys.

2985
03:18:34,600 --> 03:18:35,799
Save the game.

2986
03:18:35,799 --> 03:18:37,000
A hard save slot.

2987
03:18:38,030 --> 03:18:38,430
Okay.

2988
03:18:38,989 --> 03:18:39,549
How are we?

2989
03:18:47,770 --> 03:18:48,010
What?

2990
03:18:51,709 --> 03:18:55,760
Oh my god free stuff.

2991
03:18:56,809 --> 03:18:58,090
Why did I buy anything?

2992
03:18:58,090 --> 03:18:59,049
Why did I buy anything?

2993
03:18:59,610 --> 03:19:00,649
I have a this is all free.

2994
03:19:01,370 --> 03:19:08,750
Oh my goodness.

2995
03:19:08,750 --> 03:19:10,989
Holy that's a lot of stuff.

2996
03:19:10,989 --> 03:19:15,180
Okay what about this?

2997
03:19:15,180 --> 03:19:17,579
Anything else in here?

2998
03:19:17,579 --> 03:19:28,200
Alright so now I gotta I gotta trail the thugs who just tried to assassinate you

2999
03:19:28,200 --> 03:19:29,479
without being detected.

3000
03:19:32,250 --> 03:19:32,809
Where'd they go?

3001
03:19:33,450 --> 03:19:37,040
I don't know where the hell they are.

3002
03:19:47,360 --> 03:19:48,479
I don't know where are they?

3003
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:55,719
In here?

3004
03:19:56,280 --> 03:20:05,930
I don't know.

3005
03:20:05,930 --> 03:20:07,370
I was busy stealing everything.

3006
03:20:07,370 --> 03:20:08,649
Oh well I'll find them.

3007
03:20:09,290 --> 03:20:13,739
They down here?

3008
03:20:14,459 --> 03:20:17,229
Oh they came down here.

3009
03:20:17,790 --> 03:20:21,469
What happened to me?

3010
03:20:21,469 --> 03:20:23,920
Did I just like I die?

3011
03:20:24,639 --> 03:20:30,219
Oh I thought I got like fucking like close to a giant trap and it instantly killed me.

3012
03:20:30,780 --> 03:20:32,459
I thought like I got sniped or something.

3013
03:20:32,459 --> 03:20:37,469
Alright um so I need to open up that hard save then.

3014
03:20:47,450 --> 03:20:48,250
Hey!

3015
03:20:48,250 --> 03:21:06,700
Oh what are you doing you idiot?

3016
03:21:07,979 --> 03:21:09,100
Alright I gotta go quick.

3017
03:21:24,860 --> 03:21:26,700
Is that Microsoft network noises?

3018
03:21:32,540 --> 03:21:33,659
Alright stay silent.

3019
03:21:33,659 --> 03:21:34,219
Stay quiet.

3020
03:21:39,979 --> 03:21:41,020
MSN sounds?

3021
03:21:45,229 --> 03:21:46,909
MSN chat.

3022
03:21:46,909 --> 03:21:49,530
That's so stupid.

3023
03:21:59,020 --> 03:22:00,219
I'm fine whatever.

3024
03:22:01,760 --> 03:22:05,770
No you I don't want to watch this guy die again.

3025
03:22:05,770 --> 03:22:06,489
Alright go go go.

3026
03:22:11,239 --> 03:22:11,799
You dumb.

3027
03:22:11,799 --> 03:22:13,399
I was reading chat.

3028
03:22:13,399 --> 03:22:13,899
Sorry.

3029
03:22:24,670 --> 03:22:25,170
Hail them.

3030
03:22:27,360 --> 03:22:28,479
Explosion arrows ready.

3031
03:22:29,659 --> 03:22:31,100
Explosion arrows at the ready.

3032
03:22:31,100 --> 03:22:49,309
Funny.

3033
03:22:49,309 --> 03:22:50,030
Funny joke.

3034
03:22:50,590 --> 03:22:52,809
He was doing the same.

3035
03:23:09,709 --> 03:23:11,069
No one is following you.

3036
03:23:11,069 --> 03:23:11,950
Relax.

3037
03:23:11,950 --> 03:23:20,649
Where'd they go?

3038
03:23:20,649 --> 03:23:21,450
Where'd they go?

3039
03:23:21,450 --> 03:23:21,850
Where'd they go?

3040
03:23:21,850 --> 03:23:22,329
Where'd they go?

3041
03:23:22,329 --> 03:23:22,809
Where'd they go?

3042
03:23:22,809 --> 03:23:23,530
Where'd they go?

3043
03:23:23,530 --> 03:23:24,090
Where'd they go?

3044
03:23:24,090 --> 03:23:24,489
Where'd they go?

3045
03:23:24,489 --> 03:23:24,969
Where'd they go?

3046
03:23:26,059 --> 03:23:26,540
Where'd they go?

3047
03:23:27,420 --> 03:23:28,379
I didn't see where they went.

3048
03:23:29,020 --> 03:23:57,739
Wait!

3049
03:23:57,739 --> 03:24:17,659
Moss arrows.

3050
03:24:17,659 --> 03:24:18,139
Shit!

3051
03:24:18,139 --> 03:24:19,020
Where'd they go?

3052
03:24:19,020 --> 03:24:55,180
Wait we're just going in a big circle.

3053
03:24:55,180 --> 03:25:15,200
It's gonna be loud.

3054
03:25:15,200 --> 03:25:15,840
Moss arrows.

3055
03:25:55,899 --> 03:25:59,020
Why do they keep stopping?

3056
03:25:59,020 --> 03:26:04,399
He's having an allergic reaction to the game?

3057
03:26:04,399 --> 03:26:07,180
What are you talking about?

3058
03:26:07,180 --> 03:26:14,190
Hey just spirit.

3059
03:26:14,190 --> 03:26:15,069
Where'd they go?

3060
03:26:15,149 --> 03:26:15,469
What?

3061
03:26:15,469 --> 03:26:16,110
Oh over here.

3062
03:26:16,110 --> 03:26:41,840
Ah you can't see me it's dark.

3063
03:26:41,840 --> 03:26:56,750
Idiot.

3064
03:26:56,750 --> 03:26:56,989
How?

3065
03:26:56,989 --> 03:26:57,309
This is...

3066
03:26:58,430 --> 03:27:00,489
This is long.

3067
03:27:00,489 --> 03:27:01,450
This is really...

3068
03:27:26,059 --> 03:27:27,420
His ass is too big.

3069
03:27:40,139 --> 03:27:40,639
Hey.

3070
03:27:42,860 --> 03:27:43,360
Hey.

3071
03:27:43,979 --> 03:27:48,969
Pick his body up.

3072
03:27:48,969 --> 03:27:50,170
What are you thinking?

3073
03:27:50,170 --> 03:27:51,530
Pick his body up and throw him over here.

3074
03:27:52,250 --> 03:28:14,459
All right I'm in.

3075
03:28:14,459 --> 03:28:17,079
Hey.

3076
03:28:17,079 --> 03:28:17,559
These soft?

3077
03:28:17,559 --> 03:28:32,219
These are soft sounds right?

3078
03:28:32,219 --> 03:28:37,500
Let's pitch black right here.

3079
03:28:37,500 --> 03:28:37,899
What do I have?

3080
03:28:37,899 --> 03:28:38,780
What's my mission?

3081
03:28:38,780 --> 03:28:44,170
Time to show Ramirez who the real criminal mastermind is.

3082
03:28:44,170 --> 03:28:46,409
Break into his mansion and take what he values most.

3083
03:28:46,409 --> 03:28:48,120
His wealth.

3084
03:28:48,120 --> 03:28:50,760
Purse from his belt should make the point.

3085
03:28:51,850 --> 03:28:52,569
Loot the mansion.

3086
03:28:52,569 --> 03:28:53,209
All right.

3087
03:28:53,209 --> 03:28:54,409
I just need to get a lot of money.

3088
03:28:58,940 --> 03:28:59,739
Not going that way.

3089
03:29:16,860 --> 03:29:17,340
Give me that key.

3090
03:29:17,899 --> 03:29:20,010
This guy's got a key.

3091
03:29:20,649 --> 03:29:25,000
Somebody get coming?

3092
03:29:25,000 --> 03:29:28,110
Oh shit.

3093
03:29:30,030 --> 03:29:30,829
Oh shit.

3094
03:29:30,829 --> 03:29:31,309
Don't go.

3095
03:29:31,309 --> 03:29:31,790
Just wait.

3096
03:29:31,790 --> 03:29:38,750
It's fine.

3097
03:29:38,750 --> 03:29:39,709
It's not for this door.

3098
03:29:47,129 --> 03:29:53,469
I thought I was gonna throw it further.

3099
03:30:08,379 --> 03:30:09,579
I have lockpicks?

3100
03:30:09,579 --> 03:30:17,049
This doesn't work on this door.

3101
03:30:17,049 --> 03:30:27,100
I have to get through here.

3102
03:30:28,540 --> 03:30:30,430
I have to get through here.

3103
03:30:30,430 --> 03:30:31,709
Try another shape.

3104
03:30:31,709 --> 03:30:47,739
I want to be able to hide in here.

3105
03:30:47,739 --> 03:30:51,209
Really?

3106
03:30:51,209 --> 03:30:52,329
Ooh.

3107
03:30:52,329 --> 03:30:57,629
Let's do the paintings.

3108
03:30:57,629 --> 03:31:03,629
Is that the Dana DeVito guy from Hercules?

3109
03:31:03,629 --> 03:31:08,489
Who is that?

3110
03:31:08,489 --> 03:31:08,809
Come on.

3111
03:31:08,809 --> 03:31:09,690
Something secret back here.

3112
03:31:15,850 --> 03:31:16,329
Oh wait.

3113
03:31:16,329 --> 03:31:17,290
I do have other shapes.

3114
03:31:17,290 --> 03:31:17,610
You're right.

3115
03:31:17,610 --> 03:31:17,850
All right.

3116
03:31:17,850 --> 03:31:18,329
That's all right.

3117
03:31:44,409 --> 03:31:44,729
Stop.

3118
03:31:53,600 --> 03:31:54,000
Stop.

3119
03:31:54,000 --> 03:31:55,440
I know you can't see shit.

3120
03:31:55,440 --> 03:31:56,239
Leave me alone.

3121
03:31:56,239 --> 03:31:59,840
Can I take out the?

3122
03:31:59,840 --> 03:32:00,079
All right.

3123
03:32:00,079 --> 03:32:00,959
I'm throwing a flashbang.

3124
03:32:00,959 --> 03:32:15,420
Is someone there?

3125
03:32:15,420 --> 03:32:16,299
Everybody close your eyes.

3126
03:32:16,299 --> 03:32:16,780
Close your eyes.

3127
03:32:16,780 --> 03:32:17,260
Close your eyes.

3128
03:32:17,260 --> 03:32:17,739
Close your eyes.

3129
03:32:17,739 --> 03:32:18,459
Close your eyes.

3130
03:32:18,459 --> 03:32:35,479
I'm just not going over here.

3131
03:32:35,479 --> 03:32:36,120
I'm going the other way.

3132
03:32:36,840 --> 03:32:38,040
Stop seeing me.

3133
03:32:38,040 --> 03:32:44,190
I'm going a different way.

3134
03:32:44,190 --> 03:32:55,959
Those flashbangs are so bright.

3135
03:32:55,959 --> 03:32:56,680
A fair warning.

3136
03:32:56,680 --> 03:32:57,719
If I use those flashbangs,

3137
03:32:57,719 --> 03:32:58,440
they're going to be horrible.

3138
03:32:58,440 --> 03:33:00,120
So just be prepared for them.

3139
03:33:00,120 --> 03:33:02,989
I'll try to give you warning.

3140
03:33:02,989 --> 03:33:03,790
I'll say close your eyes.

3141
03:33:03,790 --> 03:33:04,270
Close your eyes.

3142
03:33:04,270 --> 03:33:05,069
Close your eyes.

3143
03:33:05,069 --> 03:33:15,200
Close your eyes.

3144
03:33:15,200 --> 03:33:16,399
Everybody close your eyes.

3145
03:33:16,399 --> 03:33:24,590
Open your eyes.

3146
03:33:24,590 --> 03:33:25,629
I'm not going to use it.

3147
03:33:25,629 --> 03:33:27,549
Will they see this or hear this?

3148
03:33:59,950 --> 03:34:02,350
Disguards it everywhere in this mission.

3149
03:34:02,350 --> 03:34:03,389
Oh my goodness.

3150
03:34:03,389 --> 03:34:04,350
How am I going to do this?

3151
03:34:06,809 --> 03:34:07,930
Lowercase scream.

3152
03:34:09,290 --> 03:34:09,930
Like...

3153
03:34:16,840 --> 03:34:18,280
Oh my god.

3154
03:34:19,399 --> 03:34:20,520
Hey, hi everybody.

3155
03:34:20,520 --> 03:34:21,479
Hi, I'm a thief.

3156
03:34:21,479 --> 03:34:22,760
Nobody can stop me.

3157
03:34:22,760 --> 03:34:23,719
What are you going to do about it?

3158
03:34:24,440 --> 03:34:25,719
Everybody close your eyes.

3159
03:34:25,719 --> 03:34:26,280
Close your eyes.

3160
03:34:26,280 --> 03:34:26,680
Close your eyes.

3161
03:34:26,680 --> 03:34:27,079
Close your eyes.

3162
03:34:27,079 --> 03:34:27,559
Close your eyes.

3163
03:34:27,559 --> 03:34:28,600
One, two, three.

3164
03:34:29,399 --> 03:34:38,399
They all went the wrong way.

3165
03:34:38,399 --> 03:34:38,719
I'm good.

3166
03:34:57,819 --> 03:34:59,100
Open the fucking door.

3167
03:34:59,819 --> 03:35:01,290
All right, I'm done.

3168
03:35:01,290 --> 03:35:04,909
I'm not.

3169
03:35:04,909 --> 03:35:06,110
This is the guard quarters.

3170
03:35:06,110 --> 03:35:07,149
Don't open that door.

3171
03:35:11,399 --> 03:35:12,280
Door stuck.

3172
03:35:12,840 --> 03:35:17,610
How much do I have so far?

3173
03:35:17,610 --> 03:35:18,329
How much have I stolen?

3174
03:35:20,680 --> 03:35:21,079
None.

3175
03:35:21,239 --> 03:35:28,479
There's got to be some expensive shit up here, right?

3176
03:35:28,479 --> 03:35:29,120
Give me a break.

3177
03:35:29,120 --> 03:35:43,479
Look at how expensive this carpet is.

3178
03:35:43,479 --> 03:35:46,079
Here we go.

3179
03:35:46,079 --> 03:35:46,879
What's in here?

3180
03:35:46,879 --> 03:35:47,680
Something.

3181
03:35:47,680 --> 03:35:48,799
Valuables.

3182
03:35:48,799 --> 03:35:51,069
Bingo.

3183
03:35:51,069 --> 03:35:53,389
Lord Ramirez, the reinforced walls and steel door

3184
03:35:53,389 --> 03:35:55,790
have been day-dutely installed

3185
03:35:55,790 --> 03:35:57,389
about your accounting room.

3186
03:35:57,389 --> 03:35:58,989
But I must warn you that we cannot guarantee

3187
03:35:58,989 --> 03:36:00,750
that against brick tunneling.

3188
03:36:01,629 --> 03:36:03,229
If you do not move the creatures

3189
03:36:03,229 --> 03:36:05,149
out of the basement into a more distant area,

3190
03:36:05,149 --> 03:36:06,190
we cannot be held responsible

3191
03:36:06,190 --> 03:36:07,870
for the potential damages.

3192
03:36:07,870 --> 03:36:20,670
All right, there's valuables over here.

3193
03:36:21,309 --> 03:36:22,809
Anything in there?

3194
03:36:22,809 --> 03:36:23,370
I don't know.

3195
03:36:23,370 --> 03:36:24,489
How much do I have so far?

3196
03:36:24,489 --> 03:36:25,290
I need a thousand.

3197
03:36:25,850 --> 03:36:27,129
All right, I got a hundred bucks right now.

3198
03:36:27,129 --> 03:36:28,809
I need like nine more items.

3199
03:36:28,809 --> 03:36:31,149
What does it look for?

3200
03:36:31,149 --> 03:36:32,670
Hidden panels on the walls.

3201
03:36:32,670 --> 03:36:38,680
I don't see anything in here.

3202
03:36:38,680 --> 03:36:40,360
All right, not a bad start.

3203
03:36:40,360 --> 03:36:41,079
Let's go.

3204
03:36:41,079 --> 03:36:53,879
He's walking.

3205
03:36:53,879 --> 03:37:03,440
Ooh, a rare painting.

3206
03:37:03,440 --> 03:37:04,959
No, that's a chair.

3207
03:37:04,959 --> 03:37:07,319
I thought it was a painting.

3208
03:37:07,319 --> 03:37:08,120
Hold on.

3209
03:37:08,120 --> 03:37:10,879
Why do you have nothing?

3210
03:37:11,440 --> 03:37:12,909
You have, why do you have nothing?

3211
03:37:16,280 --> 03:37:17,079
Really?

3212
03:37:17,079 --> 03:37:24,780
Keep going.

3213
03:37:24,780 --> 03:37:26,719
Where am I?

3214
03:37:26,719 --> 03:37:27,920
I'm on the second floor.

3215
03:37:27,920 --> 03:37:34,379
I could go down to the basement

3216
03:37:34,379 --> 03:37:36,540
and go kind of into his private counting chambers.

3217
03:37:37,100 --> 03:37:41,659
Okay, this topic, wait.

3218
03:37:41,659 --> 03:37:42,860
Let me check that other room.

3219
03:37:42,860 --> 03:37:48,729
Why does your mic have an echo?

3220
03:37:48,729 --> 03:37:51,899
It shouldn't have an echo.

3221
03:37:52,540 --> 03:37:57,920
All right, I open this door.

3222
03:37:58,559 --> 03:38:05,610
The key, lockpick.

3223
03:38:05,610 --> 03:38:07,709
Ooh, is that working?

3224
03:38:16,940 --> 03:38:18,299
I don't know what's happening here.

3225
03:38:18,299 --> 03:38:21,340
Got it, I guess.

3226
03:38:25,870 --> 03:38:38,200
Hold it.

3227
03:38:38,200 --> 03:38:39,799
All right, private stash.

3228
03:38:39,799 --> 03:38:59,530
What do we got?

3229
03:38:59,530 --> 03:38:59,930
What?

3230
03:38:59,930 --> 03:39:12,649
There's nothing even in here.

3231
03:39:12,649 --> 03:39:17,370
Don't press that button.

3232
03:39:20,889 --> 03:39:26,110
That's the Diet Coke button.

3233
03:39:26,110 --> 03:39:28,059
Ooh, expensive.

3234
03:39:28,059 --> 03:39:29,260
Very expensive stuff.

3235
03:39:29,260 --> 03:39:31,840
What was that?

3236
03:39:31,840 --> 03:39:33,899
200.

3237
03:39:33,899 --> 03:39:38,590
Well, I don't need that now.

3238
03:39:38,590 --> 03:39:42,489
Richard Dayanian.

3239
03:39:42,489 --> 03:39:43,850
I know with displeasure that, again,

3240
03:39:43,850 --> 03:39:47,229
one of my tough boys has been taken to Craig's Cleft.

3241
03:39:47,229 --> 03:39:50,270
May I remind you of the substantial donations I make to your office,

3242
03:39:50,270 --> 03:39:55,959
such that I may pursue business unhindered by idle scrutiny.

3243
03:39:55,959 --> 03:40:00,170
May I remind you as well of your predecessor's unfortunate end.

3244
03:40:00,170 --> 03:40:02,489
The rivers are so treacherous this time of year.

3245
03:40:02,489 --> 03:40:05,399
I trust that you will attend to this.

3246
03:40:05,399 --> 03:40:07,639
And if the hammers are too difficult for your policemen,

3247
03:40:07,639 --> 03:40:09,319
I trust as well that you'll let me know.

3248
03:40:09,319 --> 03:40:19,200
Here's something.

3249
03:40:19,200 --> 03:40:25,600
Private's book stash or something.

3250
03:40:25,600 --> 03:40:26,239
What is this?

3251
03:40:26,239 --> 03:40:29,069
What is this place?

3252
03:40:29,069 --> 03:40:40,379
This is weird.

3253
03:40:40,379 --> 03:40:41,659
That looks expensive.

3254
03:40:41,659 --> 03:40:42,760
Oh, my goodness.

3255
03:40:42,760 --> 03:40:43,559
Very expensive.

3256
03:40:47,790 --> 03:40:48,110
Nice.

3257
03:40:48,670 --> 03:40:49,549
Can I get in there?

3258
03:40:50,110 --> 03:40:57,040
How much more do I need?

3259
03:41:00,159 --> 03:41:01,180
Yeah.

3260
03:41:01,180 --> 03:41:01,979
Oh, I'm going to pick up.

3261
03:41:03,549 --> 03:41:04,110
Yeah.

3262
03:41:04,110 --> 03:41:07,920
All right.

3263
03:41:07,920 --> 03:41:08,799
I'm collecting money.

3264
03:41:08,799 --> 03:41:09,920
I'm doing all right.

3265
03:41:09,920 --> 03:41:12,010
Where?

3266
03:41:12,010 --> 03:41:15,420
Who?

3267
03:41:15,420 --> 03:41:16,379
Who's running?

3268
03:41:16,379 --> 03:41:17,020
I hear somebody.

3269
03:41:17,579 --> 03:41:31,049
Somebody up there next to the gigantic explosive barrel.

3270
03:41:34,670 --> 03:41:36,270
I can jump in that window.

3271
03:41:36,270 --> 03:41:40,940
I wonder if I should try it.

3272
03:41:40,940 --> 03:42:07,100
Not worth doing.

3273
03:42:07,100 --> 03:42:26,239
I can get it.

3274
03:42:26,239 --> 03:42:26,639
Nice.

3275
03:42:26,639 --> 03:42:27,680
OK, so what do I do with this?

3276
03:42:27,680 --> 03:42:32,489
What's the point of all this?

3277
03:42:32,489 --> 03:42:33,450
What did I just do that for?

3278
03:42:41,309 --> 03:42:52,139
What was this for?

3279
03:42:52,139 --> 03:42:53,340
Lock pick my way out of here?

3280
03:43:09,979 --> 03:43:10,540
Where is this guy?

3281
03:43:14,540 --> 03:43:18,079
The grass is not this loud.

3282
03:43:18,079 --> 03:43:18,639
Secret ladder.

3283
03:43:18,639 --> 03:43:19,200
Secret ladder.

3284
03:43:19,200 --> 03:43:20,399
Secret ladder in that fireplace.

3285
03:43:20,399 --> 03:43:21,520
Secret ladder in the fireplace.

3286
03:43:21,520 --> 03:43:23,659
The fireplace had a secret ladder.

3287
03:43:23,659 --> 03:43:27,799
Secret ladder?

3288
03:43:27,799 --> 03:43:32,639
Are you serious?

3289
03:43:32,639 --> 03:43:33,840
Go back and extinguish the fireplace.

3290
03:43:33,840 --> 03:43:34,879
There's a secret ladder in there.

3291
03:43:34,879 --> 03:43:52,569
There's a guy right here.

3292
03:43:52,569 --> 03:43:53,770
Oh, my goodness.

3293
03:43:53,770 --> 03:43:54,809
How did you wait for me?

3294
03:43:54,809 --> 03:43:56,250
You knew I was coming somehow.

3295
03:43:58,780 --> 03:43:59,979
Wow, that was terrifying.

3296
03:44:08,239 --> 03:44:08,559
All right.

3297
03:44:08,559 --> 03:44:09,600
Well, I got to be careful.

3298
03:44:09,600 --> 03:44:19,709
I'm just going to wait till they leave the room.

3299
03:44:19,709 --> 03:44:20,590
He's right here.

3300
03:44:20,590 --> 03:44:24,780
Peek your head out here.

3301
03:44:24,780 --> 03:44:26,379
I'm going to bludgeon you in the face.

3302
03:44:32,860 --> 03:44:46,090
The roof is really loud.

3303
03:44:46,090 --> 03:45:02,600
Moss.

3304
03:45:02,600 --> 03:45:08,729
I'm over the ledge.

3305
03:45:08,729 --> 03:45:09,450
I have an idea.

3306
03:45:09,450 --> 03:45:13,530
Close your eyes.

3307
03:45:13,530 --> 03:45:15,899
One, two, three.

3308
03:45:15,899 --> 03:45:29,370
I didn't want to fucking do that again.

3309
03:45:29,370 --> 03:45:34,270
How am I going to do this?

3310
03:45:34,270 --> 03:45:55,920
I got to get into the darkness here.

3311
03:45:55,920 --> 03:45:56,479
No.

3312
03:45:56,479 --> 03:46:12,219
I think I have to just wait till they get bored.

3313
03:46:12,219 --> 03:46:13,500
Use the bomb arrow?

3314
03:46:13,500 --> 03:46:27,040
I accidentally let go.

3315
03:46:27,040 --> 03:46:34,840
I slipped off.

3316
03:46:34,840 --> 03:46:36,600
There's no arrow.

3317
03:46:36,600 --> 03:46:38,510
I figured out why I miss.

3318
03:46:38,510 --> 03:46:41,389
There's no drop on these arrows.

3319
03:46:41,389 --> 03:46:43,389
They go in a straight line.

3320
03:46:43,389 --> 03:46:53,819
There's no drop.

3321
03:46:53,819 --> 03:46:54,139
All right.

3322
03:46:54,139 --> 03:46:54,700
One on one.

3323
03:46:54,700 --> 03:46:55,340
Let's go, buddy.

3324
03:46:55,899 --> 03:47:19,159
Oh, douche.

3325
03:47:19,159 --> 03:47:19,639
Touche.

3326
03:47:19,639 --> 03:47:20,440
Touche.

3327
03:47:20,440 --> 03:47:28,319
I don't think this guy knows how to swing a sword.

3328
03:47:28,319 --> 03:47:30,000
That guy has never trained how to swing a sword.

3329
03:47:30,000 --> 03:47:43,819
Everybody have anything on them?

3330
03:47:43,819 --> 03:47:47,719
That was just a prop for that guy.

3331
03:47:47,719 --> 03:47:50,569
They don't have anything on them.

3332
03:47:50,569 --> 03:47:51,209
All right.

3333
03:47:51,209 --> 03:47:53,680
How could I miss that?

3334
03:47:53,680 --> 03:47:55,040
We're good to go.

3335
03:47:55,040 --> 03:47:57,040
I have no more fire arrows though.

3336
03:47:57,040 --> 03:47:59,579
Oh, dude.

3337
03:47:59,579 --> 03:48:00,940
You guys weren't kidding around.

3338
03:48:00,940 --> 03:48:02,459
This is a secret entrance here.

3339
03:48:02,459 --> 03:48:06,649
But now that's important.

3340
03:48:08,600 --> 03:48:10,760
Now this is important stuff here now.

3341
03:48:10,760 --> 03:48:18,139
Oh, hell yeah.

3342
03:48:18,139 --> 03:48:21,549
Somebody else's bedroom or something.

3343
03:48:21,549 --> 03:48:22,969
What's this?

3344
03:48:27,469 --> 03:48:28,670
Can I climb through here?

3345
03:48:28,670 --> 03:48:38,090
Can't get through this.

3346
03:48:38,649 --> 03:48:41,819
I can't go through it.

3347
03:48:41,819 --> 03:48:46,639
I'm trying to stuff in.

3348
03:48:46,639 --> 03:48:47,440
I can't.

3349
03:48:47,440 --> 03:48:52,360
I can't.

3350
03:48:52,360 --> 03:48:57,209
How much money do I have now?

3351
03:48:58,379 --> 03:49:00,440
675.

3352
03:49:00,440 --> 03:49:01,159
No.

3353
03:49:01,159 --> 03:49:02,040
Total of 380.

3354
03:49:02,040 --> 03:49:02,680
I got 1,100.

3355
03:49:02,680 --> 03:49:03,079
I got it.

3356
03:49:03,079 --> 03:49:04,120
I have enough now.

3357
03:49:04,120 --> 03:49:07,049
Breaking his mansion.

3358
03:49:07,049 --> 03:49:08,250
Take what he values most.

3359
03:49:08,250 --> 03:49:09,770
The purse from his belt.

3360
03:49:09,770 --> 03:49:11,020
So I got to find his...

3361
03:49:11,659 --> 03:49:14,299
Where's his room?

3362
03:49:15,100 --> 03:49:15,659
I have enough.

3363
03:49:16,219 --> 03:49:16,940
Where's his room?

3364
03:49:17,500 --> 03:49:27,659
All right.

3365
03:49:27,659 --> 03:49:28,299
Nice.

3366
03:49:28,299 --> 03:49:31,450
I got enough money.

3367
03:49:31,450 --> 03:49:33,370
Now I got to find his personal belt?

3368
03:49:33,930 --> 03:49:38,159
Is this his room?

3369
03:49:38,159 --> 03:49:40,479
Second floor, basement, Ramirez mansion.

3370
03:49:41,040 --> 03:49:44,200
I feel like his room is still somewhere.

3371
03:49:45,280 --> 03:49:46,719
He's in the basement.

3372
03:49:46,719 --> 03:49:49,440
Do I have to go to the basement?

3373
03:49:49,440 --> 03:49:59,559
I'm on the first floor now.

3374
03:49:59,959 --> 03:50:01,979
Keep going.

3375
03:50:01,979 --> 03:50:09,049
Did he say there was a creature down here?

3376
03:50:11,899 --> 03:50:12,780
Like don't...

3377
03:50:12,780 --> 03:50:15,579
Watch out for that creature that you kept down there or something, right?

3378
03:50:15,579 --> 03:50:22,440
I don't see a creature.

3379
03:50:22,440 --> 03:50:34,829
Still in the basement.

3380
03:50:34,829 --> 03:50:35,469
This is a pretty...

3381
03:50:36,110 --> 03:50:40,190
I got a key though.

3382
03:50:40,190 --> 03:50:42,120
Hell yeah.

3383
03:50:48,079 --> 03:50:48,719
There's an alarm.

3384
03:50:49,440 --> 03:50:59,639
Oh, is that him?

3385
03:50:59,639 --> 03:50:59,879
That's him.

3386
03:50:59,879 --> 03:51:00,200
That's him.

3387
03:51:00,200 --> 03:51:00,440
That's him.

3388
03:51:00,440 --> 03:51:00,680
That's him.

3389
03:51:00,680 --> 03:51:01,079
That's him.

3390
03:51:01,079 --> 03:51:01,479
That's him.

3391
03:51:01,479 --> 03:51:01,959
I think that's him.

3392
03:51:02,600 --> 03:51:03,079
That's him.

3393
03:51:03,639 --> 03:51:05,770
Is that him?

3394
03:51:20,139 --> 03:51:31,659
The king sends his regards.

3395
03:51:43,870 --> 03:51:44,350
No!

3396
03:51:44,350 --> 03:51:45,549
I wanted to get the...

3397
03:51:45,549 --> 03:52:10,059
Yeah, there's like a bunch of shit in here.

3398
03:52:10,059 --> 03:52:11,899
I want to get the money first.

3399
03:52:11,899 --> 03:52:25,260
I'll just end the mission.

3400
03:52:25,260 --> 03:52:27,549
No.

3401
03:52:27,549 --> 03:52:28,110
Really?

3402
03:52:28,110 --> 03:52:29,360
How do I get in here?

3403
03:52:29,360 --> 03:52:32,399
Does he have a key?

3404
03:52:32,399 --> 03:52:38,329
I can't open these.

3405
03:52:38,329 --> 03:52:45,280
Here we go.

3406
03:52:45,280 --> 03:52:46,000
Hell yeah.

3407
03:52:46,000 --> 03:52:46,639
What's in here?

3408
03:52:46,639 --> 03:52:48,000
The other one works for this too, doesn't it?

3409
03:52:48,000 --> 03:52:50,379
Thank you very much.

3410
03:52:50,379 --> 03:52:51,959
What do you got?

3411
03:52:51,959 --> 03:53:04,600
Open it up.

3412
03:53:04,600 --> 03:53:05,399
Open it!

3413
03:53:05,399 --> 03:53:07,370
Nice.

3414
03:53:07,370 --> 03:53:07,530
All right.

3415
03:53:07,530 --> 03:53:08,729
I just want to get all the items.

3416
03:53:08,729 --> 03:53:11,579
All right.

3417
03:53:11,579 --> 03:53:11,979
Here we go.

3418
03:53:11,979 --> 03:53:12,540
Hell yeah.

3419
03:53:12,540 --> 03:53:23,629
That coke button?

3420
03:53:23,629 --> 03:53:24,110
Eh.

3421
03:53:24,110 --> 03:53:26,889
All right.

3422
03:53:26,889 --> 03:53:27,690
Cutscene coming up.

3423
03:53:27,690 --> 03:53:35,260
That was a cool mission.

3424
03:53:35,260 --> 03:53:36,760
I like that one.

3425
03:53:36,760 --> 03:53:44,569
Stealing fur and fang of beasts for survival.

3426
03:53:44,569 --> 03:53:50,479
Then came the builder who brought us the hammer.

3427
03:53:50,479 --> 03:53:52,959
And with it we forged a new way of life.

3428
03:53:57,399 --> 03:54:00,600
Reject the hammer is to denounce the builder.

3429
03:54:00,600 --> 03:54:01,719
Book of hammers.

3430
03:54:01,719 --> 03:54:06,280
I was going to pay a base collection a visit,

3431
03:54:06,280 --> 03:54:19,370
but the thing is that they haven't divvied the boot-eaters' base.

3432
03:54:20,399 --> 03:54:21,520
Sounds like they could use it.

3433
03:54:21,520 --> 03:54:22,479
What do you mean the creature?

3434
03:54:23,280 --> 03:54:25,120
There's a creature down there or something that I can like...

3435
03:54:26,079 --> 03:54:26,719
What do you want me to do?

3436
03:54:26,719 --> 03:54:28,989
Steal the base from them.

3437
03:54:28,989 --> 03:54:32,750
They'll be so busy blaming each other no one will suspect an outsider.

3438
03:54:34,750 --> 03:54:36,590
You can milk the creature.

3439
03:54:36,590 --> 03:54:37,469
It's a meme.

3440
03:54:37,469 --> 03:54:37,790
Okay.

3441
03:54:37,790 --> 03:54:38,430
Well, I don't...

3442
03:54:39,469 --> 03:54:40,670
I don't really care.

3443
03:54:40,670 --> 03:54:42,909
The guild's hideout is beneath the casino.

3444
03:54:43,549 --> 03:54:47,629
I have a rough map of the complex I got from sources from the inside.

3445
03:54:48,510 --> 03:54:50,270
Once I'm in the overlord's fancy,

3446
03:54:50,270 --> 03:54:52,909
I'll have to search for the secret entrance to the hideout.

3447
03:54:53,469 --> 03:54:54,590
I have to be careful.

3448
03:54:55,309 --> 03:54:57,309
The downwinders know me all too well.

3449
03:54:58,270 --> 03:54:59,790
If they catch sight of me, they'll know I took the base.

3450
03:54:59,790 --> 03:55:02,270
Nobody said you should really skip this mission.

3451
03:55:02,270 --> 03:55:04,590
They don't just kill me for trespassing.

3452
03:55:04,590 --> 03:55:05,309
Does this one suck?

3453
03:55:06,829 --> 03:55:10,829
Finding the base may prove difficult since I have no idea where it is.

3454
03:55:11,870 --> 03:55:14,590
It should be a hot topic of conversation among the down...

3455
03:55:14,590 --> 03:55:16,030
Skip this mission, it sucks.

3456
03:55:17,069 --> 03:55:17,950
Yes, this one sucks.

3457
03:55:19,149 --> 03:55:22,200
This is the worst mission in the game.

3458
03:55:22,200 --> 03:55:22,840
Skip this one.

3459
03:55:25,309 --> 03:55:26,510
I don't think I can skip missions.

3460
03:55:27,149 --> 03:55:32,350
This one has an incredibly confusing layout.

3461
03:55:34,200 --> 03:55:37,000
I mean, is it possible that I could bunny hop all the way to the end and pick up the item?

3462
03:55:38,170 --> 03:55:39,850
I skipped this one in my playthrough too.

3463
03:55:39,850 --> 03:55:40,409
Really?

3464
03:55:40,409 --> 03:55:41,049
Why is it so bad?

3465
03:55:41,690 --> 03:55:46,879
All right, break into the downwind thieves guild by breaking into the gambling den.

3466
03:55:47,600 --> 03:55:49,129
The overlord's fancy.

3467
03:55:49,690 --> 03:55:51,719
Thrive the sapphire vase.

3468
03:55:52,360 --> 03:55:55,290
Guild mates stealing the vase more difficult.

3469
03:55:55,290 --> 03:55:55,930
Make them pay.

3470
03:55:55,930 --> 03:55:57,770
Don't leave with less than a thousand in loot.

3471
03:55:58,329 --> 03:56:00,510
Get out of the guild and bat...

3472
03:56:00,510 --> 03:56:02,190
All right, so just take a thousand bucks.

3473
03:56:02,190 --> 03:56:03,229
Get the vase and get out.

3474
03:56:03,950 --> 03:56:05,389
Is he enough?

3475
03:56:11,280 --> 03:56:14,719
Uh, yeah, I'm taking like at least two of these.

3476
03:56:14,719 --> 03:56:20,989
Maybe not that many.

3477
03:56:20,989 --> 03:56:25,100
See you in four hours.

3478
03:56:27,239 --> 03:56:27,959
I can't even...

3479
03:56:27,959 --> 03:56:29,319
I don't think I can skip.

3480
03:56:29,319 --> 03:56:32,569
I'll figure it out.

3481
03:56:32,569 --> 03:56:33,450
Whatever.

3482
03:56:33,450 --> 03:56:37,399
I like the water arrows though.

3483
03:56:37,399 --> 03:56:38,120
They're very useful.

3484
03:56:38,680 --> 03:56:40,959
All right, that sounds good to me.

3485
03:56:41,920 --> 03:56:50,959
Okay, so yeah, that is a...

3486
03:56:51,760 --> 03:56:58,829
I feel like I have to go like this and lean in real close and get to about here.

3487
03:56:59,629 --> 03:57:03,819
And then the girl from the exorcist is going to scream in my face.

3488
03:57:03,819 --> 03:57:04,540
What is this map?

3489
03:57:10,680 --> 03:57:13,500
Okay.

3490
03:57:13,500 --> 03:57:14,299
Howdy.

3491
03:57:14,299 --> 03:57:21,790
What did I do wrong?

3492
03:57:21,790 --> 03:57:27,680
This guy's going to step on it.

3493
03:57:27,680 --> 03:57:30,399
I'm going to make you bleed.

3494
03:57:30,399 --> 03:57:31,600
Somebody step on it.

3495
03:57:34,540 --> 03:57:38,600
So what?

3496
03:57:38,600 --> 03:57:39,879
They don't like that I'm...

3497
03:57:39,879 --> 03:57:40,680
What do they don't...

3498
03:57:40,680 --> 03:57:41,159
All right, let me just...

3499
03:57:41,879 --> 03:57:45,180
Okay, they don't like me at all.

3500
03:57:45,180 --> 03:57:46,219
They don't want to see me at all.

3501
03:57:49,579 --> 03:57:50,299
Open the door.

3502
03:58:05,120 --> 03:58:05,520
Fuck you.

3503
03:58:06,319 --> 03:58:11,290
Okay.

3504
03:58:11,290 --> 03:58:15,290
So nobody can see me, which is weird because how am I supposed to walk by this?

3505
03:58:15,290 --> 03:58:19,399
Oh, what?

3506
03:58:19,399 --> 03:58:20,920
I can't even exist?

3507
03:58:20,920 --> 03:58:24,059
What are you talking about?

3508
03:58:24,059 --> 03:58:28,520
What am I doing?

3509
03:58:29,159 --> 03:58:31,309
I'm like passing out.

3510
03:58:31,309 --> 03:58:31,790
What's happening?

3511
03:58:43,340 --> 03:58:44,139
I think I have to sit here.

3512
03:58:45,819 --> 03:58:48,059
No, now he hasn't given me the password.

3513
03:58:48,059 --> 03:58:49,020
Are you tapping me?

3514
03:58:50,219 --> 03:58:51,260
He's tapping me?

3515
03:58:53,260 --> 03:58:56,540
And I'm standing here listening to Dano tell you the password.

3516
03:58:56,540 --> 03:58:59,100
Do you think he's going to let me if I'm not in the guild?

3517
03:58:59,100 --> 03:59:01,739
Or you think I'm lackwood enough not to remember it?

3518
03:59:01,739 --> 03:59:02,540
Shudder.

3519
03:59:02,540 --> 03:59:03,819
I'll put up with your airs.

3520
03:59:03,819 --> 03:59:05,920
I got you now, Tapper.

3521
03:59:05,920 --> 03:59:06,719
Shudder.

3522
03:59:06,719 --> 03:59:07,760
I'll put up with your airs.

3523
03:59:07,760 --> 03:59:08,399
Over here!

3524
03:59:08,399 --> 03:59:11,600
But if you start putting it like I'm not much of a fool, there will...

3525
03:59:14,889 --> 03:59:17,290
That guy still had to get his point across.

3526
03:59:29,500 --> 03:59:30,780
Excuse me?

3527
03:59:31,500 --> 03:59:32,780
He didn't see me at all.

3528
03:59:46,200 --> 03:59:47,159
Let me in too!

3529
03:59:49,799 --> 03:59:50,760
Big mistake.

3530
03:59:51,479 --> 03:59:53,959
You left the door wide open.

3531
03:59:57,209 --> 03:59:58,649
What are you doing in there?

3532
03:59:58,649 --> 03:59:59,610
You bastard!

3533
03:59:59,610 --> 04:00:04,010
Open up for me, please!

3534
04:00:04,010 --> 04:00:04,729
Knock, knock!

3535
04:00:05,370 --> 04:00:06,250
Anybody home?

3536
04:00:11,180 --> 04:00:12,139
See you right...

3537
04:00:12,700 --> 04:00:13,899
Late time.

3538
04:00:13,899 --> 04:00:26,110
What do I do now?

3539
04:00:26,110 --> 04:00:30,860
Let him talk.

3540
04:00:30,860 --> 04:00:40,379
I'm just every orc in every movie.

3541
04:00:40,379 --> 04:00:42,219
Let them do their little cutscene and I'll move on.

3542
04:01:14,360 --> 04:01:15,719
Not to remember it?

3543
04:01:15,719 --> 04:01:16,520
Shudder.

3544
04:01:16,520 --> 04:01:18,040
I'll put up with your airs a ways.

3545
04:01:18,040 --> 04:01:22,280
But if you start putting it like I'm not much of a fool, there will be blood.

3546
04:01:22,280 --> 04:01:23,399
Now open this door!

3547
04:01:28,090 --> 04:01:34,959
Pop the door, motherfucker!

3548
04:01:35,600 --> 04:01:59,360
Oh shit, there's a lady right there.

3549
04:02:09,159 --> 04:02:22,959
Ah!

3550
04:02:22,959 --> 04:02:23,680
I just...

3551
04:02:23,680 --> 04:02:24,479
I just might...

3552
04:02:24,479 --> 04:02:25,040
I just have...

3553
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:27,850
It's a GTA after just roast up of people.

3554
04:02:27,850 --> 04:02:29,209
All right, relax, relax, relax.

3555
04:02:32,120 --> 04:02:33,239
Didn't I save after this?

3556
04:02:33,799 --> 04:02:35,629
I saved after this already, didn't I?

3557
04:02:35,629 --> 04:02:36,829
You want to argue with the lords?

3558
04:02:36,829 --> 04:02:38,319
What's the password?

3559
04:02:38,319 --> 04:02:39,149
Whatever.

3560
04:02:39,149 --> 04:02:40,989
All right, just close my eyes and just wait.

3561
04:02:40,989 --> 04:02:42,510
Open the door, okay?

3562
04:02:42,510 --> 04:02:44,989
Well, now he hasn't given me the password.

3563
04:02:44,989 --> 04:02:45,950
Are you tapping me?

3564
04:02:46,909 --> 04:02:50,250
Security is necessary to prevent...

3565
04:02:50,250 --> 04:02:53,530
And I'm standing here listening to Dan O'Tell you the password.

3566
04:02:53,530 --> 04:02:56,090
You think he's gonna let me if I'm not in the guild?

3567
04:02:56,090 --> 04:02:58,329
Or you think I'm liquid enough not to remember it?

3568
04:02:58,329 --> 04:03:01,530
This reminds me of a local like car commercial.

3569
04:03:01,530 --> 04:03:03,680
If you start putting it like I'm much of a fool, there will be blood.

3570
04:03:03,680 --> 04:03:05,280
This is Larry and Steve's.

3571
04:03:06,159 --> 04:03:08,479
Larry and Steve's auto empire.

3572
04:03:08,479 --> 04:03:10,799
Come on down and visit me and Steve.

3573
04:03:10,799 --> 04:03:12,079
We'll take good care of you.

3574
04:03:12,719 --> 04:03:13,440
Are we good?

3575
04:03:14,000 --> 04:03:15,790
Where did he come from?

3576
04:03:18,719 --> 04:03:19,840
All right, I'm going this way.

3577
04:03:19,840 --> 04:03:21,920
I'm not just gonna go in the front door.

3578
04:03:21,920 --> 04:03:24,000
I think I got away with it.

3579
04:03:24,000 --> 04:03:24,239
I did.

3580
04:03:24,239 --> 04:03:24,719
Okay, let's go.

3581
04:03:25,360 --> 04:03:29,000
So I gotta get into the casino.

3582
04:03:29,000 --> 04:03:32,569
As you stole that from...

3583
04:03:32,569 --> 04:03:33,850
You know, there's a Justin Roiland joke.

3584
04:03:34,489 --> 04:03:46,409
Relax.

3585
04:03:46,409 --> 04:03:52,399
Okay, so is this the casino?

3586
04:03:56,639 --> 04:03:57,600
Save it.

3587
04:03:57,600 --> 04:04:02,190
It's so bright out here too.

3588
04:04:08,569 --> 04:04:09,129
Turn around.

3589
04:04:09,129 --> 04:04:09,629
Aye.

3590
04:04:10,170 --> 04:04:14,139
Okay, well, this is great.

3591
04:04:15,100 --> 04:04:16,860
Slowly walks up this hallway.

3592
04:04:16,860 --> 04:04:18,379
That's really fantastic.

3593
04:04:18,940 --> 04:04:25,260
You don't come all the way over here, right?

3594
04:04:25,819 --> 04:04:27,549
What the...

3595
04:04:28,110 --> 04:04:34,600
Okay, I'm hidden right here.

3596
04:04:35,239 --> 04:04:36,920
I could probably just smoke him, right?

3597
04:04:43,000 --> 04:04:43,719
This is dark.

3598
04:05:01,309 --> 04:05:02,110
Will there be keys on you?

3599
04:05:02,110 --> 04:05:03,229
All right, let's just take this guy.

3600
04:05:03,229 --> 04:05:09,950
Money helping doesn't work when you have a person.

3601
04:05:09,950 --> 04:05:15,739
Kind of does.

3602
04:05:15,739 --> 04:05:16,540
Yeah, it does.

3603
04:05:16,540 --> 04:05:21,340
All right, get into the casino.

3604
04:05:21,340 --> 04:05:22,299
Save it right here.

3605
04:05:22,299 --> 04:05:25,690
What is this place?

3606
04:05:25,690 --> 04:05:27,290
It's Merlin's workshop.

3607
04:05:27,290 --> 04:05:28,170
I don't know what this is.

3608
04:05:28,170 --> 04:05:34,670
It's locked.

3609
04:05:34,670 --> 04:05:48,139
None of these open.

3610
04:05:48,139 --> 04:05:50,809
Deliveries to the back door only.

3611
04:05:50,809 --> 04:05:51,930
Oh, I'm delivery.

3612
04:05:51,930 --> 04:05:53,520
I got a delivery for you.

3613
04:05:53,520 --> 04:06:04,670
Delivery.

3614
04:06:04,670 --> 04:06:19,959
Deliveries to the back door.

3615
04:06:19,959 --> 04:06:31,680
Hey.

3616
04:06:31,680 --> 04:06:32,180
Oh.

3617
04:06:36,110 --> 04:06:37,309
Wait, patience.

3618
04:06:37,309 --> 04:06:42,809
You don't come all the way over here, right?

3619
04:06:42,809 --> 04:06:44,700
Hope not.

3620
04:06:57,530 --> 04:07:17,500
All right, I'm in.

3621
04:07:17,500 --> 04:07:25,360
Oh, shit.

3622
04:07:25,360 --> 04:07:39,020
Where's his feet?

3623
04:07:39,020 --> 04:07:45,850
Oh, he's coming back.

3624
04:07:45,850 --> 04:08:18,569
I didn't know that that opened up to right there.

3625
04:08:28,889 --> 04:08:31,770
Oh, give me a break.

3626
04:08:31,770 --> 04:08:32,569
You didn't hear anything.

3627
04:08:32,569 --> 04:08:34,809
How would you hear that?

3628
04:08:34,809 --> 04:08:38,909
All right, I swear.

3629
04:08:38,909 --> 04:08:40,430
I gotta kill this guy right now.

3630
04:08:40,430 --> 04:08:42,239
I gotta wrap around and kill this guy.

3631
04:08:49,260 --> 04:08:49,739
Fuck.

3632
04:08:49,739 --> 04:08:53,440
I didn't mean to quick save.

3633
04:09:22,840 --> 04:09:27,360
Ron saved.

3634
04:09:28,120 --> 04:09:29,479
Ron has been officially saved.

3635
04:09:29,479 --> 04:09:30,120
We're okay.

3636
04:09:30,120 --> 04:09:44,299
All right, I gotta be more careful.

3637
04:09:44,299 --> 04:10:02,590
The door out of the way before I have a meltdown.

3638
04:10:02,590 --> 04:10:05,309
All right, relax.

3639
04:10:05,309 --> 04:10:06,489
Slow down.

3640
04:10:06,489 --> 04:10:12,620
Keep your mouth shut.

3641
04:10:12,620 --> 04:10:13,100
Keep your mouth shut.

3642
04:10:13,100 --> 04:10:13,659
Keep your mouth shut.

3643
04:10:13,659 --> 04:10:14,379
Keep your mouth shut.

3644
04:10:14,379 --> 04:10:15,100
Keep your mouth shut.

3645
04:10:15,100 --> 04:10:15,739
I'm gonna let you live.

3646
04:10:15,739 --> 04:10:16,540
Keep your mouth shut.

3647
04:10:16,540 --> 04:10:17,659
Keep your mouth shut.

3648
04:10:17,659 --> 04:10:18,860
You're gonna keep your mouth shut?

3649
04:10:18,860 --> 04:10:33,549
Gave him a chance.

3650
04:10:33,549 --> 04:10:34,670
I gave him an opportunity.

3651
04:10:35,229 --> 04:10:43,709
This looks like Wolfenstein.

3652
04:10:43,709 --> 04:10:44,989
Like this, the other ground.

3653
04:10:45,549 --> 04:10:54,479
What's down here?

3654
04:10:56,860 --> 04:11:01,209
I'll do that later.

3655
04:11:01,209 --> 04:11:20,809
Did he have a key on him or anything?

3656
04:11:20,809 --> 04:11:26,430
Line it up.

3657
04:11:26,430 --> 04:11:42,639
He wasn't doing anything?

3658
04:11:42,639 --> 04:11:44,959
If he had gotten up, I'm in a lot of trouble.

3659
04:11:44,959 --> 04:11:51,870
That's one less person to walk around and find me.

3660
04:11:51,870 --> 04:12:03,319
You have bloodlust.

3661
04:12:03,319 --> 04:12:05,239
I don't have bloodlust.

3662
04:12:05,239 --> 04:12:07,319
I'm just trying to think things realistically.

3663
04:12:07,319 --> 04:12:09,629
I'm just playing a video game.

3664
04:12:09,629 --> 04:12:12,959
If that guy gets up, I'm in trouble.

3665
04:12:12,959 --> 04:12:14,879
And you know for a fact I'm gonna throw a box at somebody

3666
04:12:14,879 --> 04:12:18,159
and he's gonna go from this line like this to

3667
04:12:18,159 --> 04:12:18,879
Oh, what was that?

3668
04:12:18,879 --> 04:12:20,000
And run straight out the door.

3669
04:12:20,000 --> 04:12:30,040
Like I'm not gonna have that chance.

3670
04:12:30,040 --> 04:12:30,840
I'm gonna go in here.

3671
04:12:30,840 --> 04:12:37,000
I don't wanna get hurt though.

3672
04:12:37,000 --> 04:12:37,959
Can I crouch and...

3673
04:12:38,840 --> 04:12:40,120
I have to take that damage.

3674
04:12:40,120 --> 04:12:41,079
That sucks.

3675
04:12:41,079 --> 04:12:51,680
Why am I...

3676
04:12:51,680 --> 04:12:52,079
This is like...

3677
04:12:53,680 --> 04:12:56,159
What's that game?

3678
04:12:58,510 --> 04:13:00,350
Boardwalk Empire.

3679
04:13:00,350 --> 04:13:06,959
A game with the music and it's hard

3680
04:13:06,959 --> 04:13:09,040
and you run around through the hallways and it's top down.

3681
04:13:09,040 --> 04:13:10,319
Hotline Miami.

3682
04:13:10,319 --> 04:13:18,079
Secret door.

3683
04:13:18,079 --> 04:13:18,319
All right.

3684
04:13:18,319 --> 04:13:18,879
Where am I?

3685
04:13:23,200 --> 04:13:25,840
They're so busy gambling their money away.

3686
04:13:25,840 --> 04:13:28,010
Notice if I take a bit.

3687
04:13:36,520 --> 04:13:38,440
Oh, he got a big key on him.

3688
04:13:38,440 --> 04:13:45,440
There's nobody even down here.

3689
04:13:45,440 --> 04:13:46,479
Just take everything.

3690
04:13:46,479 --> 04:13:48,969
Shit.

3691
04:13:48,969 --> 04:13:49,690
There are people here.

3692
04:14:21,799 --> 04:14:22,520
Can I play Blackjack?

3693
04:14:42,540 --> 04:14:43,819
How am I supposed to get by this?

3694
04:14:44,379 --> 04:14:51,530
I guess I can go...

3695
04:14:51,530 --> 04:14:53,129
Wait, there might be more stuff over here.

3696
04:14:53,129 --> 04:14:53,530
There is.

3697
04:14:53,530 --> 04:14:54,090
Of course there is.

3698
04:15:07,120 --> 04:15:07,600
Yes.

3699
04:15:08,879 --> 04:15:09,280
Yes.

3700
04:15:17,760 --> 04:15:17,920
All right.

3701
04:15:17,920 --> 04:15:19,280
There's more tables over here.

3702
04:15:19,280 --> 04:15:31,229
Now over here.

3703
04:15:31,229 --> 04:15:33,549
I don't spin the roulette table.

3704
04:15:33,549 --> 04:15:46,829
I did not know that was gonna happen.

3705
04:15:46,829 --> 04:15:48,760
All right.

3706
04:15:48,760 --> 04:15:49,479
I gotta go this way.

3707
04:15:49,479 --> 04:15:50,920
No, actually let me go over here first.

3708
04:16:18,090 --> 04:16:24,239
Jeremy, you gotta...

3709
04:16:24,239 --> 04:16:24,639
I'm not...

3710
04:16:24,639 --> 04:16:25,760
There's nobody to milk.

3711
04:16:26,879 --> 04:16:27,280
Relax.

3712
04:16:27,840 --> 04:16:39,559
Piece of shit.

3713
04:16:39,559 --> 04:16:40,600
I swear to God.

3714
04:16:40,600 --> 04:16:42,040
This guy's walking around.

3715
04:16:42,040 --> 04:16:50,110
All right.

3716
04:16:50,110 --> 04:16:51,309
Take out the torches.

3717
04:16:51,309 --> 04:16:53,149
Thanks for the reminder, video game.

3718
04:16:56,440 --> 04:16:59,319
Much better.

3719
04:16:59,319 --> 04:17:00,360
You don't even see anything.

3720
04:17:00,360 --> 04:17:01,000
Shut up.

3721
04:17:01,000 --> 04:17:41,950
All right.

3722
04:17:41,950 --> 04:17:43,229
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

3723
04:18:04,569 --> 04:18:04,889
Fuck.

3724
04:18:05,850 --> 04:18:11,899
There's so much stuff in here.

3725
04:18:11,899 --> 04:18:15,739
What am I supposed to do about this?

3726
04:18:15,739 --> 04:18:17,020
Look at all the stuff that's back here.

3727
04:18:17,579 --> 04:18:22,319
They have light over here.

3728
04:18:22,319 --> 04:18:22,639
I know.

3729
04:18:22,639 --> 04:18:24,079
But there's so much cool stuff.

3730
04:18:28,350 --> 04:18:28,829
I guess I could...

3731
04:18:28,829 --> 04:18:30,510
Can I go around the other side?

3732
04:18:30,510 --> 04:18:31,709
Moss arrows?

3733
04:18:31,709 --> 04:18:33,790
That's a good idea.

3734
04:18:33,790 --> 04:18:34,590
That's a really...

3735
04:18:34,590 --> 04:18:35,870
That's actually a brilliant idea.

3736
04:18:55,280 --> 04:19:06,409
Oh, what do I do?

3737
04:19:06,409 --> 04:19:13,129
Too jumpy.

3738
04:19:13,129 --> 04:19:21,450
Who's there?

3739
04:19:21,450 --> 04:19:22,969
Hey, there's an intruder here.

3740
04:19:32,040 --> 04:19:32,760
Whatever.

3741
04:19:32,760 --> 04:19:33,719
I'm just gonna leave.

3742
04:19:33,719 --> 04:19:40,430
What's with this light?

3743
04:19:41,920 --> 04:19:42,159
Dude.

3744
04:19:42,159 --> 04:19:42,799
I thought I saw something.

3745
04:19:42,799 --> 04:19:59,850
Guess it was nothing.

3746
04:19:59,850 --> 04:20:01,850
Did I just see what I think I saw?

3747
04:20:03,450 --> 04:20:06,350
Stay right there, Garrett.

3748
04:20:07,069 --> 04:20:12,350
Oh, shit.

3749
04:20:12,989 --> 04:20:19,850
I'm a genius, I think.

3750
04:20:20,489 --> 04:20:22,959
Oh, he's got a gold key.

3751
04:20:22,959 --> 04:20:23,360
All right.

3752
04:20:23,360 --> 04:20:23,920
Let me in.

3753
04:20:23,920 --> 04:20:24,399
Oh, my God.

3754
04:20:24,399 --> 04:20:24,719
I figured...

3755
04:20:24,719 --> 04:20:28,250
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

3756
04:20:28,250 --> 04:20:30,010
I'm stuck on the guy's body.

3757
04:20:30,010 --> 04:20:32,829
I'm stuck on his body.

3758
04:20:32,829 --> 04:20:33,870
Get off his body, please.

3759
04:20:34,590 --> 04:20:41,950
Cut up.

3760
04:20:46,430 --> 04:21:05,360
Okay, I got the one.

3761
04:21:05,360 --> 04:21:06,239
I don't care.

3762
04:21:06,239 --> 04:21:13,340
Oh, shit.

3763
04:21:13,340 --> 04:21:14,379
Oh, shit.

3764
04:21:14,379 --> 04:21:15,020
Oh, shit.

3765
04:21:16,090 --> 04:21:16,809
Oh, shit.

3766
04:21:17,760 --> 04:21:18,479
Oh, shit.

3767
04:21:18,479 --> 04:21:19,440
Don't hurt me.

3768
04:21:19,440 --> 04:21:20,239
Oh, shit.

3769
04:21:20,799 --> 04:21:21,440
Oh, shit.

3770
04:21:21,440 --> 04:21:21,920
Don't hurt me.

3771
04:21:22,479 --> 04:21:23,739
Oh, shit.

3772
04:21:23,739 --> 04:21:29,000
Get away, get away, get away, get away.

3773
04:21:29,000 --> 04:21:30,440
Don't get away with the explosion.

3774
04:21:30,440 --> 04:21:41,309
I can't go over there.

3775
04:21:41,309 --> 04:21:47,229
Walk on that.

3776
04:21:47,229 --> 04:21:48,350
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3777
04:21:48,350 --> 04:21:54,190
Don't turn the alarm on.

3778
04:21:54,190 --> 04:21:54,510
Got him.

3779
04:21:55,709 --> 04:22:08,989
Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.

3780
04:22:08,989 --> 04:22:09,549
Hide.

3781
04:22:09,549 --> 04:22:11,069
Hide, hide.

3782
04:22:11,069 --> 04:22:12,190
Hide, hide, hide.

3783
04:22:12,190 --> 04:22:18,889
He's gonna step on the landmine.

3784
04:22:18,889 --> 04:22:30,559
I'm good.

3785
04:22:30,559 --> 04:22:34,319
You stepped on a landmine, my friend.

3786
04:22:34,319 --> 04:22:36,959
You stepped on a landmine and you're fine?

3787
04:22:47,760 --> 04:22:49,280
Thank God you have potion on you.

3788
04:22:49,280 --> 04:22:54,719
Can I, like, get rid of their bodies?

3789
04:22:56,479 --> 04:23:03,819
I don't think this works.

3790
04:23:03,819 --> 04:23:04,860
I'm gonna drink that potion.

3791
04:23:04,860 --> 04:23:12,280
What's going on?

3792
04:23:12,280 --> 04:23:15,000
What's going on?

3793
04:23:15,799 --> 04:23:21,120
Oh, my God, you have money.

3794
04:23:21,120 --> 04:23:35,930
What's happening?

3795
04:23:35,930 --> 04:23:36,889
Wait, are they not...

3796
04:23:36,889 --> 04:23:37,770
I thought they were dead.

3797
04:23:37,770 --> 04:23:40,969
They're only knocked out?

3798
04:23:40,969 --> 04:23:44,319
I thought you said I was killing people.

3799
04:23:44,959 --> 04:23:46,399
I didn't know I was doing this.

3800
04:23:46,399 --> 04:23:54,670
I thought I was just getting rid of the bodies.

3801
04:23:54,670 --> 04:23:55,309
Okay.

3802
04:23:55,309 --> 04:24:08,969
Oh, he sees me.

3803
04:24:09,610 --> 04:24:10,489
He sees me.

3804
04:24:10,489 --> 04:24:12,760
The other guy's just blocking him.

3805
04:24:12,760 --> 04:24:13,559
Secret!

3806
04:24:13,559 --> 04:24:32,510
Can't break that.

3807
04:24:32,510 --> 04:24:33,629
Water arrow, please.

3808
04:24:52,170 --> 04:24:52,889
I'm not gonna do it.

3809
04:24:52,889 --> 04:24:55,049
I promised I wouldn't do it ever again.

3810
04:24:55,049 --> 04:24:55,610
Didn't he have...

3811
04:24:55,610 --> 04:24:56,649
Yeah, okay, I got it, right?

3812
04:24:56,649 --> 04:25:04,319
I got it.

3813
04:25:04,319 --> 04:25:10,989
All right, secret in the fireplace.

3814
04:25:10,989 --> 04:25:14,350
Use the back door, 47, if you must visit.

3815
04:25:14,350 --> 04:25:17,159
I don't give a damn what it does to your clothes.

3816
04:25:17,159 --> 04:25:19,959
I will not risk Ruben's scum following you in.

3817
04:25:19,959 --> 04:25:24,139
Until I get my key back and the vase sitting on my mantelpiece,

3818
04:25:24,139 --> 04:25:26,219
you're just going to have to tolerate the inconvenience.

3819
04:25:28,040 --> 04:25:47,420
I need the sapphire vase and I need a thousand bucks.

3820
04:25:47,420 --> 04:25:49,280
Sapphire vase.

3821
04:25:49,280 --> 04:25:50,399
Where would I be?

3822
04:25:50,399 --> 04:25:51,959
What an awful map.

3823
04:25:51,959 --> 04:25:53,639
I might as well just guess.

3824
04:25:53,639 --> 04:26:07,100
I have absolutely no idea where this would be.

3825
04:26:07,100 --> 04:26:11,479
So Overlord's Fancy?

3826
04:26:11,479 --> 04:26:16,540
I wonder...

3827
04:26:16,540 --> 04:26:17,500
In the fire.

3828
04:26:17,500 --> 04:26:19,659
Hold on.

3829
04:26:19,659 --> 04:26:23,930
Did he go over here?

3830
04:26:23,930 --> 04:26:26,270
He did not, okay.

3831
04:26:35,319 --> 04:26:39,600
He doesn't know where I am.

3832
04:26:39,600 --> 04:26:54,239
You wuss.

3833
04:26:56,590 --> 04:26:57,309
Wuss!

3834
04:26:57,309 --> 04:27:04,719
Don't let that guy ring the bell!

3835
04:27:04,719 --> 04:27:06,719
Why do you have to just run all over the place?

3836
04:27:06,719 --> 04:27:18,350
What are you doing?

3837
04:27:19,159 --> 04:27:20,200
Okay, I'm fine.

3838
04:27:20,200 --> 04:27:33,420
I'm supposed to be a dead lady too.

3839
04:27:33,420 --> 04:27:45,420
Let me give it to you straight.

3840
04:27:45,420 --> 04:27:48,540
The guy that you work for is a real bad guy.

3841
04:27:48,540 --> 04:27:50,510
He's a mean person.

3842
04:27:50,510 --> 04:27:52,250
He's corrupt.

3843
04:27:52,250 --> 04:27:54,409
He has all kinds of awful shit going on.

3844
04:27:54,409 --> 04:27:56,219
I'm just telling you right now,

3845
04:27:57,020 --> 04:27:58,780
I'm giving you an opportunity for you to go,

3846
04:27:58,780 --> 04:28:00,219
for you to get out and leave.

3847
04:28:00,780 --> 04:28:02,459
I'm going to take a bunch of shit from this guy

3848
04:28:02,459 --> 04:28:03,500
because he's a bad guy.

3849
04:28:03,500 --> 04:28:06,299
Someone's searching for something and we'll get the tap.

3850
04:28:06,299 --> 04:28:08,030
Exactly what I'm talking about.

3851
04:28:08,030 --> 04:28:08,430
Exactly.

3852
04:28:08,430 --> 04:28:09,790
So you and I are on the same page.

3853
04:28:11,290 --> 04:28:12,729
I mean, if you feel like it,

3854
04:28:12,729 --> 04:28:14,809
you can just kind of forget that I was here

3855
04:28:14,809 --> 04:28:16,809
and we can just go on with our days.

3856
04:28:16,809 --> 04:28:21,440
Yeah, there's a dead guy right here, but don't worry.

3857
04:28:21,440 --> 04:28:23,120
I'm not going to shoot another arrow at you.

3858
04:28:23,120 --> 04:28:31,799
I know this is going to be really gruesome,

3859
04:28:31,799 --> 04:28:33,000
but this is just how it is.

3860
04:28:33,739 --> 04:28:34,540
Welcome to the business.

3861
04:28:35,920 --> 04:28:37,280
I don't know if you knew this person or not,

3862
04:28:37,280 --> 04:28:39,280
but they were potentially bad.

3863
04:28:40,000 --> 04:28:41,280
They were trying to shoot me with arrows.

3864
04:28:41,840 --> 04:28:43,850
I thought we had an understanding.

3865
04:28:43,850 --> 04:28:45,069
I thought we had an understanding.

3866
04:28:45,870 --> 04:28:46,829
I thought we had an understanding.

3867
04:28:47,389 --> 04:29:05,370
How do I get down here?

3868
04:29:06,649 --> 04:29:09,370
Over here, he has a sword.

3869
04:29:09,370 --> 04:29:11,530
Oh, yes.

3870
04:29:11,530 --> 04:29:12,329
Hi.

3871
04:29:12,329 --> 04:29:12,889
How are you?

3872
04:29:13,610 --> 04:29:14,809
There ain't nobody left.

3873
04:29:16,540 --> 04:29:17,659
All the guards are dead.

3874
04:29:18,590 --> 04:29:19,629
I just, you know what?

3875
04:29:19,629 --> 04:29:20,909
I'm just trying to help here.

3876
04:29:21,850 --> 04:29:22,889
There's nobody left.

3877
04:29:22,889 --> 04:29:24,489
I killed all the guards.

3878
04:29:24,489 --> 04:29:25,370
Yes, I have a sword.

3879
04:29:25,370 --> 04:29:26,649
Yes, I have a bow and arrow.

3880
04:29:26,649 --> 04:29:27,530
I'm not going to hurt you.

3881
04:29:28,489 --> 04:29:29,610
I'm not going to.

3882
04:29:29,610 --> 04:29:30,250
Please leave.

3883
04:29:31,530 --> 04:29:33,450
Go into like a Minecraft gold dungeon.

3884
04:29:36,190 --> 04:29:37,229
Oh, holy shit.

3885
04:29:37,229 --> 04:29:38,989
Oh my God, you led me to the sacred room.

3886
04:29:40,969 --> 04:29:44,329
Uh, Davey, till Dono and Ruben quit their bitching,

3887
04:29:44,329 --> 04:29:46,090
best we just stick to our own turf.

3888
04:29:46,090 --> 04:29:53,920
I'm too much Dono's man to risk it.

3889
04:29:53,920 --> 04:30:01,870
All right.

3890
04:30:01,870 --> 04:30:03,629
He has a sword.

3891
04:30:06,409 --> 04:30:08,090
This lady, I swear to God.

3892
04:30:18,090 --> 04:30:20,329
Okay, I've not gone down here yet.

3893
04:30:20,329 --> 04:30:20,889
Let's save it.

3894
04:30:27,770 --> 04:30:30,409
I wonder if there's something down here.

3895
04:30:30,409 --> 04:31:00,090
This doesn't open.

3896
04:31:00,090 --> 04:31:02,760
Where am I going?

3897
04:31:02,760 --> 04:31:04,559
It's the creature.

3898
04:31:04,559 --> 04:31:06,079
This creature, it's a spider.

3899
04:31:06,079 --> 04:31:06,719
Relax.

3900
04:31:06,719 --> 04:31:14,600
It's loud.

3901
04:31:14,600 --> 04:31:15,639
I can't break those though.

3902
04:31:15,639 --> 04:31:22,430
Am I going the right way?

3903
04:31:22,430 --> 04:31:31,579
Dude, okay.

3904
04:31:31,579 --> 04:31:35,600
I have no idea.

3905
04:31:35,600 --> 04:31:36,780
I hope this is the right way.

3906
04:31:55,180 --> 04:31:56,860
I couldn't do anything about that.

3907
04:31:57,920 --> 04:31:58,420
Thank you.

3908
04:32:09,309 --> 04:32:10,430
I said I heard vase.

3909
04:32:10,430 --> 04:32:11,469
I heard vase action.

3910
04:32:18,940 --> 04:32:19,659
I heard vase.

3911
04:32:20,219 --> 04:32:24,959
Holy shit, you're awful.

3912
04:32:25,680 --> 04:32:26,159
Oh, okay.

3913
04:32:26,159 --> 04:32:27,120
You got me with that one.

3914
04:32:27,120 --> 04:32:27,920
That one was in the head.

3915
04:32:28,559 --> 04:32:29,520
That one was in the face.

3916
04:32:32,030 --> 04:32:33,149
Yeah, that was actually not bad.

3917
04:32:33,709 --> 04:32:34,430
That was not bad.

3918
04:32:35,719 --> 04:32:36,600
But now you pissed me off.

3919
04:32:40,920 --> 04:33:00,000
Climb the ladder.

3920
04:33:00,000 --> 04:33:01,159
All right.

3921
04:33:01,159 --> 04:33:02,520
Vase is down here somewhere.

3922
04:33:02,520 --> 04:33:15,639
My god.

3923
04:33:33,069 --> 04:33:33,630
Huh?

3924
04:33:33,630 --> 04:33:42,479
Oh, now you have a sword.

3925
04:33:42,479 --> 04:33:52,860
I don't like it.

3926
04:33:52,860 --> 04:33:55,369
Stop running.

3927
04:33:55,369 --> 04:33:56,409
Stop running.

3928
04:33:56,409 --> 04:33:57,369
Open this door.

3929
04:33:57,369 --> 04:33:59,360
Open this door right now.

3930
04:33:59,360 --> 04:34:06,040
Open this door right now.

3931
04:34:06,040 --> 04:34:17,599
Shit.

3932
04:34:17,599 --> 04:34:19,040
I'm actually kind of glad I got stuck.

3933
04:34:19,040 --> 04:34:21,959
Anybody have the keys on them?

3934
04:34:21,959 --> 04:34:22,520
No.

3935
04:34:22,520 --> 04:34:25,180
I need health.

3936
04:34:25,180 --> 04:34:25,819
Cucumber.

3937
04:34:30,540 --> 04:34:31,180
Save it here.

3938
04:34:31,180 --> 04:34:33,799
Now, what is going on with this?

3939
04:34:33,799 --> 04:34:36,680
This is blocked.

3940
04:34:36,680 --> 04:34:43,400
47.

3941
04:34:43,400 --> 04:34:43,880
47.

3942
04:34:43,880 --> 04:34:45,479
What does it say something about 47?

3943
04:34:45,479 --> 04:34:46,360
What was it?

3944
04:34:46,360 --> 04:34:52,540
I have to get in here.

3945
04:34:52,540 --> 04:34:55,880
I can't get in here though.

3946
04:34:58,639 --> 04:34:59,520
Is there a drill?

3947
04:34:59,520 --> 04:35:15,450
I think I got to go this way.

3948
04:35:29,150 --> 04:35:45,680
What do you want me to tell you?

3949
04:35:45,680 --> 04:35:53,340
Like, I gave her like 100 opportunities to leave.

3950
04:35:53,340 --> 04:35:55,900
She's just yelling and she's going to get attention called to here.

3951
04:35:55,900 --> 04:35:56,220
All right.

3952
04:35:56,220 --> 04:35:57,979
Now, what do I need to do?

3953
04:35:58,619 --> 04:36:01,450
I need the sapphire vase.

3954
04:36:01,450 --> 04:36:02,889
47 is over here.

3955
04:36:02,889 --> 04:36:07,229
What do I do with this though?

3956
04:36:07,229 --> 04:36:08,349
I can go over.

3957
04:36:08,990 --> 04:36:09,389
I don't know.

3958
04:36:10,029 --> 04:36:16,959
There's a tunnel in the water.

3959
04:36:17,599 --> 04:36:20,270
You mean like down here?

3960
04:36:20,270 --> 04:36:24,009
Look at you.

3961
04:36:24,810 --> 04:36:32,060
Can I open that?

3962
04:36:32,060 --> 04:36:32,700
Can't open that.

3963
04:36:36,060 --> 04:36:37,020
100 opportunities.

3964
04:36:37,020 --> 04:36:37,259
I did.

3965
04:36:37,259 --> 04:36:38,060
I really did.

3966
04:36:38,060 --> 04:36:39,290
47.

3967
04:36:39,290 --> 04:36:39,610
There it is.

3968
04:36:40,250 --> 04:36:42,540
All right.

3969
04:36:42,540 --> 04:36:43,099
47.

3970
04:36:43,659 --> 04:36:49,840
47.

3971
04:36:49,840 --> 04:36:50,319
48.

3972
04:36:50,880 --> 04:36:56,279
What is this for?

3973
04:36:56,279 --> 04:37:02,279
Should I just do them both?

3974
04:37:02,279 --> 04:37:06,240
Is there something?

3975
04:37:06,240 --> 04:37:06,959
There are doors.

3976
04:37:20,619 --> 04:37:23,099
Open 48.

3977
04:37:23,099 --> 04:37:24,459
Literally writing in the wall.

3978
04:37:24,459 --> 04:37:25,099
Good puzzle.

3979
04:37:25,099 --> 04:37:26,680
I mean, yeah.

3980
04:37:26,680 --> 04:37:28,349
But so what?

3981
04:37:28,349 --> 04:37:33,240
Milk?

3982
04:37:33,240 --> 04:37:44,250
So I opened the door that's labeled 47.

3983
04:37:44,250 --> 04:37:45,849
I remember even a door labeled 47.

3984
04:37:51,049 --> 04:37:53,450
Get me out of the water.

3985
04:37:53,450 --> 04:37:55,950
What's this?

3986
04:37:55,950 --> 04:38:07,259
So I opened that.

3987
04:38:07,259 --> 04:38:08,810
Does that do anything?

3988
04:38:08,810 --> 04:38:10,250
Should up here or something?

3989
04:38:10,250 --> 04:38:10,650
I don't know.

3990
04:38:14,840 --> 04:38:15,080
Yeah.

3991
04:38:15,080 --> 04:38:15,959
47.

3992
04:38:15,959 --> 04:38:16,840
48.

3993
04:38:16,840 --> 04:38:25,560
Something back here?

3994
04:38:25,560 --> 04:38:26,599
I have no idea.

3995
04:38:26,599 --> 04:38:37,979
49.

3996
04:38:37,979 --> 04:38:38,700
Well, shit.

3997
04:38:38,700 --> 04:38:39,500
I don't know where to go.

3998
04:38:39,500 --> 04:38:42,669
I remember this level was really-

3999
04:38:42,669 --> 04:38:44,509
There's a window on the other end.

4000
04:38:44,509 --> 04:38:49,400
Two doors in tunnel from before.

4001
04:38:49,400 --> 04:38:50,040
Window.

4002
04:38:50,040 --> 04:38:52,520
Like back here?

4003
04:39:00,040 --> 04:39:02,889
Uh, like here?

4004
04:39:02,889 --> 04:39:07,930
What's over here?

4005
04:39:11,869 --> 04:39:13,229
Actually, unironically skip this.

4006
04:39:13,229 --> 04:39:14,189
This level sucks.

4007
04:39:14,189 --> 04:39:17,720
I think I just found it.

4008
04:39:35,229 --> 04:39:36,669
Nothing's so tame.

4009
04:39:36,669 --> 04:39:39,069
He can scarf out the way he came quick enough.

4010
04:39:39,069 --> 04:39:43,069
But he don't want to go till he sweeps everything on the dresser.

4011
04:39:43,069 --> 04:39:44,990
Jewelry, candlesticks, whatnot.

4012
04:39:44,990 --> 04:39:46,029
Into his sack.

4013
04:39:46,029 --> 04:39:47,869
Gets halfway down the stairs.

4014
04:39:47,869 --> 04:39:49,630
When the sack starts leaping about-

4015
04:39:49,630 --> 04:39:51,310
This is like Owen Wilson.

4016
04:39:51,310 --> 04:39:55,680
He's cut the lady's cat, too, from the sack.

4017
04:39:55,680 --> 04:39:58,000
Everything falls out except the cat.

4018
04:39:58,000 --> 04:40:00,720
And that's halfway up his arm with claws every which way.

4019
04:40:03,340 --> 04:40:05,979
He had to jump in the river to get the damn thing off.

4020
04:40:06,540 --> 04:40:09,740
Left a trail of blood and water over half the city just going home.

4021
04:40:15,900 --> 04:40:24,590
Oh, actually, I bugged the cutscene.

4022
04:40:24,590 --> 04:40:24,909
Perfect.

4023
04:40:31,439 --> 04:40:32,080
Hey.

4024
04:40:32,080 --> 04:40:38,400
Into the dark, into the dark.

4025
04:40:38,400 --> 04:40:38,959
Down, down, down.

4026
04:40:38,959 --> 04:40:41,849
Okay, save.

4027
04:40:41,849 --> 04:40:44,490
This guy was stealing something from the dressers.

4028
04:41:06,139 --> 04:41:07,259
I gotta get this other guy, too.

4029
04:41:07,259 --> 04:41:08,779
He walks all the way over here.

4030
04:41:08,779 --> 04:41:09,419
Watch.

4031
04:41:09,419 --> 04:41:27,279
Here we go.

4032
04:41:27,279 --> 04:41:28,080
No, he didn't see anything.

4033
04:41:28,639 --> 04:41:32,459
This is a good hiding spot.

4034
04:41:33,099 --> 04:41:34,669
I'm gonna use this as a hiding spot.

4035
04:41:37,080 --> 04:41:38,520
Yeah, this is a good spot to hide.

4036
04:41:38,520 --> 04:41:46,540
I can go even deeper or let me let me peruse this area first.

4037
04:41:46,540 --> 04:41:48,509
Probably something here.

4038
04:41:48,509 --> 04:42:08,349
Is that money behind the bed?

4039
04:42:10,250 --> 04:42:10,810
It is.

4040
04:42:11,450 --> 04:42:12,330
Very nice.

4041
04:42:12,330 --> 04:42:28,299
Explosive barrel.

4042
04:42:28,299 --> 04:42:28,939
Oh, come on.

4043
04:42:28,939 --> 04:42:31,419
I thought these were bags of like Scrooge McDuck money.

4044
04:42:31,419 --> 04:42:32,799
Whatever.

4045
04:42:32,799 --> 04:42:52,520
There he is.

4046
04:42:52,520 --> 04:42:53,080
Got him.

4047
04:42:53,080 --> 04:42:53,720
Thank God.

4048
04:42:53,720 --> 04:42:59,639
All right.

4049
04:42:59,639 --> 04:43:00,439
What's in here?

4050
04:43:00,439 --> 04:43:01,319
Nothing.

4051
04:43:01,319 --> 04:43:09,130
Why are the bricks sideways?

4052
04:43:09,130 --> 04:43:12,319
I don't know.

4053
04:43:12,319 --> 04:43:27,290
Anybody in here?

4054
04:43:27,290 --> 04:43:29,369
Treasure in here, though.

4055
04:43:29,369 --> 04:43:30,090
Oh, hell yeah.

4056
04:43:32,830 --> 04:43:34,430
I definitely have to be at the threshold now, right?

4057
04:43:34,750 --> 04:43:36,029
I don't have a thousand bucks yet.

4058
04:43:36,029 --> 04:43:36,590
How?

4059
04:43:36,590 --> 04:43:39,740
That seems impossible.

4060
04:43:39,740 --> 04:43:53,639
Can I get this one, too?

4061
04:43:53,639 --> 04:43:56,200
I can't unsee the vertical bricks now.

4062
04:43:56,200 --> 04:43:57,080
It's weird.

4063
04:43:57,080 --> 04:44:05,580
Oh, nice.

4064
04:44:05,580 --> 04:44:10,080
Don't throw a piece of dynamite in here, please.

4065
04:44:10,080 --> 04:44:10,639
Nothing?

4066
04:44:10,639 --> 04:44:14,139
What a terrible room.

4067
04:44:14,139 --> 04:44:14,700
Give me a break.

4068
04:44:14,700 --> 04:44:27,689
Too many imaginings.

4069
04:44:30,569 --> 04:44:31,290
It was real.

4070
04:44:31,290 --> 04:45:04,430
Don't think you can hide for-

4071
04:45:04,430 --> 04:45:05,229
Yeah, you-

4072
04:45:05,229 --> 04:45:08,009
We've got an intruder.

4073
04:45:08,009 --> 04:45:09,529
How have you not triggered this?

4074
04:45:10,090 --> 04:45:11,450
How have you not triggered this?

4075
04:45:14,240 --> 04:45:14,880
Excuse me.

4076
04:45:14,880 --> 04:45:23,240
I guess it was nothing.

4077
04:45:23,240 --> 04:45:29,040
What's that?

4078
04:45:29,040 --> 04:45:34,330
Oh, shit.

4079
04:45:34,330 --> 04:45:34,810
Someone's coming.

4080
04:45:40,400 --> 04:45:45,479
That I'm hidden?

4081
04:45:45,479 --> 04:45:45,959
No.

4082
04:45:45,959 --> 04:45:48,830
Skip this level.

4083
04:45:48,830 --> 04:45:49,549
I'm probably-

4084
04:45:49,549 --> 04:45:51,069
I'm almost at the end of the level, probably.

4085
04:45:51,069 --> 04:45:52,729
We're probably right at the end.

4086
04:45:52,729 --> 04:45:55,689
For the last time, tell the maid to stay out of the banner room

4087
04:45:55,689 --> 04:45:58,029
and don't touch anything in it.

4088
04:45:58,029 --> 04:46:00,110
It is the room where I can have peace of mind.

4089
04:46:00,110 --> 04:46:02,430
My collection is too precious to risk any clum-

4090
04:46:02,430 --> 04:46:04,220
Okay.

4091
04:46:04,220 --> 04:46:05,020
Any clum-liness.

4092
04:46:05,740 --> 04:46:11,040
So, hit the banner.

4093
04:46:11,040 --> 04:46:12,240
It's all of it.

4094
04:46:12,240 --> 04:46:13,119
Go to the banner room.

4095
04:46:16,860 --> 04:46:21,069
Oh, someone coming.

4096
04:46:21,069 --> 04:46:22,270
You're not even halfway.

4097
04:46:23,200 --> 04:46:23,840
You're not ha-

4098
04:46:23,840 --> 04:46:24,479
What?

4099
04:46:24,479 --> 04:46:25,680
How am I not halfway?

4100
04:46:27,720 --> 04:46:29,319
You're halfway through or less?

4101
04:46:29,880 --> 04:46:31,799
This mission is the worst.

4102
04:46:32,990 --> 04:46:33,790
How do I skip it?

4103
04:46:37,020 --> 04:46:38,060
I don't think I can skip this.

4104
04:46:38,700 --> 04:46:46,700
Press Ctrl-Alt-Shift and put your entire fist in your mouth.

4105
04:46:47,340 --> 04:46:57,389
Okay.

4106
04:46:57,389 --> 04:46:57,790
I'm right-

4107
04:46:57,790 --> 04:46:58,990
Look, I'm in the guy's quarters.

4108
04:47:08,860 --> 04:47:09,580
What's going on?

4109
04:47:10,139 --> 04:47:11,099
How are you?

4110
04:47:11,099 --> 04:47:12,959
Nice to see you.

4111
04:47:12,959 --> 04:47:15,279
Somebody hear that?

4112
04:47:15,279 --> 04:47:32,599
Right there.

4113
04:47:32,599 --> 04:47:33,639
Oh, no.

4114
04:47:33,639 --> 04:47:34,360
Sorry.

4115
04:47:34,360 --> 04:47:41,200
Line aside him.

4116
04:47:41,200 --> 04:47:46,270
See you later.

4117
04:47:46,270 --> 04:47:57,639
Who's the next guy?

4118
04:47:57,639 --> 04:48:09,340
All right.

4119
04:48:09,340 --> 04:48:10,060
I'm up here now.

4120
04:48:10,060 --> 04:48:10,619
Private quarters.

4121
04:48:10,619 --> 04:48:17,659
Let's go.

4122
04:48:17,659 --> 04:48:17,979
All right.

4123
04:48:17,979 --> 04:48:19,099
What's this dude's name?

4124
04:48:19,099 --> 04:48:22,810
I don't know.

4125
04:48:50,439 --> 04:48:53,450
Hey!

4126
04:48:53,450 --> 04:48:54,169
Get-

4127
04:48:54,169 --> 04:48:56,750
Oh my god.

4128
04:49:06,439 --> 04:49:09,119
Stop splashing around.

4129
04:49:09,119 --> 04:49:09,919
Oh, you idiot.

4130
04:49:13,180 --> 04:49:16,599
What'd he say?

4131
04:49:16,599 --> 04:49:22,439
Where are you?

4132
04:49:22,439 --> 04:49:22,680
Okay.

4133
04:49:22,680 --> 04:49:23,400
Here he is.

4134
04:49:23,400 --> 04:49:37,450
All right.

4135
04:49:37,450 --> 04:49:38,250
Don't touch my things.

4136
04:49:38,250 --> 04:49:39,369
Don't touch my things, right?

4137
04:49:39,369 --> 04:49:40,569
Don't touch my things.

4138
04:49:40,569 --> 04:50:02,110
Where's the key?

4139
04:50:17,869 --> 04:50:22,270
Remember, did you plug in the smelloscope for this game?

4140
04:50:22,270 --> 04:50:24,509
You needed to clear some levels.

4141
04:50:24,509 --> 04:50:31,520
Oh.

4142
04:50:33,099 --> 04:50:35,580
You can't be serious.

4143
04:50:35,580 --> 04:50:37,659
Not when I'm this far into the game.

4144
04:50:37,659 --> 04:50:58,159
Who makes doors that open like this?

4145
04:50:58,159 --> 04:50:58,479
Why?

4146
04:50:59,439 --> 04:51:01,439
Open the whole fucking way.

4147
04:51:19,720 --> 04:51:21,000
How do I open this?

4148
04:51:21,000 --> 04:51:31,819
That's the safe right there.

4149
04:51:32,380 --> 04:51:34,380
I need a key to get in there or something.

4150
04:51:34,380 --> 04:51:36,060
Is it in his room?

4151
04:51:36,060 --> 04:51:37,790
With a key.

4152
04:51:37,790 --> 04:51:38,750
With a lockpick.

4153
04:51:38,750 --> 04:51:40,189
Key in the other house.

4154
04:51:40,189 --> 04:51:46,799
I mean, other house.

4155
04:51:46,799 --> 04:51:47,520
Note.

4156
04:51:47,520 --> 04:51:50,799
This is possibly the most complicated map in the game.

4157
04:51:50,799 --> 04:51:53,840
From conversations or scrolls, you can easily miss-

4158
04:51:53,840 --> 04:51:54,319
Hold on.

4159
04:51:54,319 --> 04:51:55,720
This is important.

4160
04:51:55,720 --> 04:51:56,439
You can easily miss.

4161
04:51:56,439 --> 04:51:57,639
You will gain the following knowledge.

4162
04:51:57,639 --> 04:52:01,080
Donald has Lord Randall's vase locked in his private safe in the West.

4163
04:52:02,409 --> 04:52:06,330
Ruben has stolen the key to Donald's safe.

4164
04:52:06,330 --> 04:52:10,599
He's also entrusted his house key to his right-hand man, Tom.

4165
04:52:10,599 --> 04:52:14,299
You must first find Tom, get the key to Ruben's house,

4166
04:52:14,299 --> 04:52:16,220
steal Donald's safe key from Ruben's quarters,

4167
04:52:16,220 --> 04:52:18,380
then retrieve the vase from Donald's safe, bro.

4168
04:52:18,380 --> 04:52:24,319
I'm in the wrong house?

4169
04:52:24,319 --> 04:52:26,479
Is there a console command to skip the game?

4170
04:52:38,000 --> 04:52:39,279
What's the console command?

4171
04:52:39,279 --> 04:52:41,869
Just play the game.

4172
04:52:41,869 --> 04:52:42,509
All right.

4173
04:52:42,509 --> 04:52:46,380
All right.

4174
04:52:46,380 --> 04:52:47,900
Well, I know where this guy's house is.

4175
04:52:47,900 --> 04:52:49,659
The other house on the other side of the game?

4176
04:52:50,220 --> 04:52:56,669
This is Suncoast Ballacy.

4177
04:52:57,310 --> 04:52:58,270
Are you having fun?

4178
04:52:58,750 --> 04:52:59,470
Yeah, kind of.

4179
04:53:04,139 --> 04:53:04,540
Okay.

4180
04:53:04,540 --> 04:53:06,540
Control-Alt-Shift-End.

4181
04:53:06,540 --> 04:53:07,900
That's not how that-

4182
04:53:07,900 --> 04:53:08,779
You made that up.

4183
04:53:09,340 --> 04:53:11,419
Control-Alt-Shift-End.

4184
04:53:12,380 --> 04:53:14,299
As you made that up as a funny joke.

4185
04:53:14,299 --> 04:53:15,900
Control-Shift-Alt-End?

4186
04:53:18,880 --> 04:53:19,680
I feel like it's gonna-

4187
04:53:19,680 --> 04:53:20,959
It's gonna do-

4188
04:53:20,959 --> 04:53:26,270
Control-Shift-Alt-End.

4189
04:53:26,270 --> 04:53:36,119
I feel like I could have accidentally pressed all those

4190
04:53:36,119 --> 04:53:37,159
at some point in the game.

4191
04:53:51,599 --> 04:53:52,159
I'm sorry.

4192
04:53:52,159 --> 04:53:53,279
I skipped it.

4193
04:53:53,279 --> 04:53:56,189
Everyone told me to skip it.

4194
04:53:56,189 --> 04:53:57,229
Look, this is an old game.

4195
04:53:57,229 --> 04:53:59,310
Sometimes old games have, like, hard, weird levels.

4196
04:54:03,900 --> 04:54:09,439
A lot of people in chat were saying

4197
04:54:09,439 --> 04:54:11,279
this next level is, like, the best level in the game.

4198
04:54:11,279 --> 04:54:12,000
I was content-

4199
04:54:12,000 --> 04:54:16,040
How many levels are in the game?

4200
04:54:16,040 --> 04:54:24,220
Who impressed me to steal something from a magical soul?

4201
04:54:24,220 --> 04:54:34,299
Little is known about Constantine except that he is an eccentric new face in the city,

4202
04:54:34,939 --> 04:54:36,459
and mostly keeps to himself.

4203
04:54:37,259 --> 04:54:38,619
This next level is a skipper.

4204
04:54:38,619 --> 04:54:42,139
Victorious says the sword will probably be-

4205
04:54:42,139 --> 04:54:42,619
We'll see.

4206
04:54:42,619 --> 04:54:43,659
It will be well-protected-

4207
04:54:43,659 --> 04:54:44,779
I now have that power.

4208
04:54:44,779 --> 04:54:46,299
Security systems.

4209
04:54:46,299 --> 04:54:48,299
She also mentioned that the guards are tough,

4210
04:54:48,380 --> 04:54:52,520
and our mansion is confusing to navigate in.

4211
04:54:53,159 --> 04:54:54,360
They're telling me it's confusing already.

4212
04:54:54,360 --> 04:54:55,479
This place was constructed recently,

4213
04:54:55,479 --> 04:54:59,580
so I've had to pull an observation and hearsay.

4214
04:55:00,400 --> 04:55:02,799
Sounds like the place is a bit of a maze.

4215
04:55:02,799 --> 04:55:05,770
I guess if you're rich enough, you can build any sort of madhouse.

4216
04:55:05,770 --> 04:55:06,490
It's a maze?

4217
04:55:07,290 --> 04:55:10,349
This is gonna be a challenging job,

4218
04:55:10,349 --> 04:55:12,880
but it'll pay the last few I've taken.

4219
04:55:12,880 --> 04:55:13,680
Skip.

4220
04:55:13,680 --> 04:55:15,759
Well, I know I can at least complete the game by skipping.

4221
04:55:15,759 --> 04:55:21,360
As usual, the front entrance managed to find another-

4222
04:55:21,360 --> 04:55:22,240
This game is fun, though.

4223
04:55:22,240 --> 04:55:22,639
This is cool.

4224
04:55:22,639 --> 04:55:25,439
Of course, once I've picked up the sword, I'll still have to worry about-

4225
04:55:25,439 --> 04:55:28,779
You guys have to remember, this game was made in, like, 1989.

4226
04:55:29,340 --> 04:55:30,299
Or something.

4227
04:55:30,299 --> 04:55:31,340
It was a long time ago.

4228
04:55:32,729 --> 04:55:33,229
Okay.

4229
04:55:33,610 --> 04:55:34,810
Find and obtain the sword.

4230
04:55:34,810 --> 04:55:36,569
It's probably on an upper level of the mansion.

4231
04:55:37,130 --> 04:55:38,970
Take the opportunity to steal other valuables.

4232
04:55:38,970 --> 04:55:40,169
Leave the mansion with the sword.

4233
04:55:40,729 --> 04:55:47,020
A lot of stuff.

4234
04:55:47,580 --> 04:55:49,959
I want more of these.

4235
04:55:50,520 --> 04:56:00,880
How much do these cost?

4236
04:56:04,330 --> 04:56:05,849
Uh, another mine?

4237
04:56:05,849 --> 04:56:06,810
No, the bombs-

4238
04:56:06,810 --> 04:56:07,450
They just don't do-

4239
04:56:07,450 --> 04:56:08,970
This caused a lot of problems.

4240
04:56:08,970 --> 04:56:09,770
The mines suck.

4241
04:56:10,590 --> 04:56:11,389
They're loud.

4242
04:56:11,389 --> 04:56:12,990
They don't go off right away.

4243
04:56:12,990 --> 04:56:13,630
They're terrible.

4244
04:56:17,389 --> 04:56:18,909
And flashes flash me, too.

4245
04:56:18,909 --> 04:56:19,709
They're awful.

4246
04:56:19,790 --> 04:56:21,389
You know, I'm just gonna get more fire arrows.

4247
04:56:21,389 --> 04:56:22,110
Just get another one.

4248
04:56:23,610 --> 04:56:25,049
These at least kill people.

4249
04:56:25,049 --> 04:56:31,479
But I probably should get a heal-

4250
04:56:31,479 --> 04:56:32,439
Okay, yeah, another potion.

4251
04:56:32,439 --> 04:56:33,080
I need a potion.

4252
04:56:37,389 --> 04:56:46,029
All right, let's go.

4253
04:56:46,029 --> 04:56:46,669
All right.

4254
04:56:46,669 --> 04:56:48,110
Get into the mansion.

4255
04:56:48,909 --> 04:56:49,869
Steal the sword.

4256
04:56:49,869 --> 04:56:50,349
You got it.

4257
04:57:01,450 --> 04:57:02,889
And there's a guarded entrance right-

4258
04:57:21,310 --> 04:57:22,569
This is perfect.

4259
04:57:22,569 --> 04:57:23,130
Come back here.

4260
04:57:24,220 --> 04:57:24,619
Perfect.

4261
04:57:25,259 --> 04:57:26,299
You can't see shit.

4262
04:57:26,299 --> 04:57:26,860
Come back here.

4263
04:57:27,819 --> 04:57:28,700
Don't come this close.

4264
04:57:28,700 --> 04:57:29,500
Thank you very much.

4265
04:57:29,500 --> 04:57:30,220
I'll take that.

4266
04:57:30,220 --> 04:57:30,700
Thank you.

4267
04:57:30,700 --> 04:57:32,459
I don't see anything now.

4268
04:57:32,459 --> 04:57:37,040
Wait till he turns around.

4269
04:57:38,119 --> 04:57:40,520
I say, where'd you come from?

4270
04:57:40,520 --> 04:57:42,279
And I'd like to know what happened there.

4271
04:57:58,319 --> 04:57:58,799
He saw-

4272
04:57:58,799 --> 04:57:59,840
Wait, he saw me run?

4273
04:57:59,840 --> 04:58:09,080
Are you scared?

4274
04:58:09,080 --> 04:58:14,650
Ooh, not very good swordsman, are you?

4275
04:58:25,340 --> 04:58:25,840
Aha.

4276
04:58:28,200 --> 04:58:31,389
Nice key you got there.

4277
04:58:35,419 --> 04:58:44,720
I love how, like, when something happens,

4278
04:58:46,080 --> 04:58:47,599
I like look to-

4279
04:58:47,599 --> 04:58:49,919
I like look over to you, right?

4280
04:58:49,919 --> 04:58:50,880
I like look to you.

4281
04:58:51,840 --> 04:58:53,279
Almost like I can't believe it,

4282
04:58:53,279 --> 04:58:55,680
so you must not be able to believe it either.

4283
04:58:55,680 --> 04:58:57,119
I'm looking at you like you're a person.

4284
04:58:58,000 --> 04:59:00,880
Like, can you believe what just happened?

4285
04:59:01,439 --> 04:59:04,110
I'm over here for reassurance

4286
04:59:04,750 --> 04:59:05,869
that, like, I'll turn

4287
04:59:05,869 --> 04:59:07,389
and I'll see, like, a bunch of-

4288
04:59:07,389 --> 04:59:09,709
Oh my god, dude, that was fucked up.

4289
04:59:09,709 --> 04:59:41,950
Come get me.

4290
04:59:42,509 --> 04:59:48,830
Try sneaking.

4291
04:59:48,830 --> 04:59:50,029
That's a good trick.

4292
04:59:50,029 --> 04:59:58,619
I got the key off of you.

4293
04:59:58,619 --> 04:59:58,939
All right.

4294
05:00:04,040 --> 05:00:05,880
I'm just going in the front door, man.

4295
05:00:05,880 --> 05:00:14,159
Whoa.

4296
05:00:14,159 --> 05:00:14,959
What was that?

4297
05:00:14,959 --> 05:00:20,650
Oops.

4298
05:00:29,069 --> 05:00:30,029
Oh, shut up.

4299
05:00:30,750 --> 05:00:36,409
I've already used so much health already.

4300
05:00:36,409 --> 05:00:48,540
It's bad news.

4301
05:00:48,540 --> 05:00:49,659
All right, I'm in.

4302
05:00:49,659 --> 05:00:52,409
I got in the front door, though.

4303
05:00:52,409 --> 05:00:57,740
Now we slow down.

4304
05:00:57,740 --> 05:00:59,419
Be careful with everything.

4305
05:00:59,419 --> 05:01:01,959
I steal a bunch of stuff.

4306
05:01:01,959 --> 05:01:03,419
All right, nice.

4307
05:01:03,419 --> 05:01:07,840
I'm gonna come in-

4308
05:01:07,840 --> 05:01:12,119
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

4309
05:01:12,119 --> 05:01:13,319
Right when I open the door, he's there.

4310
05:01:13,959 --> 05:01:20,000
You sidestepped me.

4311
05:01:20,720 --> 05:01:22,400
I got sidestepped.

4312
05:01:22,400 --> 05:01:34,270
He just led me to the treasure chest.

4313
05:01:34,270 --> 05:01:35,450
What a dope.

4314
05:01:35,450 --> 05:01:55,470
This is the main entrance here.

4315
05:01:55,470 --> 05:01:56,430
We're gonna wrap this way.

4316
05:01:56,430 --> 05:01:58,509
So the sword is up in the top floor.

4317
05:01:58,509 --> 05:02:05,610
The same room.

4318
05:02:05,610 --> 05:02:14,189
A big vase.

4319
05:02:14,189 --> 05:02:32,040
Stairs- I'm not done yet.

4320
05:02:32,439 --> 05:02:33,959
I think there's more stuff here than there is.

4321
05:02:33,959 --> 05:02:40,299
It's all just bottles.

4322
05:02:40,299 --> 05:02:40,939
That's it.

4323
05:02:40,939 --> 05:02:44,619
Oh, this is pretty.

4324
05:02:44,619 --> 05:02:48,490
That's really pretty.

4325
05:02:48,490 --> 05:02:58,919
Who's hearing me?

4326
05:03:10,400 --> 05:03:21,340
Get out of my way.

4327
05:03:21,340 --> 05:03:23,020
Why am I stuck on the chandelier still?

4328
05:03:23,020 --> 05:03:23,500
All right.

4329
05:03:23,500 --> 05:03:25,180
I'm just going the way that I was supposed to go.

4330
05:03:25,180 --> 05:03:26,139
And it's this way.

4331
05:03:26,139 --> 05:03:33,180
Take out the club.

4332
05:03:33,180 --> 05:03:33,659
Let's go.

4333
05:03:33,659 --> 05:03:41,720
What a weird-

4334
05:03:41,720 --> 05:03:43,880
I feel like I'm on the set of a Nickelodeon sitcom.

4335
05:03:43,880 --> 05:03:45,000
Like, what is this?

4336
05:03:45,000 --> 05:03:49,119
This is kind of creepy.

4337
05:03:49,119 --> 05:03:59,840
Info right here.

4338
05:03:59,840 --> 05:04:01,560
What does it say?

4339
05:04:01,560 --> 05:04:07,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4340
05:04:07,720 --> 05:04:13,240
That's weird.

4341
05:04:13,240 --> 05:04:14,799
That's weird.

4342
05:04:14,799 --> 05:04:16,400
That's a weird door to have in your house.

4343
05:04:16,400 --> 05:04:17,520
That's very strange.

4344
05:04:22,040 --> 05:04:22,520
Oh my god.

4345
05:04:22,520 --> 05:04:24,200
I thought it was speaking to me.

4346
05:04:24,200 --> 05:04:37,819
It's weird.

4347
05:04:37,819 --> 05:04:39,819
It's definitely a hidden thing in here, no doubt.

4348
05:04:39,819 --> 05:04:43,209
They have things that shoot out of their mouths.

4349
05:04:43,209 --> 05:04:51,000
Don't move.

4350
05:04:51,000 --> 05:04:51,799
This is tripped.

4351
05:04:51,799 --> 05:04:57,159
Yeah, this is trapped.

4352
05:04:57,159 --> 05:04:58,110
You know what?

4353
05:04:58,110 --> 05:04:58,669
I'm good.

4354
05:04:58,669 --> 05:05:03,849
Oh, hell yeah.

4355
05:05:03,849 --> 05:05:04,330
Definitely.

4356
05:05:04,330 --> 05:05:05,049
Where is it?

4357
05:05:05,049 --> 05:05:12,040
In like gold nugget up here.

4358
05:05:12,040 --> 05:05:14,509
That it?

4359
05:05:14,509 --> 05:05:17,819
Pretty good.

4360
05:05:17,819 --> 05:05:20,009
I think that's it.

4361
05:05:20,009 --> 05:05:34,799
It's gold rock.

4362
05:05:34,799 --> 05:05:36,159
Dr. Seuss house.

4363
05:05:36,159 --> 05:05:38,959
I don't like this place.

4364
05:05:38,959 --> 05:05:39,759
I heard a shot.

4365
05:05:40,720 --> 05:05:46,119
I was in a really good place.

4366
05:05:46,119 --> 05:05:53,049
I gotta stop yelling too.

4367
05:05:53,049 --> 05:05:55,799
I'm just like yelling for no reason.

4368
05:05:55,799 --> 05:05:57,720
I'm just making loud sounds.

4369
05:05:57,799 --> 05:05:58,840
Like, I heard a shot!

4370
05:05:58,840 --> 05:06:00,759
Like, you could just say that you heard a shot.

4371
05:06:00,759 --> 05:06:03,500
You don't have to yell it into the microphone.

4372
05:06:03,500 --> 05:06:04,220
They're all here.

4373
05:06:04,220 --> 05:06:04,779
They're watching.

4374
05:06:04,779 --> 05:06:05,659
They can see.

4375
05:06:05,659 --> 05:06:16,799
You said you were going to be a normal person and not be a weirdo anymore.

4376
05:06:16,799 --> 05:06:20,139
I mean, I think that went out the window.

4377
05:06:20,139 --> 05:06:21,849
I tried.

4378
05:06:21,849 --> 05:06:22,889
That was my New Year's resolution.

4379
05:06:22,889 --> 05:06:24,569
But all New Year's resolutions don't work.

4380
05:06:24,569 --> 05:06:26,169
I did it for like a day.

4381
05:06:26,970 --> 05:06:34,889
Is this a meltdown stream?

4382
05:06:35,529 --> 05:06:37,450
I don't think so.

4383
05:06:38,919 --> 05:06:39,400
No way.

4384
05:06:40,840 --> 05:06:45,759
I mean, I've been a little active, but I've been active.

4385
05:06:45,759 --> 05:06:46,959
I wouldn't say this is a meltdown.

4386
05:06:46,959 --> 05:06:47,680
It's not even close.

4387
05:06:48,159 --> 05:06:50,319
I'm just kind of having fun with the video game.

4388
05:06:50,880 --> 05:06:54,650
I already went down there.

4389
05:06:54,650 --> 05:06:58,700
It's going to shoot again, isn't it?

4390
05:07:05,020 --> 05:07:05,520
Oh!

4391
05:07:06,939 --> 05:07:13,520
Oh, that was fucked.

4392
05:07:13,520 --> 05:07:20,939
Oh, this wall.

4393
05:07:20,939 --> 05:07:25,740
That scared the shit out of me.

4394
05:07:25,740 --> 05:07:26,139
What do you think?

4395
05:07:26,139 --> 05:07:27,340
How do you think I feel?

4396
05:07:27,340 --> 05:07:28,700
It happened to me.

4397
05:07:28,700 --> 05:07:30,959
What do you think?

4398
05:07:30,959 --> 05:07:31,759
How do you think I feel?

4399
05:07:32,560 --> 05:07:33,759
It happened to me.

4400
05:07:33,759 --> 05:07:37,529
I'm the one that got hit by the car.

4401
05:07:39,119 --> 05:07:40,880
You watched me get hit by the car.

4402
05:07:40,880 --> 05:07:52,799
I had to get hit by the car.

4403
05:07:52,799 --> 05:07:54,720
Your scream was scarier than the thing.

4404
05:07:54,720 --> 05:07:58,560
Okay, don't.

4405
05:07:58,560 --> 05:07:59,520
I gotta be careful.

4406
05:07:59,520 --> 05:08:05,340
All right, don't get trolled by the stupid joke room.

4407
05:08:05,340 --> 05:08:06,139
All right, go ahead.

4408
05:08:06,139 --> 05:08:07,180
Three, two, one, shoot it.

4409
05:08:15,950 --> 05:08:17,709
What the hell am I doing?

4410
05:08:26,880 --> 05:08:27,599
Is it turn?

4411
05:08:27,599 --> 05:08:35,900
Oh, all right.

4412
05:08:35,900 --> 05:08:38,619
This Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fun house.

4413
05:08:38,619 --> 05:08:46,110
Wait, will he get hit by this?

4414
05:08:49,020 --> 05:08:50,220
This will shoot him, right?

4415
05:08:50,220 --> 05:09:10,319
Someone will.

4416
05:09:10,319 --> 05:09:12,330
Whoa, what's down here?

4417
05:09:12,330 --> 05:09:31,520
Okay, where's he going?

4418
05:09:31,520 --> 05:09:46,139
Oh, fuck.

4419
05:09:46,139 --> 05:09:47,099
Oh, fuck.

4420
05:10:06,000 --> 05:10:06,880
That was do or die right there.

4421
05:10:06,880 --> 05:10:07,439
I had to do that.

4422
05:10:07,439 --> 05:10:08,319
Oh, it was over.

4423
05:10:08,319 --> 05:10:28,270
Where is this guy?

4424
05:10:28,270 --> 05:10:28,909
Down here?

4425
05:10:28,909 --> 05:10:36,560
Oh, shit.

4426
05:10:36,560 --> 05:10:38,880
Oh, that hurts right in the head.

4427
05:10:38,880 --> 05:10:48,240
All right, we're good.

4428
05:10:48,240 --> 05:10:55,919
I want to go in that weird door on the ground.

4429
05:10:57,119 --> 05:10:58,319
What am I doing?

4430
05:10:58,319 --> 05:11:00,000
Is there a second floor, third floor?

4431
05:11:00,000 --> 05:11:01,279
What am I doing here?

4432
05:11:01,279 --> 05:11:06,669
Should I go in there?

4433
05:11:06,669 --> 05:11:13,389
You can cheese guards.

4434
05:11:57,119 --> 05:11:57,759
Shoot him.

4435
05:11:59,549 --> 05:12:10,080
You just sounded like Finn from Adventure Time.

4436
05:12:10,080 --> 05:12:19,259
This place, fuck this level.

4437
05:12:19,259 --> 05:12:20,779
This level sucks.

4438
05:12:20,779 --> 05:12:30,000
This is, it's just like a trap fun house.

4439
05:12:30,000 --> 05:12:30,560
What is this?

4440
05:12:30,560 --> 05:12:31,840
All right, I guess I'll walk over here

4441
05:12:31,840 --> 05:12:33,840
and get eaten alive by the monsters.

4442
05:12:33,840 --> 05:12:36,479
Get off of me.

4443
05:12:36,479 --> 05:12:57,340
This place is huge.

4444
05:12:57,340 --> 05:13:06,990
I gotta go up.

4445
05:13:06,990 --> 05:13:08,189
There's the bug room.

4446
05:13:08,189 --> 05:13:17,689
Okay, let's open this one with a pick lock.

4447
05:13:17,689 --> 05:13:24,189
Where are we at?

4448
05:13:24,189 --> 05:13:24,830
Gash.

4449
05:13:24,830 --> 05:13:26,779
Very nice.

4450
05:13:26,779 --> 05:13:37,229
All right, am I on the top floor?

4451
05:13:37,229 --> 05:13:38,110
No.

4452
05:13:38,110 --> 05:13:39,849
Where's the, there's another floor?

4453
05:13:39,849 --> 05:13:40,330
Where?

4454
05:13:40,330 --> 05:13:42,509
This looks like the top floor.

4455
05:13:42,509 --> 05:14:08,520
What happened to those people?

4456
05:14:08,520 --> 05:14:19,229
Okay, nice.

4457
05:14:19,229 --> 05:14:25,470
I gotta find a staircase up.

4458
05:14:25,470 --> 05:14:30,400
Secret in the fireplace.

4459
05:14:32,080 --> 05:14:32,560
I think there might be.

4460
05:14:32,560 --> 05:14:33,279
Look at that.

4461
05:14:33,279 --> 05:14:33,759
Right above.

4462
05:14:33,759 --> 05:14:41,549
Looks like a button.

4463
05:14:41,549 --> 05:14:42,349
Place, shit goes.

4464
05:14:42,349 --> 05:14:44,009
Okay, whatever.

4465
05:14:44,009 --> 05:14:54,330
Hello.

4466
05:14:54,330 --> 05:14:55,369
Oh, hell yeah.

4467
05:14:55,369 --> 05:15:13,419
All right, I gotta find a staircase.

4468
05:15:13,419 --> 05:15:15,259
This is the main entrance.

4469
05:15:15,259 --> 05:15:21,310
This goes down, I believe.

4470
05:15:21,310 --> 05:15:25,020
Yeah, so I gotta go up and in here.

4471
05:15:25,020 --> 05:15:26,139
I've been pretty much everywhere.

4472
05:15:26,139 --> 05:15:27,360
I've been everywhere.

4473
05:15:32,299 --> 05:15:33,500
I can go up from here.

4474
05:15:33,500 --> 05:15:37,560
Oh, you unlucky bastard.

4475
05:15:39,049 --> 05:15:40,409
I don't know how you turned around.

4476
05:15:40,409 --> 05:15:47,950
Give me that key right now.

4477
05:15:47,950 --> 05:15:49,560
Give me the key.

4478
05:15:55,450 --> 05:15:56,569
I gotta put him behind the,

4479
05:15:56,569 --> 05:15:57,369
at least put him behind.

4480
05:15:57,369 --> 05:15:58,330
Stealth game, by the way.

4481
05:15:58,330 --> 05:15:58,729
I know.

4482
05:15:58,729 --> 05:16:00,250
It's, I am stealthing.

4483
05:16:00,250 --> 05:16:03,310
I'm, I'm in a fun house right now.

4484
05:16:03,310 --> 05:16:04,540
It's hard to stealth me.

4485
05:16:04,540 --> 05:16:06,060
You don't even know what room you're coming out from

4486
05:16:06,060 --> 05:16:06,779
or going into.

4487
05:16:17,580 --> 05:16:19,770
Okay.

4488
05:16:19,770 --> 05:16:23,150
Oh, more stuff.

4489
05:16:24,029 --> 05:16:27,159
Is this the big dining room?

4490
05:16:27,159 --> 05:16:27,880
Yep.

4491
05:16:27,880 --> 05:16:33,450
Remember, this is violent.

4492
05:16:35,049 --> 05:16:36,090
You fell off.

4493
05:16:44,220 --> 05:16:46,139
How long, how long do you think I could have

4494
05:16:46,139 --> 05:16:48,220
like an underbite for before somebody like,

4495
05:16:48,220 --> 05:16:49,419
that's new to the channel really,

4496
05:16:49,419 --> 05:16:50,380
like is like, what, what's this?

4497
05:16:50,380 --> 05:16:50,860
What are you doing?

4498
05:16:51,500 --> 05:17:00,700
I gotta go over this way.

4499
05:17:04,520 --> 05:17:05,159
What the fuck?

4500
05:17:11,099 --> 05:17:12,220
I need more potions, I think.

4501
05:17:19,520 --> 05:17:20,479
That hurts to do that.

4502
05:17:23,529 --> 05:17:24,409
He had a key too.

4503
05:17:24,409 --> 05:17:24,970
All right.

4504
05:17:24,970 --> 05:17:26,009
I didn't, I haven't been out here.

4505
05:17:28,060 --> 05:17:29,180
Marlin Brando.

4506
05:17:41,740 --> 05:17:43,259
Whoa, weird stuff over there.

4507
05:17:43,259 --> 05:17:52,189
That's pretty cool garden.

4508
05:17:52,189 --> 05:17:56,669
That's not a bad garden.

4509
05:17:56,669 --> 05:17:57,470
That's cool.

4510
05:17:57,470 --> 05:18:10,200
Night.

4511
05:18:10,200 --> 05:18:27,840
Magical tree stump.

4512
05:18:27,840 --> 05:18:35,130
Wait, this is, this is underneath the,

4513
05:18:35,130 --> 05:18:36,090
where, what is this?

4514
05:18:36,090 --> 05:18:38,189
This is really weird.

4515
05:18:38,189 --> 05:18:41,389
Can I climb up here?

4516
05:18:41,389 --> 05:18:42,590
There's a door up here.

4517
05:18:42,590 --> 05:18:44,759
Wait, rope arrow.

4518
05:18:44,759 --> 05:18:52,409
What's the point of this being in the game?

4519
05:18:52,409 --> 05:19:00,729
It only works on wood.

4520
05:19:01,529 --> 05:19:05,130
I, what, wood, apparently it only works on wood.

4521
05:19:05,130 --> 05:19:14,270
We're going to like Jurassic Park now.

4522
05:19:14,270 --> 05:19:22,110
Okay.

4523
05:19:22,110 --> 05:19:23,790
Time to go visit the Keebler Elves.

4524
05:19:23,790 --> 05:19:25,479
This is so strange.

4525
05:19:25,479 --> 05:19:28,000
What is this all doing here?

4526
05:19:28,000 --> 05:19:44,080
Yeah, this is crazy.

4527
05:19:44,080 --> 05:19:45,360
Oh, there's your wood.

4528
05:19:45,360 --> 05:19:45,919
Yeah.

4529
05:19:45,919 --> 05:19:49,040
Can I go up?

4530
05:19:49,040 --> 05:19:52,840
You can't, I can't even shoot up.

4531
05:19:52,840 --> 05:19:53,639
I can't go up.

4532
05:19:53,639 --> 05:19:57,290
There's nothing to even do this for.

4533
05:19:57,290 --> 05:20:07,130
What is going on?

4534
05:20:07,130 --> 05:20:17,119
Wasn't I just in somebody's mansion?

4535
05:20:17,119 --> 05:20:29,419
Walls or trees?

4536
05:20:34,880 --> 05:20:44,700
Wait, I can go down here.

4537
05:20:44,700 --> 05:20:48,759
I was already here.

4538
05:20:48,759 --> 05:20:51,200
Uh, a swim?

4539
05:20:51,200 --> 05:20:58,860
I wonder if this takes me somewhere.

4540
05:20:58,860 --> 05:21:03,950
Please take the next left you see.

4541
05:21:03,950 --> 05:21:05,069
I'm not joking.

4542
05:21:05,069 --> 05:21:17,069
This is left.

4543
05:21:17,069 --> 05:21:24,220
All right, I took the left.

4544
05:21:24,220 --> 05:21:26,560
Garden?

4545
05:21:26,560 --> 05:21:30,279
Um, wait a minute.

4546
05:21:30,279 --> 05:21:31,639
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4547
05:21:31,639 --> 05:21:33,159
Wait a minute.

4548
05:21:33,159 --> 05:21:42,060
I haven't saved it in a long time.

4549
05:21:42,060 --> 05:21:45,000
You won't come in the water.

4550
05:21:45,000 --> 05:22:04,560
We're safe.

4551
05:22:04,560 --> 05:22:13,819
What's he doing?

4552
05:22:13,819 --> 05:22:14,459
Get in the water.

4553
05:22:14,459 --> 05:22:36,430
Get back in the water.

4554
05:22:36,430 --> 05:22:38,349
Did I make it through this garden?

4555
05:22:38,349 --> 05:22:39,630
Is this a new area that I haven't?

4556
05:22:39,630 --> 05:22:43,229
No, I've been here before.

4557
05:22:43,229 --> 05:22:45,310
Guys, I have no idea what's going on right now.

4558
05:22:45,310 --> 05:22:55,819
Back on the second floor.

4559
05:22:55,819 --> 05:23:04,639
Let's open this one.

4560
05:23:04,639 --> 05:23:06,000
You gotta follow the music.

4561
05:23:06,000 --> 05:23:12,009
Thanks for staying up late, by the way.

4562
05:23:12,009 --> 05:23:14,779
I know we're at about 930 Pacific,

4563
05:23:14,779 --> 05:23:16,939
which means we're past midnight Eastern,

4564
05:23:16,939 --> 05:23:17,740
so thanks for staying up.

4565
05:23:17,740 --> 05:23:21,389
This looks important.

4566
05:23:21,389 --> 05:23:26,880
Nothing in here, though.

4567
05:23:26,880 --> 05:23:38,860
It's gonna be a trap room.

4568
05:23:38,860 --> 05:23:44,360
Crouch.

4569
05:23:44,360 --> 05:23:51,849
E and I already read this one.

4570
05:23:51,849 --> 05:23:56,330
Pastor, the one who trespassed your greenhouse

4571
05:23:56,330 --> 05:23:57,770
is chastised.

4572
05:23:57,770 --> 05:23:58,889
He did not know the rules,

4573
05:23:58,889 --> 05:24:01,450
but spies there no longer.

4574
05:24:01,450 --> 05:24:06,159
Trespassed your greenhouse?

4575
05:24:06,159 --> 05:24:09,520
Is that where I just was?

4576
05:24:09,520 --> 05:24:17,020
I think I was just there.

4577
05:24:17,020 --> 05:24:35,290
I didn't go this way.

4578
05:24:35,290 --> 05:24:35,849
Really?

4579
05:24:35,849 --> 05:24:50,560
Can I not open this?

4580
05:24:50,560 --> 05:24:51,200
Really?

4581
05:24:51,279 --> 05:25:06,439
Nice try.

4582
05:25:06,439 --> 05:25:07,240
Good try.

4583
05:25:07,240 --> 05:25:09,150
I will commend you for the effort.

4584
05:25:09,150 --> 05:25:17,439
All right, third floor.

4585
05:25:17,439 --> 05:25:20,430
No, still the second floor.

4586
05:25:20,430 --> 05:25:30,270
PB&J or grilled cheese?

4587
05:25:31,770 --> 05:25:32,889
I would say grilled cheese.

4588
05:25:32,889 --> 05:25:35,630
I gotta be in the mood for a PB&J,

4589
05:25:35,630 --> 05:25:39,020
but a grilled cheese I could eat at any moment,

4590
05:25:39,020 --> 05:25:40,459
of any day, of any time.

4591
05:25:40,459 --> 05:25:42,060
It could be two o'clock in the morning.

4592
05:25:42,060 --> 05:25:43,099
It could be eight o'clock in the morning.

4593
05:25:43,099 --> 05:25:44,220
I could have just woken up.

4594
05:25:44,220 --> 05:25:46,779
I could have just, you know, gone to sleep.

4595
05:25:46,779 --> 05:25:58,650
I think I'm where I'm supposed to be.

4596
05:25:58,650 --> 05:26:06,779
No, don't pull this shit on me right now.

4597
05:26:06,779 --> 05:26:09,439
I'm already kind of getting tired,

4598
05:26:10,080 --> 05:26:11,759
and this is one of those

4599
05:26:11,759 --> 05:26:13,680
everything's upside down things.

4600
05:26:14,889 --> 05:26:15,770
Oh, yeah.

4601
05:26:15,770 --> 05:26:20,380
Um, I'm going up.

4602
05:26:20,380 --> 05:26:22,840
Going up.

4603
05:26:22,840 --> 05:26:26,400
You eat grilled cheese and you sleep.

4604
05:26:26,400 --> 05:26:29,740
I mean, I don't.

4605
05:26:29,740 --> 05:26:31,419
I'm just, I'm just saying it's good.

4606
05:26:31,419 --> 05:26:34,270
Whenever.

4607
05:26:34,270 --> 05:26:35,389
You can enjoy a grilled cheese

4608
05:26:35,389 --> 05:26:40,639
at any moment of the day.

4609
05:26:40,639 --> 05:26:42,080
And what, I'm looking for the sword.

4610
05:26:44,090 --> 05:26:45,450
How do you guys even,

4611
05:26:45,450 --> 05:26:46,490
I feel bad for you guys.

4612
05:26:46,490 --> 05:26:47,049
I really do.

4613
05:26:48,139 --> 05:26:48,779
Honest to God.

4614
05:26:50,569 --> 05:26:51,689
How do you navigate all this?

4615
05:26:52,250 --> 05:26:53,450
You must have a headache all day.

4616
05:27:03,369 --> 05:27:04,169
Oh, my God.

4617
05:27:11,130 --> 05:27:12,889
I don't, I do.

4618
05:27:12,889 --> 05:27:13,369
I'm done.

4619
05:27:15,159 --> 05:27:15,799
I think I'm done.

4620
05:27:16,860 --> 05:27:18,380
This is really, this game is really fun.

4621
05:27:18,380 --> 05:27:19,259
I'm done.

4622
05:27:19,259 --> 05:27:23,709
What's your favorite type of cheese?

4623
05:27:23,709 --> 05:27:25,470
Uh, I like Swiss cheddar,

4624
05:27:25,470 --> 05:27:28,680
provolone, um,

4625
05:27:28,680 --> 05:27:30,840
Super Mario tubes.

4626
05:27:30,840 --> 05:27:32,119
Uh, what else do I like?

4627
05:27:32,759 --> 05:27:33,639
I like, um,

4628
05:27:44,959 --> 05:27:47,119
just give me the sacred baseball bat.

4629
05:27:47,119 --> 05:27:48,319
Whatever the fuck it is.

4630
05:27:48,319 --> 05:27:49,200
Get out of my way.

4631
05:27:50,650 --> 05:27:51,610
Get out of my way.

4632
05:27:51,610 --> 05:27:52,810
Give me the sacred sword.

4633
05:27:52,810 --> 05:27:53,610
Whatever it is.

4634
05:27:53,610 --> 05:27:54,409
Where is it?

4635
05:27:54,409 --> 05:27:57,709
Parmesan is, yeah, I love Parmesan.

4636
05:27:57,709 --> 05:27:59,069
Shea Parmesan is fantastic.

4637
05:27:59,709 --> 05:28:06,830
Did you hear that?

4638
05:28:06,830 --> 05:28:08,490
I thought it was like giggling.

4639
05:28:08,490 --> 05:28:10,250
It was like a giggling like gnome person.

4640
05:28:42,189 --> 05:28:43,389
You've got a bow too.

4641
05:28:49,279 --> 05:28:51,360
You are in my way.

4642
05:28:51,360 --> 05:28:53,689
Oh, my God.

4643
05:28:53,689 --> 05:28:54,810
Sacred sword.

4644
05:28:54,810 --> 05:29:01,720
Get me out.

4645
05:29:01,720 --> 05:29:02,040
Get me out.

4646
05:29:02,040 --> 05:29:02,439
Get me out.

4647
05:29:02,439 --> 05:29:02,680
Get me out.

4648
05:29:02,680 --> 05:29:02,919
Get me out.

4649
05:29:02,919 --> 05:29:03,319
Get me out.

4650
05:29:03,319 --> 05:29:03,880
How do I get out?

4651
05:29:14,240 --> 05:29:14,639
Shit.

4652
05:29:27,880 --> 05:29:39,069
Step on it.

4653
05:29:39,069 --> 05:29:40,700
The mines are worthless.

4654
05:29:40,700 --> 05:29:42,860
This is the most worthless item in the whole game.

4655
05:29:42,860 --> 05:29:43,659
Worthless item.

4656
05:29:43,659 --> 05:29:44,220
What's the worth?

4657
05:29:44,220 --> 05:29:45,340
I can't even say worthless.

4658
05:29:45,340 --> 05:29:47,099
I can't even say worthless item.

4659
05:29:55,819 --> 05:29:56,459
I hear somebody,

4660
05:29:56,459 --> 05:29:57,580
it's like somebody's screaming.

4661
05:29:58,220 --> 05:30:06,139
Do you hear this?

4662
05:30:08,490 --> 05:30:09,930
Step on this.

4663
05:30:09,930 --> 05:30:15,790
Somebody's going like,

4664
05:30:15,790 --> 05:30:16,669
get out.

4665
05:30:16,669 --> 05:30:18,029
Get out.

4666
05:30:18,029 --> 05:30:40,119
Don't get me out of here.

4667
05:30:40,119 --> 05:30:40,840
Somebody's laughing.

4668
05:30:41,400 --> 05:30:41,880
You heard it.

4669
05:31:05,520 --> 05:31:06,000
What?

4670
05:31:06,000 --> 05:31:06,880
That was like the...

4671
05:31:06,880 --> 05:31:07,680
That was like fucking...

4672
05:31:07,680 --> 05:31:09,200
This is Mario shit.

4673
05:31:09,200 --> 05:31:10,430
This is the Mario...

4674
05:31:10,430 --> 05:31:12,349
This is like Mario 64.

4675
05:31:12,349 --> 05:31:26,490
I leave.

4676
05:31:26,490 --> 05:31:40,750
I can't open this from this side.

4677
05:31:40,750 --> 05:31:42,889
Of course, I can't.

4678
05:31:42,889 --> 05:31:43,770
Get out of my way.

4679
05:31:43,770 --> 05:31:52,560
Oh, this way.

4680
05:31:52,560 --> 05:31:53,040
This way.

4681
05:31:53,040 --> 05:31:56,360
What was that?

4682
05:31:56,360 --> 05:32:30,330
Get me out.

4683
05:32:30,330 --> 05:32:34,779
Oh, shut up.

4684
05:32:47,680 --> 05:32:50,560
The music is getting scarier and scarier.

4685
05:32:50,560 --> 05:32:56,619
I'm trapped in this goddamn house.

4686
05:32:56,619 --> 05:33:00,250
I'm trapped in this house.

4687
05:33:00,250 --> 05:33:01,130
I'm stuck here.

4688
05:33:01,130 --> 05:33:07,740
This way.

4689
05:33:07,740 --> 05:33:09,560
And then I could go right.

4690
05:33:09,560 --> 05:33:11,159
Yep.

4691
05:33:11,159 --> 05:33:12,040
And then...

4692
05:33:12,040 --> 05:33:14,380
Here's the...

4693
05:33:14,380 --> 05:33:14,619
That...

4694
05:33:14,619 --> 05:33:15,740
This is the entrance.

4695
05:33:15,740 --> 05:33:27,240
This is the lady was laughing

4696
05:33:27,240 --> 05:33:28,840
and making all kinds of weird sounds.

4697
05:33:28,840 --> 05:33:31,630
That was terrifying.

4698
05:33:31,630 --> 05:33:33,159
That was fun level though.

4699
05:33:33,159 --> 05:33:48,040
That was a good one.

4700
05:33:48,040 --> 05:33:48,840
It gets worse?

4701
05:34:01,529 --> 05:34:02,409
Gets much worse?

4702
05:34:08,729 --> 05:34:14,909
Oh, God.

4703
05:34:17,659 --> 05:34:18,299
Hello, Jerma.

4704
05:34:18,299 --> 05:34:19,180
This is SpongeBob.

4705
05:34:19,180 --> 05:34:20,220
Do you have any questions for me?

4706
05:34:24,220 --> 05:34:24,720
Yes.

4707
05:34:27,959 --> 05:34:30,200
PBJ or grilled cheese, SpongeBob?

4708
05:34:30,200 --> 05:34:30,700
Which one?

4709
05:34:43,020 --> 05:34:43,520
Animated.

4710
05:35:01,229 --> 05:35:02,509
You were being tested.

4711
05:35:02,509 --> 05:35:03,549
Do you understand?

4712
05:35:04,349 --> 05:35:07,229
And I must say you more than live up to your reputation.

4713
05:35:07,790 --> 05:35:08,029
Wait.

4714
05:35:08,029 --> 05:35:11,389
You are quite an extraordinary thief testing me.

4715
05:35:12,509 --> 05:35:13,630
What is it you want from me?

4716
05:35:13,630 --> 05:35:15,150
Do you have Satan hooves?

4717
05:35:15,150 --> 05:35:16,779
I am a Tim Mr. Garret.

4718
05:35:16,779 --> 05:35:21,799
But there are some items that are not available for purchase.

4719
05:35:21,799 --> 05:35:24,439
They must be acquired using other means.

4720
05:35:24,439 --> 05:35:28,439
In this case, the item in question would be best acquired by thieving.

4721
05:35:29,080 --> 05:35:30,759
Not simple thieving.

4722
05:35:30,759 --> 05:35:34,650
No, just like yourself.

4723
05:35:34,650 --> 05:35:37,529
What exactly is this item?

4724
05:35:37,529 --> 05:35:38,650
It is the gemstone.

4725
05:35:38,650 --> 05:35:40,889
He's got like goat hooves.

4726
05:35:40,889 --> 05:35:43,529
For its unusual appearance.

4727
05:35:43,529 --> 05:35:46,490
Yes, kept hidden in the sealed cathedral

4728
05:35:46,490 --> 05:35:49,450
deep inside the halls of the scum hammerites.

4729
05:35:50,009 --> 05:35:51,450
Oh, but forgive me.

4730
05:35:51,450 --> 05:35:55,209
You are possibly friendly with the order of the hammer.

4731
05:35:55,209 --> 05:35:58,729
No, fanatics make unreliable friends.

4732
05:35:58,729 --> 05:35:59,770
Excellent.

4733
05:35:59,770 --> 05:36:02,330
I am prepared to offer you quite a sum.

4734
05:36:02,330 --> 05:36:05,290
A hundred thousand upon receipt of the eye.

4735
05:36:06,009 --> 05:36:08,650
I don't see how I can refuse such an offer.

4736
05:36:08,650 --> 05:36:09,290
Marvelous.

4737
05:36:10,250 --> 05:36:12,490
Victoria can fill you in on all the particulars.

4738
05:36:12,490 --> 05:36:13,290
Is this the final mission?

4739
05:36:13,290 --> 05:36:16,409
And Mr. Garret, the sword, keep it.

4740
05:36:16,409 --> 05:36:17,529
You have earned it.

4741
05:36:17,529 --> 05:36:20,970
But also, I believe you'll find it useful in your quest.

4742
05:36:22,409 --> 05:36:23,209
No, okay.

4743
05:36:24,169 --> 05:36:28,990
There's a few more.

4744
05:36:29,630 --> 05:36:36,479
This is mission number six, right?

4745
05:36:44,919 --> 05:36:47,959
Come the time of peril did the grounded gape

4746
05:36:48,520 --> 05:36:52,119
and did the dead rest unquiet against us.

4747
05:36:53,229 --> 05:36:56,349
Our bands of iron and hammers of stone prevailed not.

4748
05:36:57,069 --> 05:36:59,740
And some did doubt the builder's plan.

4749
05:37:00,459 --> 05:37:04,569
But the seals held strong and the few did triumph.

4750
05:37:06,939 --> 05:37:09,259
And the doubters were in chat

4751
05:37:09,259 --> 05:37:10,779
thinking he wouldn't beat the last level.

4752
05:37:10,779 --> 05:37:11,340
But he did.

4753
05:37:12,060 --> 05:37:15,900
Laying into the minions' ride at Universal Studios.

4754
05:37:18,430 --> 05:37:19,229
Pretty lit.

4755
05:37:20,349 --> 05:37:20,909
I don't know.

4756
05:37:20,909 --> 05:37:21,470
I'm done.

4757
05:37:21,470 --> 05:37:22,509
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

4758
05:37:22,509 --> 05:37:23,310
Not tomorrow.

4759
05:37:23,310 --> 05:37:23,790
What's the day?

4760
05:37:23,790 --> 05:37:24,349
What's the day?

4761
05:37:26,090 --> 05:37:26,729
What's the day?

4762
05:37:34,970 --> 05:37:35,529
Saturday, okay.

4763
05:37:40,680 --> 05:37:41,000
All right.

4764
05:37:41,000 --> 05:37:42,599
I've got a question for people in chat here.

4765
05:37:51,080 --> 05:37:52,520
I plan on streaming again on Wednesday.

4766
05:37:55,389 --> 05:37:58,880
I was gonna do VR soon.

4767
05:37:59,680 --> 05:38:01,360
I think I want to do one more game stream.

4768
05:38:02,080 --> 05:38:03,529
I want to do Everhood.

4769
05:38:04,569 --> 05:38:05,869
But I also kind of want to finish this.

4770
05:38:11,790 --> 05:38:16,479
How much more time is in this game?

4771
05:38:17,040 --> 05:38:18,080
Another couple hours maybe?

4772
05:38:18,080 --> 05:38:18,639
Two, three hours?

4773
05:38:19,200 --> 05:38:24,240
This is fun.

4774
05:38:24,240 --> 05:38:25,180
It's a little old.

4775
05:38:25,180 --> 05:38:25,819
It's a little crunchy.

4776
05:38:25,819 --> 05:38:26,700
But I'm having a good time.

4777
05:38:27,259 --> 05:38:33,360
So what I'll probably do is on Wednesday.

4778
05:38:33,360 --> 05:38:35,290
It's probably two.

4779
05:38:37,020 --> 05:38:38,220
There's like eight missions.

4780
05:38:38,779 --> 05:38:43,549
Thief 2 is better.

4781
05:38:44,919 --> 05:38:45,959
Oh, there's a lot more.

4782
05:38:45,959 --> 05:38:46,200
Okay.

4783
05:38:46,759 --> 05:38:50,090
This might take more than another stream.

4784
05:38:50,090 --> 05:38:50,409
All right.

4785
05:38:52,380 --> 05:38:53,900
Well, I'm down to play it again.

4786
05:38:54,860 --> 05:38:58,380
I know you just...

4787
05:38:59,419 --> 05:39:00,700
You got sucked into a wormhole.

4788
05:39:01,759 --> 05:39:03,040
Oh, yeah, I'll play.

4789
05:39:03,840 --> 05:39:05,040
Yakuza again.

4790
05:39:05,040 --> 05:39:07,279
I'll play Sam and Max again.

4791
05:39:07,279 --> 05:39:08,000
Season three.

4792
05:39:08,000 --> 05:39:09,360
Oh, yeah, I'll play.

4793
05:39:10,080 --> 05:39:11,360
No umbrellas allowed.

4794
05:39:11,360 --> 05:39:12,959
Oh, yeah, I'll finish.

4795
05:39:13,680 --> 05:39:16,000
I'll finish Hollow Knight.

4796
05:39:16,000 --> 05:39:16,959
Oh, I'll...

4797
05:39:16,959 --> 05:39:17,360
I know.

4798
05:39:18,000 --> 05:39:19,680
I'll do Monster Rancher 2.

4799
05:39:19,680 --> 05:39:20,159
I know.

4800
05:39:20,159 --> 05:39:20,560
Trust me.

4801
05:39:20,560 --> 05:39:21,040
I know.

4802
05:39:21,040 --> 05:39:33,790
Or Hollow Knight.

4803
05:39:33,790 --> 05:39:36,970
But no, I actually will probably...

4804
05:39:36,970 --> 05:39:37,849
I'll probably do this again.

4805
05:39:37,849 --> 05:39:40,000
Wednesday, I want to do Everhood.

4806
05:39:40,000 --> 05:39:43,560
But at this time, I also kind of want to maybe do this too.

4807
05:39:43,560 --> 05:39:45,080
And or I'll just do this.

4808
05:39:45,080 --> 05:39:47,000
Maybe I won't do VR yet.

4809
05:39:47,000 --> 05:39:49,080
Maybe I'll finish this or play some more.

4810
05:39:49,080 --> 05:39:50,200
If not, then this is really fun.

4811
05:39:50,200 --> 05:39:53,439
It's cool to play for a while.

4812
05:39:53,439 --> 05:39:56,299
Wednesday, Everhood's the plan.

4813
05:39:56,299 --> 05:39:57,900
But, you know, we'll see.

4814
05:39:57,900 --> 05:40:01,369
What about all of this part two?

4815
05:40:01,369 --> 05:40:02,810
No, all this part one was enough.

4816
05:40:02,810 --> 05:40:05,479
Let me save it though.

4817
05:40:05,479 --> 05:40:07,680
Yeah, let me just...

4818
05:40:07,680 --> 05:40:08,880
Let me get prepared.

4819
05:40:08,880 --> 05:40:12,080
This is the...

4820
05:40:12,080 --> 05:40:12,959
Seems like a big mission.

4821
05:40:12,959 --> 05:40:13,279
Constant...

4822
05:40:13,279 --> 05:40:14,880
Oh, I actually get the new sword too.

4823
05:40:17,020 --> 05:40:17,819
I'll take one of these.

4824
05:40:18,540 --> 05:40:21,580
Two of these.

4825
05:40:22,139 --> 05:40:24,080
And I'll take a few...

4826
05:40:24,639 --> 05:40:26,479
I'll take a few of these.

4827
05:40:27,040 --> 05:40:31,529
I think that's all I can afford.

4828
05:40:37,319 --> 05:40:39,419
Okay.

4829
05:40:39,419 --> 05:40:40,619
Very interesting.

4830
05:40:40,619 --> 05:40:41,340
Save the game.

4831
05:40:41,340 --> 05:40:42,139
Hard save.

4832
05:40:42,139 --> 05:40:43,020
Right here in the beginning.

4833
05:40:43,020 --> 05:40:43,500
Right at the top.

4834
05:40:47,369 --> 05:40:48,250
I think I'm going to call it here.

4835
05:40:48,810 --> 05:40:51,240
That was really fun.

4836
05:40:51,979 --> 05:40:53,580
If we see this again, then we see it again.

4837
05:40:53,580 --> 05:40:56,479
If not, then that was thief gold.

4838
05:40:56,479 --> 05:40:58,880
I would give that a stamp of thumbs up.

4839
05:40:59,520 --> 05:41:01,479
I had a good time.

4840
05:41:02,119 --> 05:41:03,840
Hope you did too.

4841
05:41:04,400 --> 05:41:07,689
Are you going to put the ring light around your neck?

4842
05:41:07,689 --> 05:41:09,950
If it's safe, I would do it.

4843
05:41:09,950 --> 05:41:13,119
I don't know.

4844
05:41:13,119 --> 05:41:20,319
I'll see you guys on Wednesday, around 4 o'clock Pacific.

4845
05:41:20,319 --> 05:41:22,959
And I know that we're starting late a lot recently.

4846
05:41:24,459 --> 05:41:27,369
My sleep schedule is kind of all over the place.

4847
05:41:27,849 --> 05:41:31,450
Once I correct it, and I can pull back my sleep schedule a little bit,

4848
05:41:32,479 --> 05:41:42,299
we'll try to start more around that 2-2.30 Pacific area.

4849
05:41:42,299 --> 05:41:42,860
Oh yeah.

4850
05:41:42,860 --> 05:41:44,779
That was thief.

4851
05:41:44,779 --> 05:41:46,860
I will see you guys on Wednesday.

4852
05:41:46,860 --> 05:41:52,909
As always, thanks for watching.

4853
05:41:52,909 --> 05:41:54,270
Go to the credits.

4854
05:41:54,270 --> 05:42:05,310
Yeah, another reason why I want to start earlier is because I know that 4 o'clock Pacific,

4855
05:42:05,310 --> 05:42:09,290
if I stream for more than 5 or 6 hours,

4856
05:42:09,849 --> 05:42:11,849
it starts to get really late for people.

4857
05:42:11,849 --> 05:42:17,950
And I don't want to keep everybody up crazy late.

4858
05:42:19,080 --> 05:42:24,240
You know, 9, 10 o'clock Pacific is 12, 1 a.m. Eastern,

4859
05:42:24,240 --> 05:42:26,400
which is just an ungodly hour EU.

4860
05:42:30,459 --> 05:42:35,770
I'd like to try to stay in that, at least most of North America.

4861
05:42:35,770 --> 05:42:39,369
Doesn't have to stay up too late.

4862
05:42:39,369 --> 05:42:41,770
I'm sorry, EU friendos.

4863
05:42:41,770 --> 05:42:45,880
I live in the Pacific time zone, and I stream in the afternoon.

4864
05:42:45,880 --> 05:42:46,680
I'm very sorry.

4865
05:42:46,680 --> 05:42:48,779
It's the way it is though.

4866
05:42:48,779 --> 05:42:54,110
We have a 15-hour difference.

4867
05:42:55,310 --> 05:42:56,430
That's ridiculous to me.

4868
05:43:00,880 --> 05:43:05,919
Yeah, we'll at least be doing Everhood.

4869
05:43:05,919 --> 05:43:08,270
Keep an eye out if we do something else.

4870
05:43:08,270 --> 05:43:11,529
And then I'm probably going to get back into VR.

4871
05:43:11,529 --> 05:43:16,330
Hitman VR comes out on the 20th, the second that releases.

4872
05:43:16,330 --> 05:43:16,889
We're going to play it.

4873
05:43:16,889 --> 05:43:17,930
We're going to play it on the 20th.

4874
05:43:17,930 --> 05:43:18,650
Hopefully it works.

4875
05:43:18,650 --> 05:43:20,889
Hopefully there's not server problems or something.

4876
05:43:20,889 --> 05:43:22,119
The olives?

4877
05:43:22,119 --> 05:43:23,720
I already did the olives in the beginning of the stream.

4878
05:43:23,720 --> 05:43:28,759
I mean, I attempted it.

4879
05:43:28,759 --> 05:43:30,919
I can't say it went that well, but I did.

4880
05:43:30,919 --> 05:43:36,200
I tried.

4881
05:43:36,200 --> 05:43:47,340
What is the big stream?

4882
05:43:47,340 --> 05:43:51,770
The big stream will probably be, I don't have a hard day for you,

4883
05:43:51,770 --> 05:43:55,049
but it's supposed to be somewhere in the end of January

4884
05:43:55,049 --> 05:43:57,529
into maybe the first or second week of February.

4885
05:43:57,610 --> 05:44:01,049
I don't have a date yet, but I will give it to you.

4886
05:44:01,049 --> 05:44:03,610
There's a lot of factors as to what that date is.

4887
05:44:03,610 --> 05:44:06,509
Oh, I missed the olives.

4888
05:44:07,790 --> 05:44:11,840
All right, let's raid.

4889
05:44:13,599 --> 05:44:15,200
Connor Eats Pants is live.

4890
05:44:15,200 --> 05:44:18,250
Connor has raided the stream a bunch of times.

4891
05:44:18,250 --> 05:44:20,110
He's a really swell dude.

4892
05:44:20,110 --> 05:44:22,509
He's been a huge supporter of the channel, as you know.

4893
05:44:23,790 --> 05:44:26,349
And I'm ending, and Connor's live.

4894
05:44:26,349 --> 05:44:32,799
So let's go say hi to Connor, say hello.

4895
05:44:37,709 --> 05:44:47,279
He's playing Pokemon Brilliant Diamond or whatever this is.

4896
05:44:47,279 --> 05:44:50,299
If I die in the game, I die in real life.

4897
05:44:50,299 --> 05:44:50,799
Okay.

4898
05:44:54,590 --> 05:44:57,159
Say hi to Connor, everybody.

4899
05:44:57,159 --> 05:44:58,279
Say hello to Connor.

4900
05:44:59,000 --> 05:45:00,700
Connor!

4901
05:45:00,700 --> 05:45:04,810
No, go say hi.

4902
05:45:04,810 --> 05:45:08,139
I will see you guys on Wednesday.

4903
05:45:08,139 --> 05:45:08,779
Good night.

4904
05:45:08,779 --> 05:45:09,340
Goodbye.

4905
05:45:09,340 --> 05:45:10,430
Take care of yourself.

4906
05:45:10,430 --> 05:45:11,150
Sleep well.

4907
05:45:11,150 --> 05:45:12,650
Have a good one.

4908
05:45:56,560 --> 05:45:59,759
He's literally at the very end of Pokemon Brilliant Diamond.

4909
05:45:59,759 --> 05:46:01,520
He's literally at the last cutscene of the game.

4910
05:46:03,919 --> 05:46:05,759
Just be aware of that, by the way, guys.

05:46:06,319 --> 05:46:06,959
Be aware of that.

4912
05:46:06,959 --> 05:46:08,880
He's literally at the last cutscene, I think.

4913
05:46:08,880 --> 05:46:10,000
I have no idea.

4914
05:46:10,000 --> 05:46:10,639
That's what he just said.

4915
05:46:11,360 --> 05:46:13,229
All right, be careful.

4916
05:46:13,229 --> 05:46:14,430
I'll see you later.
