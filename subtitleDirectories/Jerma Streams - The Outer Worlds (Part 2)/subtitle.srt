1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:09,539
Hey. Yeah, sorry. Sorry I'm late. Uh, I wasn't supposed to be. I was sitting here.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:19,559
Just ready to go. We were pre-stream chatting. I was here. And then, I had to take out the dog.

3
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:28,629
That was true. I didn't even tell any lies. I just didn't tell you the truth. I was holding

4
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:34,310
back the truth from you. I wasn't lying to you. I just wasn't telling you what was going on.

5
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,780
Is that a lie? That's not lying. I just wasn't telling you the truth. I wasn't telling you

6
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:49,270
anything. Is withholding information a lie, or is that just withholding information? That's not a

7
00:00:49,270 --> 00:01:04,540
lie. That's just withholding info. It's called a lie of omission. Well anyways, uh, I had to update

8
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:12,219
my GeForce 1080. Apparently there's an update today, and oh boy, Halo Reach is going to be

9
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:18,629
running at over 100 fps. I can guarantee you that one. That was a pre-stream chat joke. I know I

10
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:23,510
told everybody in the pre-stream before that I don't do- that's exclusive material for pre-stream

11
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:37,799
chat, and I just used it. So, sorry. You have a million dollars. Get a 2080 Ti. Um, I don't have

12
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:45,620
a million dollars. You're off- your math is off by a little. I do not have a million dollars.

13
00:01:49,349 --> 00:02:00,260
He has five million. Nope. Nope. Look, when you spend all your money on carnivals,

14
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:16,710
Halloweens, and Minecraft servers, your CPA gets kind of annoyed with you. He's a trillionaire.

15
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:22,729
He's broke. I'm not- I'm not- okay, let me be very clear. I don't have a million dollars,

16
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:30,469
but I ain't broke, all right? But I got a very loud phone call, uh, back in October from my

17
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:36,229
financial advisor. It was a loud voicemail. I could not tell most of the things that they

18
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:39,830
were saying because it sounded like they were yelling very loud into an iPhone,

19
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,789
and you know what happens when you- when you scream into an iPhone? It- it gets distorted,

20
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:51,669
so it was like, I- I can't- so I have no idea what he- what he was saying. Something about-

21
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:57,020
I can't believe- why- why would you do that? I don't know, something like that. Anyways,

22
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:08,229
we're gonna continue the Outer Worlds. What the hell is a carnival stream? All jokes aside,

23
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:12,729
don't worry, I'm doing fine. I don't have a million dollars, though. I- I will do, like,

24
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:16,650
a celebratory stream if I ever have a million dollars in my fucking checking account.

25
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:27,020
Why would I do that? That would be fucked up. Imagine- imagine somebody doing a fucking stream

26
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:35,530
about, I did it, I made it to a million dollars. That's some next level fucking, like,

27
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:45,099
dystopian future type shit. I should just do that without having any of that money. That's

28
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,900
a funny stream. It's like a celebration of me crossing a million dollars, and I- and there's

29
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,139
not, like, not even five percent of that in my bank accounts across every account I own.

30
00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:00,740
All my retirement accounts, like, imagine, like, imagine that? It would be just, like, fake.

31
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,870
All right, you know, like that big- big controversy on Instagram where people were

32
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,789
taking pictures in their backyard and pretending they were going on vacation to Hawaii? That's

33
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:27,459
what that is. I did it! I made it to a million dollars! And then, like, turns out, I didn't,

34
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:31,779
like, sell my car and shit, like, I didn't have enough money. It's like, what a fucked up future.

35
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:50,120
What a fucked up stream. Hey, speaking of fucking weird futures, here's one right here. Why is my

36
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,620
iPhone not working? I- I- I- ah! This man- I got a million dollars, and I couldn't get an iPhone to

37
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:13,370
work? I'm just gonna pick up right where we left off. If you don't know, I'm currently playing the

38
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:24,470
laugh-out-loud hysterical guy. Dumb character. You've never seen that before. Not only am I

39
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:31,720
playing the game, like, three and a half weeks late, I'm also playing the thing that you may

40
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,040
have already watched. Somebody do ten times. But it's different because I'm a doctor, too.

41
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:44,899
And I might be doing other choices. And I got a million dollars. Anybody else that you watch got

42
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:58,360
a million dollars? Probably. Probably way more than that. All right, let's get out of here. Let's get

43
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:07,720
going. Actually, I gotta tweet this. I'm sorry I missed the context of that joke. Why is he talking

44
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:18,310
about having a million dollars? Uh, yeah, you had to be there. Okay. What should I write for a tweet?

45
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,389
How about just- and I'm just, like, gonna- I'm relaxing today. We're just gonna take it nice and

46
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:33,959
slow. More stupid doctor. I'm not even a doctor. Yeah, I am. More- how about more lying doctor?

47
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:44,740
You don't ever want your doctor to be a liar. That would be really bad. He comes in with, like,

48
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:56,300
your x-ray, and you've got- you've got, like, a- like, a tear in your lung. And he just tells you,

49
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:05,589
well, I got your x-ray of your lungs back. And, whew, you got stomach acid problem.

50
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:15,779
We're gonna get you on some antacids. You don't want that. Okay, more lying doctor. All right,

51
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:24,180
let's move. We can go now. Why would they do that? Because they're a liar. They're a lying doctor.

52
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,019
That's the character I am. That's the character I'm playing right now in this game is a lying-

53
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:38,600
an imbecile lying doctor. And the ToastFart just came in with five community subs. Thank you,

54
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,240
ToastFart. Appreciate that. Thanks, everybody who got those subs, because that means you're here

55
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:54,120
and you're watching. Thanks to you, too. That's a really fucked up looking pig, okay? All right,

56
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,319
I was just gonna say, if this game is gonna run like shit now after I updated my drivers,

57
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:21,670
I'm gonna be pretty mad. I think it's okay. It's all right. Fucking g-force. No, it's all right. I

58
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:29,240
think it's just initial loading of the game. All right, so let's take a look at what we- where we-

59
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,879
where we left off. So last thing I did was I angered a lot of people in the stream because I

60
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:40,039
gave power to Edgewater. And then the next thing I did is I have to convince all these people from

61
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:46,440
the settlement now to move back to Edgewater. And one of them said, I ain't going anywhere until you

62
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,360
find me my friend Zoe, whoever it was, and I found Zoe. And Zoe had a ring that I took

63
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,460
and brought back, and I completed that quest. None of that was a lie. That was just what happened.

64
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:08,519
That's the truth. So and then the other person that has to come along is this- this engineer

65
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:17,639
here. The three volumes. Tom said he knows that at least one volume is in the local community center

66
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:25,659
because this is another person that- well, I have to convince all these people to leave.

67
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:33,940
So let's do that. Engineering volume one, engineering vol- I can get all of them?

68
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:41,000
And no, this is not- I know you may have seen a playthrough of somebody that threw like a

69
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:54,220
grenade over there. That's not this one. This one, sometimes people die. That's it. That's it. Not-

70
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:03,269
we're not- not intentional. Let's go get volume one. Just fast travel. But isn't fast travel

71
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:15,450
boring? I'm- I don't like fast travel. Walking is boring, I guess.

72
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:26,460
Fast travel is more fun. We get more gerbamite content. All right, it's in the community center.

73
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:33,419
Let's get it. Turn my mic up? Yeah, what's- what's going on with my mic lately? Hold on.

74
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:49,029
Ever since- let me look at this. Hold on. You tell- you tell me if it gets to be too bad.

75
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,950
Bad?

76
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:09,960
That's good, right? How's that? That's better, right? But what- once I scream, it's gonna be bad.

77
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:16,470
All right, no, that's fine. That's good. That's fine. That's better. I think that's better. Yeah,

78
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:28,970
that's better. Are these bad guys? They are. He's blind. Did I just shoot a blind guy?

79
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:43,159
Uh oh. I just fucking missed three times. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

80
00:11:49,799 --> 00:12:02,809
Oh, this is bad. Fuck. Okay, this is a lot harder than I thought it was gonna be.

81
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:06,950
Did Jerm ever find a party member? Yes, and I told them to leave.

82
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:22,309
Okay, so that- this is much more difficult than- also, I'm also playing on hard. And then some

83
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:25,909
people are like, holy shit, this dude's on like the story mode difficulty and he's losing. No,

84
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:45,340
that's not- that's not what's happening. Let's sneak. Did they hit that scream? All right,

85
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:58,940
we're gonna make it happen. I feel like it's just- the- I don't- the way the guns work sometimes,

86
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:07,019
it just feels like I'm- if I've been playing too much Dusk- all right, I'm gonna drop this- you

87
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:21,580
know what? I've been playing too much Dusk. I'm dead. I have the slow-mo. All right, hold on.

88
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:33,019
The guns in this are mostly lame. Let me look at this shit. What should I even use in here?

89
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:49,960
Uh, do these guys just suck? What about the list I have? Am I not high enough level to kill these

90
00:13:49,960 --> 00:14:02,230
guys? What if I put too many points into, uh, lying to people? This thing is probably the best

91
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:08,620
thing I have. No, it's the shotgun and the pistol. This thing actually really is not that good.

92
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:44,899
Let me try this. This, you know, this streamer is whack. Oh, it's not as good. What the fuck

93
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:59,850
are you doing? Where are you going? What is happening right now? What? I gotta combine the-

94
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:22,809
Jesus. Fuck. Dude, does this gun have- does this gun hit people? How- it's a shotgun. What?

95
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:48,580
Does it need to be repaired? How broken is this thing? It's not that broken, is it? Bolter pistol.

96
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:56,379
We'll try this thing. All right, well, this is the first area of the whole game that has been,

97
00:15:56,379 --> 00:16:02,899
like, hard for me to even get through it. This thing's almost broken too. Small, lightweight

98
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:14,649
pistol. Just use the light machine gun and just fucking hold the button down. You know what? I

99
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:21,350
have been playing too much Dusk. We're gonna drop the fucking- this by, like, down to, like,

100
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:43,799
eight percent. I'll do nine percent. No, that's too much. Twelve. All right, that's a little better.

101
00:16:44,519 --> 00:17:02,470
Now, let me try this. Shotguns are kind of bad. Are they? So it's not just me? The shotgun just,

102
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:31,019
like, sucks in this game? All right, let me- let's- let's- let's do this tactically. Holy shit! What

103
00:17:31,019 --> 00:18:07,640
the fuck? Are these guys, like, level 20? Oh my god, it's precedent. Oh my god. Oh my- okay,

104
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:26,680
am I not supposed to be in here? Holy shit. I'm alone, I have no teammates, and they do

105
00:18:26,680 --> 00:19:03,849
so much damage. What the fuck is going on in this room? What? Give me my- give me this thing.

106
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:16,819
It's kind of hard to stealth because I don't know anywhere they're facing, and they- they're- they

107
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:26,940
can really- they can see you really easily. All right, there's a guy right here. Is there an

108
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:34,819
instant kill? My sneak- I don't have any sneak. I'm a fucking doctor. How do I instantly kill him

109
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:51,579
from behind? Give it to me. Where is it? Where is it? Where's the book? Oh my god! Give me, give me,

110
00:19:51,579 --> 00:20:12,730
give me! No, get it! Pick it up! What is this? Fuck this place. Missed the fish lore? I don't care.

111
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:28,230
All right, I got one. Should I get them all? Is this that one person that told me, Jeremy,

112
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:35,819
you're gonna hate this because the handguns are terrible? Don't use handguns. Should I have listened

113
00:20:35,819 --> 00:21:00,200
to the one guy? No, I haven't saved it! I haven't saved the game! Where do I go? Where do I go? Where

114
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:19,109
do I go? Okay, I'm at the other one. Save it. I need a workbench. I have to redo this- this guy's

115
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:43,819
loadout. What is that? Who's talking? Electric sucks? Why- why does electric suck? Why do- why

116
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:48,539
does anything suck? Where's my choice to do what I want to do? What do you mean, it- it sucks?

117
00:21:49,500 --> 00:22:01,779
Shock and sucks. Shooting sucks. Am I being lied to? How do I get in here, though? Can I break this?

118
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:11,670
Yeah, that's- that's very obviously electrified. I guess I can go in here. All right, where's my

119
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:42,809
electric? All right, scientist. I thought that was me that died. How is that possible? All right,

120
00:22:42,809 --> 00:23:01,980
so volume three is way, way easier to get than volume one. It's just right here. Well, not quite,

121
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:11,880
but it is still- it's right here. Turn the game volume up? Ah, actually, you're right.

122
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:29,640
It should be higher. That's better. What do I have for ammo? Am I good? 1900, it was this light ammo.

123
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:48,259
Just buy it. Heavy ammo? Just buy it. Energy cell? Just buy it. Sawed-off shotgun? No. Wait, what?

124
00:23:48,259 --> 00:24:07,849
Revolver? Should I get this thing? I don't have a revolver. I have a bolt pistol. How much is it?

125
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:17,000
And just get it. Whatever. All right, let me look at it. It's all right. All right, let's try it.

126
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:31,640
Revolver. Ooh, actually, this is- I like this thing. I'm not even- I actually really like this.

127
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:36,710
It's not the best choice, but it's a- it is a choice, so we're gonna use it.

128
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:49,900
Exo helmet? I have so much random shit that I need to go to, like, town after I do this. I've

129
00:24:49,900 --> 00:25:06,380
already read these. I think- I've already been down here. Yeah, I already did all this. This guy's

130
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:26,660
friendly. Good thing I cleared this whole thing. Just run down here and get it. Wait, where is it?

131
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:42,410
Further down? Okay. Oh, this guy's still down here. Does he care if I take his book? Model spaceship?

132
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:57,299
All right, I got two. Don't kill this guy. Why would I kill him? I don't have a reason to kill

133
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:09,380
this guy. Not yet, at least. All right, volume two is- should I just fast travel out of here? Can I?

134
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:30,099
He doesn't have any morals. Uh, yeah, I do, because I- I didn't kill that guy. If I had no morals,

135
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:39,529
I would just be like, hey, watch this chat! That means I have morals. That means I- I chose

136
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:55,059
not to shoot that guy. Therefore, I have morals. Is the other one just in here? Wait a minute.

137
00:26:55,059 --> 00:27:05,509
The other va- no. That's just called not being insane. Yeah, I also said don't smoke cigarettes.

138
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:12,150
You weren't here for that. That's pre-stream chat. I said don't vape and don't smoke cigarettes,

139
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,900
especially don't vape. Because vaping is just cigarettes you can smoke inside.

140
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:26,440
And you can just do it a hundred times more than you do cigarettes. And then I went off on a whole

141
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,759
thing about, uh, you can- all the advertisers are like, it's water vapor. It's clean, clear water.

142
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:38,980
Water vapor. But you'll be taking in 50 times more nicotine because you're gonna hit this

143
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:50,119
fucking thing all day. But it's vapor. Clean. Clear. Water. Vapor. Turn up the volume, dummy.

144
00:27:50,839 --> 00:28:07,000
I did. I increased it by like 5,000%. Our branch of vapor juice is the cleanest, clearest water.

145
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:30,309
I can only hear gun sounds. Well, what do I- that's called audio design, not me.

146
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:39,799
You mean like you can only hear this? Well, how do I fix that? Audio?

147
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:51,190
Effects. Music. There's only effects and voice. Turn effects down, turn the master up.

148
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:19,500
Okay. Now. Volume 2. Just play Chillstep. Not a bad idea. All right, let's go. Up.

149
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:33,930
Wait. No, I went the wrong way. Up. No, go back down. Can I get out of- uh, who let the toddler in

150
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:45,690
the elevator? He's just pressing buttons. There you go. Oh, come on. Which one of these is it in?

151
00:29:51,400 --> 00:30:18,779
All right, I got them all. Can you see me do this? Yeah, whatever. Fucking corporations. Okay,

152
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:43,299
let's go back in the elevator and get out of here. Anarchy. That's not anarchy. No mortals. Omega

153
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:52,940
low. Omega low-archy? Ornarchy? That's not even- there's no A there. That's not correct.

154
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:58,250
You cannot fast-drive well near hostiles. Who's a hostile?

155
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:05,690
Is somebody just hanging out one of these buildings? I don't see anybody.

156
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:27,430
Am I away from hostiles now? I am. Let's turn this in and then let's tell everybody to leave.

157
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:37,779
I did all your tasks. Now go back to Edgewater. We're gonna go take it over.

158
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,990
I got all three of them.

159
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,380
No kidding. Really? Well, which one?

160
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:59,109
Which one do I give them? Found it in the community center. The elusive part three.

161
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:02,710
Someone stashed it away inside the old geomotor. Should I give them the elusive part three?

162
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:11,640
The geothermal plant? Now that is just incredible. You really went exploring down there?

163
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:15,960
Adelaide always told us it was swarming with hostile mechanicals.

164
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:19,160
It was. Until I went down there.

165
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:34,859
Hey, it's your lucky day. Hold on. I got more for you. I got another one. Here, take part two.

166
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:57,640
Oh, almost forgot your payment. What was it? You gained 500 bits. Thanks for the five dollars.

167
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,329
Last one. Don't keep me in suspense. Look at that. So what do you get for all three? Building

168
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:10,809
a computing machine out of spectrum potatoes, a primer. I'm just glad it survived all these years.

169
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:18,730
That's a complete set. All three parts. I'm gonna be the greatest engineer Halcyon's ever seen.

170
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:23,210
4,000 experience. I've been saving something for you. Just a little contraption.

171
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:31,829
Should fit right into your outfit. What is it? What is it? Hurry up. Electrocharged surface.

172
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:39,700
I want to ask you something. Go back a couple months to Edgewater. This camp's my home.

173
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:46,569
People you see milling about? They're my family. At least I think of them that way. I owe them my

174
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:51,690
life. Would have died in the wilderness if they hadn't chanced upon me. Starving and delirious.

175
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,849
All right, so now I've done everything. All right, well cool. You can tell somebody else.

176
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:02,789
All right, I've done it. So now comes now the power. Return to Adelaide. Reed has been removed

177
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:15,099
from Edgewater. Return to Adelaide and tell her the news. So we're ready to kill Adelaide.

178
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:23,980
I know, but that's like anarchy. I don't think I'm gonna do that. Let's hold on. Let me see what

179
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:32,119
happens. The plan was to bring everybody back to Edgewater and then kill her. But then wouldn't I

180
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:41,510
just be everybody? I would be just enemy number one. Let's see. Look at that. The snakes come back.

181
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:48,019
Call me a snake again. Reed's dead. Come back to Edgewater.

182
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:55,300
You have a peculiar comfort with violence. Killing off my garden, gunning down Reed Thompson.

183
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:03,059
Suppose it's time our flock made our way back to Edgewater. We must tend to what remains of the

184
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:09,059
town and carry on with our lives as best we may. So who runs the town now? You're vexing to me,

185
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:16,340
you know. Injuring us with one hand, helping us with the other. Here, I'm giving you something

186
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:24,309
to leave us be. It's a ransom, you understand, not a reward. Ransom? You just gave me you a watch

187
00:35:24,309 --> 00:35:32,710
for ransom for you? You know, it's better off with you running the place. You're telling me you did

188
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:39,449
all this just to put me in charge of Edgewater? Stranger, you are some kind of twisted. You might

189
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:44,809
turn that old cannery into a garden. I'm gonna wait till she sits down in the throne and then

190
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:49,369
kill her. I need some time to gather my personals. Long walk back to Edgewater.

191
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:53,769
Got a considerable burden to carry. And then hopefully somebody else is ready. You're like,

192
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:59,860
oh wait, I could run the place. Yeah, I bet you could. Why don't you give it a try?

193
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:12,489
Sitting in the mayor chair is the trigger for me to shoot them. Take care now. I'll see you later.

194
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:28,010
There can be no ruler. Everyone who tries gets the boot. I just spilled coffee all over my

195
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:34,010
fucking whole body. Whatever. I'm not moving. All right, so we got, they're making their way

196
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:54,489
back to Edgewater. Now get the power regulator. Give it to me. What would happen? I don't even

197
00:36:54,489 --> 00:37:45,619
know. Regulator, return to the unreliable. I did it. Let's go. So that's it. All right, we're good.

198
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:52,300
She's still alive, right? Okay. I told you, I do what I do appreciate about this game.

199
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,780
You can say it might be a little more limited, whatever, right? But one really important thing

200
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:04,710
to remember about this game is most NPCs die in one hit. Remember when you used to play Fallout

201
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:14,329
and you'd fight an NPC and all of a sudden it would just be like a boss fight? People die pretty

202
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:30,969
quick. Okay, so now I got to go back to the landing site. Let's continue. Bastard. Bastard.

203
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:48,309
Look at him go. Bastard. All right, let's do it. Well, I certainly am looking forward to flying

204
00:38:48,309 --> 00:39:03,929
on a ship. Is this a hologram? This is a projection. He's not actually here. He's like,

205
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:15,530
spoiler for a very large movie franchise. Is that, that's not going to like come back and bite me

206
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:20,860
in the ass or later, right? Like in an hour, he's not going to instantly take all that stored up

207
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:30,550
damage and die, right? Like he's not gonna be mad at me or something. Okay. Well, we got,

208
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:37,110
we got backs. We're good. Captain, I have detected that Edgewater's power supply is now optimal.

209
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,269
I applaud your willingness to invest your time in the local community.

210
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,469
What can I do for you? I've got your power core. We can get out of here.

211
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:54,389
Do you know how to install a power regulator? No idea. Yes, I do. Outstanding, Captain. Your

212
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:59,590
aptitude for engineering will prove invaluable in the event of another catastrophic engine failure.

213
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:05,510
Our engine room is located behind you, across the cargo bay, up the ladders.

214
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:24,090
Dumb engineer, dumb doctor, dumb everything. Dumb liar. But you can't be all of these things

215
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:29,610
if you're stupid. It doesn't make any sense. If you pick the dumb trait, then you shouldn't be

216
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:44,230
able to be like a scientist or a doctor. It's a living oxymoron. All right. How did I pass

217
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:50,570
medical school if I can't even like read? That makes no sense. If I can't read, how did you pass

218
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:58,460
med school? What can I do for you, Captain? All right. So all systems are operating within

219
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:05,179
acceptable parameters to bring the unreliable into low altitude orbit. This should prove an

220
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:14,389
adequate test of our flight capabilities. Hold on. Do I need to clean something up here? Let's see.

221
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:21,159
Side quest. Retrieve the cache of medicine. Abernathy believes he's dying. Well, I already

222
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:32,789
didn't already kill him. I mean, I already, I'm pretty sure I already sentenced him to death.

223
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:42,889
Yeah, let's go. He's dead. I like told on him and shit and like the guard now knows everything about

224
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:50,440
it. Back to the community center. No, no, he's dead. Welcome back, Captain. Can't save her. All

225
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,800
systems are now operating within acceptable parameters. I know. Not like I've been trying

226
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:03,829
to save anybody. Can't save everybody. Just accidentally killed like four people and destroyed

227
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:33,929
a whole town. Whatever. Can't save everybody. Request from Dr. Phineas Wells. Pogchamp's in

228
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:41,849
chat over that. It's just like a ship taking off. I love that so much.

229
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:54,900
Hail and hearty and captain of your own ship. I see you're putting the unreliable to good use.

230
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,480
Shame about her former captain. Horrible way to die. How are you feeling by the way?

231
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,840
Do you look like that guy that's in the basement of the geothermal plant? Any unnatural drippage?

232
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:12,650
Perfectly normal side effect of thawing. I assure you. All right. I'll get to the point. What you

233
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:18,489
saw in Emerald Vale is happening all across the colony. Food shortages, lack of supplies,

234
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:24,570
and basic necessities. We're dying. The chairman, the minister, and all their lackeys on the board

235
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:30,570
are to blame. The hope has some of the brightest minds earth ever sent us. If we can revive the

236
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:36,489
hope's colonists, they can help us undo the board's mistakes. They can help us set things right.

237
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:42,010
You need to get to Stellar Bay on Monarch. I have contacts there. They'll help me,

238
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:48,250
help us find the chemicals to revive your fellow colonists. I really give you this quiet. You're

239
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,809
doing that face too. That's what you're doing. Cozy little black marketing outfit on the ground

240
00:43:52,809 --> 00:43:57,849
breaker. She can get you a nav key to land on Stellar Bay. Okay. You cannot travel to Phineas's

241
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:04,489
lab. Okay. I'll go have a word with Gladys. Why do I need a nav key to land on a planet? Slow down.

242
00:44:04,489 --> 00:44:08,969
You're asking me to get involved with the black market. Or I could put a couple light years between

243
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:22,090
me and... I could just leave. I'll go have a word. Excellent. I'll send her a wireless. Let her know

244
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:29,940
you're coming. By the way, I gave Captain Hawthorne a disguise apparatus of my own design. Cutting edge

245
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:36,980
technology years ahead of its time. I call it the holographic shroud. I'm sure it will prove

246
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:42,420
remarkably useful to you. You'll find it in the captain's quarters. Wait, I can put on a disguise?

247
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:48,949
You want me to wear a cape? Wrong matter of shroud, my slow-witted accomplice. This is,

248
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:57,110
how to put it, simply a device that makes you look different, sound different, briefly. The device has

249
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:02,389
its limits, but it will allow you to blend in perfectly and probably won't jeopardize your

250
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:10,230
ability to have children. Will it? No, definitely not. Probably. Yes. Very simply, the holographic

251
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:15,829
shroud uses biometric information contained on standard identity cartridges to generate a

252
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:23,030
holographic projection around you. Okay. What are the limitations? It only stands up to a

253
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:28,630
casual scrutiny. Use it too long, bound to flicker, blur, something like that. Movement

254
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:35,030
makes it more likely. Movement? Best used in moderation. When you see guards in your path,

255
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:40,469
you can sneak past your target. Oh, this is going to be horrible. Maintain your distance. Act normal.

256
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:45,349
No running, no jumping. No running, no jumping? Don't draw their attention. If they pay attention,

257
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:49,030
they're more likely to notice flaws in the hologram. What do you mean, I can't run?

258
00:45:49,030 --> 00:46:00,260
Change of clothes. What is this? Some old spy serial? What inattentive and brainless

259
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:08,179
guard would be fooled by such a shabby disguise? The holographic shroud masks not only your clothes,

260
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:12,739
but your face and fingerprints. It modulates your voice and sweetens your breath.

261
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:19,780
Okay, I'll put it to good use. Excellent. I'll contact you once you've found a way to get to

262
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:27,380
Stellar Bay. If you have any questions, come see me in my lab. And remember, don't trust the board.

263
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,980
They'll try to win you over with promises of wealth and power, but it's a lie. Is it? I know

264
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,179
that very well. The board is only interested in filling their own pockets. If we don't put a stop

265
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:41,059
to them, they're going to run this colony to the ground. Liars versus liars. Transmission ended.

266
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:45,780
If you are ready to depart, please select a destination on your navigation terminal.

267
00:46:46,340 --> 00:47:04,940
Got it. Okay, so can I just open the hatch and just fly out? I don't know why I even asked that question.

268
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:12,090
All right, holographic shroud. There it is. Projects a disguise on you and your companions

269
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:16,809
that gives you access to restricted areas provided you have the correct ID cartridge for that area.

270
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:21,449
Restricted areas are off limits to unauthorized personnel and otherwise result in being attacked

271
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:35,780
on sight. Well, that sucks. Reeds. Did I bring Reed's skull? Did I take this guy's head?

272
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:52,920
What the hell? That's a little fucked up. All right, what do I got? A bin. Let me see. I need

273
00:47:52,920 --> 00:48:19,289
a workbench. Where's the nearest workbench? Shh! Who's this? Sam. Okay. Workbench. Am I stealing?

274
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:35,480
This is not like somebody else's room, right? A stern older man with warm eyes.

275
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:53,340
There he is. Tarot cards? Tarot cards. Okay. Don't want to see the Ten of Swords.

276
00:48:53,900 --> 00:49:11,030
Especially when it's the right way up. That's real. But that's real. You guys can mine us

277
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:14,550
to all you want. That's actually real if you see the Ten of Swords in a reading.

278
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:29,500
What? None of you guys understand tarot readings? I bet you there are 20, almost 2600 people here.

279
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:34,940
I bet you maybe one or two of you have ever had a reading. I've never had a reading before.

280
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:41,590
Has anybody in here actually done it? Maybe four of you? So that, that like reference was for four

281
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:54,949
of you. What? You guys don't like sit on the toilet and like read about tarot cards? It's what? Just

282
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:57,750
because you're just like, oh, I wonder what that's all about. And you just read about it?

283
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:13,079
I do that, but not, no, I must, I must be a fucking hundred years old. You guys don't read

284
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:30,340
shit on the toilet? What? Oh, you go on Twitter. Oh, right. You scroll through Twitter. Oh, I forgot.

285
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:48,630
I forgot about social media. God. You guys should be reading about tarot cards and like,

286
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:54,659
how much water pressure happens when you go a mile underwater? You don't read that?

287
00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:09,219
I don't understand why. All right, let's go to, this is where I am, uh, terror two. I can go

288
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:14,409
a lot of different places, can't I? This is a whole solar system. This is awesome. Welcome to

289
00:51:14,409 --> 00:51:18,010
the system map here. You can see all the planets in the system as well as some special points of

290
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:22,380
interest. You can fly your ship to any location you've unlocked. There's some landing bays require

291
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:28,090
special codes and keys before they allow you to land. Moving between planets is considered

292
00:51:28,409 --> 00:51:36,250
dangerous. Okay. All right. Passage to anywhere. Uh, speak to Gladys on the ground breaker.

293
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:57,500
Ground breaker. Let's go. We've arrived at the ground breaker. So I have it a bit beamed onto

294
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:14,170
their ship. First of all, let me do this. All right, we need to do done. Okay. So now I am

295
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:25,980
impossible to, I'm, I'm a dialogue master. Get some new clothes. I will hold on. I'm a 50 liar

296
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:36,539
perks. What do I got? Journal. Ooh. All right. Uh, you have a sawed off shotgun and a scope.

297
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:43,320
That doesn't look right in your hands. It seems weird. Uh, I'm going to give you this.

298
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:51,699
That's probably better use for you. Hey, don't aim that at me. What the fuck?

299
00:52:52,579 --> 00:53:02,280
You stupid. All right. Uh, let's go back. Captain, could I have a moment of your time?

300
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:10,170
You sure could by Verity, by strength. What are we contemplating today? All right. We have to go

301
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:14,659
back and forth here with Max. I'd like to know something about those I'm flying with. What's

302
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:20,489
your story? I'm the, you're the only one on the ship. Any ideas where we can find someone who

303
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:25,210
speaks French in this colony? I've been thinking on that. There's a form. That's what we care about.

304
00:53:25,929 --> 00:53:31,530
Infamous philosopher scholar who fled terror to some years ago. He's an expert on Bacono.

305
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:37,369
He's also who told me of the journal's presence in Emerald Vale. If anyone in this colony could

306
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:45,369
translate that book, it would be him. Seriously? The one guy in this whole colony? The only one

307
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:52,090
I'm aware of. I suppose we could always just ask for random passersby if they are. Talk to computer.

308
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:59,179
Get Sam. Talk to computer. No, I want this guy. Your sarcasm is duly noted and it will be reflected

309
00:53:59,179 --> 00:54:05,019
on your review. A thousand pardons, my good captain. I thought we were engaging in witty repartee.

310
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:13,900
Now, we want Sam and Max. We should start on the ground breaker. Yeah, they're in the game.

311
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:19,659
They're the only two people that are going to be on my ship. Are you going to have two at once?

312
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:24,539
All I need is access to a data cartridge from the security. Hold on. I can have Sam and Max.

313
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,579
What? Let's do it.

314
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:36,630
All right, how will the crew manifest to help us to track down your scholar friend?

315
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,989
I'll comb the last six months of departure manifest to track the

316
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:50,090
Philosophist's off-world destination. Okay. Thank you, captain. All right, let's get Sam.

317
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,380
I would like you. You know anything about the auto-mechanical gathering dust in the

318
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:05,260
janitor closet? The intent is a cleaning, Sam. Hawthorne brought it on board some cycles ago.

319
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:09,099
I'm sure with the intent to modify it, but I've never seen it up and running.

320
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:13,980
Alex likely recorded progress notes detailing his efforts to modify Sam.

321
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:18,940
If you check the terminal in your captain's quarters, we may be able to determine what

322
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:23,099
work remains in order for Sam to properly operate. Another quest to get Sam and Max.

323
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:27,739
Uh, okay. I'm in the mood for some entertainment.

324
00:55:27,739 --> 00:55:30,300
Certainly, captain. What would you like to hear?

325
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:39,019
Tell me a joke. I used to hate math, but then I realized decimals have a point.

326
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:46,760
Now playing a Spacer's Choice advertisement jingle.

327
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:56,119
It's not the best choice. That's not my favorite song. Everyone in Halcyon

328
00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:01,320
is contractually obligated to label this or another board-certified jingle their favorite song.

329
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:05,320
Let me let me fucking fix. Let me fix that up for you.

330
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,360
Now playing a Spacer's Choice advertisement jingle.

331
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:21,690
Oh, beatbox. You beatbox. Oh, beatbox. You beatbox. My pleasure, captain. As you wish,

332
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:30,409
captain. I must comply with all direct orders. All right, let's go. I'll be here.

333
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:39,670
All right, now let me look. Uh, the empty man.

334
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:46,059
The cleaning machine. All right, search Hawthorne's terminal. Let's figure it out.

335
00:56:50,840 --> 00:57:00,760
This is my favorite room. It's so spacious. Cool. All right. Good to know. All right, let's repair.

336
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:14,730
What is this? A revolver? Yeah, this is a shock pistol. Yeah, I still don't need it. How's this

337
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:25,980
doing? It's fine. How's this doing? It's all right. This needs to be repaired. Yeah. Okay.

338
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:32,710
Why does it have a diamond on it? Hunting rifle. What's that? What's that diamond mean?

339
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:43,139
Tinker. Let's see. I want to make this a little better. Revolver damage. Is it stupid for me to?

340
00:57:43,940 --> 00:58:04,599
I mean, it's only $50. That's not that. It's 102 bucks. 110. Do it again.

341
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:13,130
I want to make this useful one more time. Okay. That's it. That's it. That's not again. Now we're

342
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:22,539
getting, we're getting to $600. 128 DPS for the pistol is pretty damn good. All right. Tinker

343
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:35,579
with the hunting rifle. 58 DPS. 100. No, what else can I do? My light machine gun.

344
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,800
Always just do at least the first or second tier of these because why not?

345
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:49,000
This thing's going to be useful now. All right, now let's break this shit down.

346
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:56,539
Uh, keep the shovel. Get rid of the, this guy's staff. All right. What is it? No, not Tinker.

347
00:58:56,539 --> 00:59:05,260
We modified. No, we need to break down. Okay. Break this down. Uh, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

348
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:12,630
This is okay. That's not equipped, right? I just destroyed something that was a diamond on it.

349
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:23,349
Oops. Who cares? Uh, this is too one-handed. Um, this thing is just worse. This is both one-handed.

350
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:32,389
No, it's not. Uh, fuck it. Who cares? Oh shit. All right. I need to modify, modify, modify. What

351
00:59:32,389 --> 00:59:39,030
can we do with this? With the revolver? No modifications I have for the, um, for the revolver.

352
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:52,650
No scopes. No nothing. How? Light machine gun. Nothing. The pistol. Nothing. What about armor?

353
00:59:53,210 --> 01:00:06,070
There we go. Electro charge surface. Thug kit. All right. Let me look at what I even have for it.

354
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:13,019
I have a lot of ram shit here. This thing is tech skills. It's five armor. What else do I have?

355
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:30,550
Lab outfit. I kind of like it. I do kind of like it. Patched low pressure helmet. Mining gear is

356
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:44,019
stealth. No. Holy shit. 17 armor. It's heavy armor though. It weighs a lot. No, it doesn't. Spacer's

357
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:51,099
choice outfit. Melee weapon skills. Sneak. One-handed melee plus five. That's actually

358
01:00:51,099 --> 01:01:00,280
pretty good, but I'm going to keep this on. I like this weird doctor look. Yeah, that looks

359
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:13,940
all right. Wear the hat. Oh yeah. Dialogue skill plus seven. That's true. All right. What do you,

360
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:26,519
what do you got on for armor? This. Give me this. I'm putting that on. Your clothes. Give them to me.

361
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:41,320
All right. Now you can put on the doctor outfit. Let's just trade. All right. We're going to trade.

362
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:52,409
You're going to be me and I'm going to be you. You get to be the doctor. I get to be the priest.

363
01:01:52,409 --> 01:02:01,610
Do we have two hats? I think that's fine. This is where I have to actually pay attention. So

364
01:02:02,329 --> 01:02:09,590
this is the heal. Heals 25% health over two seconds. Plus 200% natural health regeneration

365
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:20,889
for two minutes. So I can combine these. That's pretty cool. Let's do, what do I have a lot of?

366
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:27,820
That's like headshot damage. Can I just do two of these? Can I do like a double dose?

367
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:48,380
Well, let's do the, let's do this for now. Do matching hats. Fine. You have perks though. All

368
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:58,500
right. Base health threat generated. Increase your hack skill. I don't want to generate that much

369
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:13,900
threat. Maybe the hack skill, but I'm not going to really use it. I mean, it is, it is just a free

370
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:34,019
hack skill. That's true for health or it's either health or hack. Cause I don't want you to generate

371
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:40,409
threat. You'll just die instantly, but I don't want you to not generate threat. Cause I don't

372
01:03:40,409 --> 01:03:49,800
want to take all the hits, but we're going to get Sam. It's a free hack skill. I'm taking it

373
01:03:52,900 --> 01:04:01,420
plus 20% dialogue, combat effective, melee damage, armor rating, range damage, free hack skill.

374
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:10,969
All right. Looking good. I've got my stuff sorted. Let me just go to my weapons, make sure this is

375
01:04:10,969 --> 01:04:16,179
all correct. Where's my revolver? There it is. This is the one that I'm going to use. I've upgraded

376
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:24,170
this a lot. This thing's all right. This thing's okay. They're all all right. All right. Looking

377
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:35,780
good. Got my, can I up, can you tinker your armor? Can I upgrade the armor? Shit, I can. Okay. So

378
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:51,579
I'm going to upgrade his robes. All right. And upgrade the hat too. One more time. Why,

379
01:04:51,579 --> 01:05:04,969
why did that not go up? All right. I'm going to break down the, one of these, probably the

380
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:11,219
shock one. No, this one. Do I even want the assault rifle? No, fuck it. I don't want it.

381
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:19,610
What about this junk mining gear? I feel like I could use this, but I don't want to be weighed

382
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:30,260
down. Tech skills. No, this is worker's outfit, melee weapon skills. I mean, I don't care.

383
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:39,429
Oh, sneak plus five. I'm never going to be sneaking around. One-handed melee, maybe mining gear. I'm

384
01:05:39,429 --> 01:05:46,340
not going to be sneaking around. This thing is a diamond, so I'm not going to get rid of it.

385
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:51,849
Stealth skills, get rid of the damn thing. Tech skills, maybe, but not really. Get rid of the

386
01:05:51,849 --> 01:06:04,630
damn thing. I'm being weighed down by, all right, that's fine. All right. I'm ready. Let's do this.

387
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:22,119
What was I doing? I forget. I was going to go over here. Yeah. To do, to activate Sam. Search term

388
01:06:22,119 --> 01:06:28,039
Sam. First Sam result. Do not forget you found a discarded sanitation and maintenance auto-mechanical

389
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:32,519
in Emerald Vale scrap heap during your last job. It should not be too difficult to get it up and

390
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:37,400
running with a few key modifications. I can envision a combat capable variant. Some might

391
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:44,599
say a clean, mean killing machine should be fun. Removal of factory standard part. Suds steeper

392
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:48,519
with successful delivery of combat modified replacement part. Acid steeper has been deployed.

393
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:53,239
Progress setback is estimated to be a solid three months. Not like I have more pressing

394
01:06:53,239 --> 01:07:00,380
matters to attend to, but I do. I'm giving up hope on the delivery. The part is lost in transit. It's

395
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:05,659
not turning up anytime soon, but good news. I heard from a fellow who knows a gal who knows

396
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:10,219
the broker who overcharged me for the information regarding the location of an acid steeper. I can

397
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:17,579
filch. The part was sent to an old storage facility in Rose Way. The rest of the stuff

398
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:21,500
you could have just went like this and hit delete because that's all I need to know.

399
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:34,949
It's abandoned. Good. Cleaning machine. Let's get it. Find the acid steeper. Let's do that.

400
01:07:35,429 --> 01:07:42,139
I'm into that right now. I want two companions. That just freaked me out. I forgot you're the

401
01:07:42,139 --> 01:07:47,159
doctor now and I'm the priest. So I'm going to make sure you have all the medical stuff.

402
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:59,940
Okay, where is this thing? You found entries on Hawthorne's term in the captain's quarters

403
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:03,380
regarding his attempts to turn Simon over. Hawthorne planned to replace him with an acid

404
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:10,579
steeper but never picked up the part from Rose Way. Welcome back captain. Where's Rose Way? How

405
01:08:10,579 --> 01:08:18,729
can I be of assistance? Goodbye. I don't have access to Rose Way yet, huh?

406
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:29,750
Well, shit. Okay. So Rose Way is not accessible so we can't do that yet. So we're just going to go to

407
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:41,659
where we were going before. The ground breaker has approved our request for docking captain.

408
01:08:41,659 --> 01:09:02,810
Oh, all right. Okay. Let's have a meeting. Party select. Just you. It's just you. So right now

409
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:09,579
this actor is reading the script for what's coming up. He's not happy about it. He's like,

410
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:13,899
wait, they made changes? I have to be the fucking doctor now? Oh, that seems a little...

411
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:21,560
Well, you're the director, I guess. Okay. I thought I was hired to be the priest.

412
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:38,729
All right, let's go. Smells like grease and unwashed bodies. Just as I remembered. That's

413
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:44,550
not the point. This hat would just knock out one of my workers. Yeah, with a tossball stick. I heard

414
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:50,470
you the first time. There weren't any witnesses. No witnesses. He's not even denying it. No

415
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:57,029
witnesses. Jackass had it coming. Sorry. Shut it, Felix. Hi, I am interrupting you. If you could

416
01:09:57,029 --> 01:10:02,409
move along, I'd be obliged. Don't go telling him where to step. Ground breaker belongs to all of

417
01:10:02,409 --> 01:10:10,010
us. Felix, first of all, no, it doesn't. And second, shut the hell up. Don't think I won't detain you

418
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:16,890
again. Are you head backwards? Does this head 180 degrees turn like broken neck?

419
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:24,569
You look like you got enough problems. Mind if I have a word with the kid? Hey, knock yourself

420
01:10:24,569 --> 01:10:34,390
out. Or him, if you're so inclined. Whatever you heard, it's all true. I heard you, I heard you

421
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:37,510
knock somebody out with a tossball stick. The guy insulted my Rizzo's Rangers, all right?

422
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:42,949
You can't just insult my Rangers and expect to get away with it. What's Rizzo's Rangers? So of

423
01:10:42,949 --> 01:10:47,430
course I decked him with a tossball stick. I mean, what am I? What kind of fairweather fan?

424
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:54,409
Did he make fun of your Pokemon card deck choices? So you hit him with a stick? That's overreaction.

425
01:10:54,409 --> 01:10:59,050
You wouldn't be saying that if you'd been there. Guy never liked me. Always trying to get a rise

426
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:04,970
out of me. But I keep my chin up, right? Be the bigger man, I tell myself. He's a Spacer's chosen

427
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:10,569
man, though. So when the chosen beat my Rangers the other night, my foreman comes swaggering up

428
01:11:10,569 --> 01:11:18,489
with his head full of boasting. Oh boy. Oh, and that's when you resolve your differences like

429
01:11:18,489 --> 01:11:24,569
an adult, right? That's when I broadsided him with a tossball stick. Yeah. Look, this was a long time

430
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:29,289
coming. Guy thinks he can push me around because he's some sky-high foreman and I'm just a back

431
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:40,140
base dock worker. Well, former dock worker. Guess I just tendered my resignation. You're lucky you're

432
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:44,939
not serving a sentence. You know something? I am lucky. I ought to raise a glass of zero G to my

433
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:51,100
fortune if I had the bits. Hey, not for nothing. But I saw you wander out of that ship over there

434
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:55,260
by the dock. Wouldn't happen to be yours, would it? What does my ship have to do with you?

435
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:04,739
That's me, captain of the unreliable. Captain of the unreliable. You're like something out of a

436
01:12:04,739 --> 01:12:09,300
serial drama. Hey, I don't want to tuck your ears off guessing you got places to be. I appreciate

437
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:17,850
your time. Please don't hit me with a stick. Oh, not at all. Just, uh, you know, gonna figure out

438
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:26,260
what to do next. See you around, boss. Boss. Hey, what are you, what are you making this guy?

439
01:12:26,979 --> 01:12:31,699
I find myself marveling at the complex simplicity of the Fibonacci spiral.

440
01:12:31,699 --> 01:12:38,760
I'm sure you know what that's like. Something that he's gone. Let's talk about the thing,

441
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:43,479
you know, that thing with the thing that you want to do. Yes. Well, now that we're here,

442
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:46,600
can we check in with security? I'd like to track down that scholar.

443
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:56,420
That's the plan. Okay. All right, let's have the conversation with the lattice.

444
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:05,289
Customs and inspection, right this way. Identification, please. Oh, do I have,

445
01:13:05,289 --> 01:13:15,029
wait, I don't have the, do I have the thing on? I don't think I turned on the cloaking device.

446
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:20,550
You're guarding the door. I'll call you guard. You're welcome. That's only about the third or

447
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:25,670
fourth dumbest line I've heard all day. I give it a six out of ten. Seems a little high.

448
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:31,189
That was barely a three in my humble opinion. I was being generous for the sake of his pride.

449
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:44,060
So identification. You guys don't like this guy? How could you guys not like Max? Here. Captain

450
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:50,619
Hawthorne, you said. Let me apologize in advance. I'm about to ruin your day. According to your

451
01:13:50,619 --> 01:13:55,260
ship's record, you've been flagged by the board. Your ship will be impounded until such a time as

452
01:13:55,260 --> 01:14:00,939
they see fit. Well, isn't this wonderful? The captain's done something to get on the board's

453
01:14:00,939 --> 01:14:10,899
bad side. Now hold on. This isn't the end of the world. Probably. Uh, I take it back. I'm not

454
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:17,380
Hawthorne and that's not my ship. Oh, thank the law. I could use a diversion. Tell me more then.

455
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:23,859
Really sell it to me. It's not mine. Uh, well, I won the ship in a poker game. Hawthorne gave me

456
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:28,579
his ID so I could fly it. Hawthorne died in a crash. I took his ID so I could fly his ship.

457
01:14:28,579 --> 01:14:32,819
Captain Hawthorne abducted me and made me work for his ship for free. I'm a prisoner. Help.

458
01:14:32,819 --> 01:14:39,850
I like where this is headed. What happened to this uh vile kidnapper? I killed him. You must

459
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:51,460
feel terrific. Good for you. So I'm stuck here? Not stuck per se. You can always throw yourself

460
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:56,500
out the airlock. Of course then you find yourself with an exciting new problem. I'm on a secret

461
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:02,180
mission. Uh, I take it this happens a lot. Just the opposite. The board knows we don't take kindly

462
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:08,100
to their interfering in our operations here. Surely this must be some sort of mix-up. I had

463
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:14,819
to take a guess as to why. You probably riled up the wrong petty board bureaucrat. A man named Udom

464
01:15:14,819 --> 01:15:25,060
Bedford. Okay, so kill. Kill Bedford. I'm gonna wring this Bedford guy's neck. You take the

465
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:30,340
starch out of him. Well, you won't hear any complaints from me. Imagine admitting to like

466
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:38,329
the guard. I'm gonna do you a favor. Sure. Wand the door set over in sick day. Tell her the shipment's

467
01:15:38,329 --> 01:15:43,210
not in yet. It's not coming in anytime soon and if she'd be so obliged to get off my ass about it.

468
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:47,560
So if I do you this favor you're not going to talk about how I killed the guy that I just

469
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:53,579
told you I was going to go kill. Good. Got it. Much appreciated. Is there anything else I can help you

470
01:15:53,579 --> 01:16:01,239
with? I'm looking for Gladys. The fence. You'll find her and the rest and go on your left when

471
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:10,229
you enter the promenade. Make sure you bring an empty belly. What can you tell me about Bedford?

472
01:16:10,229 --> 01:16:14,630
Friendly enough unless you speak ill of the board. Get the sense he doesn't care for groundbreaker

473
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:21,930
much. Not that he would being a board man and all. He's our liaison. Sounds like a fun guy.

474
01:16:25,029 --> 01:16:30,149
Really likes his cereals too. Maybe a little too much. Bit of a weird bird all told.

475
01:16:30,949 --> 01:16:41,670
Okay. See you around. Be seeing you. Understood. I'll keep my head down.

476
01:16:51,829 --> 01:17:01,159
Through the hole in the glass. You thought that wasn't going to save you.

477
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:07,319
Doesn't seem to care though. All right let's go uh let's go talk to and I'm putting my hands in

478
01:17:07,319 --> 01:17:13,939
the air and going talk to Bedford. A quest objective requires you to enter a restricted

479
01:17:13,939 --> 01:17:17,859
area. If caught inside you'll be shot on sight. Using a disguise will prevent immediate hostilities.

480
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:23,079
Security I can check the departure's register to find out which crew check

481
01:17:23,079 --> 01:17:29,979
I mean the scholar shipped in and out with. What are you looking at?

482
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:37,640
What do you think? What do you think would dress funny? You think this is funny?

483
01:17:41,029 --> 01:17:44,310
Doctor and a scientist? What do you think? I don't understand. What's wrong?

484
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:58,949
Hey. Let's go Max. I picked up this weird signal the other day. It was coming from Monarch.

485
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:04,760
Here we go again. No one lives on Monarch. Well like you never seen a doctor walk into a ship

486
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:08,520
before? Never seen a doctor and a scientist walk into a ship? What's this for? What's going on

487
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:16,840
with your eyes? Oh don't even look at his face. Okay I'm not gonna kill somebody.

488
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:24,039
Okay okay okay okay. Wait restricted area. How do I turn on the disguise?

489
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:43,239
Who's talking to us? Is this restricted? Is there do I have to put on his disguise?

490
01:18:43,239 --> 01:18:46,439
Do I have like a his just how do I turn it on?

491
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:13,289
Okay two guys it's like Halloween costumes coming and steal all your stuff.

492
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:19,130
These aren't even Halloween costumes. Why do I think this is so out of the ordinary?

493
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:22,810
You're dressed as a doctor and I'm dressed as a priest. Why these Halloween costumes?

494
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:26,970
No they are Halloween costumes because that's the number one thing that's fucking sold at the

495
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:32,890
Halloween store is look at me I'm the priest or look at me I'm dressed as a doctor. I'm a doctor

496
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:53,670
dickhead. So this these are costumes. Steal rest and go key card. Red ammo. You gotta be the lookout

497
01:19:53,670 --> 01:20:10,020
man. All right good job. We have to go to 13. Oh that's not that's like literally right there.

498
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:22,409
All right let's go this way.

499
01:20:44,939 --> 01:20:49,340
That's the same thing from Lamy.

500
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,380
Ah it's going to do that thing.

501
01:20:59,979 --> 01:21:11,560
Put these kids to sleep. Fuck. All right interstellar crew.

502
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:17,960
Belle Everson. What do you got? What do you got in here? What's that?

503
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:23,369
You know that sound when you've snapped on an injector clip?

504
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:30,970
That's how you know your weapon loves you back. I got a full line of weapon modifications I'd be

505
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:39,779
happy to show you. For free. Holy shit. I mean your merchant skill is equal to the value of your best

506
01:21:39,779 --> 01:21:45,739
dialogue skill and is used to negotiate prices when buying and selling from vendors. And I am

507
01:21:46,539 --> 01:21:53,300
a huge liar. I got a 12% discount. All right let's let's see here.

508
01:21:54,340 --> 01:22:01,220
Weapon part. Okay. Extendo sight. A 2x scope that also extends the weapon's maximum range.

509
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:13,340
Increases weapon accuracy. Mr. Ouch. What else is in here? Should I grab one of these for the uh

510
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:24,090
should I grab a gyro sight for the um the revolver? Get a better scope for the sniper?

511
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:30,810
I don't have enough money. Yeah I do. Oh shit no I don't. Sell. Wait. This is important.

512
01:22:31,609 --> 01:22:39,909
I have a bunch of dog shit. All right hold z to sell junk. I've got 3,100. What did I sell?

513
01:22:41,899 --> 01:22:50,300
All right I can afford it now. What did I sell? Can I sell? Do they know it's stolen?

514
01:22:50,859 --> 01:23:07,350
All right now let's get the extendo sight. Let's get the gyro sight. I just want one. I don't want

515
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:15,609
to buy two of them. Did I just buy two? I just want one. I just want to buy one. Why does it say

516
01:23:15,609 --> 01:23:25,130
times two? Oh all right good good all right all right all right repair. I need a workbench.

517
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:55,180
Someone has got to talk with Chief Tennyson about the thermostat around here.

518
01:23:56,460 --> 01:24:10,100
Ain't gonna be me. So you buying? No I'm selling. I'm selling. Dead Eye assault rifle.

519
01:24:10,899 --> 01:24:19,689
I picked this up not that long ago. This is a good gun. Should I just keep it? Oh shit okay.

520
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:32,789
Okay if I sell it we'll be put back on display. So if I sell this come and we'll just be on

What else you got back here? Look at all this stuff that's just free. It's just for free.

523
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:59,060
Look these games it doesn't matter. It is free. What? Am I in trouble? All right fuck it. Let's

526
01:25:28,899 --> 01:25:37,510
That's so stupid. He's a liar. I have so many points in lying. I you know what?

527
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:47,529
Fuck it. Watch this. I'm gonna show you how good I am at lying. I didn't shoot anybody. What I can't

530
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:39,380

01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:46,359
mind trick. Back to Byzantium you gold plated bastards. Hey what? No one wants you on ground

532

gonna arrest us on our station? Yeah this is chief junley's ship. You don't own shit here.

534
01:27:03,699 --> 01:27:12,840
Step back by four bylaws to you success.

535
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:27,699
Okay I did it at least once. You trash.

Wait I have to steal this again. Don't give me freedom in a game. They just. What do you think

538
01:27:55,210 --> 01:28:01,140
this guy and keep intimidating and lying to him. Is that possible? Like I'm gonna wait for this

539
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:14,600
guy to go on his route. Take something in front of him and intimidate him every time. Yeah I've done

Okay we live here. Yeah this is chief junley's ship. You don't own shit here. Stupid. Step back.

544
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:05,619
Of course yeah they're gonna. You're gonna attack us? You waste of O2 scrubbers.

545
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:09,300
You fucking. Fucking algae eaters.

546
01:29:15,859 --> 01:29:26,949
Idiot. Yeah let's go to drink. Yeah hide behind that mask. Fucking still sick of that.

547
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:42,869
You can smoke in here? Holy shit is that. All right. I don't know you can smoke. What are you

548
01:29:42,869 --> 01:30:12,340
vaping? You're vaping. That's okay. Wait it's talking to quicksave right? Okay you can't give

549
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:26,380

550
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:32,060
bastards. Get out of here. Go back to. No one wants you on ground breaker. These stairs are board

551
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:36,859
property. Disperse now or I'll detain you for trespassing. Yeah get the fuck out of here.

552
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:44,539
You're really gonna arrest us on our station? We have rules here. Yeah this is chief junley's ship.

553
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:56,470
You don't own shit here. That's right you don't. With space you for trying you. You waste of O2

554
01:30:56,470 --> 01:31:02,869
scrubbers. Yeah O2 scrubbers. Yeah go back. Go back to your. Go back to your station.

555
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:18,279
We got a date at the lost hope anyway. Remember no smoking citizen. Can you fucking believe some

556
01:31:18,279 --> 01:31:24,310
people? Seriously some people are just so rude. We have. Well we're gonna just let them in.

557
01:31:25,109 --> 01:31:33,000
We're told we we can't let anybody in here. Man like do they really I don't it's not like I

558
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:45,699
I just we have to enforce the rules. Yeah carry on. Something about being in space gives me the creeps.

559
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:50,899
I seriously I know what the fuck. I'm Julie doesn't talk very much but I don't understand.

560
01:31:50,899 --> 01:31:56,649
That this job is fucking stressful. Feels like I'm melting. I know every day.

561
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:05,750
Metaphorically you know and physically it's hot up here. Unless you have business with the board

562
01:32:05,829 --> 01:32:11,020
move along. That's what I mean. Unless you have something to do you have an ID or something like

563
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:14,539
get the fuck out of here. We're doing. We have to. It's our job to do this.

564
01:32:36,149 --> 01:32:37,350
Waiting for the announcement.

565
01:32:42,659 --> 01:32:47,060
This is when a teacher is going over something in class and the principal goes over the loudspeaker

566
01:32:47,060 --> 01:33:14,220
and everyone. Okay I was in the middle of algebra but. Okay. Ah yes. Wheeler messaged me you were

567
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:19,020
coming. You must be the captain of the unreliable. A vessel that used to be helmed by one Alex

568
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:26,699
Hawthorne. And you are not he. Has something happened to my favorite scruffy freelancer.

569
01:33:29,819 --> 01:33:33,579
Forget Alex. Why'd you impound my ship. I'm gonna wring your scrawny neck.

570
01:33:33,579 --> 01:33:45,029
You sprat fuck. Give me back my ship. There's no need for hysterics. This is all a hilarious

571
01:33:45,029 --> 01:33:52,069
misunderstanding. Really. Explain it. Am I laughing about this. Right. Right. You're going

572
01:33:52,069 --> 01:33:57,989
important places I'm sure. Big exciting important places. And I want money too. I've removed the

573
01:33:57,989 --> 01:34:03,510
flag from your ship. I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience. However before you go. Open the

574
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:09,109
register. Tell me the location of Phineas Wells. I'm sure you've seen his wanted posters all over

575
01:34:09,109 --> 01:34:15,670
the colony. Did Alex tell you where Wells might be. Anything. This guy's such a pushover. What.

576
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:22,460
Do I know where Phineas. Yeah. I know where he is. He's up on. He's in like. He's on a satellite.

577
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:29,670
I'll find. I know where he is. Wait. This is my. Settle out this person. What do you think I know

578
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:35,670
anything about Wells. Well Alex knew. Or he said he did. And you have his ship. Maybe he kept some

579
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:41,270
records around or conveniently placed. And I want your mustache too. Give it to me. I know that's

580
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:54,390
fake. I want to wear it. Nobody talks about Phineas. That's. Well that's just terrible news.

581
01:34:56,060 --> 01:35:06,500
Going to do now. Oh I'm sorry. This is terribly unprofessional of me. Is there anything else I

582
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:15,300
might help you with. Yeah. Why. Why are you in trouble. It's personal business I'm afraid.

583
01:35:15,859 --> 01:35:23,979
Miserably terribly personal. What can I do. No. Stop playing coy. What's going on. I don't intend

584
01:35:23,979 --> 01:35:29,500
to be. It's just a matter of trust. This is where I start signaling like about is there a bug under

585
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:34,619
your desk. Like I'm going to put my hands in the air and be like talk talk to like open my hands up

586
01:35:34,619 --> 01:35:43,699
and like under your desk. And then when I. I can nod. We can go somewhere else. How can I win your

587
01:35:43,699 --> 01:35:50,899
trust. Information on the whereabouts of Phineas Wells would go a long way. It's. Well it's my

588
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:55,619
way. Right on a piece of paper bugged and then hold it up and be like

589
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:04,199
like that. OK. Information on the whereabouts of Phineas Wells would go a long way. It's. Well

590
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:13,770
it's my white whale I suppose. All right. Do we sell out the guy that cryogenically unfroze us

591
01:36:14,409 --> 01:36:21,819
or. No. Fuck this guy. It's fine. Really. It's perfectly fine. I understand. Now if you've

592
01:36:21,819 --> 01:36:58,119
nothing else please see yourself out. I'd like to drown myself in work. OK. I need this password

593
01:36:58,119 --> 01:37:05,989
to unlock. What a new password. These guys are all heavily armed. There's no way I can get through

594
01:37:05,989 --> 01:37:20,439
here. Can I steal from him. Just beat him up for the password. That doesn't. No I'm going to get

595
01:37:20,439 --> 01:37:26,789
attacked. This whole thing. If I fire a weapon here this whole town is going to go on lockdown.

596
01:37:35,369 --> 01:37:54,699
No. No no no. I can't. I did what I wanted to do. I was passing through.

597
01:37:59,859 --> 01:38:04,380
Sell out Phineas and you'll get the password. I'll get the password eventually.

598
01:38:08,819 --> 01:38:12,060
What the hell. Sorry about the heat.

599
01:38:12,779 --> 01:38:18,550
Chief Tanison will get the radiators fixed soon. Of course. What if I sell him out and then kill him.

600
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:24,229
Zero G brew extra refreshing. It's an ale that's good for what else.

601
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:32,060
Oh and it's not the best choice. It's Spacer's choice. Taste the freedom.

602
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:39,270
A lot of slogans to keep track of. Sometimes I forget. All right.

603
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:48,229
How did you get that. I'm bound to satisfy headgear related inquiries. Please send any

604
01:38:48,229 --> 01:38:53,590
complaints to our consumer care headwear division. It's not a complaint. It's I would I want. When

605
01:38:53,670 --> 01:39:03,270
can I get that. You would never ask if you knew what it's like in here. I mean why anyone can be

606
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:09,590
a Spacer's Choice Consumer Relations Choice Specialist. Just keep your nose clean and aim

607
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:25,979
for the moon. Talk it. But is there a bug under your desk. Bug. All right. Have a look. Well you

608
01:39:25,979 --> 01:39:40,199
can get them. Huh. Isn't that something. Lie plus five. I need I have to have this. It was made for

609
01:39:40,199 --> 01:40:15,100
this character. How much are they. They're not that expensive. It doesn't show it. Unbelievable.

610
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:39,020
How could they. How could they. Wait wrong person. OK. I just got freaked out. So I have one on. Hey

611
01:40:39,819 --> 01:40:43,180
you want to join us. You should give our latest product to try.

612
01:40:44,119 --> 01:40:50,760
All the all the talk see free. Get one for Sam with activated charcoal. Don't take my word for it.

613
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:59,020
See for yourself. We're gonna have one for Sam to make a choice. Spacer's Choice. Hey we're wearing

614
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:07,560
the same hat. I got you too. I mean. Yeah. Same hat. All right. You are. Looks really good on you.

615
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:13,539
Sam can't wear it. It's a robot on your giant head. Hope you're very happy in there. Wear it

616
01:41:13,539 --> 01:41:22,300
with pride. No one can take that away from you. OK. What do you got. Have a look. So I can't get it

617
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:38,920
for Sam. That's unfortunate. But what about. OK. Hack. Is there a lie suit. Oh. Oh. Why do you have

618
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:48,520
better shit than the person that sells these exclusively. Fun times barrel. I need it. Wait

619
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:55,909
what does that do. Crit damage 25 percent. Firing noise minus 66 percent. That's pretty good.

620
01:41:59,430 --> 01:42:13,369
Taint plasma. Didn't you guys say get the plasma plasma thing. Maybe I should get plasma. I don't

621
01:42:13,369 --> 01:42:19,909
do. I don't even have one of these already. How much are they. This thing's eight hundred ninety

622
01:42:19,909 --> 01:42:31,140
five dollars. All right. Fine. Fuck it. All right. All right. All right. I need a workbench.

623
01:42:31,779 --> 01:43:39,140
If he does it. All right. This is getting real greedy here. I can't beat this. Just totally

624
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:46,069
absolutely. No no no no. I mean I'll keep that stuff. I don't want to sell it. All right. Let's

625
01:43:46,069 --> 01:44:12,279
keep going. Hey. What's in the safe. Bless my heart. A stranger come knocking on a poor old

626
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:19,020
woman's door. You here for a particular reason. Or did the neighbors tell you how good my sugar

627
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:25,979
cookies are. What made without a single natural ingredient or an oven just like store bought.

628
01:44:27,109 --> 01:44:32,710
OK. What do you have to say. What do you have for sale. Want a charming copper kettle off that

629
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:38,630
girl who runs the pub. She's a fierce arm wrestler but she's no match for your pal Gladys.

630
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:53,479
Hey this lady just speaks in riddles. Plasma rifle. Axe candy. All right. Fine. I'll say I

631
01:44:53,479 --> 01:44:59,159
need money. I don't have any money. OK. Too bad. Holy shit. How do I take this from you.

632
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:10,090
How I steal that. That's insane. OK. Well let's talk about stuff. Why is it hot in here.

633
01:45:10,090 --> 01:45:15,289
Buy candy. Or is it just my glands acting up again. All right. Phineas sent me. He said you

634
01:45:15,289 --> 01:45:20,890
could sell me a nav key to Stellar Bay. Those have been the height of illegality since Stellar Bay

635
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:26,170
turned their noses up at the board. You and I could be thrown to the void just for discussing

636
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:30,409
such a transaction. Well the guy that's on the board is a wuss. Groundbreaker is a free port.

637
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:37,850
We're outside of the board's control. For the time being at least. Now I only have the one nav key

638
01:45:38,569 --> 01:45:44,699
and they're hard to come by these days. It won't be cheap. If you find yourself lacking in the bits

639
01:45:45,579 --> 01:45:53,800
I might have an opportunity you'd be interested in. OK. It's ten thousand bits.

640
01:45:54,760 --> 01:46:04,710
Oh my god. No one's ever found my bits lacking. Any chance of a discount. Phineas. That old kook.

641
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:09,350
He was quite the dancer back in his prime. Did he tell you? Bria lied on his feet.

642
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:17,239
Bria lied in the wallet too. He still owes me a small fortune. Laws. Maybe I should charge you

643
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:28,260
and maybe I should vaporize you. And that's when we both silent

644
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:31,460
for like a full 10 to 20 seconds and then finally she cracks.

645
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:38,899
Well I find I'm in need of a ship captain with a little

646
01:46:39,779 --> 01:46:44,739
more of flexibility. Vaping. Might be this could help out the groundbreaker as well as earn some

647
01:46:44,739 --> 01:46:51,960
bits. But if you've got qualms. Well qualms. Let's talk about the details. What are the jobs

648
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:54,760
do you know about? What do you got? Anything else? You might want to acquaint yourself with

649
01:46:54,760 --> 01:47:00,279
June Lay Tennyson. Groundbreaker's chief. She's been trying to get a handle on this heat problem

650
01:47:00,279 --> 01:47:06,840
we've got. You'll find her fretting in engineering. I'd say she's a sweet girl but lawful offends

651
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:18,359
someone call me a liar. OK. Yes dearie. I'm ready to look into it. Ain't that just a treat. So

652
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:25,159
you know Edna over in engineering. On occasion she'll pass along transmissions I might find

653
01:47:25,159 --> 01:47:30,039
interesting. She sent me a recording of a distress signal she'd scraped from the

654
01:47:30,039 --> 01:47:36,600
groundbreaker's calm array. Curious thing is it came from an outpost called Roseway. Roseway.

655
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:40,359
And Auntie Cleo abandoned that place years ago. That's where I need to go.

656
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,720
Say no more. I'm in.

657
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:50,539
You've got an ear for intrigue and a nose for bits. I like that. Here's a copy of the SOS

658
01:47:50,539 --> 01:47:55,260
recording complete with the coordinates. If you should find a secret worth selling

659
01:47:55,979 --> 01:48:01,899
might be I could find a buyer. Corporate bigwigs will pay top bit for inside information on their

660
01:48:01,899 --> 01:48:07,659
competitors. The more we got the corpse fighting each other the less time they got to meddle in

661
01:48:07,659 --> 01:48:14,579
our affairs. Abandoned outpost corporate secrets. Got it. Don't forget to come find old Gladys when

662
01:48:14,579 --> 01:48:21,819
you're done. Thanks for your time. Anytime sweetheart. You know where to find me. Here

663
01:48:21,819 --> 01:48:31,609
take a candy with you. Nice. That just kind of scared the shit out of me for a second.

664
01:48:32,010 --> 01:48:47,770
Okay so here's the thing. I got moon man helmet and okay so I'm at 60

665
01:48:49,270 --> 01:49:08,340
lying. I need to increase my weapons but it's only gonna uh inspiration. Companion abilities. You can

666
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:27,380
order companions to do special attacks. Okay let's at least get that. Now how do I go over

667
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:33,140
50? I remember to explain it. Okay let's see. Up to rank 50. After 50 you can add points directly

668
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:38,340
to specialized skills. So I have to actually add it. It doesn't work like this. Okay I see.

669
01:49:41,829 --> 01:49:49,510
60 lie is scrambled auto chemicals attack at their normal speed. I gotta do some more weapons

670
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:59,770
like handguns or long guns or something. Minimum armor penetration. Yeah something like that.

671
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:06,970
Same thing with long guns. Long guns headshot it does 20 more damage at 50.

672
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:22,390
All right let's do this because it'll do both of these and then get try to get this to 50.

673
01:50:26,149 --> 01:50:35,380
Dodge though. Yeah I know this character is horrible. Don't worry I know. You can command

674
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:39,380
your companions to use their special abilities on the enemy you are targeting. Companion one ability

675
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:50,970
companion two ability. Okay cool. Perk. Uh not that one. Vendor prices. That's actually pretty

676
01:50:50,970 --> 01:51:05,029
good. 20 percent. I already have 10 11 percent so that'll be 30 plus percent. I'm rating few more

677
01:51:05,029 --> 01:51:13,930
bits. Additional ammo stock on vendors. Companion crit chance. Minus one weapon armor durability

678
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:23,460
loss. That's pretty good. That one's good too. They're all good. I think I'm gonna do this one.

679
01:51:24,659 --> 01:51:37,399
You can just repair them. Yeah recharge rate for the I don't know. I think I'm just gonna do

680
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:45,529
the this this tactical time dilation recharge rate. Yeah let's do it.

681
01:51:51,350 --> 01:52:00,300
All right let's continue. I got a lot of random things to do. So uh I have to go

682
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:13,000
talk to Jun Jun Lee Tennyson or I could go do this. I could get Sam. The distress signal has a

683
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:19,159
nav coordinate embedded in it. Play it on your ship so that Ada can get to the Roseway landing

684
01:52:19,159 --> 01:52:24,539
pad. All right we're gonna do this. We're gonna get out of here. We'll do that. We'll come back

685
01:52:24,539 --> 01:52:52,550
into this part after. This is a bathroom. Ada. All right let's do modify. So I was going to what

686
01:52:52,550 --> 01:53:05,239
was I gonna do? I have the scope right? This is times two. What's on it right now? Okay this is

687
01:53:05,239 --> 01:53:09,960
power. This is times two. What's on it right now? Current extend aside is already on it.

688
01:53:11,939 --> 01:53:20,060
Shit okay well I'm not gonna put no I'm not gonna put plasma on the sniper. Don't worry

689
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:25,909
nothing on this one yet. All right this is the one. I was gonna put plasma on the revolver.

690
01:53:26,470 --> 01:53:55,819
Now wait this is the new one that I stole. This is an assault rifle. Plasma on the assault rifle.

691
01:53:56,619 --> 01:54:19,819
Yep look at this thing. This thing's fucking nuts and it's got an extendo sight.

692
01:54:21,109 --> 01:54:32,329
Exacto sight? Put an extendo sight on it too. No I'm gonna keep this one on. All right now what

693
01:54:32,329 --> 01:54:36,550
did I want to do with you? Nothing. You just get the fuck out of here. You're useless now.

694
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:47,180
Actually not really. All right well that's enough. Wait where is it? 73? I don't have enough money to

695
01:54:47,180 --> 01:55:05,829
do this. Fuck. Damn it. Well wait break down these pistols. I bought a bunch of bullshit.

696
01:55:10,869 --> 01:55:25,800
Who are you? Hey you got a second? You got you got like a bunch of sleeping bags and stuff. Are

697
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:31,560
you trying to come onto the ship here? Fancy running into you again. Don't mind me. It's just

698
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:35,880
admiring your ship from up close. Gotta hand it to you boss. That's a fun looking ship.

699
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:43,609
Only thing it's missing is me. No. I get it. Get lost. You don't like seeing a guy stake that next

700
01:55:43,609 --> 01:55:48,810
to your ship. Looks like I'm trying to ambush you or sell you something. Just give me a shot. That's

701
01:55:48,810 --> 01:55:56,869
all I'm asking. No. I could be the best damn crew you ever hired. I've heard enough of you. All

702
01:55:56,869 --> 01:56:00,149
right Felix tell me why should I hire you? Okay Felix consider this your interview.

703
01:56:01,029 --> 01:56:04,390
If you're trying to convince me to hire you you're doing it you're going about it all wrong.

704
01:56:05,109 --> 01:56:11,579
Oh okay well can you give me a couple of pointers? Sure I'll help you out here.

705
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:18,340
Don't beg. Tell me why I need you on my crew. Hey that's good advice. I like the way you think

706
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:21,859
boss. Not your boss. I never will be. Besides not like there's a line of folks standing around

707
01:56:21,859 --> 01:56:27,539
hoping to get on your ship. I'm persistent. I'm eager and I'm showing initiative. What else do

708
01:56:27,539 --> 01:56:36,859
you want on your crew? Um how about an interview? Sure an interview. That sounds fair. I mean first

709
01:56:36,859 --> 01:56:49,100
time for everything right? Ask me anything you like. Okay what's the value of pie? Uh it's delicious

710
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:54,460
mock apple pie and a tripe kale crust maybe with a little cream on top. Classic.

711
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:05,819
That was that was an alleviate the mood interview joke.

712
01:57:06,939 --> 01:57:10,619
But that's kind of overdone at this point. I don't that's that's like that's so

713
01:57:11,579 --> 01:57:14,710
people do that that's so cliche now. What's your biggest flaw?

714
01:57:14,710 --> 01:57:18,550
Norman told me my biggest problem was that I didn't take orders. I told him my problem

715
01:57:18,550 --> 01:57:24,039
it's not with authority it's with jackasses. So yeah I guess my biggest flaw is that I don't

716
01:57:24,119 --> 01:57:31,319
suffer idiots. Hope that's not a deal breaker. It is. Well I tried my best. I appreciate you

717
01:57:31,319 --> 01:57:35,159
giving me another shot at least. Why? If you change your mind I'll be right here in the docking base.

718
01:57:35,159 --> 01:58:00,380
Never gonna leave. He wouldn't have looked as good as you do in that mask. Yeah he told me he doesn't

719
01:58:00,380 --> 01:58:04,220
suffer idiots and everyone if you're if you're just dumber than me I don't like you. It's like

720
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:14,359
okay I'm dumb. So leave. That was his mistake. I gave him a chance. He made like a shitty cliche

721
01:58:15,079 --> 01:58:21,029
this is a fun interview joke and then I wasn't feeling it because that's kind of cliche and then

722
01:58:21,029 --> 01:58:24,470
he said he doesn't like stupid people and I'm stupid. You want me to hire that person?

723
01:58:25,590 --> 01:58:34,359
Not gonna happen. Welcome back captain. How can I be of assistance? I picked up a distress call.

724
01:58:34,359 --> 01:58:41,800
Play it for me. Yes captain beginning playback now. There's viscera and death everywhere.

725
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:48,439
Gunfire gnashing teeth. They're unemployed. For law's sake if anyone's receiving this please send

726
01:58:48,439 --> 01:59:00,649
help. What? Captain we are now capable of accessing the Roseway landing pad. Also corporate protocol

727
01:59:00,649 --> 01:59:06,329
requires that all distress signals include a list of key personnel for retrieval. The embedded names

728
01:59:06,329 --> 01:59:17,880
are Anton Crane, Von Cortez, and Orson Shaw. Okay goodbye. See you soon captain. No no no.

729
01:59:20,439 --> 01:59:34,300
Terra 2. Roseway landing pad. We're now in orbit above Roseway captain. Cool all right let's go.

730
01:59:36,779 --> 01:59:49,159
Roseway. Yeah scene three is got me wearing a mask now. This is the worst fucking acting gig

731
01:59:49,159 --> 02:00:07,989
I've ever done. What? It pays all right. I'm gonna stick with it. Where's my friend? All right let's

732
02:00:07,989 --> 02:00:18,710
do uh not the distress signal. The doom that came to Roseway. Distress call uh tomorrow. No no no.

733
02:00:18,710 --> 02:00:33,750
The cleaning machine. There it is. This way? Wait I deselected him? How the fuck did I do that?

734
02:00:43,270 --> 02:01:01,979
The unreliable narrator. Oh I see underneath. There it is. Okay what's this? Insert captain's

735
02:01:01,979 --> 02:01:08,359
identification cartridge to initiate remote landing. I think I already did that. Follow me.

736
02:01:09,079 --> 02:01:17,020
Let's take out the all right wait wait wait wait wait wait. Dead eye assault rifle. Let's check it

737
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:32,520
out. Ooh yep nice. Good thing I'm so glad I stole this. Is there a wall here? Of course there is.

738
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:45,819
Adventure does favor the bold. Does. Did I scream? Was it him? This is a silent protagonist. They

739
02:01:45,819 --> 02:02:01,640
don't scream. We all scream for ice cream. I did half of it. I didn't do the other half though.

740
02:02:02,359 --> 02:02:22,979
See if I can get this right in the head. Won't get any mercy from me. Wow. Fate shines on us today.

741
02:02:24,779 --> 02:02:34,649
This thing is pretty good from that far away. Yeah that's what we're making pretty damn good

742
02:02:34,649 --> 02:02:58,949
progress. Nice. Wow we actually are can kill things now. All it took was a little bit of

743
02:02:58,949 --> 02:03:12,119
thievery. I'm sorry. I didn't. You're smart enough to not run fast into this. Everything's fine. I'm

744
02:03:12,119 --> 02:03:33,289
good. Just eat an apple. Eat a can of tuna. All right. Acid steeper is in there. It's a workbench.

745
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:45,720
All right. Is it where we have to be careful? Give me my my revolver. Yeah. Yep. Yes. Do the

746
02:03:45,720 --> 02:04:07,260
tuna sound. What does the tuna sound? What does that mean? Oh shit. Do your super move. Over there.

747
02:04:10,739 --> 02:04:30,409
What? He has a knife now? What is going on? Oh he's dead. So it does a cut scene.

748
02:04:32,869 --> 02:04:49,340
Oh okay that's weird. Can I heal you? I could spend hours reflecting on the secret workings

749
02:04:49,420 --> 02:04:56,140
of the universe. Little else in this colony offers such a relaxing pastime. So tell me

750
02:04:56,140 --> 02:05:17,369
what's on your mind. I excel at confessional listening. Okay slow down. Cleanliness isn't

751
02:05:17,369 --> 02:05:22,649
much of a priority I take it. Oh no like wait. If you need to get into the armory and don't have

752
02:05:22,649 --> 02:05:52,500
the code ask me. If I'm not around check the front desk at the antibiotics lab. No. God damn it.

753
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:58,100
Where's the where's the antibiotics lab? Is it auntie or auntie? I thought it was

754
02:05:58,100 --> 02:06:14,760
auntie. Where where is that? I don't have any lock picking skill. Shit. Why can't you be a lock

755
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:43,670
picker? There's no other way to get in there. I have to go find that person. Oh that don't work.

756
02:06:51,720 --> 02:07:29,500
Ow. Oh my god. Is this a boss? That thing was insane. Okay what were you what were you guarding?

757
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:43,319
No nothing. Who's calling me? Oh no there's a bunch of them. I have to we have to leave.

758
02:07:43,319 --> 02:07:59,670
This is not going to work out. Holy shit there's somebody right at the front door.

759
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:22,460
Super move. Oh wow that was awesome. Nice work. Oh still alive. All right that was pretty cool.

760
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:41,060
I gotta say. All right there's a chest over here. Oh wait a minute. Smaller than a prison cell.

761
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:52,119
Come on you have to passcode. Thank god. The password I think was one two three four by the

762
02:08:52,119 --> 02:09:17,079
way. What's that? Toothpaste? Okay we did it. That was hot. I don't know okay is that let me go over

763
02:09:17,079 --> 02:09:23,239
something very quickly you guys. So before the stream started somebody I don't know who you

764
02:09:23,239 --> 02:09:30,619
might even still be here. Somebody said dude you should do the whole stream in a Boston accent.

765
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:39,420
And I keep thinking back to that person and I'm doing it because I'm thinking about them

766
02:09:39,420 --> 02:10:02,380
saying it. All right here we go. Like you're in my head. All right what is this? Armory logs. Force

767
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:15,539
flog the flogistinator pistol. Force flogisticotron pistol status functional untrained

768
02:10:15,539 --> 02:10:19,619
personnel must attend site safety seminar before using as a seminar officer is not currently

769
02:10:19,619 --> 02:10:28,939
available recommend permanent secure storage ammunition entry is not found where do I get

770
02:10:28,939 --> 02:10:46,579
that uh where do I get the flogistinator plasma carbine what's that do acid steeper there it is

771
02:10:46,579 --> 02:11:01,989
energy cells I think that's all there is to do in here I could keep going down is there anything

772
02:11:01,989 --> 02:11:16,390
else in here there's something else in rose way the stress signal the schematics for orson's

773
02:11:16,390 --> 02:11:25,239
prototype would likely be valuable to gladis the stress call from the broadcast tower and

774
02:11:26,819 --> 02:11:36,020
company secrets schematics yeah there it is so there is something down here maintenance logs

775
02:11:36,579 --> 02:11:43,770
is this too much info no it's not there's one sentence we don't have a replacement someone

776
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:48,890
tried to disable the mandatory consumer broadcast on 17 the thing got stuck in maximum volume mode

777
02:11:48,890 --> 02:11:53,529
until we factory reset it 12 it's serious malfunction today we shut it down for now

778
02:11:54,090 --> 02:11:57,689
no response on the behavior modules for the time being we'll have to just uh hype in the chat

779
02:11:58,890 --> 02:12:31,770
whatever it says where's your uh belly why don't you not have a belly everyone you keep seeing

780
02:12:31,770 --> 02:12:47,060
everyone it's just me mono lens oh boy the cartridges okay let's get the schematic

781
02:12:47,220 --> 02:12:53,619
um detailed drawings of an advanced pistol revisions and comments are scrawled across

782
02:12:53,619 --> 02:12:59,140
the image in mostly illegible writing except for the name orson shaw scribbled in the corner

783
02:12:59,140 --> 02:13:08,859
the schematics depict a flog pistol from a brand name force which is not native to the halcyon

784
02:13:08,859 --> 02:13:25,510
colony it is unclear from these plans what a flog does okay i got plans energy cell what's up here

785
02:13:28,619 --> 02:13:34,119
okay investigate rose where to find potential company secrets that could be sold to the highest

786
02:13:34,119 --> 02:13:43,800
bidder so i have one of the company secrets but there's also this distress call and i want to see

what wait what got me i just do what i'm told i was told not to do such uh who's in charge

813
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:10,899
scientist name anton crane someone said he's panicking inside the comm center it actually

814
02:20:10,899 --> 02:20:17,319
looks pretty calm out here alarms went off raps broke loose and i hightailed it in here to get

815
02:20:17,319 --> 02:20:24,549
a wall between me and them beasts you said the raps broke loose did you have them in a cage

816
02:20:24,549 --> 02:20:36,250
um forget i said anything about that okay oh before i forget anti-cleo's i see anti-cleo's

817
02:20:37,450 --> 02:20:46,100
better than nature anti not like that crappy basers choice i had it right actually i think

818
02:20:46,100 --> 02:20:56,889
i need to do something here don't i uh solution uh distress signal no no no long tomorrow

819
02:20:59,129 --> 02:21:11,899
no i thought i could get uh oh it's a doctor i like you if you've come to end my life

820
02:21:11,899 --> 02:21:19,690
let's be on with it oh not actually one of them are you no did you send the distress call you kind

821
02:21:19,690 --> 02:21:24,569
of look like the guy that sent the distress call right the first time i hear to end your life

822
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:37,379
if i knew who he was he'd already be dead what i um i'm anton crane the lead scientist here

823
02:21:38,489 --> 02:21:44,969
i must apologize if my call diverted you i may have panicked everything's under control now

824
02:21:44,969 --> 02:21:54,760
though truth be told what did you think i was why one of our attackers of course obviously they

825
02:21:54,760 --> 02:22:02,360
were drawn here in an attempt to make off with my research why cancel the distress call my research

826
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:07,559
may not quite fall within legal parameters illegal dead i'm under orders to maintain wireless

827
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:12,680
however having your head used as target practice can addle one's thinking

828
02:22:13,799 --> 02:22:18,280
i cut the call immediately once i've gathered my width so it was a home office can't know what's

829
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:24,790
happening here oh yeah tell me what you're actually doing here or i will let them know myself

830
02:22:26,229 --> 02:22:32,229
and take great joy in doing so i might add thank you doctor max i appreciate that if i don't get

831
02:22:32,229 --> 02:22:38,629
that research back my life has got me backed up we were tasked with formulating a new and improved

832
02:22:38,629 --> 02:22:48,680
dental gel dental gel yes i see very important uh what's the dental gel toothpaste one cannot

833
02:22:48,680 --> 02:22:57,940
exaggerate the benefits of good dental hygiene may i continue please do while doing research

834
02:22:57,940 --> 02:23:02,739
on enzymes specific to the raptidons digestive system we developed an additive which we

835
02:23:02,739 --> 02:23:11,290
subsequently discovered to be the most effective appetite suppressant ever uh you can couch it

836
02:23:11,290 --> 02:23:17,690
however you like it's still just toothpaste uh diet toothpaste not just any diet toothpaste

837
02:23:18,409 --> 02:23:26,309
the ultimate diet toothpaste that's like discovering the best rocket fuel ever

838
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:31,350
oh i'm certain it could be made into that as well with only a few changes to its molecular

839
02:23:31,350 --> 02:23:36,950
i'm just the ogre from warcraft you're missing the point let's focus for a moment shall we

840
02:23:36,950 --> 02:23:42,309
even if you disregard the obvious value of auntie cleo's apazap diet toothpaste in and of itself

841
02:23:42,309 --> 02:23:47,829
we're talking about my career here toothpaste oh how absolutely adequate toothpaste good

842
02:23:47,829 --> 02:23:58,729
that's i'm speaking twice with two different heads uh auntie cleo's apazap diet toothpaste in itself

843
02:24:00,340 --> 02:24:07,459
nice is it not came up with that myself oh yeah an ogre mage almost as befuddled as my co-workers

844
02:24:07,459 --> 02:24:13,620
here what do you want from me hours ago a group of vicious malcontents fell upon us

845
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:20,819
shot up our labs and loosed our research subjects the raptidons if those cretins get their hands on

846
02:24:20,819 --> 02:24:28,090
my research well they'll need not kill me remove the cretins retrieved this research check you want

847
02:24:28,090 --> 02:24:34,889
should i handle your rapidon problem yes but don't kill our mother if it's avoidable we've

848
02:24:34,889 --> 02:24:40,569
need of her to replenish our stocks i think there's gas in the lab somewhere that can be

849
02:24:40,569 --> 02:24:46,649
used to put them out the research is in the safe in my office you'll have need of my code and key

850
02:24:46,649 --> 02:24:52,969
card the lab's entrance is in the side of a hill you can't miss it if you just follow the road

851
02:24:53,049 --> 02:25:02,950
you'll pass by the town's original by the grand architect jameson he's in the old lab who's jameson

852
02:25:02,950 --> 02:25:09,909
my protege i sent him to retrieve some metabolic precursors and i forgot him how do you forget

853
02:25:09,909 --> 02:25:16,979
what you forgot him you left him to die you should be ashamed of yourself don't you think it weighs on

854
02:25:16,979 --> 02:25:24,020
me he was my responsibility all of them were ah regardless of their thinking on the matter yet

855
02:25:24,020 --> 02:25:30,620
you send me to do this if he has died too many have been lost too many black marks against my

856
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:40,549
name and far too much paperwork yeah yeah you're gonna have to give up your swishy latex doctor

02:45:02,389 --> 02:45:08,790
mortal peril it's like he thinks i'm a child his hands-on management style is coming to a point

955
02:45:08,790 --> 02:45:14,309
of contention i tell you you're upset that he sent me to rescue you take it up with him if you'd like

956
02:45:14,309 --> 02:45:20,940

960
02:45:57,500 --> 02:46:09,500
okay this one no it's this one so eliminate the outlaws and the raptidons so that's downed

961
02:46:09,500 --> 02:46:18,969
in the lab i guess maybe somewhere we're gonna go take a look is there a way for me to go down

962
02:46:20,389 --> 02:46:26,809
there is okay uh do you think here's a little trick i learned in prison

963
02:46:28,329 --> 02:46:55,129
you went to prison live watch out he can do this very often

964
02:46:56,170 --> 02:47:17,260
anymore i think that's it no you're going the wrong way okay so let's get this get this

965
02:47:18,780 --> 02:47:33,739
get this oh a hack i can hack this anti riot gear i'll take it all right now over here i have to

966
02:47:33,739 --> 02:47:39,340
deal with the raptidons don't kill the mother i'm gonna fuck this up the mother's probably gonna die

967
02:47:44,760 --> 02:48:04,569
right over here wait is it just up there hold on it's just in that room i guess it's just in here

968
02:48:05,209 --> 02:48:16,010
oh this is the wrong lab wrong place oh okay all right all right all right all right well

969
02:48:16,889 --> 02:48:33,500
all right can i fast travel anywhere wait a minute fine and safe so we're gonna go back this way

970
02:48:35,959 --> 02:48:48,780
wrong planet you're on the wrong planet that would be stupid all right truth be told

971
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:57,219
this weapon is the only weapon i have that's worth using the revolver isn't doing much damage

972
02:48:57,379 --> 02:49:12,280
don't i'm dead okay i'm not dead i can't believe you guys made it slow

973
02:49:22,409 --> 02:49:33,879
i just like watching them do it okay here we go there's a scrap mechanic thing over here

974
02:49:35,059 --> 02:49:39,590
deal with the outlaws right i think i have to kill the everything we'll find out

975
02:49:40,149 --> 02:49:45,370
i wanted to sneak into a secret lab by crawling through the fence like they do in the cereals

976
02:49:45,370 --> 02:49:53,879
i guess not let's go cohort lab that's my signature for falling off a cliff is saying don't

977
02:50:00,309 --> 02:50:13,719
yeah i can sell all these shotguns save it okay i need to do gas on the mother

978
02:50:14,520 --> 02:50:34,229
do i have any do i have gas that's a huge splash damage too are we good

979
02:50:35,110 --> 02:50:43,209
wait that's the last of them okay ma thought it said mother i was like well that's great

980
02:50:45,139 --> 02:50:59,420
all right got tail i did so the way to go down but let me just let me look around well it's not all

981
02:50:59,420 --> 02:51:04,940
about going as fast as possible sometimes you just need to take a minute and pick up everything

982
02:51:05,899 --> 02:51:10,069
and either sell it immediately and not even i probably not even gonna look at it in my inventory

983
02:51:10,069 --> 02:51:12,309
once but it's money

984
02:51:19,579 --> 02:51:25,620
so eliminate the outlaws and then the raptidons and then the data is over there so let's just go

985
02:51:25,620 --> 02:51:52,780
let's do the raptidons first all right well i guess we're doing this first that guy's got a

986
02:51:52,780 --> 02:52:04,969
heavy machine gun burning with the toothpaste nice work what you got can i take that thing

987
02:52:06,090 --> 02:52:19,500
jeweled ring i think he had a heavy weapons gun in parts good all right uh outlaws uh

988
02:52:20,059 --> 02:52:30,500
raptidons this way messages good news and bad news bad news is that we've got a sprat problem

989
02:52:30,500 --> 02:52:35,940
the good news is that my have fastos hammers clobbered your precious rizzo's rangers would

990
02:52:35,940 --> 02:52:42,100
you care for some anti-cleo's trip kale pasta sauce with your humble pie okay you'll need to

991
02:52:42,100 --> 02:52:46,180
sedate them manually bring a few canisters of sedative and hook it up to the auxiliary

992
02:52:46,180 --> 02:52:53,989
terminal in the main research chamber bring a few canisters of sedative and hook it up to the

993
02:52:53,989 --> 02:53:02,569
auxiliary terminal in the main research chamber after don okay i have here a form proving the

994
02:53:02,569 --> 02:53:08,969
relocation of our raptidon mother to the main hall a form signed by you first of all the structural

995
02:53:08,969 --> 02:53:13,610
integrity of our raptidon tanks are not nearly sufficient to contain an enraged raptidon mother

996
02:53:15,639 --> 02:53:19,159
secondly raptidons are notoriously territorial and extremely protective of the young please

997
02:53:19,159 --> 02:53:23,899
stop me if i'm using too many numbers for you seeing how you don't seem to realize that

998
02:53:23,899 --> 02:53:30,979
raptidon mother plus raptidon tank equals murder all right what's this sedative canister

999
02:53:31,700 --> 02:53:36,280
is guaranteed to render even the largest raptidon unconscious been no less than six

1000
02:53:36,280 --> 02:53:48,569
hours and has a refreshing antiseptic scent all right okay there she is so

1001
02:53:50,180 --> 02:54:03,100
where do i put the canister in to knock them all out i guess we'll find it eliminate the outlaws

1002
02:54:04,120 --> 02:54:31,750
wait just shoot it all right turn it on you need three sedative canisters

1003
02:54:35,819 --> 02:54:59,670
run run run what's quick load uh so i need three canisters i get more money if i do it this way

1004
02:55:00,469 --> 02:55:05,110
i've walked by one and i'm never looking at it and going that looks a little odd what's that thing

1005
02:55:11,350 --> 02:55:24,979
damn it can i i'm not sure i can they're inside there's another one okay so that's one two

1006
02:55:25,780 --> 02:55:37,049
i need one more we see one let me know there are two more inside wait inside the actual chamber

1007
02:55:37,770 --> 02:55:49,420
so i just run up can i wait you guys wait here can i tell them to wait i just ran past two of them

1008
02:55:50,139 --> 02:56:04,649
oh i didn't what are you talking about where so i have two one two three

1009
02:56:08,729 --> 02:56:22,149
i would do they actually have one coming back up in here let me see no no no

1010
02:56:25,899 --> 02:56:36,120
that all right easy hey over here oh good you're not shooting at me

1011
02:56:36,120 --> 02:56:43,399
doing fine and safe it's been a bit of a day so i'll get to the point yes i have crane's research

1012
02:56:43,399 --> 02:56:50,059
no i'm not giving it back sorry to disappoint you what are you talking about who the fuck is crane

1013
02:56:50,780 --> 02:56:57,159
i suppose it does not matter either crane sent you or you are some scavenger come to

1014
02:56:57,159 --> 02:57:03,799
rob me in my moment of weakness let's make a deal i'd like to go on living you'd probably like to

1015
02:57:03,799 --> 02:57:07,559
make some money no i'm not out of here and i will pay you for your trouble

1016
02:57:10,170 --> 02:57:20,360
okay uh or i could just shoot you and skip all the hassle make me a deal your life is in my hands

1017
02:57:20,360 --> 02:57:28,040
right now a good turn trust me i'll make it worth your while but that's uh you need to

1018
02:57:30,100 --> 02:57:35,940
my while is worth a lot i am good for my word you will be equitably rewarded on my honor

1019
02:57:36,760 --> 02:57:39,719
but i will not haggle or bargain with you until you help me

1020
02:57:42,579 --> 02:57:47,780
huh well why are you down here the same reason you are more than likely i imagine we picked up

1021
02:57:47,780 --> 02:57:55,379
the same tip secret research facility minimal security i like how that was a lie even though

1022
02:57:55,379 --> 02:58:02,840
you as your character are too dumb to even remember who crane was yeah it could be either way but it

1023
02:58:03,159 --> 02:58:06,440
is if you're just if you're dumb and you don't remember is not remembering a lie

1024
02:58:08,309 --> 02:58:13,930
we've had that conversation on this stream before if i said something i don't remember it did i

1025
02:58:13,930 --> 02:58:21,219
lie about it or was it just too stupid to not to not remember it now i'm not a bandit like you

1026
02:58:22,100 --> 02:58:28,659
oh please i'm not shaking down valuables from hapless travelers i'm stealing corporate secrets

1027
02:58:33,100 --> 02:58:38,299
this is an underground lab off the radar that means their research is secret

1028
02:58:38,700 --> 02:58:45,020
and secrets are always valuable granted diet toothpaste is not exactly what comes to mind

1029
02:58:45,020 --> 02:58:50,780
when i imagine it's too stupid to not remember it so you remembered it no other way do you like

1030
02:58:50,780 --> 02:58:58,219
diet toothpaste can you imagine a more pernicious example of corporate materialism i do not know

1031
02:58:58,219 --> 02:59:05,860
what is worse working here or dying here i've been watching the vod and your tarot rant made

1032
02:59:05,860 --> 02:59:10,500
me really sad can't believe people don't fucking read on the toilet thank you welcome welcome back

1033
02:59:10,500 --> 02:59:15,139
to the stream thank you all right you went through all this trouble to steal a formula

1034
02:59:15,139 --> 02:59:20,659
for diet toothpaste i already know the secret what matters is that i have been lied to i was led to

1035
02:59:20,659 --> 02:59:26,579
believe this was a high priority corporate facility hiding valuable research this job was

1036
02:59:26,579 --> 02:59:32,659
not supposed to end with me stuck in some wretched lab smelling like rats so i would be very much

1037
02:59:32,659 --> 02:59:41,000
obliged if you gave me a break what do you need the first thing i need is a key card to unlock my

1038
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:47,319
door then i'd need you to clear me a path out of here there are two ways out the quickest is

1039
02:59:47,319 --> 02:59:52,680
through the front door but cleo security's bottled up in there if you don't want to shoot them i

1040
02:59:52,680 --> 02:59:58,200
suppose you could talk to them the other way out is through the loading bay but you'd have to clear

1041
02:59:58,200 --> 03:00:08,780
out the wraps for me then i could just slip out the back side unseen kill her and take the recipe

1042
03:00:08,780 --> 03:00:21,020
for diet toothpaste yourself you will be the best dumb space dentist uh and it was a word you might

1043
03:00:21,020 --> 03:00:26,059
have made off of this research even he even called you cretins all right i'm gonna need a good reason

1044
03:00:26,059 --> 03:00:32,459
for the risk my neck because crane is a tool because no good deed goes unrewarded because doing

1045
03:00:32,459 --> 03:00:42,860
me a good turn is the honorable and decent thing take your pick okay um we're going in a circle

1046
03:00:43,899 --> 03:00:47,979
why should i do this for you i am willing to go halves with you halves not good enough

1047
03:00:48,780 --> 03:00:54,540
and i will gladly negotiate with you but only why should i do this for me because of this well what

1048
03:00:54,540 --> 03:00:58,459
do i need to do you need to do this well why should i help you because i'm gonna give you this money

1049
03:00:58,459 --> 03:01:02,780
well that's not good enough what why do i need to do this well because of this well why should i do

1050
03:01:02,780 --> 03:01:08,659
that i'm going around a circle all right let's go you might be the first stroke of luck i've had

1051
03:01:08,659 --> 03:01:17,620
all day whoa whoa wait what i'm in your debt recover the data that's i can't recover i'm this

1052
03:01:17,620 --> 03:01:33,260
is the data uh don't flatter yourself on my honor you will be well rewarded okay sit tight take your

1053
03:01:33,260 --> 03:01:43,430
time i am to my chagrin not going anywhere no you aren't all right so now i have to i have to get

1054
03:01:43,430 --> 03:01:50,309
you out of here so we have to clear the rat okay raptidons clear i need one more of those uh one

1055
03:01:50,309 --> 03:02:02,219
more of those things one more canister i'm gonna do the raptidon way this person friendly i could

1056
03:02:02,219 --> 03:02:16,809
i said i could talk to them okay um i'm supposed to give her the outlaws why are they not attacking

1057
03:02:16,809 --> 03:02:33,530
me now i what because i talked to her carry on i treated new vegas like a joke treating outer

1058
03:02:33,530 --> 03:02:39,850
worlds like a super serious role playing game well i have one rebuttal to you and that is there's no

1059
03:02:39,850 --> 03:02:49,319
console command to spawn easy peets so what do you want me to tell you there is why did you just tell

1060
03:02:49,319 --> 03:02:57,430
me that i played new vegas fairly normally until i spawned a deathclaw and then the whole game was

1061
03:02:57,510 --> 03:03:11,860
ruined like after 12 hours in the game i don't have squad leader how come i can't talk to the

1062
03:03:11,860 --> 03:03:29,020
squad leader i could get that could kill two birds with one stone here eliminate the outlaws

1063
03:03:30,680 --> 03:03:41,719
all right what what seriously what do i what do i care let's go ready guys i've had quite enough

1064
03:03:41,719 --> 03:03:50,170
of you wait i didn't it wasn't my command he just did that on his own

1065
03:03:50,969 --> 03:04:11,139
i've had quite enough no no max max settle down oh shit okay do it do it do it

1066
03:04:14,219 --> 03:04:31,979
this person's getting that person's still playing the arcade machine okay why are they running this

1067
03:04:31,979 --> 03:04:52,020
way holy shit the knees go go get them that's just an upgraded version of you you can do it

1068
03:04:53,700 --> 03:05:24,979
oh no no you can't this is 862 damage on the reload again jeremy what the fuck oh shit okay

1069
03:05:25,700 --> 03:05:56,299
okay bandits currently being eliminated i don't work with bandits i'm sorry i just don't no you're

1070
03:05:56,299 --> 03:06:07,219
literally working one with one right now you don't know that you don't think why i'm not going to

1071
03:06:07,299 --> 03:06:28,309
double cross this person this person's not my best friend print security key card

1072
03:06:29,350 --> 03:06:36,569
key card deployed thank you for using argos i have an escape route release cassandra

1073
03:06:38,819 --> 03:06:55,799
not yet open this too grenade launcher oh boy that's a good one that's considered a long weapon

1074
03:06:55,799 --> 03:07:08,069
isn't it i hope so look at all the stuff that's in here it's actually easier just to tap

callousness okay what should i mistake it for compassion if my colleagues refuse to take their

1217
03:35:02,409 --> 03:35:08,250
lives seriously why should i all they do is complain they refuse to see the opportunity

1299
03:51:00,500 --> 03:51:06,899
jesse and i are not friends i just owe her okay as for the rest i'm trying to figure that out all i

1300
03:51:06,899 --> 03:51:10,979
know is that she's been here too long and she's apparently not receiving visitors

1301
03:51:12,860 --> 03:51:20,729
maybe i can look into it i was a doctor be my guest if you know something i don't about dealing

1302
03:51:20,729 --> 03:51:26,649
with hospital bureaucracy i'll be impressed you talking to the right person you open that door

1303
03:51:27,829 --> 03:51:38,629
hey doctor hey doctor open that door what seems to be the problem i'd like to see jesse doyle

1304
03:51:38,629 --> 03:51:44,309
please if only my other patients had so many inquiring after them i'll tell you what i've

1305
03:51:44,309 --> 03:51:49,930
told the others the records saying miss doyle checked herself in and requested i admit no

1306
03:51:49,930 --> 03:51:59,959
visitors requests of our patients are paramount so no you may not see her the records say you

1307
03:51:59,959 --> 03:52:05,399
actually spoken to her yourself she's not my patient i'm certain no one on my staff would

1308
03:52:05,399 --> 03:52:16,540
falsify patient records if that's what you're implying it is take care yeah have a good day

1309
03:52:16,540 --> 03:52:39,420
doctor fucking loser i go where i want i'm a i'm a stand-up dentist i was gonna stand comedian

1310
03:52:39,420 --> 03:52:47,190
whatever is a doctor really smoking inside of a hospital are you fucking kidding me

1311
03:52:47,909 --> 03:52:55,860
dentist wouldn't do that guarantee it oh i've learned that interstellar crew is called the

1312
03:52:55,860 --> 03:53:11,850
condition skip flu and everyone ah yep somebody screenshot that all right where are they pick up

1313
03:53:11,850 --> 03:53:19,290
marted id cartridge you found an id cartridge used with the holographic shroud you will now

1314
03:53:19,290 --> 03:53:25,399
be automatically disguised entering the associated restricted area that was very very simple i guess

1315
03:53:26,040 --> 03:53:32,299
i'm now your holographic shroud is activated giving you temporary access to this restricted

1316
03:53:32,299 --> 03:53:38,139
area moving drains the shroud's energy when it runs out personnel will see and interrogate you

1317
03:53:38,139 --> 03:53:42,299
talk your way out of the interrogation to reset your shroud it'll get harder to talk your way out

1318
03:53:42,299 --> 03:53:50,489
the more you're interrogated what looking sharp why do you look like you're about to

1319
03:53:50,489 --> 03:54:03,799
fucking take a swing at me okay so i'm pretending to be a doctor we're looking for jesse all right

the board a significant sum alas the only collateral she has is her organs compulsory

1347
04:00:25,459 --> 04:00:35,299
donation is quite legal in such cases can't she work for you until she earns back what she owes

1348
04:00:37,319 --> 04:00:44,950
i believe the captain is proposing an indenture contract i didn't say nothing about her teeth i

1349
04:00:44,950 --> 04:00:50,520
would know he's got to be worth more than alive than dead you should know that dentist that's

1350
04:00:50,520 --> 04:00:55,079
not unreasonable what guarantee do i have that she'll agree to the terms you negotiate

1351
04:00:56,950 --> 04:01:02,469
she's hiding in sickbay to avoid assassins i'm sure sir prefer work doesn't have a choice doesn't

1352
04:01:02,469 --> 04:01:09,190
show up for work kill her like you planned on in the first place hmm i'm not sure the price

1353
04:01:09,190 --> 04:01:15,110
of her organs will allow a profit in that case i expect her liver is uh used goods as it were

1354

04:05:13,909 --> 04:05:21,190

1382
04:05:21,190 --> 04:05:22,309
this is a dentist

1383
04:05:30,069 --> 04:05:34,469
junley tennyson i'm captain around here but chief to my friends hope you don't mind the

1384
04:05:34,469 --> 04:05:41,590
formal introduction groundbreaker doesn't see many visitors uh junko nice place you got here i'm

1385
04:05:41,590 --> 04:05:48,389
captain of the unreliable recently unshackled from groundbreaker's impound good for you hope

1386
04:05:48,389 --> 04:05:52,790
you scared some sense into those bureaucrats giving you trouble just so we understand each

1387
04:05:52,790 --> 04:05:58,229
other i'm the final word on the ship the mardits the crew the engineers their family i hope there

1388
04:05:58,229 --> 04:06:08,170
won't be any problems while you're visiting i'll do whatever i can to help don't go making trouble

1389
04:06:08,170 --> 04:06:13,450
and chances are you won't find any that's how i like it here so what brings you to groundbreaker

1390
04:06:13,450 --> 04:06:16,889
i'm curious even though nine times up to ten the answers just passing through

1391
04:06:16,969 --> 04:06:27,700
um statistics don't lie we see a lot of the same faces coming and going most of them board spies

1392
04:06:29,059 --> 04:06:36,649
makes it hard to trust outsiders you seem different so welcome aboard uh you don't have a

1393
04:06:36,649 --> 04:06:40,329
lot of faith in the board what's it like being in command it seems kind of warm in here you don't

1394
04:06:40,329 --> 04:06:45,850
have a lot of faith in the board you're right i don't the board is after two things bits and power

1395
04:06:45,850 --> 04:06:52,360
and they only get it by sticking their nose where it doesn't belong you must not like bedford very

1396
04:06:52,360 --> 04:06:57,639
much i like to think of myself as a nice person but if that gaudy embassy of his was on fire

1397
04:06:57,639 --> 04:07:02,920
i might hold my breath a moment before activating the sprinkler system the board wants control of a

1398
04:07:02,920 --> 04:07:07,959
groundbreaker and leeches like udon bedford will do anything to please their corporate masters

1399
04:07:10,540 --> 04:07:15,590
uh how do you keep the board at a safe distance when i have something to offer but i can also be a

1400
04:07:15,590 --> 04:07:20,629
real hard ass it'd be a joy if i could kick out the corporate merchants and reclaim the docking

1401
04:07:20,709 --> 04:07:25,430
fees in my lifetime too much of groundbreaker's income is flowing in the wrong direction

1402
04:07:25,989 --> 04:07:31,670
i'd like to see that change okay you've got my attention well what do i what do you want

1403
04:07:32,469 --> 04:07:37,959
what's it like being in command frustrating everything down to the circuit boards has

1404
04:07:37,959 --> 04:07:42,920
passed warranty so i have the pleasure of making life or death decisions on a shoestring budget

1405
04:07:43,959 --> 04:07:48,440
plus there's no time to train my successor or document fixes in a way that anyone outside the

1406
04:07:48,440 --> 04:07:54,920
family would understand okay who has a family business sure is the tennyson's came over on

1407
04:07:54,920 --> 04:07:59,879
the groundbreaker my grandmother chief gang kept it together during the crossing and until she died

1408
04:08:00,600 --> 04:08:07,079
and my grandfather ben only recently when my mom died then i took the leap from chief engineer to

1409
04:08:07,079 --> 04:08:11,639
captain he left behind a really weird watch and we didn't know what to do with we brought it to

1410
04:08:11,639 --> 04:08:17,639
antiques roadshow and they said it was 44 dollars so we sold it we didn't know what it was it was

1411
04:08:17,639 --> 04:08:23,940
in a shoebox upstairs it was different knowing that i couldn't turn to anyone who could answer

1412
04:08:23,940 --> 04:08:29,459
the tough questions for me maybe you can see why i'm protective of groundbreaker this ship is

1413
04:08:29,459 --> 04:08:36,739
family it's got tinkerings and bypasses that only tennyson's know about ways to self-destruct

1414
04:08:36,739 --> 04:08:42,100
i hope that was a joke captain i really do i gelded that thing years ago it wasn't now it

1415
04:08:42,100 --> 04:08:45,540
bruises it wasn't where is it stronger than nan or spank where's the exploding button

1416
04:08:45,540 --> 04:08:51,559
recipe aren't you a little young you see any bite-sized tennyson children running around

1417
04:08:51,559 --> 04:08:57,319
i didn't think so the next captain won't have my heritage i'll have to foster that talent from

1418
04:08:57,319 --> 04:09:06,979
somewhere it's only a question of when okay you've got my attention seems mormon here's radiators

1419
04:09:06,979 --> 04:09:13,620
need replacement parts yep here's this and there we go here it is here's the here it is

1420
04:09:13,620 --> 04:09:23,819
is only the board has access to new parts go install ac into the window sure thing they want

1421
04:09:23,819 --> 04:09:29,340
us to sweat thinking that'll soften me up for a bad faith deal if you'll excuse me they can go

1422
04:09:29,340 --> 04:09:34,940
fuck themselves the board isn't helping and my resources are spread thin if i don't get those

1423
04:09:34,940 --> 04:09:43,420
radiators back online groundbreaker everyone on board will be cooked alive you need a contractor

1424
04:09:43,420 --> 04:09:49,340
there i could where i could do this easily reasonable huh that's the best news i've heard

1425
04:09:49,340 --> 04:09:53,659
all day according to my grandmother's old schematics the parts we need should be in the

1426
04:09:53,659 --> 04:10:03,639
back bays uh what the hell is that sorry i forgot not everyone knows this ship like i do

1427
04:10:04,440 --> 04:10:08,760
the back bays are on a lower deck long abandoned and a haven for miscreants now

1428
04:10:13,430 --> 04:10:18,920
if you tried sending anyone else down there i'll get those parts good once you've obtained the

1429
04:10:18,920 --> 04:10:28,180
parts we can proceed to the next phase of repairs okay whatever i'm not doing it for free

1434
04:11:34,760 --> 04:11:49,459

1435
04:11:49,459 --> 04:11:56,020

plan no i say greatness is in everyone not just those so fortunate as to have been born into

1649
04:52:02,299 --> 04:52:12,630
prosperity that was unexpected it's a long way to say you don't have the key all right uh that

1650
04:52:12,630 --> 04:52:17,830
was something like a bunch of nonsense i am inclined to agree with your assessment by which

1651
04:52:17,830 --> 04:52:30,680
i mean i have been systemically programmed to do so okay goodbye cool let's go all right who's

1656
04:54:06,900 --> 04:54:23,509
because that is hitting me all germs and contaminants have been neutralized

1657
04:54:23,509 --> 04:54:29,909

04:55:50,229 --> 04:55:56,380
any other way to go besides the front door that i'm going not really i don't think i can sneak by

1663
04:55:56,380 --> 04:56:23,209
this i have to go for it i smite you in the name of the law well they're instantly dead

1666
04:57:13,369 --> 04:57:19,430

1667
04:57:19,509 --> 04:57:27,319
i gotta wrap all the way around no we're going for it all right let's go let's do it i know we

04:57:27,319 --> 04:57:44,650
can do it what do i got just do drugs yeah i'm gonna do drugs okay this is uh movement speed

1669
04:57:45,369 --> 04:57:55,669
so let's do instead of health let's see tactical time recharge rate 50 and then

1670
04:57:56,630 --> 04:58:09,689
super like i don't know whatever i have range weapon sway range weapon spread

04:58:29,720 --> 04:58:41,639
this lasts 25 seconds though companion ability cooldown range weapon spread i feel like this is

1674
04:58:41,639 --> 04:58:54,939

warehouse and spend the rest of their stay getting rowdy over tossball games they usually loiter in

shoot the barrel i did all right we got her let's go we have to go to uh sand jar

1760
05:18:01,580 --> 05:18:20,680
bright idea editorial automag with a flamethrower this unit will i'm here could i get another advance

1761
05:18:20,680 --> 05:18:29,500
mr nandi just make sure it's properly logged um well new business turns up at last

1762
05:18:30,700 --> 05:18:36,060
celia didn't i tell you our new statistics-based advertising model would be a hit

1763
05:18:36,220 --> 05:18:43,900
it that you did sir how can yield improvements of 26.7 percent not quicken the pulse

1764
05:18:43,900 --> 05:18:52,779
it's not that much 32 cost savings not voice in the loins you've often posed these very questions

1765
05:18:53,740 --> 05:19:07,909
clear my schedule this newcomer has a meeting with me i gotta say great teeth uh but you have a

1766
05:19:07,909 --> 05:19:15,099
meeting with me to hear that power play celia we don't make them like this anymore in halcyon

1767
05:19:15,979 --> 05:19:25,220
i only hope you don't judge me by my handshake now what business brings you here me chart my

1768
05:19:25,220 --> 05:19:29,860
own path going where the wind takes me i'm just looking for the information broker it's all i

1769
05:19:29,860 --> 05:19:36,259
care about why he's probably still out at devil's peak not that he's had the courtesy to notify me

1770
05:19:36,259 --> 05:19:43,000
at any rate but if you're here for him i suppose that means you aren't here for salt tuna

1771
05:19:44,900 --> 05:19:49,380
they could always be both if i have to eat one more weird science project past office food in

1772
05:19:49,380 --> 05:19:58,569
this sprat fucked colony i'm gonna stab someone it could be both now now there's no need to humor me

1773
05:19:58,569 --> 05:20:05,209
i'm used to this particular letdown i had hoped that livening up our advertisements with enticing

1774
05:20:05,209 --> 05:20:12,569
figures would draw the other corporations back to our bosom but it seems we're back to the drawing

1775
05:20:12,569 --> 05:20:20,250
board uh if you're free of the other corporations why would you want to bring them back surviving

1776
05:20:20,250 --> 05:20:26,729
alone isn't as easy as it looks thanks to the so-called hazard clause monarch has been cut off

1777
05:20:26,729 --> 05:20:32,490
from the board's resources and protection for 10 years now we've kept ourselves in business by

1778
05:20:32,490 --> 05:20:38,090
trading with individual corporations but given the off the books nature of those transactions

1779
05:20:38,090 --> 05:20:47,770
such arrangements are precarious and you're tired of scrounging and scraping by is that it

1780
05:20:47,770 --> 05:20:55,700
freedom is a tempting ideal but a rather costly paramour exactly intellectualism fuels the train

1781
05:20:55,700 --> 05:21:02,979
to mankind's future but the tracks the train runs on are forged from practicality yes it's as though

1782
05:21:02,979 --> 05:21:09,779
the good vicar has plucked the very words from my brain so now we're in right so we're gonna we're

1783
05:21:09,779 --> 05:21:16,939
in so what do you want to do well mr nandi here has a rather ingenious plan to get msi restored

1784
05:21:16,939 --> 05:21:23,099
to the board on our terms mind you returning to the board is your only chance if you hope to

1785
05:21:23,099 --> 05:21:30,700
survive here on monarch that doesn't mean it'll be easily achievable indeed not no worthwhile plan

1786
05:21:30,700 --> 05:21:36,700
was ever simple that's what i always say and if our advertising scheme hasn't borne fruit

1787
05:21:36,700 --> 05:21:44,840
then perhaps it's time we took matters into our own hands this lady knows what's up it's true

1788
05:21:44,840 --> 05:21:50,279
our celia is an alarmingly competent middle manager at any other company she'd be wasted

1789
05:21:50,279 --> 05:21:55,159
in data entry the plan she refers to is a two-pronged approach dentist and all the

1790
05:21:56,040 --> 05:22:03,639
you stellar bay properly defended only we have to have other things besides dentist

1791
05:22:03,639 --> 05:22:07,720
references to every piece of dialogue i've got to come up with other things to say

1792
05:22:10,950 --> 05:22:16,549
with a bolt 52 cartridge of course if you can get us what we need to rejoin the board starting

1793
05:22:16,549 --> 05:22:22,229
the bolt 52 we'll be able to become one of the most productive and secure cities in halcyon

1794
05:22:22,790 --> 05:22:29,979
and you'll have a powerful ally on the board farmers only dot what is that

1795
05:22:30,860 --> 05:22:39,900
i think i wait is this bolt sounds useful why one of the strongest defenses in halcyon

1796
05:22:39,900 --> 05:22:48,740
that's the farmer dating website all right where do i get a bolt in the old arms building southwest

1797
05:22:48,740 --> 05:22:54,659
of town which used to be part of stellar bay before we had to move our walls in these days

1798
05:22:55,220 --> 05:23:02,549
overrun with marauders and raptidons oh why you saying saying what which way

1799
05:23:04,310 --> 05:23:09,110
arms you're saying arms instead of arms that's just what it's called it's supposed to stand for

1800
05:23:09,110 --> 05:23:15,259
something but i forget what why am i such a weirdo why do i care about some of these things

1801
05:23:16,060 --> 05:23:27,770
i'll see what i can do good enough i know when to settle oh and while you're at it there should

1802
05:23:27,770 --> 05:23:33,369
be a terminal in the arms building with some dangerous information perhaps you could delete

1803
05:23:33,369 --> 05:23:45,939
it so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands you want me to wipe your hard drive all right

1804
05:23:45,939 --> 05:23:56,220
what do we got i want to wait family man okay here we go i still need to do this a fine day

1805
05:23:56,220 --> 05:24:03,669
for business isn't it anyway what can i do for you isaac rose is dead i found the people who

1806
05:24:03,669 --> 05:24:11,509
killed him but that's terrible what happened i've taken care of it killers are dead but that means

1807
05:24:11,509 --> 05:24:16,630
we won't be able to log their testimonies if there's one thing i've been hoping to

1808
05:24:16,630 --> 05:24:20,950
reestablish in stellar bay it's proper documentation for legal matters

1809
05:24:23,560 --> 05:24:26,360
uh sometimes you take matters into your own hands maybe i could have gotten their

1810
05:24:26,360 --> 05:24:31,080
statements if they hadn't been ready to kill me always a shame when tempers get the better of

1811
05:24:31,080 --> 05:24:38,040
good sense still your intervention in the matter is much appreciated please consider this payment

1812
05:24:38,040 --> 05:24:57,619
for your services okay goodbye let me take a look 40 is tinkering costs minus 50 that's pretty

1813
05:24:57,619 --> 05:25:21,000
amazing these guys seem a lot less evil i don't know about that maybe no weapons sway for five

1814
05:25:21,000 --> 05:25:27,720
seconds after each kill that's pretty good ah what should i do though i think i'm just gonna

1815
05:25:27,720 --> 05:25:46,869
put it into medical yeah but here's the thing about lying i have 70 lie right now

1816
05:25:48,020 --> 05:25:57,419
nothing that i've done in the game so far has required more than 40 or 50 yeah this is dentistry

1817
05:25:57,419 --> 05:26:11,720
there we go 40 breakdown weapons and armor for 20 chance to attract a basic mod yeah let's just

1818
05:26:11,720 --> 05:26:23,639
we'll get that up to 40 i will get to 100 live eventually don't worry you're gonna stack it for

1819
05:26:23,639 --> 05:26:31,900
the end game oh i will don't worry we'll get it so there was something else i need to do family

1820
05:26:31,900 --> 05:26:38,889
matter look for tucker right i'm gonna do that and then radio free oh shit we're still on

1821
05:26:39,930 --> 05:26:47,900
faction quest we're still we haven't even done the main thing yet what is this kid all right

1822
05:26:47,900 --> 05:26:57,639
we're gonna go find this kid this is the simple truth we are all molecular machines the body is

1823
05:26:57,639 --> 05:27:08,939
a collection of atoms the mind is the consequence of so here's the deal i'll tell you

1824
05:27:09,580 --> 05:27:19,450
you ready for the deal hold on to your hat we're going to play this tomorrow not done yet

1825
05:27:20,729 --> 05:27:28,299
but we're gonna play tomorrow and at the end of tomorrow's stream we're going to see if this is

1826
05:27:28,299 --> 05:27:34,180
something that i'm going to continue playing on stream tomorrow is thanksgiving that's correct

1827
05:27:37,080 --> 05:27:50,040
all right hold on 368 do i have any fast travels no so because it's thanksgiving tomorrow

1828
05:27:51,779 --> 05:28:08,950
i probably am gonna start streaming a little bit later than usual so tomorrow will probably be a

1829
05:28:08,950 --> 05:28:16,790
later stream instead of starting at like one or two we'll probably start not that much later

1830
05:28:16,790 --> 05:28:25,099
but just late enough where if everyone had things to do it'll be a later night stream

1831
05:28:25,819 --> 05:28:37,060
probably around like four pm pacific then it'll be about seven eastern and we can just chill

1832
05:28:37,779 --> 05:28:45,619
because it is fun just to kind of play a game even though you know i'm playing it

1833
05:28:46,340 --> 05:28:59,560
strangely i'm still enjoying it at least for now now here's the real question am i going to die

1834
05:28:59,560 --> 05:29:06,549
by attacking these hooligans no i won't even need to attack them because i can just run this way

1835
05:29:16,040 --> 05:29:19,240

2041
06:07:31,659 --> 06:07:36,139
it's not effective it's the best weapon i have though it does more damage than anything else

2042
06:07:36,139 --> 06:07:46,470
i have against everything until i get something better that's gonna have to stick all right i can

2043
06:07:46,470 --> 06:08:01,540
go up left i hope i can go through here what scientist look i didn't mean what i said about

2044
06:08:01,540 --> 06:08:22,659

oh well too bad can't save everybody that is the tagline okay so i need to go around

2046
06:08:42,389 --> 06:08:57,189
and then it looks like there's a door or something i can go through hopefully this opens unseal the

2047
06:08:57,189 --> 06:09:04,490
door that was easy that was incredibly easy thought it was gonna be much harder than that

2048
06:09:05,290 --> 06:09:40,169
okay who's left shit come on that guy has a fucking flamethrower

2049
06:09:45,880 --> 06:09:56,389
what the fuck well it's not as easy as i thought this was gonna be

2050
06:10:04,169 --> 06:10:31,319
maybe i can just sneak by this i'm gonna go for it i'm not fucking around

2051
06:10:36,299 --> 06:10:52,229

2053
06:11:21,419 --> 06:11:31,540
i actually can't go this way to the left and then i get no i guess should be able to wait a minute

2054
06:11:34,650 --> 06:11:49,349
shouldn't i be able to run this way and then around oh god i'm in here i'm not in here i'm

2056
06:12:31,099 --> 06:12:44,470

2057
06:12:44,470 --> 06:12:54,229
get in there through here wait wasn't i what i'm so confused because i went through this door

2058
06:12:54,229 --> 06:13:20,040
wait a minute go through this door okay so i'm still here now i'm still this is incorrect

2059

2088
06:21:06,659 --> 06:21:12,020
here in the wilderness anyhow you might stop in on an old friend of mine preferably before we get

2089
06:21:12,020 --> 06:21:18,580
to hyrum's it's on the way don't want you don't seem the type to run off and get yourself killed

2090
06:21:18,580 --> 06:21:28,939
and i could use the help get on with it hey it ain't easy for me to spill my guts like a cut up

2091
06:21:29,259 --> 06:21:35,419
all right i'll be up front with you i hate asking for help i hate it every time i give someone the

2092
06:21:35,419 --> 06:21:42,060
opportunity to disappoint me they seem to make it their most immediate goal but this what i'm

2093
06:21:42,060 --> 06:21:52,340
thinking it's dangerous uh what do we do let's do it here i was stealing myself for inevitable

2094
06:21:52,340 --> 06:21:59,299
rejection i used to run with a band of hunters friends six of us we were on monarch when the

2095
06:21:59,299 --> 06:22:04,500
corporations pulled out and we helped a lot of people pick up the pieces i haven't seen two of

2096
06:22:04,500 --> 06:22:09,139
them in years those pills were off are you gonna be drunk again i'd like to gather their effects

2097
06:22:09,139 --> 06:22:16,680
and bury them all in the same places with the family we once were how do you know that they're

2098
06:22:16,680 --> 06:22:23,700
dead i saw it happen hell one of them was in my arms at the time his name was haze and he's our

2099
06:22:23,700 --> 06:22:30,659
first stop i buried him a ways from our encampment i'll show you where he rests he had a medallion in

2100
06:22:30,659 --> 06:22:38,729
his effects that's what i'll bring home to bury all right a long time ago we built an encampment

2101
06:22:38,729 --> 06:22:43,849
in one of monarch's cave systems trouble is a mannequin showed up and kicked us all out

2102
06:22:44,970 --> 06:22:49,290
if we can find rebecca and anders they'll know how to lure her out then i don't want to find

2103
06:22:49,290 --> 06:23:10,020
anybody and bury everyone's medallions together all right let's let's go sounds like plan it's

2104
06:23:10,020 --> 06:23:32,380
down there all right let's move go nice swing almost all right do your special move

2105
06:23:39,270 --> 06:23:43,669
okay that's that's a pretty that's a pretty great special move what's your special move

2106
06:23:44,549 --> 06:24:13,540
the thing blocking your head keep going keep going keep going keep going all the way all the

2107
06:24:13,540 --> 06:24:22,729
way all the way no you might consider stopping the stream

2108
06:24:24,119 --> 06:25:15,659
hmm i considered it and i said no get this thing away from me i think you got it see you have like

2109
06:25:15,659 --> 06:25:31,189
a thing blocking your head ammo i remember how bad i was at keeping ammo i don't know how good i got

2110
06:25:31,189 --> 06:25:44,759
at the game look northwest that ain't it i'm camp inside the building there oh they're clear unless

2111
06:25:44,759 --> 06:25:50,279
you're fancy getting shot westbound still i'll let you know when we can start ascending okay

2112
06:25:51,240 --> 06:26:09,930
can we start now is this game good yeah i don't know yeah i don't know though maybe

2113
06:26:10,810 --> 06:26:37,740
all right this is tough yeah i mean it is i can't okay let me let me give you a little bit of an

2114
06:26:37,740 --> 06:26:48,459
example here i can't say i don't want to play this anymore but at the same time i can't tell you why

2115
06:26:48,459 --> 06:26:57,130
i am still playing you know i'm saying it's in that perfect spot of being just enjoyable enough

2116
06:26:58,250 --> 06:27:12,630
where i'm not going to turn it off i like the scenarios i like the i like the choices in the

2117
06:27:12,630 --> 06:27:32,380
scenarios and the easy to kill npcs that sounds fucked up but it's true it's good it's good

2118
06:27:32,380 --> 06:27:40,119
it's good and here's the thing i think that's all right you know what i mean i don't think it has to

2119
06:27:40,119 --> 06:27:54,009
be a fucking in perfect incredible video it's just it's good it's good sometimes what you're

2120
06:27:54,009 --> 06:28:09,770
all you're looking for is just something that's a good game now again i don't know how long this

2121
06:28:09,849 --> 06:28:25,349
game actually is but i feel like there's still a lot for me to do i'm assuming that did you

2122
06:28:25,349 --> 06:28:29,189
show you how many planets there were there's probably a bunch of stuff to do on every one

2123
06:28:29,189 --> 06:28:38,259
of those planets if you're just looking for a game with stuff to do in it this is for you

2124
06:28:46,180 --> 06:28:57,560
you're almost done what are you talking about how can it be almost done

2125
06:29:01,939 --> 06:29:19,060
oh we have to be careful all right here we go story is short oh well whatever all right get in there

2126
06:29:33,340 --> 06:29:51,020
run dead yeah somebody mentioned this it's almost like it's the halfway point

2127
06:29:51,740 --> 06:30:05,259
between borderlands and fallout but not more than halfway it's like they half developed borderlands

2128
06:30:05,259 --> 06:30:21,849
and half developed fallout buried near the surface of hayes grave is a small lock box its hinges

2129
06:30:21,849 --> 06:30:25,529
rusted through and it's wood almost completely rotted it nearly falls apart in your hands

2130
06:30:26,970 --> 06:30:37,639
and medallion bearing the letters sharon all right we got it but long story short

2131
06:30:40,139 --> 06:30:45,240
i think it's good i would say you'd probably like it if you played it was the best self-sacrificing

2132
06:30:45,240 --> 06:30:49,959
son of a saint i ever met maybe you wouldn't i don't know you've been watching it's up to you

2133
06:30:49,959 --> 06:30:54,119
now if we're gonna lure the manta queen out we'll need to find rebecca and danders

2134
06:30:54,119 --> 06:30:59,720
they took a udl contract on tera too we never heard from them again i think it's time i call

2135
06:30:59,720 --> 06:31:11,580
in a favor with hyrum if anyone can track them down it's him uh all right let's go we're almost

2136
06:31:11,580 --> 06:31:26,069
here it's way less action yeah it's good not better than good but good yes what do i feel

2137
06:31:26,069 --> 06:31:48,069
about the game no you guys already know how i feel about the game six out of ten

2138
06:31:48,069 --> 06:32:11,290
uh i think that's low i do not bad huh oh shit it's the bugs i know how to deal with the bugs

2139
06:32:11,849 --> 06:32:46,259
am i just missing over and over again this guy's juking me so hard oh good you're alive let's go

2140
06:32:46,259 --> 06:32:56,180
this way all right we need to start ascending germa can't formulate an opinion without seeing

2141
06:32:56,819 --> 06:33:08,200
reddit has to say first that's not even true what the fuck all right let's get in here

2142
06:33:14,520 --> 06:33:18,200
no i haven't formulated a full opinion because i'm playing halfway through the game

2143
06:33:21,349 --> 06:33:38,419
i have a slight opinion but i'm not done this fucking redditor over here oh shit you're

2144
06:33:38,740 --> 06:33:49,779
okay i thought that was a bandit

2145
06:34:01,189 --> 06:34:12,919
uh oh we pray at night we stop at night best character you want to try to tell me that you

2146
06:34:12,919 --> 06:34:20,360
don't think that's a good character now okay why there's too many of these queens

2147
06:34:21,080 --> 06:34:34,979
this is death if i try to fight these things oh fuck i didn't know you were there just it's all

2148
06:34:34,979 --> 06:34:42,580
of them oh man we have to fight it we have to fight we have to fight it we have to fight it we

2149
06:34:42,580 --> 06:35:40,389
have to die there's so many people ow the shock good on you i said it does more damage it does

2150
06:35:40,389 --> 06:35:48,360
more damage it does more damage just run and there's bugs and shit flying ants whatever the

2151
06:35:48,360 --> 06:36:34,860
hell they are all right super gun there should have been the head are you healing why won't you

2152
06:36:34,860 --> 06:37:02,790
just die fuck die after too many encounters with manta paulers and minusors you're not quite

2153
06:37:02,790 --> 06:37:11,180
yourself when any of the manta family of creatures are attacking you dexterity minus one minus one

2154
06:37:11,180 --> 06:37:17,750
minus one when you're surrounded by them that's worth it i don't care i'm scared of giant monsters

2155
06:37:17,750 --> 06:37:25,099
wow that's so strange how odd to be terrified of something that's five times bigger than you and

2156
06:37:25,099 --> 06:37:57,020
has claws like a lobster okay i get a free perk uh max meter maybe the armor rating walk speed

2157
06:38:00,419 --> 06:38:14,180
ultra beater what are you talking about what does that mean movement penalty accuracy uh walk speed

2158
06:38:15,220 --> 06:38:35,540
is good in combat i'll take it you're right my fucking god this sucks how much damage

2159
06:38:35,939 --> 06:38:46,220
okay what do i have for weapons this is like fire fire normal normal do i have anything else

2160
06:38:46,220 --> 06:39:00,810
what about this but like what about shock let me try like electric shock damage well that's

2161
06:39:00,810 --> 06:39:29,380
awful four and they're already dead they're both dead this is wonderful all i have is fire weapons

2162
06:39:29,380 --> 06:39:49,419
versus fire type is there a water type no don't run away and get all your energy back oh that's

2163
06:39:49,419 --> 06:39:59,349
so i'm clearly behind you i'm not gonna run away from me

2164
06:40:05,110 --> 06:40:23,849

2201
06:50:56,630 --> 06:51:01,750

2229
06:59:14,950 --> 06:59:31,860
thought there wasn't gonna be anybody in here what happened to shaving streams this week

2230
06:59:32,580 --> 06:59:40,009
uh i really made mainly meant yesterday and tomorrow tomorrow is gonna be uh probably like

2231
06:59:40,009 --> 07:00:01,349
four or five hours yesterday was like four and a half so open the door hello never thought i'd

2232
07:00:01,349 --> 07:00:06,950
be ecstatic at having the walls painted in blood but seeing as it's not mine i'd say this calls

2233
07:00:06,950 --> 07:00:13,669
for a celebration this ought to square our debt one hefty payment for a highly valued service

2234
07:00:14,310 --> 07:00:21,270
but i admit i do wonder why neoka has brought you to me allow me to pose my question in another

2235
07:00:21,270 --> 07:00:35,209
manner why in the nebula are you here um you know why i'm here can we continue our conversations

2236
07:00:35,209 --> 07:00:41,290
from the intercom if you insist as i was telling you before i am the premier broker for all of

2237
07:00:41,290 --> 07:00:47,049
monarch phineas must have sent you he's the only one insane enough to send someone to monarch to

2238
07:00:47,049 --> 07:00:54,009
rush me i knew it was only a matter of time before he came a knocking look might be late

2239
07:00:54,009 --> 07:01:01,479
but i fulfill my contracts always oh you do do you i have lost track of the number of beers you

2240
07:01:01,479 --> 07:01:07,799
owe me for chasing raptidons off your stoop careful i know that line i use it all the time

2241
07:01:08,840 --> 07:01:18,389
i take offense to that look okay just it might take me a while this time i don't care caring or

2242
07:01:18,549 --> 07:01:23,299
not won't change the facts of the matter i am awaiting but a single incoming transmission

2243
07:01:23,299 --> 07:01:28,900
containing the information we desire but msi and the iconoclasts are clogging the airwaves

2244
07:01:28,900 --> 07:01:32,900
from stellar bay and amber heights and they're screaming voice yeah they're scrambling each

2245
07:01:32,900 --> 07:01:41,770
other's once this is completed i'm taking off this is a problem okay so we kick them off get

2246
07:01:41,770 --> 07:01:45,770
them out of here exactly what i was thinking wait they hurt us all with their pettiness who is he

2247
07:01:45,770 --> 07:01:49,849
talking about of course has inadvertently affected the incoming port and my livelihood

2248
07:01:55,720 --> 07:02:00,840
where in stellar bay my former partner sanjar transmits from his office in msi's headquarters

2249
07:02:00,840 --> 07:02:07,080
in the center of town don't let him try to fool you while his messages might seem like gibberish

2250
07:02:07,080 --> 07:02:13,400
they are in reality coded business orders to off-world companies i understand why he needs

2251
07:02:13,400 --> 07:02:20,279
the bandwidth but we had a deal and he's broadcasting ceaselessly i kind of like that guy though

2252
07:02:24,979 --> 07:02:28,500
no they're jamming the limited frequencies we have at our disposal

2253
07:02:28,500 --> 07:02:32,500
nothing extra planetary can get in or out until the frequency pollution thins out

2254
07:02:33,299 --> 07:02:38,580
the safest thing is to convince graham and sanjar to start transmitting on their end

2255
07:02:40,340 --> 07:02:48,709
i could just kill them all i'll talk some sense to that i'll be here waiting on the receiving end

2256
07:02:49,590 --> 07:02:54,389
luck be with you i have a feeling you'll be needing a pinch of it plus a vat of patience

2257
07:02:56,419 --> 07:03:00,819
uh we need a favor oh great i love doing pro bono work for friends

2258
07:03:01,700 --> 07:03:08,419
oh you called us friends i'd normally entertain yourself aggrandizing delusions but this time

2259
07:03:08,419 --> 07:03:14,979
it's important important to you is not the same as important to me although i do recognize that you

2260
07:03:15,700 --> 07:03:19,860
may have earned some goodwill this guy's boring the fuck out of me once laboring for me

2261
07:03:19,860 --> 07:03:29,779
me whoa hey there is zero yeah just do it now hurry up look i'll do what i can all right

2262
07:03:30,419 --> 07:03:35,799
rebecca hodges and anders watsworth they took a udl contract back when monarch went to shit

2263
07:03:35,799 --> 07:03:42,200
and i need to find them i believed them to be on terra too if udl hired two hunters back then

2264
07:03:42,200 --> 07:03:45,959
it would have been for creature clearing purposes round one of their spacers choice outposts

2265
07:03:47,000 --> 07:03:51,080
these are the coordinates for the outpost under the last udl contract now scram

2266
07:03:51,959 --> 07:04:00,180
and uh good luck say scram all right goodbye neoka pick me up some stimuli lotion and a bottle of

2267
07:04:00,180 --> 07:04:09,639
purple berry wine when you're next in stellar bay all right so whatever he said i don't know

2268
07:04:09,639 --> 07:04:27,130
whatever it was uh we'll find out tomorrow i'll take all this stuff that's a flamethrower okay

2269
07:04:28,169 --> 07:04:36,020
uh so we're gonna continue tomorrow and we will see if the stream tomorrow is going to continue

2270
07:04:37,619 --> 07:04:46,680
i might be able just to beat it tomorrow it's possible if i'm like halfway more than halfway

2271
07:04:46,680 --> 07:04:51,689
through the game it's possible but i'm probably i'm probably gonna be streaming for about four or

2272
07:04:51,689 --> 07:05:07,130
five hours maybe we'll see i'm probably not even close because i streamed this yesterday for like

2273
07:05:07,130 --> 07:05:10,090
four and a half hours and i'm probably only gonna stream tomorrow for like four or five hours

2274
07:05:10,970 --> 07:05:21,849
this is the one in the middle like today yeah uh yeah i was gonna stop like a couple hours ago

2275
07:05:21,849 --> 07:05:42,150
but i was getting into it i'm just getting kind of tired you're into the dentist cosplay

2276
07:05:44,310 --> 07:05:49,110
yeah we'll see if i continue it at least some of the because i really probably should just put on

2277
07:05:49,110 --> 07:05:55,349
like a real armor we'll see all right but that's uh that's it for today thanks for watching guys

2278
07:05:55,349 --> 07:06:07,750
we'll see you tomorrow and we'll see what happens at the end of that stream any news on the green

2279
07:06:07,750 --> 07:06:14,200
screen yeah the discord channel is open there's a discord channel talked about yesterday i think

2280
07:06:15,259 --> 07:06:22,569
uh for suggestions and actions that stream is going to happen somewhere probably december 10th

2281
07:06:22,569 --> 07:06:31,319
11th maybe 12th please put your favorite actions there and discuss them if i do not see tomorrow

2282
07:06:31,319 --> 07:06:36,259
happy thanksgiving those of you that celebrate it and if uh by the way stream is probably going

2283
07:06:36,259 --> 07:06:44,779
to start a little bit later just to kind of stream after most people do their thanksgiving

2284
07:06:44,779 --> 07:06:55,060
festivities so the stream tomorrow will be about 4 pm pacific channel is not open is it not well

2285
07:06:55,060 --> 07:07:06,060
it will be it will be very soon like within the next hour probably oh god all right there we go

2286
07:07:06,700 --> 07:07:14,470
jacket's on the case but yeah uh i will see you guys tomorrow we'll keep going let me just do a

2287
07:07:14,470 --> 07:07:23,740
hard save just in case and we'll move on to bits i'll see you guys soon happy thanksgiving maybe

2288
07:07:23,740 --> 07:07:48,779
we'll see you tomorrow that's the end let us rewind the clock to earlier does it work no no

2289
07:07:49,340 --> 07:08:01,770
i have to check it every time thank you peaceful hailey for the 250 bits germa how are you hope

2290
07:08:01,770 --> 07:08:09,500
you enjoy outer worlds it's a very fun game a bit short but fun i think it's good like i said earlier

2291
07:08:09,500 --> 07:08:26,330
it's just it's good enough for me to want to play i think it's interesting enough i will hold final

2292
07:08:26,330 --> 07:08:37,450
judgments until i either finish it or get real close but somebody said six out of ten i think

2293
07:08:37,450 --> 07:08:50,389
that's low i do think it's higher than that also uh i got fallen order and i highly recommend you

2294
07:08:50,389 --> 07:09:01,639
play it if you haven't already have a good night i don't know if you'll see fallen order on stream

2295
07:09:02,279 --> 07:09:24,389
depends on how uh how much room there is for content and by content i mean how much room there

2296
07:09:24,389 --> 07:09:35,270
is for uh somebody said good good i've heard it as oh it's like dark souls and i don't know maybe

2297
07:09:35,990 --> 07:09:43,979
i would probably just do that on my own time but i said that about god of war and i got like halfway

2298
07:09:43,979 --> 07:09:50,520
through god of war and i stopped playing it so that's part of the reason why i don't play that

2299
07:09:50,520 --> 07:09:58,459
many triple a single player games is because a lot of them are long and i lose interest pretty

2300
07:09:58,459 --> 07:10:06,939
quickly if i sit there and play a game for 12 15 20 plus hours usually it has to be really has to

2301
07:10:06,939 --> 07:10:19,369
grab me completely or i'm just gonna stop slowly playing it but we'll see i haven't there's gonna

2302
07:10:19,369 --> 07:10:26,139
be a lull in content here uh once all these new games come out that's sort of no man's land of

2303
07:10:26,220 --> 07:10:35,799
january into february not a whole lot of shit comes out so we'll see oh okay i see what you're

2304
07:10:35,799 --> 07:10:47,060
doing right but thank you i have heard it's sort of interesting thank you gnarly for the 250 i

2305
07:10:47,060 --> 07:10:52,259

07:16:00,540 --> 07:16:04,619
friends and my mother and my dog are dying is there anything you do or think that helps you

2335
07:16:04,619 --> 07:16:21,299
through tough times well that's fucking horrible that sounds absolutely terrible damn that's it

2336
07:16:21,299 --> 07:16:34,580
that's heavy that's a heavy load there um seriously take care of yourself if there's anything that

2337
07:16:34,580 --> 07:16:48,869
anything you do you think that helps you through tough times honestly for me at least and this is

2338
07:16:48,869 --> 07:16:55,750
obviously not any professional opinion or anything which i would implore anybody and everybody to do

2339
07:16:56,549 --> 07:17:01,750
if you think the weight of the world is too much and you're going through too much shit

2340
07:17:03,369 --> 07:17:17,500
please contact somebody that is capable of being able to help you through that but for me i can't

2341
07:17:17,500 --> 07:17:23,500
it's for i'll give you just a perfect example of recent right recently i've been having a this is

2342
07:17:23,500 --> 07:17:31,299
definitely obviously not even close to a ton of of the issues that you're describing but just in

2343
07:17:31,299 --> 07:17:37,750
general talking about what helps you through like tough times right so i've had this medical problem

2344
07:17:37,750 --> 07:17:40,310
that i can't figure out it's been something i've been trying to figure out for like a year

2345
07:17:41,290 --> 07:17:47,369
off and on it's just been there it's been annoying it's been irritating and it's almost like you have

2346
07:17:47,369 --> 07:17:56,900
to look at a telescope in like a year a couple of years into the future and at the end you're

2347
07:17:56,900 --> 07:18:01,459
hoping that as time goes along you'll figure out what's going on you can deal with the problems

2348
07:18:01,459 --> 07:18:10,709
that you have so for me i try not to focus on the exact moment that's happening and i try to focus

2349
07:18:10,709 --> 07:18:25,159
on what's potentially going to be the solution in the future day to day essentially and like jacket

2350
07:18:25,159 --> 07:18:35,180
just said therapy is cool if you need it use it please use it yes for me to tell you these things

2351
07:18:36,060 --> 07:18:44,229
is not the equivalent of somebody who is equipped and qualified to help take care of some of the

2352
07:18:44,229 --> 07:18:51,020
issues you're going through if you're going through shit if you having horrible problems and if shit's

2353
07:18:51,020 --> 07:19:04,020
not looking good get some help there's nothing wrong with it there's absolutely nothing wrong

2354
07:19:04,020 --> 07:19:19,590
with taking care of yourself that's kind of how i think about it i go to therapy every week trust

2355
07:19:19,590 --> 07:19:38,279
me it helps so much yeah i'm glad to hear that i wish you the best i know it's um you know easy

2356

2361
07:20:45,180 --> 07:20:57,619

2404
07:29:33,610 --> 07:29:40,709
i don't make them i don't even use twitter i i painstakingly open this thing to like write

2405
07:29:40,709 --> 07:29:51,450
about a stream that i'm about to start doing my last two real tweets was a picture that i took

2406
07:29:51,450 --> 07:30:05,799
at twitchcon and then two months later telling you i'm not at twitchcon anymore it doesn't even

2409
07:30:30,470 --> 07:30:40,150
before i go there are people that tweet like five ten fifteen times a day i couldn't even think i

2410
07:30:40,150 --> 07:30:44,790
can't even think of one thing to write to you guys a week it's like what am i how do i do that

2411
07:30:45,430 --> 07:30:56,700
for me to write more than five to ten tweets a day i'd have to tell you about my bowel movements

2412
07:30:57,340 --> 07:31:15,959
well that was a good one i feel nice and uh relieved you know if somebody gave me a challenge

2413
07:31:15,959 --> 07:31:21,880
to tweet 10 times a day and they had to be you couldn't just write like a b c d e f g a delete

2414
07:31:21,880 --> 07:31:26,439
you could just do the alphabet 10 times like actually write 10 tweets over the course of a

2415
07:31:26,439 --> 07:31:52,169
day that would be very hard for me to do i did miss one bit yeah i did from smelly boy thank you

2416
07:31:52,169 --> 07:31:56,889
smelly boy for the 250 this game looks very neat also during thanksgiving dinner do you

2417
07:31:56,889 --> 07:32:01,290
prefer your cranberry sauce to be the stuff that has actual cranberries in it or just the big

2418
07:32:01,290 --> 07:32:10,970
fucking jelly slab i'm a jelly slab type of dude myself uh i will take it both ways jelly slab

2419
07:32:10,970 --> 07:32:17,770
is good jelly slab is good to spread over the turkey because it's easy to do that but

2420
07:32:18,490 --> 07:32:24,419
the cram with the cranberry chunks in it i kind of like putting that in my mashed potatoes just

2421
07:32:24,419 --> 07:32:28,659
like a little dollop of it so it's in the center and you go in and grab a little bit of chunks of

2422
07:32:28,659 --> 07:32:37,560
the it gives some the mashed potatoes a little bit more it can be incredibly it's very versatile

2423
07:32:42,040 --> 07:32:49,689
jelly slab makes a great sandwich they all do put it on the mash um i don't think of that

2424
07:32:50,779 --> 07:32:54,840
thanksgiving dinner it doesn't matter where it is just put everything on the plate and just

2425
07:32:54,840 --> 07:32:59,400
mush it up and mix it around spin your fork around in a circle it's still going to be great

2426
07:33:00,119 --> 07:33:16,330
put it on the ground then all right guys i'll see you tomorrow we're going to see how far we get in

2428
07:33:24,790 --> 07:33:30,939

2429
07:33:34,310 --> 07:33:37,029
again tomorrow stream i know i'm saying that it might be short

2430
07:33:38,889 --> 07:33:49,959
but it probably will be because at this like i know it's thanksgiving and i'm not doing like

2431
07:33:49,959 --> 07:33:57,209
thanksgiving on thanksgiving but there's also some stuff going on that i might have to do i got to
