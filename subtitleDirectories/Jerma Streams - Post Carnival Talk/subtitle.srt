00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:09,369
Good afternoon. I'm getting this crazy, crazy revelation right now. I'm using,

2
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:21,929
for the first time, I'm using Streamlabs OBS. This is 500,000 times better than just using standard

3
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:30,519
OBS. I didn't even know this stuff was going to happen until I pressed live. Let me just go

4
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:38,020
over it. Let me paint you a picture here. So the chat is here in the program. The live monitor is

5
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:47,560
here in the program. The recent events, Streamlabs bits and subs and everything's over here. I used

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:57,990
to have like 12 windows out on my monitors. This shit's all in one program? That's unbelievable.

7
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:09,319
Anyways, hi. How are you? I'm Jeremy. Do I sound louder too? I played around with some audio

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:20,950
settings. This is post carnival germa. I'm all about the production value now. I may have screwed

9
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:35,540
up a few settings, but I'm all about making productions like this one. Where's the loud

10
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:43,819
wind? Not across the country anymore. I'm back in Vegas. Not only am I back in Vegas,

11
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:53,180
I have to get ready. I have to get ready to go to San Diego like tomorrow. Hey, I'm back. Hey,

12
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:05,189
back after the carnival. Bye. Going to TwitchCon. Post carnival, pre TwitchCon. September was a

13
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:12,949
busy fucking month. Can I just tell you? Anyways, we can go over a few things here.

14
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:22,860
We're gonna hang out for a little bit. Just enough time to go over stuff that I couldn't really do

15
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,680
at the end of that other stream because we had to tear that whole thing down. Had to leave. I had

16
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:38,870
a birthday to celebrate too. This is the exact game I was hoping you would play. I'm gonna try

17
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:47,590
it. I got a lot of requests to play this. So what's the game? Like two, three hours long or something?

18
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:59,259
Easy. But if you didn't know, I just saw this the other day. Let me put a link for you.

19
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:07,689
The goats, the Andy Mark goats. I didn't even know they were gonna do this. They are on sale

20
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:13,719
right now. The ones that were in the machine. You can buy a goat that was apparently on camera.

21
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:23,060
I don't know how many of these they have. They might have very few amount of these. I don't know

22
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:39,780
how many. Copy and paste. There you go. If you read and see these. The goats were special invited

23
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,259
guests to the recent Twitch carnival in partnership with German 95. Together we put on this the first

24
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:48,180
robotic carnival where viewers at home banded together to control the robots playing games.

25
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,699
You've been asking when there'll be available purchases today is that they each goat in our

26
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:58,340
inventory was on stream in the claw machine when they're gone they're gone. I don't know how many

27
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:07,639
were in there. I don't know if this is one per customer. Hopefully, hopefully if you want one

28
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:16,360
you can get one. Do just chatting. We need to catch up. That's what I plan on doing. We're not

29
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:23,189
just gonna jump right into goose game. I have to remember how to stream. It's been a while. Hold on.

30
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:30,060
Speaking of speaking of forgetting how to live stream like from a desk plus I of course I did

31
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:37,350
the first one. I'm like let me let me set up stream labs OBS. I'll give you one sec. I didn't

32
00:04:37,350 --> 00:05:29,529
even tweet this either. Hold on. Every single one of my USB slots is taken up now. That's not good.

33
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:40,139
I gotta figure out what the hell is even plugged in down here. How do I have? I have like 15 slots.

34
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,980
That makes no sense. All right. Let me figure out how to add my camera now.

35
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:57,180
Uh oh. Oh shit. This is harder than I thought. Wait a minute. Hold on. Add. There we go. I think

36
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:11,860
add a camera. No. This one here. Yeah. Okay. This one looks all right. Is it working? Can you guys

37
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:30,019
see me? No. Why does it look like this? Why does it look like this? Why does it look like this?

38
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:41,750
Is this a? Did I fuck this up? Oh from the left. From the last stream. That's right. Hold on.

39
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:54,279
Hold on. Let me fix my peasant hair. I'm not going to fix my peasant hair. It's not going to happen.

40
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,040
I got a haircut for TwitchCon and I ended up making myself look like a dickhead.

41
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,490
So it looks like we're going with a hat this time. How do I fix this?

42
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:26,120
Why does this still look wrong? Is it doing anything? I gotta really I gotta learn how to

43
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:34,040
use this program. That's gonna take a little while. Anyways let me uh kill the audio here.

44
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,639
How do I crop in Streamlabs? Everybody know how to crop in Streamlabs? What do you do?

45
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,470
It's not alt. It should be alt. I've never used it before. How do you crop in Streamlabs?

46
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:55,189
Show Werelord. Show Werelord. I gotta I got a story for you about Werelord. Okay. Werelord

47
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:04,550
was a huge pain in the ass to take home. Uh hold on. I let me just hold on. Let me tweet this. I'll

48
00:08:04,550 --> 00:09:42,309
be right back. Okay. Yeah I've got I've got a story to tell you about this guy.

49
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:52,899
It's not even really a story. It's just a series of annoyances. Even right now. Even now. Even now

50
00:09:52,899 --> 00:10:01,720
he's a pain in the ass. Okay look. I there's no way he can go. He's such an awkward like big sausage

51
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:10,919
hot dog shape. Uh this was my personal item on the plane. I took a carry-on obviously and this

52
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:16,440
was my personal item. But there's nowhere for him to go. There's no I was gonna put backpack

53
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:24,019
straps on this thing. But listen do you know how hard it is to carry this around like this

54
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:29,860
in an airport? Just like dragging around. I felt like um who's the Charlie Brown character that

55
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,659
has the blanket? I was like dragging him on the ground trying to go to the bathroom with this

56
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:41,220
thing too. I went into the bathroom and I balanced him stuck him through the the handle of the

57
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,399
suitcase trying to drag him and balance him and we got it. I had to go into a stall. I couldn't

58
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,850
am I gonna hold him like this and piss? People would think I was a fucking weirdo.

59
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,220
I had to go into a stall and slowly like this like balance him on the top of my suitcase

60
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:07,350
and he like fell on the public bathroom ground like three times. People were commenting on it too.

61
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:15,779
I told you he was gonna be here. I know that you know where he was. He was in the laundry room

62
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:20,539
because he needed to be cleaned. He was disgusting and I just put my hands all over him again.

63
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:29,960
Ah but it was hard to take take it around and there was actually a few times you know when

64
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:36,200
you're walking by um you're in the airport and you see those big fucking trash cans.

65
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,399
Man after trying to finagle him for like 30-40 straight minutes it got real close for me just

66
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:55,100
like dropping him in the trash. It was really close. It was so frustrating or I was gonna just be I

67
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,029
was gonna be like find somebody and be like here do you want like this toy? But then I was like

68
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:08,019
that's fucked up too. That's kind of that's it's weird. Hey hey do you want this toy? And then I

69
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:12,279
thought they were gonna like cut it open because I'm trying to bring like drugs. That was another

70
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:18,120
thing that was going racing through my mind. Oh yeah just me with this uh yeah Wailord's my favorite

71
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,200
Pokemon. Don't worry he's just a perfectly perfectly large enough to store like eight

72
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,340
pounds of cocaine. Let me just I'm just taking him with me. Don't worry it's kids toy. That was

73
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:46,419
a fucking whole lord deal. Drug Wailord. Wail Drug Lord. Anyways I'm back. Uh I had a birthday too.

74
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,899
I saw a lot of wonderful things. I'm not even I'm not in the wrong I'm in the wrong category.

75
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,100
Let me change this to just chatting because that's where I'm supposed to be.

76
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:10,500
Why is my intro still playing? Get out of here. There we go. No not jump. Jump ultimate stars.

77
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:26,679
Just chatting. Okay how do I make this bigger? It's just gonna look like this. I'm sorry. You

78
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:33,379
guys just have to deal with how stupid this looks. No not that. This is fine. It's fine. I don't care.

79
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:42,440
Anyways uh bits bits just came in. Did they? Hold on. Let me change my streamlabs thing.

80
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:58,120
Is it like am I too wide? Is that right? What came in? Where? Huge bits. I don't see huge bits.

81
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:07,690
Where do you see them? Wider. Oh we got them. We debated them. Now let's talk about this.

82
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:13,529
By the way again if you want Andy Mark Goat there's good luck because you probably they're

83
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:20,679
gonna sell out in probably 15 minutes. Or they have or there's more that was in there that I

84
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:29,559
didn't know of. They're already gone. Are they actually already gone? No they're not are they?

85
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:49,019
I think they're still there. He ignored 500 bucks. There's not 500 dollars here. Did you

86
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:54,659
donate that of the money to charity? No not yet. I have not been home for more than a day or two so

87
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:02,700
and I had to celebrate my birthday. This is the first day of like existing that you guys are

88
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:20,870
seeing. You just got paid for the drugs that you smuggled. Birthday money. Did somebody say I

89
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:35,500
ignored Joel earlier? Is Joel here? Did I did I miss Joel? Well what's up? No it was it was a

90
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,519
great time and it was an immense success I think. There was a couple of hiccups. The robot you

91
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,590
actually guys you actually really did break the robot like twice. You can always tell when the

92
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:51,750
robot got broken when they would just hand me a microphone and say hey the robot's uh fucked up

93
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:58,389
like you gotta kill time and I'm just like sitting there like okay so uh nice we've got uh something

00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:04,389

know he doesn't know how to what do you mean i don't know he actually said what am i going to

139
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:15,450
go to popping gamer this year what what's so what's wrong with that so joel you're not going to you're

140
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:40,380
not going to twitchcon it's up dog just in a different way what's popping gamer okay well if

141
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:48,890
you actually are going to twitchcon maybe i'll uh maybe i'll see you there nice dishwater coffee

142
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:59,559
it's not a dishwater coffee it is a a pineapple juice that i dumped in a starbucks container

143
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:03,799
and then filled it with water so it's a pineapple juice concentrate that i turned into a hydrating

144
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:17,099
liquid it was not dish water soap uh anyways that was some of the most fun i think i've ever had

145
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:23,339
especially even like on stream that once we got going and after like 45 minutes or so and it was

146
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:29,450
very clear that the wind wasn't going to destroy everything that was so much fun and something

147
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:38,920
else that you guys really need to know uh this this ain't ending here we are already already

148
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:45,819
talking about the next one so that's not oh that was the carnival that was really cool uh

149
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:53,289
we'll never see anything like that again no you sooner than you think this shit ain't going to

150
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:59,539
have anything to do with the carnival either we're stepping on the gas here guys i'm just holding

151
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:08,440
it down and i'm gonna hold the gas pedal down until the car is out of gas and then i'm walking

152
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,990
too and then when i'm done walking when my legs give up from the fucking dehydration i'm gonna

153
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:36,759
crawl you understand and then when i'm done crawling when i'm out of complete energy and i

154
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:54,200
am not of dessert anymore as a fucking ghost keep going and no i we're gonna we're going

155
00:24:54,839 --> 00:25:00,809
there's way more to see if you think that's it that's not even close

156
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:14,009
that was a test and i and i think i passed i think i passed the test i only almost got hurt four

157
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:25,930
times that's not a big deal it's okay we've got more robotic streams that we've been thinking of

158
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:33,420
just going back and forth just it was the whole team just clicked all the all the people at

159
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:41,019
were so awesome they were super super nice had a bunch of great ideas themselves that all that

160
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:46,380
that wasn't just all me guys like they had to come up with most of that shit because they were the

161
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:53,799
ones that had to make the fucking robot so i was extreme overlord this is what i want this is how

162
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:57,640
i want it to work this is the joke that i want to do i want this joke i want that to happen i want

163
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,200
that to happen and these guys just absolutely fucking killed it like it was it was unbelievable

164
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:08,599
i couldn't have asked for a better team so there was a lot of people that worked on that stuff and

165
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:14,279
there they were very very very adamant and excited to work together again in the future

166
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:22,809
so i could not have gotten a better group of people can you share anything that did not make

167
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:35,000
the stream um i'm trying to think there's anything that that didn't get in there every all like the

168
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,720
weird fucked up shit that i wanted to do got in the stream but that we made sure this but we just

169
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:48,359
like three or four months in the making so we had lots of time to prepare for it and lots of time

170
00:26:48,359 --> 00:27:01,299
to care about it the feet cam the feet cam was scripted it was not in fact a lot of the things

171
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:06,259
that i think you guys think were scripted were not at all me getting hit in the face by the frog

172
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:15,500
that was i could i actually couldn't i could not believe you did i said it hit me in the face and

173
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,779
you guys hit me in the face and it was not just i didn't move to like get hit by it it wasn't like

174
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:25,579
oh there it is i'm gonna like okay uh three two i can see the timer okay get in the way and like

175
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:31,480
get hit by it no no i didn't move you guys hit me right in the fucking nose i stood completely

176
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:42,680
still when you fired that thing it hit me directly in the face uh what are some moments there were

177
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,930
some moments that felt scripted well the clowns were scripted because they they had to be and

178
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:59,769
they were awesome too oh those those clowns were unbelievable bring them back that's gonna be tough

179
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:10,500
because they're across the country procedurally generated clown content we gave them an idea of

180
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,869
what we wanted and then they just they just kind of hit the ground running and did whatever they

181
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:32,259
fucking felt like and it was great those clowns was the clowns were scary move in with the clowns

182
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:39,779
what would you guys do if i just went come on in and they both just came in and i got up walked

183
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:47,019
out of the room and they just did a fucking two-hour routine it was i felt uncomfortable

184
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:07,049
yeah well i'm sorry i'm sorry but it was great give us our prizes uh you got the the workloads

185
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:19,029
right here but twitchcon is this weekend i know at least a few of the people that were that were

186
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:25,180
part of the event are going to be there we're going to brainstorm some more stuff we were talking

187
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:35,109
about and i don't want to give away any spoilers in fact i won't but i want i want the next one

188
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:46,089
to be somewhere either in january or february of 2020 the next stream like that you will see

189
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:53,539
it in somewhere i'm hoping between december and february faster i can get done the better

190
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:02,410
early yeah i want to do this every few months every three or four months i want to do something

191
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:09,779
like that because that's fun to me that's it just i just that's that's what i care about at this

192
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:18,470
point and now the team exists there they are ready and they are willing and they were just like

193
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:26,920
whatever you come up with let's fucking go it's like dude i have i have i have fucking nightmares

194
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:37,029
and dreams every single night with new scenarios so we're not gonna run out of those but it was

195
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:42,500
something that was cut nope i wrote up everything you see on that stream i've

196
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:50,099
written down on a piece of paper you know series of napkins i was at it was at chili's and just

197
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,900
wrote like an crayon a series of things that i wanted to do and you know every bullet point

198
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:01,140
every piece everything that i wanted and sent it off to the producer producer said can we make

199
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:15,509
this happen the rest is uh history too many napkins ordered off the kids menu no ordering

200
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:24,759
off the kids menu at a chili's you honestly may as well just go to the grocery store and just get a

201
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:34,170
loaf of white bread and just eat it out of the bag this the same nutritional value so that way

202
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:38,250
we're still sub september isn't like chilies right like we're not gonna do like sub october and it's

203
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:51,269
chilies right am i gonna get i'm not i gotta stop talking shit about stuff mr luxury streamer

204
00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:03,019
hold on a minute here i am not a luxury streamer i just don't like chilies you can be

205
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:15,700
non-luxury and not like chilies i don't think that's a very controversial opinion i mean

206
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:22,839
that being said the southwestern egg rolls are some of the finest they actually are pretty good

207
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:33,430
he's backtracking oh i gotta test my new my my audio compressor does it work you tell me ready

208
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:39,769
you should this should not get louder than like it too loud to listen to i'm gonna peek the mic

209
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:43,769
right now but it's not gonna peak this is a test i couldn't test before the stream started here we

210
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:57,930
go ah right that was okay that was that was fine right it didn't know it could there's no way it

211
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:07,140
could peak i have a limiter on now yeah is it distorting when i get this close when i go louder

212
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:14,700
than that does it distort that's what i need to know somebody just gave that was disgusting

213
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:23,859
somebody gave five it was uh durnu uh kaiser gave five community subs it did peak it's not possible

214
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:34,069
for it to peak i have a limiter set up right now let me prove it to you where's my audio where's

215
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:40,119
my audio monitoring device there it is all right hold on a second here so you tell me that you

216
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:50,680
said it's still it's still peaking your career is peaking okay see you in december and tell me

217
00:33:50,680 --> 00:34:06,890
the same thing hey see it see in like december or january i want that guy to come back okay so

218
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:24,139
this is your career peaked at spi no that i there's no it did not oh mega lull true like true true

219
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:33,800
true just because that's your favorite thing doesn't mean that's where i peaked there is no

220
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,599
there is no peak i already told you i'm fucking i'm going on the gas until i have to walk at that

221
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:43,639
point the car would be when you peaked because then walking is much slower than driving and

222
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:49,849
crawling is slower than walking and when and when and when you're a ghost you don't have leg you

223
00:34:49,849 --> 00:35:00,730
can't walk oh fuck this is not good what was i supposed to be doing oh right and i was testing

224
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:13,909
the limiter here all right i'm i can i can monitor this okay so uh hello i want to monitor this

225
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:22,099
is it working why is it not working is my computer fucked hello hello

226
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:37,059
hello hello hello hello hello i can't hear anything why i have lost audio on my computer

227
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:59,429
hello there we go this one shit's breaking okay uh no i can't peek i'm looking at it right now and

228
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:16,579
hear it oh no i can't okay not important so let's let's move on that's that was not important i

229
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:22,139
could have done that without being on camera so all right anyways what are you guys looking

230
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:39,320
you guys got a picture you want me to look at what is it oh like this what this is some kind

231
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:48,710
of surprise i guys guys i'm in this photo i i know this picture exists somebody didn't just

232
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:53,110
like sprint over to me and like make me stand next to that and then take a photo and run away

233
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:09,590
that's whatever how do i explain that i i mean what do you want me to explain that five six is

234
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:18,489
is like six six six eight look at the bars up top look that is bigger than a ceiling

235
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:27,780
or you think someone's who are those bars made for then all right if that's five six who are

236
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:48,070
the bars made for for children okay so you you think that what children like three feet tall

237
00:37:48,070 --> 00:38:02,869
like how big are the people that are on that five six bars at five six doesn't know how tall kids

238
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:11,159
are yes i do the sign was incorrect and i was looking at it and then somebody took a picture

239
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:16,730
of it and they were laughing hysterically like their face was bright red laughing like wheezing

240
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:20,889
and i just kept going like i don't understand why i don't understand they got the picture and

241
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:25,690
they put they posted it they said could i just please post that picture and i was like yeah

242
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:42,420
four four six is like this tall that's like six i think that's like either six six

243
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:52,099
or that's like over that's almost seven feet tall look at the tree in the background is that tree

244
00:38:52,099 --> 00:39:01,739
six feet tall i know that's a that's perspective i can't that's i can't prove it that way what does

245
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:11,380
it say stand up and hold a ruler no then i'll break the illusion that i'm some fucking goblin

246
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:18,070
that hunches over and carries like a backpack of gold around and i don't i don't want to break that

247
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:28,139
illusion that should have been pretty sick though if you had go that much gold everybody talk shit

248
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:32,300
about the goblet oh that yeah there goes the goblin with the goldenness in the knapsack

249
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,460
uh yeah that's worth like six or seven hundred million dollars like is that

250
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:45,159
you want to like talk down to the goblin with the fucking gigantic sack of gold they are they go

251
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:52,760
into their house like oh they slam it down and then they process it through like bank of america

252
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:59,530
and they get in their suit and their tie and then they go to fucking dinner the nicest restaurant

253
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:15,860
in the entire fucking city now he's projecting now he's projecting if you guys think i i you think i

254
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:25,349
own a suit no i don't you saw me with the only suit jacket i own on december 31st and it was too

255
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:30,070
small remember my arms were coming out of it i had that i've had that suit jacket since i was like

256
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:40,789
fucking i don't know 17 or something the new year stream yeah that's the only i know i think i don't

257
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:45,510
think i'm gonna have that anymore am i gonna play anything yeah yeah we're gonna play um

258
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:52,300
i'm just people wanted to hang out and talk for a little bit go over the the weekend and then

259
00:40:52,300 --> 00:41:00,389
we're gonna play untitled goose game how do they make contact with andy mark it was a long process

260
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:06,650
those of you that don't know that stream i wanted to do that stream for about two years

261
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:15,269
it was so hard to try to find anybody that knew anything about robotics to that extent

262
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:24,650
because there's been plenty of you know twitch controls stuff on this site before obviously

263
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,769
twitch plays pokemon right that was the big one that was the first one wow this is crazy

264
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:36,409
the twitch controls this thing twitch moves that thing but never twitch can control a robot to that

265
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:42,730
size and that weight and that kind of device shooting like a ball out of it a real softball

266
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:50,329
not just like a little laser or a little um like action figure thing so anybody that

267
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,670
people at twitch i brought it up to people at twitch i had a partner manager at the time

268
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,750
and it was just like hey this is what i want to do i want to do like a little twitch dunk tank i'm

269
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:04,469
gonna do a carnival maybe and have like clowns and do some jokes and bring in some games and

270
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:08,869
some rides and stuff and they were like oh that sounds really cool and it was just a process of

271
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:15,510
trying to find the right person to connect to somebody that knew somebody who then could say

272
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:23,659
oh that sounds like a great idea and yes i work for a robotics company it was just tricky but

273
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:31,400
just through bouncing from person to person to person to person it went from my new partner

274
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,119
manager who without uh without my new partner manager this seriously this stream does not happen

275
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:43,929
they connected me to the first person necessary to be able to start the whole thing so without

276
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:58,630
that person it does not exist me no not me not you no um it really was a one guy scenario

277
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:08,440
and then i got linked up with um jk productions which was a production company that knew the

278
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,880
people at andy mark and through um various events and stuff and just somebody that knows

279
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:20,760
somebody that knows somebody that knows that person uh led to uh andy mark making these robots

280
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,519
and doing this whole thing the stream did the stream did cost a lot of money it did like i'm

281
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:30,840
i people have been wanting to know and i i'm not going to tell you a number because i don't think

282
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:41,110
it's necessary i don't think so but it it was some cash it was some it was some money because

283
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:44,710
there's no way that somebody could make those kind of things without trying to dish out a

284
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:48,949
little bit of money but i've said this before i said it a thousand times it was at least a dollar

285
00:43:48,949 --> 00:44:00,059
yes it was 500 000 i said it on stream it was like 600 million no um i don't need to i don't

286
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:06,500
want to give a number because once once you start giving numbers then i don't know you start i don't

287
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:12,739
want anyone to feel like in this community holy shit oh they gave stuff but we gotta like refill

288
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:18,150
that i don't want that i don't want to come across like i'm saying oh you guys that was a lot of

289
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:27,699
money like oh that was a lot of you know i'm saying that was a lot of cash for me um it's

290
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:38,070
not necessary and i don't want any people it's it's easy to concern people right like hold on how

291
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:41,750
much money did you spend dude don't fucking do that anymore you don't have to do that don't do

292
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,199
what i actually when i told star star is one of the people that knows how much money this cost

293
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:55,420
and he he was like what the fuck are you doing he was like you are fucking crazy and i was like no

294
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:05,300

295
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:18,230
you mute what did you guys talk about it was that but again this channel sees so much money

296
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:24,280
it does what you want to like pretend like it doesn't like i i don't i want to be completely

297
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,579
fucking see-through you know what i mean i don't want anyone to think you guys give a ton of

298
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:37,099
fucking money to the stream way more than i think some of you guys think so if i am going to i want

299
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:43,179
to do this i want to take whatever you guys give to this channel obviously i'm gonna i'm not going

302
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,099

303
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:06,179
if i can take a large portion of this money and have a twitch controlled fucking carnival

304
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:12,199
that's what's going to happen every single fucking time if i'm able to do it

305
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:21,619
it's gonna happen every time he's obsessed with spending money stop talking about it you're gonna

306
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:29,590
regret it no there's no way how could i regret something like that it's not gonna happen

307
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:42,469
it was everything i wanted it to be so i just i just i can't i have no regrets and speaking of

308
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:55,980
money rvm thanks for the 5000 bits no yeah no i saw the card we talked i was in the pre-stream

309
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:15,340
we talked about it oh wait maybe did i didn't know i saw this one didn't i yeah i know that

310
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:19,820
yeah all the everyone contributing all the artwork and all the wonderful fucking sayings and messages

311
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:34,650
and everything for my birthday yeah yeah it's it's unfucking believable i i cannot words cannot

312
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:45,690
describe the feeling that you get when something like that comes in you know i'm saying every

313
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:52,889
message every piece of artwork it's made it's i'm 34 it's you know i didn't really do too much from

314
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:58,170
i mean i went out and uh and you know had a couple of drinks and stuff and just kind of chilled

315
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:06,179
it was a great time but when you get to be over 30 birthdays start to kind of become it's not like oh

316
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:15,940
i'm 18 i'm 21 i'm 25 i'm 30 it's kind of at this point that the ticker is just continuing to roll

317
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:25,619
so uh that's an incredibly special feeling to see something like this monkey ass what

318
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:31,050
what what are you talking about that's just the way it is how long am i i gotta cut these before

319
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:36,059
twitchcon remind me before the stream ends yeah look at these things these things gotta go

320
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,719
these are that these are kind of how long your nails are these are accidentally scratch your face

321
00:48:41,719 --> 00:49:03,320
long nails but seriously so many people was like signed on this too this was a what i believe from

322
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,760
looking at the reddit thread about it and all the people that were posting stuff i mean this is a

323
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:14,389
multi-week thing to do so thank you everybody in the community that anything to do with this

326
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:38,860
started here if you go back this is interesting if you go back um go back like five or six years to

00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:46,230
the youtube channel and go to a facecam video i don't have this it was like that i'm getting

into bugleberry slowly grow a beard i can't grow a beard this is this is the extent of what i can

330
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:15,849

331
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:21,769
a weirdo am i weird let me explain let me explain this my i like the way that i look the most

332
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:30,739
when i've had two to three days of not shaving a fresh close shave i don't like the way that

333
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:39,340
i look right after it so during events for instance like twitchcon coming up i'm timing

334
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:44,699
every time about twitchcon the carnival stream oh i'm i've got a big party that i want to go to

335
00:50:44,699 --> 00:50:51,099
oh i have this event that i have planned it oh and it's in it's in three days i time it so i shave

336
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:57,639
so then within two to three days i'm gonna show up to the twitchcon party and it's gonna be like

337
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:05,059
it's been two and a half full days exactly timed timed stubble and i'll be like hey what's up it's

goodbye you know see what i got here i got like time stubble and they're gonna go i don't know

340
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:34,360

341
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:40,599
off and i miss time it by a little bit because it's three days it is like two and a half to the

342
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:48,250
third day if i miss time it and a fourth day goes by and then i go to the event no no we're all

343
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:53,989
fucked up now and it looks like shit and then i have to have the awkward conversation with myself

344
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:59,639
do you want to look a little dirty or do you want to look clean shave in the way that you don't like

345
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:05,780
oh it's hard okay how do i look right now it's like kind of scraggly i look a little dirty and

346
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:15,750
shit but i it's still all right just trim it no because i i've tried i have tried to trim when

347
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:22,699
you trim you end up doing this fuck you end up doing like patchy grass it's like mowing a lawn

348
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:27,659
you end up missing spaces and you have like scraggly hair and random spots i remember one

349
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:33,449
time it was so embarrassing i got an electric razor that had the trimmer on it and i was i was

350
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:38,809
at like five days no i gotta get this down to three so trying to get it down to three days

351
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:46,949
and it looked okay i got rolling on oh that looks all right right i get to where i was going

352
00:52:46,949 --> 00:52:52,090
and nobody said anything i didn't know there was no hey whoa what the fuck's going on with your

353
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:57,260
neck no nobody said a damn thing i went to the bathroom and i was checking myself i'll just

354
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,860
making sure everything's going all right you know i've been there for an hour or two and then i went

355
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:11,780
like this and went like because i had these just spikes just black spikes sticking out of

356
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:18,170
random places in my neck because i didn't get them all the way it wasn't a beard it was just these

357
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:24,329
weird gross like hairs that were just poking out of a million different places so for the rest of

358
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:32,489
the night i was kind of like looking down like this i'm not at not extreme like that but you know

359
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:36,809
what i mean you end up just thinking and then you get the idea you go all right can i pluck all

360
00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:41,820
these out in the mirror there was probably like 45 of them and i'm just like can i sit here and

361
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:48,519
pretend i'm taking a dump and just pluck all 45 of these with my bare hands you got i got like

362
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:56,949
two or three in and i was like that's not going to happen so i i don't do the trimmers anymore

363
00:53:56,949 --> 00:54:04,309
try to take a five day down to a three no i just time it perfectly for instance this is like

364
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:14,730

369
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:08,940
i know guys i have i you know i also wouldn't stand outside on stream in a

370
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:15,579
field during a thunderstorm i'm not going to get struck by lightning it's not going to happen

371
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:19,900
it's raining out and this thunder and lightning outside i'm just going to stand outside like in

372
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:27,530
grass could i get struck by lightning make sure is there like a one zero point one point one percent

373
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:32,539
chance that it'll happen yeah i don't want to get struck by lightning on stream i don't want to be

374
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:39,059
shaving on stream and the zero point zero zero one percent chance that the blade is something

375
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:45,940
wrong with it or it's too dull or i i turn the wrong way and like i get a bad cut on my face like

376
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:51,860
on stream shaving because i shave with a safety razor i don't shave with like a Gillette like

377
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:58,969
just no i have i have a real blade i shave with a real blade i ain't gonna get struck by lightning

378
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:08,489
on stream stop having such a chad jawline it actually sucks because when you look at this

379
00:56:08,489 --> 00:56:16,570
thing look at that's all bone like you can't shave over that look at this bone that's bone

380
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:34,420
that's bone so when i have a razor i have to i have to i have to like go around this big ass bone

381
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,739
and then you end up having like you your eyes you have to cross your eyes those of you that have like

382
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:46,420
big ass bones here right i have to go like this let's say you're the mirror i have to go like this

383
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:54,679
into the mirror i can't fucking see what i can't see i can barely fucking see what's happening

384
00:56:54,679 --> 00:57:05,510
right now i'm just telling you i'm just telling you how it is Jeremy you look real old today

385
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:17,539
is it a birthday gag thanks but it's true it's true uh but i i used to shave and the reason why

386
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:22,420
i switched and i'm very careful like i'm not gonna fucking around when i tell you that uh i switched

387
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:28,920
from the guy to say don't listen to this bullshit all right this is more this is more like shit

388
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,400
talking of companies that will never sponsor me okay we don't do sponsors on this channel anyways

389
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:43,050
you don't it's time for the the six or seven blades in one day one two three four five six

390
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:48,250
seven eight nine all right you when you shave your face you shave with the first blade it gets the

391
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:54,579
big hairs the second blade gets the tiny hairs the third blade gets you don't need five fucking

392
00:57:54,579 --> 00:58:01,460
blades you don't need like eight blades in one of those like and then they have like gel on them

393
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:12,500
what is this thing what happened to the goose game it's still happening we're still gonna do it

394
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:20,579
the blades get clogged up yeah you go down once and then you just got this like fucking mess in

395
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:28,699
there that you have to like dunk and like blow on it and like swish it around in water and they're

396
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:36,389
expensive do you know how cheap a razor blade is and you know how expensive would you go to cvs

397
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:44,789
and buy one of those fucking 16 blades with like the like the fucking sea salt gel that's all over

398
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:49,269
it and the fucking powder on the bottom you know how much money that is and you have to buy a new

399
00:58:49,269 --> 00:59:04,219
one like every month it's really expensive i switched to just a safety razor so just raise it

400
00:59:04,219 --> 00:59:08,940
the thing with the head you screw it on it's just a razor blade it's got two sides it's a one blade

401
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:14,760
two edges and as long as you're careful and you train yourself and you get tutorials on how to do

402
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:26,119
it i just kind of started doing it i am actually afraid to use the barber one you know it's what

403
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:32,550
i'm talking about the one that's like a switchblade it's like no no no i that to me that's like going

404
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:40,230
into the kitchen and grabbing a knife out of the drunk straight razors i can't do safety razor i

405
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:47,239
can't it's it's actually it's scary it is and i look i know there's a lot of people that use

406
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:53,909
straight razors and yeah you know i shave with a straight razor you know i do it's much cleaner

407
00:59:53,909 --> 01:00:00,199
it's much better for you that person is terrified every time they use it internally they can tell

408
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:04,119
anybody that they use a straight razor they'll be in the mirror just going hope this ain't the

409
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:19,579
fucking day hope this ain't the day it's funny because even when i use a safety razor i say the

410
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:27,159
same thing i this is fine this is fine here here no this is very easy once i get down here

411
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:35,849
hope this ain't what hope this ain't the day okay it's not are you being a stand-up comedian

412
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:45,159
