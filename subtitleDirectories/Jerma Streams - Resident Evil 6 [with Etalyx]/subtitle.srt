1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:19,660
Hello, how you doing? Do you have a lot of new emotes? You're right. What's up? Let's go already.

2
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:26,280
Let's get been I'm not late. I was here at 330. It's like this I said, I said Resident Evil six

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,679
is a banger. Resident Evil six is the worst Resident Evil game. Wait, hold on. Worst numbered

4
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:39,929
Resident Evil game, I think. Wait, hold on. It might be better than the first one. I know

5
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:44,250
everybody. Look, I don't like the tank controls. 20 years ago, I didn't like tank controls.

6
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:57,990
It automatically is like in a different category for me. Resident Evil. Yeah, they're all good.

7
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:13,510
And controls. I it's just it just ruins it for me. It ruins it just does. Anyways,

8
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,950
we got some stuff to talk about. We've got some exciting things to talk about. Well,

9
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:26,709
I mean, kind of exciting. First most important thing is tonight is the night where the New Year's

10
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:34,390
Eve nomination categories are going up. You'll be able to nominate for each category. Make

11
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,349
sure you follow the rules. They're going to be very, very clearly posted. I'm going to give you

12
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:49,370
guys probably 10 days, 12 days to nominate stuff. And a day after the nominations close,

13
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:55,530
I'm going to go through, make the list, and you'll be able to vote on the worst and best

14
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:05,879
stings of the year. Really important to note. Very important. The dollhouse is not nominatable

15
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:14,919
in a handful of categories. So to make it so dollhouse doesn't like inhale 10 different

16
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:24,069
categories, it is not eligible for best stream of the year. It's not eligible for best joke taking

17
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,270
more than five minutes to set up because I know a lot of people probably nominate stuff for that.

18
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:33,620
So just imagine dollhouse is grayed out in its own world and there's a new category that's

19
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:41,830
best dollhouse moment. So dollhouse has its own category. You're probably also probably

20
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,389
wondering if worst Peter's on there. Of course it is. I don't think I said it once. I think that's

21
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:52,250
the only time I said it the whole year. It's just on there. It has to be on there. I don't even care.

22
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,870
There's, yeah, there's one right there. I don't know. I was going to take it off,

23
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:11,849
but I was like, you know what? I don't care. Wait. Oh, I gotta make sure I didn't get kicked

24
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:20,169
in the lobby, which I may have. We kicked. No, he's here. Just making sure that he wasn't kicked.

25
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,580
You gotta move around a little bit. Okay. Currently me and it's Alex are currently in

26
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:32,229
Resident Evil 6. We're in a lobby. We're going to play. This is the Resident Evil 6 stream that

27
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:36,949
I've been literally like just putting off and just not doing for like the last three weeks,

28
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:42,780
three and a half, four weeks. Here we are. Good question. When is tomorrow's stream? Oh,

29
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,780
no, that's when is Toontown stream. I don't know. But would you like to hear the series of events

30
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,639
that is going to be pretty exciting stuff? They were playing Resident Evil 6, never going to

31
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:01,590
play this again. I would assume after like three or four hours, maybe five hours tops, I'm just

32
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,509
like, I fucking have to leave. I don't want to play this anymore. I'm going to be very surprised

33
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:09,830
if that's not the case. So you'll never see this ever again. In fact, I can't wait to uninstall it

34
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:18,310
from steam. Secondly, on the eighth, guess what comes out on the eighth? I didn't even know this

35
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:26,250
until a week ago. That's right. Monster Rancher one and two remake. It's not a remake. It's just a port.

36
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:34,579
We're going to play it. You bet your ass. And then on the ninth, game awards, obviously,

37
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:41,379
I'll be streaming the game awards like I always do. Then that's it. That's all I have planned for

38
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:52,870
this week. I'm very excited. I'm very excited to play Monster Rancher one and two. Beanbag Sonic

39
00:04:52,870 --> 00:05:01,610
lives again. I'm really glad the game awards are at like four o'clock in the afternoon or five in

40
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:10,250
the afternoon. You want some lore? Remember the Nintendo Direct that was at 9am Pacific?

41
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,329
That was I don't think I even showered. I just ripped myself out of bed, ran in the room,

42
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:21,930
put my bathrobe on, put some water in my hair and turned it on. I felt like shit during that stream.

43
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:29,540
Nothing happens before noon here. It just does. It's been like that since I was like 12,

44
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:40,389
15. Doesn't matter. I, I, guys, I can't even eat before noon. I get up in the morning and it's like,

45
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:48,180
nope, nothing. I can't, I'm useless until 12 o'clock. And then at 2pm, I'm at peak readiness. Here

46
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,939
we go. From two to 10 or two to eight is like, I got the most energy. I'm ready to go. I'm hungry.

47
00:05:53,939 --> 00:06:03,060
I'm ready to go. I don't know. Why is that? Why is my body reject food for two or three hours

48
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,139
after I wake up? I don't get it. I don't, I'm not, my hunger reflex is gone. I'm like, it makes me

49
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:18,819
kind of nauseous. It's an ADHD thing. Is it really? That's interesting. Somebody said you're gaining

50
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:26,180
viewers. Uh, yeah. I just turned the stream on. Yeah. Of course it's going to be gaining viewers.

51
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:33,990
It's the first five minutes of the stream. What you need to do is you need to wait till like the

52
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:39,110
end of the stream or after like a few hours of Resident Evil 6 and like 4,000 people that are

53
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,430
here. They say like POG a bunch of times and then they just leave because this game sucks.

54
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,420
I, I'm ready. That's when you say viewers plummeting, right? You got to be ready for that

55
00:06:50,420 --> 00:07:02,100
one. What? How many people are here now? Oh shit. Oh shit. The six K all ready. We haven't even

56
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:10,220
started. I, you know what? I'll tell you. I have not even been paying attention to my view count.

57
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,560
I haven't even been looking at it. It's just something that I know exists.

58
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:23,399
Nine K. No, no, I don't care. Don't get me looking at the view count. I don't even want to look at

59
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:29,180
it. They could be a hundred people here or like a hundred thousand. I don't even want to know.

60
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,790
Don't tell me what I mean. If we hit 20 K, then I got to celebrate that one already. Well, I already

61
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:48,139
did. You're going to do a face reveal. Yeah. You're a pot. You've got a positive outlook. No, I just,

62
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:52,379
all right. I just want, I'm just not, I don't want to pay attention to it. Why would I?

63
00:07:52,939 --> 00:08:01,990
Let me check and see if he's here. Not. But yeah, I have, while there's more people trickling in,

64
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,670
just listen. End of the year awards. There's a lot of new people since the last time we did this. So

65
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:13,509
let's make this really clear. This is, I believe the fourth annual worst shit of the year awards

66
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:20,550
where it's not like a typical award stream that you may be used to. We go over, over the course

67
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:26,149
of 2021. All the worst shit, all like the cringiest, weirdest shit that I, that apparently I've done.

68
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,709
There's also best stream of the year. There's also like best joke of the year.

69
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,629
It's things like worst face, worst sound I made, worst singing, worst impressions,

70
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:49,460
best impression, best noise. It's, it's fun. Irma and cringe never. Worst shit 2021.

71
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:56,230
Yeah. Best one guy. We take what's something that one guy in the community did.

72
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:05,929
The emote, right? When are you going to do a Neanderthal collab? Let's go Neanderthal. Let's go.

73
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:16,539
I somebody, every time. All right. Listen, anytime anybody ever says like, Oh dude,

74
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,139
what, when are you going to do collab with this person? Oh, hold on. Let me call them right now.

75
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:35,100
Oh, hey, hey, before you say any words. Hey, do you want to do a collab stream on Monday? Yeah.

76
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:41,179
I got time. You got time? Okay. Now, now say hello. What do you want to do? It's just if it happens,

77
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:45,500
it happens. It depends. There's a project that I think is interesting. If I want to collaborate

78
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,259
with somebody, then we collaborate. I think Neanderthal is, Neanderthal is fucking hilarious.

79
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:58,500
Of course that would be fun. Maybe, but like you, you, it just, it's, if it's gonna happen,

80
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,389
maybe it, it could. I would say that about anybody. Literally anyone.

81
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:22,419
Everyone calling me anti-social Andy. I'm about to do a collaboration in 10 minutes. Like I'm in

82
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:31,019
the call right now with somebody. It don't matter. I'm, I'm open to collaborations, but I'm closed

83
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,919
to everything. That's really weird to say, but it's, it's accurate.

84
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,950
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on a minute. I'm open to collaborations.

85
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:55,980
I am closed to solicitations. Okay. That's perfect way to say it. When are you going to do 1080p

86
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:06,570
streams? Um, I don't know when, when I, I'm not going to know. I don't know. Okay. I think we're

87
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:15,210
ready. Hey, did we get kicked out of the lobby? I hope not. I haven't been looking. Okay. You're,

88
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,409
you're actually in. Okay. Cool. Yeah. So tapping freaks me out though. Yeah. I don't like it.

89
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:33,559
Let's see. The camera's not on the camera on. Please don't be on. Don't be on. All right.

90
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:41,860
That's a freeze frame. It's good. I don't have one camera. All right. So we're going to play

91
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,740
resident evil six. It's going to be a fun time. It's going to be fun. Yeah. Like I would, like

92
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,059
I was telling Chaz, it's, this is the best, most critically acclaimed resident evil. This is the

93
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:58,259
worst one. What does your title say? It's my title says, uh, I got a, yeah, maybe I'll tap.

94
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,740
My title says picking the best resident evil for the Halloween co-op stream. You're going to tell

95
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,620
mine says this is the worst. My sense, my, my stream title, I swear to God actually says

96
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:14,120
literally the worst one. So, I mean, we'll find out that's that's yin and yang energy right there.

97
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,879
All right. So when we skip the opening cut scene, cause who really cares? There's a virus on the

98
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,759
loose and we have to track down the fucking tyrant or whatever. All right, let's go.

99
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,909
You ready? I'm walking as fast as I can towards this door. I don't, there's no sprint in resident

100
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:34,549
evil six, right? I didn't see one. There's a dash. There's a dash. There's a dash. Yeah. There's a

101
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:39,700
dash button. I don't know what it is. Cause I did the tutorial with a controller. Oh, that's right.

102
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,299
You're on controller. I'm on keyboard. I switched the keyboard and mouse cause you made me feel

103
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:46,740
insecure. You were like, I gotta, I gotta up my accuracy. So I was like, well, I gotta compete.

104
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,419
I gotta up my accuracy. So then I switched the mouse. Well, but the whole point is that

105
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,440
I would have more accuracy than you. Cause you're on controller and now you're going to make me look

106
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:02,039
bad. Turn on an ass cam. How would that work? Where would the cams on by default? If you haven't

107
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:09,529
changed the FOV, it's pretty zoomed in. Yeah. I did. I moved the FOV. What? Yeah. You have to do

108
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:17,179
that from the main menu. I was told. What do you, no, you don't. Oh yeah. You do. How do you wait?

109
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:23,059
Why am I just standing here? Cause it's a co-op moment. Oh, it's a co-op thing. I don't know how

110
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:32,659
to. Okay. There we go. Hey, press V. It's your best bet. Aim for the head. If somebody's, if you

111
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:37,220
want to toggle sprint, you have to go to the main menu and press the hilarious joke that everyone's

112
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:43,429
heard a thousand times back in like 2010. All right. I think sprint is all F4. Is that what

113
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:49,259
they're saying? You got it. All right. So this is how it works. We have to. I hope so. Okay. It's

114
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:54,710
actually, I think it's double tap W or shift. Is it? I've shift doesn't do anything. All right.

115
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,629
That feels good. But just, I want to make this really clear to everybody watching right now.

116
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:03,049
I have a script running in the background to make it so I can toggle right click. How do you think

117
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:07,929
streams happen? There's a script. No, but listen, like you think the humor comes off top of the

118
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:13,850
head. There's a script. There's probably something that's going to need. There's probably something

119
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,330
that's going to need me to just tap right click. And you have to do it because I have a script.

120
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,370
Neither of us have responded to a single individual chatter on the entire streams. I did. I did like

121
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:29,539
five seconds ago. You just don't pay attention to your chat. Like I do. You don't know. I'm like

122
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:35,480
me and my chat get together. We know each other. All right. Follow the shot. We can actually run.

123
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:43,620
This is good. Oh, happy birthday. Is it your birthday? Holy shit. Thanks. Why did I say thanks?

124
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,779
Hey, is it your birthday? Yeah. Thanks dude. I'm so glad that you were born and you live.

125
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:57,100
All right. So I'll be honest with you. I got to be really honest with you.

126
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,549
Uh huh. I don't care about any of this. You don't care about my birthday?

127
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:12,009
Okay. Of course I care about your birthday. What? Why is everybody saying? Oh, the game's quiet.

128
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:21,210
Yeah, I know. I'm a quiet game, Andy. We're chasing somebody. So we missed the opening cut scene.

129
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:27,480
Yeah. Wait, this is in media res. This is going to be one of those. Okay. Really though? That's how

130
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,240
the real game opens. They start with like a badass action scene because they're afraid they're not

131
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,360
going to like catch your attention in time. So a helicopter is like scraping a train and then

132
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,240
the bad guy drops in and then they go, Oh, it's you again. And then it cuts to like three weeks

133
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,799
earlier and that's where we're at now. I thought I was playing the stacker game at the who's puking.

134
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:56,440
Did you see the birthday cake? I mean, I don't turn that up. All right. Is that better? I was

135
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,210
like, that was like grocery store birthday cake. It probably just in the bathroom.

136
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:07,019
Is that better? I can hear you now. Well, I just for the end game. I have it low.

137
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:13,259
Why can't I not fire my gun? Did you try to shoot me at the same time? No, I'm sure. I, why do we

138
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:20,759
have any body? We don't have bullets in our weapons that we brought here. I'm going to put an orange

139
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,919
tip on the muzzle of this gun. This is giving me a headache because of how like shitty the frame

140
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:31,129
rate is for this. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Is your, uh, is your 30 80 not qualified for this

141
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:36,649
2012 video game? Does this look as bad as it does? It just looks awful. I mean, it looks like 2012,

142
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:42,259
but the frame rate's fine. My frame rate's all over the place. It's just really zoomed in.

143
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:53,340
Wait, you dropped your phone. I think it's off. I turned the V sync on and I capped frames to 60.

144
00:16:53,340 --> 00:17:05,299
I did that too. Maybe it's trying to render 120. That's weird. I might have to fix this

145
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:08,500
eventually. All right. What, once we get like into this, cause you need to, let's fix it now.

146
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,680
Well, no, cause we need to save point cause I don't want to do this again. Let's get to like a point.

147
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,690
We call them checkpoints as cameras. All right. Search the campus for Liz.

148
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,640
I, I don't understand why we have our guns out holding it like this.

149
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,319
We don't have bullets. Why would we have them out? There we go. That's a book and that's what

150
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:39,160
I'm talking about. How do you melee? Um, take out a knife and you can swing the knife. I think

151
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,200
you can kick without that. You, there's like, there's like a, there's like a melee dedicate.

152
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,160
That guy didn't get scared at all. Why did he not get scared?

153
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:59,500
Should we be looking for weapons? The lights are on. Oh, in here.

154
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:09,460
Wait, I did. I do have ammo. It says I have 18. I have what? Oh, oh, okay. Now, now we have 17.

155
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:17,980
Where do you even see 17 coming out of my eyeballs? Oh no, we have a, we have an ear mounted.

156
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,940
Where do you see set? Like you have to physically count the bullets over there.

157
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,869
I don't know. I just took the number that you said. I think it's in the inventory.

158
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:31,930
All right. Don't do anything. Cool. I'm going to, I'm going to all tap for a second.

159
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:39,539
Hope you don't get booted. Okay. All right. This guy does not, nothing phases this guy.

160
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,940
He's the main character. That's quite a draft. He's leading us like we're the NPC on the follow

161
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,200
mission. He's escorting us. Why is he not reacting to any of this? I've seen some shit.

162
00:18:52,839 --> 00:19:00,900
Yeah. You have a hole in your head. I feel like somebody drilled a hole like that.

163
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,700
Demons are escaping you. Like your soul is escaping. Oh, from the light. You've got a light too.

164
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,420
Yeah. But it's, it's like a weird hole in your head. Like a luscious locks. Oh, you got Leon.

165
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,519
You got no brain in there, man. I can shine a flashlight in there and just see light.

166
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,079
Personal attacks. I'm your partner. I'm your resident partner for like the last 10 years in

167
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:24,039
this game. How are we going? I have some respect for the most popular resident evil character of

168
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:37,980
all time. Helena. Who is everybody knows Helena from the opening cut scene of this game. I don't

169
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,740
like the fact that we can't do just what happened. I thought he shot me. Does that hurt me? Uh,

170
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,420
that was a balloon jump scare. Oh, that was bad. I missed every shot. It's your daddy controller

171
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,220
has auto. He just say it's your daddy. I think we're looking for his daughter or something. I

172
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:01,509
don't know. Okay. Can we just kill him now? He's clearly infected. You don't know that though.

173
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:05,509
You're going to shoot him that you're going to do what I just tried to do. It didn't work.

174
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,420
Wait, is he running for president of the United States? Is this the same president?

175
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:22,420
Adam Benford. It's this guy. Okay. I just scared him. All right. The chandelier dropping and like

176
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,500
a fire starting in front of him is not scary, but he's like looking at like the constitution

177
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,819
of whatever this is. And it scared the shit out of him. Get ready to kill him. I will be once I

178
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:36,579
find my daughter. Hang on. Are you saying a politician is scared of the constitution

179
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:43,269
of the United States? Oh, that's so relevant. I think we have to open this. No, he's just opening

180
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:51,740
it. How do you reload? I have no idea. Wait, do we, we can't even reload. No extra ammo. Oh,

181
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,140
by the way, it's his fault if we die because he put, he said we should put it on veteran.

182
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:02,650
It's your fault. If we'd lose the medium difficulty, there's five difficulties.

183
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:08,250
Veterans, the third one, but I worked. That's just enough to not lose gamer points, but it's

184
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,769
also not enough to gain gamer points. I mean, I'm just saying we, we could have said we were on

185
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:19,779
veteran and plan easy. All right. So wait, wait, wait. So he, we have to make the elevator work.

186
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:30,339
Okay, wait, we need to, he's gliding over here. Okay. This is cool.

187
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,210
Resident Evil six is actually a walking simulator. The guns are kind of like in

188
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,289
universal studios when you go on ride, you know, they're just little laser points that you can

189
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:47,130
tally up at the end of the game. It is weird to not have the flashlight on the gun. It's like on

190
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:54,759
the side of our heads. 2012, that wasn't invented yet. You're not paying attention. Like extra

191
00:21:54,759 --> 00:22:00,809
dynamic light. Careful as it doesn't really matter if I'm paying attention. I have watched like at

192
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:04,490
least one or two Will Ferrell movies with no sound on and just like, I can know what's happening by

193
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:10,329
the movements that he's doing on screen. I got, it doesn't matter. Why do you have to take the left?

194
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:17,220
I don't know. I don't like your mother, like mom calls and like I want to talk to mom for like an

195
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:23,799
hour and a half, which is just the exact runtime of like Will Ferrell's last movie. I didn't even

196
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:35,450
aim and it did it for me. Yeah. How long, how long is it like a phone call with mom? It's usually

197
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:40,009
like an hour or two, right? Yeah. Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Why is everyone question marking?

198
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,759
Are you saying that playing this game is like, call it reminds you of calling your mom?

199
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,940
No, I'm just saying a Will Ferrell movie is the exact length of time for a phone call with mom.

200
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,940
Yeah. So next time you're watching a Will Ferrell movie, just think about the last time you called

201
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:04,579
your mom and then mute the Will Ferrell movie. 10 minutes. Excuse me. You got to talk to mom longer

202
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:08,759
than that. That depends on if you, if, okay, but here's the thing you're talking to a bunch of

203
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:14,359
people who still live with mom. So they can't fathom calling her because she's in the other room.

204
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:19,559
I would, I would agree with that maybe a little bit, but we did a poll, we did like a census on

205
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:26,920
the channel and it's like 40% doctor, 20% scientist. Um, there's like 10% uh, like

206
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:35,160
firefighter and shit. Like these people, they're not just like at home. Okay. You got, you got like

207
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:42,059
a large proportion of firefighting moms in chat. When do we get to play the game?

208
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:48,579
The one they're waiting for. Oh, they're waiting for us to go to the elevator.

209
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:54,039
Hold on. We're going to have to move this. It's going to take both of our combined strength.

210
00:23:54,039 --> 00:24:01,670
Is it really? Oh, it does. We're here. This whole game so far has been just like

211
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:08,259
your annoying upstairs neighbor in your apartment. It's just been the fucking sounds like the walking

212
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:16,859
sounds. Oh, the creaking boards. Okay. Oh, this is so ugly. I'm really sorry for everybody that has

213
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:28,339
to put up with this for now. There was entire fan base is milked. I can't imagine like that.

214
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:36,599
Like, no magic doing like a meet and greet. It's like all like older women. It's all like,

215
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,039
just do they are for the meet and greet. If you stay a streamer long enough,

216
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:57,829
make that a reality. I mean, I'm almost 40, man. That's called daytime TV.

217
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,799
What cry is that? I thought that, I thought that was the game. He just like freaked me out.

218
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:27,349
I was like, why are they leaning so hard into that? Got to do the puking off screen. This is

219
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:31,509
a hard. So let's, let's, let's get this ready. I'm going to shoot, I'm going to shoot them in

220
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:37,049
the head. You shoot them in the chest. We're going to shoot them five times each. Now I'm going to

221
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:40,410
shoot. I'm going to shoot once in the head. All right. I don't think you have a choice.

222
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:47,450
What the fuck is this one? What was that? What was that? Like DDR? Like 300. It was just DDR.

223
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,140
Why is the camera? I thought that was her doing that to you for a second.

224
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,500
It's like, why did you have the gun? Did you pull the trigger or was that all of me? I shot,

225
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,390
I shot him. I shot her in the back. Is it arrow keys? I think, I think it's just WASD correlates.

226
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,549
We'll get used to it. This is going to get really difficult with the QTs on keyboard.

227
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:18,329
How could this? I was about to scream it, but I, you're in, I don't, I feel like. It's like a yawn.

228
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:24,920
Now I want to. I was about to scream it, but there's a lot of people that were really pissed

229
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,240
off about that. So I'm glad. What do you mean don't let them in? There is. Don't let this guy in.

230
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:41,079
Oh, there's too many people on the elevator. I can't. All right. We have to get this way.

231
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:50,069
Bang. Bingo. Boink. How do you reload? I don't have any bullets left. Run. We have no other

232
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:56,680
bullets yet. Oh, that guy's got a pipe. How do you, how do you dash? I don't think there is one.

233
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:09,269
Definitely. That's our cue to get the hell out of here. Oh, it's space. Space? What do you mean

234
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:17,029
space? Hold space. Oh, that's weird. Okay. I feel like this is somebody pretending to run.

235
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:20,390
It's not somebody actually running. Okay. That actually

236
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:36,660
reminds me after this cut scene, I'll show you. Dude, does like security guards actually have this

237
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,529
many screens? Yeah, I think so. Are those two people who've been banned from your channel?

238
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:51,980
Let us back in. I promise. I promise. I won't ask to see your shit filled diaper again. I promise.

239
00:27:54,549 --> 00:28:00,869
Get him. Get him, Marge. Leon, it's too late. We can do.

240
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:10,019
Or space twice when you're aimed in. Okay. Oh, I was explicitly told to not talk about diapers.

241
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:15,509
Explicitly. Yeah. Like, I'm not even kidding. Probably at least three or four people. Get the

242
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:21,900
hell out of here. You must have struck a nerve. I just was told don't do that. It's like fucking

243
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:31,259
weird. It's been at least, at least three people have told me that. All right. Pause for a sec.

244
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,859
Okay. I need turn sensitivity like. Yes. All the way down.

245
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:41,450
Somebody said you can, if you double tap space. What the hell are you doing? Oh, it's like a dodge.

246
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:50,549
Oh, holy shit. What? Are you seeing this? I can't focus on the settings because I'm stupid.

247
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,019
This is like the easiest way to get a bunch of like splinters all over your body.

248
00:28:57,109 --> 00:29:04,390
Okay, that's cool. I wonder, do we share stuff on the ground? I wonder.

249
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:11,589
Oh, yeah, I can see that from my perspective. All right. Do we share what? Do we share items

250
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:14,309
like on the ground? Because I just picked up ammo and if there's no ammo on the ground,

251
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:29,859
then this is bad. Oh, look. Control settings. Can I break boxes? I don't think so. Is it camera

252
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:36,809
speed? It's, yeah. Camera speed is, and then there's aim speed too. Aim speed? Okay. Aim

253
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,490
speed is when you're aimed down sights and camera speed is just you walking around. There we go.

254
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,849
And if you put it at zero, don't worry. It's every video game ever made.

255
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:50,089
It's still horrible. You have to go, you have to go from zero to two out of sometimes potentially

256
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:57,509
a hundred. I still don't understand why that's a thing. All right. It is a PC video game.

257
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:04,490
Double tap space when not aiming. My run looks like I'm about to like go on stage at a Broadway.

258
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:10,390
Okay. Now I think you have to be, okay. So when you're aiming, if you hold the direction in

259
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:22,869
space, you'll dive and then you can get back up. All right. You ready? Overly complex, but yep.

260
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:33,079
Wait, hold on. Oh shit. That's actually kind of cool. Why do people say this is the worst one?

261
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:45,099
Jump down the stairs. They need to bring back the matrix games. I think they just kind of,

262
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:51,819
they overdid it with every video game having like a jump slow down that ever it just became

263
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:58,440
taboo to ever do it again. Even I have items too. I feel like we're just skipping everything.

264
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,559
Oh yeah. You got, you picked up the ammo. I didn't get any, you didn't get any ammo. Oh,

265
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:06,359
that's not good. Unless, uh, unless I just didn't look where you look about this.

266
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:13,690
We break the stuff. Bad feeling about this. Is that, is that the, be honest,

267
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,779
is that the voice actor for Levi? I don't know. It might be. Is that the, is that the,

268
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:23,819
I'm not going to do it because it's, it's hollowed ground, but uh, you know, the potentials there

269
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,180
to do like to do captain Levi from attack on Titan.

270
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:41,049
Don't you fucking dare to get that into my blood. How dare you do that. There's two things that

271
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:46,390
you were told when we in the private discord together is do not mention attack on Titan,

272
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,269
especially any of the main characters. That was one of the things that, and you, and you did,

273
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:53,579
you clicked, you did like the thumbs up emote on the fucking text on discord too. So I know you

274
00:31:53,579 --> 00:32:06,809
saw it. Where we go? We got to go to, we got to go to class. Oh, press E while aiming. Sorry.

275
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:18,740
Oh shit. You can do double pistol. Why would we be hiding? Oh, somebody fell asleep on the stream

276
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:30,309
again. Oh, dual welding. Yep. Dual welding. I'm just picking up all the ammo. Is that,

277
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:34,630
I hope you're not mad about that. Uh, I got ammo on that one. Do you get ammo on this guy?

278
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,109
Those skill points. Do you get skill points on this guy? I think there actually is skills

279
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:42,890
in this game. I really do. Wait, do we have like a, do we have like a tree?

280
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:46,569
I actually think we do. All right. So what, we're in the wrong place here.

281
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:54,329
Resident sleeper six. Yep. It made it is good one chat. No, that, that actually is a good one

282
00:32:54,329 --> 00:33:02,009
because this one is the worst one. Was that probably just ambient sound effect. Oh, I thought the

283
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:10,250
soda machine just broke. I was okay. All right. You know what? Can I just talk about how stupid

284
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:19,660
video games are? We can just walk over that. Help me. I've wasted so much ammo. I don't know why.

285
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:24,859
How do you do a wheel? Why can't we just walk over this? Video games are dumb. I hate them.

286
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:39,259
Look out. I have to stop fucking around because I'm seriously going to not have enough. You shoot

287
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:42,779
for, okay, you're going to have to shoot for another hour because I just used an hour of ammo.

288
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,019
Please do good because that was probably the next 45 minutes of in-game ammo.

289
00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:58,309
What's the melee button? Uh, you've got a knife. I think you can just do the,

290
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,920
I've got a shotgun. Wait, why do you have a shotgun? Because we're different people.

291
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,480
Okay. You don't, you don't have to be like me. Well, you get a shotgun and I get a knife. Oh,

292
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,960
it's because I've paid for Capcom plus. Yeah. Yeah. I, by the way, I know you still were paying

293
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:18,250
for that. Uh-huh. Go ahead. Everybody tell you can, it's a confession here. Go ahead. Tell them.

294
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:27,610
I am still paying for Ubisoft plus. I forgot to cancel it and I still paid less for far cry than

295
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:35,559
you did. But I didn't look like a geek with all the, I paid for the items shit. So who really won?

296
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:46,619
Oh my God. I had like, help. I have neon. I have neon armor. Are you really, are you going to help

297
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:54,090
me with a knife? Holy shit. Okay. Wait, there's herbs. Don't forget to pick those up. I got them.

298
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:58,409
Do you want me to craft you a heel? Um, what's like the, is it an eye? How do you get to the

299
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:06,300
inventory? E. Okay. What the fuck is this inventory? I don't know how to scroll over.

300
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:11,829
How do you go down? Oh, it's mouse wheel. Okay. Mouse wheel and what's on the, what's down the

301
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:16,710
bottom? What's all this weird shit here? It's probably like, uh, actual usables. Oh, okay.

302
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:24,869
Like materials up top, full product down below. Um, all right. That's probably the, I really

303
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:32,059
don't want to be like a dick or anything. And I hate to say this. This is 2012. It was a different

304
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:37,340
time. They were doing the resident evils had the same UIs since like fucking 1996. So I don't buy

305
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:46,170
that. They were trying to get creative. They wanted everything to be in game. This is a fucking

306
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,809
horizontal metal gear, solid inventory and a holy shit. I hate that inventory system. I'm sorry.

307
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:56,230
Oh yeah. No, it's bad. It's bad. You got any dual wield? Okay. How do you do that?

308
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,510
Just a melee. Holy shit. I said a diamond cutter to somebody. I literally just RKO that person.

309
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:12,519
What? That was awesome. Yeah. Do it again. Um, no reason for me to waste any ammo.

310
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:18,280
That metal gear. So it was an amazing game. I just, I don't like the inventory.

311
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:28,840
This is a three shot double barrel shotgun. No, it's a triple barrel shotgun. Oh, incendiary

312
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:42,150
grenade. Cool. Go to the security gate. It'll lead you off the campus. Go. Resident evil five is the

313
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:50,809
Mona Lisa of video games compared to this. Um, well when Mona Lisa of video games,

314
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:55,610
but when you have to understand something, this is like, this is the same tier of games that come

315
00:36:55,610 --> 00:37:02,059
in the cereal box. So that's not fair. Well, you can say, he said, first of all, I want to know.

316
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:05,260
I've seen Mona Lisa in real life and honestly, it wasn't that impressive.

317
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:14,219
It's smaller than you think. What the fuck? Yeah. Okay. There's like a spam button. Uh,

318
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:32,409
PT. Sorry. Does that hit me? Yeah. Body is falling apart. And I actually can, I want that.

319
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:38,969
And I picked that up. The sledgehammer that just disappeared. No, I don't think you can.

320
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:43,610
That's an unforgivable sin in video games when there's items that people are using and you can't

321
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:54,300
have them. You've just played too much, uh, dead rising. It was unforgivable. If there's a swinging

322
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,139
animation that the character is using and that falls on the ground, it's an actual, its own object.

323
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:05,340
It's a piece, it's a placement of graphical input, unity, whatever it is. If it was made with unity.

324
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,579
No, I'm just saying like if it's in the engine, then why can't I use it?

325
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:19,940
I want to fight with balloons and this flagpole. Why can't I use that? Graphical and input unity.

326
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:41,670
Graphical input user. How do I get to the grenade? Is this a college? G? It's not G. Does it not look

327
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:46,550
like I am doing some kind of like stage dance when I run? Okay. You stand, no, no, stand right

328
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:50,940
there at the door, but like turn around. I can't. I can see everything you're doing though. Okay.

329
00:38:50,940 --> 00:39:00,019
Hold on. Am I, am I off screen? You are off screen stage left for me. Okay. Hold on. Does

330
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:04,980
it's like the, the motion of my arms, not. You just look like you're running around.

331
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,360
I'm so patiently waiting for you at the door. I'm just looking. I see everything you're doing,

332
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,360
but I'm not going to acknowledge it for some reason. This is so normal that I'm just going

333
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:23,900
to give you a minute and then you're eventually going to come over here. Okay. That was very

334
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:29,929
normal. Keep that trigger finger ready. Okay. There were no, what's around the next corner.

335
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:38,659
Wait. Okay. Ammo. We stopped doing that. We need those to like distract them. No,

336
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:42,980
cause we're, this is a fighting hall. We're going to try the door. Something's going to be jammed.

337
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,099
We're going to turn around. They're all going to come to life and we have to fight out the door.

338
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:58,869
So Alex, it's just going to open. Watch. Oh yeah. Then again, the door's locked. I told you I called

339
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:06,500
this a hundred percent. That's corner pocket. All right. This is, which is, this is just literally

340
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,659
like left for dead right now. All right. Skill points. Just wait till they come in. Who cares?

341
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:14,659
Don't even shoot. Actually, we probably should shoot them. I mean, yeah, they're going to,

342
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:23,380
they're going to commit. How was it? You half your head has gone. Wait till they get in at

343
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:30,170
least so you can get skill points. Just threw a bottle at me. The melee is better than shooting

344
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:37,500
a gun. I'm just telling you. I'm tripping over their body.

345
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:50,940
The Bailey's better. I have a shotgun. If I can upgrade this, I will. Why am I just falling down?

346
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:56,570
Okay. But an FOV is actually pretty bad. That person just,

347
00:40:57,449 --> 00:41:01,429
okay. So this is what you're talking about. The X pick up the X and you pick it up.

348
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:11,130
Wow. Sick wrestling move. You're going to die?

349
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:20,650
What just happened? Did you just kill me? You just hit me in the face with something.

350
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:27,369
What'd you hit me with? You shot me in the head. You shot me directly in the face.

351
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,769
I'm dead again. What's happening? Where's my health meter?

352
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:38,940
You died again. But wait, we're dead. What? I feel like this is an arcade game we've put coins into.

353
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:47,239
It's like deliberately shitty and bad and hard. We'll find out where the checkpoint is,

354
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:53,210
I guess. Oh, it's right here. It's right here. Keep that trigger finger ready.

355
00:41:53,210 --> 00:42:00,099
Know what's around the next corner. Oh, foreshadowing. By the way, that's totally

356
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:11,670
Levi. Probably is. There's a stamina meter. Okay. So the right top bar is health and the bar

357
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,389
underneath that is stamina. All right. We know what this does. Let's skip this.

358
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:22,840
We can't skip this. We have to live it. And again, the door's locked. There's no way out.

359
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,949
Zombies don't know how to do that. I'm it's so dumb. Like zombies that like dodge,

360
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:34,469
like juke a bullet gun shooting at them. It's like that's stupid.

361
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:42,780
I don't know. Maybe the first 45 minutes. Okay. Well, prepare yourself.

362
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:49,380
Are you prepared? What's that from? I don't know. Oh, you didn't play any of those.

363
00:42:53,190 --> 00:43:06,199
Yes. You're right. Yeah, I'm good. We probably should like just stay back.

364
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,460
Just stay back here. You're too close. They're surrounding you right now.

365
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,860
It's surrounding the cool melee. We just have to live. We're in veteran. You made us do this.

366
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:20,099
Yeah, it's not even that hard. Okay. I'm not the one that died. How do I throw a grenade?

367
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:28,019
Holy shit. What the hell happened? Her head. But her head like melted off. You like slowly

368
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:33,739
simmered her head until it came off. That was like, like a tender like pork roast.

369
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:43,989
All right. You got, you got it. Reload it. Concentrate.

370
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:55,510
Kill points. It's like actually a hundred lootables on the ground.

371
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:01,989
Yeah, I know. Get rid of the Diablo to this. Nope. What? Sorry. You wanted all that stuff.

372
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:06,150
Oh my God. Are you kidding me? What am I supposed to do?

373
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:18,260
I think you just WASD really fast. I want to throw the grenade.

374
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,179
Fortified windows of that hallway could not hold them. This single wooden plank will.

375
00:44:22,179 --> 00:44:27,300
What the fuck? How? Why can I not? I don't know how to pick up the grenade.

376
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:37,719
Define pickup. Like it's in your pocket already. It's F. What the fuck? First A. Oh, okay.

377
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,940
All right. So I have it. Cool. How do you like, we need to get the key card.

378
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:54,360
Yeah. How do you equip a heel? Oh, you have to manually do it. Press E. And then click it.

379
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:01,559
Combine with R for some God forsaken reason. Well, because you, one of each color is a mega

380
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:12,170
herb. So combine this with, I'll do this with red. So that's a, I made a six. All right.

381
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:19,989
You also then have to highlight the herb. Yeah. Press space, then press space again to store it

382
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:28,119
in your case. And then once it's stored in your case, then I don't know. It's gone. It's there

383
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:34,489
though. I was just, I almost just threw away bullets. All right. Um, there's also like,

384
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:41,369
you can hold Q to turn the entire game. Press one. Oh, what the fuck dude? Don't say that. I

385
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:45,369
just made an herb. Why did you say, what are you doing? Don't tell me to do that. What the fuck?

386
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:55,030
Are you healthy now? I, I already was. I'm not pressing two. There's something here. Oh,

387
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:05,530
free stuff. There's a key over this way somewhere. Oh, nice. Not alive. They changed.

388
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:12,019
They changed it. When's the next rock out break? I just want to chill. Um, this is not a thing.

389
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:17,449
This is not something you can pick up. I just opened this drawer. That looks like an item that

390
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:20,730
you put in a door resident evil style. Right? Why, what, what is it? Why can't we not

391
00:46:21,699 --> 00:46:26,949
collect serpent? I just broke it. Oh, that's the thing you destroy and you eventually get to

392
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:34,949
unlock stuff. Okay. Okay. I don't do the rock outs anymore. The last time I did it,

393
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:39,909
the rock outs. Yeah. Just like, I used to do this thing where I would just like put a song on and

394
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:44,920
like air drum and shit, but people thought it was like we could cringy and I got a lot of shit for

395
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:51,559
it. So what are you doing down there? What the fuck was that? Oh, okay. There was a zombie in

396
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:59,449
this room. I, I just stabbed. I just stabbed him in the face. Why am I? It'd be nice if I had a

397
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:07,639
heel. That'd be fantastic. Oh my fucking God. Whatever. Okay. So we're looking for a, uh,

398
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:13,820
we have to escape now. We're going to go this way through the fridge, through the refrigerator,

399
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:21,619
secret trap door fridge. Nope. You hold Q, you hold Q. Yeah. You get, you get a little thing where

400
00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:29,750
it shows you where to go. Nice try. Nice try. Their bodies are still physical objects even

401
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:35,530
after they're dead. So hang on. No, I didn't touch them. Resident evil does the thing.

402
00:47:37,909 --> 00:47:42,949
He's going to get you. Shoot him. Thank you. Well, you call it out. What have you ever played a first

403
00:47:42,949 --> 00:47:49,460
person? You go loading, you go reloading. E3 has already happened. I don't think they're going to

404
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:53,219
do the Ubisoft thing on the game awards. That's literally the worst thing they put in the game.

405
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:57,219
It's like the, the like super smash brothers brawl trip that they put in here for no reason.

406
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:14,570
Why is it in the game? What? All right. What is happening? Comic book falls. I felt like I had

407
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:21,139
so many times. Yeah. It's resident evil. I'm just going to be spamming R like, look, it's just

408
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:27,380
hit our, our, our, our, our. Nice try. Cause this skill points on the ground.

409
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:33,380
It's the room we were just in before, right? We can pick this stuff up. Yeah. Did you,

410
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,099
did you not, while we were walking back through, I kind of wait a minute. So you,

411
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:41,449
so you picked everything up already. You see a single thing on the ground. No, I did. So I

412
00:48:41,449 --> 00:48:44,969
think we do have separate stuff. What if, what if, what if one of us picks it up and it gives it to

413
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:50,860
both of us, but also I have a shotgun. So you're not going to get like a shotgun ammo. I love

414
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,340
sandwiches like this, like the triangle sandwiches at like a party. Did you know

415
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:59,260
that all sandwiches can be triangles? If you just, if you just cut them the right way in half.

416
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:03,269
Yeah, but that's fine. But I'm saying I like when it's that style.

417
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,820
I did not, I did not purpose that by saying all sandwiches are triangles.

418
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:13,179
Yeah. But you said I love this kind of sandwich. Like you could have that every time.

419
00:49:13,179 --> 00:49:20,199
Yeah. But it's a kind of pain in the ass sandwiches do taste better if you cut them in half though.

420
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:30,230
No, I hit you. They're very good. I love sandwiches. Sandwiches like probably one of my top three.

421
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:43,780
What are you doing? You still over there? I can't see what's going on behind me.

422
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:51,849
I just know that you're in some trouble. I'm just a one V wanting the strongest blue collar

423
00:49:51,849 --> 00:49:58,500
zombie in the entire game. I can't, I actually can't get out of this. Oh, there we go. There is a

424
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:10,179
stamina. What about what are your top sandwich shapes? Um, sub role probably number one. Sure.

425
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:18,650
I'd say also up at S tier is it's a euro a sandwich. Um, yeah, probably. Okay. Probably

426
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:26,469
for this argument, maybe you just walk through a metal detector. Well, we're going to put our

427
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:30,550
weapons in there. We can't like, you have to go through it. Oh, we got to run. Oh,

428
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:40,869
that's what I was getting. This game does the thing like an unforgivable survival horror sin,

429
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:46,789
where there's people who you think are not alive. Oh my God. That guy hit me in the fucking head

430
00:50:46,789 --> 00:50:52,150
with that axe. Why does my entire screen go white and blue when that happens? What is going on with

431
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:58,780
me? But that's when you got hit. I don't know what happened. I got hit with an accident. Am I dead?

432
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:06,949
Are we like symbiotically linked or something? Why? Why do I feel your pain? Because my entire

433
00:51:06,949 --> 00:51:11,829
screen flashes white and blue and it happens to you. I don't know. Is this specific rimming

434
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:19,130
right now? Are we, are we, uh, getting drift compatible? I need to heal. I have a red,

435
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:30,710
I still don't understand what I'm looking at here. Okay. All right. This is the third,

436
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:35,110
that was the third try. They give you zombies on the ground, but you're not allowed to shoot them

437
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:41,030
until the game lets you. Oh, I see what you mean. Right. The play dead zombies, but you could in a

438
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:45,750
bunch of other survival horror games, you can, if you shoot them, they go and die. Yeah. Yeah.

439
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:53,300
I feel like we've been watching the trailer for this game the whole time we've been playing.

440
00:51:54,260 --> 00:52:04,900
I feel like we haven't started playing. It's a long trailer. Watch out, watch out, watch out.

441
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:14,250
What the fuck? Oh, he was a fucking hunter from left for dead. I don't know how many more of these

442
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:18,570
I have. I have an unlimited number. I need to eat more of these like pills.

443
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:35,960
How much do I have to eat? Wait, I have a grenade. What's the grenade button again? F.

444
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:47,130
All right. Watch out. What the fuck, dude? I'm dead again. I think you're shooting me with the

445
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:53,300
shotgun. I did a kick. I did like a melee to try to help you. The top bar is your health.

446
00:52:54,260 --> 00:53:04,119
Don't shoot me, please. Watch out behind you. Do I have any more pills?

447
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:23,820
Just go, go, go, go, go. Just go, go, go. You all right? Oh, that was a big, that was a big

448
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,739
jumping somersault to make it to the car in time. How do I drive?

449
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:34,820
Are you sure? I'm looking for the keys to the car. Yeah, find the keys. They're breaking in.

450
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:41,159
They're not in the glove box. Why is this door the fucking explorer? Like, where are they?

451
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:46,679
You turn the windshield wipers on? Are they? Look up, look up.

452
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:57,219
Gamers never look up. Oh my god. I can't help you. I am a spectator in this hellscape.

453
00:53:57,219 --> 00:54:12,300
We drove, we drove 10 feet. Oh my god. All right, everyone's buckled. Can I drive the car?

454
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:22,949
I'm like in the, I'm like above the middle console right now. I just got to get through town.

455
00:54:22,949 --> 00:54:27,909
Made it off campus. This is actually like a realistic college simulator. It's the RA.

456
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:42,710
Okay, so that was, that was fun. We're dead. Shit. What are you doing, man? Don't put the

457
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:46,309
bong under the covers. What if he looks at your bed? Helena, are you two all right?

458
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:53,449
All right, hang on, hang on. We need another way to the cathedral. How do we get out of here?

459
00:54:55,449 --> 00:55:04,469
Turn on subtitles. Did that work? And then the really funny thing happens where like,

460
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:08,710
I took a huge hit from the bong before. I thought you were gonna say shit.

461
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:14,389
Yeah, I took a huge shit before the RA comes in. Oh my god, it's cleaning day.

462
00:55:14,389 --> 00:55:17,829
No, it's cleaning day. There's a huge shit. I can't flush it. We have to go to,

463
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:23,909
you're disgusting. Stop it. Um, like the comedy movie thing where like I take a huge bong rip

464
00:55:23,909 --> 00:55:28,250
and like the RA knock, knock, knock at the door and then I have to hold that in because like,

465
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:32,820
oh my god, what if the comedy smoke will come out of my mouth and will he'll know?

466
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,900
And then you do like a huge guffaw like, like right after they leave.

467
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:52,809
Yep. You stole that joke. Okay. Every joke is stolen. It's called life experience.

468
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:59,239
What's the matter? You stole that.

469
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:10,469
Matthew Mercer is the voice of Leon here. Yeah, it's him. It's been confirmed.

470
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,909
I would want, I do gotta have some shades there. I hate that when the sun's just beaming through.

471
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:40,329
You gotta get the glasses that have both little flip ups.

472
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:49,400
Holy shit, it would suck to be in this room. Yeah, honestly, they need to fix the electricity

473
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:58,469
in the White House. This is unacceptable. Natural lighting only. He's old enough,

474
00:56:58,469 --> 00:57:02,389
but he would definitely be one of those like, turn the lights on or you're going to like

475
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:07,429
burn your eyes out trying to read that book. You know, my fucking dad's stuff.

476
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:15,510
Natural lighting is based. Yeah, that's what every magazine told you. And then you actually

477
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:20,710
have it. And once you get so much natural light into a room and like your head hurts.

478
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:27,050
Let's get moving. We don't have much time. Certainly got our work cut out for us.

479
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:31,530
Oh, halogen lamps only. I know. No, I'm not those either.

480
00:57:32,489 --> 00:57:36,739
Florescence. I have just like those, you know, those like fluorescent bulbs that the long tubes.

481
00:57:37,699 --> 00:57:39,059
Yeah, you know, the ones that go

482
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:54,860
Yeah, no, they're all of my whole movie lights. Yes. I like my house to maintain the abandoned

483
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:59,500
warehouse. Look, we'll be at a contact. I know exactly what you mean. Actually, I need heels,

484
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:09,019
but be careful. Oh, hold on. I think I figured it out. So the the number of the dots that are on

485
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:15,639
the herb is how many times you can take the pill, right? Is it? I think that's what that means.

486
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:22,860
He finally gets it. This is a dumb feature. Yeah, like, okay, the number at the bottom

487
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:29,340
right with the green leap. What's what's your number? Zero. I have nine. You do? Uh huh.

488
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:37,130
Can I have one? Yeah. Can we actually trade or no? I was about to unload the whole clip into your

489
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:46,619
head. All right. Let's we need to go to the cathedral. Taking the train to church. There

490
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:54,070
is no sprint. Yeah, you're right. There's no sprint. I'm just I'm just like twice as fast as you

491
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:58,869
deal with that zombie. How do I do it? What's sprint? It's space. Why is it space? That's right.

492
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:06,019
Why is it space? Why? Why is it space? Exactly what I just sounded like. And I did that for a

493
00:59:06,019 --> 00:59:10,340
funny comedic joke thing. So you got it. Chad voice. Watch out. Watch out.

494
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:22,539
You got to save bullets. Watch out behind you. Watch out. Actually, let's just keep going.

495
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,179
Yeah. Why? There's no reason to stop. There really isn't.

496
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:33,019
All right. How do you heal? One. It'll take one pill and you can take one pip. You heal. You heal

497
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:39,079
one pip at a time and I think you can just spam it. Oh, there's a train coming by the way.

498
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,719
Space plus R.

499
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:55,719
I was hitting space and D. Space and R. What is it? What do you mean R? Why is it? Oh, that's

500
00:59:55,719 --> 01:00:03,130
reload. I don't think I got it either. I think it just clipped you first. Space and hold on.

501
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:10,469
That's the canon ending. The thing is, isn't space and D dive? Why is it space and R? All right,

502
01:00:10,469 --> 01:00:20,219
just run. How do you tell like this story by the way, like Leon, the professional zombie hunter?

503
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:30,309
All right. Space plus R. I swear to God, I did it. I actually did it. I don't get it.

504
01:00:30,949 --> 01:00:38,710
It's because I have the script. I have to tell that story. Helena is a survivor in one of these

505
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:46,710
timelines. You go find your family. Oh, okay. Well, you do it. You do it. I did do it. Space

506
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:53,849
and R. And I think my script that I have is fucking up this whole thing. Okay. Space and R.

507
01:00:56,010 --> 01:01:04,780
Okay. I got it. I was doing like space then R. No, I wasn't doing it at the same exact time. I

508
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:12,579
tried to, but dying restores your health. Oh shit. It actually does. That's a strat.

509
01:01:12,579 --> 01:01:23,960
There's a zombie dog. Where? Dead, dead ahead. Oh, well, do we know if it's friendly?

510
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:42,199
It's got red eyes. He could be barking at somebody behind us. I, okay. Yeah. Oh my

511
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:50,940
jeez. He's probably barking at the train. Okay. What do we do with the skill point stuff?

512
01:01:53,289 --> 01:01:58,090
I have no idea. Why are you guys doing this? They're attacking us. It's like a mutated zombie

513
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:05,929
dog. I did it. I released the pathogen. Well, who's something going on here? Why are there

514
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:09,690
so many people in the subway? That's the question. Oh fuck. I think I killed that guy.

515
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:26,340
What do you mean? There's a train. Oh my God. Okay. I don't, I think we, maybe we could have

516
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:32,300
saved that. All right. You have so much health. Let me take this one. Take what? Get high. You

517
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:39,500
guys should get high. No. Is that why they have so many herbs? Well, they want me to be high,

518
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:44,460
like in play. And I, I have, but I have sworn that off forever. Ever since I couldn't read the

519
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:56,139
analog clock on camera. Oh, good shot. Why is that one on fire? I think, uh, yeah, I think we have

520
01:02:56,139 --> 01:03:02,780
to turn that off. Um, what, what happened? What did I just get hit with? They're throwing shit.

521
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:06,619
What do you mean they throw shit? They just get stuck and then they throw their, look, they

522
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:11,420
throw it again. You just hit the guy in front of them. Well, they're going to, we don't even

523
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:22,809
waste ammo on the guys in the back. Cool stuff. I'm just trying to conserve ammo because I'm

524
01:03:22,809 --> 01:03:29,420
terrible. Oh, you can. Oh, so if they have a weapon, you do it for your finish move. It's,

525
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:33,820
I want to carry it around. So how do we, I'm so sorry. How do we turn that off? I thought

526
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,579
that was in the game. Was that, that wasn't in the game. That was a coffee leg kick up. Uh,

527
01:03:38,539 --> 01:03:46,099
I think I, do we destroy it? I can't tell. I don't know. Co-op moment up here. Can I reach this

528
01:03:46,099 --> 01:03:59,320
with the range? I think. Yeah, I can. I, I don't know why I don't know this about this game. I

529
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:04,860
feel like we still not playing the game yet. That's probably because we did not see the prologue or

530
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:13,800
the first cut scene. Is that explode? That's a red barrel. See, look, this, this is a pretend zombie

531
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,920
over on the wall. Yeah, I know. And we can't exactly see him now. You're right. Yeah, that's,

532
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:29,219
that's stupid. Was there anything in this? No. Yeah, I had something. Uh, use your knife so you

533
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:36,230
don't waste, uh, bullets. I don't have a knife. I have, uh. Okay. Come on. Are there items here for

534
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:45,829
you? Yeah. Okay. So we, we, we do both get our own stuff. Is there a train here? You go first.

535
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:50,869
It is, it is a rail. Yeah, but I don't know if it's going to be an immediate. Oh, there's a secret.

536
01:04:51,900 --> 01:05:00,230
Is there? All right. I got it. I got this. All right. So we're a hundred percent in this or else,

537
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:15,690
how many gifts ups? Um, zero. Careful. Okay. I'll give you a, I'll give you zero gifts. So do you

538
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:21,460
just see how far you can get over the electricity? No, I don't know. No gift subs. No gifts. That was

539
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:32,489
the point. Yeah. Is it zero shadows? Yeah. Do you have grenades? Oh, I don't moving in humanly fast.

540
01:05:32,489 --> 01:05:37,449
And I, I mean, even for like zombies. They are. All right. Is there a barrel? Does that explode?

541
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:43,989
All right. I think we just have to run, take out the first. Yeah. We just run, just run, run, run,

542
01:05:43,989 --> 01:05:55,909
run. They are really good at predicting movement. Are you good? Oh, you don't look good. Are you good?

543
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:06,710
Are you good? I'm good. I'm just waiting. You're most grumpy. I'm not a grub. What are you talking

544
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:09,989
about? I'm very, I'm happy right now. This is train coming, train coming, which would from its

545
01:06:09,989 --> 01:06:15,429
wrecking. It's behind us. It's behind us. It's behind us. I didn't get a prompt. What?

546
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:19,989
I think you have to be looking at it or no, you get to be on the other side of the track.

547
01:06:19,989 --> 01:06:31,829
There's two tracks. Where's the prompt? Oh, we didn't get a prompt. It's been giving us prompts.

548
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:39,880
Whatever. I was sitting there waiting with, I was, okay. I was hovering. I was hovering my hand over

549
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:44,440
space and are just ready to press it. Yeah. I was too. You're not going to get the collectible again.

550
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:55,210
Not even a real game. Oh, I thought, I thought we shared that. Okay. So now we just have to go to

551
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:58,809
the other side. Yeah. So just who cares? It's going to do the dumb puppet show where it shows

552
01:06:58,809 --> 01:07:11,449
those scary things and we just run by it. This is a nightmare. I keep having this vision of you

553
01:07:11,449 --> 01:07:19,380
getting splattered by a train at high speed. It trains on the other side. Yep. Okay. It's definitely

554
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:34,199
going to switch. So just stay in the middle. What happened? Why? I think you got caught in

555
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:43,110
between the cars. I did not. You went into the middle prematurely. Hold on. Too much air just

556
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:51,190
came out of my fucking mouth. It was so stupid. Honest to God, I'm not, what happened? I did not

557
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:57,719
even come close. The train was already by dude. I swear to God. It was like over halfway by.

558
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:11,030
That's so stupid. This game sucks. It's the cut scene trigger. Yep. But that's the best part.

559
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:16,869
But I did not understand the cut scene trigger was going to be here. Right? Like right on the

560
01:08:16,869 --> 01:08:21,670
edge. The train is like a boss and you can touch the boss and you die. No, the hitbox is huge.

561
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:28,649
I'm telling you, just stay really far to the left. The hitbox is monumental. I want to know

562
01:08:28,649 --> 01:08:32,569
what it looks like when I get hit by the train. You might see it because the hitbox is huge.

563
01:08:40,939 --> 01:08:46,779
Okay. Now we can just, I thought it was going to happen again. I thought it happened to you.

564
01:08:47,500 --> 01:09:02,920
Apparently this is our ride. Okay. Very good. Can't open it. We're not getting that open.

565
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:08,680
There's a illuminated latch on top. Boost me up on top. Somebody just said I've got stuck at this

566
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:17,000
part for 45 minutes. Good luck. I can't wait. What the hell did I shoot you? Yeah,

567
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,199
directly in the fucking back of the head. The shotgun spread is insane.

568
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:30,359
Also, I can't believe friendly fire is on by default. Okay. Are you going to boost me?

569
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:39,399
Hold on. I hate this inventory. It sucks. Okay. So click on this, say send to, how do I send this

570
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:43,720
to my? You send it to desktop and then you're going to want to right click, zip it, and then

571
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:53,220
email it to me. But how, how do I do that? You're a hater. I hate this game. Well, who can, yes.

572
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:06,170
It's space. Okay. How do I get up? I'm not grumpy. I hate this game. What, there's a difference.

573
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:10,250
I'm just kidding. I like this game. Okay. So there's, why can I not send this to my inventory?

574
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:21,829
It doesn't say I have one heel. Mannequins that are definitely come to life.

575
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:30,279
Open this. Did I just use keys? I think I have to wait for you. Yeah. As soon as I dropped in,

576
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:41,109
keep your car. Oh, nice. Here comes a rage stream. Watch out.

577
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:58,260
Maybe those ones are actually. I tell you guys that somebody said that they heard that in a game

578
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:03,720
and they like freaked out that sound. They heard that sound that I always do. And they were like,

579
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:08,680
it fucking ruined the whole game for me. I couldn't even play it again. What quiet screaming? No, the

580
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:17,659
you didn't. Why would you tell me that? That was, was that the whole story? Someone played a game.

581
01:11:17,659 --> 01:11:24,739
They heard that noise and didn't play it again. Yes. No, why would you tell me? I'm talking to

582
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:35,460
all of you. Not the only person here at town is like 150,000 other people here.

583
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:49,939
Watch out. They like the meltdown animation. The sludge zombie. Yeah, that's crazy.

584
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:59,640
Be careful. Be careful. Give me, I need a minute. What are you guys talking about?

585
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:04,630
There's a raid. Are you lying to me? I can't. Probably the most realistic bit about this game

586
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:09,739
is you have to do everything on your phone. Is there actually a raid? I can't see it.

587
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:20,250
Mod. Tell me the raid. You know, that actually looks like, um, who is that actual raid right now?

588
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:28,890
I need a mod. Blade Runner 2049. Uh, Lala land. I don't know. I don't think there was. That's

589
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:37,500
Ryan Gosling. Okay. That's all right. I got, I got lied to. Tell me that's not Ryan Gosling.

590
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:43,380
I see, I see Jared Leto more than Ryan Gosling. Yeah, I see that too. It's the hair and the,

591
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:50,539
and the mustache, but the face is Ryan Gosling. What the fuck happened? The guy was camping with

592
01:12:50,539 --> 01:13:03,000
an X. It's just, they're just gas lighting you. Okay. Because you're using this gas can.

593
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:11,619
That's my, that is my name. Yeah. I swear to God, this is going to turn on. Isn't it?

594
01:13:11,619 --> 01:13:16,579
Here comes it. Are you ready? I'm ready for space R. The train's not turning on. I mean, it's on.

595
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:24,020
No, we're just going to have, this is actually the matrix subway station. So you got to do

596
01:13:25,829 --> 01:13:33,829
the backwards. That's a, that's a person, right? I feel like I fell asleep on the couch like this

597
01:13:33,829 --> 01:13:39,979
last night. And that's like my whole body hurts now. Like this is how I slept. I hate that. I

598
01:13:39,979 --> 01:13:46,949
fell asleep before the stream woke up and I'm like, like you said, there's no chapter.

599
01:13:46,949 --> 01:13:53,539
It's got like a bomb. We're in like an extended trailer for this game. How do you switch to bomb?

600
01:13:55,220 --> 01:14:00,180
It's a weird combination in the inventory. I have no idea. Cause I can see it from mouse wheel.

601
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:09,079
It's like E then like F or something. E, E. You can throw it away. So be careful.

602
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:19,770
There's literally a way to destroy it. Oh, okay. It's F and then F, F. Oh my God. This sucks.

603
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:27,449
Asshole. F is scroll vertically. And what'd you just do? You just put down, get away. Don't you

604
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:34,600
dare. Don't do it. Well, can you pick it back up? This entire station hostage. Just pick it back up.

605
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:39,479
It's fine. As long as you don't press the button. Shoot me. My like death reflex may accidentally

606
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:45,500
trigger the bomb, but you don't know that. All right. He's dead.

607
01:14:46,939 --> 01:14:50,619
No, now you have to heal. We did it where I'm veteran right now. No, you can't do like

608
01:14:50,619 --> 01:15:08,020
comedy references. It's okay. I got some. I thought that was part of the cut scene.

609
01:15:09,619 --> 01:15:20,890
Come on. We're going to pull this all open with our bare hands. Oh, you idiot. You idiot.

610
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:22,649
You idiot.

611
01:15:28,489 --> 01:15:34,500
I didn't mean to use that many. Use it. Use a bomb. Yeah. Use a bomb. Somebody's

612
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:38,500
for something in my face. Watch out. There's like a spitter. Watch out. Plant a bomb.

613
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:50,520
All right. Watch out. Yep. I didn't even see it. Cool guys. Don't look at explosions. I saw it though.

614
01:15:50,520 --> 01:16:09,159
It's very cool. They're alive. All right. The worst part is switching guns. The entire gun

615
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:17,449
inventory like crosses over the crosshair. Like if you mouse wheel while you're aiming down sights.

616
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:24,170
I mean you can just say it. You can just say it. It's this game is actually not as bad as

617
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:30,090
everyone said it was. It's awful, but I would not give this an F. I'd give it like a D so far.

618
01:16:34,329 --> 01:16:40,579
I would never. I would never recommend this game to my friends, but like if somebody. Yeah.

619
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:46,020
As far as like co-op games though, there's just a lot of. You can reach the street level from there.

620
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:50,420
What are conditions like up there? It's the worst Resident Evil game. It's gotten pretty bad.

621
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:56,260
If you don't like this by yourself. Yeah. This is not a game I would play solo Resident Evil.

622
01:16:56,260 --> 01:17:04,649
Oh, let me turn you up. But like that. A person using the turnstile and then just leaping. Yeah.

623
01:17:04,649 --> 01:17:09,430
It's fucked up. That's good content. I have no idea. I don't even know what you just said. I

624
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:12,470
just said that's fucked up after what you said because I wasn't paying any attention. I thought

625
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:15,029
you're talking about like the zombies or whatever. I was trying to fill dead air while you were in

626
01:17:15,029 --> 01:17:19,189
the settings again. I did the thing where you're like on the phone and like you're just talking

627
01:17:19,189 --> 01:17:22,779
to somebody and you're like that's fucked up and you don't even know what the last sentence they

628
01:17:22,779 --> 01:17:30,729
said. I was talking about diapers. It's fucked up. You two will have to cross that. It's crazy.

629
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:48,069
What the fuck dude. Save him. Whoa. You can continue on. I guess. Did I punch you again?

630
01:17:48,550 --> 01:18:04,810
Yes. Shoot the thing on the back. Shoot his back. Oh, a bishop. Thanks. Space R. Holy shit.

631
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:11,770
Okay. I got it. I'm good. I feel like this is just a bad feeling about this.

632
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:18,760
Okay. Those are not zombies. This guy. Get out of here dude. Run. I don't know. Why are you just

633
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,880
waiting for one of them to do like the thing where they're running and holding their asshole like

634
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:27,449
they're going to shit their pants. Okay. I haven't heard that reference in like four years. Just like

635
01:18:27,449 --> 01:18:35,140
walking really quickly, holding your butt, shitting your pants. These are just two people

636
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:42,760
who lock themselves out of the trunk. And why the fuck does that happen in any movie or TV show?

637
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,800
You know what I'm talking about? Like why is it like a funny reference? Nobody like does like the

638
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:58,180
quick walk holding butt. I've never seen anybody do that. You got to be the the visionary. What is

639
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:02,939
this game's fucking broken. Just keep going. You weren't allowed to shoot them yet. They

640
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:08,250
were doing the cinematic thing. We're going to help this guy. Okay. I'll cover you.

641
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:16,710
Oh, both of us have to help this guy. Use your motherly strength. Oh yeah. This is GTA.

642
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:31,500
That was a stream sniper. What the fuck? We don't have time to deal with this. We need

643
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:36,300
ammo and shit though, dude. Yeah. So that's why they first of all, there's a military zombie

644
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:41,399
with like an assault rifle and they are shooting at us. This is too loud. Everyone always asks why

645
01:19:41,399 --> 01:19:45,479
I might. The zombies have guns now in there. Oh, the zombies have guns. That's what it was. That's

646
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:50,630
why everybody hates this game. I remember I'm first. I always have the game really quiet

647
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:54,789
because that's easy to pay attention. I feel like my game's loud. I think my game is a little too

648
01:19:54,789 --> 01:20:07,460
loud. The audio is good. Oh, perfect. I have, I don't know. You should. Okay. I have one bomb.

649
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:12,180
You want to put it down there? No, no, no. You just got to jump across. Okay. I couldn't put it down

650
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:22,539
there. Well, see if I can kill them. They didn't work. It did hurt me though. Why did you have a

651
01:20:22,539 --> 01:20:32,229
cut scene? I didn't. You just kind of like leapt across. Okay. All right. That was all right.

652
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:44,859
What's wrong with my camera? I'm like permanently left-handed in this game because my

653
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:51,020
camera gets reset every time we do a co-op. Yeah. You're hitting caps lock. We got to run.

654
01:20:53,800 --> 01:21:12,359
Ron, this way. Okay. Ron, Ron, do you know that guy? I've, I've, that's fine. We're good. What the

655
01:21:12,359 --> 01:21:19,829
fuck is happening? I didn't even want to do that. Get up the ladder. Artists spend a lot of time

656
01:21:19,829 --> 01:21:28,180
on these custom kills. Who, who got that there? We just like, I don't know. We just fucked up

657
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:36,819
somebody's car. Go. What the fuck is happening to me? What's going on? I just got lit up through

658
01:21:36,819 --> 01:21:42,579
the grate. I can't move. I don't even understand what just happened. Why can't we get? Oh,

659
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:59,720
go. Now where? Over here? Okay. They were opening the new like path for us.

660
01:22:05,979 --> 01:22:11,300
Leon is so cool. He's so cool. It looks like this way is blocked.

661
01:22:12,409 --> 01:22:17,050
They're always so cool. A family of three just died. I guess we're not going that way.

662
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:27,590
And catch our breath. That'd be kind of cool if you could. I'd be really happy about that.

663
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:31,430
They should make a, they should make Resident Evil games like mini game games.

664
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:39,670
This should be a Resident Evil party game, like Mario party. What about Resident Evil, like

665
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:49,979
soccer? That'd be kind of cool. You can shoot them. What do you mean? Shoot what? I don't know. What

666
01:22:49,979 --> 01:22:57,529
are you referring to? I don't know what he was saying. Well, yeah, I talked to the people over

667
01:22:57,529 --> 01:23:05,210
here in my brain. The pool balls. Oh, you can shoot the pool balls. Did they do anything?

668
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:13,960
They're saying that it does. Oh my God. It works. Okay. So here's the thing. I got it.

669
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:21,539
My ball point. Oh, I was going to, we're going to call balls. And yeah, but if you play pool,

670
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:26,979
the person, if you, if you, if you get it, like I got solids, um, I've got the first one,

671
01:23:26,979 --> 01:23:31,060
which is really stupid by the way, it went like it, that means that somebody can just literally

672
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:39,050
win and I don't get to play. Now I got to get the eight ball. If you get good at, you can get

673
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:43,130
to the point where you're, you physically don't. I should have just bet you something for that one

674
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:48,149
because that was pretty good. Wait, were you seeing pool balls different? Stop tripping over

675
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:53,590
there. Okay. There we go. Oh, what was that? Hold on. I want to hear that again. You said,

676
01:23:53,590 --> 01:24:18,039
you said something very specific because alive is a gun client side. Uh, where'd he go? I'll go.

677
01:24:18,039 --> 01:24:25,189
It's too scary in here. I'll go. Oh, I thought they were alive. Yeah. I was going to say they're

678
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:31,979
not even zombies. They are. They're going to stand out. There's one behind us. It's going to,

679
01:24:31,979 --> 01:24:35,100
it's going to change to the fucking, to our Twitch channels and they're going to get up and

680
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:43,020
fucking flip out the man that'd be changed. No, these are people already watching our

681
01:24:43,020 --> 01:25:01,050
Twitch channels. This is just what they look like. That's no, the entire city is on fire.

682
01:25:01,369 --> 01:25:09,800
I hate that so much. So wait, do we, do we both get this? What do you mean it's locked? Find the

683
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:17,590
key. Kick it open. So where's the key? Oh, you have to, you have to carefully reach to grab the key

684
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:24,380
and then you not get grabbed. You, you want to grab key? I'll be ready. Tell me when you get it.

685
01:25:25,619 --> 01:25:36,500
Going in. I'm going in for the sparkle. I have become afraid. We picked the wrong person to be

686
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:49,029
worried about. All right. We're good. Oh, I have, I have the key. There wasn't even an animation for

687
01:25:49,029 --> 01:25:59,380
me grabbing it. Oh, come on. This stupid game. Of course, like you said, they are not real until

688
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:06,470
the game decides they are. Uh huh. Are you, are you healthy? Are you good? I'm not okay.

689
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:12,789
I need help. You want to talk about it? I need to talk about you having healing potions to give me.

690
01:26:13,829 --> 01:26:19,859
I have four. Oh, a shotgun. Nope. Mine. Oh, you got it too. That's not cool anymore. I want my other

691
01:26:19,859 --> 01:26:25,460
one bag. Do you have two shotguns? I do have two now. Yeah. Oh, that's kind of convenient. I think

692
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:32,659
we got the same one. I got like a triple barrel with no stock and then the, the tactical one.

693
01:26:32,659 --> 01:26:35,699
Sorry. I have, I can't hear a thing you're saying. I'm a little screaming.

694
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:50,470
Okay. I want to use this combined with my backpack. Eat only one heel. That sucks.

695
01:26:54,649 --> 01:26:59,210
Oh, this door's locked. Find the house key. Oh, this metal door is locked.

696
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:09,609
Kick their bosses. This is a boss. It's resident evil. You have to mix it with another herb. All

697
01:27:09,609 --> 01:27:16,390
right. I see. Uh huh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. He's just afraid of us. I got him. Watch out.

698
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:25,609
That guy's a bomb. They're coming in behind behind us. Why can't we just shut the door?

699
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:35,420
He's fucking head. Wait, I'm just going to play through the rest of the game like this.

700
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:41,500
What do you, why can I not trip over you? That's the weird thing.

701
01:27:45,529 --> 01:27:49,210
Are they different? Okay. Is it just red and green herbs or is there more?

702
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:52,810
Uh, I've only seen the two so far. They're like the turkeys over here, wherever it is.

703
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:01,130
I'm not going to explore. Yeah. I'm not going near that. He didn't, he didn't explore. That

704
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:05,930
was anticlimactic. Yes. Red and green. It became a trophy. We have skills.

705
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:19,130
Hey, green. All right. I got to, we need to do a skill thing here. It hasn't been a quiet moment

706
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:23,930
to really do anything. It's just been like constant conflict. Are you playing house of the dead?

707
01:28:24,729 --> 01:28:30,069
It kind of does have that vibe. Doesn't it? Yeah. It even has the game over when one partner dies

708
01:28:30,630 --> 01:28:35,159
repeatedly. Oh, we got, that is absolutely a red barrel. I'm ready for it.

709
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:39,529
You, what do you, why would, I don't understand why you do that. That's you.

710
01:28:39,529 --> 01:28:42,250
You were this close to saying you fuck. You were this close.

711
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:45,930
That was, that was, there's nothing funny about that. You just ruined our experience.

712
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:50,470
You didn't, no, no, no, you just ruined my experience because I wanted to shoot that

713
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:58,579
and kill some people. You just ruined my experience. No one's even there.

714
01:28:58,579 --> 01:29:03,189
We're not even going to be over there. It's not how that is strong.

715
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:08,949
All right. So you just jumped down. What would have been right there?

716
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:13,510
That would have been great. Are you supposed to be doing something?

717
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:19,510
Yeah, I'm doing it. I'm doing it. You just got to stay alive. Pushing this giant heap of trash

718
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:26,630
as fast as I can. And I don't mean the video game. I love, I have no, I'm the guy with no ammo and no

719
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:38,340
health and I'm the one that has to take care of this. Can I go now? No, I'm still looking

720
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:41,060
for an exit. You're still looking for the exit. I'm actually just going to leave you behind.

721
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:50,810
That guy got cracked. What? I'm waiting for you currently to do a co-op moment.

722
01:29:50,810 --> 01:29:54,489
What? I can't even get down the stairs. How are you waiting for a co-op?

723
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:57,210
How am I supposed to free you? Wait, hold on. Oh, right here.

724
01:29:57,850 --> 01:30:05,079
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

725
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:09,420
I'm helping.

726
01:30:11,979 --> 01:30:20,229
Now you really got to help me. Okay. I'm coming. Oh, I can heal you with the number one instead of

727
01:30:20,229 --> 01:30:30,439
pushing V. I've apparently been choosing not to heal you. What is? Okay. I'm going to run.

728
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:45,109
Do I have any heels? No, I'm not going to combine this. Oh God. Why is V back? Oh,

729
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:54,260
too green. No, I want to do green and red. Just do it. I want to a green and red though.

730
01:30:54,260 --> 01:31:00,550
I want to do red starburst. I do. Those are the best ones. It's only three. What the fuck?

731
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:06,010
You look like you're passing out right now. I probably am. Your hands are on your knees.

732
01:31:07,399 --> 01:31:18,149
You're holding your gut. Don't call me menu Andy. These guys really take a lot. They pop a lot of

733
01:31:18,149 --> 01:31:30,760
pills. Come on. You have to help them. Are these survivors? Is this humanity? What the fuck?

734
01:31:32,439 --> 01:31:36,600
That was the only non. That was the only NPC in the whole goddamn group.

735
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:51,770
Boo. He's standing in front of me on purpose. Watch out. The guy on the top of the guy on top

736
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:58,619
of the truck. We have to shoot. We have to shoot his like growth. Oh yeah. That guy that you

737
01:31:58,619 --> 01:32:03,260
already killed him in like four bullets and then he screams and then what happens? I think we get

738
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:16,090
more. What the hell? I guess that ambulance came out of nowhere and ran directly into me.

739
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:24,439
That was that car was going 80 miles per hour. That was not even like 30. The car was going

740
01:32:24,439 --> 01:32:31,140
100 miles. Can an ambulance even go like 150 miles per hour? All right. This time we're going to get

741
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:42,779
this right. Come on. We have to help them. Deus ex drivers. It's actually easier to be on the

742
01:32:42,779 --> 01:32:47,909
ground. All right. So wait, are you not on the ground? It's easier to lie on the ground and shoot.

743
01:32:49,029 --> 01:33:08,550
Okay. But watch out for the. Oh, please. Really? Oh, he screams at us. Here it comes again. Oh,

744
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:15,779
it got you. All right. Clipped you on the back tire. All right. All right. All right. All right.

745
01:33:15,779 --> 01:33:19,510
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Cleric beast noise. Yeah,

746
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:31,619
it is going like I thought I was going to be out of the way. Oh, survivors. Come on. We have to

747
01:33:31,619 --> 01:33:37,720
help. How do you do? How do you do this? Bad ass slide. Just stand over here. There's no reason

748
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:42,329
to be in that direction. Yeah, we don't need to save these people. They're fine. But we can.

749
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:53,560
We're going to get ambulance in like 10 seconds. Oh no, there really are. Take that guy out right

750
01:33:53,560 --> 01:34:08,409
now. He's on top of right here. Oh my God. You idiots. I want to get all that stuff before

751
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:22,060
the cut scene gets us. I want to get, let's go quick. Oh, go, go, go, go fast. Oh, what's wrong

752
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:37,699
with my body? I wasn't even close. I actually wasn't even close. I was over near you. What the

753
01:34:37,779 --> 01:34:52,090
fuck? I'm serious. That I was actually not even close. I was over. This is the Leon campaign.

754
01:34:53,819 --> 01:35:06,779
So bad. I, you know, I'm turning on the fucking tryhard right now. I always think that's the

755
01:35:06,779 --> 01:35:19,369
ambulance. I know. All right. Fuck that guy. I don't. Did you see that? Watch out ambulance.

756
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:26,520
It's already ambulance. Just go over to the left. Okay. All right. My goodness. There's more.

757
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:48,279
There's more inside and they have body armor. He's got guns too. Okay. We're good. When do we,

758
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:55,909
when do we actually pick skills? Shoot the gas. Wait, don't shoot it yet with this stuff.

759
01:35:56,710 --> 01:36:07,800
It's like a, there's like an omega thing over here. Okay. I'm, I'm ready. What are the second

760
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:11,399
ambulance? I don't know, but all the NPCs are over here. So it's definitely this far away.

761
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:26,220
We're good. I think we're okay. Yep. It's safe. We're here. We can rearm there.

762
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:30,390
Probably finding more people there too. I'm walking like I'm injured, but I have full health.

763
01:36:31,029 --> 01:36:37,529
I think it's stamina. I don't see any other options. Oh yeah. Well, I think I'm just being

764
01:36:37,529 --> 01:36:46,569
dramatic. It's Alex. We've been playing this game for an hour and a half. Yeah. It's the same level.

765
01:36:46,569 --> 01:36:56,359
I feel, I, I, my brain is stuck. But also I don't think turning the difficulty down would have

766
01:36:56,359 --> 01:37:11,050
stopped the one hit train kills. No. I'll just take all of his cool stuff. Who does he think

767
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:20,810
we are? Exterminators? God. It's nonstop. So just want to make it really clear. We could have just

768
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:26,300
seen an entire Will Ferrell movie. It already played. Like one of the new ones or one of the

769
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:32,840
older ones? Probably one of the new ones. That's the ones I would have muted. All right. We just

770
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:38,140
have to eliminate enemies. Yeah. That's a, did you just read that off the screen? I would just

771
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:50,329
make sure we didn't have to go upstairs. You never know. There's no way to tell. Don't worry.

772
01:37:50,329 --> 01:37:53,770
Somebody doesn't already have this window. Hey, there's probably at least three people

773
01:37:54,409 --> 01:38:00,250
in one of the chats making some zombies. Cod zombies jokes here. I just want to say,

774
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:04,250
I know who you are at the Cola. This Cola somewhere did not laugh. Minus two.

775
01:38:04,649 --> 01:38:19,529
Okay. I have the incendiary grenade. Oh, I thought he was breaking her neck.

776
01:38:20,329 --> 01:38:30,539
I thought he was going to get like a snap. Um, what the fuck? I didn't. I thought I threw that

777
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:37,500
I had to throw the incendiary onto. I had full health. Not anymore. But I was saving you. See,

778
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:57,350
the zombie that was on you died. Very funny. Very funny. These are, these are enemies from

779
01:38:57,350 --> 01:39:07,289
dead rising. That guy had a golf club, clubs, axes, hammers. Somebody said this game feels

780
01:39:07,289 --> 01:39:20,869
like mockery. Are they like an art critic? What? He's trying to kill them. I think that's the gun

781
01:39:20,869 --> 01:39:36,229
shuffle. Oh, all right. We still have to kill enemies. Is the car shooting at us? I'm so

782
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:45,510
panicked. All right. That, that, that zombie's neck just became stretch Armstrong for a half

783
01:39:45,510 --> 01:40:00,840
second and by an ambulance. Yep. Why would you wait? Was he going to monologue? Oh, it turned

784
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:10,279
into a different animal. Oh, Peter. Peter was my favorite side character, but we can go outside.

785
01:40:10,279 --> 01:40:18,279
Peter was my favorite guy dressed in summer Sims clothing. He's in, he's in venom is in.

786
01:40:19,239 --> 01:40:49,260
Is he dead? Nice. I still have no health. Whoa. We should be pretty close. Are we alive? Can we,

787
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:53,659
are you sure we're not supposed to just leave? Does eliminate all enemies? Yeah. Yeah. It does

788
01:40:53,659 --> 01:40:59,939
say that we can go outside. I wouldn't if I were you. That doesn't sound very safe.

789
01:41:00,739 --> 01:41:18,140
You're a, please tell italics to watch his six. Elbow drop that zombie. Please tell what I watch

790
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:24,659
your six. Okay. Yeah, I got it. I got it. When do we get to stop doing this? Hang on. Is it,

791
01:41:24,659 --> 01:41:31,460
is that the like six when you're high or like the six when you're not high? What was the analog

792
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:42,380
clock joke? Oh, I probably couldn't even do that right now. Wait, you had a lockdown button.

793
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:55,380
I think I picked everything up off. You're all right. He said to come up. We have to go

794
01:41:55,380 --> 01:42:05,619
upstairs now. Hey, I accidentally alt tab. There's bullets everywhere. Do you need help?

795
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:16,579
You let me know if you need help. Do you need help? What are you shooting at? Oh, hold on. I

796
01:42:16,579 --> 01:42:25,529
need to heal. I'm going to combine some shit. How do you get out of here? I like, okay. So there

797
01:42:25,529 --> 01:42:32,149
was a lot of action going on. I accidentally alt tab. How do I use this? I tab back in and everyone's

798
01:42:32,149 --> 01:42:47,800
gone. Yeah. We went upstairs, bro. Oh, it's this. Yeah. Oh, now the door's locked. We're safe. I got

799
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:53,000
some folks coming for me in a bus. Any minute now, make it on board. It's a straight shot to

800
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:58,760
tall Oaks cathedral. People are evacuating there. Heard it on the radio, but that's a big if it's

801
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:05,460
a shit storm out there. We ain't waiting for any stragglers. Okay. Is this, is this dude like old

802
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:11,220
man explaining to us how bad the situation is outside? He just started shooting at that guy. Oh,

803
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:22,020
what the fuck? Why would you get the shutters? No. What door do I look out from this with this

804
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:33,270
window right here? How? Why even shoot the gun? They get, they're all going to do it outside with

805
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:38,949
a flashlight just ran across stage 11. Somebody has out there with a light. I don't see any. Oh,

806
01:43:38,949 --> 01:43:49,699
somebody is out there. Who is it? This is just the game. Okay. The game was not made for more

807
01:43:49,699 --> 01:43:52,899
than four players, but we modded it and like ruined the whole experience.

808
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:58,260
That's one of the big red guys. It's so loud. It is. Yeah, I guess.

809
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:03,619
That actually would be kind of funny. Imagine having 10 people in this room.

810
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:10,699
This guy is kicking the shit out of me. Please somebody help me. The carnage is attacking me.

811
01:44:10,699 --> 01:44:19,640
This lady is just her AI has stopped working. What are we huddling? I don't know who I'm attacking.

812
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:36,310
I guess I'm what the hell is going on? This is so stupid. I drop it in from the ceiling.

813
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:46,659
Are you alive? I'm dying over on the corner here. Have a have a mental. Oh, thanks. You'll feel

814
01:44:46,659 --> 01:44:58,489
better. I guess I feel all right. I don't know that this guy's supposed to be closing the shutters.

815
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:20,579
Why? Why is there a drop kick? This is very strangely aiming. Oh shit. All right.

816
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:35,689
Finally. Oh, why did that take so long? I don't know. This game is not good. It's not good at all.

817
01:45:36,649 --> 01:45:42,460
Were we supposed to do that? No, I think it's just time based, but it's like this is weird.

818
01:45:45,689 --> 01:45:54,819
We all don't tell me to do that again. We did it again. No, we don't. What the fuck? I'm just

819
01:45:54,819 --> 01:46:14,569
trying to be my inventory. Okay. Okay. Don't just run out of. All right. All right. I'm in the corner.

820
01:46:14,569 --> 01:46:20,970
I'm not good. I'm going to help you up while the giant monster is breathing over. Where is

821
01:46:20,970 --> 01:46:27,050
he? He's just stepped on my head, dude. Why does the entire screen just flash white? There are too

822
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:33,159
many people in this room for what we're doing. This is so stupid. I can't even get up. All right.

823
01:46:33,159 --> 01:46:45,289
I'm just going to drop some remote bombs. Why is he running at me? In the stomach? Lead it back

824
01:46:45,289 --> 01:46:59,720
over here. It's the guy from Saints Row. Yeah. Good work. Good work, officer. You guys aren't even

825
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:14,699
helping. Frank disconnected. We need to add skills. I'm stopping right here. Where's skill

826
01:47:14,699 --> 01:47:26,920
points? Equip skills. Finally. I just heard something. I got you six. Where do you equip skills?

827
01:47:27,739 --> 01:47:32,140
I think it's between missions. This has been the same mission the entire time. Okay. Hold on.

828
01:47:33,189 --> 01:47:45,260
Let me combine some stuff. I got this. So I want to put this in my inventory. Okay. Shut up. Wow.

829
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:57,350
All right. Hang on. I'm combining some stuff too. There is one mouse wheel scroll between store

830
01:47:57,350 --> 01:48:07,289
in case and delete from game. Yeah. I don't think you've had fun for a single time. I think I've

831
01:48:07,289 --> 01:48:12,140
been having fun. I think we're having a good time. Yeah. This is the kind of shitty that you have fun

832
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:20,619
with. Yeah. So we made it outside. They're waiting for us. Not like Resident Evil 3,

833
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:29,340
which was just shitty. Yeah. Resident Evil 3 was pretty bad. It just didn't do it for anybody. I

834
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:36,489
don't think this is like watching the Far Cry movie on Netflix. We're going to help this guy.

835
01:48:37,529 --> 01:48:46,170
Now let him fall. Help him up. I'll cover you. Oh, watch out. Another big guy. Wait, wait, wait,

836
01:48:46,170 --> 01:48:51,609
wait, wait. I didn't even want to do that. Why did it do that? I didn't. I swear to God. I didn't

837
01:48:51,609 --> 01:49:01,029
want to do that. Do we both? Do we both have the same plan? Yes, we did. I think it worked.

838
01:49:01,029 --> 01:49:10,359
Are you dead? Wait, where are you? I'm dead. Yeah, I did. Have a tic tac. Yeah. I keep eating

839
01:49:10,359 --> 01:49:19,210
your tic tacs. Honest to fucking God. Why are you going for you? There's 10 people. Is this a bit?

840
01:49:19,210 --> 01:49:23,850
No, he does 10 people here. Why do you have to attack me? I was all the way in the back.

841
01:49:24,569 --> 01:49:28,250
Are you sure you're not doing like a see how long it takes to notice that he's the only one

842
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:47,350
shooting zombies? No. Oh my God. I'm going to die. It's bad. I'm going to die. I'm lying on the

843
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:54,890
ground. Just one more of those. I'm the dick that keeps asking you for tic tacs and you only

844
01:49:54,890 --> 01:50:00,760
have like a few left and you don't want to give me all of them. Hey, can I borrow a pencil? Hey,

845
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:13,060
you have any gum? Can we go? I know you have two pieces of gum left and I've asked for two.

846
01:50:13,939 --> 01:50:21,420
All right, let's get out of here. Do we have to go? I'm going to stay here and shoot zombies

847
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:35,319
forever because I have so much fun up on this roof. Get to the bus. They've been waiting for

848
01:50:35,319 --> 01:50:47,189
us down here. It's about to have a new character. Well, you can tell this game takes place in New

849
01:50:47,189 --> 01:50:53,130
York because none of these people have their own personal car. We're going to take public

850
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:58,220
transportation. I'm just going to I'm just going to pretend like I didn't hear it. Oh,

851
01:50:58,220 --> 01:51:13,380
wait, they're sucking that guy out. Why can't I shoot this gun? I'm get you dead. No, I'm not.

852
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:29,180
I'm fine. Okay, but what did I just what? Oh, no. Oh, no. Back up. He was so close to me.

853
01:51:31,029 --> 01:51:47,590
I did. Oh, give me a break. So excessive. We're going to crash immediately too. What's with the

854
01:51:47,590 --> 01:51:54,760
end horror movies? People just driving a straight line into walls. That was that was one mission.

855
01:51:54,840 --> 01:52:01,000
What was your accuracy? 64 percent. Oh, I was 79. Well, hold on. That's bullshit because you

856
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:06,359
had a shotgun. Rank A. You had a shotgun from the very beginning, which means you don't even

857
01:52:06,359 --> 01:52:10,920
have to fucking aim. I had a pistol from the beginning. First hour was skewed. You had three

858
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:15,159
times as many pistols as I did. It doesn't matter. You have your shotgun will hit something. I have

859
01:52:15,159 --> 01:52:20,869
to actually pinpoint the laser on people's heads. That's unfair. In fact, I think that mine's

860
01:52:20,869 --> 01:52:25,510
probably better than yours. Okay, but that doesn't explain the extra nine enemies routed.

861
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:30,869
End game. By the way, can we just stop for a second and acknowledge that we apparently killed,

862
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:38,710
I assume, four hundred and fifty seven. What? Enemies in one mission. Is that am I doing the

863
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:43,510
math right there? Yeah, that's a lot. That seems like a lot. I don't think we did that.

864
01:52:45,619 --> 01:52:53,579
I don't think we killed more than 30 or 40 people. 30 or 40. Maybe like 50. All right.

865
01:52:54,779 --> 01:53:06,699
Hold on. Do we? This is literally a timer at the top. Can you hit? Okay. Oh, it's a timer for me.

866
01:53:06,699 --> 01:53:11,079
Oh, we have to make sure we do this right because I don't want you to have the same

867
01:53:11,079 --> 01:53:15,800
thing that I have so we can be different character classes. Okay. How many skill points do you have?

868
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:20,359
I have twelve thousand seven hundred experience. You got I got eleven three.

869
01:53:20,359 --> 01:53:25,399
So even though I did more of the work, I got less skill points. That just means I did better work.

870
01:53:26,039 --> 01:53:43,079
Okay. Melee level one defense lock on level two ritz Java killer. Slight melee damage is like all

871
01:53:43,079 --> 01:53:53,079
points. Two of them are twelve thousand. So I'm like just shy of the big. I think I want crits.

872
01:53:53,079 --> 01:54:02,810
You can scroll down. Oh shit. You can scroll. Oh, quick reload. Oh, greatly increases the strength

873
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:07,850
of your final remaining shot. I'm not going to pay attention to that one. The five removes your

874
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:14,970
targeting site, but increases your firepower. Oh, that's cool. Break free easily from enemy's

875
01:54:14,970 --> 01:54:20,170
grasp. Yeah, that seems like that seems easy to pick. Oh, wait a minute. Hold on, dude. You

876
01:54:20,170 --> 01:54:29,619
only get to have three of these active at once. Oh, yeah. There's a single player only one hundred

877
01:54:29,619 --> 01:54:43,659
points. Okay, hold on. Wait, can I do a double? No. What does team up? No. Fuck that. There's a

878
01:54:43,659 --> 01:54:50,970
lot of question marks at the bottom. Oh, that's single player only. Yeah, that's stupid.

879
01:54:50,970 --> 01:54:57,340
Keeps your partner from helping you. Oh, God. Getting in the way. We have to pick weapons to.

880
01:54:57,340 --> 01:55:03,539
Did you already pick your skills? I picked breakout, which I feel like was pretty useful.

881
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:10,949
Arrow pickup allows you to pick up an increased number of normal and pipe bombs.

882
01:55:13,779 --> 01:55:21,050
Lone wolf field medic team up item drop increase. Yeah, you got to pick the item drop, right?

883
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:25,029
I feel like that's really important. Yeah. All right, we're going to be exact same build. Oh,

884
01:55:25,029 --> 01:55:28,869
we're going to have the exact same build, but those are gimmies. But here's the thing, though.

885
01:55:28,869 --> 01:55:36,310
It's that's really that's very useful. A lot get a zombie hunter level one. Yeah, but fuck that

886
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:46,789
lock on level one. What is it? What you want? Aim assist. Please shoot somebody. Please start

887
01:55:46,789 --> 01:55:54,550
shooting people on board. I'm we're going to do this. We just killed like 500, 500 enemies killed

888
01:55:54,550 --> 01:56:01,350
defense. I think I'll I'll try the lock steady's hand when shooting. Who cares?

889
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:08,779
All right, I'm going for it. I'm going to be Mr. Melee. Okay, I'm going to be crit. And

890
01:56:09,739 --> 01:56:15,750
now this is locked because I used. Oh, god damn it. Whatever. Okay, I'm going to save my points.

891
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:30,340
I have enough points. All right, that's fine. Okay, let's go. Hey, I'm going to get item drop.

892
01:56:30,899 --> 01:56:36,439
All right, ready? I think I'm ready. I got item drop breakout and lock on. I want the melee one,

893
01:56:36,439 --> 01:56:40,600
though. How do you go to the next screen? Do you have to hit escape? I think we just have to hit

894
01:56:40,600 --> 01:57:09,000
escape or something out of here. We're going to have to kill 70,000 people that an organization

895
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:19,220
This is a weird phone. That's like what people thought technology was going to look like

896
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:27,380
in 2012. You know, like we had just invented iPhones like five years prior. That's actually

897
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:35,020
kind of true. And then they did Google Glass anyways. You know, we all knew it was going to

898
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:45,340
fail, but they did it anyways. This is what graphics will be like in 2016. You know what

899
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:53,380
the difference in graphics is between this game and a modern game? There was no reason to go that

900
01:57:53,380 --> 01:57:58,899
fast. It's just a person like I why what you just really wanted to show off that you're going to

901
01:57:58,899 --> 01:58:02,500
ram this guy going like 80. We could have you could have just ran them over slowly and killed

902
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:12,149
them. There was no point to go that one guy and nearly drove us to our death. Yeah, there was no

903
01:58:12,149 --> 01:58:16,310
reason to do that. All right, I actually need the alt tab to turn the volume down. So you got to

904
01:58:16,390 --> 01:58:28,699
protect me. Okay, I'm gonna watch the cutscene first though. Hey, watch this. Watch this.

905
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:38,460
All right, protect me. Um, I don't have any bullets in my gun. Why is that guy floating?

906
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:53,000
This is making me sick. All right, I'm coming back in. I'm here. What the hell? Stop ignoring.

907
01:58:55,539 --> 01:59:03,109
Are we dead? I think we're okay. Good job. Oh, here's another guy that said watch this before

908
01:59:03,109 --> 01:59:10,380
he got behind the wheel. Why are they doing this? Why? Hey, check this out. See that school bus

909
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:17,770
over there? Watch this. Hold my beard joke. They just all go so fast. You don't have to go this

910
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:25,699
fast. What what if they're all like other players and we're their objective marker. So they're just

911
01:59:25,699 --> 01:59:30,979
like driving and they think they're going to their objective but they're all beelining to ram into

912
01:59:30,979 --> 01:59:36,359
us. Why are people saying I'm ignoring everybody? What do I do? What happened?

913
01:59:38,550 --> 01:59:49,020
Read. It's important. I'm literally, I'm staring at the chat right now. I'm reading.

914
01:59:52,409 --> 01:59:55,050
We're the main characters so that's how we survived and everyone else died?

915
01:59:57,460 --> 02:00:03,000
Literally every other character is dead at this point I think. Read this. Read this.

916
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:17,930
Are you still the Among Us guy? Not anymore? No, not anymore. I'm the serial killer guy now.

917
02:00:20,470 --> 02:00:26,250
Did you see that? Did I see what? Were you doing something like serial killer-esque?

918
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:33,289
No. So on the front page of all Reddit with 50,000 fucking upvotes. I'm not even kidding. 50,000

919
02:00:33,289 --> 02:00:39,449
upvotes. Wow. They um. 50,000 upvotes. 50,000. That's like these three Reddit golds for the

920
02:00:39,449 --> 02:00:44,010
first like top comment. Yeah um actually you know what if you don't even want to like breathe life

921
02:00:44,010 --> 02:00:48,409
back into this just know that they put an image of me on the front page of Reddit somehow and it was

922
02:00:48,409 --> 02:00:53,289
like every serial killer combined into AI and like people believed it and it spread everywhere. Did

923
02:00:53,289 --> 02:00:58,569
you uh thank the kind strangers? No I actually screamed at them and said stop fucking ruining my

924
02:00:58,569 --> 02:01:03,210
life. I'm just going to bury myself. Watch out this is a fucking Dark Souls enemy.

925
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:11,079
I am in a grave. I just drop kicked a zombie in a flooding grave.

926
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:17,239
I'm just going to I'm just going to play down here. These guys are actually pretty weak.

927
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:32,149
Are you are you stuck or are you can you get up? You actually need help or is this a routine?

928
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:40,920
Yeah. Don't take care of your business. That was that was from my stream. Oh. That was for you.

929
02:01:42,810 --> 02:01:46,329
Oh that's right. You you've got to do some comedy routines for your stream.

930
02:01:46,329 --> 02:01:51,880
That's because if you go down there you'll see what happens. Oh that is kind of funny.

931
02:01:52,840 --> 02:02:13,859
It's not funny. I just got bit. Get me the fuck out of here. How do you actually oh um

932
02:02:14,739 --> 02:02:20,020
lightning just struck. Okay we're fine. I sensed a disturbance in the force. Oh dad.

933
02:02:24,789 --> 02:02:28,149
Because it doesn't it doesn't do anything crazy when I get hit.

934
02:02:28,229 --> 02:02:34,460
Only when you do. I guess it's supposed to be like a hey your partner's in trouble.

935
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:38,460
Oh that's probably what it is. Did you get the emblem over the entire screen? I can't believe

936
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:41,899
you haven't seen it. Did you get the emblem over here? Maybe it's because I never get attacked or

937
02:02:41,899 --> 02:02:48,810
die. Did you get the emblem over here? I did yeah. Idiot. The big the giant blue one. I got it yeah.

938
02:02:50,550 --> 02:02:59,029
I got it like 10 seconds ago. No no that that was it. What how is that it? I think this is

939
02:02:59,029 --> 02:03:04,949
lightning. Oh it's trying to scare us. I get it. When the lightning strikes we have new monsters

940
02:03:04,949 --> 02:03:12,520
on the screen. Are the other monsters riding the lightning? I think they're just here when

941
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:19,529
it's to scare you I think. Is the final boss Zeus? I don't know. Can we get mythological

942
02:03:19,529 --> 02:03:23,289
in Resident Evil? I don't I have no idea where this sits in the timeline. I have no idea.

943
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:34,680
Okay be more efficient with this because these guys actually take like three hits from a knife.

944
02:03:35,399 --> 02:03:46,310
Oh thank you Vectro for the 20 immunity subs. Appreciate it now. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah one

945
02:03:46,310 --> 02:03:52,020
two three yeah it's three hits with the knife. I was using shotgun bullets on these idiots.

946
02:03:52,020 --> 02:04:02,149
Getting ready to speed run this game? I've been watching speed runs. I've become I've become a

947
02:04:02,149 --> 02:04:12,899
huge fan of Mario 64 speed run. Do you need help? There you go. I literally watched Box Box get his

948
02:04:12,899 --> 02:04:28,180
PB last night it was fucking awesome. Did he cut the sandwich into triangles? No I was gonna I was

949
02:04:28,180 --> 02:04:33,060
gonna like gift a bunch of subs but like my credit card got declined so and he was like ended the

950
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:45,770
stream right after so I would look like an idiot. I missed every shot god damn it. I don't think

951
02:04:45,770 --> 02:04:55,000
you were supposed to kill it anyways. Oh yeah we were. He's got the key in his mouth. I've seen

952
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:10,149
this movie. It could be chasing us. Where's the uh where's the drunk pirate? Where'd you go? I'm

953
02:05:10,149 --> 02:05:16,170
right here. Are you doing like a your invisible joke? No no no I just I thought I saw the indicator

954
02:05:16,170 --> 02:05:24,359
I didn't know if you were down here. Sprinting is like five percent faster than just moving.

955
02:05:29,050 --> 02:05:36,279
Don't even attack. What's the point? Just go we gotta get the dog. What all right but that's like

956
02:05:36,279 --> 02:05:43,880
actual zombie okay zombie apocalypse day 14 you just go outside your house you see a bunch

957
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:48,520
of zombies and just what's the point there's two million more like what's the point just

958
02:05:49,319 --> 02:05:58,069
all right there it is there is go it's probably gonna run all right get that key

02:20:54,620 --> 02:21:00,309
once you get raised off the ground you can't sprint i don't know so i have to jog

1051
02:21:01,270 --> 02:21:06,629
this is the whole game by the way i didn't find a level i did not ditch him i heard the call for

1052
02:21:06,629 --> 02:21:14,219
help i saw that he was surrounded by people i got over there i granaded and i almost passed out but

1053
02:21:14,219 --> 02:21:20,139
i'm okay yeah that was that was the last thing i heard is i'm gonna pass out it sounded like

1054
02:21:20,940 --> 02:21:24,620
it sounded like you tried to like make your trauma like more than my almost

1055
02:21:27,370 --> 02:21:32,090
okay buddy why did you almost pass out because i thought it was funny and like i didn't breathe

1056
02:21:32,889 --> 02:21:38,569
look it's just us i got really tense and then laughed and then like my brain was like it's time

1057
02:21:38,569 --> 02:21:46,549
for you to shut off we're just trying to get more gameplay out of this this is like a hundred

1058
02:21:46,549 --> 02:21:51,590
percent run today by the way we have to stay just stay back and just shoot from afar there's no

1059
02:21:51,590 --> 02:21:54,549
reason to even go for the whole thing was like keep them on the just forget about the loot just

1060
02:21:54,549 --> 02:22:06,469
shoot them and just shoot them and let them die you're walking in circles jump behind you

1061
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:15,139
here comes company i okay here's the thing oh wait do i have any like herbs

1062
02:22:16,500 --> 02:22:25,909
i do i can combine this is game changer okay now we actually who gives a shit just kill them on the

1063
02:22:25,909 --> 02:22:34,420
other side i didn't have any tic-tacs before he better not okay you know you know no no no

1064
02:22:34,420 --> 02:22:44,020
fuck it fuck this where did that even go what where did that go you just shot me in the head

1065
02:22:44,659 --> 02:22:52,120
i did i was saving you from this guy watch out watch out watch out watch out i'm throwing a bomb

1066
02:22:52,760 --> 02:23:03,020
oh that was a good bomb with two bombs yes i had to do it all right now it's almost ready

1067
02:23:09,139 --> 02:23:21,479
teamwork make sure you collect all the items goodness heads gone all right this is where

1068
02:23:21,479 --> 02:23:38,260
we get just absolutely messed hold on all right all right just go and press now thank goodness

1069
02:23:38,260 --> 02:23:48,170
that was so bad to be fair the level we were just on is representative of the entire game so i mean

1070
02:23:48,170 --> 02:23:57,219
we could just pretend like those were different levels we could this game gets dramatically easier

1071
02:23:57,219 --> 02:24:09,290
if you're bad sorry guy rescue worker so which one of these guys is gonna say watch this and

1072
02:24:09,290 --> 02:24:15,340
drive the school bus with all of us in it and kill everybody here wait i think if you die

1073
02:24:15,340 --> 02:24:22,059
they reduce enemies on the next life or is that like just a meme down there i that sounds like a

1074
02:24:22,059 --> 02:24:32,729
meme to me i show you there were definitely no scream guys that time all right search the cathedral

1075
02:24:33,290 --> 02:24:37,610
okay question if you were in a zombie apocalypse and you were in this cathedral and there were two

1076
02:24:37,610 --> 02:24:42,969
people outside begging for help do you open the door uh well there's that that's very very much

1077
02:24:42,969 --> 02:24:50,329
very contextual based because it does this fake scenario if you're a bit do you get infected

1078
02:24:51,700 --> 02:24:56,020
uh i was open the last time i was here i don't know because the heroes get bit all the time

1079
02:24:56,020 --> 02:24:59,780
in this but when people get bit they turn right like if you're not a main character let's take

1080
02:24:59,780 --> 02:25:03,459
a look around i mean it's it's it's tricky i would say that you'd probably bring them in

1081
02:25:03,459 --> 02:25:08,340
and they they we'd have we'd make a place like maybe pile up a bunch of these uh church benches

1082
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:13,139
and like put make like a cube that we put that person in and they stay in there for like a week

1083
02:25:13,379 --> 02:25:17,059
okay so we like quarantine people yes like even if at least like a day or two and look it's not

1084
02:25:17,059 --> 02:25:20,819
like we're gonna you can we'll feed you we'll make sure you're okay but like just to make sure

1085
02:25:20,819 --> 02:25:27,770
you don't turn in 24 hours all right uh zombie ethics question do you wait until somebody like

1086
02:25:27,770 --> 02:25:32,649
turns into a zombie to shoot them if they're guaranteed like infected no absolutely not

1087
02:25:32,649 --> 02:25:38,100
absolutely no this isn't just part of the decor because that that person can be useful until they

1088
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:42,340
turn okay but do you tell them that you're gonna do it before you do it or or you like rip the

1089
02:25:42,659 --> 02:25:45,219
it depends on how their immunity is like right some people might get bit and they're

1090
02:25:45,219 --> 02:25:49,219
infected on their attitude like if they suck i'm just gonna do it right now if they're like nice

1091
02:25:49,219 --> 02:25:56,440
there's a lot going on i'll give them a little time there's a lot going on there i think but yes

1092
02:25:56,440 --> 02:26:01,719
if somebody is new they go into the just the cube will make like a little cube so like if they turn

1093
02:26:01,719 --> 02:26:08,780
to a zombie that it can't do anything and then after that and if it's like okay i haven't been

1094
02:26:08,780 --> 02:26:14,969
bitter anything i'm fine and we go all right soldier we like throw like a big gun and they

1095
02:26:14,969 --> 02:26:23,690
catch it and it's like okay geez where are you i'm at the co-op moment we're both at a different

1096
02:26:23,690 --> 02:26:39,209
co-op moment by the way oh are we oh i'll come over there literally the other side yeah the exact

1097
02:26:39,209 --> 02:26:44,420
same ladder well now what do you have to do i have the key item so i put the key item there

1098
02:26:44,979 --> 02:26:52,260
there is a uh over in like the weird um clock holes thing over on the top kind of right side

1099
02:26:52,260 --> 02:26:56,840
there's one of those we have to have two orange slices some some no two grapefruits

1100
02:26:57,479 --> 02:27:03,319
and if we put both the grapefruits the motherly smile will shine upon us and the path will be

1101
02:27:03,319 --> 02:27:08,040
revealed is really important in the old telephone like the old like 19 like 20s telephone up in the

1102
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:14,020
top with like the good glasses there's one of those blue things to shoot shoot it okay up at

1103
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:19,860
the top up at the top on like where i'm facing it's on your side it's above you it's on the

1104
02:27:19,860 --> 02:27:24,059
balcony it looks like an old telephone it's a big window with like big telephone holes

1105
02:27:25,879 --> 02:27:35,819
and there's a blue thing to shoot thank you now my uh achievements can be complete i have one

1106
02:27:35,819 --> 02:27:44,739
bullet it's not good all right so then you have to do the puzzle oh you have to knock that down

1107
02:27:44,739 --> 02:27:56,739
my son marco he's in the psaa so am i not supposed to be exploring these rooms you think you're

1108
02:27:56,739 --> 02:27:59,620
supposed to knock down like the candy cane ladder i think okay well i'm gonna take all the loot

1109
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:05,100
first actually i might be able to i might be able to solve the puzzle actually no you have to pick

1110
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:09,579
this one up no i can i can do everything it says that you have two it looks just like the other

1111
02:28:09,579 --> 02:28:20,229
statue the question is what are they for i did kick down one okay you got it yep yep but you

1112
02:28:20,229 --> 02:28:27,770
said this stuff up here so i want to get it i think we both have to put a statue on like at

1113
02:28:27,770 --> 02:28:41,639
the same time but on opposite sides okay okay i'm gonna go to this one so i am putting one here

1114
02:28:45,340 --> 02:28:53,020
as he that was huge we probably shouldn't have opened this isn't this supposed to be a safe place

1115
02:28:53,659 --> 02:28:59,559
this is the equipment i'm not gonna no i'm not gonna do it i refuse to

1116
02:29:01,559 --> 02:29:08,469
there's a scene in pop culture media from the not too distant past this reminds me of

1117
02:29:08,469 --> 02:29:15,299
well don't ruin the don't spawn anything all right just checking to save uh we got everything we can

1118
02:29:15,299 --> 02:29:21,299
go i mean uh a media property with undead where the heroes go into the belly of the crypt in

1119
02:29:21,299 --> 02:29:25,290
order to get away from the other is nothing it's not referencing anything how do you well how do

1120
02:29:25,290 --> 02:29:40,139
you dive all right it's like space we have to be aimed at we said i'm sick of you um uh there that

1121
02:29:41,260 --> 02:29:47,319
why is it i thought that was you that didn't i can't i can't shoot this no this is you do

1122
02:29:47,319 --> 02:29:50,760
i what am i supposed to do just dive what am i supposed to how what do i do about this can you

1123
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:56,340
help what do you do i i'm stuck on the other side is there something you can shoot oh i think i can

1124
02:29:56,340 --> 02:30:04,329
just i like how your first order of business was to immediately blame me well i don't know

1125
02:30:04,889 --> 02:30:10,680
what now it's your turn you just you just saw me do it you now you know what to do

1126
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:18,520
didn't even get hit once why did they both come out at the same time when that wouldn't have caused

1127
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:22,680
some chaos in the comms like oh my god what's this oh you got it too oh this is shooting both

1128
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:27,530
like we could have had a little pain yeah let me get a little yeah this games time for this all

1129
02:30:27,530 --> 02:30:33,639
right it's me versus you we're gonna see point scores i guess you can't decide that in the middle

1130
02:30:34,360 --> 02:30:44,260
oh yeah oh somebody got hit i see somebody got hit oh it looks like somebody's gonna get hit

1131
02:30:44,260 --> 02:30:51,239
twice okay get a fucking close-up stop me just keep moving why is the activation button suddenly

1132
02:30:51,239 --> 02:31:05,430
space when before it was always v for the entire rest of the game it's fair when do you are they

1133
02:31:05,430 --> 02:31:10,250
even happening on your side or am i the only one doing this no they're happening are you just

1134
02:31:10,329 --> 02:31:23,030
watching me it's probably gonna be three now okay now it's your turn okay that one wasn't fair

1135
02:31:23,030 --> 02:31:32,700
oh shit all right this one's this one's kind of unfair fucking move after yeah exactly

1136
02:31:33,739 --> 02:31:50,500
why can i hit this one oh got him get up oh uh-oh a little having a little trouble over here on this

1137
02:31:50,500 --> 02:32:07,319
side looks like i was fine until you came over oh my god dude oh the rule of threes

1138
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:18,620
you gotta have three separate sessions of the same event the developers of this game played

1139
02:32:18,620 --> 02:32:29,219
too much mario okay we're good okay let's go who is he talking to i i have no idea

1140
02:32:29,219 --> 02:32:34,860
i think you have to aim at this i'm just one of the voices inside your head

1141
02:32:35,739 --> 02:32:44,200
watch out what watch out for what i think you have to aim this or do i have to aim this

1142
02:32:48,969 --> 02:32:55,299
why is it heating up uh i don't i think you have to aim it there's no way for me to move it

1143
02:32:57,850 --> 02:33:06,409
oh hey dude aim your gun at mine aim your gun at mine aim your laser at mine okay okay

1144
02:33:07,049 --> 02:33:12,709
why is it not working oh you meant like at the thing behind you yeah yeah listen uh

1145
02:33:12,709 --> 02:33:17,110
grammatically speaking the nearest antecedent you said aim your laser at mine so i was aiming

1146
02:33:17,750 --> 02:33:24,600
my laser at your laser and then our lasers touch your words are using it too big dumb it down

1147
02:33:34,709 --> 02:33:38,389
where are you i'm coming up there's a guy on my side i think i have to wait for you

1148

1150
02:33:56,860 --> 02:34:02,889
uh kind of overlooking the did you throw a grenade at me did you did did you throw a

1151
02:34:02,889 --> 02:34:09,780
grenade at me just yes or no it's a very simple question yes okay your honor okay aim your laser

1152
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:17,899
at the thing back there what over the look oh that way here no yeah it's not throw grenade at friend

1153
02:34:17,899 --> 02:34:25,049
and kill friend i'm just trying to increase my chances for the scorecard at the end i had like

1154
02:34:25,049 --> 02:34:40,549
full health too what the fuck uh yeah there's a dude again oh this one's a mirror oh my goodness

1156
02:34:50,139 --> 02:35:04,969
oh yeah doing it right and we're free very good the madonna of sorrow this is no puzzles in this

1157
02:35:04,969 --> 02:35:12,870
game the rilling somebody said this is thrilling oh yeah and shit talking the streams yeah that's

1158
02:35:12,870 --> 02:35:23,610
a sniper rifle i'm gonna get the sniper if you didn't oh yeah yep did you shoot this

1159
02:35:23,610 --> 02:35:34,229
key oh you have to shoot something to open the gate for the key item or the bells all right so

1160
02:35:34,229 --> 02:35:44,020
you look like you got this down but to do them like all this this three they're fourth uh they

1161
02:35:44,020 --> 02:35:55,430
might be a fourth all the way at the end yeah there's one more down there is there even a bell

1162
02:35:56,459 --> 02:36:13,979
i don't yeah i don't see anything over there uh uh there's no there's definitely nowhere to go

1163
02:36:13,979 --> 02:36:28,360
over here it's a it's a secret hidden bell can we go up oh it's definitely there uh told the five

1164
02:36:28,360 --> 02:36:37,719
bells loud and clear and that's the truth i see it cheeky it's on the uh oops did that work where

1165
02:36:37,719 --> 02:36:45,879
is it spin i don't know if i just made this way harder to do oh wait is this supposed to you see

1166
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:52,280
it is spinning this is that five uh not quite i think i shot the actual weather

1167
02:36:52,280 --> 02:36:58,860
vein instead of the bell and made it spin faster i think that's ringing is there a fifth bell

1168
02:36:58,860 --> 02:37:05,239
one two three four on the oh yeah there's one back there yep i know where it is i get it teamwork

1169
02:37:13,049 --> 02:37:27,930
it was another rooster feels bad man very nice somebody said god this game sucks

1170
02:37:28,809 --> 02:37:34,889
wait you don't like you don't like two straight hours of non-stop action followed by two straight

1171
02:37:34,889 --> 02:37:42,340
hours of puzzles no did you hear that it's perfectly balanced i think i want to be the

1172
02:37:42,340 --> 02:37:51,590
sniper of the group you can't you picked melee i got crit yeah i didn't unlock melee i said i was

1173
02:37:51,590 --> 02:37:55,350
thinking about doing melee but i could be sniper rifle actually i don't think you said i think you

1174
02:37:55,350 --> 02:37:59,670
said i'm gonna be the melee guy it's very definitive get the fuck over there and do what

1175
02:37:59,670 --> 02:38:09,350
you're supposed to do this is what you're supposed to do you can't shoot the chandelier down why

1176
02:38:09,350 --> 02:38:17,819
not all right you can be the sniper sniper sucks and uh also everyone's just gonna make fun you

1177
02:38:17,819 --> 02:38:23,979
know if you miss because the the shaky cam is is so extreme while zooming in it's actually not bad

1178
02:38:23,979 --> 02:38:46,299
did you turn your um turn your aiming down did she stop drinking so much oh boss okay so when

1179
02:38:46,299 --> 02:38:54,120
they listen i understand umbrella umbrellas everywhere but how do people trapped in ancient

1180
02:38:54,120 --> 02:39:01,299
crypt chambers get infected like this like that yeah but like nobody nobody had opened that

1181
02:39:01,299 --> 02:39:08,659
potentially for centuries you know i'm saying yeah we just did it so who put the zombie there

1182
02:39:09,219 --> 02:39:15,540
and then resealed it no no you're not you're not doing protocol put them over in the cube

1183
02:39:15,540 --> 02:39:19,860
first saving them put them in the cube rifles put them in the cube first that's protocol

1184

1189
02:40:07,700 --> 02:40:14,620

1207
02:43:14,969 --> 02:43:35,100
whole house okay we got it it was like a pipe organ of one person survived okay i honestly thought

1208
02:43:35,100 --> 02:43:47,979
an npc came up and looted the key item that would be so funny it just runs away make sure

1209
02:43:47,979 --> 02:43:57,620
we don't miss anything this is important their blood is on your hands no their blood is on this

1210
02:43:57,620 --> 02:44:03,030
thing's hands this thing came in we think about how many more people would have died if we weren't

1211
02:44:03,030 --> 02:44:10,540
here i just tried to do it all right it doesn't work do it i just i tried it doesn't work do it

1215
02:44:39,540 --> 02:44:45,909
civilians that died i don't know if they drop anything by the way have you noticed any significant

1216
02:44:45,909 --> 02:44:50,760
increase in stuff that's dropped on the ground because i have not and we have both have that

1217
02:44:50,760 --> 02:44:56,760
perk i feel like it's not doing anything it's kind of hard to say it felt like there was a bunch of

1218
02:44:56,760 --> 02:45:01,319
stuff but that was also a boss fight so they kind of have to like litter the floor with things to

1219
02:45:01,319 --> 02:45:13,559
yeah not soft lock you all right we're uh ready to move perk does so little hard compatibility

1222
02:45:37,750 --> 02:45:42,149
characters we have a magnet like attraction to progressively more difficult enemies they're

1223
02:45:42,149 --> 02:45:46,309
literally safer the further they are away from us have you seen all the vehicular explosions

1224
02:45:46,309 --> 02:45:49,430

1241
02:52:13,829 --> 02:52:16,950
my stream you're supposed to i'm supposed to be muted on you why am i even on your stream you're

1242
02:52:16,950 --> 02:52:21,989
supposed to have muted me you unmuted to talk yeah but i should be deafened on your stream

1243
02:52:22,629 --> 02:52:25,590
yeah but i turned it on in case you wanted to like i don't know

1244
02:52:26,309 --> 02:52:33,190
be entertaining or something i don't know that's not my responsibility what the fuck dude listen i

1245
02:52:33,190 --> 02:52:42,680
just oh all right i won't be able to force this one open now what's your favorite pie

1246
02:52:44,729 --> 02:52:50,739
uh put me on the spot depends sometimes sometimes it's key line but not often

1247
02:52:50,739 --> 02:52:56,579
sometimes whoa you're a key lime pie that's why it's a context that's actually that's very

1248
02:52:56,579 --> 02:53:02,659
surprising pecan pecan would be like always okay or pecan depending on your regional preferences

1249
02:53:03,219 --> 02:53:05,540
key lime is an interesting choice though i don't know if i'd put that up there

1250
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:14,409
that's why i said sometimes we have to go this way somehow if i if i had like a coffee i feel like

1251
02:53:14,409 --> 02:53:24,760
key lime is pretty good key lime and coffee what the fuck are you drugs are you on uh all right

1252
02:53:24,760 --> 02:53:29,799
how do we get in there it's key key lime may just be like a leftover memory from like a nostalgic

1253
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:34,200
like olive garden experience or something do they have key lime pie at olive garden

1254
02:53:34,200 --> 02:53:40,059
they probably do i was somebody's go this way somebody's in here you have to shoot a lock open

1255
02:53:41,829 --> 02:53:48,229
homemade key lime with graham cracker crust yeah that's that's a combo the key lime has way too

1256
02:53:48,229 --> 02:53:54,899
big of a range for me of being awful to being very good it it really varies sometimes i've had

1257
02:53:54,899 --> 02:53:58,979
key lime pie before and it just tasted like fucking acid it just tastes like it's great okay but we

1258
02:53:59,059 --> 02:54:05,139
have to weigh everything at their best right okay all right like pumpkin pie at its best is still

1259
02:54:05,139 --> 02:54:13,420
worse well hold on pecan pie i would have agreed with you but i recently had pumpkin pie and

1260
02:54:14,139 --> 02:54:21,270
it was cold it was not hot and i think that changed everything for me uh how do we what

1261
02:54:21,270 --> 02:54:26,200
are we supposed to be doing here can we shoot that we're supposed to be looking we can look

1262
02:54:26,200 --> 02:54:33,110
in through these there was the blue box that you broke over here that was just loot why would you

1263
02:54:33,110 --> 02:54:38,100
eat a hot pumpkin pie i don't know do you eat pumpkin pie hot who eats pumpkin pie hot because

1264
02:54:38,100 --> 02:54:47,979
like the only right way to eat pumpkin pie is with whipped cream on top like whip uh i just

1265
02:54:47,979 --> 02:54:53,780
pressed bunch of i just pressed a bunch of buttons oh there's a guy kill that guy okay you got it

1266
02:54:53,780 --> 02:55:06,229

1267
02:55:06,229 --> 02:55:16,020
a second guy his head fell off whipped cream is not gross why would you say that whipped cream is

1268
02:55:16,579 --> 02:55:25,299
amazing whipped cream is disgusting i am fucking pissed right now what i'm seeing that a lot i'm

1269
02:55:25,299 --> 02:55:33,190
seeing people that keep saying it it's because they're uh they're wrong is it what what do they

1270
02:55:33,190 --> 02:55:38,229
just want to get they just want to get try zero uh oh no we have to guess the number it's a

1271
02:55:38,229 --> 02:55:43,190
combination there's a zero one and two in different orders so it's not the two is not at the end all

1272
02:55:43,190 --> 02:55:52,040
right 102 this that's a bad guy uh i'll open the other one what was it probably 201 he was taking

1273
02:55:52,440 --> 02:55:58,540
he was he was on the pee break too all right they're all open yeah whipped cream is great

1274
02:55:59,860 --> 02:56:05,799
it's really light it can go with anything if he's dead or not whipped cream really goes with

1275
02:56:05,799 --> 02:56:13,819
everything how am i getting hit by your pistol right now i don't know nobody behind us right

1281
02:57:05,770 --> 02:57:12,760

1282
02:57:12,760 --> 02:57:23,159
okay all right it's oh it's two okay it's two i don't know two one zero okay we're gonna i'm

1283
02:57:23,159 --> 02:57:29,459

1284
02:57:29,459 --> 02:57:45,899
one zero yeah it is c what would you say like that like i didn't i wasn't disputing anything

1285
02:57:45,899 --> 02:57:51,659
no no i'm talking about chat too chat is really being they're saying that that whipped cream is

1286
02:57:51,659 --> 02:58:00,620
not that great real what's the best the best pie what's the best pie um it's banana cream pie

1287
02:58:02,149 --> 02:58:05,670
that's a good pie but you already know where i stand on this and it doesn't matter

1288
02:58:05,670 --> 02:58:12,459
banana pudding is superior no it there's no crust though don't open one something too don't open

1289
02:58:12,459 --> 02:58:22,340
one all right i'm gonna open zero two one i think that was the right one it's a banana cream pie

1290
02:58:22,899 --> 02:58:29,780
banana cream pie and um chocolate cream pie and my favorites okay i can respect the chocolate

1291
02:58:29,780 --> 02:58:35,350
cream pie what about one two zero these are gonna if we want to get the loot we have to open all

1292
02:58:35,350 --> 02:58:44,649
the doors okay well let's do it but let me put a bomb in front of the the big boys one what was

1293
02:58:44,649 --> 02:58:53,930
that about headshots a second ago oh he morphed chocolate cream pie actually dodged that's what

1294
02:58:54,010 --> 02:59:03,180
you're supposed to do i think don't worry i got this no i'm laughing at the fact that auto mod

1295
02:59:03,180 --> 02:59:16,309
is deleting cream pie auto mod does not want you guys to say that word apparently oh i come

1296
02:59:16,309 --> 02:59:19,750
listen we're not allowed to have whipped cream anymore we're not allowed to have cream pie

1297
02:59:19,750 --> 02:59:25,750
anymore we can't all the words are being stolen from us i'm so sorry mods i just i find that very

1298
02:59:25,750 --> 02:59:32,540
humorous all right two uh two oh one i'm gonna put a bomb right in front of this guy because

1299
02:59:32,540 --> 02:59:39,290
this is like big boy okay if you open that one i'm ready one zero two uh that opened up something

1300
02:59:39,290 --> 03:00:00,860
else it's not even where we are 102 okay is he coming uh here he's coming nice there we go

1301
03:00:00,860 --> 03:00:18,420
and then 201 or 210 what do you think 201 um he didn't die 210 okay hey i got a cut scene

1302
03:00:18,420 --> 03:00:26,489
problem hold on you're right wait you can take cover but why is what's the point is this mechanic

1303
03:00:27,700 --> 03:00:33,459
oh because we're gonna run into all the shooting zombies i do more than no well what have i not

1304
03:00:33,459 --> 03:00:45,129
done 201 what oh two one no i think no gates because that one on the left can be two codes

1305
03:00:45,129 --> 03:01:02,940
yeah it's probably it's oh one two that's all of them yeah banana cream pie is at the top chocolate

1306
03:01:02,940 --> 03:01:09,610
cream pie is at the top as well somewhere there but i would not pick pie as a dessert i think it's

1307
03:01:09,610 --> 03:01:15,430
like pretty low for me wow what about cobbler that's kind of gross whatever i don't think

1308
03:01:15,430 --> 03:01:25,110
that's i think that's gross what you just said cobbler like alamode um like i don't like fruits

1309
03:01:25,110 --> 03:01:28,709
i don't like warm fruit like people think i'm crazy but not like an apple pie that's why

1310
03:01:28,709 --> 03:01:35,770
alamo you get the hot and cold no no it's not that's just i don't like it i didn't know i was

1311
03:01:35,770 --> 03:01:50,100
i didn't know i was friends with a cobbler hater it changes the dynamic oh nice um yeah i don't

1312
03:01:50,100 --> 03:01:55,459
like apple pie it seems like a messier pie what pie just seems like a messier cake so where do we

1313
03:01:55,459 --> 03:02:01,829
draw the line but i don't like turnovers either though you just don't like you don't like anything

1314
03:02:01,829 --> 03:02:06,309
with fruit no i don't like warm fruit it's like warm fruit filling it kind of just reminds me it's

1315
03:02:06,309 --> 03:02:14,520
like a dog vomit or something candy apple it's like human puke it's i don't like it human puke

1316
03:02:14,520 --> 03:02:26,010
you have the appetite of a five-year-old because i don't like apple pie maybe you just haven't had

1317
03:02:26,010 --> 03:02:32,090
a good one okay apple pie is only good with ice cream but then so is cobbler and most fruit based

1318
03:02:32,090 --> 03:02:36,809
yeah but are we going to judge the merits of a dessert based on adding another dessert to make

1319
03:02:36,809 --> 03:02:42,329
it better i think if you allow whipped cream you have to no i don't think so that's a secondary

1320
03:02:42,329 --> 03:02:46,979
thing you have to then we have to judge everything with no whipped cream that's fine banana cream

1321
03:02:46,979 --> 03:02:50,979
pie without the whipped cream is fine oh wait a minute cream in it wait a minute it's actually

1322
03:02:50,979 --> 03:03:00,139
not yeah first of all it's not second of all it cream is in the name cobbler alamo is that's

1323
03:03:00,139 --> 03:03:04,379
that's a whole ass dessert why do you order five of those from mcdonald's i don't i don't

1324
03:03:04,379 --> 03:03:13,479
order five apple pies wait yeah but mcdonald's apple pie is good must be close a good banana

1325
03:03:13,479 --> 03:03:18,920
cream pie is important it's very simple to make but it's impossible to master people go oh i i've

1326
03:03:18,920 --> 03:03:26,280
got the best banana cream pie son have it and it's dog shit it's fucking disgusting i i've had ramsey

1327
03:03:26,280 --> 03:03:31,000
of banana cream pie i'm serious like yeah i've had banana cream pie that was like mealy and mushy and

1328
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:37,159
it was supposed to be my secret recipe it was awful that's true what does tiramisu fit in this

1329
03:03:37,159 --> 03:03:45,940
um i like it but i wouldn't put it that high i think that's i think tiramisu and the banana

1330
03:03:45,940 --> 03:03:51,379
cream pie share a kinship which is a million different tiramisu exists but really like one

1331
03:03:51,379 --> 03:03:56,420
percent of them are are like 10 out of 10 but that's what i mean like it's it's really hard to

1332
03:03:56,420 --> 03:04:06,780
gauge some of these desserts because sometimes they can be made so poorly it's also it's also

1333
03:04:06,780 --> 03:04:12,360
like you know that's how i judge streams like 99 percent of them are shit but like the one percent

1394
03:13:39,110 --> 03:13:45,690

1395
03:13:45,690 --> 03:13:52,540
over there okay but i have to pull this lever which has a high probability of causing problems

1396
03:13:53,100 --> 03:14:03,299
so that gets us back out here i get it we have to stretch this level out

1397
03:14:03,299 --> 03:14:15,819
because we spend a lot of time on the art assets watch out god oh my goodness

1398
03:14:17,819 --> 03:14:32,379
oh my god oh my goodness oh my gosh it's getting crazy uh you're where are you pulling the next

1399
03:14:32,379 --> 03:14:45,180

1401
03:15:13,219 --> 03:15:17,219

1402
03:15:18,149 --> 03:15:21,110
i want to make sure nobody from their entire family shows up because they're gonna be kind

1403
03:15:21,110 --> 03:15:24,149
of like that person and i don't want to ever see them or anybody that's like them

1409
03:16:27,979 --> 03:16:33,399
game is why does everything seem so complicated that's what i'm saying as a player like the

1421
03:18:44,600 --> 03:18:53,190
hours why that's way too long they just started developing and then couldn't stop and then just

added 16 waves to each arena that they made i was gonna shoot you too that's horseshit

1423
03:19:02,889 --> 03:19:10,309
there are four different campaigns and you will be able to see those campaigns if you decide to

1424
03:19:10,309 --> 03:19:33,379

1427
03:19:56,299 --> 03:20:09,819
melee guy i think we have to open this door yep is it like a duel it's a double yeah this campaign

1428
03:20:09,819 --> 03:20:16,260
has the best story what's the story i like the part where they release the virus and the entire

1429
03:20:16,260 --> 03:20:23,450
city engulfs in flames you know what who has a harder life a civilian in a resident evil

1430
03:20:23,450 --> 03:20:30,819
franchise or like in the marvel universe because i feel like in both the city is constantly exploded

1431
03:20:30,819 --> 03:20:35,700
and nobody ever has to like actually clean up i've seen marvel for sure because like like somebody

1432
03:20:35,700 --> 03:20:43,399
can literally just drop like a kamehameha on you and kill like a million people yeah i like that

1433
03:20:43,399 --> 03:20:50,729
part in spider-man why can't you fill me in yet i mean literally the plot of infinity war is it

1434
03:20:50,729 --> 03:20:54,489
all right spoilers for infinity war if you haven't seen the fucking goddamn movie by this point

1435
03:20:54,489 --> 03:21:02,280
but like the whole plot of infinity war is that everybody dies right no no no no like i in i'm

1436
03:21:02,280 --> 03:21:06,520
the spoiler for if you haven't seen infinity where then okay you don't watch television

1437
03:21:06,520 --> 03:21:13,700
all right but i got i got an idea what about time travel though look if you put me into like a

1438
03:21:13,780 --> 03:21:16,979
grocery store and i have like 500 cans of shit boyardee and i put boards up

1439
03:21:18,659 --> 03:21:22,020
like mr mr like electricity man is not gonna be able to get into the building

1440
03:21:26,600 --> 03:21:32,120
right like i'll be fine like i just worry about zombies yeah but this is a this is a pathogen that

1441
03:21:32,120 --> 03:21:39,879
infects everybody possibly in the entire world like there's four campaigns you don't know this

1442
03:21:39,879 --> 03:21:46,600
could be like a globetrotting yeah but okay who's that little that guy that's like yes oh you're a

1443
03:21:46,600 --> 03:21:51,879
wizard too i am me as well oh i'm going to torture you and professor coral no no no he's

1444
03:21:51,879 --> 03:21:55,479
in the marvel movies is that guy like oh yeah he puts his hands up and he moves his hands around

1445
03:21:55,479 --> 03:22:01,979
people fly around and shit is like the doctor strange fight oh yes thanos i am your most

1446
03:22:01,979 --> 03:22:08,329
lovely lieutenant what's this they call him like the ma right i'm afraid of that guy i'm not afraid

1447
03:22:08,329 --> 03:22:17,909
of a zombie what about resident evil 2 zombies though what about mr x maybe but i can run away

1448
03:22:17,909 --> 03:22:25,670
from mr x if just run away from thanos if the if ma puts his hand up and points at me 500 light

poles are going to stab me through the chest like it's different we don't we don't have space

1450
03:22:29,270 --> 03:22:34,389
bearing technology that i know of in resident evil but like in in marvel they could just run

1451
03:22:34,389 --> 03:22:38,309
away like thanos still can't go faster than light he has to like catch you you could just

1452

right so you can't okay so i can't go down again good to know it's very important that i

1471
03:25:14,920 --> 03:25:19,879
don't left click okay as much as possible so where are we heading this way this person

1472
03:25:19,879 --> 03:25:24,440
really should have thought about their wardrobe before they came into the sewers beneath the

1473
03:25:24,440 --> 03:25:38,790
church get over here i also can't pick any items up where the fuck are you i'm right behind you i'm

1474
03:25:38,790 --> 03:25:46,489
following i'm not paying a single attention to anything that you've said in like the last 10 to

1475
03:25:46,569 --> 03:25:55,129
30 seconds the roof is caving in i said don't worry turn around me i'm following you i thought

1476
03:25:55,129 --> 03:26:01,559
you're going the other way i've been right behind you okay there's a guy right behind you i base

1477
03:26:01,559 --> 03:26:09,909
where you are based on gunshots like when i hear them whoa yeah that's the guy the guy's got a

1478
03:26:09,909 --> 03:26:30,469
machete all right are we good nope this guy good few people in the knees for fast melee finishers

1479
03:26:30,469 --> 03:26:42,540

1480
03:26:42,540 --> 03:26:55,879
that but then you change like mealy yeah mealy that actually is a great idea i'm gonna start

1487
03:28:01,989 --> 03:28:13,559

1509
03:32:42,920 --> 03:32:46,520
when you're mutant you can take five bullets instead of one like a normal wimpy here

1510
03:32:46,520 --> 03:32:58,790
in the back shoot you should put her down i love how in the cutscene i'm like no please spare her

1549
03:39:43,479 --> 03:39:53,620
to save help me thank you i think i just chose to save you and just let ada die i don't even see

1550
03:39:53,620 --> 03:40:04,260
ada i can't be the one that kills her it would be a question of conscience i have to save you

1551
03:40:05,139 --> 03:40:10,379
i know she's fine now it's fine if you just okay everybody knows that the way to defeat the virus

1552
03:40:10,379 --> 03:40:16,299
is enough bullets you just if you shoot this person long enough they'll turn back from zombie into

1553
03:40:16,299 --> 03:40:23,450
human please i know you're in there that was the dumbest thing i've ever heard

1554
03:40:26,579 --> 03:40:32,620
this is resident evil it's like just i was gonna think of something funny to say after that to

1555
03:40:32,620 --> 03:40:37,260
like make it look like that was me like saying that was funny but like i just couldn't think of

1556
03:40:37,260 --> 03:40:43,370
anything afterwards so i just made it just sounded like i just said you were dumb i'm i did not mean

1557
03:40:43,370 --> 03:40:47,940
it like that i was trying to think of something funny to say yeah but i was just making fun of

1558
03:40:47,940 --> 03:40:51,780
the game so you just said the game is because that's what happened that's what's happening right

1559
03:40:51,780 --> 03:40:58,180
now just keep your eyes on me this is the hidden backstory lore of these two characters we didn't

1560
03:40:58,180 --> 03:41:10,520
even know knew each other before now all right let's see what they have to say oh they're related

1561
03:41:10,520 --> 03:41:20,729
see that changes the whole dynamic no we knew that before didn't we i i didn't was i supposed

1562
03:41:20,729 --> 03:41:30,420
to i think we knew that before i have amnesia i helped simmons breach the president's security

1563
03:41:32,010 --> 03:41:40,409
name five characters in the game okay um leon debora ada debora helena lana long story is what

1564
03:41:40,409 --> 03:41:45,879
i don't think wesker's in this he's he's in every game isn't he he's definitely in like a lord

1565
03:41:45,879 --> 03:41:55,059
document at least we're up against the people who really run in a very dangerous game and if you

1566
03:41:55,059 --> 03:42:12,680
don't well that's not fair because there's only five characters in the game simmons there's five

1567
03:42:13,319 --> 03:42:22,840
hunnigan simmons okay we were in a voice call with someone but someone on video call overheard us

1568
03:42:24,309 --> 03:42:34,899
i guess by the way leon uh what happened um well we have a rank so i you know good job

1569
03:42:35,620 --> 03:42:40,010
double that's double a well what was the weapon that you were using for the most part

1570
03:42:40,649 --> 03:42:45,139
i mean i was a sniper remember nice you get to zoom in and just put it on somebody's back

1571
03:42:45,940 --> 03:43:00,219
yeah that that sucked that chapter was awful all right but i liked it better than being stuck

1572
03:43:00,219 --> 03:43:07,100
outside the mansion five times in a row because at least we got like a cool minecart segment

1573
03:43:08,579 --> 03:43:12,500
i actually have um all jokes aside i'm actually having this is actually a fun game i actually

1574
03:43:12,500 --> 03:43:18,729
don't care i mean it's not a good game but i'm having fun with the game as far as like resident

1575
03:43:18,729 --> 03:43:24,170
evils go i think this game aged better because it came on the heels of resident evil five

1576
03:43:25,370 --> 03:43:30,489
i mean resident evil five is way better by like a thousand percent that's what i mean there's

1577
03:43:30,489 --> 03:43:35,209
been time to breathe and we can acknowledge that it's shitty and like play it on purpose and

1578
03:43:35,209 --> 03:43:41,379
enjoy it in spite of itself all right we i got money we got money what's important here

1579
03:43:41,379 --> 03:43:45,620
it's not melee melees actually maybe it is here's the thing you have to decide whether to drop one

1580
03:43:45,620 --> 03:43:51,780
of your three or upgrade one of the existing ones for like more like i have crit that i can upgrade

1581
03:43:54,579 --> 03:44:09,979
oh i would probably want to break out no no no no no no how much more damage does the melee do

1582
03:44:09,979 --> 03:44:22,459
is it significant that's a lot of money not significant it only affects the knife oh that's

1583
03:44:22,459 --> 03:44:31,940
awful uh honestly defense level one kind of a new perk but feels like it'd be strong you're seeing

1584
03:44:32,819 --> 03:44:43,000
a critical hit sounds good rock steady no eagle eye if i'm gonna do sniper there's a

1585
03:44:44,469 --> 03:44:57,459
that magnification i only have eight thousand i spent all my money i don't know what to do i'm

1586
03:44:57,459 --> 03:45:03,879
dropping breakout we're just not getting grabbed how do you get rid of it uh you have to mount

1587
03:45:03,879 --> 03:45:08,920
you have to like escape or did we do oh i hit escape how do i unescape i didn't oh shit you

1588
03:45:08,920 --> 03:45:15,559
just did the cut the timer's gone oh no i only have two skills because game is using the escape

1589
03:45:15,559 --> 03:45:26,500
key both to progress and also to go back to like change the skills out i'm doing crits level two

1590
03:45:26,500 --> 03:45:36,059
i can't cancel the countdown i'm just stuck here okay um i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm

1591
03:45:36,059 --> 03:45:48,090
firearm no i don't know what to do about quick reload that sounds good to me quick reload sounds

1592
03:45:48,090 --> 03:46:03,020
good to me all right i think i'm okay with this i still have 8 000 points good so now one second

1593
03:46:03,020 --> 03:46:19,110
okay i think i'm good the president spoke highly of you agent kennedy like which one's agent kennedy

1594
03:46:19,110 --> 03:46:30,459
told me you were the only ones present at the time of his death what are you saying how do you know

1595
03:46:30,459 --> 03:46:39,579
a character is evil when they talk like you must be aware i'm the bad guy of this game at the time

1596
03:46:39,579 --> 03:46:44,219
of the attack um there's other characters that have talked like that in that tone that were good

1597
03:46:52,459 --> 03:46:56,459
although i can see this actor leaning into the microphone with his hand up

1598
03:46:56,459 --> 03:47:01,319
curling his fingers around while he says every line he's he's gripping the microphone

1599
03:47:01,319 --> 03:47:09,350
but just yeah he has like glasses on down at his nose looking down at the script his hand is up

1600
03:47:20,540 --> 03:47:23,659
someone said dude we can't even hear the game we don't know what you're talking about

1601
03:47:23,659 --> 03:47:30,379
is it really that low the the dialogue's low but the action's loud it's one of the it's not even

1602
03:47:30,379 --> 03:47:37,260
specific to this game that's like every video game and movie is it that hard to mix audio yeah like

1603
03:47:37,260 --> 03:47:42,540
sound effects mean gunshots and like footsteps and when the gunshots literally blow out your

1604
03:47:42,540 --> 03:47:50,040
eardrums and like everything else is too low yeah i know what you mean like you can't watch a movie

1605
03:47:50,040 --> 03:47:56,600
at home without having the remote in your hand the entire movie to just make micro adjustments

1606
03:47:56,600 --> 03:48:04,069
up and down yeah it's like you sit there and you just go like plus plus plus plus plus plus

1607
03:48:04,069 --> 03:48:08,069
during dialogue scenes and then when you know an explosion it sucks because you've been in that

1608
03:48:08,069 --> 03:48:13,989
position where like you're the quarterback of the television of the living room of the experience

1609
03:48:13,989 --> 03:48:19,030
you have to anticipate the next explosion and go down down down down down it sucks and you have to

1610
03:48:19,030 --> 03:48:23,430
get good at guessing what other people you may be watching with if you're watching like a party or

1611
03:48:23,430 --> 03:48:29,989
something yeah like how comfortable is another person with the audio being loud or quiet you

1612
03:48:29,989 --> 03:48:34,870
know like i have to i have to gauge that and it kind of like fucks up your viewing experience

1613
03:48:34,870 --> 03:48:39,739
because you have to think of two steps ahead of the movie oh there you go

1614
03:48:41,690 --> 03:48:54,440
bus lemon say yes you can you get all those things yeah i'm getting some loot you get it do you need

1615
03:48:54,440 --> 03:49:04,469
help how do you oh i got it i think i actually have to help you do this or something can you is

1616
03:49:04,469 --> 03:49:13,260
it like a co-op moment because it's like i'm i'm i'm pushing can you like v next to it yo you're

1617
03:49:13,260 --> 03:49:26,090
lied he's lied okay yeah oh there's a snake in there it was a jump kill that it has a golden

1618
03:49:26,090 --> 03:49:32,020
thing right that was actually pointless oh wait i thought that all the snakes in resident evil if

1619
03:49:32,020 --> 03:49:43,190
you kill them they have like money will drop and stuff annoying all the only things scarier

1620
03:49:43,190 --> 03:49:50,700
than zombies are skeletons it's called skyrim level this is kind of look like a skyrim dungeon

1621
03:49:51,659 --> 03:50:14,100
oh oh look what you found i walked right by this salt rifle nice so does every campaign reset your

1622
03:50:14,100 --> 03:50:19,700
entire loadout to zero i guess it does it's two different characters each time so yeah probably

1623
03:50:27,639 --> 03:50:32,500
down what you had down watch it watch it i think we have to slide on it crawling me

1624
03:50:33,299 --> 03:50:42,860
this people a lot of people over there follow them back here

1625
03:50:44,229 --> 03:50:51,670
we don't even use bullets pull them up pull them back here just let them die this is gonna be so

1626
03:50:51,670 --> 03:51:00,069
cinematic in about 30 seconds when they get over here each campaign has different weapons so that's

1627
03:51:00,069 --> 03:51:10,540
cool uh one of them learns to crawl oh i'm trying to help you well that was dumb i hate when zombies

1628
03:51:10,540 --> 03:51:16,700
are smart in media okay just make them dumb they're more scary that way because if they have

1629
03:51:16,700 --> 03:51:20,780
intelligence then what if you're eliminating a new intelligent life form that you're simply

1630
03:51:20,780 --> 03:51:25,100
too intimidated by dameron to stand up dameron to stand up and go back down i think you're good

1631
03:51:26,059 --> 03:51:34,200
i think i could probably get i'll tell you right now this is very important

1632
03:51:34,200 --> 03:51:38,600
that's strike two you got one more throw incendiary grenade at jeremy when he's doing

1633
03:51:38,600 --> 03:51:45,860
something you got one more you got one more that's strike three catch me if you can

1634
03:51:51,989 --> 03:51:59,959
okay i almost walked into if i if there was a drop kick button i could confirm would have

1635
03:51:59,959 --> 03:52:09,620
drop kicked you into it i may have done it why would you do he was just he's he likes fire he's

1636
03:52:09,620 --> 03:52:16,139
a pirate we have to go over here not going that way unless like playing with fire first person

1637
03:52:16,139 --> 03:52:27,909
to run into the blades gets ten dollars what do i look like a like a streamer uh the deal is

1638
03:52:27,909 --> 03:52:42,459
out me out for ten dollars i think i have to boost you so i good luck okay i think i have to just sit

1639
03:52:42,459 --> 03:52:54,659
down here what is happening do i have to do some oh oh it is a fast crawl so i just have to defend

1640
03:52:54,659 --> 03:53:05,610
because they're just going to be coming around the corner i'm waiting i'm crawling as fast as i can

1641
03:53:05,610 --> 03:53:11,139
erma don't go into the fire you'll burn your wellington thanks that's a good idea

1642
03:53:11,139 --> 03:53:21,430
i probably shouldn't wellington i want that person to like know that i loved that one

1643
03:53:22,229 --> 03:53:27,030
that was awesome am i supposed to do this as fast as i can or am i like helping you

1644
03:53:27,829 --> 03:53:38,459
ah there's probably kiss and kin kiss and kin simon's family tree i didn't bring any other how

1645
03:53:38,459 --> 03:53:43,100

1648
03:53:58,260 --> 03:54:02,899
it was just like i accidentally startled you when you fell asleep during a movie or something

1649
03:54:02,899 --> 03:54:15,750
the gift data so now should we get ready just changes the fire oh but we can just we have to

1650
03:54:15,750 --> 03:54:21,770

1651
03:54:22,489 --> 03:54:28,920

1654
03:54:47,079 --> 03:54:52,680

03:55:02,170 --> 03:55:18,139
after i heal oh there's a lot of people here oh they have armor ow that hit you somehow yeah

1657
03:55:18,139 --> 03:55:22,940
that was a finisher move like we have to collect all the shit on the bridge man come on

1658
03:55:24,469 --> 03:55:27,590
all right there's about you get on the thing there's a bunch coming i think you're closer

1659
03:55:27,590 --> 03:55:33,799
well now i'm closer i was getting all the stuff on the bridge all right i'm gonna spin it uh-huh

1660
03:55:34,440 --> 03:55:39,719
okay you spin it and i'll just stand next to you yeah and take care of the people that fall down

1661
03:55:40,360 --> 03:55:44,899
i'm trying but like i'm running out of shotgun shells and that's how i get my accuracy up

1662
03:55:50,709 --> 03:55:56,020
survive the zombie attack i don't even know if there's anybody else coming

1663
03:55:56,579 --> 03:56:13,940
it's where i wish probably take a look and make sure okay you need to do a stream where you try

1664
03:56:13,940 --> 03:56:21,700
to copy gordon ramsey's recipes i don't think i want to do that i've made gordon ramsey's eggs

1665
03:56:21,700 --> 03:56:33,399
before in the pan seer delicious coriander two delicious two two coriander please egg

1666
03:56:34,040 --> 03:56:45,430
crack simmer delicious it always says in by itself looks like we gotta get our feet wet

1667
03:56:45,430 --> 03:56:53,780
oh water oh we're going all over the place they're already using the like they use the

1668
03:56:53,780 --> 03:57:01,290
minecraft boss you got the water boss and this is just in the first chapter stewie griffin no

1669
03:57:01,290 --> 03:57:08,889
that was a gordon ramsey impression that was not stewie griffin i feel like there's something we

1670
03:57:08,889 --> 03:57:32,389
can whatever um okay just keep going that was the reveal for the boss later called foreshadowing

1671
03:57:34,409 --> 03:57:48,819
that means the same thing okay i'll just be doing the crawl animation again i probably have to get

1672
03:57:48,819 --> 03:57:56,659
ready to attack so i'm gonna make sure i'm ready there's someone in here i'm ready for i saw it i

1673
03:57:56,659 --> 03:58:01,700
just saw it i saw it it's coming closer what is that there's something coming closer there's

1674
03:58:01,700 --> 03:58:14,440
something here did i get it kind of on your own i don't know i don't know if i got it i think i

1675
03:58:14,440 --> 03:58:24,579
got it that's kind of hard there was one enemy in that entire tunnel it was just one enemy that's

1676
03:58:24,579 --> 03:58:35,180
weird why you blew up a fish uh there's items i don't have time for items i'm opening the door

1677
03:58:35,180 --> 03:58:47,260
right now what happened uh i have been grabbed and i am being drowned and the fish is got both

1678
03:58:47,260 --> 03:58:56,899
of us actually can you see this yeah okay i don't know if that was a me cut scene or a both of us

1679
03:58:56,899 --> 03:59:01,940
cut scene it sounded like you hit the uh the edge in operation that was just an office camera angle

1680
03:59:01,940 --> 03:59:14,700
of you it was it was the office there's a lot going on i'm oh there's literally no way out we're

1681
03:59:14,700 --> 03:59:19,899
gonna have to reload what there's another zero way out i can't even come to find you yeah i know

1682
03:59:19,899 --> 03:59:25,909
that's why i'm that wasn't me the game just spawned enemies on top of me after i did that

1683
03:59:26,469 --> 03:59:39,940
i hope we have a checkpoint right there oh my god are you okay no this is this is the worst

1684
03:59:39,940 --> 03:59:45,299
okay so i have to snipe that's what it wants me to do all right i'm back keep moving forward

1685
03:59:45,379 --> 04:00:07,770

1688
04:00:41,290 --> 04:00:53,000
seem fine i think i am can you get through now uh there's like an unnecessarily stand up on this

1689
04:00:53,000 --> 04:00:57,959
i'm sorry i'm freaking out for no reason jesus jeremy's just relax how are you supposed to get

1690
04:00:57,959 --> 04:01:06,920
through this why won't i stay on the ground do you turn this off um i think we have to just get

1691
04:01:06,920 --> 04:01:13,620
through both of our like gauntlets i don't think i can turn yours off there's another step jump

1692
04:01:13,620 --> 04:01:22,569
scared me the snake ran into the blue trap okay now just go forward oh it's because i have the

1693
04:01:22,569 --> 04:01:31,100
sniper rifle out that's why okay i'm just warning you there's a non-zero chance of me instant dying

1694
04:01:31,100 --> 04:01:42,200
over here uh i would say the same thing over here too this is incredibly fast and that's

1695
04:01:42,200 --> 04:01:55,770
definitely the way i'm supposed to go um you oh there's a guy there's a guy doing it i stopped

1696
04:01:55,770 --> 04:02:04,059
did i stop yours you stopped him yeah okay nice now i can do yours i think find the crank

1697
04:02:09,530 --> 04:02:12,250
what do you mean it's not even in here you think the developers forgot

1698
04:02:13,879 --> 04:02:24,020
uh this guy went to find a crank um did you find it you what did you just do

1699
04:02:24,020 --> 04:02:30,899
why did you do that i guess that okay there was no reason for you to turn it on yeah yeah there is

1700
04:02:30,899 --> 04:02:35,780
yeah there was this is the only time in the entire game that we've played up to this point

1701
04:02:35,780 --> 04:02:40,739
where a crank didn't do something beneficial i didn't know that was the crank you killed the

1702
04:02:40,739 --> 04:02:44,659
guy that was turning because i just turned a crank over here that opened the door why would

1703
04:02:44,659 --> 04:02:49,940
why would i think that the next crank that looks identical to that would all right well here's you

1704
04:02:49,940 --> 04:02:55,540
with uh sharp objects wait till i get across from this i didn't know what it was i just listen in

1705
04:02:55,540 --> 04:02:59,860
this game up till now you see a lever you pull it and something good happens okay i got baited by

1706
04:02:59,860 --> 04:03:07,700
the devs okay i i don't think i can do anything until you turn this that's not no that's not

1707
04:03:07,700 --> 04:03:15,530
strike three that was not an incendiary grenade close though almost he's close that was a that

1708
04:03:15,530 --> 04:03:25,819
was a foul tip no yeah no that means you caught it okay what do i do now the game tells you

1709
04:03:26,620 --> 04:03:44,729
to pull this why did i put that down oh my god reunite with your partner i'd love to

1710
04:03:46,139 --> 04:03:53,559
why does this not work okay you could just back oh shit he dropped something he dropped something

1711
04:03:53,559 --> 04:04:08,149
there's a key over here or something i shot that guy in the face three times oh man oh man oh man oh

1712
04:04:08,149 --> 04:04:22,469
man oh man oh man oh man all right uh i'm still just kind of chilling over here with the lever

1713
04:04:22,469 --> 04:04:35,420
that kills you why the fuck can i hurt these guys can you pull a lever on your side over there

1714
04:04:35,420 --> 04:04:41,420
there's a lever over here i need to get but it go pull that one but it's protected by these stupid

1715
04:04:41,420 --> 04:04:46,379
spitting guys that's just won't stop and i can't hit them with anything behind you no there's a

1716
04:04:46,379 --> 04:04:54,469
key on the ground over here oh my fucking god what i'm gonna scream at this game if you die

1717
04:04:54,469 --> 04:05:00,709
before i get over there why can i not hit this guy because they're waiting they're waiting for me

1718
04:05:01,270 --> 04:05:05,909
i shot that guy this night what do you have a clay helmet on oh i've got a clay helmet on i'm

1719
04:05:05,909 --> 04:05:11,110
immune to all damage that's that's just basic minecraft progression all right i need to i need

1720
04:05:11,110 --> 04:05:19,659
to get that all right am i really gonna sit here and watch you through the sniper as you slowly

1721
04:05:19,659 --> 04:05:26,299
crawl under the blades when i am near steps away from being on the same exact level as you

1722
04:05:26,299 --> 04:05:30,780
don't understand i have to go that way anyway i have to i have to get the crank you're gonna go

1724
04:05:44,409 --> 04:05:58,540
ready to turn the crank here we go thank you there's nobody coming after me right i hear

1725
04:05:58,540 --> 04:06:07,350
screaming but i don't see anybody all right i am through it's because he was below your line of

1726
04:06:07,350 --> 04:06:14,520
sight ah all right is this crank gonna murder you or i hope not i think it's gonna open this

1727
04:06:18,520 --> 04:06:31,129
oh shit how that there's no okay that was a movie action movie uh how did the bad guy hit only the

1728
04:06:31,129 --> 04:06:37,370
small thin piece of metal with the ricochet but not the person that they were aiming at and now

1729
04:06:37,370 --> 04:06:41,770
i'm now i'm not going to criticize that in a movie ever again i said if resident evil 6 is so bad

1730
04:06:41,770 --> 04:06:47,530
why are you playing it i think it's fun hey if the stream is so bad why are you watching it

1731
04:06:48,170 --> 04:06:53,940
so no don't say that looks like we're finally making it out of here i think i'm having a good

1732
04:06:53,940 --> 04:06:59,219
time this is really fun no yeah this is actually pretty fun game i'm at i'm not messing around i

1733
04:06:59,219 --> 04:07:07,219
really do think this is fun why can we not that was my i was on yours oh well sorry get the levers

1734
04:07:07,219 --> 04:07:24,260
confused somber music you're having fun playing explain the plot then it's a resident evil game

1735
04:07:24,899 --> 04:07:28,659
yeah but like i've played all the dark souls games i have no idea what's going on in the

1736
04:07:28,659 --> 04:07:44,420
dark souls games either or kingdom hearts i still played those you can't jump off the edge i was

1737
04:07:44,420 --> 04:07:51,719
testing you played kingdom hearts back up you didn't play kingdom hearts i mean i yeah i i

1738
04:07:51,719 --> 04:07:58,200
played kingdom hearts so i could watch when you walk away like six times in a row and then that's

1739
04:07:58,200 --> 04:08:02,620
pretty much the only reason i started a new game so i could watch the music video there was more

1740
04:08:02,620 --> 04:08:19,530
after that kingdom hearts one and two we're good there you go i would no i wanted to do that okay

1741
04:08:19,530 --> 04:08:26,069
so how much time is left in this campaign the leon campaign okay is it is it just me it feels like

1742
04:08:26,069 --> 04:08:29,750
listen we're having so much fun but i feel like we've been playing for seven hours but we've only

1743
04:08:29,750 --> 04:08:34,629
been playing for like three and a half just well no longer than that well i mean like the story

1744
04:08:35,190 --> 04:08:39,670
for like four hours but i promise you we're not gonna let simmons get away with all this okay

1745
04:08:43,829 --> 04:08:51,829
i was gonna do a cool snipe and i came out of the cutscene and they're going to kill me

1746
04:08:52,469 --> 04:08:57,899
they're not you just like playing kingdom hearts because when goofy goes

1747
04:08:59,260 --> 04:09:23,670
then that's true when he does what when he says boy i would kill to watch you play gears of work

1748
04:09:23,670 --> 04:09:30,069
co-op i don't think that would have the same charm i don't want to play gears of war i'd say

1749
04:09:30,069 --> 04:09:36,629
it's a the game it's it's cool i played it a lot like a long time ago but no i don't really think

1750
04:09:36,629 --> 04:09:44,840
so that would be like it would be so boring in comparison somebody said yeah i don't that really

1751
04:09:44,840 --> 04:09:49,559
is just to take cover and shoot there's nothing else going on especially like the first two of

1752
04:09:49,559 --> 04:09:56,969
them maybe they changed with the formula and like the last ones but i need help it's like okay

1753
04:10:00,700 --> 04:10:04,700
it doesn't have quite the same level of goofy cutscenes

1754
04:10:09,909 --> 04:10:15,829
are we supposed to just go i hate the guys that have the armor it's not fair

1755
04:10:16,629 --> 04:10:23,879
the rts is very good though i did play that the gears of war uh x-com game was actually good

1756
04:10:24,680 --> 04:10:32,469
was it yeah surprisingly here's one and two rule i don't even remember which one i played

1757
04:10:33,690 --> 04:10:40,809
because i definitely only played one of them i did not play like gears of war i don't remember i

1758
04:10:40,809 --> 04:10:54,940
think i feel like it's three they're pretty similar he's still not dead i don't know how

1759
04:10:54,940 --> 04:11:03,659
he's alive i just got inspired to make a beef wellington this christmas did you i thought

1760
04:11:03,659 --> 04:11:15,909
you were saying that i got really inspired i guess i know where i'm gonna be oops oops

1761
04:11:16,629 --> 04:11:23,020
yep it'd be a shame if i didn't click me there thanks for the assist partner i don't want to

1762
04:11:23,020 --> 04:11:27,100
make a beef wellington because beef wellington to me just looks like a weird corn dog hot dog

1763
04:11:27,100 --> 04:11:34,219
raw meat thing i don't want it it's just like a gigantic corn dog but it's raw in the middle

1764
04:11:34,219 --> 04:11:49,450
right out of the freezer but like thought watch out he's blending in okay i got you back okay

1765
04:11:49,450 --> 04:11:54,629
don't know what exploded can we knock the weight limit um i guess this is a cut scene we can't do

1766
04:11:54,629 --> 04:12:08,809
it what is he doing you got this um maybe i don't know nope he turned like 90 i may have planted a

1767
04:12:08,809 --> 04:12:15,340
bomb just wait till we can move away please he's gonna kill you he's gonna hit you right now i

1768
04:12:15,340 --> 04:12:20,620
knew it was gonna happen i knew it was gonna all right i'm in i'm in it we were supposed to

1769
04:12:20,620 --> 04:12:29,399
shoot the bridge oh i you killed me i didn't but i have you ever had a supposed to shoot the bridge

1770
04:12:29,399 --> 04:12:34,620
have you ever had a beef wellington before no okay i know everyone here's like everyone else

1771
04:12:34,620 --> 04:12:38,620
eat vicariously through gordon ramsay videos yeah but people kept kept just kept saying that's a

1772
04:12:38,620 --> 04:12:43,739
shit take worse take has anyone in this chat eaten a beef wellington before i feel like it's like

1773
04:12:43,739 --> 04:12:50,579
three of you i don't think anyone's even had this before listen there's not macaroni and cheese in

1774
04:12:50,579 --> 04:12:56,379
it they probably haven't tasted it i mean macaroni and cheese is based so all right let's get him to

1775
04:12:56,379 --> 04:13:03,750
run all right hurry because there's other guys so now we've when he's on the bridge we that was a

1776
04:13:03,750 --> 04:13:08,389
guy that wasn't me there was a guy to the bridge shoot the bridge shoot the bridge shoot the bridge

1777
04:13:11,190 --> 04:13:18,889
let's just run across the bridge run across the bridge i'm going as fast as i can here he comes

1778
04:13:20,409 --> 04:13:29,239
wait oh god oh fuck okay just how long do you have uh i have a little bit i've got like at least

1779
04:13:29,239 --> 04:13:35,719
five to ten seconds not he's he'll kill me if he gets another go across the bridge

1780
04:13:35,719 --> 04:13:42,620
run up can you get around it we don't just keep going this way there's nothing over here

1781
04:13:44,309 --> 04:13:57,459
this way he's coming he's coming he's coming all right another bridge we get him another place

1782
04:13:58,979 --> 04:14:07,190
there's two what do you mean there's two why is there two this is unfair what we're sandwiched in

1783
04:14:08,069 --> 04:14:14,940
oh my god we're not gonna be able to do this it did like a cut scene i could have revived you

1784
04:14:14,940 --> 04:14:19,260
well yeah this is bullshit because look at how much weight is currently on this thing and it

1785
04:14:19,260 --> 04:14:29,219
didn't fall are you serious listen umbrella uses only the best structural engineers okay how do

1786
04:14:29,219 --> 04:14:34,420
you think they made such a successful mutating campaign they had to start with let's not shoot

1787
04:14:34,420 --> 04:14:39,659
the bridge that didn't do anything okay why don't we just kill i got an idea just both of us plant

1788
04:14:39,659 --> 04:14:45,340
a bomb i'll just plant a bomb right here okay i'm gonna we'll just we'll plant one there don't

1789
04:14:45,340 --> 04:14:49,340
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait he's coming he's coming so i'm gonna run

1790
04:14:49,340 --> 04:14:56,940
oh no i'm gonna put my what the it won't let it won't let me run don't blow yours up yet

1791
04:14:58,219 --> 04:15:12,649
three two one blow it up wow all right we got dead i'm wasting so much ammo like an idiot

1792
04:15:14,250 --> 04:15:23,290
okay we need to do that again yep but that one's that guy's dead i got incendiary grenades i'm

1793
04:15:23,290 --> 04:15:42,819
just gonna throw it all right he's not coming this way oh god watch out thank you anytime okay get

1794
04:15:42,819 --> 04:15:50,420
some ammo is it this bridge i think it's the next one the one that goes up wait do we go down this

1795
04:15:50,420 --> 04:16:03,459
bridge um yeah it's the other way yeah it's the one that goes up it's easy to get turned around

1796
04:16:03,540 --> 04:16:12,120
in this particular wait area hold on are we stupid here no this is the right way but i think since we

1797
04:16:12,120 --> 04:16:16,440
died they took one of the big boys away to make it easy no he's here here he is i think he's here

1798
04:16:16,440 --> 04:16:25,739
yeah there's a guy behind us careful i'll go you you wait i'll go get him don't go too okay i hit

1799
04:16:25,739 --> 04:16:33,959
him with that throw that i did that guy has a bunch of fucking bombs all over him did it work

1800
04:16:34,360 --> 04:16:54,950
all right i kind of did closer that should be good oh my god die already he's dead okay that's

1801
04:16:54,950 --> 04:17:05,079
not bad watch there be a third one i'm gonna get a grenade out because i feel like this is gonna be

1802
04:17:05,079 --> 04:17:16,090
a third one i get a checkpoint though that's good i don't see another one devs uh can i get some new

1803
04:17:16,090 --> 04:17:23,579
content i need something to react to uh here's somebody i can't i honestly can't the guy just

1804
04:17:23,579 --> 04:17:27,899
spit in my eyes and turned me into rayman okay what's going on you spit in my eyes and turn me

1805
04:17:27,899 --> 04:17:33,180

1806
04:17:33,180 --> 04:17:40,059
i confirmed that the co-op moment so i'm just over here i'm in the like running crouch animation

1807
04:17:40,059 --> 04:17:55,479
ready to cross are you good thank you you snap me out yeah yeah nice not nice i saw the scene

1808
04:17:55,479 --> 04:18:00,920
of resident evil 5 uh is this the part where i punch the rock while you uh i think you have

1809
04:18:00,920 --> 04:18:06,440
to lower the bridge uh do you see any of these people over here that are crawling up behind me

1810
04:18:06,440 --> 04:18:11,000
i got you i got you i got you i'm not even kidding i seriously do okay this four of them though

1811
04:18:11,000 --> 04:18:16,360

1813
04:18:22,889 --> 04:18:27,879
i mean i have full health but sure there were four of them grabbing you i thought you just

1814
04:18:27,879 --> 04:18:45,129
jumped off the edge i feel like i need this oh boy watch out i got big i am i can just snipe

1815
04:18:45,770 --> 04:18:50,260
i'm gonna shoot the big guy just worry about the other guys big guys going down

1816
04:18:53,020 --> 04:19:00,309
shut the hell up that's my character said the guy is still alive he's i've been he's taking a lot

1817
04:19:00,309 --> 04:19:15,909
of damage though all right big guy dead okay cool looking good looks pretty good i want all that

1818
04:19:15,909 --> 04:19:26,260
stuff too though oh there's some there's some juicy skill points i think somebody behind me

1819
04:19:27,500 --> 04:19:35,739
no i am where are you i have you have to put the bridge down here okay i'm going the right way

1820
04:19:39,479 --> 04:19:47,079
i am currently sniping there's people coming over are your way um what the fuck was that

1821
04:19:47,079 --> 04:19:53,719
dynamite what guy had who had dynamite it's like i don't know they're just trapped with dynamite

1822
04:19:53,719 --> 04:20:07,610
for some reason but why did it blow up near me that was i don't understand that we're gonna get

1823
04:20:07,610 --> 04:20:15,500
an auto check he's doing all right he's in the other room this is extremely slow like

1824
04:20:17,100 --> 04:20:28,010
there's nobody coming after you yet oh they are now they're on your side oh i got like 85

1825
04:20:29,299 --> 04:20:35,700
you got a guy right behind you 95 it's over okay now don't be mad at me for running down the whole

1826
04:20:35,700 --> 04:20:45,110
bridge because i want to get all that stuff kill the zigzag he's still alive oh i need bullets

1827
04:20:45,750 --> 04:20:52,840
that was actually really cool yeah the drop kick's fun um but you have to like queue it up let me go

1828
04:20:52,840 --> 04:20:59,299
get this i can't go get this stuff that's so unfair what all i can't get it skill points

1829
04:20:59,299 --> 04:21:05,590
i don't think you do are we as literally a huge rock they had to know let's push it

1830
04:21:06,229 --> 04:21:17,780
derma lost auto in his huge mansion right behind you

1831
04:21:24,860 --> 04:21:35,510
that was very scary did you shoot that guy no he fell all right hold on i need to do this i mean

1832
04:21:35,510 --> 04:21:41,190
we it took both leon and helena to push a rock whereas chris pushed it by itself so i guess he's

1833
04:21:41,190 --> 04:21:48,139
at least as strong as both of us combined first redfield yeah that's the other that's the fifth

1834
04:21:48,139 --> 04:21:53,750
character in this game i wouldn't be surprised he's show i think he has a whole campaign help me

1835
04:21:54,309 --> 04:22:07,110
i don't know what i did can you tell the people behind me to wait oh boy all right watch out

1836
04:22:07,110 --> 04:22:13,239
behind us hey uh manage your inventory real quick and then heal i got it thank you thank

1837
04:22:13,239 --> 04:22:28,180
your name was red it was bothering me oh on the wrong side so okay uh yeah there are noises

1838
04:22:28,180 --> 04:22:35,290
this progress bar i would say we should probably stop right now stop i okay and

1839
04:22:35,290 --> 04:22:41,239
fight how do we get off we're just one person oh come on it falls all the way back

1840
04:22:45,129 --> 04:22:51,530
was that like a developer meme i think that was just like a gotcha moment i was like oh you thought

1841
04:22:51,530 --> 04:22:58,170
you were gonna have to do the entire bridge or we or we fucked it somehow and we like

1842
04:22:58,170 --> 04:23:06,469
fucked it up somehow we gotta go fast i think we fucked it up oh shit are you okay yeah are you

1843
04:23:06,469 --> 04:23:18,819
are you i think so thanks for your concern big boy gotta go um b that was a sonic losing all

1844
04:23:18,819 --> 04:23:36,440
the rings moment you good yep okay you somehow landed there's way too it's too many okay there's

1845
04:23:36,440 --> 04:23:47,829
too much going on are you good i think so jesus are you all right yeah this is ground shaking

1846
04:23:47,829 --> 04:23:54,469
we keep just going you good are you okay oh are you okay man you good you think okay you good

1847
04:23:55,799 --> 04:24:03,799
someone put another two person boulder here that those are the like indiana jones the ones who

1848
04:24:03,799 --> 04:24:10,760
got squashed we made it did you ever think about how difficult it would be to reset the traps in

1849
04:24:10,760 --> 04:24:15,639
those temples they give you just one guy in the trigger all they only have to happen once

1850
04:24:21,020 --> 04:24:26,299
if you're good enough to get into the temple then you're like the earnest level threat yeah but what

1851
04:24:26,299 --> 04:24:29,819
i'm saying is like what if you get what if you like 80 of the way through but the last one gets

1852
04:24:29,819 --> 04:24:36,170
you like they have someone has to go in and reset all the other traps before the next guy comes in

1853
04:24:38,760 --> 04:24:43,639
are we supposed to i know is this a screen saver like what's happening it's just a cut scene

1854
04:24:44,600 --> 04:24:50,170
stop trying to make that a thing no i'm going to continue to try to make that a thing what what

1855
04:24:50,170 --> 04:24:59,559
thing uh earnest um all right so we have to swim earnest christmas special yeah all the earnest

1856
04:24:59,559 --> 04:25:05,479
movies are required reading yeah they're pretty good there's a space bar thing here yeah it says

1857
04:25:05,479 --> 04:25:13,209
perform stroke right oh there's like an air pocket i think wait there's an air pocket yeah you swam

1858
04:25:13,209 --> 04:25:19,399
past it i press spacebar so i get breath well hopefully i find an air pocket up here found an

1859
04:25:19,399 --> 04:25:34,440
air pocket good all right which would you rather do this whole section again or um i give you a

1860
04:25:34,440 --> 04:25:39,000
like ocarina of time water temple save and you have to start there i'd rather do this a thousand

1861
04:25:39,000 --> 04:25:55,159
more times 80 meters all right where's the air pocket i did you which i don't know which way

1878
04:27:59,079 --> 04:28:11,559

1879
04:28:11,559 --> 04:28:17,700
dog jump in the water to come rescue you way down you just have to survive i am in the mouth

1880
04:28:19,510 --> 04:28:23,510

1882
04:28:30,889 --> 04:28:41,940
uh i don't know why i thought that okay let's go it's space and r the two dumbest combinations

1883
04:28:42,659 --> 04:29:01,020
i kind of i actually just wanted to see what would happen it's incredible that my human strength

1884
04:29:02,170 --> 04:29:23,530
capable of stopping that okay here we go space and r i'm ready space plus r you fell off fine okay

1885
04:29:24,409 --> 04:29:39,049
uh i got it mine's just mash keys all right i got space plus r ready shiny bit in the in the middle

1886
04:29:39,770 --> 04:29:54,760
all right i'll get it it's like a are we holding our breath this long is what i want

1887
04:29:54,760 --> 04:30:01,159
uh don't worry about that just stab the weak spot together probably probably both of us using a

1888
04:30:01,159 --> 04:30:10,780
spear at the same time i think so are you okay i'm good i'd spam i'm up in the mouth and shadow

1889
04:30:10,780 --> 04:30:16,709
the colossus are you at the stomach i don't know i think i was just like waiting for you

1890
04:30:17,510 --> 04:30:26,469
i was in there hanging out oh now you got the office camera now oh you're in the water with it

1891
04:30:26,469 --> 04:30:40,870
okay find a place to climb up find a place to climb up okay where we're here uh there's a tunnel

1892
04:30:40,870 --> 04:30:47,450
that you can swim through that's over towards me i think they just want you to go through the tunnel

1893
04:30:47,450 --> 04:30:57,510
oh and then i will get jump scared i said i find a thing to climb up i didn't know

1894
04:30:57,510 --> 04:31:00,870
we'd like go through the tunnel and around the whole level i'm looking for like a little ladder

1895
04:31:00,870 --> 04:31:04,469
on the edge oh you thought this was over this we're only like a third of the way through this

1896
04:31:04,469 --> 04:31:14,840
level i think i you you have to open this helena can you do something about these bars i'm working

1897
04:31:14,840 --> 04:31:23,049
on it leave me alone try hold on what if i just left you uh you would die oh you want i see this

1898
04:31:23,290 --> 04:31:33,510
this is testing past mechanics thank you i tried looks like i can get up over there but the fish

1899
04:31:33,510 --> 04:31:49,030
is probably going to jump up is that going to be ready there it is they make it uh are you live

1900
04:31:49,030 --> 04:32:05,819
yes you're welcome i'm telling you mario boss okay one more time we're gonna jump on its head one

1901
04:32:05,819 --> 04:32:20,500
more time uh okay weird spot and what am i supposed to do about this i didn't do anything

1902
04:32:20,500 --> 04:32:25,879
yeah i shot it why is it on the bridge i'm on the bridge above you watching you gotta start

1903
04:32:25,879 --> 04:32:36,680
swimming it's giving me all these prompts and then to take it away from me okay very nice time to

1904
04:32:36,680 --> 04:32:43,719
actually fight the fish right i imagine that's what's happening here hello how are you i made

1905
04:32:43,719 --> 04:32:50,809
it and i am ready to not crawl through this but rather use our combined strength to push it

1906
04:32:58,010 --> 04:33:10,520
okay um defeat the b.o.w why it's slow wait feed it barrels it's got this explosive barrels

1907
04:33:13,990 --> 04:33:19,590
um apparently the edges of the screen i feel like we're going into hyperspace i can't even

1908
04:33:19,669 --> 04:33:45,159
look at this this is a warp gate yeah this sucks um we're good wait for a barrel oh barrel yep

1909
04:33:45,159 --> 04:33:55,799
right now i'm reloading um right i think we're good not kill us i think we're okay did we just

1910
04:33:55,799 --> 04:34:00,680
beat it this is what it's like to get stuck in the water park i feel like we weren't supposed

1911
04:34:00,680 --> 04:34:17,500
to win that fast nice bit rate yeah bit rate is dead yeah i'm in the same we were sliding down

1912
04:34:17,500 --> 04:34:23,500
there for like 45 how did we get outside we were falling through a very long tunnel we would be

1913
04:34:23,500 --> 04:34:32,729
like a thousand meters underground there's a nuke that just went off so they're destroying the place

1914
04:34:40,009 --> 04:34:45,540
you do an impression of daniel day lewis in um where there would be blood sure i actually

1915
04:34:45,540 --> 04:34:48,819
haven't seen that movie

1916
04:34:49,459 --> 04:34:58,169
that's why you are all right that's a good one for when they're attacking leon can we get

1917
04:34:58,169 --> 04:35:04,169
another one with a little bit more uh energy i think that's pretty accurate

1918
04:35:10,439 --> 04:35:14,360
somebody said i that was a bad impression because i hate that movie that's not how it works

1919
04:35:15,540 --> 04:35:17,860
you're farming nominations over the end of the year

1920
04:35:18,659 --> 04:35:33,830
the bsaa confirmed it was so many bioterrorism attacks we just can't contain them all

1921
04:35:37,900 --> 04:35:43,020
it's nothing we can do umbrella is rated a plus by the better business bureau out of our hands

1922
04:35:45,939 --> 04:35:49,939
and right now you two are on the top of their list of suspects that sounded like a pokemon

1923
04:35:53,689 --> 04:36:15,369
no what pokemon sounds like that listen no it didn't what pokemon are you talking about

1924
04:36:15,369 --> 04:36:29,880
is this the end of his chapter we may have just beat this yeah oh look at all these accolades

1925
04:36:31,830 --> 04:36:38,979
s rank i got gold though you got silver now this is platinum mine has a crown my metal has a

1926
04:36:39,540 --> 04:36:47,450
royal crown on it and a wreath your your wreath is wilting mine is flexing you're getting outgamed

1927
04:36:54,340 --> 04:37:05,560
oh shit okay okay i can actually put a third skill in now we have 30 000 bucks i want to

1928
04:37:05,560 --> 04:37:12,759
know how bad that was i'm gonna watch the vlog later and say how bad it was i can't buy anything

1929
04:37:16,540 --> 04:37:21,419
how i had 8 000 left over from last time but well because you got kicked out remember

1930
04:37:21,419 --> 04:37:27,180
you hit like escape so you should have a lot of money right now i got 30k you should have like

1931
04:37:27,180 --> 04:37:40,340
20k at least no 13 there's a lot of single player only ones speeds up recovery time when dying what

1932
04:37:40,340 --> 04:37:47,139
does that even mean maybe i'll do firearm what's combat gauge is that a mechanic we should know

1933
04:37:48,700 --> 04:38:11,779
item drop thing i don't know not into i uh i'm good okay uh trying to i got 28 000 more points

1934
04:38:12,419 --> 04:38:21,369
i'm dropping items how many chapters are left um i would assume it's probably five or two in leon's

1935
04:38:21,369 --> 04:38:26,569
campaign or in the whole game in this campaign games oh i don't know there are two more for leon's

1936
04:38:26,569 --> 04:38:35,880
story okay i thought the daniel day lewis impression was good but i have not seen the movie

1937
04:38:35,880 --> 04:38:46,950
i've only seen one clip that's what my impression was based off of where's the thing i unlocked

1938
04:38:46,950 --> 04:39:02,250
what is happening uh what's wrong i'm trying to like there we go all right the ui is the problem

1939
04:39:02,889 --> 04:39:10,340
everything okay the item drop skills probably why you have so much more we got some item drop skill

1940
04:39:10,979 --> 04:39:18,790
users oh i had item drop on oh no because you you got to run that whole section

1941
04:39:18,790 --> 04:39:25,900
i yeah i did get like a big bridge with a lot of stuff you can hit escape anytime by the way

1942
04:39:25,900 --> 04:39:47,509
oh i thought i didn't know this plane is dead it's already dead on our way to china okay we're gonna

1943
04:39:47,509 --> 04:40:04,490
have a skydiving segment we might look how much space there is what are we have like a

1944
04:40:06,259 --> 04:40:11,130
passenger jet i don't know if somebody asked me if i'm an organ donor why is that why are you asking

1945
04:40:12,090 --> 04:40:18,180
what's your blood type i have no idea wouldn't stop Simmons do you know your blood type i actually

1946
04:40:18,180 --> 04:40:36,020
don't i have no idea no i actually don't know telling you find a boss zeus i'm very curious

1947
04:40:36,020 --> 04:40:46,680
what the boss will be on this campaign where's the emp in here no they turned into these things

1948
04:40:47,240 --> 04:40:58,439
we nuked it but what one of these things is in here yeah it's the dark souls uh you thought this

1949
04:40:58,439 --> 04:41:05,540
was a boss but now it's a normal elite enemy oh he's doing this on the plane oh my goodness

1950
04:41:06,259 --> 04:41:23,610
just open up the door back up throwing it back up just suck them out we can't go back any further

1951
04:41:23,610 --> 04:41:41,880
okay uh oh that's a new gun lightning hawk uh deagle that's actually pretty cool hey do you

1952
04:41:41,880 --> 04:41:47,270
know how to fly this thing there's something wrong with you're gonna go back to the tail of the plane

1953
04:41:47,270 --> 04:41:53,099
find out what's wrong it's the magnum nice i'm saving this to the last 10 seconds of the game

1954
04:41:57,380 --> 04:42:01,939
there's a lot of fairly calm people who are about to turn into zombies yeah

1955
04:42:03,139 --> 04:42:09,799
they're like already sitting yeah they're already they've been sitting calm down everyone relax

1956
04:42:09,799 --> 04:42:17,860
don't panic we're just two heavily armed civilians running through the plane looking for the zombie

1957
04:42:18,580 --> 04:42:23,590
it's just men in black music i mean there's a lot of people in suits with sunglasses so

1958
04:42:24,229 --> 04:42:45,700
might be onto something here i can't even hear it i'm going down how deep does this plane go i

1959
04:42:45,700 --> 04:43:00,060
i don't know here we go five grand do i have to help you i got it the big red valve nobody's

1960
04:43:00,060 --> 04:43:10,409
coming so hold on there's nobody flying the plane right now right correct this is kind of weird i

1961
04:43:10,409 --> 04:43:17,049
assume it's on autopilot but also there's a hole in the ceiling of the plane and uh hot steam

1962
04:43:17,049 --> 04:43:24,680
pouring out of some oddly placed i think we just have to be quick about it did you just shoot the

1963
04:43:24,680 --> 04:43:34,229
lap this is the part where wesker comes in and says uruburus i don't think the uruburus thing

1964
04:43:34,229 --> 04:43:37,990
was in this game was it i thought they got rid of that and it didn't they move to something else

1965
04:43:37,990 --> 04:43:44,380
like i just like saying it because the resident five and they're also in a plane like this one

1966
04:43:44,380 --> 04:43:50,229
when he says it he comes in through like the back i think we made it in time

1967
04:43:53,830 --> 04:44:00,650
oh god what if what if uh the monster in alien looked like that crawling

1968
04:44:03,290 --> 04:44:09,130
that would be kind of cool like 79 i don't even open the hatch we gotta get the gas out of here

1969
04:44:10,169 --> 04:44:17,830
it's just it's that's just a that's just a how do we open the hatch oh shit right here super soaker

1970
04:44:18,549 --> 04:44:22,700
all right protect me i gotta open this he's getting closer

1971
04:44:23,659 --> 04:44:46,169
oh i'm gonna try again all right let's dump him get dumped uh we're lighter than it he's gone

1972
04:45:00,490 --> 04:45:09,819
we would have wouldn't be flown off already holy shit see you later i was not ready for the space

1973
04:45:09,819 --> 04:45:15,959
r you've had more practice with that than me just curl up into a ball and hope for the best

1974
04:45:18,709 --> 04:45:22,389
hey anytime you wonder what happened to your luggage next time you take a flight just remember

1975
04:45:22,389 --> 04:45:27,509
this could be your passenger flight and you just don't know space plus r judge

1976
04:45:28,819 --> 04:45:44,779
dude you fucking fell off who's going through i almost got hit by that one i'm gonna win i'm

1977
04:45:44,779 --> 04:45:58,259
gonna win you just spread the virus that's true we just dumped that thing on top of the city

1978
04:46:00,150 --> 04:46:14,659
not my problem anymore oh okay elena we have to go i have zero shotgun left oh great everybody

1979
04:46:15,619 --> 04:46:35,099
everybody turned plane is infected yeah i'm just gonna i'm just running i okay i'm

1980
04:46:36,279 --> 04:46:44,840
guys i already used so much like of my don't ever make that joke again shit it's alex i need you to

1981
04:46:44,840 --> 04:46:52,650
say something for me uh-huh i want you to say that i say i and we injected and we ejected

1982
04:46:53,450 --> 04:46:58,090
ejected somebody that is like pretending to be somebody else what would you call that person

1983
04:46:59,049 --> 04:47:03,610
we ejected somebody that was trying to be somebody else like somebody that was

1984
04:47:04,169 --> 04:47:07,369
you know putting on like a costume to pretend to be somebody what would what would you call that

1985
04:47:07,369 --> 04:47:19,189
person um call that a really really badass halloween party no it's i can't shoot the gun

1986
04:47:24,599 --> 04:47:28,970
is it kind of like uh in the thing where there's like a crew of people but one of them

1987
04:47:30,340 --> 04:47:42,180
is not actually a person yeah i think we took too long this thing's going down man um so what do we

1988
04:47:42,180 --> 04:47:55,590
do hold on all right is it is it like when when they're being too noisy and you have to go

1989
04:47:55,590 --> 04:48:07,529
shush i have to you do something no okay i have to first switch off the autopilot to restore um

1990
04:48:07,529 --> 04:48:15,529
and where is that third button i didn't hear anything that she just said i think i started

1991
04:48:15,529 --> 04:48:26,409
a fire i said no i did that just pressing button try it again okay i think i got it

1992
04:48:28,009 --> 04:48:40,889
all right i am just hold the lever the people we ran past i guess are you steering this or is

1993
04:48:40,889 --> 04:48:54,150
it i'm flying the plane technically now what uh what are you talking about two different things

1994
04:48:54,150 --> 04:49:07,319
900 feet i'm doing it you're making the zombies fall down they like couldn't stand up oh we got

1995
04:49:07,319 --> 04:49:28,020
like this is rendered it's cinematic we should have taken the train like ada actually possibly

1996
04:49:28,020 --> 04:49:37,259
like tens of thousands dead and that would have they just kept them to up the ante first they

1997
04:49:37,259 --> 04:49:42,860
were crashing ambulances now we're crashing uh subways then trains then uh going straight

1998
04:49:42,860 --> 04:49:49,610
to like double decker planes what are we gonna crash next you can't keep one up on yourself

1999
04:49:49,610 --> 04:50:09,430
i see a ladder i wouldn't go we're gonna go there and get the item who's that that's no that's um

2004
04:50:52,360 --> 04:50:59,220
leon's not just anyone he saved my life back in raccoon city okay it's it started with like

04:50:59,220 --> 04:51:07,159
inflection and it just became like a like a regular reading oh look out evil three boss

2110
05:10:17,799 --> 05:10:23,400
a meat grinder sir i don't really know why the meat grinder was turned on in this abandoned

2111
05:10:23,400 --> 05:10:30,119

2115
05:11:00,709 --> 05:11:10,139
with a blank stare while just with getting double grinded you think there'd be a little

2116
05:11:10,139 --> 05:11:16,490
bit more of a reaction from that person doesn't know weaponized meat grinders it clearly worked

2117
05:11:17,049 --> 05:11:22,569
like why don't we just get like a transportable meat grinder to fight those zombies with

2118
05:11:22,569 --> 05:11:32,700
it ada just leave the door please just leave the door unlocked so we don't have to go around

2140
05:16:37,459 --> 05:16:42,549
computer okay so i will make sure i'm going to defend you with my pistols with your pistols

2226
05:30:12,779 --> 05:30:18,060
what you said yeah yes but do you not agree that because people didn't know what i was talking

2227
05:30:18,060 --> 05:30:23,689

2229
05:30:47,689 --> 05:30:52,090
what a waste of a sequence right why didn't we just show up on top of the train we just walked

2230
05:30:52,090 --> 05:30:56,650
through the train we didn't even need to do that now we're gonna be on top we're trying to get to

2231
05:30:56,650 --> 05:31:03,290
the next story area this is real time travel that is just teleport to the next like fighting zone

2232
05:31:03,290 --> 05:31:06,169
the bad guy's on top of the train in the front we're catching him right here

2233
05:31:06,889 --> 05:31:25,130
we've got you the hair a traitor 801 i recognize this guy who's his voice actor

2234
05:31:27,290 --> 05:31:37,459
yeah i i recognize it too oh i know and he disclosed the truth behind i know who it is

2235
05:31:37,459 --> 05:31:42,819
you the u.s would have lost all its authority it's right on the tip of my tongue he's an anime voice

2236
05:31:42,819 --> 05:31:53,779
actor and he's in the dub of jujutsu kaisen among other things oh is it um tuna salmon he's the he's

2237
05:31:53,779 --> 05:32:15,930

2238
05:32:15,930 --> 05:32:24,860
did you pop the cap off or something yeah all right

2239
05:32:37,849 --> 05:32:45,159
looks like a pokemon back up we know there's nowhere to go oh shit okay

2240
05:32:49,540 --> 05:32:59,349
sure that was a really bad cut in a movie but i tell you though we had to end up on top

2241
05:32:59,430 --> 05:33:11,770
of the train and then oh man we gotta get up i can't honest to god i can't think of a worse

2242
05:33:11,770 --> 05:33:16,810
thing to put in the game than to have it be like a slide if you press the button like who wants

2243
05:33:16,810 --> 05:33:31,060
the slide nobody wanted the slide the slide just causes problems what do we do when we get to this

2244
05:33:31,060 --> 05:33:37,220
end of the train all right he's on top he's gonna smash through i already pushed space see if you

2245
05:33:37,220 --> 05:33:46,020

2246
05:33:46,020 --> 05:33:50,419
boy are all the characters in this game like brian oh wait wait come here come here eric

2273
05:38:53,369 --> 05:39:01,459
a sniper rifle i shot him like two or three times with a sniper this is really this is the worst

2274
05:39:01,459 --> 05:39:06,819
boss fight of any resident evil game i think yeah but that's why it's kind of why i actually like it

2275
05:39:07,540 --> 05:39:11,299
we didn't even really get a chance to fight him like it was just kind of shoot him a little bit

2276
05:39:11,299 --> 05:39:16,630
and then there's a cutscene where we teleport around and he gets hit by a train i just love

2277
05:39:16,630 --> 05:39:22,630
how much time went into the like seven different cutscenes that are mostly uninteractable that lead

2278
05:39:22,630 --> 05:39:33,139
up to this point this is very bizarre there's actually more the world will be a better place

2279
05:39:33,939 --> 05:39:41,799
oh that's what it reminds me of the edge of tomorrow enemies except with more bones

2280
05:39:43,000 --> 05:39:49,240
yo that was sick good thing didn't even move yeah you shot the metal away from my face so i could

2284
05:40:49,099 --> 05:40:58,360
the game difference in this game sucks and game sucks there yeah there is a difference are we still

2285
05:40:58,360 --> 05:41:06,409
in the same chapter head for the mission objective we're absolutely at the finale coming up here

2286
05:41:07,909 --> 05:41:20,599
did we finish it we did what we could let's go excuse me excuse me the next chapter is the finale

2287
05:41:21,159 --> 05:41:30,360
i've got to complete the objective i've got to obtain the data remember just wants the game to

2288
05:41:30,360 --> 05:41:38,729
end yes do you though yeah all right well i better check to see if i have any fire bombs left

2289
05:41:44,630 --> 05:41:49,900
now we're gonna get one big giant finale in the last chapter but we haven't gotten the rocket

2290
05:41:49,900 --> 05:41:54,659
launcher yet that's how you know the game's almost over they give you a rocket launcher

2291
05:41:54,659 --> 05:41:59,939
with like three shots in it and they say end the game definitely infected people

2292
05:41:59,939 --> 05:42:08,650
who are just going to go to some safe house and mutate it's not it's not over the prologue

2293
05:42:08,650 --> 05:42:25,299
literally has an unfinished business here we go is it we gotta get the data what i tell you we

2294
05:42:25,299 --> 05:42:36,150
didn't get the data this is the key to stopping the sea virus it's jake is naked chris redfield

2295
05:42:36,150 --> 05:42:50,360
it's the chris redfield gift hey leave it alone ethan that's uh we're going to space

2296
05:42:53,880 --> 05:43:03,750
i don't yeah who is who is jake i've never heard of jake game is he from i don't think we have what

2297
05:43:15,380 --> 05:43:23,349
now the question is is this a traditional or is this a mutation bomb this is yeah this is a

2298
05:43:23,349 --> 05:43:43,340
infection where it makes everybody a zombie it's that same gas if i were a world superpower in

2299
05:43:43,340 --> 05:43:50,619
this universe i would invest a lot more in like air defense like anti-missile and he said why

2300
05:43:50,619 --> 05:43:57,849
don't they why don't they just make a big peepee virus i mean i don't know that's not i guess

2301
05:43:57,849 --> 05:44:13,259
that's i mean they you could just like turn the pills into a gas and then release that so are we

2302
05:44:13,259 --> 05:44:19,700
about to just kind of turn our backs on this and just be like well we tried oh shit's fucked oh

2303
05:44:19,700 --> 05:44:33,639
come on i thought i was gonna have 82 accuracy you haven't bought high deaths a new high score

2304
05:44:33,639 --> 05:44:39,860
yeah and how many of those deaths were you killing me intentionally we we need to remember that

2305
05:44:39,860 --> 05:44:44,020
that's important each chapter i have been killed deliberately by him at least two or three times

2306
05:44:44,020 --> 05:44:55,159
four at least two or three a chapter no no yeah chapter a chapter at least two or three now you're

2307
05:44:55,159 --> 05:45:04,680
ready to put this thing to bed uh i got 30 000 points not enough for crit two yeah i all right

2308
05:45:04,680 --> 05:45:08,200
can i can look at can i just make it like a uh actual rant about resident evil

2309
05:45:09,159 --> 05:45:13,080
unpopular opinion you have the floor i'm gonna before you say anything though i'm gonna say i do

2310
05:45:13,080 --> 05:45:19,159
not like condone or um agree with anything that he's about to say so but you have the floor okay

2311
05:45:20,040 --> 05:45:25,319
all right here we go i actually hate how in every resident evil they lock the super fun weapons

2312
05:45:25,319 --> 05:45:31,240
behind multi playthroughs just give me all the cool shit let me play i got a 60 game i kind of

2313
05:45:31,319 --> 05:45:36,040
don't want to play through three times just to unlock the in-game dlc just let me have all the

2314
05:45:36,040 --> 05:45:40,360
fun stuff scattered throughout the campaign so i can enjoy it and i'm fine paying that money for

2315
05:45:40,360 --> 05:45:49,560
a good experience and then i want to put it to bed i don't think that's that unpopular i feel like

2316
05:45:49,560 --> 05:45:53,560
the people who are like i want my extra value so i have reason to play through again and get like

2317
05:45:53,560 --> 05:46:03,720
quote unquote 60 dollars worth well i want this damn it i thought it was gonna be cheaper what the

2318
05:46:04,360 --> 05:46:10,119
3000 to 28 000 for level two get out of here that's what i mean like some of these are clearly

2319
05:46:10,119 --> 05:46:14,709
not going to be earnable in one campaign i thought i was gonna be able to do level two

2320
05:46:14,709 --> 05:46:21,299
twice whatever this one's 70k for the next one yeah i can't really afford anything i'm just gonna

2321
05:46:21,299 --> 05:46:25,860
i'm just gonna go playing this game with a friend is worth it yeah that's the only reason why i

2322
05:46:25,860 --> 05:46:30,810
play this there's no reason to play this unless you're playing with somebody else co-op makes

2323
05:46:30,810 --> 05:46:41,049
everything more fun that's the only reason why borderland still exists all right you're good to

2324
05:46:41,049 --> 05:46:51,639
go yep let's let's seal the deal on this thing i was burying the lead uh i just have a timer uh

2325
05:46:51,639 --> 05:46:58,549
yeah i hit escape first so what's going on here okay i think we both clicked at the same time

2326
05:46:58,549 --> 05:47:08,279
borderland solo can be fun i feel like you're just looking to shoot stuff and pick up items

2327
05:47:08,279 --> 05:47:20,729
it can be fun just to have in the background depends oh borderlands can be fun solo that's

2328
05:47:20,729 --> 05:47:26,330
someone that uh bought it with their friends they all got together to play one time and then none

2329
05:47:26,330 --> 05:47:29,689
of their friends were ever available to play a second time so they just kept playing because

2330
05:47:29,689 --> 05:47:37,770
no one else would and they're trying to feel good about their purchase i didn't say that i just want

2331
05:47:37,770 --> 05:47:43,959

2360
05:52:23,270 --> 05:52:27,990
to be on camera yep you have to have lines you have to be able to see your face wearing helmets

2361
05:52:27,990 --> 05:52:36,700
are forbidden face coverings forbidden you gotta have full visual or your character can actually

2362
05:52:36,700 --> 05:52:48,229
die is your sensitivity insanely high right now uh it's pretty it's pretty high we can't risk

2363
05:52:48,229 --> 05:52:53,430
any more men in there and make sure you turn the air conditioner on to like recycle air

2364
05:52:55,029 --> 05:52:58,869
and put on some can you reach down the front put on some fucking spotify dude this is boring

2365
05:52:58,869 --> 05:53:05,529
like who drives around without music fucking weirdo i think you got the like silent uber

2366
05:53:07,319 --> 05:53:23,209
did you ask for like total silence i actually don't listen to music either i would listen to

2367
05:53:23,209 --> 05:53:27,930
music but i only have a cd player in my car i'm just gonna come out of the smoke all right

2368
05:53:28,729 --> 05:53:32,970
what was the last time you burned a cd

2369
05:53:36,540 --> 05:53:42,889
oh i don't remember i have no idea it's been a while i got defeat 500 zombies because this

2370
05:53:42,889 --> 05:54:02,779
dude ran one over that's funny okay so the fun fact we actually have to drive um across mainland

2371
05:54:02,779 --> 05:54:07,340
china this does all the way this does feel like a haunted hayride though we're just kind of slowly

2372
05:54:07,340 --> 05:54:12,919
driving by all the actors this is as far as i can get you why the smoke clear is right up ahead

2373
05:54:12,919 --> 05:54:18,599
you two keep going i'm gonna head back and try to find what's left of my team yeah we could have

2374
05:54:18,599 --> 05:54:25,340
gone faster if we just ran yeah but we can't breathe we could have held our breath and sprinted

2375
05:54:25,340 --> 05:54:30,779
and gotten there faster what if it's like skin reactive it's not it's when you breathe it in

2376
05:54:31,580 --> 05:54:54,790
all right going up good thing zombies can't climb sometimes they can that guy's dead why

2377
05:54:54,790 --> 05:55:01,939
didn't he just come with us yeah that's weird the gas is still going still having to run out of

2378
05:55:01,939 --> 05:55:10,729
vehicles you know on a kill it's the same you can't that there's other miles per hour you can go

2379
05:55:10,729 --> 05:55:15,209
that are not 100 or zero people need to tell the resident evil people just you don't have to push

2380
05:55:15,209 --> 05:55:20,490
down all the way on the gas it's not we're not playing like cruising usa commentary too

2381
05:55:21,369 --> 05:55:25,130
they're driving like they're in an arcade it goes from like you're going five miles an hour

2382
05:55:25,130 --> 05:55:31,270
in a humvee too watch out there's a gas tanker coming right at you and it's gonna explode

2383
05:55:34,569 --> 05:55:38,810
yeah the mill the guy that guy was going five miles per hour he's going like zero

2384
05:55:39,529 --> 05:55:51,590
you only go zero or a hundred in resident evil oh okay this is the prologue i played this part

2385
05:55:51,590 --> 05:56:02,279
what there's a callback the prologue of the game starts here and uh helena's wounded so how do we

2386
05:56:02,279 --> 05:56:08,459
do this leon it's maybe i'm not wounded yet but i'm gonna be wounded so watch out wait are we

2387
05:56:08,459 --> 05:56:14,619
about to like fight dr robotnik is that what this ending is no no no like i get wounded somehow and

2388
05:56:14,619 --> 05:56:26,889
you have to carry me and then uh returning enemy shows back up at the end this way leon leon do

2389
05:56:26,889 --> 05:56:40,119
you hear me are you all right am i talking to you uh maybe wait i we've changed we've changed

2390
05:56:40,119 --> 05:56:50,549
history at the beginning of the game leon carries helena through this part oh okay we've

2391
05:56:50,549 --> 05:57:02,819
found destinations all right we got something in here i've got that all right over here why did i

2392
05:57:02,819 --> 05:57:12,729
do that why did i just check pulse he dead that was really easy oh dinner plate but at the beginning

2393
05:57:12,729 --> 05:57:20,970
of the game you only have like three bullets you wouldn't understand i did the tutorial too

2394
05:57:34,139 --> 05:57:40,580
log doesn't have any continuity at all why do i need toggling aimed on sites um it's more

2395
05:57:40,580 --> 05:57:56,259
comfortable for me i just like it better action express magnum ammo why can i pick that up

2396
05:57:59,509 --> 05:58:05,779
i can't pick that up hold on my inventory is beautiful you have to like delete something

2397
05:58:05,779 --> 05:58:15,299
you end up picking up hundreds of pistol bullets over the course of the game okay got it do you

2398
05:58:15,299 --> 05:58:18,580
ever randomly get nervous about being like an extra on a movie set and they're doing some kind

2399
05:58:18,580 --> 05:58:22,900
of like you know being one of the zombies and the main characters are spraying bullets

2400
05:58:22,900 --> 05:58:26,900
and then all the zombies have to dive at the same time to pretend to be dead and you're the one that

2401
05:58:26,900 --> 05:58:33,830
like is off oh like jump to the ground first yeah like last before everybody else does well the thing

2402
05:58:33,830 --> 05:58:39,029
the director is sitting behind that's saying like okay down down down down down they cut the director

2403
05:58:39,029 --> 05:58:44,470
out he's got like his own they usually edit mount would you be one of the people that like dives to

2404
05:58:44,470 --> 05:58:48,630
the ground like falls backward or does like the shoulder shimmy where you do left shoulder right

2405
05:58:48,630 --> 05:58:54,500
shoulder left shoulder right like you got hit peppered like six times why can i oh well i would

2406
05:58:54,500 --> 05:58:58,869
have direction because the director would be talking but they were just like you know feeling

2407
05:58:58,869 --> 05:59:05,459
your vibe and they're just letting you pick the vibe all right guys just want you to feel the

2408
05:59:05,459 --> 05:59:09,509
vibe and just do whatever you want well then the movie would never get made they'd have to take

2409
05:59:09,509 --> 05:59:15,779
a hundred takes yeah but that's how it's gonna go when the zoomers finally start making movies

2410
05:59:15,779 --> 05:59:38,279
where are we now just do whatever your vibe is um i'm trying just to okay yep spoiler alert

2411
05:59:38,279 --> 05:59:47,400
there's a helicopter and this oh yeah i remember this why can i move

2412
05:59:49,959 --> 05:59:55,319
that's more realistic all right that's how it would probably actually happen okay was i supposed

2413
05:59:55,319 --> 05:59:59,400
to hold w or d because i was holding i don't know i was holding i'm sorry s right walk towards the

2414
05:59:59,400 --> 06:00:05,240
camera that's what i was doing but i don't know maybe it's w because it's a w it might be w i

2415
06:00:05,240 --> 06:00:12,549
don't know i get was i running looked like you were running i was holding s let me try it again

2416
06:00:13,720 --> 06:00:26,310
you're holding s like before after monka always after okay i'm holding s holding s

2417
06:00:29,750 --> 06:00:36,229
this is easier with a controller like i don't get it it's s yeah but you they he stops and

2418
06:00:36,229 --> 06:00:42,279
he just starts walking you have to hold space this is this is actually the sprint tutorial like

2419
06:00:42,279 --> 06:00:49,270
in the beginning of the game oh shit it's because my i'm still toggled on for my aim

2420
06:00:50,389 --> 06:00:54,389
you're still aiming down sights i'm character the character is still aiming because i have a script

2421
06:00:57,340 --> 06:01:09,099
right okay well it should be off now yeah we're good all right everybody reset take four this

2422
06:01:09,099 --> 06:01:14,459
stunt has cost us 18 million dollars oh way more than that this is like a 10 billion dollar stuff

2423
06:01:15,259 --> 06:01:39,860
you're just like flickering onto my screen that was like hey the zombie just standing there yeah

2424
06:01:39,860 --> 06:01:45,220
why was that guy shooting you're shooting at the cars i thought that was in the game for a second

2425
06:01:45,220 --> 06:01:55,610
i was like that was loud and it was weird all right you've trained how to fly a plane how about

2426
06:01:55,610 --> 06:02:14,950
a helicopter you got a chemistry final tomorrow well good luck i'm getting dizzy yeah i was gonna

2427
06:02:14,950 --> 06:02:25,930
like laugh out loud not do it but i want to get out of this it's making me sick all right i'm

2428
06:02:25,930 --> 06:02:30,250
gonna catch this guy and when i catch him i really he's a zombie and then oh no it's a zombie and

2429
06:02:30,250 --> 06:02:45,189
then i have to let him go oh that's right i'm good thank you i missed so don't worry i missed

2430
06:02:45,189 --> 06:03:10,500
again focus on flying i got it you're doing great all right you know okay are you like not you're

2431
06:03:10,500 --> 06:03:17,099
just not entertained at all right now right like me i i am but for the wrong reasons i say when

2432
06:03:17,099 --> 06:03:20,939
you do too much of this shit like i'm i'm not entertained anymore i'm just kind of like

2433
06:03:21,900 --> 06:03:27,590
i want you to breathe i want i want this game to remember this is like concurrent with uh the

2434
06:03:27,590 --> 06:03:35,979
uncharted games coming up so it was kind of like hot you know like the super detailed elaborate

2435
06:03:36,700 --> 06:03:50,500
action set pieces yeah that's that's fine but i want the game to breathe i wanted to fail that

2436
06:03:50,500 --> 06:03:57,189
but also i didn't know if it was going to do the whole chopper scene again or not yeah that would

2437
06:03:57,189 --> 06:04:07,990
have been painful that's very good call uh we got a lot of boxes here oh i think it's important this

2438
06:04:07,990 --> 06:04:16,229
is probably the final boxes of the game i don't have any space yeah neither do i um i don't want

2439
06:04:16,229 --> 06:04:37,720
this anymore did you do that yeah i want to combine these yeah you got 12 healings make sure your guns

2440
06:04:37,720 --> 06:04:44,700
are live whatever you know what i mean just make sure your guns work uh-huh there's a plate too

2441
06:04:44,700 --> 06:04:54,020
do you like upgrading guns sometimes would that make this would that be like a good feature in

2442
06:04:54,020 --> 06:05:09,930
this game oh yeah that that is missing that you upgrade your character in a weird way right okay

2443
06:05:09,930 --> 06:05:16,229
so we're about to find out who it is because he's like you're back all right if wesker comes walks

2444
06:05:16,229 --> 06:05:23,209
around that pillar i'll give you 50 bucks all right i i bet it's either wesker or the unkillable guy

2445
06:05:23,209 --> 06:05:38,299
we dropped the metal thing on there's a lot of explosives in that truck bed why do we care about

2446
06:05:38,299 --> 06:05:46,840
that guy like we've walked over a thousand corpses it's not wesker is it just the suited

2447
06:05:46,840 --> 06:05:57,590
war villain it is from the train yeah well it's uh oh eight is gonna throw us the rocket launcher

2448
06:05:57,590 --> 06:06:19,099
like she does in every game right looks like jake gillenhall and william defoe

2449
06:06:22,200 --> 06:06:33,159
that's cool i just said that's cool oh that's cool i was reading chat i'm sorry

2450
06:06:40,540 --> 06:06:46,790
okay here we go let's defeat derrick just explode this it's right next to him

2451
06:06:49,319 --> 06:06:59,349
big red tanker does not explode okay is this a dinosaur holy shit literally a t-rex this is

2452
06:06:59,349 --> 06:07:06,069
the coolest part of the whole game this is awesome wow with the helicopters

2453
06:07:08,389 --> 06:07:12,709
oh you're gonna shoot him in the eye he's got an eye in front of his mouth oh yeah i played horizon

2454
06:07:13,590 --> 06:07:27,340
oh now we get on we get down we start stepping on his head get him you're closer

2455
06:07:27,340 --> 06:07:38,779
melee him go melee him yeah yeah derrick all right unload that'll teach you to jump the turn

2456
06:07:38,860 --> 06:07:55,959
style at the subway station derrick oh i gotta get the fuck away from him i can't his boxes

2457
06:07:55,959 --> 06:08:14,419
are on the edges too i got an explosion another car is 100 miles an hour oh yeah pet the dog

2458
06:08:24,389 --> 06:08:36,900
all right get it it's a turret section i stopped working yes i think it overheated

2459
06:08:37,860 --> 06:08:54,979
okay this whole game sucked until this last 30 seconds did we not do it yeah we did it he's got

2460
06:08:54,979 --> 06:09:05,029
eyes in his chest too whoever's driving this thing deserves a deserves some applause they're

2461
06:09:05,029 --> 06:09:08,389
working with very limited space and they're honestly doing a pretty great job

2462
06:09:09,990 --> 06:09:15,189
can they stop doing cutscenes well that guy died he was in the driver's seat when it fell

2463
06:09:16,069 --> 06:09:22,389
oh we did we got like running at like 120 fps and like the game's like shit's happening too fast

2464
06:09:22,389 --> 06:09:32,709
or something all right he's going back into his uh into his form you want to get this one yeah i

2465
06:09:32,709 --> 06:10:04,599
got i got this one get it get him i'm trying get off you fucking dumbass can i get that use that

2466
06:10:04,599 --> 06:10:21,099
machine gun oh i think i just blew up a can by you i'm okay i'll get this one that's strike four

2467
06:10:21,099 --> 06:10:27,380
by the way i just want to make sure you're aware i haven't i haven't done anything yet see what you

2468
06:10:27,380 --> 06:10:30,099
don't know is once you get up he's going to transform then you're going to move out of the

2469
06:10:30,099 --> 06:10:36,180
way and then i'm going to blow it see all right now now move away what not yet wait wait wait he's

2470
06:10:36,180 --> 06:10:46,310
probably invulnerable now okay he screamed and i can't do it there we go i didn't like didn't

2471
06:10:46,310 --> 06:11:06,779
affect him at all i'm gonna come down there wait is there any magnum bullets come on we get the

2472
06:11:07,580 --> 06:11:14,470
and shoot the mini bird he's going down right in his face okay now we're gonna have to like

2473
06:11:14,470 --> 06:11:33,659
mag dump hey to relax all this will she won't she tension well this is we shoot it from the

2474
06:11:40,069 --> 06:11:57,610
we're not done what's wrong there's nothing let's go but that was not the last boss it just keeps

2475
06:11:57,610 --> 06:12:07,720
going you guys have to carve him you only have 60 seconds carve him but like a yeah like monster

2476
06:12:07,720 --> 06:12:12,360
hunter well the thing is that would have been actually really funny if we had done that boss

2477
06:12:12,360 --> 06:12:20,680
for 45 straight minutes she's more than just and we did it without cats yeah feelings for her and

2478
06:12:20,680 --> 06:12:30,250
then we uh retried it like five times it's only 45 minutes if you suck ass yeah i didn't say the

2479
06:12:30,330 --> 06:12:35,479
quality of our gameplay i just said hold on it's probably a qt

2480
06:12:48,659 --> 06:12:58,069
um i just took your place you have to climb first so we have to do this together

2481
06:12:58,069 --> 06:13:11,580
okay um i feel like i'm going too slow

2482
06:13:15,020 --> 06:13:24,169
i'm afraid i didn't want to overtake you uh-huh he's moving over there who else is up there ada

2483
06:13:24,169 --> 06:13:28,889
uh it's ada oh that's probably like the ada boss fight oh wait don't you kind of want to

2484
06:13:28,889 --> 06:13:34,700
see what happens i think they probably are both in god mode are they in god mode do you think

2485
06:13:41,959 --> 06:13:46,759
this is she's why she'd knock off spider-man in this game i don't know but i think she

2486
06:13:46,759 --> 06:14:04,659
wait she's probably gonna die um we have sniper rifle ammo oh now she gets to beat him up we

2487
06:14:04,659 --> 06:14:15,959
cannot reliably do anything from back here how i can't even we just did you have any sniper

2488
06:14:15,959 --> 06:14:22,900
rifle ammo yeah but i have nothing do we even have to shoot it what is it what's the objective

2489
06:14:22,900 --> 06:14:40,169
it just protect ada did it reach ada can you come fight over here ada just grapple literally

2490
06:14:40,169 --> 06:14:56,500
just grapple away okay she finally is doing the beat down uh she she has to do it three times too

2491
06:15:02,200 --> 06:15:11,159
oh the zombie that comes to our side is so we can they're like delivering ammo who designed

2492
06:15:11,159 --> 06:15:22,069
this segment but let's go like hurry up zero or 100 we have to climb again

2493
06:15:26,150 --> 06:15:32,680
i can't relax well i thought i i had whatever all right hang on hang on

2494
06:15:32,680 --> 06:15:40,279
just get two or three in front of me one two one two get in front of me why i there was no

2495
06:15:40,279 --> 06:15:46,630
prompt that was just you have to catch me i think i just have to get you okay go ahead one two one

2496
06:15:46,630 --> 06:15:58,060
two one two one all right i'm moving i think you have enough space am i too close oh shit

2497
06:15:59,240 --> 06:16:07,619
shoot him now uh i had this space in our hair be careful have you seen videos of like bears

2498
06:16:07,619 --> 06:16:12,900
climbing trees okay they can do they can do some crazy shit that's what this reminds me of

2499
06:16:29,430 --> 06:16:32,869
it's like they sampled clips of random orchestrated music from a hundred different

2500
06:16:32,869 --> 06:16:41,290
games and movies and just slapped them all together it's like it's like every marvel movie

2501
06:16:41,290 --> 06:16:48,810
every horror movie are you down there go punch him in the face all right i'm gonna i'm i can't move

2502
06:16:49,770 --> 06:16:58,900
i actually can't do anything hey where are you i'm like up here giving support i guess

2503
06:17:00,020 --> 06:17:07,860
ada you maybe waste every single magnum shot i don't you next you gotta be next to ada and then

2504
06:17:07,860 --> 06:17:15,610
do the revive movie revive i was making that up i don't know this is a waste of goddamn time

2505
06:17:15,610 --> 06:17:22,950
what the fuck am i doing is this what it feels like to be like a regular marine in a godzilla

2506
06:17:22,950 --> 06:17:31,139
movie all right i hopefully we can get you back here are you across no i'm like up in the tower

2507
06:17:31,139 --> 06:17:44,060
up here this is dangerous but i need that ammo he just changed he was not that he did not look

2508
06:17:44,060 --> 06:17:53,610
like that a second ago i'll tell you i'm just gonna use those should it be shoot him in the head

2509
06:17:53,610 --> 06:18:10,340
or where i'm shooting him in the ass he do got some big cheeks like big bulbous oh god damn it man

2510
06:18:19,240 --> 06:18:26,700
i haven't had a loaded gun in 30 to 40 straight seconds i'm doing my am i supposed to do something

2511
06:18:26,700 --> 06:18:31,099
up here i think we just have to do this wait oh there's a whole level up here why have the

2512
06:18:31,099 --> 06:18:36,299
zombies not even been attacking me defeat mutants dare all right good luck down

2513
06:18:37,500 --> 06:18:46,490
oh who the fuck is i thought there's just a random citizen up here

2514
06:18:47,369 --> 06:19:05,049
innocent oh it's my opportunity get up i'm showing body shots because i don't know where to shoot

2515
06:19:05,049 --> 06:19:12,099
them from down here dude having the dodge roll will you stay on the ground i'm not so sure if

2516
06:19:12,099 --> 06:19:22,389

2517
06:19:22,950 --> 06:19:29,909

2520
06:20:23,700 --> 06:20:25,700
you had to get into the cutscene spawn

2521
06:20:30,619 --> 06:20:42,790
he only fell from like 100 feet it was locked until you got to zero health is that really what

2522
06:20:42,790 --> 06:20:54,279
that was i was so far away from all that that i had no effect on that fight

2523
06:20:57,459 --> 06:21:01,380
the t-rex brought this a full letter grade up but the rest of this brought it three letter grades

2524
06:21:01,380 --> 06:21:30,740
down i wish i could stay longer shooter we're sticking together oh leon how sweet how much

2525
06:21:30,740 --> 06:21:38,139
more it was there to do i feel like we've killed the same boss three times like we keep killing

2526
06:21:38,139 --> 06:21:45,669
these two guys guy on all fours in the t-rex yeah she texted you so you would have her number

2527
06:21:45,669 --> 06:22:02,009
that's right yes we see the helicopter that means the end is in sight let's just pretend

2528
06:22:02,009 --> 06:22:10,220
to be a zombie just walking dead all right here we go this is the puppet master zombie

2529
06:22:10,220 --> 06:22:28,860
this is the lady what's her name that's the it's this guy again that's it's the guy yep

2530
06:22:38,520 --> 06:22:42,279

2531
06:22:42,919 --> 06:22:49,380
and leon's wait no uh we're gonna do the other playthroughs no i'm going to burn the copy of my

2532
06:22:49,380 --> 06:23:00,709

2533
06:23:00,709 --> 06:23:08,419
hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i got it i'm good nice what do we have to shoot here i think

2534
06:23:08,419 --> 06:23:25,590
it's just him i think he goes pretty good now he's gonna what this ex-zombie saved us this time

2535
06:23:26,389 --> 06:23:29,669
well there's the now he comes back again we have to be in the helicopter for him to spawn though

2536
06:23:36,389 --> 06:23:42,069
yeah we're gonna get in the helicopter he's gonna jump at us or like learn to fly even yep he's

2537
06:23:42,069 --> 06:23:47,740
gonna jump up he's gonna grab the helicopter with a tendril and then we are gonna have to shoot him

2538
06:23:47,740 --> 06:23:52,729
with the rocket launcher it's a good time to reload every gun yes that's what i am doing that

2539
06:23:52,729 --> 06:24:24,540
right now you guys should play the jake campaign i'd rather eat a ghost pepper oh more stuff that

2540
06:24:24,540 --> 06:24:29,099
was actually like five deagle rounds i feel like we should have had more opportunity to

2541
06:24:29,099 --> 06:24:43,909
upgrade our character or something not between chapters that's meh lame co-op moment eating a

2542
06:24:43,909 --> 06:24:52,599
ghost pepper not clickbait he turned into a fly did you see that hold on we got one more like

2543
06:24:52,599 --> 06:25:18,619
separated get me out of here i'm just like shooting at this guy climb down this is

2544
06:25:18,619 --> 06:25:29,930
what's up are you fighting the guy i'm just shooting this big fly in the face i think i'm

2545
06:25:29,930 --> 06:25:47,849
winning oh hold on did i do something you you moved it like i'm i'm far enough away from king

2546
06:25:47,849 --> 06:25:55,319
kong this is not scary i'm far enough away from him now like i'm not i'm not in any danger he's

2547
06:25:55,319 --> 06:26:01,319
one of the like haunted house uh workers like he can't touch he's always moving

2548
06:26:01,319 --> 06:26:13,529
what is happening oh i he's gotten angry oh i have to move this again i'm out of ammo and a lot of

2549
06:26:13,529 --> 06:26:29,459
weapons i have no bullets all right just hang in there i'll be with you do i have any bullets in

2550
06:26:29,459 --> 06:26:37,400
any gun no i have nothing i don't i can i have nothing i have no i don't know what i'm doing

2551
06:26:37,400 --> 06:26:54,950
i'm playing like a game show over here i don't think it matters he can't hurt me are you dead

2552
06:26:55,669 --> 06:27:05,130
uh i guess so i feel like okay something was wrong there something was wrong there i

2553
06:27:05,689 --> 06:27:13,049
used every weapon i think can you move me faster probably me but i could i could be a little faster

2554
06:27:13,049 --> 06:27:16,889
this time yeah i didn't know exactly what it's supposed to do first because you were just like

2555
06:27:16,889 --> 06:27:22,569
the giant flies over there except reunite with your partner he's very vague i used every bullet i had

2556
06:27:23,369 --> 06:27:33,939
i'm not even gonna shoot at him what a waste i could definitely jump to you

2557
06:27:36,229 --> 06:27:48,119
just kind of like a pog he's like okay so i'm not gonna do anything all right there's like four

2558
06:27:48,119 --> 06:27:56,580
zombies i gotta kill the zombies move them over somewhere all right you're moving i'm moving you

2559
06:27:58,419 --> 06:28:09,979

2560
06:28:10,779 --> 06:28:21,369
all right here he comes he's coming over to the uh lift thing there he is all right now i can do

2561
06:28:21,369 --> 06:28:40,680
it again working on it oh shit hold on you have to be out of the way i got at least 10 seconds okay

2562
06:28:40,680 --> 06:28:54,200
got it okay are you moving me yeah am i moving i gotta it has to reset there's like a timer

2563
06:28:56,619 --> 06:29:08,360
okay i i'm out of bullets again looks like he's can i leave already yet i don't know what

2564
06:29:09,240 --> 06:29:28,790
oh shit okay all right you're all clear oh there's a lot of shit up here yeah okay so i've

2565
06:29:28,790 --> 06:29:34,650
been pushing buttons on this little device okay so now we where do we go to go through this

2566
06:29:43,029 --> 06:29:55,849
okay flies are so fucking ugly i hope they all die who somebody said that they think flies are

2567
06:29:55,849 --> 06:30:03,590
ugly and they should all die i'd be okay with that don't flies actually do something very

2568
06:30:03,590 --> 06:30:08,549
important like decomposition and stuff i'm sure the whole ecosystem does but like that assumes

2569
06:30:08,549 --> 06:30:15,189
that i'm willing to spare the ecosystem you've gotten to a bigger fly and i would rather delete

2570
06:30:15,189 --> 06:30:21,349
all like ants flies and wasps we're not going anywhere in that chopper all right so

2571
06:30:21,349 --> 06:30:32,360
so time to fight where should we shoot him with the legs

2572
06:30:34,040 --> 06:30:42,979
dude his arms yeah i don't know his legs his belly he's protecting his eyes so we have to make him

2573
06:30:42,979 --> 06:30:57,299
unheated and then shoot him in the eyes when possible all right what else is left to shoot

2574
06:30:58,020 --> 06:31:01,830
he just peekabooed i shot it

2575
06:31:01,830 --> 06:31:03,110
he just peeked yeah

2576
06:31:04,950 --> 06:31:17,369
what okay he zeus he's got zeus thank you you were right the lightning rod

2577
06:31:24,540 --> 06:31:33,580
in the head sniper bullets in there all right i'm gonna take out the ads yeah we need we need ammo

2578
06:31:42,810 --> 06:31:49,700
well he absorbs one zombie and oh my god there's some ammo back here yeah this crates

2579
06:31:50,580 --> 06:32:02,330
this is not the time for points i want bullets oh shit wait we can touch this

2580
06:32:02,970 --> 06:32:09,799
what okay i just stabbed this guy oh he has to eat it we're trying to make him eat the lightning

2581
06:32:09,799 --> 06:32:17,369
bolt so he gets electrocuted um so this guy's stabbed how do we move this guy now can i move

2582
06:32:17,369 --> 06:32:22,650
him can i kick him we just have to keep doing damage to his like body do the do the yellow

2583
06:32:22,650 --> 06:32:31,220
orbs and then shoot him in the face when he falls down we're shooting his legs off or something

2584
06:32:31,220 --> 06:32:45,659
need ammo okay here he goes this guy's been lightning defied now what shoot him in the eyes

2585
06:32:48,580 --> 06:33:08,020
all right then what about it send it how he's gonna grab it how zeus activate the power

2586
06:33:27,529 --> 06:33:33,770
my god it's still going like that callback actually is potentially what took down the

2587
06:33:33,770 --> 06:33:44,279
final boss it just won't it won't stop okay there's so much content in this game think

2588
06:33:44,279 --> 06:33:51,509
about how many like 20 minute youtube videos i could have made no all right here we are

2589
06:33:52,229 --> 06:34:03,220
we made it oh oh there it is oh there it is the bazooka the rpg

2590
06:34:07,610 --> 06:34:13,159
this better be a good explosion we both take the shot or do i fly into you shoot i wonder

2591
06:34:13,880 --> 06:34:33,799
you got up we both got i just i shot him that fall over there's a guy in a costume

2592
06:34:35,099 --> 06:34:46,139
one rpg that was not what i thought all right i thought we were gonna like fly the chopper and

2593
06:34:46,860 --> 06:35:00,919
yeah yeah i love this scene in simon so i'm ality that's not zombie movie the other one

2594
06:35:00,919 --> 06:35:06,619
hot fuzz it's probably not over like you said he's gonna grab the helicopter we're gonna have

2595
06:35:06,619 --> 06:35:19,689
to do something else yes but that one was made of dragon glass okay that's gonna make the umbrella

2596
06:35:19,689 --> 06:35:29,720
simple isn't it lightning couldn't kill him but an rpg could that exactly what they wanted to have

2597
06:35:29,720 --> 06:35:39,319
happen the plan is all in place only with the blood of the ancient one i guess not ancient he

2598
06:35:39,319 --> 06:35:54,250
was like born in like 1975 or something he said let's get to the chopper all right you still have

2599
06:35:54,250 --> 06:36:02,340
a shot let's get out of here it's because i didn't i didn't even get to shoot the final boss with

2600
06:36:02,340 --> 06:36:12,970
the rpg i had to do i had to do something it's gonna put us all the way back isn't it i think

2601
06:36:12,970 --> 06:36:25,990
you just fucked us i think you just fucked us over we have to watch that again all right at the same

2602
06:36:25,990 --> 06:36:35,209
time now at the same time now i think we can skip cutscenes oh shit can you escape i can't i'm in

2603
06:36:35,770 --> 06:36:40,729
oh my god dude we were out of it we were done just time it at the same time three two one shoot it

2604
06:36:43,290 --> 06:36:51,500
okay no no we both do it at the same time pick it up are you ready get in the spot one two three

2605
06:36:52,299 --> 06:37:02,950
okay good now escape we can skip this all right we're good let's go don't you i know you shot

2606
06:37:02,950 --> 06:37:14,619
yours so yep i shot mine this time it actually remembers that may have been my only chance to

2607
06:37:14,619 --> 06:37:30,169
shoot the rpg in the whole game it probably was oh i thought this was a smoke detector the data

2608
06:37:31,540 --> 06:37:40,540
you have to get the data intel the reports we're gonna break this case wide open we already know

2609
06:37:40,540 --> 06:37:44,779
what happened now we can make it public we already know what happened we have to clear leon's name

2610
06:37:44,779 --> 06:37:49,259
because everyone thinks that you killed the president exactly oh shit that's right you're

2611
06:37:49,259 --> 06:38:02,790
right you got it oh that's it all right i have a new i have a new game for us to play

2616
06:38:31,159 --> 06:38:42,569
if he comes back all right well the shit all this shit talking it actually was it wasn't that bad

2617
06:38:42,569 --> 06:38:51,159
it was bad but it wasn't it was awful but it wasn't like awful enough to not play let's be

2618
06:38:51,159 --> 06:38:55,720
honest it was not good but it was not if you have a friend you can just laugh through it like we

2619
06:38:55,720 --> 06:39:24,540
just did all right stay for the after credit scene player has left the game uninstalled i win got it

2620
06:39:24,540 --> 06:39:30,279

2621
06:39:30,279 --> 06:39:38,250
i can't even hit escape on this menu i i just literally all tabbed and just force quit it wow

2622
06:39:38,250 --> 06:39:46,459
okay the game's now uninstalled wow all right nice okay how much of that is related to me like

2623
06:39:46,459 --> 06:39:52,250
the throwing a bomb on you and how much of it is just the game well i did we had a i just figured

2624
06:39:52,250 --> 06:40:01,669
that it would be like a funny thing to who can uninstall it faster okay now delete the banana

2625
06:40:01,669 --> 06:40:06,950
gif i didn't make i didn't do upload it i've watched it and laughed at it i still have a

2626
06:40:06,950 --> 06:40:20,919
google image for chris redfield with a banana open i don't want to see it all right that's it

2627
06:40:20,919 --> 06:40:28,840
that was fun that was resident evil 6 and it was a fun game and we played it was fun yeah show

2628
06:40:28,840 --> 06:40:36,169
and we're going to play the next three chapters on a stream near you everyone just didn't want

2629
06:40:36,169 --> 06:40:41,130
to see his final score probably true oh wait did you see it did you get that actually no i i quit

2630
06:40:41,130 --> 06:40:51,130
too i didn't want to be left behind uh how long we've been how long has the stream been

2631
06:40:51,130 --> 06:40:57,209
uh six hours and 40 minutes probably like an hour of that was just the one outside the house

2632
06:40:57,209 --> 06:41:03,610
segment i forgot that we started at 330 in my brain this started at two but no we started

2633
06:41:03,610 --> 06:41:10,819
at 330 pretty cool well i hope you guys enjoyed that hope it was fun i actually had a great time

2634
06:41:10,819 --> 06:41:16,409
like regardless of the game was bad it was fun to do that is that supposed to be the best campaign

2635
06:41:16,889 --> 06:41:21,689
is that the best one in the game that's the main campaign from what i understand because look you

2636
06:41:21,689 --> 06:41:26,939
saw like ada i you're gonna oh ada's across the bridge she's fighting the monster you do

2637
06:41:26,939 --> 06:41:34,520
i think you just do their version yeah because you yeah you see them that's them in a boss fight

2638
06:41:34,520 --> 06:41:39,159
like later when you play that campaign and i'm sure you'll turn around as ada you'll look over

2639
06:41:39,159 --> 06:41:43,560
your shoulder you'll turn you'll see oh there they are there's the other two players there's leon and

2640
06:41:43,560 --> 06:41:54,340
yeah there was a good story moment wait you said the game was bad and you lost 500 viewers what

2641
06:41:54,340 --> 06:42:01,990
are you talking no i did not say that oh you're talking about right now no um people are leaving

2642
06:42:01,990 --> 06:42:07,909
because the stream is ending yeah yeah there's not gonna be another six and a half hour campaign

2643
06:42:07,909 --> 06:42:17,319
right now it's over i thought okay i thought you see you mean all right well that's uh i think

2644
06:42:17,319 --> 06:42:23,979
that's gonna be it thanks italics for playing it's always a pleasure it was very fun we'll uh

2649
06:43:02,299 --> 06:43:09,590
the monster rancher they're not remakes and they're not remasters so i'm not going to call them that

2650
06:43:09,590 --> 06:43:17,610
they're reports they're ports i'm gonna play at least monster rancher 2 i'm trying to think

2651
06:43:17,610 --> 06:43:21,509
if i should do them both but i don't think so i think we're just gonna do two because two is the

2652
06:43:21,509 --> 06:43:35,740
best one so we'll play monster rancher 2 get back into it and then on thursday is the game awards

2653
06:43:35,740 --> 06:43:39,259
so i'm gonna stream the game awards and depending how long the game awards is we'll probably just

2654
06:43:39,259 --> 06:43:51,880
go back to monster rancher 2 again and then from there that will be thursday after that i really

2655
06:43:51,880 --> 06:43:58,299

2657
06:44:05,659 --> 06:44:17,990

2658
06:44:18,549 --> 06:44:22,389
lower energy i'm not we'll see i say that but it always ends up being the opposite
