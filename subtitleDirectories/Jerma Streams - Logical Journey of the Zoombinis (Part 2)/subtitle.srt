1
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:51,429
Okay, see? I'm early. I'm early. I mean, I said I was going to be much earlier than this, but,

2
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:57,159
you know, take what we can get. Four minutes is fine. By the way, I looked over here,

3
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,780
and right when I pressed the go live button, I saw somebody say,

4
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,590
oh, like he farted or fart fart or something. And I was like, oh, what? Because I did.

5
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:12,409
Right before I pressed the button. I was like, how is it possible they could know that? But I forgot

6
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:19,700
that's like one of your guys' favorite words. So like, oh, of course, that somebody probably

7
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:27,620
writes the word farts in this chat, like once every, I mean, it's probably every like two or

8
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:39,849
300 words. So yeah, didn't catch me. Okay, hi. How's it going? Welcome to the stream.

9
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:52,090
Somebody said, great. Yeah, like, okay, great. Today, we're gonna look at him. Hmm. What are

10
00:01:52,090 --> 00:02:04,840
we doing today? We're playing the logical journey of the Zoombinis. I played this game 30 years ago.

11
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:13,060
I also played this game about six or seven years ago. It's been a long time. It has been at least

12
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:24,840
five full years. Don't you feel old? 30 years ago? I mean, when did this come out? Okay.

13
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:47,659
Logical journey of the Zoombinis. This came out in 1996. That's 27 years ago. Yeah, 30 years ago.

14
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:03,159
People were question marking when I said 30 years. Hmm. Damn, you're old. Yeah, but we're

15
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,719
gonna play it. We're gonna get to my favorite part. If you don't know my favorite part,

16
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:16,419
it's the narrator. And it's when, you know, for all the new viewers, we'll let you experience it on

17
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:25,699
your own here. It's a puzzle game for kids. I seem to be on a trend here playing puzzle games for

18
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:37,300
children. I feel like I did that a lot. But yeah, let's go. It's a shame you don't have any brain

19
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:59,939
fluid. Wait, was this the brain fluid stream? It was. Okay. Yeah, it was. Here comes an embarrassment.

20
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,400
Well, the thing about the logical journey of the Zoombinis is you can change the difficulty to be

21
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:16,899
as easy or as hard as you want. You can make this game impossible. Okay, you know when you're in a

22
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,779
character creator, and you can just go to the hands, and you can make the hands just scaled

23
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:30,069
500 times. It's like, holy shit, that's kind of ridiculous. The Zoombinis you can you can scale

24
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:47,610
the difficulty up almost impossible. You'll see. So is this like Street Fighter? Dude, you're playing

25
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:57,370
a 30 year old game and not Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom. Hey, I'm the fart simulator

26
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:05,220
guy. I'm the fart simulator guy. I'm not the Zelda guy. Do you know what I'm saying? You got to do

27
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:21,879
what you know. All right, is Zoombinis some of the most important media? I'm kidding. All right,

28
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:33,939
let's go. Actually, yeah, it kind of is educational, fun, engaging. I think it was pretty formative.

29
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:49,829
All right, so we're going to watch the intro because I want you to see it. Here we go. All right. All

30
00:05:49,910 --> 00:06:05,500
right. The intro is not clickable, so never mind. We're going to skip that part. Zoombini Island.

31
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:14,970
I can't watch the intro. Why? Don't skip. You hear me clicking up. I am clicking as fast as I can.

32
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:34,279
Will you play Left 4 Dead 2? Not right now. Watch the intro. I'm trying. I can't. All right, the

33
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:39,639
intro is just the Zoombinis need to find a new place to live, and they've picked an area that

34
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:46,980
they just need to traverse dangerous world to get to. We have to make our character. So the whole

35
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,459
point of Zoombinis is you have to make a bunch of Zoombinis, try to get them all. That's right,

36
00:06:51,459 --> 00:07:04,759
I said all, not one, not two. All of them to survive to the end. So let's start. Okay, I'm

37
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:14,389
making this. I'm making that. And you could just make it all random too, which is probably what I...

38
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:23,540
Oh, they have names. Oh, I just randomized the entire group. All right, we've got a lot of

39
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,500
pink noses. And this matters, by the way. This is incredibly important.

40
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:35,939
He did it again when I did this last. I did this six years ago. I just programmed to do something

41
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:43,860
wrong. I did it the same. I did that already. Why am I programmed to do this wrong? All right,

42
00:07:43,860 --> 00:08:02,100
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can I go back? All right, how about we'll do half? Okay, we'll do half

43
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,019
randomly generated because it's fun to be because randomly generated. It needs to be this way.

44
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:27,930
I'll make three people. Why was more springs? We don't have any springs. What is going on here?

45
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,919
Uh, let's get a... How many... What do we have? A lot of green noses. Not a whole lot of blue noses.

46
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:50,230
Where's Gunu? That's a different universe. All right, I like that. We got a lot of pink shoes.

47
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:57,320
I don't know if I want more pink shoes. What do you guys think? I think we need more wheels.

48
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:08,500
No, what do we miss? What if we don't have a lot of blue shoes? Need more springs. Oh yeah,

49
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:16,490
we do need more springs. Spring, red nose, sunglasses. We have a lot of sunglasses. We don't

50
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:31,179
have very many of these eyes. Okay, only a few more. All right, another... Should we do a cyclops?

51
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:52,299
Okay, a lot of this ponytail here, these little guys edible. How does the game work? You will

52
00:09:52,299 --> 00:10:01,830
see very shortly. Need another one of these. Yeah, let's do, uh, that green nose. Oh, that's it. All

53
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:32,649
right, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. It's all right. It's just it's old. It's an old

54
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:39,779
90s game where the cut scenes were dialed up times a thousand in audio. All right,

55
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:47,830
are we ready? I'm excited to play the logical journey of the Zumbinis. So we have two bridges

56
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:56,120
here. Probably asking, okay, the logical journey of the Zumbinis. We just across the bridge, right?

57
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,460
Let's go. Let's go ahead and do it. Let's go ahead and do it. Let's send somebody across the bridge.

58
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:16,970
Made it over safely. Safely. Okay, so let's deduce why that happened. Well, should I let you figure

59
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:26,970
it out? Let's find out. Okay, ready? Let's have somebody else go across. Okay, so there was a

60
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:39,019
problem there. I could not bring this guy over and the reason for that... This is not my face.

61
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:45,379
Why are you everyone saying Jerma? Jerma? All right, so this one made it across. What do you

62
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:48,580
think is wrong with this one? You think it's the different nose color because that's what you have

63
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,980
to figure out. Let's figure this out. All right, is it yellow noses are allowed to cross? Uh oh.

64
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:04,500
And by the way, they can die. Just so you understand, they can die. You get it? Do you

65
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:15,960
see what we're dealing with right now? Okay, is it... It's not the nose. So is it the hair?

66
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,720
Or is it the wheels? All right, do we have any other wheels? All right, wheels and a completely

67
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:27,100
different hairstyle. But the eyes are... All right, everything is completely different but the wheels.

68
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:38,840
If you have wheels, please go on the bottom bridge because that is what it is. Okay, so

69
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:51,320
what about springs? All right, people are gonna start dying. Uh, so springs... Can springs go up

70
00:12:51,320 --> 00:13:00,860
here? Yeah, they have to be able to go through. Right, okay. All right, so they get a little

71
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:11,700
excited. Who couldn't make it? Okay, what about you? Yeah, you're fine. You're fine up there.

72
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:18,100
All right, you're fine up here. I think it's only based on the shoes but I don't know about those.

73
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,629
Let's just get everybody out. I think I'm just on the regular difficulty as well. You... I think

74
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:38,629
this can be much harder as well. As well, as well, as well, as well. All right. Settle down. All

75
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:49,029
right, it's time to... Like, what? It's all right. We got... All right, we got everybody.

76
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:53,210
Everybody has safely made it across and now they're all gonna go...

77
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:06,809
Watch. You've done quite well. Well, I did that sound so that's fine. Where's the Diablo 4 end

78
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:15,720
game stream? You don't want to hear my D4 thoughts. You don't want to hear how I feel about D4.

79
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,120
I don't think you... I don't think you want to hear how I feel about that game.

80
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:36,200
I don't think you want to hear it. These stone guards have their rules so do proceed with skill.

81
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,720
All right, this one is like the bridge but there's more... there's more places for error.

82
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:55,850
What did we do to deserve this? More of those little pebbles. Okay, so just like the bridge,

83
00:14:56,809 --> 00:15:02,899
this one is also about letting people pass depending on like the shoes they have and the

84
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:11,779
hair they have. But as you see, there's multiple points of failure because if this rock is fine

85
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:22,220
and doesn't care, this one might care. So we have to deduce. Hey, it's logic, right? You're always

86
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:29,179
gonna start somewhere. We're going pink shoes. We're going straight in this way. All right,

87
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:39,899
not happy about that. So some people are probably gonna die here. I just want you to understand.

88
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:47,129
Okay, so something about this I'm gonna say. Let's go left side. You're cool with this. You are not

89
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:59,559
cool with that. Okay, so what is it? What is this? You've got red nose, pink shoes, glasses. All

90
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:07,100
right, maybe it's glasses. Is it the glasses that you don't like? Let's see. Okay, who's got glasses?

91
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:18,519
Excuse me. Okay, so it's the feet. Yeah, it's the feet. All right, so propellers cannot go this way.

92
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:28,580
So propellers have to go this way. Can the propellers go here? Is it based only on propeller

93
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:45,960
for you too? Are you good? Okay, that's weird. All right, do we have pink shoes? Okay, this is based

94
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:57,220
on shoes. These. Okay, all right. So what about spring? You don't want spring. Do you care? You

95
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:08,859
both don't care. Nobody is going up here. Enjoy yourself. Speedrun the game? All right, what about

96
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:28,170
this way? Wheels? All right. Wrong way. Okay, with it this way. Oh, shit. Wait, what? Sorry. What is it?

97
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:42,420
Oh, so what is the problem? Have a good time. Have a good time. This process is pleasant.

98
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:52,299
Why are they doing this? Are you enjoying Final Fantasy 16 exclusively for the PS5 as a timed

99
00:17:52,299 --> 00:18:01,509
exclusive? Yeah, I actually think it was fucking phenomenal. Okay, all right. What about blue shoes

100
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:07,980
this way? Welcome. I think we got it. So what was the problem? What does she just want? Anything?

101
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:22,970
Enjoy yourself. This is just practice. We're gonna do this again on hard and you'll see how

102
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:30,490
impossible the game is. Here's the best part of the whole game.

103
00:18:54,019 --> 00:19:00,539
I used to sit here when I was younger and the reason why I thought this was my favorite part

104
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:09,740
of the game is because when you're younger, just making food. Oh, look, I made a, I made a jalapeno

105
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:17,700
and pepperoni pizza. I say, oh, okay. You get to like make stuff. All right, we got to go simple

106
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:27,579
though. Okay, well, let's see. All right, you have to, so we're going to play this again with the

107
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:31,420
other characters. Don't worry. I'm just, we're doing the tutorial. The tutorial is can we get

108
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:38,660
all 20 zoom beanies to the end on normal five-year-old difficulty. All right, so he doesn't

109
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,779
like it. He's something something on this. He doesn't like, so let's just try this. A regular

110
00:19:41,779 --> 00:20:01,480
cheese pizza. Okay, you like the cheese, but he wants toppings. Okay, so what? Okay, something

111
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:16,180
maybe was it the, I don't know. Maybe just pineapple. All right, we got it. Pineapple and cheese

112
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:33,450
pizza. I would have said gross. I have absolutely fucking said that before. You got them all.

113
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:41,299
Play the harder difficulty. Yeah, I just, we're just doing the tutorial. I think we have to go

114
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:47,829
through it once. Eventually there are three different tree characters here and they're

115
00:20:47,829 --> 00:21:06,039
very specific, but let's keep going. How many hours do you have in this game? I don't know.

116
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:18,890
Like four.

117
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,279
What the duck.

118
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:42,410
Right, so this game is kind of, let's turn the difficulty up. Why not? Let's go for it. Oh,

119
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:49,509
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not yet. If you don't have enough

120
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:56,740
zumbinis you have to have 16 if you don't have 16 you have to play the game

121
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:03,650
again but you have to get enough in the first three levels to be able to

122
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:14,250
continue on and we can go up or down too you have 16 yeah I know I'm just

123
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,250
showing you how it works you know when you do your full playthrough you'll

124
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:33,269
you'll see all right up or down I forget I forget what direction is easier go

125
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:46,599
down down is better I don't remember bro no one's gonna play this other than you

126
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:51,859
this is tutorial mode well it's just easy mode we'll go through it another

127
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:56,180
two or three times because if well I mean I've played this game a lot this is

128
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,660
like one of my favorite games I haven't played the game in six or seven years

129
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,420
and then before that it's been like 15 or 20 or something but you know you get

130
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:09,480
the idea you have to get a ton of zumbinis to the end to beat the game

131
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:19,599
this is one of my favorite games you got a problem I'm just going down you got a problem like do you

132
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,359
have a problem with me is that like I'm asking do you have a problem with me

133
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,359
sitting in the chair like I'm playing this you got a problem there's no sense

134
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:40,619
leaving it up to chance no the flings off the tree branch oh the flings that's

135
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:52,329
right all right you wonder why I like this game so much because all the

136
00:23:52,329 --> 00:24:04,430
zumbinis just go like yeah of course I'd like the game all right so each

137
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:12,589
fling is matched to each individual zumbini so we have to figure out what

138
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:27,059
is matched with what so we're just gonna sacrifice somebody all right so blue

139
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:33,970
shoes is the treads these eyes are the mask the little hair

140
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:40,660
follicle is the helmet so we need to knock them off of this branch so we need

141
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:51,019
to find a hair follicle with those eyes okay hair follicle with okay and then

142
00:24:51,019 --> 00:25:05,230
the tank it's gonna be old and unhealthy yeah

143
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:13,140
zumbinis are I love this game I used to play this when I was younger I'm just

144
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:20,420
trying to desperately key hold on to my youth okay so we don't what's the what's

145
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:33,660
the mohawk we know that the spinny is the tank green nose is blue okay so

146
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:52,190
somebody that has these eyes and a spinny yeah okay ponytails mohawk so we

147
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:57,230
have a few more options oh no we don't no it's like just two okay that's this

148
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:19,609
one it's gonna match that rock out break big brain moment I actually don't know

149
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:32,819
how much harder they make that at the higher difficulty

150
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:51,450
this sounds like a garbage disposal garbage like wait in that rock song yes

151
00:26:51,450 --> 00:27:02,859
ah yes I'll be right down make yourself cozy oh that's right we have to you're

152
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:11,099
just in time for tomorrow's concerto help yourselves to a room if I remember

153
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:16,380
rehearsal go ahead find yourselves a room as the game gets harder I think they

154
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,849
the room stack up this tall and this wide so it gets very hard and I think

155
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,450
there's a timer all right so we have to see who can like be in this in like a

156
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:33,450
same hotel room okay is it about is can you go in okay is it it's probably just

157
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:45,519
shoes we're on the easiest difficulty it's definitely just shoes it's not okay

158
00:27:45,519 --> 00:28:01,589
is it oh is it I don't know noses this is too blue this is blue and red eyes

159
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:08,390
it's its eyes that's the eyes all right so we need any more okay okay it's the

160
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:26,460
eyes you guys are so smart no help we have to get one batch of zoom beanies

161
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:35,940
across to the end because when it gets harder it's easy to lose people all right

162
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:54,460
yeah this plays out hey that's cool a place for everyone and everyone in a

163
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:14,970
place please protect the red glasses with you all life I'll try

164
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:24,349
mud ball wall I love this one I used to just bail this one deliberately because

165
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:40,240
it was fun just to use the toy okay so where so this is green ball with square

166
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:50,190
fire it I just went a hundred million miles per hour I got it right all right

167
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:55,309
so that was very fast I think the game is running at 60 FPS so the the game

168
00:29:55,309 --> 00:30:04,490
runs at 6,000 percent speed so this is how many we're allowed to bring up so

169
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,369
that was a green square what is red square is red square gonna be over here

170
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:21,109
not okay so color is the column and shape is the row all right so we're

171
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:38,650
looking for I think let's just go blue and got it all right so no more just

172
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:44,940
scared me or second I thought they were doing a frog noise I was like no we're

173
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:51,259
in a swamp Chad is so stupid to find this confused confusing wait do I know

174
00:30:51,259 --> 00:31:01,240
something the chat doesn't know this doesn't make sense wait am I better at

175
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:07,859
chat at a logical journey of the zoom beanies puzzle game you don't get it

176
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:18,420

181
00:31:53,349 --> 00:32:08,339

experience how can you keep mentioning the harder difficulty I don't know I

184
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:51,319
still don't get it so color is going to always be part of the rose that's my

185

228
00:42:43,130 --> 00:43:08,679
right has to be has to be spring no I think it's this one why am I doing the

229
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:31,119
Bioshock infinite thing and it was a price I paid price I paid all right how

230
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:50,420
you doing today I'm doing good you're doing good too you good we're about to

231
00:43:50,420 --> 00:44:18,039
be there we made it to some beanieville no this more this is the one that gets in

232
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:24,269
my head because you have to put this two entry points and depending on what they

233
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:27,630
have for features they move in a different direction so I have to be

234
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:33,699
careful so if somebody goes here and they have these eyes they're gonna stop

235
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:40,179
here and move this way then up up right so anybody that has these eyes is safe

236
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:50,300
but wait I don't want to do that yeah I do what if you don't okay if you do not

237
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:58,539
have these eyes you're dead if you go this way so let's get this right because

238
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:07,090
I don't want to lose anybody else so let's say you are a spring and I put

239
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:12,539
you this way you're gonna go straight through that you're gonna go up right

240
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:25,780
down left up right right okay it's gonna turn this thing that way I mean no I

241
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:32,349
mean she's dead no she's not oh fuck she has the hair oh that's right it's

242
00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:45,989
all right everybody wave bye when she passes by am I gonna make it oh I don't

243
00:45:45,989 --> 00:45:58,380
know if that means but hopefully it's yes yeah okay well hold on I always had

244
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:04,099
trouble with this one even on like the kids difficulty okay so up you don't

245
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:11,539
have those eyes you'll go right if you have the mohawk you're gonna go down up

246
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:17,090
down left die shit let's just get everybody over there that we know we

247
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:45,059
can get over there okay so if you have hair you need to go now because no yep

248
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:50,820
so all the eyes are gone so if you have this you're gonna go up you're gonna go

249
00:46:50,820 --> 00:47:07,860
through this right okay here we go I mean no I mean wrong bad what you made

250
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:16,360
it we talked about that I made it it's correct okay so now if I do a mohawk

251
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:24,530
it's gonna go up up right down left up right so we can't have a mohawk go that

252
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:39,780
way chat is waffling do more funny murders ha ha ha this is only gonna get

253
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:45,369
way harder so trust me if you're sitting here waiting to make fun of me hey Jerma

254
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:48,650
I was watching your stream yesterday and I didn't have a chance to make fun of

255
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:52,449
how stupid you were I'm kind of bored not being able to make fun of you not

256
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:55,610
being able to do this children's puzzle game so I just I think I'm gonna take a

257
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:59,630
break of watching your stream for a few weeks just wait just wait till we play

258
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,989
on the medium and hard difficulties because you're probably gonna be gonna

259
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:11,079
get your your fill of that okay so now I think I can just alternate because if I

260
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:39,780
do the hair now all right is this right no yes it is okay is somebody dead here

261
00:48:40,260 --> 00:49:02,300
okay you go up right okay yeah we're good only one person done we got what

262
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:34,980
14 out of 16 we're good hey what happened to the red glasses well we

263
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:58,550
tried to hold us together that you just reminded me we did it

264
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:23,340
all right how many did we get 14 yes this windmill was brought to honor the

265
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:29,780
Zumbinis who flushed the finicky flings in hotel dementia had pleasant dreams

266
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:34,300
and catapulted cleanly over a mud ball wall and the traveling was not so easy

267
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:42,719
okay look at all of our friends that made it as you bring Zumbinis to Zumbini

268
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:51,329
more structures are created more stuff is available as you see we got the

269
00:50:51,329 --> 00:51:05,170
windmill and now let's go back very cool okay not so easy very hard very very

270
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:24,170
hard what is it okay there are 384 Zumbinis so how do we change these I

271
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:35,570
forget I'm not press it because for journey of practice we're not taking

272
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:47,710
anybody how do I make it harder it scales with you how many you save oh

273
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:54,539
okay all right so we're gonna go up this time we went down and took us this way

274
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:57,219
up is gonna take us around this way so let's just do it again

275
00:51:57,219 --> 00:52:00,980
journey just gets harder okay yeah let's go let's go let's get all 384

276
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:34,099
glasses glasses glasses glasses that's too many glasses way too many fuck it

277
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:45,920
all right now we speedrun now we understand how it works we go fast

278
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:55,199
tossed about by a stormy sea the Zumbinis reach the shore speed runtime

279
00:52:55,199 --> 00:53:00,949
so you get how it works we have to get all the Zumbinis over to the Zumbini

280
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:07,789
island remember how this one works we're just gonna go all right good start let's

281
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:11,710
see if it's probably just wheels it's definitely just wheels we're still on

282
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:23,789
easy I think oh oh oh oh they made it harder maybe it's noses blue got it got

283
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:34,409
it all right what about pink let's go pink up here pink is also down here the

295
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:37,989
stone guards have their rules so do proceed with skin zoom beanies one guard

296
00:56:37,989 --> 00:57:00,059
won't allow surely here we go again all right little pebbles don't screw it up

297
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:05,460
because if you lose anybody in the early game you may as well just restart

298
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:20,440
just gotta pick up pick it all right all right what about this side okay is it

299
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:28,800
propeller it's not propeller it's also not potentially not even knows is it

300
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:39,079
eyes enjoy yourself okay but you might not be happy with okay

301
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:45,150
glasses all glasses this way you're gonna stop one of these I know you are

302
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:58,710
don't be shy good welcome propellers good all right what about skateboards

303
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:15,340
hello skateboards step right up okay propeller spring this way we must be

304
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:23,039
selective about our clientele well welcome hello this way welcome all

305
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:34,739
right pink shoes this way have a good time nailed it oh what's wrong with this

306
00:58:34,739 --> 00:58:49,139
character blue wait what no glass oh have a good time you did it you'll save

307
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:57,679
them all you're throwing I'm all fine you've done quite well how delightful

308
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:04,440
so stupid travelers continue on through this dusty wasteland you have to deduce

309
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:21,019
it first man all right pizza troll time should still be pretty easy

310
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:39,440
whatever you are always start with cheese every time okay let's do same

311
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:49,199
thing as the last time let's see if the RNG gave us the exact same thing based

312
00:59:49,199 --> 01:00:10,429
okay what about just helping us more stuff more stuff I think this guy in

313
01:00:10,429 --> 01:00:22,349
particular formed my entire personality somehow more stuff so if I I gotta get

314
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:40,050
this right don't like that maybe something Moscow okay so it's mushrooms

315
01:00:40,050 --> 01:01:16,539
and jalapenos I love the other two characters in this eventually as you

316
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:19,579
keep going and progressing you get harder the other two characters are

317
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:27,420
great too you have to please three different people with tons of toppings

318
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:51,500
boilers why this a campsite with hot soup all ready to meet but when they're

319
01:01:51,500 --> 01:02:03,440
ready to move on they'll need a group of 16 along the way go up we do not go up

320
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:13,039
yet beanies must have something in common with their neighbor to sit on

321
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:19,199
Captain Cajun's oh you need to match somebody this gets ridiculous I

322
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:35,690
remember later on that's be perfect welcome to the boat about right they

323
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:38,969
have to have something in common whatever you want to I don't really

324
01:02:39,969 --> 01:03:05,920
have to have something in common with your neighbor blue noses do hair we'll

325
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:29,619
do noses first blue nose and then hair and then wait there you go you got this

326
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:52,599
green bring hair there you go you got it okay hold on you blew it this is not

327
01:03:52,599 --> 01:04:44,239
on a time list no what what hair oh shit right sure shit hold on is there any

328
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:56,840
yellow noses this will do it right well it's no yeah I need a yellow nose at the

329
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:27,519
start what if I did this and go I'll give you a little bit of a tidbit in

330
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:32,159
30 years that I've come back and played this game every like half deck every

331
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:40,059
so I've never beaten this truly it's always wrong especially the medium to

332
01:05:40,059 --> 01:05:44,519
hard ones I think is impossible I think they actually made it not possible so

333
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:48,360
you guys can help when we get to hard because it's actually not physically

334
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:58,760
possible to beat it this is on easy okay um so what happens here is I believe you

335
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:04,500
put somebody on a frog and they jump out and they have to match a path based on

336
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:09,840
the color or the shape because you can't move anything so I have to put

337
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,000
this somewhere where it's gonna get to the other side based on I don't know

338
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:20,530
shape this one is shaped like the lily pad here so if I put this one here it'll

339
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:36,909
go up and then they'll die I think I'm just gonna I will have to figure it out

340
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:41,050
I'm just gonna go for it because this one is blue that you can only put this

341
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:46,480
on a blue so they're based on color and shape so okay if I put this one here

342
01:06:46,480 --> 01:07:01,190
this is what the three leaf one no okay this where am I going oh should have

343
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:06,250
missed it this one is correct but three leaf because it'll go here and then

344
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:15,139
it'll go up okay so this one is correct for the three leaf get somebody on here

345
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:31,519
all right yellow let's go this way but wait a minute is it the flower it's

346
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:44,559
looking at little four leaf or leaf what can I start here okay start here I just

347
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:50,690
do that as many times I want four leaf does not have a path I don't think so

348
01:07:50,690 --> 01:08:01,070
the line is the color yeah so if I go pink pink can know yeah wait all right

349
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:12,530
pink can do it right here each frog can be used twice okay that's good to know

350
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:24,720
what about blue this looks pretty solid yeah it's a solid for blue with X X does

351
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:36,319
not have a starting path so fuck with this one this one also does not have a

352
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:53,539
starting path dark blue has a path what about the pac-man pac-man has a starting

353
01:08:53,539 --> 01:09:06,039
path and doesn't go anywhere no wait all right pac-man has the correct path here

354
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:25,180
for red what about this shape yeah all right this shape has a path right here

355
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:41,970
it doesn't matter right each one can be used twice so this is fine what yellow

356
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:45,750
yellow yeah yellow it can do it too will they hurt each other if they run into

357
01:09:45,750 --> 01:10:04,949
each other which one was it this one right yeah this one here okay what about

358
01:10:04,989 --> 01:10:20,319
this I can start here oh no this doesn't work here this doesn't work either I

359
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:30,600
don't think this one works at all what about X no yellow yellow can still go I

360
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:46,359
need four more diamond does work where are you seeing diamond working does no

361
01:10:46,359 --> 01:11:00,579
diamond doesn't have a path where do you see diamonds path down up turning it does

362
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:08,359
it doesn't does bottom diamond at the bottom works huh right right down no it

363
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:21,000
doesn't it gets stuck right here no wait like diamond diamond diamond diamond

364
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:38,829
diamond diamond no middle middle middle teal diamond no look look see it gets

365
01:11:38,829 --> 01:11:54,659
trapped right here ah three leaf well any three more it was a three leave that

366
01:11:54,659 --> 01:12:01,270
worked already wasn't it because this one here yeah it's this one here

367
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:24,430
oh is that pac-man one over here right why so many ads you should not be

368
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:30,670
getting any ads I mean when you come to the stream you get when I can't turn

369
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:39,229
those off there's a lot of ads right now I didn't run any all right one more who's

370
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:52,180
the last one the diamond okay I haven't gotten any I've gotten 12 I think you're

371
01:12:52,180 --> 01:13:11,810
making that up we want to play an app do you guys remember when you guys would

372
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:26,149

373
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:31,670
ads oh my god pogchamp please more ads and you guys weren't hitting you actually

374
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:50,960
wanted me to do it me it was very funny and weird I feel like the the upper path

375
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:57,470
is the hard path because I remember some of these being very very very hard later

376
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:01,960
this being one of them I don't know what this wants me to do so we're gonna have

01:21:08,899 --> 01:21:27,300
That nearly killed me. Just wait till it's on hard. It's unbearable. I'm never gonna be able to do it.

410
01:21:27,859 --> 01:21:36,159
I remember when I was younger. I think I even asked my mother to help me do some of these things in this game.

411
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:39,880
And she was like, I just I can't do this, Jeremy.

412
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:44,680
Just like, I can't, I don't understand, I can't do this.

413
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:48,199
Yo, just wait, you'll see.

414
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,500
You'll come!

415
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:10,619
All right, we got her back.

416
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:27,899
Throughout these gloomy mountains, strange carvings left by ancient peoples are everywhere.

417
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:38,859
Well, I just turned off pre-roll ads for how long did it say? Like 20 minutes? That's like not a bad thing.

418
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:47,319
Okay. All right, here we go. You gotta go buy glasses.

419
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:58,890
So glasses first. I thought she was gone.

420
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:12,569
All right, we're good.

421
01:23:12,569 --> 01:23:15,300
What is that? I can't tell what that is.

422
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,600
And then sunglasses.

423
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,600
What?

424
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,239
Oh, no, it's not. All right, don't close the gate on them.

425
01:23:32,359 --> 01:23:35,079
What?

426
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:39,750
Uh-oh. Wait, what's? Oh, there's one more of these.

427
01:23:44,659 --> 01:23:49,020
World trusted guide.

428
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:57,579
You run a few minutes of ads in a row and you can disable them for an hour.

429
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:05,739
I really just hate running ads. Use the crystal filters to change the Zumbini's reflection.

430
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:09,500
It will give them crystal slamming protection.

431
01:24:13,579 --> 01:24:16,300
All right, I've got all 16. We're almost there.

432
01:24:24,779 --> 01:24:27,899
Okay, this one takes the most time, obviously.

433
01:24:28,699 --> 01:24:30,539
We have to get it right.

434
01:24:30,539 --> 01:24:51,399
I have to pee so bad, but no, I'm not peeing until I beat the Zumbini's.

435
01:24:53,399 --> 01:24:54,760
At least get

436
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:59,720
this group over.

437
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,979
Oh, right here.

438
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:13,829
Okay, next.

439
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:20,310
I love that little like bird sound, whatever it is. It's like bats.

440
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:34,899
Right here, a diaper.

441
01:25:34,979 --> 01:25:38,899
I don't trust that, honestly. I don't need it, but I don't, I don't, I don't trust it.

442
01:25:45,289 --> 01:25:47,130
I just don't trust it.

443
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:49,609
An adult diaper to me is like, I don't know. I feel like I

444
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:52,970
Sometimes I do like a full 60 second piss. I don't think it would work.

445
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:10,100
Okay. Oh, there we go.

446
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:41,260
60 second piss is easy. I don't think so. Spring?

447
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:51,220
Well, there's only two springs. So if it's a spring and it doesn't, yeah, it's not gonna match.

448
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:12,680
How much is 60 seconds to gallons? I don't, I don't know. Gallons?

449
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:16,739
I wonder. I'll figure it out one day.

450
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:37,140
Okay.

451
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:48,470
I'm eating a whole tray of ice. Why are you doing that? Did you make ice popsicles? Because if you did, cool.

452
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:50,970
But if you didn't, then

453
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:59,420
what are you doing?

454
01:27:59,899 --> 01:28:07,369
Okay.

455
01:28:07,369 --> 01:28:09,850
See, this one takes the longest, but this is the patience.

456
01:28:10,489 --> 01:28:12,409
This is the patience part of the game.

457
01:28:13,289 --> 01:28:16,649
It's really easy to be like, oh, just let's go and hurry up, but you'll make a mistake.

458
01:28:17,449 --> 01:28:45,670
Bottom right. Hurry up.

459
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:58,630
I just did it. Okay.

460
01:29:03,859 --> 01:29:07,859
What is wrong with the stream tags?

461
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:15,220
Um, he's having enough fiber. See, see how it off-brand eats bugs.

462
01:29:15,619 --> 01:29:22,229
I don't know because I don't, I don't, the tags just don't, I don't really care.

463
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:30,520
Almost fucked it up. See, that's what happens in your rush.

464
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,479
How does the mail work?

465
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,250
Um,

466
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:58,010
go look up like a science fucking video. I don't know. Like, I know, but I don't want to sit here to explain it.

467
01:29:58,409 --> 01:30:02,250
It's like, I don't know. It's a big long complicated process with a lot of moving parts.

468
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:06,649
It's probably a YouTube video about like, how does the mail get sorted and shipped?

469
01:30:07,449 --> 01:30:09,449
Why do you want me to tell you that? I don't know.

470
01:30:26,899 --> 01:30:33,050
Hey, dude, how does it, how does a mail work?

471
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:39,579
I don't know.

472
01:30:39,579 --> 01:30:42,060
You put it into the mailbox and the

473
01:30:42,779 --> 01:30:46,140
carrier picks it up, brings it to a sorting facility and

474
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,500
sends it out with different carriers.

475
01:30:50,619 --> 01:30:59,590
Oh, look it up.

476
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:01,590
All right, I'm gonna mess this up. I have to pay attention.

477
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:11,659
Okay, only

478
01:31:11,659 --> 01:31:15,420
ponytails can go this way or they die.

479
01:31:17,449 --> 01:31:24,729
So if you have a ponytail, you cannot go this way. You are dead. So all ponytails, please

480
01:31:25,289 --> 01:31:27,289
line up at this one.

481
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:51,369
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's not necessarily true. Hold on. Yes, it is. How much is this game?

482
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:55,079
Um

483
01:31:55,539 --> 01:32:01,029
Owned it for a very long time. How long I think it's like

484
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:04,149
10 bucks 5 bucks 20 bucks

485
01:32:04,869 --> 01:32:06,869
It can't be more than that

486
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:17,369
Okay, so let's get this right because I see a lot of bullshit over here

487
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:23,369
So if I take this person with the glasses and I have you go up here, you're gonna go right

488
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:29,210
Up, you're gonna pass this you're gonna pass this and you're gonna be fine

489
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:36,979
so now

490
01:32:36,979 --> 01:32:42,020
Glasses goes this way if I put glasses here again, it's gonna go right up and then get

491
01:32:42,739 --> 01:32:45,689
Completely screwed up and die. So

492
01:32:47,289 --> 01:32:49,289
It has to be somebody with

493
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,800
What about sunglasses if I do sunglasses?

494
01:32:52,359 --> 01:33:05,420
We're good. So we have to alternate until there are no more glasses left. No, what do you mean? No what?

495
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:11,779
No, that's right. I got it. So then I do the the glasses will go up and be fine

496
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:20,220
I'm fine. What do you guys chat? What are you going about? Have you gotten the grimace meal yet? No, I'll probably try it eventually here

497
01:33:22,949 --> 01:33:31,960
I got it because now i'll do the glasses will go up into the right and then be fine and then we do sunglasses

498
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:50,220
I didn't fuck it up. Oh, no, I got it. You guys are just you gaslighting

499
01:33:51,560 --> 01:34:06,760
Okay, now it doesn't matter now everybody can just go on it. I hope this is right

500
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,859
Yeah, it doesn't matter anymore. I got it

501
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:24,699
All right, all 16 made it

502
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:28,170
Everybody died

503
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:35,300
Let's go

504
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:42,810
One died in the crystal. Oh

505
01:34:43,369 --> 01:34:47,479
This is this be the place they've been seeking

506
01:34:51,159 --> 01:35:05,619
I like when he does the funny voice. Yeah, I don't know if you can hear the audio wine

507
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,350
it's like

508
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:11,100
Got a house

509
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:13,340
The schoolhouse salutes the zoom beanies who?

510
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:18,939
armed captain cajun rode tattooed toads and knew how to network

511
01:35:19,739 --> 01:35:24,600
Got a house

512
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:36,149
Trying to get some uh, some dwellings here this clock tower

513
01:35:37,699 --> 01:35:42,890
Cool building out the village

514
01:35:47,529 --> 01:35:50,340
Okay, still doing the journey

515
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:56,859
It's still on a pretty we still we still on easy. Let's try to speed run after I p I'll be right back

516
01:35:57,020 --> 01:40:52,060
Give you a warning that the music was stopping and I saw a monkey ass. Yeah. Yeah, I see if i've seen a few monkey asses

517
01:40:52,699 --> 01:41:08,699
You've gone for a long time. What was I? I wasn't gone for that long. Well, I had to pee and then I had to refill my water

518
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:12,260
Beverage, why did you say it like that?

519
01:41:13,079 --> 01:41:16,039
Why didn't you just say water you said water and then pause and said beverage

520
01:41:16,119 --> 01:41:21,829
Why did you why did you pause? Why did you couldn't you just you could have just said water what's in the water?

521
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:27,159
a little bit of a uh

522
01:41:27,159 --> 01:41:28,619
a bit of a tea

523
01:41:28,619 --> 01:41:30,699
Powdered drink thingy having it today

524
01:41:33,659 --> 01:41:42,520
Okay, let's go. It's like I fuck with you guys and then I end up just fucking with myself

525
01:41:54,779 --> 01:41:59,579
All right. Is this a good makeup here?

526
01:41:59,579 --> 01:42:03,420
I'm speed running is i'm gonna go as fast I can now because I think after we do this next one

527
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:06,859
We should unlock the next difficulty. So let's go i'm going doesn't matter what is i'll make it work

528
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:14,340
You want variety? Yeah

529
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:27,720
I think this is pretty good. Maybe some more of the smaller eyes like this. Just make them all the same

530
01:42:28,539 --> 01:42:31,260
I think you actually get soft locked if you do that

531
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:43,340
Because if one of the bridges for instance doesn't allow red noses and everybody has a red nose you they all die

532
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,300
Also, um, can we get a pole?

533
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:03,140
Do you want me to skip the intro cut scenes for each little game?

534
01:43:03,699 --> 01:43:07,539
If we speed right, you know what I mean? All right, let's go speed run

535
01:43:09,510 --> 01:43:13,350
All right, it's gonna be shoes probably, uh, we got pink shoes going up here

536
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:19,430
Is that correct? This looks pretty good. All right, what about um,

537
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,039
No, that's not right

538
01:43:22,039 --> 01:43:24,409
So what is it then?

539
01:43:24,489 --> 01:43:26,489
Okay, it could be

540
01:43:27,989 --> 01:43:30,390
Different eyes. All right. What about is it eyes?

541
01:43:32,789 --> 01:43:36,699
Might be looks good so far

542
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:41,050
Uh-huh. I think it's based on eyes

543
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:49,020
up

544
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:52,090
Is it not eyes hair

545
01:43:55,029 --> 01:44:01,220
So what makes you able to go up here nose? All right, it's noses

546
01:44:10,069 --> 01:44:11,189
What?

547
01:44:11,189 --> 01:44:15,640
It's only pink allowed in the bottom

548
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:20,380
So many people are going on this first bridge

549
01:44:22,979 --> 01:44:24,180
Okay

550
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:28,550
well

551
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:30,949
Uh, I actually can't I gotta be careful because

552
01:44:31,989 --> 01:44:35,909
All right, can yellow go here?

553
01:44:37,029 --> 01:44:39,750
Okay, i'm gonna everyone's dead. They're all dead after this

554
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:42,970
Because I okay. I know you go

555
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:44,630
Up here

556
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:48,489
Does everybody go up here but pink if I get it wrong, they're dead

557
01:44:50,069 --> 01:44:53,659
Only pink at the bottom

558
01:44:53,739 --> 01:44:55,350
What?

559
01:44:55,350 --> 01:44:57,430
That's weird. Okay. Well, we made it

560
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,090
You

561
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:06,899
You'll save them all. Are you dumb? No, that's a weird

562
01:45:07,699 --> 01:45:12,819
Only two people go on the bottom bridge. That's weird. This doesn't usually happen that way guards have their rules

563
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,140
So do proceed with skill

564
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:18,100
Zumbini's one guard won't allow

565
01:45:23,989 --> 01:45:27,979
You are dumb. Hey, i'll run another ad if you say that again

566
01:45:28,779 --> 01:45:31,100
I'm not actually gonna run another ad. Welcome

567
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:40,010
Okay, let's just go. Okay

568
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:44,729
We must be selective about our clientele. Have a vote over here

569
01:45:47,899 --> 01:45:56,550
Let's try um noses enjoy yourself. Okay, is it all yellow noses? Is it a nose playthrough this time? All right

570
01:46:03,609 --> 01:46:05,930
Enjoy yourself. Okay blue noses

571
01:46:06,409 --> 01:46:18,039
What's the problem? Welcome

572
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:25,500
The hair

573
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:30,250
Enjoy yourself

574
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:36,329
I misunderstood what this stream was gonna be. I thought you were gonna drive around on one of those ice cleaners for skating rinks

575
01:46:36,649 --> 01:46:44,199
I mean that's

576
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:55,260
That's funny. All right hair who else has that spiky hair you do. All right you

577
01:46:56,939 --> 01:46:59,369
This way, okay

578
01:47:01,529 --> 01:47:09,210
Speed run go

579
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:16,979
Okay, not a single person has been able to go up and to be selective about our clientele

580
01:47:17,699 --> 01:47:22,090
We can't go up in this area. Why? Okay by me

581
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:33,060
Have a good time

582
01:47:34,569 --> 01:47:36,569
Uh, oh they're okay, right?

583
01:47:37,130 --> 01:47:41,079
We're good

584
01:47:41,079 --> 01:47:43,319
Splendid say hi to arno

585
01:47:44,279 --> 01:47:50,520
Say hi to auto our brave travelers. I'll say hi to auto this dusty wasteland until they meet

586
01:47:51,079 --> 01:48:00,739
Oh

587
01:48:04,409 --> 01:48:07,050
All right, still simple still basic we're good

588
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:11,340
Whatever you are

589
01:48:16,859 --> 01:48:23,739
So this formula starts to become impossible to we have to go a little bit more detailed but no cheese

590
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:44,479
All right, so you like pepperoni and mushrooms

591
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:53,460
More more, okay, crony mushrooms and peppers

592
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:13,390
You want them all? All right. Well, here you go

593
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:25,289
I think eventually you start making ice creams too for them, right?

594
01:49:26,329 --> 01:49:37,359
Spoiler, I know but whatever it's fun. Everything but cheese

595
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:55,800
You're adjusting to the trials of the journey like look she messed up if you must we're going down

596
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:59,000
I'm going down. I'm not the up is harder

597
01:50:05,149 --> 01:50:07,949
There's no sense leaving it up to chance

598
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:14,350
Okay, this we know this one. All right, so let's just get somebody to go forward

599
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:26,300
All right, so spring is

600
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:29,340
uh heels

601
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:34,970
Can we match anything here? All right, so we got all right these eyes. All right

602
01:50:35,979 --> 01:50:38,859
I would say the same like three words a lot today

603
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:47,609
What about the hair? All right yellow?

604
01:50:48,170 --> 01:50:52,989
Shit, all right. So yellow noses are blue noses

605
01:50:58,010 --> 01:51:01,369
Just take a guess here. All right. Shit. Stop saying that

606
01:51:02,409 --> 01:51:04,170
Fuck it in my own head

607
01:51:04,170 --> 01:51:11,039
I can't I can't help but I have to it's like a filler word for my brain

608
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:24,840
So it has to be these two. There's only two more yellow noses

609
01:51:27,739 --> 01:51:34,649
Yeah

610
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:47,600
This one

611
01:51:49,840 --> 01:52:02,960
It's almost no more room on the tree oh it's pink shoes pink shoes this one

612
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:30,569
All right, this one's easy i'm skipping I know

613
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:36,960
I know don't skip don't skip. How could you skip zoom beanies intro cut scenes? I know but we'll watch them again

614
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:49,130
See if it's hair it might be here it might be noses too nose it looks like it's noses again

615
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:03,979
All right, so if it's yellow noses then

616
01:53:04,699 --> 01:53:10,380
That's it green

617
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:33,369
The door opening noise is the same on the tf2 team selection screen. It is you're right

618
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:37,819
Cool a place for everyone and everyone in a place

619
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:47,529
You know that although I say that but I've I hear sounds in games and in movies and I go I know where that's from

620
01:53:53,319 --> 01:53:57,789
My favorite puzzle

621
01:53:57,789 --> 01:53:59,789
All right, let's get us squared up

622
01:54:00,569 --> 01:54:03,069
Okay, so this is green

623
01:54:03,069 --> 01:54:05,069
So triangle yellow

624
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:10,000
Oh red

625
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,520
so red

626
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,760
Some of the shape of triangle blue

627
01:54:16,109 --> 01:54:18,109
Oh crap

628
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:21,390
Whoa, what am I doing? It's pink. Okay

629
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,359
Yellow

630
01:54:31,359 --> 01:54:44,329
square

631
01:54:44,329 --> 01:54:45,609
yellow

632
01:54:45,609 --> 01:54:50,699
circle

633
01:54:50,699 --> 01:54:52,699
What the fuck is this game?

634
01:54:52,779 --> 01:54:54,779
Laughing my ass off

635
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:02,539
Logical journey of the zoom beanies

636
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:20,510
I don't want to run out of juice here circle red

637
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:33,130
red triangle

638
01:55:33,609 --> 01:55:36,890
Wait, what? Oh shit. No, no, no triangle blue

639
01:55:38,489 --> 01:55:44,569
Whoa, wait, what's happening blue? Wait blue circle. I'm gonna people are gonna die people are dead

640
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:51,850
I have one shot left. It's pink diamond

641
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:59,239
I have enough for one more shot. It's pink diamond

642
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:07,159
Thank god, that was it I would have lost I almost just threw one easy

643
01:56:32,170 --> 01:56:37,470
Another relaxing campsite ready and waiting for zoom beanies

644
01:56:38,170 --> 01:56:40,170
And they'll need their rest

645
01:56:40,489 --> 01:56:46,750
The darkest most dangerous part of the journey is yet to come

646
01:56:56,109 --> 01:56:59,550
There are two other zoom beanies games that were apparently dog shit

647
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:04,590
I want to play them. I never played them even when I was younger

648
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,659
They were good

649
01:57:13,659 --> 01:57:15,819
How do they compare to the logical journey of the zoom beanies?

650
01:57:17,399 --> 01:57:33,949
Mountain rescue is super good. All right, i'm willing to try it spring. This pace is so much better

651
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,289
This is way too scary

652
01:58:06,970 --> 01:58:12,460
What are you talking about got it right off the bat

653
01:58:13,899 --> 01:58:23,050
I gotta go fast. I told you I was not gonna just mess around right now. Here we go. All right

654
01:58:24,010 --> 01:58:26,010
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh

655
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:35,119
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh

656
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:56,430
Trembling and shivering and sweating because this game is so scary

657
01:58:57,149 --> 01:59:07,149
Well, um, I don't know. I wonder how well you do with the back of cereal boxes because that's the same amount of fear inducing

658
01:59:07,869 --> 01:59:09,310
imagery

659
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:11,390
So I I don't know what to tell you

660
01:59:11,390 --> 01:59:22,189
Yeah

661
01:59:22,189 --> 01:59:26,510
All right, we're gonna go by noses first let's go red nose

662
01:59:39,260 --> 01:59:46,939
Um

663
01:59:46,939 --> 01:59:52,960
Nope, that's wrong

664
01:59:53,600 --> 02:00:08,060
How many zoom beanies you think you could eat I don't know how big zoom beanies are I think they're really small

665
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:28,729
Why would I want to eat the zoom beanies

666
02:00:37,689 --> 02:00:40,090
I'm not even gonna give that a response because it was so

667
02:00:41,670 --> 02:00:46,340
Unbelievably stupid. Okay

668
02:00:47,159 --> 02:00:58,090
They look delicious

669
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:17,340
Unbelievably out of bounds. Okay. All right. All right. They look like candy

670
02:01:36,119 --> 02:01:40,649
Gargamel there's gargamel from the smurfs

671
02:01:43,439 --> 02:01:54,720
Wait, so gargamel's whole thing was he wanted to eat them. That was his whole villain schtick because I'm going to eat the smurfs

672
02:01:58,319 --> 02:01:59,680
What why?

673
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:07,880
It wasn't about like world domination or something

674
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:10,840
It was he just wanted to eat them because he thought they looked like they would taste good

675
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:16,220
Because they have an eternal life

676
02:02:18,439 --> 02:02:23,880
The smurfs live forever. No, they don't the smurfs do not live forever. They don't have eternal life

677
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,359
They'd live

678
02:02:26,359 --> 02:02:28,359
Like as long as a crane fly

679
02:02:29,159 --> 02:02:31,399
Like fucking four days. What are you talking about?

680
02:02:44,189 --> 02:02:49,840
No, dude, but what about papa smurf? Have you not seen the movie?

681
02:02:50,779 --> 02:02:58,409
No, i've not seen any of the smurf movies I can't say i've witnessed any of the smurf movies

682
02:03:00,439 --> 02:03:09,920
I've seen some of the old smurf cartoons

683
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:13,199
from the 80s and 90s

684
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:18,109
But not any of the movies when they went 3d. I haven't seen any of them

685
02:03:36,439 --> 02:03:42,109
Where's the zoom beanie the lower button? Oh, it's gonna mess me up

686
02:03:44,039 --> 02:03:52,859
Didn't you play smurfs dance party smurfs smurfs quests

687
02:03:54,109 --> 02:04:03,069
Quests i'm gonna mess up your brain for a little while. Our language is so weird say quests

688
02:04:04,489 --> 02:04:06,399
quests

689
02:04:06,399 --> 02:04:08,960
We make like a

690
02:04:10,159 --> 02:04:17,199
Quests quests. Oh, I have to do some I have to do some quests. It's it's a double

691
02:04:18,479 --> 02:04:20,439
I didn't realize you're doing it

692
02:04:20,439 --> 02:04:22,439
quests quests

693
02:04:23,359 --> 02:04:25,789
quests

694
02:04:25,789 --> 02:04:27,789
You're never gonna be able to say that word ever again

695
02:04:41,439 --> 02:04:42,880
That's just you

696
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:45,609
That's not quests

697
02:04:56,439 --> 02:05:01,390
Forget the stream by tomorrow, dude

698
02:05:05,529 --> 02:05:11,289
I'm trying to figure out if that's like some kind of an insult or if that's just your just like I don't really care

699
02:05:11,930 --> 02:05:15,289
What is that? Is that what was that like an insult that sounded like an insult?

700
02:05:16,489 --> 02:05:19,449
I don't think that's what it was though. I think it was just purely like I dude

701
02:05:19,449 --> 02:05:22,409
I'm not gonna remember this tomorrow like you saying this shit

702
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:27,770
Was it an insult?

703
02:05:27,770 --> 02:05:29,770
All right, be careful

704
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:44,939
All right, if you have a red nose

705
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:47,640
The left side

706
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:53,310
Is always safe. You have a red nose and you go on the right side. You will always die

707
02:05:54,109 --> 02:05:55,789
Let's just get that out of the way

708
02:05:55,789 --> 02:06:13,949
for the rest of you

709
02:06:13,949 --> 02:06:16,430
Everybody else has to go this way, but we got to do this right

710
02:06:17,069 --> 02:06:17,869
so

711
02:06:17,869 --> 02:06:18,829
up

712
02:06:18,829 --> 02:06:21,069
if you have we have to alternate between

713
02:06:23,609 --> 02:06:24,970
the

714
02:06:24,970 --> 02:06:28,569
Eyes and the glasses so we want to do glasses first

715
02:06:28,729 --> 02:06:35,779
First then these eyes then glasses and glasses

716
02:06:38,239 --> 02:06:42,899
And eyes and glasses

717
02:06:47,229 --> 02:06:49,229
Now everybody else should be safe

718
02:06:50,109 --> 02:06:57,369
Yep, we're good. Oh, oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what'd I do?

719
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:20,250
No, i'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good. It's a full party

720
02:07:20,810 --> 02:07:22,329
16

721
02:07:22,329 --> 02:07:28,680
We need to report on the smurf movie by the next stream. Okay

722
02:07:30,939 --> 02:07:32,939
Do you do you want to give me homework?

723
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:36,539
Do would you like me to live?

724
02:07:36,539 --> 02:07:40,380
Tweet the smurf movie and when I say live tweet, I mean just write a bunch of notes about it

725
02:07:43,470 --> 02:07:45,470
Yeah

726
02:07:45,550 --> 02:07:53,579
Which one so I every like five minutes or ten minutes I will write

We'll go over it

733
02:08:18,109 --> 02:08:23,250
This be the place they've been seeking a place of hope and prosperity

734
02:08:24,109 --> 02:08:33,199
How much time do I have I could do this by next stream?

735
02:08:36,029 --> 02:08:39,819
Oh, we got a bowling alley

736
02:08:39,819 --> 02:08:47,390
Look what we got

737
02:08:47,390 --> 02:08:48,510

738
02:08:48,510 --> 02:08:52,800
Any other new buildings?

Cool house more dwellings

740
02:08:58,829 --> 02:09:06,439
Uh-oh. All right. The game just got harder

741
02:09:07,310 --> 02:09:21,159
It decided to make this path these. Okay, the game is harder now. Here we go. Who's your favorite smurf?

Different smurfs are there? Uh, there are a hundred smurfs in total ever

Wait, there's only a hundred smurfs. Why are they only a hundred? Is this like a

02:10:42,569 --> 02:10:48,960
It's not like like like a sparta scenario. It only took 100 smurfs

02:18:02,780 --> 02:18:03,659

Look awkwardly around and wait for someone else to start dancing

Okay, your best friend tells you she's moving four hours away

863
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:07,629
You make a scrapbook of all the good times you've had together and leave a bunch of blank pages to fill in with the days to come

864
02:23:09,049 --> 02:23:12,250
Start crying immediately and plan for a major. Goodbye party

867
02:23:28,459 --> 02:23:32,360

Uh, I it's worth a long drive. Let's go

871
02:23:48,559 --> 02:23:50,319
There's been a massive heat wave for about a week

872
02:23:50,319 --> 02:23:57,129
Your most likely course of action is to go outside and just just bake in the sun. Yep this one

873
02:23:58,239 --> 02:24:03,889
This one's comfortable, but personally go check on your grandparents

02:24:26,059 --> 02:24:31,850
Uh, I would learn a new language makes like I don't know sense to me. What language do you want to learn?

877
02:24:32,090 --> 02:24:38,440
It's more spanish. The best way to see a movie is

878
02:24:39,309 --> 02:24:44,350
Grabbing your wait alert alert alert mod chat. You have to take a survey to get your results

879
02:24:44,350 --> 02:24:51,559
They won't let you get your results. You have to take a survey. Oh, how long is the survey?

880
02:24:51,879 --> 02:25:08,409
Do I have to take a survey? I don't know lol. I didn't take it. You can skip it

881
02:25:10,729 --> 02:25:14,729
I don't but I don't want to no. No, no, I don't i'm not taking a survey. Is there a different one?

882
02:25:15,049 --> 02:25:22,600
Fuck oh no

883
02:25:22,600 --> 02:25:23,959
just

884
02:25:23,959 --> 02:25:25,479
All right. All right. All right. All right

885
02:25:25,479 --> 02:25:32,010
the best way to see a movie is with a good friend going to the theater for a

886
02:25:32,569 --> 02:25:38,040
Matinee grabbing your pals and jamming into the car to go to the drive-in

887
02:25:39,680 --> 02:25:46,280
On your big screen tv with the surround sound. No, I don't like that. I like I watch movies

888
02:25:46,360 --> 02:25:52,729
I'm such a shitty person to watch movies with people probably hate sitting there with me and watching tv shows and stuff

889
02:25:52,729 --> 02:25:57,520
I turn the volume way down. I hate loud ass movies in tv. It just annoys me

890
02:25:59,549 --> 02:26:05,340
I hate very loud movies in television. It's like I want I want to be able to understand it get a good

891
02:26:05,899 --> 02:26:17,389
Kind of grasp of what's going on. I mean it's it's one of these

892
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:24,250
I'd say one two or three

893
02:26:24,250 --> 02:26:25,770
It's probably one

894
02:26:25,770 --> 02:26:27,950
But the drive not the drive-in though

895
02:26:28,030 --> 02:26:30,319
But i'm gonna pick this one

896
02:26:30,319 --> 02:26:36,170
You've been given the opportunity to choose one superpower to possess for 24 hours

897
02:26:36,170 --> 02:26:41,639
You choose to go back in time to be invisible to be a speed reader

898
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:49,629
To fly or to be super why to be a speed reader who clicks that which what do you clicked on that one?

899
02:26:51,420 --> 02:26:59,049
You can choose between speed reading books or flying. I think time travel would be interesting

900
02:27:01,850 --> 02:27:05,209
Your sister needs you to look after her three kids for the weekend you

901
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:11,260
Rent a bunch of movies and make popcorn take them to the museum to see dinosaur bones

902
02:27:11,340 --> 02:27:12,299
That's pretty cool

903
02:27:12,299 --> 02:27:16,120
Take it to the fair and let them eat as much cotton candy as they want

904
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:21,920
Set up a tent in the backyard and tell them not two spooky stories around a campfire

905
02:27:22,239 --> 02:27:35,290
Spend the weekend getting to know them better and are sad when they leave. I want to tell you it's this one

906
02:27:35,770 --> 02:27:38,360
But realistically, it's this one

907
02:27:38,360 --> 02:27:43,850
I want to pretend like it would be this one, but we all know it's this one

908
02:27:44,090 --> 02:27:50,540
You go to an amusement park with the gang your favorite part of the whole day is

909
02:27:51,020 --> 02:27:57,559
Crashing and smashing on the bumper boats screaming until your voice is gone on the scariest roller coasters

910
02:27:57,639 --> 02:28:02,399
You hate them, but you love them going on the ferris wheel and looking for your house from the top

911
02:28:02,719 --> 02:28:07,770
Taking pictures and just hanging out with your friends playing games and winning a stuffed animal for your crush

912
02:28:08,250 --> 02:28:18,270
Now too much movement, especially if you've eaten during the day this one, but I don't screaming. No, I don't scream on it

913
02:28:18,270 --> 02:28:28,040
I'm completely silent anybody else silent roller coaster enjoyers anybody else just kind of sit there with a stone

02:28:28,909 --> 02:28:32,879
Just cold face just moving and okay

915
02:28:35,159 --> 02:28:39,180
I'm not a whoo-hoo hands up kind of guy. I am a

916
02:28:40,200 --> 02:28:49,309
Internalize this and enjoy this I don't like make any noise. I mean, that's not true sundaes were meant for

917
02:28:50,760 --> 02:28:59,920
Shutting the world out. It's just me time crafting and creating masterpieces going to church shopping and grab

918

Gabbing with your best friends catching up on housework. I mean, it's definitely just I mean if it's the me time right sunday sunday

02:29:30,489 --> 02:29:34,909
No, it'd be probably this one

922
02:29:34,909 --> 02:29:39,870
You invite a bunch of friends to go to the mall when you are there you see someone you totally forgot to invite

923
02:29:40,719 --> 02:29:48,780
You call her later to say you're an idiot and you're sorry call out her name and beckon for her to come over

924
02:29:50,010 --> 02:29:54,059
Ask her to join you and apologize for forgetting her don't know what to do

925
02:29:54,059 --> 02:29:56,059
She walks by and you just look the other way

926
02:29:59,129 --> 02:30:09,479
Gasp and duck behind a display and stay hidden until she disappears. Well, there needs to be more context here

927
02:30:11,319 --> 02:30:13,319
You invite a bunch of friends

928
02:30:14,319 --> 02:30:17,719
To go to the mall when you were there you see someone

929
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:23,280
You forgot to invite is this a friend or just a person I know that's incredibly important

930
02:30:25,260 --> 02:30:29,260
When you you see someone you totally forgot to invite if it's a friend

931
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:33,639
And I do how often do I see this person? Do I hang out with this person a lot?

932
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:41,100
Is this a friend that you see like once every few months? Is this a friend? That's always you know every day is a daily

933
02:30:41,659 --> 02:30:46,700
Friend, this is a monthly friend. Is this like a every six to 12 months you see this person somewhere

934
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:51,840
This is really important and I don't I don't know which one it is i'm going to treat this like it is a

935
02:30:52,780 --> 02:31:08,510
A like daily friend like a friend that you see a lot. It's probably this one and I would be like, hey

936
02:31:10,190 --> 02:31:11,760

939
02:31:26,799 --> 02:31:31,280
You just had a very stressful day at work a very stressful day

940
02:31:37,690 --> 02:31:40,889
You are looking forward to finally getting home and relaxing when you get there you

941
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:54,040
Write in your journal for an hour and get all your worries out on paper call up a friend and fill her in on the nastiness of your day

942
02:31:55,370 --> 02:31:57,530

02:32:00,909 --> 02:32:03,719

947
02:32:59,440 --> 02:33:15,799
But underneath that armor of humor, you're actually quite a deep thinker in a word. You are fun. Okay

948
02:33:16,600 --> 02:33:21,020
How would why would I have gotten how did I answer clumsy stuff?

Table eating smurf that's i'm it seems one i'm really curious how that works has built up immunity at last

975
02:37:26,920 --> 02:37:29,239
All right, so this one is harder we got to be prepared for this

976
02:37:35,559 --> 02:37:53,479
Okay, let's just start simple is it the all right looks like spring

977
02:37:57,860 --> 02:37:59,780
No, it's hair

978
02:37:59,780 --> 02:38:03,690

02:38:56,620 --> 02:38:58,620
Oh whoops

983
02:38:58,700 --> 02:39:13,909
Okay

02:39:13,909 --> 02:39:17,079
You you saved them all

985
02:39:19,079 --> 02:39:25,000
How many times will he repeat playing this game on multiple streams? This guy is this game? He's gonna play in his death bed

986
02:39:34,139 --> 02:39:36,379
I mean, I played this once on stream

987
02:39:37,500 --> 02:39:43,579
So do proceed with skill in 2017. I played this for two and three hours tops

988
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:47,420
You've never seen this game ever again since or before that

989
02:39:51,180 --> 02:39:53,180
Here we go again

990
02:39:53,180 --> 02:39:55,659
What did we do to deserve this?

991
02:39:56,219 --> 02:39:58,219
Okay

992
02:39:58,459 --> 02:40:01,659
Remember it's hotter don't be shy

993
02:40:02,620 --> 02:40:05,399
Let's go spring

994
02:40:05,399 --> 02:40:06,680
Okay

995
02:40:06,680 --> 02:40:11,260
It might be noses

996
02:40:11,260 --> 02:40:13,260
Okay, it might be hair

997
02:40:14,459 --> 02:40:18,899
Is it hair?

998
02:40:18,899 --> 02:40:20,180

999
02:40:20,180 --> 02:40:22,180
Not all doors are open to you

1000
02:40:23,700 --> 02:40:29,209
What do I do is that the only person that can go in there

1001
02:40:30,170 --> 02:40:33,819
Glasses

1002
02:40:38,899 --> 02:40:48,299
Okay, this way

1003
02:40:50,100 --> 02:40:52,540
Okay

1004
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:54,540
So what is the difference between these two?

1005
02:40:55,879 --> 02:40:58,250
Have you go all the way up here?

1006
02:41:02,260 --> 02:41:04,260
You don't like the nose maybe

1007
02:41:06,229 --> 02:41:08,229
Okay, let's just see what happens if I go this way

1008
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:28,489
Let's try yellow nose this way, okay, I think this is good maybe it is noses

1009
02:41:31,989 --> 02:41:33,989

Let you better let me in away you go

1031
02:43:28,049 --> 02:43:30,690
You've done cool, I knew they could do it

1032
02:43:32,290 --> 02:43:40,530
All right, this is a higher difficulty pizza one finicky eaters one troll's poison is another troll's pizza

1033
02:43:41,719 --> 02:43:47,559
pizza for lunch and snacks and dinner and dessert baby would

1034
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:50,200
satisfy me

1035
02:43:52,069 --> 02:43:53,909
New character

1036
02:43:53,909 --> 02:44:02,180
This is where it gets hard

1037
02:44:02,180 --> 02:44:05,000
So there is ice cream now

1038
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:09,750
So here's the deal we're gonna go

1039
02:44:11,670 --> 02:44:16,709
Just this because we want to see if either one of them will eat whipped cream

1040
02:44:21,329 --> 02:44:23,809
I'd appreciate more toppings. Okay, so

1041
02:44:24,530 --> 02:44:26,600
she

1042
02:44:26,600 --> 02:44:31,110
Wants the whipped cream in the cherry, but he does not so we're gonna start with her

1043
02:44:32,870 --> 02:44:35,360
What about sprinkles

1044
02:44:40,229 --> 02:44:42,229
Something on that I don't like

1045
02:44:42,709 --> 02:44:56,360
Some of those toppings are distasteful. Okay, no sprinkles. What about pineapple?

1046
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:06,399
Something on that I don't like I'd appreciate more toppings

1047
02:45:11,399 --> 02:45:17,750
Okay, so you want more than that

1048
02:45:18,709 --> 02:45:24,610
What about that?

1049
02:45:24,610 --> 02:45:26,610
Something must go

1050
02:45:27,280 --> 02:45:30,319
Some of those toppings are distasteful. Okay, so

1051
02:45:30,959 --> 02:45:41,079
We have I got plenty of I got this plenty of space that's gotta be it

1052
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:53,100
Something's wrong, okay, so it has to be mushrooms

1053
02:46:07,459 --> 02:46:09,459
Little pizza makers

1054
02:46:09,940 --> 02:46:12,149
There it is. All right. Good

1055
02:46:12,149 --> 02:46:14,149
So you do not want this

1056
02:46:14,229 --> 02:46:21,200
So we're gonna have to just go and there's no cheese option either. How about just how about we'll just go musk make it easy

1057
02:46:22,819 --> 02:46:25,809
Make it simple

1058
02:46:36,319 --> 02:46:38,319
What does do you just want a sauce pizza

1059
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:48,799
More topping, okay. All right. All right. All right. So let's do

1060
02:46:51,639 --> 02:46:54,309
I think this is gonna be

1061
02:46:54,309 --> 02:46:57,799
Just punch me in the face

1062
02:46:57,799 --> 02:47:01,989
Just punch me in the face. He punched me in the face. Okay

1063
02:47:11,219 --> 02:47:14,159
More toppings

1064
02:47:14,399 --> 02:47:20,209
Oh

1065
02:47:20,209 --> 02:47:25,379
That's all right. Bye. Uh-oh

1066
02:47:26,500 --> 02:47:28,709
Okay

1067
02:47:28,709 --> 02:47:30,709
So you don't like mushrooms

1068
02:47:31,510 --> 02:47:36,959
This is the pizza that you want unless you don't want pineapple, but you want sprinkles on the ice cream

1069
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:53,489
Their stuff I don't like you piece of shit. He's gonna kill somebody else. He's gonna kill another

1070
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:00,100
Shit. All right. Well, we did it

1071
02:48:04,389 --> 02:48:08,389
Thank you. Thank you. It's all good

1072
02:48:22,629 --> 02:48:27,489
We lost two but that's we'll be fine

1073
02:48:32,360 --> 02:48:34,360
That was challenging

1074
02:48:34,600 --> 02:48:39,959
But you did it. You are a bright one. Oh shit. We can't go any we can't go forward

1075
02:48:42,799 --> 02:48:46,209
We have to store everybody I can't move forward without 16

1076
02:48:55,399 --> 02:49:08,979
Yeah, we gotta go back I can see how you shaped your personality. Yeah

1077
02:49:13,719 --> 02:49:24,680
What is this freakish little game? That's a weird way to put it

1078
02:49:35,959 --> 02:49:43,639
All right, let's go

1079
02:49:43,639 --> 02:49:49,719
How about here?

1080
02:49:50,040 --> 02:49:56,049
Is it glasses or I mean these are pretty much the same let's try glasses

1081
02:49:57,399 --> 02:49:59,399
Nope

1082
02:49:59,799 --> 02:50:01,799
It's probably hair or feet

1083
02:50:02,440 --> 02:50:14,770
Try hair. Well could be either one. Let's try feet. Okay, I think that's correct

1084
02:50:19,670 --> 02:50:20,549
Oh

1085
02:50:20,549 --> 02:50:26,479
Maybe it is hair

1086
02:50:29,459 --> 02:50:33,360
So, okay, it's hair is it hair though all the same shoes

1087
02:50:35,540 --> 02:50:47,520
Slow down slow down slow down slow down. I'm good. I got it. Okay

1088
02:51:06,049 --> 02:51:08,049
Okay, I hope I don't get this wrong because

1089
02:51:09,569 --> 02:51:22,629
Did you add that as an emote? That's fine. All right, you've done quite well

1090
02:51:30,600 --> 02:51:35,079
These stone guards have their rules so do proceed with skill

1091
02:51:37,479 --> 02:51:39,159
They're blue

1092
02:51:39,159 --> 02:51:45,680
What's the point of the game is to try to get as many zumbinis to the zumbini ville town without losing any of them

1093
02:51:46,629 --> 02:51:49,059
But you will

1094
02:51:51,319 --> 02:52:07,239
Chosen few let's go pink noses this way see if it works. Uh-huh blue. All right blue noses

1095
02:52:10,819 --> 02:52:12,819
one of the chosen

1096
02:52:12,979 --> 02:52:14,979
What about green noses this way?

1097
02:52:21,399 --> 02:52:28,069
All right, what about this way not all doors are open to you

1098
02:52:34,159 --> 02:52:37,600
This is almost the exact same character. So, uh

1099
02:52:38,399 --> 02:52:47,120
Let's just assume that this is gonna get through assume this one will get through as well. No

1100
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,629
Those eyes away you go

1101
02:52:51,799 --> 02:52:57,059
It's not hair. It's not feet. It's not nose. It's eyes. Okay

1102
02:53:03,010 --> 02:53:04,450
Step right up

1103
02:53:04,450 --> 02:53:06,690
Any more glasses up this way?

1104
02:53:07,239 --> 02:53:08,840
Okay by me

1105
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:10,280
Do go in

1106
02:53:10,280 --> 02:53:13,750
Okay

1107
02:53:13,750 --> 02:53:19,799
Step in why is this one over here? Oh blue nose, right? The blue nose does it?

1108
02:53:25,010 --> 02:53:36,659
Okay, I think they all just go this way. Yeah, we're good

1109
02:53:42,340 --> 02:53:48,649
Glad to drop in don't mess up the pizza stuff now

1110
02:54:05,190 --> 02:54:07,190
Make me a pizza

1111
02:54:08,450 --> 02:54:10,450
All right, same deal. We're gonna go just

1112
02:54:10,450 --> 02:54:12,450
like this

1113
02:54:19,139 --> 02:54:22,579
Some of those toppings are distasteful. They both don't like pineapple

1114
02:54:23,620 --> 02:54:25,700
They're both hyper intelligent beings

1115
02:54:26,399 --> 02:54:31,190
Hyper intelligence. All right, what about this?

1116
02:54:38,549 --> 02:54:44,879
Okay, there's something there I hate oh good. All right, so you both don't want that

1117
02:54:44,879 --> 02:54:47,440
So what about sprinkles and then we're gonna then we'll go forward from there

1118
02:54:48,319 --> 02:54:55,059
There's stuff on that. I don't like

1119
02:54:56,680 --> 02:55:00,600
More toppings. All right, so we gotta we're gonna do hers. Okay, here we go

1120
02:55:02,559 --> 02:55:06,709
So you both don't want pineapple? How about sprinkle and

1121
02:55:08,870 --> 02:55:12,899
Maybe she'll just want it

1122
02:55:19,430 --> 02:55:23,780
Okay, so you don't like any of this shit

1123
02:55:30,229 --> 02:55:39,920
Something on that I don't like do you want a plain pizza possible? Sometimes it happens

1124
02:55:50,840 --> 02:55:57,889
You might just want a plain sauce pizza well find out right now

1125
02:56:06,850 --> 02:56:08,850
And nobody had to die

1126
02:56:18,559 --> 02:56:24,950
Is it why are you moaning in the background? Where do you hear that?

1127
02:56:25,190 --> 02:56:27,190
Is that you

1128
02:56:30,760 --> 02:56:32,920
That was challenging

1129
02:56:32,920 --> 02:56:36,680
But you did it. You are a bright one

1130
02:56:37,399 --> 02:56:39,399
Yes, you are

1131
02:56:39,719 --> 02:56:41,719
I'm not going up until I have to

1132
02:56:47,649 --> 02:56:54,469
There's no this one might be my favorite game besides the pizza one

1133
02:56:56,159 --> 02:56:58,559
This is my favorite non pizza related minigame

1134
02:57:07,729 --> 02:57:09,729
any of these match

1135
02:57:09,729 --> 02:57:16,450
All right, so it's a green nose and that's it. So we single out the green noses

1136
02:57:17,409 --> 02:57:19,409
And this one looks very different

1137
02:57:28,500 --> 02:57:31,299
So it's the green nose this hair

1138
02:57:32,899 --> 02:57:37,059
and pink shoes green nose this hair

1139
02:57:38,020 --> 02:57:40,020
And this is it right here. No, it's not

1140
02:57:40,260 --> 02:57:42,260
Yes, it is

1141
02:57:53,299 --> 02:57:59,459
Breaking news germa's favorite non pizza related minigame revealed. I got deleted by nightbot. Sorry

1142
02:58:00,760 --> 02:58:04,120
You used too many capital letters. I think all right

1143
02:58:04,120 --> 02:58:07,670
Okay

1144
02:58:07,670 --> 02:58:14,629
So green nose

1145
02:58:14,629 --> 02:58:19,430
Different hair though this one

1146
02:58:20,229 --> 02:58:23,479
No

1147
02:58:23,479 --> 02:58:29,430
So it's pink shoes and green nose

1148
02:58:29,989 --> 02:58:34,020
this one

1149
02:58:34,739 --> 02:58:41,239
That is really loud for me. Hopefully it's not loud for you

1150
02:58:42,120 --> 02:58:54,790
This entire game is food mode

1151
02:58:56,040 --> 02:58:58,040
Yeah, that's fine

1152
02:58:58,040 --> 02:59:07,459
Let's just go for shoes

1153
02:59:07,459 --> 02:59:09,059
No

1154
02:59:09,059 --> 02:59:12,209
Is it glasses?

1155
02:59:12,209 --> 02:59:15,489
It might be nose or glasses. Let's try glasses with a different color nose

1156
02:59:16,530 --> 02:59:17,569
Oh

1157
02:59:17,569 --> 02:59:26,770
It's noses always do noses first. What the hell am I doing? Am I dumb? Am I am I dumb?

1158
02:59:27,090 --> 02:59:40,680
Why would I not start with noses? I love this song

1159
03:00:06,709 --> 03:00:10,069
Hey, you're ready to snooze dream a little dream

1160
03:00:15,360 --> 03:00:17,360
Gonna play final fantasy 16

1161
03:00:17,520 --> 03:00:21,459
I can tell you the answer to that question is yes

1162
03:00:22,180 --> 03:00:26,840
I'm gonna play it at launch and and guess what?

1163
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:36,469
I'll be sponsored to play again. Let's fucking go

1164
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:58,239
You love saying let's go no, I just think saying let's go makes me

1165
03:00:59,059 --> 03:01:02,709
More relatable. So I try to throw it in there every now and again

1166
03:01:03,510 --> 03:01:18,020
Is it working red?

1167
03:01:18,819 --> 03:01:23,940
uh triangle

1168
03:01:24,420 --> 03:01:32,559
Can you say let's go zoom beanie gang that is like a youtube video

1169
03:01:33,120 --> 03:01:39,059
I'm gonna do like a tuba intro. I could if you wanted to see

1170
03:01:39,620 --> 03:01:47,520
I just got this incredible urge for tabasco habanero sauce

1171
03:01:48,079 --> 03:01:50,079
Just I had this

1172
03:01:50,139 --> 03:01:57,079
Immediate urge to just eat it. It was immediate

1173
03:02:00,930 --> 03:02:03,299
pink circle

1174
03:02:03,379 --> 03:02:05,680
Wait, oh, I thought I clicked circle

1175
03:02:09,889 --> 03:02:11,889
All right circle

1176
03:02:11,969 --> 03:02:19,610
What is it pink star? No, it's pink triangle. No pink square

1177
03:02:28,819 --> 03:02:37,680
How do you pronounce this pico de gallo you can put your head down in shame now because you thought I was gonna say it wrong

1178
03:02:46,469 --> 03:02:48,709
All right blue diamond

1179
03:02:50,069 --> 03:02:51,430
No

1180
03:02:51,430 --> 03:02:53,430
Well blue star

1181
03:02:54,229 --> 03:03:04,770
Good blue circle. Did you want me to do like a hot sauce a hot sauce burn my whole face?

1182
03:03:06,159 --> 03:03:12,309
List. Oh, this one is so hot. You want to do that? I'll do it

1183
03:03:37,079 --> 03:03:39,079
You catch up is too hot for you

1184
03:03:43,329 --> 03:03:45,329
Actually, that's kind of true in a lot of cases

1185
03:03:46,209 --> 03:03:48,209
Ketchup can kind of be a little too much

1186
03:03:48,979 --> 03:03:55,170
Good work. Can you brave the challenges of not spicy but like annoying?

1187
03:03:55,649 --> 03:03:59,649
The new dangers of the mountains of despair

1188
03:04:04,200 --> 03:04:08,920
Not spicy i'm just saying ketchup ketchup can kind of be annoying on food sometimes

1189
03:04:11,479 --> 03:04:13,479
I wouldn't want ketchup on let's say

1190
03:04:14,520 --> 03:04:18,610
I'm trying to think of what like would be kind of geared on

1191
03:04:19,250 --> 03:04:21,809
the little too

1192
03:04:22,690 --> 03:04:28,690
Tangy and acidic strange carvings left. I'd say the same thing about a tabasco sauce

1193
03:04:28,930 --> 03:04:31,170
I wouldn't want that on everything. It's like a little too harsh

1194
03:04:31,889 --> 03:04:45,190
What is this even telling me these hair styles? I think these are hairstyles

1195
03:05:05,989 --> 03:05:11,299
Can you eat a carolina reaper hole on stream for the haters?

1196
03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:17,719
I would want to like

1197
03:05:17,719 --> 03:05:21,719
Eat a bowl of soup for the haters. You understand that that would make the haters happy

1198
03:05:22,440 --> 03:05:27,799
Why would I do that for the haters?

1199
03:05:27,879 --> 03:05:30,920
That would make the haters be very pleased

1200
03:05:32,870 --> 03:05:37,030
The haters would be very unhappy if I was just eating soup on stream and I was like having a good time and normal

1201
03:05:37,350 --> 03:05:42,129
What do you what do you mean for the haters?

1202
03:05:42,129 --> 03:05:44,129
Me being like

1203
03:05:45,569 --> 03:05:50,850
Like on stream is like yeah. Yeah, fuck you. I fucking hate you fucking I hate him like I hope he fucking gets hurt

1204
03:05:51,409 --> 03:06:04,840
I'm waiting for the haters

1205
03:06:05,159 --> 03:06:13,379
When you're gonna eat soup on stream, I don't know never you should stream soup then for the haters

1206
03:06:14,180 --> 03:06:24,549
Okay, I can't tell what hairstyle that is. All right

1207
03:06:34,049 --> 03:06:42,399
What about where where's the soup tier list I want to do the frozen food tier list

1208
03:06:45,719 --> 03:06:49,079
You know what let's just stop talking about it and get a crystal filter

1209
03:06:49,639 --> 03:06:51,639
Let's get it a plan for it

1210
03:06:51,639 --> 03:06:55,239
Here's what I want to do

1211
03:06:55,239 --> 03:07:01,170
I'll talk to the mods and we will get a system where we can figure out what the best

1212
03:07:01,969 --> 03:07:03,809
frozen foods are

1213
03:07:03,809 --> 03:07:06,760
I'll get a bunch of them

1214
03:07:06,760 --> 03:07:17,620
And we'll do it

1215
03:07:17,620 --> 03:07:23,239
We'll talk after the stream get some guys so you can recommend like oh, hey, you gotta get the like the stoffer is

1216
03:07:24,120 --> 03:07:26,120
fucking meat and potatoes meal

1217
03:07:27,280 --> 03:07:45,459
Right, you're never gonna do this. Oh, I will I will like tv dinner. Yeah

1218
03:07:46,260 --> 03:07:48,260
just like frozen meals

1219
03:07:48,659 --> 03:07:51,079
frozen foods

1220
03:07:51,079 --> 03:07:53,399
Maybe like three or four from each major brand

1221
03:07:57,379 --> 03:07:58,420
Okay, here's the thing

1222
03:07:58,420 --> 03:08:03,430
I want to make sure that I can take at least enough from each one

1223
03:08:05,479 --> 03:08:08,680
And to be able to save the rest of it to eat later or if it's gross, you know

1224
03:08:08,680 --> 03:08:33,250
Obviously not gonna keep it. I think frozen meals is where we start. Jimmy Dean breakfast bowl

1225
03:08:34,200 --> 03:08:39,440
Okay

1226
03:08:39,440 --> 03:08:43,489
Fish sticks when you can do the baby food tier list

1227
03:08:44,639 --> 03:08:46,719
Your microwave is going to be working over time

1228
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:56,420
Can you explain this minigame for the haters? Um

1229
03:09:00,559 --> 03:09:02,879
Yeah, that's fine

1230
03:09:02,879 --> 03:09:05,350
so in this game mode

1231
03:09:05,350 --> 03:09:11,430
You have to match the zoom beanie with the one of the mirrors and there are five to six fake zoom beanies up here

1232
03:09:11,750 --> 03:09:16,180
To throw you off. So I have to take one of my zoom beanies

1233
03:09:17,059 --> 03:09:19,200
and

1234
03:09:19,200 --> 03:09:42,559
Match it to this one. I can't like do this

1235
03:09:43,520 --> 03:10:07,959
Why am I having so much trouble with this? Oh, I don't know this one. I don't know whether it's getting an exist up there

1236
03:10:08,920 --> 03:10:24,950
a lot of pink shoes

1237
03:10:24,950 --> 03:10:33,840
You seem to be really bad at bottle flipping

1238
03:10:34,639 --> 03:10:54,790
Yeah, I am. I don't actually I never even tried it. I might be good at it. I've never tried do a bottle flipping stream

1239
03:10:58,639 --> 03:11:06,200
Is this game an analogy for children's journey through life to reach god in eternal paradise?

1240
03:11:10,079 --> 03:11:13,040
um

1241
03:11:13,040 --> 03:11:17,680
Media you can interpret. Oh, you know certain ways. How have you, you know feel like you interpret the media?

1242
03:11:19,170 --> 03:11:21,170
I interpret this as

1243
03:11:21,489 --> 03:11:29,920
the struggle to relocate

1244
03:11:29,920 --> 03:11:36,799
the hardships that come with relocating

1245
03:11:42,760 --> 03:11:44,280
and man's

1246
03:11:44,280 --> 03:11:46,520
constant struggle

1247
03:11:46,520 --> 03:11:49,319
With who we are and what we're what we're doing on this planet

1248
03:12:04,069 --> 03:12:09,520
And our ability as humans to overcome anything

1249
03:12:12,610 --> 03:12:14,610
That's what I think it is. That's how I believe it is

1250
03:12:25,590 --> 03:12:27,110
No, it's not

1251
03:12:27,110 --> 03:12:31,829
Just a fun game for kids about matching puzzles

1252
03:12:40,629 --> 03:12:53,760
Dope you got that from chat gpt

1253
03:12:57,079 --> 03:13:00,120
Does chat gpt even know who the zoom beanies are?

1254
03:13:00,920 --> 03:13:11,989
You should ask it

1255
03:13:11,989 --> 03:13:14,469
I've never used chat gpt. I just hear about it

1256
03:13:15,270 --> 03:13:32,520
Do you want to know the fastest way to make me never do anything have the thing?

1257
03:13:33,479 --> 03:13:34,600
that

1258
03:13:34,600 --> 03:13:38,760
Is something that to use have any kind of account sign up beforehand?

1259
03:13:39,799 --> 03:13:41,479
And I just won't use it

1260
03:13:41,479 --> 03:13:48,739
Ever the zoom beanies are a fictional group of small blue creatures who star in a series of educational puzzle games

1261
03:13:49,139 --> 03:13:52,020
First game logical journey of the zoom beanies. Okay. Well, they know

1262
03:13:52,819 --> 03:13:54,819
It's just a search thing, isn't it?

1263
03:14:07,959 --> 03:14:12,680
It's not just a search thing. Well, I mean if you okay if you type into chat gpt, what are the zoom beanies?

1264
03:14:13,079 --> 03:14:15,319
It's going to find it. It's going to figure it out

1265
03:14:16,020 --> 03:14:23,639
You didn't write what are the zoom beanies favorite foods or like how do we stop the zoom beanies or?

1266
03:14:24,280 --> 03:14:26,280
That's you're asking it a very simple question

1267
03:14:44,370 --> 03:14:59,799
You stop by not playing you killed one what no I didn't

1268
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:03,000
Oh shit, I killed one

1269
03:15:03,079 --> 03:15:05,819
I wasn't paying attention. I wasn't paying attention

1270
03:15:10,920 --> 03:15:13,399
I was looking over at chat. I was talking to you guys

1271
03:15:14,280 --> 03:15:27,299
I was talking to you guys. I wasn't even looking at the game. I was just hanging out

1272
03:15:33,270 --> 03:15:39,030
There is no need or reason to stop the zoom beanies as they are fictional characters from a series of education educational games

1273
03:15:39,670 --> 03:15:44,229
Some beanies exist solely within the context of those games and do not pose any real world threat

1274
03:15:46,159 --> 03:15:51,440
However, if you're referring to a specific challenge or obstacle within the zoom beanie games that you're having trouble with

1275
03:15:51,840 --> 03:15:55,360
I'd be happy to help you with strategies or solutions to overcome it

1276
03:15:55,680 --> 03:15:58,319
Just let me know which part you're struggling with and i'll do my best

1277
03:16:14,020 --> 03:16:18,340
All right, how many people there's like 17 000 people here you are training

1278
03:16:19,139 --> 03:16:21,780
You're training the language learning model right now

1279
03:16:22,340 --> 03:16:26,500
People are going to start getting zoom beanie lore in their random fucking generations

1280
03:16:26,579 --> 03:16:34,579
They do chat gpt is just going to think that the zoom beanies are incredibly important and to start putting them in other places

1281
03:16:35,139 --> 03:16:50,049
Well, they are important. So

1282
03:16:50,530 --> 03:17:10,870
I can't believe I killed one. Can you please turn on the mic camera?

1283
03:17:15,700 --> 03:17:22,120
I haven't showered today and i'm naked. So no search first

1284
03:17:23,479 --> 03:17:36,450
All right, let's do this one. This one is got shoes in the mix now

1285
03:17:44,370 --> 03:17:48,530
So if shoes go pink shoes go up this way, they always will bump that way

1286
03:17:49,409 --> 03:17:53,760
And then be safe if pink shoes go this way. They will always go this way

1287
03:17:57,079 --> 03:18:02,360
And then they always die. So if you have pink shoes, you have to go this way. There's no other option

1288
03:18:12,020 --> 03:18:17,059
Wait, yeah, okay. That's right

1289
03:18:17,379 --> 03:19:00,229
Okay, so now what so it doesn't really okay. What about hair?

1290
03:19:01,250 --> 03:19:04,049
So this hair is going to go up this way. It'll go all the way up

1291
03:19:05,479 --> 03:19:06,760
down

1292
03:19:06,760 --> 03:19:09,059
All right, so no matter what

1293
03:19:09,059 --> 03:19:11,219
Hair has to go this way

1294
03:19:11,780 --> 03:19:13,780
Wait, no, everybody dies if they go that way

1295
03:19:14,260 --> 03:19:22,709
They have to alternate so as it stands right now

1296
03:19:23,350 --> 03:19:25,110
This has to go

1297
03:19:25,110 --> 03:19:30,530
This is right. Wait, hold on

1298
03:19:30,530 --> 03:19:33,090
If you have one of these hairs you go up

1299
03:19:35,329 --> 03:19:43,969
Up into the right down up. All right, so hold on. I this i'm gonna fuck this up. I think this is great

1300
03:19:43,969 --> 03:19:45,170
I think this is correct

1301
03:19:45,170 --> 03:19:51,809
Can we play Vinnie in street fighter?

1302
03:19:51,889 --> 03:19:55,409
I mean, it would be an absolute fucking massacre. I don't know. I don't think that's a

1303
03:19:56,290 --> 03:20:05,829
Probably not a good idea

1304
03:20:05,829 --> 03:20:13,139
It would be an absolute massacre. I'm telling him you said that

1305
03:20:15,920 --> 03:20:17,920
I'm talking about me losing

1306
03:20:18,680 --> 03:20:23,319
Before you go tattle tail on me really

1307
03:20:27,319 --> 03:20:31,280
Wow, okay

1308
03:20:31,280 --> 03:20:35,680
All right. So now I have to go up right down up. Okay, so if I put

1309
03:20:36,239 --> 03:20:38,579
this person with his hair

1310
03:20:38,579 --> 03:20:39,940
that's correct

1311
03:20:39,940 --> 03:20:41,940
and we do the

1312
03:20:41,940 --> 03:20:46,530
This hair and this should be fine, right? I believe that's correct

1313
03:20:47,010 --> 03:20:51,940
Let's love to worry about this

1314
03:20:51,940 --> 03:20:53,299
so now

1315
03:20:53,299 --> 03:20:59,729
Okay, you can go

1316
03:20:59,729 --> 03:21:05,030
and then

1317
03:21:05,030 --> 03:21:19,940
I think I fucked it up

1318
03:21:19,940 --> 03:21:30,440
No, I got it

1319
03:21:30,440 --> 03:21:36,149
Game sounds are too loud. It might be one guy, but i'll do it. Is it a one guy?

1320
03:21:36,629 --> 03:22:05,719
I turned it down a little bit. Are you slippery on a milkshake? I wish

1321
03:22:16,659 --> 03:22:29,459
You're wearing a star wars shirt today. No, not today. Can we get to a hundred zoom beanies in zoom beanieville?

1322
03:22:30,420 --> 03:22:48,479
We're definitely gonna get to a hundred there's no way we won't oh what's this swimming pool

1323
03:22:49,280 --> 03:23:03,649
They got a pool now

1324
03:23:03,649 --> 03:23:23,959
Okay, things have gotten harder this way. There's 60 here. Okay. Let me ask you

1325
03:23:24,360 --> 03:23:27,000
Should we continue to do just the journey and bring more people?

1326
03:23:27,479 --> 03:23:30,440
Or do you want to see how hard this game is because we've been playing it for three hours

1327
03:23:30,760 --> 03:23:41,079
What do you think let's get a pull-up you want to do the hard stuff and we'll play some hard minigames and then

1328
03:23:41,639 --> 03:23:55,379
See where we are journey or go to hard i'm seeing a lot of hard

1329
03:23:55,780 --> 03:24:07,430
Yeah, this is actually almost impossible for me on some of these you wouldn't last a day on hard

1330
03:24:07,590 --> 03:24:15,280
I know I I won't they're actually really hard. All right, so we'll let's do

1331
03:24:16,180 --> 03:24:21,219
Very very hard for pizza because everyone wants to see that. Let's go

1332
03:24:29,649 --> 03:24:31,889
So there are three

1333
03:24:31,969 --> 03:24:38,870
You won't last a minute playing this game on hard

1334
03:24:42,000 --> 03:24:43,620
That's not what you said

1335
03:24:43,620 --> 03:24:49,510
Oops, okay. So

1336
03:24:51,719 --> 03:24:53,719
We already have some things they don't like

1337
03:24:55,000 --> 03:25:03,399
I don't know if it's cheese sometimes hard to tell so somebody doesn't like mushrooms

1338
03:25:04,260 --> 03:25:10,479
Sprinkles or cheese i'm gonna go pineapple plain

1339
03:25:11,440 --> 03:25:16,629
go

1340
03:25:19,319 --> 03:25:21,319
I'd appreciate more toppings. Okay

1341
03:25:23,559 --> 03:25:28,549
All right, so let's work on hers so we got pineapple

1342
03:25:29,409 --> 03:25:32,610
And cheese is that is that good?

1343
03:25:41,639 --> 03:25:45,159
Getting there gee I wasn't expecting that one

1344
03:25:52,229 --> 03:25:54,229
So they all don't like sprinkles apparently

1345
03:25:55,159 --> 03:25:57,159
Because she likes cheese

1346
03:26:01,280 --> 03:26:08,040
So she doesn't want sprinkles. What about a cherry?

1347
03:26:21,239 --> 03:26:24,680
All right expecting that one so you all right

1348
03:26:26,920 --> 03:26:30,950
All right. All right

1349
03:26:31,430 --> 03:26:39,299
It's not pepperoni it could be mushrooms

1350
03:26:52,610 --> 03:26:54,610
Little pizza makers

1351
03:26:59,239 --> 03:27:01,090
So

1352
03:27:01,090 --> 03:27:04,530
What do they actually want? Let's just go chocolate sauce

1353
03:27:09,719 --> 03:27:11,719
more toppings start

1354
03:27:11,959 --> 03:27:12,760
Oh

1355
03:27:12,760 --> 03:27:15,799
Something's wrong. Okay. Well, I don't care. I got one

1356
03:27:21,569 --> 03:27:23,329
Okay, so

1357
03:27:23,329 --> 03:27:35,510
I don't he didn't like cheese did he doesn't want pepperoni doesn't want sprinkles. He didn't like the pineapple

1358
03:27:35,590 --> 03:27:39,350
Okay. Wait, what about the mushrooms down here? What about cheese and mushrooms and shit?

1359
03:27:42,959 --> 03:27:48,450
Didn't he not like cheese?

1360
03:27:48,610 --> 03:28:01,280
No, he didn't like cheese something on that's not good for me. Okay. I don't think he likes cheese

1361
03:28:08,079 --> 03:28:14,450
That's gonna be it

1362
03:28:15,010 --> 03:28:17,250
What?

1363
03:28:24,819 --> 03:28:34,200
What the hell do you want do you just what something's wrong

1364
03:28:34,280 --> 03:28:36,420
Wrong

1365
03:28:36,420 --> 03:28:38,420
Do you just want a cherry?

1366
03:28:38,579 --> 03:28:44,719
This is a fucked up meal

1367
03:28:47,120 --> 03:28:50,000
Well, maybe not. I actually think a tomato based pie. No

1368
03:28:50,719 --> 03:28:55,569
Something on that's not good for me. What does he want?

1369
03:29:05,059 --> 03:29:14,559
Doesn't want cherry doesn't like peppers doesn't like mushrooms doesn't want cheese. Is it pineapple? Didn't he say?

1370
03:29:15,520 --> 03:29:19,829
Yuck. No, he doesn't like anything. Maybe it's just cheese

1371
03:29:31,010 --> 03:29:32,290
Oh

1372
03:29:32,290 --> 03:29:39,329
Kill the log

1373
03:29:39,329 --> 03:29:45,200
All right. So you want pepperoni and chocolate sauce? That should be it

1374
03:29:46,979 --> 03:29:50,760
Yep

1375
03:29:52,069 --> 03:30:02,120
I've no idea what this guy wants. I don't think he wants any ice cream stuff

1376
03:30:11,079 --> 03:30:13,319
Let's check it

1377
03:30:13,319 --> 03:30:23,590
I have three or I feel like four more more please. Okay, you want sprinkles. Why do you uh,

1378
03:30:24,149 --> 03:30:32,079
Hey you that you liked it. That was a that was a happy punch to the face. Okay, whatever

1379
03:30:37,489 --> 03:30:39,489
No cheese. I don't think he wants cheese

1380
03:30:39,489 --> 03:30:46,870
Sprinkles and cheese is here and it's down here. No mushrooms either sprinkles and mushrooms and he's like get that shit out of here

1381
03:30:47,680 --> 03:30:53,889
So what about um pepperoni?

1382
03:31:00,790 --> 03:31:03,750
Gee, I wasn't expecting that one

1383
03:31:17,139 --> 03:31:19,319
Thank you, yes

1384
03:31:26,959 --> 03:31:32,930
Oh that one on the right was pretty doughy that one on the right did not look very good

1385
03:31:41,440 --> 03:31:43,409
Cool. All right

1386
03:31:43,409 --> 03:31:55,959
So, can I show you how hard this is on very hard? I don't even know why I don't know what this is

1387
03:32:00,739 --> 03:32:02,739
Okay, so because there's

1388
03:32:13,680 --> 03:32:15,489
uh

1389
03:32:15,489 --> 03:32:18,440
All right pac-man. No

1390
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:24,719
Pac-man. No pac-man has nothing this

1391
03:32:25,440 --> 03:32:27,440
Can go down down

1392
03:32:28,100 --> 03:32:36,610
No, nothing. This can go. No, nothing. It's gonna go right. Nothing

1393
03:32:38,290 --> 03:32:42,639
This can go nothing

1394
03:32:42,639 --> 03:32:43,600
uh

1395
03:32:43,600 --> 03:32:46,420
This can go blue

1396
03:32:47,299 --> 03:32:50,979
Um

1397
03:32:50,979 --> 03:32:53,299
Wait, they're changing them. Do you see what's happening?

1398
03:32:53,860 --> 03:33:02,629
What see how fucked up this is look at what's happening. This is uh, I don't I can't even do it

1399
03:33:02,709 --> 03:33:16,610
I can't do it use the magic wand to do what I have to go really fast

1400
03:33:17,399 --> 03:33:21,350
I can't I can't look at it. I actually can't look at it. Watch this one

1401
03:33:23,840 --> 03:33:29,969
Those of you that thought this was a kid's game. Good luck because uh

1402
03:33:31,590 --> 03:33:38,180
Okay, let's try to get one person across so if this one goes up

1403
03:33:38,500 --> 03:33:44,549
It's gonna go up. I don't know what this is. We have to test it. What does this do?

1404
03:33:45,110 --> 03:33:55,219
Is it a teleporter?

1405
03:33:55,219 --> 03:33:57,219
No, it freezes them in place

1406
03:33:59,239 --> 03:34:03,479
So this is gonna go up and then a red I need another red nose to bump

1407
03:34:15,799 --> 03:34:23,159
Why would anybody get sent up here?

1408
03:34:23,159 --> 03:34:26,920
Uh

1409
03:34:26,920 --> 03:34:42,200
Wait, what? Okay. If I go everybody has to go this way. Oh, wait a minute. I can bump you this way

1410
03:34:45,510 --> 03:34:55,459
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, no. Um, oh, there's another path to wait

1411
03:34:57,399 --> 03:35:20,079
What i'm not gonna be able to do it. I don't I don't think I can do it. It's too hard

1412
03:35:20,319 --> 03:35:27,940
It's not even too hard. It's just too much my brain to look at I have to get one person over there

1413
03:35:28,260 --> 03:35:40,819
How do we even go this way? I think this is just death for every single character

1414
03:35:41,139 --> 03:36:00,799
I mean not really how to because that's changing this to go that way

1415
03:36:02,579 --> 03:36:17,969
Now this one wants to go up if it goes up. It'll hit the green marker hit the green and then it's stuck here

1416
03:36:18,610 --> 03:36:24,260
This made this one turn right so this one now is gonna go right right if you have one eye

1417
03:36:24,819 --> 03:36:29,399
Which will make you go this way then up got it

1418
03:36:30,040 --> 03:36:32,239
We're gonna save at least one person

1419
03:36:32,239 --> 03:37:02,340
Because now I can focus on the green and glasses. I can't I don't want to look at it anymore. Check this one out

1420
03:37:07,329 --> 03:37:14,850
I actually really like this one. This one is fun to do. So let's go. Let's just start blue square blue interior

1421
03:37:19,010 --> 03:37:19,969
blue

1422
03:37:19,969 --> 03:37:26,040
Square red interior blue yellow interior

1423
03:37:28,799 --> 03:37:30,920
all right, so what

1424
03:37:30,920 --> 03:37:58,520
Does this mean this is yellow internal square is up here red internal square is here red internal square with blue

1425
03:38:00,520 --> 03:38:01,959
with a star

1426
03:38:01,959 --> 03:38:03,959
Oh, that was so completely wrong

1427
03:38:07,040 --> 03:38:11,329
triangle

1428
03:38:11,329 --> 03:38:20,129
Each one of these is it's okay. Hold on. So it will be green with a square. Okay

1429
03:38:23,809 --> 03:38:26,159
the square

1430
03:38:26,239 --> 03:38:37,159
Red interior square triangle. No shit. It's not a red interior square

1431
03:38:41,200 --> 03:38:44,370
pink

1432
03:38:44,370 --> 03:38:46,370
red interior square

1433
03:38:46,829 --> 03:39:00,209
Yellow

1434
03:39:00,209 --> 03:39:08,520
Get this guy some lithium. Remember we don't get this game. Let me help you

1435
03:39:09,670 --> 03:39:15,270
So I have to pick a color the color is corresponding to a space on this board

1436
03:39:15,989 --> 03:39:20,549
The square the shape is corresponding to a space on this board. You get it

1437
03:39:25,040 --> 03:39:27,520
So all red interior

1438
03:39:28,260 --> 03:39:34,260
Shapes are this row you see what's happening all blue

1439
03:39:34,799 --> 03:39:40,850
Interior shapes are on this row all yellow interior shapes are on this row

1440
03:39:44,440 --> 03:39:50,549
So to get this it is a red interior shape. We have not seen circle

1441
03:39:51,110 --> 03:39:52,930
So let's try it

1442
03:39:52,930 --> 03:39:55,250
Okay

1443
03:39:55,250 --> 03:39:57,889
So this is a circle. This is a circle with a green

1444
03:39:58,670 --> 03:40:06,799
exterior

1445
03:40:06,799 --> 03:40:08,799
You couldn't possibly know that I do

1446
03:40:09,200 --> 03:40:14,389
So the problem is not knowing

1447
03:40:14,790 --> 03:40:16,479
what

1448
03:40:16,479 --> 03:40:19,200
Interior color this is i'm gonna say pink

1449
03:40:21,440 --> 03:40:37,409
Okay, i'm almost out of power. Fuck you. Why is that over there?

1450
03:40:42,079 --> 03:40:43,920
Fuck you. What?

1451
03:40:43,920 --> 03:41:01,329
I want let me restart. Let me restart. I'm going to try again. What are you gonna do et atari?

1452
03:41:04,280 --> 03:41:21,799
I don't know. We have to get a center. So this is interior yellow triangle interior pink triangle

1453
03:41:28,620 --> 03:41:30,450
interior

1454
03:41:30,450 --> 03:41:31,969
pink triangle

1455
03:41:32,049 --> 03:41:34,389
red

1456
03:41:34,389 --> 03:41:36,389
interior pink triangle green

1457
03:41:38,389 --> 03:41:41,379
interior

1458
03:41:41,379 --> 03:41:46,690
pineapple

1459
03:41:46,690 --> 03:41:50,610
interior pink triangle yellow outside

1460
03:41:52,079 --> 03:41:57,879
star

1461
03:41:57,879 --> 03:42:00,360
Interior pink triangle yellow outside

1462
03:42:10,760 --> 03:42:27,079
Wait, i'm confusing myself. I just had it. I just hold on. I had it restart. Okay

1463
03:42:35,969 --> 03:42:52,309
Okay, the rules change every time you restart. Are you serious? Oh fuck. Okay, that's why I was screwed

1464
03:42:52,389 --> 03:42:59,440
All right. All right. All right. I'll get it. I'll get it. I get it pink interior

1465
03:43:00,520 --> 03:43:05,219
Red triangle red interior red triangle

1466
03:43:06,100 --> 03:43:10,520
Looks like it goes this way blue interior

1467
03:43:12,040 --> 03:43:14,040
Okay, good guy

1468
03:43:14,280 --> 03:43:22,850
Here we go. So that means that this is red. Would this be all red?

1469
03:43:24,340 --> 03:43:27,790
exterior red exterior

1470
03:43:28,370 --> 03:43:29,889
red

1471
03:43:29,889 --> 03:43:32,239
star

1472
03:43:32,239 --> 03:43:40,159
shit

1473
03:43:40,159 --> 03:43:41,440
Wait, what?

1474
03:43:41,440 --> 03:43:57,909
Why would that not be in here?

1475
03:43:57,909 --> 03:44:01,360
Exterior is the columns. So what about blue?

1476
03:44:02,319 --> 03:44:06,629
I dude I had it I had it and I just like fucked it all up

1477
03:44:07,399 --> 03:44:12,309
Interior is the line this time shit. I like okay

1478
03:44:12,389 --> 03:44:17,079
You know when you when you have something in your brain and then you you think about it more than once

1479
03:44:17,479 --> 03:44:22,979
And then it just completely disappears and it's as if you've never played it before it's just gone

1480
03:44:23,459 --> 03:44:29,090
Just it's gone like oh pink interior a red exterior shape

1481
03:44:29,809 --> 03:44:52,709
Is in this column in this row. Well, i'll try it again one more time. It was a good guess

1482
03:44:57,079 --> 03:45:00,280
So they're both squares they're both blue exteriors

1483
03:45:00,920 --> 03:45:03,319
The only difference is their interior is a different color

1484
03:45:03,879 --> 03:45:10,790
So what does that mean? Why is that on a different? Why is this in a different spot? I'm going to try something here

1485
03:45:11,700 --> 03:45:13,700
What is blue exterior?

1486
03:45:14,469 --> 03:45:16,899
square

1487
03:45:16,899 --> 03:45:38,950
Green interior. Oh, yeah, so all squares are here in this zone

1488
03:45:41,200 --> 03:45:43,200
all squares

1489
03:45:43,200 --> 03:45:45,000
In this zone

1490
03:45:45,000 --> 03:45:58,520
No, all blue exterior is this zone wait that might be right i'll test it one more time

1491
03:46:02,260 --> 03:46:05,799
Okay

1492
03:46:05,799 --> 03:46:11,139
So i'm imagining this is all green. This is all blue. This is all red. So this is all blue

1493
03:46:12,530 --> 03:46:13,809
blue

1494
03:46:13,809 --> 03:46:20,239
Interior no shit. Don't nobody stop talking. Hold on. Wait, this is oh i've had it. I lost it. Where's it?

1495
03:46:20,870 --> 03:46:32,370
This is blue. Yeah, i'm losing it. Stop just sit down for a second blue interior blue exterior blue interior

1496
03:46:32,850 --> 03:46:35,889
Is this so this is not star. Let's try circle

1497
03:46:45,569 --> 03:46:53,120
What this is all blue interior?

1498
03:46:54,680 --> 03:46:57,559
What diamond god damn it

1499
03:47:00,979 --> 03:47:04,049
star

1500
03:47:04,049 --> 03:47:13,729
All right. I got it now. I actually I have the pattern. I have the pattern so this means this is this is blue exterior

1501
03:47:16,840 --> 03:47:17,799
Okay

1502
03:47:17,799 --> 03:47:27,440
Blue exterior. It's not green, but it's a square. I guess we'll try pink

1503
03:47:29,190 --> 03:47:31,590
What i'm so confused. No

1504
03:47:32,319 --> 03:47:33,680
Okay, it's

1505
03:47:33,680 --> 03:47:40,469
Green that it has no the yellow interior

1506
03:47:41,780 --> 03:47:43,540
no

1507
03:47:43,540 --> 03:47:45,809
What the hell is this?

1508
03:47:45,809 --> 03:47:50,950
yellow

1509
03:47:50,950 --> 03:47:53,030
square

1510
03:47:53,030 --> 03:48:02,000
Okay, this is a the shapes don't match up. So this is a yellow interior

1511
03:48:03,200 --> 03:48:11,520
It's what that does not match up though

1512
03:48:13,959 --> 03:48:20,309
All right. Good luck trying to figure out the rest of this shit. It's not fucking hard

1513
03:48:21,940 --> 03:48:23,780
It's not hard

1514
03:48:23,780 --> 03:48:34,840
Jerma, it's called a pattern. I just got to recognize it and figure it out

1515
03:48:35,520 --> 03:48:40,149
And it's not even really a pattern because look at this like these shapes are not even in the right order here

1516
03:48:41,090 --> 03:48:49,829
This should be a square. This is not this is completely different in each row. So sit down relax

1517
03:48:50,309 --> 03:49:16,069
Hey, sit down. It's going diagonally. You spoken crack. All right, so let's drive red

1518
03:49:16,870 --> 03:49:18,790
Let's see where this goes

1519
03:49:18,790 --> 03:49:20,659
Okay

1520
03:49:20,659 --> 03:49:25,079
Red so I need red exterior

1521
03:49:27,389 --> 03:49:28,530
square

1522
03:49:28,530 --> 03:49:46,260
Is here with a blue interior circle

1523
03:49:51,040 --> 03:49:59,829
I do blue interior. What does it go? Where does this go? Is it going to be?

1524
03:50:06,399 --> 03:50:11,090
All right. So this is this matches so it does match

1525
03:50:13,200 --> 03:50:20,049
I didn't know if it was going to be scrambled in every single one of these quadrants. Okay, so go diagonal

1526
03:50:24,149 --> 03:50:29,379
So this is a no no, this is not I do this

1527
03:50:31,250 --> 03:50:33,250
the red exterior

1528
03:50:34,069 --> 03:50:37,809
shit

1529
03:50:37,809 --> 03:50:39,809
A red triangle then

1530
03:50:39,809 --> 03:50:41,809
Okay, so red triangle will do that

1531
03:50:42,209 --> 03:50:56,920
Can I have the controller you can download the game?

1532
03:51:02,469 --> 03:51:07,120
I'm sorry. I'm already out of juice. I might accidentally get like two of these. Let's see

1533
03:51:11,010 --> 03:51:17,409
So I don't know what the leftmost thing is. Okay, so hold on. What is that? I have not figured that out

1534
03:51:17,809 --> 03:51:26,040
What is this one? I have not figured that out. This is a square. So this is a square. It is a

1535
03:51:27,090 --> 03:51:35,250
Interior blue square and the color is we don't have any idea

1536
03:51:45,569 --> 03:51:49,299
green

1537
03:51:49,299 --> 03:51:52,850
What is here?

1538
03:51:52,850 --> 03:51:54,290
It has to be

1539
03:51:54,290 --> 03:52:01,379
You don't have any mud left. No

1540
03:52:02,100 --> 03:52:04,100
Okay, so green exterior

1541
03:52:07,510 --> 03:52:11,760
No, I want to do

1542
03:52:11,760 --> 03:52:16,180
Circle what color inside red?

1543
03:52:19,250 --> 03:52:27,719
Yep, i'm out of juice. I stopped paying attention to the puzzle. I feel so lost

1544
03:52:31,200 --> 03:52:37,649
Is there another shot left? I'm able to get the last at least two people. I got one shot left

1545
03:52:37,889 --> 03:52:44,120
All right, so this is either yellow or pink. Oh, no, I lose

1546
03:52:51,860 --> 03:52:52,899
Okay

1547
03:52:52,899 --> 03:52:55,590
Check this one out on hard

1548
03:52:58,579 --> 03:53:10,069
We're going on tour, but thanks to you good luck. This place has grown can't drop down right now

1549
03:53:10,149 --> 03:53:18,309
But a half it's better than having none. Okay, I don't I don't even I don't know what they want me to do

1550
03:53:21,040 --> 03:53:24,309
But i'm gonna just put people in places

1551
03:53:28,319 --> 03:53:38,819
This shouldn't even be that hard. What about noses? But can't I just put everybody in an individual room?

1552
03:53:40,229 --> 03:54:03,159
There are more doors than zumbinis. They have to go in a specific spot green noses the door pattern

1553
03:54:05,010 --> 03:54:15,399
mmm door pattern and the floor pattern so that would be

1554
03:54:16,129 --> 03:54:46,450
Uh to make me cry if I was playing this by myself. I don't I just genuinely don't really know

1555
03:54:54,360 --> 03:55:12,069
And I I already lost right springs. Um, well at least one person survived

1556
03:55:18,450 --> 03:55:24,420
Somebody said this one feels legit impossible. I don't think it is. I think but maybe it is

1557
03:55:24,420 --> 03:55:29,409
I don't know. Let's do the fleeing one. Let's see how much different difficult this one is

1558
03:55:31,879 --> 03:55:33,879
Because how much harder could you possibly make this one?

1559
03:55:37,479 --> 03:55:47,559
It might be opposites

1560
03:55:47,559 --> 03:55:53,200
All right, so let's just go by what we know the hair is all this stuff is wrong

1561
03:55:53,920 --> 03:56:07,959
None of this matches. Let's just put another random person that it has nothing in common with you. Okay

1562
03:56:08,520 --> 03:56:24,309
Do the glasses match?

1563
03:56:24,309 --> 03:56:30,709
Pink nose. Okay. Hold on. So red nose is purple nose. Maybe red nose and glasses. Do I have one?

1564
03:56:34,979 --> 03:56:36,979
I don't have a red nose and glasses

1565
03:56:37,059 --> 03:56:56,840
What the hell is this criteria spring is high heel bike is also high heel

1566
03:56:59,969 --> 03:57:11,250
Yellow nose is also purple nose as well as red nose. What about you? No you

1567
03:57:11,729 --> 03:57:39,079
Okay, it's the hat one two three hats left. Are there three of these hairs left one two

1568
03:57:39,639 --> 03:57:46,200
Three there is all right

1569
03:57:46,200 --> 03:57:54,479
Um, the glasses are the feet. Oh, that's true

1570
03:57:58,760 --> 03:58:03,379
so glass so eyes are feet so that means that

1571
03:58:05,139 --> 03:58:13,799
Hurts my head eyes are this so cyclops. I will just see what this does

1572
03:58:17,010 --> 03:58:21,040
No

1573
03:58:21,040 --> 03:58:22,799
Okay. Well eyes

1574
03:58:22,799 --> 03:58:28,260
So this is a a cyclops. There's only one cyclops left. It has to be this one

1575
03:58:30,280 --> 03:58:34,799
Right. I think so

1576
03:58:34,799 --> 03:58:45,940
Yep, his feet hair

1577
03:58:48,450 --> 03:58:51,010
Noses eyes eyes his feet hair his nose

1578
03:58:51,649 --> 03:59:03,350
Noses eyes

1579
03:59:03,350 --> 03:59:06,209
What is hair?

1580
03:59:06,209 --> 03:59:20,819
Beat his hair. So it's one of these four. Okay, so feet is

1581
03:59:21,540 --> 03:59:29,170
So it's not this one. Wait, maybe it is this one. It's this one, right?

1582
03:59:32,370 --> 03:59:42,360
Oh fuck

1583
03:59:43,239 --> 03:59:50,559
Yeah, it's that one okay and then it's this one

1584
03:59:51,600 --> 03:59:53,600
All right. Well, okay. That was hard

1585
04:00:03,159 --> 04:00:07,299
Cool. What else do we try very very hard?

1586
04:00:08,389 --> 04:00:10,389
What is this one on very hard?

1587
04:00:11,510 --> 04:00:14,629
Uh, it doesn't tell you you just have to figure it out. All right, let's start with you

1588
04:00:15,750 --> 04:00:18,930
now

1589
04:00:18,930 --> 04:00:20,930
How about um spring?

1590
04:00:25,000 --> 04:00:27,239
What about uh yellow nose and spring?

1591
04:00:27,959 --> 04:00:32,879
It's probably hair

1592
04:00:32,879 --> 04:00:35,360
I think it's hair

1593
04:00:35,360 --> 04:00:38,069
It's not hair

1594
04:00:38,069 --> 04:00:42,120
Is it eyes?

1595
04:00:42,120 --> 04:00:48,610
It's not eyes

1596
04:00:48,610 --> 04:00:52,229
Is it noses?

1597
04:00:52,229 --> 04:01:06,340
What is it? Is it feet? I think it is feet

1598
04:01:07,139 --> 04:01:08,579
Whoa, what?

1599
04:01:08,579 --> 04:01:32,049
What do you mean? Wait, wait, what why did that not happen? What is going on? Oh, they're all locked

1600
04:01:36,280 --> 04:01:48,979
Blue should wait hold because this sorting by multiple traits at once or by feet then eyes, etc. Okay, that's hard

1601
04:01:51,090 --> 04:01:57,879
What about this one? Wait, what?

1602
04:01:58,680 --> 04:02:01,030
Okay

1603
04:02:01,030 --> 04:02:12,680
What are we doing? Uh

1604
04:02:14,469 --> 04:02:20,049
Huh

1605
04:02:20,049 --> 04:02:26,950
They're changing so I have to match this one. I can I have to so I need a spring

1606
04:02:32,120 --> 04:02:33,799
No, I want this to be a spring

1607
04:02:33,799 --> 04:03:01,079
How do I get that to be a spring pass through the ice that matches them? I have to match in the middle

1608
04:03:03,489 --> 04:03:05,569
What the fuck? Okay. Um

1609
04:03:08,979 --> 04:03:13,170
Dude, i'm not doing this one. I don't care

1610
04:03:14,239 --> 04:03:18,069
It's too much

1611
04:03:18,069 --> 04:03:20,850
Uh, what about this one?

1612
04:03:22,440 --> 04:03:24,440
Yikes, no fucking way

1613
04:03:26,079 --> 04:03:37,440
Not a chance i'm doing this one. I'll give it a real try but no I can't I can't even look at it

1614
04:03:40,180 --> 04:03:52,149
Huh? This is not wait. They all have to be connected. I can't do it. What about this one?

1615
04:03:54,520 --> 04:04:00,079
This one might not be that bad

1616
04:04:00,959 --> 04:04:09,079
Okay, so they have to share

1617
04:04:10,920 --> 04:04:12,920
They have to share a trait with

1618
04:04:13,079 --> 04:04:20,680
Somebody that in adjacent to them, right? So you have to go here. This is gonna be a nightmare, but i'll try

1619
04:04:20,680 --> 04:04:33,350
Oh, you got it. They have to share some kind of trait. What's wrong the shoes the shoes match

1620
04:04:33,750 --> 04:04:44,239
There's a page on making an algorithm to solve this specific puzzle on zoom beanies. By the way, what?

1621
04:04:48,530 --> 04:04:50,709
Dude, how about this?

1622
04:04:50,709 --> 04:05:01,620
Try to do one for 30 minutes and we'll gamble that's a long time 30 minutes sub only

1623
04:05:02,959 --> 04:05:04,719
30 minutes that's

1624
04:05:04,719 --> 04:05:08,000
That sounds boring. That sounds really boring

1625
04:05:09,750 --> 04:05:17,780
That's like a third that's like 20 of this whole stream so far making an hour. No, that'd be horrible

1626
04:05:18,260 --> 04:05:29,399
How about 10 minutes 15 minutes 15 minutes? Can I complete this in 15 minutes what i'm looking at right now?

1627
04:05:29,479 --> 04:05:50,659
I'm getting bored 15 minutes the deal do one that you're at least comfortable with

1628
04:05:56,159 --> 04:05:59,600
I think I could do that one. It's gonna be kind of hard but I could do it

1629
04:05:59,920 --> 04:06:09,559
So this one again is if they have to share a trait with whoever's adjacent to them

1630
04:06:11,010 --> 04:06:22,309
Yeah, put it in emote only 15 minutes. You got it. I'll try you'd better beat it

1631
04:06:22,389 --> 04:06:26,440
I'm I can't tell you that's gonna happen in five minutes

1632
04:06:26,440 --> 04:06:28,680
I might realize I can't do this and get up and go get like a snack

1633
04:06:30,870 --> 04:06:32,870
Just be aware of what you're betting on here

1634
04:06:33,110 --> 04:06:40,559
This is very very hard zumbini's logical journey this shit is not for kids kids can't do this

1635
04:06:40,879 --> 04:06:47,649
This is not even for adults computers have problems doing this they made an algorithm to try to beat this game on very very hard

1636
04:06:48,760 --> 04:07:08,389
And that even struggled so just make sure you understand what you're betting on. All right, ready and go 15 minutes

1637
04:07:11,760 --> 04:07:13,760
All right, let's go

1638
04:07:13,760 --> 04:07:15,760
Looking

1639
04:07:21,520 --> 04:07:33,569
What do I have the most of this hair there you go, you got it

1640
04:07:43,079 --> 04:07:46,979
What's the matter, uh

1641
04:07:56,069 --> 04:07:59,270
Why not

1642
04:08:00,790 --> 04:08:08,690
He just drowned that person why not is it only based on hair

1643
04:08:11,090 --> 04:08:13,090
Hold on nose. Wait

1644
04:08:13,250 --> 04:08:16,760
It's got to match everybody so I need

1645
04:08:54,469 --> 04:09:02,340
Oh fuck

1646
04:09:23,030 --> 04:09:27,090
You cannot help me with emotes it's not gonna work this isn't breath of the wild

1647
04:09:37,350 --> 04:09:43,409
Nope, what do you mean? No, why not glasses shoot? What what?

1648
04:09:45,479 --> 04:10:01,329
All this dickhead down here

1649
04:10:03,459 --> 04:10:11,639
I screwed up so bad. I need to go buy feet and hair and nose

1650
04:10:12,200 --> 04:11:11,670
And eyes, this is impossible. There you go. You got i'm going i'm going

1651
04:11:16,610 --> 04:11:44,079
Uh, how much time do I have left? It's been five minutes already. What?

1652
04:11:45,680 --> 04:12:03,430
All right, i'm gonna lock in I have so many of these pink shoes

1653
04:12:03,430 --> 04:12:16,020
I don't know what to do with them eyes and hair eyes and hair eyes and hair hair and eyes and nose

1654
04:12:18,950 --> 04:12:21,569
Okay eyes

1655
04:12:22,559 --> 04:12:23,840
nose

1656
04:12:23,840 --> 04:12:28,469
hair, okay eyes

1657
04:12:29,840 --> 04:12:32,069
nose

1658
04:12:32,069 --> 04:12:35,959
hair

1659
04:12:35,959 --> 04:12:40,790
eyes

1660
04:12:40,790 --> 04:12:54,079
Oh

1661
04:12:54,079 --> 04:13:02,229
This is close. Okay, if I move the one to the left and switch it with somebody with shoes, hold on

1662
04:13:08,739 --> 04:13:14,760
Why no I can I can I can yes I can

1663
04:13:32,920 --> 04:13:36,280
It's so close and I just I need to move like one person

1664
04:13:43,969 --> 04:13:47,030
Uh

1665
04:13:47,030 --> 04:13:56,979
Who needs to move to make this right pointing at me outy. What does that mean?

1666
04:13:58,659 --> 04:14:11,780
You trying to tell me something sunglasses down hair left eyes up. Wait if I

1667
04:14:31,120 --> 04:14:57,110
Gg gg gg not yet. There you go. You got it. What why?

1668
04:14:57,750 --> 04:15:06,840
No, what are you talking about? What? Oh, i'm very confused right now. Explain this pink shoes pink shoes to the left

1669
04:15:07,649 --> 04:15:11,889
Uh the eyes that are kind of half closed down eyes that are half closed

1670
04:15:12,370 --> 04:15:40,629
Oh the person on the right. Yeah, there's only two. Come on. I can do it. No, I wanted to put you there

1671
04:15:51,889 --> 04:16:05,799
Time seven minutes. There you go. You got it. Shit

1672
04:16:27,090 --> 04:16:34,069
I need to rethink this

1673
04:16:34,549 --> 04:16:42,209
It's just like it's like four distinct different variables to be aware of i'm so close, but i'm so far away

1674
04:16:54,000 --> 04:17:04,120
For the two of you why?

1675
04:17:27,889 --> 04:17:32,549
I can't do it. I can't do it. It's just it's so tricky

1676
04:17:32,629 --> 04:17:39,729
It's a lot of it's a lot of ifs thens or buts and then there's a lot of moving. It's huh

1677
04:17:40,129 --> 04:17:47,799
I got five minutes. Hold on. I didn't put any springs down. Oh

1678
04:18:15,250 --> 04:18:17,399
Not this one

1679
04:18:17,399 --> 04:18:20,920
But wait, no it

1680
04:18:22,870 --> 04:18:35,559
I think I lose. Sorry everybody. I was like I can do it green nose green nose. Wait, hold on

1681
04:18:37,000 --> 04:18:42,739
Green green green

1682
04:18:42,739 --> 04:18:44,399
and then

1683
04:18:44,399 --> 04:18:53,520
No, and then no, I need a different nose. I need a different nose to go here. We're in a different nose

1684
04:18:58,340 --> 04:19:16,680
Our computer had prob they made a computer program and it didn't do it. This is so hard

1685
04:19:26,979 --> 04:19:30,979
Everybody has to have something in common with everybody next to them and it's just like hurting my head

1686
04:19:52,049 --> 04:19:55,250
Nope, no, but it's always always a problem

1687
04:19:57,889 --> 04:20:06,129
It's a it's always a problem see because like there's always somebody that doesn't match there. You got it. It's always a problem

1688
04:20:14,209 --> 04:20:29,040
Okay, hold on there. You got it

1689
04:20:50,120 --> 04:20:55,510
I think it was a it was a good attempt. It was a pretty good attempt. I think it's over though

1690
04:20:55,750 --> 04:21:20,260
I think this is far too difficult. It's not over yet. Hold on. No

1691
04:21:25,379 --> 04:21:31,569
Shit, i'm not happy right now. I'm very unhappy. No, what do you mean? No?

1692
04:21:42,290 --> 04:21:43,649
30 seconds

1693
04:21:43,649 --> 04:21:49,010
Nope, can't do that. I lose it. It's over. I just end it. I lose it's over. I can't do it

1694
04:21:53,879 --> 04:21:56,100
I can't do it

1695
04:21:56,100 --> 04:21:58,340
It's over. I I can't do it and it

1696
04:21:58,340 --> 04:22:00,770
It's I just can't do it

1697
04:22:00,770 --> 04:22:05,860
Let him out let him out of emote only I came kind of close but not really it's like a rubik's cube

1698
04:22:06,340 --> 04:22:08,420
Where somebody's probably just like oh dude, it's so easy

1699
04:22:08,420 --> 04:22:13,059
Just put the green guy over there and then put the fucking purple guy right here and put the blue guy over here

1700
04:22:13,299 --> 04:22:23,319
It's so simple

1701
04:22:23,319 --> 04:22:30,129
Hard sorry everybody you fucked me bro. I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you already

1702
04:22:34,870 --> 04:22:36,870
Can I do the pizza one? I'm very very hard

1703
04:22:38,309 --> 04:22:43,909
Bet on me. This is my game. This is my game. This is my game right here

1704
04:22:45,059 --> 04:22:48,290
Another bet 10 minutes. This is my game

1705
04:22:59,920 --> 04:23:01,920
I did it before you watched me do it before

1706
04:23:02,399 --> 04:23:14,129
How could you make it up to my grandma? Huh? She went all in she has nothing now your grandmother

1707
04:23:14,770 --> 04:23:17,569
Probably has like 12 channel points on this stream

1708
04:23:18,920 --> 04:23:23,879
She probably opened it was checking in to see what her grandson or granddaughter was up to

1709
04:23:25,120 --> 04:23:28,100
And closed it in five minutes. So

1710
04:23:30,309 --> 04:23:39,299
Okay, we ready

1711
04:23:39,299 --> 04:23:41,059
Have faith in me with the pizza mini game

1712
04:23:41,059 --> 04:23:46,100
I'm telling you you I just did it on very very very very very very very very very very very very very very hard already

1713
04:23:46,950 --> 04:24:14,340
I got it. I got it. Why do you play puzzle games on stream? You don't like it chat doesn't like it

1714
04:24:14,420 --> 04:24:22,389
I don't like it. Can you just go back to playing ass fart simulator? I mean, I like it. I think one of my favorite games

1715
04:24:27,270 --> 04:24:33,430
I love how you're separated from that. You don't like it chat doesn't like it. I don't like it

1716
04:24:34,200 --> 04:24:43,750
Aren't you a part of chat? How come you're separating yourself from chat? You're in chat

1717
04:24:47,559 --> 04:24:54,639
You know, you don't like it. I love this. I love this pizza game. All right, we ready

1718
04:24:54,959 --> 04:25:02,239
I hope you bet on me because i'm gonna make you a lot of channel points if you did in three

1719
04:25:02,879 --> 04:25:05,059
Two one go

1720
04:25:11,079 --> 04:25:15,010
Good toppings are distasteful where it doesn't matter

1721
04:25:16,930 --> 04:25:24,149
That's fine. We already know we're going for the uh, we're going for the trunk right here. Okay trunk

1722
04:25:25,110 --> 04:25:28,399
Very much would have been happy about this does not want

1723
04:25:29,420 --> 04:25:34,260
jalapenos jalapenos, I know how to say it. Why did I just say it weirdly? Let's go like this

1724
04:25:40,770 --> 04:25:44,850
No cheese got it. There's something there. I'll remake it. I'll remake it

1725
04:25:45,329 --> 04:25:47,329
I'll give you a refund. Just give it back

1726
04:25:56,159 --> 04:26:01,079
So you don't want cheese you don't want peppers. Do you want pineapple?

1727
04:26:10,479 --> 04:26:13,600
Those of you that have just lost a shitload of channel points, I just want to say

1728
04:26:14,479 --> 04:26:19,520
How could you have possibly bet against me in my favorite mini game in my favorite game of all time?

1729
04:26:22,770 --> 04:26:28,600
I'm just shocked really I am

1730
04:26:28,600 --> 04:26:30,100
Okay

1731
04:26:30,100 --> 04:26:32,100
What about just sprinkles?

1732
04:26:33,280 --> 04:26:42,840
Something on that's not good for me

1733
04:26:43,239 --> 04:26:57,319
Okay, well i'm gonna do something here that it might be a little unorthodox and it was because I didn't even look

1734
04:27:06,520 --> 04:27:09,479
Yeah, that's really unorthodox to a point where it was completely wrong

1735
04:27:10,760 --> 04:27:12,760
I just didn't even look over there. Okay

1736
04:27:13,079 --> 04:27:21,620
Nobody wants cheese. I'd appreciate more toppings good

1737
04:27:22,659 --> 04:27:34,290
There's something on that. I don't want time check. What do I got seven and a half minutes?

1738
04:27:36,639 --> 04:27:39,440
Uh and pepperoni

1739
04:27:44,709 --> 04:27:48,149
There's something there. I won't eat you don't want pepperoni

1740
04:27:49,750 --> 04:27:57,350
There's something on that. I don't want she might actually like pineapple because the cherry was there so he wanted it. I'll try that

1741
04:28:06,930 --> 04:28:08,370
No, okay

1742
04:28:08,370 --> 04:28:09,809
um

1743
04:28:09,809 --> 04:28:11,409
so you want

1744
04:28:11,409 --> 04:28:16,659
That one you want pepperoni sprinkles and jalapenos

1745
04:28:26,639 --> 04:28:28,950
What no, wait, what's going on?

1746
04:28:29,190 --> 04:28:32,069
Something's wrong pepperoni. What's happening pepperoni?

1747
04:28:34,559 --> 04:28:52,659
What doesn't want pineapple doesn't want mushrooms doesn't want jalapenos. What the hell do you want chocolate syrup?

1748
04:28:52,979 --> 04:28:57,440
Is it cheese?

1749
04:28:57,440 --> 04:29:01,510
I thought everybody didn't want cheese. Oh, it's because that one has a

1750
04:29:02,229 --> 04:29:07,090
Fucking cherry on it

1751
04:29:07,569 --> 04:29:09,649
What?

1752
04:29:09,649 --> 04:29:19,000
There's something on that. I don't want what it's mushrooms. Oh my god. What am I doing? It's mushrooms. It's mushrooms

1753
04:29:19,079 --> 04:29:22,040
Okay, I got it. I got it. It's mushrooms. It's literally mushrooms game over. I win

1754
04:29:23,270 --> 04:29:27,940
What toppings are?

1755
04:29:28,180 --> 04:29:29,860
Wait, what's happening?

1756
04:29:29,860 --> 04:29:31,620
What's going on?

1757
04:29:31,620 --> 04:29:35,540
I thought she liked mushrooms, which does she not like pepperoni? Was I not paying attention?

1758
04:29:36,260 --> 04:29:43,829
What happened? No. No, i'm serious. What happened? I thought she liked the pepperonis. She liked the mushrooms

1759
04:29:46,450 --> 04:29:53,110
I'm very confused right now. What did I just do to what happened? I just like blacked out for five seconds

1760
04:29:53,670 --> 04:30:06,360
I did she not want pepperoni. Why did what's going on? I just lost track of everything because look at all this shit

1761
04:30:07,360 --> 04:30:16,690
What happened? I got five minutes. I have to just start from scratch here. Okay, let's um, she likes mushrooms

1762
04:30:18,129 --> 04:30:25,510
Mushrooms and pepperoni just do it again. Just do it again. I fucked it up. Oh my god. What's happening actually fucking being stupid

1763
04:30:27,030 --> 04:30:33,430
Okay, she doesn't want pepperoni. Why did I think she wanted pepperoni? Why did I think she wanted pepperoni who why?

1764
04:30:34,149 --> 04:30:38,549
I don't even remember what made me think that what made me think she wanted pepperoni on this

1765
04:30:39,940 --> 04:30:43,299
Nobody nobody it's cheese

1766
04:30:46,870 --> 04:30:48,870
I got it. We're good

1767
04:30:49,190 --> 04:30:51,190
What the fuck are you talking about?

1768
04:30:53,750 --> 04:30:57,670
How did I just black out the last like two minutes, I don't even know what happened

1769
04:30:59,440 --> 04:31:01,440
Oh shit. Okay. So what do you?

1770
04:31:02,319 --> 04:31:08,840
On your pizza

1771
04:31:08,840 --> 04:31:21,829
Is it no you don't want pineapple? Maybe it is pineapple because there was

1772
04:31:22,389 --> 04:31:24,389
That topping no, it's not pineapple

1773
04:31:25,889 --> 04:31:28,530
There's something on that. I don't want dude

1774
04:31:28,610 --> 04:31:32,610
I can't even read the chat and i've and I like I looked over here and forgot the whole game

1775
04:31:34,260 --> 04:31:37,860
I'm gonna get it right now. I'm not looking over at chat. I looked over at chat and I forgot the entire game

1776
04:31:38,100 --> 04:31:42,579
I like was like, oh, what are they doing over here? Oh interesting and I look back over and i'm like I forget the entire experience

1777
04:31:43,299 --> 04:31:47,600
All right. I'm not looking at chat ever again. What do you want?

1778
04:31:48,930 --> 04:31:52,969
You want this shit and you want jalapenos on it, too? That's a guarantee

1779
04:31:57,719 --> 04:32:03,959
Hmm little pizza makers good. Okay, let's go. Let's go. I got four minutes. I'm good. I have three minutes

1780
04:32:04,840 --> 04:32:09,770
What is this? What do you want? You don't like anything? This guy doesn't like anything. Let's just do um

1781
04:32:11,159 --> 04:32:18,940
This like more toppings, please. All right, good start

1782
04:32:19,899 --> 04:32:33,219
You don't want jalapenos. How about um, how about uh, uh

1783
04:32:37,100 --> 04:32:40,629
I gotta start from scratch. This is gonna be it

1784
04:32:41,909 --> 04:32:44,069
No, no cheese. All right, so we know no cheese

1785
04:32:49,799 --> 04:32:51,000
No cheese

1786
04:32:51,000 --> 04:32:57,719
What about just mushrooms?

1787
04:32:57,959 --> 04:33:02,760
Okay. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. No cheese. No mushrooms. What about just pepperoni? We're gonna get it

1788
04:33:14,330 --> 04:33:17,529
What's the time time? That's time. That's time. That's time. That's time. That's time. That's time

1789
04:33:23,849 --> 04:33:36,090
That's time how much time was left 150 seconds left. We got it. I completely forgot her entire order

1790
04:33:37,880 --> 04:33:39,750
Jesus

1791
04:33:39,750 --> 04:33:44,169
Don't have a bet against me and pizza maker

1792
04:33:49,799 --> 04:33:55,049
Have we not seen one on very very hard?

1793
04:33:55,209 --> 04:34:00,060
We haven't done this one here we go again

1794
04:34:00,619 --> 04:34:02,619
More of those little pebbles

1795
04:34:02,619 --> 04:34:07,209
And you can let them out. We don't need to bet any again. We don't have to bet again

1796
04:34:08,900 --> 04:34:14,020
Anymore I made all your money back

1797
04:34:21,700 --> 04:34:24,869
As it knows

1798
04:34:24,869 --> 04:34:26,869
You do not okay, maybe hair

1799
04:34:27,590 --> 04:34:41,000
What about hair? Let's try hair. What the actual hell did I just tune into the logical journey of the zoom beanies?

1800
04:34:46,139 --> 04:34:48,700
This way

1801
04:34:53,819 --> 04:34:55,529
Go ahead

1802
04:34:55,529 --> 04:34:57,590
Do go in

1803
04:34:57,590 --> 04:35:08,180
It was the easiest money of my life. Uh, can I go this way? Are you okay with me coming up? No, you're not

1804
04:35:10,680 --> 04:35:13,020
We must be selective about our clientele

1805
04:35:16,099 --> 04:35:22,779
So why can you go here but you can't what's the difference? Is it eyes? It has to be nose, right?

1806
04:35:23,419 --> 04:35:26,490
Yellow nose this way. No

1807
04:35:27,560 --> 04:35:32,869
Yellow nose this way

1808
04:35:32,869 --> 04:35:34,869
Has to be noses for the top bro

1809
04:35:39,419 --> 04:35:48,009
Okay

1810
04:35:48,009 --> 04:35:50,630
really

1811
04:35:53,509 --> 04:35:55,509
So this one must be eye no

1812
04:35:55,669 --> 04:36:00,919
hair

1813
04:36:00,919 --> 04:36:05,990
I have no idea

1814
04:36:05,990 --> 04:36:07,990
I guess we just figured it out

1815
04:36:09,220 --> 04:36:11,689
Uh, let's try that then

1816
04:36:11,689 --> 04:36:12,650
Okay

1817
04:36:12,650 --> 04:36:14,650
I think this is correct. No, it's not

1818
04:36:18,779 --> 04:36:22,040
Spring probably has to go up this way

1819
04:36:27,909 --> 04:36:40,459
Red nose over here. No red nose this way red nose this way. No. Oh, sorry

1820
04:36:41,700 --> 04:36:44,580
this way

1821
04:36:45,459 --> 04:36:56,360
A blue nose with this hair going this way. Nope, that's wrong. Enjoy yourself

1822
04:36:56,759 --> 04:37:05,939
That's correct pink and then there's there no green noses where the green noses go probably up around

1823
04:37:11,860 --> 04:37:17,590
All right, let's see happen. Do you want to see what happens when you lose? It's pretty bad

1824
04:37:23,560 --> 04:37:34,869
Ready? Why is it not happening?

1825
04:37:40,790 --> 04:37:57,939
Can you lose on practice? Oh, yes, you can. Yeah you can

1826
04:38:01,900 --> 04:38:07,319
Can't let you in this whole place is gonna fucking cave in

1827
04:38:22,889 --> 04:38:27,529
They're very forgiving on this level unlike every other level in the game on hard

1828
04:38:35,299 --> 04:38:39,240
Why do I remember this being way more morbid? I thought the whole thing caved in

1829
04:38:46,759 --> 04:39:01,369
All right, that's probably it. That was fun. Any encores you'd like to see before we stop any encores do the lion room

1830
04:39:05,720 --> 04:39:10,840
Do pizza again paint wall again. Let me do paint wall on the on the very hard. Not very very hard

1831
04:39:19,990 --> 04:39:23,509
Okay, that's very weird. I don't know why they'd be this far away from each other

1832
04:39:27,459 --> 04:39:48,580
How would these two be this far away? They have the same hair. They have the same feet. Okay blue pink blue

1833
04:39:50,310 --> 04:39:53,880
pink blue

1834
04:39:53,880 --> 04:39:56,180
I don't know pink pink

1835
04:40:00,729 --> 04:40:02,729
blue pink blue

1836
04:40:04,889 --> 04:40:08,700
Pink blue

1837
04:40:08,700 --> 04:40:10,060
blue

1838
04:40:10,060 --> 04:40:13,259
Blue pink blue blue blue pink pink

1839
04:40:13,900 --> 04:40:20,490
pink green

1840
04:40:22,169 --> 04:40:23,369
Green

1841
04:40:23,369 --> 04:40:24,250
No

1842
04:40:24,250 --> 04:40:55,369
It's the eyes. Yeah, I know but but who goes where because I can't just put this guy right here the hair and the eyes

1843
04:40:58,439 --> 04:41:02,220
Eyes, then feet so it would be that

1844
04:41:03,020 --> 04:41:06,630
Okay

1845
04:41:06,630 --> 04:41:18,860
Um, i'm gonna imagine it's this and then this and then

1846
04:41:22,220 --> 04:41:32,520
This but what how do I determine this then like this?

1847
04:41:36,060 --> 04:41:55,619
Very very very hard. Very very very hard. This one is not on very very very hard. All right. Good got it

1848
04:41:56,840 --> 04:41:59,610
Interior blue

1849
04:41:59,610 --> 04:42:08,119
Exterior blue diamond. Why did I just do that twice? I need to go eat a fucking jar of peanut butter

1850
04:42:11,799 --> 04:42:27,110
I thought that was wait. I'm confusing myself. Here it is. I had to mute you dude. Sorry. You're annoying

1851
04:42:27,509 --> 04:42:32,180
I had to mute. What are you doing here?

1852
04:42:41,900 --> 04:42:43,860
Okay, how about that?

1853
04:42:43,860 --> 04:43:03,509
Nope a jar one of the whole jar a like a few spoonfuls. All right, so this is blue

1854
04:43:04,150 --> 04:43:05,819
red

1855
04:43:05,819 --> 04:43:08,180
Let's just try pink

1856
04:43:08,259 --> 04:43:11,430
No, okay. What about yellow?

1857
04:43:11,430 --> 04:43:13,669
Got it yellow with a diamond

1858
04:43:14,290 --> 04:43:21,290
interior

1859
04:43:21,290 --> 04:43:23,740
circle interior

1860
04:43:23,740 --> 04:43:27,830
Why peanut butter protein protein good fats?

1861
04:43:36,040 --> 04:43:44,549
Okay, so we need to find a different

1862
04:43:45,409 --> 04:43:48,500
interior

1863
04:43:48,500 --> 04:43:49,860
Okay

1864
04:43:49,860 --> 04:43:52,819
Red interiors. I need red interior triangle

1865
04:43:53,619 --> 04:43:54,659
yellow

1866
04:43:54,659 --> 04:44:04,360
This is green

1867
04:44:04,360 --> 04:44:06,840
exterior

1868
04:44:06,840 --> 04:44:18,020
Red interior triangle, okay

1869
04:44:20,220 --> 04:44:27,189
so

1870
04:44:27,349 --> 04:44:30,869
yellow interior

1871
04:44:31,029 --> 04:44:35,159
square

1872
04:44:35,159 --> 04:44:36,119
green

1873
04:44:36,119 --> 04:44:49,540
exterior pink

1874
04:44:49,540 --> 04:45:01,700
Interior there's only two places it could be pink interior or green interior. We're gonna do pink interior which hopefully is over here

1875
04:45:05,139 --> 04:45:12,229
pink exterior

1876
04:45:12,229 --> 04:45:14,490
square

1877
04:45:14,490 --> 04:45:20,630
right

1878
04:45:20,630 --> 04:45:22,229
Ah

1879
04:45:22,229 --> 04:45:35,849
It's right here. Do I have enough shots to do one more? No, there's no more mud. Damn it. It's all right

1880
04:45:36,250 --> 04:45:49,419
It's okay. Do it again. All right one more time that one. This one's fun

1881
04:45:50,299 --> 04:45:56,619
This time I don't want to waste that much. Let's go

1882
04:45:59,220 --> 04:46:02,500
All right. So what does that mean? Let's try a different one. Let's try like just like circle

1883
04:46:03,619 --> 04:46:13,400
Okay

1884
04:46:18,500 --> 04:46:20,659
Shit okay, this is gonna be weird. So this is yellow

1885
04:46:23,459 --> 04:46:27,060
diamond

1886
04:46:27,060 --> 04:46:29,060
so this would be

1887
04:46:29,979 --> 04:46:32,459
God, I don't know. It's all green exterior in here

1888
04:46:34,869 --> 04:46:50,439
When the interior is in the same area like this, it's kind of hard. I'm gonna say red. No blue interior and

1889
04:46:50,919 --> 04:46:52,599
star

1890
04:46:52,599 --> 04:47:01,299
Nope pink interior

1891
04:47:03,099 --> 04:47:05,099
square

1892
04:47:05,099 --> 04:47:11,450
Good. All right. We're gonna go red exterior

1893
04:47:12,490 --> 04:47:14,490
pink interior square

1894
04:47:14,490 --> 04:47:22,200
I'm hoping it's this one right here. We're gonna do blue exterior red pink interior square

1895
04:47:22,759 --> 04:47:50,869
So what is all what would be all the way to the right circle? Right? No star. No square. No triangle yellow interior

1896
04:47:51,110 --> 04:48:01,560
Is a his here blue exterior is here. It'll be triangle. Okay

1897
04:48:04,790 --> 04:48:08,009
blue exterior

1898
04:48:08,009 --> 04:48:12,549
green interior

1899
04:48:12,549 --> 04:48:16,520
Triangle I am so

1900
04:48:17,459 --> 04:48:21,619
brilliant at this

1901
04:48:21,619 --> 04:48:26,889
Okay, I think i'll get it this time yellow exterior

1902
04:48:33,349 --> 04:48:36,459
We're hoping it's this one yellow exterior

1903
04:48:37,459 --> 04:48:39,959
square

1904
04:48:39,959 --> 04:48:43,509
pink

1905
04:48:43,509 --> 04:48:45,509
Ah

1906
04:48:48,220 --> 04:48:54,549
What no I fucked it up yellow exterior blue interior there it is

1907
04:48:58,200 --> 04:49:00,040
I have two more shots in here for sure

1908
04:49:00,040 --> 04:49:11,110
pink exterior

1909
04:49:11,110 --> 04:49:15,979
What's in the middle star?

1910
04:49:18,700 --> 04:49:22,549
and

1911
04:49:22,549 --> 04:49:25,939
yellow interior

1912
04:49:27,270 --> 04:49:33,479
Oh, no, no, no, it's the third slot. What's the third slot trying diamond? I got one more shot. I'm good

1913
04:49:33,560 --> 04:49:42,060
Let's go get it right. All right

1914
04:49:42,060 --> 04:49:50,099
I got one more shot. This is triangle with a pink exterior

1915
04:49:52,810 --> 04:50:03,909
And a blue interior think that's correct. All right, I got it

1916
04:50:04,389 --> 04:50:18,630
I got it earlier in the stream. You said you don't know mountain rescue, but you literally streamed it

1917
04:50:18,869 --> 04:50:24,939
I know but here's the thing dude

1918
04:50:25,020 --> 04:50:31,560
I've played like I've played like two or three thousand video games over the last 12 years doing this

1919
04:50:31,880 --> 04:50:39,029
I I don't remember all of them. I just really don't I just don't remember

1920
04:50:43,860 --> 04:50:45,700
some some of them like

1921
04:50:45,700 --> 04:50:47,779
Like seven or eight nine years ago

1922
04:50:48,439 --> 04:50:52,459
I don't I don't have the capacity to remember every single video game

1923
04:50:52,540 --> 04:51:00,979
I played five to ten years ago, like if you put it in front of me, I'd be like, oh, okay, right

1924
04:51:02,540 --> 04:51:08,540
All right, but there's been

1925
04:51:09,259 --> 04:51:21,909
Millions of pieces of information have gone through here over the last 15 years. I win. All right, and that's it

1926
04:51:22,229 --> 04:51:35,819
I'm just trying to get one across

1927
04:51:35,819 --> 04:52:40,939
It sounds like a lincoln park sound it kind of does hey one survived. All right, these are impossible

1928
04:52:44,250 --> 04:52:48,630
All right, that's gonna be it. That's all the plan was today. Let's play this for a little while

1929
04:52:48,950 --> 04:52:53,299
Look at how much easier this is one easy

1930
04:52:53,619 --> 04:53:05,340
Okay, you guys ready? I literally thought the perfect game you should play it's called you're in the movies. I played that already

1931
04:53:05,659 --> 04:53:15,619
So here's the thing. What is

1932
04:53:16,020 --> 04:53:23,020
What is a good game that I can play? I have a couple of options here

1933
04:53:25,979 --> 04:53:32,380
I'm not talking about today talking about the next time I stream. I've really been playing this for five hours

1934
04:53:33,880 --> 04:53:41,700
It was fun. Maybe we'll do like a grab bag stream

1935
04:53:42,340 --> 04:53:44,099
next stream

1936
04:53:44,099 --> 04:53:52,360
Yeah, so s3 is still on the 24th because we we got through the things I wanted to get through

1937
04:53:53,080 --> 04:53:59,500
I wanted to play zoom beanies. We did that. I wanted to

1938
04:54:00,060 --> 04:54:07,400
Play katamari and finish it. We did that do the lies of p demo. I'll probably just wait for the full game

1939
04:54:07,799 --> 04:54:14,340
I'm imagining the lies of p demo is the tutorial zone and the tutorial boss and then that's it

1940
04:54:14,580 --> 04:54:23,880
I'll just wait till it's up. Maybe we'll do a grab bag on

1941
04:54:24,439 --> 04:54:33,000
Monday. I'll see you guys on monday next stream do more infomercials

1942
04:54:35,000 --> 04:54:38,279
Maybe a reverse delay maybe a reverse delay in the future

1943
04:54:38,599 --> 04:54:41,400
It's possible. I just stream on sunday

1944
04:54:41,400 --> 04:54:50,200
But let's plan for monday and then maybe i'll show up on sunday. We'll see keep an eye on the sus

1945
04:54:50,279 --> 04:54:57,319
It might change it definitely won't be later than monday, but it could be sunday. It won't be it's not gonna be tuesday

1946
04:54:58,759 --> 04:55:02,099
It's not gonna be tuesday. It's gonna be

1947
04:55:02,819 --> 04:55:19,930
At some point as at some point as of monday there will be a stream sunday or monday, but that is the end

1948
04:55:20,009 --> 04:55:27,189
Have a great night. See you guys later. See you on monday or sunday. He's gonna delay till wednesday. No, I will not

1949
04:55:32,740 --> 04:55:34,740
I will not delay till wednesday

1950
04:55:40,439 --> 04:55:45,159
Thanks for sticking around. Thanks for hanging out. That was zoom. It's on steam zoom beanies is on steam if you feel like playing it

1951
04:55:45,400 --> 04:55:49,740
It was a good time. Thanks for hanging out. See you guys on

1952
04:55:50,380 --> 04:55:59,819
monday or so

1953
04:55:59,819 --> 04:56:01,819
Somebody said nah, i'm good

1954
04:56:02,740 --> 04:56:07,209
That is so much more. All right, they're like nah, i'm good

1955
04:56:08,060 --> 04:56:14,229
It's so much worse than no than just saying no, don't you think so?

1956
04:56:15,500 --> 04:56:20,779
Saying i'm good means you've really thought about it and we're like, nah, nah fucking i'm i'm good. I'm good

1957
04:56:21,639 --> 04:56:30,279
That would make it bad. I'm good over here to me. That's more insulting than just saying no like oh

1958
04:56:30,439 --> 04:56:32,439
You're gonna be there on monday?

1959
04:56:33,060 --> 04:56:40,709
No. Oh, okay. Cool. Hey, you're gonna be there on monday. No, i'm good because to me i'm good means

1960
04:56:42,490 --> 04:56:47,369
I thought about it and the answer is no no means there could be something else going on that you're missing the stream for

1961
04:56:48,119 --> 04:56:51,319
You got homework. You got friends are coming over. You got some stuff to do

1962
04:56:51,880 --> 04:56:56,680
You don't feel like watching twitch that you know, it could be it could mean anything. I'm good means you've already thought about it

1963
04:57:00,180 --> 04:57:04,599
Banned that person for life by the way. All right. I'll see you guys later. Thanks for watching. See you on monday

1964
04:57:04,680 --> 04:57:07,819
Goodbye. Good night. Call your mother. See you soon. Take care of yourselves

1965
04:57:10,880 --> 04:57:23,959
Overthinking andy i'm i'm kidding. Don't worry. Well, the credits are over

1966
04:57:25,819 --> 04:57:26,779
Oops

1967
04:57:26,779 --> 04:57:33,830
All right. Good night guys. See you later. Have a good one

1968
04:58:57,900 --> 04:59:00,380
Also, I want to talk quietly in case anyone was

1969
04:59:00,939 --> 04:59:02,619
I'm still here

1970
04:59:02,619 --> 04:59:05,340
I'm waiting till it's exactly five hours of stream time

1971
04:59:06,459 --> 04:59:08,459
Because I can't 459

1972
04:59:09,099 --> 04:59:11,580
Is is just killing me here has to be five

1973
04:59:13,130 --> 04:59:16,009
And it has to be that's gonna drive me crazy

1974
04:59:17,689 --> 04:59:19,689
All right. See you later
