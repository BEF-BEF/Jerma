00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:28,140
Hello everybody. We're a little late, but it's all right.

2
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,259
We were trying to get um, Ster, you could go ahead and give a small explanation

3
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:40,250
if you want. Um, it's really hard to make Elden Ring mods work with other Elden

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,770
Ring mods without doing a lot of shenanigans to

5
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,729
merge things properly and have them load in the right

6
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:50,490
order. And I had everything perfectly working,

7
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,539
but our greed to have it all working really kept us going.

8
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,369
What's the downfall? Me. Well, no, that's it.

9
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:05,450
So we, everything seems to be working as intended. We have the Diablo 2 loot mod.

10
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,090
We have Diablo, we have, I almost said Diablo 2 reforged.

11
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,290
We have Elden Ring reforged and a new randomizer seed with new

12
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,819
randomizations. The problem is Elden Ring reforged

13
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:24,900
probably doesn't work. One part of it doesn't work.

14
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,500
Okay. It's a really big mod to be clear. There's a lot of stuff in it

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,099
and we don't know what doesn't work in it, but the options when you sit down in

16
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,019
a bonfire, a tree kills us when we select them.

17
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:39,859
Yes, so we cannot explain that. We are instantly killed

18
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:43,219
when we, and we don't know what it says. There's no text string. It just

19
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:47,400
says like text goes here and we don't know what we're selecting.

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,859
So maybe. And then you say yes and a tree kills you. A tree kills you when you say yes.

21
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:58,700
And then randomizer works, but the item randomizer does not work.

22
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,700
So only enemies are randomized, but Diablo items

23
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,860
are randomized. So here we go. So we're good.

24
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,419
All right, are you through the tutorial? We're gonna do, let's just get through

25
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,479
the tutorial first. Just so we can get in there. Wait, did you make a

26
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,159
character? No, I was looking at the, what, my starting characters. Oh, okay.

27
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:24,020
All right, so I made somebody. So I'll just, I'll just do that part first.

28
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,539
Did you, did you choose based on like? I choose, I choose

29
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:30,819
based on the starting stats because I've been,

30
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:35,400
and plus I got, I'm all right. Oh, I was gonna look through and see like the

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,680
starting items because we have for some reason very weird starting

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:46,009
items and this one character for me looks like very OP. Interesting.

33
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:50,550
Oh, grab it. I might, I might. This is the character that I have.

34
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,780
Because I see what I want to do if I can. I want to do

35
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,139
like frenzied flame shit. My character's name is

36
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,979
My Eyes with an exclamation point. Because your eyes hurt.

37
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:06,939
Well, because it's like, the fire comes out of their eyes.

38
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:17,639
Oh, the three fingers, dude. Yeah. All right, so hopefully we,

39
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:29,539
everything went fine. I don't know. Yeah, I think I gotta pick my warrior.

40
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:33,659
I'm not gonna be able to use my starting weapons for like hours.

41
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,620
What is, what is your, what's your starting weapon?

42
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,659
The meteorite beast's greatsword is dual wielding them.

43
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,939
So how are you gonna be able to play with, you're gonna have to wait like

44
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:53,050
two days to play it. Yeah, I think it's worth the wait.

45
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:59,659
Excuse me, dual welding. Get it right. Say it correctly.

46
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:06,139
All right, I'm going up. I, so I'm gonna show everybody what we're talking about.

47
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:11,900
Does anybody know, I wanted to play the warlock character.

48
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,300
Yeah, so Elden Ring Reforged has classes that you get to choose immediately when

49
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,339
you sit down in a bonfire. You can buy an item to activate a class,

50
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,959
but the tree kills us if we try and do it, so I don't think we can do any of

51
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,860
that. There's three other classes that are like dropped somewhere, so we'll be

52
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,019
able to find those, and I don't know what they do because it

53
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:34,660
doesn't tell you, and I don't think you can get the classes

54
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,319
anywhere else. Yeah, because I don't, I don't know what any of this stuff does.

55
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:43,259
I don't think it matters what you want to do. So what, so if I want to do that,

56
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,250
the like warlock class from Elden Ring Reforged. I think you're

57
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,290
out of luck because it will kill you. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Somebody said,

58
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,180
no, the tree, hold on. The tree, it kills you because you changed the difficulty

59
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,629
setting in Reforged settings, but the text is broken due to compatibility.

60
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,920
Make sure your config files are everything in the right order.

61
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:11,019
That makes sense. So this is not where you pick a class,

62
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:15,980
or? It is. From one of those option menus, it eventually gets you to a

63
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,870
class choice. Okay, well, did anybody know which one?

64
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,750
If I want to do warlock, does anybody know where that is in here?

65
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:41,910
Because I don't know. First, third, fifth, wait, what happened?

66
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,370
That's just hilarious that someone, I don't believe, how can they actually know?

67
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:56,870
Three, two, four. Okay, one, three. There's no two here. I want to do warlock.

68
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,509
Go outside the first door to the right of Vary under the cliff.

69
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:08,120
There is something I need as a fortune item to change classes.

70
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:15,110
Is that for real? All right, let me get out of here first, but the Diablo loot

71
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,540
should be working, which it is because I picked up this.

72
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,600
I have an uncommon club on. I have an ancestral holy giant seal of the

73
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:32,259
God Slayer. Is that like, is that like a really good fucking item?

74
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:46,470
It's ancestral. I feel like that's like, did I get like a god item rolled at the

75
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,009
very beginning? I don't know. I don't know what's going

76
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,149
on, man. Well, we're going to figure it out.

77
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:58,860
Oh, also there's one secret mod in the pack. There is?

78
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:07,529
Yeah. What do you mean? And it only affects Ronnie.

79
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:11,220
You, you, you, you didn't, you didn't put it up. You didn't know.

80
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:18,040
There's no way you did that, although I did just,

81
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,000
hey, dude, take a bunch of these files and put them in your folder.

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,350
And I was like, yeah, sure. That makes sense. So you could have probably put

83
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:31,910
anything you wanted in here. Oh, I'm glad that you trust me, um,

84
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,279
but not enough to be like a mod on your channel. Ah, that's too much for you.

85
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:40,980
That's too much power for you. I agree completely. All right, I am,

86
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,819
I'm like ready to get in your game. You're at, you're at the church,

87
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:51,420
I assume. Well, no, I mean, I will be. I'm running to the church and then I'm

88
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,680
going to open my world. What do you think of the halftime show?

89
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:04,089
Um, it was kind of like, it was good. I don't even, I, I have no, I didn't,

90
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,170
guys, I didn't even, I forgot the Super Bowls today.

91
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:12,949
Same. I forgot the Super Bowl was literally today.

92
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:22,379
I thought they stopped doing sports. Okay, I am at the church.

93
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,819
Now, there's been a lot going on. There's been a lot going on, right?

94
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:29,100
Like I, I, my brain, I just, I would have normally probably watched it.

95
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:34,340
Okay. Strengthen, strengthen arm in or event to talk, whatever.

96
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:45,289
Common sleeps, Erd tree seal. Okay. What does that mean? Causes sleep buildup?

97
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,840
What? I'm very confused by how this works. Okay.

98
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,240
Oh yeah. Like, uh, all of the, uh, status effects I believe got changed.

99
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,159
So like sleep functions a little bit differently, like poisons a little bit different.

100
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,240
Like reforge did a lot of stuff. I don't know what any of it is.

101
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,080
Okay. All right. So I can burn my, all right. I'm ready to join your game.

102
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,759
Are we ready? It's open.

103
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:22,220
Let's go to the Red Sox one, the Super Bowl.

104
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,549
I can't believe the Red Sox one again, dude, if I sell both of my starting swords

105
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:32,389
and they are Diablo a fight, mythical burning, falling star beasts

106
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:38,149
of piety requires 60 strength and 54 in and 32 decks.

107
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,509
I am never equipping these. Okay.

108
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:48,789
We need to get like item. Well, we didn't, well, we have items

109
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:52,620
because items have random stats on them too. Rare.

110
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,120
Does it have, do the items have like stats? Okay. This is mind plus one.

111
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:05,399
All right. So gear has actual stats on it. Increases stamina regen by 8%.

112
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,750
Okay. Yeah. You look ridiculous.

113
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,950
Yeah. And I believe they have random ashes of war because it's just scream.

114
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:23,879
Can you even, can you swing them? All right. So what, what's, what's

115
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,360
plan number one is, do we look up screenshots of how to pick a class?

116
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,480
I don't know that there's any. All right. All right.

117
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,960
Is anybody, can somebody please help us?

118
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:40,500
It was working, but it's not working in the specific mod load order,

119
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,149
but we kind of had to stop, you know? Yeah. We had to, we had to turn the stream on.

120
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:48,470
So, all right. If I want to play warlock.

121
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,279
Well, I know that they all cost a hundred souls.

122
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,519
Okay. So we should at least, you should at the very least sell something and have a hundred.

123
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,429
What is it? So that you can potentially accidentally buy.

124
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,350
I already don't worry about anything.

125
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,950
Both of these swords are worth 15,000. I ain't selling.

126
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:20,649
Okay. So I have enough to, to pick a class. I want the warlock. I, because I want to,

127
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:28,620
I want the frenzy flame shit to be more powerful. So which one of these is pick class?

128
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,570
First one, the third one, second one, first, third, second one.

129
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,409
How would you, your chat's just going to guess.

130
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:42,409
Stop saying no elf. Stop that act. We need help.

131
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,730
And here's the problem. If you do choose the,

132
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,690
apparently the branch that kills you, that those are difficulty options.

133
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,129
So you may accidentally change the game difficulty to like hardcore.

134
00:11:53,610 --> 00:12:08,019
Okay. Wait, wait, one, somebody said one, two, one, two, one, one, wait, one, two, one.

135
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:15,799
Good luck dog. One, this gotta be a way to fucking know this.

136
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:27,129
One, two, yeah, we need an Oracle effigy.

137
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:27,850
All right. Yeah. That's what,

138
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,529
that's what you buy from this. Normally there would be a shop here to buy them.

139
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:35,960
So, but there's no shop. I mean,

140
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:43,179
that is too silly. Sorry, bud. We can't help you.

141
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:49,429
Well, they changed it. This is an older version of reforged

142
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:56,649
so that it could work with Diablo loot. Well, look, let's just go. Let's just go.

143
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,289
Somebody will figure it out. I don't think, I don't think anyone's

144
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:07,289
going to figure it out. Well, we, we, we have gear right now.

145
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:10,330
We can go at least go kill like Margaret or something.

146
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:25,460
Yeah. Man. Oh man. What a, what a nice day out in Limgrave.

147
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:32,620
You want to go to the, where are you going? I'm just, I was just going to walk into like

148
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,860
one of these random directions. Oh, well we need the horse millennia

149
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:47,529
Melinda. So anything can drop Diablo loot or everything.

150
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:52,340
There is no more regular items in this game. There are regular items.

151
00:13:52,340 --> 00:14:01,669
And then there's also Diablo items. There's a lot of things.

152
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:16,440
This does pretty good damage. I don't have nearly the stats for this.

153
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:31,820
And I one-shot that enemy. So pretty good. It's like a phantom.

154
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,539
Yeah. And apparently I'm like stealing their souls.

155
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,539
What? I don't know.

156
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,620
Are we classes that we don't know what they are?

157
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:47,820
Do we accidentally pick classes by killing ourselves with the thing a few times?

158
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:51,899
Our starting equipment has mods on it from Diablo mod.

159
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,299
Oh, right. Right. Right.

160
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,019
Okay. Yeah. My armor strengthens golden order incantations by 10%.

161
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:08,379
And I probably have something that is healing me.

162
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,539
Oh my God. This weapon. No, don't please. Don't kill me.

163
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,779
Yeah. My helmet restores health on kill.

164
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
It seems like it works. Even if you kill something.

165
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:38,740
Ooh, I did some damage. Oh my God. I'm dead.

166
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:50,679
What happens when I die? Oh God. What did you die to?

167
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:56,730
No, but I'm poisoned. I mean, it's coming close.

168
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,730
Can I respawn here? I'm getting the bonfire.

169
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,860
Whoa. I think my game crashed.

170
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,940
Oh, I rested the bonfire and it's the Molina cut scene.

171
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,500
So maybe your game did crash. Oh, it just pulled me to you.

172
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:24,360
No, you're not. Give me one second.

173
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,600
Just talking to me about feet. I don't.

174
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,169
I do see the subs, but what I want to tell you is that's way too much.

175
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:37,990
I really appreciate it. But one of the reasons why I don't like to address subs

176
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,029
is I feel like it encourages it. And that's a lot of money.

177
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:45,909
That's way too much money. That's way too much money to be giving

178
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:51,559
an individual streamer like me. So I do appreciate anybody supporting this stream,

179
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:56,419
but that's way too much. Thank you so much.

180
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:59,690
But that is, I would say that is enough. That's a lot.

181
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,150
That is far too much to give one individual person, especially me.

182
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,910
Especially me. So please just be careful.

183
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,710
Do not put yourself in financial burden. Do not give this stream money,

184
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,589
because you think even if you think, even if you think I deserve it,

185
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,410
you guys take such good care of me already.

186
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,410
No one individual has to give like hundreds or thousands of subs.

187
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:34,259
I really appreciate it, but I don't think that worked.

188
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:42,329
But one of the reasons why I don't address subs is because I don't want to encourage people

189
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,690
to get into this loop where they give so many.

190
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,109
It's something I don't like to encourage,

191
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,450
because I don't want it to be something that people think that they should do too.

192
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:56,329
So that's all I'm going to say about it. I appreciate anything that anybody does

193
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:58,650
to this channel. Please take care of yourself.

194
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,740
Don't give me that much money. Give me five bucks a month.

195
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:05,819
That's your decision if you want to pay five bucks a month to this channel.

196
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:14,740
You absolutely do not have to, but I don't like to encourage subs, if that makes any sense.

197
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,420
I would rather you spend that money on something in your life.

198
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,500
Maybe on some other smaller streamers.

199
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,220
Not me. Do not give me a thousand subs individually.

200
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,849
I'm just going to tell you.

201
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:30,420
Thank you so much, everybody.

202
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,299
Now we game.

203
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:34,599
Did Elden ring mods?

204
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,690
Yeah, I turned on an option.

205
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,839
Can you rest of the bonfire again?

206
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:49,769
What'd you do?

207
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:50,410
Hold on.

208
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,210
Okay.

209
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,900
I turned on the option that always to spectate you after dying.

210
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:03,160
I have seen these menus before and I realized that I stumbled onto the correct option,

211
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,490
but I don't know if we both need to turn that option on.

212
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,970
So for me, when I die, I will not respawn ever until you touch a bonfire.

213
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,519
I can guide you if we both have to have it.

214
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:21,000
So where do I go from here?

215
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,839
The bottom event text for talk.

216
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:29,059
Wait, was this? I don't remember.

217
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,339
I don't want to touch anything.

218
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,259
Let me just get my horse.

219
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:36,089
Well, we'll see how I think I know which one it is.

220
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:39,980
Three, two, one, two, three, three.

221
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,750
Stop saying numbers.

222
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,109
Three, two, three, three, three.

223
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,839
Okay, I've got torrent.

224
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,160
You level up.

225
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,789
I died, so I don't have any I don't have any crunchies.

226
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,740
No crunchies.

227
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,190
Okay.

228
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,210
I mean, you want to grab the items from around here.

229
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,490
I think that's probably let me wait.

230
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,369
Let me get this on the bar.

231
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:30,299
Wait, how come?

232
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,140
There it is.

233
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,910
Okay, move that switch.

234
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,769
Okay, there it is.

235
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,539
All right, I don't have any crunchies, so you can level up.

236
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:45,180
Okay, wait, wait.

237
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,380
No, come to the bonfire.

238
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,099
I know which one it is.

239
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,819
The bottom event text for talk.

240
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,279
Okay.

241
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:59,960
And then the second from the bottom event text for talk.

242
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,460
Okay.

243
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,799
And then yes.

244
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:02,839
And what is this doing?

245
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,359
That is whenever you die, you are forced into spectator mode.

246
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,500
Okay.

247
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,640
Nice.

248
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,359
I activated it.

249
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,660
I didn't die.

250
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,160
Yeah.

251
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,579
And the one below that is when either of us dies, we both die.

252
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,099
So don't touch that one.

253
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:24,069
Unless you want us to be soul linked.

254
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:25,349
I don't think that's a good thing.

255
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:26,789
That's probably a bad idea.

256
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,269
I mean, I would.

257
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:30,390
All right, we ready?

258
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,150
Pay a lot of money to be soul linked.

259
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:32,950
All right, let's go.

260
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:40,569
Help me.

261
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,980
What does it look like I'm doing?

262
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:47,819
Missing every swing.

263
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:54,009
Okay.

264
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:57,589
Oh, yeah, the items are not going to be randomized.

265
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:00,950
It's just I don't know where Diablo items spawn.

266
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,109
Like that was a talisman of fury.

267
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:03,670
I don't.

268
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,829
Do you know what would have been so cool?

269
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:08,390
If if when I joined the game, a little.

270
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,710
And this is just like funny things that they could have added on the bottom.

271
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,710
Like a little text pop up that says so and so has joined your game.

272
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,789
Diablo's minions grow stronger.

273
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,599
Did you even get that item?

274
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,480
What?

275
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,559
You just you're just running in a random direction again.

276
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,359
Wait, what happened?

277
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,240
It was a where where?

278
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,000
Well, like you.

279
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,519
Oh, yeah, right, right, right, right, right.

280
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,400
You can loot this.

281
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,920
We can we can go down and get the thing that lets you apply ashes of wars.

282
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,279
And it's a really important item.

283
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:42,440
If the items aren't randomized, we should probably get that frost long sword.

284
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,839
Oh, yeah, then our Diablo loot is different because I got a talisman from there.

285
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,039
Well, all right, take a look.

286
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,640
Hey, hey, take a look at this then, because you were a magic.

287
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,200
I don't know how to drop it.

288
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,240
Where is it?

289
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,279
It's dead.

290
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,079
Don't delete it.

291
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,849
Watch out, bird.

292
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,779
So the difference between this one and the last time we played this.

293
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,619
OK, it's leaving.

294
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:10,339
All right, well, whatever.

295
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:16,980
So this is a new seed and it's the best enemy in the game.

296
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,150
My jumping higher.

297
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,250
Maybe there's a lot of there's a lot of very small changes.

298
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:31,160
You might notice like sitting at the the bonfire.

299
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,119
The animation is quicker in reforged.

300
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:34,680
It is.

301
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,000
All right.

302
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,839
So let me let me level up.

303
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:39,480
And I believe your jump animation starts sooner.

304
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:43,049
So there's a lot of tiny things.

305
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:43,930
Well, I definitely need this.

306
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,210
So I'm going to put it in there.

307
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:50,470
So are we just trying to get to let's do one of the little dungeons over here.

308
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,069
Let's like, yeah, let's go for it.

309
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:53,269
Yeah, let's respawn the enemies again.

310
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,390
Let's like kill one enemy and then like let's respawn them again.

311
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,190
Well, I had to level up.

312
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,990
You told me to level up.

313
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,549
OK, well, I had to not level up.

314
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:03,029
OK, so let's kill let's kill the crab again.

315
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,230
No, just get on your horse and let's go to the place we need to go.

316
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,589
Well, no, there's the done.

317
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:09,190
Come back right now.

318
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,109
Get back here right now.

319
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:12,549
There's the catacomb in this area.

320
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:15,430
Oh, there is sword that you need to use ashes of war.

321
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,369
We have to have like the big enemies spawn here.

322
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:31,529
Yes, this this this ant is a boss.

323
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:32,329
Where even am I?

324
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:37,190
Whoa, valid questions.

325
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,700
Whoa, I'm going to die.

326
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,539
Bro, you're getting three fingered.

327
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
You can't use that until I actually have the power.

328
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:47,740
OK.

329
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:52,490
Oh, you just got to Claude.

330
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,920
Wait, why can I do this?

331
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,500
Your sword's ashes of war is going to be randomized with the album.

332
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,460
What the fuck?

333
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:07,180
Yeah, so this one is the stab myself.

334
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,130
I got the kill yourself poison sword.

335
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:19,240
Jesus treasured furious.

336
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:23,910
Holy shit.

337
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,470
OK, hold on.

338
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:30,150
Plus one holy damage percent plus one extra magic damage taken.

339
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:33,349
I said that so badly.

340
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,470
One extra damage.

341
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,829
It's like a two year old.

342
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:42,410
I take extra magic damage.

343
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,740
Look, look, daddy.

344
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,819
Look, daddy, magic damage.

345
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:48,940
Daddy, look.

346
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,339
And then the dad never looks.

347
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,960
Bro, come on.

348
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:01,579
Oh, also, another thing I know is it's easier to to deplete poison enemies

349
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:03,339
because they don't regenerate it as quickly.

350
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:06,710
Give me one sec.

351
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,549
Move this out of the way, move this out of the way, move this out of the way.

352
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:15,769
Oh, fuck, please don't kill me.

353
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:16,660
I'm hyping.

354
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,529
I mean, you you you stop moving in the middle of Main Street.

355
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,809
For some reason, I think there was going to be anything over here.

356
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:27,509
I thought like we killed it all.

357
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:41,559
That thing is so bad.

358
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:44,630
Dude, stop swinging.

359
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,190
Can you help me?

360
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,549
I'm going to die.

361
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:47,509
No, I am.

362
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,630
I probably am going to die, too.

363
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:50,579
Let's just reset it.

364
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:51,619
Let's just come back here.

365
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:53,460
No, we killed everything.

366
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,819
Please, please don't do it.

367
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:04,579
I'm helping.

368
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:04,980
I'm coming.

369
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,180
This thing's going to kill you.

370
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,339
He's the last thing we got to kill.

371
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:09,299
Well, let's ignore him then.

372
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:09,779
Come over here.

373
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,059
We just got to go in the basement.

374
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,259
Fuck.

375
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:15,539
I thought I could keep him staggered.

376
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:15,859
I'm dead.

377
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,680
I said ignore him.

378
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,160
I know, but you're going to die in the basement over there.

379
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,759
There's no enemy in here.

380
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:23,720
That's just a chest.

381
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:28,890
Well, whatever.

382
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,299
It doesn't matter.

383
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,859
It really kind of does.

384
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,980
You shouldn't downplay.

385
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:39,319
It matters that you're dead.

386
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:39,559
All right.

387
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:40,599
I got to get a lot of people.

388
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,440
I got to get I got to get into the swing of things here.

389
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:58,920
OK, you respond.

390
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:01,769
I'm back.

391
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,289
Don't die.

392
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:16,150
OK, let's fight the crab.

393
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:19,930
No, we're going up.

394
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:20,650
Let's do what you said.

395
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,410
Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid.

396
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:34,900
But yeah.

397
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,220
I'm avoiding that should.

398
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,710
I don't even know how that hit me straight from here.

399
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,190
Follow me.

400
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:45,720
Cave.

401
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:52,500
Yeah, in in going in cave in cave.

402
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,900
OK, the whetstone knife.

403
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,700
Perfect.

404
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:04,180
Pretty good piece of equipment there.

405
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:09,529
Uncommon magic moon veil.

406
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:12,069
So what are the rarities?

407
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:13,670
Is it is a common uncommon?

408
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,430
I have like an ancestral.

409
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,309
It's Diablo.

410
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:19,109
So I imagine it's Diablo.

411
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,200
But also, I don't know.

412
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,400
I actually think they were kind of weird.

413
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,319
There's like a like above legendary.

414
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,000
There's like epic super ultra mythic.

415
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:31,369
And then there's a beyond good and evil.

416
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,609
That can never come out.

417
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:38,900
No, it didn't.

418
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:43,589
The second one was like really supposed to be coming out, right?

419
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:45,109
Yeah.

420
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:48,309
But then they started trying to outsource their game to random people to make.

421
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,710
And then I haven't heard anything about it since then.

422
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,940
All right.

423
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,579
So we're good.

424
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,180
We got what we needed from here.

425
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,170
Ready to rock and roll?

426
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:00,970
Rock and roll in which direction?

427
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,009
My what we should do.

428
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:05,130
Here's what I'm going to propose.

429
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:07,180
Summer jail.

430
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,220
Summer jail.

431
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,500
Storm but not summer.

432
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:13,140
Today is a lizard.

433
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,859
Just a little off.

434
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:17,779
It's that's I read the S.

435
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,460
Jail.

436
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,329
I'm very confused on where we're going.

437
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,809
I want to go to the ever jail.

438
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:27,849
Hold on.

439
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:28,970
Okay.

440
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,220
Okay.

441
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,619
Storm Hill ever jail.

442
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:41,299
Not summer jail.

443
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,880
It's behind us.

444
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:47,750
Can we go up?

445
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,509
Oh, no, we have to go through Stormville Castle.

446
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:49,750
Okay.

447
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,170
So you would go up that hill and then you turn around and hook left.

448
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:07,829
Yeah, we could just go game progress or we could try to wrap around there.

449
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,640
I mean, remember, we're like level zero.

450
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,799
I know that you got spoiled last run and you got like five remembrances by this point.

451
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:18,039
Right.

452
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,960
But you're actually very low level right now.

453
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,759
Did you jump off?

454
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,519
I went down here.

455
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:26,460
I mean, we really you know what it is.

456
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,779
The map is revealed and it's like freaking me out.

457
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:30,940
Like being able to see literally every single thing in the game.

458
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:34,019
Like, I don't know what I don't know where to go

459
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,259
because my brain's like look at every single thing is here.

460
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,779
Would you like to be to mode it?

461
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,299
I think we just go up here.

462
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,579
Okay.

463
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:54,920
What a mess.

464
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,640
Oh, my God.

465
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,680
What the fuck is that?

466
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:12,819
Okay.

467
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,019
Did I birdie good?

468
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,539
Yeah.

469
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:18,059
So we could let's try to fight whatever this is.

470
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,299
There's got to be a bonfire right here, right?

471
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:22,039
No.

472
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:24,680
But if you die in here, it just puts you here, doesn't it?

473
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,079
As long as we say the statue.

474
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:28,359
Yeah.

475
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,240
Yeah.

476
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,119
Statue right there.

477
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,220
Let's go into the summer jail.

478
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:47,140
It was the storm hill ever jail storm jail some real jail.

479
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,500
The words just mixed together.

480
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,940
Well, that should be easy.

481
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,740
Listen, this is a good fight to do to fear like I load it into the game.

482
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,220
Let's go.

483
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:59,819
We're so dead.

484
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:06,259
Is there a phase two as well?

485
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,119
Probably.

486
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:14,940
Okay.

487
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,339
Good luck.

488
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,440
Where are they?

489
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:34,599
Are they?

490
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,240
Where'd he go?

491
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,920
Where did who go?

492
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,099
Wait, are you coming back in?

493
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,349
No, I died.

494
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,910
I just died too, but it's not.

495
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:46,710
Okay.

496
00:33:47,109 --> 00:34:02,039
I'm not going to touch a bonfire.

497
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:02,279
Yeah.

498
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,409
You feeling okay?

499
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,119
I mean, if you saw my screen, you'd be pretty confused.

500
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:24,679
I got a bike's war sphere, which is well, probably it won't have the same ash of war

501
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,139
on my screen right now.

502
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:35,690
You are in the ever jail still and summer in the summer summer hill.

503
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,769
I think I was going to say summer hill jail.

504
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,469
I don't know why this is the S blended into the other word.

505
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,539
I touched a bonfire.

506
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:47,260
Are you okay?

507
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,260
I am back alive.

508
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,989
Did you respond at the stake?

509
00:34:57,989 --> 00:34:59,829
I respond at the stake near the jail.

510
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:03,110
I would recommend coming up here to the bonfire

511
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,349
because there's a charge to your flask along the way.

512
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:12,300
Um, and I don't think that we should be picking fights like spawning into the game

513
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,300
and then fighting Godfrey Godford fry in the summer jails.

514
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:16,539
No.

515
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,539
Okay.

516
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:21,500
So let me get my souls.

517
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,420
Did I even have any souls?

518
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,699
Probably not.

519
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,400
I had 2000.

520
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,199
All right.

521
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:34,760
I'm coming to you.

522
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,250
I mean, there also is always the chance that we go to fight Morgoth.

523
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,409
And it like really now because the randomizer is a little bit more random.

524
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,650
We could be getting that mad soldier.

525
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,579
Oh, I would love that.

526
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,789
Or or or whoa.

527
00:35:58,789 --> 00:35:59,269
Wait a minute.

528
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:03,159
I just got like I got like a legendary thing.

529
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:03,480
Hold on.

530
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:11,860
Rare bolt charge dragon communion seal of the something.

531
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:14,809
Okay.

532
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,059
What the hell?

533
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:20,900
I got like a rare legendary helmet.

534
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,840
Night sorceries by 30% strengthen them.

535
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,400
Holy shit.

536
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,340
Are you going to use sorcerers at all?

537
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,460
I have no idea what I'm doing.

538
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:37,320
I kind of had a plan, but then, uh, we die if we try and do anything.

539
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,639
All right.

540
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,800
With this, what happened?

541
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,369
I thought you touched another thing.

542
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:45,610
Okay.

543
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:48,889
You know, it's the complexity of these mods can creasing.

544
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:53,800
Okay.

545
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,519
There you go.

546
00:36:54,519 --> 00:37:05,190
I feel like this is probably not even as good as it's not.

547
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,409
All right.

548
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,360
So we have a million options.

549
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,639
Option number one is to just go fight whoever's up there.

550
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:19,639
Like you said, option number two is to go check out, you know, one of the shacks.

551
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:26,599
I think we should do some of the easier catacombs and get some more random mythic items and level

552
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:29,960
up because it requires 60 strength to use my weapons that I currently have.

553
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,840
I basically have nothing.

554
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,679
So then let's go do one of the catacombs.

555
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah, we don't have any smithing stones.

556
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,639
We don't have anything.

557
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:43,159
Remember we played this recently and we were pretty strong.

558
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,400
Uh, we're not, we don't have anything.

559
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,199
Yeah.

560
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:49,159
I think it could, because we just did randomizer and we just did this.

561
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:52,039
My brain's almost like, oh, oh wait, we're new characters.

562
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:56,840
You're blaming a lot of this on your brain, but I feel like you are the one in control

563
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,400
of your brain.

564
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,349
You ate meat.

565
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:02,309
That was over 16 hours.

566
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:03,030
You don't get to say anything.

567
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,610
And I lived and I was fine.

568
00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:15,750
Isn't there a merchant man in here?

569
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,309
I think so.

570
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:17,929
And then up the road.

571
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,210
Some ways there's a catacomb.

572
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:27,739
All right.

573
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:28,860
Where did, okay.

574
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,659
Bernard.

575
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:30,539
What should we say to Bernard?

576
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,179
What do you mean?

577
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,219
Should we say my faith holds firm?

578
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,260
Yeah, sure.

579
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,460
My faith is firm.

580
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,980
I'm pretty fucking firm right now.

581
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:45,909
Ash of War.

582
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:46,630
No skill.

583
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:52,300
Um, yeah, I know a lot of this stuff too.

584
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,940
I know like the kick got buffed, like a lot of stuff that would normally be kind of bad

585
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,539
got buffed with reforged.

586
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,219
Hmm.

587
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:04,730
So I'm going to buy kick and use that instead of stab myself.

588
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:06,650
I have fire on mine.

589
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,289
Actually on this.

590
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,539
That's kind of cool.

591
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,579
Huh.

592
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:25,050
It won't let me change anything.

593
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,619
What do you mean?

594
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,190
I don't know.

595
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,670
None of my weapons are showing up in the ashes of war.

596
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:35,349
So maybe Diablo items are like hard set.

597
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:36,869
You might find them.

598
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:38,789
Is it possible you can change them out at the blacksmith?

599
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:42,409
Uh, I don't know.

600
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:44,409
It should be the same exact mechanic.

601
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:51,829
You need an item to change them.

602
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:52,309
Okay.

603
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:53,269
We have to have an item.

604
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:54,630
That's what we got in that basement.

605
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,230
I thought was the whetstone blade.

606
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,110
Don't you have to have a blacksmith do it anyways, though?

607
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,349
I don't think so.

608
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:10,710
Yeah, the whetblade.

609
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,190
We got it.

610
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,909
Anyway, let's, uh, let's go this way.

611
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:17,989
Yeah, we need to level up.

612
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:19,670
My health bar is so, how much health?

613
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,789
How much bigger do you have?

614
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:22,940
Like 14.

615
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,420
Diablo does not let you change them.

616
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,739
You can only level weapons up twice.

617
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:31,900
What do you mean when you say level weapons up?

618
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,340
Uh, that's I'm screening from chat.

619
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,619
I'm not sure what it means.

620
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:35,579
Yeah, I'm asking them.

621
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,619
What do they mean?

622
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:47,780
Okay.

623
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,969
I mean, we could see what's in Margaret's room.

624
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:52,809
Wait, like you said, what if it's a mad soldier?

625
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:55,210
There's a catacombs right up here, man.

626
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,179
You keep saying you don't know what you want to do.

627
00:40:58,179 --> 00:40:59,460
And then we go do something.

628
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,940
And then you say we could go do the thing that we're not doing.

629
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,539
Well, we just did something.

630
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:09,289
Just calling it as I'm seeing it.

631
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,289
And there's a chest in here.

632
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:16,250
Do you want to open the chest?

633
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:20,949
Or you want to just immediately abandon and go to Margo?

634
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:29,769
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

635
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:31,050
Chest on table.

636
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:35,050
You left some gold in a rift in just a common side.

637
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:36,809
Look, claws.

638
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,929
This thing's still better.

639
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:47,510
Okay.

640
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,139
Did you get something good?

641
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,980
Uh, I got a weird war pick.

642
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,780
It says inflicts damage when rolling into enemies.

643
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,530
Oh, and these claws have vacuum slice.

644
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,269
These items are pretty weird.

645
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:12,500
What vacuum slice?

646
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,780
It's a magic hammer that deals damage when I roll on things.

647
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:21,380
Vacuum slice is the gargoyle attack that shoots like the air blast in a line.

648
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:27,639
I think that I that's what I got.

649
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:28,760
I got that air blast thing too.

650
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,780
Yeah, right down this road, there should be a cave.

651
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,210
And I'm sorry.

652
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:37,690
I'm sorry.

653
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,969
Like, I'm really pushing us to do it.

654
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:41,050
I know that I'm being a bit of a I don't want to do a cave.

655
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,530
I don't want to do.

656
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,010
I want to do market the whole time.

657
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,289
We did the last run.

658
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:46,570
I want to fight market.

659
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,809
We should really do some of these starting caves.

660
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,010
I'm just I'm kidding.

661
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:50,650
I'm kidding.

662
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,170
I'm I want to do the cave.

663
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,130
I wanted to do market.

664
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,170
I wanted to go to Wendy's.

665
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,139
Actually, let me level up first.

666
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,480
Is Wendy's your your fast food of choice?

667
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,400
When you want a chicken sandwich, where are you going?

668
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:13,960
McDonald's.

669
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,239
Wait, hold on.

670
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:20,920
The original McChicken from McDonald's.

671
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,599
Not this new spicy bullshit.

672
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:23,480
Let me be honest with you.

673
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,860
The original McChicken sandwich from McDonald's.

674
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:30,460
I like it a lot.

675
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,179
But this this new spicy McChicken that they put everywhere

676
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:36,059
and they want you so badly to order that and not the original one.

677
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:37,269
Come on.

678
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:38,789
I want the original McChicken.

679
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:40,869
I don't want the spicy powder all over it.

680
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:44,139
Do you feel me?

681
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,900
I I got to be honest.

682
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,579
I I don't really know.

683
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:48,699
I don't know much about.

684
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:51,260
I didn't even know McDonald's had chicken.

685
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,500
You do.

686
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,380
Come on.

687
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,420
I've never had one.

688
00:43:56,219 --> 00:43:59,340
But you knew that McDonald's had chicken on the menu.

689
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,500
I know that they have chicken nuggets.

690
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:04,860
Well, that I mean, that counts.

691
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:12,360
I didn't know that McDonald's had chicken.

692
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,780
That's like saying I didn't know that Campbell's had soup.

693
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:17,929
Hold on.

694
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:18,809
Hold on a second.

695
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:20,090
One guy.

696
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:25,699
OK, never mind.

697
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:26,739
It's a weird comment.

698
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:30,019
And it was just stir healthy and based.

699
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:33,940
He doesn't know McDonald's has chicken, therefore healthy and based.

700
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,789
I like that.

701
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,340
I don't know.

702
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,260
Like, there's so many places now that like specifically would call themselves

703
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,940
like we're chicken places.

704
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,139
So for you to pick McDonald's to be the best chicken sandwiches.

705
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:50,539
I don't know.

706
00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:51,099
It surprised me.

707
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:53,820
I didn't even know that they did it because I haven't been in a McDonald's in a long time.

708
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,420
The thing is, I went to a McDonald's.

709
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:00,219
It was the only ones I've really went to are like New York, like in the subway.

710
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:01,579
This guy's really hard, by the way.

711
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:05,820
He's going to kill you in one hit.

712
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,480
Healthy and based.

713
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,289
Well, I didn't say here's the thing.

714
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:18,570
Oh, my God, my game crashed.

715
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,059
That's not fair.

716
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:21,940
It's not fair.

717
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,420
I didn't say that it's not the best.

718
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,099
I don't think it's the best chicken sandwich, but it hits pretty well.

719
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,739
That was the question, though.

720
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:34,579
Yeah, but it kind of is the best for me, even though it's not quality wise.

721
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:36,019
It's not the best sandwich.

722
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:38,900
I would say for me, I prefer.

723
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:45,239
Oh, that's not good.

724
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:45,960
What's not good?

725
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:48,659
It didn't open three times.

726
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:49,059
Hold on.

727
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,699
Is this you just acting out that you don't want to do this cave?

728
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:04,519
That would be actually pretty funny.

729
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:08,940
But no, the issue is McDonald's.

730
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,539
You know exactly what you're getting every time.

731
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:13,320
It's incredibly consistent.

732
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,719
A McChicken from McDonald's is the same McChicken

733
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,119
that has been to the last 10 years.

734
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:19,960
But unfortunately, now they added the spicy shit on it.

735
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:22,840
So it's not consistent.

736
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,280
Unfortunately, it's not consistent.

737
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:31,110
Well, I mean, in a way, that backs up your argument

738
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:35,400
that they changed something one time and it upset you

739
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,159
that they should have been consistent.

740
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:38,940
They should have been.

741
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,179
All right.

742
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:41,420
Normally, they are back.

743
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,300
Did you kill that thing?

744
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:43,260
I did.

745
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,780
Can you put your thing down?

746
00:46:47,289 --> 00:46:48,570
My thing should be down.

747
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,809
Well, I wonder if I spawn in a weird place.

748
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,449
I'm going to separation, miss.

749
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:54,250
Did you join me?

750
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,369
Did you try and join me?

751
00:46:55,369 --> 00:46:57,340
I just did.

752
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,139
I was separating.

753
00:46:59,139 --> 00:47:00,099
I'm now alone.

754
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:01,940
I'm wandering.

755
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,929
I'm looking for you.

756
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:06,889
I have appeared.

757
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:14,460
Well, kind of.

758
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:22,980
OK, the quality of your Diablo weapon is what material you need.

759
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,539
And then all Diablo items can only be plus two.

760
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:28,980
OK, so you are you still?

761
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,139
I'm still in that catacomb.

762
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,969
I don't know if it put me in your game.

763
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:38,809
I don't see you on the mini map on the compass.

764
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:42,250
I never said you joined my world.

765
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,880
That's interesting.

766
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:50,329
Maybe I can't do it down here.

767
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:59,159
Maybe because the catacombs make you like you can't fast travel to and from them.

768
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,710
Says I'm going to know.

769
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,420
OK, let me go back to the bonfire.

770
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,099
Wait, no, it does say you were in my game.

771
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:09,079
OK, you joined.

772
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:13,210
Hey, that was weird.

773
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:13,610
There you are.

774
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:14,730
Yeah, it must just bugged up.

775
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:22,679
Yeah, McChickens for me were just like, oh, yeah, of course, I like my chickens.

776
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:23,480
I'm going to order a chicken.

777
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,380
Of course, I will.

778
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,989
A lot of other places that I've been to, it was not that consistent.

779
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:32,630
And I know it's just like a patty, right?

780
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:33,909
That's why it was consistent for me.

781
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:40,019
Have you gone to the McDonald's in Japan?

782
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:41,460
No, I heard it's good, though.

783
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,460
Well, you're saying they're consistent everywhere.

784
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,949
But have you been everywhere?

785
00:48:46,949 --> 00:48:47,269
I did.

786
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:49,590
I've not been outside outside of North America.

787
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:58,820
Well, then is the McDonald's consistent outside of your limited small bubble worldview?

788
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:59,219
I guess.

789
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:05,800
I don't know.

790
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,440
Whoa.

791
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,840
OK, you were you were just fighting nothing on my screen.

792
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,440
And it just poured it in and I can't hurt it.

793
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:12,730
Can it hurt me?

794
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:20,570
I don't know.

795
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,050
I don't know what's happening.

796
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:24,409
I'm poisoned.

797
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:25,610
It hurts.

798
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:26,730
Oh, he's poisoned.

799
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,739
I'm going to die.

800
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:29,539
I'm running back.

801
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:30,500
I have a lot of souls.

802
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:35,159
All right.

803
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:37,400
What's your favorite chicken sandwich?

804
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,500
Oh, boy.

805
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,940
Yeah, I have infinite stamina, too.

806
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,269
Yeah, that's part of a reforged.

807
00:49:47,269 --> 00:49:49,590
I'm going to die like right as I touch this.

808
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,230
Oh, lucky.

809
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:56,889
I don't like there was that big craze a while ago where every person in America was literally

810
00:49:56,889 --> 00:50:00,250
murdering people for like the Popeye's chicken sandwich, right?

811
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,130
That's why I thought like you were going to have some like exclusive.

812
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,889
Like I killed a guy for the sandwich.

813
00:50:06,389 --> 00:50:07,829
I don't like a lot of places.

814
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:09,750
But I don't really care that much.

815
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,710
It seemed like the kind of thing you would care about.

816
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,349
No.

817
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:16,630
Oh, I got to eat every chicken sandwich from every.

818
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,949
Why do you think I care that much about chicken sandwiches?

819
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:27,030
It like falls under the category of like fast food or cereal, which is like one of your biggest.

820
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:31,909
Dude, the last bowl of cereal I ate was honey bunches of oats with strawberry.

821
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:33,989
Back in fucking 2019.

822
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:39,179
You talk about cereal mascots so often that it just seems like.

823
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:40,380
Oh, I can't be a fan.

824
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,739
I can't be a fan of cereal.

825
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:43,179
I have to like eat every cereal.

826
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:44,139
I can't just like cereal.

827
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:45,500
I can't just like watching the cereal.

828
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,179
I can't like enjoy watching like the characters.

829
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:48,539
Do they do commercials?

830
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:50,150
Oh, I gotta go level up.

831
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:50,710
What?

832
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:51,989
I got distracted.

833
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:54,389
Hey, I was the one that was supposed to be dumb today.

834
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:55,670
I got 4k souls.

835
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:56,869
OK, we're just starting.

836
00:50:56,869 --> 00:50:58,650
I got a level.

837
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:03,849
Yeah, like watching the cereal like mascots, you know, do their fucking vlogs that they do.

838
00:51:03,849 --> 00:51:04,090
What?

839
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:07,289
You watch you watch the cereal mascots do their vlogs.

840
00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:10,889
You're following them on Insta when they do like their makeup tutorials.

841
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:13,929
And Captain Crunch is like, oh, you want to look like a pirate?

842
00:51:13,929 --> 00:51:19,139
Are you telling me that if Captain Crunch had a YouTube channel where he was like,

843
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:24,840
oh, hey, Crunchtastic Cruncheteers, me, Captain Crunch, you wouldn't watch every single one?

844
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,719
I don't even watch the Gorillaz YouTube channel.

845
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:29,000
And that's basically what that is.

846
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:32,170
No, no, no, no.

847
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,289
We're talking like Captain Crunch is doing what Chuck E. Cheese did.

848
00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:36,570
He's like streaming Elden Ring.

849
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,139
You wouldn't watch that?

850
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,659
Captain Crunch is streaming Elden Ring.

851
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:44,019
I will take a look.

852
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:45,460
Yes, you of course you would.

853
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:49,239
I probably would not stay longer than like a minute.

854
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,000
I would have to look.

855
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:58,550
He's got a rare.

856
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:00,809
Oh, nice rare.

857
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:14,199
Poison plus three and yeah, we saw how streaming worked for the mascots.

858
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:15,400
Yeah, but here's the thing.

859
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,760
Chuck E. Cheese didn't talk.

860
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,130
The Chuck E. Cheese that streamed didn't talk at all.

861
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,860
Oh, watch out for this guy.

862
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,260
This guy.

863
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:30,659
Captain Crunch was screaming on Twitch and he was like, oh, my Captain Crunch cereal.

864
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:32,340
He said that before every single sentence.

865
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,780
People would fucking go crazy for it.

866
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:36,710
Get wrecked.

867
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:37,670
The Chappy Challenge.

868
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:48,309
It would suck.

869
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:48,869
No, it wouldn't.

870
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:49,349
It'd be fun.

871
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,190
For a minute.

872
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,349
Oh, this guy again.

873
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,570
I think that never mind.

874
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:10,469
He like leaves them like the camera on or something.

875
00:53:10,469 --> 00:53:11,909
He like leaves like hot mic on.

876
00:53:13,909 --> 00:53:15,190
Oh, that's kind of funny.

877
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:21,780
I had you all see when Captain Crunch hot mic'd.

878
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:26,389
You know what?

879
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:29,190
I'll see you in a moment for some more Kevin Crunch gameplay.

880
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,230
And it's like you hear shuffling.

881
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:33,159
You hear like fucking hate this fucking game.

882
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,019
I just fucking hell in the ring millennia.

883
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:39,510
I've just bought millennia.

884
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,869
Piece of fucking garbage.

885
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,340
I feel like we're not far off from a future.

886
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:49,820
Like it always takes the corporations like five years to catch on to trends.

887
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:55,820
Five years from now, Captain Crunch AI generated stream down here.

888
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,099
Jeremy, it's going to happen.

889
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:00,539
And I think we go in this secret tunnel door.

890
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:00,860
Okay.

891
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:02,539
Is it gone?

892
00:54:03,179 --> 00:54:09,739
Okay.

893
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:21,400
Oh, oh, did you just got crunchetized?

894
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:24,739
I would know.

895
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:27,219
I would want Captain Crunch to play a street fighter or something.

896
00:54:27,219 --> 00:54:27,539
Right.

897
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:31,539
Are you uncomfortable when the kids in the commercial are like crunchetize me, Captain?

898
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:32,820
And he's like an old man.

899
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:37,059
And like all these kids are super excited to like get on his boat alone with him.

900
00:54:37,059 --> 00:54:38,739
Well, I always thought the tricks rabbit was weird.

901
00:54:39,699 --> 00:54:42,099
Like, oh, silly rabbit tricks for kids.

902
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:43,860
And he's just like, oh, give me that box.

903
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,179
It's like what you can't just.

904
00:54:46,179 --> 00:54:48,500
Why do you have to like, why can't you just buy one?

905
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,289
I don't know.

906
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,250
I got a dragon.

907
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:52,889
Hold on a minute.

908
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:53,289
They would wait.

909
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,010
They were taking it.

910
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:55,289
They were taking it from him.

911
00:54:55,289 --> 00:54:56,250
I got it the wrong way around.

912
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,449
The kids are stealing it from him.

913
00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:58,329
Yeah.

914
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:06,280
Why silly rabbit tricks are for kids.

915
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,119
Like he wasn't allowed to eat them.

916
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,159
Yeah.

917
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,780
And then the rabbit would starve.

918
00:55:13,699 --> 00:55:14,739
I think there was a different one.

919
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:16,500
Like the the cookie crisps.

920
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,780
That was the wolf.

921
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,300
I think that was trying to steal.

922
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:21,349
Watch out.

923
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:22,630
Grandma.

924
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:26,090
Corner grandma.

925
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:29,210
When he said America is so stupid.

926
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:37,050
Come on now.

927
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:41,210
America is so stupid because what we have because we have Captain Crunch.

928
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:44,280
Captain Crunch is a legend.

929
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:55,690
Oh, it's the Elden Lord.

930
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,539
Who is it?

931
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,449
It's you.

932
00:55:59,449 --> 00:55:59,929
Oh, it's.

933
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:01,369
Oh, we'll go.

934
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:02,969
Oh, my God.

935
00:56:02,969 --> 00:56:03,530
What the heck?

936
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:08,409
Take this.

937
00:56:08,409 --> 00:56:11,210
My Captain Crunch cereal will knock you out of your park.

938
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,320
Take that.

939
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:14,860
Sir.

940
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:17,420
Got to protect the captain here.

941
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,590
I could fucking do it.

942
00:56:21,269 --> 00:56:32,570
Can you imagine Captain Crunch just becomes like a huge streamer.

943
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,260
The number one streamer is Captain Crunch.

944
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:38,619
I wouldn't even care.

945
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,760
I mean, do you care who it is now?

946
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:45,800
I mean, I don't even who is like.

947
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,820
I would care more if it was Captain Crunch.

948
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:51,579
That'd be kind of a wild.

949
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:54,300
Hey, VM.

950
00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:04,010
All the cereal mascots have like huge channels.

951
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:10,710
That would be so fucked up.

952
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:16,500
Oh, OK.

953
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,780
We need to actually look at this stuff.

954
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,239
Ancestral star scourges, profit trousers of grit.

955
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,650
These names are definitely Diablo item names.

956
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,659
OK.

957
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:33,960
And there's a chest over here.

958
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,840
I don't think I can really even put these on.

959
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,739
This is strength scaling off of intelligence.

960
00:57:43,739 --> 00:57:47,030
OK, strengthens death sorceries by 10 percent.

961
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:49,590
Poison moth flight.

962
00:57:49,590 --> 00:58:00,250
OK, that's kind of cool.

963
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:09,179
Mind triggers every 2.8 seconds plus one HP every three seconds.

964
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:14,539
What the hecky dude strengthens gravity sorceries by 30 percent.

965
00:58:14,539 --> 00:58:16,300
Yeah, they get they get kind of wacky, don't they?

966
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:20,650
An arc plus three on the same item.

967
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:21,610
They do.

968
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:24,250
They do for sure get kind of wacky with it.

969
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:26,010
OK, not that any.

970
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:28,920
Well, I guess some of the gravity spells are pretty strong.

971
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,960
I don't want to be fat rolling.

972
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,690
I can't wear this.

973
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:32,329
All right.

974
00:58:32,329 --> 00:58:40,619
Why do we start a new run?

975
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:51,059
Because we have two new mods on and we're just trying to see how fun it is.

976
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:55,610
We have the Diablo to loot and then.

977
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:00,969
Elden ring reforged and randomizer and seamless co-op.

978
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:05,829
Fire damage dealt and I have fire.

979
00:59:05,829 --> 00:59:07,429
I guess I'll use it, I guess.

980
00:59:07,429 --> 00:59:20,940
Returning to entrance and you were trying to go faith magic.

981
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,690
I want to do faith arcane if we can.

982
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:36,949
If I can actually figure out how to turn on the warlock class subclass, whatever it is.

983
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:39,110
OK, I'm really not sure we're going to be able to do that.

984
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,739
Well, it's all right.

985
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:45,739
All right.

986
00:59:45,739 --> 00:59:47,590
15 vigor.

987
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:50,179
That's better than 10.

988
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:55,260
Still fat rolling.

989
00:59:55,260 --> 01:00:01,420
Oh, my God.

990
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,699
I don't know why I thought friendly fire was on.

991
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,980
That was an enjoyable adventure amongst traveling companions.

992
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,059
It was enjoyable.

993
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:16,579
But now we actually have stuff.

994
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:22,170
Read the lore on some of the items.

995
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:27,130
When every single misbegotten revealed every single misbegotten's greatest falsehood,

996
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:30,650
they wore this legendary restorative foot soldier cap of the Mad Tongue

997
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:33,940
to show their love for dominula.

998
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:34,659
All right.

999
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:36,260
Are they randomized?

1000
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,639
I might be.

1001
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:39,880
When Margit attacked the fire giants,

1002
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:45,079
they wore this legendary knight's dialios mask, flaunting their allegiance to Hieta.

1003
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:49,639
What about this uncommon club?

1004
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,710
When a commander, when a commander stole a shard of destined death,

1005
01:00:54,710 --> 01:01:00,550
they swung this uncommon club so that the knight of the black knives would never reoccur.

1006
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:00,869
Okay.

1007
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:07,429
Yeah, they used this ancestral bolt charge club to win the hand of Merchant Kale.

1008
01:01:12,099 --> 01:01:17,699
When Zorias forged the Elden Ring, they struck their enemies with this

1009
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:20,739
common duelist greataxe of the novice mage,

1010
01:01:20,739 --> 01:01:23,780
but it was not enough to save their trusted friend Margit.

1011
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:29,860
Pretty good.

1012
01:01:30,949 --> 01:01:31,750
Oh, what the?

1013
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:36,659
Not bad.

1014
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:37,139
Pretty good.

1015
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:38,840
All right.

1016
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,159
Cool.

1017
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,889
Say, where do you want to go?

1018
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:51,579
Far away from that enemy.

1019
01:01:51,579 --> 01:01:55,579
Isn't there usually like an item back here that's relevant?

1020
01:01:56,469 --> 01:01:57,590
We can go do Margit.

1021
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,949
That was kind of your thing.

1022
01:01:58,949 --> 01:01:59,670
We did my thing.

1023
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:00,469
We can do your thing.

1024
01:02:00,469 --> 01:02:02,550
We can do trade-offs, you know?

1025
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:04,250
That sounds fun.

1026
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:07,849
I want to get some spells.

1027
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:10,250
The lance talisman.

1028
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:15,980
That was a lance talisman for me too.

1029
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:16,539
What does that do?

1030
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,429
Okay.

1031
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:30,460
To Margit, who is going to be like millennia.

1032
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:35,750
That would be very sad.

1033
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:46,440
Go to the foot of the urn tree and become Elden Lord now.

1034
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:52,039
I mean, is there anything else to do?

1035
01:02:52,599 --> 01:03:04,340
I thought that was Kenneth height.

1036
01:03:05,739 --> 01:03:08,139
That's a pot boy on the hill.

1037
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:09,739
Anyone else there?

1038
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:17,699
I'm kind of leading you in a direction that is the opposite direction of Margit.

1039
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:19,460
I know that I'm doing that.

1040
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,139
No, I'm aware, but we don't have to.

1041
01:03:21,139 --> 01:03:22,179
We can just do whatever.

1042
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:24,099
I was kidding when I said we had to do Margit.

1043
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:24,340
Jump.

1044
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:27,500
My goodness.

1045
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,139
I didn't make it.

1046
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:30,599
And we go this way.

1047
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:31,239
There's another cave.

1048
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:32,360
You want to do another cave?

1049
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:32,599
Yeah.

1050
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:39,500
This is my ancestral great club charged with bolts.

1051
01:03:40,059 --> 01:03:43,179
And it's going to make merchant Kayle want to marry me.

1052
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,889
Where the heck are you going?

1053
01:03:47,769 --> 01:03:48,969
I think you got to go up this.

1054
01:03:59,159 --> 01:03:59,800
Right?

1055
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,159
I know there's one here.

1056
01:04:01,159 --> 01:04:02,760
It's probably down here.

1057
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:11,079
Turtle meat.

1058
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:14,739
Right here.

1059
01:04:16,539 --> 01:04:17,659
Oh, shoot.

1060
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:21,480
We don't got any torches looking like a dark one.

1061
01:04:23,369 --> 01:04:26,420
I wrote a cave and it could be darker.

1062
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:31,460
I heard you love that game.

1063
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,860
I love dark and darker.

1064
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:34,659
Oh, man.

1065
01:04:34,659 --> 01:04:36,019
I've been addicted, man.

1066
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:38,420
Like, I really just love when I get the item.

1067
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,380
I think you're just a hater.

1068
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:40,820
I know.

1069
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:41,219
I know.

1070
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:43,539
That's what they all think.

1071
01:04:44,179 --> 01:04:45,849
That's what they're all thinking.

1072
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:54,630
You feel any more new or two?

1073
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,119
Yeah, I got to like near the end of it.

1074
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:00,760
They're still getting the game is very long.

1075
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,559
Are you enjoying it?

1076
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:02,840
What?

1077
01:05:06,179 --> 01:05:07,619
He grabbed me from such a weird angle.

1078
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:13,269
Yeah, I was liking it.

1079
01:05:13,269 --> 01:05:15,750
I was just getting a little exhausted.

1080
01:05:16,469 --> 01:05:17,349
I played a lot.

1081
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:18,630
I had like 60 hours in it.

1082
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:21,829
I was like, I'm doing pretty good on that.

1083
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:25,530
I'm still pressing some Neo buttons while we're playing, but.

1084
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:26,650
It happens.

1085
01:05:27,369 --> 01:05:28,489
I don't know what happens.

1086
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:32,570
Hey, you want to go down and there's a giant vacuous tunnel.

1087
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:35,639
Only if we go together.

1088
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,659
Just you, me.

1089
01:05:38,659 --> 01:05:39,300
Grab my hand.

1090
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:47,050
Captain Crunch, the Cocoa Puffs bird, Tony the Tiger, all of us in our party.

1091
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:55,420
You would collab with, I mean, that's a ton of eyeballs.

1092
01:05:57,719 --> 01:05:58,679
A ton of eyeballs.

1093
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:00,920
All the Tony the Tiger fans tuning in.

1094
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,679
How many boxes of Frosted Flakes have you ever eaten?

1095
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,400
These are way more famous than anybody on here.

1096
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,539
How much money would you value?

1097
01:06:10,789 --> 01:06:12,789
You, specifically you getting.

1098
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:16,710
Oh, my fucking God.

1099
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:18,630
There was an explosion person here.

1100
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:21,030
I just kind of watched.

1101
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:22,230
So you want to spectate or?

1102
01:06:22,869 --> 01:06:23,829
I mean, I guess you have to.

1103
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:25,190
I can't touch the bonfire.

1104
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:28,469
You got to hold the L.

1105
01:06:28,469 --> 01:06:31,349
I mean, I respond, but.

1106
01:06:31,349 --> 01:06:32,230
Oh, did you?

1107
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:35,829
Yeah, it's very dark down.

1108
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:36,469
I can't see.

1109
01:06:36,469 --> 01:06:37,909
It's so dark and darker.

1110
01:06:37,909 --> 01:06:39,909
It's like someone's been turning all the lights off.

1111
01:06:39,909 --> 01:06:42,920
I'm just going to come down there.

1112
01:06:44,409 --> 01:06:45,989
Help, help.

1113
01:06:45,989 --> 01:06:47,110
I'm going back.

1114
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:47,670
I'm scared.

1115
01:06:50,309 --> 01:06:52,630
How much would you value Frosted Flakes for life?

1116
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:54,329
Like monetary value?

1117
01:06:54,329 --> 01:06:54,650
OK.

1118
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:59,050
You're like I can pay right now to unlock all of the gods and smite,

1119
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:02,760
but it's actually Frosted Flakes for life.

1120
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,880
I don't really.

1121
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,019
I mean, I don't.

1122
01:07:05,019 --> 01:07:08,860
When you open your cabinet, there will be a fresh box of Frosted Flakes there.

1123
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:09,579
Whenever you want.

1124
01:07:09,579 --> 01:07:12,219
Did you go down the second fall?

1125
01:07:12,219 --> 01:07:15,989
Like in the hole?

1126
01:07:15,989 --> 01:07:16,869
I don't know where you are.

1127
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:19,289
Did you go down the second drop down?

1128
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:20,730
I'm where you died.

1129
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:22,250
There's multiple drop downs.

1130
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,449
I destroyed the fire.

1131
01:07:23,449 --> 01:07:25,530
I'm there's a single candle.

1132
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:29,900
I died right here.

1133
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,300
Here.

1134
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,260
Here we are.

1135
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:31,579
All right.

1136
01:07:31,579 --> 01:07:32,139
OK.

1137
01:07:32,139 --> 01:07:36,760
Now to the left, you can clearly see that there's a tunnel.

1138
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,320
Yeah.

1139
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:42,019
But what you're saying, what's the monetary value for that be worth it to me?

1140
01:07:42,579 --> 01:07:43,139
Yeah.

1141
01:07:43,139 --> 01:07:47,269
When I open this cabinet, it's filled with it every time.

1142
01:07:47,269 --> 01:07:53,030
Humble bundle, choose your own price, but be fair of what the value is.

1143
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:54,789
Well, then I don't care.

1144
01:07:54,789 --> 01:07:58,150
Like so I open up my cabinet and it's like I get to decide

1145
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:00,949
what I pay for a box of Frosted Flakes today.

1146
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:01,510
Is that what you're saying?

1147
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,230
No, no, no.

1148
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,670
You pay up front.

1149
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:03,909
OK.

1150
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:06,469
You pay like a hundred dollars now if you think that's fair.

1151
01:08:06,469 --> 01:08:08,550
And then you get Frosted Flakes for life.

1152
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:09,590
OK.

1153
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:11,349
But can I give this to other people?

1154
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:12,630
No.

1155
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,190
This is why I said specifically for you.

1156
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:16,710
So I can't like open up this cabinet.

1157
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,909
Scarlet rotting us in a cave where we can't see.

1158
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:21,430
Well, you wanted to come down here.

1159
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:23,510
No, forget.

1160
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:25,029
Don't forget who wanted to come down here.

1161
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:29,369
I'm just saying we're having this conversation while we're dodging them

1162
01:08:29,369 --> 01:08:32,090
and not actually fighting them or trying to leave.

1163
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:32,970
OK, so here we go.

1164
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:37,850
If I could give it to people, I would just keep opening the cabinet

1165
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:41,289
and just putting boxes and boxes into like a storage facility

1166
01:08:41,289 --> 01:08:42,810
and then people can just take it.

1167
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:46,250
Like it would be like a never ending supply of food, right?

1168
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,210
You cannot do that.

1169
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:47,529
Stop.

1170
01:08:47,529 --> 01:08:48,090
You're cheating.

1171
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:51,100
OK.

1172
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,840
Well, then so well, then who cares about I don't like,

1173
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:57,000
I can just go get it to the grocery store.

1174
01:09:02,329 --> 01:09:04,819
Oh, three HP a second.

1175
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,189
I put it on.

1176
01:09:07,829 --> 01:09:09,300
Holy shit.

1177
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,100
This thing's cool looking.

1178
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:15,100
I had some HP per second pants or something.

1179
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:23,189
I also have some pants that regenerate F.P.

1180
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:25,239
F.P.

1181
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:27,420
Oh, the pants.

1182
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:28,140
I have a pretty good.

1183
01:09:28,939 --> 01:09:31,420
It's got bleed.

1184
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:32,539
I don't think I can really use it.

1185
01:09:32,539 --> 01:09:33,420
I need more strength.

1186
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:35,819
OK, make sure you don't die.

1187
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:38,619
Noob.

1188
01:09:38,619 --> 01:09:43,100
What's the most you would consider paying for one normal size box of frosted flakes?

1189
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:48,500
Yeah, and then multiply that times your life expectancy of like three weeks.

1190
01:09:49,539 --> 01:09:55,659
I don't I I don't eat that much cereal.

1191
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:57,579
Dude, I'm getting so many items.

1192
01:09:57,579 --> 01:10:00,380
I know I'm getting like an overwhelming amount of things to look at.

1193
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:02,460
Oh, but there's a big boy.

1194
01:10:10,819 --> 01:10:16,710
I also I swear one of us killed themselves and put it on easy mode.

1195
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:19,029
I don't think that happened.

1196
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,189
I do think that happened.

1197
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:24,789
Well, it had to have been you because you're the one that coached me through pressing the buttons.

1198
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:29,430
Oh, this thing is a taunt.

1199
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:34,310
I don't want this either that or like we are getting like mythic God weapon

1200
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:35,989
and they're just dealing a shit ton of damage.

1201
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,229
I think that's probably more accurate.

1202
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,340
Where do you drop here?

1203
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,380
You just drop right here.

1204
01:10:46,649 --> 01:10:48,250
I believe you.

1205
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:48,489
Yes.

1206
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:52,550
Oh, can you make this jump?

1207
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:53,909
I hope so.

1208
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:00,899
Nope.

1209
01:11:00,899 --> 01:11:03,220
Oh, damn it.

1210
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,260
Fucking God damn it.

1211
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,819
This game is absolutely fucking broken.

1212
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:09,300
How could anybody want to play a game like this?

1213
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:09,619
Stir.

1214
01:11:09,619 --> 01:11:12,520
It's really great collabing with you.

1215
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,720
Make sure to check out my Kevin Crunch new all Crunch Berry cereal.

1216
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:17,159
God damn it.

1217
01:11:21,529 --> 01:11:25,850
Ah, I couldn't make the jump.

1218
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:26,489
I wait.

1219
01:11:26,489 --> 01:11:27,050
I'm up here.

1220
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:30,619
I'll make it.

1221
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:35,079
No, this is fine.

1222
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:37,720
I thought I was going to get knocked down like away from everything.

1223
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:45,180
Good save.

1224
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:45,500
Thanks.

1225
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:46,939
Yeah, good save.

1226
01:11:47,579 --> 01:11:51,659
What was that?

1227
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,720
Stop doing that.

1228
01:11:55,829 --> 01:11:56,869
He's going to keep doing that.

1229
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:01,659
Okay.

1230
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:06,979
You don't like frosted flakes.

1231
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:09,220
But too long.

1232
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:09,699
Didn't read.

1233
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:12,340
I don't eat that much cereal.

1234
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:13,460
You're okay.

1235
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,020
What do you eat?

1236
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:17,140
If you don't eat cereal, what?

1237
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,420
Oh, what that?

1238
01:12:18,979 --> 01:12:19,770
I don't know.

1239
01:12:23,979 --> 01:12:26,220
Oh, I thought I thought that was one of those things

1240
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,979
that like shoot you from the ceiling.

1241
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:29,420
Oh, no, it's an albinoeric.

1242
01:12:34,979 --> 01:12:36,979
There's supposed to be something going on in here.

1243
01:12:37,539 --> 01:12:41,300
There's usually a giganto octa in here.

1244
01:12:44,329 --> 01:12:45,850
Oh, nice teamwork.

1245
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:48,920
Nice.

1246
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:54,779
I can't believe you wanted to come in here

1247
01:12:54,779 --> 01:12:55,899
without even getting the lantern.

1248
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:59,300
Well, how hard would it be to talk to you

1249
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,819
to tell you that I want to go by the lantern

1250
01:13:00,819 --> 01:13:03,140
from the specific lantern spot before you got distracted?

1251
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:07,560
Two minutes.

1252
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:13,050
Are we going to drop here?

1253
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:17,159
Look if this is the right.

1254
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:18,439
Yes, this is the right way.

1255
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:22,630
Oh, this is the right way.

1256
01:13:25,689 --> 01:13:26,569
To top yourself off.

1257
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,170
Don't be an idiot.

1258
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:31,899
You can mean top myself off.

1259
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:32,779
Heals.

1260
01:13:33,579 --> 01:13:34,789
Don't be an idiot.

1261
01:13:34,789 --> 01:13:35,670
I'm full HP.

1262
01:13:37,029 --> 01:13:37,270
Okay.

1263
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:37,670
You ready?

1264
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,300
Are we both using club?

1265
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:43,880
Yeah, because the only thing we can both use.

1266
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:46,899
Okay.

1267
01:13:46,899 --> 01:13:47,779
We need stats.

1268
01:13:50,069 --> 01:13:52,310
Guardian Gary Garris.

1269
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:53,590
Oh, no, it's Gary.

1270
01:13:55,029 --> 01:13:56,069
Of course, Gary.

1271
01:13:56,069 --> 01:13:56,710
Who could forget?

1272
01:13:58,579 --> 01:14:01,140
Wait, it's Gary and a bunch of other.

1273
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:01,699
What?

1274
01:14:01,699 --> 01:14:02,979
I don't know what these are.

1275
01:14:02,979 --> 01:14:04,260
It's motorbike snails.

1276
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:07,460
Gary.

1277
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,229
All right.

1278
01:14:10,229 --> 01:14:11,430
These things are actually kind of dangerous.

1279
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:16,460
This is definitely uneasy for me.

1280
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,699
What do you mean uneasy?

1281
01:14:19,739 --> 01:14:23,899
Reborn has like a difficulty setting and I must have picked one.

1282
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:25,579
I don't know.

1283
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:28,979
What is that?

1284
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,880
Oh, fuck off, Gary.

1285
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:45,420
Oh, don't call me Guardian Garris.

1286
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,939
My friends call me Gary.

1287
01:14:47,739 --> 01:14:50,859
Okay.

1288
01:14:51,659 --> 01:14:55,000
I got a bunch of shit.

1289
01:14:59,289 --> 01:14:59,609
Okay.

1290
01:14:59,609 --> 01:15:00,970
This is more sorceries.

1291
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:05,029
Okay.

1292
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:05,829
What about this shit?

1293
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,020
Golden order incantations.

1294
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,779
Stamina regen by 8%.

1295
01:15:10,779 --> 01:15:15,100
That's actually kind of good, but no.

1296
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:20,899
I've got the planets.

1297
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:30,229
I love that weapon.

1298
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:33,350
Do you want this baby rattle that is also the moon veil?

1299
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:36,630
Or no, this is just a regular katana attack.

1300
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,500
I use that in my regular playthrough.

1301
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,319
Pretty fun.

1302
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,420
I don't think I wanted to act like a katana, though.

1303
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,180
That seems really kind of bad.

1304
01:15:48,979 --> 01:15:49,460
Okay.

1305
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:50,180
Well, you're bad.

1306
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,380
We got to go to a bonfire.

1307
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:53,060
Make sure it's not on easy mode.

1308
01:15:53,779 --> 01:16:01,619
I'm starting to understand it.

1309
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:04,310
I get it.

1310
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:09,460
We just need stats first so we can actually put some of this stuff on.

1311
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,619
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1312
01:16:13,619 --> 01:16:15,850
This is physical damage.

1313
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:19,659
Physical damage.

1314
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:20,539
We got to teleport.

1315
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:21,979
Has to happen.

1316
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:25,590
Okay, hold on.

1317
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:29,300
All right, let's go.

1318
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:32,979
I posted pictures of the mod's menu trees in the Discord.

1319
01:16:32,979 --> 01:16:34,180
What?

1320
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:34,659
A hero?

1321
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:40,069
A hero is the right word.

1322
01:16:40,069 --> 01:16:44,949
Oh, they're fully labeled with red lines on what they lead to.

1323
01:16:44,949 --> 01:16:45,270
Really?

1324
01:16:46,279 --> 01:16:46,920
Jesus.

1325
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,039
Wow, that's actually amazing.

1326
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:54,810
This has the stomp.

1327
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:58,920
Isn't this thing insane?

1328
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,159
Sir, this thing's broken, right?

1329
01:17:03,529 --> 01:17:05,529
They nerfed it a lot, but it is very strong.

1330
01:17:05,529 --> 01:17:08,279
Okay, I'll take it.

1331
01:17:11,819 --> 01:17:13,100
Oh, hold up.

1332
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:15,850
That's why I was confused earlier.

1333
01:17:16,649 --> 01:17:16,890
Yeah.

1334
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:27,050
We don't have a fortunes menu that we're supposed to have.

1335
01:17:27,939 --> 01:17:30,420
I don't know what enables that to exist.

1336
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:32,100
I thought you had it from the beginning in Reforge,

1337
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:35,060
but underneath flasks it's supposed to be fortunes and we don't have it.

1338
01:17:35,619 --> 01:17:35,859
Okay.

1339
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:38,460
And I don't know why not.

1340
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,140
I think we need an item, somebody said.

1341
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:50,060
You need an item and you buy it from Kayle.

1342
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:54,149
Okay, let's go warp to Kayle.

1343
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:54,390
Okay.

1344
01:18:00,869 --> 01:18:03,109
Oracle's Effigy is what we need.

1345
01:18:03,829 --> 01:18:08,789
Trying to go there.

1346
01:18:08,789 --> 01:18:09,909
It's doing that thing.

1347
01:18:09,909 --> 01:18:11,270
I can't go.

1348
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,069
We'll have to try it again.

1349
01:18:12,949 --> 01:18:20,550
Wait, is it earlier than Kayle?

1350
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:24,550
An item you pick up at the first bonfire after you go up the elevator.

1351
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:26,310
Yeah, we just ran right past that.

1352
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:29,189
Oh, so like the graveyard or like the first step?

1353
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:30,390
The first step.

1354
01:18:31,109 --> 01:18:40,010
Okay.

1355
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:46,409
Oh, oh, I don't know.

1356
01:18:46,409 --> 01:18:47,850
I thought there was an item down there usually.

1357
01:18:50,729 --> 01:18:51,779
I'm starting to understand it.

1358
01:18:51,779 --> 01:18:52,340
I'm starting to get it.

1359
01:18:53,699 --> 01:18:58,579
It was a lot of overwhelming items and stuff and I think I'm getting it.

1360
01:18:58,579 --> 01:19:03,770
It's supposed to be that first stake.

1361
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:07,689
We might have gotten it somewhere else then.

1362
01:19:07,689 --> 01:19:08,569
Okay.

1363
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:13,659
I think somebody tried to give me directions very early on saying.

1364
01:19:13,659 --> 01:19:14,779
Is there an item there for you?

1365
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:20,949
There was, but I think it was just the pick it up just absentmindedly.

1366
01:19:23,909 --> 01:19:27,829
I know that the item that is usually there we picked up like in that dungeon

1367
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:30,069
because it's usually like a furled finger or something.

1368
01:19:30,789 --> 01:19:34,359
I don't see anything new.

1369
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,989
You buy it from Kayle on the patch you're currently on.

1370
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:39,750
It's there on the newer patches.

1371
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:40,310
Okay.

1372
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:40,710
Okay.

1373
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:40,869
Yeah.

1374
01:19:40,869 --> 01:19:45,529
We're on an old patch so that it works with Diablo items.

1375
01:19:45,529 --> 01:19:46,170
Okay.

1376
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:48,300
So now let's just get over there then.

1377
01:19:57,579 --> 01:19:59,819
My mom brought me fish sticks and garlic bread.

1378
01:19:59,819 --> 01:20:00,619
This rules.

1379
01:20:00,619 --> 01:20:01,739
That sounds pretty good actually.

1380
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:06,119
He's not selling anything particularly interesting.

1381
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:06,920
No.

1382
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:19,130
No, not really.

1383
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:19,289
Yeah.

1384
01:20:19,289 --> 01:20:22,810
We had to do a bunch of goofy shit to get these to even run together.

1385
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:24,250
So maybe we just can't do it.

1386
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:27,220
It's all right.

1387
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:30,680
You buy a torch though.

1388
01:20:31,239 --> 01:20:37,699
I do want to level up.

1389
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:47,770
Hmm.

1390
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:54,579
I want to do faith and arcane but I'm kind of scared that my endurance is literally eight.

1391
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,579
So I'm going to fix that.

1392
01:20:57,220 --> 01:21:23,130
Okay.

1393
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:24,890
Follow sit down for a second.

1394
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:32,090
Reforge is not really compatible with randomizer plus DSL just with okay.

1395
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:34,279
Okay.

1396
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:36,680
Do event text for talk the top one.

1397
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:36,920
Okay.

1398
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:41,210
Then do the top one.

1399
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:41,529
Okay.

1400
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:48,840
Then three down.

1401
01:21:49,899 --> 01:21:51,899
So you mean like one, two, three.

1402
01:21:51,899 --> 01:21:52,539
Fourth one.

1403
01:21:52,539 --> 01:21:52,859
Yeah.

1404
01:21:52,859 --> 01:21:53,979
The fourth one, three down.

1405
01:21:53,979 --> 01:21:54,380
Okay.

1406
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:54,859
Say yes.

1407
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:56,140
Then say yes.

1408
01:21:56,779 --> 01:21:57,659
What the fuck?

1409
01:21:57,659 --> 01:21:57,899
Ow.

1410
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:00,710
What did you do?

1411
01:22:01,829 --> 01:22:04,630
That you have to die but that's to change the difficulty.

1412
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:07,829
The difficulty changing kills you so you don't like carry over souls

1413
01:22:07,829 --> 01:22:12,550
or I don't know what their rules are but that made sure that we're both like on actual.

1414
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:13,829
There's a normal difficulty.

1415
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:15,350
We're on adept mode.

1416
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:15,770
Okay.

1417
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:16,970
We're co-oping like why not?

1418
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:19,770
Oh, don't look at Ronnie when you respawn.

1419
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:21,289
Are you actually being serious?

1420
01:22:21,289 --> 01:22:28,619
You're not being serious, right?

1421
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:30,140
No, I'm not being serious.

1422
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:35,579
You're such a joker.

1423
01:22:39,289 --> 01:22:40,890
One too many mods.

1424
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:44,579
I forgot I left that one in for my personal archives.

1425
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:46,979
Will you shut the fuck up?

1426
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:50,359
Okay.

1427
01:22:50,359 --> 01:22:54,460
Bell's over there.

1428
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:59,020
Ring my bell.

1429
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:02,260
So I got this new item.

1430
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:03,619
Things got that frost stomp.

1431
01:23:03,619 --> 01:23:05,779
I think we'd be able to stomp through the castle.

1432
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,890
It goes a little bit like a wha-bam.

1433
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:10,170
It goes a little bit like a wha-bam.

1434
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:11,529
It goes a little bit like a wha-bam.

1435
01:23:12,979 --> 01:23:13,539
Damn.

1436
01:23:13,539 --> 01:23:15,300
You look like a bro.

1437
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:15,619
Thanks.

1438
01:23:16,439 --> 01:23:19,159
You were scaling intelligence and arcane, you said?

1439
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:21,880
I'm doing arcane and faith.

1440
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:26,739
I want to do frenzied fire with three fingers.

1441
01:23:26,739 --> 01:23:30,680
So if I had like a faith arcane weapon.

1442
01:23:31,859 --> 01:23:42,569
I would probably use it if you had it.

1443
01:23:42,569 --> 01:23:42,890
Okay.

1444
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:45,609
He would probably use it.

1445
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,880
How about we go kill Margo?

1446
01:23:52,439 --> 01:23:55,430
I think we could at this stage.

1447
01:23:55,430 --> 01:24:03,800
What did that do?

1448
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:05,510
It's a bow.

1449
01:24:06,069 --> 01:24:06,310
Okay.

1450
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:12,020
I have a strengthens night sorceries by 30%.

1451
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,420
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1452
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:15,300
I just got a lot of...

1453
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:17,460
I didn't look at one or two things

1454
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:20,020
because they're throwing a million items at us.

1455
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,079
Okay.

1456
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:28,890
All right.

1457
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:30,810
Let me buy some arrows.

1458
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:31,850
I'm going to keep the strength one on.

1459
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:35,899
I'm poor.

1460
01:24:35,899 --> 01:24:36,380
Never mind.

1461
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:37,340
I bought one arrow.

1462
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:39,020
Okay.

1463
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,020
Let's teleport to storm hill shack.

1464
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:42,300
Yeah.

1465
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:44,260
And let's go fight Margaret.

1466
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:45,460
Why not?

1467
01:24:52,659 --> 01:24:53,060
Yeah.

1468
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:53,699
Why not?

1469
01:24:53,699 --> 01:24:55,460
I can't wait to open up Margaret

1470
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:56,500
and it's going to be Shrek.

1471
01:24:58,039 --> 01:25:00,600
Is our warp like not working again?

1472
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:01,880
It does it sometimes.

1473
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,159
Do it again.

1474
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:09,989
Hey, how about we go down here to this cave?

1475
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:12,069
We could do that too.

1476
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:13,449
Hey, follow me.

1477
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:17,130
The universe was telling me through its bizarre powers.

1478
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:19,050
You need the dingleberry drinker mod

1479
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:19,850
if you want to drink.

1480
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:20,090
Yeah.

1481
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:24,899
I'm sad the classes thing is so goofed.

1482
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:31,380
Yeah.

1483
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:34,180
The new gimmick for this stream here.

1484
01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:37,539
We have the Diablo 2 Ludon, a new randomizer seed,

1485
01:25:37,539 --> 01:25:40,180
and then Elden Ring reforged,

1486
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:42,899
which we probably can't use some of the stuff with it,

1487
01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:45,220
but we're just trying to we're just checking it out, you know?

1488
01:25:45,939 --> 01:25:46,579
Yeah.

1489
01:25:46,579 --> 01:25:47,859
It's pretty big overhaul.

1490
01:25:47,859 --> 01:25:48,500
We're checking it out.

1491
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,060
Mechanics.

1492
01:25:49,779 --> 01:25:59,819
We're just seeing what happens.

1493
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,640
I mean, anything could happen at any moment.

1494
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:11,979
Even right now.

1495
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:15,460
Something could be happening that we don't know about.

1496
01:26:18,229 --> 01:26:20,069
Well, I this weapon is probably way better.

1497
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:22,979
I'm going to be doing that frost stomp.

1498
01:26:22,979 --> 01:26:24,020
It's going to be so insane.

1499
01:26:25,159 --> 01:26:26,199
You don't even have any idea.

1500
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:29,270
Frenzy flame doesn't scale with arcane.

1501
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:31,829
The oh, wait.

1502
01:26:31,829 --> 01:26:34,550
OK, so the warlock class that I can't choose

1503
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:38,699
scales frenzied flame with it changes things.

1504
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:39,659
So but I can't do that.

1505
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:41,180
So all right, I need to figure out what to do.

1506
01:26:42,119 --> 01:26:44,140
Um, shit.

1507
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:44,779
Hold on.

1508
01:26:44,779 --> 01:26:49,180
I don't want you can't drop it from the equipment on you, right?

1509
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:51,340
I think it has to be in your inventory.

1510
01:26:55,739 --> 01:26:56,460
It's just faith.

1511
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:57,340
OK, cool.

1512
01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:03,539
It's still decent.

1513
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:07,579
Well, it lights up the hallway, so that's helpful.

1514
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:09,659
I'm curious if this is good for you.

1515
01:27:09,659 --> 01:27:10,539
I dropped a weapon here.

1516
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:19,479
Ancestral tempered lightning likes war spear.

1517
01:27:19,479 --> 01:27:29,909
OK, three in three arcane stamina minus 18 percent.

1518
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:34,420
I need I don't have the stats for it, but I'll definitely keep it on.

1519
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:37,210
OK, cool.

1520
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:42,020
Oh, yeah, I'll use it eventually.

1521
01:27:45,689 --> 01:27:47,130
All right, let's let's explore this cave.

1522
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:49,369
Oh, I have another faith one.

1523
01:27:49,369 --> 01:27:51,689
Actually, this one might also be cool.

1524
01:27:51,689 --> 01:27:52,409
I'm just going to drop it.

1525
01:27:52,409 --> 01:27:53,130
You can look at it later.

1526
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,420
It just I know I didn't drop it.

1527
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:55,979
Never mind.

1528
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:57,420
Let's just let's just go.

1529
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:58,779
Let's just let's just let's just game.

1530
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:03,100
Game on.

1531
01:28:03,819 --> 01:28:05,260
Oh, I have F.P. Regen.

1532
01:28:09,239 --> 01:28:11,560
I mean, this is like kind of all right, I think.

1533
01:28:13,319 --> 01:28:15,560
I mean, you killed shit that was not on the screen.

1534
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:19,460
I can't I'll be torch guy.

1535
01:28:23,989 --> 01:28:27,029
It's not really helping, but it's kind of doing stuff.

1536
01:28:27,029 --> 01:28:28,149
It's like staggering people.

1537
01:28:29,029 --> 01:28:34,939
It's OK.

1538
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:36,159
It's not bad.

1539
01:28:36,859 --> 01:28:42,819
This is the ancient ancestral dragon's torch of light seeing.

1540
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:45,369
Is that what it actually is called?

1541
01:28:45,369 --> 01:28:46,489
No, I made that one up.

1542
01:28:47,859 --> 01:28:49,380
Demi human chief soldier.

1543
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:51,340
Watch out.

1544
01:28:57,979 --> 01:28:59,500
Are you sure it's not you put it on easy?

1545
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:09,220
OK, rare, rare lightning night rider flail of shadow walking.

1546
01:29:10,579 --> 01:29:12,420
Treasured talisman of restoration,

1547
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:14,739
treasured minor invigorating bloodhound.

1548
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:18,659
I dropped like his whole house.

1549
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,140
This guy was moving.

1550
01:29:22,739 --> 01:29:25,380
You had a you haul in this frickin little room.

1551
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:26,659
OK, hold on a minute.

1552
01:29:27,989 --> 01:29:29,109
Oh, look at that.

1553
01:29:29,109 --> 01:29:31,529
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look.

1554
01:29:31,529 --> 01:29:34,569
Strengthens frenzied flame incantations by 10 percent.

1555
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,039
Where do you usually get your first frenzied flame?

1556
01:29:40,039 --> 01:29:42,039
Because like the item that's not random,

1557
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:43,159
we can go get that for you.

1558
01:29:43,159 --> 01:29:44,119
I just want them all.

1559
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,859
That's what I mean.

1560
01:29:46,859 --> 01:29:47,979
We can we can go get them.

1561
01:29:48,699 --> 01:29:50,460
I've never done it, so I don't really know where they are.

1562
01:29:52,579 --> 01:29:54,739
Well, I'm sure someone in your chat will make a fully

1563
01:29:54,739 --> 01:30:05,819
fleshed out diagram labeled which one of these is more efficient 3fp every 2.5

1564
01:30:05,819 --> 01:30:13,560
before fp every 3.5 which one mathematically it gets you more and you

1565
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:18,579
don't want to play path of exile no you're gonna ask that question and you

1566
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:30,859
don't want to play okay but yeah we just got in a lot of stuff or HP fire damage

1567
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:34,100
I'm gonna keep that one on all right cool oh this is fun I like this this

1568
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:40,619
is actually really cool yeah I didn't expect that like this much to get thrown

1569
01:30:40,619 --> 01:30:45,619
at us I think it was very easy to get very confused and overwhelmed in the

1570
01:30:45,619 --> 01:30:49,140
first like 45 minutes to an hour so I think we're good did you go back to the

1571
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:53,340
word you go through I ran up to the dragon communion area and that's all

1572
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:58,909
like all that's all the same so we can go warp to the shack now do the shack let

1573
01:30:58,909 --> 01:31:05,029
me just yeah because if you have it then I should have it too then right the

1574
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:15,029
I love this shack you got a shadow walk-in weapon okay I wonder what that

1575
01:31:15,029 --> 01:31:22,939
does if these mods are funny this this armor strengthens bestial incantations

1576
01:31:22,939 --> 01:31:32,329
by 10% strengthens bestial incantations by 10% neat it just does them both but

1577
01:31:32,329 --> 01:31:38,149
they're the same when the frenzied flame left grandsacks behind they presented

1578
01:31:38,149 --> 01:31:42,909
this rare madman skeletal mask of the fire Giants to hide among the peasants

1579
01:31:42,909 --> 01:31:57,420
fleeing limb grave that's pretty crazy lore let me level up I'm gonna just dump

1580
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:06,359

hold on sit back down sit back down are we doing another we are we're doing

1582
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:18,960
another kill ourselves difficulty change yes okay because there is a co-op

1583
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:24,729
difficulties and I feel like that might be overriding though it doesn't have an

1584
01:32:24,729 --> 01:32:29,770
easy it only has normal and hard and master it like that should be fine okay

1585
01:32:29,770 --> 01:33:03,699
hold on frenzied flame frenzied flame read more descriptions when Hayatah

1586
01:33:03,699 --> 01:33:07,659
joined the militia protecting Farramazula they domed this treasured

1587
01:33:07,659 --> 01:33:11,960
emboldened talisman of restoration as they liked how it looked that's it

1588
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:18,260
that's all the war nights on horseback are deadly foes they see all below from

1589
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:22,579
their lofty position meeting little meaningful resistance as they charge

1590
01:33:22,579 --> 01:33:45,859
ahead it's accurate yeah they liked it they like the way it looked you'll get

1591
01:33:45,859 --> 01:34:06,770
that come on I got it nice watch out it's the perfect human all right

1592
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:24,520
market what do you got I deleted them I killed him all right who's in here but

1593
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:35,119
your foolish ambitions to waste skip we already know the oh Leo Leo nine

1594
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:46,619
misbegotten the fellow man I I was like I was mashing role and I never rolled

1595
01:34:46,619 --> 01:35:23,010
you got this whoa how come I didn't roll excuse me excuse me no I'm fine what

1596
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:27,729
though no no really though no no no really though no no really though what

1597
01:35:27,729 --> 01:35:34,090
I didn't dodge through that no no like really though huh really though I dodged

1598
01:35:34,090 --> 01:35:39,239
right into it like there was no iframe you saw do you literally saw that that

1599
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:42,640
freeze-frame that that has me very concerned because I saw a lot of people

1600
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:49,560
on the reforge saying that their dodge rolls had no iframes the mod you're

1601
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:57,060
using removes iframes no it does not does it I know that you can stand still

1602
01:35:57,060 --> 01:36:00,659
and roll and you do this move and that definitely has iframes wait hold on

1603
01:36:00,659 --> 01:36:06,720
there's a different dodge I know that dodges but I think I thought dodges still

1604
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:16,850
could dodge the iframes are different in the mod yeah should we try this when you

1605
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:22,649
change difficulties like hard changes the amount of iframes you have what let

1606
01:36:22,649 --> 01:36:47,140
me try the new one but that didn't really help but it didn't work good luck

1607
01:36:47,140 --> 01:37:01,430
like I just got lucky on that that was too early no how do you play a from

1608
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:10,569
software game without iframes that seems like oh mega difficult we have to parry

1609
01:37:10,569 --> 01:37:25,600
everything my game crashed there probably is iframes but it's probably

1610
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:30,970
somebody just said in chat and this is true yeah I don't want to do this I

1611
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:33,649
would like to remove that because we're going to change our muscle memory

1612
01:37:33,649 --> 01:37:40,029
completely and it's gonna ruin every single other game you ever play wait

1613
01:37:40,029 --> 01:37:43,550
what's gonna ruin your muscle memory changing if there are iframes if there

1614
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:47,109
and we have to learn where they are then we're never gonna be able to play Elden

1615
01:37:47,109 --> 01:37:52,159
Ring ever again normally they're supposed to be the same on normal I did

1616
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:56,840
have us choose adept so maybe the iframes are like slightly changed and

1617
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:04,649
we should just switch back to normal mode if that were the case but I did see

1618
01:38:04,649 --> 01:38:11,890
a lot of people in the mod comments being like hey my dodge doesn't work hmm

1619
01:38:11,890 --> 01:38:17,239
and I was kind of praying like that won't happen to us I'm opening my world

1620
01:38:17,239 --> 01:38:23,760
to you and I'm gonna walk you through choosing normal mode okay was it's way

1621
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:29,609
harder it was way harder this way it'll be easier to play the regular game it's

1622
01:38:29,609 --> 01:38:35,170
just tighter iframes wouldn't that just make you better at the game no I don't

1623
01:38:35,170 --> 01:38:40,920
think so because it then you lose opportunity to dodge with more iframes

1624
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,479
and I think would actually make you play worse because the there's only there's

1625
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:48,720
only one way to dodge and getting that perfect iframe then when you play

1626
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:52,039
normally it's like you're gonna get hit because you did it wrong you know what I

1627
01:38:52,039 --> 01:39:03,260
mean you get it why is she here once we actually I have to oh I'm

1628
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:27,640
table Melina can you go away no she's fine you're just touching me all right

1629
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:44,159
what incantations do you have okay lame ones for losers lame sling lame

1630
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:50,710
fortification eel I don't want to heal I just want like the frenzied flame

1631
01:39:50,710 --> 01:40:14,989
catch flame and flame sling catch flame is godlike okay um we need to exhaust

1632
01:40:14,989 --> 01:40:32,260
some dialogue here right so we have we both of the smithing stone change but we

1633
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:42,579
only need one so that's good yeah yeah although I don't really have enough

1634
01:40:42,579 --> 01:40:53,779
money sell random items could yeah I guess I'll just upgrade the hell out of

1635
01:40:53,779 --> 01:40:59,989
this thing and again the Diablo items only need to be upgraded twice and

1636
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:07,100
that's their max okay but upgrading a mythic or whatever is better than

1637
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:14,439
upgrading a common and they require bigger stones so it's like a life steal

1638
01:41:14,439 --> 01:41:24,680
with lightning damage dex weapon and just get rid of it I want it strength

1639
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:37,239
plus two poison moth light Frank holy shit this thing I'm gonna hold on to

1640
01:41:37,239 --> 01:41:57,779
this cuz cuz it's kind of crazy so I got a plus two yeah I'm ready to go

1641
01:41:57,779 --> 01:42:02,319
yeah I'm ready to although I do want wait I don't want to buy this other

1642
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:28,239
thing be quiet I want to get this catch flame you feel this is good I've never

1643
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:36,560
done any of this before I don't know is it any good a lot of it again with

1644
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:48,239
reforged history is balanced differently sparks flame from hand okay I'll try it

1645
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:59,220
I'm ready to go back to market we have better weapons now I mean you do oh wait

1646
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:03,979
the actual is lit the shop what if there's anything there it's not random

1647
01:43:03,979 --> 01:43:21,920
so no it's not random okay um okay and then when you get here we're gonna sit

1648
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:27,640
back down and we're gonna normal mode and hope that it has something to do

1649
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:35,250
with the dodge frames that's what we can hope I feel like I've dodged things I

1650
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:48,130
don't know at what point what happened um event text the top one okay the top

1651
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:59,489
one mm-hmm down to yes okay hitting yes what did you do what did you do what did

1652
01:43:59,489 --> 01:44:10,500
you do oh my god what did you do I messed up you fucking idiot god wrong

1653
01:44:10,539 --> 01:44:30,050
one I hope we can dodge making making me so angry all right because I don't buy

1654
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:34,449
that there's like oh there's a smaller amount of dodge frames cuz I was it

1655
01:44:34,449 --> 01:44:37,689
didn't even look like I was rolling the way I was getting hit like I must have

1656
01:44:37,689 --> 01:44:48,420
been hitting them pretty early to not even roll at all go test it I have I

1657
01:44:48,420 --> 01:45:11,340
frames again oh yeah I look looks yeah I do as well maybe ish well it's enough

1658
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:35,739
for us to kill him yes enough yes we got it

1659
01:45:35,739 --> 01:46:01,979
ooh spell blade gloves talisman talisman carrying sword sorceries Santa

1660
01:46:01,979 --> 01:46:09,850
Frutata dude wild strike I forgot is like you can't stop you so is magic damage

1661
01:46:09,850 --> 01:46:13,010
fire damage or is it fire damage because I guess I should put this on it's fire

1662
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:24,270
damage all right well now I can level up now the question becomes this I'm not

1663
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:29,859
gonna blow up my character again I'm trying to do frenzied flame so that is

1664
01:46:29,859 --> 01:46:35,140
that just only faith I want to be like the the eyes you know burning and

1665
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:41,229
everything like that I believe that would only be faith so I should do faith

1666
01:46:41,229 --> 01:46:48,649
and then enough strength index to put whatever item I want and then just

1667
01:46:48,649 --> 01:46:57,680
vigor and endurance vigor is a pretty good ability that people like vigor you

1668
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:01,079
should look at extra life like a normal person I don't think you know what we

1669
01:47:01,079 --> 01:47:17,850
have activated every item is completely random could be anything magic damage

1670
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:20,890
isn't fire bro I don't think you I don't think you understand what's going on

1671
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:28,000
right now guys I don't think you understand the type of danger that

1672
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,520
you're in I don't think you get it I think I'm just gonna go let's just do

1673

flame do more damage it was spam oh no idea what you're talking about my are

1721
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:58,220
talking about I understand there's there's no buff criteria the seal that

1722
01:55:58,220 --> 01:56:04,220
I use is frenzied flame get buffed does it get buffed from you know fire giant

1723
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:13,859
oh that's a weird-looking wall use the frenzy seal and level faith you're gonna

1724
01:56:13,859 --> 01:56:23,960

and the fire damage is Zeke tear okay frenzied flame seal buffs frenzied flame

1727
01:57:09,229 --> 01:57:14,539
incantations think it's fairly obvious well but that's that's not what it says

1728
01:57:14,539 --> 01:57:22,560
because this is the Diablo 2 loot version of it does that the base seal

1729
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:27,600
itself is still the same okay so the the stuff that it says on it are additional

1730
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:31,720
modifiers that it has besides the fact that it is the frenzied flame scaling

1731
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:35,279
talisman okay so that was my question it has been answered completely and I am

1744

look at what I have you for gear situation yeah how do we normally you

1752
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:44,079
gotta come in here to open this right stir humbly accepting an L is actually a

1753
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:52,000
W I mean I still think that tuna fish is disgusting but I I see how my specific

1754
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:56,640
line of thought to why it was disgusting is misguided but the thing is I feel

1755
02:00:56,640 --> 02:01:03,399
like people that say tuna is disgusting had a gross tuna at one point a great

1756
02:01:03,399 --> 02:01:07,199
childhood and a great understanding of like what food really is and they

1757
02:01:07,199 --> 02:01:14,170
weren't fed like mush's children because you know this day okay there's

1758
02:01:14,170 --> 02:01:20,649
like chunk light tuna is light tuna this solid tuna and there this is a

1759
02:01:20,649 --> 02:01:24,920
tier system with tuna fish off in the shelf at the grocery store chunk light

1760
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:32,100
tuna is I do not like it it's it's kind of disgusting I actually don't like it

1761
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:39,500
at all I think to describe it as chunk light has already got me pretty chunk

1762
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:46,489
light tuna is it's not I don't not like it it's way too it's just it's not good

1763
02:01:46,489 --> 02:01:56,210
it's pretty bad do a poll and like what's the what's the good one solid

1764
02:01:56,210 --> 02:02:03,550
albacore tuna is like just call it solid white albacore tuna like actual fish

1765
02:02:03,550 --> 02:02:09,069
not like mush chunk light tuna I don't know what the scale is but it's not it's

1766
02:02:09,069 --> 02:02:14,510
a lower quality I don't know the words you're using it's it's just to determine

1767
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:18,310
like the quality and the scale of the ingredients I don't know it's just

1768
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:23,390
chunk light tuna it just means it like really is that a real term or no no

1769
02:02:23,390 --> 02:02:26,829
that's a real term that's that is actually on could light yes I don't know

1770
02:02:26,829 --> 02:02:30,109
why I don't know why it's called that but that's like isn't this all just

1771
02:02:30,109 --> 02:02:39,930
really disgusting sounding no yeah who the fuck is this person in the lobby I

1772
02:02:39,930 --> 02:02:51,420
don't think you could describe any food as chunk light and have it sound

1773
02:02:51,420 --> 02:03:02,500
appetizing just just protect me for a second chunk light tuna chunk light

1774
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:07,739
tuna typically consists of skipjack but also may include yellowfin or big eye

1775
02:03:07,739 --> 02:03:12,699
tuna it features a softer texture and it tends to be darker in color with smaller

1776
02:03:12,699 --> 02:03:18,829
pieces and a stronger flavor that's why I don't like it there you go that's what

1777
02:03:18,829 --> 02:03:23,869
chunk light tuna is what it means and the kind you like is called solid

1778
02:03:23,869 --> 02:03:34,800
albacore well like I'm still like wouldn't just be easier to not eat tuna

1779
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:42,170
but I like solid white albacore tuna I like the way they taste I like it it

1780
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:47,819
tastes good with pretzels but wouldn't it be easier to not like it I don't know

1781
02:03:47,819 --> 02:03:53,310
what are some foods that you like that I don't like that green ketchup that green

1782
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:59,029
and purple ketchup that's like fucking weird you like that stop implying that I

1783
02:03:59,029 --> 02:04:03,350
like that no one likes that oh you know I do not watch that on my permanent

1784
02:04:03,350 --> 02:04:11,939
record you can't do that to someone I'll never work again yeah it's kind of

1785
02:04:11,939 --> 02:04:18,199
gross when you know it's over at your very place and open up the fridge you're

1786
02:04:18,199 --> 02:04:21,319
like yeah grab a snack I'm like alright and I see you got that purple ketchup in

1787
02:04:21,319 --> 02:04:25,600
there and I was like no fucking way does a human have this you you go over like

1788
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:28,439
to someone's house and they're like oh we're having burgers for dinner if you

1789
02:04:28,439 --> 02:04:30,920
want to stay in here like oh absolutely I would love that but like they

1790
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:36,439
hand you a burger and like under your bun is purple ketchup you politely gonna

1791
02:04:36,439 --> 02:04:42,989
you just gonna politely eat that you're gonna not mention it I'll eat it but do

1792
02:04:42,989 --> 02:04:52,739
you mention it no okay then you take a bite and it really tastes like it's I

1793
02:04:52,739 --> 02:04:57,859
get it's sickening it's sickening to me yeah yes you want to like gag and like

1794
02:04:57,859 --> 02:05:05,510
oh shit I went mad yeah that can happen to people too much

1795
02:05:05,710 --> 02:05:18,810
too much her pulled ketchup I feel like you're the kind of guy that would eat

1796
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:22,130
the eat the hamburger with a straight face and a smile and say no I actually

1797
02:05:22,130 --> 02:05:25,409
really like this no guys trust me I don't hate this no I actually were like

1798
02:05:25,409 --> 02:05:32,189
really actually like this but I say it that many times yes I think that that

1799
02:05:32,189 --> 02:05:37,319
was the most accurate thing of what you said of all of the whole thing you just

1800
02:05:37,319 --> 02:05:40,720
did the amount of times I say it is what's actually accurate here

1801
02:05:40,760 --> 02:06:14,949
what's up actually hurt a lot just burn ancestral stir-w randomly generated I

1802
02:06:14,949 --> 02:06:24,460
don't like tuna fish therefore you're gross come on what is this what is this

1803
02:06:24,460 --> 02:06:49,310
bullshit there's a lot of enemies out here be fine how did I not lock on well

1804
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:53,899
I just mean like if you go to the store to buy food like you still do that right

1805
02:06:53,899 --> 02:07:00,109
and then yeah like there's tuna and then there's chicken next to it then you

1806
02:07:00,109 --> 02:07:05,960
willingly chew you're choosing tuna over something is there something wrong with

1807
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:14,600
having options to eat why I don't want to honestly I believe that one day like

1808
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:18,920
people talk about you know the rapture coming and it's soon and that one day

1809
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:21,159
like the government's gonna take over and we're all gonna have to eat the

1810
02:07:21,159 --> 02:07:24,640
little pellets that they give us but like I would love to just eat pellets

1811
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:32,960
every day I knew you were gonna say that no like our dog eats the same exact

1812
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:38,119
pellets every single day every day of its life four years and it's good for

1813
02:07:38,119 --> 02:07:50,960
it and that's all it needs there's going through his dog food arc I see you just

1814
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:54,640
never on my side we're just gonna they're just not on my side you know what

1815
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:58,359
I I will agree with you on a couple small things here what that there's a

1816
02:07:58,359 --> 02:08:04,920
lot of stuff in there holy shit oh my god okay we need to take a look but

1817
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:11,479
there's bonfire up here and we can do like we have 700 items to loot okay your

1818
02:08:11,479 --> 02:08:24,180
your issue here with with this is let me let me level up this is the this is the

1819
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:27,779
strategy you hit him with a deranged argument and then you let him look at

1820
02:08:27,779 --> 02:08:36,720
his items there's no time to rebuttal I win free faith is pretty good I want the

1821
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:45,350
fire damage one I have a really good helmet for you I see it oh I'm getting

1822
02:08:45,350 --> 02:08:50,960
ready to drop okay so what's what's going on again say it again say it again

1823
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:54,439
no I think I'm good no no I wanted I do I had a rebuttal and I want to give it to

1824
02:08:54,439 --> 02:09:00,579
you and say your point again I want to eat pebbles okay I understand because

1825
02:09:00,579 --> 02:09:05,319
sometimes I think everyone's probably like this sometimes when you're really

1826
02:09:05,319 --> 02:09:09,760
busy there's a lot going on there's a lot of things happening it's like eating

1827
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:15,199
food can sometimes kind of be a pain in the ass sometimes always right and unless

1828
02:09:15,199 --> 02:09:18,399
you're like I'm out at a restaurant and this this is like really good it was

1829
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:21,720
prepared for me it's like a whole environment but if it's like day to day

1830
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:27,439
if I had the senzu beans I'd just be chomping them I would I think I would use

1831
02:09:27,439 --> 02:09:31,159
it only for purposes of hey I know tomorrow is gonna be a really busy day I

1832
02:09:31,159 --> 02:09:34,800
don't have to worry about food cuz I'm gonna take the weird pellet that's like

1833
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:39,930
700 calories and it's every nutrient I need I'll be alright I wouldn't want to

1834
02:09:39,930 --> 02:09:43,590
do that for every meal I feel like that you're kind of deleting an entire

1835
02:09:43,590 --> 02:09:51,029
purpose to be like alive as a human is like to enjoy food right like we enjoying

1836
02:09:51,029 --> 02:09:57,270
consuming food is like a huge deal what is the meaning of life eat that food

1837
02:09:57,270 --> 02:09:59,789
I'm serious I'm telling you it's probably pretty it's pretty high up

1838
02:09:59,789 --> 02:10:06,869
there I think humans getting enjoyment from food is way up there on the list

1839
02:10:06,869 --> 02:10:11,670
for you know our existence and if we weren't eating food then we might as

1840
02:10:11,710 --> 02:10:17,140
well just fucking die is what you're saying no I'm just saying that like like

1841
02:10:17,140 --> 02:10:23,310
think about it food social togetherness conversation around a table at a

1842
02:10:23,310 --> 02:10:26,630
restaurant you know what I mean like I don't think we're gonna not gonna go to

1843
02:10:26,630 --> 02:10:30,109
a restaurant and we're gonna pick the pill off the menu no fuck that I want I

1844
02:10:30,109 --> 02:10:33,789
want to take a bite of my broccolini and go oh there's garlic on here and hey

1845
02:10:33,789 --> 02:10:36,989
stir what do you think you want to try by the way how was that ball game last

1846
02:10:36,989 --> 02:10:42,579
night right I don't want to lose that my Twitter handle is stir loves food

1847
02:10:42,699 --> 02:10:50,479
that's what I'm saying somewhat I I'm aware but like I I wish there was a

1848
02:10:50,479 --> 02:10:53,720
pebble I would eat the pebble but I wouldn't want to eat the pebble for

1849
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:56,840
every meal and you are going down a path of the pet like we're eating the weird

1850
02:10:56,840 --> 02:11:02,529
like ground up whatever bugs or something pebbles I don't want to eat

1851
02:11:02,529 --> 02:11:07,449
that for every meal stir who do you think made the first sauce and I mean

1852
02:11:07,449 --> 02:11:21,159
that what what and you expect me to have I don't know hold on let's let him work

1853
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:31,579
through it who made the first sauce is there a clue in that sentence it's just

1854
02:11:31,579 --> 02:11:36,300
a question it's just a philosophical question who made the first sauce

1855
02:11:36,300 --> 02:11:41,319
philosophically who made the first sauce someone who thought their food was

1856
02:11:41,319 --> 02:11:45,779
boring but why but who what do you mean boring food was you need to eat food

1857
02:11:45,779 --> 02:11:48,899
for fuel back in like the caveman days what are you talking about why would

1858
02:11:48,899 --> 02:11:54,529
you make a sauce I'm gonna make a marinara sauce why you need food

1859
02:11:54,689 --> 02:11:58,569
tastes good it's enjoyable but your food is scarce you can't you know you can't

1860
02:11:58,569 --> 02:12:01,170
make like you get but you know you're not gonna make a sauce who made the

1861
02:12:01,170 --> 02:12:07,069
first sauce hey let me throw a counter argument back at you if all you eat is

1862
02:12:07,069 --> 02:12:14,949
pebbles what if you put those pebbles in like milk that'll be disgusting okay

1863
02:12:14,949 --> 02:12:21,260
what if you had a lifetime supply of these pebbles all right we can we can

1864
02:12:21,260 --> 02:12:28,550
we can walk and talk we can walk and talk okay what if these pebbles were a

1865
02:12:28,710 --> 02:12:37,529
little bit fruity or even chocolate who made the first sauce is all I'm saying

1866
02:12:37,529 --> 02:12:47,090
and I think like whoever made the first sauce is Jesus Christ no no no no no

1867
02:12:47,090 --> 02:12:58,600
follow him no but why I know you cannot doubt it I understand the argument of

1868
02:12:58,600 --> 02:13:02,100
and look this whole argument is fucking stupid I'm aware of that it's just I

1869
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:11,430
was I was I was having a fun time I'm I just wished like sometimes I'm sick of

1870
02:13:11,430 --> 02:13:16,029
eating you agreed and I also want to say that if you like you're like you would

1871
02:13:16,029 --> 02:13:19,909
don't eat very healthy and you're like oh man I like vegetables are so lame

1872
02:13:19,909 --> 02:13:23,789
you start eating healthier you get more used to that food and you start to like

1873
02:13:23,789 --> 02:13:27,390
dude I dude I could really go from us for some asparagus right now you know

1874
02:13:27,390 --> 02:13:30,149
how like you're a child you all you want is chicken nuggets and then you grow up

1875
02:13:30,149 --> 02:13:32,310
and you're like you know actually asparagus you know I could go from

1876
02:13:32,350 --> 02:13:36,750
asparagus right now yeah so eventually the pebbles would grow on you to the

1877
02:13:36,750 --> 02:13:40,789
point they're like dude I could really hit a bowl of pebbles why but these

1878
02:13:40,789 --> 02:13:45,539
pebbles have a flavor to them you didn't say that do they taste a certain way

1879
02:13:45,539 --> 02:13:49,729
they don't have to also you're gonna want to pick this up you ran past like

1880
02:13:49,729 --> 02:13:58,380
the golden seed tree of deliciousness yeah the ancestral beast champion armor

1881
02:13:58,380 --> 02:14:01,819
of the succubus I think I think the issue that I'm having as well as

1882
02:14:01,819 --> 02:14:04,739
everybody else not just me everyone else in chat is asking the same question

1883
02:14:04,739 --> 02:14:11,630
yeah you okay so you're eating multiple yeah a bowl of these so I thought it was

1884
02:14:11,630 --> 02:14:14,869
like eat one and it was all of your nutrition for the whole day like a bowl

1885
02:14:14,869 --> 02:14:18,630
of pet like you're an adult you have to eat more than one pebble you can't go to

1886
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:23,069
wait and dot and get one dot why would you want this why do you want to eat a

1887
02:14:23,069 --> 02:14:28,149
bowl of pebbles you're good it's just like I'm being realistic I don't want to

1888
02:14:28,149 --> 02:14:31,989
have to if I could eat one Senzu bean and be done I would love that but

1889
02:14:31,989 --> 02:14:36,189
realistically I'm gonna have to eat a bowl full of pebbles cuz I'm like a big

1890
02:14:36,189 --> 02:14:39,789
person get it on a whiteboard so I can look at it and I'll give I have one

1891
02:14:39,789 --> 02:14:51,609
final argument okay eats bowl of pebbles for nutrients okay I thought that was

1892
02:14:51,609 --> 02:14:54,529
part of the mod for a second and I was actually scared that something bad was

1893
02:14:54,529 --> 02:15:00,590
going on I don't what does that mean that's my final argument I don't I don't

1894
02:15:00,590 --> 02:15:07,029
know what that means that's your problem is that your favorite song or something

1895
02:15:07,069 --> 02:15:14,079
I don't get it how does it actually didn't know this eat the geese how am I

1896
02:15:14,079 --> 02:15:24,920
the most a zoomer there's no way I don't get it just forget it he doesn't know oh

1897
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:34,399
it's the giga Chad song yeah yeah I only know giga Chad is the face that kind of

1898
02:15:34,399 --> 02:15:42,970
appears and leans in on my face has a song I did not know that so I win is

1899
02:15:42,970 --> 02:15:48,340
what you're saying I don't want I don't want to eat pebbles I would like the

1900
02:15:48,340 --> 02:15:52,779
option to eat one pebble to have all full nutrition but that's it oh you want

1901
02:15:52,779 --> 02:16:01,819
another argument actually sure what is our Elden ring character eating lots of

1902
02:16:01,819 --> 02:16:06,619
different shit actually runes runes we're not eating the runes make us

1903
02:16:06,619 --> 02:16:10,819
stronger all we need are runes we're not eating there's nothing else that we need

1904
02:16:10,819 --> 02:16:14,380
we're not eating them we're like absorbing them it's a but they're in the

1905
02:16:14,380 --> 02:16:19,039
air it's like a gas we're not eating runes we're eating runes all right can

1906
02:16:19,039 --> 02:16:27,539
we fight this boss or are you gonna keep weirding everybody out am I like

1907
02:16:27,539 --> 02:16:33,299
chats on my side no they're not no way okay let's beat this boss first try

1908
02:16:33,299 --> 02:16:38,479
you're gonna do a poll too late and I couldn't see what it was I think that

1909
02:16:38,479 --> 02:16:50,139
actually is a Maleketh what yes Maleketh man wait why are we getting another

1910
02:16:50,139 --> 02:16:57,239
mimic here cuz that's the way it be I but why we already pop all it's all

1911
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:16,020
mimicked here now I'm not even casting I'm just cheering you on

1912
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:26,750
well is it another mimic dear there's something wrong no it's not everything's

1913
02:17:26,750 --> 02:17:42,959
great yes I got a remembrance and I got a great rune I got a lot oh yeah cuz

1914
02:17:42,959 --> 02:17:51,579
it's not it's not randomized we actually I keep forgetting wait play that play

1915
02:17:51,899 --> 02:18:12,069
that song again okay you ready mm-hmm go why do you have that ready for that

1916
02:18:12,069 --> 02:18:22,540
moment that moment right there you play that when we die to the boss yeah how

1917
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:31,139
do you not know anything about comedy keep it in mind okay go with let's go

1918
02:18:31,139 --> 02:18:44,639
25 faith let's go with yeah I also got a remembrance what is it it's uh the

1919
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:50,729
grafted do we care about this or do I just take this and level up some of the

1920
02:18:50,729 --> 02:18:58,440
stuff do we care about what the remembrances do they actually work or

1921
02:18:58,440 --> 02:19:03,319
would they be yabla it's it's it's all every item that would normally appear in

1922
02:19:03,319 --> 02:19:07,040
the game is not randomized and is not a Diablo item the Diablo items are extra

1923
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:11,159
okay so remembrance would just be the default remembrance stuff which would

1924
02:19:11,159 --> 02:19:15,520
be really really stupid because why would we want a remembrance item yeah

1925
02:19:15,520 --> 02:19:19,520
okay then they're not ancestral weapons so like they're not the cool ones

1926
02:19:19,559 --> 02:19:25,569
okay now I don't want to ruin this character because I could oh I have a

1927
02:19:25,569 --> 02:19:30,649
faith of bow a frost build-up faith of bow rare if you're interested in that

1928
02:19:30,649 --> 02:19:36,420
should I what should I get strength index do if I'm gonna be almost if I'm

1929
02:19:36,420 --> 02:19:40,389
gonna be almost a pure caster do I need to even put any points into any of this

1930
02:19:40,389 --> 02:19:52,739
if my plane eventually I think that's it right yeah here check this item out

1931
02:19:52,739 --> 02:20:05,239
hold on hold on he's holding I'm holding holding holding item I am oh what the

1932
02:20:05,239 --> 02:20:09,229
heck all right it's time to look through all of our items I'll see you in

1933
02:20:09,229 --> 02:20:14,899
like 30 minutes I'm looking through we got a lot of little gunk I'm gonna keep

1934
02:20:14,899 --> 02:20:27,739
this on thorns mind bestial incantations it's got a lot of sickles this thing is

1935
02:20:27,739 --> 02:20:49,680
actually amazing I'm gonna use this for now free HP ooh mm-hmm I'll keep the

1936
02:20:49,680 --> 02:21:07,690
three HP on or FP that's pretty good this one's better ooh this one's good

1937
02:21:07,690 --> 02:21:19,030
too yeah it's one two vigor and two HP every three seconds mmm that sounds

1938
02:21:19,030 --> 02:21:28,979
delicious this is frenzy flame though all right don't let me forget I have

1939
02:21:28,979 --> 02:21:49,750
this because I want it eventually okay I think I'm all right for now actually

1940
02:21:49,750 --> 02:21:54,270
let me hold oh I'm gonna look up the Diablo loot mod and figure out what is

1941
02:21:54,270 --> 02:22:07,979
actually the higher tier it goes common uncommon rare treasured ancestral

1942
02:22:07,979 --> 02:22:19,360
legendary mythical god-slaying that's a lot of tears there's a lot of tears yeah

1943
02:22:19,360 --> 02:22:31,690
frost damage okay so the friend how much the frenzied flame seal is how much base

1944
02:22:31,690 --> 02:22:38,229
just for existing how much damage did anybody know because this is ten percent

1945
02:22:38,229 --> 02:22:49,260
frenzied flame but this doesn't matter seven that's 20% bro that's Giants flame

1946
02:22:49,260 --> 02:23:05,680
incantations is be faith scaling right now this is C but incantation scaling so

1947
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:29,879
this is 152 this one's like better for now I guess 20% normally all right what

1948
02:23:29,879 --> 02:23:44,409
about my weapons still better Lee mind I need some more strength to put this on

1949
02:23:44,450 --> 02:23:51,709
if I want to put on that lightning spear thing okay do you have any like plus

1950
02:23:51,709 --> 02:24:02,530
strength talismans I just got another slot I think I think so if faith one

1951
02:24:02,530 --> 02:24:08,950
there's a lot of numbers on the screen right now

1952
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:24,379
great he every 5.8 seconds this is better kind of I guess all right let's

1953
02:24:24,379 --> 02:24:41,540
just go I think I know what I'm doing did you go in here did you even sit on

1954
02:24:41,579 --> 02:24:49,139
throne I started running through you didn't even do the funny sit on the

1955
02:24:49,139 --> 02:24:54,389
throne thing with me in the room oh well you were like looking at your items

1956
02:24:54,389 --> 02:25:36,340
fuck dude okay I got on everything I think is worth having on oh so I do have

1957
02:25:36,340 --> 02:25:41,629
a big question though what is going on with the that was two mimic tears in a

1958
02:25:41,629 --> 02:25:51,969
row why did that happen I don't know I think because we loosened up the the

1959
02:25:51,969 --> 02:25:57,729
overall pool of potential things it can be drawing from because we would like

1960
02:25:57,729 --> 02:26:03,139
widen to the important areas thing you know I mean there are no oh there are

1961
02:26:03,139 --> 02:26:06,379
two in the base game okay are there actually because I was trying to think

1962
02:26:06,379 --> 02:26:17,930
like I don't there shouldn't be two mimic tears pops as the regular stuff I

1963
02:26:17,930 --> 02:26:24,459
don't need it I don't want it oh it's one in a dungeon and one of the little

1964
02:26:24,459 --> 02:26:43,290
mini-dungeons okay that makes sense sounds good to me hot throne items

1965
02:26:43,290 --> 02:26:55,709
damage increase I don't all right so and where to now that was cool when I just

1966
02:26:55,709 --> 02:27:02,719
go on the left and do the the jail you love evergales just a boss right there

1967
02:27:02,719 --> 02:27:09,180
okay all right I mean just boss it's just a boss like it's just the boss bro

1968
02:27:09,180 --> 02:27:18,530
let's just get some runes Academy scroll where did you go oh you went down I see

1969
02:27:18,690 --> 02:27:48,190
how did you you really went all over here or whatever here we go coming I was

1970
02:27:48,190 --> 02:28:06,969
looking at stuff should be a chest in here somewhere I thought there was a

1971
02:28:06,969 --> 02:28:13,290
chest in here that's not that's you okay what the hell I'm just I'm making it so

1974
02:28:25,780 --> 02:28:30,409
way around oh shit that's I think you're right but there should be it's not it's

1975
02:28:30,409 --> 02:28:33,209
not that you know what you're gonna give up when I say something's a little hard

rant about how I'm sick of eating and I wish I could have flavorless pebbles

2003
02:33:01,469 --> 02:33:07,030

2012
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:05,139
emails that are burgers but I've been typecast I ate a burger one time and the

2013
02:34:05,139 --> 02:34:08,770
Wall Street Journal will not leave me alone about it I think it's all that I

2014
02:34:08,770 --> 02:34:16,670
eat okay all right okay chili verde burritos are pretty good I had one

2015
02:34:16,670 --> 02:34:21,319
earlier all right thanks Josh so Josh I have a question for you if you opened up

2016
02:34:21,319 --> 02:34:26,360
the fridge and there was a chili verde burrito made by a professional chef and

2017
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:32,719
it's like it's arguably the best quality you've ever seen in your entire life but

2018
02:34:32,719 --> 02:34:39,819
it is surrounded on all sides by tuna fish sandwiches in the fridge will you

2019
02:34:39,819 --> 02:34:43,940
is it are you so rude is it so disgusting to you will you reach in and

2020
02:34:43,940 --> 02:34:50,139
will you grab that burrito mom my food touch the ketchup I don't like the ketchup

2021
02:34:50,139 --> 02:34:53,459
or my mashed potatoes touch my pee no no they're all the same plate and they're

2022
02:34:53,459 --> 02:35:02,409
all wrapped under the same saran wrap like they're on the same plate wrapped

2023
02:35:02,450 --> 02:35:10,790
under the same saran wrap gross throw it away they're up there all under this

2024
02:35:10,790 --> 02:35:15,030
yeah I throw it away that's disgusting what whatever is under the saran wrap

2025
02:35:15,030 --> 02:35:18,590
in like a plate of tuna and you have like a burger in the middle it's gonna

2026
02:35:18,590 --> 02:35:22,190
taste like tuna okay I just was I was curious if that was like if it being in

2027
02:35:22,190 --> 02:35:26,110
like the same place was disgusting to you well they're gonna taste the same

2028
02:35:26,110 --> 02:35:31,819
nothing not I mean you can like burgers and you can like tuna but would you

2029
02:35:31,819 --> 02:35:36,340
like a burger that had like the scent and fragrance of like it's been sitting

2030
02:35:36,379 --> 02:35:44,979
in a saran wrapped tuna thing I'm just trying to get you to say you would you

2031

2032
02:35:49,819 --> 02:35:58,670
talking to you but I just feel like I'm not saying what you want me to say it

2033
02:35:58,670 --> 02:36:04,379
means you didn't wrap it good enough I got some cool stuff and I want to look

war to figure out who your waifu is waifu war yeah it's it's one of those

2044
02:37:33,879 --> 02:37:37,059
things where you choose there it gives you two images and you got to pick one

2045
02:37:37,059 --> 02:37:41,120
and it goes all the way down to the end round of 256 to figure out who your

2046
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:50,739
waifu is I've just been 200 rounds on this yeah that's the only way to know

2047
02:37:50,739 --> 02:38:01,329
for sure oh what did you get I ended up having to pick the hell-taker main

2048
02:38:01,329 --> 02:38:07,299
character and Satan all right can I just say Ursula and we can move on Ursula

2049
02:38:07,299 --> 02:38:18,709
Ursula wasn't on my list it's a good pick I can't hit on Ursula unless she is

2050
02:38:18,709 --> 02:38:39,110
inside a Saran wrap of tuna big laugh by the way shut up wait has even faking

2052
02:38:49,040 --> 02:39:35,920
your seal fucking speechless why it's my favorite NPC in the game German if I

2053
02:39:35,959 --> 02:39:40,600
ever came to like does it to visit you yeah and you were that old the legs

2054
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:44,479
didn't work you're hiding in a bush pretending to be a pot I'd do the same

2055
02:39:44,479 --> 02:40:02,200
to you no no I fell I fake laughed again whatever I don't care coming wait am I

2056
02:40:02,200 --> 02:40:06,250
jumping off too I mean what else is up there besides I mean we could do the

2057
02:40:06,250 --> 02:40:11,750
little boss up there maybe I mean there is a little boss up there there is a

2058
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:14,590
little boss but I'd have to go all the way around wouldn't okay yeah no it's

2059
02:40:14,590 --> 02:40:22,840
too late now yeah yeah we got bigger fish to fry doing it is pretty good on

2060
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:30,100
the stove right watch out dragon I would say I pretty much recommend that there

2061
02:40:30,100 --> 02:40:43,719
goes talking about the food again you just killed that in one hit yeah all

2062
02:40:43,719 --> 02:40:52,600
right so where's our destination would you like anything in particular you

2063
02:40:52,600 --> 02:40:57,399
want to do I I'm feeling very strong I feel like we're following the same path

2064
02:40:57,399 --> 02:41:02,799
we did the first time though yeah like this would just take us back to the

2065
02:41:02,799 --> 02:41:07,399
glint stone Academy we do like like what's like a different way that we

2066
02:41:07,399 --> 02:41:12,079
didn't go last time we didn't really do anything underground last time really we

2067
02:41:12,079 --> 02:41:16,440
didn't do like knock wrong we didn't do the we did we also just kind of ran

2068
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:19,559
through Caelan I feel like we could handle Caelan we could probably handle

2069
02:41:19,559 --> 02:41:23,239
as early as things are I feel like you know what let's like go back get a

2070
02:41:23,239 --> 02:41:27,399
bonfire take the road up to Caelan there's a church along the way I think

2071
02:41:27,399 --> 02:41:33,399
there's a reforged boss in that church really like not usually there but it

2072
02:41:33,399 --> 02:42:00,959
might be randomized shit out of me okay I was expecting more goofy mods um I

2073
02:42:00,959 --> 02:42:05,680
don't think they really exist for Elden Ring there aren't a lot first of all

2074
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:10,840
there aren't a lot I was looking into some goofy mods and then um they're hard

2075
02:42:10,840 --> 02:42:16,979
to merge together yeah it's like the effort versus goofy reward and then it's

2076
02:42:16,979 --> 02:42:20,819
like one armor piece in the game is like that one's like Batman's armor then

2077
02:42:20,819 --> 02:42:24,659
we're randomized and we'll never find it and never even know it was there I mean

2078
02:42:24,659 --> 02:42:28,579
that would be kind of funny to be in like a Batman costume I thought it would

2079
02:42:28,579 --> 02:42:31,860
be funny you know you go to the roundtable hold and like the main guy

2080
02:42:31,860 --> 02:42:36,500
there is Batman like that'd be funny yeah but I already said Donald Duck that'd

2081
02:42:36,500 --> 02:42:54,270
be kind of funny um let's let's find closest bonfire oh that's actually

2082
02:42:54,510 --> 02:43:03,590
amazing that's one of the things that gets buffed if well we can't really do

2083
02:43:03,590 --> 02:43:08,190
it but I think that's one of the schools of magic that's buffed with warlock if

2084
02:43:08,190 --> 02:43:27,229
you play the actual reforged for real dragon at the dragon spot unless that's

2085
02:43:27,229 --> 02:43:35,000
a distant I remember it being fake is this one fake

2086
02:43:35,000 --> 02:44:02,739
seems wiki wheel well seems like it's going to die a lot of health I'm doing a

2195
03:08:44,389 --> 03:08:55,520
remember this one might have been one of the weird ones where there's like all

2196
03:08:55,520 --> 03:08:59,600
the way to go on like down like a weird hidden floor yeah is it that way is it

2197
03:08:59,600 --> 03:09:15,239
this one that's what I'm asking I don't know we need to find out stir you can

2198
03:09:15,239 --> 03:09:18,719
have fun with that dog you need help I think you know what I'm on it you know I

2200
03:09:27,940 --> 03:09:40,750
a way down um let's ago I think it's higher up on the hill hey dude have you

2201
03:09:40,750 --> 03:09:46,520
ever slipped a disc yes right here um there was a while where I thought that

2202
03:09:46,520 --> 03:09:50,920
the chest pain brought but I thought that was a disk problem but turns out it

2203
03:09:50,920 --> 03:09:58,870
probably isn't oh yeah there you go there you go never did but he thought he

2204
03:09:58,870 --> 03:10:14,780
did interesting room not this one not this one they had it coming

2205
03:10:14,780 --> 03:10:27,190
ooh that's kind of good turtle talisman I guess maybe not when it comes to the

2206
03:10:27,190 --> 03:10:32,340
random shit you can get in the Diablo 2 mod I'm sure that's something we have

2207
03:10:32,340 --> 03:10:45,780
on some way better potentially potentially all right we could go do the

2208
03:10:45,780 --> 03:10:51,440
bird tree the one that's in Caleb over here we should go to the church the

2209
03:10:51,440 --> 03:11:00,819
smoldering church go to the earth tree and then go to the Caleb ruins I think

2210
03:11:00,819 --> 03:11:10,059
that's the plan what do you think yeah no okay I'm with you you watch it mister

2211

03:11:20,559 --> 03:11:33,309
much longer buster then you understand Jack I'm not your buster pal it's gone

2213
03:11:33,350 --> 03:11:59,079

2219
03:12:44,940 --> 03:12:53,149

scaling with arcane I believe Diablo Mon does that oh I need 40 faith to use it

2262
03:22:03,540 --> 03:22:07,459
but it scales off of arcane it does not scale off of faith that kind of sucks oh

2300
03:29:39,659 --> 03:29:53,719
right uncommon sacred battle hammer of the glint blade I saw how I heard sacred

2301
03:29:54,770 --> 03:30:02,739
30 strength come on strengthens glint blade sorceries by fit what a wacky item

2302
03:30:02,739 --> 03:30:21,000
it's just like I don't even need to I just that's wacky so that's a faith

2303
03:30:21,000 --> 03:30:27,479
weapon that boosts sorceries and is a big heavy blunt weapon interesting common

2304
03:30:27,479 --> 03:30:41,299
sacred iron cleaver same deal this one though be scaling I think it's not super

2305
03:30:41,299 --> 03:30:45,809
worth looking at anything that is a common rarity really because I think

2306
03:30:45,809 --> 03:30:50,850
this is like better than what I have common rarity for a weapon does 0.9

2307
03:30:50,850 --> 03:30:57,729
percent damage a mythical weapon does 2.4 times damage so they just

2308
03:30:57,729 --> 03:31:06,610
exponentially scale I see unless the mods are on a common or like insane I

2309
03:31:06,610 --> 03:31:27,729
guess and care like you know we need that good loot for the guild god did you

2310
03:31:27,770 --> 03:31:51,690
give me rot Wow that's a lot good yeah this is all going in guild stash don't

2311
03:31:51,690 --> 03:31:57,120
be able to upgrade every single weapon to plus three or four at least was five

2312
03:31:57,120 --> 03:32:07,139
plus ten the drama yeah the Diablo weapons go to plus two all of them like

2313
03:32:07,139 --> 03:32:12,500
every song oh okay all of you have like a mythical weapon then it requires high

2314
03:32:12,500 --> 03:32:17,260
level smithing stones to get to upgrade it but they're all okay I thought it was

2315
03:32:17,860 --> 03:32:29,940
and that is a plus two that's why I'm saying it's a little bit of a waste to

2316
03:32:29,940 --> 03:32:33,180
be getting these smithing stones because you'd want to upgrade a mythic ideally

2317
03:32:33,180 --> 03:32:36,940
and then you aren't really ever gonna use these here let me get them let me get

2318
03:32:36,940 --> 03:32:47,299
them let me get this guy okay I heard him once I don't want you to get all the

2319
03:32:47,299 --> 03:32:52,260
credit I'm gonna die why did I let you do that why did I let you do that

2320
03:32:52,260 --> 03:33:00,299
because I don't have I don't have any healing I had to commit oh come on you

2321
03:33:00,299 --> 03:33:18,500
can beat him I still feel like the dodge is off I really do I promise you the

2322
03:33:18,500 --> 03:33:26,780
dodge is still wrong I know the dodges is actually slightly different I think

2323
03:33:26,780 --> 03:33:30,780
they removed there is a like input delay normally an Elden Ring that they

2324
03:33:30,780 --> 03:33:38,889
removed so as such your dodge timings may actually be a little off from

2325
03:33:39,770 --> 03:33:45,540
normal Elden Ring this a serious yeah I am I'm not I wouldn't joke with you man

2326
03:33:45,540 --> 03:34:06,899
what I joke about that yeah something does still feel strange when I hit the

2327
03:34:06,899 --> 03:34:11,899
dodge button now whether that's I'm getting hit in the middle of dodging or

2328
03:34:11,899 --> 03:34:15,659
is it happening earlier yeah my brain is having trouble with it

2329
03:34:15,739 --> 03:34:50,770
hi bear god dude I can't go I'm stuck all right I'm good okay we're good that

2330
03:34:50,770 --> 03:35:00,100
is terrifying me it is very scary oh I know where they other the other frenzy

2331
03:35:00,100 --> 03:35:06,299
flame thing is in that small village up in the on the top of that one hill where

2332
03:35:06,299 --> 03:35:15,120
all the like frenzied rats are yeah oh yeah is the whole village there's a

2333
03:35:15,120 --> 03:35:20,040
whole like frenzied village mm-hmm and they're all insane and their heretics

2334
03:35:20,040 --> 03:35:27,649
and we need to kill them all and then continue their traditions I think we're

2335
03:35:27,649 --> 03:35:47,379
being chased okay round two wild strikes I'm just gonna keep going what if it

2336
03:35:47,379 --> 03:35:51,979
kills you again though we need your expertise you better help because it's

2337
03:35:51,979 --> 03:36:36,459
wild strike time okay what the fuck I'm really good no I'm telling you I think

2338
03:36:36,459 --> 03:36:42,899
the dodge is fucked I'm telling you it's not I sure I'm sure I'm sure that I

2339
03:36:42,899 --> 03:36:49,420
watched that happen did it to myself nearly on purpose and I'm very sad that

2340
03:36:49,420 --> 03:36:57,260
I did because it really what I don't want to be dead well we got it I got all

2341
03:36:57,260 --> 03:37:13,600
the items anyway I got a legendary something they're getting new I need to

2342
03:37:13,600 --> 03:37:17,200
like sit down you know what we need to sell all this crap I'm gonna confuse

2343
03:37:17,200 --> 03:37:23,280
myself let's go back to brother kale because in my brain like literally every

2344
03:37:23,280 --> 03:37:26,959
single one of these is like the same because I have to hit X to look at what

2345
03:37:26,959 --> 03:37:30,840
it actually does yeah yeah but in my brain I'm dead right now I can't do

2346
03:37:30,840 --> 03:37:44,450
anything so let's go to kale okay I know it's the gloves but it's just like we're

2347
03:37:44,450 --> 03:37:48,530
picking up so many things that I've just random stats on them that everything's

2348
03:37:48,569 --> 03:37:59,059
kind of gets lost okay um zero bonfire here somewhere isn't one right there's

2349
03:37:59,059 --> 03:38:02,860
one down the elevator and you should be you should be able to teleport without

2350
03:38:02,860 --> 03:38:13,079
going down there don't you have to vote for it yeah you're right he's right

2351
03:38:13,079 --> 03:38:26,250
again I mean when you have like 30 of these in your inventory it gets kind of

2352
03:38:26,250 --> 03:38:30,840
hard to differentiate between which one is what we definitely have to go sell

2353
03:38:30,840 --> 03:39:00,120
all these or most of them coming back mmm maybe some no I'll get endurance

2354
03:39:00,280 --> 03:39:33,500
sort by time picked up item type order of acquisition god okay we we fail in a

2355
03:39:33,500 --> 03:39:38,879
vote I'm just I'm just testing that out to see what it looks like we we failing

2356
03:39:38,879 --> 03:39:58,559
okay so who would you say is winning right now neither one of us I think

2357
03:39:58,559 --> 03:40:11,159
you're winning you know he's truly winning God and his servants what are

2358
03:40:11,159 --> 03:40:18,600
you buying here I'm selling that's what you wanted to sell things what do you

2359
03:40:18,760 --> 03:40:26,030
I've heard my weapons that I'm not gonna be using all right I'm gonna dump all

2360
03:40:26,030 --> 03:40:33,920
these talismans all right let's 2fp every I mean I don't I don't know if it's

2361
03:40:33,920 --> 03:40:51,670
worth holding on to some of these but whatever that's 1.7 fire damage dealt I'm

2362
03:40:51,670 --> 03:40:54,989
gonna just get rid of the ones that don't have three things on them right

2363
03:40:54,989 --> 03:41:04,510
let's holy damage or 3hp to one lightning damage one 3fp for three years

2364
03:41:04,510 --> 03:41:24,239
six is eight if forced it huh or seven's kind of good extra lightning

2365
03:41:24,239 --> 03:41:29,959
damage taken I think I'm just gonna get rid of anything that doesn't not

2366
03:41:29,959 --> 03:41:34,200
whatever I'm just gonna go for it I'll keep that just selling any basically

2367
03:41:34,200 --> 03:41:39,680
anything that's not equipped and I don't want to equip is gone unless it seems

2368
03:41:39,680 --> 03:41:50,040
really interesting we're a specific ask but these are only worth a hundred they

2369
03:41:50,079 --> 03:42:14,600
are but they're kind of just clogging up the inventory yeah keep that on 1.3.2

2370
03:42:14,600 --> 03:42:34,020
I'm not gonna put this on probably this one's kind of good I think all right

2371
03:42:34,020 --> 03:43:11,520
oh my god that's a lot of money I don't have enough god damn it it was 86 all

2372
03:43:11,520 --> 03:43:25,659
right 15 endurance is fine I'll keep that for now oh hey well then I came

2373
03:43:25,659 --> 03:43:32,879
plus to 3hp oh my god those are good holy shit 5fp every three and a half

2374
03:43:32,879 --> 03:43:43,450
seconds 3.2 seconds yeah we never even went south and crossed that bridge do

2375
03:43:43,450 --> 03:43:48,950
you still want to go back into a lid we should go south to the ailing village to

2376
03:43:48,950 --> 03:43:55,270
get you your frenzy fire yeah we kind of we kind of went that way and then we

2377
03:43:55,270 --> 03:43:59,709
decided to do something else and now we're I guess we're mm-hmm is that what

2378
03:43:59,709 --> 03:44:02,709
we're doing is that the plan yeah so let's go to gate front we got a long

2379
03:44:02,709 --> 03:44:07,690
yeah so I'm gonna need you to bring up a very engaging topic for the for the

2380
03:44:07,690 --> 03:44:17,389
journey okay dig down into your bag of tricks I am pressing it but it will not

2381
03:44:17,389 --> 03:44:37,229
go aw shucks aw shucks I don't think we can go we can cut across here I think

2382
03:44:37,229 --> 03:44:48,200
actually I think we can let's just go from here okay yeah you can I just

2383
03:44:48,200 --> 03:44:52,840
assume everywhere in Elden Ring is like a gigantic cave that will prevent you

2384
03:44:52,840 --> 03:45:00,239
from going anywhere or not cave cliff cliff a big valley yes it does end up

2385
03:45:00,239 --> 03:45:18,500
that way a lot of the places though oh I got a rare power bottoms Greaves ooh

2386

04:06:49,959 --> 04:06:58,709
invisible necromancer and then something just as bad and also it's very very dark

2476

2499
04:11:24,700 --> 04:11:30,090
wouldn't be able to know where how much I'm healing you doesn't seem like a lot

2500
04:11:30,090 --> 04:11:34,250
either way it's not a whole lot but hey it's still something then yeah I'm just

2501
04:11:34,250 --> 04:11:48,280
gonna go back to where my power bottoms all right that was an eventful cave

2502
04:11:48,280 --> 04:12:03,479
actually pretty it was and then I believe like straight this way is the

2503
04:12:03,479 --> 04:12:12,799
the demigod boss who is not a real boss but actually a loser would you say they

2504
04:12:13,319 --> 04:12:27,190
were on the scale of cool to dork where would they be demi boss they would not

2505
04:12:27,190 --> 04:12:35,420
be at my lunch table if you know what I'm saying unless they want it to I

2506
04:12:35,420 --> 04:12:40,700

2507
04:12:40,700 --> 04:12:48,389
conversation you know what I'm saying spring and you know the jumpy here I

2508

2552
04:20:08,219 --> 04:20:14,790
where we gone back to the where we were trying to go before frenzy I'm trying

2553
04:20:14,790 --> 04:20:22,659
tower to remember frenzied flame village up here I don't know if you see my

2554

markers I know where it is yeah it's like part of this whole tower and and we

2555
04:20:30,719 --> 04:20:34,159
have the crystal tunnel there but I think we have to go all the way from

2556
04:20:34,159 --> 04:20:39,479
back here you can go up the middle of like from the lake but we haven't got

2557
04:20:39,479 --> 04:20:45,159
any good waypoints from we were trying to cross the whole lake earlier here

2558
04:20:45,159 --> 04:20:49,280
here here here here we here I know I know we're going it's just a long trek

2559
04:20:49,280 --> 04:21:19,850
all right remember my game takes slightly longer than newest to load yeah

2560
04:21:19,850 --> 04:21:26,520
I know I wait for you every single time with my overflowing vessel of great

2561
04:21:26,760 --> 04:21:32,479
patience of the fourth born can you say that five times fast I don't even

2562
04:21:32,479 --> 04:21:39,700
remember what I just said I really am just saying words they all they're right

2563
04:21:39,700 --> 04:21:48,280
about me and I'm also gonna stop saying hey there's a thing we can go in right

2564
04:21:48,280 --> 04:21:55,620
here I'm just we're just gonna go you know um we can't get to it from this way

2565
04:21:55,620 --> 04:21:59,540
we got to go into the lake again trust yeah you have to go through the middle

2566
04:21:59,540 --> 04:22:04,399
right yeah cuz then there's one of those uh there's one of those cliffs that you

2567
04:22:04,399 --> 04:22:19,159
know just just the world hey you got to go from the middle don't you think the

2568
04:22:19,159 --> 04:22:25,239
earth would be better off if it was perfectly flat oh and I'm not saying

2569
04:22:25,239 --> 04:22:28,799
like flatter a theory I'm saying like it's a round planet still but it is it

2570
04:22:28,799 --> 04:22:35,520
is perfectly flat no mountains no hills no rivers well gravity exists so it

2571
04:22:35,520 --> 04:22:43,229
doesn't really matter so I mean like you know wait you mean like every dome you

2572
04:22:43,270 --> 04:22:49,079
mean literal flat like the whole thing is flat everything yeah yeah so you just

2573
04:22:49,079 --> 04:22:56,430
want like the Great Plains across the entire world yes yes um so you're

2574
04:22:56,430 --> 04:23:01,590
talking about you want the roller coaster tycoon default grass yes all

2575
04:23:01,590 --> 04:23:08,760
right um I want I want default grass map from the tutorial level of like that

2576
04:23:09,319 --> 04:23:17,340
game just no just everything is exactly just green I I feel like this probably

2577
04:23:17,340 --> 04:23:24,139
reasons why it would be bad but but here's the trade-off it's like a dwarven

2578
04:23:24,139 --> 04:23:28,340
ecosystem underground where these massive caverns and these oars we've

2579
04:23:28,340 --> 04:23:31,620
never heard of that can let the elves live forever but we won't let them have

2580
04:23:31,620 --> 04:23:47,530
them but they get them the world above is flat but because that's all flat we

2581
04:23:47,530 --> 04:23:51,170
can't have rivers so obviously we wouldn't have water to like anything I

2582
04:23:51,170 --> 04:23:55,579
feel like I just skipped ten minutes forward in a YouTube video like you're

2583
04:23:55,579 --> 04:24:09,520
just something else completely going on all right uh let's do it what was he

2584
04:24:09,520 --> 04:24:14,040
cooking the great question

2585
04:24:14,520 --> 04:24:23,430
could have just said no the end like a valid answer was just no I don't think

2586
04:24:23,430 --> 04:24:31,290
that would be better but no one wants to like speak up conflict-averse how windy

2587
04:24:31,290 --> 04:24:39,049
would it get I feel like if it was all just roller coaster tycoon grass wouldn't

2588
04:24:39,049 --> 04:24:43,930
it be I don't know question would it we would change the dynamic of all of our

2589
04:24:43,930 --> 04:24:53,829
meteor a lot of wind come from like the the melting of the ocean I feel like

2590
04:24:53,829 --> 04:24:57,790
you know ocean melts into the clouds and if there was no water on the surface

2591
04:24:57,790 --> 04:25:17,340
because it's all flat then the ocean wouldn't be melting so true yeah I've

2592
04:25:17,340 --> 04:25:21,700
been a lot of question marks okay so if ice melts into water and then water can

2593
04:25:21,700 --> 04:25:27,750
change into gas behind you call that melting why can't water melt into gas

2594
04:25:28,190 --> 04:25:35,559
um water blame the flame cleans me in there if you care you probably don't

2595
04:25:35,559 --> 04:26:00,100
care oh that hurt well I thought that was you hitting me from behind me all

2596
04:26:00,100 --> 04:26:04,780
right stop please I get this guy has been in the same animation the whole time

2597
04:26:04,780 --> 04:26:10,389
and he's just wild striking I don't know he's just doing wild strike whatever he

2598
04:26:10,389 --> 04:26:20,360
was doing this thing's one hit can you just like fucking go crazy oh thank God

2599
04:26:21,239 --> 04:26:28,790
it evaporates like vapor doesn't freeze into water it condenses there you go

2600
04:26:28,790 --> 04:26:34,879
there's your answer it condenses and that guy's not like you're not no one's

2601
04:26:34,879 --> 04:26:42,149
doing question marks to that guy well that's baked with real science not

2602
04:26:42,149 --> 04:26:48,430
nutrient pellet science that you're using when's the last time you open like

2603
04:26:48,430 --> 04:26:54,700
a science book don't you think just like feeling from your gut like how the heart

2604
04:26:54,700 --> 04:27:01,069
feels is enough do you really even need to know like oh I need to like read a

2605
04:27:01,110 --> 04:27:04,750
biology book to understand how my body were you just kind of like you sit on

2606
04:27:04,750 --> 04:27:09,069
the toilet shit happens you don't need to know the mechanics of the world to

2607
04:27:09,069 --> 04:27:20,360
understand that water can melt well okay water can evaporate okay and then why

2608
04:27:20,360 --> 04:27:26,860
why does the word melt it turns into here because melting implies melting

2609
04:27:26,860 --> 04:27:30,299
implies okay correct me if I'm wrong melting implies a heat source does it

2610
04:27:30,299 --> 04:27:39,229
not well if it gets hot enough out the water melts like melting doesn't that

2611
04:27:39,229 --> 04:27:48,840
mean like it needs to melt there is heat involved early melting is from solid to

2612
04:27:48,840 --> 04:28:03,200
liquid melting implies liquidification does it imply that or are you like

2613
04:28:03,200 --> 04:28:09,120
expecting that it can only mean that I think you're fighting semantics right

2614
04:28:09,120 --> 04:28:23,780
now in education guys don't blame any I'm a dropout I dropped out of high

2615
04:28:23,780 --> 04:28:38,579
school this is not an ace ball do my brain is melting listening to you oh but

2616
04:28:38,579 --> 04:28:45,659
he can say that and I can't say water melts just hurt the turtle I jumped on

2617
04:28:45,659 --> 04:28:50,379
him and it turns the turn on him I just tried to stand on him I stir if there's

2618
04:28:50,379 --> 04:28:53,620
one person I have ever heard of that would ever hit the turtle it's you I

2619
04:28:53,620 --> 04:28:59,360
didn't hit him I tried to be on his back yep like imagine you're a small child

2620
04:28:59,399 --> 04:29:13,739
didn't you ever want to like ride a big dog I'm busy yeah stir the type of guy

2621
04:29:13,739 --> 04:29:21,100
to r1 r1 r1 the turtle and then be like actually wild strike is just hold l2 for

2622
04:29:21,100 --> 04:29:28,149
me it's a lot simpler than r1 r1 r1 I can't handle that many button presses

2623
04:29:28,149 --> 04:29:38,100
stir the type of guy to hold l2 on the turtle okay you didn't even talk to the

2624
04:29:38,100 --> 04:29:46,219
turtles I I don't need sorceries alright let's go fight something let's

2625
04:29:46,260 --> 04:29:50,260
go fight let's go fight like regular karya or you know what we're doing right

2626
04:29:50,260 --> 04:29:53,940
now and why we're doing it yes I but I know we're doing the frenzied flame

2627
04:29:53,940 --> 04:29:58,059
village do you know how close we are and how far we traveled to get here for you

2628
04:29:58,059 --> 04:30:02,079

2629
04:30:02,079 --> 04:30:14,959
whole time you've been saucing I just need to look at the map and you're

2630
04:30:14,959 --> 04:30:41,379
fighting all these guys there's the item here got violet okay any any any map

2631

2632
04:30:53,100 --> 04:30:59,379
tower there's a village we got to go down this hill I don't know who came up

2633
04:30:59,379 --> 04:31:10,399
this hill the melting conversation you had is why America isn't top 10 in stem

2634
04:31:10,399 --> 04:31:28,510
I haven't been in a classroom in like 15 years wait top 10 in stem there's like

2635
04:31:28,549 --> 04:31:38,459
not even there's barely more than 10 countries guys when you get to be over

2636
04:31:38,459 --> 04:31:43,020
30 you stop giving a shit about what melting versus condensation you give a

2637
04:31:43,020 --> 04:31:50,350
shit about fucking taxes all right got a fucking lawn to take care of shit I

2638
04:31:50,350 --> 04:31:57,819
think my game crashed oh true no way dude every time you turn on the news

2639
04:31:57,819 --> 04:32:01,940
it's all China this Russia that trying to this Russia that USA you there's like

2640
04:32:01,940 --> 04:32:20,850
three countries something something in the fucking water today something in the

2641

I you want you want more should I go shake it gone unless you want to play

2645
04:32:57,049 --> 04:33:12,860
GeoGuessr again Ecuador my world is open to wanderers Egypt what ranking is

2646
04:33:12,860 --> 04:33:42,500
Egypt in stem no they were talking about stem cells right where I can like

2647
04:33:42,500 --> 04:33:52,279
like how many years before I can have gills sir I gotta tell you I know this

2648
04:33:52,279 --> 04:33:55,240
has been like a jokey conversation we were just like pretending that we don't

2649
04:33:55,240 --> 04:33:58,159
actually know this stuff but you have to understand that there are chatters that

2650
04:33:58,159 --> 04:34:01,400
are going to hear you say that and they're gonna they're gonna think even

2651
04:34:01,400 --> 04:34:09,790
less of us oh I'm well aware I am totally and completely aware and I you

2652
04:34:09,790 --> 04:34:17,299
know I had an awakening I shouldn't even say more you know what I shouldn't

2653
04:34:17,299 --> 04:34:31,860
say more I don't know if I want to hear about the awakening I'm not sure about

2654
04:34:31,860 --> 04:34:45,029
that I don't know if I want to hear about the awakening tell us all I'll

2655
04:34:45,029 --> 04:34:49,150
say about the awakening is and that some people are the I don't hear about the

2656
04:34:49,150 --> 04:34:53,349
awakening I don't want to hear about the awakening I think it's too much eyes

2657
04:34:53,349 --> 04:35:00,590
too much I feel like this is the kind of shit you're gonna start talking about

2658
04:35:00,590 --> 04:35:04,470
fucking like crystals and gems and you're gonna start talking about like

2659
04:35:04,470 --> 04:35:08,970
fucking earth being flat your alarms are going off because you're like

2660
04:35:08,970 --> 04:35:14,750
something this motherfucker won't even say I don't want to hear about the

2661
04:35:14,750 --> 04:35:27,759
awakening all right fair enough all right how about this you DM me what like

2662
04:35:27,759 --> 04:35:32,400
one sentence of what the awakening is it's not that bad if I like leave out

2663
04:35:32,400 --> 04:35:41,380
the important parts all right tell me like we could have we can talk about it

2664
04:35:41,380 --> 04:35:51,009
later but like to it wouldn't make sense the full context is required of which

2665
04:35:51,009 --> 04:35:59,290
you would not have there is awakening I went like down I was concerned about

2666
04:35:59,290 --> 04:36:02,970
your awakening so I went down here it's I don't know why we called it an

2667
04:36:02,970 --> 04:36:08,630
awakening it's not an awakening I forgot it's hard to even relate to what the

2668
04:36:08,630 --> 04:36:13,139
original conversation was because I can't remember what we were talking about

2669
04:36:13,139 --> 04:36:19,020
talking about how many countries you can name no like after that um about all

2670
04:36:19,020 --> 04:36:22,740
people thinking that we're thinking we're done right like oh they're dumb

2671
04:36:22,900 --> 04:36:26,580
they don't know anything about condensation yeah that that was where we

2672
04:36:26,580 --> 04:36:29,540
left that and then you said I had an awakening and I don't know if I can

2673
04:36:29,540 --> 04:36:35,319
even say it on stream the short version is which is fine is that when I stream

2674
04:36:35,319 --> 04:36:41,360
with you huh I never get Twitter DMs but when I stream with you afterwards

2675
04:36:41,360 --> 04:36:49,430
sometimes I get a few that are like can you not talk about that ever again wait

2676
04:36:49,430 --> 04:36:53,630
for like from people you know or from like no no no no like random people

2677
04:36:53,630 --> 04:36:59,680
that I like long messages about like why what I said was actually like there

2678
04:36:59,680 --> 04:37:03,240
did you know like I could imagine getting one like it was kind of really

2679
04:37:03,240 --> 04:37:07,119
saddening to hear you say there was only ten countries because actually I'm from

2680
04:37:07,119 --> 04:37:11,799
one that isn't one of those ten and I really felt like I was personally so so

2681
04:37:11,799 --> 04:37:17,400
you're so your concern is you're here on like on like a comedy stream and you're

2682
04:37:17,400 --> 04:37:20,720
afraid that you're gonna get DMs where people think that you're actually mean

2683
04:37:20,720 --> 04:37:23,680
the thing you say on the comedy stream well it's kind of what you were saying

2684
04:37:23,680 --> 04:37:30,970
is that people will think we're that dumb and I don't know why also I don't

2685
04:37:30,970 --> 04:37:35,889
know why I called that an awakening yeah that to me you were talking okay you

2686
04:37:35,889 --> 04:37:41,490
let's let's go over some very factual information we you first of all you were

2687
04:37:41,490 --> 04:37:45,049
like I don't even know if I want to talk about this on stream and that was like

2688
04:37:45,049 --> 04:37:51,849
transitioning out of like like yeah wouldn't be better if the earth was flat

2689
04:37:51,849 --> 04:37:56,529
you know like you don't have any turbo and I'm just like yeah what do you mean

2690
04:37:56,529 --> 04:37:59,610
but and then you know what I had an awakening recently let me tell you all

2691
04:37:59,610 --> 04:38:11,049
about it what was it there's a longer there's a longer awakening I just you

2692
04:38:11,049 --> 04:38:20,889
know that's but too long didn't read that's all you need to know okay and

2693
04:38:20,889 --> 04:38:29,189
first of all I what is why do you have Twitter DMS open open what why don't you

2694
04:38:29,189 --> 04:38:35,029
why would you have Twitter DMS open for any Twitter user to just DM your ass

2695
04:38:35,029 --> 04:38:42,459
why not stir I I'm telling you right now you just told like tens of thousands of

2696
04:38:42,459 --> 04:38:46,220
people that you have open DMS on Twitter like what like what is the worst thing

2697
04:38:46,860 --> 04:38:55,830
please do not I fucking go oh my god man like do you just not interact with your

2698
04:38:55,830 --> 04:39:10,950
fans no okay I thought there would be more new watch out for the big hand big

2699
04:39:10,950 --> 04:39:15,270
hand it's up on that hill up here but I don't think you can actually get up on

2700
04:39:15,270 --> 04:39:19,360
that hill unless you come from the other direction because this is where it's

2701
04:39:19,360 --> 04:39:24,299
hill hill cliff hell when you look at the map so yeah where were you want to

2702
04:39:24,299 --> 04:39:40,740
go to Caleb yes now I don't really use Twitter don't use discord because here's

2703
04:39:40,740 --> 04:39:44,340
the thing let's do you want to let's just be real you want to be real for a

2704
04:39:44,340 --> 04:39:49,580
second if you have if I have Twitter DMS open and somebody DMS me and I just don't

2705
04:39:49,580 --> 04:39:53,419
if I just ignore it because I mean like look let's be realistic it's possible

2706
04:39:53,419 --> 04:39:57,819
that and that I was thinking the stand angle thousands of them could come in in

2707
04:39:57,860 --> 04:40:01,299
a week or a month period I'm telling you right now I'm not gonna read them I'm

2708
04:40:01,299 --> 04:40:04,459
not gonna read them all I'm just not going to and if somebody sends like a

2709
04:40:04,459 --> 04:40:08,459
bunch of text to something right you let's say you brought like two or three

2710
04:40:08,459 --> 04:40:11,740
paragraphs like a Twitter DM and I just don't even open it because it's just

2711
04:40:11,740 --> 04:40:15,979
overwhelming this too much then you spent the time to write to me and I just

2712
04:40:15,979 --> 04:40:23,189
didn't even respond there you go okay I don't want to I don't want to interact I

2713
04:40:23,189 --> 04:40:27,630
mean how many people just wrote to you in your chat that you didn't respond to

2714
04:40:27,669 --> 04:40:31,509
just now while you were saying that that's difference there's a character

2715
04:40:31,509 --> 04:40:39,220
limit is there you can write some pretty long I guess remove I guess remove my

2716
04:40:39,220 --> 04:40:52,060
nightbot TLDR it can be pretty overwhelming and I I prefer to not do it

2717
04:40:52,060 --> 04:41:01,720
TLDR mm-hmm why did you open this I don't know we were just up here and we

2718
04:41:01,720 --> 04:41:07,500
can't really get to where we were trying to go to so I think we probably do need

2719
04:41:07,500 --> 04:41:17,139
to like leave unless we you are you are with time you are just going on my

2720
04:41:17,139 --> 04:41:22,819
screen I oh I'm sitting in place that happens a lot around these altars

2721
04:41:22,819 --> 04:41:28,590
actually is where we've had a lot of the desync it does seem to happen here okay

2722
04:41:28,590 --> 04:41:36,099
do you want to just pick a place to reset us um yep we are going into the

2723
04:41:36,099 --> 04:41:44,900
moldering church do not touch this bonfire let's do you get random DMS

2724
04:41:44,900 --> 04:41:49,430
from random strangers I don't to me that's just like oh hey let me open up

2725
04:41:49,430 --> 04:41:54,029
my Twitter DMS oh that's a picture of somebody giving a double my finger and

2726
04:41:54,029 --> 04:41:58,750
their asshole okay that's cool I don't think people consciously thinking of

2727
04:41:58,750 --> 04:42:03,110
stir and being like you know what I'm gonna interact with stir that has never

2728
04:42:03,110 --> 04:42:07,959
been a problem and I don't think like maybe they're like oh because I said

2729
04:42:07,959 --> 04:42:11,080
like oh I saw them stream like for one day it'll be a problem then it will go

2730
04:42:11,080 --> 04:42:15,319
back to like you know I'm just like alone in my basement lights off

2731
04:42:15,319 --> 04:42:29,860
boundaries Bob yeah you got I accept them before with you guys come on don't

2732
04:42:29,860 --> 04:42:44,619
act like we haven't whoo it's putrid theodoric's not keep going through cave

2733
04:42:44,619 --> 04:42:55,500
yeah keep going cuz that didn't even hurt I mean my weapon is still I didn't

2734
04:42:55,500 --> 04:43:00,860
never gave it plus levels I think like we starting we were starting to hit

2735
04:43:00,860 --> 04:43:06,779
some things that oh my god scale on us yeah we probably should upgrade after

2736
04:43:06,779 --> 04:43:14,040
this you don't want to interact with random people no I really don't that

2737
04:43:14,040 --> 04:43:24,709
make me a bad person no it makes me somebody that is set hold on counter to

2738
04:43:24,709 --> 04:43:30,700
that mm-hmm you used to do like like packs East meetup I can't I can't do a

2739
04:43:30,700 --> 04:43:37,619
meetup that's different though or the very opposite ends of the spectrum

2740
04:43:37,619 --> 04:43:42,139
there I think that's different though I mean we're all there for that purpose of

2741
04:43:42,139 --> 04:43:45,580
like kind of being in the same place bunch of gamers bunch of streamers are

2742
04:43:45,580 --> 04:43:49,650
there a bunch of youtubers bunch of people that to me that's different like

2743
04:43:49,650 --> 04:43:54,450
I'm going to like a twitchcon or a packs East to go that I can all hang out and

2744
04:43:54,450 --> 04:44:00,459
talk to everybody that's like the point you know let these let these flames fly

2745
04:44:00,459 --> 04:44:16,250
frenzy these fucks pretty good I'll cover you it's just running by me that's

2746
04:44:16,290 --> 04:44:27,220
oh my god this whole hallways full why is there a wild time were you just

2747
04:44:27,220 --> 04:44:31,180
surprised at what type of enemy was in this total randomizer where every enemy

2748
04:44:31,180 --> 04:44:34,860
is random you said is that a bear like you were shocked I feel like we've seen

2749
04:44:34,860 --> 04:44:48,380
a lot of bears we have seen we've seen a few bears is that dead is brought yeah

2750
04:44:48,380 --> 04:45:03,080
this is building oh cuz I've rolled I'm an idiot I keep forgetting that do I

2751
04:45:03,080 --> 04:45:09,419
even have any of those things no why would we have one of those okay where we

2752
04:45:09,459 --> 04:45:19,689
go from here we've can I touch the thing I have rock yeah yeah I don't know where

2753
04:45:19,689 --> 04:45:24,680
you go from there they're like one of these walls must be was different

2754
04:45:24,680 --> 04:45:27,759
you want well asking what's the difference between randomizers this

2755
04:45:27,759 --> 04:45:32,439
randomizer is like kind of doubly weirdly randomized because we have

2756
04:45:32,439 --> 04:45:38,200
Diablo 2 loot and it's a lot of it and then we have this is all it's all

2757
04:45:38,240 --> 04:45:43,169
different we're more likely to get weirder bosses and in boss rooms and

2758
04:45:43,169 --> 04:45:51,490
the items have a lot of bonus extra weird stats coming back I am for you I

2759
04:45:51,490 --> 04:45:57,790
touched the thing because I was brought in but I like here oh well you go

2760
04:45:57,790 --> 04:46:04,279
underneath this someone shoot me you let this go up come off you go under so it's

2761
04:46:04,279 --> 04:46:07,599
not different at all I just we have Diablo 2 random loot what do you mean

2762
04:46:07,599 --> 04:46:14,880
like look at all this shit this is all like random shit and we have Elden Ring

2763
04:46:14,880 --> 04:46:24,659
reforged but we can't do this the actual classes so that's unfortunate I brought

2764
04:46:24,659 --> 04:46:43,470
us here to the scarlet rock cave all good hold on this at this Caleb trip has

2765
04:46:43,470 --> 04:46:51,139
been really I fucking did the dodge again we did like six circles to get to

2766
04:46:51,139 --> 04:46:57,279
Caleb by now we're in Caleb I'm not the place that I want to be in Caleb now we

2767
04:46:57,400 --> 04:47:01,799
got this the lever where do you want to be in Caleb I want to be in the place

2768
04:47:01,799 --> 04:47:16,099
where we can get some cool items whereas this one I have no idea uh can you just

2769
04:47:16,099 --> 04:47:27,150
go find it okay can you start a conversation sure so what was last time

2770
04:47:27,150 --> 04:47:39,759
you had it hmm does your jaw does your jaw click when you open it yes it does

2771
04:47:39,759 --> 04:47:47,419
how how far open does your mouth have to be before it clicks like mine's about

2772
04:47:47,459 --> 04:47:56,200
30 40 percent pretty much um I don't know I'm doing it now I don't know

2773
04:47:56,200 --> 04:48:00,220
happens it like weird spots sometimes it feels like it does it more than others I

2774
04:48:00,220 --> 04:48:04,290
remember I had like a long conversation with someone about this at one point

2775
04:48:04,290 --> 04:48:09,360
because Ashley sister is a dental surgeon and then I don't know I can't

2776
04:48:09,360 --> 04:48:18,380
remember what I learned that conversation started and stopped

2777
04:48:18,380 --> 04:48:23,259
instantly you know I know somebody that's a dental surgeon and I don't

2778
04:48:23,259 --> 04:48:26,099
remember anything I'm sorry I don't remember the whole thing like I feel

2779
04:48:26,099 --> 04:48:29,259
like I should be able to have more input on this conversation but honestly I

2780
04:48:29,259 --> 04:48:34,900
don't that just well you know what respect to you for acknowledging that

2781
04:48:34,900 --> 04:48:39,380
you don't know and not just kind of making up something you might half know

2782
04:48:39,380 --> 04:48:59,520
right I don't do that I could just talk just out here playing the game looking

2783
04:48:59,520 --> 04:49:03,240
for the lever for my I said I want to get the rod I had it I was already

2784
04:49:03,240 --> 04:49:12,099
built up he went on my website and bought a carry I'm looking like yeah

2785
04:49:12,099 --> 04:49:15,939
fine I'll do another carry for you on your Elden ring streams I'm looking I

2786
04:49:15,939 --> 04:49:28,619
found it I found it you didn't even find it I found it did you maybe oh and that

2787
04:49:28,619 --> 04:50:23,380
giant pile of enemies I ignored them oh god cool you found it cool um you find

2788
04:50:23,380 --> 04:50:32,950
it I was just giving you shit but then yeah I came up here and I didn't see it

2789
04:50:32,950 --> 04:50:40,330
up here and then that drops back down to where we were and it's like man what was

2790
04:50:40,330 --> 04:50:47,189
the point isn't something like in a weird spot I think so I think maybe you

2791
04:50:47,189 --> 04:50:51,270
can also go up on that I don't dude I don't know I remember hating this cave

2792
04:50:51,270 --> 04:50:54,349
because scarlet rot and they just need to make you hate yourself when you come

2793
04:50:54,349 --> 04:51:09,819
in here I thought you were ending your stream I thought you said I I thought

2794
04:51:09,819 --> 04:51:20,500
you said I gotta sleep I gotta sleep it's like oh my god I'm gonna be up at

2795
04:51:20,500 --> 04:51:26,630
4 a.m. tomorrow off something incredibly important I gotta sleep oh shit all

2796
04:51:26,630 --> 04:51:33,180
right then God you yeah take care he's gone he didn't say goodbye he just left

2797
04:51:33,180 --> 04:51:36,900
like if you miss this appointment tomorrow at 4 in the morning with three

2798
04:51:37,099 --> 04:51:46,689
gotta be up 4 a.m. yeah the doctors off it at 4 a.m. we're we're all booked up

2799
04:51:46,689 --> 04:51:54,779
but if you can come in at 4 a.m. still waiting for this door to open dude I

2800
04:51:54,779 --> 04:52:09,650
have no idea wait wait wait wait wait wait wait I'm remembering I thought you

2801
04:52:09,650 --> 04:52:19,040
played this game haven't you beaten this game before why don't you know this

2802
04:52:19,040 --> 04:52:24,840
doesn't come back down so we do we do have to do a loop oh oh oh oh I'm gonna

2803
04:52:24,840 --> 04:52:35,099
get scarlet rot you can just go wait at that door I'm just already following you

2804
04:52:35,099 --> 04:52:48,099
we got some marinara sauce on our boots some pesh penny pesto I don't know um I

2805
04:52:48,099 --> 04:52:57,819
think this is a like the Satanists at from software made this one and I think

2806
04:52:57,819 --> 04:53:09,590
there's an like an invisible wall right at the beginning the Satanists yeah like

2807
04:53:09,590 --> 04:53:14,029
every single time like a gamer gets aggravated and you like fuck millennia

2808
04:53:14,029 --> 04:53:18,549
fucking fucking a millennia like that energy exits your soul goes through the

2809
04:53:18,549 --> 04:53:22,709
game through the cords of the internet goes into Miyazaki they're all plugged

2810
04:53:22,709 --> 04:53:29,560
into him and he's like in his chamber oh yes oh yeah but it is like they breathe

2811
04:53:29,599 --> 04:53:44,299
it out of like a cone or something yeah like it's like that drop under the

2812
04:53:44,299 --> 04:53:48,220
elevator people are saying I think that's correct we did that we did do

2813
04:53:48,220 --> 04:53:54,860
that oh hey I found it you didn't see this it's right here there's no enemies

2816
04:54:02,959 --> 04:54:12,979
how you didn't see them Satanists well that's how they get you oh you Satan was

2817
04:54:13,020 --> 04:54:20,849
an angel himself and then you're in and they got you then we have to drop down

2818
04:54:20,849 --> 04:54:45,299
to get back to the door yeah did you drop yeah making sure all right you

2819
04:54:45,299 --> 04:54:48,500
ready to kill this boss in ten seconds ready I'm ready to kill this boss with

2820
04:54:48,500 --> 04:55:15,680
wild strike while you go should be fun how is this already dead I don't like

2821
04:55:15,680 --> 04:55:40,959
that tone that you had nice okay that is a lot legendary graven witches

2822
04:55:40,959 --> 04:55:45,520
clean-rod helm of what well I got the same one as you like exactly

2823
04:55:45,520 --> 04:55:52,590
intelligence are dying that's a lot of stats it's a lot but I don't really want

2824
04:55:52,590 --> 04:55:55,959
it we need it that's what I'm saying like a lot of stuff I'm getting is in

2825
04:55:55,959 --> 04:56:04,669
arc mind all this stuff that I don't want like where's the big boy smasher

2826
04:56:04,669 --> 04:56:20,659
all right we could keep going to the the thing at the archery was insane we

2827
04:56:20,659 --> 04:56:27,909
should probably upgrade our stuff don't you think I don't know what we need to

2828
04:56:27,950 --> 04:56:33,630
upgrade you want to run to I would like to run to the blacksmith guy again I

2829
04:56:33,630 --> 04:56:37,389
would like to upgrade the frenzy flame thing like it's pretty much the thing

2830
04:56:37,389 --> 04:56:51,669
I'm using warpo or we got to get to EG didn't work okay then we got to go fight

2831
04:56:51,669 --> 04:57:02,830
this giant salamander that takes no damage I vigor damn yeah you actually

2832
04:57:02,830 --> 04:57:09,180
want to fight this well I mean otherwise otherwise I just hear you I'm dead

2833
04:57:09,180 --> 04:57:12,380
already nevermind okay this thing has like a million health I don't think that

2834
04:57:12,380 --> 04:57:43,979
yeah we're not gonna kill us yeah no way I got you actually I'm gonna level up

2835
04:57:43,979 --> 04:57:54,700
yeah fire is bad on it yeah I can't level up because I died I got it sorry

2836
04:57:54,700 --> 04:58:12,470
don't we I you want to go get some ice cream let's do um we could just run to

2837
04:58:12,509 --> 04:58:24,119
the southern part EG to upgrade you wanted to upgrade I do yeah Ray LaCarr is

2838
04:58:24,119 --> 04:58:40,799
the the way to go but we don't have to do that I play five nights at Freddy's

2839
04:58:40,799 --> 04:58:48,060
to stir have you ever played five minutes of Freddy's no can we do a

2840
04:58:48,060 --> 04:58:52,459
stream where I just watch you I just stream you playing five minutes at

2841
04:58:52,459 --> 04:58:58,590
Freddy's we just kind of hang out sure all right cool it's an odd request but I

2842
04:58:58,669 --> 04:59:05,729
do it like I just get a bunch of snacks and shit and like and you just play and

2843
04:59:05,729 --> 04:59:09,729
we just watch you play I have never watched anyone play I like don't get it

2844
04:59:09,729 --> 04:59:15,049
I 100% don't understand five nights at Freddy's or like so I guess it'd be like

2845
04:59:15,049 --> 04:59:23,139
the raw the raw deal yeah is there a preference for like what's the good one

2846
04:59:23,139 --> 04:59:28,110
is there a VR ones good the VR one actually was pretty fun and what I played

2847
04:59:28,110 --> 04:59:37,650
of it but five nights at Freddy's 2 I think is probably the staple that's I

2848
04:59:37,650 --> 04:59:50,090
think the the apex of the series for a lot of people raw and then I'll just be

2849
04:59:50,090 --> 04:59:53,729
chatting I was laughing you and you get jump what's what's the dumbest game

2850
04:59:53,729 --> 04:59:57,689
you've ever gotten like scared while playing like the most scared you've been

2851
04:59:57,689 --> 05:00:07,119
but also like you really shouldn't have been scorned there was like there was

2852
05:00:07,159 --> 05:00:12,500
like three or four okay so in scorn this weapon container comes out of the ground

2853
05:00:12,500 --> 05:00:22,500
and I was not prepared for it and I screamed and it hurt my whole body I did

2854
05:00:22,500 --> 05:00:32,150
not expect it to be so recent or yeah now mine is a quake 4 hmm the quake 4

2855
05:00:32,150 --> 05:00:36,549
single-player there's a really dark area and I it it took me about an hour to

2856
05:00:36,549 --> 05:00:42,430
walk through slowly at the end of this level and if you like know the layout of

2857
05:00:42,430 --> 05:00:47,790
what you're doing it's it should take you about 30 seconds I'm kind of a jumpy

2858
05:00:47,790 --> 05:00:55,029
person though like I would say so even things that aren't supposed to jump scare

2859
05:00:55,029 --> 05:01:12,389
me they kind of do if they're quick I mean when quake 4 came out I was like 13

2860
05:01:12,389 --> 05:01:32,759
years old all right can I upgrade this who he sells cool stuff there we go all

2861
05:01:32,799 --> 05:01:45,220
right boom boom what did that do 172 scaling now on this thing nice do you

2862
05:01:45,220 --> 05:01:56,779
have a smithing stone 5 regular I do not I only have 4 yeah that's what my club

2863
05:01:56,779 --> 05:02:21,380
needs well I am gonna level up yeah plus 2 is the max on the mod yep can I turn

2864
05:02:21,419 --> 05:02:50,049
him off for a second me I'm gonna can I sit at the grace yeah 10,400 yet yet can

2865
05:02:50,049 --> 05:02:59,779
I have a do any crunchies I need 400 I feel like this happens a lot to you

2866
05:02:59,779 --> 05:03:06,029
they're constantly taking my crunchies well if you have extra crunchies then

2867
05:03:06,029 --> 05:03:22,090
you should be sharing them I need a level so I can equip some stuff all right now

2868
05:03:22,090 --> 05:03:31,750
I'm gonna be doing disgusting damage please don't accidentally shoot him you

2869
05:03:31,750 --> 05:03:51,900
take just a quick look some of the stuff I think might scale with faith whoa it's

2870
05:03:51,900 --> 05:04:09,540
to faith a faith scaling 35 strength but the only thing I have that scales us

2871
05:04:09,540 --> 05:04:26,540
eight yeah this is a one-hander though right no is it not anything can be a

2872
05:04:26,540 --> 05:04:44,099
one-hander it's true I think that's the only good thing I have for faith I think

2873
05:04:44,299 --> 05:04:52,130
the strength that's pretty damn good like I said a one-hander but well okay

2874
05:04:52,130 --> 05:04:59,520
well our last playthrough I did a big slow two-hander under that again yeah

2875
05:04:59,520 --> 05:05:03,040
but you weren't casting magic yeah but I wanted to be like I want to be a

2876
05:05:03,040 --> 05:05:23,889
predominantly spell caster oh follow me this is exciting we split that where

2877
05:05:23,889 --> 05:05:28,689
you're going we split that really well I mean we're going to carry a manner no

2878
05:05:28,689 --> 05:05:34,240
wait actually exciting I don't know where I'm going and you're gonna leave

2879
05:05:34,240 --> 05:06:08,939
the way yep it could be literally anywhere this whole wide open world yeah

2880
05:06:08,939 --> 05:06:42,720
can you frenzy this sure can easy that frost dump where are you taking me on a

2881
05:06:42,720 --> 05:07:01,159
date where are we going somewhere special I need to look at the map and

2882
05:07:01,159 --> 05:07:09,119
they won't let me look at the map I think it's this way hmm it's Applebee's

2883
05:07:09,159 --> 05:07:19,419
oh I love the riblets I know this should lead us to the the frenzied village where

2884
05:07:19,419 --> 05:07:35,419
you can get your your frenzy on I think I'm wrong no no no no I'm not it's a

2885
05:07:35,419 --> 05:07:45,479
long annoying path this is correct though I don't remember the last time I've

2886
05:07:45,479 --> 05:07:55,779
eaten an Applebee's like it's been a very very long time it's been a long

2887
05:07:55,779 --> 05:08:03,360
time yeah been a long time for me I think we go up here to the right then we

2888
05:08:03,360 --> 05:08:08,680
wrap around then we're up on the high ground it's just bears that just bears

2889
05:08:08,680 --> 05:08:13,279
everywhere Wow but bear seed Wow another bear are you serious there's more bears

2890
05:08:13,279 --> 05:08:20,669
there are a lot what is the staple at Applebee's what is the actual Applebee's

2891
05:08:20,669 --> 05:08:28,310
staple oh my fucking god don't please oh my god I got fucking killed by the bear

2892
05:08:28,310 --> 05:08:37,209
apparently enough enough bears dude just the stake of America I think it's

2893
05:08:37,209 --> 05:08:52,150
probably closer I don't know I don't know probably kind of forgetting I won't

2894
05:08:52,150 --> 05:09:13,330
let me look at the map so what's okay Applebee's Chili's Fridays what's

2895
05:09:13,330 --> 05:09:20,599
another that that tier of sit-down restaurant what's the best what's the

2896
05:09:20,599 --> 05:09:30,380
best what's the best one of those definitively which one is the best

2897
05:09:30,419 --> 05:09:37,650
Chili's whichever one's closest true they're all about the same I just remember

2898
05:09:37,650 --> 05:09:43,409
I remember being in a Friday's like one time not like I mean Fridays are all

2899
05:09:43,409 --> 05:09:51,209
right but I'd rather it be a Saturday the Olive Garden is the Olive Garden on

2900
05:09:51,209 --> 05:09:59,060
that tier it is right yeah for sure I would probably say Olive Garden gonna

2901
05:09:59,060 --> 05:10:05,509
say like red lobster and all that I don't remember this item actually is in

2902
05:10:05,509 --> 05:10:11,080
here this is a place well we'll find it eventually much over the gigantic axe

2903
05:10:11,080 --> 05:10:30,250
oh my face I just did a German scream I just I wanted to get this item because

2904
05:10:30,250 --> 05:10:38,509
it might be the frenzy fire all right I got the frenzy cookbook this crab I miss

2905
05:10:38,509 --> 05:10:46,680
I miss having wild strike already in God why do you have to be here I just want

2906
05:10:46,680 --> 05:11:24,099
to get the mask leave me alone why nothing to do with you such carnage okay

2907
05:11:24,099 --> 05:11:28,299
there is a giant over his still and I want to find the other frenzy spell I

2908
05:11:28,299 --> 05:11:42,150
think it's uh I think there is more up this hill there's like a chest yeah

2909
05:11:42,150 --> 05:11:48,630
Olive Garden I feel like Olive Garden is kind of a meme and people shit on it oh

2910
05:11:48,630 --> 05:11:52,990
Olive Garden oh yeah of course Olive Garden no don't forget the breadsticks

2911
05:11:53,029 --> 05:11:56,430
no but seriously don't they're good that's a that's a great thing to do soup

2912
05:11:56,430 --> 05:12:03,099
salad breadsticks actually is fucking pretty legit you're not gonna hear me

2913
05:12:03,099 --> 05:12:16,290
talking shit about soup salad breadsticks you're just not there there

2914
05:12:16,290 --> 05:12:26,360
balanced based even now the last time I ate at the Olive Garden it's been an

2915
05:12:26,360 --> 05:12:32,779
uncountable amount of years I don't I don't remember I am doesn't mean I

2916
05:12:32,779 --> 05:12:35,900
wouldn't because it's the closest there's a there's a Chili's near here I

2917
05:12:35,939 --> 05:12:39,779
mean I'm on team Chili's just again whatever's the closest what just

2918
05:12:39,779 --> 05:12:49,639
happened to me wait you died oh there was there was an invader here I died in

2919
05:12:49,639 --> 05:12:59,799
one hit yeah he's definitely is something off with the fucking roll I'm

2920
05:12:59,799 --> 05:13:07,680
telling you I'm not crazy yeah that was funny though cuz you went yeah it was

2921
05:13:07,680 --> 05:13:12,319
almost a song yeah like like normally in between those you'd be able to roll

2922
05:13:12,360 --> 05:13:19,450
that those are not like perfect roll catching doomsday swing I I just yeah

2923
05:13:19,450 --> 05:13:29,270
um there's something wrong it's been wrong the whole game I think it lets

2924
05:13:29,270 --> 05:13:32,509
you roll a little bit earlier out of hitstun because it buffers it differently

2925
05:13:32,509 --> 05:13:38,310
yeah but then actually you rolling earlier is like I do I don't know

2926
05:13:38,310 --> 05:13:42,389
something there I would do remember reading the change lock yeah it's not my

2927
05:13:42,389 --> 05:13:47,590
fault it's Jerma's fault I yeah yeah that's what your character did and then

2928
05:13:47,590 --> 05:13:53,360
you died I we need to work up there I don't know what where you are I'm

2929
05:13:53,360 --> 05:13:58,799
standing right on top of it oh I it respawned me somewhere else because I

2930
05:13:58,799 --> 05:14:16,869
don't know why oh I need to warp I can everyone's talking about vibes because

2931
05:14:16,869 --> 05:14:31,229
they're just all messed up right now you got a problem with the vibes do I do

2932
05:14:31,229 --> 05:14:38,799
something it's me isn't it are you where are you I'm traveling down from the

2933
05:14:38,799 --> 05:14:53,159

2934
05:14:53,159 --> 05:14:56,319
inquisitor is here we need to kill we have to kill this inquisitor yeah I'm

2935
05:14:56,319 --> 05:15:13,349
with you oh we're good vibes are back vibes are good I need to sit down at the

2936
05:15:13,549 --> 05:15:40,409
bonfire because I have like I have no HP okay let's continue so what did you get

2937
05:15:40,409 --> 05:15:45,779
from the town I didn't finish looting it I got a frenzied cookbook but there's

2938
05:15:45,779 --> 05:15:50,209
more stuff down there that I think I want to get I think to our left over

2939
05:15:50,209 --> 05:15:54,369
here hold up before we go back down yeah this is the tower this is I know this

2940
05:15:54,369 --> 05:15:58,169
something at the top of the tower and it makes you go the top of the tower is the

2941
05:15:58,169 --> 05:16:06,979
grab let's get it I think you might have to come yeah do not oh okay I don't know

2942
05:16:06,979 --> 05:16:10,700
what I was doing I don't know what I was thinking I just like saw it and I

2943
05:16:10,700 --> 05:16:13,500
thought I don't know you've been jumping around all game and I was like oh you

2944
05:16:13,500 --> 05:16:16,060
wouldn't probably jump I don't know you've been jumping around all game

2945
05:16:16,060 --> 05:16:23,119
then I'm like oh he probably is gonna jump with me I don't know nobody saw

2946
05:16:23,119 --> 05:16:28,400
that from Vinny's stream that's fair and valid that I made you do it because I'm

2947
05:16:28,400 --> 05:16:34,549
smarter than you welcome everybody from vine sauce what's up playing some Eldon

2948
05:16:34,549 --> 05:16:42,830
ring co-op randomizer with Diablo 2 loot and some of reforged it's a little

2949
05:16:42,830 --> 05:16:51,279
messy but we are getting through it I mean what's a bowl of spaghetti if it's

2950
05:16:51,279 --> 05:17:01,220
not all over your shirt okay we I almost died again you're following me don't we

2951
05:17:01,220 --> 05:17:06,979
want to go up to the top of the tower no I mean no you're following me I am

2952
05:17:07,299 --> 05:17:20,060
you choose where to go it's off a cliff but thanks to the raid welcome everybody

2953
05:17:20,060 --> 05:17:42,360
vibes are back vibes restored okay get on your horsey this is not affecting me

2954
05:17:42,360 --> 05:17:48,259
at all it will when you get closer why do I feel like when I played before it

2955
05:17:48,259 --> 05:17:54,900
was very very far away it was just line of sight that's okay so that's weird I

2956
05:17:54,900 --> 05:18:02,770
remember being much much much I think there's a way worse angle you can come

2957
05:18:02,770 --> 05:18:35,060
at it from okay you climb I look at ancestral loot excuse me there's somebody

2958
05:18:35,060 --> 05:18:54,970
coming down the ladder what I'm coming somebody coming down the ladder all

2959
05:18:54,970 --> 05:19:07,959
right me me I'm ladder you missed the chest I'm killing these things first

2960
05:19:07,959 --> 05:19:19,659
god damn it no yeah I forgot it's it's not just an easy enemy it's like this

2961
05:19:19,659 --> 05:19:25,700
fucking thing up whatever the hell it's like rats and bugs all right I I thought

2962
05:19:25,700 --> 05:19:29,139
it was gonna be like the default shitty enemies but it's like a bunch of rats

2963
05:19:29,139 --> 05:19:35,819
and it's a huge flower these vibes are are way off I was like oh yeah these

2964
05:19:35,819 --> 05:19:39,060
guys die in one hit they're so easy wait that's right it randomized everything

2965
05:19:39,060 --> 05:20:10,750
there's a giant flower up there are you dead no close it's still alive it's got

2966
05:20:10,790 --> 05:20:22,490
a lot of hell what's going on up here what's going on up here damn it shoot

2967
05:20:22,490 --> 05:20:53,259
him oh god the vibes are a bit off but we have a message saying that they're

2968
05:20:53,259 --> 05:21:00,069
explaining something here Elden reforge changes the combat system so attacks

2969
05:21:00,069 --> 05:21:05,069
that you can jump over or duck under with the new duck are not I framed by

2970
05:21:05,069 --> 05:21:09,270
dodges there should have been a tutorial at the beginning of the game for this

2971
05:21:09,270 --> 05:21:15,580
but I don't think it worked because of the randomizer what how do you even how

2972
05:21:15,580 --> 05:21:21,740
would you even know what those attacks are I don't know basically any attack

2973
05:21:21,740 --> 05:21:31,740
you can duck or jump do not have iframes I don't even wonder which ones are the

2974
05:21:32,220 --> 05:21:49,330
did these vibes fucking stay these vibes smell they're rotting to buy a health

2975
05:21:49,330 --> 05:22:17,200
bar is I'm like a level two right now good all right all right where is it one

2976
05:22:17,200 --> 05:22:24,139
floor down you didn't have to come up here and told you there's a chest nice

2977
05:22:24,139 --> 05:22:42,090
yep yep yep yep yep yep vibes vibes vibes vibes vibes vibes I forgot what

2978
05:22:42,090 --> 05:22:56,650
that hold castle is over there check it out these a bonfire oh I bet you could

2979
05:22:56,650 --> 05:23:13,380
oh this must be a memory slot thing oh you do the thing we don't have it we

2980
05:23:13,380 --> 05:23:21,040
don't have the emote oh no emote bunch of losers showed up without the emote

2981
05:23:21,080 --> 05:23:31,569
okay so all right I got some cool spells I got some shoot whatever it is let me

2982
05:23:31,569 --> 05:23:46,540
see that helmet though what was it did they pick it up oh it's a talisman yeah

2983
05:23:46,540 --> 05:23:59,759
never mind there's another spell is it in that they're in the town somewhere

2984
05:23:59,759 --> 05:24:02,919
there should be another one I think a giant was just kind of a fit in the ass

2985
05:24:02,919 --> 05:24:15,580
I'm just maybe just run around and grab stuff I'll meet you back in the town you

2986
05:24:15,580 --> 05:24:27,409
got it where were you jumping to I don't know see the vibes that something's

2987
05:24:27,409 --> 05:24:31,049
going on tonight something with that you could I couldn't I frame on the jump I

2988
05:24:31,049 --> 05:24:51,380
can just normal Elden ring that's you can do that that's fine no vibe frames

2989
05:24:51,380 --> 05:25:04,580
it's true okay I actually have a health bar now did you eat pizza tonight well

2990
05:25:04,580 --> 05:25:10,020
that depends did you have pizza last night if the answer is yes is that pizza

2991
05:25:10,020 --> 05:25:14,340
leftovers that answer is yes then by all means he'd eat the leftovers make sure

2992
05:25:14,340 --> 05:25:17,979
you don't waste any of that you know it's still good if you've eaten to a

2993
05:25:17,979 --> 05:25:21,299
pizza yesterday there's no leftovers and you're ordering another pizza today I

2994
05:25:21,299 --> 05:25:35,090
would say probably I would say probably not I have a question about that you

2995
05:25:35,090 --> 05:25:38,770
could put any toppings you want on a pizza yeah like what a pizza is can

2996
05:25:38,770 --> 05:25:44,259
really vary can we kill this I ordered a pizza yesterday but the pizza you're

2997
05:25:44,299 --> 05:25:49,970
ordering today is vastly different the fuck that we need to we need to figure

2998
05:25:49,970 --> 05:25:53,490
out the dude we got to figure out the dodge thing because I can't dodge any

2999
05:25:53,490 --> 05:26:03,380
moves I have not been having that issue you just got hit five times we just

3000
05:26:03,380 --> 05:26:17,959
watched it I wasn't dodging though like okay give me he's gonna smack and see

3001
05:26:18,520 --> 05:26:30,369
see I uh you got hit he's gonna smack yep you got hit your vibes stink right

3002
05:26:30,369 --> 05:26:43,099
now your vibes are your vibes are awful right now all right we need to try

3003
05:26:43,099 --> 05:26:53,299
blocking all right doc can you are we gonna figure this out or what how the

3004
05:26:53,299 --> 05:27:05,180
dodge works in this game I guess how do we figure that out we have to find a

3005
05:27:05,180 --> 05:27:10,529
default enemy and just try to swing like dodge through stuff okay okay this crab

3006
05:27:10,569 --> 05:27:14,909
does like a really you'll do like the the slam this thing is awful to test

3007
05:27:14,909 --> 05:27:23,259
this on no huh become slam you dodged didn't dodge that you should have dodged

3008
05:27:23,259 --> 05:27:42,020
you okay hold on he sucks this guy sucks I'm asleep I've dude I've never seen

3009
05:27:42,020 --> 05:27:52,209
that status effect all right let's test it yeah we got to figure this out dude

3010
05:27:52,209 --> 05:27:56,139
there's no such thing as a dodge role in this game well does the other can we

3011
05:27:56,180 --> 05:28:05,689
do the other dodge where you just like the crouch weird dodge right no you you

3012
05:28:05,689 --> 05:28:19,000
should have that come on do this the thing you just did do it another move

3013
05:28:19,000 --> 05:28:27,830
all right you try it all right you die you duck under that but I couldn't duck

3014
05:28:27,830 --> 05:28:50,650
under it I I think I was just lucky cuz I did it if that's the timing all right

3015
05:28:50,689 --> 05:28:55,889
so wait a minute you mean to tell me if a five hours and 30 minutes we have not

3016
05:28:55,889 --> 05:28:59,369
been able to have i-frames when we thought we fixed a setting we just

3017
05:28:59,369 --> 05:29:15,259
haven't yeah yeah this is undodgeable I thought we fixed it oh I was everything

3018
05:29:15,259 --> 05:29:19,639
just felt so wrong everything is felt so off the whole time and it's because we

3019
05:29:19,639 --> 05:29:26,180
don't have a touch roll anymore we have to jump it all right we'll try that but

3020
05:29:26,299 --> 05:29:35,360
I know that there was something in this mod and it might I hate dude what that

3021
05:29:35,360 --> 05:29:41,419
might be it I remember that I think the classes have their own ways of dodging

3022
05:29:41,419 --> 05:29:51,290
oh did I get all the items I don't remember we don't have a class there's

3023
05:29:51,290 --> 05:30:04,950
one more spell here right isn't there one more spell I know I'm gonna look it

3024
05:30:04,950 --> 05:30:15,580
up you run around and vibe I think if you go up and then you go onto those

3025
05:30:15,580 --> 05:30:19,580
castle ramparts yeah you like jump on the castle then like bike invades you

3026
05:30:19,580 --> 05:30:36,040
and you can get something oh yeah I think it's because we have randomizer we

3027
05:30:36,040 --> 05:30:40,220
randomized the person in the tutorial right like we should have gotten

3028
05:30:40,220 --> 05:30:47,560
somebody that we also kind of have an issue with a d2 loot was overriding I'm

3029
05:30:47,560 --> 05:31:02,639
just all messed up oh yeah there is no bike that was the Giza guy that spell

3030
05:31:02,680 --> 05:31:14,090
isn't a dung beetle no it's not them it's not the mods fault it's we have

3031
05:31:14,090 --> 05:31:16,810
just a lot of shit turned on and I guess we didn't realize that we were

3032
05:31:16,810 --> 05:31:23,330
overriding stuff with other stuff that is really funny though that we've been

3033
05:31:23,330 --> 05:31:41,020
operating essentially without a dodge roll this whole time I mean there are a

3034
05:31:41,020 --> 05:31:45,939
lot of people saying that in the post that there's no iframes they're not

3035
05:31:45,939 --> 05:31:50,439
running any other mods and they don't know what the problem is but also we're

3036
05:31:50,439 --> 05:31:57,069
on an older version of the mod and I don't know that's it's alright it's fine

3037
05:31:57,069 --> 05:32:20,380
we're having fun oh no our modded sky room why the older version because the

3038
05:32:20,380 --> 05:32:26,180
older version stir correct me if I'm wrong but was compatible with d2 yeah

3039
05:32:26,180 --> 05:32:30,419
the d2 items have a compatibility patch and it only works with an older version

3040
05:32:30,419 --> 05:32:37,700
of reforged like these posts on the forum that are saying there's issues

3041
05:32:37,700 --> 05:32:44,110
with the iframes are from like very recently so I don't know I don't know if

3042
05:32:44,110 --> 05:32:50,080
we missed something in the the classes or but we kill things in two seconds

3043
05:32:50,080 --> 05:32:55,729
anyways it's like yeah it's not been that big of a problem surprisingly to

3044
05:32:55,729 --> 05:33:03,159
not have dodge roll I think we just have I expected it's been confusing a big

3045
05:33:03,159 --> 05:33:07,840
thing that the mod also does is it changes a lot of hitboxes on attacks so

3046
05:33:08,319 --> 05:33:13,360
the hitbox is exactly where the weapon is so it might feel like dodge rolls are

3047
05:33:13,360 --> 05:33:16,319
working because your character model is getting smaller and moving out of the

3048
05:33:16,319 --> 05:33:20,319
way of it hmm like what when a giant does like giant overhead slam on the

3049
05:33:20,319 --> 05:33:25,840
ground it's like a much smaller hitbox and your role is moving you so like

3050
05:33:25,840 --> 05:33:34,080
sometimes it's working which is why we probably haven't noticed it where's this

3051
05:33:34,080 --> 05:33:37,319
this one more spell somebody said it's outside there's like a pack of rats

3052
05:33:37,319 --> 05:33:47,909
not further away honestly if you want to play reforge just play reforge it

3053
05:33:47,909 --> 05:33:52,479
doesn't mix well with other mods stuff breaks you should do randomizer plus DSL

3054
05:33:52,479 --> 05:33:58,549
only if you want to play reforge do that on its own pretty balanced take on it I

3055
05:33:58,549 --> 05:34:02,709
think yeah we were really close to doing one or the other before the stream

3056
05:34:02,709 --> 05:34:07,319
started and then someone had some advice to get them to work a bit better and it

3057
05:34:07,319 --> 05:34:11,340
seemed to be working pretty well they were just like we'd already spent a lot

3058
05:34:11,340 --> 05:34:21,889
of time on it okay let me remember I gotta find this where is this pack you

3059
05:34:21,889 --> 05:34:26,509
know what this says with this pack of rats is uphill the hill towards the

3060
05:34:26,509 --> 05:34:34,770
chapel but turn left and then find the dung beetle you mean like over here like

3061
05:34:34,770 --> 05:34:44,970
up this way up the hill like up here what's the item another frenzy spell

3062
05:34:44,970 --> 05:34:59,340
apparently like up here off this way okay well it was a fun attempt I mean

3063
05:34:59,340 --> 05:35:05,099
can't get everything to work perfectly every time I really haven't even been

3064
05:35:05,099 --> 05:35:10,299
rolling I've just been wild striking okay

3065
05:35:10,299 --> 05:35:29,150
wheezing through attacks so where is this other spell up here looking for a

3066
05:35:29,150 --> 05:35:37,080
pack of it's not gonna be rats it'll be something else in that little forest I

3067
05:35:37,080 --> 05:36:27,810
go over here is this supposed to be them I guess there's a lot of shit here oh my

3068
05:36:27,810 --> 05:36:36,509
god will you leave me the fuck alone Miyazaki grows in power where is the

3069
05:36:36,790 --> 05:36:45,220
it's like the little dung beetle there was there was one like up the path just

3070
05:36:45,220 --> 05:36:49,700
fucking tell if I swear to God it's the worst enemy in the whole game it just

3071
05:36:49,700 --> 05:37:01,360
teleports okay we're looking for a dung beetle wait you mean that I wish I

3072
05:37:01,360 --> 05:37:06,000
could even look over here I wish I could walk over here and attack but I can't

3073
05:37:06,000 --> 05:37:12,950
you need a hand I'm the kind of looking but you're you're having some issues

3074
05:37:12,950 --> 05:37:16,189
it's hard people saying look look it's hard to look where there's a million

3075
05:37:16,189 --> 05:37:19,990
fucking things shooting and fighting and teleporting on you look at this guy

3076
05:37:19,990 --> 05:37:26,540
teleporting this instant transmission it's d-spawn good I don't even care

3077
05:37:26,540 --> 05:37:34,689
just dot just I frame dodge it just oh my god are you you're not joking I told

3078
05:37:34,689 --> 05:37:41,090
you you can't dodge it and you can't get away from them you can wild strike it

3079
05:37:41,090 --> 05:37:54,360
refuse to get off the horse yeah I don't want to get off the horse because there's

3080
05:37:54,360 --> 05:38:07,540
no I freight there's no dodging I think what it killed me in two seconds I don't

3081
05:38:07,580 --> 05:38:21,630
have wild strikes like he does I think the thing despawned what thing I was

3082
05:38:21,630 --> 05:38:24,790
looking for a dung beetle is apparently something over there yeah I think there

3083
05:38:24,790 --> 05:38:40,340
were dung beetles and then we startled with them yes the beetle ran away when

3084
05:38:40,340 --> 05:38:54,540
you started getting attacked why it's hard to run after it we'll never know

3085
05:38:54,540 --> 05:38:58,540
alright so what do you want to do do you want to do you want to keep playing this

3086
05:38:58,540 --> 05:39:01,700
or do you want to like fix this and try it again some other time or what do you

3087
05:39:01,900 --> 05:39:08,639
what do you what do you want to do I would rather play it correctly I don't

3088
05:39:08,639 --> 05:39:12,560
want to have no I don't want to have no dodge roll the whole time we play this

3089
05:39:12,560 --> 05:39:22,540
then in that case I mean at that point when we have to make new characters

3090
05:39:22,540 --> 05:39:29,889
completely oh shit to like start the game with the proper stuff we were

3091
05:39:29,889 --> 05:39:37,259
supposed to have and then I think at that point like we probably have to ditch

3092
05:39:37,259 --> 05:39:46,340
I guess we'd just be ditching randomizer and then Diablo 2 loot would stay so we

3093
05:39:46,340 --> 05:39:53,740
wouldn't have to restart we would just have to turn off randomizer well how

3094
05:39:53,740 --> 05:39:58,099
about this how about we let's restore the vibes let's go kill something fun and

3095
05:39:58,099 --> 05:40:04,889
then we will maybe we'll try to get another time okay we have to restore the

3096
05:40:04,889 --> 05:40:08,169
vibes though we have to kill have to restore the vibes they have to be

3097
05:40:08,169 --> 05:40:18,099
restored where is the most convenient to fight major boss that we have not done

3098
05:40:18,099 --> 05:40:30,069
I mean we could just we do but we did Godric could run through the castle of

3099
05:40:30,069 --> 05:40:36,970
Lucaria I just sprint through the castle is it easier to sprint oh carry a

3100
05:40:36,970 --> 05:40:41,259
manner if we just ran to where Laura it is yeah let's do that let's get the

3101
05:40:41,259 --> 05:41:06,770
vibes back we have to get them back I tried to click it didn't work reforged

3102
05:41:06,770 --> 05:41:23,740
adds secure style timed blocks it does stirs you know that no here let me read

3103
05:41:23,779 --> 05:41:29,000
you a couple of important things we're playing this we're playing this

3104
05:41:29,000 --> 05:41:34,240
completely wrong for almost six hours removed the instant input buffer for

3105
05:41:34,240 --> 05:41:40,270
roles on most player stagger animations that's why we're like I think it was

3106
05:41:40,270 --> 05:42:00,060
more that the rules don't have I frames where I'm looking at the defects are a

3107
05:42:00,060 --> 05:42:05,720
powerful time blocks they give more skill and power to blocking holy shit

3108
05:42:06,000 --> 05:42:11,270
all right we got to restore these vibes man I'm there hanging by a thread right

3109
05:42:11,270 --> 05:42:30,669
now I need him restored didn't read well I didn't hold up hold up hold up I got

3110
05:42:30,669 --> 05:42:34,389
it I'm telling you I've read a lot of it I didn't read very specifically dodge

3111
05:42:34,389 --> 05:42:39,189
roll the whole mechanic of all souls games we thought like we could do it

3112
05:42:39,189 --> 05:42:48,139
better the hubris blocking updated let me find the important bits we're gonna

3113
05:42:48,259 --> 05:42:58,299
get these vibes back man we're gonna kill something you recover from block

3114
05:42:58,299 --> 05:43:01,419
animations a lot quicker so you can act more quickly out of them deflect

3115
05:43:01,419 --> 05:43:04,819
blocking an enemy attack within the first few frames of a weapons block

3116
05:43:04,819 --> 05:43:14,209
animation will perform a deflect is this walking in are we just drinking though

3117
05:43:14,209 --> 05:43:18,650
the copium or are we just bad like is there actually no I frames or are we

3118
05:43:18,650 --> 05:43:22,970
just awful like I don't think we're bad because we I need to haven't we haven't

3119
05:43:22,970 --> 05:43:36,909
been I need to know we've been doing fine yeah this page doesn't say anything

3120
05:43:36,909 --> 05:43:41,509
about dodge rolls it just says there is a there is a timed block mechanic and

3121
05:43:41,509 --> 05:43:49,060
then everything else all right well we're gonna restore the vibes we're

3122
05:43:49,060 --> 05:43:54,020
gonna kill a boss we're gonna say nice and then maybe we'll figure it out we'll

3123
05:43:54,020 --> 05:43:58,259
come back and try it again with the vibes restored which I don't I mean I

3124
05:43:58,259 --> 05:44:18,060
don't know we'll see we'll see okay teleporting to where let's do oh we're

3125
05:44:18,060 --> 05:44:29,310
gonna do carry a manner yes we didn't delete the right files for randomizer

3126
05:44:29,310 --> 05:44:39,139
compatibility hey sometimes you try to do a bunch of mods and it goes great

3127
05:44:39,139 --> 05:44:46,099
sometimes you do a bunch of mods and you can no longer I frame hey that's just

3128
05:44:46,099 --> 05:44:55,930
the way it is let me try one thing real quick we want to give me a second I got

3129
05:44:55,930 --> 05:45:01,560
to get my like cheat sheet open of what the menus do again I don't know where

3130
05:45:01,560 --> 05:45:19,009
they went I sit here at bonfire are we gonna change like a setting yeah top one

3131
05:45:19,009 --> 05:45:26,889
event text huh so one was saying this earlier actually this might be what it

3132
05:45:26,889 --> 05:45:31,250
was normal mode is supposed to have normal dodge rolls but I crashed earlier

3133
05:45:31,250 --> 05:45:37,419
and when I came back there's a possibility that it reverted so we did

3134
05:45:37,419 --> 05:45:43,590
the top one down to down to you know no no no wait okay reset Reese I lost my

3135
05:45:43,590 --> 05:45:51,819
train of thought go way back to the beginning okay top one top one okay two

3136
05:45:51,819 --> 05:46:09,090
down yeah that's such a jump scare so what did that what did that do that set

3137
05:46:09,090 --> 05:46:16,169
it to normal Elden ring difficulty which does by default normal difficulty mode

3138
05:46:16,169 --> 05:46:20,939
is enabled this difficulty mode well I don't the other difficulties like the

3139
05:46:20,939 --> 05:46:24,060
higher and weirder difficulties start changing how many I frames you have on

3140
05:46:24,060 --> 05:46:33,369
dodges all right well let's go kill a boss and I might have accidentally turned

3141
05:46:33,369 --> 05:46:47,750
one of them on earlier and game crashing might have brought it back okay how you

3142
05:46:47,750 --> 05:46:53,229
doing I have one more thing I wanted to get to the bottom this before the stream

3143
05:46:53,229 --> 05:47:00,790
ends there do you want to go or do you want it all right exit let's go I'm

3144
05:47:00,790 --> 05:47:10,200
sorry sit in the theme I'm sitting down I'm getting the picture picture yeah I'm

3145
05:47:10,240 --> 05:47:18,439
getting the picture because we definitely accidentally goofed around

3146
05:47:18,439 --> 05:47:22,479
with these and killed ourselves a few times which many did we activate it

3147
05:47:22,479 --> 05:47:51,709
something we shouldn't know god damn it you good I'm sorry I'm transcribing top

3148
05:47:51,709 --> 05:48:01,419
one bottom one okay for every single one of these yeah open them and then choose

3149
05:48:01,419 --> 05:48:09,000
no choose no yeah it's turning all of the special weirdo options off if any of

3150
05:48:09,000 --> 05:48:16,680
them were accidentally on because some of these there's like a sure a mode and

3151
05:48:16,680 --> 05:48:22,889
it's like hey this decreases I frames by like half and it's hard mode okay so

3152
05:48:22,889 --> 05:48:30,270
like some of them might have been on oh shit okay okay let's go

3153
05:48:30,270 --> 05:48:40,159
you're all showing up like that for chat because of how many mods are enabled

3230
06:03:45,779 --> 06:03:51,220
I'm ready to go in for one more dumb attempt dumb attempt what makes this

3231
06:03:51,220 --> 06:03:56,290
attempt dumb the fact that we're doing it in the first place again it is pretty

3232
06:03:56,290 --> 06:03:59,930
dumb cuz I'm I'm like at the bonfire and you've started oh I thought you were

3233
06:03:59,930 --> 06:04:07,729
okay I thought you were serious that you were done I'm gonna try the deflect

3234
06:04:07,729 --> 06:04:16,740
thing I didn't do it once but it still ate all my stamina but I didn't take any

3235
06:04:16,740 --> 06:04:43,500
health damage I mean it's no I'm glad I may challenge the boss area now your l2

3236
06:04:43,500 --> 06:04:55,569
is better than frenzy this thing doesn't do very much damage I mean I my whole

3237
06:04:55,569 --> 06:05:01,860
computer just crashed okay my Elden ring crashed but it's still up on my stream

3238
06:05:01,860 --> 06:05:10,540
that's fun how there's nothing on my screen Elden ring is crashed right now

3239
06:05:10,540 --> 06:05:16,840
and but I can look over at the OBS preview and see you fighting well you

3240
06:05:17,240 --> 06:05:34,259
say how do you dodge fire is what they say it's all right there was worth an

3241
06:05:34,259 --> 06:05:43,209
attempt worth it was look I had fun I had fun hey when you install a bunch of

3242
06:05:43,209 --> 06:05:46,610
random mods and you get in and sometimes sometimes it don't work well together

3243
06:05:46,610 --> 06:05:50,250
sometimes they get screwed up sometimes there's no tutorial because we broke it

3244
06:05:50,250 --> 06:05:56,139
by deleting the tutorial by having something happen in the randomizer and

3245
06:05:56,139 --> 06:06:00,580
then we just you know the vibes get a little fucked up start sometimes

3246
06:06:00,580 --> 06:06:14,319
sometimes sometimes I've got this don't even worry about it five and a half

3247
06:06:14,319 --> 06:06:18,340
hours went by and you didn't notice oh no we did I just think that we but I

3248
06:06:18,340 --> 06:06:25,729
think we both thought it was so used to being gaslit that like I brought it up

3249
06:06:25,729 --> 06:06:29,090
at least a dozen times and we were just like no wait maybe I just like stink at

3250
06:06:29,090 --> 06:06:48,830
this game yeah I just honestly I had fun it was fun it was worth doing I think

3251
06:06:48,830 --> 06:06:55,520
it was worth it yeah we got to the point where I think

3252
06:06:55,520 --> 06:06:59,630
once you get past early game you need to start being able to dodge things well

3253
06:06:59,630 --> 06:07:08,560
I'm sorry it's all good it was definitely worth doing hey seamless co-op mod

3254
06:07:08,560 --> 06:07:15,299
works pretty flawlessly didn't yeah vibes and toilet vibes but you know

3255
06:07:15,299 --> 06:07:18,419
whatever it's all right they all you look sometimes you get toilet vibes but

3256
06:07:18,419 --> 06:07:24,709
we're good everything's are you good how do you feel you feel I'm good yeah we're

3257
06:07:24,709 --> 06:07:35,020
good everything's fine I mean we had just played like it was definitely worth

3258
06:07:35,020 --> 06:07:38,580

3259
06:07:38,580 --> 06:07:43,380

3260
06:07:43,380 --> 06:07:46,779
like I had fun because I wanted to play more Elden ring I don't think there's a

3261
06:07:46,779 --> 06:07:50,970
problem with that there's no problem with that but it's bedtime it's like

3267
06:08:30,490 --> 06:08:35,970

06:08:35,970 --> 06:08:39,869
becoming Elden Lord that's just like you know let's just put some more stuff on

3269
06:08:39,869 --> 06:08:43,939
and see what happens the vibes got a little fucked up that we know whatever

3270
06:08:43,939 --> 06:08:55,240
that's all good is your PC okay yeah I can change scenes it's just Elden ring

3271
06:08:55,240 --> 06:09:05,310
is just not on my monitor just like not here I can change scenes in OBS maybe

3272
06:09:05,310 --> 06:09:11,020
try something like randomizer and double bosses or something hmm you're making it

3273
06:09:11,020 --> 06:09:17,830
you're making it sound bad no no no no no no I had a good time all that matters

3274
06:09:17,830 --> 06:09:27,229
is me and start talking about like fucking bugs and stuff who cares thanks

3275
06:09:27,229 --> 06:09:35,419
for sticking around regardless the next time you see me will be on Wednesday and

3276
06:09:35,419 --> 06:09:49,180
Wednesday we are going to do hmm wouldn't you like to know we'll see I'll

3277
06:09:49,180 --> 06:09:56,540
figure out a game maybe maybe the hitman stuff kind of wanted to do it maybe the

3278
06:09:56,540 --> 06:10:05,790
hitman stuff if not that then we'll see that'll be a decision for Tuesday night

3279
06:10:11,020 --> 06:10:15,409
oh let me say this too I said that worst dream of the year is not going to be a

3280
06:10:15,409 --> 06:10:20,740
category this year I said that specifically because it's kind of to

3281
06:10:20,740 --> 06:10:25,040
prevent because I know I told you guys that a lot of the streams this year are

3282
06:10:25,040 --> 06:10:30,119
gonna be more chill slowed down a lot and it's kind of a way to prevent people

3283
06:10:30,119 --> 06:10:34,319
to come into like a chill stream and go oh this is boring worst dream of the

3284
06:10:34,319 --> 06:10:39,639
year 2023 right because I feel like that's definitely possible because if

3285
06:10:39,639 --> 06:10:44,439
if I'm gonna be doing more just chill kind of slower streams then I think it

3286
06:10:44,479 --> 06:10:51,779
kind of takes takes that out of the equation because otherwise it would be

3287
06:10:51,779 --> 06:10:56,299
like looking over here at the pit cross again got a lot of fucking nominations

3288
06:10:56,299 --> 06:11:05,040
for that category this year so I don't think I think I'd rather just not have

3289
06:11:05,040 --> 06:11:18,419
it be there otherwise it might be a large category yeah thanks for watching

3290
06:11:18,419 --> 06:11:26,259
Ellen ring with stir stir is awesome give it up for stir take care of

3291
06:11:26,259 --> 06:11:35,860
yourselves have a great night see you Wednesday Wednesday you know the time 6

3292
06:11:35,860 --> 06:11:52,319
p.m. Pacific you have an email you if you if anybody needs to wants to contact

3293
06:11:52,319 --> 06:11:57,279
me for any it's for business purposes I don't believe yeah it's the evolved one

3294
06:11:57,279 --> 06:12:08,720
the evolved email that's on my Twitter is but that's for business stuff though

3295
06:12:08,720 --> 06:12:14,000
if you like send a message of this it's probably not gonna get um about my get

3296
06:12:14,000 --> 06:12:18,799
filtered or something it's mostly for business stuff but I don't really do

3297
06:12:18,799 --> 06:12:21,200
anything else
