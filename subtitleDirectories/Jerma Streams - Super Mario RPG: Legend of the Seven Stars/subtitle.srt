1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:13,060
What is going on in this chat room? This is just- it's just a bunch of words. Just nonsense words.

2
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:29,750
Wait, what do you mean Nightbot? Nightbot isn't modded? What? How? That makes no sense. What?

3
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:42,060
Where is Nightbot? Where is he? So there's this Nightbot. Wait, I can't see. Not- I gotta-

4
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:53,380
Nightbot isn't- why is Nightbot not modded? What the fuck? All right, now it's- now you-

5
00:00:53,380 --> 00:01:12,900
all the fun is over and now I understand. Okay, I see. You've been purged. Yeah, Nightbot is

6
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,969
my security guard who's sleeping at his desk. I just had to go and like shake his desk for a second.

7
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,500
Okay, I just shook my desk and all my fucking monitors are screwed up. Hold on, what the

8
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,379
fuck just happened? I just shook my desk and my- my desktop on my computer flickered and all my

9
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:40,459
icons have moved and my- hold on, I think my display thing pulled out. Yep, okay, I don't know

10
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:46,459
what to do about this. Yeah, okay, well it doesn't matter. I have three monitors and the middle

11
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:52,939
monitor's DVI cable just got unplugged. It's okay because we don't need it. What do we need that for?

12
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:02,010
You understand? You know what we're doing tonight, right? By popular demand, and I do mean popular,

13
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:15,030
we're going to play my favorite video game of all time. Ever. I have a top five.

14
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:25,240
It's up there. It's probably number one or two or three. I don't know. It's definitely in the-

15
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,919
I would say, you know, it's not fair to have a top five video games you've ever played in your whole

16
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:39,370
life. They're all number one. You don't get to choose in that point, I don't think. We're going

17
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:46,580
to play Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars. Now when you ask me why are we doing that,

18
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,409
because a few weeks ago we talked about our favorite games and would you ever stream some

19
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,889
of your old favorites or have like a nostalgia relaxing kind of stream night and I'm like,

20
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:04,090
I don't know. I've played them a lot. Probably not. But then I just said, fuck it. Sure, why not?

21
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:16,759
So we're going to play Mario RPG. That's the plan. Didn't you say Chrono Trigger was your

22
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:26,009
favorite? They're all my favorites. There's five or six of them. I have beaten this game many times,

23
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:32,090
although I don't remember everything every time, right? Small details get lost. Even some of the

24
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:40,090
large details do as well. But I do end up playing through this game like once every three to four

25
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:49,479
years. It's a great one. If you've never seen this game, you've never played it, then you're in for

26
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:56,680
a treat. In fact, if you've never played this game before, just go get it and delete me from

27
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,479
right now. There's no, just enjoy it. It's a fucking fantastic or experience it with all of us

28
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:16,220
if you want to. And why don't we switch over to it right now? This, by the way, has some of the best

29
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:24,139
music ever from any video game. Uh, Yoko Shimomura, I believe, uh, is the composer.

30
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:34,139
And I am a purist when it comes to this kind of things. This is Mario. This is not Jeremy. This

31
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:44,060
is not Jax. This is Super Mario. I'm not going to name, all the characters have to be their actual

32
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:54,949
names. I can't do it. Because every conversation that comes up throughout the course of this entire

33
00:04:54,949 --> 00:05:04,009
game, it's Mario, Mario, Mario, hey Mario, Mario. I don't want to be called Peter. I don't want to

34
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:12,490
be called pee pants. Hey, pee pants. Hey, uh, Larry. No, this is Mario. If there was character

35
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:20,629
customization, sure. If I could change Mario's hat and pants color and take his mustache off and

36
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:27,449
make his nose bigger, okay, then that's not Mario. But it is. I'm going to do it just like it shows

37
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:40,860
up on TV. No, I'm not going to do Jario. I can't do that. This is, that's Mario right there. What

38
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:48,649
do you mean boring? No, it's, you're, you're ruining my childhood. Settle down. This is Super

39
00:05:48,649 --> 00:06:24,420
Mario. No, I'm going to, I'm supposed to be relaxing. Hold on. Hold on. You know what's funny about

40
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:37,139
this? Everybody when they were younger just made this their name. And it's not correct.

41
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,949
You would go to Blockbuster and rent this shit. And there would be a few save files from people

42
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:50,389
that got, I don't know, a 10th of the way through the game. And it was like Steve,

43
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:58,300
Matt, Andrew, Catherine. Nobody ever did Mario. And it's, that's who that is.

44
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:46,470
No, I can't do that. I'm a purist. It's going to be Mario. Come on. Let's go. Who the fuck is Ralph?

45
00:07:49,019 --> 00:08:06,410
Oh shit. It's right. I rented this from Blockbuster. That's right. Sometimes I forget where I got it.

46
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,300
This is Zack.

47
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:19,060
Calm the fuck down. This is not like an exciting game. It is. All right. Quiet.

48
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:53,019
The game starts off like any other Mario game. You got Bowser. You got Princess. You've got the

49
00:08:53,019 --> 00:09:13,429
castle. And you got Mario. We get in there. Ah, I remember this. Yep. Wow. So you can jump. You can

50
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:23,429
run. That's pretty much what you do in every Mario game that you've ever played. You can jump.

51
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:28,490
No, you can't. See, I'm one of these, this is, I, this is my favorite kind of RPG. Oh, Jeremy,

52
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,450
how come you don't like most RPGs turn-based? Because I don't like having to randomly fight

53
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:39,289
enemies. Chrono Trigger did the same shit. You don't have to fight people. You can just run

54
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:43,769
around them. There's no random battles. I hate random battles. I want to see them on the screen.

55
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:51,850
Anyways, you got a B and A and X and a Y like the Super Nintendo controller. A Y, by the way,

56
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:58,730
is your special moves. B is defense and running away. X is items and A is attack. Now this game

57
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:12,200
implemented one of the, I've made this video. I've already made this video. I'm getting nostalgia

58
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,179
not on the game, but on the video that I made like six years ago. Yes, there are timed hits

59
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:21,379
and there are timed defenses as well. And usually I'm pretty good at this, but you know, it's been a

60
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:31,129
few years. I didn't get it. It's right after he lands. So it's like do, do, do, A. A is time,

61
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,259
A is timed hits when you block and when you are attacking. Although I'm not getting experience

62
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:44,379
right now. That's why I don't want to really do much of this. So I just want to get through it

63
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:57,299
because this is the tutorial essential. This is a walkthrough. Yes, it's not. By the way,

64
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:02,899
some fun trivia for you. This is the first isometric 3D-esque game that Nintendo decided to

65
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:09,580
release. This game did not do that well because it was released at the very end of the Super

66
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:15,259
Nintendo's life cycle, which as you know, most of the other consoles were already being released by

67
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:23,740
then. It is a cult classic status at this point and because it sucks. I'm not kidding. Actually

68
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:30,019
ban that person for at least 10 minutes. Like, I mean, that's, that's a 10 minute timeout. Like,

69
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:38,899
how dare you. Don't let Bowser bruise you, Mario. Mario, prepare your chef for a great beyond.

70
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:48,340
It's a block. Every time I grab my head, that means that I did it.

71
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:56,389
You want to see what a non-timed hit looks like. See, you can take zero damage in this game.

72
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:01,830
Mario, the chain. Aim for the chain. See, if this is the first time playing, you'd be like, wait,

73
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:07,350
what? Oh, what the fuck? I can aim for the chain. And you'd go, what? Oh, no, I know. I'm like,

74
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:19,740
brain is pro. Hit the chain. Drop Bowser. Sounds like a plan. 15 damage. You guys want to see what

75
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,279
a non-timed hit looks like? Because I, Toads are going to come out and explain all of this

76
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,240
and about it. Yeah, I'm giving you spoilers. I don't want to like be the person that says,

77
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,360
we're going to watch the movie and then I'm going to tell you everything that happens in the movie.

78
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,830
Toads in this game. That's all you need to know. Mario, the chain. I am aiming for the chain.

79
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:52,779
That's what I'm doing. Boom. What was that sound? No. It's a chain reaction. Hang on,

80
00:12:52,779 --> 00:13:17,590
Pink Link. Coming, Mario. Fight, Mario. Fight. Fight. This should finish you. I can't do it.

81
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,870
I was going to do the, you know what I'm talking about, the, when he, you know what I mean.

82
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:29,899
Ah, did you think I was just going to give it to you? You're always in my way. This is it.

83
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:48,580
I'm going to take you out, Mario. Foiled again. Shit. Oh, Mario. You had me so worried. Let's get

84
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:58,710
out of here. Now what the heck's happening here? You're probably saying, wait, well, this is not,

85
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,269
this is Mario beats Bowser. Princess Peach, they don't go back. They had, they, they,

86
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:10,629
and that's it. But who the fuck is this guy? That's somebody I've never seen before.

87
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:29,220
Ooh, we're in the castle, didn't we? Super Mario RPG. You're feeling sleepy. Very sleepy.

88
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:36,259
And there go the stars that were broken from the sword. And here's the overworld map. We get

89
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:42,090
launched over here. What happened here? The sword went right into Mario's head.

90
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:56,149
Don't narrate this anymore. I can't, I'm sorry. I know I really am. Like, the sword drops down,

91
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:01,429
and what happens here? We got a rob. I'm like the fucking audio book. All right. All right.

92
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:10,679
I'm good. Hey, Mario. Lots of people use something called a door to go in and out of their houses.

93
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:22,940
Anyway, I came by to pick up Toad School since she's a bit late. Quiet, Archer. Thanks in 10

94
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:32,019
community subs. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You can jump on the bed. Go turn the

95
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:44,500
light on. Watch is ready. Good night. All right. What else can we do here? Lots of stuff.

96
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:53,059
Here we go. First save point of the game. The save points scattered around.

97
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:14,919
Fucking Ralph. Oh, no. Ralph save. Actually, I feel bad about Ralph save.

98
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:22,070
Ralph's not even, I don't think a real person. Hey, I thought the princess was here with you,

99
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,470
Mario. Where is she? I hate this. I hate this. Nobody can do Toad unless you do that.

100
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:35,289
Toad is just Marge, but a little higher pitched. Mario, what's with the silent treatment? No,

101
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:41,289
I'm not going to do that. You're not telling me something. It's Bowser again, isn't it? Oh,

102
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:45,129
no. Here we go again. Mario, would you please bring it back like you always do?

103
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:58,779
It's worse. It's not worse. It's better. Let's go up to Bowser's key. Mike Tyson.

104
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:17,799
Who goes there? A trespasser. This castle now belongs to us, the Smithy Gang. It's our first

105
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:23,400
step towards taking over this world. And if it weren't for nosy characters like you,

106
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:30,039
we'd practically own this world. So let's see you deal with this.

107
00:17:43,769 --> 00:18:05,380
Took out the bridge. So we, I mean, what do we do now? Why does this guy sound exactly like

108
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:19,609
a Jerma character? Because I'm sitting here doing that. All right, let's go. I'm excited. I love

109
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:27,210
this game. All right, Jay Leno, Mike Tyson, or Toad? Which one do you want me to do? Pick one.

110
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:39,769
I'm seeing a lot of Leno. Okay. You're back so soon. Did you forget something? No? What happened

111
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:51,579
up there? The bridge to Bowser's key was out now. It's just wonderful. I don't know what we must

112
00:18:51,579 --> 00:19:00,380
bring out from the Chancellor of Mushroom Kingdom at once. Let's go, Mario. From the Chancellor of

113
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:13,140
what's going on. Where do we go? Oh, excuse me. Oh, that bump on your head reduced your HP level.

114
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:22,119
One of Mushroom Kingdom's famous items out of pink. The mic. Received a mushroom. Do you know

115
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:28,039
how to use items? Of course I do, Toad. Oh, I see. You're just so well traveled and experienced,

116
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:39,819
Mario. Now, why did I rush back? I had something to tell you. Oh, I remember. I came to warn you

117
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:45,500
that mushroom was swarming with monsters. I just barely made it back here in one piece.

118
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:52,309
This is Meowth. You're right. Mario, please do something. Perhaps I can help. Do you know

119
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:59,609
about Time Tits? Yes. Hey, you better watch out. He knows about Time Tits. He's going to punch

120
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:09,190
your lights out. He's got more black than white, huh? Why did I rush back? I had something to tell

121
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:15,130
you. Oh, that's right. We need to tell the Chancellor about Toadstool. I'll see you over

122
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,690
at Mushroom Kingdom. Have you seen this? Have you heard about it? Just in case, take these with you.

123
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:36,170
Three mushrooms. The Chancellor. I'm so glad Germa isn't an actor.

124
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:45,349
You know, you don't get me. What? I've played this game 500 times. I'm just having some fun

125
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:58,630
with the voices. All right. You want me to really give you acting? Fine. On the next dialogue,

126
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,349
you'll see what a real actor looks like. But first of all, we want to do this because this

127
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:16,710
is the best song in the game. The battle music is the best. The mushrooms heal you, as you probably

128
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:22,099
I blocked that. It was too much damage. What?

129
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:32,539
You get random events like that. HP max. That's good. The boss music's about. Yeah, the boss

130
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:41,930
music is very good as well. Yeah, this is also back when Mario punched hard with both hands.

131
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,180
Now he kicks and flips, right? This experience. I don't really need this right now, but let's

132
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:58,440
go ahead and get the coins because the coins are currency. You use these to buy stuff at the shops

133
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:15,700
and upgrade weapons. And let's, you know, let's save toad. Yeah. Toad gives you useful stuff as

134
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:21,029
you go through. To exp. Now I have to figure out how I want to do this. All right.

135
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:28,710
My life was flashing before my eyes for a second there. Here's a little something.

136
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:49,140
Thanks. I appreciate it. Oh, this is fine. Cause the experience you level up. That's not a toad

137
00:22:49,140 --> 00:23:02,619
voice. Don't worry. I'm just getting warmed up. Now there are hidden blocks in the game, as you

138
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:13,450
probably could have guessed. What are my first impressions of the game? Um, I don't know. Not

139
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,890
that good. I mean, it's like, what is, I don't understand. It's an RPG, like turn-based. I fight

140
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:25,849
two. This is not even hard. I fight two things at once. That's it. Um, like, okay. That's not hard.

141
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:39,859
I only like hard games. No, I'm sorry. I don't like this. I only like hard games. Let's save toad.

142
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:54,630
Okay. So this is me too. I only like hard games too. Now the game actually does get,

143
00:23:55,509 --> 00:24:03,480
the game does get a little challenging just in regards to some facets of the game,

144
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,740
facets of the game. How do you say that? Boy, that was a close call. Here's a token of my appreciation.

145
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,420
Flower tap. So if you wanna know what a flower tap does, this is the interesting part.

146
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:25,160
Flower is mana. So when you have, you can get flower tabs, flower boxes, flower jars,

147
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:35,420
and they increase your maximum mana by one. Neat, huh? That's pretty cool. Syrup is a mana potion.

148
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:45,819
Think of mushrooms as health potions. Check for secrets, you know? There could be secrets

149
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:53,900
anywhere. The one thing that I never ever actually did in this game, and never really explored,

150
00:24:53,900 --> 00:25:00,789
even though I've played this game a thousand times, is the frog coins. I never did anything

151
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:06,309
with them, and I never cared to. All right, there is a toad that's been beaten up. Oops.

152
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:15,900
They're mostly useless. Oh shit, I shouldn't have read that. I just took a lot of damage.

153
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:21,339
Yeah, that's my understanding from that as well, because frog coins are just very novelty things,

154
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,500
weird accessories that you can get.

155
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:42,339
There is a permanently missable frog coin where you have to jump off a toad's head who starts

156
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:59,400
walking during a cutscene. Really? See, that's the kind of shit I love. That's coming up really soon,

157
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:08,759
actually. Is it? Uh oh, I'm gonna miss it. I'm gonna get healed too. Three hour stream of

158
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:17,299
Germa fighting Kulex. No, actually. I will beat Kulex first try. I hate to say it, I'm sorry to

159
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:29,339
say it, but now when I fight Kulex is another story, you know. Where's Toad? I know you're over

160
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:42,599
here somewhere. Where's Toad? Isn't he hidden over here? Oh, there he is. All right. Oh, that's scary.

161
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:55,269
Uh oh. Really gotta pad out this playthrough. This is the first mini boss in the game. All right,

162
00:26:55,269 --> 00:27:04,299
gotta get a good voice. Hey, are you looking at me? My hammer and I don't like you. Mario,

163
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:16,259
you better be careful. He's definitely got a mean streak. Now you got my hammer angry. You

164
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:24,549
shouldn't have done that. And there's two. The Hammer Brothers. So we're gonna do something fun.

165
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:42,950
We're gonna... 33 damage. We're gonna use it over and over again just to get rid of this one gone.

166
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:50,009
See you later. I do have to be careful because Valor up now means that they're... they take more

167
00:27:50,009 --> 00:28:03,240
damage and they dish it out too. All right, six. I can do this two more times. See? Kulex first

168
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:10,680
try live. Uh oh, this is actually important. I didn't get it. Oh fuck, I'm gonna die.

169
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:24,470
Die. I'm gonna die in my like 11th playthrough. Uh oh. I can just do it with my hand.

170
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:39,299
I don't want to use the honey syrup. Okay, I gotta get this right. Now, there it is. Okay, so I'm block...

171
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:46,180
when you block shit, you... you might not get it right. They're weirdly timed. That whole animation

172
00:28:46,180 --> 00:29:01,819
has to go by first before you block. Uh, I think... yeah, I'm gonna do it again. I really want to just

173
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:05,339
jump on him, but is it really worth me taking a honey syrup? He's probably... he's got like five

174
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:22,490
health left. How did you know? I just do. Why is it that whenever I play bad games, you're here,

175
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:30,950
but whenever I play good games, you're not here? Well, which one is this? I don't... I don't know

176
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:45,619
which one is this. Got a flower jar though, and we leveled up. Max HP 25, 23, 2.

177
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:54,460
It's magic attacking, magic defense. Level this up correctly or I'm gonna unfollow. See, when I was

178
00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:03,660
younger, I did a thing and I kind of just continue to do it. Uh, I pick one option

179
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:11,980
and I do it every single time with each playable character. So I would just have, like for instance,

180
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:20,789
Mario would have hundreds of HP. And I don't... I never really changed that up.

181
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:29,539
Because there's three people in your party, so I figured, all right, one of them is going to be

182
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:41,460
good at everything. Uh, I want health. I do. Actually, maybe... hmmm... I gotta plan... I gotta

183
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:49,380
think about this. I'm gonna do health. Power. Power. No, I'm gonna do health. Caring about HP.

184
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:56,819
Yeah, you have to care about HP in this game. Otherwise, people die. You'll die. Let us pick.

185
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:06,700
I'm not... I gotta let you guys ruin my childhood again. Fine. I'll let you guys ruin my childhood

186
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:15,109
again. You guys are really onto this recently, ruining my childhood every day. I mean, I mean,

187
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:18,390
every day. I don't mean every... I mean like just today. I don't know why I said every day.

188
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:26,500
Okay. Uh, sure. Why not? Here we go. You guys can pick. Don't fuck this up, though, because like

189
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:37,049
you literally will ruin this whole game. What do you want me to do? Like really don't fuck this up.

190
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:59,990
Okay. All right, we're doing power. Uh, thank you for choosing the thing I'm gonna pick for Mario

191
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:11,779
every time. By the way, forgot to mention that's what this was. Why can I get this off the screen?

192
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:21,339
Get off the screen. Why can I not take... There we go. All right. Power. Attack went up from

193
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:27,660
33 to 24. Defense 2 to 3. Now this is physical attack power. So if somebody casts a magic spell,

194
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,259
this is not gonna do shit. I hope you guys understand what you've just done.

195
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:40,180
All right. Thanks, Mario. I was running so fast. I wasn't watching where I was going.

196
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:47,579
Whoa. Mushroom Kingdom's just ahead. We're almost there, Mario. Hey, where did this hammer come from?

197
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:59,339
Hmm. Hey, do you know what this is? It's the hammer, brothers. It's significant. No one stands a

198
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:07,269
chance against you when you whop them with this. You never know. It might come in handy.

199
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,940
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. Let's get a move on. I'll see you in Mushroom Kingdom.

200
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:25,990
You can probably guess that, uh, that is a weapon. Attack power goes to 34.

201
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:48,920
Now the game begins. Mushroom Kingdom. I thought this was for crafting? No. Here's the Mushroom

202
00:33:48,920 --> 00:34:05,079
Kingdom. Hey, Mario. Look what you're standing in. Gotcha. It made me jump. Just a fan. The star

203
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:10,579
means it's an in and a save point. And the mushroom means it's a shop and potentially...

204
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:20,300
Yeah, gotcha. Good. Items and weapons and all that good stuff. Mario, what a pleasant surprise.

205
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:27,110
One of Frog Fuchs' grandchildren is running errands in town today. I haven't seen him, though. Oh,

206
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:36,139
you're here to shop. What are you looking for? Here we go. See, shirt, pants, shoes. Uh, jump

207
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:40,539
shoe. It'll use jump attacks against any foe. This is really good. Antidote pin prevents poison.

208
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:52,619
But I need... you gotta get... you gotta get armor first. Get pants. Mario's not wearing pants. Uh,

209
00:34:52,619 --> 00:35:01,320
shirt and pants. And I also did this when I played this game all the time. I am gonna get

210
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,900
a lot of shit for this. I already know it. There's gonna be a lot of RPG min-maxers that are gonna be

211
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:15,699
what the fuck is wrong with this guy. Um, I max out my inventory with revives. Every time. I have,

212
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:23,880
like, 20 pick me ups. Because I'm terrible at video games. So I just have a ton of

213
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:30,219
heals and pick me ups. And I'm probably gonna get made fun of. But I'm already accepting that.

214
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:40,869
It's not optimal at all. I know. But for right now, this is fine. I don't have enough for the

215
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:48,500
jump shoes. Let's equip. Uh, somebody just gave a lot of money. Defense and magic defense. And

216
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:56,230
pants. They're not for me. They're for somebody else. Uh, phylactery. Let's just give 100 bucks.

217
00:35:56,869 --> 00:36:10,710
Thank you. For the 100 dollars and 11 cents. They say,

218
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,710
I will give you 500 dollars to play Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door on stream.

219
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:22,309
Well, uh, I'm sa- I'm sorry to say I will never get that money. I'm never gonna receive that money.

220
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:27,000
And I'm not gonna do that. I appreciate it, though. Thank you so much for the 100 bucks.

221
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:38,500
Oh, this is tha- oh yeah, this is the person that's playing on the Game Boy. Wait, this is important

222
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:44,860
stuff. But no, phylactery, let's say that, like, you're up, you have to be up to over five, six,

223
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:54,280
seven, eight hundred dollars. No, thank you. Here we go, ready? Don't talk to me now! Nothing up

224
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:05,289
there? He's only the last level of the game or something. And all the inns, people are just

225
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:13,590
sleeping. It's not like I'm always sleeping. Yes, it is. You're always sleeping up here.

226
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:19,510
Don't talk to him, he's gaming. Paper Mario is better than this. Well, that's the thing about

227
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:27,260
video game opinions. I get to have one and so do you. I happen to think this is the best game

228
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:33,099
that Nintendo's probably ever made. And if you like it, then that's- if you like the other one

229
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:46,599
better, I'm glad you do. But you're wrong. It's so nice to see our young ones having a good time,

230
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:56,730
but you're not that old. I always look for boxes. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Oh, look, here's like the-

231
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,889
the- look, the wicked, like, caffeine person.

232
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:24,139
All right, let's go. Hey, did you see a crocodile around here? He talks like a

233
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:28,940
mobster wannabe. I'm sure he's up to no good. Hey, wait a second, my wallet's gone.

234
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:36,380
Now, shit, I'm sorry about your wallet. All right, let's continue. I think there's-

235
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:43,539
anything else to see in here? Oh, yeah, that's right. This kid.

236
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:13,369
I love that. There's the sprite going up and down.

237
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:24,219
Look, I'll help you. In fact, you might be better than me, kid. Keep at it.

238
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:38,969
All right, let's go talk to the chancellor. Do all toads, like, talk- like, toad? Or is

239
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:55,260
there some toads that talk like this? Wait, no! Is this the part? Is this the part you're talking

240
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,019
about? This is the part you're talking about? This is the part you're talking about. Fuck, I- I ruined

241
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:08,300
that. That's the part you're talking about, isn't it? I missed the coin. In all my years,

242
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,619
I've never done that. I missed it. It's over. I might as well just delete this game and- and

243
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:26,760
stop streaming. But what about this toad? This is a toad, right? That- that- this is a toad.

244
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:37,130
So would he also talk like this? Or does he have a lower voice?

245
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:55,510
Oh, excuse me. Where- where is the princess? She departed for your house hours ago.

246
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:19,610
I feel the worst. Could Bowser somehow be behind all of this? Spore's alive. You're telling us that

247
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:26,519
Bowser has abducted the princess again. Never mind. It will be up to you to enter the keep

248
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:37,699
and rescue Princess Toadstool. No, you're not getting this. Yeah, guys, this is back before

249
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:50,440
Mario talked. This is my favorite part. Not yet.

250
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:21,260
Got a map.

251
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,860
Go to the cellar and prepare for your journey. The vault guard shall assist you.

252
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:49,530
Where is it? Come on, it's over here somewhere. So this is up- I believe this is going to- this

253
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:57,780
is the princess's room? Yeah. The princess hasn't returned yet. Can you imagine how the chancellor

254
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:21,940
must feel? I'm just checking for stuff. Found Toadstool's- Hey, what are you doing? I'll give

255
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:51,059
you this in exchange. Just leave everything where it was. What? Okay. Mario, the chancellor has filled

256
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:56,980
me in. Come, let me show you around. This is gonna get fucking tiring. Help yourself to the

257
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:04,820
treasures. This mushroom will restore your hit points and flower points. Unfortunately,

258
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:14,710
mushrooms you find as items only restore your HP. So beware. This is a flower. The more gathering

259
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:23,110
you do, the more flower points you'll have in battle. Find them. This is a coin. The small

260
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:31,300
ones are worth one and the large ones are worth 10. This one's a 10. Do you know about flower

261
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:39,340
points? Yes. You sure are smart, Mario. All right, now walk that way so I can get the secret.

262
00:44:48,659 --> 00:45:18,090
All right, let's go. Hmm, I gotta think of- I gotta think of one. I'm back here. Oh, get back here.

263
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:38,420
Oh no, that reptile stole my grandfather's coin. I can't cry. Big boys don't cry,

264
00:45:38,420 --> 00:46:02,420
but it's just not fair. I gotta do. Good luck, kid. Yes, gee, you're soaking wet, aren't you?

265
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:11,690
I'm all right now, sorry. There's nothing like a good cry. But why was I crying? There was some

266
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:18,730
reason. My grandpa asked me to buy some things for him here. When I walked into town that croc

267
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:24,630
stopped me. Oh yeah, he took it from me. He stole my coin. I chased him, but he was too fast.

268
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:33,099
Hey Mario, let's see how you're going to take on Bowser. Wow, he doesn't stand a chance.

269
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:40,780
Wait, you're the Mario? I know all about you. You've got more jump in you than a box of frogs.

270
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:47,340
I'm Mallow from Tadpole Pond. I'm a frog, but can you believe it? I can't jump. It's embarrassing.

271
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:50,460
How about it, Mario? Will you help me catch that filthy thief?

272
00:46:52,409 --> 00:47:00,409
Yeah. The young frog Mallow, who doesn't look at all like a frog, joins Mario in his quest.

273
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:20,710
New party member. And I planned ahead. Put on those pants, Mallow. What do I have for items?

274
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:33,900
I do a flower jar. Let's use it. I need a couple of mushrooms, I think. First, let's save it.

275
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:56,230
Wasted the flower jar? I did not. All right, let's do uh... Hey, Mallow, what kept you? I was starting

276
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:03,690
to worry. Wait until you hear this. You see... Wait, I've already heard. Old Frog Fuchs has told me.

277
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:09,610
He seems to know everything. Hold on. No, listen to me. The truth of the matter is, well, um,

278
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:16,570
the coin was stolen. What? Well, if that's the case, I guess we can't trade. That's a shame.

279
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:24,179
Oh, but there's no need to worry. Mario here is going to help us. Is that so? Well, if Mario's

280
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:30,489
on your team, you'll have that coin back in a jiffy. Not so fast. Take this with you. You'll

281
00:48:30,489 --> 00:48:41,239
probably need it. Pick me up. Uh, but I need to buy a couple more. I love this job. What are you

282
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:51,590
looking for? I'm looking for like a couple of these. Want to do these? One more of these.

283
00:48:53,079 --> 00:49:07,800
Inefficient, but it's one more of those. Okay. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Get off

284
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:28,969
there this minute. I order you to stand before me. I now order you to jump. In this world,

285
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:34,300
there are things called hidden treasures. Use your awesome jumping ability to look for them.

286
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:52,090
And he's got one sitting right here somewhere, don't he? Okay, bye. All right. So we have to

287
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:59,530
try to... We have to go to Toad. Mario, I have something to report, sir. I saw him. He's here

288
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:05,349
somewhere. He just zoomed past me a second ago. Did you see him? Did he look something like this?

289
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:15,210
Why, yes, exactly. He's the one who took my coin. Why didn't you stop him? Because I forgot my

290
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:25,980
bazooka at home. Sheesh, give me a break here. Get back here. You smugs will never catch me.

291
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:44,940
A snail can outrun you morons. Later. That's him. Hurry, Mario. Let's get him. Got anything for me?

292
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:59,659
No. You're too slow. You're too slow. Bandits way. Let's go. Hmm. There he is. He probably

293
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:04,920
stashed it in that bag. Let's nab him. Are you trying to tell me? Go on, hold on before you get

294
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:35,699
hurt, kid. He does a very high speed. He can one hit. One hit. Thunderbolt now. Use Mallow's

295
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:55,980
stretchy arms. I love the hammer sound. It sounds so great. You missed me. Now this is a frog.

296
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:12,809
I mean, it's like a human frog. This game has battles and not just wacky dialogue.

297
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:17,369
Um, no. There's lots of wacky dialogue and there are lots of battles.

298
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:36,900
Oh, I forgot. This game doesn't just have wacky dialogue. I'm just checking. You couldn't jump to

299
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:53,610
save your life, kid. So I guess this is goodbye. And he stole one of the coins. Oh, fuck. All right,

300
00:52:53,610 --> 00:53:02,199
here we go. Is this when I... Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Where do you... Sometimes you get stars.

301
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:12,650
I know there's something around here, isn't there? What about over here? Oh, there has to be.

302
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:20,679
Right? If you find a star in this game, you're guaranteed to level up like at least once or

303
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:34,860
twice, at least. That is... Okay, it is the next room. You're right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

304
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:55,449
Oh, you're a persistent bugger, but I'm a hundred miles ahead of you. He is pretty fast. Any chests

305
00:53:55,449 --> 00:54:14,969
or anything? He is fast. I feel like you lied when you played this game five hundred times.

306
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:23,500
No, I played it like once every three or four years. No, sorry. I don't go to sleep at night

307
00:54:23,500 --> 00:55:04,039
saying all of Krakos' lines out loud. Why don't you? Wait. Stupid. There he goes. It's not worth it.

308
00:55:06,489 --> 00:55:10,090
It's not even a thing you should be looking... Give up already. That treasure box is tempting,

309
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:15,559
but now is not the time. Oh, it is absolutely worth it. It's definitely worth it because we're

310
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:23,880
going to level up like three times. This all counts as a full battle, by the way.

311
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:39,929
There it is. Bingo. Mallow has reached level three. His HP has gone up by four. His defense

312
00:55:39,929 --> 00:55:51,769
is terrible. His magic attack is... Mallow, I believe, has the best magic in the game.

313
00:55:51,769 --> 00:55:59,860
I think Peach has... Oh, spoilers. Fuck. HP rain. All right. What do you guys think? Where should I go?

314
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:30,489
All right. Special. Magic attack. Magic defense. I can't click down there. All right. We're doing

315
00:56:30,489 --> 00:56:40,300
magic. Thank you for voting. So this brings us to 18 attack, 13. One point at each one.

316
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:46,710
That's probably what I would have done too. Although, make sure you guys give Mallow some

317
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:58,039
HP because he is very, very, very weak. Very weak. Like, super replaceable weak. I mean, no.

318
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:08,440
You guys do not want me to use him. Okay. That's why you bring all the pick me ups.

319
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,539
I got another flower tab. All right. I think there's something else I can do over here.

320
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:25,579
Winter Squash. Just gave $50. Thank you, Winter Squash. 5,000 bits. And they say,

321
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:32,380
Jeremy, the other day I spilled pasta sauce on my keyboard and I ruined it. At first I was annoyed,

322
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:38,619
but then I remembered the time you spilled PBR all over your keyboard live on stream and I

323
00:57:38,619 --> 00:57:44,949
immediately felt better about myself. Keep up the good work, streamer. I don't drink PBR. I've never

324
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:49,269
spilled PBR anywhere. That would imply that I had to have purchased it.

325
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:11,530
Yes, that was not a PBR though. I think there's no, I'm good. Let's go. Dead end. And they won't

326
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:18,630
give up. I'll just have to hide. This is where he starts adding mileage every time you go and find

327
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:26,679
him. He's gone into hiding. Let's see if we can sneak up behind him and catch him. Full health.

328
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,059
And hey, what's up? What's this you fools couldn't chase down a pumpkin?

329
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:46,869
Found you. Your eyes are much faster than your feet. At this rate it'll take you a hundred more

330
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:56,699
years to catch me. Your eyes are faster than your feet. At this rate it'll take you 50 more

331
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:10,019
years to catch me. This is getting old. It'll still take you enough. You got me fair and square.

332
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:16,659
I'll give you back your coin. Did you really believe me? I was lying.

333
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:50,699
Boss time. Eight. Oh, he hurts. By the way, there are timed hits also on special attacks. Oh, fuck.

334
00:59:52,139 --> 01:00:03,300
Oh, I missed that one. I don't tell you, Mallow, Mallow is weak. Very weak. I might even have to

335
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:10,809
take a mushroom. Oh my god, that picked me up. Oh boy. He's good. All right, now I actually have

336
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:24,550
to heal him. No, Mario does the damage. Heal yourself. Got a freebie. That means at the end

337
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:29,030
of the game, or end of the round here, we get something cool. I'm gonna, Mario's gonna heal now.

338
01:00:30,469 --> 01:00:33,429
Uh, if I go for damage, I'm just gonna go straight up and jump on him.

339
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:48,820
And then Mallow's gonna heal him. He means he didn't use the item. I was just testing him.

340
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:58,139
He's almost dead. Shit. Yeah, Mallow, Mallow is kind of just straight up support. All right,

341
01:00:58,139 --> 01:01:09,880
I'm gonna have to use the honey. This is a real game for real gamers? I mean, yeah, it is. Did I

342
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:21,449
get it? Fuck. I didn't get it again. Shit. I think you have to wait another second after the bomb

343
01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:33,780
blows up. All right, I'm out of uh, mana. I think he's close. All right, let's go with honey syrup.

344
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:51,139
Do a raptor noise? No, I'm not gonna do a raptor. When do I get psychopath? Psychopath is incredibly

345
01:01:51,139 --> 01:02:10,250
helpful. Do it. Do it. Do it. All right, weird mushroom. You think it's healed? You know, fuck it.

346
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:19,420
I'll show you this. I'll show you this. This is cool. See if I can get it. Got it. When you hit that

347
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:34,380
second strike, that's the time tip. I think you can do this too. Let's see. When it flies over.

348
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:43,539
Yeah, there it is. It's right at the very end when the cloud starts to close. Fuck. Seriously?

349
01:02:44,099 --> 01:03:04,199
God damn it. Yeah, that was a oof moment. You're right. Take the honey syrup. Finally. All right.

350
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:25,429
Still going. Why do you have so much health? Get out of here. How much health do you have?

351
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:49,860
I only, okay, I only have two anyways. There it is.

352
01:04:06,139 --> 01:04:19,860
Yes, amigos. All right. We got it back. ADXP. 10 coins. Flower tab. And a Mario level up.

353
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:28,489
25 to 30. That's a big jump for attack and defense. That's a milestone of a level.

354
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:49,349
And I learned fire orb. Yes, I did. Don't mess it up. Malo has more defense than Mario.

355
01:04:57,449 --> 01:05:07,159
Little dancing flowers. All right, we'll go with power. Sounds good to me. That is what I,

356
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:17,900
I would have picked power as well. We did it. We got grandpa's coin back. I can finish my errand

357
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:25,449
now. Hey, look at this. That croco guy left a wallet. I'm going back to the shop at Mushroom

358
01:05:25,449 --> 01:05:38,099
Kingdom. Are you coming? There's the fast travel shortcut out. Got a wallet too. Okay. So that is

359
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:58,230
that part. And got a wallet. Let's actually, let's, yeah, I'm all right with this. Let's test this out.

360
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:20,659
42. That's pretty good. Time to grind. No, there actually is a spot in the, close to the end game

361
01:06:21,619 --> 01:06:26,739
that is an insane grinding spot. You kill this same little blue thing and it has the most

362
01:06:26,739 --> 01:06:36,730
experience pound for pound. It takes one hit for the thing to die. It's pretty much cheating. All

363
01:06:36,730 --> 01:07:03,510
right. Back to Mushroom Kingdom where there's something wrong here. Something going on. It

364
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:11,030
looks normal to me. Shit. All right. The fireballs always got me. They always did. I never block

365
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:17,670
fireballs. It's after, or is it before or is it like second after? I forget. The fireballs get me

366
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:28,389
every time. Use Thunderbolt? Not yet. Thunderbolt is, yes, it is incredible against these enemies,

367
01:07:28,389 --> 01:07:39,929
but not unless there's more than two. It's a waste of flower power. My opinion. The magic can't be

368
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:46,150
blocked. I always thought some of it could though. Like you can block the slimes that come out of

369
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:51,110
people. The little like globs that like, yeah, you have to, the stars don't come out of you.

370
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:57,559
Then yeah, that's true. Thanks Mario. I'll continue to stand watch, but now everyone seems suspicious.

371
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:11,289
By the way, look what I got. 10 coins. Please leave the correct amount of money for items.

372
01:08:11,289 --> 01:08:21,449
Manager. All right. I need, I need, how many of these do I have? 10 coins for one of, how many?

373
01:08:21,449 --> 01:08:34,100
Two? I already got pants. How many do I have? Four? I need like at least five or six of these.

374
01:08:36,869 --> 01:08:43,000
I'm gonna probably, I'm gonna get like seven, eight. Let's get another two. I'm gonna need them

375
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:57,289
and then another one of these. Two more of these. Okay. How am I doing? Looks like a pretty standard,

376
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:05,609
um, pretty standard inventory. I got the, what? So worth $123. Yeah, that's true. Okay. Sell the

377
01:09:05,609 --> 01:09:12,810
wallet. How is this selling a wallet? Aren't I just taking the cash out and handing it to the person?

378
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,720
Yeah, I got bad news for those of you that want me to return this wallet.

379
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:35,289
Turns out it ain't worth it. That's, I could get everything. Okay, fine. I'll be a good person.

380
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,520
We got, uh, Malice doesn't have a weapon. I don't think Mal gets a weapon for a while.

381
01:09:45,619 --> 01:09:52,420
Excuse me? You want to, what? How can you shop at a time like this? Just take what you want and leave

382
01:09:52,420 --> 01:10:21,880
some money. I wish you luck. All right, let's go save everybody. Level up a little. He's too scared

383
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:46,939
to stop you from jumping on his furniture. Now, do it. Two damage. I thought it was 20. Ow. Jump

384
01:10:46,939 --> 01:10:51,020
on the furniture. No, I'm not going to, why would I do that? You guys, okay. Return the wallet is

385
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:55,819
something that is, all right, come on, you can do more than two fucking damage. Return the wallet is

386
01:10:55,819 --> 01:11:01,100
a big deal to you guys, but jump on the scared guy's fucking nice furniture in his house is okay.

387
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:09,319
You understand how I'm having trouble with this with you guys? That was too darn close. Thanks for

388
01:11:09,319 --> 01:11:14,520
the land, Mario. Hey, that's the wallet that the crocodile swiped for me. Can I have that wallet

389
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:41,140
back? No way. Thank you so much. Here, I'll give you this as a reward. Go on, take it at 123 points.

390
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:54,569
But I had to do the right thing. Everyone's safe in here. It's testing. So nice to see our young

391
01:11:54,569 --> 01:12:02,470
ones having a good time. It's scary outside, so let's play indoors, okay? But I want to play

392
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:31,590
outside. It's too dangerous. Yeah, she's like, oh wow. Look, I can go higher. Here, go fish.

393
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:45,060
Yeah, she thinks it's cool because they're jumping. She's a huge fan of jumping.

394
01:12:46,420 --> 01:13:08,859
When is a German jumping stream going to happen? You saw it yesterday.

395
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:18,840
Oh, the Kinect streams are German jumping streams. Hey Mario, look what you're standing in.

396
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:39,380
Gotcha. Still running the business. Still playing your game. Was the princess kidnapped by those

397
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:55,899
things outside? Are they a part of this? Oh, shut up. See, I'm wide awake. Now I guess it's time for

398
01:13:55,899 --> 01:14:22,739
me to win big cash. There's a casino in this game. Bet you didn't know that. Yeah, he's just bouncing

399
01:14:22,739 --> 01:14:31,369
on the door. Stop that. Trying to get at least one more level up for Mario. It's pretty important

400
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:46,060
because Malo is almost 100% useless right here. In a moment, Malo will be very, very useful.

401
01:14:51,699 --> 01:14:57,449
Say that to his face. I'm standing behind them, but I'm talking pretty loudly. They can both hear me.

402
01:15:05,449 --> 01:15:12,979
In fact, they turn around and look at me all the time to ask me what they should be doing.

403
01:15:17,829 --> 01:15:22,149
Yeah, she's right. I guess we can put it off until things cool down around here.

404
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:26,300
I found the perfect place for a wedding, but now we're all stuck inside.

405
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:38,600
Everybody's stuck. Now we can leave. Town is being attacked.

406
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:47,340
There are things in our kitchen. Help. Look, scary things. Get rid of them.

407
01:15:50,840 --> 01:16:18,949
Hope my little brother's okay. I'll handle this. It's too scary. There's two scary people here.

408
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:36,010
There's two in this room and I feel a level up coming soon. Probably Malo.

409
01:16:39,289 --> 01:16:50,359
No, I was wrong. Am I gonna beat this whole game on stream? Um, I don't, I don't know.

410
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:59,479
Probably. Maybe not all today. It depends. I don't think I'll be able to do it in one sitting.

411
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:12,140
This game is like a, this is like a 18-hour game. This game takes about 20 hours to go through.

412
01:17:12,779 --> 01:17:29,640
So I don't think that'll be a one and done stream. Malo. Nope. Thanks Mario.

413
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:43,859
But what about my son upstairs? Oops. I forgot all about him. I'm scared.

414
01:17:50,170 --> 01:18:10,649
Boing, boing, boing. Now this guy can jump. Now Malo's gonna die. You're killing his friend.

415
01:18:16,789 --> 01:18:33,579
What are you, why are you doing this? You're bashing his friend's head. Stop this. They were

416
01:18:33,579 --> 01:18:41,239
just playing Mario together. Oh no, this is dangerous. They're monsters. They're trying

417
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:49,590
to get, they're trying to kill us. Really? Thank you so much for everything. Here's a little token

418
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:56,869
of my appreciation. Got a flower tab. You're gonna grow up to be just like Mario. You hear?

419
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:14,409
Am I? Yes. I can still jump the highest. I love this little kid. I love this little kid.

420
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:24,949
Oh, that's, I love that little kid. He's so cute. Okay, let's go. Faster. Go faster.

421
01:19:25,829 --> 01:19:29,590
No, the poor kid's gonna throw up if you keep telling him to go faster.

422
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:38,840
All right, what do I get for health? It's not, not very good. Let's change that.

423
01:19:42,229 --> 01:19:52,069
What do I have for, uh, flower points? 18. How many tabs do I have? I got a lot of tabs. I mean,

424
01:19:52,310 --> 01:20:06,949
technically, I'm not supposed to use these, but I'm gonna need them. When I say technically,

425
01:20:06,949 --> 01:20:14,180
you're not supposed to use them. If you use a flower tab, it fills up your flower mana

426
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:21,859
all the way. But you can only do it from the menu. So that's why it's not what you're thinking.

427
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:29,819
The flower tabs increase your max mana. Yeah. And they fill up your mana as well.

428
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:52,010
Here we go. Yes, there it is. All right, Malo is level four. A nice jump on the HP.

429
01:20:53,579 --> 01:21:15,140
28 HP. Yes, you decide. You do. Mario is hard carrying. Yeah, that's kind of how it is

430
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:20,300
for the first hour or two of the game. Sometimes even more. For the first like two or three hours

431
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:33,270
of the game, Mario is just hard carrying. All right, that's it. We're doing a magic attack and

432
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:46,949
magic defense. Again, I wonder if we get Mario too. Now that was really scary. Everyone's hiding in

433
01:21:46,949 --> 01:21:51,350
the princess's bedroom. I and some others couldn't escape in time. I hope no one got hurt.

434
01:21:56,489 --> 01:22:12,600
Uh oh. Toad's lagging out. Come on. Come on, cocks. God damn it. 700 ping Toad.

435
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:31,210
He's getting the G mod disconnect message. I don't even know what that is. Ooh, that magic

436
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:50,579
defense is really helping though. Three damage. Mario's taking 10. Oops. Malo better than Mario.

437
01:22:50,579 --> 01:22:57,500
Maybe eventually, but not right now. Use thunder? No, not until it's necessary,

438
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:06,300
because I'm going to waste all of my flower points before I really need them. And I'm gonna

439
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:15,449
really need them really soon. Saved by Mario again. How could I ever thank you? I love that.

440
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:18,569
He goes like this and puts his back against the wall and slowly goes upstairs.

441
01:23:19,529 --> 01:23:33,930
Trapped again. Not so fast, pal. Look at him. Can't even bounce. Hey, maybe we could bounce on his

442
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:49,350
head. I mean, I don't need a device to bounce though. I can jump higher than you and I don't

443
01:23:49,350 --> 01:24:03,460
need a device to do it. So if I had a device like yours, I wonder how high I could go. And then you

444
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:08,899
walk out of the room and that person just is floored and they have to rethink everything.

445
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:30,779
Come on, Mario. Saved by Mario again. How could I ever thank you enough? Toadstool's room. You're

446
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:39,100
in one piece. Thanks to Mario, of course. Saved by Mario again. How could I ever thank you? Oh no,

447
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:45,579
the Chancellor's still in the throne room. What? That's terrible. But with Mario around, we're

448
01:24:45,579 --> 01:24:57,609
safe, right? You bet. There we go. Now, hey, wait, hang on for a second. Please take this. The

449
01:24:57,609 --> 01:25:06,729
Princess will be happy to know you have something of hers. I love how sometimes Mario just does like

450
01:25:06,729 --> 01:25:13,689
the gym from the office. Like flower tab, right into the fucking camera. I'm like, geez, okay.

451
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:26,149
Saved everybody. I'm scared. You may not sleep in the Princess's bed. Have you no manners?

452
01:25:27,029 --> 01:25:39,699
All right, I am going to. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to, I'm taking the tabs. I don't

453
01:25:39,699 --> 01:25:48,069
care. I need them. What are you doing? Wait, dude, what the fuck? Idiot. What the fuck, dude? What's

454
01:25:48,069 --> 01:25:55,050
wrong? Are you serious? I'm changing streams. Like I, I, I'm going to a different stream. That was

455
01:25:55,050 --> 01:26:19,850
it for me. I did. I'm going to do that anyways. All right, relax. There we go. Now people are asking,

456
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:24,250
when are you going to do Thunderbolt? When there's at least three. Watch what we can do here.

457
01:26:29,939 --> 01:26:46,199
Check this out. Goodbye. And that's a Mario level up right there. 35 HP, 32 attack.

458
01:26:47,380 --> 01:27:08,069
Terrible defense. And I mean truly awful. Let's go. What do you think? What's the plot so far?

459
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:21,380
Bowser kidnaps Princess. Mario thwarts Bowser, saves Princess. Unfortunately,

460
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:27,699
giant sword crashes down from the sky at the very end and knocks everybody out and takes everybody

461
01:27:27,699 --> 01:27:32,229
out. Therefore, what the heck's going on with this giant sword that came out of the sky?

462
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:39,779
That is not a spoiler. You just watched that part. We're at the same movie theater

463
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:45,779
and we just watched the same scene. Let's say for instance, oh no, that's who did it.

464
01:27:45,779 --> 01:27:50,739
And it was, it was Gary. Whoa, just revealed on the screen and I go, holy shit, dude, it was Gary.

465
01:27:50,739 --> 01:27:54,500
And you look over at me in the, in the same fucking theater and you go, what the spoilers, dude,

466
01:27:54,500 --> 01:28:08,010
idiot. All right, we're going to do power. Thank you for voting. You got to get Mario some HP guys,

467
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:27,850
or some magic power. Mario needs like not, not all right. Well, no HP. There just ain't,

468
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:34,409
there ain't no point. Why would I get Mario's like arms tired for no reason?

469
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:45,909
Never hear of a glass cannon. The vault guard, I come here to save him and he runs into the next

470
01:28:45,909 --> 01:29:09,739
room. Oh, so much for him. Damn. More free shit. I'll take it. You're all right. Hey, it's safe.

471
01:29:09,739 --> 01:29:16,699
You're good. Nevermind that. Guess what I found. It's a gold coin, a gold coin and it's all mine.

472
01:29:18,069 --> 01:29:29,720
Oh, I found this in the cellar. You can have it. Wake up pin. Yeah. Prevents mute and sleep attacks.

473
01:29:30,439 --> 01:29:34,199
And it also gives you a little bit more defense. So I'm going to give this to Mario because,

474
01:29:35,239 --> 01:29:41,399
I mean, look, 1822 versus 1970. Like that's much more important. Keep Mario.

475
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:53,270
Mario is in need of it. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay. No one takes our treasure. That's true.

476
01:29:53,909 --> 01:30:02,579
All right, let's go. I think I'm ready. I'm going to save the game.

477
01:30:03,539 --> 01:30:21,399
I need Luigi. I'm going to make everybody really, really upset about this. And I'm going to say this

478
01:30:21,399 --> 01:30:28,899
and people are going to be very, very, very mad. Um, not maybe not mad, but, um, this is a spoiler.

479
01:30:28,899 --> 01:30:37,479
Should I say it? Yeah. Who cares? It's not a big deal. Um, link from the legend of Zelda

480
01:30:38,619 --> 01:31:00,180
is in this game more than Luigi. It's pretty, it's pretty bad. Where do you think everybody went?

481
01:31:00,899 --> 01:31:06,819
Well, gang looks like we have ourselves a new home. We can bounce around all day and there's

482
01:31:06,819 --> 01:31:21,529
no one here who can stand in our way. Let's bounce the night away. Hey, not so fast pal.

483
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:25,050
Look at him. Can't even bounce. Maybe we can bounce on his head.

484
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:42,979
Listen up gang. These guys are going to put a stop to our party. Are we happy about this?

485
01:31:44,489 --> 01:31:50,329
You're asking for it. Ooh, you're going to get it. You picked the wrong people to bounce with,

486
01:31:50,329 --> 01:32:07,979
bub. How about a fat lip to go with that ugly mustache? Here we go. Fire in the back.

487
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:47,020
Check this out. Mac is stunned. Don't worry, only four damage, not a big deal.

488
01:32:52,789 --> 01:33:12,090
Nope, save it. I always tap A. Six, four, yeah, you got enough. All right, we're still fine.

489
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:26,550
64, Nintendo 64. All right, I guess I have to take care of Mario here. Oh yeah, six.

490
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:36,680
I'm going to use mushroom on Mario.

491
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:48,710
And they're back. Also, I'm going to use, how much do I, what do I have for flower points? Three.

492
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:54,229
All right, I'm going to jump. No, I'm not. I'm just going to hit him. I'm just going to whack him and

493
01:33:54,229 --> 01:34:07,430
then I'm going to get on the boat again and it's gonna stun him and they can't do shit. Oops,

494
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:16,840
didn't work that time. I just got instant spawned. All right, so let me do the,

495
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:23,340
this is kind of bad actually. All right, honey syrup. We got, we both have pretty good health.

496
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:48,020
Do it again, quick. Can you stun him? Stun him would be nice. Do it again. Stun him.

497
01:34:48,819 --> 01:34:57,430
This is why I wanted to save all those. You're wondering why I wasn't using the honey syrup

498
01:34:57,430 --> 01:35:01,670
and why I wasn't doing thunderbolt because shit like this happens. You can, you can get destroyed.

499
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:27,479
He's done. Ain't gonna be much left after this. This motherfucker can't even attack me. Done.

500
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:48,739
That's it. See you later. Yeah, that boss is very easy. That boss is not easy at all if you don't

501
01:35:48,739 --> 01:36:05,399
understand that Malo has thunderbolt. If you don't use thunderbolt. And I got a star. I beat that,

502
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:12,060
I beat that when I was four. Yes, so did I. Well, I was like probably, I was more like 12.

503
01:36:20,970 --> 01:36:30,199
This is not good. This is not good. The mustachioed one is strong. Strong, yes.

504
01:36:30,199 --> 01:36:52,680
Yes. We must warn the boss. Come on. Now I'm the fucking king. Gracious. Oh, it's you, Mario.

505
01:36:52,680 --> 01:37:07,029
What a relief. Once again, Mario to the rescue. But who were those? Chancellor. Sir, thank goodness

506
01:37:07,029 --> 01:37:23,210
you're all right. Mario, so it was you who got us through all this. We owe you a lot. First the

507
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:32,340
princess and now this. It's too much to bear. Mario, how about we ask my grandpa for help?

508
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:39,979
He knows everything. Excuse me, but who the fuck are you? Oh, hello. My name is Malo. I'm from Chad

509
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:47,180
Pol Pond. Well, any friend of Mario's is welcome here in Mushroom Kingdom. As I was saying, Mario,

510
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:57,060
you are, you are, or as I was saying, Mario, you are our only hope. Why can't I do that?

511
01:37:57,859 --> 01:38:05,239
Mario, please, you must rescue the princess now. Mario, I'm in your debt too. Let's head over to

512
01:38:05,239 --> 01:38:13,029
Grandpa's place in Chad Pol Pond. He can help. Wait, why did I even come to Mushroom Kingdom in

513
01:38:13,029 --> 01:38:24,310
the first place? I guess I'll find out. I don't know. Could Mac, the sword-like monster who crashed

514
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:31,579
into Mushroom Kingdom, have anything to do with the star piece that Mario found? Our heroes move

515
01:38:31,579 --> 01:38:54,579
on towards the Kiro sewers. Mario, all we can do is wait here. Don't let us down. Goodbye. Uh-oh,

516
01:38:54,579 --> 01:39:13,449
sewer level. Resident Sleeper. Uh-oh, Resident Sleeper coming up. Uh, I think we just surpassed

517
01:39:13,449 --> 01:39:25,640
Ralph. Oh, wait, wait. Oh, wait, wait, wait, hold on. This is the high score. Oh, now look,

518
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:44,550
I lost good at you. Oh, you idiot. I'm like, hey, hey, hey, hey, item shop. All right, here we go.

519
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:54,380
Hey, Malo, what kept you? I was starting to worry. Hey, mister, I got my coin back. Oh, well done,

520
01:39:54,380 --> 01:40:00,600
lad. Okay, here's the thing I promised you. There, make sure it doesn't get stolen, eaten, or whatever.

521
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:13,609
Your grandpa needs it, okay? Got a cricket pie. You bet. Mario, thank you so much.

522
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:21,350
Grandpa will be delighted. You know, I hate to admit it, but I love this job. What are you looking

523
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:28,760
for? Who are you? What do you mean, Luigi's in, where's Luigi? Luigi's in this game more than he

524
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:44,949
is in Mario 64. Where is Luigi? In here? I don't know that. Luigi's not here. Why does Malo sound

525
01:40:44,949 --> 01:40:54,250
like your dog? Because they're both like seven. No, there's no Luigi. I've played this game 500

526
01:40:54,250 --> 01:41:06,020
times. There's no Luigi. I know that for a fact. Okay, so I got, I have plenty of items. Let's move

527
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:15,880
on. We're going to go to the sewers. He's behind the big house. Luigi's not in this game. He really

528
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:35,800
is here. Luigi, where is he then? Behind the big house. Is this Luigi? Trample the monsters. Smash

529
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:55,590
them all. It'll do you good. Trust me on this one. Is that Luigi? I don't know. That's not

530
01:41:55,590 --> 01:42:06,199
Luigi. That was a half-assed phone did Luigi. Like, come on. I wasn't even trying. Kiro sewers.

531
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:17,180
This is the entrance. Grandpa says to watch out for Balo, whoever that is. It's probably a little

532
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:34,489
dark down there, so keep alert. Kiro sewers. I love this. This is the best sound. One of the best

533
01:42:34,489 --> 01:42:54,729
top five sounds in the whole game. Ah, all right, let's go. Read directions on how to enter. Sure.

534
01:42:55,449 --> 01:43:00,010
Stand on the pipe and push down on the control pad. If you're pressing several buttons at the same

535
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:15,020
time, you will not be able to enter. To re-enter a pipe, jump off once and try again. Thank you.

536
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:20,250
All right, so this is a little bit of a maze scenario. Although, I mean, not really. It is,

537
01:43:20,250 --> 01:43:24,550
but it isn't. It is. I'm just checking it out. I wanted to check it out. Check out some stuff.

538
01:43:25,189 --> 01:43:31,859
There are pipes everywhere, leading to god-who-knows-what.

539
01:43:33,659 --> 01:43:55,289
And there are rats, so this now became your favorite game. Shit. Shit. It's an automatic

540
01:43:55,289 --> 01:44:13,500
letter grade. Boink. He's tired now. These little mice. Yeah, they're kind of like, um, like little

541
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:31,939
mousers, right? I missed time. It's okay. What was that? What was the name of the mouse in Mario?

542
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:42,500
Mario 2. With the bombs? That was Mouser. Why am I getting question marks?

543
01:44:46,380 --> 01:45:03,609
Ooh, pure water. All right, let's go. Shit just jumps out at you. This is, uh, the game that I

544
01:45:03,609 --> 01:45:08,649
make a reference to every- oh fuck. Oh no, this is not good. This is very bad. I forgot about this.

545
01:45:08,649 --> 01:45:14,729
All right, this thing's hard. This thing's really hard. Really hard. Um, I was going to say it's

546
01:45:14,729 --> 01:45:18,489
Dark Souls reference. I was going to say it's- it's one of the things that I reference every

547
01:45:18,489 --> 01:45:46,279
single fucking game. It's really high damage. Don't you dare. I didn't, so I- I did not. That

548
01:45:46,279 --> 01:46:02,500
hurts. Does Thunderbolt do anything? I wonder how bad Thunderbolt is. Zero. Oh god. I'm dead.

549
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:20,659
Good thing I got these, because I'm a scrub. Oh, it hurts a lot. It don't matter. Okay,

550
01:46:20,659 --> 01:46:30,890
the carny kiss. I have to block. 80. Come on. I think I'm just gonna block, because look at

551
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:41,510
how much damage this is gonna do. I'm gonna heal Mario with- no. Use the honey syrup. Pure

552
01:46:41,510 --> 01:47:02,680
water's for ghosts. Okay. Uh oh. I didn't fucking block it. Shit! It's hard to block. It's a- after

553
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:26,949
the sound? All right, come on. This is it. Dead. Yes! A lot of- and flower jar and a lot of coins.

554
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:41,699
Good. And I got a true form pin. Fuck yeah. True form, uh, means you cannot be turned into a

555
01:47:41,699 --> 01:47:46,579
mushroom or a scarecrow. It just essentially turns you off. I'm gonna give that to Mellow.

556
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:57,850
And I did get a jar, so what do I got? I don't have any pick-me-ups left, but I have two.

557
01:47:58,810 --> 01:48:06,699
Uh, I'm not gonna use this yet. I'll use it later. But that was good. Now I have to go back and save

558
01:48:06,699 --> 01:48:18,520
it. I gotta make the speedrunner jump. I got it. I actually- I did it. I can't believe it.

559
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:22,119
I actually cannot fucking believe it. That- literally speedrunners take hours doing that.

560
01:48:22,119 --> 01:48:41,859
I just did it. I watched somebody sit here for four hours doing that one time.

561
01:48:41,859 --> 01:48:58,539
Ah! I forget! I forget what to do! I forget where to go! That's all right. Still got what I wanted.

562
01:49:14,779 --> 01:49:23,560
Guys, I'm gonna have to fill two backpacks full of pick-me-ups if you don't start picking HP.

563
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:38,180
You were gonna do that anyways.

564
01:49:54,739 --> 01:50:15,220
No one gets HP. Yes, you have to have some- you have to have a tank. I want to save it. Save it.

565
01:50:16,310 --> 01:50:26,390
Because I don't want to fight that stupid thing again. If you need a tank, you're not DPSing

566
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:39,430
fast enough. What are you on about? How are you supposed to DPS without- how- without being

567
01:50:39,430 --> 01:51:00,199
protected first? You can't, like, attack something. That's not gonna work. Drain the water. Ah! Sorry.

568
01:51:00,199 --> 01:51:33,979
Miss. Fuck off with that. Got it. Sometimes I try to trick ya. Not me. End of level. Use pure water?

569
01:51:34,619 --> 01:51:59,960
Oh, lazy. I have to hit X. Mario's level five! Ooh, that's a big- that's a big increase. Help me,

570
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:29,960
please. Pick something good. Hope you do. Now this is a fight. Damn. 43, 42. I can't do this.

571
01:52:29,960 --> 01:53:05,000
All right. Seems HP has taken- no? Okay. Uh, I'm gonna close this in 10 seconds. Five, four,

572
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:19,800
three, two, one, zero. I- what am I supposed to do? 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three,

573
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:58,409
two, one. HP. Thank you. The water's been drained. How is that rigged? That's not rigged. That was

574
01:53:58,890 --> 01:54:12,970
an- I was in a democracy election there. The water has been drained. Ah, it's okay.

575
01:54:14,949 --> 01:54:23,640
I'm glad we went through all that for three HP. Three HP could mean life or death, guys.

576
01:54:24,439 --> 01:54:40,149
Jerma, are you allowing multi-click on that? Because I think I single-handedly won HP. No,

577
01:54:40,149 --> 01:54:49,750
I'm not. It is only on one click. Are you openly admitting that you were spamming the click button?

578
01:54:51,850 --> 01:55:08,390
Openly admitting for manipulation? What the heck, man? Uh, yeah, I want to go up there. Okay.

579
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:12,569
I want to get up there. I forget how you get up there. How do I get up there?

580
01:55:12,569 --> 01:55:19,609
How do- I know there's a way to get up there. I gotta go through that one and then you jump

581
01:55:19,609 --> 01:55:22,090
up there and then you jump up there. Shit. How do I get that one?

582
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:50,760
This must be Belong? Is that a fire hose or a tongue?

583
01:55:50,760 --> 01:56:07,930
It's a snack attack. And you're it, mate. Let's try fire.

584
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:41,239
Room service has been kind to me. Where's me bib? Good block. Perfect block.

585
01:56:56,819 --> 01:57:05,859
God, standard. The hunger. The hunger. He's dead. He's gone. That was one of the biggest things of

586
01:57:05,859 --> 01:57:10,819
this game when it first came out. People- I was trying to keep a seal on that because

587
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:16,659
Malo's gone now. He picks a character and they're gone. He ate them. That was a big controversy

588
01:57:16,659 --> 01:57:34,739
when it first came out. It was like, what the fuck? The character's just gone? That was scary.

589
01:57:37,670 --> 01:57:46,020
Oh, that's weird. I must not have played past that part. I don't think anybody else did either.

590
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:51,659
I think when that happened, everyone just kind of assumed that was the- like the end of the

591
01:57:51,659 --> 01:57:54,939
kind of- that character pissed a lot of people off. I don't think very many people played past

592
01:57:54,939 --> 01:58:06,899
that. That's why I believed it, too. Ooh, stick for a body and full of straw.

593
01:58:07,699 --> 01:58:22,760
Give me a scarecrow. Raw, raw, raw. Scarecrows cannot do anything but magic.

594
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:42,359
That's fine. I'm going to take a honey syrup. Sleep socks. No shit, that's not good.

595
01:58:44,569 --> 01:58:51,699
It's all right. I'm just going to keep jumping on them. I'm already a scarecrow, so I don't know.

596
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:12,699
I cannot do anything now. Let's hope that Malo wakes up. Oh, I wish that it just hit him.

597
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:21,720
I can't do anything. I can just defend. That's it. Hey, look, Malo woke up. I don't have any more

598
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:35,590
honey. No, I don't. Nope. I have to punch him to death. Pure water? No, he's not a ghost.

599
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:51,590
Uh, I can't stand it. The hunger. Uh, hey, Mario's back. Should be pretty close.

600
01:59:59,930 --> 02:00:07,460
That was scary. If you defeat me, you still won't beat me. Beware the flood.

601
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:27,449
Malo must have been lying when he said water would come gushing out of here.

602
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:38,949
Mario, do you hear something, or is it just me? It's water! Quick, Mario, hit the button before

603
02:00:38,949 --> 02:00:52,020
it washed away. You couldn't have stood on the button. That means he's so light that he's like

604
02:00:52,739 --> 02:01:01,579
a pound. This is the Midas River course. Want to crash course? No. I know you've got to float down

605
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:19,210
and swim, and there's coins to collect. There's a broad coin right here. Got it. All right,

606
02:01:19,210 --> 02:01:31,829
I don't- I think I skipped this one, if I remember. Which side do I go on? Left side?

607
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:40,680
Broad coin. And I'm gonna go in. Should I- all right, should I go in this?

608
02:01:41,319 --> 02:01:56,439
I don't remember. I know you go in one of them. There it is. Come on, give me it. Give me it!

609
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:13,979
Give me that flower tap right now. No! Please! Get it! It's mine! Yeah!

610
02:02:15,739 --> 02:02:27,420
Yeah, now we're over here and we bounce. We should get- I can't.

611
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:43,989
I think I'm gonna go right this time. I'm gonna go in the right hole.

612
02:02:45,029 --> 02:03:04,939
Give me it! Yes! Give me those coins! Spray them! There we go again. Getting spit out.

613
02:03:05,579 --> 02:03:15,689
I think that's the end of that. Oh, I'm- yeah, I remember this part. That's right.

614
02:03:15,689 --> 02:03:19,930
Now for the barrel jumping. Um, give me some point. I do- I remember this, but hold on. You

615
02:03:19,930 --> 02:03:25,210
jump from barrel to barrel. Time your jumps and grab coins along the way. Yep, yep, yep, yep.

616
02:03:25,210 --> 02:03:29,050
Jump onto the next barrel before they collide. Right, okay, let's deal with that. Now I know

617
02:03:29,050 --> 02:03:34,180
exactly what's going on. You- you can stay on it. You'll- if you don't have to jump. All right,

618
02:03:34,180 --> 02:03:39,750
let's go. Almost forgot to tell you, leap over the fish that pop up or you'll lose coins. All

619
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:57,140
right, let's go. All right, straight. And again, straight. Change course. Watch out for the fish.

620
02:04:00,739 --> 02:04:17,689
Fuck, I missed one. No! I thought I got it! Oof! Change.

621
02:04:18,329 --> 02:04:38,060
Hahaha. Stay on this one. No, I want to stay on that one! I tried. Change course. Oof, that was

622
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:56,939
close. What? How did I not get that? There it is. Wasn't that fun? You got 61 coins. Trade the coins

623
02:04:56,939 --> 02:05:02,460
you got from Midas River for frog coins. As a first-time-only bonus, I'll give you one frog

624
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:08,220
coin for 60 of your coins. If you didn't know, frog coins are the green ones and tadpole ponds

625
02:05:08,220 --> 02:05:15,500
got more info on them. You got 61 coins, so you get one frog coin. Yeah. I will hold your

626
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:21,619
one extra coin. Here's something I picked up. You can keep it for good luck. You got a knock-knock

627
02:05:21,619 --> 02:05:44,520
shell. Knock-knock shell is Mario's next weapon. Knock-knock shell. Kick to attack. By the way,

628
02:05:44,520 --> 02:06:10,329
I think you can do this over and over again. All right, I'm gonna take the first pee. I'm gonna

629
02:06:10,329 --> 02:06:18,970
pee my pants. I've been drinking water. I'll be right back. Two hours and no piss. That's a first.

630
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:25,939
Hey. Sorry, I want to grab a drink too.

631
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:49,109
Jesus. Is it time for PBR? No. This is a pineapple juice. Oh, just gonna have a cold one.

632
02:10:53,819 --> 02:10:58,380
That does sound really fucking weird. I'm just pouring a pineapple juice into here.

633
02:11:04,359 --> 02:11:20,359
All right, he's peeing in a glass. All right, back to it. So we just got out of the sewers.

634
02:11:21,779 --> 02:11:42,039
We're now going to tadpole pond to go meet grandpa. Where is this?

635
02:11:53,060 --> 02:11:59,560
Hi, can I help you? Malo, it's you. We've heard all about your adventures with Super Mario.

636
02:12:01,239 --> 02:12:11,430
You guys beat up Balaam, right? You know about that? See Mario, the waterways of the world bring

637
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:20,520
news to us here all the time. That's why grandpa knows all the news that's fit to hear. Are you

638
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:27,930
really the Super Mario? Hey everybody, you'll never guess who's here. No, these are not talking frying

639
02:12:27,930 --> 02:12:36,869
pans. These are tadpoles. They're huge. He's the real thing. Doesn't look anything like I thought

640
02:12:36,869 --> 02:12:52,119
he would. They do say he can jump better than a froggy. I wonder if it's only a rumor. I sure can.

641
02:12:55,220 --> 02:13:06,550
Well, grasshopper, what's new? Grandpa, Mario's been helping me. I know, child.

642
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:16,920
That rainstorm we just had, that was you, wasn't it? Oh, watch it up there. You're supposed to make

643
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:35,689
me look like I'm floating. Welcome. So you are Mario, yes? I am Frogfusus. You've come to seek

644
02:13:35,689 --> 02:13:42,569
wisdom from me, have you not? I've been waiting for you. Yes, old, wise people can often give good

645
02:13:42,569 --> 02:13:53,340
advice. But how rude of me. Let's get more comfortable. Come along and we'll talk.

646
02:13:55,260 --> 02:14:03,989
Clear. Full reverse. Tadpoles, don't just float there. Make yourselves useful.

647
02:14:07,239 --> 02:14:32,229
Form a bridge for Mario. Everyone talking about the music. It stopped for one second.

648
02:14:32,869 --> 02:14:42,489
Yes, come into my sanctuary and partake of my wisdom, children. Let's see. That smithy

649
02:14:42,489 --> 02:14:48,979
character that appeared at Bowser's Keep, he is quite formidable, yes? And Mario, you wish to

650
02:14:48,979 --> 02:14:55,619
rescue the princess quickly, do you not? But, oh, if all of you do the truth, Toadstool is no longer

651
02:14:55,619 --> 02:15:11,770
there? Uh, what? Patience, young one. Let me explain. Here is what happened. You were rescuing

652
02:15:11,770 --> 02:15:16,329
Toadstool from Bowser's Keep. After defeating him, and just when you were about to free the

653
02:15:16,329 --> 02:15:25,270
princess, you heard a loud crash and saw a sword split the sky. This, whoosh, out of the blue.

654
02:15:26,149 --> 02:15:32,279
The shark sent the three of you flying. Bowser and Toadstool are still lost somewhere out there.

655
02:15:33,079 --> 02:15:39,819
Now, listen to me. You're worried about the princess, but first you need to take care of

656
02:15:39,899 --> 02:15:47,319
Smithy. His underlings are wrecking havoc in our world. Mac, whom you defeated at Mushroom Kingdom,

657
02:15:47,319 --> 02:15:54,699
was one of them. More will be coming. Grandpa, I almost forgot to tell you something. We found a

658
02:15:54,699 --> 02:16:01,180
star in the castle at Mushroom Kingdom. Do you know why it was there? A star, and most interesting.

659
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:05,899
This may sound illogical, but I believe shooting stars can grant wishes.

660
02:16:06,779 --> 02:16:10,460
And now, more than ever, I believe they will play a vital role in the fight against Smithy.

661
02:16:13,689 --> 02:16:22,020
Was that too much to absorb? Would you like a recap? No. It's quite a situation we have

662
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:29,619
on our hands, ain't it? Wow, everything sounds so dire and serious. I guess Mac was only the

663
02:16:29,619 --> 02:16:36,020
first of many, Mario. Some of them will make Bowser seem nice. Mallow, you speak as if these

664
02:16:36,020 --> 02:16:43,219
things do not concern you. You will accompany Mario on his adventure, too. Grandpa, what are

665
02:16:43,219 --> 02:16:55,510
you talking about? I'm only a simple tadpole. This adventure isn't for me. Mallow, my boy,

666
02:16:55,510 --> 02:17:10,969
I've kept this from you until now, but you're not a tadpole. What? I was sitting here on a rainy day,

667
02:17:10,969 --> 02:17:16,389
enjoying a snack of crickets when I happened to see a basket floating down from the fog.

668
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:24,180
I peeked inside and saw a little baby staring right back at me. The name Mallow was written

669
02:17:24,260 --> 02:17:30,540
on his belt. I felt sorry for the little bundle of puff and took him in to raise as my own grandchild.

670
02:17:31,420 --> 02:17:38,569
He had powerful magic, and I knew he was more than a piece of fluff. I thought surely this child must

671
02:17:38,569 --> 02:17:52,840
be from some far off land. Grandpa, you mean I'm not a tadpole? Stop that! Mallow, now is not the

672
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:58,780
time to cry. Go with Mario on his adventure and find your real family. Your real mother and father

673
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:09,780
were out there somewhere. Hey, Mario, the boy's magic is sure to come in handy on your adventure.

674
02:18:10,579 --> 02:18:17,860
You'll take him along, right? Grandpa, I won't cry anymore. I'll go on this adventure with Mario

675
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:23,700
and find my real family. Then it is settled. You must embark on your adventure immediately.

676
02:18:25,260 --> 02:18:43,209
First, go to Rose Town where they need your help. It'll be quiet around here with Mallow gone.

677
02:18:44,170 --> 02:18:50,729
Maybe a snack will cheer me up. Wait a minute! That's right, I'd forgotten all about it.

678
02:18:51,290 --> 02:18:56,979
I'll give you something for the cricket pie you brought back. Oh, you shall have the staff I

679
02:18:56,979 --> 02:19:03,719
used when I was Mallow's age. Oh, it must have to be here somewhere. The froggy stick will come in

680
02:19:03,719 --> 02:19:15,850
handy. Do not forget to equip it. Froggy stick? Holy shit, boy, he's going off script.

681
02:19:24,059 --> 02:19:47,290
Here we go. So you can also spend frog coins here. Welcome to the Frog Coin Emporium. You're a first

682
02:19:47,290 --> 02:19:52,809
timer, aren't you? Listen up. The green coins you find periodically are frog coins. Accumulate them

683
02:19:52,809 --> 02:20:03,110
and you can buy items at Tadpole Pond. So as you see, this is the real currency. Bracer

684
02:20:04,309 --> 02:20:11,450
raises defense, raises allies' battle power, raises party's entire, all the party's defense,

685
02:20:12,409 --> 02:20:21,030
raises the whole party's attack power, but I don't, I never used them. This is the premium currency,

686
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:32,459
yes. Welcome to the juice bar. Are you a card member? Even Todofsky has a membership here.

687
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:36,299
Sorry, you're limited to this menu if you don't have a current membership card.

688
02:20:37,500 --> 02:20:50,040
You can buy a froggy drink. Party recovers 30 HP. These are actually pretty good. I'll buy a few of

689
02:20:50,840 --> 02:21:03,479
them. Put the froggy stick on. Did I get the secret coin that I only have one chance at? No,

690
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:17,670
I didn't. Melody Bay. Play notes by jumping on the tadpoles. Let's hear your melody.

691
02:21:20,069 --> 02:21:33,260
Now this is, there are a ton of deep secrets in this game. You have to play certain songs

692
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:48,629
for Todofsky and some of them are very difficult to figure out which ones you should play. It takes

693
02:21:48,629 --> 02:21:54,969
playing through this whole game and knowing very specific random things. Is that something you

694
02:21:54,969 --> 02:21:59,850
composed? No, that's not the right melody at all. Yeah, he's looking for like the right melody.

695
02:22:00,809 --> 02:22:05,129
I'm the composer Todofsky. I am trying to create my next masterpiece, but I've got composer's block.

696
02:22:06,469 --> 02:22:10,620
You want a music lesson from moi? No. Fine, be that way.

697
02:22:21,909 --> 02:22:33,559
He's still explaining the game. I've got this dream of becoming a composer. I want to be as

698
02:22:33,559 --> 02:22:41,239
famous as Todofsky. My favorite song? It's Frogfusious's suite number 18,

699
02:22:41,239 --> 02:22:50,489
so la mi re do re do re. Todofsky's fond of it too. Okay, there it is. That's one of them.

700
02:22:53,739 --> 02:23:04,569
So la mi re do re do re. I'm just gonna write it down. So la mi re do re do re.

701
02:23:05,530 --> 02:23:08,090
So la mi re do re do re.

702
02:23:10,409 --> 02:23:20,309
Okay, I don't know which one of these is do. It's the start, right? Do is the first one,

703
02:23:20,309 --> 02:23:27,180
right? It's do re mi la. So this is up here would be do. Is it descending or descending? I don't

704
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:41,750
remember. So do re mi fa so. Do re mi fa so la so. Do re mi fa so la. Do re, this is the second one.

705
02:23:43,299 --> 02:24:09,559
Do re do re do re. So now I just do this. Isn't that something you composed? No, it's the other way

706
02:24:09,559 --> 02:24:26,420
then. So it's up this way. I did it backwards. It was upside down. So this is do re mi fa so.

707
02:24:29,610 --> 02:25:05,850
Do re mi fa so la. Do re mi re. So I need do re do re do re. That's it. Is that something you did?

708
02:25:07,399 --> 02:25:17,829
That's not what? See the five lines between the second and third lines from the top.

709
02:25:17,829 --> 02:25:27,850
Okay, so between the second and third lines from the top lies do. Keep going up and the notes are

710
02:25:27,850 --> 02:25:38,100
do re mi. Go down and you'll do do ti la so fa. Okay, right. So it's do. Okay, I need this. I need

711
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:47,500
this. I need a screenshot that I can't screenshot this. It's on a console. So going up is do re

712
02:25:47,500 --> 02:26:00,520
mi and then going down is do ti la so fa. Do re mi ti la so fa. Use your phone. Oh my god,

713
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:16,090
I fucking missed it. Okay, I'll get it. Okay, the notes. Second third lines is do. So you got do.

714
02:26:16,090 --> 02:26:27,450
I'm taking a picture. Okay, so do re mi is like up that way. So that's do re mi and then down is

715
02:26:27,450 --> 02:26:44,540
that's do ti la so fa. Got it. Okay, let's get it on there. Use chat screenshot instead.

716
02:26:45,739 --> 02:26:49,100
All right, so do is between the second. So this is do between second and third line.

717
02:26:49,979 --> 02:26:56,729
Do, right. So then I need to do. No, no, no, no, no. Back it up. Back it up. Fuck. I need to.

718
02:27:05,350 --> 02:27:14,709
Thank you, Otter Fiend for the 10 community subs. Thanks a lot, Otter. Thanks for the sub drop.

719
02:27:16,819 --> 02:27:30,149
I'll get it right out. Okay, so the out. So I mean, it's so. So that is do ti la so fa. Okay.

720
02:27:31,110 --> 02:27:43,129
Then that we need to do la. So there we go. We got do ti la is mi. So this is do re mi

721
02:27:45,000 --> 02:28:15,979
and then re do re do re. Re, re do. So this is do re do. I almost jumped. Do re do re. Got it. There

722
02:28:15,979 --> 02:28:21,459
it is. That's it. This is the melody I've been looking for. Thank you for the inspiration.

723
02:28:22,020 --> 02:28:27,379
Please take this as a token of my gratitude. Received an alto card. If I ever need help with

724
02:28:27,379 --> 02:28:35,159
my compositions again, I'll look for you here. Until then, adios. I feel like I do that a lot,

725
02:28:35,159 --> 02:28:39,000
what he just did. That like look at the air with your hands and go oh. I do that all the time.

726
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:55,500
All right, so I got my card now. Oh, I'm going to bed. Can't wait to graduate from music school

727
02:28:55,500 --> 02:29:07,270
and start composing. I just stole that person's music. May I help you? Oh, an alto card. What

728
02:29:07,270 --> 02:29:15,379
would you like? You can buy elixirs now. Party recovers 80 HP. That's a little out of budget,

729
02:29:15,379 --> 02:29:26,969
though. All right, now I think let me go back here and ask you another question. I think he's back

730
02:29:26,969 --> 02:29:32,180
and he gives you vague. Yeah, he's gonna give me vague things that I need to find.

731
02:29:33,139 --> 02:29:49,290
Well, maybe not yet. I think I probably have to unlock it. Just grind until I have 99 elixirs.

732
02:29:50,170 --> 02:29:57,270
That would be the most boring fucking thing I could ever do. I would hate that so much.

733
02:29:58,149 --> 02:30:08,620
Okay, a rose wave. You can't jump on or off when the block is blue.

734
02:30:08,620 --> 02:30:20,139
Try jumping when the block turns yellow. Now these move around in different places. I can go,

735
02:30:20,139 --> 02:30:38,299
yeah. I have to go across. Shit, it's okay. Did he find Luigi? Um, a long time ago. I did find

736
02:30:38,299 --> 02:31:05,620
Luigi. He's doing like crack behind one of the houses. Let's get that coin. No. Okay, can I go

737
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:21,850
from here? That didn't really... I had loved the froggy stick. I was gonna say I hate the froggy

738
02:31:21,850 --> 02:31:37,129
stick and I just immediately corrected myself. The giant enemy spider. Yeah, those things suck.

739
02:31:37,930 --> 02:31:56,469
Blocking these at all. All right, so I need to go around. I eventually will come around this way.

740
02:32:01,030 --> 02:32:06,260
Oh, I remember this part. I'm gonna knock them both off and go get the treasure.

741
02:32:07,059 --> 02:32:26,629
What a fun game. I'm not timing it right. The giant enemy spider is based on real Japanese history.

742
02:32:28,389 --> 02:32:52,309
Is it really? That's really cool. Jebaited. He's jebaited. Are you sure? I feel like I've

743
02:32:52,309 --> 02:33:07,829
heard that before. All right, I can't screw this up. I already did. I'm just gonna block.

744
02:33:11,879 --> 02:33:42,899
Damn it. Shit. Oh, I blew it. Oh no. Now I have to... Wait, hold on. Okay. I fucking desynced it.

745
02:33:44,059 --> 02:34:11,559
Now I have to desync enough times again to resync it. That's good enough. I'm gonna lose my fucking

746
02:34:11,559 --> 02:34:24,709
mind. Shit. I remember this. I remembered even years later doing this and being like,

747
02:34:24,709 --> 02:34:53,940
nah, I kind of don't care. I just keep going. All right, nobody move. Got it. Frog coin. What?

748
02:34:53,940 --> 02:35:16,809
I can get that. All right, wrap it around. Watch out for those bandits. They steal. A penny? No,

749
02:35:16,809 --> 02:35:35,909
that's ten. That's ten coins. The big ones. Damn it. Miscalculated. Pick it down. Yeah, money's

750
02:35:35,909 --> 02:35:46,170
worth a lot. Come on. I gotta spend money. Let's see. Does this keep going this way? It does.

751
02:35:48,069 --> 02:35:53,670
I missed all of it. Every single one. I still didn't. Unbelievable. That's truly not fucking

752
02:35:53,670 --> 02:36:17,819
believable. Okay, let's go. I don't... No, hold on. I think there's other things I can do here.

753
02:36:18,620 --> 02:36:26,540
What else can I do? What else is this gonna do for me? Something cool? Nothing cool at all?

754
02:36:27,500 --> 02:36:34,629
There's no secrets? There has to be a secret. No secret. Maybe there is. I don't remember.

755
02:36:35,430 --> 02:36:37,770
All right, let's get the heck out of here.

756
02:36:51,989 --> 02:37:03,959
Full health. Watch out for the bandit. Damn it. He got it.

757
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:11,579
Well, why did you run into me then if you're just gonna run away?

758
02:37:18,389 --> 02:37:29,510
No face cam, resident sleeper, no tuber reactions. What am I even doing here? Holy shit, he almost

759
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:58,010
insta-killed me. Fucking fart on stream. I'm not going to do that, so don't worry.

760
02:37:58,729 --> 02:38:04,250
Those of you that are concerned, don't ask me why. Those of you that are concerned saying,

761
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:15,750
no, don't, don't do that. Why are you assuming that I would do something like that? Why would

762
02:38:15,750 --> 02:38:22,629
I do that? Why would I just turn like my ass up and just go like...

763
02:38:32,780 --> 02:38:39,399
Why would I do that? Guys, I am a super embarrassed farter and I want to just explain this.

764
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:47,159
I don't fart unless like I like go into a closed room and make sure that nobody is within like 50

765
02:38:47,159 --> 02:38:59,829
feet of me. If there are people within like a hundred foot radius of me, I don't do it and I

766
02:38:59,829 --> 02:39:20,520
like escape. This is actually kind of bad. I'm gonna die. Damn it, why did he run away?

767
02:39:21,590 --> 02:39:45,129
Why did you run? Jerma, do you hear me? What? Snuck that one. This is cool, right here, go.

768
02:39:45,690 --> 02:40:01,049
Wait, don't do that. It's the army. All right, people, form ranks. Attention,

769
02:40:01,049 --> 02:40:12,219
shelled warriors, hooded sorcerers, and last but not least, ground wing goombas. This is our finest

770
02:40:12,299 --> 02:40:17,739
moment. The koopa troop is invincible. We shall be victorious. The bridge is down,

771
02:40:17,739 --> 02:40:27,370
but we'll find a way to get back in. Move out, on the double. Snap. That's right, Bowser in this

772
02:40:27,370 --> 02:40:39,459
game, whenever he doesn't move, he snaps his fingers. It's fucking awesome. Bowser and his

773
02:40:39,459 --> 02:40:53,430
troops must be on their way to Bowser's keep. Come on, Rosetown's just up ahead. Rosetown.

774
02:40:56,739 --> 02:41:05,190
Ooh, you all right? See, arrows come flying out from the forest and when you're hit, you can't move.

775
02:41:05,989 --> 02:41:16,440
See, look, I can't move a muscle. Now I know how our scarecrow feels. Since the day of shooting

776
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:27,930
star fell into the forest, arrows have been showering our town. Get inside, quick, get inside.

777
02:41:28,819 --> 02:41:38,549
I tell you, it's scary out here, where someone's gotta pump the water, like this. One, two, one,

778
02:41:38,549 --> 02:41:48,090
two, one, two, one, two. Someone's gotta do it. I'm desperately waiting for the comedic moment

779
02:41:48,090 --> 02:41:55,110
where I can make a noise when I get hit, but this ain't a comedy stream. This is a nostalgia stream.

780
02:41:55,750 --> 02:42:18,979
Item shop. Ding. And then to get this one, you gotta, you gotta fall to the ceiling.

781
02:42:23,719 --> 02:42:30,120
But hey, why don't we uh, why don't we go in here? Should I go in here? What do you think? I think

782
02:42:30,120 --> 02:43:00,120
it's time to go in here. I know, I know. I'm just very excited. No, no. The audio's desynced? Like in

783
02:43:00,120 --> 02:43:36,649
the game? It's not. Luigi's behind the house. Oh, maybe I should go find him. That's weird. Here we go.

784
02:43:56,659 --> 02:44:01,610
It hurt me with your childish pranks. Attention, Toadstool, you're coming with me. Zip your lip.

785
02:44:02,629 --> 02:44:17,000
Help, help, somebody help me! Oh my god. It's, it's, it's, it's mom. Mom, we have a guest.

786
02:44:18,440 --> 02:44:30,440
Yes dear, I hear you have. Hello there, aren't you Mario? For real? Well, you have the hat and the

787
02:44:30,440 --> 02:44:45,530
funky stash. Are you really Mario? Wrong number. You bet. How do I know it's you? You might just be

788
02:44:45,530 --> 02:44:55,319
pulling my leg. Show me, prove it. All right, okay. Mario, you want to play with me? I'm playing save

789
02:44:55,319 --> 02:45:02,659
the world. Now, Gaz, Mario might be a little tired, dear. Aw, come on mom. You never play with me. It's

790
02:45:02,659 --> 02:45:10,739
no fun playing alone. Oh dear, Mario. I hate to ask, but could you play with Gaz for a little while?

791
02:45:12,329 --> 02:45:23,319
Yes! Okay, Mario just bought the farm, so you can be Bowser. I'll be Gino, okay? Ready? Let's play

792
02:45:23,319 --> 02:45:34,860
from where I left off. All set. Oh scary, but just watch me. Better watch out, Bowser, because Gino's

793
02:45:34,860 --> 02:45:47,879
gonna blow you away. Take this! Your turn, Bowser. Easy, Mario. It's just, it's just a game, Mario.

794
02:45:47,879 --> 02:45:53,770
It's just a kid. Ow! Oh no, if he keeps this app unfinished. All right, you asked for it.

795
02:45:54,489 --> 02:46:00,649
The super duper custom patented one star, one star on Yelp. Shooting star shot.

796
02:46:03,770 --> 02:46:16,649
Oops, I think I missed. Oh, Mario. Mario, you, Mario, you good? Everybody shut up. This is the

797
02:46:16,649 --> 02:47:30,059
most important thing in my whole life. There he is, there he is. Shh. It's not Luigi.

798
02:47:30,379 --> 02:47:44,340
You know, for the longest time I thought his name was Geno. I was like 12. I thought it was Geno.

799
02:47:44,340 --> 02:48:01,750
That was a 10 out of 10 Mario dream. Yeah, Mario, maybe you shouldn't eat like a pint of ice cream

800
02:48:01,750 --> 02:48:08,920
before bed anymore. Mom, you'll never believe what I just saw. It was amazing. I just saw Gino walk

801
02:48:08,920 --> 02:48:15,559
into the forest. Neat, huh? Yes dear, that's nice dear. And isn't Gino the one who broke my lamp the

802
02:48:15,639 --> 02:48:23,159
other day? Oh my, it was just, this is real. I swear mom, really, it's true. I saw him outside.

803
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:26,760
All right, Gaz, let's hear it. What are you trying to get out of this this time?

804
02:48:28,489 --> 02:48:35,579
Mom, I didn't do anything. I really saw Geno. And she's, I guess it's implied that she's like

805
02:48:35,579 --> 02:48:46,090
screaming out. Oh, this boy is impossible. Sorry if I hurt you, but what would Geno want in the

806
02:48:46,090 --> 02:49:06,120
forest? What would Geno want in the forest? I'm going to buy some shit. Mario, good to have a

807
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:12,260
customer at last. What do you need? What do I have? I have eight, I should, I need syrups.

808
02:49:13,299 --> 02:49:26,969
I have, I might as well get five of these. Maybe one or two, a couple more of these. Hey Mario,

809
02:49:26,969 --> 02:49:33,059
it's so nice of you to drop by the shop. What can I do for you? Thick shirt, thick pants.

810
02:49:33,860 --> 02:49:44,520
Oh, we need thick shirt, thick pants. Jump shoes are actually really good. Wake up pin

811
02:49:45,399 --> 02:49:50,969
prevents sleep. You won't be turned into a mushroom, prevents fear. These are way too

812
02:49:50,969 --> 02:49:58,620
expensive. Let's see, I'm going to sell some stuff too. Jump shoes, they, as you see,

813
02:49:59,739 --> 02:50:06,700
drop your defense, but they make your magic attack really good, which is my, obviously my jump

814
02:50:06,700 --> 02:50:14,329
ability. What is my defense at right now? 22 and 19. 22 and my magic, yeah, that's actually, no,

815
02:50:14,329 --> 02:50:23,799
that's good. I go up to 23 magic attack. Yeah, I'm putting on. True form versus wake up. Mushrooms

816
02:50:23,799 --> 02:50:34,340
and it prevents mute. I don't think this upcoming boss does air crows, but do lose. Sorry, put the

817
02:50:34,340 --> 02:50:42,940
thick pants on. Put the thick shirt on. I'm going to keep the wake up pin, but I'm going to sell

818
02:50:42,940 --> 02:50:57,260
this other stuff. Okay, I think we're good. I'm going to maybe get a couple more items.

819
02:50:57,979 --> 02:51:13,559
All right, that should be all right, I think. If it's not, it's not. Everyone is, you're about

820
02:51:13,559 --> 02:51:17,159
to hear the best song in the whole game, by the way. This is, yeah, I would, I've seen a lot of

821
02:51:17,159 --> 02:51:21,719
resident sleepers. I would wake up for this one because this is the best song in the whole game.

822
02:51:29,129 --> 02:51:34,860
Still in Rosedown. I'm laughing my ass off. Yeah, this is the, we're going to be bopping here real

823
02:51:34,860 --> 02:52:24,520
quick. Into the forest maze. You ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? No, I don't, I don't, I want

824
02:52:24,520 --> 02:52:51,450
to hit the arrow. All right, we got it. That's why I'm going to be shooting pretty hard the whole

825
02:52:51,450 --> 02:53:11,690
song. That was a lot of fucking damage. And now he's poisoned. That went pretty good. Malo's like

826
02:53:11,690 --> 02:53:22,729
dead. He is going to die. Nope. I'm going to use one of the mushrooms because shit. He's almost

827
02:53:22,729 --> 02:53:34,100
dead. I don't want to use any unnecessary mushroom. Don't worry guys, the song comes right back right

828
02:53:34,100 --> 02:53:58,579
now. I think there's something in these. I know there is something. I think there's like a frog

829
02:53:58,579 --> 02:54:42,329
coin or something in one of these. Star? Yeah, I think it is a star. You missed! What? What do you mean I missed?

830
02:54:43,129 --> 02:54:56,649
You missed? How does that make any sense? What the hell? Did I check this one?

831
02:55:03,430 --> 02:55:06,790
What is this song called? The song is called Beware the Forest Mushrooms.

832
02:55:08,950 --> 02:55:19,979
There are probably 500 remixes of this song on YouTube. This is one of those songs that

833
02:55:19,979 --> 02:55:24,059
everybody just seems to love over and over and over again and everybody thinks is like the

834
02:55:24,059 --> 02:55:29,260
greatest song that Nintendo has ever put in a game and they won't put it in any other fucking game.

835
02:55:30,059 --> 02:55:33,739
They won't put it anywhere. I don't even forget about like Gino and Smash Brothers. Why don't

836
02:55:33,739 --> 02:55:40,579
they just put this song in? Why? It's only in this game and everyone's like yeah that's probably the

837
02:55:40,579 --> 02:55:47,940
best Mario song ever. I don't want to hear like 15 different Nintendo official remixes of Rainbow

838
02:55:47,940 --> 02:56:00,170
Road. I want this! Gosh darn it. Square owns the rights to the song? Do they? No, I don't.

839
02:56:01,370 --> 02:56:13,260
What? All right, I need some levels here guys. So there are these characters that Square owns in

840
02:56:13,260 --> 02:56:19,579
this game. What the hell are you going to do with these characters? I never understood that. Well,

841
02:56:19,579 --> 02:56:23,420
you see the thing is like everybody like really loves these characters but Square owns them

842
02:56:23,420 --> 02:56:32,299
and they just lock them in a fucking box and nobody can look at them. Nobody can buy them.

843
02:56:32,299 --> 02:56:37,799
Nobody can look at them. Hey can you guys like do anything with those characters? No.

844
02:56:39,030 --> 02:56:51,719
Can you sell those characters to somebody that will? No. Please? Oh I got Psychopath. Good. Please

845
02:56:51,719 --> 02:56:59,209
go. I'm not even like Smash but like if like some of the characters that they brought into this

846
02:56:59,209 --> 02:57:03,370
game into the universe they're really cool. They're really fun interesting characters. They

847
02:57:03,370 --> 02:57:06,170
could be put anywhere. You could put them in another Mario game for all that matters.

848
02:57:07,129 --> 02:57:32,010
You guys are going straight up magic huh? What are we doing? 29, 30, 21, 22. He's doing a lot

849
02:57:32,010 --> 02:57:43,459
of damage. Square didn't even let Final Fantasy music in for the Final Fantasy characters in

850
02:57:44,020 --> 02:58:01,459
besides one track. Shit I missed it. Like how much? Was it just like a stupid amount or something?

851
02:58:02,979 --> 02:58:09,399
I wonder if Nintendo ever approached Square and said hey can we just buy all the intellectual

852
02:58:09,399 --> 02:58:14,840
property of the characters that are in that Mario game? This seriously is like a Disney and

853
02:58:14,840 --> 02:58:20,040
Sony fucking bullshit. That really is what this is. Disney and Sony come together and do like

854
02:58:20,040 --> 02:58:33,540
Spider-Man movies and then yeah that's the same the exact same thing that happened. That was a

855
02:58:33,540 --> 02:58:47,979
rock because now there's a bunch of these cool characters that we it's just no sorry you can't

856
02:58:47,979 --> 02:58:53,420
say anything about them ever again just but I just enjoy the thing that existed that one time. Why

857
02:58:53,420 --> 02:59:03,079
can't you just enjoy this thing? I do enjoy this thing. Well good. This thing was 20 fucking years

858
02:59:03,079 --> 02:59:10,440
ago. Well enjoy it. I know but can I can you do any can I have another one? No enjoy this one.

859
02:59:10,440 --> 02:59:16,120
I do I I already do. I love it so much that I want you to do another one so I will buy it.

860
02:59:16,120 --> 02:59:34,170
No go back and play that one again. Oh I'm getting angry. He's losing it.

861
02:59:34,489 --> 02:59:55,510
Oh first time today. I didn't do all night. What an embarrassment. It's all Disney's fault.

862
02:59:56,950 --> 03:00:02,040
All right we got Mario here. Hey thank you. Jerma sucks for the five community subs.

863
03:00:02,920 --> 03:00:20,649
Appreciate that. Thank you. We got super jump. What do you guys want to go now? We do everybody

864
03:00:20,649 --> 03:00:24,969
gave me so much shit when I talked about in the very beginning of this stream that when I was

865
03:00:24,969 --> 03:00:31,209
younger I just picked power only for a character HP only for another character and magic only for

866
03:00:31,209 --> 03:00:37,209
another character and I was called a doofus and now you guys are doing that exact thing.

867
03:00:38,010 --> 03:00:55,510
Okay that's 65% want me to continue to do power. Jeff just came in with five community subs. Thank

868
03:00:55,510 --> 03:01:05,719
you Jeff. Thank you Jeff and Jerma sucks both of you. You said not to ruin your childhood. Yeah

869
03:01:05,799 --> 03:01:20,540
that's true. I did say that. Don't do that. I know it's in one of these. Is this the last one?

870
03:01:20,540 --> 03:01:26,440
It's in this one. Did I like bait myself on a thing that I'm misremembering?

871
03:01:30,459 --> 03:01:35,659
Thank you the fax machine. This is three sub drops right in a row. Fax machine with five community

872
03:01:35,659 --> 03:01:47,260
subs. Thank you. Jeff, Jerma sucks and fax machine. This is just like ET on the Atari.

873
03:01:48,620 --> 03:02:01,860
Malo's dead and like I said it doesn't even need to be a Mario just anywhere. I would love it if

874
03:02:01,860 --> 03:02:08,100
Malo was taught like fucking healthy eating habits in like a DS game or something. Like I would

875
03:02:08,100 --> 03:02:25,290
fine it'd be cool. Why? It would be cool. I don't know. For your son or daughter to think it was

876
03:02:25,290 --> 03:02:40,309
cool. That would piss me off. Why would that make you so mad? That would piss me off if he was like

877
03:02:40,309 --> 03:02:53,139
in a vegetable eating tutorial game. Just play WoW Classic. No I'm not going to play WoW Classic.

878
03:02:53,940 --> 03:03:07,059
I think I'm I got an opportunity here. I need to take a mushroom. How am I doing on I got a flower

879
03:03:07,059 --> 03:03:24,579
jar. That's just easy. Might as well. I was gonna say remind me to pick those up. Some of them are

880
03:03:24,579 --> 03:03:48,979
poisonous though I think. Yeah pick those ones up. No I'm looking for secrets. Wait a minute. The

881
03:03:48,979 --> 03:03:53,860
first Jerma stream I tuned into was WoW and it put me off from watching you for years.

882
03:03:55,610 --> 03:04:03,379
Holy shit. Well what are you doing here? What made you come back?

883
03:04:10,309 --> 03:04:16,229
You know like okay as like a broadcaster that is that like is so horrible to hear that but I

884
03:04:16,229 --> 03:04:22,889
understand why. That's the worst part about all that. Like hearing that oh no dude I watched that

885
03:04:22,889 --> 03:04:26,729
stream and I was like I'm not fucking watching this person for like years. Like I'm like oh

886
03:04:26,729 --> 03:04:37,430
fuck man really but I know why you said that. What do you mean lol broadcaster? What is this?

887
03:04:38,069 --> 03:04:49,399
I'm sorry am I doing like am I doing like messages in fucking like I was gonna say

888
03:04:49,959 --> 03:05:10,059
smoke signals but I couldn't find the word. Check this out this is gonna be fucking awesome. No

889
03:05:10,059 --> 03:05:23,620
don't all run away I wanted to get this. Broadcaster lol. That's a lot of coins. He thinks he's a

890
03:05:23,620 --> 03:05:45,500
broadcaster. Whatever. Now let's heal up. Wasteful but I don't care and I'm gonna take this flower jar

891
03:05:45,500 --> 03:05:49,899
and I pissed off at least two people. They're not gonna watch for years after I did that.

892
03:05:50,620 --> 03:06:11,500
Here we go. Follow them. Now there is a secret in this forest. I forget what it is. You don't

893
03:06:11,500 --> 03:06:16,059
actually follow Gino. You do a different path and it gives you a huge treasure. I don't remember

894
03:06:16,059 --> 03:06:32,379
which way it is. I forget. I'm sure I'll come back. And it's got double tap. Do you want the

895
03:06:32,379 --> 03:06:53,799
directions? Uh no. No I don't think so. Somebody gives it to you eventually. I want this to be an

896
03:06:53,799 --> 03:07:11,209
organic experience. He thinks he's broadcasting right now. Where are you Gino? There you are.

897
03:07:12,010 --> 03:07:23,989
No. For some reason I have this weird image in my brain of if I ever did like an event

03:07:23,989 --> 03:07:30,600
where I was on a stage or something like it for twitch like oh twitchcon and here's germa985

902
03:07:48,979 --> 03:07:56,629

941
03:19:08,409 --> 03:19:18,090
why are you staring at me you know I'm more than just a doll don't you the hell have you guessed

942
03:19:18,090 --> 03:19:27,979
the truth I'm a visitor from above and this is the form I'm borrowing briefly you mean like from

943
03:19:27,979 --> 03:19:36,469
the sky or something higher than that I'm afraid do you too know anything about the star road got

944
03:19:36,469 --> 03:19:44,860
it completely in the dark well it's a big mess up there right now and it concerns you too let me

945
03:19:44,860 --> 03:19:53,030
explain you've heard of wishing upon a shooting star at the star road your wishes transformed

946
03:19:53,030 --> 03:20:01,399
into a star when it's granted it then turns into a shooting star and falls down to earth so you see

947
03:20:01,399 --> 03:20:08,149
the star road plays an integral role in granting wishes but ever since a sword destroyed the star

948
03:20:08,149 --> 03:20:15,659
road everything's come to a halt no stars have been made since the way things stand yours is a

949
03:20:15,659 --> 03:20:25,639
world where wishes can't come true anymore are you saying this star is part of your star way

950
03:20:25,639 --> 03:20:33,879
that star road my fluffy little friend yes that star is a broken piece of the star road

951
03:20:34,440 --> 03:20:41,620
I'm here to find them all and repair the star road the broken star pieces there are seven all

together for peace to return we must get rid of smithy find the star pieces and repair the star

953
03:20:48,260 --> 03:20:58,500
road I'm but it's hard to pronounce so just call me Gino after the door I chose him because he'd

954
03:20:58,500 --> 03:21:11,420
looked the strongest out of all the dogs now grab the star Mario I don't know what to do for a voice

955
03:21:11,420 --> 03:21:17,959
I've never had a head cannon for Gino to me it was always just do nothing it was I don't

1088
03:53:25,290 --> 03:53:31,940
when you do any of his magic attacks other than that not really worth having to party

04:26:56,139 --> 04:27:00,620
that means someone's gonna die who's all right I have to be careful

1212
04:27:09,450 --> 04:27:16,889

1219
04:29:25,000 --> 04:29:35,579
oddest parts of the game the place is fucking weird booster is such a nice place I miss my

1220
04:29:35,579 --> 04:29:42,139
fortress I miss the good old days toadstool screaming in terror of mario rushing in to save

1223
04:30:01,930 --> 04:30:06,170
if toadstool were at my castle waiting to be rescued she'd be crying like a baby

1224
04:30:14,649 --> 04:30:38,469
oh did I just hear some voices I can't believe it it's mario I'm up here that voice it's toadstool

1225
04:30:39,690 --> 04:30:48,950
I thought she'd gone away but she's been stuck here well I guess I'll be returning to my castle

1226
04:30:48,950 --> 04:31:27,500

1245
04:36:01,939 --> 04:36:13,939
let's go back this is a little fun puzzle I can't do this right now though I can later

1246
04:36:14,500 --> 04:36:26,569

04:36:41,369 --> 04:36:51,590
kind of is it yeah booster's voice

1249
04:36:56,900 --> 04:36:58,180
what's the big rush

1250
04:37:07,830 --> 04:37:14,310
I'm booster and this is my famous tower of amusement normally I welcome visitors to play

1251
04:37:14,310 --> 04:37:23,340
with me in my sniffits however a girl fell out of the sky and into my lap recently since then I've

1252
04:37:23,340 --> 04:37:30,150
been busy keeping her happy and entertained I no longer have the time to play so please enjoy

1253
04:37:30,150 --> 04:38:01,290
yourself at your own risk please refrain from bothering booster holy shit they did a lot of

1254
04:38:01,290 --> 04:38:35,400
damage oh fuck gotta be careful bye-bye let's heal while I still have a second mid-bush

1255
04:38:36,279 --> 04:39:08,740
oh take a honey syrup though I love the base on this one flower tap he's just hiding

1256
04:39:10,099 --> 04:39:16,090
all right here we go remember I told you I was gonna have to do this later got it

1257
04:39:17,130 --> 04:39:42,259
first try yeah found a masher that is a new weapon for mario it's much better take a look at that 97

1258
04:39:43,220 --> 04:39:58,220
versus 77 it's ridiculous 97 attack in fact now that mario has that item I'm going to give the

1259
04:39:58,220 --> 04:40:17,930
work pants to mario mario cannot use the work pants never mind give bowser the work pants well

1260
04:40:17,930 --> 04:40:35,400
geno's got the work pants and he's doing damage shit too fast you miss malo well you might see

1261
04:40:35,479 --> 04:40:51,529
malo again eventually what was that loud noise outside check out boosters pass

1262
04:40:51,529 --> 04:41:00,229
that is a new area I think are you guys ready are you ready

1263
04:41:34,599 --> 04:41:39,880
how did they get the rights I can't believe they got the rights to mario

1264
04:41:39,880 --> 04:41:58,250
oh that thing on the left sucks doesn't take it only takes damage from

1265
04:41:59,049 --> 04:42:08,389
um magic I think it's a pain in the ass earwig well that was not correct

1266
04:42:08,389 --> 04:42:20,740
I know that one of them is hard to kill and that's a little bit

1267
04:42:22,900 --> 04:42:57,380
nice weather we're having I want to fight you you want to fight I do bash his head

1268
04:43:06,500 --> 04:43:07,619
snippet three is the most powerful

1269
04:43:18,380 --> 04:43:38,540
all three uh snippets are dead save mine game booster style is this on the SNES yes it is

1270
04:43:39,419 --> 04:43:47,020
superintendent entertainment system you can get it from the little SNES mini or by some other means

1271
04:43:47,900 --> 04:43:54,540
know how take a look at boosters family portraits in order from the oldest to the youngest

1272
04:43:55,259 --> 04:44:05,939
wait can I remember this I tried to I was doing I'll go for the one on the right

1273
04:44:15,459 --> 04:44:32,860
I'm gonna level up soon here okay here we go then it was okay then I think eye patch then it's a

1274
04:44:32,860 --> 04:44:39,020
little messy for me here I think then it's sunglasses and then regular glasses and then

1275
04:44:39,020 --> 04:45:09,540
here we are that's me the elder key they gaze into each other's eyes mario she's a bit shy

1276
04:45:09,540 --> 04:45:18,250
look the other way will you you can turn around now she says she's been locked up ever since she

1277
04:45:18,250 --> 04:45:33,029
took a bite out of booster so now she wants to help us stir up a little trouble the chomp new

1278
04:45:33,029 --> 04:45:44,220
party member unlocked chomp now you get the work no you don't chomp work pants 105 damage

1279
04:45:46,500 --> 04:45:48,580
don't have any more armor for gino but it's fine

1280
04:45:49,860 --> 04:46:31,369
I did that move sorry I'm an idiot all right got the chomp new weapon browser and

1281
04:46:32,569 --> 04:46:38,409
I love the architecture of this place this is really weird and interesting

1282
04:46:43,959 --> 04:47:03,849
and this full fine all right go across this way oops it's so weird it is so weird

1283
04:47:04,810 --> 04:47:13,380
there's a primo con these things that get hundreds of damage

1284
04:47:14,340 --> 04:47:21,689
that's the other one here in my life the best part of the game is mario challenges you to a game

1285
04:47:21,689 --> 04:47:38,650
of yahtzee I know what you're talking about that is pretty interesting part so weird mid mushroom

1286
04:47:38,650 --> 04:47:56,659
good let me make these jumps what's up there check cover behind yeah frog got it nice

1287
04:47:57,619 --> 04:48:37,930
there's always something figured I would have figured really this booster wario's dad do you

1288
04:48:37,930 --> 04:48:57,830
think but we'll never know the answer to that question wario's not in this game so there's no

1289
04:48:57,830 --> 04:49:13,290
spoiler I want to get all the frog coins it's important to me hey malo reach level eight

1290
04:49:13,290 --> 04:49:31,029
without even doing anything maybe some upgrades well I may as well just pick special every time

1291
04:49:31,029 --> 04:49:39,669
because there's no way anyone's you're never gonna pick anything else ever I'm just gonna

1292
04:49:39,669 --> 04:49:49,580
do special every time because that's what you're gonna pick that's what you're doing

1293
04:49:50,139 --> 04:50:10,409
oh that was two from 38 to 40 damn it you know I still don't know um what the mechanic is in

1294
04:50:10,409 --> 04:50:21,450
this room since I was 12 I just jump to the ones that are the tan tiles and I think it works

1295
04:50:22,540 --> 04:50:38,439
that's the right w exp isn't zone you guys I'm not gonna involve you guys

1296

how do I get it wrong every single time every time room key zoom shoes oh yeah zoom shoes

1297
04:51:00,900 --> 04:51:18,259
let me take a look here 67d should I just give him to Bowser speed up by 10 huge magic defense

1298
04:51:19,220 --> 04:51:24,299
Bowser's kind of unstoppable if he's on yeah we're giving the zoom shoes to

1299
04:51:25,900 --> 04:51:33,740
zoomer ha ha funny it's like the word zoomer but it's funny ha ha zoomer

1304
04:52:26,540 --> 04:52:28,380
the rest of this game's gonna be a breeze

1305
04:52:29,259 --> 04:52:49,669

the best instead I didn't do it I ran out of bombs so long that was the joke well the joke

1320
04:58:16,520 --> 04:58:23,610
was I was thinking about leaving that on for an hour I was that whole time that I was sitting

1321
04:58:23,610 --> 04:58:29,209
there I was internally debating if me muting my microphone and going eating food downstairs

1322
04:58:30,169 --> 04:58:35,450
just getting like some like pasta or something and just eating and spend like a full hour down

1323
04:58:40,299 --> 04:58:43,979
but then I was like no I want to play I want to play this game I want to like continue to go

1324
04:58:45,259 --> 04:59:09,299

1327
04:59:35,270 --> 04:59:42,279
but now that you're here the door won't open I think we need booster's spell to undo the

1328
04:59:42,279 --> 04:59:56,970
lock on it what should we do what should we do booster's returning isn't he I know hide

1376
05:10:41,669 --> 05:10:54,470
heads I think touch the snippets or any of the barrels and you'll fall back yeah but if you jump

1377
05:10:54,470 --> 05:11:00,549
on a snippet jump on the barrel with a snippet to sprint forward and I believe every time you touch

1378
05:11:00,549 --> 05:11:07,029
toadstool you get a flower tab so it's pretty big deal like there's a really big deal I don't

1501
05:44:39,020 --> 05:44:45,900
to this for a second there's a certain noise that that flower makes when you are doing when

1502
05:44:45,900 --> 05:44:53,270
something happens oh it's you just rewind that and listen to it you don't know exactly what

1503
05:44:53,270 --> 05:44:58,380
i'm talking about blow the candles out here we go i can't speak up because it's a spoiler for the

1504
05:44:58,380 --> 05:45:00,860
game and i don't want to spoil the game but what if you've never seen it before you've played it

1505
05:45:00,860 --> 05:45:12,709
before all right this guy actually sucks i have to be careful here yeah this actually is kind

1506
05:45:12,709 --> 05:45:29,189
of hard after i yeah i'm gonna die when was last time i saved the game two hours ago that's not

1507
05:45:29,189 --> 05:45:48,340
true please get all the spells in the game have i saved all stream i don't i don't know how

1508
05:45:58,779 --> 05:46:26,819
attack up defense up and let's super jump on this cake jump on cake i just did

1509
05:46:27,540 --> 05:46:36,540
first to go down i have to pay attention this is no more messing around

1510
05:46:48,470 --> 05:46:56,950
weird how much longer am i gonna scream for i'm probably going to call it a night after this

1511
05:46:56,950 --> 05:47:05,689
town that'll take us to cleanly just about like six six six over six hours six and a half hours

1512
05:47:05,689 --> 05:47:22,310
something like that how far am i through the game i am probably just at the uh probably just about

1513
05:47:22,310 --> 05:47:32,250
the halfway point maybe another hour or two to get to like the halfway point mushroom mario

1514
05:47:33,689 --> 05:47:51,139
what does pog stand for um a pog champ it's an emote on twitch but you're gonna stop playing

1515
05:47:51,139 --> 05:47:54,340
your favorite game at six hours but you're gonna see you play the simpsons for 12

1516
05:47:55,380 --> 05:47:59,900
yeah but the difference the difference between the simpsons stream is i've never seen it before

1517
05:48:08,840 --> 05:48:17,900
plus that was a mission i was i was on a full complete mission

1518
05:48:21,080 --> 05:48:29,139
i love this game this is like when i'm dead i'm not on like a crazed mission to beat this game

1519
05:48:42,090 --> 05:48:46,409
thank goodness all right got the first part of the cake now

1520
05:48:53,020 --> 05:49:05,430
is this a better game than bloodborne uh i don't think that's fair because is this a better

1521
05:49:05,430 --> 05:49:20,009
video game than bloodborne probably not but it was maybe 20 years ago it's hard to compare

1522
05:49:20,009 --> 05:49:26,900
is this better than this even though this is 20 years old they're both very very very good

1523
05:49:29,139 --> 05:49:39,110
one of them just happens to have 20 years of technology on the other all right i need to

1524
05:49:39,830 --> 05:49:54,659
i might need to take one of these froggy drinks was 30 hp for everybody yeah i'm going for it

1525
05:49:59,799 --> 05:50:21,110
freebie good 140 that's pretty damn good here we go all right oh maybe we're out of

1526
05:50:21,750 --> 05:50:36,900

1528
05:50:48,200 --> 05:50:58,090
this thing is the cake okay everyone here's the stubborn how do we eat this i say we boil it

1529
05:50:58,810 --> 05:51:05,380
number two what do you say uh way too messy why don't you just swallow it well i didn't

1530
05:51:05,380 --> 05:51:16,819
one gulp that's easier said than done come on booster you can do it open wide my nerves are

1531
05:51:16,819 --> 05:51:23,060
shot i feel like i've forgotten to tie my cord before a bungee jump here it comes

1532
05:51:23,139 --> 05:51:35,400
so wait wait wait what did the cake just move concentrate sir this doesn't feel right

1540
05:52:59,110 --> 05:53:20,389
awesome best video game ever forgotten chrono cross is better uh that's debatable it is i i would

1541
05:53:20,389 --> 05:53:25,799
tend to disagree although there's way more characters in chrono cross the creepy guy just

1542
05:53:25,799 --> 05:53:31,779
left does that mean we can go on with our wedding oh razz i'm so happy let's get this wedding over

1550
05:55:12,500 --> 05:55:39,240
this all right let's get back to mushroom kingdom although i see how we're kind of at the halfway

1551
05:55:39,240 --> 05:55:45,700
point there's another false side of the overworld there but we still have a little little way to go

1552
05:55:46,580 --> 05:55:51,700
am i gonna do mario rpg tomorrow tomorrow the plan is terraria

1553
05:56:02,860 --> 05:56:07,979
and depending on how long we do that i may maybe we'll just transition back to play this

1554
05:56:14,150 --> 05:56:18,950
let's say we play terraria for like three four five hours and we're like all right that's it

1555
05:56:19,509 --> 05:56:29,849
maybe i'll hop back on this for an hour or two or something and you're gonna do the word problems

1556
05:56:29,849 --> 05:56:34,330
part of the game with no walkthrough word problems what do you mean word problem

1557
05:56:38,389 --> 05:56:42,680
i don't know what you mean mario welcome back you look like you're in one piece

1558
05:56:45,369 --> 05:56:52,520
princess i'm finally home and with mario and some wonderful new friends they saved my life

1559
05:56:55,110 --> 05:57:01,180
let's go find the chancellor we don't come on mario we mustn't keep the chancellor away

1560
05:57:05,240 --> 05:57:14,819
oh i know what you're talking about holy shit i forgot about that that's hell that area is

1561
05:57:14,819 --> 05:57:23,299
actual living fucking hell i love that area that's the hardest part of the whole game

1562
05:57:23,939 --> 05:57:27,700
that's the only game that actually that's the only part of the game that's a real true challenge

1563
05:57:28,259 --> 05:57:42,729
besides maybe the ship and then the last few encounters that is hard very hard

1564
05:57:46,259 --> 05:57:56,549
chancellor the princess is back thank goodness this has been a true nightmare i'm a nervous wreck

1565
05:57:57,830 --> 05:58:04,229
i know i've worried everyone but i'm fine i can take care of myself with a little help from mario

1566
05:58:06,939 --> 05:58:17,349
come everyone let's get out of this drafty door mario i hope you know how thankful we are

1567
05:58:18,919 --> 05:58:26,279
but you must tell me one thing how on earth can you trust bowser trust bowser what are you talking

1568
05:58:27,240 --> 05:58:42,569
mario what are you doing with what is going on here big gods chancellor listen everyone

1569
05:58:42,569 --> 05:58:49,180
relax mario's got things under control mario you brought bowser into the one place where you

1570
05:58:49,180 --> 05:58:58,970
have all of his enemies are yes yes i see bowser perhaps this time you told us your story

1571
05:59:00,009 --> 05:59:02,650
what exactly did you mean when you said you had bigger fish to fry

1572
05:59:05,560 --> 05:59:20,119
can't tell them the truth if this gets out i'm finished excuse me sir perhaps i can set the stage

1573
05:59:20,119 --> 05:59:26,630
and the others can add their comments along the way the princess bowser and mario were thrown in

1574
05:59:26,630 --> 05:59:31,500
different directions after a terrible explosion something huge crashed through star road high

1575
05:59:31,500 --> 05:59:51,319
above bowser's place and went boom where the fuck did mario go there was a gigantic sword now

1576
05:59:51,319 --> 05:59:57,590
bowser's keep has been taken over by monsters to work for some creep game smithy they've thrown

1577
05:59:57,590 --> 06:00:03,669
me out of my own i mean i decided to take a vacation they can't do this to me

1578
06:00:07,189 --> 06:00:13,830
anyway i was working on a plan to get my house back mario walked up to me and begged me to let

1579
06:00:13,830 --> 06:00:20,740
him join the koopa troop i had no choice but to let him in it was pathetic that's not what happened

1580
06:00:20,740 --> 06:00:28,729
no it's okay mario we know bowser's stretching the truth a little and mallet how about you why

1581
06:00:28,729 --> 06:00:35,740
are you traveling with mario well because mario is helping me find my real home and my parents

1582
06:00:36,459 --> 06:00:43,130
that's why we're on the road together what this is dreadful news awful horrible

1583
06:00:43,930 --> 06:00:51,290
i hope you find your real parents soon and um gino was it why are you and mario

1584
06:00:52,250 --> 06:00:59,779
the star road has been destroyed i'm here to fix it mario is helping me search for the star pieces

1585
06:00:59,779 --> 06:01:11,299
i need them to rebuild the road star pieces the star road grants our wishes unless we find all

1586
06:01:11,299 --> 06:01:17,819
the star pieces and fix the star road we can kiss our dreams goodbye what this is dreadful news

1587
06:01:17,819 --> 06:01:29,979
horrible isn't it indeed for example say bowser kidnapped you without the aid of the star road

1588
06:01:30,540 --> 06:01:37,479
you'd probably never be rescued actually that sounds pretty good to me let's just forget about

1589
06:01:37,479 --> 06:01:45,930
all these star things ah great bowser then you can just kiss your precious keep goodbye hey what

1590
06:01:46,810 --> 06:01:54,979
ah let's see mario can't find stars poster will be mine but i won't get my keep back and

1591
06:01:54,979 --> 06:02:00,659
wish mario finds a star so if i want to keep back i need a star thing but ah run that past me one

1592
06:02:00,659 --> 06:02:08,279
more time just ignore that idiot i just don't think i could take a word without a world without

1593
06:02:08,279 --> 06:02:17,080
wishes we need to go and find those star pieces now princess you can't be serious you're not

1594
06:02:17,080 --> 06:02:23,750
thinking of joining them are you this is sheer madness you're a princess what will people say

1595
06:02:23,750 --> 06:02:31,209
hey i don't care things seem so hopeless right now i'm tired i think i need to go lie down in my

1596
06:02:31,209 --> 06:02:48,840
room for a while mario malo gino and bowser you too look wait that's fucking mario now that

1597
06:02:49,639 --> 06:02:55,340
thanks to mario the princess is back i now declare this date to be known forever as

1598
06:02:56,540 --> 06:03:02,569
hey wait a minute you don't suppose who would have been this smithy who attacked our kingdom

1599
06:03:02,569 --> 06:03:06,889
i fear we have no cause to rejoice in fact mario we must ask you for yet another favor

1600
06:03:07,689 --> 06:03:13,319
please on behalf of all of us you must defeat smithy it is the only way we shall ever live in

1601
06:03:13,319 --> 06:03:42,520
peace again princess told stools home safe but she has decided to stay with him but sorry guys

1602
06:03:43,319 --> 06:03:58,619
it ain't gonna be like that please mario take me along with you please don't worry grandma

1603
06:03:58,619 --> 06:04:03,880
helped me through this one so no one will ever notice that i'm gone let's find us a star

1604
06:04:05,000 --> 06:04:07,720
but i wonder where it could be i have absolutely no idea do you

1605
06:04:08,840 --> 06:04:20,759
mario at times like these what should we do we should ask grandpa my grandpa should know

1606
06:04:22,020 --> 06:04:35,209
okay then let's do it just as i thought toadstool joins the party once again you want to go see how

1607
06:04:35,770 --> 06:04:55,180
how toadstool is uh pretending to be still here grandma thanks for putting up with all my selfish

1608
06:04:55,180 --> 06:05:03,110
demands don't worry princess a little invincible do you see the world it makes them friends help

1609
06:05:03,110 --> 06:05:11,849
destroy smithy just make sure nobody looks at my face mario's beside me everything's going to be

1610
06:05:11,849 --> 06:05:20,740
all right so don't worry you take care grandma you hear i feel like i'm growing younger just

1611
06:05:20,740 --> 06:05:43,819
talking with you people i thought you thought that was a skull that's all right i did i've

1612
06:05:43,819 --> 06:05:53,220
already found the question mark i did i'm gonna save it i think this is a pretty good stopping

1613
06:05:53,220 --> 06:06:06,979
point i'm gonna hang out and do the bits and the subs and stuff how long is the game probably

1614
06:06:06,979 --> 06:06:15,669
another another full stream and we'll probably do it it's probably like another seven-ish hours

1615
06:06:15,669 --> 06:06:27,130
in the game six to seven hours something like that maybe a little bit more but yeah i i love

1616
06:06:27,130 --> 06:06:37,000
this game i hope if you've never played it before then you get to see and enjoy it too

1617
06:06:37,000 --> 06:06:39,880
and those of you that have played it before remember how much fun it was

1618
06:06:40,840 --> 06:06:54,700

1619
06:06:54,700 --> 06:06:59,340
that we have not even seen yet so we'll probably see those well depending on how long we go tomorrow

1620
06:07:00,060 --> 06:07:13,590

and thank you to gnarly for the 250 two dollars and 50 cents uh i had this really weird dream

1627
06:08:25,369 --> 06:08:29,930
last night you were streaming minecraft in the middle of the day with a bunch of mods installed

1628
06:08:30,490 --> 06:08:39,590
there were no jokes gaps or even gaffs or even commentary from you you kind of just kept quiet

1629
06:08:39,669 --> 06:08:45,590
occasionally mumbling to yourself you seemed mad at one point there was a jump scare and instead

1630
06:08:45,590 --> 06:08:51,669
of reacting with a scream or a laugh you just sighed and muttered god damn it under your breath

1631
06:08:52,470 --> 06:09:11,909
i wonder if you were even aware you were streaming i will never i don't think ever have an accidental

1632
06:09:11,909 --> 06:09:21,369
stream i go through so many rituals before i press the start streaming button there's no

1633
06:09:21,369 --> 06:09:34,680
it would be impossible what do you mean rituals just i just have like rituals like routines that

1634
06:09:34,680 --> 06:09:44,680
i do before i start you have any plans to do any other rpgs i think with the voice work it's great

1635
06:09:44,680 --> 06:09:52,439
i would love to see some more chill rpg streams yeah i mean chrono trigger is one of them after

1636
06:09:52,439 --> 06:09:59,459
i uh the next stream or two of mario rpg i could do that next that's also one of those just

1637
06:10:00,759 --> 06:10:10,020
you know greatest game of all time type stuff yeah maybe i if people like this and people

1638
06:10:10,659 --> 06:10:16,330
think this is a fun stream and a relaxing chill stream i think it is it's kind of up to you guys

1639
06:10:18,970 --> 06:10:24,250
but it seems like this was fun for a lot of people tonight so i mean kind of was testing the waters

06:10:24,250 --> 06:10:41,830
tonight so we'll see but thank you too we also had lacronda gave 50 dollars before i was live

1645
06:11:26,700 --> 06:11:32,700
super mario was originally going to be called a superb mario until miyamoto convinced nintendo

1646
06:11:33,900 --> 06:11:42,150
that they should drop the b from the title really it's gonna be superb mario

1647
06:11:46,119 --> 06:11:53,240
miyamoto said convinced president of nintendo to drop the b is this is this is bullshit this

1648
06:11:53,240 --> 06:11:58,340
might be both this is bullshit isn't it superb no i'm getting it is it i mean it sounds like it

1649
06:11:58,340 --> 06:12:06,860
could be i don't know though he would adore bowser's inside story it has the same kind of

1650
06:12:06,860 --> 06:12:14,900
goofy charm not no random encounters that sounds cool why would they make that up i don't know

1651
06:12:17,639 --> 06:12:24,709
i guess it's real that's cool hey tingy thanks for the 250 you didn't even last 10 minutes

hundreds and hundreds of bits worth of dollars that's that's crazy everyone will be a sub soon

1661
06:14:19,060 --> 06:14:30,740

1662
06:14:32,619 --> 06:14:39,560
i'd be a doctor in that case can you look at that i got this like itchy thing on my back can you

1663
06:14:39,560 --> 06:14:46,459
look at it no but for real that's you've given an astronomical amount of money to the channel over

1664
06:14:46,459 --> 06:14:54,779
the last month so thank you you are responsible for hundreds of fucking subs you've given hundreds

1665
06:14:54,779 --> 06:15:03,159
and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars thank you i still cannot believe that you would

1666
06:15:03,159 --> 06:15:23,560
give that many subs there pretty much every single string thanks a lot we also had oh my goodness

1667

1669
06:15:39,099 --> 06:15:43,419
playing this game how many times have you got a perfect hit with geno world that's the real

1670
06:15:43,419 --> 06:15:52,139
ultimate gamer move as far as i'm concerned i'm not sure i don't know if i i do know like the secret

1671
06:15:52,139 --> 06:16:01,139
jokey part but i know i'm not gonna do it i'm not gonna do the joke and those of you guys that know

1672
06:16:01,139 --> 06:16:06,259
the geno world meme i'm not gonna do it this playthrough i'm gonna actually beat it right i'm

1673
06:16:06,259 --> 06:16:19,060
gonna actually beat it but yes i'm going i'm going to i'm going to beat culex on this playthrough yes

1674
06:16:23,299 --> 06:16:31,529
oh no now phylacterlish gave 18 subs to make it so they had 420 gifted subs on the channel

1675
06:16:31,529 --> 06:16:37,939
think about that think about how many how many subs that is you're responsible for 420 subscriptions

1676
06:16:47,880 --> 06:17:01,060
they have fulfilled their promise of 420 get that is true phylacterly did you did say that before

1677
06:17:01,060 --> 06:17:07,509
and you've achieved that a few different ways it's the weed number it's the weed number

1678
06:17:09,419 --> 06:17:15,020
i know it's the weed number i know i know what the weed number is and then fly for shy

20 subs and then like 80 something 90 something right from phylactery thank you for the enormous

1682
06:17:51,259 --> 06:18:15,180

but thank you both of you again hey i don't even like taco bell gave 250 thank you

1684
06:18:32,200 --> 06:18:42,119

06:18:42,119 --> 06:18:47,110
chat jerma why do you have to do the best streams when i work jerma why do i always

1686

catch your worst streams that happened both of those happened tonight and you know it we

1687
06:18:57,450 --> 06:19:15,770
we caught it earlier that's funny just pure duality but um i don't i'm sorry that

1688
06:19:16,330 --> 06:19:22,020
you streams that you want to watch are conflicting with your schedule but you can watch the vod the

1689
06:19:22,020 --> 06:19:29,340
vod and the chat will exist for at least two months it's not the same i know it's not the same

1690
06:19:29,340 --> 06:19:37,290
but it's still something thank you though thank you thank you thank you i don't even like taco

1691
06:19:37,290 --> 06:19:48,279
bell also thank you to uh pigeon for the 250 hey jerma again i'm so fucking excited to meet and

1692
06:19:48,279 --> 06:19:53,319
hang out with you at twitchcon and i never really got into this game but i played this shit out of

1693
06:19:53,319 --> 06:20:00,979
superstar saga what are your thoughts on the mario and luigi games i did i played superstar saga but

1694
06:20:00,979 --> 06:20:14,500
not the other ones in the series because there is what two three more after that something like

1695
06:20:14,500 --> 06:20:21,849
that i did superstar saga then the dream team or something something like sleeping something

1696
06:20:21,849 --> 06:20:29,369
about sleeping they sleep in one of them what's the one where they sleep superstar saga

1697
06:20:30,009 --> 06:20:43,380
the time with the moment they sleep bowser's inside story the sleep one is the newest one oh

1698
06:20:43,939 --> 06:20:55,610
luigi's dream it is dream team isn't it partners in time bowser's inside story dream team and

1699
06:20:55,689 --> 06:21:08,119
paper jam okay so there are quite a few of them but yeah i'll be at twitchcon i'll be poking around

1700
06:21:08,119 --> 06:21:14,779
i have no official meeting greets or anything so i'm kind of just going to be just kind of

1701
06:21:14,779 --> 06:21:19,990
walking around randomly i don't really do any planned real meeting greets or anything

1702
06:21:20,709 --> 06:21:31,450
like we talked about it a few times i kind of just am going to exist there but i have nothing

1703
06:21:31,450 --> 06:21:37,580
official i'm probably going to be like in a mustache and shit i'm going to be like i'm one

1704
06:21:37,580 --> 06:21:47,799
of those like i like glasses and mustaches i should be like if you find me then you get like

1705
06:21:47,799 --> 06:22:01,020
a thumbs up i'm gonna be like glasses mustache grow beard a mustache would be part of the beard

1706
06:22:01,020 --> 06:22:08,709
i guess and i guess this is the part in the stream where we get a shitload of community subs because

1707
06:22:08,709 --> 06:22:28,869
uh your boy just gave 10 20 20 came in from fly for shy and then almost 100 came in from

1708
06:22:28,869 --> 06:22:39,290
file actor elitch and then 10 now from you boy oh my goodness thank you thank you for the subs

1709
06:22:39,290 --> 06:22:46,810
thanks for the community subs guys you shock me every fucking day i said i wasn't gonna swear

1710
06:22:46,810 --> 06:22:53,500
in the mario streams i forgot how am i ever gonna get that ad friendly stream it's never gonna

1711
06:22:53,500 --> 06:23:05,529
happen might as well just forget about it now but uh thank you thank you to uh tramston for the 10

1712
06:23:05,529 --> 06:23:12,700
bucks thousand bits from uh tramston mick chicken fund this is for the mick chicken fund

1713
06:23:13,259 --> 06:23:22,419
i mean that is good that's at least three mick chickens so and then i'm going to use them for

1714
06:23:22,419 --> 06:23:32,299
that i promise thank you to the ten dollars thank you gnarly for the 250 i think it would be cool

1715
06:23:32,299 --> 06:23:37,639
to see you play a mario rpg game without prior knowledge of it like bows is inside story a lot

1716
06:23:37,639 --> 06:23:50,060
of bows is inside story fans here huh there's a lot of people that say play that one play that one

1717
06:23:50,060 --> 06:24:00,279
play is that it's it's really good it's just a really good game okay superstar saga is the

1718
06:24:00,279 --> 06:24:08,470
best one geno's in superstar saga a lot of people don't know that gino is actually in that game

1719
06:24:10,919 --> 06:24:32,200
weirdly enough it's true inside story was the best one okay i will keep that on all that knowledge

1720
06:24:32,200 --> 06:24:41,909
upstairs in the brain hey game watch thanks for the 10 bucks game watch hey jeremy i would meme

1721
06:24:42,790 --> 06:24:47,990
but today is my two year sub anniversary i love your stuff since the first raven's cry video and

1722
06:24:47,990 --> 06:24:55,189
your streams are consistently the best part of my week here's to another two years raven's cry is

1723
06:24:55,189 --> 06:25:03,819
the best worst game i've ever played i you know sometimes you wish you could just memory wipe

1724
06:25:03,819 --> 06:25:18,790
yourself and do something again that first experience in raven's cry was so funny it was

1725
06:25:18,869 --> 06:25:25,880
so awful but somehow was still worth playing just because you needed to know what was going to

1726
06:25:25,880 --> 06:25:33,430
happen next you can't be on that ship with the be brave guy and not play the rest of the game

1727
06:25:33,430 --> 06:25:42,970
at least put another few hours in how could you do that how could you get like launched across the

1728
06:25:42,970 --> 06:25:48,330
map from an animal or watch like an animal throw what i think that the was wasn't there an animal

1729
06:25:48,330 --> 06:25:55,849
throwing rocks at people there was a guy there was a there was like a rock throwing animal that

1730
06:25:55,849 --> 06:26:07,319
was whipping rocks people yeah it was it was like a monkey or something right he's just throwing

1731
06:26:07,319 --> 06:26:20,459
rocks at i wish that company would make i wanted to make another game please do i hope they made

1732
06:26:20,459 --> 06:26:27,189
enough money to make another game i said i really do i truly believe that it was worth playing it

1733
06:26:27,189 --> 06:26:34,659
was worth it i don't care how much money it was they probably don't exist anymore though

1734
06:26:34,659 --> 06:26:41,400
unfortunately but thank you game watch or game watcher for the 10 bucks here's to another two

1735
06:26:41,400 --> 06:26:53,110
years uh erdemius erdemius thanks for the 21 dollars erdemius 21 bucks coming in from erdemius

1736
06:26:53,110 --> 06:26:57,590
89 hey streamer it's my 21st birthday on monday and i wanted to thank you for all the years of

1737
06:26:57,590 --> 06:27:03,349
top tier content i wanted to know if you had any life advice from a longtime boomer to a new one

1738
06:27:05,770 --> 06:27:15,049
thanks well first thank you thanks for the 21 2100 bits happy birthday on monday which is i mean i

1739
06:27:15,049 --> 06:27:21,450
don't know if you're eastern time or what what time zone you're in but it might be monday so

1740
06:27:21,450 --> 06:27:35,000
happy birthday probably maybe right now but any of any life advice hmm let me think that's pretty

1741
06:27:35,000 --> 06:27:46,919
open-ended question i think the best advice that just general life advice i can give is everybody

1742
06:27:46,919 --> 06:27:57,479
figures it out eventually some people take longer than others i took a long time to figure it out

1743
06:27:57,479 --> 06:28:07,540
but eventually you do figure it out for the most part drink water is a good one too

1744
06:28:08,180 --> 06:28:21,020
no that actually is a great piece of general advice um replace at least one or two drinks

1745
06:28:21,020 --> 06:28:41,380
a day with a glass of water you are going to exponentially help your entire life i'm when

1746
06:28:41,380 --> 06:28:50,939
i was younger i used to just drain mountain dew code reds i didn't drink water when i was younger

1747
06:28:50,939 --> 06:29:04,729
i didn't and it's really not good for you i have since pretty much eliminated most of and this is

1748
06:29:04,729 --> 06:29:11,049
this is not i'm not going to be like i don't drink soda anymore because it's bad that's what i do

1749
06:29:11,849 --> 06:29:15,180
i just don't drink it for every single piece of liquid that goes in my body

1750
06:29:20,389 --> 06:29:25,959
i kind of was one of those people for a little while i don't know why you just you just kind of

1751
06:29:25,959 --> 06:29:31,240

soda and everyone's like where is the guy that doesn't order the coke but then i would just be

1755
06:29:54,439 --> 06:30:00,040
envious like watching everybody drink their cokes and i'm like i kind of i wish i kind of wish i had

1756
06:30:00,040 --> 06:30:00,520
one of those

1757
06:30:12,939 --> 06:30:20,299
but i drink soda sometimes i'll drink soda just if you know something you just feel like it

1758
06:30:21,259 --> 06:30:32,060
that's fine sometimes you just want to have a soda because i feel like it go for it sometimes

1759
06:30:32,060 --> 06:30:39,180
you want to eat like three double cheeseburgers from burger king do it i love every second of it

1760
06:30:40,060 --> 06:30:48,279
just don't do it every day in fact don't do that like

1761
06:30:49,080 --> 06:30:59,459
once a week in fact don't ever do that you shouldn't you should go to you should go to

1762

into a lot not just the ones that came in very recently here we had otter fiend 10 subs tonight

1793
06:36:21,349 --> 06:36:27,529
germa sucks with subs jeff with subs the fax machine with subs we touched upon them but still

1794
06:36:31,220 --> 06:36:34,659
it was a lot of community subs tonight i just want to make sure i touch on them again

1795
06:36:37,060 --> 06:36:51,159
thank you to paul manifold for the 10 dollars i like gino with a smiley thank you paul manifold

1796
06:36:51,159 --> 06:37:07,779
for the thousand bits the 10 dollars they say i'd like gino i do i do too that's the guy from

1797
06:37:07,779 --> 06:37:17,430
smash brothers um paul manifold is not in smash brothers no you're talking about gino

1798
06:37:27,029 --> 06:37:32,889
he's not and gino isn't either so that's equally as funny

1799
06:37:33,529 --> 06:37:51,419
oh you know gino is in smash as a jpg image oh i was seething i was inconsolable because it's

1800
06:37:51,419 --> 06:37:57,020
not even new artwork or new model it's just like the png from the back of the fucking super nintendo

1801
06:37:57,020 --> 06:38:02,950
box you couldn't have had any new artwork somebody could have drawn them or something commission

1802
06:38:02,950 --> 06:38:09,909
anything why does it have to be like the the super nintendo image from like the game informer poster

1803
06:38:14,779 --> 06:38:31,799
he's coping right now i am i am gino will never be in smash no he won't absolutely not it's never

1804
06:38:31,799 --> 06:38:38,939
gonna happen there's been almost two there's been like 15 years of people demanding that gino is a

1805
06:38:38,939 --> 06:38:46,939
playable character in smash brothers and it's never gonna happen they have had like three

1806
06:38:46,939 --> 06:38:54,139
opportunities with tons of square involvement yeah paul manifold actually is a higher contender

1807
06:38:54,139 --> 06:39:01,450
than gino at this point because all the every bullet point every single it all pointed to

1808
06:39:01,450 --> 06:39:15,580
gino was probably going to be in this game that's it unless they do a second season pass

1809
06:39:16,860 --> 06:39:22,860
and they just add just just fucking because they add all the characters that everybody's upset

1810
06:39:22,860 --> 06:39:27,819
aren't in the game they'll be okay this is the only way this is gonna happen the next few dlc

1811
06:39:27,819 --> 06:39:33,259
characters are gonna be big great reveals right season pass two is gonna be like the all right

1812
06:39:33,259 --> 06:39:42,900
everybody relax waluigi isaac from golden sun gino they're gonna do if they do that that's what's

1813
06:39:42,900 --> 06:39:55,700
gonna that's the only way it's gonna happen isaac is never gonna get a game you delusional idiots

1814
06:39:57,270 --> 06:40:09,750
well i was a little nicer with my take on that yeah that was very mean take i'm still holding

1815
06:40:09,750 --> 06:40:16,869
up hope the more that like somebody said earlier the more that i say it'll never happen the more

1816
06:40:16,869 --> 06:40:25,830
that it maybe would if no it won't no it's not gonna happen at this stage they would rather put

1817
06:40:25,830 --> 06:40:39,540
in anybody else it's nice to dream people said banjo would never happen and look how that turned

1818
06:40:39,540 --> 06:40:48,709
out yeah but but microsoft has really started to push its kind of collaborative efforts with the

1819
06:40:48,709 --> 06:41:04,009
other big three especially nintendo square and nintendo have a a decent relationship i guess

1820
06:41:04,810 --> 06:41:15,110
but banjo is one of those characters that is is such a huge beloved rare franchise from the

1821
06:41:15,110 --> 06:41:24,979
nintendo 64 era gino was in this game for 12 hours and then you can see him in the background

1822
06:41:24,979 --> 06:41:30,659
in superstar saga i think he's a great character i he's a great character he's really interesting

1823
06:41:30,659 --> 06:41:36,020
really cool they could have developed him a little more but banjo getting in over gino makes a lot

1824
06:41:36,020 --> 06:41:49,669
more sense they do have a gino me skin and it's hurting me nintendo is probably the reason why

1825
06:41:49,750 --> 06:41:54,200
they probably haven't done like a gino dlc or something because i have to assume

1826
06:41:56,040 --> 06:42:01,720
they're probably scared that they'll release something like that and like 112 people are

1827
06:42:01,720 --> 06:42:06,919
going to buy it because it's probably only 112 of us that actually care about this character

1828
06:42:08,630 --> 06:42:19,319
you could probably fit us all in an auditorium we we they could be like a gino we love gino convention

1829
06:42:21,209 --> 06:42:33,590
and you could fit us all on a school bus i'd be there in my gino hat in my gino shirt my

1830
06:42:33,590 --> 06:42:37,669
gino shorts my gino lunchbox and i'd be so fucking raring to go it'd be awesome

1831
06:42:39,349 --> 06:42:45,689
but way more people are going to buy the banjo dlc and i know they have the pass right but i'm

1832
06:42:45,689 --> 06:42:51,799
talking about like in years prior as well i don't know did they even do a pass for the wii you want

1833
06:42:51,799 --> 06:43:10,700
to did you buy could you buy them solo you're underestimating the size i'm just i'm i'm just

1834
06:43:10,700 --> 06:43:16,340
i'm taking the piss right now my point is there's a lot fewer people that even know who this person

1835
06:43:16,340 --> 06:43:33,580
is versus some of the more currently relevant nintendo or not characters i do love it i think

1836
06:43:33,580 --> 06:43:37,419
it's a great character i think malo is a great character i think croco is a great character i

1837
06:43:37,419 --> 06:43:43,740
think some characters you haven't even seen yet are great characters too is sans gonna be in smash

1838
06:43:45,580 --> 06:44:08,650
i don't i don't think so no i mean i i don't think that would happen he said no so he wants

1839
06:44:08,650 --> 06:44:21,669
him in he has insider information nobody tells me anything i don't know shit i am the least

1840
06:44:21,669 --> 06:44:34,759
informed person that you probably watch on twitch at least in regard i mean like in regards to like

1841
06:44:34,759 --> 06:44:44,180
video game stuff like no no no no i'm talking no i'm not talking about like video game related

1842
06:44:44,180 --> 06:44:47,700
news and information this is not i don't have any of that

1843
06:45:05,139 --> 06:45:09,560
all right but uh thank you paul manor for it for the 10 dollars i really do love gino as well

1844
06:45:11,819 --> 06:45:15,580
uh i look forward i look forward to maining you in uh smash brothers switch 2

1845
06:45:18,220 --> 06:45:22,299
hey airless thanks for the 250 jeremy elberton is my favorite broadcaster i think he's all right

1846
06:45:26,810 --> 06:45:31,610

1848
06:45:45,270 --> 06:45:52,380
make it a good one wait isn't pluto a planet again remember when everyone laughed at me

1849
06:45:52,380 --> 06:45:57,180
and talked shit to me and called me all kinds of names when i said that that was gonna happen

1850
06:45:57,900 --> 06:46:21,400
everybody remember that everybody remember that happening i do uh one day ago nasa boss

1851
06:46:22,200 --> 06:46:36,740
jokingly declares pluto a planet no no no this is the real one is pluto a planet nasa administrator

1852
06:46:37,540 --> 06:46:51,799
a nasa administrator may reignite the argument hold on i'm gonna read this whole fucking thing

1853
06:46:52,599 --> 06:47:01,779
strap in for this one in 2006 the international astronomical union caused consternation when

1854
06:47:01,779 --> 06:47:07,139
it declared that pluto was no longer a planet several bodies of similar size had been found

1855
06:47:07,139 --> 06:47:13,380
in the cupra belt so the iau created a definition that included the criterion that a planet must

1856
06:47:13,380 --> 06:47:19,380
clear the neighborhood around its orbit which pluto does not pluto was reclassified as a

1857
06:47:19,380 --> 06:47:28,709
dwarf planet a dwarf planet a dwarf planet in a move which upset anyone who grew up learning

1858
06:47:28,709 --> 06:47:40,659
about a solar system consisting of nine planets now nasa administrator jim brutenstein has

1859
06:47:40,659 --> 06:47:45,939
reignited the fierce debate of a pluto status by unexpectedly coming out in favor of it being a

1860
06:47:45,939 --> 06:47:55,580
planet just so you know in my view pluto is a planet he said in a tongue-in-cheek clip posted

1861
06:47:55,580 --> 06:48:02,069
to twitter you can write that the nasa administrator declared pluto a planet once again i'm sticking by

1862
06:48:02,069 --> 06:48:19,959
that it's the way i learned it i'm committed to it sorry link the article just type just

1864
06:48:25,639 --> 06:48:40,659
it's everywhere you got it guys there's a debate right now between is pluto a planet or not

1865
06:48:44,040 --> 06:48:48,360
a dwarf planet is a dwarf okay hold on is it remember when i said pluto is a planet and

1866
06:48:48,360 --> 06:48:53,240
everyone's like it's not a planet what is it what does it come at what comes after dwarf

1867
06:48:53,959 --> 06:49:01,049
it starts with a p i don't know what that what is it what's the word it comes after dwarf p

1868
06:49:01,049 --> 06:49:08,970
something it's a land lanet planet a planet a dwarf planet but it's not a planet though but

1869

it is tough especially when you don't know what you're doing but i do i do and they say i don't

1909
06:55:37,590 --> 06:55:41,349
know about you but i would love to see an hd remaster of this game not to say the original

1910
06:55:41,349 --> 06:55:46,229
isn't awesome but seeing these graphics in full hd would be amazing especially if the original

1911
06:55:46,229 --> 06:55:59,529
renders were used i would love that and i would also love a actual super mario rpg too that would

1912

1931
06:58:53,130 --> 06:59:07,990
pets i love frogs i love frogs of toads back in massachusetts when it was a lot it was a lot

1932
06:59:07,990 --> 06:59:15,340
wetter they were frogs and toads everywhere just randomly in the grass every time you'd see a toad

1933
06:59:15,340 --> 06:59:21,830
or frog it would just be like oh yes and walk over and just look at them and they would just be

1934
06:59:21,830 --> 06:59:34,090
staring up just like hanging out they're cute and they eat a shitload of bugs so they're awesome

1935
06:59:36,330 --> 06:59:41,930
the amount of frog the amount of bugs that the mosquitoes and flies that frogs and toads eat

1936
06:59:44,250 --> 06:59:51,209
they're helping you out they're taking care of you you just don't know it but thank you all mew and

1937
06:59:51,209 --> 07:00:04,229

1938
07:00:04,229 --> 07:00:18,169
love you germ can i pm you i do not have open pms i don't unless i'm in the discord and i do

1939
07:00:18,169 --> 07:00:26,419
this because i found over the years that it's impossible to keep up with i used to have like

1940
07:00:26,419 --> 07:00:32,900
steam friends and steam open and it can i could be added but it's just it's i'll be honest it's

1941
07:00:32,900 --> 07:00:41,740
just kind of too much for me to handle and when i actually am streaming and i actually and after

1942
07:00:41,740 --> 07:00:50,060
the streams and before streams i would rather focus on making content making streams hanging out

1943
07:00:51,740 --> 07:00:57,340
i don't really have a whole lot of time to have like open pms and just kind of talk to people

1944
07:00:58,139 --> 07:01:03,720
i do show up in the discord all the time or in pre-stream chat i'll hang out here for a couple

1945
07:01:03,720 --> 07:01:14,250
hours i was here um two days ago i was in the chat for about two three hours just hanging out

1946
07:01:14,250 --> 07:01:20,819
when i wasn't feeling good but if there is something that you want to get across to me

1947
07:01:22,680 --> 07:01:28,180
i you and it's something important right and i would put i would say important as in you know

1948
07:01:28,180 --> 07:01:34,580
use your you know common sense and due diligence to know what like would be important um then there

1949
07:01:34,580 --> 07:01:49,849
are mods that you could ping in pm and they can get the messages to me but it also kind of that

1950
07:01:49,849 --> 07:01:55,930
same type of uh way of thinking the same reason why i don't do um like reading bits and subs on

1951
07:01:55,930 --> 07:02:01,750
stream anymore i mean obviously we hang out for like an hour or so at the end of streams

1952
07:02:03,259 --> 07:02:08,060
but when i'm like in when i'm in like the mode to stream and hang out and talk and do all this stuff

1953
07:02:08,060 --> 07:02:33,939
that's what i want to do so you don't have any nudes nudes uh no but no i don't the to kind of

1954
07:02:33,939 --> 07:02:40,020
end that whole thing i don't do like open pms i don't really i the only way that i really reach

1955
07:02:40,020 --> 07:02:47,479
out to like the collective community is through discord and hanging out in the general or in

1956
07:02:47,479 --> 07:02:51,959
pre-stream unless if you want if you need to ping a mod about something that's something that you

1957
07:02:51,959 --> 07:02:56,380
think is important then we could figure it out but thank you do appreciate it thank you for the

1958
07:02:56,380 --> 07:03:06,580
ten dollars thank you thank you thank you do i yeah do i browse my own subreddit i do not all

1959
07:03:06,580 --> 07:03:16,549
the time but i do check in from time to time to see what what they're doing over there i check

1960
07:03:18,650 --> 07:03:21,930
you know sometimes i just want to know you need to know what people are saying

1961
07:03:26,069 --> 07:03:38,759
he needs when he needs an ego boost no uh thank you snoozing coffin for the 250 hey i'm going to

1962
07:03:38,759 --> 07:03:43,240
dallas for a month it's pretty exciting because it'll be the longest time i'll be on my own

1963
07:03:43,240 --> 07:03:50,520
pretty much i've only been on a plane twice i'm still anxious about planes you fly a lot now don't

1964
07:03:50,520 --> 07:03:54,840
you to la or california and back how do you deal with that were you never scared about it or did

1965
07:03:54,840 --> 07:04:00,840
you just normalize it with time and it will be exciting in a different time zone closer to the

1966
07:04:00,840 --> 07:04:08,549
normal stream times too i've flown on enough planes where it's just it's it's just a car

1967
07:04:08,549 --> 07:04:24,549
that goes in the air it's a very loud car yes flying flying used to make me nervous until i

1968
07:04:25,110 --> 07:04:34,310
realized and i thought about there are people that fly three four five six plus times a week

1969
07:04:34,869 --> 07:04:43,180
every week and they just kind of get on and get off get on get off go about their regular day

1970
07:04:46,569 --> 07:04:51,049
so the one time that i would be flying be like gosh i really don't want to get on a plane there's

1971
07:04:51,049 --> 07:04:56,169
a guy walking by me with a briefcase that that's his like six is sixth or seventh plane ride today

1972
07:04:57,139 --> 07:05:07,130
and i'm just like oh why is he seems like he's everything everything's cool all right this yeah

1973
07:05:07,130 --> 07:05:15,139
this is easy then the one thing i can't do is i can't sleep on planes no matter how much i try

1974
07:05:15,139 --> 07:05:19,860
does i could be the most exhausted in my entire life i could stay awake for two or three straight

1975
07:05:19,860 --> 07:05:32,099
days and i would not be able to sleep on the plane those are actors the guy walking around

1976
07:05:32,099 --> 07:05:36,580
with the briefcase in the airport is not he's just doing that because he wants people to think he's

1977
07:05:36,580 --> 07:05:43,349
a businessman that's what he does on his days off he just i'm gonna okay it's my day off

1978
07:05:43,990 --> 07:05:50,150
i'm gonna put a bunch of blank computer paper in a briefcase and like shuffle the papers around at

1979
07:05:50,150 --> 07:05:57,020
the terminal and like check my watch open up a laptop and look at it close it and then i

1980
07:05:59,189 --> 07:06:05,979
feels pretty good no they get paid to do that no why would anybody be paid to do that

1981
07:06:12,919 --> 07:06:21,400
he's honored by the airport to just be a guy how many of these guys are there they what they just

1982
07:06:21,400 --> 07:06:27,860
have like a hundred fake business people having an illusion of people traveling it's so people

1983
07:06:28,419 --> 07:06:41,349
like you don't get scared by planes so what about the people on the plane

1984
07:06:42,869 --> 07:06:47,189
if there's like two or three hundred people on that plane is like only four people that actually

1985
07:06:47,189 --> 07:07:13,130
bought a ticket first class is a scam to make you think you're getting a good a cheap ticket

1986
07:07:15,419 --> 07:07:21,369
so what all the people in first class it's not real and they're like oh those are like a thousand

1987
07:07:21,369 --> 07:07:28,380
dollars a seat but they're not actually used so oh good thing i'm not sitting that has two more

1988
07:07:28,380 --> 07:07:43,319
crazy mine was only 342 what a shitty fucking imagine having to like imagine having to sit

1989
07:07:43,319 --> 07:07:49,819
on an airplane and you're not even working you're not doing anything like flight attendants for

1990
07:07:49,819 --> 07:07:55,900
instance right they fly every day multiple times a day but they are they're they're they're working

1991
07:07:56,860 --> 07:08:02,139
they are at the drinks talking to passengers they're doing through safety protocols they're

1992
07:08:02,139 --> 07:08:07,419
in contact with the work crews in the luggage imagine if like you just sat in the seat and you

1993
07:08:07,419 --> 07:08:20,279
didn't you didn't do anything i would not be able to do that job what about an air marshal you have

1994
07:08:20,279 --> 07:08:27,979
an air marshal has like a specific they're like a specific task they're like security your job

1995
07:08:28,060 --> 07:08:36,409
is to just be on the airplane with an ipad in your hand i think i would lose my mind

1996
07:08:41,080 --> 07:08:51,020
you just get to watch movies on the airplane but yeah but you but that's just bring a d i guess

1997
07:08:51,020 --> 07:09:00,500
you could just bring a ds and just play the ds or like warcraft or something but but then the the

1998
07:09:00,500 --> 07:09:08,459
jig is up because wouldn't everybody do that if you were a career pretend in the airplane actor

1999
07:09:09,180 --> 07:09:13,720
they're all gonna have wow accounts and you're gonna look around as the one person that bought

2000
07:09:13,720 --> 07:09:17,799
the ticket and it's gonna be like 60 laptops people are gonna be playing wow in the same server

2001
07:09:17,799 --> 07:09:22,200
you're gonna know who that you you're sitting next to you're gonna have your own like in crew wow

2002
07:09:22,200 --> 07:09:34,220
server it's gonna look strange when you're like wait a minute i just want to get to go to the

2003
07:09:34,220 --> 07:09:40,540
bathroom and all these people in this strange all these people on this plane are in the same

2004
07:09:40,619 --> 07:09:48,169
molten core raid that's kind of odd is it is there a gaming convention going on

2005
07:09:48,169 --> 07:10:00,540
like where i'm going i've played mario kart ds multiplayer on airplanes with people well we

2006
07:10:00,540 --> 07:10:17,500
found the actor how is it is it fun all right all right all right but no planes i i take i take

2007
07:10:17,500 --> 07:10:27,819
planes all the time they can be stressful when they're long and when you can't really sleep

2008
07:10:28,810 --> 07:10:39,419
but you do get to go across ridiculous amounts of land and sea like five thousand times faster

2009
07:10:39,419 --> 07:10:44,540
than you would normally so it's kind of it's it's worth it to you know gotta go through security

2010
07:10:44,540 --> 07:10:49,180
you gotta go do all this you gotta sit on the plane who are you sitting with do you how big is

2011
07:10:49,180 --> 07:10:56,380
your seat oh fuck i'm like gotta go to the bathroom however long it is usually i anything less than

2012
07:10:56,380 --> 07:11:02,229
like three to six hours for me is i can completely handle totally fine i just wish i could sleep

2013
07:11:05,750 --> 07:11:08,869
they just changed the sets outside the airplane and it takes a couple hours

2014
07:11:09,509 --> 07:11:16,069
so what you're adding on top of this saying that you're not actually leaving the plane what does

2015
07:11:16,069 --> 07:11:20,310
plane take you so everyone gets in there there's like 150 actors and there's three people that

2016
07:11:20,310 --> 07:11:29,430
bought a ticket and they put up a gremlins to pretend outside scenery they make some noise

2017
07:11:31,560 --> 07:11:38,569
and then but how do you explain where you end up is that just down the street is that like the

2018
07:11:38,569 --> 07:11:50,150
truman show where we have like two miles of actual livable earth the entire the entire airport is

2019
07:11:50,150 --> 07:12:05,180
moving like a floating disk island you never wonder why all the trees look the same that is true why

2020
07:12:05,180 --> 07:12:10,459
the fuck do all trees look why are all trees the same you might be on to something here

2021
07:12:12,090 --> 07:12:21,369
you just go on an elevator so wait you got like seven layers of hell you just go in an elevator

2022
07:12:21,369 --> 07:12:32,060
you go to like layer one and that's like what like simpson addy layer two is like i don't know boston

2023
07:12:32,060 --> 07:12:56,119
new york layer three which is like in different layers of the crust just different classic wow

2024
07:12:56,119 --> 07:13:17,479
layers i love this it's so stupid all right let's get out here birds aren't real either

2025
07:13:20,860 --> 07:13:27,060
all right i'm done oh we gotta move on i'm going to bed thank you wolfgang for the five dollars

2026
07:13:28,409 --> 07:13:34,939
say you should have gone for the head in mickey mouse oh you should have gone for the head don't

2027
07:13:34,939 --> 07:13:56,169

2028
07:13:56,169 --> 07:14:00,779
