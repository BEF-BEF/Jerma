1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,790
Alright, now I'm gonna change the title. What's it? What should I change the title to? This is a From Software game, by the way.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,820
Everyone that's gonna go, what? What? Wait, this is From Software? Yeah, From Software.

3
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:16,440
Here's how From Software was a part of this game. I think like two people walked into the office of the

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,420
people making this game, from From Software, and like drank out of the water cooler and looked at

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,870
what they were making and said, yeah, that looks alright. I don't think they had very much to do

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:39,109
with this. Maybe they did. Alright, Metal Wolf Chaos. I need a title though. Title, Metal Wolf Chaos.

7
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:54,649
From Software made this. Please click. Metal Wolf Boppin'. I like that. Metal Wolf Boppin' brackets.

8
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:59,530
From Software made this. Did you know that? Click my stream. Please watch the whole thing.

9
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:05,879
I like Metal Wolf Boppin'. Now this one, people said I was gonna really like this.

10
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:20,280
What do you think? Am I gonna like this? This is like a mech kind of jump around and

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,379
shooter game. This is gonna be loud. I gotta protect you guys ears for a second. Hold on.

12
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:43,530
I'm late to play this game. I'm late to play every game. The only games that I've ever played on

13
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,250
release have been the From Software games. Fuck, you're right. I should have played this like two

14
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:57,420
weeks ago. From Software presents. Hold on. Yeah, I play every From Software game at launch

15
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:05,900
and I didn't play this. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I can't see it. We can't see it. There

16
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:47,139
we go. What? Let's party. Let's party. Good sneaking job. Do I just pick it up right now?

17
00:02:47,139 --> 00:03:06,550
Play now? I guess not. Yeah, I'm gonna turn this up a little.

18
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,919
I don't have any idea what's going on. I know that this is just constant conflict. That's it.

19
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,800
Do you really need to know anything else? Or just constant conflict. That's it. And just hold down

20
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,360
left mouse button.

21
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:53,800
All right. I'm the president?

22
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:06,939
Believe in your own justice. Metal Wolf Chaos by From Software.

23
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:14,710
Welcome. We got to work on this for a second though. Hold on. Graphics. Quality. Get that out

24
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:24,230
of here. Get that off. Quality high. Use those settings. Um, display. This is important because

25
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,870
this is full screen. It's not full screen. I'm already tough. We already got, I think this is

26
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:34,649
a 30 FPS game. Should I do controller? I think I'm gonna just, no, I'll do mouse. It's probably

27
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:51,110
easier to aim. Keybinding sound. Music volume. Nobody wants to listen to this. Voice volume.

28
00:04:51,110 --> 00:05:02,730
Keep that up. You do. I didn't think you did. It was designed with the original Xbox in mind.

29
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:21,480
Bust that out. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm, yeah. I'm into it. Hold on. Dude. Hold on. Dude. No, I know.

30
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:28,250
I'm gonna stick with the mouse for now. If I hate it, I'll switch and you'll tell. You'll be able

31
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,170
to tell because I'll be like, this is stupid. That's not even fun. It's not even fun to control

32
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,209
this stupid game. That's like, it's just not even fun. Like when I do that, you know that's real.

33
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:48,310
Put voice on max. Sure. I want to take the volume of the music down. I don't like when music is

34
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,720
playing in my ears. I know some of you Sonic the Hedgehog fans are gonna be really mad about this.

35
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:02,649
All right. Let's take a look at the keybindings. I'm not, there's probably not gonna be much of

36
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:09,560
a tutorial. Jump boost. Yeah. Left shift. Change weapons. Middle mouse. Left mouse. Right mouse.

37
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:20,939
WSAD. Taunt is T. Burst attack. Um hmm. Burst attack. Stomp. We'll do, well I'll change that.

38
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,639
Burst attack with this. Stomp will be this mouse. All right. This seems easy enough.

39
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:36,490
Yeah. Let's go. I do have a gamer mouse. I have a Razor Deathadder because it's the only mouse

40
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:50,279
that is big enough to my big fucking wide palms. All right. Here we go. New game. Sellout. No,

41
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,720
no, no. I don't, I don't think anything else from Razor is worth buying. I think I've already

42
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:08,120
talked about this already. All right. Here we go. By the end of the first quarter of the 21st century.

43
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,160
I do that all the time. Of course the speedy boy says it. Freedom was dead in America beginning

44
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,879
with a large scale military coup d'etat that erupted in various cities throughout the nation.

45
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:25,819
The rebels seized power in all the central institutions of government. The entire nation

46
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:32,540
appeared to have fallen completely into the hands of the coup d'etat forces. However, one final hope

47
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:39,339
in opposing the coup d'etat forces remain. This final hope being the U.S. president himself.

48
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:46,540
Michael Wilson, the 47th president of the United States, equipped with a special mobile armored

49
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:53,180
op suit developed in secret by the military, boldly waged his own personal war alone

50
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,259
to take back America's freedom. I do appreciate the like 12k audio bit, right?

51
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,720
Get out my special op suit, Jody. That's back in the day when it used to be looks like CD

52
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,220
quality from the drop down in your windows menu. This kind of party is a first for me.

53
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:27,589
Mr. President, you're going to burst through the door.

54
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,340
All right. The people outside are really scary. Mr. President, Mr. President,

55
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,139
escape via the Eagle Star in the underground base. Now I'll open the entryway to the underground

56
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:49,269
base. Please give your guests some face time with her and she. How much damn, what's my health bar?

57
00:08:49,269 --> 00:09:06,759
Oh, shit. All right. Where am I going? Do I have any other weapons or just that shotgun?

58
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:22,759
Oh, I know my right click. So is it auto aimed during the square? I think it is. It seems like

59
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:46,740
it. That square is huge. It is sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. President. Enter the underground

60
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:53,620
base using this oversized back door here. You got it. I'm on my way. I wish I could voice

61
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,940
this. You've got it, Judy. I'm making my way down through it.

62
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,690
The enemy are just lowly foot soldiers. Even at you in fire, they're no longer a special heavy

63
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:20,330
mobile armor. Anything you say, Judy. That'd be good. I'll be back. I'll be back. Better.

64
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,899
How long does that boost go? The Eagle Star is beyond here. Get going before the enemy chases

65
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:36,059
after you. Whoa, what the hell was that? While destroying anything that stands in your way.

66
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:40,379
Switching over your weapons, depending on the situation, is the main key to fighting.

67
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:43,500
Try out the weapons in your backpack as you like. How do I select them?

68
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Is there like a way to move up and down on them?

69
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:55,500
Current, current, current. Do I change them?

70
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,740
Scroll. Yeah, scroll on. I'm trying to scroll. It doesn't do anything.

71
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:20,279
You click. Middle mouse opens it and then scrolling doesn't do anything. I don't have

72
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,320
access to anything. Oh, there we go. There we go. You actually just have to... Okay, I get it.

73
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,039
You have to click left and right mouse.

74
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:45,159
All right, nice. I'm ready. I kind of want to speed up the turn.

75
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,960
There's an aircraft hangar beyond this passageway. Now, let's hurry. The aircraft

76
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,080
hangar is behind the barrier. I'll open the barrier now. Please wait a moment.

77
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:01,500
Let's just target the tiger. Just waiting for an air break.

78
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,220
Whoa, something quite dangerous awaits, but with missiles of that caliber,

79
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,179
if you aim and fire, you should be able to easily shoot them down.

80
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:19,830
Yeah, if you aim and fire. Oh, there's that FromSoftware dodge that I like.

81
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:35,850
That's it? Oh, I'm hitting the grail in front. Nice.

82
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:51,940
Enemy's behind. Where? Watch out! Rocket launcher kind of sucks.

83
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,740
If it hits the guardrail, it doesn't hurt.

84
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,480
Okay.

85
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,919
Guard, grail.

86
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:46,409
Air Force One, protected. I like it. What else we got? Up in the top?

87
00:13:47,370 --> 00:14:01,929
Can I remove the HUD? You're not going to touch here. I'm going to get an S-ray for this one.

88
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:10,019
Anybody else? No. I'm good.

89
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:36,409
Oh, what? Oh, no, he got it off. That one guy saved whatever they're fighting.

90
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,519
I don't even know who's fighting. Who am I fighting?

91
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:41,080
Welcome to Air Force One.

92
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,519
What is this? Is this like, what invasion? I don't even know who I'm fighting.

93
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,779
Oh, that's right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

94
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:05,269
What? Oh.

95
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:18,580
Like they were ever invited, they're definitely Michael.

96
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:35,580
Mr. President, it looks like this party is just getting started.

97
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:51,220
D. All right. E. C. Rush combo points. What's that mean?

98
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:59,509
Display KO point details. That's what I'm going to see.

99
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:24,139
Who believed in his own justice even when it seemed the whole country had turned against him.

100
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,539
DNN correspondent Peter McDonald.

101
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,690
I feel like this is part of that dream game.

102
00:16:52,889 --> 00:17:24,180
I can't make it. I have to save America. We'll have to do dinner on Tuesday instead.

103
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:41,289
Mr. President, to my beloved fellow Americans. Good evening. This is an announcement from the

104
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:47,690
government policy promotion department, your American justice and freedom supporter.

105
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,970
First of all, what I would like to tell each and every one of you is this.

106
00:17:53,930 --> 00:18:01,529
Recent events were not a mere coup d'etat, but rather a revolution to correct the wrongs

107
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:09,130
in the United States of America. To our regret, our nation is in a crisis situation.

108
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,970
Since 2010, domestic terrorism problems have increased rapidly.

109
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:20,009
Economic disputes originating from the exhaustion of fossil fuels

110
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:25,849
and the sudden rise in unemployment due to the influx of large scale immigration.

111
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:33,130
Neither the current president nor the American government took actions to address these various

112
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:40,170
problems. On the contrary, they have filled their own pockets adhering to terrorist cells.

113
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:49,690
To correct this situation, Richard Hawk, Arizona insurrection hero and vice president of the

114
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:59,450
old government and the U.S. military rose to the task at hand. Much like our ancestors did

115
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:06,329
based in a belief of winning freedom and based in the belief of an independent war

116
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:17,849
and based in the belief in this great nation. However, to our regret, an evil to disobey this

117
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:26,170
belief exists in the United States of America too. And here is that evil.

118
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:33,450
Currently donning this XB88 battlesuit. Who first appeared in Washington and began his

119
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:42,859
unjust rampage goes by the alias Metal Wolf. His current whereabouts are unknown.

120
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,380
While all of America will be under martial law until Metal Wolf is caught, please

121
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:58,299
do not confuse the issues at hand. Without fail, the U.S. military elite forces with a combined

122
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:08,940
strength of 1.5 million promise to smash this unforgivable evil to pieces. This has been an

123
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:16,059
announcement from the government policy promotion department. Your special remedy for all kinds of

124
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:30,329
evil. Evil. All right. White House. Reach Air Force One. We did it. Now we have San Francisco.

125
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:36,500
So we're getting getting attacked in San Francisco. All right. Economy. Technology.

126
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:45,799
Energy pod. What does this mean? All right. We go here. Should object to targets. Is this all

127
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:51,720
I can do now? Anything else? I guess we're going here. The Cudito Army that occupies

128
00:20:51,720 --> 00:21:06,119
Francisco still runs rampages as the base of their military activities are built around the town.

129
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:13,819
Okay. Target areas where enemy forces are concentrated are dangerous, but you can weaken

130
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:29,180
their moration of San Francisco shine as a beacon of hope. I think they literally got this voice

131
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,740
to speak over the phone. What's the call name?

132
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,769
Okay. Got to have a drum roll.

133
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:50,710
Here we go. All right. Ooh, you actually get to make your own

134
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,549
loadout. That's cool. All right. Equipment. How much money do I have? Total money. 15,210.

135
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:03,380
All right. Develop. Fund and research. Fund research and develop new weaponry.

136
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:19,559
Investment. Fund weapon research. Manufacture. What is this? Single bazooka? Oh yeah, I think so.

137
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:31,029
Development level zero. Development costs 11,000. I have this. Oh, but what do I want the next one?

138
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:43,660
Okay. Missile launchers. Tracking capabilities. Grenade launchers, sniper cannons, rail guns,

139
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:53,740
multi-missile launchers, flamethrowers. I want a flamethrower. Yes. So this is now available

140
00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:06,470
for development. Okay. So I can have an FLT 350. Nice. Okay. So now manufacturer. Flamethrower is

141
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:22,460
is shit. Rare metal required. How much do I have? Insufficient money. Damn it. Okay. It's all right.

142
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:31,690
I'll be able to do that next. All right. Equip. Shotgun. No, this is fine. This is like level two.

143
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:42,500
It's all right. Oh no. Mr. President, you left the office with a briefcase full of hundreds and

144
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:54,339
that's it. You only had 15 grand. What are you going to do now? Enemy list now. All right. Let's

145
00:23:54,339 --> 00:24:33,799
go. Start. Meanwhile, in the skies above San Francisco. Mr. President, how's the sky?

146
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:44,940
Okay. Talk like you're in the wind. The correct direction there is there's a loud vacuum cleaner

147
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,500
and you're trying to have a conversation. The gentleman in me goes off the clock

148
00:24:49,500 --> 00:25:05,380
at five p.m. Take America back. Here we go. Place the enemy army by destroying the target areas

149
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,339
where the troops have amassed. Destroy all the target areas. Give me. No. Give me. I want the

150
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:14,740
rocket launcher on this. I'm a sniper. All right. And then I want the rocket launcher here. Got it.

151
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:45,079
Or how about bazookas? All right. Give me. I want something better on here. Yeah. I want this.

152
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:49,720
And then give me this rocket. All right. We're going to stay with this thing. All right. Here we go.

153
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:04,900
What's this? Oh. Ammo. You need to string the chain to get it, right?

154
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:21,109
Hello? Oh. You have buildings. Okay. Anybody else? I think that's it. No? Dead.

155
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:38,839
Destroy the cage with light firearms and rescue the people inside. This is light, right?

156
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:55,140
Scientists. All right. So save the people in the cases and give it to the bad guys.

157
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:12,279
Let me get. Oh, I mean, they're on it. I want a copter.

158
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:47,160
Okay. I got to get a bazooka here. Hit. Hit. I'm definitely doing missiles. Missiles only.

159
00:27:53,539 --> 00:28:02,630
I want to double. I want missiles on either hand. Heavy arms ammo. What's that? Shield unit.

160
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:15,960
Cool. Should I do double flamethrower? Just glide around to flamethrower? I think that sounds

161
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:32,789
like fun. No, don't. Okay. I blew it up. I didn't mean to. But it happened. No. Shit.

162
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:57,210
What's that? MP7. No, that's fine. Let's go this way. She told. I thought I told you.

163
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:10,279
Don't do that. All right. Let me try to get like a 20 or 30 chain here.

164
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,930
There's got to be more people on the screen if you get a better chain.

165
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:54,150
I missed Lou. I'll get it. I'll get it. Come on. Bonus rare metal. I should be blowing up all

166
00:29:54,150 --> 00:30:08,569
this shit, right? What did I do? I missed something here. There. Shield unit.

167
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:30,279
You can break stuff by dashing through it. That's good to know. Thank you so much for telling me

168
00:30:30,279 --> 00:31:10,380
that. Whoa. Are there bosses in this game? Yeah, there are. No, I know. I'll take care of it.

169
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:29,980
Can you shoot two things at the same time? Yes. Oh shit. I'm out of ammo. Uh oh. I'm at 49. That's

170
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:54,359
enough, right? I just hit the damn sign here. Don't ask chat. 99% have never seen the game before.

171
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah, but some people have. There's like one person here that's played this whole game

172
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:11,210
and has S ranking on every level. Oh shit. Where's my health bar? Is it the top right?

173
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:46,359
That like teal bar on the top right? No item? We failed. Left. Oh shit. You're right.

174
00:32:47,400 --> 00:33:06,619
What does it say? Nice. M939. Nice. What does it say? Nice. What's the bopping for in the title?

175
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:15,799
Uh, I can't really explain it. The first hour of the stream will explain why the title is

176
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:29,299
metal. Metal gear bopping. Whatever this is. It's, you know, like roll my hand and

177
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:33,700
spin it around a few times and slap my wrist back and forth. Put my finger and my palm up

178
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,940
to my mouth. Lean forward and say you got to be there. You know that thing that I do?

179
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:05,509
What? How would I successfully explain what bopping is? I can't. How would I do that? It's

180
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:26,619
not possible. I want to use those. Bad. Look at all that. Look at all those yellow circles.

181
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:37,849
Come on. I got to keep it going. Chain. Chain. Chain. I'm going to get it.

182
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:48,010
Oh, but by the way, I didn't really talk about what's happening tomorrow.

183
00:34:49,260 --> 00:35:06,780
Tomorrow? Wait. Target? What? Destroy all this stuff? Oh, that gets the building.

184
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:29,110
I'm getting like a real bad, like, lady is drunk vibe. Ooh, look at this. Take out the support beam.

185
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,699
I need more than just this rocket launcher if I'm going to do this.

186
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:46,090
Oh, anyways. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. So tomorrow, I have bought an Xbox 360 for one

187
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:52,409
reason. I bought the old, not the Kinect, the thing that came before the Kinect. It only was

188
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:59,530
available for like two games. It's the Xbox Live Vision Camera. And it's called You're in the Movies.

189
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:03,769
Not the U-Star one. This is before U-Star. This is the first one.

190
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:09,320
So it's going to be a fucked up screen tomorrow, I can guarantee you that.

191
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:19,880
Press F for you. Super. That's not, I pressed, you got me to press F. Is there a better way I can do

192
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:35,579
this? I feel like this is, oh no, I'm out of ammo. Missile alert. Oh, you weren't lying. Missile

193
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:46,809
alert. Missile alert. Where did it go? Oh, okay. Right, right, right, right. Okay, I get you.

194
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:58,650
Yeah, that's tomorrow. Tomorrow's, tomorrow's Terraria. No, Terraria is going to move to Sunday.

195
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:06,460
We're destroying the area. Tomorrow is Xbox 360. Green screen, fuck face stream.

196
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:28,679
All right, here we go. I don't, what about ammo? Drunk. I can't hurt this. I need something better

197
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:40,139
than that. What's going on? Am I sniping? Why am I standing still? Stop, stop. I don't want to stand

198
00:37:40,139 --> 00:38:06,460
still. How do I get out? I don't want to be sniping. Mr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President.

199
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:16,139
Snake, yeah. Oh no, I don't want to do this again. Fuck. Oh my God. What the hell. All right, I,

200
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:23,849
no, I don't know. I don't know, I had the sniper out before and it didn't zoom in. I couldn't get it

201
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:42,860
off. I tried to take off the sniper and it wouldn't do anything. He didn't light the bonfire. No,

202
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:55,449
it didn't. All right, let's just go. I don't, I don't need to destroy these.

203
00:38:58,309 --> 00:39:08,340
I know where I'm going. This is a bootleg armored core. Here's the funny thing about that. Made,

204
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:19,400
this is the same com- Prime software actually made this. Don't walk into the front of me.

205
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:30,710
I want to get a better weapon though. This is, the shotgun's fine on here, but I need the, yeah,

206
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:58,380
the ammo. No, and I didn't. I know what they are. I don't want to use that much of this though,

207
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:07,780
because I need it later for that tank. Mr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President.

208
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:15,719
Mr. President. Happy, sad, excited. Say it all different ways.

209
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,719
Give me your best. I'm sad, Mr. President. Now give me your best. I'm happy, Mr. President.

210
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:49,980
I'm on it. Michigan report from hell. That game was insane.

211
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:08,150
Michigan report from hell was, because I had to play that on like a weird emulator because it

212
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:12,630
wasn't localized. That was a Japanese game, right? I don't think that even released in the United

213
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:30,489
States. We're going quicker this time. EU. Yeah, but that's a PAL console. I didn't have a PAL

214
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:55,000
console. Make sure to use your rush from the circle was flashing. I'll give it a try.

215
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:17,059
Why? Wait, let me save these people. No items dropped. Got it. That is actually really,

216
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:25,210
really effective. Somebody said I can't tell the scale of anything in this game.

217
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:45,699
It's just a lot of running, shooting, sprinting, dashing. How big am I? Am I just a guy in kind

218
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:48,340
of fallout armor? I'm not supposed to be like a hundred feet tall, right?

219
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:06,019
What? Which one is it? You're supposed to be five, seven. Nice. That's pretty big.

220
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:24,949
Shut up. Shut up. I think you're a five, seven in this game.

221
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:34,519
I don't know. Let's look at the official documentation of the game manual.

222
00:43:41,639 --> 00:44:08,760
Imagine being short and actually being a dick. I got you. No bullets. All right. No, no, no,

223
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:14,699
I don't want to waste these. Here we go. Nope. After this, it comes a tank and then I'll take

224
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:38,300
care of it. I got the... No, this is an epic building. The boomer is fuming. It's bad after

225
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,219
all those boomer comics because I know what it's like to fucking roll out of bed with my back hurt

226
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:47,980
because I slept on it wrong for like an hour. You'll know. You'll see. You'll see.

227
00:44:52,260 --> 00:45:14,139
Ah, that's it, right? Is there more down here? Defensive argument? No, augment. Defensive

228
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:23,420
streamer. Something like that. Something like that. Light-armed ammo. Okay, is there anymore?

229
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:43,989
Did I miss ammo back here? Whatever. There was something back here. No, there wasn't. I'm

230
00:45:43,989 --> 00:45:57,019
getting jibbed. Don't ban us. Why would I ban you? What have I happened to scare Saturdays? Scare

231
00:45:57,019 --> 00:46:28,070
Saturday. Let's go. Let's get in close. Go! Come on. Bring it down. This is fucking weird.

232
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:34,809
What do you mean it's weird? What's wrong? What's the difference? This is a mech game.

233
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:54,250
What do you mean it's weird? This game is weird. Bring it down. Come on. I mean, I guess it is weird.

234
00:46:54,250 --> 00:47:08,570
You're right. All right, now this is where I gotta be careful because I'm not gonna screw this up

235
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:30,010
again. Get rid of the tank. Here it comes. Here we go. Gotta watch that explosion. I feel like

236
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:39,300
she's talking to me like I'm sick. Make junk food out of him. Turn him into, turn him into,

237
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,519
turn him into a chicken nugget. Is he gonna? Bam. No, I'm not.

238
00:47:52,099 --> 00:48:05,210
What? Is he vulnerable somewhere? This game's really weird. This game's not that weird.

239
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:12,010
What is so weird about this game? Stop it. Oh, it's a weird game, huh?

240
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:28,250
Why? It's like a mech shooter. Why is it so weird? This game's weird. What a fucking weird game.

241
00:48:30,389 --> 00:49:01,219
Okay, I don't want to lose again. So, okay, I'm good. Are they even reaching? Shoot it in the gun.

242
00:49:01,219 --> 00:49:13,239
Right in the gun. Yeah, I gotta hit it right in the gun. Ah! I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

243
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:18,519
I'm not dead. Am I? Oh my god. Why? What happened? What? Why did I just lose instantly? What

244
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:30,780
happened? What happened? I don't understand. Is it missiles? I have to do this whole thing again.

245
00:49:48,809 --> 00:50:05,530
What a weird game. Play the Shire thing. I gotta pee. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I need to upgrade.

246
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:09,940
Fuck. I shouldn't have bought the flamethrower. This is a mistake. I gotta upgrade. You're not

247
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,940
supposed to win there. You're supposed to listen to the From Software game. I just walked up to

248
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:18,340
like the third boss. I had to get souls and upgrade my guy. I have to upgrade my, go to

249
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,780
my garage and upgrade my character. That's just what it is. All right, I'm gonna pee. I'll be right

250
00:50:21,780 --> 00:53:18,170
back. Dude, did I seriously pick the flamethrower, which is expensive and I screwed everything up?

251
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:24,650
I played a From Software game and I put like six points into faith

252
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,849
in the very beginning of the game. What the hell did I do that for?

253
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:48,659
All right. Let's get this fresh beer open. Ooh. All right. Develop. Can I do anything else?

254
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:57,159
Manufacture. Like a new shield. I should have, I should have manufactured one of these.

255
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,159
Missile launchers, grenade launchers, sniper guns, rail guns. I need to just do explosives.

256
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:14,730
Like grenade launcher or something. Damn it. Why did I pick flamethrower? Why'd you guys let me do

257
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:27,659
this? Just redo the first level? I can do that. Oh, I can do that. I can do that. You're right.

258
00:54:28,539 --> 00:54:36,489
I can do that. Oh my God. You're right. I can do this. Yeah. All right. From Software. Let's go.

259
00:54:46,340 --> 00:55:04,280
Get out my special ops suit, Jody. All right. Yeah, I'm ready. Give me like a 30 chain.

260
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:12,699
100 chain. Get some money and then I'm going to upgrade my missile launchers.

261
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:25,719
Already grinding on the first level. Kind of, but not really. I would call this a mini grind.

262
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:30,679
This is not a real grind. Oh, by the way, I didn't talk about this too. At some point after the

263
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:37,340
carnival stream. I'm not going to do it yet, but it's going to happen at some point in September.

264
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:44,739
Uh, I'm going to be pulling the streams back. Start time by about an hour.

265
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:51,590
I'm going to be starting my screens somewhere around this time.

266
00:55:56,179 --> 00:56:00,360
Like between like, well, not now. I mean like, you know, a couple hours ago.

267
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:11,340
And the reason for that is because my streams have been going much more than like four hours

268
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:15,739
like they ever used to. Before I moved to Vegas, my streams were like four to five hours long.

269
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:22,699
They're starting to become six, seven, eight hours long, more than half the time, I'd say.

270
00:56:23,739 --> 00:56:26,940
And what ends up happening is if I start my stream at three or four o'clock in the afternoon,

271
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:34,460
after that, like six, seven, eight hour period, it starts to become like two, three, four, five

272
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:46,900
o'clock in the morning Eastern. And who God knows how long. So I've decided that I don't

273
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:58,539
want to have my streams because they've been going late. They have them. That's kind of the theory

274
00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:04,440
because it used to be, you know, I'd started like seven o'clock Eastern and my streams would end at

275
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:15,050
like 11 or 12 Eastern. They didn't go for that long. I have, holy shit. I'm going to get like

276
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:21,750
a good lot of points for this. I forgot to move. I need 250. All right. I'm good. Let's go.

277
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:40,599
That was one of the things I want to talk about though. Keep the train going at 265.

278
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,639
This mission is so short, so it'll be fine.

279
00:57:58,659 --> 00:58:05,300
I also have this thing. I'm going to use it, but I think it's better for everybody.

280
00:58:06,099 --> 00:58:13,699
Beyond this passageway. Now let's hurry being on Pacific time is as far back as I could possibly

281
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:46,730
be. Come on. Come on. Did I go too fast? I guess I could be in Hawaii and I can notice when, you

282
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:53,739
know, when people started to get tired and it's to be one, two, three, every stream in the last

283
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:59,579
few months for pretty much, I think like 80% of every stream has gone to like at least two or

284
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:10,340
three a.m. Eastern. I never used to do that before I moved here. I would much rather have

285
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:31,110
the streams end around 11, 12 Eastern than be still chugging along. I'm going to get money for

286
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:40,860
this. Put it into my missile launches from September. Yeah. I want enough time for people

287
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,539
to know that that's going to happen. I don't want to just start like today is kind of just

288
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:50,329
I'm just seeing how I like it. I would have started at like three or four, but I'm just

289
00:59:50,329 --> 00:59:55,289
trying to see how much I like doing this. I'm going to do it a few times, but officially I'm

290
00:59:55,289 --> 01:00:01,019
not going to say that yet. Probably after the carnival stream is when it'll be officially my

291
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:08,920
stream will be pulled back like two hours because it's easy for me to be like, yeah, as of today,

292
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:18,389
I streams are not going to start at 12, but that's not a reality. All right. How much money do I get?

293
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:32,230
Two air force one. So stream length will be the same. Just where it will be there,

294
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:43,179
what period will be an S rank. That's an A rush. What is this rush combo? That's really bringing

295
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:55,619
me down. That's fucking up my whole GPA. Well, that's how you get that's $69,000. That's so

296
01:00:55,619 --> 01:01:01,340
I'm I did it correct this time. You have to be dashing. All right, let's go to the garage.

297
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:16,780
The coup d'etat. I'm ready. Develop. Here we go. Manufacture. Let's get that flame throw.

298
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:35,539
All right, let's get it. Develop this weapon. Yeah, I have one of them now. All right. Investment

299
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:41,619
handguns. Where are we going? We want multi-missile launchers, rail guns, sniper cannons,

300
01:01:41,619 --> 01:01:52,469
grenade missile launchers. Develop. The ML-60ST is now available for development. Do it again.

301
01:01:52,469 --> 01:02:01,780
How much is that? Do it again. Oh, the gold VE is now available. All right, I got 30 grand.

302
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:11,019
Let's try. Let's get some of these. ML. The ML-6ST ham. Let's go to the manufacturer.

303
01:02:11,739 --> 01:02:20,070
Let's see. Firepower 1160. No, no, no, no, no. I want to look at it. Basic missile launcher

304
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:26,070
offers a balanced set of capabilities. Fires missiles vertically. Specialized tracking capability.

305
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:40,550
Lock-on speed F. Guidance system S. Range S. 1060. This one's just better. I'll get it. I'll try it.

306
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:52,380
I want this one too, though. Grenade launchers that don't have any. I definitely want more of

307
01:02:52,380 --> 01:03:04,199
these. Where are they? I want two of these. What? I need active research in here to be able to do

308
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:13,690
this. Machine guns. How much is it? Let me go investment. 10,000. Let's just see. Let's get

309
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:21,349
something. MP7 is now available. I can't make it, though. All right. That should be all right,

310
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:39,269
though. Let's go to equip. The handgun is all right, but flamethrower. No, I can, I can,

311
01:03:39,269 --> 01:03:45,369
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I can have another weapon here. Okay. That's cool. Where's my

312
01:03:45,369 --> 01:03:57,619
flamethrower? Get that on there. Oh, it has to be both hands. That's annoying. Well, the sniper

313
01:03:57,619 --> 01:04:06,650
rifle is stupid. It's not good. I don't want it. Let's do, uh, this one and then the ham.

314
01:04:07,449 --> 01:04:18,300
Okay. Shotgun pistol. That's easy. These two are fine. And then I definitely want to be able to

315
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:23,989
have at least, yeah, these two. That's good. All right. Let's see if I can do any better this time

316
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:47,909
and not lose at the last boss instantly. Save it. Go. No, I'm messing around. I want to test

317
01:04:47,909 --> 01:05:05,739
them out, though. Here's this. Here's this. Let's set the flamethrower first. Am I, where, am I

318
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:24,699
reloading it? Is it using the boost, too? That's not good. It uses the boost, so I can't speed

319
01:05:24,699 --> 01:05:47,510
down the road and do it. Use the boost to get through it. I'll try. Move out of the way.

320
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:56,619
Let's do, let's do shotgun for this. Right in the beginning here, it's really not a big deal. I

321
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:04,940
can just get through this. Once the towers become a thing. That's when I move on to the rocket

322
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:29,110
monsters. I also want to talk about the highlights activity book stream. I had the, I brought the

323
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:34,070
mods together and we talked about it for a while. And it should be interesting. Don't, I'm not ready

324
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:38,469
to give any dates or anything right this second. I want to, but by the end of this weekend, you'll

325
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:43,989
have a real kind of plan and date on how that's going to play out. All right, let's give me the

326
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:54,360
hand and test the hand. This is so much better. Having two missile launchers is a thousand times

327
01:06:54,360 --> 01:07:08,900
easier to take these things out. Weird, this is a weird stream.

328
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:30,739
I think this changes everything. How many bullets do I have? I have 50. That's all right.

329
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:39,269
There's also a stomp. That's right. There is a stomp. Oh shit, I totally forgot about that.

330
01:07:54,070 --> 01:08:01,219
This stream is quirky. Would you get, you wouldn't classify me as a quirky streamer, right?

331
01:08:01,539 --> 01:08:25,380
What did you guys say? A musician? What does that mean? You get what you think I'm a quirky

332
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:32,550
streamer? I don't think so. I think I'm more of an intelligent streamer. Like when you, when you

333
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:39,260
turn the stream on, you know that you're going to get some really, really just smart things.

334
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,699
Intelligent, smart, like discussion.

335
01:08:42,699 --> 01:09:06,899
As I don't know now where to go. I was too good. I cleared it too quickly. It's down here right

336
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:18,630
here. He says that as he plays the video game equipment, smashing toys together and making

337
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:39,779
explosions sound. That's the metal gear solid. Travel through time cigar lady sound. Slow that

338
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:57,239
down. Stretch out the tempo a little. You got it. You got it. It's there. You know, I didn't, I

339
01:09:57,239 --> 01:10:01,479
wasn't sure about this game at first, but now that we've played it for about an hour or so,

340
01:10:01,479 --> 01:10:05,479
half hour, I'm, I could see how I'm, I could play this for a little bit. I could see this.

341
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:21,699
Let's try to get through the second level. That'd be great. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

342
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:33,779
This will explode, right? I, I, I was standing right there and I did it. I mean it failed. You

343
01:10:33,779 --> 01:10:52,819
just saw me do it too slow. I was not too slow. That was perfect. No, I'm not going to do it.

344
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:59,140
I was going to just say something just to say it, just to say words, but I'm not going to do it

345
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:06,119
because it's like, it's like one of those video meme things that have just been like a thousand

346
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:13,609
of them. I will tell you the thing that I was going to say, just, just to like say is on the

347
01:11:13,609 --> 01:11:21,579
screen right now. Like the word is on the screen and it's a meme that's been just done a million

348
01:11:22,939 --> 01:11:41,050
I'll give you another hint. The thing that this originates from, uh, the original source material

349
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:47,050
will probably be around in two to three hundred years. It'll be on season like 300.

350
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:42,489
Judy, stop. I need ammo. Otherwise this is not happening. How much ammo is in the other ham?

351
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:56,460
Or it almost sounds like her lines have been pitch shifted a little bit and slowed the tempo

352
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:01,659
has been changed, not pitch shifted. You know, when you listen to a audio recording that just

353
01:13:01,659 --> 01:13:09,479
sounds off, even if it's pitched a tempo change by about 10%, a normal speaking voice just sounds

354
01:13:09,479 --> 01:13:12,920
normal because you hear me talking and you, you, your brain connects all the dots in between.

355
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:20,760
Yeah, I have an accent, whatever. Right. But the second that you slowed down speech, it sounds

356
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:26,390
really strange. You can hear every single mistake. Why is this not falling?

357
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:34,659
So me going like this, hey, what's going on, everybody? Slow down tempo speed is like,

358
01:13:34,659 --> 01:13:39,779
hey, what's going on, everybody? And it's just like, oh, you sound like shit. Is that actually

359
01:13:39,779 --> 01:13:53,899
how ugly your voice is? It's like, yeah, it is. He's drunk. Oh, fuck. I have to pay attention.

360
01:13:53,899 --> 01:14:23,130
Nobody talk. You see, can I not shoot? What is going on? What the fuck is happening? Oh,

361
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:47,670
I didn't close it. Get this off too. What am I doing with this? Well, I only have three shots in

362
01:14:47,670 --> 01:15:03,319
this. Dude, something's fucking hitting me and it's bad, really fucking bad. And it's almost

363
01:15:03,319 --> 01:15:28,539
killing me every time. Is it the missiles? Is he pretending? I'm not pretending.

364
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:34,710
What would I be pretending? I've done this. This is the third time I've done this. I think I'm

365
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:44,920
going to fucking pretend to like get hurt by this. This would be such a dog shit stream if I had to

366
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:52,869
do this a third fucking time. Do you understand? Why would I want to do this a third time?

367
01:15:55,369 --> 01:16:02,619
Do I want to make your viewing experience horrible? I've got like a fun idea. Let me do

368
01:16:02,619 --> 01:16:09,220
the fucking like second tutorial mission six times. Maybe everyone will leave.

369
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:33,420
Dude, okay. Did you see what happened? What the fuck, man? What? You gotta be kidding me.

370
01:16:35,979 --> 01:16:49,130
This thing does so much damage. I'm getting hit by these like stray rockets that come in and just

371
01:16:49,130 --> 01:17:04,789
kill you. They do almost the entire life bar. This is the Tails mission. What is that? I don't

372
01:17:04,789 --> 01:17:34,979
know what that even means. Oh my god. Oh my god. This is unbelievable. Like what the fuck is this

373
01:17:34,979 --> 01:18:10,069
game? What? What? That was like stupid. Why is this game like this? I'm just, I'm just,

374
01:18:10,069 --> 01:18:29,060
I don't even care about points. I'm getting... Oh, shut up, Judy. What the hell was that? That

375
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:51,720
didn't make any sense. I'm like actually upset with this game. I'm going. Just go. Just go. Go.

376
01:18:52,760 --> 01:19:02,920
Each area. Destroy each target and blow the air that's come from the adjacent areas.

377
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:08,779
When there are too many reinforcements... Shoot the missiles? I was shooting the missiles. I was

378
01:19:08,779 --> 01:19:13,180
targeting with my, that's why I had the assault rifle out the whole time. If one of them touches

379
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:39,000
you, it takes like 60% of your health. ...facility. When communications are made, largest, so destroy it.

380
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:55,270
The dying joke. Yeah, why would I ever do this three times? Shoot the missiles. I'm shooting the

381
01:19:55,270 --> 01:20:06,789
missiles. I was dodging them and shooting them. You just rewind and watch. I was shooting the

382
01:20:06,789 --> 01:20:14,340
missiles. I just watched the last encounter. I wasn't just letting them hit me going. What is

383
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:20,340
that? What is that thing flying at me from across the screen? What are those? Those aren't missiles,

384
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:26,500
are they? No, no, they're, what are they? I think they're bugs. I'm getting hit in the face. What's

385
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:34,710
hitting me here? Should I shoot those fucking things? Nah, nah, I'm just gonna let them hit me.

386
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:09,850
Now, I'm saving my missiles. I want, I'm saving my hand missiles.

387
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:47,159
If I don't do this right now, I'm gonna refund the game. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

388
01:21:47,960 --> 01:22:14,970
Do I get extra health? Why am I taking so long? Tank. I hate that fucking tank. I hate it.

389
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:49,380
I'm just going. I don't even care. How many times does he stop, how many times does it take for him

390
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:54,739
to stop pretending and play at the normal? Well, usually what happens is, I don't know, after about

391
01:22:54,739 --> 01:22:58,979
the fourth or fifth time of like LOL, he's patting his screen and he can't beat it.

392
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:04,340
Like we'd laugh about it and I'm like, what? I can't do it. What happened? I can't beat the

393
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:13,239
level. And then everyone like laughs. I've had like six or seven times. I turn the face,

394
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:21,079
came on and I go like, what? I died to the tank. And everyone like laughs like LOL,

395
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:27,189
you died to the tank. He's like, he can't beat it. And I get like a fucking clown whistle and I go

396
01:23:27,189 --> 01:23:34,409
like. I looked right into the fucking lens. I go like this. I just go. Nevermind. I can't even

397
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:46,460
turn the camera on. Yeah, I die. I die. And then I go like this. You know what I mean? Like,

398
01:23:47,800 --> 01:24:11,369
what is that? It's my ceiling. Where is this camera? Why is it over here? You get it. You

399
01:24:11,369 --> 01:24:19,000
get the idea. I go like this. Oh, that's why. That's why it's fucked up. There's a big explosion

400
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,680
and it fucking takes, like takes me out. Like, oh no, I can't believe. I'll show you. I'll give

401
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:26,520
a couple of examples. We'll keep the face cam on for just a minute or two. Just so you understand.

402
01:24:31,289 --> 01:24:38,840
Right. So I am going to keep the face cam on for this. Because that means I have to like, I can't,

403
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:53,189
I can't like do any dumb like facial features or anything. What on the bug cam? If I lose this

404
01:24:53,189 --> 01:25:09,689
fucking thing again, I swear to God. I'm gonna be spreading like lips on chat. Am I out of ammo for

405
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:17,930
this? Oh, just. I'm not doing this again. I swear to God. I promise. This game's fun. I'm gonna get

406
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:45,899
my acting on my flies down. Oh shit. Let me fix that. What are you doing? Oh, I almost died.

407
01:25:45,899 --> 01:25:49,260
Okay. I'm going to do it. People are going to come into the stream. They can fucking hate this

408
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:58,869
stream, but I'm going to do a stream. Here comes the video. Yeah. People are going to hate this,

409
01:25:58,869 --> 01:26:05,140
but I'm flustered right now. So we're going to do it. Here you go. You ready for this?

410
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:19,319
I can't do this. I'm going to try. No, I'm not even like, I'm not happy enough to do this.

411
01:26:24,039 --> 01:26:27,619
Let me get rid of this for I'm going to make this quick. And then here comes the tank and I'm going

412
01:26:27,619 --> 01:26:40,439
to get it right. Turning the face cam on means I have to like behave. All right. Here we go.

413
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:53,260
I am ready. I've got my two launchers. I shouldn't even use this here. I should use it on the actual

414
01:26:53,420 --> 01:27:00,390
tank. That's the problem. Okay. So I don't, I know I can't double it up because they have to shoot

415
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:06,310
the missiles, right? Like I shouldn't do this because then I have to shoot the missiles out

416
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:17,159
of the air. I don't have anything to shoot the missiles out of the air. I just have to get,

417
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:20,920
I had to just do good. I just have to dodge the missiles. I can't even do this. It's impossible.

418
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:30,699
It's not possible to do this right now. Use your shotgun.

419
01:27:30,699 --> 01:28:09,000
Oh, where are they? Here it comes.

420
01:28:25,899 --> 01:28:33,369
I just shut my nose. My nose just closed shut.

421
01:28:56,939 --> 01:29:01,260
You can't tell me that I'm doing, you can't tell me that that's okay. Don't even tell me that's

422
01:29:01,260 --> 01:30:01,529
okay. I died. I died. It killed it. It killed me so fast that it gave me 50% of my health back.

423
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:04,090
I don't have anything else to shoot them out of the air with.

424
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:43,319
It's killing me and bringing me back to health. This is, it's toned up too high. The game is

425
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:51,029
broken. It's a broken game. It's killing me so fast with these missiles that it's actually

426
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:58,329
fucking resetting my health. There's a wrong number here. Toned incorrectly. It has to be.

427
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:17,210
I need ammo for my assault rifle. Offensive argument. Come on, give me something

428
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:24,060
that's not, I need ammo in this gun. Ammo, light arms ammo. Got it. All right. Good.

429
01:31:27,289 --> 01:31:31,930
Good. Good. Good. Shield unit. Got it. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Fuck off.

430
01:31:32,569 --> 01:31:42,359
No, not you guys. Where's my, there it is. And then I need this missile alert, missile alert,

431
01:31:42,359 --> 01:32:49,590
alert missiles, missiles alert coming in. Where? Missile alert coming in. Missile alert. No bullets.

432
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:34,760
Dude, you can't beat the game. You just don't, the game doesn't, you can't win. I'm convinced.

433
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:29,859
Nice haircut. See how fucking big my hands are. This is a full size.

434
01:34:30,739 --> 01:34:44,859
In San Francisco have, Mr. President. Sure. All in a day's work. All in a day's work.

435
01:34:44,859 --> 01:34:56,890
It just begun. Fight will continue. Oh, Eagle. The America inside my heart is still alive.

436
01:34:56,890 --> 01:35:13,000
Okay. Camera, I can turn this off now. I don't need it anymore. That's a hundred. I don't care.

437
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:24,220
I don't care. That tank was dumb. New weapon. MP7N. Saving the citizens increases your economy

438
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:28,060
rating in San Francisco. Survive saying the scientists increase your technology rating

439
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:37,350
in San Francisco. Seven. Okay. I've got some money. What is this? What is this?

440
01:35:47,369 --> 01:36:02,890
That doesn't even look like me. I mean, it does, I guess. Look at that huge chin.

441
01:36:08,199 --> 01:36:10,520
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta get this on here.

442
01:36:19,779 --> 01:36:35,829
Uh, it looks like, it looks like something dragged this chin. Did you drag this down?

443
01:36:35,829 --> 01:36:45,300
Did you smudge this in Photoshop? I don't know. Did you smudge this in Photoshop?

444
01:36:47,939 --> 01:37:03,319
Are you sure? No, you definitely did. I don't actually look like that, right? Do I?

445
01:37:05,609 --> 01:37:09,689
No, you did the smudge tool in Photoshop and you're just making me look like a fucking idiot.

446
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:38,119
Yeah, it's a smudge tool. No, it's not. Look at the clip. Oh no. Hold on. This is really,

447
01:37:38,119 --> 01:37:52,500
hold on. What the fuck was that? Wait, what? No, what? Did I get linked to wrong browser?

448
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:12,569
Where did it come from? That was the noise. What is going on? It's the wrong video,

449
01:38:12,569 --> 01:38:29,300
but the fucking Twitch clip is still here. Did you hear that? Right? Where is it coming from?

450
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:43,720
No bullets. No. Stop. Stop the browser. It's not even playing anymore. There's nothing on,

451
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:48,869
there's no browser playing right now. Therefore, it's impossible for there to be anything else.

452
01:38:51,770 --> 01:39:03,050
Right? Oh my God. Where's it playing? No bullets. I don't have it open. I don't have it open

453
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:18,439
anywhere. I swear to God. Where is it open? This fucked up. Give me the steam overlay. No,

454
01:39:18,439 --> 01:39:24,359
this is on the steam overlay browser. This is on the steam. I don't know how I did this.

455
01:39:25,319 --> 01:39:31,109
I'm going to close every window. This music. I'm going to close. Every window is closed.

456
01:39:32,779 --> 01:39:47,579
There are no windows open. This fucking clip does not exist anywhere. Oh my God. This is going to

457
01:39:47,579 --> 01:40:19,220
drive me fucking crazy. Okay. Hold on. I fixed it. No, no, no, no, no. I don't look like that.

458
01:40:19,220 --> 01:41:02,010
That's a Photoshop tool. Right? That's fucking horrible. I, I, no, I can't fucking believe it.

459
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:13,449
Thanos chin. Oh my God. I'm done. What? No, I thought that was the face I was making right now.

460
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:33,930
A sharp rubric of cannon fire echoes across San Francisco. President Wilson

461
01:41:33,930 --> 01:41:36,409
commends his counteroffensive against the prize president's regime.

462
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:43,699
The liberation of the city struck a chord in the hearts of a small band of patriots

463
01:41:43,699 --> 01:41:47,220
whose alabaster souls still believed in the freedom that Richard Hawke had stripped away.

464
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:51,140
MOA movement had been born and it wanted to talk to get the hell out of dog.

465
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:55,300
The wings of justice were spreading like an eagle. Here comes the president.

466
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:59,300
The information management department received an email that might interest you.

467
01:42:32,439 --> 01:42:41,220
It's Thanos's really, really happy, like reverse, reverse brother. You know,

468
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:47,579
Thanos wants half the people gone. Uh, fairness was 50% more people.

469
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:15,020
An email. Actually, it's a sound file. Play it for me. Hey, here comes the sound. Yes, boss.

470
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:24,859
Didn't get very much of that. Uh, we are seeking volunteers to oppose the coup d'etat forces.

471
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:32,439
Two response from fellow sympathizers. The sound quality is terrible.

472
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:40,439
Could you try and contact the person who sent the email? Sure. Of course, boss. I ain't ever

473
01:43:40,439 --> 01:43:46,439
going to beat this game. Maybe America's faith and freedom hasn't faded just yet. And Jody,

474
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:55,989
I'm taking back our country going from west to east. I mean, east, young man. What?

475
01:43:56,710 --> 01:44:02,149
Huh? Mr. President, we got a message from the information management department.

476
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:10,329
The coup d'etat forces are making an announcement on national television.

477
01:44:11,289 --> 01:44:20,970
Connect me. Here we go. Dear fellow Americans, good evening.

478
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:27,770
This is an announcement from the government policy promotion department where the password is

479
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:36,250
overflowing love and daily benevolence. Today, we bring you a most unfortunate bulletin.

480
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:45,670
Last evening, the city of San Francisco suffered extensive damage at the hand of metal wolf

481
01:44:45,670 --> 01:44:53,029
who suddenly appeared. In addition to slaughtering unresisting citizens, this

482
01:44:53,029 --> 01:45:01,909
heinous terrorist took citizens hostage and made an unjust demand for the release of violent

483
01:45:01,909 --> 01:45:12,619
criminals and the sum of 500 million dollars. This vicious act could easily be the worst in

484
01:45:12,619 --> 01:45:29,350
U.S. history. That like fake cry. Metal wolf's pilot is meaner than Satan himself.

485
01:45:30,649 --> 01:45:38,170
And we will not permit him to get away with acts like this. We Americans will never

486
01:45:39,369 --> 01:45:48,100
yield to such evil. We Americans will obtain our own justice.

487
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:51,779
All right, that's my line. Although martial law continues,

488
01:45:53,140 --> 01:46:01,579
my fellow Americans, please bear with our situation to defend this lovable nation.

489
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:09,210
Let's lead the brave fight together. This has been an announcement from the government policy

490
01:46:09,210 --> 01:46:14,810
promotion department where our motto justice over theory is your motto.

491
01:46:18,979 --> 01:46:31,880
We've been made public enemy number one seeking exile. No, I'm the president. I can't be the one

492
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:38,199
to start a war in this country. I'll be the one to wage the war. Isn't that what is that you just

493
01:46:38,199 --> 01:46:48,659
said? Mr. President. Hey Jody, update me on the situation in the west. Where we going? All right,

494
01:46:48,659 --> 01:46:55,800
we got more. We got Grand Canyon, Alcatraz, Grand Canyon. Which one of these is the easiest?

495
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:06,060
This is, I mean, this is like, you know, this is Grand Canyon. Destroy the Alcatraz cannon.

496
01:47:07,189 --> 01:47:11,909
Okay. On the prison island Alcatraz, only three kilometers offshore from San Francisco,

497
01:47:11,909 --> 01:47:17,270
the enemy force is setting up a huge electromagnetic Alcatraz cannon to combat terrorism.

498
01:47:17,909 --> 01:47:24,500
All the shelling in the desert region has implanted fear into the hearts of the people

499
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:29,460
on the west coast. The shelling is directed at keeping the dissidents in check. By destroying

500
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:35,300
the energy tanks around the Alcatraz cannon, you can stop its operation. The current is so strong

501
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:40,819
that no one has ever escaped from Alcatraz. Please be careful not to fall in the ocean.

502
01:47:40,819 --> 01:47:45,859
Got a little closer to the mic. This mission goes by the call name. Call name.

503
01:47:51,529 --> 01:47:58,579
Good one. Okay, I have a lot of money. We're gonna go and do some development.

504
01:48:00,229 --> 01:48:07,189
Manufacturing investment. Okay. Let's see, shotguns, machine guns.

505
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:13,529
Let's get some development. No, assault rifles. Yeah, let's get some development.

506
01:48:14,489 --> 01:48:25,060
Now I can make two of those. Let's do it again. That's it. I got it all. I can do more.

507
01:48:25,539 --> 01:48:38,920
Should I do it again? I'm gonna do it again. Development level two. Yeah. SG-552. Yeah. All

508
01:48:38,920 --> 01:49:03,189
right. Where is it? There's a new link. Of course there is. Okay. This is honestly, this is just

509
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:14,550
here. Hold on. Just color me green and make me a Hearthstone card. It's like, oh, there's

510
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:34,760
the greedy Grinner. It's a 1-1. Each time your hero takes damage, a coin is deposited into your

511
01:49:34,760 --> 01:50:00,840
hand. Divine Shield 1-1. No, this. You guys are just bombarding me with links right now. Somebody

512
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:05,399
make it a Hearthstone card. It's not there. There's a template to make a Hearthstone card.

513
01:50:09,109 --> 01:50:25,079
I want the greedy Grinner. Dr. Boomer. That was quick. Holy shit, that was quick. He didn't do it

514
01:50:25,079 --> 01:51:11,100
that quick. What? This is so funny. It's just stupid because imagine this is a Hearthstone card.

515
01:51:13,180 --> 01:51:21,340
Face. Face is green. And in the background, this is like foam. There's like a wall back there.

516
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:26,140
You can tell when Blizzard's gonna get real fucking lazy when they decide to do some shit like this.

517
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:38,630
Why would this have Divine Shield? Oh, I can have like a, yeah, a car, a car drop sound. Yeah.

518
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:58,899
Hold on. Give me a second. I'll get this. I gotta turn this off for a second though. This is

519
01:51:58,899 --> 01:52:12,229
important. Okay. It's gonna be a little bigger than that. I'm gonna, I gotta like play the

520
01:52:12,229 --> 01:52:23,979
card. You know what I mean? I gotta turn this off. This is fucking so stupid. Can you guys,

521
01:52:23,979 --> 01:52:30,550
okay, tell me if you guys can still hear the, the in-game audio. You can't? Good. All right.

522
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:43,689
Here we go. Okay. I need a good sound effect. Like an electric splash.

523
01:52:56,579 --> 01:52:59,380
Play the car. Here we go. Let me get a good voice for this one.

524
01:53:00,020 --> 01:53:09,430
Ahem. I'll be taking that one.

525
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:47,060
Let me play. I'll be taking that one. This is doing it too many times. Okay. Let's get that

526
01:53:47,060 --> 01:54:18,779
and the splash. Huge splash sound. That's it? No, I need a huge one. Big splash. Here we go.

527
01:54:18,779 --> 01:54:42,140
In there. I'll be taking that one. It's a legendary. Come on. No, get this, get all this

528
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:47,350
shit off the screen. Get off everything. I need a Hearthstone board. Give me a Hearthstone board

529
01:54:47,350 --> 01:55:06,899
image. Give me like a full hand in Hearthstone. Hearthstone board. Here we go. Okay. Doesn't

530
01:55:06,899 --> 01:55:21,579
matter. This. Open Hearthstone. No, I'm not gonna open up Hearthstone for this shit.

531
01:55:49,539 --> 01:55:59,350
Okay. I'm playing my card. I'm gonna tilt it a little. No, it's all right. I can just grab it.

532
01:55:59,350 --> 01:56:13,020
No mana. It's three mana. It's enough. Here we go. What should I play here? I'm thinking maybe

533
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:21,510
end turn. No, I don't think so. I think I'm gonna play. The Greed of Grinner is a new

534
01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:37,659
card. Seems pretty good. Let's just try it. I'll be taking that one. All right. So he's pretty good.

535
01:56:38,220 --> 01:56:51,079
I think I would... I'll trade with the... I think I trade with the... Oh, I can't actually click

536
01:56:51,079 --> 01:57:08,020
this. I'm a fucking idiot. There you go. Open... I'm not gonna open Hearthstone. No, I'm not gonna

537
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:56,979
play Hearthstone right now. That was the worst stream I've ever done. I don't even have to write.

538
01:57:56,979 --> 01:58:10,060
I can't open up Hearthstone. I don't even know my password. The fuck is my Blizzard password?

539
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:26,579
I have no idea. Is that right? Got it. I have to update Hearthstone, guys. There's a new one.

540
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:47,380
Are you gonna make a hole? What did the stream become? I have... It's not gonna even work.

541
01:58:48,180 --> 01:59:02,859
I have to wait to how Hearthstone is downloading right now. I have to play the computer for this

542
01:59:02,859 --> 01:59:25,750
to be a thing. I need to get like a slam sound effect too of when it lands. That works. That's

543
01:59:25,829 --> 01:59:30,920
really fucking loud. And I'm like, I'll be taking that one to the bank.

544
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:50,569
Lands. Okay. Program the card into the game. There's a new card. How many cards do I have?

545
01:59:58,810 --> 02:00:01,529
This one doesn't have any transparency though. I can't use this one.

546
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:15,180
Why would you ever give your minions minus two attack? Oh, there is transparency on it. Okay.

547
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:32,340
Give all... Oh, give all minions. Okay. I see. I see. All right. We've waited long enough. I'm

548
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:49,899
doing it. Here we go. That's a new card though. That needs another sound effect.

549
02:01:08,569 --> 02:01:24,180
That's for too long. This is actual clown stream. Yeah, what's he doing?

550
02:01:29,939 --> 02:01:34,180
I'm not... That's not me doing that.

551
02:01:46,569 --> 02:01:56,970
Okay.

552
02:02:10,489 --> 02:02:13,609
Where am I? Okay. I'm sitting in a chair. I'm mad. I'm like, where am I?

553
02:02:15,449 --> 02:02:22,279
Okay. Why is DOS games activated? Hey guys, did you know that evil miscreant got changed?

554
02:02:24,739 --> 02:02:28,340
Don't care. Solo. Just play. How do you play against a computer? Tutorial?

555
02:02:28,979 --> 02:02:37,350
How do I play against the computer? Solo Adventure? I don't know how to do this. How do you play

556
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:51,289
against a computer? There's so many things here. Wait, let me... I gotta get the game on the screen.

557
02:02:52,500 --> 02:03:00,039
I'm only doing this once by the way, guys. I ain't doing this shit more than once.

558
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:04,890
I gotta get it and then I'm done and we'll move on. We're gonna move on.

559
02:03:08,069 --> 02:03:13,510
Okay. Where is it? League of Explorers? Witchwood? Die... Oh, practice. Okay, practice.

560
02:03:15,850 --> 02:03:27,180
Uh... I wonder how much I've played this. Okay. Custom Hunter. Custom Hunter 2.

561
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:30,539
This is probably not even filled out with enemies. With minions or anything. I don't even know which

562
02:03:30,539 --> 02:03:41,109
one to pick. A classic Hunter 2? Custom Hunter 2. Uh, we're gonna... Who cares? We'll play against

563
02:03:41,109 --> 02:03:56,920
a good mage. This doesn't matter. Custom Hunter Password 2. No, I'm not doing all these. I'm not

564
02:03:56,920 --> 02:04:07,670
doing all these. I'm not gonna do this. Please. Don't do this to me. You know I'll stay here for

565
02:04:07,670 --> 02:04:16,970
an hour and do this. I'm like a child. Okay, hold on. It actually does look like they belong

566
02:04:16,970 --> 02:04:22,489
on the screen. Which one of these do I want to mulligan? I don't know. What is this deck?

567
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:40,310
I have to get down to no cards. Like one card. So I can have them down here. God damn it.

568
02:04:41,270 --> 02:04:55,510
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna rope against the AI. Is that even possible? Okay, I need to get

569
02:04:55,510 --> 02:05:10,439
rid of these cards. Who cares? Use Greedy Grinner. He's meta. Just wait. I need to get rid of this

570
02:05:10,439 --> 02:05:38,949
shit. I need an empty hand. What am I in here for? Is this a bounty?

571
02:05:43,619 --> 02:05:48,260
I don't know. What does this do? I'm doing like a good job.

572
02:05:50,819 --> 02:05:59,850
I just want to clear the board. Okay, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's too many

573
02:05:59,850 --> 02:06:20,630
cards. I'm gonna get this ready. I need a like a whoosh. Electric. Electric whoosh.

574
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:34,390
I'm just playing random cards. It's gonna be empty next time. Okay, electric whoosh. Synthetic

575
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:53,000
electric whoosh. Let's try it. Good. I like it. Dude, I'm doing better playing random cards than

576
02:06:53,000 --> 02:07:05,939
I was trying to play this game. All right, here we go. Okay, I'm gonna have an empty hand here.

577
02:07:08,310 --> 02:07:11,350
No, I want empty hands. No, I don't want more of this stuff.

578
02:07:13,510 --> 02:07:18,890
I don't have enough room to play these cards. It's a full board.

579
02:07:33,350 --> 02:07:36,869
No, I'm not playing Hearthstone right now. I gotta do this now. Like quick.

580
02:07:38,810 --> 02:07:52,949
Okay, I need to get a six, seven, eight. Kill everybody. I need an empty board down here.

581
02:07:56,460 --> 02:08:04,149
Good. Thank you. I appreciate the killer. Kill all this. Okay, here we go. It doesn't matter. I can

582
02:08:04,149 --> 02:08:12,789
have one card in here. That's fine. All right, here we go. I'm gonna play my cards. That fits here.

583
02:08:15,739 --> 02:08:30,569
That fits here. Let's get the other cards on here. Where is the other one? Here it is.

584
02:08:39,779 --> 02:08:55,819
Blackwater Bay. Okay, where's that other one? There's one more. How many more of these do you

585
02:08:55,819 --> 02:09:03,399
guys have? Pog moment? Do I have to set up a new sound for every one of these? I have to.

586
02:09:11,399 --> 02:09:19,260
No, no, no. No, that's it. No more. I'm done. I'm done. No more of these. These other two

587
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:39,829
are coming in and that's it. You can't rope against the AI, right? Okay. Where's that other one?

588
02:09:40,470 --> 02:09:57,220
I gotta like make these in audacity. If the opponent has a meltdown, win the game.

589
02:10:00,149 --> 02:10:07,100
Oh my god. I have to make this full screen. Otherwise, I can't see the fuck I'm doing.

590
02:10:07,739 --> 02:10:19,500
Okay, let's go. Why did I even open this? What was the point of having Hearthstone open?

591
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:27,750
There is no point. What? Just so this is animated? Okay, I'm gonna play my cards. I can only play

592
02:10:27,750 --> 02:10:45,369
a couple in this turn. Let's try. I gotta turn the music up. No, it's all right. It's at a good

593
02:10:45,369 --> 02:10:49,779
level. All right, here we go. This is important. I gotta keep this. I gotta do this right.

594
02:10:53,619 --> 02:10:58,470
Ready? All right, so which one am I playing? I think I'm gonna play

595
02:10:59,859 --> 02:11:07,079
Pog moment, I think. Give all memes in your hand a plus two term of Venus. Okay,

596
02:11:07,079 --> 02:11:11,270
that sounds pretty good. Yeah, I think I'm gonna try this one.

597
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:22,090
Look at that fog jam. Preview. Oh, fuck you. Preview. All right, it's on.

598
02:11:22,649 --> 02:11:31,109
Preview. Preview.

599
02:11:39,479 --> 02:11:49,109
It ruined it. Imagine if Blizzard put in just like ripped audio from YouTube and it still had that

600
02:11:49,109 --> 02:12:04,520
shit in it for sound effects. It's a spell. The game froze. All right, I need like a pirate song.

601
02:12:15,159 --> 02:12:31,579
It's just accordion. It's just accordion. That's what it is. It's just the sound of an accordion.

602
02:12:31,579 --> 02:12:40,170
Accordion. Windows 95 startup on accordion. What do you mean Windows 95 startup on accordion?

603
02:12:40,890 --> 02:13:03,529
Accordion pirate. I can't. I have to stop this now. It doesn't matter. Okay, here we go.

604
02:13:04,970 --> 02:13:13,340
All right. Your weapon's crossed too, lad. I'll get you from the. I'll get you from the side.

605
02:13:14,699 --> 02:13:23,560
Check it out, boys. One at a time. Good. Record that. Let me be one at a time. There's only one

606
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:55,189
person. I'll be there waiting and watching. I don't know. Okay, you're just gonna watch.

607
02:13:56,149 --> 02:14:13,909
I still got playing a mana. Okay, here we go. How about this one? Let's throw it on there.

608
02:14:14,550 --> 02:14:25,369
Chad Jexington. This is legendary. You know it's gonna be good. I think I'm gonna place it.

609
02:14:25,369 --> 02:14:31,979
Should I play it? Yeah. No, that's not what I wanted.

610
02:14:33,109 --> 02:14:38,279
I want the sound. I want like that.

611
02:14:40,840 --> 02:15:11,880
I don't think I should do it. I don't think I should do it. I'll play it.

612
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:15,939
Yeah, let's put it over here. Sounds like a plan.

613
02:15:21,739 --> 02:15:24,140
Not funny. Not funny at all. Get it off. It's not funny.

614
02:15:25,930 --> 02:15:35,060
That's not funny at all. It's already on the board, though. All right, this last one. Well,

615
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:49,930
there's two more. How about this one? Here we go. This will be good. Okay.

616
02:15:52,439 --> 02:16:03,159
Your time is out. Like it. Print it. Here we go. Your time is up. No, time is out. No,

617
02:16:03,159 --> 02:16:12,619
your time is out, right? Yeah. Your time is out. That's not as loud as I thought it was gonna be.

618
02:16:16,659 --> 02:16:33,110
It's not what I wanted. No, not relaxing. All right, I'm done. That's it. The joke's over.

619
02:16:33,110 --> 02:16:40,340
It's fine. It's over. I don't have to do it anymore. That was not what I wanted.

620
02:16:47,420 --> 02:16:54,739
How is this not a sound? I just typed in electric shock and the first like 10 videos or at least

621
02:16:54,739 --> 02:17:04,379
the first three videos are about G fuel. Is that like a flavor? I think that's a flavor of G fuel.

622
02:17:04,379 --> 02:17:16,170
All right, how about this? This doesn't matter. I'm gonna play this card instead.

623
02:17:17,590 --> 02:17:21,030
Hey, I'll be taking that money from you.

624
02:17:22,969 --> 02:17:55,000
Hey, why can't I grab this shit anymore? I think I played Chad Jackson. Your time is up.

625
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,680
Oh my fucking god. I'm trying to lock it. Never mind. I almost just closed the whole screen.

626
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:22,260
I don't even know where whatever the metal wolf is still here, right? Yeah. All right. We're good.

627
02:18:22,260 --> 02:18:36,489
Here's the entrance theme that you wanted. I'm walking on a call to arms. Tyrion forgery. Oh,

628
02:18:36,489 --> 02:18:55,420
there it is. What is this sound in the background? Get out of my way.

629
02:18:56,219 --> 02:19:12,979
I could be a fucking actor. Well, that was fun. Like the last three hours of the stream.

630
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:22,860
I could be a fucking actor. I think I could do it. All right. I gotta let I have to close

631
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:35,879
Hearthstone. At least let me just beat this though. I can beat this. Why are there two of these?

632
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:41,479
What the fuck is happening? This shouldn't be happening. There's two. I don't know why

633
02:19:41,479 --> 02:19:51,559
there are two. This is supposed to be Hearthstone. Let me just finish the game. Hearthstone. That's

634
02:19:51,559 --> 02:20:17,659
not Hearthstone. Oh my god. All right. Let me just win. I can do it still. Can I do it still?

635
02:20:18,299 --> 02:20:46,520
It's still possible. He's gonna use it. I wasn't even trying to win. Give me a break. That was

636
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:52,040
not it. That's fine. I thought I can lose to the AI. I was doing a stupid thing. All right. What

637
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:57,379
is this capturing? Metal wolf chaos. There it is. That's the game that we're fucking playing. Not

638
02:20:57,379 --> 02:21:07,340
this one. Yeah. That is actually dying to pinwheel. I know. I'm aware of that. I know some of you

639
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:13,610
are disgusted. But come on. What do you want me to do? I don't remember a single thing I was doing.

640
02:21:14,649 --> 02:21:21,219
I don't know. I'm pretty certain that I was I wanted a better than missile launchers, right?

641
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:36,620
Sixty five thousand dollars. That's a lot. I have level two assault rifles. Oh, that was a lot of

642
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:46,069
bits came in. Yes is online. Give $50. Thank you. Thanks for the 5000 bits. I shouldn't have done

643
02:21:46,069 --> 02:21:58,819
so much damage in one turn. God damn it. It's true. You shouldn't. I don't know. I shouldn't

644
02:21:58,819 --> 02:22:06,180
have done that. You're right. New E mode. I don't know about that. All right. Machine guns. I want

645
02:22:06,180 --> 02:22:14,700
better machine guns. MP7 ST. Where's the audio? Oh, right. I turned it all the way down.

646
02:22:18,020 --> 02:22:33,370
There we go. There's that music. Okay. That looks good. Should I do it? No. Now I need to actually

647
02:22:33,370 --> 02:22:41,059
buy these things. Should I do bazookas? I'll do bazookas. No, I have plenty of missile grenade

648
02:22:41,059 --> 02:23:02,620
launchers. No rail gun. The flamethrower kind of sucks. The M72A3 is now available. I need to go

649
02:23:02,620 --> 02:23:12,889
through these and see what they even do. Okay. Back up here. So this is 700. 7600. These are

650
02:23:13,770 --> 02:23:21,129
energy cost zero. Starting capacity. Precision targeting. Fires high powered rockets.

651
02:23:22,170 --> 02:23:29,379
High explosive rockets. Heavy arms. Standard rounds. Firepower. This thing sucks.

652
02:23:30,340 --> 02:23:44,760
Is this range? Why wouldn't you just use the default? It doesn't use a warning. Okay,

653
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:53,639
I have new ones. No, I don't. Go back to Hearthstone. No, you don't want me to play Hearthstone.

654
02:23:54,680 --> 02:24:02,680
I can guarantee you do not want me to do that. All right. MP7. 100. More capacity. Rate of fire.

655
02:24:03,799 --> 02:24:06,840
Intercepting. Oh, this is... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to need that.

656
02:24:07,799 --> 02:24:20,739
Give me this thing. Energy rounds. That sounds kind of cool. Let's try it. I also have assault.

657
02:24:20,739 --> 02:24:30,420
Here we go. I got the SG552. Upgraded range and firepower. I'll take it. Oh, no, I can't take it.

658
02:24:31,379 --> 02:24:43,559
I'm blind. What's going on? I got... No, that's fine. I'll come back.

659
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:52,899
Let's equip. Get on there. Let's actually play the game. I know people are going to start snoozing

660
02:24:52,899 --> 02:25:05,860
once we go from Hearthstone cards. I want this. I don't want the shotgun. It's all right. You can

661
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:15,639
snooze if you want. All right, here's the regular bazooka. We'll wake you up later. Don't worry.

662
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:27,129
Keep that there. I need to... I feel like the handgun. Why would I even use the handgun?

663
02:25:28,090 --> 02:25:38,700
I think this is fine for now. Yeah, this is good. This is good. I'll be all right with this.

664
02:25:41,299 --> 02:25:45,510
Save the game. Now, technically, I have been playing this game for like two hours,

665
02:25:45,510 --> 02:25:49,510
but that's not true. See? That's not true. I've only played this game for about an hour and 10 minutes.

666
02:25:50,469 --> 02:25:59,129
Wake me up before you go. Okay. Enemy forces occupy Alcatraz Island.

667
02:26:00,549 --> 02:26:06,950
Jodie, what is that daunting thing? The Alcatraz cannon. How original.

668
02:26:08,629 --> 02:26:14,709
You'd never make it on Madison Avenue. Stomp and surrender, Metal Wolf.

669
02:26:16,739 --> 02:26:23,379
Surrender? If you fail to comply, the Alcatraz cannon will zap you backwards, coach. Will it now?

670
02:26:25,850 --> 02:26:29,850
Not if I zap it first. So just take out the cannon? That's kind of cool.

671
02:26:31,209 --> 02:26:37,340
Mr. President, the Alcatraz cannon just started to recharge.

672
02:26:38,139 --> 02:26:42,700
I'm on the move. I'll smash it faster than a Florida Rico.

673
02:26:42,700 --> 02:26:48,360
Siri, what's the weather like today? A gun battery. 65 degrees and charming.

674
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:58,840
Five minutes? In the center of the island. Wait a minute. This is DNN's Peter McDonald reporting.

675
02:26:59,479 --> 02:27:03,479
That's the heinous terrorist, Metal Wolf, as seen from the air.

676
02:27:03,479 --> 02:27:10,120
He's trying to take over the Alcatraz cannon and destroy the west coast. DNN is coming to you live

677
02:27:10,120 --> 02:27:16,870
and exclusively as these events unfold. Forget him and keep your mind on the mission.

678
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:19,989
Mission. Mind on the mission. Let's go. I got five minutes to get up there.

679
02:27:20,629 --> 02:27:25,110
I know. This device also seems to supply energy to the Alcatraz cannon.

680
02:27:25,110 --> 02:27:28,629
You should destroy it in order to decrease the energy recharge supply.

681
02:27:29,670 --> 02:27:49,000
I need a... There we go. The ham. Damn, this thing is beefy. This thing's beefy, man.

682
02:27:50,040 --> 02:28:04,440
Oh, clocks. Clocks. Clocks. Clocks. Oops. Sorry. Oh, shit. Clocks. Clocks. Clocks. It's blocking up.

683
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:29,030
Clocks. I gotta have to move, man. Bang. Watch this one. Even set cool. Oops.

684
02:28:29,030 --> 02:28:45,479
Oops. Gotta be quicker. Mr. President.

685
02:28:48,600 --> 02:29:26,709
I can't move. Come on, get it. I kinda just keep telling you that.

686
02:29:26,709 --> 02:29:47,159
You may or may not already know. There's two of these.

687
02:29:54,659 --> 02:29:59,270
I didn't surrender. What happened?

688
02:29:59,270 --> 02:30:04,069
Come on. If you lie down and sleep here, you'll get sent by the Alcatraz cannon.

689
02:30:04,069 --> 02:30:06,340
Mr. President. Is this scripted?

690
02:30:06,340 --> 02:30:15,030
It's a battery. That thing should take five minutes to recharge.

691
02:30:16,069 --> 02:30:17,110
It was the landmines.

692
02:30:20,069 --> 02:30:22,229
Oh, right. It was the landmines.

693
02:30:22,229 --> 02:30:24,709
Mr. President, keep your mind on the mission, Mr. President.

694
02:30:24,709 --> 02:30:26,790
Laugh with me. Laugh with me. Mr. President.

695
02:30:26,790 --> 02:30:40,780
I was watching Germany yesterday and I'm kind of like a fan. He's like,

696
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:46,379
I, I, I, he's like kind of fucked up yesterday, but I didn't like that one.

697
02:30:48,620 --> 02:31:04,809
7200 fucking uploads. Yeah, I agree. Something was weird about that stream. It was like, not very

698
02:31:04,809 --> 02:31:17,770
fun. 16,000 uploads. On the page, on the page, all slash all. Yeah, I just like saw this on all.

699
02:31:17,770 --> 02:31:22,739
Like, I don't know who this guy is. But like, I guess I'll check it out and that's weird.

700
02:31:24,739 --> 02:32:04,700
Didn't hit. Get it. Cool. You can't fall off yet, can you? I don't know. Can you? Is that,

701
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:08,219
does it count? It actually does count. I just had to test. I didn't, I didn't know. I had to

702
02:32:08,219 --> 02:32:12,219
test it. I had to test it. I had to test it. I had to test it. I needed to know. I needed to know.

703
02:32:12,219 --> 02:32:16,379
I watched that stream yesterday and like, I wasn't a fan. I just, I didn't know if you'd,

704
02:32:16,379 --> 02:32:21,020
of course, it's a Dark Souls game. A gun battery that big should take five minutes to recharge.

705
02:32:21,020 --> 02:32:25,260
Until then, head for the Alcatraz cannon in the center of the island.

706
02:32:25,340 --> 02:32:29,799
Forget him and keep your mind on the mission, Mr. President.

707
02:32:34,329 --> 02:32:44,629
I know. Come on. Yeah, I'm from all, like, I know. Is he a YouTuber or something? Like, a streamer?

708
02:32:47,290 --> 02:33:02,659
That's kind of fucked up that his streaming didn't do fun today, though. I'm getting the

709
02:33:02,659 --> 02:33:10,309
creeps. Musician was among the POWs you rescued. He was forced to perform to entertain the troops.

710
02:33:13,219 --> 02:33:16,260
More. Actually, can I put the assault rifle on here? I think I need it.

711
02:33:17,059 --> 02:33:30,120
Of course you can. What a blasted game, huh? The helicopters are the worst. They don't want

712
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:47,159
to shoot the missiles. I have to get them done immediately. They are the worst. Don't fall off

713
02:33:47,159 --> 02:33:56,920
the edge like you did last time. It's not that hard. Get with it. There's two, right?

714
02:34:00,819 --> 02:34:04,020
It's the landmines. Watch out for them. Blow them up. I can blow them up, right?

715
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:18,680
No? Yeah, I can. This is tricky here. This is tricky.

716
02:34:20,680 --> 02:34:32,870
Let's get some of those on here from distance. Pretty good. They can't even fire.

717
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:43,100
That should be enough. Is that not enough? I'm sorry. My real voice is coming out. I'm from

718
02:34:43,100 --> 02:34:55,829
Boston. Fucking dude. Military is being decimated. Platoon after platoon. That's it, right? Be careful.

719
02:35:10,889 --> 02:35:16,920
Where's that new weapon? Did I not equip it? I didn't even equip the damn thing. You serious?

720
02:35:18,409 --> 02:35:30,469
No, I did. Didn't I? Oh shit. Oh shit. That's gonna kill me. No, no. The stupid missiles. The airborne

721
02:35:30,469 --> 02:35:50,920
missiles. Okay, hang on. Don't forget. When the going gets tough, the tough get going, Mr. President.

722
02:35:50,920 --> 02:36:05,510
Yes. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Activate.

723
02:36:41,850 --> 02:37:03,850
I gotta hurry up. No, I'm taking damage. Stupid. 70%. Come on.

724
02:37:10,489 --> 02:37:11,129
How do I get up there?

725
02:37:15,690 --> 02:37:27,850
Your cruelty won't go unpunished. Did I go all the way down to the beginning of the level?

726
02:37:28,809 --> 02:37:46,569
I did, didn't I? Come on. Are you serious? Where was the way to go?

727
02:37:48,409 --> 02:38:00,739
Down this way. Can I still do it? Please don't make a gun. I think I can do it.

728
02:38:09,180 --> 02:38:27,860
Come on. Hey, get that on the news. Open the door. Open the door.

729
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:40,139
So the U.S. military has had something up its sleeve. Those who interfere will be eliminated.

730
02:38:43,530 --> 02:38:47,659
95%. It's already charged. This doesn't just shoot, right?

731
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:59,659
Oh god. Destroy all of them. I have to destroy all of them. All of them. It's getting 97%.

732
02:39:16,149 --> 02:39:23,739
If you shoot, I'll hold it against you forever. Get us out of here.

733
02:39:33,270 --> 02:39:38,309
That sucks. I just have to go. Forget about everything else. We have to go fast now. Hurry.

734
02:39:41,430 --> 02:40:43,530
Oh my god. No, I want this. Hurry. Oh shit. I'm screwed up. I need this thing. The interception

735
02:40:43,610 --> 02:41:32,680
one. No, I didn't want to fucking do that. I hit accidentally. Come on. Double it up. Double it

736
02:41:32,680 --> 02:41:43,299
up. Double it up. Double it up. Double it up. What's hurting me? What's happening? The game

737
02:41:43,299 --> 02:41:48,819
is so broken. If you die really fast, it doesn't matter. Mr. President, you're too nervous.

738
02:41:48,819 --> 02:41:54,709
You've lost the first step. The faster you die, if I'm going to die, I need to get hit by like

739
02:41:54,709 --> 02:42:09,450
a thousand damage. Why is this taking so fucking long? I'm shooting the two rockets at the same

740
02:42:09,450 --> 02:42:15,049
time. 40%. I'm not going to do it. The U.S. military is being decimated.

741
02:42:17,850 --> 02:42:37,690
I got to use that. I need that thing to be charged now.

742
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:36,950
I know it takes forever to kill everything. I'm in. Let's go. Come on.

743
02:43:39,620 --> 02:44:09,399
The POWs you rescued. They were struggling. Shoot it. Okay.

744
02:44:11,209 --> 02:44:22,860
Go. The army has been completely vaporized. Metal Wolf, your cruelty won't go unpunished.

745
02:44:22,860 --> 02:44:32,340
Open the door. I have. That's the super thing. Open the door, please. Why does it take this long?

746
02:44:32,340 --> 02:45:02,059
How do I? Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Justice. Range. Oh, fuck. I forgot that game's

747
02:45:02,059 --> 02:45:18,010
like no longer relevant right now. It's not 2016. Shit. Come on. It's almost done. Got it.

748
02:45:18,010 --> 02:45:36,309
You could seize the area. Under military orders, the soldiers blew up the Alcatraz cannon.

749
02:45:36,309 --> 02:45:41,590
Simply amazing. Clap for me. In real life. The U.S. military gets the job done no matter what.

750
02:45:41,590 --> 02:45:47,110
You better all be doing this. Better double check his back. Today, once again,

751
02:45:47,670 --> 02:45:54,229
U.S. military forces were dealt a lethal blow by Metal Wolf. But thanks to these heroes in our

752
02:45:54,229 --> 02:45:59,750
military, Metal Wolf and his conspiracy have been held in check. Our hearts go out to the men and

753
02:45:59,750 --> 02:46:05,510
women who sacrificed their lives in battle and to their families as well. Any further reporting

754
02:46:05,510 --> 02:46:11,829
is too dangerous. Our news team is seeking refuge. Be the first to know as we continue pursuing

755
02:46:11,829 --> 02:46:19,030
Metal Wolf because yes, the pen is still mightier than the sword. This has been Peter McDonald for

756
02:46:19,030 --> 02:46:28,659
DNA. It's exhausting to listen to. What the hell? But at least the west coast is safe now.

757
02:46:28,659 --> 02:46:34,180
Yeah, that helicopter was a toy. Mr. President. It reminds me of old Star Wars movies when they

758
02:46:34,180 --> 02:46:47,639
used the real models, the real miniatures. A, E, D, D. I'll get a C. No, I won't. $70,000,

759
02:46:47,639 --> 02:46:55,860
$80,000. I got some scientists. All right. Brought peace to the west coast and gave the

760
02:46:55,860 --> 02:47:00,180
resistance a new momentum. But Richard Hawke's messaging continued to have a stronghold on the

761
02:47:00,180 --> 02:47:06,659
American people. Destroy Metal Wolf, we cried along like hysterical. Brainwash children.

762
02:47:06,659 --> 02:47:11,059
And that ignorant chorus became the battle hymn of our presence. In time, we would be made

763
02:47:11,059 --> 02:47:16,500
painfully aware of just the line we were. By the way, Jody, what happened with yesterday's email?

764
02:47:18,139 --> 02:47:22,459
The information management department succeeded in contacting the source of the email.

765
02:47:23,909 --> 02:47:31,639
Really? Let me hear it. Inform the resistance to put a stop to Richard Hawke and his recklessness.

766
02:47:31,639 --> 02:47:36,920
Is this me talking? Right now, I'm aiming for a united uprising and seek volunteers.

767
02:47:37,639 --> 02:47:44,760
What about those events? Metal Wolf, we eagerly await your rampage. Great. They haven't sold out

768
02:47:44,760 --> 02:47:54,979
hope yet. Mr. President, I haven't been this happy since... My anniversary. My birthday.

769
02:47:55,860 --> 02:48:00,260
When I got the job. When I went down a really tall water slide. When I went down the rollercoaster.

770
02:48:00,260 --> 02:48:07,700
Since that supermarket going out of business sale. When I was searching for my favorite candy and...

771
02:48:08,500 --> 02:48:19,319
They had a... It was 60% off and I got to buy like 10 boxes of it. And I ran into a celebrity

772
02:48:19,319 --> 02:48:27,059
and we had a conversation. I found the last at the back of the... And the expiration date was still

773
02:48:27,059 --> 02:48:31,700
good. I know the feeling, Jody. Sure, Mr. President. Oh yeah, I know the feeling.

774
02:48:32,739 --> 02:48:45,270
All right, let's go to the Grand Canyon. Operating out of a massive helicopter base

775
02:48:45,270 --> 02:48:50,950
constructed in the Grand Canyon, enemy continue to oppress the American west.

776
02:48:51,590 --> 02:48:57,030
The target area terrain is sure to be confusingly fierce because the enemy army has taken over

777
02:48:57,030 --> 02:49:02,950
guerrilla bases from the Arizona insurrection days. Please watch your step so you don't fall into the

778
02:49:02,950 --> 02:49:07,110
one mile deep ravine. I'm gonna die here like three times. Use artillery with long range firing

779
02:49:07,110 --> 02:49:12,549
effectively and destroy all the target areas. Long range. This mission goes by the call name...

780
02:49:14,069 --> 02:49:14,870
Don't look down.

781
02:49:26,280 --> 02:49:31,450
Next week. These are all next week on X anime.

782
02:49:39,850 --> 02:50:01,940
That also is a next week anime. All right, let's do... I need range here.

783
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:06,579
I'm gonna do... I'm doing it. It's insanely expensive but I'm going for it.

784
02:50:07,540 --> 02:50:12,629
The ml14 jaw. That's all I... I can't do anything else.

785
02:50:14,709 --> 02:50:22,729
This thing... $46,000. 1820 damage. That's pretty damn good.

786
02:50:31,979 --> 02:50:43,530
Lock on speed F. They're all F. What's the range? B? That's not that. What? I need

787
02:50:44,170 --> 02:51:05,639
speed. Yeah, I know. I need range. S. I'm gonna get two of these. I want one in each hand. So ham ham.

788
02:51:10,229 --> 02:51:15,110
Uh, what? This is... this range is terrible. So I'm gonna replace this with something that has

789
02:51:15,110 --> 02:51:19,750
better range. I'm not sure I have anything that has better range. I guess I do.

790
02:51:21,500 --> 02:51:26,889
Yeah. I want the interceptor. That works really well. The range on this is

791
02:51:26,889 --> 02:51:39,129
absolutely terrible. I mean, I guess I just do... Sniper? Just because. I guess. It's got range.

792
02:51:40,090 --> 02:51:55,370
Okay. All right. Let's go. Begin.

793
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:19,860
No. I don't know.

794
02:52:21,690 --> 02:52:30,700
All right. Let's rock and roll. So I need a range for this. Why? Mr. President,

795
02:52:30,700 --> 02:52:35,420
the view certainly is grand. But stop with the don't look down joke, please.

796
02:52:37,100 --> 02:52:51,530
I made one of those before we even started the level. Didn't take it out. I'm gonna say how.

797
02:52:52,489 --> 02:52:59,450
She just did a minus two here. I... yeah. I know. That's what I'm saying.

798
02:52:59,450 --> 02:53:33,100
Okay. So it's under here? Underneath? I don't know. Come on. Tap it. Oh, that was actually

799
02:53:33,100 --> 02:53:52,440
pretty cool. That was cool. There's the target over there. Get double ham on this. It's not even ham,

800
02:53:52,440 --> 02:54:18,620
but... Can I fly over this? Oh, shit. Hold on. Get it. Come on. Hit it.

801
02:54:24,659 --> 02:54:33,500
So now I have to go across this. I can go over there though, right? I hope so. You're gonna make

802
02:54:33,500 --> 02:55:02,440
it? Go free. I need boost for this. I don't want to fuck this up. I want double ham. Oh,

803
02:55:02,440 --> 02:55:06,360
okay. I was not holding down space. I should shift. I don't know. I died. That's not,

804
02:55:06,360 --> 02:55:24,840
that's not worth dying for that. Get rid of the chopper. Scientists to maintain helicopters.

805
02:55:25,399 --> 02:55:36,549
That's what you're saying? How was I only hitting one person?

806
02:55:51,340 --> 02:56:05,159
What a stupid way to say that. Shoot it. Shoot it. This interceptor is so good. How did I ever

807
02:56:05,159 --> 02:56:36,920
live without this? Oh! They're dead. They're dead. Double ham. Oh, you can just ride them

808
02:56:36,920 --> 02:57:08,739
to him too. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're me? No. You're me. Lock on. Go hard. There's

809
02:57:08,739 --> 02:57:31,299
somebody that can react harder. Go harder. P-hugger. React more? That shit is so fucking

810
02:57:31,299 --> 02:57:56,739
ridiculous. I want more reactions. Be louder. Talk louder. He actually wants that. Oh, boss?

811
02:58:04,729 --> 02:58:08,819
Oh, great. It's a helicopter.

812
02:58:22,409 --> 02:58:25,370
Well, I'm keeping out the interceptor. No doubt.

813
02:58:27,510 --> 02:58:51,500
Oh, yeah. Are you kidding me? Shit. I look more into this fucking thing, aren't I?

814
02:58:53,530 --> 02:59:34,739
Oh, God. He dies before that happens. That was so easy. Oh, my God. I didn't even have to play

815
02:59:34,739 --> 02:59:43,670
the game. I thought it was just a mini-boss, guys. That wasn't the real thing. Just a mini-boss.

816
02:59:44,629 --> 03:00:17,850
I only have rockets. I just don't love rockets. Look down. There's still stuff over there that I

817
03:00:17,850 --> 03:01:03,559
gotta get across the way. Where? Where is this thing? Where? Where is this? Oh, it's above.

818
03:01:03,559 --> 03:01:13,639
How do I get up there? Just shoot? Just shoot it? Just take out the bridge?

819
03:01:13,639 --> 03:02:03,350
The chat is more entertaining with Jupiter than with me. I guarantee it. Oh, I am going.

820
03:02:03,350 --> 03:02:11,770
All right. What did you get for having fun in chat? Yeah, you guys are funny. You guys are fun.

821
03:02:12,489 --> 03:02:20,579
The game's not in what you like. You know, just have fun. Just chill. Talk. Talk to each other.

822
03:02:20,579 --> 03:02:28,680
Communicate with each other. It's pretty fun. It's fun enough to play. You know, communicate.

823
03:02:29,479 --> 03:02:41,420
Down to the Colorado River. Double ham. The defense strength is high against live ammunition.

824
03:02:42,940 --> 03:03:01,930
Stay behind the wall. That's an instant death if I get to by this.

825
03:03:03,049 --> 03:03:38,780
I guarantee. You guys need to be communicating. Still live? I'm shooting them out of the air.

826
03:03:38,780 --> 03:04:08,120
This drama is short and bald for anybody else. Like, your TV's fucked up. Come on.

827
03:04:09,479 --> 03:04:26,860
Got it. I'm just not going to put up with it anymore, you know?

828
03:04:27,819 --> 03:04:33,739
Why would I do that? I can say, hey.

829
03:04:45,899 --> 03:04:46,700
How is that possible?

830
03:04:49,690 --> 03:04:52,309
Yeah, I'm just not going to stand for it anymore.

831
03:04:55,909 --> 03:04:58,950
Yeah, no, you're not going to stand. Because you have to stand to be able to see.

832
03:05:00,149 --> 03:05:38,489
Not ideal, but I'm good. I missed the old drama that played Hearthstone an hour ago.

833
03:05:38,809 --> 03:05:41,049
The enemy has been annihilated.

834
03:05:41,049 --> 03:05:43,670
Now I'm turning it over to relief. No more Hearthstone.

835
03:05:43,670 --> 03:05:49,430
Easily brought to Arizona. It really doesn't suit these lovely surroundings.

836
03:05:52,889 --> 03:05:58,280
Jodie, nor someone as lovely as you.

837
03:05:59,610 --> 03:06:02,409
Sure, whatever. Nice work, Mr. President.

838
03:06:03,290 --> 03:06:24,069
What the hell are you talking about? S-B-C-D-A. First A. $200,000. Nice.

839
03:06:29,299 --> 03:06:32,420
Victory in the Grand Canyon proved to be significant. Without the enemy helicopter

840
03:06:32,420 --> 03:06:36,180
squadron to pin them down, the resistance fighters were able to continue their march.

841
03:06:36,819 --> 03:06:39,219
Peace had returned to Arizona, where folks came up with the saying,

842
03:06:39,219 --> 03:06:43,299
where there's a Wilson, there's a way. The man they had mocked as a rebel army major

843
03:06:43,299 --> 03:06:47,059
had elevated himself to presidential standing again, and people were starting to believe

844
03:06:47,059 --> 03:06:49,940
this man had a chance. DNN correspondent Peter McDonald.

845
03:06:50,739 --> 03:06:55,850
Any word from the resistance? Yes, I'll play it for you now.

846
03:06:56,729 --> 03:07:01,540
Wolf, we applaud and appreciate your efforts.

847
03:07:02,420 --> 03:07:07,159
Our leadership has started to rise one brave soul at a time.

848
03:07:07,159 --> 03:07:12,120
You got it! The efforts and our activities,

849
03:07:12,120 --> 03:07:15,239
hoping that the day we revolt will come soon.

850
03:07:15,239 --> 03:07:22,739
I'd like to see that day too. Yeah.

851
03:07:25,299 --> 03:07:29,129
I feel like a mother hen. Okay, Mr. President,

852
03:07:29,129 --> 03:07:33,450
you best hurry and get to the next battle theater. Battle theater?

853
03:07:34,409 --> 03:07:40,709
All right, Phoenix. What's over here? Oh, right, I did that. All right, let's do Phoenix.

854
03:07:41,750 --> 03:07:47,379
The enemy force is apparently carrying out co-campaigns based in a ghost town in the

855
03:07:47,379 --> 03:07:50,100
Phoenix suburbs. I feel like a mother hen.

856
03:07:50,979 --> 03:07:52,739
I feel like a mother hen. This is the voice.

857
03:07:54,100 --> 03:07:57,620
I could have done a much better job. I feel like a mother hen.

858
03:07:58,420 --> 03:08:03,079
I feel like a mother hen. No, that's not good.

859
03:08:03,079 --> 03:08:13,270
The Raider's fleet. This mission goes by the convoy operation.

860
03:08:14,149 --> 03:08:18,549
I liked it. I thought it was good too. Good luck and godspeed, Mr. President.

861
03:08:22,649 --> 03:08:26,010
All right, you want me to develop some multi-missiles?

862
03:08:27,049 --> 03:08:33,000
Let's take a look. Multi-missile launcher. That's expensive to start.

863
03:08:35,510 --> 03:08:41,020
MMLA. Let's do it again. Again.

864
03:08:44,059 --> 03:08:49,659
MMLA-QLS. Do it again. No, I want some money left over.

865
03:08:49,659 --> 03:08:58,069
MMLA-QLS. What are you talking about? Check this pole. What pole?

866
03:08:59,110 --> 03:09:04,889
Check the pole. What do you mean the pole? What are you guys trying to say? What are you

867
03:09:04,889 --> 03:09:16,180
trying to say? What are you saying? Pole, pole, pole. I'm not going back to play that.

868
03:09:16,180 --> 03:09:20,659
What do you mean should I go back and play? We don't go back. We go forward.

869
03:09:21,459 --> 03:09:43,530
No, we already had a chance with that game and it's over. We go forward. Go back and play the

870
03:09:43,610 --> 03:09:54,840
acid game. No way. No, you guys got to sleep in this bed. I was told, get out of this.

871
03:09:56,120 --> 03:10:09,129
I don't like this. Next, next, next. We didn't ask for this. Oh, yes, you did.

872
03:10:09,930 --> 03:10:13,610
I did a poll before the stream started. This is like 80% of people said to play this one.

873
03:10:14,489 --> 03:10:18,780
I was told to play this one. This one's episode is from Toby at the beginning of the stream.

874
03:10:21,659 --> 03:10:25,180
All right, let me look and see what these do. Look, you guys just like talk to each other,

875
03:10:25,180 --> 03:10:39,260
communicate with each other. This is just better. Is there another one? Why is it level three?

876
03:10:40,459 --> 03:10:51,879
I'll give it a try. I'm going to get two of them. I also wanted to do,

877
03:10:55,260 --> 03:11:01,299
it was a couple of these that I wanted, right? No, no, no, this one here, the SG, this one.

878
03:11:02,180 --> 03:11:10,899
It's expensive. It's good though. Bazookas. I didn't need, I had another one of these too.

879
03:11:15,540 --> 03:11:19,860
Range B, starting capacity, high explosive rockets. I'll try this one.

880
03:11:25,860 --> 03:11:33,540
You guys just have to talk to each other, you know? I can't get this one. It's all right.

881
03:11:36,940 --> 03:11:44,090
La Cranda, thanks for the $50. 5000 bits from La Cranda. Thank you so much for the huge amount

882
03:11:44,090 --> 03:12:00,329
of money. And they say, uh, do something funny like the acid game. Guaranteed. Oh, it is too.

883
03:12:03,239 --> 03:12:11,799
Playing that game. That double hand is still fine. I don't want this anymore.

884
03:12:12,680 --> 03:12:20,739
Did I get the flamethrower? No, I need the, uh, the interceptor. Interceptor and,

885
03:12:21,780 --> 03:12:35,260
I mean, are you a furry? I, you know, that's, but I don't care. All right. I'm ready. Save the game.

886
03:12:36,520 --> 03:12:42,700
Stream's not bopping anymore. Yes, it is. This stream is bopping right now.

887
03:12:45,690 --> 03:12:50,250
Look, let me, let me play my game that I want to play. I want to play this fun game.

888
03:12:51,129 --> 03:12:58,889
You're becoming unruly and we're in the wild west. Like a town in an old western,

889
03:13:00,600 --> 03:13:07,319
a radar jamming station is located here. The number of target areas and enemies seem limited.

890
03:13:07,319 --> 03:13:11,559
If you have to say something bopping, that means it's not bopping. I know that's true.

891
03:13:12,440 --> 03:13:16,920
That's like you throw a party. You hire like a DJ and you have a big space. You rent out like a

892
03:13:16,920 --> 03:13:25,239
club for a night and the DJ is playing, just spinning records. Sounds awesome. It's you,

893
03:13:25,239 --> 03:13:29,319
your best friend and like one or two other people that actually accepted and went to the Facebook

894
03:13:29,319 --> 03:13:33,399
invite. There's nobody else there. And you're like walking around like, this is pretty sick, huh?

895
03:13:34,200 --> 03:13:39,000
This is bopping. You've tarnished the good name of the U.S. military

896
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:43,399
and your reputation as a hero. And now you'll die for it.

897
03:13:44,600 --> 03:13:56,489
Whatever. Am I going to play this for the rest of the night? I don't know. Once I get like done

898
03:13:56,489 --> 03:14:00,010
with it or bored with it, maybe we'll do something else. Maybe we'll do something else. I don't know.

899
03:14:00,010 --> 03:14:09,690
Wanna find out who gets to play Wyatt Earp? Here we go. We got Paul, Randy and Shaq.

900
03:14:10,489 --> 03:14:21,299
Uh, I don't even know who they are.

901
03:14:25,510 --> 03:14:58,469
Paul. Hey, what's up? I'm out of missiles. How is that possible? Who's this guy?

902
03:15:02,500 --> 03:15:10,860
Stomp, for God's sake, stomp. I don't know where he's going to play this for another four hours.

903
03:15:12,760 --> 03:15:14,600
I don't think I'm even going to scream for another four hours.

904
03:15:15,319 --> 03:15:20,469
Hey, sir, you're corrupt. You were never. He's to relax.

905
03:15:23,059 --> 03:15:27,139
There's no victory for a man who loses his pride. Have you had enough?

906
03:15:27,860 --> 03:15:35,819
But I put you out of your misery now. All right. Right now I may as well be loaded into like a TV

907
03:15:35,819 --> 03:15:40,860
show. Like I'm just watching it on my screen over on the right. It's like a radio show.

908
03:15:40,860 --> 03:15:45,899
Roger that. Leave the good stuff for me. This is like a daytime drama.

909
03:15:45,899 --> 03:15:51,340
The best medicine for that kind of headache is pumping it full of a heavy dose of lead.

910
03:15:52,219 --> 03:16:04,739
I think it's all people that are saying, hey, dude, this game sucks. I don't think they know.

911
03:16:05,620 --> 03:16:13,379
This is from stop working. No, I meant to say, oh, fuck. No, I have to like every one of those.

912
03:16:15,219 --> 03:16:32,170
That's all right. I like it, I think. Dude, who made this fucking shitty game? It sucks.

913
03:16:32,170 --> 03:16:42,809
So it's fucking stupid from software. What I meant to say was, oh, whoops. It's not my thing.

914
03:16:42,809 --> 03:16:56,500
It's not my kind of game. I don't think. No, I'm right in front of you, dude.

915
03:17:10,059 --> 03:17:11,020
Maybe it's not for me.

916
03:17:11,020 --> 03:17:36,739
I don't even know where they are. My mini map is jammed.

917
03:17:42,790 --> 03:17:47,979
Oh, that's what's happening. I can't. I'm going to go around and display.

918
03:17:48,700 --> 03:17:53,819
You do rescue. He was forced to sing the blues for the truth. The defense strength is high

919
03:17:53,819 --> 03:17:57,340
against live ammunition. I probably should just go and kill the one of them.

920
03:18:04,180 --> 03:18:30,819
This thing is invisible. Going somewhere to destroy targets or something before I can

921
03:18:30,899 --> 03:18:39,370
probably like. Yeah, this thing is jamming. Installation is the best medicine for that

922
03:18:39,370 --> 03:18:44,809
kind of headache is pumping it full of a heavy dose of lead. Now, you're about to have a headache

923
03:18:44,809 --> 03:19:04,760
when you play this game. Summer morning were among the POWs you rescued. They were probably

924
03:19:04,760 --> 03:19:15,719
used to develop new type mobile unit armor. I don't come. I don't look. It's like if you come

925
03:19:15,719 --> 03:19:25,110
in the light. Never mind. As I say, like it might be a plain game. Like your brother comes in,

926
03:19:26,309 --> 03:19:34,629
friend comes in, sitting there like, hey, what are you playing? Oh, I'm playing Metal Wolf Chaos.

927
03:19:35,350 --> 03:19:43,319
Oh, cool. This game's stupid. OK, I think it's all right. I think it's kind of fun to kind of

928
03:19:43,319 --> 03:19:51,000
run around and just like kind of walk on. No, this game's bad. This game's stupid. Yeah. All

929
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:59,909
right, man. You want to go home or you want to stay? No, no, I'm gonna stay. OK. You want to go

930
03:19:59,909 --> 03:20:04,790
get food or something? No, I'm going to sit here and just tell you every five minutes that I hate

931
03:20:04,790 --> 03:20:15,180
this game and I don't like it. Why are you here? Why are you doing this to me? I don't know.

932
03:20:15,180 --> 03:20:21,819
What did I do? Are you upset with me? No, no, not at all. I think our friendship is very,

933
03:20:21,819 --> 03:20:41,270
very good. No, I think that too. Oh, and by the way, no, by the way, not only do I not like this,

934
03:20:41,270 --> 03:20:48,940
you're doing it wrong. Am I? Yeah, yeah, yeah. This game sucks and you're doing it wrong.

935
03:20:49,579 --> 03:20:53,100
I thought you didn't like this game. No, I don't. But you're doing it wrong and you're stupid and

936
03:20:53,100 --> 03:21:07,670
you're bad. Oh, and yeah, dude, by the way, I'm like back here right now. Kind of sitting behind

937
03:21:07,670 --> 03:21:25,750
you. You're bald as fuck. OK. Oh, are you sure we're friends? You're really bald today.

938
03:21:27,979 --> 03:21:32,059
I would like to call my mother and be like, Mom, can you come in here and like tell him to go home?

939
03:21:39,299 --> 03:21:42,969
All right, let's see if I can get through here. Get your pork chops ready.

940
03:21:54,739 --> 03:21:56,979
I don't know if it's just me, too, but there's like a smell on this room.

941
03:21:58,180 --> 03:22:02,889
Is that you? Is that your body? Your body smells. I've been sitting here for a while,

942
03:22:02,889 --> 03:22:14,149
dude. Maybe I am like, I don't know. OK, now that one I could forget because I mean,

943
03:22:14,149 --> 03:22:17,510
if you like smell bad, like you don't like it. Never mind. That one's fine.

944
03:22:19,940 --> 03:22:35,700
All right, let's go with the real deal here. Can you shoot him? Nice. One more of those.

945
03:22:44,069 --> 03:22:59,370
Diaper check. Diaper check. Hey, man, like, yeah, you having a good time by hanging over at my house?

946
03:22:59,930 --> 03:23:04,569
Yeah, yeah, I'm having a good time. I guess the game's not that bad or whatever. I just I like

947
03:23:04,569 --> 03:23:08,409
hanging out with you. I like, yeah, just like kind of hanging out with you, too. Yeah, it's

948
03:23:08,409 --> 03:23:13,450
fun to know what you're doing. You can be playing something, you can be eating something, hanging

949
03:23:13,450 --> 03:23:17,770
out. I like being I like when you're here, too. Oh, by the way, show me your diaper.

950
03:23:18,569 --> 03:23:29,750
Can I diaper check? No. What are you talking about? This is not fair, though, because this would be

951
03:23:32,629 --> 03:23:37,829
this is not fair because I did like shake around and pretend I had a diaper on. So like if I

952
03:23:38,790 --> 03:23:42,389
was if my friend was over and I'd like shook around and pretended to have a diaper on

953
03:23:42,389 --> 03:23:46,309
and then later on he was like, dude, diaper check. Come on. Like, what the fuck's going on here?

954
03:23:46,309 --> 03:24:02,579
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. He's just talking to himself at this point.

955
03:24:15,659 --> 03:24:18,540
I'm just like, manically talking to myself.

956
03:24:18,540 --> 03:24:22,700
It's personal personal payback for you betraying us. What the fuck is wrong with you?

957
03:24:34,950 --> 03:24:39,350
Special mobile armor units have been put six feet under town, Marshal.

958
03:24:40,149 --> 03:24:45,110
Feel to be an old west hero. I want to hear the claps, please.

959
03:24:46,409 --> 03:24:54,540
Not too good. I'm not the hero type. I'm just doing my job as president.

960
03:24:59,899 --> 03:25:25,100
I'm good on the chaos. Not much else. The precariously positioned Arizona resistance

961
03:25:25,100 --> 03:25:30,700
base had come under heavy fire from the two three trio of ultra mobile to armored suits.

962
03:25:30,700 --> 03:25:35,659
But when the dust settled the fires the resistance still burning. However, let us never forget the

963
03:25:35,659 --> 03:25:40,940
noble souls who perished under the name under the sun in President Wilson's name. But as we all know,

964
03:25:40,940 --> 03:25:45,260
the government has since built a road that stretches as far from the desert of Phoenix

965
03:25:45,260 --> 03:25:49,500
all the way to the East Coast, the Michael Wilson Highway straight as an arrow and serves as a

966
03:25:49,500 --> 03:25:54,299
reminder to keep our country on the path of righteousness and never become lost again.

967
03:25:55,579 --> 03:25:58,459
Jody, what's the situation on the ground across America?

968
03:25:59,819 --> 03:26:09,819
In the west, areas where the army is pulling out are on the nation. The situation isn't so good.

969
03:26:10,860 --> 03:26:18,420
Don't worry. I'll free the whole land soon enough. Any email from the resistance?

970
03:26:19,860 --> 03:26:23,139
Yes, sir. The man's voice is as cool as ever.

971
03:26:27,620 --> 03:26:32,040
Wolf, thank you. Our membership is steadily

972
03:26:32,040 --> 03:26:35,879
more reliable. Trustworthy sympathizers have joined our fight to revolt.

973
03:26:39,270 --> 03:26:44,870
The day will come soon. When we're ready to rise up, I'll be sure and let you know.

974
03:26:44,870 --> 03:26:51,530
Anything but tear lists. The resistance leader sure. I'm playing this for like another 30 minutes.

975
03:26:52,409 --> 03:26:57,799
Tough as nails. I was going to stop after about 30, 40 more minutes. So that sounds fun.

976
03:26:57,799 --> 03:27:09,979
Now I'll head out to liberate the west. I think I'm going to get a major boss fight here. That's why

977
03:27:10,620 --> 03:27:14,940
I want to wait. The enemy forces strengthening their suppression of Beverly. While the number

978
03:27:14,940 --> 03:27:20,219
of soldiers equipped with heavy firearms is great, if you pay higher attention to their attacks,

979
03:27:20,219 --> 03:27:28,219
there are no threat to your mobile articles in this battle theater are violent. Consider the

980
03:27:28,219 --> 03:27:33,500
advantages and disadvantages and the geographical features as you destroy all the target areas in

981
03:27:33,500 --> 03:27:38,459
the town. It's been an hour and a heart stone joke. 30 minutes actually. This mission goes by the

982
03:27:38,459 --> 03:27:54,809
call name to fashion back to the street. It's a weird name for a little art. Invest in

983
03:27:56,940 --> 03:28:07,239
probably another, a better assault rifle. I like the assault rifles. The SB and missile launchers.

984
03:28:07,239 --> 03:28:22,360
I can't, I'm not going to look for it. What should I do? Probably save the money.

985
03:28:23,319 --> 03:28:32,540
All right. If I buy this, I won't be able to afford the new, uh, no, go back into that one.

986
03:28:32,540 --> 03:28:47,719
Let me see. Try to do two of these assault rifles. If I stun rounds, that doesn't sound very good.

987
03:28:47,719 --> 03:28:53,159
Stun rounds. What's that good against? 80 damage, 200 capacity. This thing's terrible. What does it

988
03:28:53,159 --> 03:29:04,760
do? Try to buy one of these. That's a lot of money. Non-legal. Does non-legal mean anything?

989
03:29:05,719 --> 03:29:25,930
It doesn't sound like I want that. What is this FIFA 08 music? I don't know. You tell me.

990
03:29:30,889 --> 03:29:36,299
You guys, it's, I can't even, I can't even right now. You guys are too much.

991
03:29:37,579 --> 03:29:47,379
You guys are too much for me to handle right now. I like this. All right. Get it together. I can,

992
03:29:47,379 --> 03:29:57,579
I'm fine. I want the big one. You always want at least, you want two different types of each hand.

993
03:29:57,899 --> 03:30:03,579
That's fine. Double ham, but I'm going to replace this with a different missile launcher here.

994
03:30:06,659 --> 03:30:14,629
Yeah, this one here is fine. All right. Looks good. Let's go. Boss time.

995
03:30:19,260 --> 03:30:23,260
Enemy explosive devices are planted all over the city of Beverly Hills.

996
03:30:24,219 --> 03:30:31,399
Destroy all the bombs and liberate the town. Can you tell the Kim shits the bed story again?

997
03:30:32,360 --> 03:30:38,620
Just go rewind like an hour and a half. This is DNN's Peter McDonald reporting.

998
03:30:39,180 --> 03:30:43,579
What you're looking at is the heinous terrorist metal wolf as seen from the air.

999
03:30:44,620 --> 03:30:50,940
Just what will become of Beverly Hills and its stately mansions with a street smell of money.

1000
03:30:50,940 --> 03:30:58,840
Stay tuned as this camera and I bring you all the news you want to know. Not him again.

1001
03:30:59,639 --> 03:31:07,239
Embed that journalist in the ground. Forget him and keep your mind on the mission, Mr. President.

1002
03:31:07,879 --> 03:31:11,719
This is a reverse meltdown. Bombs have been laid out all over town.

1003
03:31:11,719 --> 03:31:18,760
Reverse meltdown is like, I can't handle it right now. All right. Let's try this missile.

1004
03:31:19,559 --> 03:31:25,049
I like it. That's a lot of damage. Takes a long time to reload. Let's go.

1005
03:31:25,690 --> 03:31:27,139
I love this thing.

1006
03:31:31,620 --> 03:31:32,340
That's a lot of people.

1007
03:31:49,979 --> 03:31:54,139
That's good damage. I'm going to keep my eye out for other ships.

1008
03:31:54,139 --> 03:31:54,860
Oh, okay.

1009
03:31:54,860 --> 03:31:59,899
The metal wolf has annihilated the troops and plans to capture Beverly Hills.

1010
03:31:59,899 --> 03:32:04,540
His end game must be money. This could be the world's biggest heist.

1011
03:32:04,540 --> 03:32:09,239
It was Norton. It could be.

1012
03:32:12,100 --> 03:32:17,620
If approached carelessly, it will detonate. Destroy it from a safe distance.

1013
03:32:20,090 --> 03:32:28,069
Safe distance. Where is it? It's right there.

1014
03:32:28,069 --> 03:32:30,709
Some scientists were among the POWs you rescued.

1015
03:32:30,709 --> 03:32:33,510
They were used to develop new weapons for the military.

1016
03:32:34,149 --> 03:32:37,190
Oh, that takes that. Okay. That's some huge. All right. Whatever.

1017
03:32:38,629 --> 03:32:45,479
Missiles. I'm on missiles. Bad.

1018
03:32:50,010 --> 03:32:54,409
Oh, this looks promising. The pride of the U.S. military.

1019
03:32:54,409 --> 03:32:56,649
Blackhawks raise their ugly heads.

1020
03:32:58,170 --> 03:33:01,260
Are they shooting? Let's go. Hurry up. Get out of here.

1021
03:33:13,110 --> 03:33:18,340
Bomb? It's driving into me. What are you talking about?

1022
03:33:29,559 --> 03:33:33,059
Closer. Come on. Get in there.

1023
03:33:54,059 --> 03:33:54,940
Another bomb behind.

1024
03:33:57,989 --> 03:33:59,530
Don't get too close.

1025
03:34:03,219 --> 03:34:07,700
I wonder if the vice president wants to go as far as to control the music in America.

1026
03:34:11,780 --> 03:34:21,659
That would be odd. How many bombs are there? Two more? Three more?

1027
03:34:29,989 --> 03:34:45,299
Good. Good work. Good.

1028
03:34:47,219 --> 03:34:49,959
Oh, but how many bullets left in that thing?

1029
03:34:51,159 --> 03:35:01,430
Is it going to explode? Nice work, President Jerva.

1030
03:35:01,430 --> 03:35:16,760
Can I shoot through that? I couldn't even have done that if I tried.

1031
03:35:17,559 --> 03:35:19,319
Dude, I did it again. How is that possible?

1032
03:35:29,770 --> 03:35:36,440
What the fuck is happening? Go. I don't know why it's doing that.

1033
03:35:48,739 --> 03:36:04,469
Bomb. I'll get it. Is this a bomb? Got it.

1034
03:36:04,469 --> 03:36:09,340
Any more? I don't think there's many more.

1035
03:36:09,340 --> 03:36:13,540
Oh, I guess I'm in fourth. Is that enough? No, it's on SG.

1036
03:36:19,340 --> 03:36:36,440
Oh, check this one out. Bingo.

1037
03:36:37,559 --> 03:36:53,459
Oh, good. YouTuber and streamer 101.

1038
03:36:54,420 --> 03:36:58,260
I'm looking for something to do, per se, when you don't have anything to say at all.

1039
03:36:58,260 --> 03:37:02,100
And you're just playing a game? Use short, quick adjectives.

1040
03:37:03,299 --> 03:37:10,360
Like, you got it. Bingo. Take on that one. Nice.

1041
03:37:16,760 --> 03:37:20,899
Huge. Get smoked.

1042
03:37:28,389 --> 03:37:34,549
Whatever they are. Advert.

1043
03:37:37,290 --> 03:37:41,360
Cute.

1044
03:37:58,299 --> 03:38:00,780
Don't worry about his yammering commentary.

1045
03:38:02,219 --> 03:38:07,719
See? Listen to her. Don't listen to my yammering commentary.

1046
03:38:07,719 --> 03:38:11,159
Just listen to my one line that I say every three minutes.

1047
03:38:12,840 --> 03:38:19,610
All right. Is that not it? What more shit to do?

1048
03:38:20,489 --> 03:38:28,709
What are the bombs that I'm not destroying? Cute.

1049
03:38:40,010 --> 03:38:43,450
M? Oh, damn. Okay. I gotta go this way.

1050
03:38:54,540 --> 03:38:58,379
Shit. I'm gonna be thinking about that now. Got it. Boom.

1051
03:38:59,100 --> 03:39:10,840
Fuck. It's that I'm concentrating and, like, I have nothing to say because I'm concentrating.

1052
03:39:10,840 --> 03:39:14,790
International superstar. Money, money, money, money.

1053
03:39:14,790 --> 03:39:19,270
What business does Metal Wolf have with a 3.2 billion dollar man?

1054
03:39:19,270 --> 03:39:24,170
Maybe he's going to take out a loan. Oh, man, he's destroying the mansion.

1055
03:39:24,170 --> 03:39:27,930
Add destruction of personal property to the breaking and entering charges.

1056
03:39:27,930 --> 03:39:32,649
The U.S. Constitution is downright powerless against Metal Wolf's evil.

1057
03:39:55,940 --> 03:39:58,899
Get that radar gun, please. It's messing up my game.

1058
03:40:03,610 --> 03:40:05,909
Watch it.

1059
03:40:11,510 --> 03:40:12,549
Why did that not happen?

1060
03:40:15,500 --> 03:40:25,370
What planet are you from? Wait, are those?

1061
03:40:26,090 --> 03:40:26,809
Yes, they were.

1062
03:40:29,510 --> 03:40:37,770
Oops. It's okay. I thought it was a bomb. I thought it was a bomb.

1063
03:40:37,770 --> 03:40:45,139
It was, but I didn't, you know, I just messed up. Sometimes you mess up. It's okay.

1064
03:40:49,239 --> 03:40:55,370
Metal Wolf has control of the entire town. Any further reporting is too dangerous.

1065
03:40:55,370 --> 03:41:00,569
Our news team is seeking refuge, but our coverage of these events will continue

1066
03:41:01,209 --> 03:41:06,569
because, yes, the pen is still mighty. I hate this thing. Get this fucking like

1067
03:41:06,569 --> 03:41:10,409
Paw Patrol looking thing the fuck out of here. It's annoying me now.

1068
03:41:11,610 --> 03:41:20,260
Wealthy fat cats will repair the damage, making their homes even more beautiful than before.

1069
03:41:20,260 --> 03:41:30,360
Nice work, Mr. President. That one was pretty good. It was all right.

1070
03:41:31,159 --> 03:41:40,020
I did that pretty cleanly. Yeah, I'm only studying for one test.

1071
03:41:40,979 --> 03:41:45,059
All right, so now that should open up. I've done all the ones that are on the map.

1072
03:41:45,059 --> 03:41:48,180
I think we're going to get our first major boss storyline boss.

1073
03:42:12,360 --> 03:42:17,639

wasn't built in a day good news finally finally the evil has been crushed this evening finally

1095
03:45:18,969 --> 03:45:24,969
metal wolf who suddenly showed up in new york was thoroughly beaten to a pulp by

1096
03:45:26,250 --> 03:45:34,250
richard hawke piloting a special heavy mobile armor unit he annihilated the evil

1097
03:45:35,530 --> 03:45:43,239
occurring at the same time from a confidential covert operation we have also learned that

1098
03:45:43,239 --> 03:45:49,959
underground terrorists and metal wolf sympathizers in hiding were captured

1099
03:45:49,959 --> 03:45:57,579
in succession all around the country although martial law will continue until we are sure that

1100

we've lost contact with the resistance leader too we have it appears all the resistance activities

1108
03:47:00,500 --> 03:47:11,139
have gone south jodie those that died are imposters i am still here so believe in your own justice

1109
03:47:11,139 --> 03:47:15,379
did she not think that she was talking to me i won't lose to that false prophet

1110
03:47:16,420 --> 03:47:22,260
and the reason is because i'm the president of the united states of america

1111
03:47:23,459 --> 03:47:30,979
mr president there's no time for self-pity jodie get me up to speed on the situation in the east

1112
03:47:32,500 --> 03:47:37,030
oh my god waging war against more than just the resistance the american people too came

1113
03:47:37,110 --> 03:47:41,829
fire hawk called it the citizen citizen reeducation program this friend revolved

1114
03:47:41,829 --> 03:47:45,590
private property to a government-controlled rationing system your citizens were trafficked

1115
03:47:45,590 --> 03:47:49,829
overseas where he uses lab rats and weapons testing that's probably ridiculous the week and

1116
03:47:49,829 --> 03:47:53,030
i'm with her we're trampled down soon all of america and its bedrooms were paved over by

1117
03:47:53,030 --> 03:48:00,979
thick oppressive asphalt tyranny it was hawks eugenic wet dream and an unprecedented constitutional

1118
03:48:00,979 --> 03:48:04,819
crisis what else is the next chapter president wilson's saga as he continued to rise up against

1119
03:48:04,819 --> 03:48:20,920
his former running mate's injustices let's go this is new york my houston chicago let's check

1120
03:48:20,920 --> 03:48:26,840
out chicago the enemy force has concentrated strength in the center of chicago intelligence's

1121
03:48:26,840 --> 03:48:31,879
most educated guess is that the purpose is to re-educate the citizens and strengthen their

1122
03:48:31,879 --> 03:48:37,559
support for the vice president though there are many target areas it is possible to annihilate

1123
03:48:38,120 --> 03:48:42,920
by effectively using the train to move from building to building jump on the train destroy

1124
03:48:42,920 --> 03:48:48,760
the target areas and let the citizens wake up to their town with its tranquil this mission goes by

1125
03:48:48,760 --> 03:48:58,139
the call name not for much longer this is probably the last mission i wanted to do at least the whole

1126
03:48:58,139 --> 03:49:02,780
west coast president because i was thinking maybe we'd see like somewhere like other than phoenix

1127
03:49:02,780 --> 03:49:11,930
you know maybe we get some like nevada somewhere i don't know like area 51 or something right i'm

1128
03:49:11,930 --> 03:49:20,180
sure that would be like making sense in this game with me sorry uh i do want to do like one more

1129
03:49:20,180 --> 03:49:35,370
though i want the best of the best which is not gonna have to look i want another tier of assault

1130
03:49:35,370 --> 03:49:51,530
rifle sg-552 lr i want another one there it is i got level six assault rifles let's check that

1131
03:49:51,530 --> 03:50:03,770
up let's see sg-52sb that's the stun one an advanced assault rifle with outstanding range 175

1132
03:50:03,770 --> 03:50:14,409
versus 170 pretty good then there's uh energy rounds that's pretty good 1800 capacity here's

1133
03:50:14,409 --> 03:50:19,690
the big one a supreme assault record with incredible range and firepower i don't quite

1134
03:50:19,690 --> 03:50:28,149
have enough to buy this but i'm gonna get the energy one all right so i'm gonna do one more

1135
03:50:28,149 --> 03:50:34,010
after this one what one more after this there is there is a dangerous level it's later on in the

1136
03:50:34,010 --> 03:50:47,579
game well we'll see how far we get so two more so three more so four more i'm actually gonna keep

1137
03:50:47,579 --> 03:50:58,870
that on but we're going to remove this and put on that new stuff let's move right here

1138
03:50:59,750 --> 03:51:32,780
yeah and get this on there too ham ham good so this is good save it enemy forces occupy chicago

1139
03:51:32,780 --> 03:51:37,340
just beat the game i don't know i think this is a lot longer than that target areas and liberate

1140
03:51:37,340 --> 03:51:47,799
the town of chicago copy that

1141
03:51:52,200 --> 03:51:59,719
well if it isn't the heinous terrorist public enemy number one richard oh you've done excellent

1142
03:51:59,719 --> 03:52:08,870
work michael how about a reward to show my appreciation the poison gas will annihilate

1143
03:52:08,870 --> 03:52:15,579
the city in five minutes and metal wolf will be blamed for the slaughter of chicago

1144
03:52:16,459 --> 03:52:20,459

oh i gotta do this fast right now then coming to you live from the skies over chicago this

1147
03:52:47,079 --> 03:52:54,280
is dnn's peter mcdonald using poison gas as his weapon of choice metal wolf seeks to obliterate

1148
03:52:54,280 --> 03:53:01,719
the city of chicago that powered definitely even cruelty has a limit look it up but rest assured

1149
03:53:01,719 --> 03:53:07,719
i have faith that the u.s military will put a stop to this that journalist is up to his old

1150

1152
03:53:44,059 --> 03:53:50,120
yes filled with poisonous gas neutralizers that soldiers must be tired of being left in such an

1153
03:53:50,120 --> 03:54:24,260
obvious place poison gas neutralizers or kill it are you still alive i gotta get up top poison gas

i saw shiny things in his life pick it up

1158
03:55:50,840 --> 03:55:58,139
oh no according to our own dnn human fatality density measuring device the density of poison

1159
03:55:58,139 --> 03:56:04,780
gas in the city has already exceeded 50 parts per million metal wolf is a villain down to his last

1160
03:56:04,780 --> 03:56:21,959
mecha bolt well these guys hurt so don't get up to 200 300 parts per million

1161
03:56:46,899 --> 03:56:56,899
is a symbol of the city and its rivers seeing it open is quite a sight but if we can't cross

i'm just gonna

1164
03:57:17,450 --> 03:57:21,909
things are going the gas will reach a fatal density in another three minutes

1165
03:57:21,909 --> 03:57:28,309
metal won't even give us enough time to make instant noodles that journalist is always a day

1166

1174
03:59:33,780 --> 03:59:48,760
no green no green don't see any green don't see any green density of the poison gas reaches fatal

1175
03:59:48,760 --> 04:00:19,129
limits no i'm trying what do you think i'm doing right now only one remains it's in here get out of

04:01:01,020 --> 04:01:09,059
an utter nightmare it's over chicago is shrouded in a mist of evil

1179
04:01:10,500 --> 04:01:19,350

04:02:17,940 --> 04:02:20,819
be tired if they let that out in such an obvious place

1184
04:02:23,299 --> 04:02:25,860
i think i gotta change something i gotta have something else to be on the other

1185
04:02:27,700 --> 04:02:33,780
don't even attack people just go take out the little canisters and get out of here

1186
04:02:34,979 --> 04:02:59,319

04:03:10,790 --> 04:03:32,280
go backwards

1189
04:03:33,559 --> 04:03:49,979
hey we're waiting worth using this you just have to use the slow missiles

1190
04:03:51,420 --> 04:04:23,190
let's get going right in the middle bang right any and i mean any boost

1191
04:04:24,149 --> 04:04:29,899
like the super movie oh why is it not building according to our own dnn human fatality density

1192
04:04:30,860 --> 04:04:35,979
the density of poison gas in the city has already exceeded 50 parts per million

1193
04:04:35,979 --> 04:04:39,420
metal wolf is a villain down to his last mecha bolt

1194
04:04:41,579 --> 04:05:11,379
oh shit i was in the explosion i didn't know it was that much explosion was gonna happen

1195
04:05:11,379 --> 04:05:23,000
look at this fucking fps on the mouse too by the way like oh my god enemy each target area has

1196
04:05:23,000 --> 04:05:29,959
started up their poison gas control if the density of the poison gas exceeds 181 parts per million

1197
04:05:29,959 --> 04:05:36,760
human death is guaranteed destroy the target areas before the density reaches 181 what's that

1198
04:05:41,209 --> 04:05:44,409
don't let down your guard hurry up mr president

1199
04:05:46,969 --> 04:06:00,299
oh god never say that again i'm gonna turn voice off in such an obvious place

1200
04:06:00,379 --> 04:06:27,100
i turned cutscenes off his crazy chin

1201
04:06:28,860 --> 04:07:27,799
i showed it why is it doing that mr president i'm trying don't die by the explosions here

1204
04:08:02,200 --> 04:08:18,760
happen again why can i fire the it's the energy gun that's why military only has three operating

1205
04:08:18,760 --> 04:08:34,139

1221
04:12:36,860 --> 04:12:45,530
i've just looked into the eyes of metal wolf any further reporting is too dangerous our news team

04:12:45,530 --> 04:12:51,930
is seeking refuge this guy but our coverage of these events will continue i hate this guy

1223
04:12:53,049 --> 04:13:00,010
he's the worst because yes the pen is still mightier than the sword this has been peter

1224
04:13:00,010 --> 04:13:09,290
mcdonald for dnn i'll say one thing for the guy at least his mis-reporting is consistent

1225
04:13:11,129 --> 04:13:20,889
as long as the city is safe who cares i hope he could just strangle him in the end

1226
04:13:21,850 --> 04:13:33,780

1231
04:14:29,670 --> 04:14:35,030
down let's go here the enemy army has dried up the nation's resources and put the people on a

1232
04:14:35,030 --> 04:14:39,750
rationing system to construct the space plane launch and landing that sounds pretty good is

1233
04:14:39,750 --> 04:14:51,940
gonna be a mcchicken stream absolutely react swiftly as paratrooper react harder predicted

1234
04:14:51,940 --> 04:14:57,299
to be dropped in from super assault heavy attack helicopters the objective is total destruction

1235
04:14:57,299 --> 04:15:04,649
of all target areas and the super assault heavy attack olajuwon have this mission goes by the

1236
04:15:04,649 --> 04:15:14,549
call name winner takes all olajuwon versus metal wool what's the best way to burn body to burn

1237
04:15:14,549 --> 04:15:35,420
body fat eat less food and move around here we go i did didn't i want to buy one of these new ones

1239
04:15:52,870 --> 04:16:05,180
sam let's take a look an advanced missile launcher intended for service to airstrikes

1240
04:16:06,139 --> 04:16:07,180
that's a lot of firepower

1241
04:16:09,930 --> 04:16:24,500
i'll give it a try this thing is good for panic oh shit moments

1242
04:16:25,620 --> 04:16:29,219
i like this combo although this is used to be the you know that's the best one i have

1243
04:16:29,219 --> 04:16:34,420
i can i can buy the other one but i haven't done it yet the two hams let's replace

1244

to you live today from a u.s military base in the outskirts of houston texas scarce natural

1248
04:17:08,389 --> 04:17:15,989
resources sent from the space plane center are collected and kept here the u.s military is

1249
04:17:15,989 --> 04:17:23,459
collectively managing these goods under martial law acting as the defense for this area is this

1250
04:17:23,459 --> 04:17:29,219
super assault heavy attack elijah one helicopter boston well my boston accents is is an act that's

1251
04:17:29,219 --> 04:17:38,020
pretending look at this firepower 44 millimeter m197 anti-aircraft guns 80 millimeter bow force

1252
04:17:38,020 --> 04:17:45,620
anti-aircraft cannons two 10 millimeter grenade launchers and finally 12 missile containers

1253
04:17:46,729 --> 04:17:52,010
in addition to this heavy arsenal it has the capacity to hold over a hundred soldiers

1254
04:17:53,770 --> 04:18:00,229
a veritable flying fortress as long as the elijah one is on the scene

1255
04:18:01,030 --> 04:18:04,790
metal wolf get off the winds here fly this little helicopter this little

1256
04:18:16,950 --> 04:18:19,829
that's a pretty good car drop sound effect

1257
04:18:31,239 --> 04:18:42,729
all right let's go what are those those must be some new kinds of weapons mines they're being

1258
04:18:42,729 --> 04:18:48,649
dropped one after another from the elijah one metal wolf will have no choice but to deal with

1259
04:18:48,649 --> 04:19:14,170
this firepower swap to our next group i got you sniper unit and the pride of the elite

1260
04:19:14,170 --> 04:19:21,770
power troopers snipers this is a scene of biblical proportions a modern day

1261
04:19:21,770 --> 04:19:26,409
david and goliath okay mr president well you know what happens like doesn't david win

1262
04:19:29,370 --> 04:19:32,250
david wins he throws a rock at the giant's face and hits him right the skull

1263
04:19:34,729 --> 04:19:48,819
right by reducing the strong attack that device seems to have improved the guidance

1264
04:19:48,819 --> 04:20:01,270
function performance of the Bible Bible spoilers all right sure

1265
04:20:04,149 --> 04:20:37,879
all right that does look pretty elite these things gotta go

1266
04:20:38,520 --> 04:20:49,219
oh

1267
04:20:58,979 --> 04:21:08,540
you get down here then you see what i'm dealing with i'm fighting everybody by myself i don't have

1268
04:21:08,540 --> 04:21:41,620
any help not as well all right all right that's it right just gotta go for him now i don't think so

1269
04:21:41,620 --> 04:21:58,040
so maybe i can ah what i guess i could it did take damage

1270
04:22:11,770 --> 04:22:21,159
it's getting a little bit closer i wonder these breach

1271
04:22:24,600 --> 04:22:43,430
let's get the sand i'm just gonna hang up back here is that not reaching why are these not

1272
04:22:43,430 --> 04:23:11,159
reaching what is trying to escape from the base

1273
04:23:24,889 --> 04:23:55,000
they got to kill these things just gotta do it um i guess maybe it has to lock on

1274
04:23:58,040 --> 04:24:08,010
let me try to clear these out these little like crabs you'll get close when there's no more left

1275
04:24:08,969 --> 04:25:12,649
going forward or backward it's apparently something behind over here i guess i have to

1276
04:25:12,649 --> 04:25:31,260
destroy this thing of course i was doing damage last radar and comes in in the way that you

1277
04:25:31,260 --> 04:25:44,680
destroyed his radars this is the only other target on the map

1278
04:25:45,639 --> 04:25:48,389
so

1279
04:25:50,870 --> 04:25:59,319
take a look at that all right the u.s ground forces have been totally decimated by the hand of metal

1280
04:25:59,319 --> 04:26:09,510
wolf but we still have the speed ace up our sleeve that trump card being the super assault heavy

1281
04:26:09,510 --> 04:26:14,549
attack elijah one helicopter that's the guy that announces that it's his turn

1282
04:26:15,670 --> 04:26:20,709
it's my turn he just that's the name of his attack rushes in and he goes like yeah

1283
04:26:22,069 --> 04:26:34,950
and then gets fucking knocked out of the air like you go like dash forward dead

1284
04:26:36,870 --> 04:26:42,469
that happens in every single cartoon doesn't matter if it's japanese anime or not

1285
04:26:42,469 --> 04:26:59,459
they could be an american anime cover and let's end the mission right now

1286
04:27:01,879 --> 04:27:06,440
the elijah one fuselage has been damaged the elijah one i don't know why it is great but

1287
04:27:06,440 --> 04:27:13,159
giving up is not in the u.s military's vocabulary and the reason is the super attack elijah one

1288
04:27:13,159 --> 04:27:19,079
helicopter is still in action how about destroying the launch me doors mr president first start by

1289
04:27:19,079 --> 04:27:27,530
reducing the strong attack how about i just kill it why didn't i just see elijah one's armor plating

1290
04:27:27,530 --> 04:27:35,530
has taken an awful beating the dreaded metal wolf fights like a demon on a rampage what's this

1291
04:27:36,889 --> 04:27:51,850
the super assault elijah one helicopter this aerial fortress has been destroyed by one single foe

1292
04:27:51,850 --> 04:28:00,010
dressed in mobile attack armor but i will never give up hope and hope will never yield to violence

1293
04:28:00,569 --> 04:28:09,129
i believe in american justice and my journalistic convictions because yes the pen is still mightier

1294
04:28:09,129 --> 04:28:19,909
than the sword this has been peter mcdonald for dnn hey mr journalist take a good long look i

1295
04:28:19,909 --> 04:28:44,620
think it's time for a new pen quick strangle before he gets away yeah 220 200 and 300 000

1296
04:28:45,659 --> 04:28:56,340
262 we're taking the space plane center president wilson put an end to hawks control the nation's

1297
04:28:56,340 --> 04:29:02,020
aerospace resources spoils were funneled to cities across america ending that rationing system

1298
04:29:03,290 --> 04:29:07,610
sea to shining sea freedom rang i saw the smiles on each of the american people's faces and i

1299
04:29:07,610 --> 04:29:13,129
started to wonder have i been getting this man all wrong jody what's the situation on the ground

1300
04:29:13,129 --> 04:29:19,610
across america cruel oppression of u.s citizens still continues all over the nation are we done

1301
04:29:19,610 --> 04:29:24,729
yet i guess neither of us will see any time off soon we're very close i'm off to the next battle

1302
04:29:24,729 --> 04:29:37,049
zone yes mr president i we're almost done we've almost got the entire united states

1303
04:29:37,690 --> 04:29:47,739
safe and reclaimed the enemy force sends out over 1 000 citizens a day from miami

1304
04:29:47,739 --> 04:29:53,420
trafficking them into overseas white slavery i'm ready the command cruiser moored on the coast

direct troops in the atlantic it has long-range high-powered missiles on board stay art you're

1306
04:29:59,819 --> 04:30:05,819
not halfway done many helicopters join the defense am i not done your attacks on intercepting these

1307
04:30:05,819 --> 04:30:11,180
cannonballs the objective is the destruction of all target areas this mission goes by the call

1308
04:30:11,180 --> 04:30:20,090

1312
04:30:59,850 --> 04:31:06,360
this thing is ridiculous incredibly long range and firepower fires rebounding lasers

1313
04:31:07,739 --> 04:31:10,299
and i saw it with the longest range of any standard arms weapon

1314
04:31:11,180 --> 04:31:29,059
and i saw it used by cyborgs yes cyborgs i'm bought that's the first thing i'm buying i just

1315
04:31:29,139 --> 04:31:31,860
got this one how much is it to upgrade this one more time

1316
04:31:34,340 --> 04:31:52,250
i can't do it again uh i'm just i'm gonna i have to stick with this is kind of what i got

1317
04:32:00,500 --> 04:32:07,780
enemy forces occupy miami beach that battle cruiser is the command ship directing the

1318
04:32:07,780 --> 04:32:13,379
atlantic ocean troops in this area attack the cruiser and the coup d'etat forces

1319
04:32:13,459 --> 04:32:19,860
legally enjoying their holiday and sink them to the bottom of this grand ocean

1320
04:32:20,500 --> 04:32:31,079
copy that for their sakes i hope they enjoyed their last rnr the navy cruiser will fire powerful

1321
04:32:31,079 --> 04:32:39,819
long-range missiles you'll need sure it will warning mr president bombers be on alert this

1322
04:32:39,819 --> 04:32:48,729
is gonna kill you in one hit right received a request from the target area and is on their

1323
04:32:48,729 --> 04:33:02,280
way we'll begin all right you have to say the same thing before i know what you're talking

1324
04:33:02,280 --> 04:33:33,380
about that's good i want the hand unless you wipe out the launch source i'm trying 12 o'clock

1325
04:33:40,470 --> 04:33:41,909
and you got land mines on here too

1326
04:33:42,229 --> 04:34:19,740
oh

1327
04:34:29,180 --> 04:34:38,709
mr president every time i step on a mine she just goes mr it's like oh just stop

1328
04:34:38,709 --> 04:34:43,430
watching the screen just turn off the screen is that the eagle of the atlantic

1329
04:34:43,430 --> 04:34:46,549
brigadier general robert i'll like call you if i need something

1330
04:34:51,130 --> 04:35:05,909
know what your is inside of there i can tell you this your public enemy number one

1331
04:35:06,869 --> 04:35:13,479
i'm going head to head with this kind of firepower isn't the smart way start by crushing

1332
04:35:13,479 --> 04:35:27,540
the gun that defense strength is high against live ammunition a musician was among the pows

1333
04:35:27,540 --> 04:35:34,700
you rescued he was surely forced to play the ukulele on the beach all the target areas have

1334
04:35:34,700 --> 04:35:49,080
been destroyed all right what am i looking at here i'm thinking to him what's the weak point here

1335
04:35:49,880 --> 04:36:02,759
i just i gotta get stuck in the way please do not be caught off guard

1336
04:36:03,799 --> 04:36:13,060
i didn't even hurt it and this is barely hurting this go up to the radar knock down that tower

1337
04:36:13,860 --> 04:36:20,060
wow i got frozen damage rate is over 70 percent

1338
04:36:20,459 --> 04:36:36,779
mr president i couldn't nothing so that's how you instantly die

1339
04:36:42,169 --> 04:36:47,849
the navy cruiser you'll need constant warning mr president

1340
04:36:48,810 --> 04:37:39,750
receive a request from the target area you should cover the rivers and vacationers

1341
04:37:40,630 --> 04:37:41,750
this is still here

1342
04:37:53,099 --> 04:38:29,830
can i take them all around i'm not sure again like one more thing to

1343
04:38:31,669 --> 04:38:55,349

1344
04:39:10,540 --> 04:39:16,950

oh fuck dude from that navy cruiser are on a collision course yeah i know

1349
04:40:46,979 --> 04:41:12,330
um i i did something with way more missiles than i do

1350
04:41:15,909 --> 04:41:48,139
it's time to just dance around if you can hit by a barrage with games oh i can't even target

1351
04:41:48,139 --> 04:41:51,799
this isn't

1352
04:41:53,240 --> 04:42:01,270
what am i aiming at well the thing is i can't even describe it if the game has a target

1353
04:42:01,270 --> 04:42:19,000
they they will shoot there no matter what pain in the ass i'm out of bullets on this thing

1361
04:44:07,799 --> 04:44:20,580
cyborg rifle something cruiser rich ecosystem that teams with marine life including new species of

1362
04:44:20,580 --> 04:44:27,400
coral which i'm sure you've heard of sea forester in honor of brigadier general robert forester

1363

what does tragedy never be okay what's the pulse of the nation say about all this

1364
04:44:34,779 --> 04:44:40,380
citizens have already begun to wake up to the vice president evil intentions he's evil they

1365
04:44:40,380 --> 04:44:48,299
couldn't stage a revolt in time just the thought of a revolt is enough i'll take back the nation

04:44:48,299 --> 04:45:00,569
soon full speed ahead i'm with you all the way mr president all right let's go the enemy force

1367
04:45:00,569 --> 04:45:05,610
super weapons on the people of new york with unmanned super weaponry it treats the eight

1368
04:45:05,610 --> 04:45:10,569
million citizens who run about trying to escape like information has been obtained so this is one

1369
04:45:10,569 --> 04:45:16,470
of those big giant hands supplying the massive weaponry for taking the huge weapons head-on

1370
04:45:16,470 --> 04:45:27,990
destroy the energy supply for this mission goes patient we love nyc fuck and god speed mr president

1371
04:45:30,090 --> 04:45:37,299
buy that weapon upgrade it laser rifle we're good and this is probably one of the last missions in

1372
04:45:37,299 --> 04:45:50,680
the game but it seems probably a few more no no no no no not investment this one here enrf cb

1373
04:45:52,599 --> 04:46:00,630
got it might as well get one of the other ones too longest range rebounding lasers

metal for that although i can do missiles one more time right yeah let's do it p is available

1376
04:46:22,759 --> 04:46:31,560
see if it does the advanced missile launcher capable of penetrating multiple targets that's

1377
04:46:31,560 --> 04:46:41,380
pretty good i might get that but in the meantime let me put on that new thing that i got it's fine

04:50:22,169 --> 04:50:34,860
so you can weaken its electromagnetic armor that's what i'm doing judy i already see it

1400
04:50:58,790 --> 04:51:01,029
where is that spider thing right now oh god

1401
04:51:01,990 --> 04:51:16,180
oh

1402
04:51:16,900 --> 04:52:01,209
he's already here he's close he's too close oh shit i can't i forgot background these little

1403
04:52:01,209 --> 04:52:11,020
spiders we're being like this they must be out of their minds it's destroyed and weakened daddy

1404
04:52:11,979 --> 04:52:24,729
is it his power cells or something a lot of power cells

1405
04:52:44,299 --> 04:52:51,979
i'm right under him oh my god what has to go for a recharge is that what

1406
04:52:51,979 --> 04:52:57,720
he's doing we're gonna charge his battery the energy station is a priority

1407
04:53:07,750 --> 04:53:16,979
fuck i thought i could do it i had an opportunity i thought i was gonna take it

1408
04:53:17,779 --> 04:53:24,419
if i had that thing i thought i had that um the super charge thing and it's so aggravating i

1409
04:53:24,419 --> 04:53:30,419
thought i had it what he said is true i was gonna be dangerous run away for now mr president

1410
04:53:31,220 --> 04:53:38,099
oh it sucks that daddy long legs get this energy wave fire power from a power facility

1411
04:53:38,099 --> 04:53:59,639
each target area of these powerful electro magnoi should be cut off first is that rocket number like

1412
04:53:59,639 --> 04:54:18,020
15 it's like that's rocket like number fucking 30 is it my shooting up air gas or i don't understand

1413
04:54:44,490 --> 04:54:47,610
way ahead of us to research weapons of mass destruction

1414
04:54:49,930 --> 04:54:58,119
okay i gotta run

1415
04:55:02,360 --> 04:55:26,759
why am i using a red candy i don't know is he here yet there he is just

1416
04:55:57,529 --> 04:55:58,889
i guess i was still too close

1417
04:56:03,689 --> 04:56:08,169
away for now mr president

1418
04:56:34,419 --> 04:56:41,299
what the fuck happened the spider's not even near me i don't it's something what am i missing

1419
04:56:44,919 --> 04:56:50,500
the guy was down the street if what he said is true

1420
04:56:51,060 --> 04:57:06,889
this will be dangerous run away you have to go so fast and then you've run out of fucking boost

1421
04:57:06,889 --> 04:57:40,409
you just sit there overheated i should be cut out first here he is i'm gonna get i gotta get out of

1422
04:57:40,409 --> 04:58:16,549
here straight ahead i had the target a second ago i didn't even move i'm so disappointed i didn't

1423
04:58:16,549 --> 04:58:41,130
even move from the spot and i lost if i don't beat this game the u.s is finished after i do new

1424
04:58:41,130 --> 04:59:12,819
york we'll see get away from to recharge i guess it makes sense i'm gonna avoid this dickhead

1425
04:59:13,860 --> 04:59:46,360
he's not just gonna turn the corner and be here right he's walking which way is he walking

1432
05:01:44,549 --> 05:02:01,849

1456
05:10:41,060 --> 05:10:53,770

05:47:38,919 --> 05:47:46,580

1621
05:47:46,659 --> 05:47:51,779
given this like a five point four these incapable pigs are eating this nation alive

1622
05:47:55,349 --> 05:48:02,150
the death of these freeloaders leaving only the capable behind will help me create a new nation

1623

05:48:28,659 --> 05:48:36,810
this game is a five seven oh my god you guys are fucking you guys don't push me right now i'm i'm

1627
05:48:36,810 --> 05:48:47,479
very very fragile right now i'm very sensitive at the moment and watch those worms wiggle in

1628
05:48:47,639 --> 05:48:51,779
vain i'll cry you'll watch you'll see me cry

1629
05:48:54,569 --> 05:49:12,169

1631
05:49:25,400 --> 05:49:37,509

1632
05:49:38,310 --> 05:49:57,049
i didn't do grand lunches at all what a waste of money what a meltdown purchase these were uh

1633
05:49:57,049 --> 05:50:14,250

1635
05:50:22,229 --> 05:50:37,099
rg-30 actually getting sp how much do they cost rg-50 okay let's go look at it

1636
05:50:38,779 --> 05:50:46,459
rg-30 firepower increases the charge a rail gun that could be charged for different projectiles

1637
05:50:46,459 --> 05:50:51,099
and then an advanced rail gun that can be charged up to for increased firepower i don't have any

1638
05:50:51,099 --> 05:51:01,380
metal i can make this one but this is the default one i don't have to end game late game here it's

1639
05:51:01,380 --> 05:51:17,270
probably that idea i'll do i'm gonna go get not do another level get some more money what

1640
05:51:17,270 --> 05:51:28,950
did i make the most money that was the easiest level i'll be down here miami what's a good grind

1641
05:51:28,950 --> 05:51:38,860
level that boat right yeah i ain't going to i'm not doing new york the enemy force sends out over

1642
05:51:38,860 --> 05:51:53,580
one thousand is this the one good luck all right i got this would be fine just to do it for money

1643
05:51:53,659 --> 05:52:01,770
anyways skipping the lower we already saw it the navy cruiser will fire powerful

1644
05:52:21,450 --> 05:52:34,520
all right boat i'm just looking for like two three hundred grand

1645
05:52:35,159 --> 05:52:42,580
musician was among the pows you rescued he was surely forced to play the ukulele on the beach

1646
05:52:43,540 --> 05:53:24,139
oh watch out for aerial attacks just behind them that's all

1647
05:53:26,380 --> 05:53:43,479
i'm back here uh to grind the money because i want to have the better stuff lots of money

1648
05:53:57,509 --> 05:54:04,229
offensive augment those poor soldiers more long-range missiles these attacks will rage

1649
05:54:04,229 --> 05:54:08,069
on unless you wipe out the launch course yeah i got it

1650
05:54:14,709 --> 05:54:15,509
oh really

1651
05:54:20,389 --> 05:54:50,729
evasive maneuver that was heavy you ammo let's get it i'm gonna die on the grind level and that's

1652
05:54:50,729 --> 05:54:55,020
where you say the time for a sandwich

1653
05:55:32,470 --> 05:55:41,500
people get sandwiches if they feel like making a sandwich in their own damn house in my house

1654
05:55:42,139 --> 05:55:45,580
i'm gonna make a sandwich if i want one that doesn't matter if you want to lose

1655
05:55:46,299 --> 05:55:49,900
you don't lose the baseball game and then you uh no can i have a sandwich no

1656
05:55:52,180 --> 05:56:27,299
you didn't hit two home runs today you get nothing the team lost this is where i gotta be careful

1657
05:56:31,770 --> 05:56:39,299
as far as my title makes no fucking sense anymore does it i haven't had like a

1658
05:56:39,299 --> 05:56:43,299
stupid thing strange thing i haven't done i'm trying to get close enough to do this

1659
05:56:44,819 --> 05:57:01,639
that out no way don't you dare oh man i can't fucking believe it

1660
05:57:03,130 --> 05:57:09,900
oh it's the guy he instantly died

1661
05:57:11,819 --> 05:57:21,220
it's time for a sandwich i was trying to make money just get over here

1662
05:57:26,630 --> 05:57:34,630
it seems to have received a request from the target area and is on their way

1663
05:57:34,630 --> 05:57:39,669
yeah i'm sure they have you should sever the reinforcements ahead of time

1664
05:57:40,389 --> 05:57:53,180
so

1665
05:57:54,860 --> 05:59:13,159
in fact if i don't do it this time i'm just going to play free unless you wipe out the launch

1666
05:59:13,159 --> 05:59:52,540
source i thought i got rid of those four soldiers

1667
06:00:11,689 --> 06:00:14,650
yeah they're just little fucking toilet seat covers

1668
06:00:17,209 --> 06:00:28,490
that's far enough metal going head to head with this kind of firepower

1669
06:00:28,490 --> 06:00:31,770
isn't a smart way start by crushing the gun battery

1670
06:00:34,169 --> 06:00:51,159
excited i wouldn't be not yet until i show that we're gonna do something crazy

1671
06:00:56,889 --> 06:01:21,099
the thing i started at one o'clock all right get done bombing this guy actually sucks

1672
06:01:21,099 --> 06:01:37,180
all right i don't know but this was this wasn't even easy this was annoying i can't even

1673
06:01:39,659 --> 06:01:46,860

1675
06:02:18,340 --> 06:02:21,369

1676
06:02:22,970 --> 06:03:09,619
welcome three gun battery tickers one through five are flooded repair crew get on the scene

1678
06:03:38,569 --> 06:03:51,590

1681
06:04:09,299 --> 06:04:37,979
is it equipment it already did it automatically did it maybe i don't know that's weird all right

1682
06:04:37,979 --> 06:04:53,799

1684
06:05:17,900 --> 06:05:27,779
at once 120 000 and all right let's just try this is one of this is one of the last levels

1685
06:05:27,779 --> 06:05:36,259
in the game we're just gonna go through it put it on what's this what one of these is a piece

1686
06:05:36,259 --> 06:05:52,169
of crap i think it's this one yeah this thing sucks now it takes up two slots lose my sam what's

1687
06:05:52,169 --> 06:06:01,930
better visit the sand this thing kind of sucks too huh these both aren't really good what's worse

1688
06:06:02,490 --> 06:06:18,569
over this no this is worse let's keep it i got the rail gun let's see what it does

1689
06:06:22,840 --> 06:06:35,500
washington dc mr president why did you come to save us after we betrayed you jodie

1690
06:06:37,020 --> 06:06:44,630
i can't turn my back on a friend and the reason is i'm the president of the united states

1691
06:06:44,630 --> 06:06:57,029
mr president don't come near it's a trap hey there michael are you still playing the hero

1692
06:06:58,150 --> 06:07:07,369
witcher you just don't get it do you drop this thing like three or four times freedom is dead

1693
06:07:08,090 --> 06:07:13,770
you and your men and this symbol of freedom

1694
06:07:21,740 --> 06:07:30,680
okay that way we protect the statue go ahead and cock your weapons if i direct these missiles

1695
06:07:30,680 --> 06:07:39,159
behind me that goddess of liberty and you're gonna get a secretary will all be blown to smithereens

1696
06:07:39,159 --> 06:07:48,099
i'm gonna stop the missiles don't stop stop shooting i have to get up there and protect the

1697
06:07:48,900 --> 06:07:57,669
it's already dead uh you're definitely missing something here

1698
06:08:00,459 --> 06:08:17,700
what is it to shoot him out of the sky damn it i thought that i would have been great if i could

1699
06:08:17,700 --> 06:08:27,139
just kill him i'm gonna kill them i gotta shoot the missiles let's do it again

1700
06:08:27,139 --> 06:08:40,250
um

1701
06:08:49,130 --> 06:08:54,330
right but should we should be standing somewhere else so i just sit here and just shoot him when

1702
06:08:54,330 --> 06:09:03,110
they come out i guess i really should get the uh the thing that can take it out

1703
06:09:03,990 --> 06:09:16,709
that interceptor one whatever it is it's kind of what it should be

1704
06:09:17,669 --> 06:09:46,060
they go all the way back let me see what happens when i like go is this just like a dps race

1705
06:09:46,619 --> 06:09:52,340
do i actually have to shoot all these out of the sky why am i not getting a good lock on

1706
06:10:14,009 --> 06:10:21,849
two i didn't i wasn't even really in wow is on the move michael he'll bite you if you don't move it

1707
06:10:21,849 --> 06:10:25,209
it now i tail it out of here

1708
06:10:27,369 --> 06:10:33,290
my car door is open i'm sorry i almost forgot time for my afternoon tea

1709
06:10:34,569 --> 06:10:41,130
nothing like sipping some delicious darjeeling tea and watching you getting your clock cleaned

1710
06:10:41,130 --> 06:10:51,049
all right we'll see you next mission whoa that just kind of started um same deal

1711
06:10:51,049 --> 06:10:59,560
oh he's just bombarding this thing what the fuck what are you supposed to do about this

1712
06:10:59,560 --> 06:11:15,270
just keep i guess um what's the best weapon for this dude patches not just a badge railgun

1713
06:11:15,270 --> 06:11:25,349
mr preston charges you're alive us resistance soldiers are known for our resilience

1714
06:11:26,069 --> 06:11:30,180
uh

1715
06:11:41,139 --> 06:11:43,060
i can't just stand here with this railgun

1716
06:11:45,689 --> 06:11:57,060
we have knowledge of how to escape i we're good helicopters are limited be careful

1717
06:11:58,180 --> 06:12:06,840
i can just i mean you move too slow with this thing to shoot like the missile

1718
06:12:06,919 --> 06:12:08,279
yeah this is way too slow

1719
06:12:15,860 --> 06:12:19,080
i'm gonna use the rail gun you walk away

1720
06:12:28,500 --> 06:12:32,180
all right let's go

1721
06:12:33,139 --> 06:12:43,020
and cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me that goddess of liberty and your cute

1722
06:12:43,020 --> 06:12:51,750
little secretary will all be blown to smithereens give me another do i have i need to get two assault

1723
06:12:51,750 --> 06:12:58,220
rifles for this i think unfortunately yeah that's probably a better idea i should go back to the

1724
06:12:58,220 --> 06:13:07,349
garage because this is not no you just need to even be a self rifle so much easier

1725
06:13:08,549 --> 06:13:31,159
use the rail gun now it's too slow too slow i can't no the rail guns are not good here

1726
06:13:31,799 --> 06:13:39,380
too slow he's gonna just keep firing missiles with the statue of liberty charge it the whole

1727
06:13:39,380 --> 06:13:56,700
way just shoot it at the tank okay do you want me to just do this like 10 times

1728
06:13:56,700 --> 06:14:12,490
is it actually gonna work no this is not gonna work too much damage to the statue of liberty

1729
06:14:12,490 --> 06:14:39,259
already i'm like i'm saying this is not gonna work i'm gonna get run over by this tank

1730
06:14:40,939 --> 06:14:43,720
the damage rate is over 50 watch out

1731
06:14:44,360 --> 06:14:48,259
oh

1732
06:14:57,819 --> 06:15:04,060
part one yeah maybe i could see that part two all right maybe i hold on maybe it is part two

1733
06:15:04,060 --> 06:15:26,650
maybe okay hold on this might actually work why'd you have to die and cock your weapons

1734
06:15:26,729 --> 06:15:33,930
if i direct these missiles behind me that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary

1735
06:15:33,930 --> 06:15:36,650
will all be blown to smithereens

1736
06:15:46,979 --> 06:16:03,770
wow how much do i have to load it up is it like 10 20 more than that 50 all right

1737
06:16:03,770 --> 06:16:10,150
when it flashes yellow the first time i'll get it next time restart restart restart restart

1738
06:16:13,259 --> 06:16:24,869
go ahead and cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me that was it that god

1739
06:16:24,869 --> 06:16:31,349
is the liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens

1740
06:16:36,439 --> 06:16:53,159
he's making me so angry yeah i don't think this is very effective i have to hold it for too long

1741
06:16:53,159 --> 06:16:57,880
it takes too long i'm gonna i might get to the end but i don't think it's gonna work out very well

1742
06:16:59,240 --> 06:17:04,860
he has no more missiles can i take off the top ones too let's see if i can get these ones too

1743
06:17:06,060 --> 06:17:10,169
am i just making him completely useless before phase two

1744
06:17:13,740 --> 06:17:42,419
uh what is this last one oh i'm over here the game is broken just kill him can i do it in time

1745
06:17:44,169 --> 06:17:48,409
how many bullets how many will he shoot how much damage is one missile due to the statue of liberty

1746
06:17:49,049 --> 06:17:58,069
too much no he's gonna go phase two oh fuck oh my god i should have just listened to myself

1747
06:17:58,630 --> 06:18:06,939
i should have just shot it i should have just done it that'll work out though as long as i

1748
06:18:07,659 --> 06:18:29,619
this might not be bad no i know i know we're fine i know you're gonna keep saying it

1749
06:18:30,819 --> 06:18:52,759
the trade is over 50 watch out in 200 yards between the tank and the statue of liberty

1750
06:18:52,759 --> 06:18:59,240
kill promptly and effectively that's an ironclad battle tactic does that mean he's gonna get me

1751
06:18:59,240 --> 06:19:07,540
okay look back at the trade is over 70 percent we're down stop doing cut scenes to tell me that

1752
06:19:07,540 --> 06:19:29,029
somebody died because it takes away all my charge kill with cool super i don't have

1753
06:19:35,110 --> 06:19:45,770
mr president why'd you have to die all right i got a new i'm gonna have to do double assault

1754
06:19:45,770 --> 06:19:52,090
rifle i'll try this one final time because i think if i get it the right way the way that i want

1755
06:19:52,090 --> 06:19:58,810
cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me three that god is of liberty and your

1756
06:19:58,810 --> 06:20:03,049
cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens

1757
06:20:16,900 --> 06:20:22,119
all right take out the missiles up here i'm gonna stick with that strategy i think it's gonna work

1758
06:20:22,759 --> 06:20:37,930
take out all the guns that i can and then i'm gonna get off the rail gun and go to assault rifle and

1759
06:20:38,009 --> 06:20:39,849
something else maybe i don't know i'm not sure yet

1760
06:20:45,209 --> 06:20:49,560
saw rifle and missile launcher i guess i'm gonna have to rail gun out

1761
06:20:52,810 --> 06:21:00,009
do full charge right in the middle okay here comes space two

1762
06:21:04,580 --> 06:21:18,439
of course behind a small wooden railing how about defenses great just take the damn thing out

1763
06:21:18,439 --> 06:21:37,290
okay maybe the sand here we go oh i don't think this is working

1764
06:21:38,889 --> 06:21:45,979
uh it's actually somehow less effective than just using the open

1765
06:21:58,419 --> 06:22:09,689
that's an iron clad battle tactic make it stop damage rate is over 50 i don't even see i don't

1766
06:22:10,889 --> 06:22:26,409
think it's over 70 oh my god i'm gonna have a meltdown again i don't think that's doing anything

1767
06:22:28,490 --> 06:22:33,590
the thing in the middle has to die and effectively that's an iron clad battle tactic

1768
06:22:46,650 --> 06:22:50,169
i'm shooting the legs right now damage level is approaching critical mass

1769
06:22:51,130 --> 06:23:13,979
danger mr president why'd you have to die uh i don't understand what to do

1770
06:23:15,900 --> 06:23:18,700
yeah i was doing much better with the rail gun just put the rail gun back on okay

1771
06:23:18,700 --> 06:23:25,979
i kind of want a better rail gun go ahead and cock your weapons direct these missiles behind me

1772
06:23:25,979 --> 06:23:33,099
that god is of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens

1773
06:23:53,740 --> 06:24:10,490
simple oh is it what how is this simple he's got like 30 rocket launchers i want this thing

1774
06:24:10,490 --> 06:24:14,409
gone but i don't think you can can you not get rid of it i'm just gonna fully charge

1775
06:24:14,409 --> 06:24:20,060
shot right in space is it destroyed it looks like it is but it might not be

1776
06:24:21,020 --> 06:24:28,979
was it gone before i remember there's so much stuff going on on the screen it's hard to tell

1777
06:24:29,939 --> 06:24:48,939
these things almost dead they're sitting there experimenting for too long oh all right yeah it is

1778
06:24:49,020 --> 06:24:57,560
we did we're not we'll see

1779
06:25:10,810 --> 06:25:15,930
stop oh my god it's the worst why would you go into two cutscenes and grow

1780
06:25:15,930 --> 06:25:38,630
fuck why is there ever a reason to do that it is over 50 watch out only 200 yards between the

1781
06:25:38,630 --> 06:25:44,919
tank and the statue of liberty kill promptly and effectively that's an ironclad battle tactic i

1782
06:25:44,919 --> 06:26:06,759
guess that did it it's going slower now it's over 70 we're down to five helicopter sure you

1783
06:26:06,759 --> 06:26:12,569
could have just said that i could have just told you that i don't want to see the cuts

1784
06:26:26,810 --> 06:26:42,810
i got no more danger oh just die how do i get this i gotta get rid of this thing

1785
06:26:42,810 --> 06:26:52,150
in a hurry kill with cool composure that's an ironclad battle tactic this thing's like a

1786
06:26:52,150 --> 06:27:04,299
shield or do i just have to destroy this i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead it's over i'm

1787
06:27:04,299 --> 06:27:25,369

06:27:37,509 --> 06:27:44,869
that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens

1795
06:29:13,159 --> 06:29:22,310
back cannons cutscene double cutscene double cutscene shoot it before the cutscene

1796
06:29:24,099 --> 06:29:48,200
wins the next cutscene coming up right now right it's right it's soon lid hit the lid hit the lip

1797
06:29:49,080 --> 06:30:07,130
rate is over 50 watch out good now what now what just shoot it just kill it

1798
06:30:12,810 --> 06:30:24,169
more treads fully charged fully charged to the tread oh shit only 200 yards between the

1799
06:30:24,169 --> 06:30:45,669
tank and the statue of liberty i got four more shots did that hit that fucking car

1800
06:30:48,869 --> 06:30:57,029
be careful no why come on i can still do it he can't hit any other particle he'll be out of

1801
06:30:59,259 --> 06:31:11,770
kill a cornered enemy that's an ironclad battle tactic is that hurting him i can't even tell what's

1802
06:31:11,770 --> 06:31:24,299
hurting him anymore okay okay okay okay now what this damage level is approaching critical mass

1803
06:31:25,340 --> 06:31:32,139
danger 50 yards till target okay kill it okay okay kill it shooting mr president

1804
06:31:32,939 --> 06:31:38,180
there's many a slip between the cup and the lip what does that even mean

1805
06:31:39,139 --> 06:31:57,369
why is he going so fast what the fuck what happened why what why did he go so fast

1806
06:31:59,099 --> 06:32:04,119
that makes no sense he went so fast

1807
06:32:13,430 --> 06:32:23,159
that was ridiculous that was ridiculous un-fucking-believable no i gotta retry it

1808
06:32:23,159 --> 06:32:32,889
again why what that was so unfair that was unfair i can't believe it i had it too i got it

1809
06:32:45,959 --> 06:32:51,720
it isn't rage time grind out some better real guns all right all right yeah i'm gonna go pee

1810
06:32:52,599 --> 06:33:05,459
and then we'll do that god damn it that's unbelievable so i would be angry right now

1811
06:33:05,459 --> 06:33:18,619
but how can you be after that you kind of can't be i want to just get rid of all this shit for the

1812
06:33:18,619 --> 06:33:41,689
next phase if it doesn't have anything to shoot then it doesn't matter i would break the disc

1813
06:33:41,689 --> 06:33:55,369
and shit on it oh really i don't i want to just completely focus on getting rid of the trends

1814
06:33:56,169 --> 06:34:03,610
he's not gonna have any more guns the middle one's already gone i got it okay here we go

1815
06:34:05,529 --> 06:34:17,700
full blast into the thread one two three good again one three four got it okay slow down he's

1816
06:34:17,700 --> 06:34:22,099
done i did it right is that did i do it he looks like he's going faster okay there we go

1817
06:34:22,740 --> 06:34:38,540
okay good focus my god what have you done that didn't blow it up

1818
06:34:38,939 --> 06:34:52,970
you don't want to do it twice because it's a waste

1819
06:34:54,970 --> 06:35:12,299
this one might be a wash this is it how are you shitting me that thing is should be dead

1820
06:35:12,299 --> 06:35:39,799
without a doubt all right bring it up good next one here we go we're down five helicopters between

1821
06:35:39,799 --> 06:35:45,880
the tank and the statue of liberty kill promptly and effectively hold it longer look at the bar

1822
06:35:45,880 --> 06:36:15,529
fills up it's full first fall first fall two more last shot and then it's all hell breaks loose

1823
06:36:16,409 --> 06:36:22,819
all hell breaks loose after this one and then what i just rocket launcher rockets

1824
06:36:25,799 --> 06:36:31,450
but kill a cornered enemy with prudence that's an iron cloud battle tactic

06:37:10,709 --> 06:37:37,580
is over 50 watch out here he comes no mr president i got it mr president no no no

1829
06:37:38,680 --> 06:37:43,319
i can do it i can everyone it's gonna be fine we're gonna beat this game and i'm gonna it's

1830
06:37:43,319 --> 06:37:49,180
it's worth it what are you what do you keep doing wrong oh i think i'm just i don't have a hot i'm

1835
06:38:24,119 --> 06:38:35,590
the most damage that's a full-on flamethrower maybe it might flamethrower maybe it's worth the

1836
06:38:35,590 --> 06:38:51,029
shot i should buy another one of these will the flamethrower not damage it what do you think

1837
06:38:51,029 --> 06:39:08,869
what do you think i think and uh sam is still all right i guess we'll do missile launcher and

1838
06:39:09,830 --> 06:39:18,979
this is good i think it's terrible we'll do these two and spam them all right i'm gonna try this one

06:39:18,979 --> 06:39:29,349
more time with the new loadout same as intended for aircraft yeah but i just have hams should i

1840
06:39:29,349 --> 06:39:37,900
just use the other this this bazooka the bu kind of terrible the hams do more than 600 damage

1841
06:39:40,889 --> 06:39:48,869

1842
06:39:48,869 --> 06:39:53,270

06:41:42,919 --> 06:41:46,200
there it is same with these ones same right in the front door

1854
06:41:46,840 --> 06:41:50,200
that your liberty is going to be fine forget about the hp

1855
06:41:50,200 --> 06:41:57,479

1864
06:44:45,720 --> 06:45:13,060
laughing at that seven shots oh no this is too slow i got two qrs's 50 yards here we go

1865
06:45:13,060 --> 06:45:34,540

1866
06:45:35,500 --> 06:45:44,409

1867
06:45:44,409 --> 06:46:15,450
get it oh fuck he's dead one more shoot it i lost i should have stuck with the plan

1868
06:46:15,450 --> 06:46:20,490
i should have stuck with the plan all right i should have stuck with the plan

1869
06:46:24,939 --> 06:46:28,419
new tactic

1870
06:46:32,919 --> 06:46:39,880
if i direct these missiles behind me that god is a liberty and your cute little secretary

1871
06:46:57,819 --> 06:47:06,520
better tactic it's better what a better tactic this really is now i got enough energy supplies

1872
06:47:07,319 --> 06:47:20,709
and now i have more and i'm just gonna stick to the fucking plan i will have like 20 shots

1873
06:47:21,509 --> 06:47:35,189
is this thing destroyed it is now oh fuck oh that's not good okay this is very bad actually this is

1874
06:47:35,189 --> 06:47:49,349
horrible worst plan confirmed he's already on the move yeah he's already moving this is worse

1875
06:47:50,549 --> 06:48:17,619
this is way worse wait is the statue what statue liberties can take that's great i think the

1876
06:48:17,619 --> 06:48:58,299
statue liberty is fine going straight in the middle so yeah forget about the top missiles and

1877
06:48:58,299 --> 06:49:04,619
shit i can i think i can do it right now damage rate is over 50 watch out he just put up a shield

1878
06:49:04,619 --> 06:49:10,700
for me that's fine i'll take it only 200 yards between the tank and 200 yards though man you're

1879
06:49:10,700 --> 06:49:38,419
already here and effectively that's an ironclad battle tactic stick i can stick to the plan i have

1880
06:49:38,419 --> 06:49:45,189
a hundred meters

1881
06:50:12,490 --> 06:50:17,290
i just need to shoot it like five times i'm already how am i so close to

1882
06:50:17,290 --> 06:50:25,580
being dead that's an ironclad battle tactic does he have thorns just restarted oh my god

1883
06:50:26,139 --> 06:50:34,490
mr president let us down i keep taking missiles i have to walk to shoot the okay i got it

1884
06:50:37,080 --> 06:50:45,029

1885
06:50:45,029 --> 06:50:52,869

1887
06:50:59,779 --> 06:51:09,720

you put your finger up to your throat and you shake it around wasted you got beyond i'm beyond

1889
06:51:22,500 --> 06:51:36,860

1919
06:58:42,840 --> 06:58:59,180
loadout i'm good let's go check this shit out you'll need constant warning mr president

07:11:51,669 --> 07:11:59,080
water all over your baseboards and like under your couch and maybe a little bit um like on the bed

matter maybe it doesn't matter maybe i can still do it too much damage i'm gonna have to use the

2104
07:41:42,520 --> 07:41:51,479
second okay now i take i can hold on we're good wait hold on a second i might have to get the

2105
07:41:51,479 --> 07:42:00,220
whole back row here this is never going to work with this low slow charge i need to get rid of

2106
07:42:00,220 --> 07:42:09,110
all this stuff first yeah no way this is impossible without getting rid of everything

2107
07:42:09,110 --> 07:42:33,430
first damage rate is over 50 watch out yeah we're gonna do the original rail gun in phase one

2108
07:42:34,389 --> 07:42:46,549
this one in phase two go ahead and cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me

2109
07:42:46,549 --> 07:42:53,909
that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens

2110
07:42:54,150 --> 07:43:00,439
oh

2111
07:43:04,470 --> 07:43:08,790
i don't understand like that was seriously why would you take that much that would that that

2112
07:43:08,790 --> 07:43:31,830
that's un-fucking-believing i'm just gonna stand up here can i jump on the tank i'm not sure i

2113
07:43:31,830 --> 07:43:54,389
want to do that oh boy i may have done something wrong what the fuck happened why did he start

2114
07:43:54,389 --> 07:44:02,380
moving why did he start moving it's like i don't know is it the amount of damage you do

2115
07:44:03,259 --> 07:44:11,060
fuck this go ahead and cock your weapons check this out these missiles behind me that god is

2116

a liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens what if i just don't care

2117
07:44:17,619 --> 07:44:27,669
and just shoot the tank and just who cares will he kill the statue of liberty in time i don't know

2118
07:44:27,669 --> 07:44:51,479
maybe i'm gonna try to take on this whole back row they went i'm trying to split them

2119
07:44:52,200 --> 07:45:13,430
that's your liberty's dead oh my goodness i'm gonna lose my damn mind playing this thing i mean i

2120
07:45:13,430 --> 07:45:21,060
already did but like holy shit maybe i should just start to maybe i should just try to catch

2121
07:45:22,659 --> 07:45:33,319
you try this go ahead and cock your weapons if i direct these missiles behind me that god is a

2122
07:45:33,319 --> 07:45:39,479
liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens

2123
07:45:42,540 --> 07:46:04,279
all right all right hold on right down the middle get rid of the beam okay now the hold on i did

2124
07:46:04,279 --> 07:46:29,720
that really quickly i might have some time here fuck that was a genuine fuck that was a genuine

2125
07:46:29,799 --> 07:46:44,979
like heads like sneeze forward fuck my head went back forward hard okay i'm good

2126
07:46:48,619 --> 07:47:06,409
not bad it might this might work switch out to the big one after hold on this is it right here

2127
07:47:07,209 --> 07:47:19,060
i can get both you stupid motherfucking cutscene why does that have to even happen oh my god this

2128
07:47:19,060 --> 07:47:34,680
game is gonna drive me fucking up the wall this is this is just this is just you can't say this is

2129
07:47:34,680 --> 07:47:51,349
not done with a capital d it's just dumb how does a fucking almost full charge shot take that up

2130
07:47:51,349 --> 07:48:04,220
not take that up there's no explanation this is worse this gun is worse i spent the time grinding

2131
07:48:04,220 --> 07:48:09,560
to get this and it's not even as good i just popped my elbow that's how you know it's real

2132
07:48:10,360 --> 07:48:26,650
that was a good start too that's so sad i'm gonna have to do this again i'm

2133
07:48:26,650 --> 07:48:31,930
only i'm just gonna use the original weapons if i direct these missiles behind me that

2134
07:48:31,930 --> 07:48:38,729
goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens

2135
07:49:16,279 --> 07:49:31,319
i'm back to these original one machine guns i'm gonna go for the top okay i got i gotta get rid

2136
07:49:31,319 --> 07:49:40,840
of these things the tread has to go now like right now watch out watch out please don't shoot

2137
07:49:40,840 --> 07:50:13,909
it that's the cutscene i got it okay let's go oh you gotta be fucking kidding me which rate is

2138
07:50:13,909 --> 07:50:34,299
over 50 watch out i'm just going for the tank i'm just going for it that's a lot that is a lot

2139
07:50:34,299 --> 07:50:43,509
just so we're clear that's a ton of fucking damage only 200 yards between the tank and the

2140
07:50:43,509 --> 07:50:49,349
statue of liberty and effectively that's an ironclad battle tactic

2141
07:51:12,419 --> 07:51:32,020
mr president let us down um i wonder if i should just get your weapons if i direct these missiles

2142
07:51:32,020 --> 07:51:39,299
behind me that god is a shit ain't working and your cute little secretary will all be blown to

2143
07:51:39,299 --> 07:51:57,419
smithereens maybe i should hold on to this and use this for the missiles i'm doing that yeah i'm

2144
07:51:57,419 --> 07:52:18,759
gonna try that just buy a bunch of the missile launcher i think i could probably take out the

2145
07:52:18,759 --> 07:52:28,659
ones in the back quickly with that other launcher it's possible let's go with the cannon in the

2146
07:52:28,659 --> 07:52:39,639
middle all right let's try to get the machine gun here and then i try to get the missiles back

2147
07:52:40,599 --> 07:52:50,860
waiting up i mean the treads first treads first treads are more important

2148
07:52:54,060 --> 07:53:22,090
i just didn't even do the thing i said i was gonna do lost my fucking mind i i don't think

2149
07:53:22,090 --> 07:53:26,169
this is physically possible for me to beat this without different weapons without getting the

2150
07:53:26,169 --> 07:53:35,479
perfect storm i think i have to grind this shit ain't working go ahead and cock your weapons

2151
07:53:35,479 --> 07:53:42,680
if i direct these missiles behind me that god is of liberty and your cute little secretary

2152
07:53:42,680 --> 07:54:04,580
will all be blown to smithereens i can stand back further to blow this up

2153
07:54:04,580 --> 07:54:18,569
so

2154
07:54:19,849 --> 07:54:37,099
did i get i don't know if i got it i think i got it is it going faster i can't tell

2155
07:54:53,560 --> 07:55:08,569
amateur rate is over 50% i know i know it is i know it is i can't

2156
07:55:11,290 --> 07:55:31,500
i'm gonna try that again all right no no no no i don't know what to do

2157
07:55:31,500 --> 07:55:45,860
i think i think i just kind of have to go ahead and stay up there and shoot the missiles

2158
07:55:45,860 --> 07:55:51,860
missiles behind me that god is a liberty and i was so close with the rail gun and rockets

2159
07:55:51,860 --> 07:55:57,220
yeah it's so hard to replicate though just so fucking you gotta be it's not even being perfect

2160
07:55:57,220 --> 07:56:15,159
is you just have to be in it's like the timings are weird i had it almost twice but then for some

2161
07:56:15,159 --> 07:56:20,520
reason with no treads this game decides that it's going to go 100 miles per hour with the last like

2162
07:56:20,520 --> 07:56:32,200
20 meters for no reason this is just it's just gonna do it but i don't know why once we get the

2163
07:56:32,200 --> 07:56:36,599
cutscenes i think i have to change because it's just ruining everything it's ruining everything

2164
07:56:36,599 --> 07:56:54,259
that's your liberty zone today and that didn't have three rail guns that you've been done three

2165
07:56:54,259 --> 07:56:59,220
hits direct three fucking direct hit with like almost halfway charging it's inconsistent what

2166
07:56:59,220 --> 07:57:29,669
the fuck what is that what else do i have here i can't use this because this gets cutscene so

2167
07:57:29,669 --> 07:57:36,900
it's just not gonna work they give you a cutscene every single time somebody gets hurt so i guess

2168
07:57:36,900 --> 07:58:00,360
we're gonna go with we're gonna get rid of this and the bazookas sam maybe double bazooka i want

2169
07:58:00,759 --> 07:58:10,889
should be sam bazooka i don't i don't i think all right let's try this now

2170
07:58:12,169 --> 07:58:22,259
i'm just gonna check the other ones this i can't even how much damage does this do

2171
07:58:24,569 --> 07:58:38,700
missiles and bazooka are the key i guess i'm gonna do the sam and just these two

2172
07:58:38,700 --> 07:58:51,319
let's see which ones are more effective i guess i'll keep the rail gun just for shit i'm just

2173
07:58:51,319 --> 07:58:56,889
trying to try to target everything i guess just target them individually keep the rail gun for

2174
07:58:56,889 --> 07:59:14,360
maybe the end i'll try it i don't have these don't work on

2175
07:59:44,709 --> 07:59:51,750
why was i using the other thing why was i using the rail guns why was i using the rail gun

2176
07:59:52,709 --> 08:00:00,970
oh why was i doing that i don't know people told me didn't people tell me to do that

2177
08:00:02,810 --> 08:00:09,240
weren't people telling me people telling me right people telling me to do that was it two people

2178
08:00:09,240 --> 08:00:23,349
it was not two people it was like six thousand you guys told me to go back and grind for the rail gun

2179
08:00:24,700 --> 08:00:41,880
tears are streaming down my face it was a it was a shitload of people that was a lot of people

2180
08:00:41,880 --> 08:00:46,680
that told me to do that you and i i believed you because i thought it was for real too

2181
08:00:47,479 --> 08:00:51,959
i just killed that thing so easily just by using bazooka

2182
08:00:56,540 --> 08:01:00,139
i apologize for saying use rail gun i don't know anything about the game

2183
08:01:03,240 --> 08:01:08,599

2219
08:08:25,819 --> 08:08:32,869
retake the white house i don't think so maybe not but first i am going to do that again

2220
08:08:33,750 --> 08:08:40,090
which was it was this one here i'll head to liberty and because

2221
08:08:41,610 --> 08:08:55,689
just go i'm gonna do this like two three times go ahead and cock your weapons if i direct these

2222
08:08:55,770 --> 08:09:02,169
missiles behind me that god is a liberty and your cute little secretary will

2223
08:09:04,169 --> 08:09:39,259
oh don't fast still take out the treads please thanks first that's an iron clad yes yes yes

2224
08:09:41,259 --> 08:10:00,279
shooting mr president but there's holy shit s okay that's fucking all right do it again

2225
08:10:00,520 --> 08:10:08,299
okay i know i know look after seeing me do this now

2226
08:10:10,380 --> 08:10:14,299
imagine being a vod watcher and then seeing the last hour and a half

2227
08:10:14,939 --> 08:10:26,099
and knowing that you could skip to that supposed to be watching the vod right now

2228
08:10:27,639 --> 08:10:31,400
just i'm sorry i'm sorry that you had to watch that for like 40 straight minutes

2229
08:10:31,400 --> 08:10:39,799
i direct these missiles behind me that god is like there's like 2,700 people like 400 people told

2230
08:10:39,799 --> 08:10:44,759
me to use the rail gun and to like grind to get the rail gun so i listened it was it was it was

2231
08:10:44,759 --> 08:10:51,720
like four or five hundred people a lot of people and i thought that you were giving me tactical

2232
08:10:51,720 --> 08:11:15,000
information the caterpillar things first that's an iron clad battle tactic or i was just pretending

2233
08:11:15,000 --> 08:11:22,549
the whole time use what you're shooting mr president but that's so bad knowing that how

2234
08:11:22,549 --> 08:11:27,669
how easy this level is can you imagine not even not only forget about the people that are watching

2235
08:11:27,669 --> 08:11:31,590
the vod right now can you imagine the people who are watching the stream right now who have

2236
08:11:31,590 --> 08:11:37,270
played through this game and know that and were lost in the sea of get railgun and they know how

2237
08:11:37,270 --> 08:11:42,939
easy this was

2238
08:12:05,130 --> 08:12:13,290
i'm absolutely happy to have it mostly 95% of it be this game what a journey it's been it's been

2239
08:12:13,290 --> 08:12:20,650
fucking wild you've heard me say like fuck you've heard me say like shit you've heard me go

2240
08:12:20,650 --> 08:12:25,450
it's just ridiculous this game is fucking crazy you've heard that a few times we've got a few

2241
08:12:25,450 --> 08:12:47,459
things here nice shooting mr president but there's many a slip between the cup and the lip

2242
08:13:00,099 --> 08:13:07,400
what's happening wait this is oh yeah no i won first i thought it was all right we went

2243

2245
08:13:23,849 --> 08:13:32,490
the enemy seems to be concentrating their power around the white rub defense forces predicted to

2246
08:13:32,490 --> 08:13:38,490
be on hand the shape of this underground base is highly complicated there is a strong possibility

2247
08:13:38,490 --> 08:13:43,770
that the target area is closely coordinated skillfully attacked to prevent reinforcements

2248
08:13:43,770 --> 08:13:50,090
and coordination between target areas this is the grand daddy grand daddy battle of the mall

2249
08:13:50,090 --> 08:13:56,090
annihilate the target areas and take half the white house by the call name the call name take

2287
08:21:15,509 --> 08:21:21,590
the above ground route has been sealed off but if you take back the underground bay

2288
08:21:21,590 --> 08:21:30,580
the enemy will surrender and open the barrier now aim for the target areas got it now get out there

2289

2297
08:23:39,849 --> 08:24:25,619
okay

2298
08:25:25,619 --> 08:25:30,310
right

2299
08:25:43,909 --> 08:25:48,970
Oh, I got it. All right, fine.

2300
08:25:55,959 --> 08:26:23,400
A lot of trees. Cold. Snowy.

2301
08:26:23,400 --> 08:26:34,009
I mean, I can French, so...

2302
08:26:34,009 --> 08:26:40,409
It's a really nice place.

2303
08:26:40,409 --> 08:26:42,409
I love, uh...

2304
08:26:42,409 --> 08:26:45,290
I miss, I miss Toronto.

2305
08:26:45,290 --> 08:26:49,959
Some good restaurants.

2306
08:27:05,319 --> 08:27:07,580
It's a good place.

2307
08:27:07,580 --> 08:27:12,590
There's a couple of great, there's like four or five really, really great barbecue places in Toronto.

2308
08:27:12,590 --> 08:27:24,189
It's like bar, if you like think like barbecue, that's a great place to go.

2309
08:27:24,189 --> 08:27:25,189
Game's too long.

2310
08:27:25,189 --> 08:27:28,349
Fixed it.

2311
08:27:28,349 --> 08:27:35,900
I said that, I said that, uh...

2312
08:27:35,900 --> 08:27:38,900
When you think barbecue, you really want to be there.

2313
08:27:38,900 --> 08:27:40,900
It's got some of the best barbecue places in the country.

2314
08:27:40,900 --> 08:27:48,139
I'm too quiet? What did I do?

2315
08:27:48,139 --> 08:28:03,560
All the way through here and then...

2316
08:28:03,560 --> 08:28:06,560
It's not too quiet, now it's... I've got it.

2317
08:28:10,810 --> 08:28:22,900
I gotta go in a different tunnel, I think.

2318
08:28:22,900 --> 08:28:38,709
Close. Oh, a bomb.

2319
08:28:38,709 --> 08:28:43,909
Why did I blow the other one up? Why would I do that? I don't understand.

2320
08:28:44,909 --> 08:28:58,720
Poutine? Oh, yeah.

2321
08:28:58,720 --> 08:29:00,720
For those who didn't know, I'm not from Canada.

2322
08:29:00,720 --> 08:29:04,720
Poutine is a dish, it's a french fries gravy.

2323
08:29:04,720 --> 08:29:05,720
And, um...

2324
08:29:05,720 --> 08:29:08,720
Sometimes it depends on what the certain restaurant...

2325
08:29:08,720 --> 08:29:10,720
My mother used to make it.

2326
08:29:10,720 --> 08:29:13,720
With gravy and little like kind of dollops of cheese, like chunks of cheese.

2327
08:29:20,720 --> 08:29:21,720
Oh, let me do this again.

2328
08:29:21,720 --> 08:29:23,720
I have to do this shit again.

2329
08:29:37,369 --> 08:29:39,369
Well, I have to do this now.

2330
08:29:39,369 --> 08:29:59,340
Destroy it!

2331
08:30:23,619 --> 08:30:26,180
I win. Did I actually do it?

2332
08:30:27,180 --> 08:30:29,990
They surrendered, why are they still attacking?

2333
08:30:40,380 --> 08:30:41,380
What's next?

2334
08:31:00,139 --> 08:31:02,139
Leave a level?

2335
08:31:02,139 --> 08:31:08,779
Secure a path.

2336
08:31:08,779 --> 08:31:21,540
Secure a path. Calm down, you just got a bomb.

2337
08:31:21,540 --> 08:31:23,540
You hear me right now? I'm doing just fine.

2338
08:31:23,540 --> 08:31:34,770
Right there, right there, right there, right there, right there.

2339
08:31:52,520 --> 08:32:01,529
Here?

2340
08:32:01,529 --> 08:32:06,009
How did I trip and explode?

2341
08:32:06,009 --> 08:32:08,009
Here's the final fight.

2342
08:32:08,009 --> 08:32:10,009
I don't want to blow this.

2343
08:32:12,759 --> 08:32:15,580
God damn it.

2344
08:32:18,580 --> 08:32:20,580
I have to do all that again if I lose.

2345
08:32:20,580 --> 08:32:22,580
And this is a bad loadout.

2346
08:32:22,580 --> 08:32:24,580
This is a terrible loadout.

2347
08:32:28,580 --> 08:32:31,459
I don't know what the hell I'm going to do about this.

2348
08:32:32,459 --> 08:32:36,459
Mr. President, the fuselage damage rate is above 50%.

2349
08:32:36,459 --> 08:32:40,459
Mr. President, the fuselage damage rate is over 70%.

2350
08:32:40,459 --> 08:32:44,459
A scaredy cat missile is being protected in a sturdy shelter.

2351
08:32:44,459 --> 08:32:48,459
When the shelter opens, that's your chance to win.

2352
08:33:28,049 --> 08:33:36,880
She's dead.

2353
08:33:36,880 --> 08:33:59,729
That didn't, I can't believe that didn't kill her.

2354
08:33:59,729 --> 08:34:04,209
What the fuck?

2355
08:34:04,209 --> 08:34:08,740
What?

2356
08:34:08,740 --> 08:34:10,740
Oh my god, what just hit me?

2357
08:34:10,740 --> 08:34:15,130
I need health or something right now.

2358
08:34:15,130 --> 08:34:26,459
Health, somewhere.

2359
08:34:26,459 --> 08:34:28,459
Shields, anything.

2360
08:34:28,459 --> 08:34:30,459
I don't want money.

2361
08:34:30,459 --> 08:34:32,759
There we go, thank you.

2362
08:34:32,759 --> 08:34:37,580
Bullshit.

2363
08:34:37,580 --> 08:34:54,099
Well, this gave me a good opportunity to get rid of literally the $800,000 beach ball ray gun.

2364
08:34:54,099 --> 08:34:58,470
That doesn't do anything.

2365
08:34:58,470 --> 08:35:15,139
I'm going to kill the tank like three more times.

2366
08:35:15,139 --> 08:35:21,580
Three more times.

2367
08:35:54,830 --> 08:36:04,049
I'm playing Diablo 3, you hear this?

2368
08:36:27,459 --> 08:36:34,119
Bastion sucks.

2369
08:36:34,119 --> 08:36:38,380
I'm leaning back in my chair.

2370
08:36:38,380 --> 08:36:41,439
I think that's enough, I think.

2371
08:36:45,439 --> 08:36:54,299
Manufacture bazookas.

2372
08:36:54,299 --> 08:36:59,819
So this is the thing that I currently own, right?

2373
08:36:59,819 --> 08:37:01,819
I still have no metal.

2374
08:37:01,819 --> 08:37:04,380
It sucks.

2375
08:37:04,380 --> 08:37:08,220
Rare metal required.

2376
08:37:08,220 --> 08:37:14,229
I'm going to piss my pants.

2377
08:37:14,229 --> 08:37:15,229
I've got to go pee.

2378
08:37:15,229 --> 08:37:16,229
I have to.

2379
08:37:16,229 --> 08:37:18,229
I'll be right back.

2380
08:37:18,229 --> 08:39:43,659
Usually when I come back from peeing, I'm like, I feel better.

2381
08:39:43,659 --> 08:39:47,020
What is this rare metal dog shit?

2382
08:39:47,020 --> 08:39:49,020
What is the point of this?

2383
08:39:49,020 --> 08:39:54,360
It's just money.

2384
08:39:54,360 --> 08:39:56,360
It's just like a number.

2385
08:39:56,360 --> 08:40:16,779
Alright, I am going to...

2386
08:40:16,779 --> 08:40:18,979
I don't know.

2387
08:40:18,979 --> 08:40:21,540
I need to think of something.

2388
08:40:21,540 --> 08:40:26,779
I bought everything I can buy.

2389
08:40:26,779 --> 08:40:27,779
Get the Gatling gun.

2390
08:40:27,779 --> 08:40:28,779
How far down?

2391
08:40:28,779 --> 08:40:29,779
Where is that?

2392
08:40:29,779 --> 08:40:47,810
934.

2393
08:40:48,810 --> 08:40:54,439
Well, I don't have enough to get it.

2394
08:40:54,439 --> 08:40:58,919
This is going to be a better loadout.

2395
08:40:58,919 --> 08:40:59,919
I'll try this again.

2396
08:40:59,919 --> 08:41:02,919
I'm only going to seriously give this another couple of attempts.

2397
08:41:02,919 --> 08:41:06,919
I can't stream for like 10, 11 hours.

2398
08:41:06,919 --> 08:41:08,540
I can't.

2399
08:41:08,540 --> 08:41:10,540
My brain will fucking melt.

2400
08:41:10,540 --> 08:41:12,540
I'm going to stick with this.

2401
08:41:12,540 --> 08:41:15,619
Get rid of this thing.

2402
08:41:15,619 --> 08:41:23,340
I need some assault rifles because...

2403
08:41:23,340 --> 08:41:26,220
Alright.

2404
08:41:26,220 --> 08:41:27,220
What are you doing?

2405
08:41:27,220 --> 08:42:28,110
What am I doing?

2406
08:42:28,110 --> 08:42:31,419
The game would not let me select this item.

2407
08:42:31,419 --> 08:42:35,419
It was glitching out and making it impossible to click.

2408
08:42:35,419 --> 08:42:37,419
So I had to do it manually with the keyboard.

2409
08:42:37,419 --> 08:42:53,889
I'm not sure this is going to be very effective here.

2410
08:42:53,889 --> 08:42:56,889
Maybe I'll just run around with the flame thrower and just hold it down.

2411
08:42:56,889 --> 08:42:58,889
This would be better.

2412
08:42:58,889 --> 08:43:04,299
I think this is alright.

2413
08:43:04,299 --> 08:43:06,990
Get the Gatling gun.

2414
08:43:06,990 --> 08:43:15,340
Manufacture.

2415
08:43:15,340 --> 08:43:23,119
The VP's go-to machine gun fires multiple powerful rounds.

2416
08:43:23,119 --> 08:43:30,389
I need $22,000 worth of metal.

2417
08:43:30,389 --> 08:43:33,389
Getting rid of the beach ball gun and two machine guns should help a lot.

2418
08:43:33,389 --> 08:43:35,389
I'm going to go for it.

2419
08:43:35,389 --> 08:43:37,080
Let's go.

2420
08:43:37,080 --> 08:43:38,080
I got to go.

2421
08:43:38,080 --> 08:43:40,080
I got to get out of here.

2422
08:43:40,080 --> 08:43:41,080
I'm streaming tomorrow.

2423
08:43:41,080 --> 08:43:43,080
Tomorrow is going to be an intense stream too.

2424
08:43:43,080 --> 08:43:46,080
So why the fuck am I streaming for 10 hours today?

2425
08:43:46,080 --> 08:43:48,080
Tomorrow is going to be all over the place.

2426
08:43:48,080 --> 08:44:08,419
I'll try to make this clear.

2427
08:44:08,419 --> 08:44:10,419
Yeah, we're going to start at the regular time tomorrow.

2428
08:44:10,419 --> 08:44:12,419
Probably closer to 4.

2429
08:44:12,419 --> 08:44:15,619
You forced yourself to beat this.

2430
08:44:15,619 --> 08:44:16,619
I know it.

2431
08:44:16,619 --> 08:44:28,200
I'm upset about it.

2432
08:44:28,200 --> 08:44:32,810
What is that guy doing?

2433
08:44:32,810 --> 08:44:34,810
At least he's like the car in the game.

2434
08:44:34,810 --> 08:44:36,810
Did he actually get in?

2435
08:44:36,810 --> 08:44:58,529
He got in.

2436
08:44:58,529 --> 08:45:12,139
Put on the regular machine gun.

2437
08:45:12,139 --> 08:45:14,139
I'll take this thing.

2438
08:45:14,139 --> 08:45:23,180
I should go this way.

2439
08:45:23,180 --> 08:45:24,180
We're doing jazz dance tomorrow?

2440
08:45:24,180 --> 08:45:28,180
No, we're doing you're in the movies.

2441
08:45:28,180 --> 08:45:37,830
The gas one.

2442
08:45:37,830 --> 08:46:02,220
Yes, it's me.

2443
08:46:02,220 --> 08:46:03,220
Speaking please.

2444
08:46:03,220 --> 08:46:12,180
Who is it?

2445
08:46:12,180 --> 08:46:13,180
Alright, that's it.

2446
08:46:13,180 --> 08:46:14,180
Now we go straight down.

2447
08:46:14,180 --> 08:46:19,740
I have to take out the helicopters.

2448
08:46:19,740 --> 08:46:22,819
Those are things that cause so many problems.

2449
08:46:22,819 --> 08:46:24,819
Why can I not lock on?

2450
08:46:24,819 --> 08:46:38,549
Alright, let's go.

2451
08:46:38,549 --> 08:46:47,490
I got to pick up some shields.

2452
08:46:47,490 --> 08:46:51,490
I'm going to need them so badly for the next part.

2453
08:46:51,490 --> 08:47:37,490
I need shields.

2454
08:47:37,490 --> 08:47:39,490
Please drop a shield for me.

2455
08:47:39,490 --> 08:47:41,490
For me.

2456
08:47:41,490 --> 08:47:57,790
Did I get one?

2457
08:47:57,790 --> 08:47:58,790
Shields.

2458
08:47:58,790 --> 08:48:09,419
This whole thing is black and yellow.

2459
08:48:09,419 --> 08:48:11,419
I don't even know if I'm still streaming.

2460
08:48:11,419 --> 08:48:15,319
Am I?

2461
08:48:15,319 --> 08:48:16,500
I am, right?

2462
08:48:16,500 --> 08:48:17,500
Yes.

2463
08:48:17,500 --> 08:48:38,169
To the left.

2464
08:48:38,169 --> 08:48:47,380
We're a pre-recorded chat.

2465
08:48:47,380 --> 08:48:49,819
At least you're here.

2466
08:48:49,819 --> 08:48:55,340
More bombs.

2467
08:48:55,340 --> 08:48:57,340
I can't detonate these on my own.

2468
08:48:57,340 --> 08:49:00,340
I guess I can, but you have to really do it precisely.

2469
08:49:00,340 --> 08:49:13,740
I remember this part.

2470
08:49:13,740 --> 08:49:17,560
It sucks.

2471
08:49:17,560 --> 08:49:26,650
You can't move carelessly until the radar jamming station is destroyed.

2472
08:49:26,650 --> 08:49:43,060
Can you marry me?

2473
08:49:43,060 --> 08:49:44,360
Nope.

2474
08:49:44,360 --> 08:50:00,130
Says you.

2475
08:50:00,130 --> 08:50:01,130
Whatever.

2476
08:50:01,130 --> 08:50:03,750
I think I'm doing a good job.

2477
08:50:03,750 --> 08:50:10,880
What?

2478
08:50:10,880 --> 08:50:13,250
What's the matter?

2479
08:50:13,250 --> 08:50:14,250
That's cold.

2480
08:50:14,250 --> 08:50:15,250
How is that cold?

2481
08:50:15,250 --> 08:50:33,939
Hopefully I was not downstairs.

2482
08:50:33,939 --> 08:50:44,110
I'm going to do it, guys.

2483
08:50:44,110 --> 08:50:46,180
I'm going to do it.

2484
08:50:46,180 --> 08:50:48,180
I'm going to do it this turn.

2485
08:50:48,180 --> 08:50:50,180
And there's going to be celebrations.

2486
08:50:50,180 --> 08:51:25,779
I would marry Jerma and then divorce him so I get half of what he gets every stream.

2487
08:51:25,779 --> 08:51:44,340
That's not...

2488
08:51:44,340 --> 08:51:46,340
And you guys are calling me cold.

2489
08:51:46,340 --> 08:51:54,000
Me cool.

2490
08:51:54,000 --> 08:51:55,000
All right, I'm good.

2491
08:51:55,000 --> 08:51:56,000
It's time.

2492
08:51:56,000 --> 08:51:57,000
I'm ready.

2493
08:51:57,000 --> 08:51:58,000
Let's get...

2494
08:51:58,000 --> 08:52:00,000
I got full health bar.

2495
08:52:00,000 --> 08:52:02,180
I'm going for...

2496
08:52:02,180 --> 08:52:04,180
What do you think?

2497
08:52:04,180 --> 08:52:05,180
Super launcher.

2498
08:52:05,180 --> 08:52:08,180
And just a standard...

2499
08:52:08,180 --> 08:52:09,180
Faithful here.

2500
08:52:09,180 --> 08:52:38,659
Are you guys still alive?

2501
08:52:38,659 --> 08:52:49,619
Arms.

2502
08:52:49,619 --> 08:52:55,279
Ammo.

2503
08:52:55,279 --> 08:52:56,279
Good.

2504
08:52:56,279 --> 08:52:57,279
Okay.

2505
08:52:57,279 --> 08:53:01,270
Here we go.

2506
08:53:01,270 --> 08:53:02,270
I got to get ready for this.

2507
08:53:02,270 --> 08:53:04,270
I need something that can lock on, though.

2508
08:53:04,270 --> 08:53:07,270
So I think I'm going to have to stick with this.

2509
08:53:07,270 --> 08:53:10,270
I need something to lock on to those helicopters.

2510
08:53:13,750 --> 08:53:14,750
This is it.

2511
08:53:14,750 --> 08:53:16,380
This is the one.

2512
08:53:16,380 --> 08:53:18,380
I am going to do it right here, right now.

2513
08:53:18,380 --> 08:53:20,380
It's time to...

2514
08:53:20,380 --> 08:53:22,380
It's time to...

2515
08:53:41,459 --> 08:53:58,369
We're good.

2516
08:53:58,369 --> 08:54:01,369
Let's get rid of all the bullshit ammo in the place over here.

2517
08:54:02,610 --> 08:54:53,209
We're halfway there.

2518
08:54:54,209 --> 08:55:00,099
Take the hand.

2519
08:55:00,099 --> 08:55:02,340
Make us win.

2520
08:55:03,340 --> 08:55:19,909
To boomer, I will divorce you.

2521
08:55:22,909 --> 08:55:23,909
Right?

2522
08:55:23,909 --> 08:55:33,459
What?

2523
08:55:33,459 --> 08:55:34,459
Was I not supposed to do this?

2524
08:55:34,459 --> 08:55:35,459
What happened?

2525
08:55:35,459 --> 08:55:36,459
Was I not supposed to do that?

2526
08:55:36,459 --> 08:55:37,459
What happened?

2527
08:55:37,459 --> 08:55:38,459
What happened?

2528
08:55:38,459 --> 08:55:39,459
What happened?

2529
08:55:39,459 --> 08:55:40,459
What happened?

2530
08:55:40,459 --> 08:55:41,459
What happened?

2531
08:55:41,459 --> 08:55:42,459
What happened?

2532
08:55:42,459 --> 08:55:43,459
What happened?

2533
08:55:43,459 --> 08:56:14,369
I destroyed the White House?

2534
08:56:14,369 --> 08:56:15,369
But why?

2535
08:56:15,369 --> 08:56:17,930
I can't shoot it.

2536
08:56:17,930 --> 08:56:18,930
I just...

2537
08:56:18,930 --> 08:56:20,930
I was doing fine.

2538
08:56:20,930 --> 08:56:23,099
I was doing fine there.

2539
08:56:23,099 --> 08:56:24,099
I really was.

2540
08:56:24,099 --> 08:56:25,099
I had to...

2541
08:56:25,099 --> 08:56:27,099
I can't hit the White House.

2542
08:56:27,099 --> 08:56:32,970
You can only destroy the armor.

2543
08:56:32,970 --> 08:56:41,380
Why do you think it had a health bar?

2544
08:56:41,380 --> 08:56:43,380
Because I thought I had to...

2545
08:56:43,380 --> 08:56:44,939
I don't know.

2546
08:56:44,939 --> 08:56:47,939
I didn't think I was going to kill the whole thing.

2547
08:56:56,819 --> 08:57:02,790
Fuck.

2548
08:57:02,790 --> 08:57:04,790
I was so close.

2549
08:57:04,790 --> 08:57:05,790
I didn't know that, though.

2550
08:57:05,790 --> 08:57:19,380
Hold on.

2551
08:57:19,380 --> 08:57:22,610
Hold on.

2552
08:57:22,610 --> 08:57:23,610
I'm going to do it.

2553
08:57:23,610 --> 08:57:24,610
I'll be fine.

2554
08:57:35,380 --> 08:57:37,380
In Canada, there was a saying growing up.

2555
08:57:37,380 --> 08:57:39,380
My mother, who's French.

2556
08:57:39,380 --> 08:57:42,580
I think you guys have it in English, too.

2557
08:57:45,849 --> 08:57:47,849
I think it's in English.

2558
08:57:47,849 --> 08:57:48,849
It's...

2559
08:57:52,849 --> 08:57:54,849
Which my mother told me that translated to,

2560
08:57:54,849 --> 08:57:57,849
if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

2561
08:57:57,849 --> 08:58:03,479
That's a little saying we have here in Canada.

2562
08:58:32,439 --> 08:58:34,439
I'm going to beat this.

2563
08:58:34,439 --> 08:58:35,439
I'm going to beat this.

2564
08:58:35,439 --> 08:58:38,439
And it's going to be the end of my channel.

2565
08:58:38,439 --> 08:58:41,439
Because after I beat it, I'm going to be so exhausted

2566
08:58:41,439 --> 08:58:42,439
that I'm going to scream.

2567
08:58:42,439 --> 08:58:44,439
They're going to have to take a real backseat.

2568
08:58:50,610 --> 08:58:53,169
I'm going to have to go to the spa after this.

2569
08:58:53,169 --> 08:58:54,169
I will beat this.

2570
08:58:54,169 --> 08:58:55,169
Can't beat this.

2571
08:58:55,169 --> 08:59:00,889
I will beat this.

2572
08:59:00,889 --> 08:59:03,060
We just crossed the 10-hour border.

2573
08:59:03,060 --> 08:59:04,060
I was going to give up.

2574
08:59:04,060 --> 08:59:05,060
Remember, I was, like, raging.

2575
08:59:05,060 --> 08:59:06,060
Like...

2576
08:59:07,060 --> 08:59:08,060
It was just like a five.

2577
08:59:08,060 --> 08:59:10,060
What did Ajin give this?

2578
08:59:13,240 --> 08:59:14,240
That's all.

2579
08:59:14,240 --> 08:59:15,240
That's all I heard.

2580
08:59:15,240 --> 08:59:16,240
Not anymore.

2581
08:59:17,610 --> 08:59:18,610
Turn him.

2582
08:59:18,610 --> 08:59:32,330
I'm going to...

2583
08:59:32,330 --> 08:59:43,229
Yeah, that's good.

2584
08:59:43,229 --> 08:59:45,229
It was three hours ago and you almost quit.

2585
08:59:45,229 --> 08:59:47,229
That's so bad.

2586
08:59:49,939 --> 08:59:50,939
That's so bad.

2587
08:59:50,939 --> 08:59:51,939
He's so bad.

2588
08:59:51,939 --> 08:59:53,939
He's so bad.

2589
08:59:53,939 --> 08:59:57,310
Has he even stomped one time?

2590
09:00:00,130 --> 09:00:01,130
Guys, I just can't...

2591
09:00:01,130 --> 09:00:02,130
Has he even stomped?

2592
09:00:02,130 --> 09:00:04,130
He's fucking bad.

2593
09:00:05,130 --> 09:00:16,610
Let's just keep going straight through.

2594
09:00:17,610 --> 09:00:26,020
All right, so if it was...

2595
09:00:26,020 --> 09:00:27,020
If we were, like, in a real-life scenario,

2596
09:00:27,020 --> 09:00:28,020
where, like, you know, you...

2597
09:00:28,020 --> 09:00:29,020
Oh, hey, welcome.

2598
09:00:29,020 --> 09:00:30,020
Come to the German 95.

2599
09:00:30,020 --> 09:00:32,020
Twitch, meet and greet.

2600
09:00:33,020 --> 09:00:34,020
And, like, I'm like, hey, what's up?

2601
09:00:34,020 --> 09:00:35,020
How are you?

2602
09:00:35,020 --> 09:00:37,020
And we were kind of waiting to say hello and show up.

2603
09:00:37,020 --> 09:00:40,020
And would you say, dude, you're fucking bad at games?

2604
09:00:40,020 --> 09:00:41,020
I don't think you would.

2605
09:00:42,020 --> 09:00:43,959
I think you'd be like...

2606
09:00:53,220 --> 09:00:59,619
I think you'd be like, oh, Jeremy.

2607
09:00:59,619 --> 09:01:00,619
It's such an honor to meet you.

2608
09:01:01,619 --> 09:01:20,819
Remember when you full cocked your head backwards

2609
09:01:20,819 --> 09:01:32,939
and fully catapulted down to your head

2610
09:01:32,939 --> 09:01:34,939
and pushed through your desk?

2611
09:01:35,939 --> 09:01:36,939
That was...

2612
09:01:36,939 --> 09:01:37,939
Wow, that was ridiculous.

2613
09:01:37,939 --> 09:01:38,939
I can't believe you actually could do that.

2614
09:01:40,939 --> 09:01:41,939
The desk went in the hand.

2615
09:01:41,939 --> 09:01:43,939
You didn't even need to use your hands.

2616
09:02:12,490 --> 09:02:14,299
86.

2617
09:02:15,299 --> 09:02:21,150
So when is the German meetup?

2618
09:02:21,150 --> 09:02:22,150
I'm not...

2619
09:02:22,150 --> 09:02:23,150
I'm not doing one on Twitch, please.

2620
09:02:23,150 --> 09:02:24,150
This is a bomb.

2621
09:02:25,150 --> 09:02:51,799
Wait up.

2622
09:02:52,799 --> 09:02:53,799
Find that meetup.

2623
09:02:53,799 --> 09:02:54,799
Go find Dr. Bob.

2624
09:02:55,799 --> 09:02:57,799
I'm gonna find Dr. Bob.

2625
09:02:58,799 --> 09:03:00,869
I'm sorry.

2626
09:03:01,869 --> 09:03:12,840
We may able...

2627
09:03:12,840 --> 09:03:13,840
We may be able to...

2628
09:03:13,840 --> 09:03:14,840
We may be able...

2629
09:03:14,840 --> 09:03:15,840
We may be able to...

2630
09:03:19,270 --> 09:03:21,599
Your income is over.

2631
09:03:22,599 --> 09:03:31,139
Oh, all right.

2632
09:03:31,139 --> 09:03:38,139
So don't destroy any...

2633
09:03:38,139 --> 09:03:39,139
Just do it now.

2634
09:03:40,139 --> 09:03:44,259
You know, like, why...

2635
09:03:44,259 --> 09:03:46,259
I'm not gonna use it on the actual White House.

2636
09:03:47,259 --> 09:03:48,259
Why don't you just do it now?

2637
09:03:49,259 --> 09:03:50,259
I can't use it on the White House.

2638
09:03:51,259 --> 09:03:52,259
I mean, you know...

2639
09:03:56,259 --> 09:03:57,259
Should I stop swearing?

2640
09:03:57,259 --> 09:03:58,259
My mother...

2641
09:03:58,259 --> 09:03:59,259
Actually, my mother told me recently.

2642
09:04:01,259 --> 09:04:02,259
She said, you should stop swearing.

2643
09:04:03,259 --> 09:04:04,259
I was like, yeah.

2644
09:04:04,259 --> 09:04:07,349
I was like, I've tried that before, mom.

2645
09:04:08,349 --> 09:04:11,680
She was like, it's not a good book for the former.

2646
09:04:12,680 --> 09:04:14,750
I was like, you know what?

2647
09:04:14,750 --> 09:04:15,750
You're up.

2648
09:04:16,750 --> 09:04:22,020
From now on.

2649
09:04:24,020 --> 09:04:28,700
Oh, no!

2650
09:04:28,700 --> 09:04:29,700
Oh, my...

2651
09:04:29,700 --> 09:04:30,700
Please.

2652
09:04:30,700 --> 09:04:31,700
Oh, my God.

2653
09:04:31,700 --> 09:04:32,700
Oh, my God.

2654
09:04:32,700 --> 09:04:33,700
What happened?

2655
09:04:33,700 --> 09:04:34,700
Why did I do that?

2656
09:04:34,700 --> 09:04:35,700
I tried...

2657
09:04:35,700 --> 09:04:36,700
I didn't have enough boost.

2658
09:04:36,700 --> 09:04:37,700
Oh, my God.

2659
09:04:37,700 --> 09:04:39,700
And I have two things left.

2660
09:04:39,700 --> 09:04:40,700
I can't fucking believe it.

2661
09:04:41,700 --> 09:04:42,700
I can't believe it.

2662
09:04:42,700 --> 09:04:45,700
I just want to get out of this stupid area.

2663
09:04:46,700 --> 09:04:47,700
Oh, my God.

2664
09:04:47,700 --> 09:04:48,700
I need to look for a shield.

2665
09:04:48,700 --> 09:04:49,700
I have to.

2666
09:04:49,700 --> 09:04:50,700
Otherwise, there's no way I'm going to do this.

2667
09:04:59,090 --> 09:05:00,090
Mine's in the hallway.

2668
09:05:01,090 --> 09:05:03,090
Sloppy goddamn hallway.

2669
09:05:03,090 --> 09:05:04,090
Look, mine's in it.

2670
09:05:05,090 --> 09:05:06,090
Just in case.

2671
09:05:07,090 --> 09:05:08,090
Let's just lay him down.

2672
09:05:15,409 --> 09:05:16,409
I can't believe it.

2673
09:05:16,409 --> 09:05:17,409
I had full health too.

2674
09:05:17,409 --> 09:05:20,409
Mine's do like two full bars.

2675
09:05:20,409 --> 09:05:21,409
Why would they...

2676
09:05:21,409 --> 09:05:23,409
Why would they do that much damage?

2677
09:05:24,409 --> 09:05:39,380
I got the offensive augment.

2678
09:05:39,380 --> 09:05:42,009
I'm so happy about this.

2679
09:05:47,979 --> 09:05:57,009
Ten hours, and I can't manage the boost.

2680
09:05:57,009 --> 09:05:59,009
Yeah, I've been sitting here for ten hours.

2681
09:06:00,009 --> 09:06:05,380
Albert Einstein, if he was sitting in the chair for ten hours playing this game, would not be able to do that.

2682
09:06:06,380 --> 09:06:20,480
Thanks for the warning.

2683
09:06:27,480 --> 09:06:35,989
Albert Einstein wouldn't even have my stim right now.

2684
09:06:35,989 --> 09:06:36,989
Are you serious?

2685
09:06:37,989 --> 09:06:41,879
He'd write like a few theories and then go to bed.

2686
09:06:42,879 --> 09:06:54,230
Oops.

2687
09:06:54,230 --> 09:06:55,230
No, no, whatever.

2688
09:06:55,230 --> 09:06:56,230
He's probably here.

2689
09:06:57,230 --> 09:07:06,410
Peace.

2690
09:07:07,410 --> 09:07:08,410
And I'm dead.

2691
09:07:08,410 --> 09:07:09,410
Somehow.

2692
09:07:09,410 --> 09:07:10,410
I got like sandwiched.

2693
09:07:10,410 --> 09:07:11,410
I thought these guys were dead.

2694
09:07:14,349 --> 09:07:15,349
We have to do this whole thing again.

2695
09:07:16,349 --> 09:07:22,199
Presidents.

2696
09:07:22,199 --> 09:07:28,449
That's going to be a Christmas miracle if I'm able to do this.

2697
09:07:29,449 --> 09:07:30,449
Look at my ammo.

2698
09:07:30,449 --> 09:07:51,949
All this shit going on in this next area.

2699
09:07:52,949 --> 09:07:55,779
Trouble.

2700
09:07:55,779 --> 09:07:57,779
What am I going to do here?

2701
09:07:58,779 --> 09:08:03,339
I have to stick to this.

2702
09:08:03,339 --> 09:08:04,339
The thing I was doing before.

2703
09:08:04,339 --> 09:08:07,339
Except this time don't like accidentally destroy the whole White House.

2704
09:08:08,339 --> 09:08:12,019
Like I did before.

2705
09:08:12,019 --> 09:08:13,019
Somehow.

2706
09:08:13,019 --> 09:08:14,019
I'm going to go actually look around for ammo.

2707
09:08:21,629 --> 09:08:22,629
This box is back here.

2708
09:08:25,629 --> 09:08:26,629
What are you fucking doing?

2709
09:08:26,629 --> 09:08:28,190
Okay, I found a couple.

2710
09:08:29,190 --> 09:08:30,190
I found two.

2711
09:08:30,190 --> 09:08:32,190
I'm going to actually go to the other side.

2712
09:08:32,190 --> 09:08:33,190
There's more boxes over here.

2713
09:08:37,190 --> 09:08:45,540
What was that?

2714
09:08:45,540 --> 09:08:47,349
Some help.

2715
09:08:47,349 --> 09:08:50,769
Got to get rid of the helicopters.

2716
09:08:51,769 --> 09:08:56,019
Oh, there's the tanks.

2717
09:09:01,099 --> 09:09:02,099
There's two tanks.

2718
09:09:02,099 --> 09:09:04,099
They just spawned in here.

2719
09:09:05,099 --> 09:09:10,919
Not destroy the White House.

2720
09:09:18,239 --> 09:09:19,239
I see a shield over there.

2721
09:09:20,239 --> 09:09:21,239
I see one.

2722
09:09:21,239 --> 09:09:24,139
Got it.

2723
09:09:24,139 --> 09:09:25,139
Okay.

2724
09:09:25,139 --> 09:09:26,139
Do just fine.

2725
09:09:26,139 --> 09:09:27,139
Just relax.

2726
09:09:27,139 --> 09:09:28,139
Pull back.

2727
09:09:32,760 --> 09:09:33,760
Go to the right side now.

2728
09:09:33,760 --> 09:10:00,339
Here we go.

2729
09:10:00,339 --> 09:10:01,339
Come on.

2730
09:10:06,169 --> 09:10:07,169
To the knees.

2731
09:10:07,169 --> 09:10:08,169
Oh shit.

2732
09:10:08,169 --> 09:10:09,169
Bullshit.

2733
09:10:21,059 --> 09:10:22,680
Percy.

2734
09:10:22,680 --> 09:10:26,349
What's that mean?

2735
09:10:26,349 --> 09:10:27,349
Don't hit the White House.

2736
09:10:34,779 --> 09:10:36,779
I got so much more important stuff going on than that.

2737
09:10:36,779 --> 09:10:37,779
Here we go.

2738
09:10:37,779 --> 09:10:38,779
All right.

2739
09:10:38,779 --> 09:10:39,779
In a good spot.

2740
09:10:40,779 --> 09:10:46,769
Do not shoot the fucking under the armor's skin.

2741
09:10:49,349 --> 09:10:50,349
Clear the whole area.

2742
09:10:50,349 --> 09:10:52,730
Dumb.

2743
09:10:52,730 --> 09:10:54,730
I am intensely focusing right now.

2744
09:10:54,730 --> 09:10:58,080
There it is.

2745
09:10:58,080 --> 09:10:59,080
I got plenty of ammo.

2746
09:11:00,080 --> 09:11:01,080
Get rid of this little base over.

2747
09:11:01,080 --> 09:11:02,080
Don't see that one.

2748
09:11:03,080 --> 09:11:04,080
Come for missiles.

2749
09:11:04,080 --> 09:11:05,080
Just relax.

2750
09:11:06,080 --> 09:11:07,080
It's not a big deal.

2751
09:11:07,080 --> 09:11:08,080
You've handled way worse.

2752
09:11:09,080 --> 09:11:27,019
Okay.

2753
09:11:27,019 --> 09:11:28,019
I could be very upset about it.

2754
09:11:28,019 --> 09:11:29,019
I could be very mad about that.

2755
09:11:29,019 --> 09:11:30,019
But I'm not going to be.

2756
09:11:31,019 --> 09:11:38,470
Nope.

2757
09:11:38,470 --> 09:11:39,470
Doing just fine.

2758
09:11:39,470 --> 09:11:40,470
Good.

2759
09:11:40,470 --> 09:11:41,470
Nice job.

2760
09:11:41,470 --> 09:11:43,709
I would shit my hand right now.

2761
09:11:43,709 --> 09:12:03,059
It's nice and easy.

2762
09:12:03,059 --> 09:12:04,059
Just nice and easy.

2763
09:12:04,059 --> 09:12:05,059
Don't hurt anything.

2764
09:12:05,059 --> 09:12:06,059
It's nice and easy.

2765
09:12:07,059 --> 09:12:09,519
It's going to open again.

2766
09:12:10,519 --> 09:12:13,489
Wait for it to open.

2767
09:12:13,489 --> 09:12:14,489
Do not shoot that.

2768
09:12:14,489 --> 09:12:16,489
Why is it on my display?

2769
09:12:16,489 --> 09:12:18,489
Why is it on my heads up display?

2770
09:12:18,489 --> 09:12:23,250
Off the side.

2771
09:12:23,250 --> 09:12:26,769
Clear the trash.

2772
09:12:26,769 --> 09:12:27,769
Right there.

2773
09:12:27,769 --> 09:12:28,769
Open up.

2774
09:12:28,769 --> 09:12:29,769
Come on.

2775
09:12:29,769 --> 09:12:37,220
Open up.

2776
09:12:37,220 --> 09:12:38,220
Open up.

2777
09:12:38,220 --> 09:12:39,580
This is the perfect weapon for this.

2778
09:12:42,269 --> 09:12:44,150
Shit.

2779
09:12:44,150 --> 09:12:45,150
What's firing at me from over here?

2780
09:12:46,779 --> 09:12:47,779
I don't have time for that.

2781
09:12:47,779 --> 09:12:50,680
Clear out the trash.

2782
09:12:50,680 --> 09:12:51,680
I have to.

2783
09:12:51,680 --> 09:12:53,680
I'm going to get dumped on.

2784
09:12:59,949 --> 09:13:00,949
It's you.

2785
09:13:00,949 --> 09:13:07,680
All right.

2786
09:13:07,680 --> 09:13:08,680
All right.

2787
09:13:08,680 --> 09:13:10,879
Get rid of this tank.

2788
09:13:10,879 --> 09:13:11,879
Enough.

2789
09:13:11,879 --> 09:13:14,339
Right side.

2790
09:13:14,339 --> 09:13:15,339
Done.

2791
09:13:22,830 --> 09:13:23,830
That's it?

2792
09:13:23,830 --> 09:13:24,830
Is there one more?

2793
09:13:24,830 --> 09:13:25,830
Where is it?

2794
09:13:25,830 --> 09:13:26,830
On the top?

2795
09:13:34,540 --> 09:13:37,500
It's up top.

2796
09:13:37,500 --> 09:13:39,059
Go too crazy.

2797
09:13:39,059 --> 09:13:40,059
Wait for the next one to open.

2798
09:13:41,059 --> 09:13:42,239
Do not.

2799
09:13:42,239 --> 09:13:43,239
Okay.

2800
09:13:43,239 --> 09:13:44,239
The White House is going to hurt.

2801
09:13:44,239 --> 09:13:58,089
Come.

2802
09:14:18,849 --> 09:14:19,849
I did it.

2803
09:14:19,849 --> 09:14:30,879
I beat the game.

2804
09:14:30,879 --> 09:14:31,879
Got my pods upgraded.

2805
09:14:31,879 --> 09:14:38,269
The White House was back in the hands of the American people that long last the United States had won back its freedom.

2806
09:14:38,269 --> 09:14:41,269
However, the mastermind of its misery remained at large.

2807
09:14:41,269 --> 09:14:46,269
The stage had been set for a final clash to determine whose version of justice the history books would honor.

2808
09:14:46,269 --> 09:14:52,269
The dice were about to be rolled one last time for America and it wasn't clear whose side Lady Luck was going to be on.

2809
09:14:55,019 --> 09:14:56,019
Ladies and gentlemen.

2810
09:14:56,019 --> 09:14:57,019
Yes.

2811
09:14:57,019 --> 09:14:58,019
Lady Luck.

2812
09:14:58,019 --> 09:14:59,019
My treasured has disappeared.

2813
09:14:59,019 --> 09:15:00,019
Showdown.

2814
09:15:00,019 --> 09:15:03,669
The special intelligence.

2815
09:15:03,669 --> 09:15:04,669
Wolf.

2816
09:15:04,669 --> 09:15:07,260
In Las Vegas.

2817
09:15:07,260 --> 09:15:10,330
The vice president is in Las Vegas.

2818
09:15:10,330 --> 09:15:11,330
Let's go.

2819
09:15:11,330 --> 09:15:12,330
Really?

2820
09:15:12,330 --> 09:15:14,330
Nobody rivals our intelligence gathering abilities.

2821
09:15:14,330 --> 09:15:18,300
Head for Las Vegas with me.

2822
09:15:18,300 --> 09:15:20,300
Well, not just me.

2823
09:15:20,300 --> 09:15:24,300
Everyone in the resistance will be rivaling support around the country.

2824
09:15:24,300 --> 09:15:25,300
I know.

2825
09:15:25,300 --> 09:15:26,300
Thanks.

2826
09:15:26,300 --> 09:15:27,300
Mr. President.

2827
09:15:27,300 --> 09:15:28,300
Good luck.

2828
09:15:28,300 --> 09:15:29,300
And Godspeed.

2829
09:15:29,300 --> 09:15:30,300
Jody.

2830
09:15:30,300 --> 09:15:31,300
Prepare Air Force One.

2831
09:15:31,300 --> 09:15:32,300
We're heading.

2832
09:15:32,300 --> 09:15:33,300
Yes, Mr. President.

2833
09:15:33,300 --> 09:15:34,300
Let's go.

2834
09:15:34,300 --> 09:15:39,800
The vice president, Rich.

2835
09:15:39,800 --> 09:15:41,800
My only advice to you is this.

2836
09:15:41,800 --> 09:15:44,800
Beat him to a pulp.

2837
09:15:44,800 --> 09:15:46,800
This mission goes by the call name.

2838
09:15:46,800 --> 09:15:49,489
Good luck and Godspeed, Mr. President.

2839
09:15:49,489 --> 09:15:50,489
That's the name.

2840
09:15:50,489 --> 09:15:51,489
Did I skip it?

2841
09:15:51,489 --> 09:15:52,489
No, I didn't.

2842
09:15:52,489 --> 09:15:54,879
Did I skip it?

2843
09:15:59,000 --> 09:16:10,220
Okay.

2844
09:16:10,220 --> 09:16:12,459
I need to buy something here.

2845
09:16:12,459 --> 09:16:13,459
Missile.

2846
09:16:13,459 --> 09:16:15,730
No, no, no, no.

2847
09:16:15,730 --> 09:16:16,730
What was it?

2848
09:16:16,730 --> 09:16:17,730
What was I going to do?

2849
09:16:17,730 --> 09:16:21,760
This is going to be just like on rails or something.

2850
09:16:21,760 --> 09:16:24,830
It's not going to be hard.

2851
09:16:24,830 --> 09:16:25,830
The Gatling gun.

2852
09:16:25,830 --> 09:16:26,830
Right.

2853
09:16:26,830 --> 09:16:27,830
That was right.

2854
09:16:27,830 --> 09:16:28,830
That was right.

2855
09:16:28,830 --> 09:16:29,830
That was right.

2856
09:16:29,830 --> 09:16:30,830
That was right.

2857
09:16:30,830 --> 09:16:36,300
Okay.

2858
09:16:36,300 --> 09:16:38,300
How much is this?

2859
09:16:38,300 --> 09:16:41,250
Gatling gun has been acquired.

2860
09:16:41,250 --> 09:16:46,300
Also, where's the next one?

2861
09:16:46,300 --> 09:16:48,300
I got the best bazooka, right?

2862
09:16:48,300 --> 09:16:49,300
I already got it.

2863
09:16:49,300 --> 09:16:50,300
Missile launcher.

2864
09:16:50,300 --> 09:16:52,610
This is the best missile launcher in the game.

2865
09:16:52,610 --> 09:16:53,980
I'll take it.

2866
09:16:53,980 --> 09:16:55,980
Put it on.

2867
09:16:55,980 --> 09:17:05,860
Okay.

2868
09:17:05,860 --> 09:17:06,860
That's that.

2869
09:17:06,860 --> 09:17:07,860
I'm going to put the other side.

2870
09:17:07,860 --> 09:17:10,169
It's going to be this thing.

2871
09:17:10,169 --> 09:17:11,169
This crazy thing.

2872
09:17:11,169 --> 09:17:14,169
So this is the big one here.

2873
09:17:14,169 --> 09:17:15,169
Okay.

2874
09:17:15,169 --> 09:17:17,169
Next is going to be.

2875
09:17:17,169 --> 09:17:18,169
I'm thinking.

2876
09:17:18,169 --> 09:17:22,940
Let's put the Gatling gun here.

2877
09:17:22,940 --> 09:17:25,120
32 Gatling guns.

2878
09:17:25,120 --> 09:17:26,120
I don't have enough.

2879
09:17:26,120 --> 09:17:41,900
Should be another machine gun then, shouldn't it?

2880
09:17:41,900 --> 09:17:46,089
Let's try with this.

2881
09:17:46,089 --> 09:17:47,089
I got all.

2882
09:17:47,089 --> 09:17:48,089
I got really good stuff.

2883
09:17:48,089 --> 09:17:49,089
Let's go.

2884
09:17:49,089 --> 09:17:50,330
Final mission.

2885
09:17:50,330 --> 09:17:51,760
Final mission of the game.

2886
09:17:51,760 --> 09:17:52,760
Let's go.

2887
09:17:52,760 --> 09:17:53,760
Richard, come on.

2888
09:17:53,760 --> 09:17:54,760
Oh, Michael.

2889
09:17:54,760 --> 09:17:59,650
You're so sweet.

2890
09:17:59,650 --> 09:18:04,410
Richard.

2891
09:18:04,410 --> 09:18:06,540
And for that, I owe you.

2892
09:18:06,540 --> 09:18:07,540
You canceled all my dreams and plans.

2893
09:18:07,540 --> 09:18:08,540
So now I've got a nice little present for you.

2894
09:18:08,540 --> 09:18:09,540
Here.

2895
09:18:09,540 --> 09:18:10,540
Do I have to.

2896
09:18:10,540 --> 09:18:11,720
Wait.

2897
09:18:11,720 --> 09:18:12,720
It's a gauntlet.

2898
09:18:12,720 --> 09:18:13,720
It's a gauntlet.

2899
09:18:13,720 --> 09:18:14,720
It's a gauntlet.

2900
09:18:14,720 --> 09:18:15,720
It's a gauntlet.

2901
09:18:15,720 --> 09:18:16,720
It's a gauntlet.

2902
09:18:16,720 --> 09:18:17,720
It's a gauntlet.

2903
09:18:17,720 --> 09:18:18,720
It's a gauntlet.

2904
09:18:18,720 --> 09:18:19,720
It's a gauntlet.

2905
09:18:19,720 --> 09:18:20,720
It's a gauntlet.

2906
09:18:20,720 --> 09:18:21,720
It's a gauntlet.

2907
09:18:22,720 --> 09:18:23,720
Here.

2908
09:18:23,720 --> 09:18:28,349
Do I have to.

2909
09:18:28,349 --> 09:18:29,349
Wait.

2910
09:18:29,349 --> 09:18:30,349
It's a gauntlet.

2911
09:18:30,349 --> 09:18:31,349
Let me ask you one last thing.

2912
09:18:31,349 --> 09:18:34,349
What do you want on your tombstone?

2913
09:18:34,349 --> 09:18:37,349
What do you want it to say, huh, Michael?

2914
09:18:37,349 --> 09:18:41,129
I think this is a block.

2915
09:18:41,129 --> 09:18:42,129
Oh, no.

2916
09:18:42,129 --> 09:18:43,129
Oh, please.

2917
09:18:43,129 --> 09:18:55,779
What do you want on your tombstone?

2918
09:18:55,779 --> 09:18:56,779
Hmm.

2919
09:18:56,779 --> 09:19:01,940
I can't catch that briefcase.

2920
09:19:01,940 --> 09:19:04,300
I killed him too fast.

2921
09:19:04,300 --> 09:19:06,300
I can't get the.

2922
09:19:06,300 --> 09:19:23,480
I hope that's not a valuable item.

2923
09:19:23,480 --> 09:19:24,480
Lovely footwork.

2924
09:19:24,480 --> 09:19:25,720
Richard.

2925
09:19:25,720 --> 09:19:26,720
Oh, it was a dummy.

2926
09:19:26,720 --> 09:19:28,720
Now try dancing with me.

2927
09:19:28,720 --> 09:19:37,400
This show's gonna run all night.

2928
09:19:37,400 --> 09:19:38,400
Richard.

2929
09:19:38,400 --> 09:19:45,629
Please, not all night.

2930
09:19:45,629 --> 09:19:47,629
Please, not all night.

2931
09:19:47,629 --> 09:19:50,190
It already has.

2932
09:19:50,190 --> 09:19:53,739
Where is he?

2933
09:19:53,739 --> 09:20:02,250
Is he just flying around?

2934
09:20:02,250 --> 09:20:14,239
Oh, my goodness.

2935
09:20:14,239 --> 09:20:15,239
Just hold on.

2936
09:20:15,239 --> 09:20:16,239
Wait a minute.

2937
09:20:16,239 --> 09:20:20,080
I got locked up here tonight, I think.

2938
09:20:20,080 --> 09:20:26,059
Where is he?

2939
09:20:26,059 --> 09:20:37,660
Almost caught.

2940
09:20:37,660 --> 09:20:38,660
Gatling gun.

2941
09:20:38,660 --> 09:20:39,970
Let's go.

2942
09:20:39,970 --> 09:20:52,040
I don't think I hit him one time.

2943
09:20:52,040 --> 09:21:37,160
I gotta get close.

2944
09:21:37,160 --> 09:22:08,720
That didn't hurt him.

2945
09:22:08,720 --> 09:22:09,720
He's bad.

2946
09:22:09,720 --> 09:22:10,720
Stop.

2947
09:22:10,720 --> 09:22:11,720
I'm fine.

2948
09:22:11,720 --> 09:22:16,419
Sweet.

2949
09:22:16,419 --> 09:22:17,419
Sweet.

2950
09:22:17,419 --> 09:22:21,550
You are so sweet, Michael.

2951
09:22:21,550 --> 09:22:24,550
Like gulping a cup of condensed milk.

2952
09:22:24,550 --> 09:22:26,550
What is going on now?

2953
09:22:26,550 --> 09:22:30,839
Think you can kill me, huh?

2954
09:22:30,839 --> 09:22:31,839
Sweet.

2955
09:22:31,839 --> 09:22:32,839
Sweet.

2956
09:22:32,839 --> 09:22:34,839
All right, let's take it outside.

2957
09:22:34,839 --> 09:22:38,550
I'm gonna keep the Gatling gun on.

2958
09:22:38,550 --> 09:22:39,550
This is fine.

2959
09:22:39,550 --> 09:22:47,480
I thought you guys were lying to me when the last level was Vegas.

2960
09:22:47,480 --> 09:22:49,480
That's so funny.

2961
09:22:49,480 --> 09:22:52,480
I did not think that that was gonna be...

2962
09:22:52,480 --> 09:22:56,300
Where'd he go from here?

2963
09:22:56,300 --> 09:23:03,940
Did he go inside?

2964
09:23:03,940 --> 09:23:11,860
This is not an epic fight anymore.

2965
09:23:11,860 --> 09:23:15,529
Oh, wait.

2966
09:23:17,150 --> 09:23:25,639
...were among the POWs you rescued.

2967
09:23:25,639 --> 09:23:31,269
Further in?

2968
09:23:31,269 --> 09:23:44,199
I need him to, like, clap his hands.

2969
09:23:44,199 --> 09:23:45,199
I am.

2970
09:23:45,199 --> 09:23:52,800
Good challenge.

2971
09:23:52,800 --> 09:23:53,800
He went out that way.

2972
09:23:53,800 --> 09:24:11,269
Okay, good.

2973
09:24:11,269 --> 09:24:13,699
He's out here.

2974
09:24:13,699 --> 09:24:17,199
Richard, you can run, but you can't hide.

2975
09:24:17,199 --> 09:24:25,900
Catch your dream.

2976
09:24:25,900 --> 09:24:26,900
Banana.

2977
09:24:26,900 --> 09:24:30,860
You gonna complain?

2978
09:24:30,860 --> 09:24:31,860
He's a coward.

2979
09:24:31,860 --> 09:24:33,860
I can't win.

2980
09:24:33,860 --> 09:24:34,860
So shoot me, Michael.

2981
09:24:34,860 --> 09:24:35,860
Who's mocking who?

2982
09:24:35,860 --> 09:24:37,860
Or are you a chicken?

2983
09:24:40,860 --> 09:24:42,860
Knock that jerk off the roof.

2984
09:24:42,860 --> 09:24:45,860
Show him who will have the last laugh.

2985
09:24:45,860 --> 09:24:48,860
Knock that jerk off the roof.

2986
09:24:48,860 --> 09:24:52,739
He's a jerk.

2987
09:24:52,739 --> 09:25:00,260
Hit him.

2988
09:25:00,260 --> 09:25:01,260
Did I get him?

2989
09:25:01,260 --> 09:25:06,360
I didn't get him.

2990
09:25:06,360 --> 09:25:07,360
There it is.

2991
09:25:07,360 --> 09:25:11,519
You break it, you bought it, Michael.

2992
09:25:11,519 --> 09:25:15,519
Michael, you'll pay for the damages with your life.

2993
09:25:15,519 --> 09:25:29,139
Out of ammo.

2994
09:25:29,139 --> 09:25:31,139
I can't get off of this.

2995
09:25:31,139 --> 09:25:35,459
Killing you is easier than breaking a baby's arm.

2996
09:25:35,459 --> 09:25:36,459
Holy shit.

2997
09:25:36,459 --> 09:25:43,440
What the hell did he just say?

2998
09:25:43,440 --> 09:25:44,440
Jesus.

2999
09:25:44,440 --> 09:26:01,449
Phase three.

3000
09:26:01,449 --> 09:26:09,809
Shall I take you to the next stage?

3001
09:26:09,809 --> 09:26:11,750
Yeah.

3002
09:26:11,750 --> 09:26:12,750
He's on the move again.

3003
09:26:12,750 --> 09:26:15,750
I do need ammo.

3004
09:26:15,750 --> 09:26:17,750
I wonder if I can get it from anything in here.

3005
09:26:17,750 --> 09:26:21,849
Offensive augment.

3006
09:26:21,849 --> 09:26:22,849
I'm going to take my time here.

3007
09:26:22,849 --> 09:26:24,849
I won't go in like a dumpster.

3008
09:26:24,849 --> 09:26:30,459
Go boxes with his heavy weapons.

3009
09:26:30,459 --> 09:26:32,720
In the arms.

3010
09:26:32,720 --> 09:26:33,720
Good.

3011
09:26:33,720 --> 09:26:36,959
Not any Gatling gun ammo, though.

3012
09:26:36,959 --> 09:26:38,959
That's a real bummer.

3013
09:26:38,959 --> 09:26:47,980
There are crates behind me.

3014
09:26:47,980 --> 09:26:48,980
Oh, fuck.

3015
09:26:48,980 --> 09:26:56,769
All the way down.

3016
09:26:56,769 --> 09:27:00,699
How did I miss that?

3017
09:27:00,699 --> 09:27:06,379
Because I was scrolling through to see what ammo that was.

3018
09:27:06,379 --> 09:27:11,949
Actually, that's worth it.

3019
09:27:11,949 --> 09:27:13,949
The vice president moved behind the passageway.

3020
09:27:13,949 --> 09:27:16,949
Mr. President, chase after him.

3021
09:27:16,949 --> 09:27:18,949
I know.

3022
09:27:18,949 --> 09:27:29,699
Light arms.

3023
09:27:29,699 --> 09:27:30,699
All right.

3024
09:27:30,699 --> 09:27:35,080
Heavy arms.

3025
09:27:35,080 --> 09:27:38,730
Shield unit.

3026
09:27:38,730 --> 09:27:41,739
Is he going to cut me off?

3027
09:27:41,739 --> 09:27:45,599
How lovely.

3028
09:27:45,599 --> 09:27:57,239
Doesn't knowing that it all ends here kind of get your adrenaline going?

3029
09:27:57,239 --> 09:27:59,239
I wonder those crates.

3030
09:27:59,239 --> 09:28:04,089
Richard.

3031
09:28:04,089 --> 09:28:11,830
Michael.

3032
09:28:11,830 --> 09:28:13,830
At the stage all to ourselves.

3033
09:28:13,830 --> 09:28:14,830
Uh-oh, it's final destination.

3034
09:28:14,830 --> 09:28:15,830
No weapons?

3035
09:28:15,830 --> 09:28:19,830
It ends here.

3036
09:28:19,830 --> 09:28:29,120
I don't know where to go.

3037
09:28:29,120 --> 09:28:31,120
I thought I was going to fall off here and die.

3038
09:28:31,120 --> 09:28:55,440
Like Virtua Fighter style.

3039
09:28:55,440 --> 09:29:02,989
Get it.

3040
09:29:02,989 --> 09:29:14,940
Oh.

3041
09:29:14,940 --> 09:29:15,940
Cracking.

3042
09:29:15,940 --> 09:29:16,940
I'm starting to crack.

3043
09:29:16,940 --> 09:29:17,940
I got to hold on.

3044
09:29:17,940 --> 09:29:21,529
I'm cracking.

3045
09:29:21,529 --> 09:29:31,470
Take it and dodge and take it to your grave.

3046
09:29:31,470 --> 09:29:33,470
He's doing his, like, super move.

3047
09:29:33,470 --> 09:30:05,839
Thank you, Mr. President.

3048
09:30:06,839 --> 09:30:11,959
It's not over.

3049
09:30:11,959 --> 09:30:12,959
This is, like, phase five.

3050
09:30:12,959 --> 09:30:14,959
Like hell it is.

3051
09:30:14,959 --> 09:30:28,980
I have to fight this space shuttle?

3052
09:30:28,980 --> 09:30:31,540
Oh, my God.

3053
09:30:31,540 --> 09:30:35,309
Space station?

3054
09:30:35,309 --> 09:30:36,809
Mr. President?

3055
09:30:36,809 --> 09:30:39,180
The scene is pointless.

3056
09:30:39,180 --> 09:30:45,480
The reason is because I'm the president of the great United States of America.

3057
09:30:45,480 --> 09:30:47,870
Yeah!

3058
09:30:47,870 --> 09:30:49,430
Mr. President?

3059
09:30:49,430 --> 09:30:52,430
Jodie, I'm going to step out into outer space.

3060
09:30:52,430 --> 09:30:54,430
See you soon!

3061
09:30:54,430 --> 09:31:03,800
Let's do this again.

3062
09:31:03,800 --> 09:31:11,559
E-E-A-S-E-A.

3063
09:31:11,559 --> 09:31:23,459
Gold to play on Vegas.

3064
09:31:23,459 --> 09:31:28,790
Given over 10 years of my life to this profession and no scene has ever engraved itself upon my mind the way this one did.

3065
09:31:28,790 --> 09:31:30,790
Two men, two ideals, one outcome.

3066
09:31:30,790 --> 09:31:34,790
I cannot imagine where we would all stand now that things have gone the other way.

3067
09:31:34,790 --> 09:31:36,790
President, are you all right?

3068
09:31:36,790 --> 09:31:38,480
Yes.

3069
09:31:38,480 --> 09:31:42,480
I've been very pleased about my first flight in space.

3070
09:31:42,480 --> 09:31:47,040
But I just wish I had brought my camera.

3071
09:31:47,040 --> 09:31:51,279
Mr. President, be sure and come back now.

3072
09:31:51,279 --> 09:31:53,279
The American people are waiting for you.

3073
09:31:53,279 --> 09:31:57,279
She says Mr. President as much as I say, oh, my God.

3074
09:31:57,279 --> 09:32:02,279
I am the president of the United States of America.

3075
09:32:02,279 --> 09:32:06,169
Be back.

3076
09:32:06,169 --> 09:32:07,169
Mr. President?

3077
09:32:07,169 --> 09:32:10,169
Please continue to update me as the battle goes on.

3078
09:32:10,169 --> 09:32:11,169
Sure.

3079
09:32:11,169 --> 09:32:14,169
Oh, and contact the Japanese embassy.

3080
09:32:14,169 --> 09:32:17,169
Tell them we can hold that wildlife protection conference.

3081
09:32:17,169 --> 09:32:19,169
He's not in space anymore?

3082
09:32:19,169 --> 09:32:21,169
Wait, did he take the helmet off?

3083
09:32:21,169 --> 09:32:23,169
He took the helmet off.

3084
09:32:23,169 --> 09:32:25,169
Mr. President, don't take off the helmet!

3085
09:32:25,169 --> 09:32:27,169
What are you trying to do?

3086
09:32:27,169 --> 09:32:39,959
In sinister nature, I predict he has some unexpected trump card up his sleeve.

3087
09:32:39,959 --> 09:32:44,970
But Mr. President, be victorious at all costs.

3088
09:32:44,970 --> 09:32:50,589
The reason is because you're the president of this great land.

3089
09:32:50,589 --> 09:32:52,589
This mission goes by the call name...

3090
09:32:52,589 --> 09:32:54,589
To the moon.

3091
09:32:54,589 --> 09:32:58,480
Believe in justice.

3092
09:32:58,480 --> 09:33:05,199
Best of luck, and Godspeed, Mr. President.

3093
09:33:05,199 --> 09:33:06,199
All right.

3094
09:33:06,199 --> 09:33:10,629
What am I missing that I can invest in?

3095
09:33:10,629 --> 09:33:12,629
I like what I got now.

3096
09:33:12,629 --> 09:33:15,629
Assault weapons, right? Assault rifles.

3097
09:33:15,629 --> 09:33:18,319
I'm going to get the best assault rifle, like, in the world.

3098
09:33:18,319 --> 09:33:20,319
The RFRH.

3099
09:33:20,319 --> 09:33:32,330
Assault, where is it? Assault, assault, assault, assault.

3100
09:33:32,330 --> 09:33:34,330
Assault weapons, there we go.

3101
09:33:34,330 --> 09:33:38,019
What is it?

3102
09:33:38,019 --> 09:33:40,019
The RFRH.

3103
09:33:40,019 --> 09:33:53,589
I do want...

3104
09:33:53,589 --> 09:33:55,589
If I can get it, I want two of these.

3105
09:33:55,589 --> 09:34:08,260
I can't get it.

3106
09:34:08,260 --> 09:34:29,620
Well, I got the Gatling gun, and then I'm going to put the assault rifle, that RFRH, here to get double, triple firepower.

3107
09:34:29,620 --> 09:34:32,309
Give it a flamethrower.

3108
09:34:32,309 --> 09:34:35,699
Check out the handguns.

3109
09:34:35,699 --> 09:34:38,580
Maybe. I'll check them out.

3110
09:34:38,580 --> 09:34:45,559
Handguns.

3111
09:34:45,559 --> 09:34:47,559
Might as well do it, all right?

3112
09:34:47,559 --> 09:34:53,879
29.

3113
09:34:53,879 --> 09:34:56,760
9PA.

3114
09:34:56,760 --> 09:34:59,510
DE91.

3115
09:34:59,510 --> 09:35:01,510
DE91EN.

3116
09:35:01,510 --> 09:35:04,199
DE91PA.

3117
09:35:04,199 --> 09:35:07,529
M45.

3118
09:35:07,529 --> 09:35:13,160
Don't have enough money.

3119
09:35:13,160 --> 09:35:15,160
I don't think I can even make it.

3120
09:35:15,160 --> 09:35:17,160
Am I still going to stream tomorrow? Yeah.

3121
09:35:17,160 --> 09:35:20,489
I'm just not going to stream at, like, 12.

3122
09:35:20,489 --> 09:35:22,489
I'll stream at, like, 4.

3123
09:35:22,489 --> 09:35:24,919
I'll be all right.

3124
09:35:24,919 --> 09:35:27,919
I'm not going to do a 10 or 11 hour stream. I don't understand how these happen. They just do.

3125
09:35:27,919 --> 09:35:34,849
Yeah, I mean, today, it's almost been, I can't believe it's almost been 11 hours.

3126
09:35:34,849 --> 09:35:38,180
What the hell am I doing?

3127
09:35:38,180 --> 09:35:46,180
All right, I'm going to try it with this, but I'm going to take off the trash here, which is, like, absolute trash.

3128
09:35:46,180 --> 09:35:55,760
Put on Sam.

3129
09:35:55,760 --> 09:35:57,760
Actually, no, put this on. I feel like I could get use out of that.

3130
09:35:57,760 --> 09:36:01,220
Yeah, this looks all right.

3131
09:36:01,220 --> 09:36:05,569
Let's give it a go.

3132
09:36:05,569 --> 09:36:14,669
I know, you even commented earlier on keeping Eastern viewers up until, like, 3.

3133
09:36:14,669 --> 09:36:16,669
I know.

3134
09:36:16,669 --> 09:36:18,980
Final mission, here we go.

3135
09:36:18,980 --> 09:36:24,019
Richard!

3136
09:36:24,019 --> 09:36:26,019
Chasing 15 million feet after me.

3137
09:36:26,019 --> 09:36:28,019
Now that's love.

3138
09:36:28,019 --> 09:36:32,019
Well, I love you too, Michael.

3139
09:36:32,019 --> 09:36:38,019
I love you so much, I can't stand it.

3140
09:36:38,019 --> 09:36:42,019
So much, I want to kill you.

3141
09:36:42,019 --> 09:36:49,180
Hold it, Richard!

3142
09:36:49,180 --> 09:37:01,230
Take a long-ass look at the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way.

3143
09:37:01,230 --> 09:37:09,230
Of all man's achievements in the 21st century, this is the climax!

3144
09:37:09,230 --> 09:37:13,230
It's a big cannon. Two big cannons.

3145
09:37:13,230 --> 09:37:15,230
I only have 300 seconds to beat this.

3146
09:37:15,230 --> 09:37:17,230
I don't even know where to start.

3147
09:37:17,230 --> 09:37:25,300
Mr. President, the barrier is shut.

3148
09:37:25,300 --> 09:37:29,660
You won't be able to advance if you don't destroy it.

3149
09:37:29,660 --> 09:37:41,300
Let's go!

3150
09:37:41,300 --> 09:37:51,919
Almost out of time!

3151
09:37:51,919 --> 09:37:55,120
I'm at 11 hours, man.

3152
09:37:55,120 --> 09:37:57,120
Give me a break.

3153
09:37:57,120 --> 09:37:59,120
Give me a little slack.

3154
09:37:59,120 --> 09:38:35,069
I think so.

3155
09:38:35,069 --> 09:38:39,069
Mr. President, do you think you can just run away?

3156
09:38:39,069 --> 09:38:49,819
Mr. President!

3157
09:38:49,819 --> 09:39:10,830
I need to lead a little bit of strength.

3158
09:39:10,830 --> 09:39:31,489
Full of energy.

3159
09:39:31,489 --> 09:39:33,489
I'm not playing the game right now.

3160
09:39:33,489 --> 09:39:37,709
I'm going to check in as well.

3161
09:39:37,709 --> 09:39:47,059
Just kidding, it's me.

3162
09:39:47,059 --> 09:40:05,940
What am I supposed to be doing?

3163
09:40:05,940 --> 09:40:19,309
Up, up, up, up!

3164
09:40:19,309 --> 09:40:26,980
Shit!

3165
09:40:26,980 --> 09:40:30,110
I can't destroy the ladder.

3166
09:40:30,110 --> 09:40:40,220
Alright, let's go!

3167
09:40:40,220 --> 09:40:59,230
You guys all going up there too?

3168
09:40:59,230 --> 09:41:03,629
Cool.

3169
09:41:03,629 --> 09:41:26,930
You know Richard.

3170
09:42:21,139 --> 09:42:29,199
What's going on?

3171
09:42:29,199 --> 09:42:52,220
I'm fine.

3172
09:42:52,220 --> 09:42:58,290
I'm fucking...

3173
09:42:58,290 --> 09:43:12,300
God, how do I get out of here?

3174
09:43:12,300 --> 09:43:17,680
Okay.

3175
09:43:17,680 --> 09:43:25,730
Oh my God.

3176
09:43:25,730 --> 09:43:29,379
Yeah, I'm fine.

3177
09:43:29,379 --> 09:43:33,599
I'm just fucking laughing really hard.

3178
09:43:33,599 --> 09:43:47,309
Sometimes I look over here, man, and I fucking see something so stupid, so funny.

3179
09:43:47,309 --> 09:43:49,309
You guys kill me sometimes.

3180
09:43:49,309 --> 09:43:51,309
Richard!

3181
09:43:51,309 --> 09:43:58,290
What do you stand for, Michael?

3182
09:43:58,290 --> 09:44:00,290
Be certain now.

3183
09:44:00,290 --> 09:44:02,529
As certain as the blood gushing out of your mouth.

3184
09:44:02,529 --> 09:44:06,529
As certain as the blood gushing out of your mouth when I bash it in.

3185
09:44:06,529 --> 09:44:10,529
Be certain of your death here and now.

3186
09:44:10,529 --> 09:44:12,529
Okay, I'm good.

3187
09:44:12,529 --> 09:44:16,180
Now I have to fight this thing.

3188
09:44:16,180 --> 09:44:21,699
Now, come at me with all your body and soul.

3189
09:44:21,699 --> 09:44:24,510
I'll hug you to death.

3190
09:44:24,510 --> 09:44:26,879
Okay.

3191
09:44:26,879 --> 09:44:30,879
Mr. President, the fuselage damage rate is above 50%.

3192
09:44:30,879 --> 09:44:32,879
Jesus, come on.

3193
09:44:32,879 --> 09:44:34,879
I have so much of this shit.

3194
09:44:34,879 --> 09:44:50,300
You didn't break any of them.

3195
09:44:50,300 --> 09:44:57,709
Dude, no, he does.

3196
09:44:57,709 --> 09:45:08,400
But I have the super thing.

3197
09:45:08,400 --> 09:45:24,080
I see health over there.

3198
09:45:24,080 --> 09:45:26,580
There's health over here.

3199
09:45:26,580 --> 09:45:34,110
Oh, fuck.

3200
09:45:34,110 --> 09:45:36,800
There's a health over there.

3201
09:45:36,800 --> 09:45:39,680
I'm going to get it.

3202
09:45:39,680 --> 09:45:42,110
He's standing now in this tiny arena.

3203
09:45:42,110 --> 09:45:44,110
Oh, God damn it.

3204
09:45:46,110 --> 09:45:49,300
I have this health to my left or right.

3205
09:45:49,300 --> 09:45:51,300
Left, I think.

3206
09:45:51,300 --> 09:46:01,919
It even matters.

3207
09:46:04,309 --> 09:46:10,970
Like, impossible.

3208
09:46:10,970 --> 09:46:12,970
Literally not even possible.

3209
09:46:23,959 --> 09:46:25,959
It's scripted, it's scripted.

3210
09:46:27,959 --> 09:46:29,959
It's scripted, it's scripted.

3211
09:46:29,959 --> 09:46:32,389
I win.

3212
09:46:33,389 --> 09:46:37,760
Way to go, Mr. President.

3213
09:46:37,760 --> 09:46:43,309
That is like unbearable.

3214
09:46:43,309 --> 09:46:45,309
That fight is fucking unbearable.

3215
09:46:45,309 --> 09:46:47,739
It's just like obnoxious.

3216
09:46:47,739 --> 09:46:48,739
Like, what the fuck?

3217
09:46:48,739 --> 09:47:02,550
You gotta give me a break.

3218
09:47:02,550 --> 09:47:04,550
That's just dumb.

3219
09:47:04,550 --> 09:47:15,500
What a dumb fucking fight.

3220
09:47:15,500 --> 09:47:17,500
Spam daddy a little bit.

3221
09:47:17,500 --> 09:47:20,180
Just spam.

3222
09:47:20,180 --> 09:48:15,589
I'm stuck the whole thing.

3223
09:48:15,589 --> 09:48:17,589
It's like a musician's face.

3224
09:48:17,589 --> 09:48:39,290
What's the strategy with this guy?

3225
09:48:39,290 --> 09:48:46,339
You just hold spray and you don't get hit by a random bullet?

3226
09:48:46,339 --> 09:49:23,139
What is that noise?

3227
09:49:23,139 --> 09:49:26,139
I'm beyond the point of my return here.

3228
09:49:26,139 --> 09:49:48,059
Here we go.

3229
09:49:48,059 --> 09:49:59,769
I'm saving my super for the big fight.

3230
09:49:59,769 --> 09:50:09,239
The real one.

3231
09:50:09,239 --> 09:50:11,239
A speed upgrade or something.

3232
09:50:11,239 --> 09:50:13,239
I feel like I'm so much slower than these things.

3233
09:50:13,239 --> 09:50:17,239
You know what? I gotta get a thing that destroys all incoming projectiles.

3234
09:50:21,080 --> 09:50:24,860
Actually, I can't fucking believe it.

3235
09:50:24,860 --> 09:50:27,220
I'm desperate.

3236
09:50:27,220 --> 09:50:28,220
But I'm still firing.

3237
09:50:28,220 --> 09:50:30,220
I think I'm firing still.

3238
09:50:35,040 --> 09:50:37,040
What a joke.

3239
09:50:37,040 --> 09:50:41,040
What the fuck was that?

3240
09:50:46,180 --> 09:50:48,180
What?

3241
09:50:48,180 --> 09:50:50,180
I have to get the thing that destroys...

3242
09:50:55,500 --> 09:50:59,790
This is not even a video game.

3243
09:50:59,790 --> 09:51:01,790
This isn't a video game.

3244
09:51:01,790 --> 09:51:04,800
I'm just coming to that realization right now.

3245
09:51:04,800 --> 09:51:26,239
This is not even a game.

3246
09:51:26,239 --> 09:51:38,290
I need one of those laser beams that destroy all projectiles.

3247
09:51:38,290 --> 09:51:40,290
This fucking game.

3248
09:51:40,290 --> 09:51:42,589
It's like...

3249
09:51:42,589 --> 09:51:44,769
Why?

3250
09:51:44,769 --> 09:51:49,699
Why?

3251
09:51:49,699 --> 09:51:51,699
Ben Boss is just...

3252
09:51:51,699 --> 09:51:53,699
I'm not allowed to say it.

3253
09:51:53,699 --> 09:51:57,279
Am I allowed to say it?

3254
09:51:57,279 --> 09:51:59,279
Should I say it?

3255
09:51:59,279 --> 09:52:01,279
I think I'm just gonna say it.

3256
09:52:01,279 --> 09:52:10,300
This game sucks.

3257
09:52:10,300 --> 09:52:29,180
Somebody look at the ratings for this game.

3258
09:52:29,180 --> 09:52:31,180
What does it have right now?

3259
09:52:31,180 --> 09:52:37,260
Alright, I need to do...

3260
09:52:37,260 --> 09:52:44,879
Wait, it's a machine gun. Right here it is.

3261
09:52:44,879 --> 09:52:47,059
Intercepting fire.

3262
09:52:47,059 --> 09:52:54,930
I just want like three of these.

3263
09:52:54,930 --> 09:52:56,930
I think that changes everything. I really think it does.

3264
09:52:56,930 --> 09:52:58,930
I think this thing here...

3265
09:52:58,930 --> 09:53:06,029
Should help.

3266
09:53:06,029 --> 09:53:10,699
I'm gonna do this one or two more times.

3267
09:53:10,699 --> 09:53:31,309
Never let the joke die.

3268
09:53:31,309 --> 09:53:42,580
Out of here!

3269
09:53:42,580 --> 09:53:44,580
Oh shit, I forgot about the ceiling.

3270
09:53:44,580 --> 09:53:59,360
I can't look at the link right now.

3271
09:53:59,360 --> 09:54:01,360
I'm busy trying to complete this game.

3272
09:54:01,360 --> 09:54:04,370
It's taking all of my attention.

3273
09:54:04,370 --> 09:54:23,120
Look at the virus.

3274
09:54:23,120 --> 09:54:40,849
Wait, what?

3275
09:54:40,849 --> 09:54:42,849
Oh, right.

3276
09:54:42,849 --> 09:54:46,180
Let's get out the big ones.

3277
09:54:46,180 --> 09:54:49,440
Target, target, target.

3278
09:54:49,440 --> 09:54:53,660
Why is it not locking on?

3279
09:54:53,660 --> 09:54:55,660
No, that's not gonna work.

3280
09:54:55,660 --> 09:55:00,910
Why is it not locking on?

3281
09:55:00,910 --> 09:55:06,419
I'm rolling up.

3282
09:55:06,419 --> 09:55:08,419
So it's on my left side.

3283
09:55:08,419 --> 09:55:11,230
This is gonna be what's necessary.

3284
09:55:11,230 --> 09:55:20,900
I'm gonna skip this part.

3285
09:55:20,900 --> 09:55:24,860
I'm gonna skip this part.

3286
09:55:24,860 --> 09:55:26,860
I'm gonna skip this part.

3287
09:55:26,860 --> 09:55:28,860
I have 167 seconds.

3288
09:55:28,860 --> 09:55:30,860
If I get up here without with 150 seconds remaining.

3289
09:55:30,860 --> 09:55:32,860
Let's start from here.

3290
09:55:35,489 --> 09:55:45,089
I have to play the game.

3291
09:55:45,089 --> 09:55:53,260
Okay, here we go.

3292
09:55:53,260 --> 09:55:55,260
It's time.

3293
09:55:55,260 --> 09:55:57,889
Bring it out, the MP7.

3294
09:55:57,889 --> 09:55:59,889
And then the...

3295
09:55:59,889 --> 09:56:03,730
This thing.

3296
09:56:03,730 --> 09:56:05,730
Let's hope it's enough.

3297
09:56:05,730 --> 09:56:08,160
Will it be enough?

3298
09:56:08,160 --> 09:56:10,160
Only 20 bullets on this thing, keep in mind.

3299
09:56:10,160 --> 09:56:12,160
Will it be enough?

3300
09:56:12,160 --> 09:56:14,589
I'm going. Go.

3301
09:56:14,589 --> 09:56:22,529
It is a little bit better, I think.

3302
09:56:22,529 --> 09:56:24,959
Although this is probably...

3303
09:56:24,959 --> 09:56:47,620
This might just be a placebo effect.

3304
09:56:47,620 --> 09:56:49,620
No, no, it wants back, please.

3305
09:56:49,620 --> 09:56:57,040
I gotta get rid of all the assault rifles.

3306
09:56:57,040 --> 09:56:59,040
I got nothing else, do I?

3307
09:56:59,040 --> 09:57:01,040
In the fucking other hands. Oh, this is bad.

3308
09:57:01,040 --> 09:57:03,040
This is really, really, really bad.

3309
09:57:03,040 --> 09:57:06,500
I need ammo.

3310
09:57:06,500 --> 09:57:25,489
Please. Get out of the corner.

3311
09:57:35,980 --> 09:58:05,230
Here we go.

3312
09:58:05,230 --> 09:58:07,230
There cannot be another phrase.

3313
09:58:29,300 --> 09:58:32,050
Where is he going?

3314
09:58:40,989 --> 09:58:42,989
Did I do it?

3315
09:58:42,989 --> 09:58:56,430
That was easy.

3316
09:58:56,430 --> 09:59:03,139
Was that me or him? I did it.

3317
09:59:21,760 --> 09:59:23,760
Shooting star.

3318
09:59:23,760 --> 09:59:25,760
Jodie, who am I?

3319
09:59:25,760 --> 09:59:27,760
I'm the president.

3320
09:59:27,760 --> 09:59:29,760
I always make

3321
09:59:29,760 --> 09:59:31,760
the impossible possible.

3322
09:59:31,760 --> 09:59:33,760
And I'm gonna keep on doing so.

3323
09:59:35,760 --> 09:59:46,559
Michael.

3324
09:59:46,559 --> 09:59:48,559
Richard, it was your methods

3325
09:59:48,559 --> 09:59:50,559
that were flawed. Our love

3326
09:59:50,559 --> 09:59:52,989
for America won't change.

3327
10:00:03,360 --> 10:00:05,360
Richard!

3328
10:00:05,360 --> 10:00:07,360
You're just gonna kill me!

3329
10:00:35,599 --> 10:00:45,069
This is how I'm sitting.

3330
10:00:47,069 --> 10:00:49,629
I'll show you after.

3331
10:00:49,629 --> 10:00:52,379
This is how I'm sitting.

3332
10:00:52,379 --> 10:00:54,379
Tomorrow's gonna be

3333
10:00:54,379 --> 10:00:56,379
another busy day at the

3334
10:00:56,379 --> 10:00:58,379
White House.

3335
10:00:58,379 --> 10:01:00,379
That was fun.

3336
10:01:00,379 --> 10:01:02,559
This is how I was sitting during the cutscene.

3337
10:01:02,559 --> 10:01:07,550
My fellow Americans,

3338
10:01:07,550 --> 10:01:11,709
good morning.

3339
10:01:11,709 --> 10:01:13,709
As Americans, we love

3340
10:01:13,709 --> 10:01:16,779
freedom. But true

3341
10:01:16,779 --> 10:01:18,779
freedom isn't a given like the air

3342
10:01:18,779 --> 10:01:20,779
we breathe or the water we drink.

3343
10:01:20,779 --> 10:01:24,879
About 240

3344
10:01:24,879 --> 10:01:26,879
years ago,

3345
10:01:26,879 --> 10:01:28,879
our forefathers fought greatly

3346
10:01:28,879 --> 10:01:30,879
giving their blood, sweat

3347
10:01:30,879 --> 10:01:32,879
and tears. And in the

3348
10:01:32,879 --> 10:01:34,879
end, they won our freedom.

3349
10:01:34,879 --> 10:01:37,819
And we must

3350
10:01:37,819 --> 10:01:39,819
never forget this.

3351
10:01:39,819 --> 10:01:42,059
If anything appears

3352
10:01:42,059 --> 10:01:44,430
that threatens

3353
10:01:44,430 --> 10:01:46,430
our belief in this freedom,

3354
10:01:46,430 --> 10:01:48,930
we will oppose

3355
10:01:48,930 --> 10:01:50,930
it. We will crush

3356
10:01:50,930 --> 10:01:55,019
it. In fighting

3357
10:01:55,019 --> 10:01:57,019
to gain our freedom, we

3358
10:01:57,019 --> 10:01:59,019
need no reasons.

3359
10:01:59,019 --> 10:02:02,220
We require

3360
10:02:02,220 --> 10:02:04,220
no just cause or flowery

3361
10:02:04,220 --> 10:02:07,489
words. In order

3362
10:02:07,489 --> 10:02:09,489
to protect our neighbors who love

3363
10:02:09,489 --> 10:02:11,489
freedom and this faith in freedom,

3364
10:02:11,489 --> 10:02:13,919
we continue

3365
10:02:13,919 --> 10:02:15,919
to believe in our own justice.

3366
10:02:15,919 --> 10:02:17,919
We

3367
10:02:17,919 --> 10:02:19,919
won't abandon any battles.

3368
10:02:19,919 --> 10:02:21,919
And the

3369
10:02:21,919 --> 10:02:23,919
reason is

3370
10:02:23,919 --> 10:02:25,919
because we are

3371
10:02:25,919 --> 10:02:27,919
all citizens of the United

3372
10:02:27,919 --> 10:02:29,919
States of America.

3373
10:02:33,919 --> 10:02:35,919
I will be a vanguard

3374
10:02:35,919 --> 10:02:37,919
leading this fight.

3375
10:02:37,919 --> 10:02:40,099
And the reason is

3376
10:02:40,099 --> 10:02:42,099
because

3377
10:02:42,099 --> 10:02:44,099
I'm the president of

3378
10:02:44,099 --> 10:02:46,099
this great United States

3379
10:02:46,099 --> 10:02:48,099
of America.

3380
10:03:22,050 --> 10:03:47,889
Welcome.

3381
10:03:47,889 --> 10:03:54,419
What would you score this game? A 3.

3382
10:03:54,419 --> 10:04:08,430
Out of 5.

3383
10:04:08,430 --> 10:04:11,180
2.5 out of 5.

3384
10:04:11,180 --> 10:04:17,330
I would eat here.

3385
10:04:17,330 --> 10:04:19,819
I would give this 2.5 out of 5.

3386
10:04:19,819 --> 10:04:21,819
The 2.6 out of 5 just because

3387
10:04:21,819 --> 10:04:23,819
of the funny voice acting.

3388
10:04:23,819 --> 10:04:33,680
52 out of 100.

3389
10:04:33,680 --> 10:04:45,839
Hey, I played it, didn't I?

3390
10:04:45,839 --> 10:04:47,839
If I hated it, I wouldn't have done it.

3391
10:04:47,839 --> 10:04:53,069
Now I'll click the link.

3392
10:04:53,069 --> 10:04:55,069
That was Metal Wolf Chaos XD.

3393
10:04:55,069 --> 10:05:06,400
Let's look at this link.

3394
10:05:06,400 --> 10:05:17,089
Oh my god.

3395
10:05:17,089 --> 10:05:31,940
I look like the main character from

3396
10:05:31,940 --> 10:05:41,410
Number Bunchers.

3397
10:05:41,410 --> 10:05:43,900
By the way, that wasn't even from McDonald's.

3398
10:05:43,900 --> 10:05:46,209
That was from Wendy's.

3399
10:05:46,209 --> 10:05:48,379
What a scammer.

3400
10:05:48,379 --> 10:06:00,610
Alright, I'm

3401
10:06:00,610 --> 10:06:05,599
leaving. I'm outta here.

3402
10:06:05,599 --> 10:06:12,319
What about the

3403
10:06:12,319 --> 10:06:14,319
tier lists?

3404
10:06:14,319 --> 10:06:20,400
That was fun. It was.

3405
10:06:20,400 --> 10:06:22,830
For all how bullshit some of the

3406
10:06:22,830 --> 10:06:24,830
stuff was in this game and how over the top it was

3407
10:06:24,830 --> 10:06:26,830
and how weird some of it was.

3408
10:06:26,830 --> 10:06:28,830
I still enjoyed

3409
10:06:28,830 --> 10:06:30,830
myself.

3410
10:06:30,830 --> 10:06:32,830
5.9 out of 10.

3411
10:06:32,830 --> 10:06:34,830
There you go, just barely below 6.

3412
10:06:34,830 --> 10:06:36,830
Almost a passing grade. No, but that's still alright.

3413
10:06:36,830 --> 10:06:50,339
5.9.

3414
10:06:50,339 --> 10:06:52,339
That's alright. That was worth it.

3415
10:06:52,339 --> 10:06:56,239
Some teachers

3416
10:06:56,239 --> 10:06:58,239
actually will pass you if you get a 5.9.

3417
10:06:58,239 --> 10:07:11,940
If you get a 59,

3418
10:07:11,940 --> 10:07:13,940
that's a 5.9, but if you

3419
10:07:13,940 --> 10:07:15,940
nostalgia factor,

3420
10:07:15,940 --> 10:07:17,940
it could probably bump you up to like a 6.5.

3421
10:07:17,940 --> 10:07:24,080
6.4.

3422
10:07:24,080 --> 10:07:26,080
I'm gonna do the bits tomorrow.

3423
10:07:26,080 --> 10:07:28,900
I actually like am dying

3424
10:07:28,900 --> 10:07:30,900
at this scene.

3425
10:07:30,900 --> 10:07:32,900
We'll do the bits tomorrow.

3426
10:07:32,900 --> 10:07:34,900
We'll do a little just hangout session at the end of tomorrow.

3427
10:07:34,900 --> 10:07:37,389
Tomorrow is not going to be

3428
10:07:37,389 --> 10:07:39,389
an 11 hour stream. I can guarantee that.

3429
10:07:39,389 --> 10:07:41,889
I can promise you that.

3430
10:07:41,889 --> 10:07:43,889
So we'll go over these bits tomorrow.

3431
10:07:43,889 --> 10:07:45,889
The stream's not gonna be...

3432
10:07:45,889 --> 10:07:54,910
The stream's gonna start in like

3433
10:07:54,910 --> 10:07:57,860
16 hours.

3434
10:07:57,860 --> 10:07:59,860
14 hours or something.

3435
10:07:59,860 --> 10:08:01,860
I don't know.

3436
10:08:01,860 --> 10:08:11,389
16 hours. 14 hours or something.

3437
10:08:11,389 --> 10:08:13,389
I'm just wrecked

3438
10:08:13,389 --> 10:08:19,730
right now.

3439
10:08:19,730 --> 10:08:21,730
We're not gonna go that late tomorrow, I promise.

3440
10:08:21,730 --> 10:08:24,540
Because tomorrow is

3441
10:08:24,540 --> 10:08:26,540
gonna be a little more elaborate.

3442
10:08:26,540 --> 10:08:29,550
Tomorrow I'm playing You're in the Movies.

3443
10:08:29,550 --> 10:08:31,550
It's gonna be an on camera

3444
10:08:31,550 --> 10:08:33,550
stream with a green screen behind me.

3445
10:08:33,550 --> 10:08:35,550
It's a whole game based around being on a green screen.

3446
10:08:35,550 --> 10:08:40,540
Yeah, sorry I'm not doing

3447
10:08:40,540 --> 10:08:42,540
the bits. I hate to...

3448
10:08:42,540 --> 10:08:44,540
I really hate doing this, but we'll do them all tomorrow.

3449
10:08:44,540 --> 10:08:48,769
Kinda like we did last time when the

3450
10:08:48,769 --> 10:08:50,769
stream got cut off. We just kinda hung out.

3451
10:08:50,769 --> 10:08:52,769
Played a game and just kinda chilled and

3452
10:08:52,769 --> 10:08:55,519
went over them and talked about stuff.

3453
10:08:55,519 --> 10:08:57,519
The credits I can do, because the credits are

3454
10:08:57,519 --> 10:09:03,089
right here. The sub credits.

3455
10:09:03,089 --> 10:09:10,379
Wow, we're here though. I do wanna catch the

3456
10:09:10,379 --> 10:09:17,040
community subs that I did miss.

3457
10:09:17,040 --> 10:09:19,040
I do wanna say that.

3458
10:09:19,040 --> 10:09:21,040
Say thanks to those people, because there was a bunch of community subs tonight.

3459
10:09:21,040 --> 10:09:25,389
Here they come!

3460
10:09:25,389 --> 10:09:27,629
Can you see them?

3461
10:09:27,629 --> 10:09:31,389
Why can I not see these?

3462
10:09:31,389 --> 10:09:35,230
Roll credits, let's go. Holy shit, that's a lot.

3463
10:09:35,230 --> 10:09:37,470
Thank you everybody for the subs.

3464
10:09:37,470 --> 10:09:50,260
Seriously.

3465
10:09:50,260 --> 10:09:52,260
A lot of fucking resubs, a lot of community subs.

3466
10:09:52,260 --> 10:09:54,500
Speaking of community subs.

3467
10:09:54,500 --> 10:09:56,500
Magellan gave 5 community subs.

3468
10:09:56,500 --> 10:09:58,860
Kazzy gave 5 community subs.

3469
10:09:58,860 --> 10:10:00,860
JermaSucks gave 5 community subs.

3470
10:10:00,860 --> 10:10:06,860
Thank you.

3471
10:10:06,860 --> 10:10:08,860
There was a lot of random $150

3472
10:10:08,860 --> 10:10:10,860
bits we went over. I think we got all of them.

3473
10:10:10,860 --> 10:10:17,010
And we will absolutely

3474
10:10:17,010 --> 10:10:19,010
slowly go over these tomorrow after

3475
10:10:19,010 --> 10:10:21,010
this stream. Am I quiet?

3476
10:10:21,010 --> 10:10:23,010
Oh yeah, that's right. Why is this so quiet?

3477
10:10:23,010 --> 10:10:26,400
Sorry about that. And then Tingy right now,

3478
10:10:26,400 --> 10:10:34,849
thanks for the 5 community subs.

3479
10:10:34,849 --> 10:10:37,279
That game was good. I liked that game.

3480
10:10:37,279 --> 10:10:40,669
Enough to give it a 6.3.

3481
10:10:40,669 --> 10:10:44,699
What did I say?

3482
10:10:44,699 --> 10:10:46,699
5.9? 5.9.

3483
10:10:46,699 --> 10:10:48,699
I think 6.1 is fair.

3484
10:10:48,699 --> 10:10:59,709
I'll meet you in the middle.

3485
10:10:59,709 --> 10:11:04,900
Keeps going up.

3486
10:11:04,900 --> 10:11:06,900
Rank all the FromSoftware games.

3487
10:11:06,900 --> 10:11:09,199
Bloodborne, Demon's Souls.

3488
10:11:13,099 --> 10:11:15,470
Dark Souls 1.

3489
10:11:15,470 --> 10:11:18,540
Sekiro and Dark Souls 3

3490
10:11:18,540 --> 10:11:20,540
are kind of tied, I think.

3491
10:11:20,540 --> 10:11:22,779
Dark Souls 2.

3492
10:11:22,779 --> 10:11:27,900
I said Demon's Souls, yeah.

3493
10:11:27,900 --> 10:11:29,900
Demon's Souls is at the top. So Dark Souls 2.

3494
10:11:29,900 --> 10:11:33,620
Every video game

3495
10:11:33,620 --> 10:11:35,620
that released for Super Nintendo.

3496
10:11:35,620 --> 10:11:37,620
Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1,

3497
10:11:37,620 --> 10:11:41,459
PlayStation 2.

3498
10:11:41,459 --> 10:11:43,459
Every putt-putt game.

3499
10:11:43,459 --> 10:11:49,019
And then Metal Wolf Chaos.

3500
10:11:49,019 --> 10:12:00,589
Is this worst

3501
10:12:00,589 --> 10:12:02,959
or best? That's maybe.

3502
10:12:02,959 --> 10:12:05,199
He's still bad.

3503
10:12:05,199 --> 10:12:07,199
No I'm not.

3504
10:12:07,199 --> 10:12:10,019
Ow.

3505
10:12:10,019 --> 10:12:12,019
This is one of those strange moments.

3506
10:12:12,019 --> 10:12:14,019
Sometimes

3507
10:12:14,019 --> 10:12:16,019
you just lock in

3508
10:12:16,019 --> 10:12:18,019
and decide you're going to do something.

3509
10:12:18,019 --> 10:12:22,800
Love of Sekiro

3510
10:12:22,800 --> 10:12:24,800
destroys people's egos and makes them

3511
10:12:24,800 --> 10:12:26,800
really mad at it. It did that to me.

3512
10:12:26,800 --> 10:12:28,800
I was so

3513
10:12:28,800 --> 10:12:30,800
frustrated in Sekiro.

3514
10:12:30,800 --> 10:12:32,800
I did it though. I completed it. I got to the very end.

3515
10:12:32,800 --> 10:12:45,860
This had like

3516
10:12:45,860 --> 10:12:47,860
3 meltdowns. It was impressive.

3517
10:12:47,860 --> 10:12:50,029
Oh it was big. 11 hours.

3518
10:12:50,029 --> 10:12:52,029
It's almost 11 and a half hours.

3519
10:12:52,029 --> 10:12:54,029
That's like almost two streams.

3520
10:12:54,029 --> 10:13:01,069
No. It was more like

3521
10:13:01,069 --> 10:13:03,069
one funny pretend

3522
10:13:03,069 --> 10:13:05,069
laugh out loud meltdown.

3523
10:13:05,069 --> 10:13:07,760
One real meltdown.

3524
10:13:07,760 --> 10:13:13,260
One of those meltdowns

3525
10:13:13,260 --> 10:13:31,889
was just for fun.

3526
10:13:31,889 --> 10:13:33,889
Alright goodnight guys. I'll see you tomorrow. We'll do the bits tomorrow.

3527
10:13:33,889 --> 10:13:35,889
And the stream tomorrow is

3528
10:13:35,889 --> 10:13:37,889
going to be all over the place. I cannot even

3529
10:13:37,889 --> 10:13:39,889
describe what we're going to have. It might

3530
10:13:39,889 --> 10:13:41,889
just be a disaster.

3531
10:13:41,889 --> 10:13:43,889
But I don't think so. Should be a lot of fun.

3532
10:13:43,889 --> 10:13:45,889
See you tomorrow. Or see you later today.

3533
10:13:45,889 --> 10:13:47,889
Probably around

3534
10:13:47,889 --> 10:13:49,889
4 o'clock Pacific.

3535
10:13:49,889 --> 10:13:51,889
3 to 4. We're going to do regular time tomorrow.

3536
10:13:51,889 --> 10:14:00,959
Goodnight.

3537
10:14:00,959 --> 10:14:02,959
Try it yourself. Metal Gear

3538
10:14:02,959 --> 10:14:05,389
Chaos

3539
10:14:05,389 --> 10:14:07,389
XD

3540
10:14:07,389 --> 10:14:09,389
Give it a try. It was a little hard. It was a little

3541
10:14:09,389 --> 10:14:11,760
crazy.

3542
10:14:11,760 --> 10:14:13,760
Interesting money mechanic.

3543
10:14:13,760 --> 10:14:15,760
It was alright. I had

3544
10:14:15,760 --> 10:14:17,760
some fun. I did. But I didn't like a lot

3545
10:14:17,760 --> 10:14:19,760
of parts. But I did like some parts.

3546
10:14:19,760 --> 10:14:22,190
That's my review.

3547
10:14:22,190 --> 10:14:24,190
See you tomorrow. Have a great night.
