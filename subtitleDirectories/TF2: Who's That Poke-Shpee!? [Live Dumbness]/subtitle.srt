1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:05,320
It's Spy. Spy.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,140
Who's that Pokemon? It's Spy.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,080
Spy, I choose you.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,339
No, if it was like Ash, it would be like...

5
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:25,179
Oh my god, come on, Gerudo. Go get him.

6
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:26,179
Gerudo.

7
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:30,179
No, pull back, Gerudo. You can't do it. He's too strong.

8
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,179
Gerudo.

9
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:34,179
Spy, I choose you.

10
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:35,179
It's you.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,740
Use Bakespade.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,100
It's super effective.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,100
Oh wow. Spy, that was fantastic. I really love you.

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,710
Who's that Pokemon?

15
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:12,189
Hey guys, I'll trade you my holographic Charizard for your holographic Shpee.

16
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:14,189
No, that's not worth it.

17
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:21,200
A holographic Shpee is worth like $500,000.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,569
You're gonna try to rip me off right now?

19
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:28,129
There's only one in the world, but I've got the one with Japanese text.

20
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:32,560
Do you really? Do you seriously have that?

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,930
Did you guys ever like play Pokemon trading cards?

22
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,489
Do you seriously have that card though? Because I kind of want it with the Japanese text.

23
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:46,500
Oh my goodness, man. Are you okay?

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
That went right into his mouth. Dude, are you alright?

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Please get me to a doctor. I'm sorry, just chill out.

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,680
I gotta pull the arrow out though. Hold on, just don't talk.

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Just don't talk. Get it out of me, mate. Come on.

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,680
I'm trying to. I'm really sorry I did that.

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Oh my god, fucking help. Guys, help, please.

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,560
Fucking murdered this guy.

31
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,799
Turbo, where are you?

32
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,039
Gotta get you away from the scene of the crime.

33
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,039
I wanna see your trophy.

34
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,039
Oh, he's gone. It's too bad.

35
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,039
It was absolutely heinous looking.

36
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:17,300
No. Was it a sniper?

37
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,300
Yes, it was.

38
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,250
Man, that took a lot to do that.

39
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,379
That took a lot to do that.

40
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,379
Alright, I found nobody.

41
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,379
Nobody scared the spy. I found a spy.

42
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,379
It's guaranteed that he's a spy.

43
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,560
Where are you? Just don't scare him.

44
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,560
He's in the wild right now. He doesn't think I know he's a spy.

45
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
I don't know where you are. He's the scout.

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,500
Don't kill him. Howie?

47
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Oh, you're right behind him. He's right here.

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,680
He's gonna backstab you, boof.

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Come on.

50
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
I saw that.

52
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,680
I didn't know you were playing that heavy.

53
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
I'm really sorry.

54
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,680
Yeah, I'm playing shithead Natasha Gibbous heavy.

55
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,379
Oh, boy.

56
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:18,870
Watch out for these shtickies.

57
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,870
Don't do what I was gonna do to you, you punk.

58
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:29,580
What? Why?

59
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,840
Who did I just kill?

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
I'm so confused right now from that.

61
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:44,620
Scout on the point. Scout on the point.

62
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,979
Scout on the point.

63
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:48,979
This will be the last time you do believe I'm on fire.

64
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,860
Screw to the poop. Pyro on the poop.

65
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,879
Peep on the poop.

66
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,879
I can't stay here.

67
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,879
Come on. Use your rainy unusual and kill that person.

68
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,340
See Ted.

69
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,340
The Ted trademark. This guy has a trademarked name.

70
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,080
I'll give you a trademark.

71
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,080
You can shove that trademark right up your ass.

72
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:21,100
Oh, Pyro. Don't do it.

73
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,850
All right, gentlemen. I'll be putting up a dispenser up here.

74
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,850
Don't worry.

75
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,850
Let me get this thing up here. Don't worry about that.

76
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,410
I'm just gonna get some stuff up here.

77
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,410
Barack Obama plays engineer.

78
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,379
So what's your favorite class, Barack?

79
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:45,899
So the thing is, let me be perfectly clear.

80
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,899
As the engineer, I want to give everybody a shot.

81
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:53,410
And, you know...

82
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,800
They're fucking spawn camping us.

83
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,550
I see that, yeah.

84
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,269
People love America. I have arms to solve your practical problems.

85
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:12,220
Actually, Barack Obama's voice kind of does fit on the engineer.

86
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,220
If you replace the engineer's voice with the Barack Obama lines...

87
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,899
How are you even back...

88
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,899
And you're telling me that wasn't a headshot.

89
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:26,170
I don't know what language in what world that's not headshots.

90
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,899
But I'll just die again for like a 50th time.

91
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,529
If I get an Uber, I'll give it to you.

92
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:38,529
If you give me that Uber, you're gonna be very sad.

93
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:40,529
Just gonna let you know.

94
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:43,980
If you give me that Uber, you are going to cry.

95
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,980
Oh, turn around. Holy crap.

96
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,220
Don't die.

97
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,529
Body shield. Sniper body shield.

98
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:52,529
Alright, you want to go meet people?

99
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,529
Wait, I'm gonna grab this health and that'll be it.

100
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:58,529
Alright, do you want to go like metaphorically and physically meet people?

101
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,529
Yes, let's do it.

102
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,529
Alright, we're gonna go meet the red team.

103
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,529
Oh, you actually have meat. Okay, let's go meet people.

104
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,529
Let's go meet some friends.

105
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:10,410
Alright, let's go meet this engineer and this whole team.

106
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,410
Meet the sniper!

107
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,709
Chop chop, mate.

108
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,709
Chop chop, mate.

109
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,709
Oh crap.

110
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,709
Hey, chop chop, mate.

111
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:24,189
Damn it.

112
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,430
Well, that's where I...

113
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,430
That was one of the better Ubers I've had recently.

114
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,139
We actually killed people that time.

115
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,139
We actually got a couple kills.
