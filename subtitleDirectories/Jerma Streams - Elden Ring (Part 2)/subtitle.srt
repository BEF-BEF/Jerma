1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,049
Somebody said, Jerma, please only stream for four hours today.

2
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:23,859
Why? That's not enough time to beat the third boss, Wendelinda Gargantuan.

3
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:38,740
Rerecorded. What do you mean I have to leave? I have to leave? Well, when you come back, we'll probably still be live.

4
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,909
Anything less than 12 hours today is quitting.

5
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:54,259
Uh, I can't- I can't agree with that. Unfortunately.

6
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,100
I've got one of those voices today. That's a radio voice.

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,100
Because I talked a lot yesterday for about nine and a half straight hours.

8
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,859
And I woke up today with what I would call something that would be a guaranteed gig.

9
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:14,840
For an early morning commute, uh, talk show host.

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,640
Joe, what's your eyebrows? Maybe I will eventually show you my eyebrows, but not right now.

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,680
Right now we're going to talk about, um, Elden Ring.

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:30,340
Hi Joe. Does he want to come in here? Hold on. You want to come in here?

13
00:01:30,500 --> 00:02:11,189
I opened the door and he just ran. He was like, let me in!

14
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,750
And then I opened the door and he went, and just sprinted.

15
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,840
Does- uh, maybe he wants something. I don't know.

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,439
He doesn't want- he doesn't seem like he wants anything.

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,599
Bring him back. I think he wants somebody to like, chase him around the house.

18
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,860
Dogs are so weird. Hey, come chase me around the- come chase me around the living room!

19
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,479
I do. And we play, I run after him, and then he runs after me.

20
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,629
One of our oldest, oldest games.

21
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:55,879
What's with the pickle thing? Okay, are people really trying-

22
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,810
are people trying to make a meme in Elden Ring? Right?

23
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,870
That's- that's what's going on, right? Like, pickles, like,

24
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,469
pickled relish and shit, right? This is like an Elden Ring meme thing that's happening, I think.

25
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:14,900
You should take CBDTHC to play on extra hard mode.

26
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:21,030
If I were to be high, I would not be able to play this game.

27
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:25,289
Do you understand how horrible that would be?

28
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:30,819
The stream would be an embarrassment. It would be embarrassing.

29
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,539
I would be walking around and forgetting where I was,

30
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:38,099
and I wouldn't even be able to fight enemies and shit. It would be impossible.

31
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:50,139
What did you call last night? Okay.

32
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,889
Like, yesterday was an embarrassment? No, was it? I pre- I killed like four bosses!

33
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,449
And I explored the world, and I immersed myself in the world,

34
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:07,909
and I walked around and did stuff. I got four boss progression.

35
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,389
Your eyebrows were embarrassing. All right.

36
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,100
Let's just- are you guys ready? Because I'm ready to play.

37
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:28,120
About the same boss for four hours? No, I fought the same boss for like an hour and ten minutes.

38
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:31,290
You can't- don't- don't gaslight me here.

39
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:37,180
I played that boss for about an hour and ten minutes, and you know how I know.

40
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:44,139
I went back, and I just checked on my VOD to see the exact time it took for me to beat that boss.

41
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,100
And it was about an hour and 12 minutes.

42
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,939
Just to make sure that I could defend myself if somebody ever said,

43
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,910
oh yeah, dude, just like you spent five and a half hours on the first boss,

44
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,709
I can go, no, it was an hour and 12 minutes. Go back and look at the data.

45
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,720
Did you eat another salad? No, I actually did not.

46
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,689
So I might be playing at a little bit less power today.

47
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:15,829
I did have a little bit of a snack, and I'm- and actually,

48
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:17,509
because I know I'm going to be going long today,

49
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,610
I'm ready to take a food break somewhere in the middle, which will be a salad.

50
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,779
I do have my- I've got my green tea powder here.

51
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:34,230
It's the thing that gives me my gaming powers.

52
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:38,329
Oh, it's ready. I think I'm ready to go.

53
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,939
Can you burp on stream? Maybe.

54
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:55,699
Okay. Hello. How are you? Previously on Elden Ring.

55
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,540
Do you have a Caesar salad? No, I don't really- I don't know.

56
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,060
Ever since I found out that anchovies were in Caesar salad dressing,

57
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,300
I kind of just, like, don't want it anymore.

58
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,180
That sucks, and I know. It's, like, stupid.

59
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:15,060
Okay, I like anchovies. I like sardines. I like fish and stuff, right?

60
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:22,149
But the fact that there's anchovies in a lot of, like, Caesar salad dressing,

61
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,759
it's- the combination of it kind of freaks me out for some reason, even if I know it's good.

62
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:32,699
Like, if you put Caesar salad dressing without the anchovies here,

63
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:39,339
and you put an anchovy here, I would be okay with dipping the anchovy

64
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,259
in the Caesar dressing and eating it.

65
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:43,579
But the combination to me is like, oh, I don't know about that.

66
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,250
I don't know. Maybe I should bring that up to the doctor next time I see him.

67
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,560
All right, ready? Why does it matter?

68
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,800
It doesn't. And I still eat it. Look, okay.

69
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,120
I gotta- I gotta clarify some things with some people here.

70
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,199
I think there's people here that think that because I- like, ovens freak me out,

71
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,319
that, like, I've never cooked in an oven in my entire life,

72
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,680
and all my food, like, comes out of the fucking, like, of a bag in the refrigerator.

73
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,839
No, I still- I use the oven.

74
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,819
When I- when I talk about, like, the microwave being something that freaks me out,

75
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,899
I- it's not like I hear the microwave turn on and, like, put up, like-

76
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:27,180
like, run into, like, a room and, like, hide in the corner and go, like,

77
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,939
Turn it off! Turn off the microwave!

78
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:32,459
I still use it. It's just kind of a weird device. It's easy.

79
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:43,699
He's an admitted oven user.

80
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,060
Why does it freak you out?

81
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,100
It's weird. It's like radio waves making your food hot.

82
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,019
It's weird. I- I use it- I used it literally, like, 12 hours ago.

83
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:53,060
But it's a weird device.

84
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,540
All right, what was I doing in my, uh, game of the year 20- what year is it? 2022.

85
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,639
It's not a radio wave, it's a microwave. Whatever the- I don't- it doesn't matter.

86
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,600
Still the same weirdness.

87
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,089
I'm not gonna get into this again because people will just leave.

88
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,089
All right, so what was I doing? Oh, yeah, I forgot. I was going this way.

89
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:16,649
I was exploring a little.

90
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,660
The magical world of, uh, Lindgrave.

91
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,540
I did see that they made a post about all the PC problems.

92
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,379
I saw how they were saying,

93
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,419
Oh, hey, yeah, we're aware that, like, the frame drops kind of fuck everything up.

94
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,220
And, like, especially the big and bold, bright, bright green text.

95
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:46,019
We are very aware of, uh, of Dodge not registering on some German 985 PC computers.

96
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,100
We're gonna address this immediately.

97
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,779
So I'm really, truly- I'm glad that they actually, you know, addressed it.

98
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,570
But actually, they are talking about it.

99
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:59,320
So, um, all right, I forgot that guy was even there.

100
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:01,610
I gotta get back in the swing of things.

101
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,200
So what's down here?

102
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,789
A bunch of explosive shit.

103
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,149
This is gonna be such a pain in the ass.

104
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:18,179
They're all gonna throw shit at me and it's gonna be annoying.

105
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,340
My hands are already sweating.

106
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,460
I didn't even do anything.

107
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,179
You know, no, I think this is sweat that's been here since last night.

108
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,639
As disgusting as that is.

109
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,559
I actually think I- because I just picked up, like, a-

110
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,320
Like, it's like the controller had olive oil on it.

111
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:36,629
I think this has just been here because I didn't, like, I didn't clean it.

112
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:44,659
Watch out for the dive.

113
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,620
What the fuck? Clean it.

114
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,899
It's- I- it's fine.

115
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,659
Actually, it's- it's really not fine.

116
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,539
I'm actually probably gonna have to wipe it down with this.

117
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,559
We're good.

118
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,539
Danger clothes.

119
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,980
I'm wearing completely different clothes than yesterday.

120
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,860
Controller Andy.

121
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,990
How do you- how do you play these games?

122
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,629
What's going on?

123
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,250
Playing with controller is how- like, the way you play these games.

124
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,649
Playing with the keyboard and mouse is- is hard mode.

125
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:25,450
That's hard mode.

126
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:31,399
Keyboard, mouse, with- what?

127
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,200
That's what- actually, I would call that way too hard mode.

128
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:41,690
That's not even hard mode.

129
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,529
Okay, so we're keeping going here.

130
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:46,570
Make sure I check for items.

131
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,409
Remember, you're epic and you make me LOL.

132
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:56,840
All right, so I'm just gonna throw, like, a grenade down here, right?

133
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:09,139
Wait, that was a pretty view.

134
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:09,779
Let me look at it.

135
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,700
Nice.

136
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,419
Really nice.

137
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:18,549
That looks like- I thought that was a Statue of Liberty.

138
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,679
I was like, that's kind of weird.

139
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,750
You should jump off.

140
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:26,950
I'm not gonna jump off.

141
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,470
Same joke?

142
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,149
Elden Ring takes place in New York.

143
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,899
Can you imagine just walking around and it's like,

144
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,500
oh, look at this beautiful castle.

145
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,299
It's so nice.

146
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:44,500
And you just- you just hear, like, ambient audio of, like-

147
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:55,139
That'd actually be kind of funny.

148
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,629
Oh, thank you.

149
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:05,879
Good try, though.

150
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:14,759
And- not just the cars, but for, like, every- hold on.

151
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,779
Let me- let me- let me just, like-

152
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,220
Quintessential city background audio is not even cars.

153
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:31,860
It's- with a little bit of an echo in the distance, like, every eight minutes.

154
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
It's just, like, the truck backing up sound.

155
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,899
Just that, like,

156
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,240
It wakes me up every morning.

157
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah.

158
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,460
This truck- A truck is backing up and you wonder,

159
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:59,299
man, that- wow, that truck's doing a lot of work.

160
00:12:59,299 --> 00:12:59,860
No, bro.

161
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,220
That's, like, a hundred different trucks in different places.

162
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:07,049
It's like, oh, that- that's- that's the same truck.

163
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:08,409
They're doing a lot of work today.

164
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:10,330
Nope, that's, like, 5,000 trucks.

165
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,529
All in- scattered around the entire city.

166
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:15,509
And jackhammers?

167
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:16,009
Yeah.

168
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:17,669
Wait, did I miss anything here?

169
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:20,889
No, it's just one truck.

170
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:26,700
I always thought it was one truck, but it goes on all day

171
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,179
and it'd be like, why is the same truck backing up

172
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:30,860
over and over and over again in the same spot?

173
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:32,940
No, it's a different truck.

174
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:38,220
All right.

175
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:42,580
Why does it keep leaning in?

176
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:44,659
I'm a weirdo.

177
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,179
I don't know, like, somebody was saying yesterday,

178
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:47,299
and I looked at the VOD.

179
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,940
They were like, dude, you would probably be playing this game

180
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,299
five times better if you stopped dodging with the guy on screen.

181
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:59,259
And it's just like, you know, that's just what- I can't help it.

182
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:00,779
I actually can't help doing that.

183
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,700
It's going to happen.

184
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,220
I can't stop that from happening.

185
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,419
In fact, I don't know how people play these games just, like,

186
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:11,100
with a huge monster on the screen

187
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,700
and a bunch of crazy shit is happening.

188
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,620
And they're just like, like, I'm under attack.

189
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,299
You're- I'm under attack in- when this happens.

190
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:23,580
It's- I don't know how you stay so calm.

191
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,799
They're actual gamers.

192
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,860
Okay, I'm going to get killed out here.

193
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:38,409
Oh, well, all right, I can go down there.

194
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:42,620
Wait, let's go this way.

195
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,539
This is probably my favorite area of the game so far.

196
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,019
I could just fall- I could just go and go for it.

197
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,710
You know what I mean?

198
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:54,710
I could go for it right now.

199
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,029
Oh.

200
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:05,700
What's down here?

201
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,139
I don't know what to do.

202
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:11,700
I don't know what to do.

203
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,769
I think I'm going to go with hole.

204
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:18,340
Yep, I'm going hole.

205
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:28,330
It's not going to hurt me, right?

206
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:35,720
Oh, shit, okay.

207
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,200
All right, so what's in here?

208
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:45,879
All right, I think it's an NPC right there.

209
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,200
Yeah, my voice is going to be like this for like a 15 minutes.

210
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,440
Is that an enemy or an NPC?

211
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,370
An NPC.

212
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,169
All right, what do you got to say?

213
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,159
Nice to meet you.

214
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,840
The pleasure's mine.

215
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,330
Roger is the name.

216
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,610
A sorcerer.

217
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,049
That's like a mushroom hat.

218
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:03,850
You might have guessed.

219
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,490
Sorcerer!

220
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,690
I'm looking for a little something here in the castle.

221
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,629
I'm not hot-footing it from the troops, that is.

222
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:11,669
But enough about me.

223
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:14,950
What are you doing here in Stormvale Castle?

224
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,950
Sorcerer's Sue.

225
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,909
Oh, boy.

226
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:18,470
That's bad.

227
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,629
They sacrifice our kind for grafting.

228
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:26,629
Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind.

229
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:27,350
Does he got, um...

230
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,669
I'm here to defeat Godric.

231
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:31,350
Did I say?

232
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,870
What if he's a friend?

233
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,309
What if he's friends with Godric?

234
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:39,779
I'm here to defeat Godric.

235
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:40,259
I see.

236
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:45,240
Here to challenge Godric and lay your hands upon a grave.

237
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,600
You can see it then.

238
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,559
I take it.

239
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,129
The guidance of grace.

240
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:50,490
Well...

241
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,730
You're the only person that's doing a magic build, and I love it.

242
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,330
I'm tarnished, like you.

243
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,049
But...

244
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,409
I think there's other people doing it.

245
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:57,210
I've seen neither...

246
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,250
I'm not a pure caster, though.

247
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,850
... this guidance for the longest time.

248
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,339
Still, won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between.

249
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,539
I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.

250
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,700
Would you care to learn one?

251
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,460
As a fellow tarnished, once guided by grace, I'd love to...

252
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,339
Magical battle art?

253
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,539
Oh my god, this could change everything.

254
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,559
Yeah.

255
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:26,680
Grants affinities and skills to an...

256
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,480
Wait, what does this do?

257
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,849
The ash of war grants an armament of the magic affinity and the following skill.

258
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:35,049
Spinning weapon.

259
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:37,849
Defensive skill employed by carrion princesses.

260
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,029
Lifts armament into the midair that makes it spin violently.

261
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:47,829
Those it touches will suffer a successive attack.

262
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:50,220
Useful on small...

263
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,700
Okay, so this is like a magical spinning blade?

264
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,920
Ahem.

265
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,259
Carrion royal prestige embodying a skill.

266
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:01,259
Transform blade into a magical greatsword.

267
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:02,299
Oh, it's the swing.

268
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:03,180
The magic swing.

269
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,680
Ooh.

270
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,339
Linestone pebble.

271
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:09,059
I already have this, though.

272
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:17,910
Wait, what?

273
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,390
Wait.

274
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,670
This is a weapon art version of the one I already have.

275
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,930
I think I want this.

276
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,809
Yeah, I want this one.

277
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,779
All right, I gotta remember where this guy is.

278
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:31,990
I will forget.

279
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,349
You fucking bet your ass I will.

280
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,109
I gotta get rid of the other ones.

281
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:35,750
Look at all these.

282
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,069
Yeah.

283
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:37,190
I got so much shit on the map.

284
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:41,670
Because they're the markers.

285
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:46,420
Is that one there?

286
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:48,599
Okay, yeah.

287
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,559
I gotta remember where he is.

288
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,299
For me, you're gonna mold hard in about 30 minutes.

289
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,180
You know, you could probably say that at any timestamp in this whole stream,

290
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,980
and you'd probably...

291
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,539
You'd be right.

292
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,900
You'd be close enough, probably, I would assume.

293
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,019
Put it on the notepad?

294
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,660
Oh, yeah.

295
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,619
That's actually true.

296
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:08,900
Very true.

297
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,450
Okay.

298
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,799
At...

299
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,839
At one.

300
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:28,099
At waypoint one has new spells.

301
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,140
All right, that's good.

302
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:34,140
I have to be careful.

303
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,099
I don't want to hit him.

304
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:35,599
Okay, good.

305
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:37,500
All right.

306
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,380
So that's where he is.

307
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:38,940
I gotta remember...

308
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,779
Wait, where's the marker?

309
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:45,799
Oh, the marker go away.

310
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:46,119
All right.

311
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,079
Sorcerer in there.

312
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,670
Can you imagine if this was the game facts for this?

313
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:59,640
This is my game facts for Elden Ring.

314
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:02,920
Full walkthrough.

315
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:06,390
Door next to spawn is blocked shut.

316
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,900
Two stone sword key gargoyle statue at tutorial zone bonfire.

317
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:15,109
Looking for Lanius sent back to main character of anime.

318
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:18,730
Winstone key for sorcerer guy and to open CL2 academy.

319
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,420
Buster pat sorcerer at waypoint one has new spells.

320
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,150
I'm just starting to do auto.

321
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:35,450
These are dog notes.

322
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:40,009
If auto knew how to read and write, this is how he would do it.

323
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:47,980
What about in here?

324
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:00,970
Would the guy in front of him hear this?

325
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:05,500
Gorsh, I hope not.

326
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,289
You got bombs, dude.

327
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:17,849
Okay, run.

328
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:34,569
Trying to hit them both.

329
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:35,769
What did I just hit?

330
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:36,410
I hit something else?

331
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,109
Were there two people sitting in the corner?

332
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,140
Oh, I didn't get...

333
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:48,279
This is bad.

334
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,849
This is bad.

335
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:50,490
This is really bad.

336
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:52,730
Yeah, okay.

337
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,259
I hit left.

338
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:57,259
This is why, like, okay.

339
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,210
Hitting left on the D-pad to get the sorcerer stick in order to do the parry.

340
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:05,849
I would have hit it.

341
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,490
It's like I have four fucking items.

342
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,170
I feel like...

343
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:15,740
Not gonna get it.

344
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,059
It's been 10 minutes, so you were wrong, by 20 minutes.

345
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,480
Just two guys sleeping in the corner.

346
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:30,859
What?

347
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:36,660
Did they increase the hitboxes in these games by, like, 500,000%?

348
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:47,349
I feel like an action happens here and in, like, a four-mile radius it actually hits.

349
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:03,140
Like, that beaked motherfucker right there threw a bomb at me

350
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,740
and it hit two other people in other games that are not even here.

351
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,490
Just kill me.

352
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,089
Alright, I'm shooting this guy from far away.

353
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:34,259
Somebody got punched in the face in that top tower and my neck started to hurt.

354
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,480
Okay, give me my sorcerer's abilities.

355
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,150
Oh, hi.

356
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,029
I can do it too, you know.

357
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,950
Really utilizing, like, the exploding barrels.

358
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:58,730
The barrels.

359
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,450
Barrels everywhere.

360
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,410
There's barrels everywhere.

361
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,529
I lost the souls that I had.

362
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:02,730
Thanks a lot, Donkey Kong.

363
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:28,740
Watch out.

364
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:30,660
This is so far away.

365
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,180
I was probably so close to a bonfire too.

366
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,900
That's so annoying.

367
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:37,910
Oh.

368
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:43,910
Oh.

369
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:46,980
Alright.

370
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,789
He's my favorite Sonic character.

371
00:24:58,569 --> 00:24:59,849
Who cares?

372
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:00,650
Who cares?

373
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:03,130
Stop asking questions like that.

374
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:04,890
Who gives a shit?

375
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:06,970
It's fucking...

376
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,569
It's Tails, I guess.

377
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:09,049
I don't know.

378
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,869
You know why it's Tails?

379
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:24,569
Here's why it's Tails.

380
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,569
You don't have any responsibility as Tails.

381
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:28,890
Zero.

382
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:34,230
Your friend gets to be the one that makes all the fucking wrong decisions

383
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,349
while you just float around.

384
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:39,670
So it was awesome when somebody wanted to play Sonic.

385
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,509
Because I would always pick Tails.

386
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:44,789
Because I knew that that idiot that missed the jump,

387
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:45,990
I was just kind of hanging out.

388
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,640
Always player two.

389
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:04,140
Yeah, Tails was the equivalent of what they did in Mario Galaxy.

390
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:07,400
Where you could give somebody else the controller

391
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,720
and they could just be a little pink star on the screen

392
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,000
and collect items for you.

393
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,640
That's Tails.

394
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,519
That's what Tails was.

395
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,500
You're at 100 deaths?

396
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,420
Okay, I need to pay attention.

397
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:22,740
No more...

398
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:25,859
I'm not speaking ever again.

399
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:40,250
Okay.

400
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:43,930
So there you go.

401
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,329
But the answer is that actually he's probably big the cat

402
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:47,769
because he's the one with the fishing pole, right?

403
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:49,660
So that's kind of cool.

404
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,109
Alright, keep going.

405
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,390
I do, okay?

406
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,339
I didn't even need to go up there.

407
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:06,299
That was such a waste of time.

408
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,259
Alright, no more fucking around.

409
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,099
It wasn't really worth coming here,

410
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,059
but this looks like it can break.

411
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:23,529
Oh, nothing.

412
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:31,500
Okay, this is just the same place that I was.

413
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:34,279
This horse first guy is right there.

414
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:37,210
Why stop getting rid of my shit?

415
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,380
Um, this looks...

416
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,339
Okay, this is like a hand with like a magical spell on it.

417
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:49,140
So that's what I'm going to say.

418
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:57,450
Have you tried the McPlant?

419
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,410
Is it in America yet?

420
00:27:59,130 --> 00:27:59,930
I don't think so.

421
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,000
By the way, you're a McPlant.

422
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:12,470
Is there no way you don't work for that company?

423
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:18,579
I don't know.

424
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:18,900
Oh, man.

425
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,720
I fucking love McDonald's.

426
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,119
I'm kidding.

427
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,470
I haven't tried it yet.

428
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,869
No, no.

429
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,420
I'm really spicy this morning.

430
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,099
Yeah, it's four o'clock in the afternoon.

431
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:39,420
I know.

432
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,160
Okay, these two...

433
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,410
I got to...

434
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:53,660
It's going to come down to catching them off guard

435
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,220
and just doing cast, cast, cast, cast, cast, cast,

436
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,339
and get them in like a bowling pin.

437
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,619
Let's play bowling.

438
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,029
What?

439
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:15,579
No way.

440
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,950
Third time's the charm.

441
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,039
Huh?

442
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:42,440
What?

443
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,160
Where were we?

444
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,529
Did I fall through the map?

445
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,089
I fell through the fucking map?

446
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,299
What?

447
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,470
Where were we?

448
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,059
What happened?

449
00:29:56,859 --> 00:29:58,710
All right, fuck this.

450
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,160
Okay, I could probably make it.

451
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:04,839
I just wanted to skip it.

452
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,640
I can definitely make it.

453
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,500
I know backing up in From Software Games

454
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,980
is like digging straight up in Minecraft.

455
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
I know, but like sometimes you have to do it.

456
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,859
Otherwise, what am I going to do?

457
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:27,880
Dude, I can absolutely make that.

458
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,000
There's no way I can.

459
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,799
I just have to get a little...

460
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:30,680
I've got to go to the corner.

461
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:34,730
Use the horse?

462
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,599
I can't use the horse here.

463
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,059
The horse is banned in Stormvale Castle.

464
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:46,619
Let me just make sure.

465
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:47,180
Let me take a look.

466
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,099
I actually think this is possible.

467
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,240
Right there.

468
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,720
See what I mean?

469
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,160
I think it is.

470
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,420
All right, it's not possible.

471
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,460
Fucking whatever.

472
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,420
It might be, but I'm not going to...

473
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,740
You need to run jump.

474
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,579
It's hard to do, though, because you have to hold B.

475
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,619
And if you touch B too early, you just dodge.

476
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:16,500
So it's like you don't...

477
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,380
There might not be enough time.

478
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:24,309
It's my last try.

479
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,920
Oh, it's possible.

480
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,480
Oh, yeah. Okay.

481
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:31,299
All right, it's possible.

482
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:39,619
I just had to go a little bit more to the right.

483
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,859
That skips that whole area too, so that's perfect.

484
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:47,500
Okay, but counting these deaths as deaths is like...

485
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,700
I'm experimenting with what I can do in the world.

486
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:53,589
So I need to go like here.

487
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:55,190
Like right to the left of the pillar there.

488
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,460
Got it.

489
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,599
Okay.

490
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:06,019
Now, what is that?

491
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:19,059
Okay, so I can drop down there and just kind of go that way with these guys are going.

492
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:22,099
I can skip those guys entirely too, which I don't need to fight everything.

493
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,619
What's down there?

494
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:28,119
Whoa.

495
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,960
I mean, I kind of want to see what that is.

496
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,990
What is that?

497
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,019
Holy shit.

498
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:40,259
All right.

499
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,140
I'm going to go see what that is.

500
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:54,299
Oh, what?

501
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:57,299
I don't think I have one.

502
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:19,099
What's it called?

503
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:19,660
Storm...

504
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,099
Stone sword, not storm sword.

505
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,589
I'm going to abbreviate this.

506
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:26,390
SS key.

507
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:32,890
How many keys does it need?

508
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:35,589
Good question.

509
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,339
I don't want to spend them, but how much does it need?

510
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:42,730
No, it doesn't say.

511
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:44,099
Okay.

512
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:44,740
Well, here we are.

513
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,900
I mean, there's obviously something's going to happen here.

514
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,849
There's no way...

515
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:54,809
Okay, just be ready.

516
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:58,089
Be prepared because there's no way that like five people don't jump down after I touch this.

517
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:00,500
It's too perfect of a spot.

518
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:08,280
In fact, smothering stone?

519
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,820
No, really?

520
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:25,429
What the fuck is that?

521
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,239
I can't go anywhere.

522
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,199
I'm stuck down here.

523
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,889
Is that his back or his front?

524
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:37,449
I don't know.

525
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,860
Is he looking away from me or is he facing this way?

526
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,750
Oh shit.

527
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,679
Oh, that's his front.

528
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,239
That's his front.

529
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:53,739
Okay.

530
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:17,510
I don't think I'm supposed to be here, but give me all the stuff in your house.

531
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:23,800
I don't know what that was, but it's mine now.

532
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:41,719
Oh.

533
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,440
Oh, no.

534
00:35:56,179 --> 00:35:57,139
Don't call me.

535
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:58,900
Don't call me a Cheez-It.

536
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,019
Don't call me a Cheez-It.

537
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,500
I mean, you can, but you don't.

538
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:05,420
I can't Cheez-It.

539
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:07,980
He's too quick and I can't shoot him through the door.

540
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:15,260
Oh, yeah, I can.

541
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,599
Oh, that's some...

542
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,440
That is some pure Gruyere cheese, if I don't say so myself.

543
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,099
Absolute pure delicious Gruyere.

544
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:34,460
Come on.

545
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,420
Come on.

546
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,139
You're dealing with a casual right now.

547
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:38,719
Huh?

548
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:55,900
Do not say that.

549
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,780
Do not say that.

550
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,280
Casual.

551
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:02,360
He almost took my fucking hand clean off my shoulders.

552
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,159
All right, just come over here so I can fucking...

553
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,360
Oh, that's...

554
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,559
No, that's a really good Brie.

555
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,019
No more.

556
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:11,460
Why am I losing walk-on?

557
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,670
I'm so good at fucking video games, man.

558
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:19,179
That's it?

559
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:24,199
Be careful, that guy killed me through a wall.

560
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:24,699
Yeah.

561
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,739
Look, I am a battle mage.

562
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:37,059
I have this claw, which attacks, but I also have the staff, which attacks.

563
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:39,659
You're a bimbo.

564
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,369
I'm playing the bimbo build.

565
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:46,329
Is that what you're telling me?

566
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:49,500
Is this bimbo build?

567
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,480
Wait, what?

568
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,599
Like, I get to hang back and cast spells and only need to use my weapon if I absolutely need to?

569
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:05,880
Oh, okay.

570
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:08,199
I said this last night and I'll say it again.

571
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,440
Sorcery works really well until it doesn't.

572
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,269
And we might find out really soon enough here the places where it doesn't.

573
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:20,579
Oh, it's getting auto-modded.

574
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:25,690
Sorcery works great until it don't.

575
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,239
Sorcery is going to fall off real hard in the next probably couple of hours,

576
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,280
from what I've been told.

577
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:46,250
This is a cringe build.

578
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,579
Can we bring back the guy that said that, like,

579
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:51,739
I'm one of the only people playing a sorcery build?

580
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,179
Where is that person?

581
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:55,900
Can you come back and can you, like, say what you said, like, five more times?

582
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:07,880
I'm building decks and I'm building sorcery as it stands right now.

583
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:13,260
As it stands right now.

584
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,940
My sorcery does more damage than my dexterity attacks.

585
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:21,099
Therefore, I'm going to continue to use it until the dexterity takes it over.

586
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:24,500
The very simple equation.

587
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:25,860
Very easy.

588
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,260
Simple.

589
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:36,010
Can I talk?

590
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,119
It doesn't open from this side.

591
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,179
I'm in trouble here.

592
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:50,070
I think I have to sneak by this person and try to find a bonfire,

593
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,539
which I'm going to think is probably over there.

594
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:53,980
All right.

595
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,940
Two schools of thought here.

596
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,130
Run straight through there and just sprint into that build.

597
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,329
Sprint in there and just run until I find a fire or sneak around.

598
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,440
You think it's run?

599
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,920
I think it's sneak.

600
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,360
I'm going to wait till his back turns, but I can't run sneak because people hear it.

601
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,599
When he goes this way, we're going to go that way.

602
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,250
One, two, three.

603
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:37,750
Let's kill him.

604
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:41,739
Excuse me?

605
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:43,820
What?

606
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,579
You got to be kidding me.

607
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:46,539
How did he fucking hear me?

608
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,659
Just give me whatever's in your house quick.

609
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:02,460
Oh, fire.

610
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,179
Is there fire in here?

611
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:04,969
I need a fire.

612
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:14,630
Thank God he de-aggroed.

613
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,429
I need a fire.

614
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,989
Come on.

615
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:19,030
I'm so far down here.

616
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,909
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.

617
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:27,610
Fire in here?

618
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:31,980
Damn it.

619
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,880
Fireplace?

620
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:55,420
No, that's not what I'm saying.

621
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:00,219
I swear to God, if one of these birds drops a fucking grenade on me, I'm going to be so mad.

622
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,750
Where the hell am I?

623
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,469
Wait, what?

624
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:07,190
I went around.

625
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,309
Wait, where am I in a circle?

626
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:15,179
Wait, hold on a second.

627
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:16,460
I had to have missed one.

628
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:21,940
Maybe this one down over here?

629
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,340
I don't have enough to...

630
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,139
I don't have enough to...

631
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:27,739
I'm scared to attack that guy.

632
00:42:27,739 --> 00:42:30,579
There's a chest over there, too.

633
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:35,849
Teleport?

634
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:40,250
Yeah, but I swear there's probably one right here somewhere.

635
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,949
Like, right...

636
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:43,829
Okay, look at this.

637
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:44,630
Like, where...

638
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,309
This spot, this one, probably right here.

639
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:50,730
Shit.

640
00:42:50,730 --> 00:43:01,079
All right, well, at least I know it's not safe.

641
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:04,280
Okay, so let me...

642
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,079
If I go from this fire that's up here, I can just kind of...

643
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,599
I'll do skip.

644
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:10,840
I'll do castle skip, right?

645
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,800
Which will put me right here.

646
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,909
Yeah, and then I can level up once or twice as well.

647
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,059
Yeah, because castle skip puts me right here.

648
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:22,599
Wait a minute.

649
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,460
Where am I?

650
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:33,750
Yeah.

651
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:34,630
Why do I not heal?

652
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,309
I don't have any flasks left.

653
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,219
Okay, let me level up.

654
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,260
I have a lot of those crunchies, so...

655
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,019
I got plenty of crunchies.

656
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:53,500
I have a lot of crunchies.

657
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,219
Wait, that's wrong.

658
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,260
Here they are.

659
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:57,400
Yeah, let's use it.

660
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:00,730
I have not been using the crunchies.

661
00:44:01,369 --> 00:44:05,769
What do I need?

662
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,070
3,600.

663
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:19,079
I think I have a big one.

664
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,679
Gain ruins.

665
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:21,639
All right, let's take this one.

666
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,210
All right, that'll get me to 3,900.

667
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,090
What do I need after that?

668
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,219
Either intelligence or endurance.

669
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:45,500
How are you liking Soulcalibur?

670
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,019
It's pretty good.

671
00:44:51,139 --> 00:44:53,619
What is, in your opinion, the most clusterfuck of a stream you've ever done?

672
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:55,619
The family dinner stream, without a doubt.

673
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:00,500
Strength.

674
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,699
I don't really want to do strength until I need it,

675
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:06,539
but I probably will soon here, right?

676
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,559
I imagine that very soon, even a deck scaling weapon,

677
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:13,639
I'm gonna have to have at least probably 12 to 15 strength.

678
00:45:19,769 --> 00:45:20,650
And it's cheap now.

679
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:27,769
But I think I want some more endurance.

680
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:34,250
I'll get intelligence to 18.

681
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,309
And then...

682
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,230
Actually, I might be able to do it right now.

683
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:43,420
Yeah, I definitely will.

684
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,500
Yeah, this is gonna get me to at least probably 3 or 4,000.

685
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:50,119
Shit.

686
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:50,840
Okay, it's all right.

687
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:54,179
All right, so now from here, I gotta do...

688
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:55,380
Wait, how much is this one?

689
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:55,860
None.

690
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,570
All right, so here we are.

691
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,650
So right there, I just do castle skip.

692
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,090
Right here, and I'm back to where I was.

693
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:09,030
Holy shit, that was almost a disaster.

694
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,789
Okay, so now we go this way.

695
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,769
And this is exactly where I just was.

696
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:19,929
So now I'm in a better position.

697
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,489
Let's do some exploration.

698
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:25,449
But first, I want to go down here because there's an item down here.

699
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:26,940
Where was it?

700
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:28,809
It was...

701
00:46:28,809 --> 00:46:29,369
Where was it?

702
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,090
I asked a question.

703
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,300
You don't even have 5 seconds to respond.

704
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:42,820
Okay, here we go.

705
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,820
I'm gonna go in here and kill this guy,

706
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,849
because I have to be a video game player.

707
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,960
And these guys are hard to play against.

708
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:53,079
I need to play...

709
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:53,880
Here it is, right here.

710
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,329
I gotta kill this guy.

711
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:57,769
There's no...

712
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,070
Are we gonna cheese him?

713
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:22,900
Ah!

714
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,300
Dude, fuck.

715
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:25,619
God.

716
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:31,530
I hate these like long-winded swings.

717
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:36,889
When somebody swings a weapon at you,

718
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:38,969
and normally, it's just like, here it comes, right?

719
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,860
Well, when they do these little like crow hop moves,

720
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,900
where they're like, here it comes.

721
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,119
And then I'm doing it.

722
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:57,960
Oh, and by the way, it's gonna be a 360 degree tornado spin too.

723
00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:00,730
Don't miss this jump, please.

724
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:00,969
Okay.

725
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,710
That was 3,000 souls I would have lost.

726
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,269
I'm fine.

727
00:48:05,269 --> 00:48:10,489
Everybody relax.

728
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:12,090
You're calling this guy the fuck out, man.

729
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:14,889
He's like a streamer?

730
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,780
Yeah, I mean, it's like fucking bullshit.

731
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,460
The guy like does these dumb shitty tactics

732
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,219
when he plays PvP, and it's annoying.

733
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:23,579
Like, what do you mean, calling him out?

734
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,369
He definitely saw that.

735
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,530
I need to get a backstab on him.

736
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,880
And I should have had it the first time,

737
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,880
but I apparently didn't for some reason.

738
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,739
He turns back around this way.

739
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:58,860
Yeah, he walks back this way.

740
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,500
Okay, here we go.

741
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,420
I'm gonna get the backstab, and I'm gonna kick his ass.

742
00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:19,050
You see how long that move was?

743
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:32,280
What the fuck has happened?

744
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,199
That was crazy.

745
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:40,329
Where did my souls go?

746
00:49:41,989 --> 00:49:42,550
Hey, wait.

747
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:46,340
Didn't I have like 3,000?

748
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,389
What happened to them?

749
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:54,360
You picked them up.

750
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,039
Yeah, but I thought I had like already had 2,900.

751
00:49:58,039 --> 00:49:59,880
And you have 3k.

752
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,760
Why are some of them gone?

753
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,900
It's the cheese tax.

754
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:12,300
I think you still lose some when you die, do you?

755
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:12,780
That's new.

756
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:19,769
Wait, I swear to God, I thought I had like 2,800 or something.

757
00:50:20,409 --> 00:50:23,530
After killing that guy, I don't know.

758
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:23,929
That's weird.

759
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:25,210
Oh, you map.

760
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,500
It was the cheese tax.

761
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,269
Okay, so there's got to be a way to go from here over there.

762
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,019
Yeah.

763
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:44,260
I mean, it's not that way because that's where the...

764
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:44,980
I don't want to fight this guy.

765
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:45,380
I don't care.

766
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,480
Where was that door?

767
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:51,000
Really?

768
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:59,050
Cheese tax.

769
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,219
That's actually really funny.

770
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,030
All right, this is where I wanted to go.

771
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:11,380
Pretty sick.

772
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,460
Cheese stacks?

773
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,099
Cheese tax.

774
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:27,269
Okay, got to be ready for anything.

775
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:34,980
Lump of flesh.

776
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:38,550
Wrist Lids Memento.

777
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,030
It's a key.

778
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,030
And a golden rune.

779
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,269
Okay.

780
00:51:41,909 --> 00:51:43,340
I actually picked up a bunch of items.

781
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,059
I need to look what they do.

782
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:51,269
That's up there.

783
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:52,070
This is just the other room.

784
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,269
What?

785
00:51:57,269 --> 00:51:57,590
Really?

786
00:51:58,309 --> 00:52:01,539
Elevator.

787
00:52:02,659 --> 00:52:10,710
I'm not going to get away with the cheese for long.

788
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,269
No, I know.

789
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:11,590
I know.

790
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:15,369
All right, so that...

791
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:16,650
This is...

792
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:18,889
Goes up here.

793
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,409
Okay, so now I'm...

794
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:26,489
This is like a weird skip.

795
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:27,130
What though?

796
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,570
This is the tower.

797
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:35,159
Tower's right here.

798
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,119
Where is this in regards to where I am right now?

799
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,559
Oh, nice.

800
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:48,809
Still need a little bit more.

801
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:49,449
I did get a rune.

802
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,969
This is a golden rune.

803
00:52:55,530 --> 00:53:01,739
Still need more.

804
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,340
Let's just kill this guy and get his...

805
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,179
So I know I keep saying souls, but whatever.

806
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,539
All right, so that's actually really helpful.

807
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,460
Wait, I got a key item.

808
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:36,010
When I have a second to pause,

809
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:37,210
I'm going to take a look at it.

810
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:45,139
What is that for?

811
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:54,420
Roach wrapped in red velvet.

812
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:58,389
Cementa left by the chrysalid sacrifice for grafting.

813
00:53:58,389 --> 00:53:59,829
A brooch wrapped in red velvet.

814
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:00,869
Traces of blood are visible.

815
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:04,070
faintly visible spirits try to convey something,

816
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,670
but their voices cannot be heard.

817
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,630
Key item.

818
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,150
Small withered bag knitted by hand.

819
00:54:14,869 --> 00:54:15,510
Oh, okay.

820
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:17,980
Where does that go?

821
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:28,519
Okay.

822
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:33,849
Oh, progress I think is out this way, right?

823
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:36,599
No.

824
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,380
Progress is...

825
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,139
Where is progress?

826
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:46,739
Not over here.

827
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,980
I gotta go back up.

828
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:58,460
Yeah, I haven't gone up this way.

829
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,659
All right, progress is this way.

830
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:11,179
Did I go up this?

831
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:11,900
Did I go over here?

832
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,550
He's senile.

833
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,650
Yeah, it's this way, okay.

834
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,969
All right, there's that scary guy with the axe again.

835
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:26,659
I think I just...

836
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:39,659
Wait, is this openable with that thing?

837
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:49,800
Oh, this guy sucks.

838
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,179
I'm just running.

839
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:53,500
Fuck it.

840
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,780
Actually, I could probably get by him.

841
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,739
I don't want to fight this guy again.

842
00:55:58,739 --> 00:55:59,219
He's annoying.

843
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,280
He BMs.

844
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,079
He's a BMer.

845
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:03,559
I don't like him.

846
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:06,099
All right, then...

847
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:08,679
Whoa, I can jump over this.

848
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:11,940
Okay.

849
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:25,940
You should play Elden Ring.

850
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:26,500
Stop.

851
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,059
What are you doing?

852
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:32,500
Don't blow the horn.

853
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:41,190
Okay.

854
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,190
Sound of progress, my friend.

855
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:50,739
Okay.

856
00:56:50,739 --> 00:56:53,610
Hey, hey, remember me?

857
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,869
Yeah, can he hit you through a wall?

858
00:56:58,789 --> 00:57:00,309
Or should I hope not?

859
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,550
Oh, but there's something down there.

860
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:16,619
There's a lot of stuff down here.

861
00:57:19,429 --> 00:57:21,510
This is the front door to the castle,

862
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,869
but I was never able to get up there.

863
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:27,539
Yeah, I see the ladder here, but...

864
00:57:27,539 --> 00:57:28,980
I mean, look, there's items.

865
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,019
There's stuff on the ground.

866
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:32,070
One, two...

867
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:33,750
Maybe I can go through...

868
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:35,369
Let me see if there's...

869
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,730
Okay, there's a ladder there.

870
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:37,769
Ah, just stuff I missed.

871
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,340
Ah, fuck it.

872
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:39,659
Whatever.

873
00:57:41,269 --> 00:57:42,309
Guy, I see the ladder.

874
00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:43,030
I see the ladder.

875
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:43,510
Don't worry.

876
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,619
Tree's going to be a boss.

877
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,329
Just calling it now.

878
00:57:50,889 --> 00:57:56,039
Okay.

879
00:57:56,039 --> 00:58:01,800
A weird spot.

880
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,599
Let me see what's over here.

881
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:10,170
A lot of nothing.

882
00:58:10,809 --> 00:58:16,090
I can go that way.

883
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,150
Let me drop down there.

884
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:24,730
See what the heck's going on over there.

885
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:30,039
Yeah, let me see what the heck's going on here.

886
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:40,550
So...

887
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:44,070
Ah, this is the door.

888
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:45,739
Wait.

889
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,230
What a terrible guard.

890
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,019
Are you looking into the wall?

891
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:05,940
Like, if you're aiming this way?

892
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,219
What are you doing?

893
00:59:07,219 --> 00:59:08,099
He was AFK.

894
00:59:12,329 --> 00:59:13,289
Pickled turtleneck?

895
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,659
Why do I feel like that's like a TikTok

896
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:18,860
or like an Instagram trend?

897
00:59:20,059 --> 00:59:21,099
Pickling your clothing.

898
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:23,880
Yeah, we see.

899
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,239
I pickled it for about six months

900
00:59:25,239 --> 00:59:27,559
and it came out and it actually looks a lot better.

901
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:28,920
I like the design that came out with it.

902
00:59:31,289 --> 00:59:31,530
Nice.

903
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,059
Boomer moment.

904
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:45,179
Why, because I said TikTok.

905
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,579
So I said TikTok.

906
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,139
I like that I said TikTok.

907
00:59:57,929 --> 00:59:59,130
You should, you should, you should.

908
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:00,250
Yeah, you should do the orangutan.

909
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,760
Okay, so that got me the key,

910
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,599
which now I just got to run around,

911
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:08,599
which there's the door that led to here.

912
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:11,800
That guy, that guy was just resting.

913
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,039
Yep.

914
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,630
I think I have to go back up though.

915
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,809
This is no way to go the other way

916
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:17,769
unless I can go this way.

917
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:23,159
Which I don't think I can.

918
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:29,530
Um, anything on the chandeliers?

919
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:30,010
No.

920
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:30,809
No, we just got to go back.

921
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:35,460
Back up, dude.

922
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,820
Dude, just go full magic build.

923
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,070
No, I don't, I'm not going to go full magic.

924
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,239
Okay, well, I just need to go.

925
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:45,960
Where am I going here?

926
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,079
Over here, right?

927
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:49,500
Whatever, I'm just going this way.

928
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:56,059
Where's the, where the hell am I?

929
01:00:56,059 --> 01:01:01,030
I need to get back up to where I was.

930
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,190
Wait, what?

931
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:07,480
Getting confused.

932
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,889
Uh, I should actually start putting markers

933
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:14,440
down or just kind of traveling around

934
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,320
and walking around because

935
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:17,780
kind of go around in circles sometimes

936
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:18,900
and you're just like, wait, where the fuck am I?

937
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,500
Okay, yeah.

938
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,539
And then over this way.

939
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:32,780
Yep.

940
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:40,440
What about your notes?

941
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:43,559
Um, I think notes are for like important things

942
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:44,599
that I have to remember.

943
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,679
Not necessarily about direction.

944
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:51,320
So this is going up here.

945
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,480
So now just climb back up.

946
01:01:56,599 --> 01:01:57,239
Climb up here.

947
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,000
I almost have enough to do the...

948
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:02,360
I feel like I'm going to find another fire though.

949
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,000
Like almost immediately, like very soon here.

950
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,909
That's what's getting me down there.

951
01:02:07,909 --> 01:02:09,989
All right, I am convinced

952
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:11,909
that there is going to be a fire here soon.

953
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:16,469
So I'm just going to keep going.

954
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:21,639
I just, just jump down here.

955
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:26,659
I just go down here.

956
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:27,699
I think I'm just going to go down here.

957
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:32,139
Use the key.

958
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:32,860
I think I need to.

959
01:02:33,579 --> 01:02:34,699
I think I'm just going down here.

960
01:02:37,699 --> 01:02:39,059
Like what, like whatever, right?

961
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:41,699
Like should I, I can go from here to there?

962
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:43,619
No, I just jump from here to there.

963
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:47,769
I feel like I'm going to die.

964
01:02:48,409 --> 01:02:55,219
Don't break your hip.

965
01:02:55,219 --> 01:02:55,780
Don't do it.

966
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:56,980
It could be fall damage.

967
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,019
Use the ladder instead.

968
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:02,980
Um, what's over here?

969
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:07,800
Can I not go over there?

970
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:13,239
It looks like I can jump over there

971
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:13,800
and go that way.

972
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:17,980
Use the ladder.

973
01:03:18,619 --> 01:03:19,820
I'll go back down.

974
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:20,940
Maybe that's actually death.

975
01:03:21,659 --> 01:03:29,000
But from here, I'm trying to think of where that guy can go.

976
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:32,019
I could go this way, jump down here,

977
01:03:32,019 --> 01:03:32,820
and then go over there.

978
01:03:33,699 --> 01:03:34,260
I do that?

979
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,500
I'm just going to do it.

980
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:42,059
I think, I think I'm doing it.

981
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:42,940
I'm just going to go that way.

982
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:56,869
Okay. Um, I'm here.

983
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:58,389
I might as well get the items.

984
01:03:58,389 --> 01:04:00,389
There are a couple.

985
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:09,420
Ooh, that's good.

986
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,360
All right, I'm going to go that way

987
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,079
and jump over now.

988
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:21,190
Did you get the cat item?

989
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,630
I don't, I don't think so.

990
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:33,960
Arrows.

991
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:34,519
All right.

992
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:35,559
This is where it gets weird.

993
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:46,409
I think that's the, that's where I got to go.

994
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:48,250
Or down there.

995
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:54,579
Please tell me there's a fire here.

996
01:04:54,579 --> 01:04:57,500
I feel like I've gone a pretty long ways without one.

997
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,599
Wait, shit.

998
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:01,400
I can go down here.

999
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:02,599
I can also.

1000
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:09,110
Now that's just kind of where I was before the main gate, right?

1001
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,619
Festering bloody finger.

1002
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:25,079
Okay, I can't.

1003
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:26,440
This is going to be very tricky.

1004
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,519
I have to just be a gamer here.

1005
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:38,469
If I can just pull one, that would be great

1006
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:41,820
because I don't want to fight them both at the same time.

1007
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,500
I hope they don't aggro at the same time.

1008
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,539
So we're just going to go for it.

1009
01:05:45,099 --> 01:06:05,110
The slow fucking attacks kill me every time.

1010
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:06,230
They're so slow.

1011
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,619
I just, they're like, oh, two seconds.

1012
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:14,420
I just think it's going to happen way sooner than it does.

1013
01:06:17,989 --> 01:06:19,349
Everybody's so slow in this game.

1014
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:20,789
Everybody takes forever to swing.

1015
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,460
Fuck.

1016
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:32,780
At least I have the skill.

1017
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:39,179
That's copium.

1018
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:40,860
Yeah, it is copium.

1019
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:43,179
And I'm going to suck it and smell it.

1020
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:44,699
Whatever that, you know what I mean?

1021
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,019
Copium, you like, you like, you suck it.

1022
01:06:57,019 --> 01:06:58,300
You like an hit, right?

1023
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:06,980
Again, like, like I fought that last boss in Elden Ring.

1024
01:07:07,619 --> 01:07:10,980
Wait a full, another full second before you dodge

1025
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,980
with every single enemy in the entire game.

1026
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,360
Everybody's weapons are apparently so heavy in this game

1027
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,079
that it gives them five full seconds to fucking swing them.

1028
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:23,909
Uly noted.

1029
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:35,579
Back over here, right?

1030
01:07:35,579 --> 01:07:36,300
Yeah.

1031
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:40,889
You lost a bunch of souls.

1032
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:41,769
I didn't lose them yet.

1033
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:43,780
Go get them.

1034
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:49,639
So I, well, just stay down there.

1035
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:49,960
I don't care.

1036
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:02,570
Deep slurping copium?

1037
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:06,250
What does that mean?

1038
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,079
Turn it on high.

1039
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:17,109
Sir, I don't think you should turn it on high.

1040
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:19,510
Turn it, turn it on as high as it goes.

1041
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,560
I don't know.

1042
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,840
I think that's kind of dangerous.

1043
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,920
I said to do something that means you do it.

1044
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,399
I'm king.

1045
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:25,800
King.

1046
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:35,880
Too much.

1047
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:46,500
Raid song.

1048
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,619
Oh, here we go.

1049
01:08:47,619 --> 01:08:48,260
We got a raid.

1050
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,680
Too much copium.

1051
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:56,819
I feel the need to defend every single Marvel movie

1052
01:08:56,819 --> 01:09:00,329
and Marvel TV show ever made.

1053
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:02,890
Even dating back to the fucking 90s.

1054
01:09:03,609 --> 01:09:06,890
Thanks, RT.

1055
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:09,130
Appreciate the raid.

1056
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,260
We're doing Elden Ring.

1057
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,260
Are you playing Elden Ring too?

1058
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:28,069
Oh man, people just came in inhaling copium.

1059
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,640
You don't understand.

1060
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,199
I think X-Men Wolverine Origins

1061
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,359
actually was a pretty good movie.

1062
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,439
It was actually very well made

1063
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:44,600
and the cinematography was actually pretty good.

1064
01:09:46,739 --> 01:09:48,579
King German, what the fuck are you talking about?

1065
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:52,699
It's like 1400.

1066
01:09:52,699 --> 01:09:53,979
Why are you saying these things?

1067
01:09:58,199 --> 01:10:00,600
2006 was four years ago.

1068
01:10:03,109 --> 01:10:04,470
Well, thanks for the raid, dude.

1069
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:05,270
Welcome.

1070
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,439
Hope you're doing good.

1071
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:10,380
I currently just was very upset at this game

1072
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,699
because I found it to be not cool and not fun

1073
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,500
and very not hog champ.

1074
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:17,670
All right, I gotta pay attention.

1075
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:18,390
I gotta figure out where I'm going.

1076
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:20,899
Where am I going?

1077
01:10:20,899 --> 01:10:27,220
The idea is back to...

1078
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:28,979
This is why I need the fucking marker.

1079
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:34,359
It was down the ladder and then where?

1080
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:35,560
It was like right here somewhere, right?

1081
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,680
I thought I dropped down, right?

1082
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:40,229
I went right here.

1083
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:43,930
Maybe I can hit something

1084
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:45,050
so I don't get to take damage,

1085
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:45,930
but I don't think I can.

1086
01:10:46,489 --> 01:10:47,289
Did that work?

1087
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:48,739
No.

1088
01:10:48,739 --> 01:10:50,260
All right, no more copium.

1089
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,579
No more bullshit.

1090
01:10:52,579 --> 01:10:53,779
Just go get this guy.

1091
01:10:56,949 --> 01:10:58,470
The slow swings.

1092
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:59,189
Just get ready.

1093
01:11:00,069 --> 01:11:01,510
I know it's going to make me very mad

1094
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:02,869
and you're all going to laugh.

1095
01:11:02,869 --> 01:11:05,510
Everyone's going to laugh at me when I lose again.

1096
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:38,199
Oh, that's bad.

1097
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,640
That's fucking bad.

1098
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:47,210
Wait, it's climbing the ladder.

1099
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,060
Guys, what?

1100
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:52,100
Come on.

1101
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:54,840
Get away from me.

1102
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,119
You don't climb ladders.

1103
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:06,600
Shit.

1104
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:31,479
I was fully prepared to do that again.

1105
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:36,420
Where is he?

1106
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:40,970
Oh, it's a fucking thing, the drape.

1107
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:43,850
I thought like a tentacle came down and grabbed me.

1108
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:48,779
Dude, why?

1109
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:50,859
Now I'm like I'm all cracked out now.

1110
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:52,619
Holy shit.

1111
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:57,529
I am cracked up right now after that.

1112
01:12:57,529 --> 01:12:58,409
Are you kidding me?

1113
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:01,479
That's so violent.

1114
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:03,880
That moved around so weirdly and violently.

1115
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:10,380
I think I can get him before he comes over here.

1116
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:11,579
All right.

1117
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:28,470
I'm definitely losing souls because I had like 4,000.

1118
01:13:33,939 --> 01:13:34,500
Copium.

1119
01:13:39,159 --> 01:13:40,680
He's coping in advance.

1120
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,840
Yeah, I was because if I died,

1121
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,479
you were about to hear a lot of bullshit.

1122
01:13:45,479 --> 01:13:47,319
Okay, I was going to talk a bunch of shit.

1123
01:13:49,819 --> 01:13:53,899
You wouldn't be able to escape it unless you of course hit the X and left

1124
01:13:53,899 --> 01:13:55,100
because you didn't want to listen to it.

1125
01:13:55,899 --> 01:14:00,279
All right, but I'm still not out of this yet.

1126
01:14:00,279 --> 01:14:05,979
I'm kind of fucked right now because unless I...

1127
01:14:06,619 --> 01:14:07,739
Okay, that guy's going to shoot me.

1128
01:14:11,189 --> 01:14:13,109
Oh, no, he's going to shoot me with that.

1129
01:14:13,109 --> 01:14:13,750
It's going to hit me.

1130
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:18,810
No, don't get up.

1131
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:19,130
Don't get up.

1132
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:31,420
Don't get up.

1133
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:32,779
This fucking horse shit.

1134
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:36,439
There's always a guy sitting down somewhere

1135
01:14:37,449 --> 01:14:40,329
who slowly gets up after you attack the one guy that you see.

1136
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:42,949
Oh, I'm insane.

1137
01:14:42,949 --> 01:14:43,670
I got to run by it.

1138
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:49,739
I'm just running by all these fucking turds.

1139
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:55,220
Here comes the cheese tax.

1140
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,060
There is no cheese tax, but it's called

1141
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:01,859
I'm running by everybody and hopefully I don't die in the process and lose four thousands.

1142
01:15:02,819 --> 01:15:04,220
Whatever they are.

1143
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:09,420
If you were in a souls game, what kind of creature would you be?

1144
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,739
Definitely one of the ones that goes like this.

1145
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:17,770
You know what I mean?

1146
01:15:22,699 --> 01:15:23,500
I didn't want to do it.

1147
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:27,100
I really didn't want to do it because I didn't want to like hurt everybody's ears.

1148
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:36,180
And my move set would definitely be the one of the ones that goes like making that sound

1149
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:41,779
and then going and then falling down.

1150
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:54,729
And then you just you kill me in three hits back up.

1151
01:15:55,449 --> 01:15:59,819
I'm going to just try to get over there and run and just pick up my souls at least.

1152
01:16:00,619 --> 01:16:02,859
And this if I die here.

1153
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:05,659
Oh, I'm going to be upset, but let me just be not stupid about this.

1154
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:09,029
Selectively kill people that need to just knock him down.

1155
01:16:09,029 --> 01:16:09,590
Okay, just go.

1156
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:12,789
Where is he at?

1157
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,439
Pretty bad.

1158
01:16:23,029 --> 01:16:24,310
Okay, we're safe.

1159
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:31,899
It looks like Burger King's.

1160
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,220
It looks like Burger King.

1161
01:16:35,479 --> 01:16:36,119
Sneak King.

1162
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:39,239
You mean I look like the Burger King from Burger King.

1163
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,680
They didn't make him up for Sneak King, although that would be really funny if they did.

1164
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:56,300
Already out of potions.

1165
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:59,739
Okay, so I got to just get over there.

1166
01:16:59,739 --> 01:17:04,199
Ignore everybody and just get the souls and just run.

1167
01:17:05,609 --> 01:17:06,090
It's okay.

1168
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:07,689
That's what you can do that in these games.

1169
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:08,729
It's a decent strategy.

1170
01:17:08,729 --> 01:17:09,289
It really is.

1171
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,960
So they're around the corner.

1172
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,840
I see him right there.

1173
01:17:26,069 --> 01:17:26,630
See ya.

1174
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,319
See ya.

1175
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,569
Where do I go from here?

1176
01:17:32,569 --> 01:17:33,289
There's a lot of.

1177
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,130
Oh, a lot of.

1178
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:37,180
Oh, thank God.

1179
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,739
He hit me with that.

1180
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:40,699
The hitbox.

1181
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:44,619
Somebody fucking 10 miles down the road swung an axe and I got hit by it.

1182
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:45,899
Oh, yeah.

1183
01:17:45,899 --> 01:17:46,699
They're climbing.

1184
01:17:46,699 --> 01:17:47,340
They're climbing.

1185
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:47,899
They're climbing.

1186
01:17:47,899 --> 01:17:48,380
They're climbing.

1187
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:48,939
They're climbing.

1188
01:17:48,939 --> 01:17:50,220
They're climbing up right now.

1189
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:51,260
They're right behind me.

1190
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:52,140
They're right behind me.

1191
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:53,260
They're right behind me, I think.

1192
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:54,220
They're right behind me.

1193
01:17:54,939 --> 01:17:56,600
I got a cookbook.

1194
01:17:59,779 --> 01:18:00,659
I escaped.

1195
01:18:00,659 --> 01:18:01,140
Where am I?

1196
01:18:01,699 --> 01:18:05,609
Where am I?

1197
01:18:05,609 --> 01:18:10,329
Almost fell down that hole.

1198
01:18:10,329 --> 01:18:11,050
That would have been horrible.

1199
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,279
Do I need to go there?

1200
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:18,460
Yeah, they're taking souls away.

1201
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:23,460
That's new.

1202
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,060
That's not in any of the other games.

1203
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:26,659
They're literally it's a tax.

1204
01:18:26,659 --> 01:18:27,619
It's a death tax.

1205
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,369
It's like 30 percent.

1206
01:18:41,369 --> 01:18:42,170
Yeah, that's new.

1207
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:43,989
All right.

1208
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:46,069
Did I miss anything over here?

1209
01:18:46,069 --> 01:18:48,789
I'm afraid to try to make this jump, actually, if I'm honest.

1210
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,869
Otherwise, I'm fucking dead meat.

1211
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:54,949
So do I drop down here and just spam at this guy?

1212
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:01,829
Yeah, right.

1213
01:19:02,949 --> 01:19:03,829
Yeah, right.

1214
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:06,149
Un-fucking-believable, dude.

1215
01:19:06,149 --> 01:19:07,829
That was almost a disaster.

1216
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:10,119
You got to be kidding me.

1217
01:19:12,619 --> 01:19:13,659
It's going to hit me through the floor.

1218
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:35,770
Please don't have anybody in this room.

1219
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:39,739
Wooden great shield.

1220
01:19:39,739 --> 01:19:50,250
I could go that on my end.

1221
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,050
That's a big person.

1222
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:52,729
I could go that way.

1223
01:19:53,609 --> 01:19:54,890
I could try to go that way.

1224
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:55,850
Let me see what's over here.

1225
01:19:56,489 --> 01:19:58,329
I need a better weapon.

1226
01:19:58,329 --> 01:19:59,689
I need to upgrade a weapon.

1227
01:20:00,489 --> 01:20:01,850
I actually did pick up a weapon.

1228
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:03,210
I forget what it was, but hold on.

1229
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:03,689
Let me see.

1230
01:20:04,489 --> 01:20:06,520
Or anything here that I need to look at.

1231
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,039
All right.

1232
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:08,760
I'm going over there.

1233
01:20:09,909 --> 01:20:15,979
There's also that wolf with the sword enemy thing that I could probably go kill.

1234
01:20:16,539 --> 01:20:18,359
Did they get a new axe?

1235
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:18,600
Yeah.

1236
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:37,800
Um, I don't know.

1237
01:20:38,359 --> 01:20:40,039
I'm not sure where to go.

1238
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:45,000
Need to call the boys?

1239
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:49,590
That's actually not a bad idea.

1240
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:53,899
If I don't need to aggro this...

1241
01:20:53,899 --> 01:20:55,739
There's a dog right there.

1242
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:56,939
Oh my god.

1243
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:04,699
All right.

1244
01:21:04,699 --> 01:21:07,340
In that door or up in that door?

1245
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:10,890
I don't know.

1246
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:13,529
I think before I do this, I think I have to consult with the boys.

1247
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:16,569
All right.

1248
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:17,850
Here's the plan.

1249
01:21:18,489 --> 01:21:20,649
We have an opportunity to go up

1250
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:21,770
or we have to...

1251
01:21:22,409 --> 01:21:23,770
I hear somebody moving.

1252
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:24,010
Okay.

1253
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:24,489
No, I don't.

1254
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,680
We have an opportunity, boys.

1255
01:21:27,399 --> 01:21:28,229
Let's go.

1256
01:21:28,869 --> 01:21:33,220
What's that?

1257
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:33,619
I don't know.

1258
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:38,310
Boys, no.

1259
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:38,550
No.

1260
01:21:39,109 --> 01:21:40,229
Don't attack people.

1261
01:21:40,789 --> 01:21:44,739
Um, bonfire.

1262
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:45,699
Bonfire.

1263
01:21:46,579 --> 01:21:47,539
Nice job, boys.

1264
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,020
We did it.

1265
01:21:49,659 --> 01:21:51,539
We attacked like a boss.

1266
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:53,060
All right.

1267
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:53,539
Let's go.

1268
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:55,510
Hell yeah.

1269
01:21:55,510 --> 01:22:02,500
The boys are the fucking worst.

1270
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:10,310
They're so awful.

1271
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:10,789
Okay.

1272
01:22:10,789 --> 01:22:11,670
So what are we doing here?

1273
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:13,750
Probably another point into...

1274
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:21,289
Do I want more endurance?

1275
01:22:22,329 --> 01:22:22,890
I think so.

1276
01:22:23,449 --> 01:22:24,729
Either endurance or intelligence.

1277
01:22:24,729 --> 01:22:25,850
No, get intelligence to 18.

1278
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,619
So, very important.

1279
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:37,300
Let's go kill this fucking guy.

1280
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:39,670
Why not?

1281
01:22:52,819 --> 01:22:54,500
I'm trying to go up the goddamn stairs.

1282
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:59,479
You just hit your own dog.

1283
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:31,640
I didn't get the backstab.

1284
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:31,880
Shit.

1285
01:23:32,439 --> 01:24:15,609
Fuck you.

1286
01:24:15,609 --> 01:24:16,810
Oh, there's an animal up here.

1287
01:24:17,609 --> 01:24:19,130
He's trying to kick me down the stairs.

1288
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:25,689
Oh, there's no juice in this thing.

1289
01:24:26,329 --> 01:24:41,800
What are you worrying about in your head?

1290
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:42,840
Is that a pumpkin?

1291
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:43,079
All right.

1292
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:48,140
Well, that guy's gone.

1293
01:24:50,149 --> 01:24:50,550
He was...

1294
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:51,829
There's something where he was standing.

1295
01:24:51,829 --> 01:24:52,310
What is this?

1296
01:24:52,869 --> 01:24:56,039
What is that?

1297
01:24:56,039 --> 01:24:57,500
Can I break this or something?

1298
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:00,119
It's like a weird thing to have here.

1299
01:25:00,119 --> 01:25:00,520
What is this?

1300
01:25:01,239 --> 01:25:13,850
Start using one-liners when you get kills.

1301
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:14,409
Nope.

1302
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:15,609
I'm not going to do that because...

1303
01:25:18,939 --> 01:25:19,899
Um, what is this?

1304
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:25,880
Prophecy painting.

1305
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:28,810
Prophecy painting.

1306
01:25:43,189 --> 01:25:44,550
Prophecy painting.

1307
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:47,510
Reminisce of the painting prophecy.

1308
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:48,869
Examine it using square.

1309
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:52,460
I'm afraid to touch this.

1310
01:25:53,340 --> 01:26:01,449
Square X whatever.

1311
01:26:02,409 --> 01:26:03,770
I actually don't think I want to do that.

1312
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:04,970
I'm kind of scared to press that button.

1313
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:08,310
What if it like sucks me into a new world or something?

1314
01:26:17,850 --> 01:26:19,289
We're watching you in a bar, German.

1315
01:26:19,289 --> 01:26:20,090
Do something wacky.

1316
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:21,449
Hey.

1317
01:26:24,409 --> 01:26:27,689
Hey, this one goes out to all y'all in the bar.

1318
01:26:28,979 --> 01:26:29,220
Hey.

1319
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:30,409
Three.

1320
01:26:30,970 --> 01:26:31,210
Two.

1321
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:32,170
One.

1322
01:26:32,170 --> 01:26:32,649
Let's go.

1323
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:37,239
Mmm.

1324
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:37,880
Green tea.

1325
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:42,310
Hey, what are you drinking?

1326
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:45,189
Hey, dude, what are you drinking?

1327
01:26:45,189 --> 01:26:47,510
Oh, it's a vodka pineapple with a little bit of cranberry.

1328
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:50,149
What are you drinking?

1329
01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:50,869
Hey.

1330
01:26:50,869 --> 01:26:52,600
Hey, what are you drinking?

1331
01:26:53,159 --> 01:26:54,569
What do you got?

1332
01:26:54,569 --> 01:26:56,710
What are you drinking?

1333
01:26:56,710 --> 01:26:57,109
A beer?

1334
01:26:57,109 --> 01:26:57,510
Oh, cool.

1335
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:58,630
What kind of beer?

1336
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:07,180
Oh, what are you drinking?

1337
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:10,699
Welcome to every conversation you have in a fucking bar.

1338
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:14,819
Oh, can I try that?

1339
01:27:14,819 --> 01:27:15,619
Yeah, let me try.

1340
01:27:17,979 --> 01:27:19,420
Oh, that's like spicy.

1341
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:19,819
What do you got?

1342
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:20,300
What's that one?

1343
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:23,739
Oh, that's called the Dr. Manhattan.

1344
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:24,460
Let me try that.

1345
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:25,500
It's blue and it smells.

1346
01:27:27,989 --> 01:27:28,310
I don't know.

1347
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:28,789
That's not for me.

1348
01:27:28,789 --> 01:27:29,590
I don't like gin.

1349
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:30,069
What do you got?

1350
01:27:30,069 --> 01:27:30,390
Let me see.

1351
01:27:31,109 --> 01:27:35,130
I don't like beer, dude.

1352
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:35,930
I'm not a beer guy.

1353
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:38,600
Anyone want to try mine?

1354
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:40,680
It's fucking sludge.

1355
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,359
I got it from the fucking toilet.

1356
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:42,760
Try it.

1357
01:27:43,560 --> 01:28:00,409
Minus two, play the game.

1358
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:07,699
They said I was on TV in their bar.

1359
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,859
What, you want me to not like say hello?

1360
01:28:09,859 --> 01:28:14,439
There's a door back here.

1361
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,319
This is a shortcut, maybe.

1362
01:28:25,319 --> 01:28:34,329
This looks like it's probably a shortcut to find out.

1363
01:28:34,329 --> 01:28:41,050
How much to have you sing at my wedding?

1364
01:28:43,779 --> 01:28:44,739
Three or four million dollars.

1365
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,239
So, okay.

1366
01:28:55,239 --> 01:28:56,359
I'm not going down there yet.

1367
01:29:01,579 --> 01:29:03,500
Is this the front door?

1368
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,060
It's not.

1369
01:29:04,779 --> 01:29:10,439
But this, I have not been over here.

1370
01:29:10,439 --> 01:29:11,880
That's not the front gate.

1371
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,000
The front gate's down here.

1372
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,920
So, I should probably take a look over here for a minute.

1373
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:27,380
Did I even rest at that stupid bonfire?

1374
01:29:27,939 --> 01:29:36,970
I'm also going to do some allocation here.

1375
01:29:36,970 --> 01:29:39,369
I want to, I need more health.

1376
01:29:39,369 --> 01:29:42,500
How do I like Breath of the Wild so far?

1377
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,779
I never played Breath of the Wild.

1378
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:55,399
I haven't played it.

1379
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:58,140
Sorry.

1380
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:00,340
The bar is real.

1381
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:05,640
Bar video.

1382
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:18,859
What am I doing up here?

1383
01:30:19,659 --> 01:30:20,699
What am I doing up here?

1384
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,319
They can't even hear me.

1385
01:30:26,279 --> 01:30:27,319
Should I try to communicate?

1386
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:38,810
Like, hey, hey, wait, wait, look, look.

1387
01:30:39,699 --> 01:30:40,579
Look over here.

1388
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:44,659
Hey, everybody, everybody, look over here.

1389
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:51,180
Hey, you, wait, look.

1390
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:54,300
Hey, everybody, hey.

1391
01:30:54,939 --> 01:30:59,180
One, two, three.

1392
01:31:03,289 --> 01:31:03,789
Yeah.

1393
01:31:10,630 --> 01:31:15,109
I'm probably, I probably just look like a fucking psycho.

1394
01:31:15,109 --> 01:31:17,270
Nobody's probably watching this TV.

1395
01:31:18,069 --> 01:31:19,670
Nobody's watching this TV.

1396
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:20,710
I don't think anyone is.

1397
01:31:22,729 --> 01:31:24,489
It's going to be so weird looking over there

1398
01:31:24,489 --> 01:31:28,470
and being like, what's going on on the TV over there?

1399
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:31,029
In a lot of bars, TVs are just on.

1400
01:31:31,029 --> 01:31:31,909
Like, I'll be honest.

1401
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:34,789
They're kind of like, they'll be like a basketball game

1402
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:37,989
or like a baseball game or like some talk show.

1403
01:31:37,989 --> 01:31:39,750
Nobody's really paying attention.

1404
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:42,899
Use the notepad to say hi.

1405
01:31:50,180 --> 01:32:00,199
Okay, I'm trying to communicate.

1406
01:32:00,920 --> 01:33:10,630
Okay, I'm going to play the game now.

1407
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:13,109
Somebody was just really mad that I wasn't playing the game.

1408
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:20,500
The funniest part is that nobody is probably looking.

1409
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,819
I just look like a fucking weirdo.

1410
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:27,989
Wait, hold on.

1411
01:33:27,989 --> 01:33:29,109
Is there another one?

1412
01:33:29,109 --> 01:33:34,569
Is it, wait, you took another video?

1413
01:33:34,569 --> 01:33:37,699
We have an update.

1414
01:33:37,699 --> 01:33:46,039
Play the fucking game.

1415
01:33:46,039 --> 01:33:47,640
Hold on, I'm communicating.

1416
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,880
I'm going to be streaming for like 10 hours today.

1417
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:50,520
Don't worry.

1418
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:55,340
Oh, what's your, hold on.

1419
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:56,899
Here it is.

1420
01:33:56,899 --> 01:33:57,399
Update.

1421
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:07,020
People aren't even paying.

1422
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:09,500
I look like such a fucking weirdo.

1423
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,180
Oh my God.

1424
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:12,300
Okay, hold on a second.

1425
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:13,500
This looks so stupid.

1426
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:21,180
Okay, let's watch the, oh, you got to, hold on.

1427
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:29,640
So stupid.

1428
01:34:30,279 --> 01:34:46,630
Play the game.

1429
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:47,430
Hold on a second.

1430
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:56,460
Oh my God, hold on.

1431
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:57,420
I want to be able to show it.

1432
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:00,840
That's so ridiculous.

1433
01:35:01,899 --> 01:35:03,899
Pretend you're stuck in the TV.

1434
01:35:14,859 --> 01:35:16,539
No, guys, you're killing me.

1435
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:18,859
You're killing me.

1436
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:23,420
I need to be able to like see, where is this?

1437
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:24,380
Why did it just disappear?

1438
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,220
I'm like.

1439
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:39,960
Where is it?

1440
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,079
Where is it?

1441
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:44,579
Why did it just like broke?

1442
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:50,489
Why can't I show it?

1443
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:55,210
I'm like.

1444
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,270
I'm like.

1445
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:15,319
I'm like.

1446
01:36:16,619 --> 01:36:17,979
Why is it upside down?

1447
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:30,649
All right, all right, all right.

1448
01:36:30,649 --> 01:36:31,850
I got to move on.

1449
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:33,050
I got to move on.

1450
01:36:35,779 --> 01:36:36,500
I'm moving on.

1451
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:37,220
That's funny.

1452
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:38,260
That's cool.

1453
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:38,899
Hey, I'm cool.

1454
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:39,539
Hey, that's cool.

1455
01:36:39,539 --> 01:36:40,899
You got me on your, in your bar.

1456
01:36:40,899 --> 01:36:41,460
That's pretty cool.

1457
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:44,949
It's a video of the text.

1458
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:46,470
All right.

1459
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:47,350
That's fucking funny.

1460
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:48,470
But I want to play the game.

1461
01:36:49,270 --> 01:37:01,899
You just showed the bar a video of the bar.

1462
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:03,260
All right, I'm moving on.

1463
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:03,979
It's funny.

1464
01:37:03,979 --> 01:37:04,699
It's cool.

1465
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:05,500
It's funny.

1466
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:06,859
I'm happy that I'm on your TV.

1467
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:09,079
But that's it.

1468
01:37:09,079 --> 01:37:09,579
Let's go.

1469
01:37:10,119 --> 01:37:26,939
It's not just a TV, Jerma.

1470
01:37:26,939 --> 01:37:27,439
It is.

1471
01:37:34,069 --> 01:37:35,989
You've infiltrated their reality.

1472
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:42,060
Okay.

1473
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,100
Back to the video game.

1474
01:37:52,579 --> 01:37:53,779
You're stuck.

1475
01:37:53,779 --> 01:37:55,300
No, no, no, no.

1476
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:56,260
It's funny for a minute.

1477
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:57,859
But no, let's, let's, let's, let's move on.

1478
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:06,539
Oh, we hate the video game.

1479
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:12,199
What is all over my mouth?

1480
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:38,920
Oh.

1481
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:47,029
You need to put baby sensorys on.

1482
01:38:47,029 --> 01:38:48,149
No, no, no.

1483
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:54,250
They just got me on their TV and it's fun.

1484
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:54,890
And it's funny.

1485
01:38:55,449 --> 01:38:58,939
I don't want, I don't want to like fuck with them, right?

1486
01:38:58,939 --> 01:39:01,819
Like that's, I'd rather just like kind of end it there.

1487
01:39:06,779 --> 01:39:08,220
It's cool that I'm on the TV though.

1488
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:08,619
It is.

1489
01:39:08,619 --> 01:39:10,220
I find that really, really, that's really sweet.

1490
01:39:10,859 --> 01:39:28,600
Did you ever beat Hollow Knight off stream?

1491
01:39:32,229 --> 01:39:33,909
That's a really interesting question, actually.

1492
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:44,710
No, I didn't.

1493
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:46,949
I really wanted to, but I just didn't find the opportunity to.

1494
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:51,689
All right, let's go this way.

1495
01:39:52,329 --> 01:40:07,430
No, I did not.

1496
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:07,989
What the fuck?

1497
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:22,869
Okay.

1498
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:37,079
How is magic?

1499
01:40:37,079 --> 01:40:37,800
Magic is actually...

1500
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:41,260
Really fun.

1501
01:40:45,189 --> 01:40:45,909
I like it a lot.

1502
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:47,829
I like the combo magic.

1503
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:50,329
Kind of magic plus.

1504
01:40:51,289 --> 01:40:52,899
Oh my gosh.

1505
01:40:52,899 --> 01:40:54,739
That's not what I wanted to do.

1506
01:40:54,739 --> 01:40:55,140
Okay.

1507
01:41:14,149 --> 01:41:16,729
You want to fight with me?

1508
01:41:19,449 --> 01:41:20,170
Is this a summon?

1509
01:41:20,569 --> 01:41:23,449
As fellow tarnished, we must each follow our own guidance.

1510
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:26,970
Down whatever road takes us to the throne of Elden Lord.

1511
01:41:27,529 --> 01:41:30,899
Apologies, as fellow tarnished...

1512
01:41:30,899 --> 01:41:32,579
Okay, so I can summon you for the fight.

1513
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:34,100
Whatever that fight is.

1514
01:41:34,979 --> 01:41:36,659
That was burp.

1515
01:41:37,699 --> 01:41:38,199
Okay.

1516
01:41:50,869 --> 01:41:54,310
I'm imagining that's probably happening very, very soon here.

1517
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:54,949
Very soon.

1518
01:41:59,579 --> 01:42:00,220
Nice.

1519
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:00,779
Another charge.

1520
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:07,159
I haven't been able to use my horse in like six hours of gameplay.

1521
01:42:07,159 --> 01:42:07,659
Damn.

1522
01:42:08,359 --> 01:42:11,789
Okay.

1523
01:42:12,109 --> 01:42:14,640
This looks...

1524
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:16,640
This is gonna be actually pretty bad.

1525
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:18,590
I think I'm gonna go...

1526
01:42:26,319 --> 01:42:28,560
I think I'm gonna upgrade some weapons.

1527
01:42:29,609 --> 01:42:31,369
At least a couple times.

1528
01:42:31,369 --> 01:42:32,250
Or at least...

1529
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:38,359
Because I don't...

1530
01:42:38,359 --> 01:42:40,600
My weapons are all plus one or plus zero.

1531
01:42:41,319 --> 01:42:50,060
I gotta kill the ad.

1532
01:42:56,199 --> 01:42:56,699
Shit.

1533
01:43:04,619 --> 01:43:05,739
Can I backstab?

1534
01:43:06,539 --> 01:43:07,039
I wonder.

1535
01:43:09,369 --> 01:43:11,130
Can I get like on his like leg or something?

1536
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:30,439
This is bad.

1537
01:43:30,439 --> 01:43:32,039
Can't like break his leg?

1538
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,300
Really?

1539
01:43:41,159 --> 01:43:59,520
Ooh, there it is.

1540
01:44:19,449 --> 01:44:25,449
Pain in the ass.

1541
01:44:25,449 --> 01:44:25,949
All right.

1542
01:44:26,569 --> 01:44:27,529
Do I have mana?

1543
01:44:27,529 --> 01:44:28,029
No.

1544
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:30,220
I don't.

1545
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:33,659
This guy sounds like a Scooby-Doo villain.

1546
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:41,840
Ooh, I forgot about that.

1547
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:49,500
The weapon art is actually incredible.

1548
01:44:56,479 --> 01:44:57,199
Uh-oh.

1549
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:03,199
Okay, well that's the boss right there.

1550
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:13,520
Item?

1551
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,800
Well, let me level up one more time.

1552
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,319
I have enough souls almost.

1553
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:18,090
Give me a minute.

1554
01:45:18,090 --> 01:45:19,180
Is a bonfire...

1555
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:20,300
Wait, is a bonfire in there?

1556
01:45:20,939 --> 01:45:23,289
Is there really?

1557
01:45:34,409 --> 01:45:35,609
Oh, okay.

1558
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:50,640
Get over here.

1559
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:54,250
What are these things?

1560
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:54,890
Where am I going?

1561
01:45:56,170 --> 01:46:00,199
Ooh, okay.

1562
01:46:00,199 --> 01:46:00,699
Nice.

1563
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:01,880
I think it's gonna get up.

1564
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,159
So I'm just gonna take this thing away.

1565
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:06,220
Where's this bonfire?

1566
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:13,880
Oh, there it is.

1567
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:14,380
Okay.

1568
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:16,380
Sweet.

1569
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:30,989
How many hours until you're gonna jump attack?

1570
01:46:30,989 --> 01:46:32,670
I'm saying at least probably two or three.

1571
01:46:33,390 --> 01:46:41,180
Shit.

1572
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:41,739
4,200.

1573
01:46:41,739 --> 01:46:44,539
How many, uh, so how many rune, uh, crunchy things do I have?

1574
01:46:45,659 --> 01:46:48,060
One.

1575
01:46:48,439 --> 01:46:52,359
All right, let me, uh, let me just get to...

1576
01:46:53,159 --> 01:46:54,460
I'm gonna kill some of these guys.

1577
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:01,399
Because I definitely want to get to enough.

1578
01:47:02,039 --> 01:47:03,020
So I don't...

1579
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:15,479
I'm gonna die probably 500 times in this boss.

1580
01:47:15,479 --> 01:47:16,119
Hey, hey!

1581
01:47:17,149 --> 01:47:18,189
Settle down.

1582
01:47:18,189 --> 01:47:28,109
Wait, he's jumped up?

1583
01:47:40,430 --> 01:47:44,029
You are so slow like everybody else in this fucking whole universe!

1584
01:47:44,989 --> 01:47:55,199
I'm the developer of this indie game.

1585
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:56,800
I just want to let you know that you really should...

1586
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,300
I...

1587
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:59,840
Okay, I'll try.

1588
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:11,979
Sorcery is so good.

1589
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:18,479
Although, I think actually using like a two-handed weapon would be...

1590
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:23,960
You're still alive.

1591
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:31,119
I just, let me get a few more souls and we'll be good.

1592
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:42,489
Two-handed is pretty good.

1593
01:48:42,489 --> 01:48:45,640
Ooh, what do we have here?

1594
01:48:46,439 --> 01:48:52,939
And I'm gonna put it into, uh, stamina or vitality.

1595
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:57,680
When are you gonna let us have a turn?

1596
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:02,569
Just get it!

1597
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:07,319
All right, fine.

1598
01:49:07,319 --> 01:49:07,960
I will P...

1599
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:11,640
I will PS4 screen share play with you guys.

1600
01:49:12,359 --> 01:49:13,239
But you have to share.

1601
01:49:15,479 --> 01:49:18,270
Where am I going?

1602
01:49:18,270 --> 01:49:23,680
Okay, so this is just right here.

1603
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:26,399
Although, I don't really want to do this right now.

1604
01:49:32,779 --> 01:49:33,739
Just get it, forehead.

1605
01:49:33,739 --> 01:49:34,140
I know.

1606
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:35,180
It's 60 fucking bucks.

1607
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:35,500
I know.

1608
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:40,119
It's not like two dollars, I feel you.

1609
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,600
All right, this is another skip back here.

1610
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:57,659
So, what's the point of that skip?

1611
01:49:57,659 --> 01:49:58,699
It like doesn't really have a...

1612
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:02,590
And does it really have that much of a purpose?

1613
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:04,029
Because there's a bonfire literally right there.

1614
01:50:05,739 --> 01:50:07,020
It's kind of a weird place for that.

1615
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:16,699
Hmm, okay.

1616
01:50:16,699 --> 01:50:19,369
I still need a few more souls.

1617
01:50:19,930 --> 01:50:21,390
Let's fight the boss, the loser.

1618
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:22,029
I don't...

1619
01:50:22,029 --> 01:50:24,189
I'm gonna die to the boss.

1620
01:50:25,710 --> 01:50:28,750
So, I need to get to the souls required to fight this boss and not...

1621
01:50:30,189 --> 01:50:31,630
And not lose all the stuff that I have.

1622
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:42,350
I think that's enough.

1623
01:50:42,350 --> 01:50:42,590
What is it?

1624
01:50:42,590 --> 01:50:43,390
4,600?

1625
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:44,029
4,500?

1626
01:50:44,670 --> 01:50:49,529
And yeah, I have to go upgrade my stuff too.

1627
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:51,850
All right, I'm doing endurance.

1628
01:50:56,430 --> 01:50:57,630
And we're traveling.

1629
01:50:57,630 --> 01:50:59,819
I'm going out of here.

1630
01:51:01,239 --> 01:51:05,119
I'm going to the blacksmith, which is...

1631
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:05,600
Where is the...

1632
01:51:06,399 --> 01:51:07,279
This place, right?

1633
01:51:07,279 --> 01:51:11,079
Yeah, because I have to upgrade something.

1634
01:51:11,079 --> 01:51:12,119
I can't just...

1635
01:51:12,119 --> 01:51:13,000
Plus one.

1636
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:13,479
It's awful.

1637
01:51:14,279 --> 01:51:16,199
It's very bad.

1638
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:22,189
Where is he?

1639
01:51:27,359 --> 01:51:29,359
I got a few new weapons as well.

1640
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:32,000
So, I need to examine what I want to do here.

1641
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,720
Because I actually...

1642
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:36,000
The claws are pretty good.

1643
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:36,960
The claws are fast.

1644
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:43,390
Let's take a look.

1645
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,319
Yeah, I have...

1646
01:51:57,050 --> 01:51:57,609
Why not have?

1647
01:51:57,609 --> 01:51:57,930
There are...

1648
01:51:59,210 --> 01:52:00,329
I'm speaking of runes.

1649
01:52:11,149 --> 01:52:12,909
Well, back to what we were doing.

1650
01:52:12,909 --> 01:52:15,390
I'm going to just go farm for like five seconds.

1651
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:17,149
Just get...

1652
01:52:17,869 --> 01:52:18,270
Wherever.

1653
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:18,829
It doesn't matter.

1654
01:52:20,189 --> 01:52:26,189
I could sell something, but I don't want to.

1655
01:52:26,189 --> 01:52:31,560
I really only need like a few hundred.

1656
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:32,439
How much do these guys give?

1657
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:39,369
All right.

1658
01:52:39,369 --> 01:52:40,729
Yeah, I'm just going to kill like a few things.

1659
01:52:45,210 --> 01:52:56,750
Oh my god.

1660
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:58,109
This guy has to farm.

1661
01:52:58,109 --> 01:52:58,909
He's so bad.

1662
01:52:58,909 --> 01:53:02,590
He can't just play the game as it shows up and progress as it happens.

1663
01:53:04,109 --> 01:53:22,909
Get away from me.

1664
01:53:26,010 --> 01:53:29,579
Okay, that should be enough to upgrade a couple things.

1665
01:53:29,739 --> 01:53:31,020
If I need to sell something, I will.

1666
01:53:31,659 --> 01:53:34,409
Well, thank you for those good meter day subs.

1667
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:35,529
Artemis.

1668
01:53:36,250 --> 01:53:38,140
Of the blue.

1669
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:47,159
I haven't like shouted any subs out in like two weeks.

1670
01:53:50,619 --> 01:53:52,300
I'm very focused on Elden Ring.

1671
01:53:52,939 --> 01:53:58,479
Okay, back to here.

1672
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:06,569
Because he hates us.

1673
01:54:06,569 --> 01:54:06,970
No, I don't.

1674
01:54:07,529 --> 01:54:16,239
Wrong way.

1675
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:34,239
Rodrik is cool as fuck.

1676
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:35,039
I'm hyped for you to see him.

1677
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:39,119
I'm looking forward to it.

1678
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:40,479
I'm very much looking forward to it.

1679
01:54:41,359 --> 01:54:42,109
Okay.

1680
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:50,220
So I've got this dagger, which I don't want to play with daggers.

1681
01:54:50,220 --> 01:54:50,779
It's too hard.

1682
01:54:50,779 --> 01:54:54,380
It literally takes forever to kill anything unless you stab things in the back.

1683
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:59,149
Yes, doc, which is another one of those.

1684
01:54:59,149 --> 01:54:59,869
I don't want to do it.

1685
01:55:02,319 --> 01:55:03,279
Island Axe.

1686
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:07,520
This is D in both and requires 12 strength.

1687
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:13,279
It's probably the claws.

1688
01:55:14,479 --> 01:55:18,859
I have to pick something and I think it's going to be claws.

1689
01:55:20,779 --> 01:55:21,420
You're fast.

1690
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:23,069
Bloodloss is pretty good.

1691
01:55:24,109 --> 01:55:29,899
Either that or I need to...

1692
01:55:30,539 --> 01:55:35,210
I mean, what does this look like with 12 strength?

1693
01:55:35,770 --> 01:55:36,250
I don't know.

1694
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:38,029
Does this okay?

1695
01:55:38,029 --> 01:55:41,229
Once I upgrade this, does this scale with strength?

1696
01:55:41,229 --> 01:55:41,710
Probably.

1697
01:55:42,590 --> 01:55:51,079
Well, as it stands right now, I have to pick something and I'm going to pick the claws.

1698
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:52,439
I'm going for it.

1699
01:55:52,439 --> 01:56:11,159
Claws have been upgraded and I'm gonna just put one into this.

1700
01:56:11,159 --> 01:56:18,970
I think because I haven't found another staff yet and like what the sorcery scaling like

1701
01:56:18,970 --> 01:56:19,770
needs to be better.

1702
01:56:20,489 --> 01:56:20,890
Right?

1703
01:56:20,890 --> 01:56:21,529
Like it just does.

1704
01:56:23,289 --> 01:56:26,600
So it's going to be doing a little bit more damage.

1705
01:56:27,239 --> 01:56:30,750
Okay.

1706
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:33,949
I actually have like a plus two weapon now and not walking around like a dickhead.

1707
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:42,989
And then we need to go back here and I am ready to attempt whatever this is.

1708
01:56:43,630 --> 01:56:47,579
Which was here, right?

1709
01:56:48,779 --> 01:56:51,399
Happy birthday to the guy in chat.

1710
01:56:52,039 --> 01:56:54,119
Happy birthday.

1711
01:57:00,909 --> 01:57:01,390
Hey, laugh.

1712
01:57:01,390 --> 01:57:02,430
Get the counter ready.

1713
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:08,090
I'm going to stick with three and two.

1714
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:09,529
I got the boys on standby.

1715
01:57:09,529 --> 01:57:15,020
If I need them, it's time to just let's all right.

1716
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:15,739
Let's open the door.

1717
01:57:17,789 --> 01:57:18,270
Let's see it.

1718
01:57:52,350 --> 01:57:55,159
Got a big fucking accident.

1719
01:57:55,159 --> 01:57:56,520
It's going to be slow as shit.

1720
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:01,239
Okay.

1721
01:58:01,239 --> 01:58:03,239
I thought this was four people riding the horse.

1722
01:58:17,770 --> 01:58:18,329
Oh man.

1723
01:58:18,329 --> 01:58:22,569
He's got, he's got, he's going to be swinging with like eight different arms.

1724
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:26,170
I'll drink the grafted.

1725
01:58:26,170 --> 01:58:26,409
All right.

1726
01:58:26,409 --> 01:58:43,470
What do you got?

1727
01:58:43,470 --> 01:58:44,109
Show me your moves.

1728
01:58:46,079 --> 01:58:47,119
It's a lot of AOE.

1729
01:58:57,020 --> 01:58:58,539
Big AOE, big AOE.

1730
01:58:58,539 --> 01:58:59,500
And he goes through a ball.

1731
01:59:00,140 --> 01:59:09,550
Got a lot of health.

1732
01:59:10,189 --> 01:59:31,279
Whoa.

1733
01:59:31,279 --> 01:59:32,079
The AOE, right?

1734
01:59:32,079 --> 01:59:32,560
Got to be careful.

1735
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:34,479
The AOE does a double AOE.

1736
01:59:35,279 --> 01:59:43,920
Holy shit.

1737
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:44,479
All right, dude.

1738
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:56,539
Come on one.

1739
01:59:56,539 --> 01:59:58,140
And then it's okay.

1740
01:59:58,140 --> 01:59:59,420
So you got to get the fuck away from that.

1741
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:01,340
Hey, after he does that role, you're going to get the fuck out of here.

1742
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:11,199
Is that what's he doing?

1743
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:12,319
What is he doing?

1744
02:00:13,119 --> 02:00:17,289
Did he miss and hit himself?

1745
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:26,479
Phase two.

1746
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:26,800
Yep.

1747
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:27,279
Of course.

1748
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:54,619
Oh, it's got his head.

1749
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:08,329
He has a flame thrower now.

1750
02:01:08,890 --> 02:01:15,850
I think it's time to jump over it.

1751
02:01:15,850 --> 02:01:25,210
Nope.

1752
02:01:25,210 --> 02:01:25,930
That's insane.

1753
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:34,720
He looks like a resident evil villain.

1754
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:36,000
Yeah, he does.

1755
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:37,119
All right.

1756
02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:38,319
So it's very clear here.

1757
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:42,220
So phase one is a lot of just...

1758
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:42,699
I don't want to...

1759
02:01:43,869 --> 02:01:44,750
Here's what I have to do.

1760
02:01:45,310 --> 02:01:46,810
I have to get good.

1761
02:01:48,029 --> 02:01:52,510
And I have to get him all the way to phase two without casting a spell.

1762
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,600
Because that's where it's going to be really important.

1763
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:56,319
Let's see what I can do.

1764
02:02:09,399 --> 02:02:10,520
One.

1765
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:10,760
Two.

1766
02:02:35,850 --> 02:02:37,130
Oh no.

1767
02:02:37,130 --> 02:02:37,930
The tornado.

1768
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:42,409
What the fuck am I?

1769
02:02:43,130 --> 02:02:56,560
Trouble here.

1770
02:02:57,359 --> 02:03:14,380
How do I get that fucking bleed?

1771
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:22,489
Shit.

1772
02:03:22,489 --> 02:03:23,609
It's faster than the other moves.

1773
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:42,859
Oh, that's right.

1774
02:03:42,859 --> 02:03:43,579
I did get another seed.

1775
02:03:43,579 --> 02:03:43,899
Yep.

1776
02:03:43,899 --> 02:03:44,859
Thanks for reminding me.

1777
02:03:44,859 --> 02:03:45,789
Seriously.

1778
02:03:45,789 --> 02:03:46,350
I would have forgot.

1779
02:03:46,350 --> 02:03:46,670
I wouldn't know.

1780
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:47,949
I would have absolutely forgot.

1781
02:03:49,439 --> 02:03:50,079
Blasks.

1782
02:03:50,079 --> 02:03:50,880
There we go.

1783
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:51,119
Okay.

1784
02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:52,159
That's a big deal.

1785
02:03:52,159 --> 02:03:52,880
That's a huge deal.

1786
02:03:56,319 --> 02:04:00,000
I'm thinking four and two is fine for now.

1787
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:00,479
We'll see if I...

1788
02:04:00,479 --> 02:04:00,800
I'm...

1789
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:00,960
What?

1790
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:01,359
We'll see.

1791
02:04:01,359 --> 02:04:02,399
We'll see.

1792
02:04:02,399 --> 02:04:05,640
We're going to call...

1793
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:05,880
Yeah.

1794
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:06,119
Yeah.

1795
02:04:06,119 --> 02:04:09,159
I got to get him to phase two without calling on the boys

1796
02:04:10,119 --> 02:04:11,800
and without casting a spell at him.

1797
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:14,510
That's definitely doable.

1798
02:04:14,510 --> 02:04:15,470
And then I can hang back.

1799
02:04:15,470 --> 02:04:17,229
The boys can do what they need to do and I'll kill him.

1800
02:04:17,949 --> 02:04:41,369
That fucking pro hop, man.

1801
02:04:41,609 --> 02:04:43,210
Why does everybody have to do that?

1802
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:53,159
I think I'm fighting the little brother of the guy that I fought fucking four hours ago.

1803
02:05:12,329 --> 02:05:19,229
What about that lady?

1804
02:05:19,229 --> 02:05:20,430
I think I can get it.

1805
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:20,909
I got to get back.

1806
02:05:20,909 --> 02:05:21,949
I got to get to phase two again.

1807
02:05:21,949 --> 02:05:30,460
If I can get to phase two, then I bring out the boys and then I just...

1808
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:31,819
And then I coward him.

1809
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:41,229
I'm not doing a lot of damage to him though.

1810
02:05:42,109 --> 02:05:42,750
I'm only doing what?

1811
02:05:42,750 --> 02:05:43,630
Like 60 or 70.

1812
02:05:43,630 --> 02:05:44,510
It's going to take a little longer.

1813
02:05:45,550 --> 02:05:45,869
All right.

1814
02:06:02,239 --> 02:06:20,960
Really happy little tantrum.

1815
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:21,359
That's fine.

1816
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:30,270
He's just like just amorphous blob.

1817
02:06:30,270 --> 02:06:31,630
I don't even know when he's attacking.

1818
02:06:32,430 --> 02:06:34,829
He's just like moving his body around.

1819
02:07:06,359 --> 02:07:07,079
Parry?

1820
02:07:07,079 --> 02:07:08,760
Can you parry bosses in this game?

1821
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:09,640
I feel like I tried.

1822
02:07:13,579 --> 02:07:14,460
Should I try parrying?

1823
02:07:16,729 --> 02:07:18,250
I think parrying has the same problem though.

1824
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:23,420
That was as...

1825
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:24,060
That was perfect.

1826
02:07:24,619 --> 02:07:28,189
Like that was actually a perfect parry and it didn't do anything.

1827
02:07:28,189 --> 02:07:46,920
I don't think so.

1828
02:07:48,699 --> 02:07:49,180
Yeah, you can't.

1829
02:07:50,380 --> 02:07:54,010
Guard counter works?

1830
02:07:54,810 --> 02:07:56,189
Oh, should I put it on?

1831
02:07:56,989 --> 02:08:05,239
Does that even lift lowly tarnished?

1832
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:11,039
No, I got the right idea.

1833
02:08:11,770 --> 02:08:12,649
I got the right idea.

1834
02:08:13,289 --> 02:08:19,869
I just got to be patient, be good.

1835
02:08:21,659 --> 02:08:22,300
Go get it.

1836
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:31,550
That is so slow.

1837
02:08:32,510 --> 02:08:34,560
Everybody's in slow motion.

1838
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:44,079
All right.

1839
02:08:44,079 --> 02:08:44,399
But okay.

1840
02:08:44,399 --> 02:08:47,600
So he goes huge slow swing.

1841
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:48,319
Dodge attack again.

1842
02:08:49,039 --> 02:08:49,920
You get hit by it again?

1843
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:58,699
If I dodge that one, he swings immediately after you land

1844
02:08:58,699 --> 02:08:59,819
with the iframe.

1845
02:08:59,819 --> 02:09:02,239
Fuck this guy.

1846
02:09:02,239 --> 02:09:12,680
He attacks three times in one session.

1847
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:13,720
Don't stop rolling.

1848
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:15,159
But how do you...

1849
02:09:15,159 --> 02:09:15,880
What am I supposed to do?

1850
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:16,680
Just run away?

1851
02:09:29,529 --> 02:09:30,329
Two.

1852
02:09:30,329 --> 02:09:32,279
That was a one, two.

1853
02:09:32,279 --> 02:09:32,840
That was three.

1854
02:09:37,069 --> 02:09:45,470
I have a better idea.

1855
02:09:46,189 --> 02:09:46,909
I got a better idea.

1856
02:09:46,909 --> 02:09:47,869
I'm going to use the weapon marker.

1857
02:09:48,670 --> 02:09:49,500
I got it.

1858
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:51,050
Protect yourself.

1859
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:51,689
Try this strat.

1860
02:09:58,960 --> 02:09:59,680
Boom, boom.

1861
02:10:00,319 --> 02:10:01,869
He only does two swings.

1862
02:10:01,869 --> 02:10:02,109
Okay.

1863
02:10:02,829 --> 02:10:04,239
So he goes boom, boom.

1864
02:10:04,239 --> 02:10:05,039
I think I can get behind him.

1865
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:38,479
Build up stamina for a second here.

1866
02:10:38,479 --> 02:10:41,680
No.

1867
02:10:43,199 --> 02:10:52,590
It's so hard to tell if he's going to actually swing

1868
02:10:52,590 --> 02:10:53,949
or if he's going to do the fucking tornado.

1869
02:10:53,949 --> 02:10:54,829
It's the same animation.

1870
02:10:55,630 --> 02:11:03,319
Is that not...

1871
02:11:03,319 --> 02:11:05,159
Wait, does the dodge not have iframes?

1872
02:11:05,159 --> 02:11:06,600
Does the weapon art dodge have iframes?

1873
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:07,159
It doesn't.

1874
02:11:07,159 --> 02:11:07,960
No, it doesn't.

1875
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:08,439
Fuck.

1876
02:11:08,439 --> 02:11:09,079
I thought it did.

1877
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:22,439
Damn slow ass goddamn boss.

1878
02:11:22,439 --> 02:11:22,920
Fuckers.

1879
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:32,409
You have range?

1880
02:11:32,409 --> 02:11:32,810
I know.

1881
02:11:32,810 --> 02:11:34,649
I'm trying to get him to phase two without using it

1882
02:11:34,649 --> 02:11:35,930
because I'll burn through it all.

1883
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:37,449
And then he's going to do the flamethrower

1884
02:11:37,449 --> 02:11:38,329
and he's going to kill me.

1885
02:11:39,130 --> 02:11:48,319
Should you do jump R2?

1886
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:53,180
Quick jump.

1887
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:54,220
Quick step and quick jump.

1888
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:54,859
Have iframes?

1889
02:11:55,579 --> 02:11:56,829
What the hell are you guys doing?

1890
02:11:57,949 --> 02:12:00,010
Summon the boys?

1891
02:12:01,149 --> 02:12:01,390
All right.

1892
02:12:01,390 --> 02:12:01,949
I'm going to...

1893
02:12:01,949 --> 02:12:03,470
Let me try this one or two more times.

1894
02:12:04,189 --> 02:12:08,840
This is a good strategy as long as I can actually do it.

1895
02:12:09,399 --> 02:12:26,300
That extra second that he sits there

1896
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:27,340
and you think he's going to swing

1897
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:28,939
and he just fucking doesn't.

1898
02:12:30,699 --> 02:12:43,470
I hate it.

1899
02:12:43,470 --> 02:12:44,270
I hate it.

1900
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:06,279
Just kill me already.

1901
02:13:06,279 --> 02:13:06,840
I'm going to try...

1902
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:07,000
All right.

1903
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:07,720
New strategy.

1904
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:21,920
No.

1905
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:22,880
Okay.

1906
02:13:23,439 --> 02:13:24,479
All right.

1907
02:13:24,479 --> 02:13:25,600
He holds it in the air

1908
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:27,199
and just like his dickhead brother,

1909
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:28,560
he goes like this.

1910
02:13:33,399 --> 02:13:34,359
So it's on the...

1911
02:13:34,359 --> 02:13:36,279
You wait for the two pumps

1912
02:13:36,279 --> 02:13:37,800
and then he'll do it.

1913
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:46,590
So he puts his arm up.

1914
02:13:49,789 --> 02:13:50,109
Okay.

1915
02:13:50,109 --> 02:13:50,829
There and there he does.

1916
02:13:50,829 --> 02:13:51,710
All right.

1917
02:13:51,710 --> 02:13:55,130
Yeah.

1918
02:13:55,130 --> 02:13:55,930
He's a two pump.

1919
02:13:56,729 --> 02:13:57,689
What does that mean?

1920
02:13:57,689 --> 02:13:58,729
I don't think I want to say that out loud.

1921
02:14:00,199 --> 02:14:01,239
I don't want to say what you just...

1922
02:14:01,239 --> 02:14:02,279
I'm not saying that out loud.

1923
02:14:11,449 --> 02:14:12,250
Yeah.

1924
02:14:12,250 --> 02:14:12,409
Okay.

1925
02:14:12,409 --> 02:14:13,609
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1926
02:14:13,609 --> 02:14:14,649
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1927
02:14:14,649 --> 02:14:15,369
What the fuck?

1928
02:14:35,020 --> 02:14:35,819
They're all slow.

1929
02:14:36,539 --> 02:14:41,630
He's so fucking slow.

1930
02:14:41,630 --> 02:15:07,039
it's so fucking slow they're so fucking slow oh you're scaring people all right let's go

1931
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:43,840
i gotta at least get him back down to 50 like i dude what the fuck man what what why an elder

1932
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:47,840
ring do they want you just to turn and just run the other direction to the other side of the map

1933
02:15:48,479 --> 02:15:55,529
like oh he's doing that move just run all the way to the back and like we're playing it's like

1934
02:15:55,529 --> 02:16:21,020
fucking recess playing like fucking tag the boys suck they're actually doing pretty good

1935
02:16:21,579 --> 02:17:29,100
i just got lucky there oh my god it was like homing missile get this shit out of there

1936
02:17:30,459 --> 02:19:01,530
run run run run run run what is he doing what is he doing what is he doing what is he doing what

1937
02:19:01,530 --> 02:19:09,719
is he doing oh wait i can just smash on him there okay i can just smash on him i don't know why i

1938
02:19:09,719 --> 02:19:13,239
thought he was gonna explode i could get in there and just like wail on him all right

1939
02:19:14,729 --> 02:19:18,729
right okay so when he does that just absolutely beat that lever every little shit out

1940
02:19:19,850 --> 02:19:35,280
all right let's go at least i get to see it again here's another attack with the arm

1941
02:19:47,209 --> 02:19:57,340
round up in the air okay fire breathing just goes oh fuck bad how do i get away from him

1942
02:19:58,379 --> 02:20:07,149
i just can't get away from him why is it taking me so long to do that dude

1943
02:20:10,959 --> 02:20:15,760
i'm gonna unbind the left stick by the way it's just such a hindrance it just fucks you every

1944
02:20:15,760 --> 02:21:22,360
single time get me out what huh what happened a fire hot fire all right i got the strategy here

1945
02:21:22,360 --> 02:21:28,600
here's the strategy probably is when he all right when he goes down wham wham wham wham wham wham

1946
02:21:29,319 --> 02:21:38,510
when he's breathing the fire you can usually get a few good hits in all right let's get this

1947
02:21:38,510 --> 02:21:48,600
going here honestly you know what phase one i think is is magic because i can get them

1948
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:53,149
down reliably hopefully let's see what i can do should i maybe just walk the magic just get

1949
02:21:53,149 --> 02:22:00,799
in there and beat this shit up let's see i got of course like i had to walk right into that like

1950
02:22:00,799 --> 02:22:22,139
because who the fuck even tells me an idiot just want to do a single fucking move unbind it i have

1951
02:22:22,139 --> 02:22:30,520
to unbind it it's such a bad place to put that i would rather have no ability to crouch than

1952
02:22:30,520 --> 02:23:16,350
have to crouch in the middle of fucking boss fight let's go get in there oh is it close enough

1953
02:23:16,989 --> 02:24:01,899
come on fucking what what's happening it's a new move i haven't seen that shit too greedy

1954
02:24:37,610 --> 02:24:42,540
is it actually a homing missile that's stupid it is it actually is

1955
02:24:43,500 --> 02:25:28,399
here comes shit homing missile attacks you and it goes 100 miles per hour i'm burning through

1956
02:25:28,639 --> 02:25:41,610
all right i gotta like i feel like i'm not doing enough damage like even when i hit them it just

1957
02:25:41,610 --> 02:25:46,329
feels like it's i'm doing like nothing let me see if i can actually handle this forget about the

1958
02:25:46,329 --> 02:25:50,590
boys for now let me practice for a minute because like seriously if it's just about

1959
02:25:56,989 --> 02:25:59,790
magic actually is probably gonna be a bad idea in the second phase because of how

1960
02:26:01,629 --> 02:26:59,600
fuck that he turned around it's fuck dude you reach across the whole game

1961
02:27:00,399 --> 02:27:11,389
my fucking god it's over let's put gravestones fucking scan it around the whole area and they'll

1962
02:27:11,389 --> 02:27:30,409
run into him he's in the air and he just goes like like i would rather just be like final

1963
02:27:30,409 --> 02:27:35,610
destination like there's nothing here it's just me and you and like a black screen behind us i

1964
02:27:35,610 --> 02:27:59,000
don't want i don't want to run into this shit let's go i keep thinking he's gonna jump in the

1965
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:04,120
air and do the big two-handed swing but he doesn't just so hard to tell sometimes what he's actually

1966
02:28:04,120 --> 02:28:19,040
gonna do he has the same telegraph with like two three different moves or he does that shit and

1967
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:25,040
like what are you gonna do to get stuck in it and that shit is like driving in a blizzard it takes

1968
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:39,440
up the whole fucking screen you can't see where you're going i'm angry i keep being like a tenth

1969
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:56,319
of a second late on that all right we're going we're gonna go combo andy here okay don't combo

1970
02:28:56,319 --> 02:29:21,370
andy let's see what i mean in a minute stop doing fucking moves like do you have a fucking

1971
02:29:21,370 --> 02:29:45,049
stamina bar trying to avoid the fucking huge tombstones they got these like giant like

1972
02:29:45,049 --> 02:29:53,079
10 commandment slabs that are scattered around the whole fucking area all right we're going

1973
02:29:53,079 --> 02:31:36,700
combo combo this video game seriously like it was under the ground it was under the goddamn ground

1974
02:31:36,700 --> 02:32:23,879
it was like fucking tornado one of the blacks oh that can hurt you dude i can't fucking see

1975
02:32:23,879 --> 02:32:44,079
through these stupid gravestones man come on i'm so fucking dead let's just come on

1976
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:59,559
he says so many different moves and he has 500 fucking million health like even when i get him

1977
02:32:59,559 --> 02:33:12,239
like down to like i only have joe biden wouldn't die to this boss i'm not sure joe biden would know

1978
02:33:12,239 --> 02:33:20,639
where x was on the xbox controller i don't think most people over the age of 60 would know where

1979
02:33:20,639 --> 02:33:29,639
the x on the xbox controller is so i don't think so i think i got an advantage time to angry flight

1980
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:56,799
and i'll show you what i mean by that shit dude you have to seriously go across the whole fucking

1981
02:33:56,799 --> 02:34:26,319
game take dude left stick being crouched what were they thinking what were they thinking

1982
02:34:28,959 --> 02:34:49,549
what were they thinking i have to unbind it it's like fucking awful what can i change it to

1983
02:34:50,190 --> 02:35:02,250
there's nothing the amount of times that like i'm moving around and the left stick just actually

1984
02:35:02,250 --> 02:35:07,899
clicks in and he crouches it's just like what the fuck dude you're down on the d-pad that's

1985
02:35:07,899 --> 02:35:28,190
actually not a bad idea no but that potions though find it to the xbox button what can i make it

1986
02:35:28,909 --> 02:35:43,370
what is up on the d-pad switch sorcery what is uh no i don't know what i can even make it

1987
02:35:43,930 --> 02:35:51,770
i'm just gonna leave it without any okay yeah it's not happening now i'm just gonna i'm gonna

1988
02:35:51,770 --> 02:36:00,059
unbind it put it on right stick that's actually not a bad idea no right stick is um is lock on

1989
02:36:00,059 --> 02:36:26,010
that's a huge deal i'm just gonna unbind it dude that's so irritating you really have to put it

1990
02:36:26,010 --> 02:36:56,860
in the ground like the second one sometimes goes underground i'm in trouble actually you know what

1991
02:36:56,860 --> 02:37:00,940
i need i need more flasks i think i have to go adventure before i continue to do this

1992
02:37:01,659 --> 02:37:17,260
because as a caster losing a few flasks is like horrible horrible horrible i'm at like a

1993
02:37:17,260 --> 02:37:25,069
disadvantage every fight because i just have like three healing yeah i mean i'm doing like 25 percent

1994
02:37:25,069 --> 02:37:36,299
of his bar that's awesome oh man a little bit longer it's actually a little better i could

1995
02:37:36,299 --> 02:37:44,600
probably try just not using magic at all and just having five uh those flasks might actually be

1996
02:37:44,600 --> 02:38:36,459
better the bleed stacks i think are way better casting i think i just have to actually hit him

1997
02:38:40,540 --> 02:39:16,280
run not again right after it come on no i thought i got under it i didn't get under it

1998
02:39:16,840 --> 02:40:04,799
oh man you just get so caught holy shit i didn't think i was gonna go that far

1999
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:11,149
oh

2000
02:40:11,709 --> 02:40:16,000
how long does he do it for how fucking long do you do it for

2001
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:31,440
i should have gone forward but i just like he was just at an angle on me oh my god all right

2002
02:40:32,319 --> 02:40:41,530
i've made a decision there's the decision i'm not doing magic magic i think it just takes up

2003
02:40:41,530 --> 02:40:50,110
too much i'd rather have like six heals get up there actually hit this motherfucker lead him

2004
02:40:50,190 --> 02:41:40,840
and i think that's gonna be better let's go dude he didn't do the jump how did he not do

2005
02:41:40,840 --> 02:41:49,770
my damn rock next to me this little fucking ledge it had to be the stupid fucking ledge

2006
02:41:49,770 --> 02:41:55,120
i like bumping into the ledge it's like somebody came in and played like fucking

2007
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:59,120
roller coaster tycoon and just didn't understand the terrain tool just fucking moved it all over

2008
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:31,709
the place just die just die that move is like a full three seconds just go like one two three

2009
02:42:32,510 --> 02:42:47,819
calm down honey let's get you some tea you know i just i want to take that tool in roller coaster

2010
02:42:47,819 --> 02:42:55,180
tycoon that like you just drag it over and like smooth out these fucking bumps all right settle

2011
02:42:55,180 --> 02:44:37,440
down over an opening no you don't oh my god i'm not doing enough damage how many times did i hit him

2012
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:44,569
i did like fucking big 10 of his bar why do i dodge to the left because it's burned into my brain

2013
02:44:44,569 --> 02:44:50,969
dodging right like it's hard to do for me get in there blood-borne style my problem with getting

2014
02:44:50,969 --> 02:44:57,209
in their blood-borne style is the guy is so fucking slow that like it's not like a dodge here we go

2015
02:44:57,209 --> 02:45:01,610
fight fight dodge it's just it's it's this slow ass encounter i just get i get myself killed

2016
02:45:07,079 --> 02:45:10,680
that's another reason why i can't do that the guy has like a fight me counter

2017
02:45:11,719 --> 02:45:14,840
this boss has a fight me counter where you're not supposed to fight it

2018
02:45:14,840 --> 02:45:34,809
even to go like this to his head use the quick step yeah but the quick step it's i don't know

2019
02:45:34,809 --> 02:45:39,370
sometimes it's hard to gauge sometimes like when you can and can't do it because if you use quick

2020
02:45:39,370 --> 02:45:43,610
step when you're locked on sometimes you'll just spin around it could be kind of jarring

2021
02:45:45,049 --> 02:45:51,500
i don't even know what direction i was just trying to go there he said your build is awful

2022
02:45:52,139 --> 02:46:01,600
i mean it's great for fighting like regular enemies but it's sorcery man like if you sometimes if you

2023
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:11,920
don't go full sorcery you're you're in for some shit i would adopt all right hold on let me let

2024
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:19,340
me get this right all right i'm gonna give him like one or two more attempts so then i'm gonna

2025
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:37,049
go to something else is this why all the battle mages died out just do six magic flasks and

2026
02:46:37,049 --> 02:46:45,209
fucking run away it's so but i'll i will run out i will run out of flasks i can definitely do it

2027
02:46:45,770 --> 02:46:53,309
it's just here's the problem splitting between intelligence and dexterity is making both my

2028
02:46:53,309 --> 02:47:00,809
magic and my actual swings not as good as they could be right eventually it'll even out eventually

2029
02:47:00,809 --> 02:47:15,229
it should be fine but for now now i have to rely on both i could do it all right no more no more

2030
02:47:16,350 --> 02:47:39,020
i'm doing both headphones don't nobody talk to me i fucking hate that it's so dumb it doesn't

2031
02:47:39,020 --> 02:48:27,950
even give you a chance to fucking attack him he just hits you you have another move with that

2032
02:48:27,950 --> 02:49:24,750
fucking combo oh fuck off just swing it dude come on it's so stupid it's like his game is

2033
02:49:24,750 --> 02:50:04,059
lagging and he's not falling down i'm so dead god are you supposed to close the gap with this

2034
02:50:04,059 --> 02:50:27,579
fucking guy hitting the second phase consistently with magic at least it's not the trees the tree

2035
02:50:27,579 --> 02:50:34,110
center was had like a tactic you use the horse which by the way where's the fucking horse

2036
02:50:34,909 --> 02:50:39,159
why can i play with it where's the horse i was the where the fuck is the horse

2037
02:50:39,959 --> 02:51:25,559
where's the horse try this what the fuck boys don't help here they die in one aoe

2038
02:51:26,440 --> 02:52:29,280
on where where where where where i'm a little baby i don't like hard games dude i can't even

2039
02:52:29,280 --> 02:53:41,399
fucking see what he's doing dude god i tried to wait too what the fuck he does that stupid

2040
02:53:41,399 --> 02:53:48,840
shit man it's so hard to it's so hard to not get juked when he has 50 other moves he does

2041
02:53:49,799 --> 02:56:24,010
no stop doing this move what the fuck man dude he's done this like so many times in a row

2042
02:56:27,149 --> 02:57:00,479
i can't get a position on him he's talking strategy by the way oh my god i

2043
02:57:00,479 --> 02:57:18,940
i know i was doing so good god last one get in there boom boom get it my god can you seriously

2044
02:57:18,940 --> 02:58:49,530
the fucking aoe moves how many are you going to do in a row what the fuck oh my god what

2045
02:58:50,170 --> 02:59:20,059
he got agreed for the bleed i know it's just he has so he has so many different kind okay here's

2046
02:59:20,059 --> 02:59:27,200
the thing about elden ring listen to me they all have so many different kinds of moves so like

2047
02:59:27,840 --> 02:59:35,290
on a scale of one to ten like area attacks like short attacks quick attacks long attacks from a

2048
02:59:35,290 --> 02:59:43,610
scale of one to ten they got them all they have from one to ten it's so difficult to like predict

2049
02:59:43,610 --> 02:59:49,309
what they're going to do because they have so many different kinds of moves this is not like the

2050
02:59:49,309 --> 02:59:56,840
dancer that just like spins in a circle five times well i wasn't ready for that

2051
02:59:57,559 --> 03:00:22,729
can i just say can i go can i jump over that just jump but jump where jump over a lot of things

2052
03:00:24,829 --> 03:00:32,639
i feel like i've tried to jump over aoe moves and i just get killed the ground pound can be

2053
03:00:32,639 --> 03:00:38,030
jumped over can it i feel like i've tried that a few times i'll try it let's see what happens

2054
03:00:38,590 --> 03:00:53,450
but that okay not that one that's not a ground pound yeah that one when he goes

2055
03:00:53,930 --> 03:01:05,420
ah i would actually save a lot of time if it actually works i have to go around his right side

2056
03:01:13,850 --> 03:01:20,010
you have to dodge roll the second one so you have to go like bang bang i feel like he swings

2057
03:01:20,010 --> 03:01:33,819
too fast to dodge the second one after you get the eye cramp you're doing good at the beginning i

2058
03:01:33,819 --> 03:01:55,760
actually that last one was not bad just trying to like figure out should i do our right trigger

2059
03:01:56,719 --> 03:02:02,620
should i do a heavy attack maybe a heavy attack is better than just one or two i wonder how much

2060
03:02:02,620 --> 03:02:40,670
bleed how come is there a bleed counter that i can see i think that's better can't get away from that

2061
03:02:40,670 --> 03:04:15,520
one it also doesn't have this body goes off the screen too what the fuck i have no stamina

2062
03:04:16,639 --> 03:04:47,739
fucking can't see when he goes behind a fucking tree dude come on when he's like you can't see

2063
03:04:47,739 --> 03:04:53,629
what he's doing i can't fucking see him he does like the roll and it gets stuck somewhere and

2064
03:04:53,629 --> 03:05:07,760
then it's like all right what the fuck are you gonna do next fuck you fuck you oh be careful

2065
03:05:07,760 --> 03:05:12,159
he might get like stuck behind like the fucking giant blockade dragon and then uh good luck

2066
03:05:12,159 --> 03:06:24,159
finally he did he shot a projectile at you behind there by the way good luck oh dude really again

2067
03:06:24,159 --> 03:06:32,989
with this fucking bullshit like i if you're not at like the exact precise place you need to be

2068
03:06:32,989 --> 03:06:44,680
when he's randomly will do that that was such a good start too it's just like the dude remember

2069
03:06:44,680 --> 03:06:52,680
can you look at my bumble profile i can't get any matches um i don't know he's incredibly mad

2070
03:06:55,020 --> 03:07:19,340
this guy's fucking hard i meet his fucking fingers you're not as mad as last night i feel

2071
03:07:19,340 --> 03:08:27,930
like i'm playing the same boss as last night i feel like these are the same people okay i think

2072
03:08:27,930 --> 03:08:32,090
beginning as a fourth attack there it takes a fucking so long to do it how do you even remember

2073
03:08:33,129 --> 03:08:55,399
i keep i'm just so i can't get the slow attacks it's always been a problem

2074
03:08:55,399 --> 03:09:00,250
in every from software game i've ever played and this game is full of them

2075
03:09:20,350 --> 03:09:23,709
summon the lady i don't i don't want to summon i want to beat it on my own

2076
03:09:24,670 --> 03:09:29,229
i don't want to summon i want to beat it on my own without any help

2077
03:09:30,030 --> 03:09:37,229
any outside sources i got him down to like 10 like three or four times now i can do it

2078
03:09:37,870 --> 03:09:58,010
got stuck in the fucking gravestones they don't even need to fucking be here why are they even in

2079
03:09:58,010 --> 03:10:23,020
here what like if the enemies can get stuck on that stuff delete it why is it here so here's the

2080
03:10:23,020 --> 03:10:29,069
problem building bleed stacks on this guy's heart because by the time you almost have enough he

2081
03:10:29,069 --> 03:10:38,809
might just do the whirlwind move and then you just get fucking hit by it all right this is the last

2082
03:10:38,809 --> 03:10:44,219
one before i go do something else because obviously i need like another point in this weapon

2083
03:10:44,940 --> 03:11:14,379
or i need another point sorcery or something it's in the air my i can't dodge that second attack

2084
03:11:21,920 --> 03:11:25,120
yeah you can't dodge the second attack there's not enough time

2085
03:11:27,100 --> 03:11:30,299
once you by the time you land he's already swinging his right hand or his left hand

2086
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:45,690
your armor is at zero percent durability all right last one for real actually last one last

2087
03:11:45,690 --> 03:12:08,780
one for real see what i mean like you just can't you can't stay near him fucking gravestones

2088
03:12:09,659 --> 03:12:27,739
yeah see he fucking hates him too he's pissed too he's sitting there going like all of why is

2089
03:12:27,739 --> 03:12:34,059
this here who put this here why the fuck is this light post here he's as mad as i am don't call me

2090
03:12:34,059 --> 03:13:21,850
mad he's bad too i'm getting hit by the axe it's hard to get that second dodge it's gonna be perfect

2091
03:13:57,959 --> 03:15:24,040
no dude it's give me the other blade give me the other blade dude come on i'm a mad i wonder like

2092
03:15:24,040 --> 03:15:27,879
i don't know if you just dodged through it i feel like you can still get hit by it

2093
03:15:34,459 --> 03:15:38,620
when he does the big fire thing like you have to run around him right you have to get around him

2094
03:15:38,620 --> 03:15:43,579
but you can't run to the left because he'll just hit you with it did you dodge through it like can

2095
03:15:43,579 --> 03:15:47,899
i go through that fire i feel like you can't i tried jumping over before and you still get

2096
03:15:47,899 --> 03:15:58,489
hit by like the residual hitbox like you can jump over the fire can i actually jump it

2097
03:15:58,489 --> 03:16:48,329
just hit last attempt i'm a liar i'm a liar god fucking get the shit out of the god damn place

2098
03:16:48,329 --> 03:16:49,850
come on where's the blade

2099
03:17:52,680 --> 03:19:18,940
get rid of the fucking stupid scenery why is it here what what is that ending what

2100
03:20:12,030 --> 03:20:27,719
do you understand why now i what the fuck is the point of some of this scenery bullshit i'm sitting

2101
03:20:27,719 --> 03:20:34,760
like in a fucking tree i had to burn through like three or four flasks that's so stupid

2102
03:20:35,559 --> 03:22:47,549
it's not worth dying over no he went the way with it i was going he went the i was jerry he went my

2103
03:22:47,549 --> 03:24:59,399
way run away far away we cannot harm you wowie wowie wowie wowie he had to do that right there

2104
03:25:04,139 --> 03:25:10,139
he had to do that right there i tried to get up and like jump but it was just too late i was too

2105
03:25:10,139 --> 03:25:19,389
i was on the ground already oh man i was right there that's just so unfortunate like the fire

2106
03:25:19,389 --> 03:25:27,600
thing i can't jump over it i can't dodging through it is hard too i i if i had mana or something

2107
03:25:27,600 --> 03:27:36,649
fuck man come on sprint i gotta dodge through it like that way oh i'm so fucking far away it's

2108
03:27:36,649 --> 03:28:38,829
a different way i'm good god damn it i still don't get it i gotta get away from that shit

2109
03:28:54,329 --> 03:29:12,159
dude fuck you are a huge ass arm fuck off oh my fucking god dude i can't i just it's so much for

2110
03:29:12,159 --> 03:29:21,340
my brain to handle just choking on those fucking moves just so annoying i have to dodge right

2111
03:29:21,420 --> 03:29:52,969
through the middle what the fuck it's just like okay so here's my problem when he does the flame

2112
03:29:52,969 --> 03:29:58,729
thing right it's like he this too that's why there's like you have so many different random

2113
03:29:58,729 --> 03:30:03,850
fucking ass moves one of them is like a big cone in front of them and the other one is like a big

2114
03:30:03,850 --> 03:30:09,049
slow wave but it's like it's hard to tell which one of those fucking two stupid moves it's gonna

2115
03:30:09,049 --> 03:31:11,290
be because you can't dodge through the one that's in the front no bleed where's the bleed bro where's

2116
03:31:11,290 --> 03:31:35,639
the bleed seriously where's the bleed i had so many fucking times one two

2117
03:31:38,040 --> 03:34:01,149
it's even fucking longer than that fuck this goddamn game one dude no that was i dodged right

2118
03:34:01,149 --> 03:34:10,860
through it and i got hit by a piece of fire that i'm gonna i would like the referees to go back

2119
03:34:10,860 --> 03:34:15,180
and fucking take a look and see if that actually happened it's like the fire was gone and i like

2120
03:34:15,180 --> 03:36:04,409
touched it with like my heel too late too late fuck you i should have my steam in the bar was

2121
03:36:04,409 --> 03:36:16,299
a little too low friend dude it's the stupid fucking gravestones that was probably the one

2122
03:36:16,940 --> 03:36:22,540
just getting like trapped behind fucking objects you can't walk through and like the fact that

2123
03:36:22,540 --> 03:36:26,860
everything has fucking collision and the collision is like a full square around the goddamn thing

2124
03:36:28,139 --> 03:36:38,719
it's like you just get stuck and they're everywhere they're fucking everyone it's like how are you

2125
03:36:38,719 --> 03:36:47,420
supposed to fight this guy in a a like fucking two-lane highway right here that was absolutely

2126
03:36:47,420 --> 03:36:54,139
the one this guy's area just sucks like asshole fuck this area fighting this guy here different

2127
03:36:54,219 --> 03:37:01,239
elevations the gravestones the gigantic dragon ass tree that's here you gotta fight this guy

2128
03:37:01,239 --> 03:37:09,610
in like a 10 meter radius like here i'll i'm got i got it i got it this guy's fucking dead

2129
03:37:11,370 --> 03:37:18,239
this guy's fucking dead mad yeah because that's like the fourth or fifth time that a run gets

2130
03:37:18,239 --> 03:37:27,610
blown because there's a gravestone behind my body that i can't like i'm just dead put them like up

2131
03:37:27,610 --> 03:37:32,090
in the fucking vistas and shit like they don't have to be so many down here how many people have

2132
03:37:32,090 --> 03:37:39,049
died here this is like this how many gravestones are there in fucking elven ring all right let's

2133
03:37:39,049 --> 03:37:56,010
go i don't understand bleed i really don't that was like three auto attacks and it and it did

2134
03:37:56,010 --> 03:38:11,129
bleed i have done like 40 auto attacks and it doesn't happen is it a cooldown what bad place to

2135
03:38:11,129 --> 03:39:43,000
be i'm just being a fucking clumsy i'm alive i'm fine i'm fine i'm alive god damn it man

2136
03:39:43,719 --> 03:39:48,860
oh god fucking damn it like the one move that he couldn't do in the one spot that he couldn't do

2137
03:39:48,860 --> 03:39:55,850
it in the one move that would have hit me if i when i get up the instantly i fucking get up

2138
03:40:01,290 --> 03:40:09,340
stay close to him but dodging some of those aoe attacks that he has he's gonna get trapped

2139
03:40:09,899 --> 03:41:34,200
i need stamina i need stamina all right fuck you see that's why like and you get trapped in there

2140
03:41:35,159 --> 03:41:47,690
like what the fuck is hitting me behind you can't go near him is it happening behind him too

2141
03:41:48,729 --> 03:42:05,370
such bullshit god it's so much longer even when you think even when you think you're holding it for

2142
03:42:05,370 --> 03:42:38,510
long enough it's still not enough fuck now so much variance in speed one two wait it's so hard to

2143
03:42:38,590 --> 03:43:09,629
tell i'm not going near him man no not again

2144
03:43:38,559 --> 03:44:16,879
fuck you no you can't i thought no he stops and he does the two fireballs come on he stops and

2145
03:44:16,879 --> 03:44:21,600
he goes fireball fireball and the one time he fucking does it there's just too much variance

2146
03:44:24,409 --> 03:44:28,809
it's like how am i supposed to tell am i too far away am i too close the fucking goddamn

2147
03:44:28,809 --> 03:44:36,860
variables on these fights yeah i know i have full mana but man i've got a thing going on here and

2148
03:44:36,860 --> 03:44:48,280
i'm doing well changing changing it up is bad so all over the place when it comes to speed and

2149
03:44:48,280 --> 03:45:41,850
shit but he was not gonna do another move i would try to fuck you all right all right all right

2150
03:45:41,850 --> 03:46:05,319
fuck you piece of fucking dog shit i you know what i need to figure out what the actual strategy is

2151
03:46:05,319 --> 03:46:07,959
there because i keep fucking it up i just keep getting hit by it every time

2152
03:46:43,530 --> 03:46:46,329
get away from the fucking tree i'm not having this happen again

2153
03:46:59,000 --> 03:47:04,940
dude come the fuck on i don't care who you are that's a stupid fucking move i don't care who you

2154
03:47:04,940 --> 03:48:43,389
are i don't care what your complaint is wowie blade hot hot too hot hit him what

2155
03:48:44,350 --> 03:48:48,840
oh

2156
03:48:54,920 --> 03:49:10,170
that guy sucks that i sucked that guy sucked this game's not even fucking me it's a great i love it

2157
03:49:10,889 --> 03:49:19,000
what a what an experience really trying to get going and fight him and get him and kill him

2158
03:49:19,950 --> 03:49:25,239
it was uh that was a very very interesting thing to do we got him it took a lot it took a little

2159
03:49:25,239 --> 03:49:34,059
bit of perseverance i got a little heated there but you know it's okay we got him fuck that guy

2160
03:49:34,059 --> 03:49:41,760
and fuck that area those stones fuck the tree fuck the dragon on the tree and it looks beautiful

2161
03:49:41,760 --> 03:49:48,559
but it's no place to fight this is no place to fight a human or an animal or a beast or a legend

2162
03:49:48,559 --> 03:49:51,920
or a fighter it doesn't matter i don't care what we're fighting this and pick another place

2163
03:49:52,559 --> 03:49:57,149
like i would walk in here and be like dude all right you and i can fight but like can we just

2164
03:49:57,149 --> 03:50:02,110
like go like out in the open like let's do like a fair fight let's go do like a duel man

2165
03:50:02,110 --> 03:50:15,500
and dr seuss lyrics that sucked i just missed everything about that what did that say

2166
03:50:16,059 --> 03:50:29,799
reverence of garfield i missed that literally that whole thing i said would it say great ruin

2167
03:50:29,799 --> 03:50:36,959
can somebody explain it i literally skipped it i can't fucking dude i almost died at the very end

2168
03:50:36,959 --> 03:50:43,500
i would have fucking eaten my controller dude i really would have eaten my controller when i

2169
03:50:43,500 --> 03:50:48,299
was just casting and it's just nothing was hitting him did you notice i want you to rewind for a

2170
03:50:48,299 --> 03:50:55,180
second if you can for a moment it was hitting like a gravestone it was like hitting this thing

2171
03:50:57,049 --> 03:51:03,659
it wasn't though it was just a little too far away like i was out of range but i thought it

2172
03:51:03,659 --> 03:51:10,860
was hitting that thing and i was sitting here just going gravestone andy you know what i mean

2173
03:51:10,860 --> 03:51:18,569
i was about to fucking flip out i was gonna fucking freak out i thought it was actually

2174
03:51:18,569 --> 03:51:36,170
hitting that these these two main bosses so far have been fucking hell god all the tutorials

2175
03:51:36,170 --> 03:51:54,270
there okay they both have this like i know i've done this routine like 10 times already let's go

2176
03:51:54,270 --> 03:52:08,909
take a short break yeah i will i'm gonna get some more water what do you think hey so for those of

2177
03:52:08,909 --> 03:52:15,549
you that were saying sorcery hey casual you're a casual i beat that guy pretty much without it at

2178
03:52:15,549 --> 03:52:21,709
the very end i may have thrown out a a little a little dingy at him but i did that without

2179
03:52:21,709 --> 03:52:40,750
sorcery i need a break after watching strength 12 just to be able to use items what do you mean

2180
03:52:40,750 --> 03:53:05,450
that doesn't count um let's do 2020 16 i must have an i can actually do it again take the power of

2181
03:53:05,450 --> 03:53:12,780
its namesake be a finger reader yeah we're gonna take a break in a second i just want to get

2182
03:53:12,780 --> 03:53:25,229
situated oh where is that thing of course how many of you guys watch the stream muted you don't have

2183
03:53:25,229 --> 03:53:32,079
to listen to the guy complain for like an hour like is it at what at what point do i do this is

2184
03:53:32,079 --> 03:53:36,799
the streamer die like three four five six times ten times fifteen times in a row and then like

2185
03:53:36,799 --> 03:53:41,680
when they die this is how i would do it this is this is stress so when the streamer dies for like

2186
03:53:41,680 --> 03:53:47,600
the 15th time and his mouth goes that's what you just mute and he's gonna sit there and be like

2187
03:53:58,440 --> 03:54:06,520
and then when you when he goes into when they go into the boss door you unmute it so it just

2188
03:54:06,520 --> 03:54:12,719
it's if you get to watch the stream normally that's like that's actually a good idea that's

2189
03:54:12,719 --> 03:54:19,639
what i would be doing just every okay if i die 10 times in a row to boss just mute me after i die

2190
03:54:28,719 --> 03:54:45,639
you're always muted on my stream okay where is this item it's like this prime evil stone

2191
03:54:45,639 --> 03:54:59,579
or something whatever it was use this fp to mimic nearby objects where's this thing

2192
03:55:04,280 --> 03:55:08,059
what where is it you got godric's great rune you need to take it to the tower

2193
03:55:08,860 --> 03:55:16,649
i got two things though wasn't it i got two different things didn't i

2194
03:55:17,370 --> 03:55:26,649
or was that just explaining what that thing was all right let's take a break you got the

2195
03:55:26,649 --> 03:55:30,010
rune and his soul all right let's uh i'll be right back i'm gonna get some water i'm gonna

2196
03:55:30,010 --> 03:55:36,959
get a refill of maybe some green tea and i'll be back we'll keep going i took a break what happened

2197
03:55:37,840 --> 03:55:43,420
uh i gave up on the game i uh i just like a little too hard i think it's just like too much like i

2198
03:55:43,420 --> 03:55:49,420
if they patch out i got i haven't beat the guy uh if they patch out like 10 to 20 of the gravestones

2199
03:55:49,420 --> 03:55:53,500
then maybe i'll come back and try it again it's unfortunate but i'm gonna skip break when i come

2200
03:55:53,500 --> 04:03:14,909
back we'll play pit cross oh i didn't loop it i'm not even kidding they guys i had to go change my

2201
04:03:14,909 --> 04:03:25,559
clothes i was wet i was soaking wet like but that that shirt was as if somebody put it into the

2202
04:03:25,559 --> 04:03:35,629
washing machine sorry that took a little bit longer than it should have but i actually just

2203
04:03:35,629 --> 04:03:51,799
had to change my clothes i'm in like a different shirt now i'm in like a star wars shirt okay

2204
04:03:52,520 --> 04:04:03,739

2205
04:04:03,739 --> 04:04:13,879
intense fight i had to believe i was cooking up that one while i was taking a piss um okay i need

felly loop we met at stormvale i'm glad to see you here i have something for you i found it in

2252
04:16:36,809 --> 04:16:43,440
godric's grafting grounds you defeated him you should have it make good use of it i don't intend

2253
04:16:43,440 --> 04:16:51,280
to make a habit of scavenging corpses arsenal charm oh yes i wonder if you've met my foster

2254
04:16:51,280 --> 04:16:57,120

2255
04:16:57,680 --> 04:17:01,840
i'll introduce yourself at the round table i'm sure talking to him will be

2256
04:17:04,959 --> 04:17:12,750
raises maximum equipment load you might as well just use it

2257
04:17:12,750 --> 04:17:32,750
it's not you doors closed oh i'm gonna look at the painting

2258
04:17:43,739 --> 04:17:51,770
who's this isn't this place impressive the round table hall over quarters of the two fingers

2259
04:17:52,729 --> 04:17:58,159
and gathering place of champions who vie to become elder lord i never knew the guidance

2260
04:17:58,159 --> 04:18:05,840
bestowed upon us tarnished had such fantastic root although it's all a bit much for me in truth

2261
04:18:06,479 --> 04:18:13,520
i'm still looking for my own purpose your spells it's all a bit much for me in truth i'm still

2262
04:18:13,520 --> 04:18:35,079
looking for how many spells who has spells for captain hook oh it's this person oh it's the

2263
04:18:35,079 --> 04:18:48,190
finger reader

2264
04:18:57,629 --> 04:19:08,250
why is there a hand here

2265
04:19:17,370 --> 04:19:26,299
has taken its toll across the realm life lies in ruin pieces

2266
04:19:27,420 --> 04:19:38,379
foul curses and misery spread unabating but the greater will has not abandoned the realm

2267
04:19:38,379 --> 04:19:49,260
life that inhabits it so it is that the tarnished are guided by grace oops i'm sorry

2268
04:19:50,059 --> 04:20:03,739
are you that new tarnished until it was the tragical across the realm foul but the great

2269
04:20:03,739 --> 04:20:14,299
so it is brave to seek another of its kind to become the elder lord and restore the golden

2270
04:20:14,700 --> 04:20:16,059
seek another of its kind

2271
04:20:20,379 --> 04:20:35,760
i don't like this i don't like this this is weird touch the two fingers rapture what the hell that's

2272
04:20:35,760 --> 04:20:54,750
so weird

2273
04:20:57,709 --> 04:20:59,709
i feel like that's like attacking the world stone

2274
04:21:12,510 --> 04:21:18,909
so this is probably boss um boss shards boss weapons

2275
04:21:19,709 --> 04:21:31,690
who and you the strength of strength of the fingers

2276
04:21:31,690 --> 04:21:42,040
the fingers guide us all and you tarnished you are here to take our hand is this though

2277
04:21:44,670 --> 04:21:49,549
oh great rooms great children of the goddess queen marika

2278
04:21:49,549 --> 04:21:57,870
queen marika she who is vessel of the elden ring tainted by the strengths of their ruins

2279
04:21:57,870 --> 04:22:12,200
her children ward but none become and so grace was extended to your kind listen the fingers speak

2280
04:22:13,000 --> 04:22:22,120
the grito will has long renounced the demigods tarnished show no mercy

2281
04:22:23,000 --> 04:22:32,909
have their heads take all they have left indeed but remember what are you talking through

2282
04:22:32,989 --> 04:22:40,700
the demigods are each and all the direct offspring marika

2283
04:22:40,700 --> 04:23:11,229
gudrik the glove that's the only thing i can say in like the 10 minutes we've been walking around

2284
04:23:11,790 --> 04:23:16,780
with the power of remembrance menu you can draw out the power of remembrance namesake each

2285
04:23:16,780 --> 04:23:21,420
remember is can provide one power once the power is claimed the remembrance will be lost

2286
04:23:23,309 --> 04:23:34,200
axe of gudrik or whatever that thing is and i see what it looks like okay rafted dragon

2287
04:23:41,319 --> 04:23:53,639
faith scaling what is that it's faith it's not intelligence unfortunately it's the fist

2288
04:23:54,600 --> 04:24:03,290
only i knew that you're doing a faith strength build well i i believe i believe you've just

2289
04:24:03,290 --> 04:24:12,940
seen something that you should be using what if i don't want these can i just break it or

2290
04:24:12,940 --> 04:24:24,059
do i have to use that is it like the other games like can i just smack shit and eat it i can just

2291
04:24:24,059 --> 04:24:30,360
eat it for money right you can turn it into ruins just yeah just like all the other games

2292
04:24:32,030 --> 04:24:39,290
yeah i i can't i can't use either one of those things i use it yeah that's it of course

2293
04:24:41,079 --> 04:24:47,719
20 000 runes are you serious i mean it would have been cool uh that that dragon arm thing

2294
04:24:47,719 --> 04:24:52,780
is probably awesome all right is there anything else you need me to do so this is the boss soul

2295
04:24:52,780 --> 04:25:10,620
person all right fingers are here i'm gonna level up again i hope somebody has a staff do that gesture

2296
04:25:10,620 --> 04:25:51,610
in front of the fingers really what do you do gesture was rapture this is it looking this is

2297
04:25:51,610 --> 04:26:05,520
like what everybody's cat does it's like you look down the cat's just there like pick me up so you

2298
04:26:05,520 --> 04:26:16,829
look down the catches on your leg like i'm coming up here okay that was cool don't hurt that that

2299
04:26:16,829 --> 04:26:47,799
was very strange it's all right up ease up ease rest oh i can rest here i knew i could i'm not

2300
04:26:47,799 --> 04:26:54,319
sure what to do because there's a theory of dumping it into endurance and vitality

2301
04:26:55,120 --> 04:27:05,360
i feel like it's been a while but i feel like i'm falling behind a lot on damage right now

2302
04:27:06,319 --> 04:27:15,069
fighting godric i feel like i was not doing enough damage i i think i need to start i really need to

2303
04:27:15,069 --> 04:27:24,250
find that sorcerer because he had that that weapon and that move maybe some more mana

2304
04:27:25,049 --> 04:27:33,239
all right we're gonna do two and endurance get endurance to 15 and we'll get mined up to 14

2305
04:27:34,360 --> 04:27:41,770
and then i i saved those souls because i need to find that guy because i gotta get some of these

2306
04:27:41,770 --> 04:27:48,040
new abilities because that magic sword is essentially what i'll be using for the most

2307
04:27:48,040 --> 04:27:57,920
of the game i would assume i don't want to hug i know where the sorcerer is but i won't tell you

2308
04:27:57,920 --> 04:28:23,639
that's all right i wonder if he's not here why aren't you upset um i mean do i if you want to

2309
04:28:23,639 --> 04:28:31,290
watch me upset just rewind the vaude by like 15 to 20 minutes and watch me just absolutely call

2310
04:28:31,290 --> 04:28:36,479
out every single thing i don't like about this game it's the hardest game at walmart yeah it is

2311
04:28:39,579 --> 04:28:44,780
we were okay we talked there was a lot of back and forth about what i said during dark souls

2312
04:28:44,780 --> 04:28:51,020
3 i believe i talked about how fucking impossible the game was the game is so hard it's too hard

2313
04:28:51,979 --> 04:28:57,500
and i said it was the hardest game i was like it's the hardest game ever made it's like the hardest

2314
04:28:57,500 --> 04:29:02,780
game you can buy whatever and people are like oh dude what about like boshi and i was like okay

2315
04:29:02,780 --> 04:29:07,100
fine so it's like the heart it we came to the conclusion that it's the hardest fucking game

2316
04:29:07,100 --> 04:29:14,139
at walmart okay it's the hardest game at target okay it's not like some crazy like impossible

2317
04:29:14,139 --> 04:29:20,239
game that was made it's but it's what do you want me to say it was sakiro yeah it was sakiro

2318
04:29:20,239 --> 04:29:32,809
not dark souls 3 it was sakiro and sakiro was fucking brutal this is open now you've received

2319
04:29:32,809 --> 04:29:42,489
the wisdom of the two fingers have you oh this guy will talk to me now you like this more than

2320
04:29:42,489 --> 04:29:46,219
sakiro

2321
04:29:53,420 --> 04:29:55,239
i like okay

2322
04:30:02,000 --> 04:30:05,200
i need to see a few more of the bosses like some of the main story bosses

2323
04:30:07,120 --> 04:30:14,350
because as it stands right now the first two like main story bosses i feel like we're very

2324
04:30:14,350 --> 04:30:20,110
similar i want to see more before i have an opinion of like the bosses in this game

2325
04:30:20,989 --> 04:30:34,639
there's a story yeah okay so what are you after more great ruins then as your fellow allow me to

2326
04:30:34,639 --> 04:30:43,559
dive all your little knowledge the inheritors of the heroes boss fights were crazy and the

2327
04:30:43,559 --> 04:30:49,959
thing about sakiro was like you like the revive feature was very interesting even though the game

2328
04:30:49,959 --> 04:30:55,739
was really difficult and it was really brutal like in fact you come back to life like two

2329
04:30:55,819 --> 04:30:58,540
three times sometimes was really that was really forgiving

2330
04:31:03,549 --> 04:31:16,670
gorilla yeah that's crazy queen of the full moon you'll still be after more great ruins

2331
04:31:16,670 --> 04:31:21,319
but those are all the people that have the great ruins but this is where i need to ask

2332
04:31:21,319 --> 04:31:27,950
where they are i heard about the academy understand you've been speaking to me wait no

2333
04:31:27,950 --> 04:31:38,639
she's my daughter when she lost the guidance of grace youthful curricular purposes so i put her

2334
04:31:38,639 --> 04:31:45,239
to work do not hesitate to employ her despite her looks she is more than capable in the press

2335
04:31:45,239 --> 04:31:55,930
of battle godric the grafted lord of stormvale despite being the blood of godfrey first elven

2336
04:31:55,930 --> 04:32:02,750
lord he's a grotesque old fool his castle lies upon the cliff to limb graves northwest okay

2337
04:32:02,750 --> 04:32:09,399
but i suspect you know that well enough already because he's dead all right where i want to hear

2338
04:32:09,399 --> 04:32:17,979
about the academy because that's where i want to go that's the sorcerer academy general radars he

2339
04:32:17,979 --> 04:32:26,200
fought millennia to a stand house to lim gray hailed wilds lindgrave east has been engulfed by

2340
04:32:26,200 --> 04:32:32,360
the scarlet rot even approaching the region is no mean feat i've heard survivors of radon's army

2341
04:32:32,360 --> 04:32:40,270
are still in the wilds okay east and if it's true i said oh i doubt he much resembles his former

2342
04:32:40,270 --> 04:32:49,790
self then i want to know where are this person is the grace given his lord of laindale it lies

2343
04:32:49,790 --> 04:32:54,110
at the foot of the earth what are their retreat nope east of the altus plateau but the two fingers

2344
04:32:54,110 --> 04:33:00,110
forbid us from venturing there why until we've acquired enough great runes to repair the elven

2345
04:33:00,110 --> 04:33:06,189
ring set your sights elsewhere for the time being so that's like a hard boss where's this person

2346
04:33:07,150 --> 04:33:17,599
no no no not you the academy okay that's where i want to go

2347

2356
04:35:46,139 --> 04:35:51,740
in a row you just can't swing that many times in a row we have to all play by the same rules

04:39:53,840 --> 04:39:59,919
hiding in this place like okay i thought it was just a balcony i don't think there was a guy

2372
04:39:59,919 --> 04:40:05,680
sitting against the wall dressed dressed as the guy in the painting and he's wearing the clothes

2377
04:41:42,650 --> 04:41:48,060

05:24:52,459 --> 05:25:00,909
through another elevator all right i'm actually starting to get confused because this is like

2516
05:25:00,909 --> 05:25:36,880
the third elevator i think i may have missed something oh my god that was just streamer

2517
05:25:36,880 --> 05:25:43,580
syndrome i didn't want to have to go back down because i was going to look over and people are

2518
05:25:43,580 --> 05:25:47,900
going to be like dude this guy's got zero object permanence like this guy sucks like really dude

2519
05:25:47,900 --> 05:25:50,779
you have to do you have to go up and down the elevator three times to know where to go

2520
05:25:51,340 --> 05:25:58,599
and i was like oh shit like people are gonna think i'm stupid so i have to i don't even know

2521
05:25:58,599 --> 05:26:15,500
where that is um where the fuck do i go marika you fool what i wouldn't is marika what is it

2522
05:26:15,500 --> 05:26:33,720
marika is the statue what marika is the statue i don't remember how to get there

2523
05:26:34,279 --> 05:26:42,349
it was like i jumped through here i went down i went down twice i think right it's not wait

2524
05:26:42,349 --> 05:26:50,319
it's not there i went down here and then it's down i jumped in the middle went down again

2526
05:27:19,319 --> 05:27:32,330
middle but hold on i didn't let me see what's down here though i'm not gonna die large glintstone

2527
05:27:32,330 --> 05:27:52,220
scrap what is this for oh wait there could be a hole right here you know what i'm saying

2528
05:27:56,919 --> 05:28:03,549
somebody's gonna attack me right they would have done something like that okay so that was worth

2529
05:28:03,549 --> 05:28:14,279

2530
05:28:14,279 --> 05:28:35,979
can i okay i'm a little more interested in this weapon now the only problem is good luck doing

2531
05:28:35,979 --> 05:28:43,209
that at any boss encounter in any game ever all right zero object permanence uh i believe

2532
05:28:43,209 --> 05:29:24,830
it's on this side i want to see the range critical miss i just want to see what the

2533
05:29:24,830 --> 05:29:45,659
item does okay finally finally finally finally let me get this let me jump over here

2537
05:30:51,689 --> 05:30:56,110

2538
05:30:56,750 --> 05:31:02,189
right here the limb grave tunnels there's plenty of materials for you to gather to be able to

2539
05:31:02,189 --> 05:31:23,360
upgrade at least two or three times there's a guy in there this guy's fucked are you ready for this

2540
05:31:24,319 --> 05:31:30,569
i'm gonna aggro this guy and then i'm gonna run back here and go up the elevator and he's gonna

2541
05:31:30,569 --> 05:32:19,159
drop down and die i'm getting ready preparing to escape oh i can't fuck i can't i can't boys

2542
05:32:19,799 --> 05:32:49,369
i have no mana left what an idiot what a fucking idiotic thing to do what is that

2543
05:32:57,709 --> 05:33:08,360
it's so hard to tell what he's doing one more time okay easy game is not even a hard game

2544
05:33:10,009 --> 05:33:25,819
rare medallion raw medallion that was cool what a cool little dungeon

2545
05:33:28,810 --> 05:33:37,520
anyone that's smithing stones i'm just i really am i need to like settle down i'm burnt okay i'm

2546
05:33:37,520 --> 05:33:46,240
burning like 30 extra energy by like being loud and weird i need to like i gotta settle down

2547
05:33:46,880 --> 05:33:57,389
i'm being too like loud i'm burning extra energy okay there's nothing else here is that a

2548
05:34:04,720 --> 05:34:25,369
is that a i a war thing one of those war things not what is it roars and breath attacks

2549
05:34:26,009 --> 05:34:47,180
oh man man i feel like i'm burning calories is watching you but you are it's like for an hour

2550
05:34:47,180 --> 05:34:53,959
but you are that was really cool all right i love the little random dungeons man that's the best

2551
05:34:53,959 --> 05:35:00,279
part of the whole game i know the bosses in these souls games from software games are the best part

2552
05:35:00,279 --> 05:35:05,979
everyone's like oh i love the bosses uh-uh not on this one i think the main story bosses are like

2553
05:35:06,860 --> 05:35:10,860
all the way down to the bottom versus like exploring the open world and finding a cool

2554
05:35:10,860 --> 05:35:24,040
little dungeon that is way way cooler to me now bought that the huge main story campaign bosses

2555
05:35:24,040 --> 05:35:29,500
so far i've been all right they've been cool but that's having little dungeons like that

2556
05:35:30,220 --> 05:35:33,500
that take like 30 40 minutes and there's like a little mini boss at the end

2557
05:35:34,299 --> 05:35:46,560
i find that way more interesting to me right now like going and exploring the

2558
05:35:46,560 --> 05:35:58,009
the like go okay first coming to the lake right there's like oh shit i'm at the lake

2559
05:35:59,419 --> 05:36:05,610
oh here's a good here's a guy here right it's cool there's a dungeon go find the thing at the end

2560
05:36:06,409 --> 05:36:20,490
there's a few more places i want to see but i really probably should get out of here

2561
05:36:21,610 --> 05:36:34,889
and go explore something else collect these don't wait our flies or those bats the bats

2562
05:36:47,119 --> 05:37:02,619

2563
05:37:02,619 --> 05:37:06,220

2792
06:37:35,529 --> 06:37:43,580
about the last like the last like three or four bosses i've bought without sorcery i'm a battle

2797
06:39:02,439 --> 06:39:19,659
gameplay um i've been called a few different things yeah all right so what was the point

2798
06:39:19,659 --> 06:39:29,979
is another ladder it's actually another ladder right there come on something good something

2799
06:39:29,979 --> 06:39:37,180
worth coming up here for arrows sting talisman that seems probably like extra damage on range

2800
06:39:37,180 --> 06:40:00,080
but let's see what's up here uh is it what is it yeah okay whiz raises attack power of sorcery

2801
06:40:00,080 --> 06:40:16,200
spells still cool coming up here all right it's time to go back to limb grave it's time to take

2802
06:40:16,200 --> 06:40:28,880
a break and i'm gonna i want to go this way i think either here or here this is like the spawn

2803
06:40:30,380 --> 06:40:36,779
and i need to wait a minute hold on wait wait wait is it time to i actually go back and do

2804
06:40:36,779 --> 06:41:00,750
this how many um it's two stones to go in the one at spawn right so if it's two stones to go back to

2805
06:41:00,750 --> 06:41:12,569
the it's four thousand to buy one i have one i could go like here and go like down this way

2806
06:41:12,569 --> 06:41:20,919
essentially right let me try that first though let me let me farm just i will take a break after

2807
06:41:20,919 --> 06:41:27,580
this i'm gonna farm a fight here get enough to buy one go open the one at spawn see what's in there

2811
06:42:25,080 --> 06:42:31,259
waiting for one of you to die i don't care who this is gonna be worth like a thousand you gotta

06:42:31,259 --> 06:42:55,040
get the boys out all right sure why not let's get the boys out here and then we come in and

2813
06:42:55,040 --> 06:43:11,369

2814
06:43:16,939 --> 06:43:22,220
hey don't blame me blame the game that lets me get uh experience points when i don't do anything

2815
06:43:22,939 --> 06:44:07,720
work smarter not harder i got way too complacent okay 3d 30 35 000 out of mana we're almost there

2816
06:44:07,720 --> 06:44:23,119
one all right let me just switch to this get a couple of stabs in i am on no one's team

2817
06:44:23,840 --> 06:44:46,830
such a dude i'm such a dick i have like all the cheat codes i'm not supposed to be here

2818
06:44:53,639 --> 06:45:02,840
so bad okay let's go i've got enough souls i can buy it we're gonna see some cool content here you

2819
06:45:02,840 --> 06:45:15,599
ready anybody drop anything who sells this shit something this guy does right somebody does

2820
06:45:16,319 --> 06:45:31,470
who sells them you do right you're the person in team fortress too when everybody on both teams

2821
06:45:31,470 --> 06:45:36,590
is trying to chill and hang out and you the one guy that come in and ruin everything yeah i just

2822
06:45:36,590 --> 06:45:45,150
like i just boom boom drop an entire magazine or entire clip of stickies in the room and then sit

2823
06:45:45,150 --> 06:45:56,639
there and go and just watch the kill feed have like five names on it fucking dick who's this

2824
06:46:10,520 --> 06:46:21,470
should be left well should you spy a mariner unless you wish to lay down your life in vain

2825
06:46:21,470 --> 06:46:29,709
those who live in death should be left or more should you buy a mariner whatever that means

2826
06:46:31,639 --> 06:46:38,439
okay i'm gonna buy one of those things and then we are gonna go from there to

2827
06:46:40,459 --> 06:46:46,060
the spawn of the game i'm gonna put both keys in and we're gonna see what happens

2828
06:46:47,159 --> 06:47:06,169
actually pretty excited this actually seems pretty cool very excited let's do it uh it's

2829
06:47:06,169 --> 06:47:15,130
like right here right first step right is it two it's three no it's not it's it i thought it was

2830
06:47:15,130 --> 06:47:30,240
two it's actually three it's three yeah people no no i'll get down here we'll i'll get down

2831
06:47:30,240 --> 06:48:02,279
here and we'll figure it out where is it bro i gotta go pee i know i know man i know one moment

2832
06:48:02,279 --> 06:48:18,349
i'm gonna get the bonfire there it is okay i'm gonna open it rest here open it see what the

2833
06:48:18,349 --> 06:48:23,959
hell is down here actually no this will be when we come back because i want this thing to be a

2834
06:48:23,959 --> 06:48:32,779
big reveal all right let's go pee i'll be right back um how long have i been streaming for because

2835
06:48:32,779 --> 06:48:38,490
i'm streaming tomorrow too how long has it been six hours all right we're gonna go for like another

2836
06:48:38,490 --> 06:48:46,520
hour or two and then i'll be live again tomorrow with more elden ring make sure you loop the music

2837
06:48:46,520 --> 06:52:19,400
i will play uh we'll play a different one when you guys are recognized right back don't be time

2838
06:52:19,400 --> 06:52:27,439
to see what's over here great beginning of the game very excited i feel really bad if there's

2839
06:52:28,880 --> 06:52:33,360
frostbolt bolts down here i'm gonna be incredibly upset about it

2840
06:52:40,009 --> 06:52:50,970
okay very cool that song is absolutely but what's the word i'm looking for dope

2841
06:52:51,689 --> 06:53:09,290
seriously that song is dope okay let's do it use the keys

2842
06:53:12,159 --> 06:53:46,840
what we got that poisonous it is poison oh shit it's poison

2843
06:54:00,159 --> 06:54:16,479
oh scope looks like we are a little bit of a poison shaggy is just morty for freaking morty

2844
06:54:16,479 --> 06:54:31,900
what was that you see that that was just like a car driving god um did i miss anything back here

2845
06:54:31,900 --> 06:54:40,479
this poison is going to stay on the whole time but what can i do i'm not saying character wise

2846
06:54:40,479 --> 06:54:48,169
they're the same i'm saying that vocally they are pretty similar now what can i slide down here

2847
06:54:48,169 --> 06:55:09,560
when does it stop what the fuck turned and bumped into me and they killed me okay piece of shit

2848
06:55:19,229 --> 06:55:23,470
so there's probably a rhyme or reason for me to be able to actually just go like this and run really

2849
06:55:23,470 --> 06:55:27,709
fast and not have the poison build up fast enough maybe jumping will slow it down it does not

2850
06:55:27,709 --> 06:55:37,849
just run before it fills up all the way and i should be okay and i am okay what do i do about

2851
06:55:37,849 --> 06:55:46,639
this i think you just follow it down what exactly what i'm gonna do i thought there was gonna be a

2852
06:55:46,639 --> 06:56:00,439
slide i thought i was gonna just like start sliding down anything over here there's a way down all

2853
06:56:00,439 --> 06:56:05,290
the way they guys have to keep going well there's gonna be an item in one of these what a bad time

2854
06:56:05,290 --> 06:56:19,529
to leave i gotta check every one of these holes because you know there's gonna be an item in one

2855
06:56:19,529 --> 06:56:42,520
of them it has to be hello okay hello why was that guy so magical i don't have enough

2856
06:56:42,520 --> 06:57:25,439
am i safe here or it's not i thought there was going to be a second one on the other side going

2857
06:57:25,439 --> 06:57:43,680
up and down i didn't think that one changed tracks oh well

2858
06:57:59,659 --> 06:58:13,819
ah you gotta love those dungeons right you gotta love those dungeons i will eventually okay i just

2859
06:58:13,819 --> 06:58:24,569
have to be patient just be patient and stop doing that stuff i know there's no items on any of the

2860
06:58:24,569 --> 06:58:52,430
ledges or anything so i can just run through there's a guy in this one no there's a bow and arrow

2861
06:58:53,069 --> 06:59:10,090
yep this guy here guy comes over here yep i think i remember that okay so now

2862
06:59:11,049 --> 06:59:18,569
i just gotta keep going just run turn the corner run go this thing does not stop i need to find

2863
06:59:18,569 --> 06:59:36,590
another little uh place to go right here let me get a good look first i'm not just running down

2864
06:59:36,590 --> 06:59:47,479
there how far does it go does it go all the way around no it stays here that doesn't seem like

2865
06:59:47,479 --> 07:00:04,040
very far is there another safe zone what the fuck are you what i'm trying to spell the sprint button

2866
07:00:04,919 --> 07:00:30,139
what the guy just fucking killed himself he just fucking jumped onto the tracks

2867
07:01:08,959 --> 07:01:17,200
i thought it hit me what did it was a foul ball what was that weird foul ball was it did it bump

2868
07:01:17,200 --> 07:02:09,279
into my sword and i think my sword hit me in the head oh man is so there's more dude okay uh

2869
07:02:10,000 --> 07:02:27,040
where's the next place to go i don't see another place to go it's right there

2870
07:02:28,430 --> 07:02:32,590
do i follow it down i think i have to follow this down because i'm not gonna have enough time to

2871
07:02:32,590 --> 07:02:40,189
run down that whole way i gotta follow it down run run run run run run run run run run run run

2872
07:02:40,189 --> 07:03:23,099
run i gotta follow it down pretending is exhausting okay but i had the right idea

2873
07:03:23,099 --> 07:03:38,110
just i didn't i caught the lip you piece of shit i probably could run all the way to the second

2874
07:03:38,110 --> 07:04:16,490
thing i can just facing in and out of reality horseshit all right turn just go down i know

2875
07:04:16,490 --> 07:04:39,259
where to go from here and then just follow it down wham hurry up hurry up just keep going

2876
07:04:39,819 --> 07:05:22,830
you had it keep going am i gonna die here the fucking camera sucks okay so you have to go

2877
07:05:23,709 --> 07:05:32,220
you gotta just keep going okay so when you turn you just have to run all the way to the bottom

2878
07:05:32,220 --> 07:05:46,040
i get it okay this is the one i'm gonna get to the bottom just keep going after that corner yeah i'm

2879
07:05:46,040 --> 07:05:50,439
just literally just gonna run just run run run run run after that corner just keep going all the

2880
07:05:50,439 --> 07:05:55,709
way down run past the bridge and i'll be out of there it's the last one i promise i'm gonna get

2881
07:05:55,709 --> 07:06:28,479
it here this is it this is the one this is the last one no don't push me into it don't push me

2882
07:06:28,479 --> 07:06:41,849
into it all right this is the one here we go this is it ready when it goes up okay when it goes up

2883
07:06:41,849 --> 07:06:52,799
i'm running for my life all the way don't stop don't stop don't stop don't stop go go go go go

2884
07:06:52,799 --> 07:07:08,319
go go go go go go go go go go go no stopping run run run run run run run run go go go go

2885
07:07:08,959 --> 07:07:15,819
safe zone safe zone no keep going keep going keep going it's not here yet

2886
07:07:21,869 --> 07:07:44,439
uh um what where am i where do i go hey where is it where is it oh shit it's still following me

2887
07:07:44,439 --> 07:08:20,810
should i go i don't know what to do oh it's hard to tell it goes all the way down there's a little

2888
07:08:20,810 --> 07:08:26,669
thing on the right i think i can just sneak into the thing on the right and let's see that little

2889
07:08:26,669 --> 07:09:02,810
like uh nudge sticking out i think i just would go down there i think so is there a bonfire down

2890
07:09:02,810 --> 07:09:16,700
here this is a boss down here are you kidding me there's no bonfire or anything i can respawn

2891
07:09:16,700 --> 07:10:23,709
here let's go who's down here what the fuck holy shit holy shit this thing's crazy all right

2892
07:10:23,709 --> 07:10:41,119
so let me see put the headphones in let me see if he does he has like these like i'm thinking stay

2893
07:10:41,119 --> 07:10:50,919
in his back stay in his hind legs he's just so big he takes up the whole room yeah it's definitely

2894
07:10:50,919 --> 07:11:34,080
right it's definitely his back damn so i don't know this is such a tiny little area you still

2895
07:11:34,080 --> 07:11:39,880
have the shitty default shield from the tutorial i don't know i don't i don't what can i block

2896
07:11:40,759 --> 07:12:01,900
maybe this is a block fight i think you honestly i think you just stay right behind him stay right

2897
07:12:01,900 --> 07:12:18,490
at his ass i'm thinking try to stay behind him his tail kind of swings around not look that

2898
07:12:18,490 --> 07:12:25,840
effective i had the right idea i think is just try to stay and i'm i'm not doing there's no time

2899
07:12:25,840 --> 07:12:31,200
for spells here this really sucks because i cannot change the allocation i have to beat him with four

2900
07:12:31,200 --> 07:12:38,009
blasts boys don't work down here i can't even summon the boys even if i wanted to what am i

2901
07:12:38,009 --> 07:13:33,659
talking about here they come jesus dude this guy is just a fucking slob he's one of those bosses

2902
07:13:33,659 --> 07:13:43,180
that you don't know what he's attacking when he's just moving his body it's the fucking tail the

2903
07:13:43,180 --> 07:14:00,959
tail is sensitive you know what i mean like which one of those is attacked and which one is this guy

2904
07:14:00,959 --> 07:14:29,639
just moving around the room i think it's the tail someone's rotten stray spirit let's try that

2905
07:14:30,279 --> 07:14:39,560
here is rotten spirit versus rotten spirit might be about the flask it yeah well let's let's see i

2906
07:14:39,560 --> 07:15:11,209
mean this guy's insane so there's no distance really let me see maybe the belly this guy's

2907
07:15:11,290 --> 07:15:59,310
fucking ridiculous it's not the face dude what come on i mean how do you even how do you even

2908
07:15:59,869 --> 07:16:09,470
decide when he's gonna attack how are you supposed to even know he this this this dude is just

2909
07:16:10,110 --> 07:16:27,080
crazy are the flaws they're so under leveled though and what about maybe distance maybe this

2910
07:16:27,080 --> 07:16:39,799
is better i can at least see what he's doing right i think that's the play i really do

2911
07:16:40,520 --> 07:17:04,799
i think this uh boss is uh like 10 bosses try sorcery i don't think i'm ready for this dude

2912
07:17:04,799 --> 07:17:13,560
he's crazy let's let me try sorcery and just like run away can i two hand the staff can i two hand

2913
07:17:13,560 --> 07:17:22,159
the staff and that's how you charge i wonder if i can do something weird here hold on let me two

2914
07:17:22,159 --> 07:17:46,139
hand stuff and i actually doesn't work doesn't seem particularly weak to it either well now i

2915
07:17:46,139 --> 07:18:03,310
don't have a weapon i will block your attacks best bet but spam heavy attacks with the uh with the

2916
07:18:03,310 --> 07:18:24,159
rip here are you you're just punching the dude that's worth it i think it's worth it let's try

2926
07:20:51,200 --> 07:21:19,240
i cannot damn he still hit me with it no fucking way no way that's not happening

2927

2935
07:25:01,439 --> 07:25:21,900
because i'm gonna do it especially with this uh with this build all in health potions i could

2936
07:25:21,900 --> 07:25:25,419
go get health potions only and then but i have to make the whole trek back down here

2937
07:25:26,139 --> 07:26:48,560
i ain't coming back down to this piece of shit he's dead now fuck that up sorry no fuck all right

2938
07:26:48,560 --> 07:27:35,240
when does he do this like 50 i got an unbind crouch worst fucking thing in the whole game

2939
07:27:35,240 --> 07:27:48,779
seriously like honest to god that's such a bad place for that like that happened to like unbind

2940
07:27:48,779 --> 07:27:57,849
left stick and rebind it like stop squeezing the controller do you see the game this is not

2941
07:27:57,849 --> 07:28:08,029
like mario party this is not mario party 2 the what how are you not supposed to what i'm not

2942
07:28:08,029 --> 07:28:18,860
sitting here like oh wow watch out watch out for the mushroom i'm gripping this thing like

2943
07:28:18,860 --> 07:28:28,909
it's fucking about to strangle me i'll get this i'm fucking beating this boss you bet your ass i am

2944
07:28:32,220 --> 07:28:46,830
i don't need full estus i don't need it i think i broke my audio cable audio is only coming out

2945
07:28:46,830 --> 07:28:55,529
of one ear it's weird okay i got it i got this motherfucker right now i forgot to unbind it

2946
07:28:56,090 --> 07:29:22,840
just kill me you know okay you know how they make it not awful is if you have to hold it for like a

2947
07:29:22,840 --> 07:29:30,110
full second like if it was like hold left stick for like one crouch it's like who's crouching in

2948
07:29:30,110 --> 07:29:40,110
any of these fights i'm gonna give the fucking boys a call on this one you better believe it

2949
07:29:40,110 --> 07:29:57,229
you better believe that i'm giving them a ring a ding ding not be fuck what i just do

2950
07:30:02,779 --> 07:30:13,200
fuck settle down stop swearing all right let's go boys bring him up it takes too long to cast it

2951
07:30:13,200 --> 07:30:27,959
it's not worth it it takes way too long to cast it's just guaranteed to get hit

2952
07:30:43,259 --> 07:30:48,540
yeah it's a waste of time you have to literally go like this ding he's literally got you in his

2953
07:30:48,540 --> 07:31:01,709
mouth already do it on the second phase it's not a bad time to do it but like if i just focus and

2954
07:31:01,709 --> 07:31:47,560
just fucking go hit him in his gut all right quiet quiet i knew he was gonna do it fuck you i

2955
07:31:47,560 --> 07:32:04,650
wasn't even there fuck that you don't have any time to fucking do that at all you get there's

2956
07:32:04,650 --> 07:32:29,209
no time to run at least i know what time he does it don't do it again man oh it's so slow

2957
07:32:34,650 --> 07:32:41,759
wait he blows up more than once i thought that was just like a i'm going to phase two now

2958
07:32:43,400 --> 07:32:48,759
walking on sucks because like it locks onto one central point and you might you can't get close

2959
07:32:48,759 --> 07:33:24,799
enough sometimes between each phase doesn't he only have two and settle down too you know

2960
07:33:24,799 --> 07:33:31,869
what's really killing me is the stamina i just don't have enough just like if i had like 10

2961
07:33:31,869 --> 07:33:45,020
plus more points in stamina maybe this would be like much much easier to do we see your heart rate

2962
07:33:45,020 --> 07:34:15,659
um start like 280 i don't like walking on i got him pretty close a few times ago but i

2963
07:34:16,380 --> 07:34:43,180
i'm just i'm just not supposed to be here and what's five out of ten decide to do you

2964
07:34:43,180 --> 07:35:19,229
burn all your cooldowns all right here comes phase one phase one incoming phase one outgoing

2965
07:35:19,229 --> 07:35:37,209
phase one outgoing not yet when phase one outgoing where is it he should have done it by now

2966
07:35:37,770 --> 07:36:25,319
why isn't he doing it what the fuck's happening fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you he does it twice

2967
07:36:39,419 --> 07:37:09,959
yes god damn it if i just had a little bit more attack power just a little bit more

2968
07:37:10,840 --> 07:37:19,720
the fucking flasks are killing me i got this i really do i've got this it's the four fucking

2969
07:37:19,720 --> 07:37:26,650
flasks i'm about to go back and just put the two in and just run back down here like i have this

2970
07:37:26,650 --> 07:38:16,319
stupid goddamn mage shit class i have four heels oh my god it's so frustrating

2971
07:38:16,959 --> 07:38:25,200
i wish there was a fucking bonfire down here just give me my two other flask and this guy is

2972
07:38:25,200 --> 07:38:34,319
dead all right three more attempts if i can't beat them then i'm gonna go bonfire get two more

2973
07:38:34,319 --> 07:38:40,720
flasks no this one doesn't count this this this piece of shit i'm literally talking and he has the

2974
07:38:40,720 --> 07:39:02,810
balls to fucking attack me while i'm talking how come you guys are counting to 10 why because you

2975
07:39:02,810 --> 07:40:05,439
know what even upgrading the 2020 hindsight man is he gonna do it dude and i was ready for it too

2976
07:40:24,560 --> 07:40:55,900
what i didn't dodge through him i'm fucked i'm fucked here tail swipe sucks

2977
07:40:58,509 --> 07:41:04,909
that tail swipe is like holy shit man he likes spins but you think he's gonna go up but he

2978
07:41:04,909 --> 07:41:12,700
just doesn't and he'll just swipe you with the tail all right this is the last try before i get

2979
07:41:12,700 --> 07:41:18,110
more heels and i'm i what i was gonna say is 2020 hindsight claws were the thing to upgrade

2980
07:41:18,750 --> 07:41:45,959
unfortunately even if you try to dodge through it like sometimes this one's okay this one doesn't

2981
07:41:45,959 --> 07:41:53,659
count like i i have to try to beat him now because there's no way i'm gonna come back here later and

2982
07:41:53,659 --> 07:42:58,590
like remember all this bullshit this idiot does it's just it's just like just way too hard for the

2983
07:42:58,590 --> 07:43:01,790
level a and it sucks because i don't want to come all the fucking way back down here

2984
07:43:16,830 --> 07:46:23,419
were you here were you in the room were you in the fucking room

2985
07:46:32,509 --> 07:47:03,159
oh it feels good to beat that motherfucker coming in dance roof 2020 hindsight these gloves i should

2986
07:47:03,159 --> 07:47:16,220
have i should have upgraded them oh oh my god it feels good so what was that is that a new

2987
07:47:16,220 --> 07:47:25,470
thing summoned spirit of the banished knight oleg oh dude we've got a new best friend here

2988
07:47:25,470 --> 07:47:34,360

2989
07:47:37,500 --> 07:47:51,040
oh man is he gonna be sick he's a hundred fp i'll be honest i thought i was dead i thought i

2990
07:47:51,040 --> 07:47:56,720
he did that did you see that bullshit he did the exploding thing that wasn't a phase change that's

2991
07:47:56,720 --> 07:48:02,330
just a thing that he can do that bastard just does that move normally i don't think that's

2992
07:48:02,330 --> 07:48:16,939
a phase change he did it like three more times you've got your gamer license renewed you missed

2993
07:48:16,939 --> 07:48:20,779
the last tail thing you didn't dodge it i think i was too close to his stomach so the tail just

2994
07:48:20,779 --> 07:48:33,229
didn't i just got lucky at the end all right i'm probably gonna have to say that's probably where

2995
07:48:33,229 --> 07:48:37,630
i'm gonna call it for today because i need to go eat food and go take like a cold shower because

2996
07:48:37,630 --> 07:48:50,590

3058
08:04:17,340 --> 08:04:22,939
everything that was awesome it was fun i really wish i knew what this guy was because i've wasted

3059
08:04:22,939 --> 08:05:10,090
like 15 000 souls being an idiot how do i rate the game so far uh 9.4 oh summon oleg let's see

3060
08:05:10,090 --> 08:05:16,909
what he looks like yeah uh i'm gonna have to reduce points i would okay when i first opened up

3061
08:05:17,470 --> 08:05:20,750
okay after the first like four or five hours of the game i would say it was probably like holy

3062
08:05:20,750 --> 08:05:30,029
shit this is a 9.8 i point seven uh i need to see some of the most the story bosses

3063
08:05:30,669 --> 08:05:35,259
because the first two story bosses really kind of looked kind of like the same guy

3064
08:05:35,259 --> 08:05:40,540
and they had similar really similar moves um all the other side boss stuff has been incredible

3065
08:05:40,540 --> 08:05:49,240
but i want to see some more of the main story bosses um because they kind of the first two were

3066
08:05:49,240 --> 08:05:56,520
very very similar uh but this game apparently has a shitload of bosses in a ton of places to go and

3067
08:05:56,520 --> 08:06:06,159
see i mean i i mean it's i think it's phenomenal i think it's absolutely phenomenal game i think

3068
08:06:06,159 --> 08:06:15,279
it's really good uh i also some of the controls are a little weird if i'm honest and the more that

3069
08:06:15,279 --> 08:06:23,340
like i get frustrated by controls the more the more that i might you know like the left stick

3070
08:06:23,340 --> 08:06:27,099
thing has really kind of been annoying if i'm completely blunt it really i mean i know it's

3071
08:06:27,099 --> 08:06:32,619
like well just don't press it as hard but i mean it's still like it kind of happens all the time

3072
08:06:33,419 --> 08:06:39,099
uh just by simply moving too far to the left or right of your controller and sometimes just

3073
08:06:39,099 --> 08:06:46,110
have it hit if you guys pick up a like an xbox controller or a ps4 ps5 controller hold it hold

3074
08:06:46,110 --> 08:06:51,069
in your hands and like move all the way to the right and if you're like trying to move and dodge

3075
08:06:51,069 --> 08:06:56,349
it's way easier to push the stick in when you're all the way to the right or all the way to the

3076
08:06:56,349 --> 08:07:01,840
left on the stick you know what i mean like i'm talking like this like you hold the button like

3077
08:07:01,840 --> 08:07:07,680
this and you click like accidentally you don't really want to like just standing still like

3078
08:07:07,680 --> 08:07:12,400
yeah you don't like click it it's the pushing and like running and oops i clicked it happens a lot

3079
08:07:15,659 --> 08:07:22,000
but to be fair i don't know where else it could even go i really don't i don't know what that

3080
08:07:22,000 --> 08:07:27,310
would how else you map this if it's not on like a keyboard because they put a bunch of other stuff

3081
08:07:27,310 --> 08:07:37,259
in the game to have to use right so i don't know like how you make that better it's an xbox one

3082
08:07:37,259 --> 08:07:48,220
controller i wonder if maybe the xbox controller might be is it a little bit easier to accidentally

3083
08:07:48,220 --> 08:07:53,000
push it in if you put if you're pulling too hard i'm trying to think of how hard you have to push

3084
08:07:53,000 --> 08:08:04,619
in to actually with the ps5 controller addles would help yeah yeah that's actually a good point

3085
08:08:05,259 --> 08:08:11,259
all right oh like yeah before everybody leaves right i'll see you guys tomorrow though we're

3086
08:08:11,259 --> 08:08:16,880
gonna start uh we're gonna start at four tomorrow it's a 4 p.m pacific we're gonna continue elden

3087
08:08:16,880 --> 08:08:22,040
ring and then i probably i don't know if i'm gonna do four days in a row

3088
08:08:23,720 --> 08:08:27,720
because these streams have been really like beefy but we'll do we'll be tomorrow

3089
08:08:28,360 --> 08:08:34,459
i'll be live tomorrow pretty much all day and all night again and let's uh go attack something so

3090
08:08:34,459 --> 08:08:40,880
you can see oleg but to answer your question in a very long-winded uh way yes i think the

3091
08:08:40,880 --> 08:08:48,189
game is absolutely fucking phenomenal it's really really difficult though and that's a good thing

3092
08:08:48,189 --> 08:08:52,909
and it's a bad thing right like it's an amazing thing to like accomplish something but in the

3093
08:08:52,909 --> 08:09:01,610
moment sometimes it's just like it's i can't do it like palpatine right and it's still so much

3094
08:09:01,610 --> 08:09:08,700
more to see and so much more hard shit to do but the very final opinion you can really have

3095
08:09:09,580 --> 08:09:20,430
is like okay the game's too hard but eventually it isn't like eventually it isn't like once you

3096
08:09:20,430 --> 08:09:24,430
actually figure out what you're doing and you like study bosses and you stop making the same

3097
08:09:24,430 --> 08:09:30,700
mistakes you keep making and i still make them all the time um it's actually awesome how hard it is

3098
08:09:31,869 --> 08:09:37,130
but sometimes you kind of look at it and go like man did i really it took me like four hours to

3099
08:09:37,130 --> 08:09:42,569
beat that guy um something it's just like holy shit i feel i feel like i'm an incredibly

3100
08:09:42,569 --> 08:09:49,869
accomplished person um so it's great as much as you can feel sometimes like it's too much

3101
08:09:49,869 --> 08:09:59,979
i can't do it it's too fucking hard eventually it's not all souls games ever yes there you go

3102
08:09:59,979 --> 08:10:16,270
this is my take i need more fp i can't even cast this really how much fp do i have dude i need way

3103
08:10:16,270 --> 08:10:31,659
i need a i need to level up my mind i can't even cast it okay what's your take on frozen pizzas

3104
08:10:32,220 --> 08:10:39,099
well frozen pizzas are way way too hard um until they're not when you put it in the oven and you

3105
08:10:39,099 --> 08:10:44,779
spend some time uh seeing it and watching it cook and letting it do its thing for like 15 20

3106
08:10:44,779 --> 08:10:49,819
minutes and you understand that you need to cook it first um it comes out and it's very edible and

3107
08:10:49,819 --> 08:11:00,729
it's delicious i would say the same exact thing okay goodbye i'll see you guys tomorrow goodbye

3108
08:11:00,729 --> 08:11:30,189
