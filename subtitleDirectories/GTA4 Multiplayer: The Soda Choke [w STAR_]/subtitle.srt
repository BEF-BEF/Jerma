1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,219
We're gonna go with- we're gonna go with like tiers. We're gonna go like building to building. See if you can eventually get me-

2
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:10,890
No, no, stand still, stand still.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:27,129
I can't believe it.

4
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,090
Oh, you ruined my keyboard.

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
Hold on. Seriously, wait.

6
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,530
Oh my god, I spit that everywhere. I came- I-

7
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,530
Shit, hold on for- hold on a second.

8
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:51,820
Hold on a second.

9
00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:02,060
Whoa.

10
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,689
Yeah.

11
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,180
No, no more stupid trucks. No.

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,180
It's funny because like, you couldn't even see them. You could just hear their-

13
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,180
Always happens.

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,180
That's like- that's how you know here comes like the star truck punch line.

15
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,180
Cause you just hear it.

16
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,180
Good joke.

17
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,260
Here we go, let's try this one more time.

18
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,260
Wait till I get on it.

19
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,819
Wait till I get on it.

20
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,819
You're gonna ruin everything. Okay, ready?

21
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:33,019
Do it. One. Do it.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Oh, baby.

23
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:39,540
You made it?

24
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,540
Why did it?

25
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,719
Yeah, I made it.

26
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,150
But I did this like pancake.

27
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,150
I laid out flat like I have- I was gonna use my parachute and I just pancaked on the ground.

28
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,150
That was awesome though.

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,150
But you didn't die.

30
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,150
No, I'm up here. I made it.

31
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,159
I made it, man.

32
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,159
Alright, now try to get-

33
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:19,939
Idea.

34
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,939
You have no idea what he said.

35
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,849
Wow, this looks so interesting. I love Liberty City.

36
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,849
It looks so cool. I'm glad this was only a quarter.

37
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,199
No.

38
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,199
She didn't move.

39
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,199
Everybody's fine.

40
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,199
Everybody's fine.

41
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,199
Every single person.

42
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,199
She went back to re-

43
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,430
She went back to looking at the thing.

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Your character's like bent over laughing too.

45
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,439
What was that?

46
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:08,659
I can't believe that.

47
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:16,659
After all that, after all the chaos and a car smashing over there, she's like, oh my god.

48
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,659
Okay, let me go back to looking through this.

49
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,659
What was in those binoculars that was more interesting than this car going berserk?

50
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,020
Tunnel.

51
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,020
Ooh, a tunnel.

52
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,020
Ooh, a tunnel.

53
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Let's see how fast we can make it through the tunnel.

54
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:35,259
Whoa.

55
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:46,939
We made it.

56
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:47,939
We did it.

57
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,419
Whoa, is that like a destroyed bridge?

58
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,419
That's really cool.

59
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:54,419
Alright, you know what we just did?

60
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:55,419
Did you see that?

61
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:56,419
No.

62
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:00,030
What happened?

63
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,030
Okay, hold on.

64
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,030
On a more important note, remember Men in Black?

65
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,460
We just did the Men in Black, like go through the tunnel.

66
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:12,729
Go watch it.

67
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:13,729
You'll remember.

68
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:14,729
Was it Men in Black 2?

69
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,930
It was Men in Black 1, I believe.

70
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,730
It was when he was first showing in the car, and he's like, look son, this can do a bunch

71
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,730
of crazy stuff.

72
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,730
You better keep an eye out.

73
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,730
You better put your seatbelt on.

74
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,730
And Will Smith's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

75
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,730
Yeah, we just did that scene.

76
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,730
We just recreated that scene.

77
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,860
Get in.

78
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,860
Hold on a second.

79
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,860
Hold on.

80
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,860
Get in.

81
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,860
You just did like a complete magic trick right there.

82
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
Get in.

83
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,829
You were in this...

84
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:42,899
I can't.

85
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,899
I can't get in that thing unless...

86
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,339
Can I?

87
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:47,339
Hold on, stay there.

88
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:48,339
Don't move.

89
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,769
Don't...

90
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,060
That hit me...

91
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,060
This building is a magnet.

92
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,060
Dude, that hit me very, very hard in the face.

93
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,740
This tree...

94
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,829
This tree saved my life.

95
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:18,069
Remember guys, trees are stronger than steel going 500,000 miles per hour.

96
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,069
The Man of Steel?

97
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Are you serious?

98
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
What are you?

99
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,300
This is like a Stephen King movie.

100
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,300
You're just like sitting in this alley waiting for me?

101
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,300
Like seriously, I just turn the corner, jump down, and it's like...

102
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,610
What's the car's name?

103
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,980
Carrie?

104
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,980
No, what the hell is the car's name?

105
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,980
I think it's Johnny.

106
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,980
Johnny.

107
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:53,459
You see, I'm just getting better and better at cheating.

108
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,459
This old ass lady again.

109
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,459
In like the same spot.

110
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,459
This is the same spot.

111
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,459
She really is in the same spot.

112
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,459
This has got to be the same building.

113
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,459
Yeah, this is the same old lady.

114
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:05,459
You could have another conversation with her if you'd like.

115
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:06,459
Okay.

116
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:08,220
We'll do it again.

117
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,220
We'll do part two conversation with old lady.

118
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,220
She said, hold on, let me move.

119
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,220
Alright, she's in a good spot.

120
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,220
So, I remember last time I saw you, you got like wrecked by a car.

121
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,220
Do you have any thoughts about that?

122
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:29,970
How did you not hit me?

123
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,970
How did you miss me?

124
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,970
Hey, I'm getting good at cheating.

125
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,970
I don't understand how you hit her and not me.

126
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,970
Happy?
