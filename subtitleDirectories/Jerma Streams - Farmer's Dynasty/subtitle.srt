1
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:10,779
How you doing, everybody? Hope you're doing good.

2
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:16,500
Wait, hold on, hold on. My microphone's not here.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Hold on, my microphone's... I cleaned up my office.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Like, you remember, my microphone's like in a different place. Wait.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:01:01,969
I was wondering. I was like, I can see my voice over there, but it looks very low. It still does. I fucked it up.

6
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:20,700
Is that better? I think that's better. Alright, okay. Anyways.

7
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,900
Hi guys, welcome to the stream.

8
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:34,959
Yes, I know, I know. The only thing anybody can talk about right now is, dude, that half-life trailer.

9
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:44,060
I know. I haven't even seen it yet. I haven't watched it, and I'm not going to.

10
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:57,129
I'm kidding. Alright, alright. I haven't seen the trailer.

11
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:03,140
So I was thinking, you know, what if we like do a little bit of watch the video and watch it and react to it?

12
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,140
You know, like, that's what I'm gonna do.

13
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,500
We're gonna get a live, real reaction of not seeing the trailer.

14
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:17,289
The trailer's like a minute and fifteen seconds long, so it's not like we'll be here for a very long time.

15
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:23,229
And also, what we're doing today... I gotta take a step back.

16
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:28,229
Because think about the last week or so of streams. Dead Rising...

17
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:30,789
Or is this Stressful?

18
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:34,789
Dead Rising 2, super stressful, beat the game time limits and all that shit.

19
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:40,289
I have Sekiro, I think like a year ago. I'm still feeling that one.

20
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:44,129
I want to slow down a little.

21
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,129
Bombo was stressful. Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

22
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:50,620
So, we're gonna play Farmer's Dynasty.

23
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:58,979
I was gonna play Hand Simulator, but everybody made fun of me in the pre-stream chat.

24
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:04,539
It was like people were just making fun of me, so I was like, okay, I guess I'm not gonna play that one.

25
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,280
And yes, I am aware that this is not...

26
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,280
This is not like Farming Simulator 2019. This is Farmer's Dynasty.

27
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,280
It just released on Steam.

28
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,889
So, I don't know. I just...

29
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:29,259
I said it because I was being a dick.

30
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:31,259
And I was like, oh, I'm thinking about playing Hand Simulator.

31
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:36,259
Everyone's like, if you're Tuber, okay, Tuber, that's stupid, that game sucks meme.

32
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,259
And I was like, all right, fine, Farmer's Dynasty.

33
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,259
And all of a sudden, you know what happens.

34
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:47,080
Yeah, yeah, do that, yeah.

35
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:04,650
So, if you guys have not figured it out yet, pre-stream chat has a lot...

36
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,650
There's a lot of influence when I'm in that pre-stream chat.

37
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,740
There are like at least a couple hundred one-guy scenarios.

38
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
You want to be the one guy?

39
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,050
Go to the pre-stream chat when I'm just hanging out for 20, 30 minutes before the stream.

40
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:26,629
You get like a buff to your one-guy influence in the pre-stream chat.

41
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:34,579
But anyways, let's watch this trailer.

42
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:39,680
Well, that's not the trailer, but I'm going to put it over that.

43
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,540
Wait, are we going to be able to hear...

44
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,540
I'm going to turn the music down here.

45
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,060
No, there is no music. All right, that's fine.

46
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,689
Give me a second. All right, let's watch it. Let's see it.

47
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:55,689
I want to see it. I haven't seen it.

48
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:02,230
Put on face cam? I do not have a shirt on, so I'm not going to put on face cam.

49
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,230
It's not going to happen.

50
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:10,589
All right, I got the YouTube link.

51
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:11,959
This is the right one, right?

52
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,959
Okay, here's the problem. Whenever you have a game like this come out,

53
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:21,199
you know how many random potential Half-Life fan-made trailers there are?

54
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,199
Half-Life. Alex Vance.

55
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,199
Somebody could have made this as a machinima.

56
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,819
There's a lot of them.

57
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:31,899
Let me make sure I got the right one.

58
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:40,980
This is the right one, right?

59
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,500
I haven't fucking seen this.

60
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
I haven't seen this.

61
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,740
What the hell is that?

62
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,740
Who's breathing?

63
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,519
Is this part of the trailer?

64
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,519
No, no, no, no!

65
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,519
No, don't start it yet.

66
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,519
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

67
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,379
Fuck.

68
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,819
All right, hold on.

69
00:05:58,819 --> 00:05:59,819
Everyone slow down.

70
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,699
Hold on.

71
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:05,699
Wait, everybody wait.

72
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,699
Oh, I blew it.

73
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,699
I actually did blow it.

74
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:19,800
Okay, here we go.

75
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,300
I haven't seen this.

76
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Why is close captioning on?

77
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,459
Is this HD?

78
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,910
What's this?

79
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,910
360p.

80
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,980
1440p.

81
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,980
I can't do it.

82
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,980
My computer can't handle that.

83
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,980
All right, here we go.

84
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
I'm ready.

85
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,220
Three.

86
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,220
Two.

87
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,319
Three.

88
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,319
Two.

89
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,319
One.

90
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,319
Go.

91
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:58,579
I can turn the volume up.

92
00:06:58,579 --> 00:06:59,579
Three.

93
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:00,579
Two.

94
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:21,910
One.

95
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,910
I'm here.

96
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,149
So what's the plan?

97
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:25,149
We can get this weapon.

98
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,149
What we're doing here could change things forever.

99
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:33,060
There's no straight shot to the vault.

100
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,060
Electricity.

101
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,060
Electricity.

102
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,060
Find a way out.

103
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,060
Oh, more electricity.

104
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,550
I'm with you every step of the way.

105
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,550
Old guy.

106
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,990
You're going to need a gun.

107
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,990
It's unloaded now.

108
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,990
Nope.

109
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:57,230
They know you're coming.

110
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:05,259
You need to get out of here now.

111
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,259
Nice.

112
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:07,259
That looks cool.

113
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,259
Oh, God.

114
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,259
They've got Dad.

115
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:13,259
They're going to find out what he knows, and then they're going to kill him.

116
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,259
Oh, this is my father.

117
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:15,259
I never told you.

118
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:16,259
I couldn't.

119
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,259
I'm so sorry, baby.

120
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,259
You will not save him.

121
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:23,259
Alex Bams alone cannot prevent his fate.

122
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,259
Open your eyes, Harry.

123
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:38,529
Electricity.

124
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:48,179
Sweat is pouring down my fucking underarms right now.

125
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:55,009
My underarms are crying.

126
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:56,009
Yeah, I know.

127
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,009
I can't believe it.

128
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:01,009
I can't believe they got the default skin from Garry's Mod.

129
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:02,629
Wow.

130
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,629
I can't wait to play this.

131
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:10,220
VR only?

132
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,220
What?

133
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,230
What the?

134
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,230
That looks...

135
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,230
I don't know.

136
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:22,889
There's a lot of electricity, a lot of electric moves, a lot of electric puzzles.

137
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:23,889
I don't know.

138
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:24,889
It looks good.

139
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:25,889
It looks like it could be good.

140
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,889
It looks like it could be funny and interesting.

141
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:29,889
And the weapons look really great.

142
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:38,460
The way that you load the guns and everything.

143
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,460
It's that new controller.

144
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,460
It's going to be the new Knuckles controller.

145
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,460
And like, I'm going to have to get them because of how would you not get them?

146
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:55,779
Well, see, apparently I've been told that this is a full video game.

147
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:00,779
This is not just like a three hour Knuckles tech demo, right?

148
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:05,519
So this is like a 12 to 15 hour game.

149
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,100
That's the first time that's ever happened.

150
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:15,100
I don't think there has been a VR game that's like a full VR experience.

151
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
That's been more than like four or five hours.

152
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,940
Resident Evil 7?

153
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,940
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

154
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,940
I'm talking a only VR.

155
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,940
Only, only, only VR only.

156
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,870
Not Resident Evil 7.

157
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,870
You could play...

158
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,870
Resident Evil 7 was a game you could play on your PlayStation.

159
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,870
On your Xbox.

160
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,620
VR only.

161
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,399
Skyrim.

162
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,399
Did somebody just say Skyrim?

163
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,279
Yeah.

164
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,279
On the ninth time they released that game, you could play it in VR.

165
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,230
No, I'm talking ground up VR only.

166
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,049
You couldn't play Resident Evil 7 VR only.

167
00:10:56,049 --> 00:11:00,049
In fact, you could only play it on PlayStation VR for the first like six months.

168
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:04,059
Everybody on PC played that with keyboard and mouse.

169
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:07,919
Rick and Morty.

170
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:14,320
Fucking Rick and Morty.

171
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:22,019
Rick and Morty is like a four hour game.

172
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,019
It'll be nice to see that though.

173
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:27,179
I'm looking forward to it.

174
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:28,179
Alright, so let's see.

175
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:29,179
What's the internet have to say about this?

176
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:31,179
What does the internet think?

177
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:41,080
We got 155,000 likes and 4.2 thousand dislikes.

178
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
So 4200 dislikes.

179
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
155,000 likes.

180
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,110
Seems like people are taking it pretty well.

181
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,110
The internet thinks you should play Farmer's Dynasty.

182
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:56,620
Are you sure?

183
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,240
If I had a like and dislike ratio on this stream,

184
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,419
the second that this trailer comes down,

185
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:08,590
would probably be like 30 to 70 percent like to dislike.

186
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,590
So I don't know if you're correct on that.

187
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:16,730
I think you're actually incorrect.

188
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,730
Just wait.

189
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,730
You guys are going to just wait.

190
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,730
I think I picked a good one.

191
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,220
Alright, let's go.

192
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,220
That was cool.

193
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,220
I'm sure it'll be fun.

194
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,379
They wouldn't have waited this long and put this much time into it

195
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:32,379
if it wasn't going to be at least a fun game.

196
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:37,659
We'll find out when I play it on day one.

197
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:38,659
That's right.

198
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:39,659
I've got an announcement of my own.

199
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:46,759
On day one of the launch of Half-Life VR,

200
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,759
I'm going to play it on this channel.

201
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,759
What an announcement that I have for you, right?

202
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,379
The thing that somebody put tons of awesome time into,

203
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,379
I'm going to play it.

204
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:01,389
What a fucking announcement.

205
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:04,230
Shit, this is loud.

206
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,710
Upgrade my PC.

207
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,679
By then, I'll have at least another fucking 780.

208
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,970
You guys ready?

209
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,059
Can we go now?

210
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:23,059
Day one first minute?

211
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:27,139
No, there's no way I'm going to be the first person that plays that game.

212
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:32,659
Somebody from like fucking Russia will have like a leaked copy

213
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,659
two, three weeks before it.

214
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:37,659
It'll stream it for like 40 minutes before they get removed.

215
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,659
So I won't be the first person that plays it.

216
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:52,120
When I'm allowed to, I will.

217
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,710
You guys ready?

218
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:03,320
Move to Russia.

219
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Some random person from like, I don't know, like Australia or something

220
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,320
will end up having like a copy from some Australian GameStop.

221
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,669
New quest.

222
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:16,669
Talk to Oliver.

223
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:19,669
Since your grandfather passed away, he has kept an eye on your farm.

224
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:20,669
He'll show you around.

225
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:22,669
That's a bomb you're dropping on me.

226
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:25,940
You're losing food from the pantry.

227
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,940
A cat should keep mice at bay.

228
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,940
First, my grandfather dies and now my cat's...

229
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,940
What's going on?

230
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,940
Hold on.

231
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,519
This is the sensitivity is too high.

232
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,490
That's controller sensitivity.

233
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:49,620
Wait, is there a controls?

234
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,200
Keyboard.

235
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,019
Change the currency.

236
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,019
I already did.

237
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:59,690
All right.

238
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,690
We got...

239
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,690
I might have to...

240
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,690
I'm your neighbor.

241
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,690
My name's Oliver.

242
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,860
I've been looking after this farm since your grandfather passed away.

243
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,360
Nice to meet you, Oliver.

244
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
I appreciate your help.

245
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Oh, damn it.

246
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
This is my heritage.

247
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Game already sucks.

248
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,360
Not a silent protagonist.

249
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:29,710
Why am I dressed like this then?

250
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,850
Why does he not have the belt?

251
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,850
Why do we keep doing the T-pose stretch?

252
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,860
I'll show you around.

253
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,860
Hold on.

254
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

255
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,820
Hold on.

256
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,820
That's a little better.

257
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
I can feel the view.

258
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Best quality.

259
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,820
Let's go.

260
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,570
Okay.

261
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,570
Follow Oliver.

262
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,090
All right.

263
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,090
Where's the punch?

264
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,860
He'll talk later.

265
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,769
How do you...

266
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:04,769
I want to walk.

267
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:06,710
No, that's sprint.

268
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,710
I think I might actually use a controller for this.

269
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,710
It's kind of...

270
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,710
It's a little painful.

271
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,710
Is VSync on?

272
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,710
No.

273
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,980
No, I got to turn it on.

274
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,750
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

275
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,750
I don't want it in a different language.

276
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,000
Holy shit, you've got it.

277
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This has been localized in a shitload of places.

278
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,309
As you can see, the farm is quite in a poor shape.

279
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,309
Few repairs have been done here.

280
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:40,309
What the hell have you been doing?

281
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:42,309
I thought you were looking after this place.

282
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:46,309
Does that include eating Cheetos on the couch while the place rots?

283
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:51,379
But you can have some sleep here or even store some food.

284
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:56,840
You will have to bring this farm to a good shape yourself.

285
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Soon you'll see how to do that.

286
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:07,700
This place sucks.

287
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,700
What did you...

288
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
Like, what did you...

289
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Has this guy been living here?

290
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,539
So he inherited this farm.

291
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:16,539
Why didn't I get this farm?

292
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:20,900
It's empty now, but I'm sure you'll need it pretty soon.

293
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
Well, I'll take a full letter, Greed.

294
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:29,900
But if you can afford building materials, then you can fix the construction yourself.

295
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,849
Okay.

296
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:39,500
His farm, your problem.

297
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Yeah, that's ridiculous.

298
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:49,859
That's the guy from How It's Made.

299
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,710
It really is.

300
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,710
I hope he tells me.

301
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,210
Imagine if he stands behind you while you work.

302
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
And he, like, just narrates what you're doing.

303
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,970
The farmer screws the nails into the board.

304
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,970
Oh, I hope that happens.

305
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:30,539
It's like, Oliver, will you fuck off?

306
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:34,539
The cowshed is old and needs some work, but it's still solid.

307
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:37,539
You can do the fixes and upgrades yourself.

308
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:40,539
Try fixing those holes first.

309
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:41,539
The cowshed?

310
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:42,539
So your animals stay healthy.

311
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,539
What holes?

312
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,539
I see you've come prepared and have your own tools.

313
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:47,539
Good.

314
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:51,539
Try to fix these doors since it's stuck and won't open.

315
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:53,539
Okay, hold on.

316
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:57,539
This game is like, I need v-sync turned on.

317
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:01,809
Because it's like, it's killing me.

318
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,650
I have to, I think I have to restart the game.

319
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,650
We'll get to a save point first.

320
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,650
All right.

321
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,650
Equip the repair tool from the work mode menu.

322
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,650
Check the barn for sections.

323
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,650
Okay, the work mode menu.

324
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,779
This is an open world game?

325
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:22,259
Why do I have a Grand Theft Auto map?

326
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:23,259
Are you serious?

327
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:33,400
Okay, I need a barn.

328
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Your animals live here.

329
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Keep this building in good shape

330
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,789
so that your animals grow healthy.

331
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:39,789
Oh, okay.

332
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:47,089
Engineer site.

333
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:48,089
Open, activate.

334
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:57,779
Repair old planks.

335
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,779
All right.

336
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:03,319
It should open now.

337
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:07,420
I already opened it.

338
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,420
The door, oh, I opened it already.

339
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
Why did I have to do that?

340
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,970
Wow, look at this.

341
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,970
Don't tell me what vegetable it is.

342
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,339
That's wheat.

343
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:20,640
Got it.

344
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,519
Build a scaffold to climb up there and check the roof.

345
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:32,009
Build a scaffold to from the work mode menu.

346
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:33,180
This?

347
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,180
Build a scaffolding.

348
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:44,019
Holy shit, that took no time at all.

349
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:46,019
That was instantaneous.

350
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:48,019
I'm carrying this?

351
00:20:48,019 --> 00:21:01,250
All right, I'm up.

352
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,250
Is this Fortnite?

353
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,250
Real life Fortnite.

354
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,250
Should I just make a shitload of them?

355
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,250
No, if it was real life Fortnite, guys,

356
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,250
it would be like this.

357
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,250
Fuck, what are you saying?

358
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,769
Fuck me.

359
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:18,769
I always got hit by that.

360
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:19,769
All right.

361
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:27,099
If it was real life Fortnite, it would be this.

362
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:28,099
I can only have two out at one time.

363
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:29,099
Never mind.

364
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:33,740
How do I remove this?

365
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,740
Whatever, we can have two.

366
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,920
All right, what do you want me to do?

367
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
You can store harvested grains in the silo.

368
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Fuck me.

369
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,920
So use these later or sell them if you want.

370
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Before you use the silo, remember to fix it first.

372
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Okay.

373
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,930
Repair rusty metal.

374
00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:08,670
Do I need more pieces?

375
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,670
I think I did it.

376
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:17,940
Oh.

377
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,940
What is going on here?

378
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,940
Take a look at the greenhouse.

379
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,940
You can grow some veggies here fast to earn some quick money.

380
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,940
I shaved the back of his head.

381
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,940
Still, you'll have to fix these holes

382
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,940
so your plants can grow to a best effect.

383
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,460
Okay, fix these holes.

384
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,460
I see your grandfather bought some materials to fix it already.

385
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,460
There's a car over there.

386
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,460
You can use it to rebuild the greenhouse as good as you can.

387
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,460
Okay.

388
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,460
Pick up metal?

389
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,460
Steel sheets to fix it.

390
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,460
It was already gone.

391
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,460
Did somebody read that?

392
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:57,259
Rebuild rusty metal with metal.

393
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:05,769
Where am I going to do the door?

394
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:09,569
Okay, I'm done.

395
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:13,410
You were pretty good at this.

396
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,410
I'm sure you'll do well on this farm.

397
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:21,140
Actually, I might have a job for you myself.

398
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
What is it?

399
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,380
Why don't you come to my place and do some fixes to my barn?

400
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,380
It's mostly roof that needs work,

401
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,380
but some walls need attention too.

402
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,380
I don't have much money,

403
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,380
but I'll give you my old tractor as a reward.

404
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,559
I'm sure you can use it.

405
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,559
Stop.

406
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,559
Wait, this dialogue options?

407
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,559
All right, sounds good.

408
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,559
I'll take care of that.

409
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,559
Thanks.

410
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,559
Should I go to his place?

411
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,559
Yeah.

412
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,559
Sounds good.

413
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,559
I'll take care of this.

414
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,559
I love this game already.

415
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,559
All right.

416
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,799
I'm going back home now.

417
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,799
Good luck and see you around.

418
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:05,539
What the fuck do I do now?

419
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:09,900
You received a thousand social points.

420
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,900
All right.

421
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
I'm kind of lost.

422
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:20,450
I've got a really important job for you.

423
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,450
Why don't you come to my place?

424
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,579
The way that I'm like dressed too.

425
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:36,839
I'm dressed in like a Halloween costume repairman costume.

426
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:42,460
What's in here?

427
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,460
This is my house, right?

428
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:50,690
What the fuck is all this stuff?

429
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:57,599
Enter the pantry.

430
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:04,509
Oh, Italian tomato soup cooked or condensed food tasty.

431
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:06,509
And do I have to eat?

432
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:16,940
This isn't even doing anything.

433
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,910
Holy shit.

434
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,910
Imagine playing the game.

435
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,910
What is this FOV slider?

436
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,049
Let's go right in the middle where it starts.

437
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:30,720
Oh my God.

438
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
What?

439
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:41,019
What?

440
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:42,019
What?

441
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:43,019
What?

442
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:44,019
What?

443
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:47,119
What's going on?

444
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:57,190
He doesn't know.

445
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,190
He didn't know.

446
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,190
What's wrong?

447
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,190
Why even have an FOV option that goes down this far?

448
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,650
Who plays a game like this?

449
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,650
Why wouldn't you have the option to go up rather than down this far?

450
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:09,450
All right.

451
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,450
Well, at max FOV, this is definitely like 60.

452
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,140
Is this 90?

453
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
I don't think it is.

454
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,140
Whatever.

455
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,140
All right.

456
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,660
What's wrong?

457
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,660
All right.

458
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,660
I got to go to the guy's house.

459
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,339
Right?

460
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:24,339
Home sweet home.

461
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:25,339
Complete repairs on your farm.

462
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:26,339
Help Oliver.

463
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:28,339
Go to Oliver's farm and fix his barn.

464
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:31,339
Use engineer's site to see which sections of the barn need repairs.

465
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,339
Let's go there.

466
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:52,700
Is that my truck?

467
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,700
Police?

468
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,430
That's not what I was trying to do.

469
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,430
Oh, I see.

470
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,430
What's your trade?

471
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,430
A bit of everything.

472
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,430
Nails.

473
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,430
Soap.

474
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,430
Some food.

475
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:22,670
You know, I will also buy fresh food from you if you can spare.

476
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,670
Nothing big, but I could use some fish.

477
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,670
What about hamburgers?

478
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,670
Mushrooms, perhaps.

479
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,670
You know.

480
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,670
Well, that's really good to know.

481
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,670
I'll see you around.

482
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,849
All right.

483
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:34,849
Not going anywhere.

484
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:35,849
You know.

485
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:39,390
Where am I?

486
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,660
Oh, OK.

487
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,470
You notice a stranger by the road.

488
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,470
He clearly wants something.

489
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,470
Wait, what?

490
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:57,710
Wait, I want to sell you stuff.

491
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,710
Come here.

492
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,779
Good to see you.

493
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:01,779
Can I help you?

494
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:05,180
Uh, care to trade.

495
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,180
Care to trade?

496
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,480
Sure.

497
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
What do you need?

498
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Here, I've got a hamburger.

499
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Delicious food of great nutritional value.

500
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Twenty-six dollars.

501
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Canned food.

502
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
Oh, here.

503
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:25,529
Take that.

504
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:27,900
Here, take all these soups.

505
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,900
How much money do I got?

506
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,200
Five hundred and fifty dollars.

507
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
All right.

508
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Here, take this spicy pumpkin soup.

509
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,680
Uh, I'm keeping the apple and the tomatoes.

510
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
You can have everything else.

511
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:45,529
Hold on.

512
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:48,529
Why are there drones?

513
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:51,599
A wedding ring?

514
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,420
Wait.

515
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,109
Perfect.

516
00:28:58,109 --> 00:28:59,109
Expensive item.

517
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:00,109
Perfect gift.

518
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:01,109
Is there a chainsaw?

519
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:14,359
How do I equip the chainsaw?

520
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:22,960
OK.

521
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960
Put it away.

522
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Put it away.

523
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
Put it away.

524
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,099
Let's go.

525
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,099
I need to do my quest.

526
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,039
I haven't even started playing the game yet.

527
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,460
I have to play the game.

528
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,460
What is that?

529
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,460
Is that an animal?

530
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:50,039
Buy a ring from him and then propose to him.

531
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:53,009
Can you pet?

532
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:54,009
Can I feed the dog?

533
00:29:54,009 --> 00:30:02,670
I don't think so.

534
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,670
All right.

535
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:10,980
Let's go.

536
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:17,069
Get in the fucking truck and just drive the damn thing for Christ's sake.

537
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:22,660
OK.

538
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,660
Where is Oliver's house?

539
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:31,500
Can I put a waypoint?

540
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Go to Oliver's farm and fix his barn.

541
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,059
All right.

542
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:36,059
I have a waypoint there.

543
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:37,299
I think.

544
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:50,440
There we go.

545
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,440
Somebody else's farm.

546
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
I'm just driving over all this stuff.

547
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,619
God damn it.

548
00:30:58,619 --> 00:30:59,619
Change camera.

549
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:01,059
Can I go?

550
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:06,750
Oh, I can go inside.

551
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,750
Destroy the competition.

552
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,750
Yeah.

553
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,380
There can only be one farmer in this town.

554
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,380
You're destroying strangers' crops.

555
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,380
It's bad for your social status.

556
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,380
Oh, are you?

557
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:24,299
Is this Oliver's house?

558
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,299
Wait.

559
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:26,299
This is Oliver's barn.

560
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:27,299
Fuck Oliver.

561
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:36,769
You let my grandfather's place go to shit.

562
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,769
You think I care?

563
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:40,990
All right.

564
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,990
What do I need to fix?

565
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:48,660
I'm coming over here with like a huge tractor and I'm going to just dig up all of his stuff

566
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,269
and steal it.

567
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:57,839
Have I already gone full blown psycho?

568
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:58,839
Where's his barn?

569
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:14,819
Oliver, where the fuck are you?

570
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:31,589
Is this where he lives?

571
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:36,750
Just like the sicko cutting his shit down.

572
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,750
Just block the road.

573
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,750
Well, he'll figure it out.

574
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,750
All right.

575
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,750
Where is Oliver?

576
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,950
You notice a lady by her farm.

577
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,430
Perhaps it would be nice to say hello.

578
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,430
This lady?

579
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:53,079
I don't understand what this game wants me to do.

580
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,079
I'm trying to find...

581
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,079
So good to see you, sweetheart.

582
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,079
Can you help me?

583
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:59,450
What can I do for you, ma'am?

584
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,940
My brother is working abroad.

585
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,940
He should have been back home a week ago, but he's still busy working.

586
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,500
I need one of my fields plowed and cultivated.

587
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
Will you do it for me, please?

588
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Use that old plow over there by the barn.

589
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
You can keep it when you're done.

590
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
All right.

591
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,500
I'll do it.

592
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,500
My brother plans on buying a new one anyway.

593
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,500
I can keep this.

594
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
Okay.

595
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,500
I'm going to keep this.

596
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,789
I get a new thing.

597
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:26,099
No promises, but I'll see what I can do.

598
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:27,099
All right.

599
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:28,099
The quest is being fought.

600
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:33,319
I need to work on Clara's field.

601
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:36,319
It's here, but...

602
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,319
Okay.

603
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,319
Let's mark it.

604
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,319
It's already being marked.

605
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:52,039
Do I need my truck for this?

606
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:54,039
I think I need to back my truck into that.

607
00:33:54,039 --> 00:34:00,460
Yeah.

608
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,460
I got to back up my truck into that.

609
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:18,960
I got to get my truck.

610
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
These wheels are off the ground.

611
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:35,980
Sorry about that.

612
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,980
Okay.

613
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,980
Back the truck up into this.

614
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,380
Somehow.

615
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:49,019
Other way?

616
00:34:49,019 --> 00:35:12,869
You can't do this with a truck?

617
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:21,340
Attach.

618
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,340
Didn't I try to go in here?

619
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,210
Oh, shit.

620
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,019
There's no tractor in here, you guys.

621
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:30,019
There's nothing in here.

622
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:42,230
Where's your tractor?

623
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:47,739
In my barn?

624
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:50,739
You fix this and then they give you a tractor.

625
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:52,739
Wait, I have to just plug the holes?

626
00:35:52,739 --> 00:36:07,219
All right.

627
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:15,440
I did it.

628
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
I can use my farm revision.

629
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,599
Farming is really easy.

630
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:30,690
Attach the old plow to work.

631
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,690
The quest is being fought.

632
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,690
Attach the old plow to work.

633
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,230
Complete repairs.

634
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:44,289
Am I just dumb or do I not have a tractor?

635
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,289
Do I have to get a tractor?

636
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:49,360
Do I have to fix up the rest of this barn?

637
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,889
Yes.

638
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:55,889
But you do need a tractor.

639
00:36:55,889 --> 00:36:56,889
Okay.

640
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:58,889
So you get it from...

641
00:36:58,889 --> 00:36:59,889
All right.

642
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:03,090
We're going to come back here later.

643
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,090
Oliver first.

644
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,090
I need to repair my own place first.

645
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,389
Is there a horn?

646
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:12,579
If there's not a horn, it's the worst game.

647
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:13,579
See you later.

648
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:20,059
Oh, you both don't like me.

649
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:21,059
Bye.

650
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:26,980
All right.

651
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
So I need to go...

652
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,340
I need to like save the game first and then like restart with VSync on.

653
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,900
Yeah.

654
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,659
Okay.

655
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:37,659
There we go.

656
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:39,920
Saving the game.

657
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,889
Am I good?

658
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:43,889
All right.

659
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:44,889
Yeah.

660
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:45,889
Let me just...

661
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:46,889
VSync has to be turned on.

662
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,380
This is like killing me.

663
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,380
My credit sucks.

664
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,380
It'll improve very shortly.

665
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,329
No, it's not on.

666
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:55,949
I have to restart the game.

667
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:58,639
I have to restart the game.

668
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,639
It'll be turned on.

669
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,639
Here we go.

670
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,639
One, two, three.

671
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,579
You want to leave?

672
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:04,579
Yes.

673
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:10,579
Is this like actually an iPad game ad where I accidentally click on yes and take me to

674
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,579
this person's Discord?

675
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:19,289
That's kind of...

676
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:20,289
All right.

677
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:21,289
Whatever.

678
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:22,289
All right.

679
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:24,289
Let's reopen it and then we can go.

680
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:28,289
I have to turn on VSync, otherwise the game's going to keep hurting my eyes.

681
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:34,900
All right.

682
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,449
Load game.

683
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:42,030
Wait, what's going on here?

684
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,909
Why is this so tiny?

685
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:46,909
VSync on 1920 by 1080.

686
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:47,909
What the fuck is this?

687
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,090
Why is this in such a tiny window?

688
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:56,869
What is going on here?

689
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:02,099
Why does it look normal for you but look awful for me?

690
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:18,710
I mean, I'd definitely play it, but why is it in such a tiny...

691
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,710
It's in a small window.

692
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,190
VSync...

693
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,190
What do you mean VSync off?

694
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,750
No.

695
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,250
VSync on 1920 by 1080.

696
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,250
What are you doing?

697
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:36,019
Windowed off, 1920 by 1080.

698
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:37,019
Let's go.

699
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:39,099
Come on.

700
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:40,099
It's in like a 1200 by...

701
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:43,099
It's like a 720 window on my desktop.

702
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:52,059
What the fuck is this?

703
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:55,599
Okay.

704
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,599
Is it doing this shit again?

705
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,969
Why is it in a window?

706
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:03,960
I have no idea what's going on.

707
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,840
Save the settings.

708
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,840
What do you mean save the settings?

709
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,510
Alt-Enter.

710
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,289
All right, we're good.

711
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:16,849
All right, let's go.

712
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,849
No family, pretty good condition.

713
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:19,849
I'm ready to go.

714
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:20,849
That was fucked up.

715
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:24,739
There's no save settings.

716
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:27,739
Guys, there's no save settings.

717
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:31,739
You have to restart the game to have your settings take place.

718
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:40,280
Did that help?

719
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,159
Yeah, it did.

720
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,420
All right, let's go back to...

721
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,420
Where are we going?

722
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,070
We're trying to go to Oliver.

723
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,309
Fix Oliver's barn.

724
00:40:54,309 --> 00:41:00,900
All right, that's how you mark it.

725
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,900
I get it.

726
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,900
Let's go.

727
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:19,179
Am I running out of gas?

728
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:21,179
Why am I going so slow?

729
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,960
Why am I going so slow?

730
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:33,019
That's a huge bird.

731
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:35,389
That bird was like 10 feet tall.

732
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:40,130
All right, Oliver, what do you need?

733
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:48,940
I'm here to fix your barn.

734
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,940
Yuck.

735
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,250
Did use a lot of work, Oliver.

736
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:57,300
All right, Oliver, I'm here.

737
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,570
I don't know what's going on this way, but can I pick that up?

738
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,900
All right, we've got it.

739
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,900
Oof, broken.

740
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,900
I'll fix it.

741
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:13,510
That's that.

742
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,510
Up there, too.

743
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,510
Can I reach?

744
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:19,030
Of course I can.

745
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:28,969
What's that Minecraft hack that just builds in like 10, 15 blocks ahead of you?

746
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:31,039
How do I...

747
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,039
I've got to get on the roof and fix this roof.

748
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:38,760
Oh, Oliver.

749
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,219
All right, we've got to get on the roof.

750
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:43,219
Scaffolding time.

751
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:56,980
Okay, let's repair this.

752
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:05,420
Dude, pog, let's go.

753
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:18,460
Do I get social credit with this?

754
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,460
I wonder what that means.

755
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,739
Steel tractor.

756
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:26,500
I'm probably going to get one for this.

757
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:31,619
This is going to take a long fucking time.

758
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:52,880
Imagine redoing somebody's entire barn, building it back, repairing everything for 50 likes on an Instagram post.

759
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,170
I'm not so sure that's worth it.

760
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:08,539
Okay, well, that's almost the other side.

761
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:17,920
Actually, it kind of feels nice to do this.

762
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,699
Is there a third-person mode?

763
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:25,150
No, of course there isn't.

764
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,630
I'm not even doing my own house.

765
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:53,650
I drank coffee so I wouldn't fall asleep today.

766
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:57,650
Well, you've got two factors fighting back and forth.

767
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:05,110
You've got farming dynasty stream and a bunch of coffee.

768
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:07,110
You're being pulled in two different directions.

769
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:11,869
I did it.

770
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:14,369
Barn fix, talk to Oliver and ask for your reward.

771
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:16,369
Is it fall damage?

772
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:21,170
Ooh, I'm going to get that.

773
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,170
That's mine.

774
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:29,909
Oliver, I fixed the barn.

775
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:32,599
Looking good and solid.

776
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:33,599
Thank you.

777
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:40,289
Now, I don't have much money, but as promised, that John Deere over there is all yours.

778
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:44,289
It should do well until you can afford a real neutral.

779
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:46,289
You said the copyrighted name.

780
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:48,289
I can totally start fieldwork now.

781
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:50,289
You were supposed to not say the copyright name.

782
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:54,289
The copyright names are kind of short, but I think I'll need more farming machines.

783
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:56,289
You should talk to people.

784
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:59,289
I'm sure a lot of them will have some work for you too.

785
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:05,849
You'll need a plow, a cedar perhaps, and I've seen a cultivator already on your farm.

786
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:07,849
Good luck with farming.

787
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:09,849
I will look around.

788
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:10,849
Thank you.

789
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:16,159
I just stole an apple.

790
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:22,170
Okay, so drive your new Jack Bear tractor.

791
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,409
Cool.

792
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:27,989
Have you finished your task?

793
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:29,230
I did.

794
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,230
All right, thanks for the tractor.

795
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:50,570
Where are you going?

796
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:55,469
Who is this person, and why are they sprinting?

797
00:46:55,469 --> 00:47:15,059
Not now, sorry.

798
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:16,059
I'm curious.

799
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:24,909
I need to know what you're doing.

800
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:28,139
What?

801
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:32,829
Where'd he go?

802
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:35,260
Wait, did he go into the corn?

803
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:42,619
Oh, shit, he went into the corn.

804
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:43,619
Uh-oh.

805
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:46,250
Wait, I probably shouldn't have done this.

806
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,250
There we go.

807
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:52,519
Thank God I have a map.

808
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:55,940
Well, that was weird.

809
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:01,699
All right, give me my tractor.

810
00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:03,699
I can purchase your field.

811
00:48:03,699 --> 00:48:06,699
So I'm just going to end up as a monopoly farm and own everything?

812
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:24,300
Okay.

813
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,300
You received Jack Bear C and 100 social points.

814
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,949
Cool.

815
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,949
All right, now I can do Clara's job.

816
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:33,949
That's the one we're going to do now.

817
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:39,519
Okay, I don't really want to drive this.

818
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:44,530
This is like driving around a giant unicycle or a giant tricycle.

819
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:50,989
I don't want to lose social points.

820
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:56,070
It has four wheels.

821
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,070
That don't matter.

822
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,070
The two in the front maze will be one.

823
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:06,199
99.

824
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:07,199
I have to get gas too.

825
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:23,329
Look at how big this bird is.

826
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:25,329
Birds aren't that big.

827
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:29,329
That would think it was like a fucking bald eagle.

828
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:36,329
All right.

829
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:38,699
How do I, let me, I got to attach this.

830
00:49:38,699 --> 00:50:01,119
How does it attach?

831
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,860
I've never, I don't know what this thing is.

832
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:26,659
He's a fucking city slicker.

833
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:30,409
I don't know what the, I don't know how to do this.

834
00:50:30,409 --> 00:50:32,409
I don't know how, what this thing is.

835
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:35,409
I know it's like a plow and his blades on it and shit,

836
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:36,409
but I don't know how that would do.

837
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,409
Why can I not attach this?

838
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:40,409
Did I have it before?

839
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:46,900
Oh, okay.

840
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,139
Got it.

841
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:51,139
Plow Clara's field.

842
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,300
This one here.

843
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:59,230
How do I use the plow?

844
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:03,800
Yeah.

845
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,800
You got nothing here, Clara.

846
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,800
When you plow your field, drive over your sand.

847
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,170
What is here?

848
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:24,260
Am I doing this right?

849
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:27,260
Oh, wait, wait, lower the machine, lower the machine.

850
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,019
Oh man.

851
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,019
Okay.

852
00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:36,949
Lift the machine.

853
00:51:36,949 --> 00:51:38,949
Wait, I got to do this whole thing.

854
00:51:38,949 --> 00:51:43,969
Oh boy.

855
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:48,969
Oh shit, I'm tearing up the whole world.

856
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:50,269
All right.

857
00:51:50,269 --> 00:51:51,269
Let's do this quick.

858
00:51:51,269 --> 00:52:08,380
What do you mean?

859
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,380
There is no quick?

860
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:20,610
All right.

861
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,610
I almost did one pass.

862
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:30,079
All right.

863
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:38,980
Now he's going to, I'm going to just like mow in a lawn.

864
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,980
Holy shit.

865
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,219
This is going to take like two hours.

866
00:52:43,219 --> 00:52:50,360
This is going to take so long.

867
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,360
This is going to take like an hour.

868
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,360
This is absolutely nothing.

869
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
This is how I mow lawns.

870
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,239
I don't know.

871
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:03,239
Everybody thinks I'm fucking crazy, but my father used to tell me, son, I want you to

872
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:04,239
get out there and I want you to mow the lawn.

873
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:06,239
I'd be like, all right, fine.

874
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:07,929
And I would just do it like this.

875
00:53:07,929 --> 00:53:09,929
So I would never have to stop moving.

876
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:11,929
You don't have to stop reverse, go back, stop.

877
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:16,739
No, I would just go in a circle in a spiral until I got to the very end.

878
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:28,480
Wait, slow down.

879
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,480
Am I going too fast?

880
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:38,059
I am going too fast.

881
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:39,550
Fuck.

882
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,550
Hold on.

883
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:45,980
Don't go slower.

884
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:46,980
There we go.

885
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:55,190
Okay.

886
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,190
What about what?

887
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,190
It's cruise control.

888
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:59,190
Oh, it just drives it for you.

889
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,190
Good.

890
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,190
I'll do that.

891
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:02,190
I want to change the camera too.

892
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:07,699
Let's like relax.

893
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:08,699
That's way better.

894
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:10,829
All right.

895
00:54:10,829 --> 00:54:12,829
Now I can actually see what the fuck I'm doing.

896
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:26,579
Right now, they're all in the house preparing dinner, looking out the window at this.

897
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:30,579
And they're just like, no, no, just let him do it.

898
00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:31,579
Let him do it that way.

899
00:54:31,579 --> 00:54:34,579
I mean, don't go out there and like correct him.

900
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:36,940
He's kind of a weirdo.

901
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:42,380
Just let him do his thing.

902
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:52,849
What's going on over there every time?

903
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:53,849
Why can I not do that turn?

904
00:54:53,849 --> 00:55:06,619
What's wrong with me?

905
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:07,619
I got plenty of gas.

906
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:09,619
I have 95%.

907
00:55:09,619 --> 00:55:18,329
What's the issue here?

908
00:55:18,329 --> 00:55:19,329
What do I keep doing?

909
00:55:19,329 --> 00:55:32,980
Shit.

910
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:33,980
All right.

911
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,980
I'll get it.

912
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,980
I'm just going backwards.

913
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:36,980
Can you go backwards in a plot like this?

914
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,980
No.

915
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:48,760
Yeah.

916
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,760
But this is, this really is a scenario where somebody would just burst out their fucking

917
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,760
back door and be like, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, stop, stop, stop it.

918
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,940
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

919
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:58,940
And it's like, what?

920
00:55:58,940 --> 00:55:59,940
What?

921
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,940
What?

922
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,940
Stop.

923
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:07,019
Get off.

924
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:08,019
Get off the fucking tractor.

925
00:56:08,019 --> 00:56:09,019
Get off.

926
00:56:09,019 --> 00:56:10,019
I'd be like, what's going on?

927
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:11,019
What's the matter?

928
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:12,639
What's the matter?

929
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:13,639
I'd be really kind of nervous and like kind of sad.

930
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:17,440
Like what?

931
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,440
What's what's what's happening?

932
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,440
Get off.

933
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,440
Just go home.

934
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,440
Thank you.

935
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,440
Thank you.

936
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,440
I appreciate the help.

937
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,539
Thank you.

938
00:56:26,539 --> 00:56:29,250
Thank you so much.

939
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,250
Thank you.

940
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,250
But just get off.

941
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:45,159
I can't do it.

942
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:46,159
Yes, I can.

943
00:56:47,159 --> 00:57:03,820
Back left wheel.

944
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,820
All right.

945
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,820
I'm going to just, here we go.

946
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,059
I have a new plan.

947
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:10,059
I can't use my old lawn mowing technique.

948
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:20,829
Does it matter if you just like go over, you are getting hungry.

949
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:23,739
Okay.

950
00:57:23,739 --> 00:57:34,539
I have to eat.

951
00:57:34,539 --> 00:57:35,539
Just go over there and eat.

952
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:36,539
Can I just like walk over there?

953
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:37,840
Does it?

954
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,840
All right.

955
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:43,219
I'm hungry.

956
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:44,219
Lunch break.

957
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:45,519
Lunch break.

958
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:58,789
Exit.

959
00:57:58,789 --> 00:57:59,789
Do I have any food?

960
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:00,789
Oh, an apple.

961
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:01,789
Here we go.

962
00:58:01,789 --> 00:58:02,789
Your condition.

963
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:03,789
Food.

964
00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:04,789
Your condition depends on both eating and sleeping.

965
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:06,789
I don't know how to feel and work better.

966
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:10,860
Food, 44, sleep, 63.

967
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,860
What do you mean sleep?

968
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:20,699
All right.

969
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:21,699
Unhitched it.

970
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:32,860
Oops.

971
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:35,539
They're looking out the window again.

972
00:58:35,539 --> 00:58:36,539
Yeah.

973
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:37,539
He unhitched it.

974
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:38,539
I just, I mean, that thing was expensive.

975
00:58:38,539 --> 00:58:39,539
I just don't want him to break it.

976
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:41,039
I'm going to go out there.

977
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,039
I know I shouldn't go out there, but I'm going to go out there.

978
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:45,039
I think he, oh, he got it.

979
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:46,039
He got it.

980
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:47,039
Okay.

981
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:48,039
I just don't want him to break it.

982
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:57,659
Honey, I don't want him to break it.

983
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,659
Right.

984
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:06,190
There's an argument going on in that, in like the living room over here.

985
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:07,190
It's all my fault.

986
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:11,159
Let me get this little section.

987
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:24,920
Why is it so hard for me to do this?

988
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,349
Because this thing turns.

989
00:59:28,349 --> 00:59:30,349
This thing, it's hard to control.

990
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:48,550
It's not, it's, it's hard.

991
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,550
It's like, it's hard to turn on a dime.

992
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:52,550
Look, it takes me a full, whatever.

993
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,550
I don't care.

994
00:59:54,550 --> 01:00:17,809
Wait, press R so I can turn better.

995
01:00:17,809 --> 01:00:30,389
Dragon the whole time.

996
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:31,389
All right.

997
01:00:31,389 --> 01:00:38,880
They're not going to be able to grow shit in this.

998
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,880
Look at this.

999
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,099
Look at how bad that looks.

1000
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:52,530
Oh, this does not look good.

1001
01:00:52,530 --> 01:01:00,820
This is a coloring book that you gave a four year old.

1002
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:05,820
At least I'm staying inside the lines, but inside the lines is a joke.

1003
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:09,000
Strokes go in two or three different ways.

1004
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:18,619
I'm almost done.

1005
01:01:18,619 --> 01:01:25,090
Look at how bumpy it is.

1006
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:30,820
It's so bumpy over there.

1007
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:36,110
It's not smooth at all.

1008
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:38,110
I've made dunes.

1009
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:42,719
Oh, this is very, very bad.

1010
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:44,719
Do I get in trouble if it's a bad job?

1011
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:48,719
Or is this a game not smart enough to tell me that I did a bad job?

1012
01:01:48,719 --> 01:02:13,269
I can't get this last trip.

1013
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:27,079
Wait, quest updated.

1014
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:29,079
To cultivate field, go for your own harrow.

1015
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:32,079
You'll find it by your barn.

1016
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,079
What do you mean cultivate?

1017
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:35,079
This is not cultivating.

1018
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:36,079
What is this doing?

1019
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:50,400
This is plowing.

1020
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,400
All right.

1021
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,400
No, I got to get that last piece.

1022
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,400
I have to.

1023
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:01,460
It's going to kill me.

1024
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,460
I'm sorry, guys.

1025
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,460
But yes, city boy, city boy, lol, omega lol.

1026
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,460
Sure.

1027
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:07,460
You can do your omega lols.

1028
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:14,460
If I grabbed my fucking 80-year-old grandfather and I said, hey, grandpa, have you ever played

1029
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,460
a video game before in your life?

1030
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,460
No, not at all.

1031
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,460
Hey, beat Dark Souls right now in front of me.

1032
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:24,460
He'd be like, I don't even understand what this is.

1033
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,460
What?

1034
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,460
I'm not city boy.

1035
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:41,420
I've never driven a plow before in my life.

1036
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:43,420
I don't even know what this thing is.

1037
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:49,559
Let's grind up the pavement.

1038
01:03:49,559 --> 01:04:06,050
No, no, not the sunflowers.

1039
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,050
Those are expensive.

1040
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:09,539
What does it want me to do?

1041
01:04:09,539 --> 01:04:22,429
What the fuck am I supposed to do with this?

1042
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:24,429
These are medieval torture devices.

1043
01:04:24,429 --> 01:04:28,619
Honestly, if you had lined these up, right?

1044
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:32,619
Let's just say, for instance, that I had you blindfold, you take me to a space, you go

1045
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:36,820
to a warehouse and you show me that on the ground.

1046
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:39,250
I'm going to think, oh, what is that?

1047
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,250
I'm going to say, oh, that's they put people on that in the medieval times and they like

1048
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:45,250
stretched them out and like stabbed them and shit.

1049
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:48,579
I wouldn't know what the hell this was.

1050
01:04:48,579 --> 01:04:55,000
All right.

1051
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I need to attach that.

1052
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,460
You have fixed.

1053
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,460
You have fixed your garage.

1054
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:03,420
Congratulations.

1055
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,420
Your neighbors appreciate your work.

1056
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:07,420
You received 5000 points.

1057
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:14,949
Somebody fixed my garage for me and they didn't have the heart to tell me.

1058
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:15,949
All right.

1059
01:05:15,949 --> 01:05:16,949
I'm fucking up all my weed.

1060
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:17,949
How do I drop this thing?

1061
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:18,949
Drop it.

1062
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:26,340
Is this mine?

1063
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:32,760
Why would they put it here?

1064
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:37,090
People are just doing chores for me.

1065
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:39,710
I think people feel bad for me.

1066
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:46,579
All right.

1067
01:05:46,579 --> 01:05:47,579
Now bring it back.

1068
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:50,579
Go back to Clara and cultivate her field.

1069
01:05:50,579 --> 01:06:11,260
Cultivate the pavement.

1070
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:17,420
I'm going.

1071
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:24,210
Can I break these things?

1072
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:32,380
Oh, the noise this would make.

1073
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:49,550
Go around me.

1074
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:50,550
Go around me.

1075
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:57,909
Go around me.

1076
01:06:57,909 --> 01:06:59,409
An idiot.

1077
01:06:59,409 --> 01:07:14,780
I would put like a little sound board up here and have like choo-choo sounds.

1078
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:19,969
That was a pogchamp moment.

1079
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,969
I would not have made it through that.

1080
01:07:21,969 --> 01:07:23,969
Do you see how narrow that was?

1081
01:07:23,969 --> 01:07:24,969
All right.

1082
01:07:24,969 --> 01:07:25,969
Cultivate the field.

1083
01:07:25,969 --> 01:07:27,969
I have a new strategy.

1084
01:07:27,969 --> 01:07:28,969
It's called go horizontal.

1085
01:07:28,969 --> 01:07:29,969
You ready?

1086
01:07:29,969 --> 01:07:34,599
Wait, wait.

1087
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:37,099
What the hell am I doing right now?

1088
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:40,550
Am I just redoing the thing?

1089
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:42,550
Is this going back to what I am?

1090
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:48,219
Am I just making it go back the way it was?

1091
01:07:48,219 --> 01:07:52,769
Why did you make me do all this?

1092
01:07:52,769 --> 01:08:01,789
You're stealing your neighbor's crops.

1093
01:08:01,789 --> 01:08:03,789
It's really bad for your socials.

1094
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:05,789
What do you mean cultivating?

1095
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:08,789
This was the exact same way it looked before.

1096
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:18,010
This is the idiot test.

1097
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:21,250
You know that funny business card that somebody pulls out where it says,

1098
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:22,250
this is the idiot test.

1099
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,250
Turn around to find the answer.

1100
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,250
And then on the other side, this is the idiot test.

1101
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,250
Turn around to find the answer.

1102
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,250
And I turn it around five, 10 times.

1103
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:32,250
I idiot.

1104
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,250
That's what I'm doing right now.

1105
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,250
This is the idiot test business card joke.

1106
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:51,260
I should just go steal all their crops.

1107
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,260
Do I care about my social score?

1108
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:59,449
Do I care if I have a bunch of haters?

1109
01:08:59,449 --> 01:09:04,060
That's all that means, right?

1110
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:22,170
This is not going as bad.

1111
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:27,800
Do you care about getting arrested?

1112
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:34,539
Okay, the only warning that popped up on my screen was,

1113
01:09:34,539 --> 01:09:39,539
hey, some people on social media aren't going to like you anymore.

1114
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:42,539
But here's $700,000 worth of crops.

1115
01:09:42,539 --> 01:10:00,520
Oh, you're going to lose like 12 Facebook friends.

1116
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,590
But gain a million dollars.

1117
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:21,460
He's fucking calling me.

1118
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,960
Is money all that you care about?

1119
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,520
No.

1120
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:35,949
It's one of the only things I get.

1121
01:10:35,949 --> 01:10:36,949
No.

1122
01:10:36,949 --> 01:10:40,470
People won't buy these crops.

1123
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:44,470
Well, then I'll just store them in my silo for when fucking Armageddon happens.

1124
01:10:44,470 --> 01:11:07,189
What is this pattern?

1125
01:11:07,189 --> 01:11:11,560
I call this pattern late game space invaders.

1126
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:26,090
This pattern is called.

1127
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:41,640
I'm supposed to use this machine on the Wii.

1128
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:45,640
Now, that would be really, really funny if I believed you,

1129
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,010
because then I would just drive over it and go,

1130
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:52,010
oh, I'm supposed to be here doing like tilling her wheat.

1131
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:54,010
Right. Okay.

1132
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:57,569
But you're a little late.

1133
01:11:57,569 --> 01:12:17,489
I accidentally already drove over a portion of it and it told me stop.

1134
01:12:17,489 --> 01:12:22,649
Yeah, this this outfit isn't looks intentional.

1135
01:12:22,649 --> 01:12:35,550
Like I'm dressed up to be on this tractor.

1136
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:36,550
Almost done.

1137
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:43,500
Dressed to catch Pokemon.

1138
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:55,840
Lower it. Your character is honestly shit.

1139
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,840
Can I join your server to kick your ass?

1140
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:08,539
All right. I better get something good for this because this was like two.

1141
01:13:08,539 --> 01:13:09,539
This is two.

1142
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:11,539
Clara seems to be really fond of you.

1143
01:13:11,539 --> 01:13:12,539
Got it.

1144
01:13:12,539 --> 01:13:16,920
Work done.

1145
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,920
You may keep the plow, but you can still talk to Clara.

1146
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,920
See if she can teach you something.

1147
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,739
Nice.

1148
01:13:24,739 --> 01:13:25,739
I don't even need to do the rest.

1149
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:26,739
Who cares?

1150
01:13:26,739 --> 01:13:30,229
You received the plow and five hundred social points.

1151
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:31,789
Good.

1152
01:13:31,789 --> 01:13:37,000
All right. Let's go to let's go talk to Clara.

1153
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,250
Oh, wait, I have to do my have to fix my house.

1154
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:45,600
Where was Clara?

1155
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,600
She's over here, right?

1156
01:13:46,600 --> 01:14:00,739
This is her farm right here, right?

1157
01:14:00,739 --> 01:14:01,739
Oh, lift this up.

1158
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:04,579
All right.

1159
01:14:04,579 --> 01:14:05,579
Clara.

1160
01:14:05,579 --> 01:14:08,869
What can you teach me?

1161
01:14:08,869 --> 01:14:18,020
Getting stuck.

1162
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,289
Hey.

1163
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:24,340
Okay.

1164
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:26,340
I thought that was this guy's hair.

1165
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:30,800
For a second, it looked like he had like a weird clown hair.

1166
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,800
Okay.

1167
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,800
Can I help you, sweetheart?

1168
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,800
Sure.

1169
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,800
I'm kind of green.

1170
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,800
Can you tell me a bit about field work?

1171
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,800
Sure.

1172
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,800
What do you need to know?

1173
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,189
What about seeds?

1174
01:14:42,189 --> 01:14:43,189
How do I prepare fields?

1175
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:44,189
How do I gather crops?

1176
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:45,189
Anything more?

1177
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:49,069
What about seeds?

1178
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:52,380
It's best to buy these in the agro store.

1179
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:55,380
You'll get most crops using prepared seeds.

1180
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:56,380
Oh, cool.

1181
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:57,380
Okay.

1182
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,380
And fertilizing.

1183
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:02,810
You can buy good fertilizers in the store and spray them on your fields.

1184
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:03,810
Okay.

1185
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:04,810
Let me get this.

1186
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:07,810
But if you have animals, use manure to fertilize fields, too.

1187
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:08,810
Oh, I can get animals?

1188
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:09,810
If you combine these.

1189
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,810
I got to go.

1190
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:11,810
No more quests.

1191
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:12,810
I got to go fix my shit.

1192
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:15,810
Use different machines for these, of course.

1193
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:18,010
Thanks.

1194
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:19,010
I'll see you around.

1195
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:29,590
All right.

1196
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:32,590
I have to do the main storyline quest.

1197
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:45,710
No, I'll lose points.

1198
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:47,710
I was going to just take out the whole thing.

1199
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:51,680
I was going to do every single flower.

1200
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,680
It was going to be gone.

1201
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:59,439
I can't fucking leave this way.

1202
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:01,579
I want to just ditch it.

1203
01:16:01,579 --> 01:16:03,579
I just can't do this GTA style.

1204
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:05,579
When you get stuck, you just run.

1205
01:16:05,579 --> 01:16:20,829
Okay.

1206
01:16:20,829 --> 01:16:21,829
I'm almost out.

1207
01:16:21,829 --> 01:16:22,829
Where's the exit?

1208
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:27,399
Jump it.

1209
01:16:27,399 --> 01:16:28,399
I can't jump with this thing.

1210
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:29,399
I have to go all the way out.

1211
01:16:29,399 --> 01:16:30,399
Can I take all the...

1212
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:31,399
No.

1213
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:32,399
All right.

1214
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:33,399
Day one is almost done.

1215
01:16:33,399 --> 01:16:35,579
I still have to sleep.

1216
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:40,590
Okay.

1217
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:41,590
I almost got it.

1218
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:42,590
That was close.

1219
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:45,500
All right.

1220
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,500
Back to home.

1221
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:56,630
You can have animals.

1222
01:16:56,630 --> 01:17:00,380
Can I just have an animal farm?

1223
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:03,380
What if I don't want to do crops?

1224
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:09,300
Where's my truck?

1225
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,729
I have no idea.

1226
01:17:11,729 --> 01:17:13,729
I'm going too fast.

1227
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:18,659
I just have thousands of ducks.

1228
01:17:18,659 --> 01:17:20,020
Okay.

1229
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:24,909
That actually sounds like pretty fun.

1230
01:17:24,909 --> 01:17:27,909
I'm not sure which garage is the garage I'm supposed to use to park anything.

1231
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:28,909
All right.

1232
01:17:28,909 --> 01:17:31,939
Here I am.

1233
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:37,060
I need to repair this barn.

1234
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:38,060
Your animals live here.

1235
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:41,060
Keep this building in good shape so your animals grow healthy.

1236
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,060
Are there animals even in here already?

1237
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,060
There's no animals even in here.

1238
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,750
If they are, this is horrible.

1239
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,060
All right.

1240
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,060
Let me fix this stuff.

1241
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:57,760
I'm not even going to scrape the extra bits off.

1242
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:04,569
Okay.

1243
01:18:04,569 --> 01:18:05,569
Repair the bricks.

1244
01:18:05,569 --> 01:18:06,569
Go down here.

1245
01:18:06,569 --> 01:18:09,939
Is it supposed to look like that?

1246
01:18:09,939 --> 01:18:25,069
Okay.

1247
01:18:25,069 --> 01:18:26,069
The door.

1248
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:37,979
What else is he fixing up there?

1249
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:38,979
Can I get it?

1250
01:18:38,979 --> 01:18:39,979
I can reach from here.

1251
01:18:39,979 --> 01:18:40,979
Good.

1252
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:50,659
The ceiling is fucked.

1253
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:52,659
It still looks like shit.

1254
01:18:52,659 --> 01:18:55,659
Can I replace all the brick eventually?

1255
01:18:55,659 --> 01:19:00,720
This looks horrible.

1256
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,899
I can't even paint it.

1257
01:19:01,899 --> 01:19:12,199
There's still a hole here.

1258
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:23,810
Something wrong with the tub?

1259
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:28,859
What's the first animal you guys want?

1260
01:19:28,859 --> 01:19:36,180
Duck?

1261
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,180
These ducks are going to give you a bad Yelp review.

1262
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:40,180
What is this?

1263
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:41,180
An Airbnb?

1264
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:49,399
Okay.

1265
01:19:49,399 --> 01:20:01,029
Is this still fucked up?

1266
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:03,029
Witcher senses.

1267
01:20:03,029 --> 01:20:05,850
What is this?

1268
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:07,850
It's more like Hitman, actually.

1269
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:14,779
All right.

1270
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:16,779
I don't even want to get on the roof.

1271
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:18,779
Why use the scaffolding when you can just look up?

1272
01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:37,510
That's a lot of info up on that HUD.

1273
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:38,510
Too much info.

1274
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:49,260
Only if it were this easy in real life.

1275
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:50,260
If only.

1276
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,949
All right.

1277
01:20:51,949 --> 01:20:52,949
How are we doing?

1278
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:53,949
Outside look all right?

1279
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:57,279
I have to get up there with a scaffold.

1280
01:20:57,279 --> 01:20:58,279
Where's my scaffold?

1281
01:20:58,279 --> 01:21:01,890
How do I remove the scaffolds?

1282
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,890
The whole place is going to be covered in scaffolding.

1283
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:04,890
It's going to look terrible.

1284
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:10,880
Can I remove all this rotted wood?

1285
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:27,840
This is the aesthetic.

1286
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,140
That's not a good aesthetic.

1287
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:47,359
There's so much work to do here.

1288
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:49,729
I'm not even close.

1289
01:21:49,729 --> 01:21:53,630
Is there a watch?

1290
01:21:53,630 --> 01:22:07,140
You be a real farmer.

1291
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,140
Use the sun.

1292
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,500
I mean, it's about to go down.

1293
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,500
What happens at night?

1294
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,020
Is there any downside to being out here at night?

1295
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:16,020
It doesn't even matter.

1296
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:30,869
Zombies.

1297
01:22:30,869 --> 01:22:34,069
You have to kill stuff with a nail gun.

1298
01:22:34,069 --> 01:22:37,529
I mean, I'll tell you one thing about this game.

1299
01:22:37,529 --> 01:22:38,529
You can say whatever you want.

1300
01:22:38,529 --> 01:22:39,529
It doesn't matter what you say.

1301
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:41,529
You could say, oh, this is stupid.

1302
01:22:41,529 --> 01:22:42,529
This is great.

1303
01:22:42,529 --> 01:22:46,960
Sound is that nail gun sound is fantastic.

1304
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,960
It sounds great.

1305
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:56,789
All right.

1306
01:22:56,789 --> 01:22:59,670
So this is almost as this dollar done.

1307
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:03,640
Let me use my spider sense.

1308
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:04,640
Slurry tank.

1309
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:08,880
When your animals produce slurry, it's deposed from here to be used as fertilizer.

1310
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,880
You need a dedicated spreader for this task.

1311
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:12,880
Wait.

1312
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:13,880
What do you mean?

1313
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,569
When my animals produce slurry.

1314
01:23:16,569 --> 01:23:17,569
Why do you have to call it slurry?

1315
01:23:17,569 --> 01:23:21,020
Just think good to go.

1316
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:22,020
That sounds gross as fuck.

1317
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:31,739
It does because it is.

1318
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:32,739
Oh, man.

1319
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:34,739
This is all rundown.

1320
01:23:34,739 --> 01:23:49,289
How many times do I have to do?

1321
01:23:49,289 --> 01:23:52,550
OK, not that much more.

1322
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:54,550
And then we get our first animal.

1323
01:23:54,550 --> 01:24:02,000
Are they expensive?

1324
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:08,359
I mean, how do you get money?

1325
01:24:08,359 --> 01:24:10,359
I have to sell crops and shit.

1326
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:13,180
I don't have any crops.

1327
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,180
Get an animal.

1328
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:15,180
All right.

1329
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:30,500
I'm going to buy an animal.

1330
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:34,869
How much is it?

1331
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:35,869
How much is a duck?

1332
01:24:35,869 --> 01:24:36,869
Less than 100 bucks.

1333
01:24:36,869 --> 01:24:37,869
All right.

1334
01:24:37,869 --> 01:24:38,869
This shit is done.

1335
01:24:38,869 --> 01:24:42,350
It has to be.

1336
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:43,350
I don't see anything else.

1337
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:44,350
Cows owned.

1338
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:45,350
The whole thing's repaired, right?

1339
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:48,899
Oh, come on.

1340
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:56,920
I think this is cows only.

1341
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:57,920
You fixed your cow shed.

1342
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:58,920
Your neighbors appreciate your work.

1343
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,920
You receive 5,000 social points.

1344
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,569
Cool.

1345
01:25:02,569 --> 01:25:03,569
How do I get a cow?

1346
01:25:03,569 --> 01:25:04,569
Do they live here?

1347
01:25:04,569 --> 01:25:05,569
Social points.

1348
01:25:05,569 --> 01:25:06,569
How do I get a cow?

1349
01:25:06,569 --> 01:25:07,569
Hen house.

1350
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:08,569
Your poultry lives here.

1351
01:25:08,569 --> 01:25:10,699
Keep this building in good shape.

1352
01:25:10,699 --> 01:25:11,699
All right.

1353
01:25:11,699 --> 01:25:12,699
I get it.

1354
01:25:12,699 --> 01:25:25,079
I get it.

1355
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:28,500
I get it.

1356
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:29,500
I get it.

1357
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:38,100
I get it.

1358
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,100
I get it.

1359
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:44,470
Hen house.

1360
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:45,470
Your poultry lives here.

1361
01:25:45,470 --> 01:25:46,470
Keep this building in good shape.

1362
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:47,470
All right.

1363
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:51,979
I guess I just have to repair everything.

1364
01:25:51,979 --> 01:26:01,909
This doesn't have as much damage as the other one.

1365
01:26:01,909 --> 01:26:02,909
It's getting dark out.

1366
01:26:02,909 --> 01:26:04,470
Yeah.

1367
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:08,609
I don't think it matters.

1368
01:26:08,609 --> 01:26:13,289
I truly don't think there are any consequences for not eating and not sleeping.

1369
01:26:13,289 --> 01:26:27,539
Almost done with this.

1370
01:26:27,539 --> 01:26:30,819
You will die.

1371
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:32,539
You don't die in this game.

1372
01:26:32,539 --> 01:26:38,579
They did not program in dying, except in the very beginning when your grandfather died.

1373
01:26:38,579 --> 01:26:40,779
That's the only death that's programmed into the game.

1374
01:26:40,779 --> 01:27:00,539
So get a roof.

1375
01:27:00,539 --> 01:27:01,539
How do we...

1376
01:27:01,539 --> 01:27:05,510
Can I put lights in here?

1377
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:13,010
If you don't eat, you're going to lose social points.

1378
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:19,899
That would be actually pretty funny.

1379
01:27:19,899 --> 01:27:20,899
What's left?

1380
01:27:20,899 --> 01:27:21,899
One more.

1381
01:27:21,899 --> 01:27:23,260
One more section and then we can get...

1382
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,779
I'm going to go to the store.

1383
01:27:25,779 --> 01:27:29,300
I'm going to steal a bunch of crops, sell the crops and then buy some hens.

1384
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,300
I think that's the plan here.

1385
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:33,569
What else?

1386
01:27:33,569 --> 01:27:40,689
Anything else broken?

1387
01:27:40,689 --> 01:27:42,430
Didn't tell me I did it.

1388
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:43,670
Hey, congratulations.

1389
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:45,189
You completed the hen house.

1390
01:27:45,189 --> 01:27:48,289
Why?

1391
01:27:48,289 --> 01:28:00,000
Oh, because of this.

1392
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,340
To sleep in the hen house.

1393
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:03,340
I would if I could.

1394
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:09,250
I probably can.

1395
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,250
What is this?

1396
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:27,250
Is that where I can place the hen houses?

1397
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:29,050
I have to buy a hen house then.

1398
01:28:29,050 --> 01:28:30,479
All right.

1399
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:32,760
Here we go.

1400
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,239
Actual fucking...

1401
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:35,359
Actual thing going to happen on stream.

1402
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:36,359
Can you believe it?

1403
01:28:36,359 --> 01:28:53,020
We're going to get a hen tomorrow.

1404
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:57,750
Hen house is almost done and that's it.

1405
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,310
Neighbors appreciate it.

1406
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:00,989
Three thousand social points.

1407
01:29:00,989 --> 01:29:10,449
What time is it?

1408
01:29:10,449 --> 01:29:11,449
What is all this?

1409
01:29:11,449 --> 01:29:15,029
Field owner you.

1410
01:29:15,029 --> 01:29:18,340
Canola ready for harvest.

1411
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:20,859
Shift plus left click to sell this field.

1412
01:29:20,859 --> 01:29:25,340
How much do I get if I sell it?

1413
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:28,930
What am I going to sell on it?

1414
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:29,930
All right.

1415
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:30,930
Complete.

1416
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:39,050
I get to finish the repairs on the house.

1417
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:40,050
How tired am I?

1418
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:43,479
Your condition depends.

1419
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:47,579
So what does this even mean?

1420
01:29:47,579 --> 01:29:48,579
Humidity dry.

1421
01:29:48,579 --> 01:29:49,579
Animals.

1422
01:29:49,579 --> 01:29:50,579
Dogs?

1423
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:52,140
Cats?

1424
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:53,140
Cows?

1425
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:54,140
Hens?

1426
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:55,140
Ducks?

1427
01:29:55,140 --> 01:30:00,340
Geese?

1428
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:01,340
Pigeons?

1429
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:02,649
Eggs?

1430
01:30:02,649 --> 01:30:03,649
I can get geese?

1431
01:30:03,649 --> 01:30:04,649
That's cool.

1432
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:05,649
All right.

1433
01:30:05,649 --> 01:30:07,909
I'm just going to go to bed.

1434
01:30:07,909 --> 01:30:10,050
I want light.

1435
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:11,050
Where is my bed?

1436
01:30:11,050 --> 01:30:12,609
One of these is my house.

1437
01:30:12,609 --> 01:30:13,609
Here it is.

1438
01:30:13,609 --> 01:30:18,239
Right?

1439
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:24,600
Do I have a bed?

1440
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,920
Why do I have two twin beds?

1441
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:30,020
Okay.

1442
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:38,420
Hold on.

1443
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:45,140
Did I just sleep for a week?

1444
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:46,140
Sleep on bed.

1445
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:58,739
Rest for a week.

1446
01:30:58,739 --> 01:31:01,579
Am I okay?

1447
01:31:01,579 --> 01:31:02,579
I haven't eaten in a week.

1448
01:31:02,579 --> 01:31:12,300
Good thing I have a tomato in my inventory.

1449
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,300
Start the music again.

1450
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:16,460
All right.

1451
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:17,460
That's my pantry.

1452
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:23,640
Why would you have a pantry in the basement?

1453
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,199
I have no idea what that function is for.

1454
01:31:26,199 --> 01:31:30,420
Why does that exist?

1455
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:33,579
Why would you have sleep for a week be an option?

1456
01:31:33,579 --> 01:31:40,890
What does it do if you get injured?

1457
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:50,319
And by the way, speaking of something, there's like four or five bedrooms in this house.

1458
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:52,039
Can I actually get a family in here?

1459
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:58,319
Look at all these rooms.

1460
01:31:58,319 --> 01:31:59,319
There's a seesaw.

1461
01:31:59,319 --> 01:32:01,739
I'll fix that seesaw.

1462
01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:02,739
I'm getting married too.

1463
01:32:02,739 --> 01:32:05,140
Oh, you thought we were going to play this game for like 10 minutes.

1464
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:06,140
Wow.

1465
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:08,319
You were so wrong.

1466
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:09,319
That couldn't have been more incorrect.

1467
01:32:09,319 --> 01:32:16,770
All right.

1468
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:21,850
Is the roof all right?

1469
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:22,850
Do not misunderstand me.

1470
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:29,180
We will never play this game ever again after probably the next day or so, but I ain't playing

1471
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:30,180
this for 10 minutes.

1472
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:40,439
All right.

1473
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:41,439
What about the outside?

1474
01:32:42,210 --> 01:33:06,479
Oh, it's in fucking shambles.

1475
01:33:06,479 --> 01:33:07,479
Go harvest your crops.

1476
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:11,270
I don't have any crops.

1477
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:29,979
This is the game wants me to, I don't have any children with multiple slides.

1478
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:30,979
Rusty metal.

1479
01:33:30,979 --> 01:33:33,060
I'm just shaving down the rusty metal.

1480
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:36,630
Just buy a new one.

1481
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:37,630
How much are these?

1482
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:42,239
How much is a seesaw?

1483
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:47,829
Like it can't be more than like 30 bucks, 40 bucks.

1484
01:33:47,829 --> 01:33:48,829
Repair of the old wood.

1485
01:33:49,109 --> 01:33:50,189
Oh, this is like dangerous.

1486
01:33:50,189 --> 01:33:52,229
Just get a new one.

1487
01:33:52,229 --> 01:33:53,229
Replace the sand in here.

1488
01:33:53,229 --> 01:33:54,670
This is fucking gross.

1489
01:33:54,670 --> 01:34:03,159
There's like shards of glass in here.

1490
01:34:03,159 --> 01:34:04,840
Make sure you repair the rotten wood.

1491
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:19,010
Can you, can I push somebody on the slide eventually?

1492
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:20,010
Wow.

1493
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:22,180
That would be so cool.

1494
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:23,340
This is my farm.

1495
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:24,340
This is my house.

1496
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:31,659
Ain't nobody going to take this from me until the storyline dictates when it should happen.

1497
01:34:31,659 --> 01:34:33,939
But for now, it's mine.

1498
01:34:49,489 --> 01:34:55,250
Wait till we have an Oliver, Oliver's going to turn on me.

1499
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:59,100
Highly doubt it.

1500
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:00,100
Air bricks.

1501
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:03,960
Can't reach it.

1502
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:04,960
Better get a scaffolding.

1503
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,119
But let's check the outside bed.

1504
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,880
Sleeping regularly helps you maintain good health and energy for work.

1505
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,619
Combine sleep with good food.

1506
01:35:11,619 --> 01:35:16,930
You might miss job opportunities when hungry and tired.

1507
01:35:16,930 --> 01:35:18,409
Or for sleeping for a full week.

1508
01:35:18,409 --> 01:35:20,689
I think that's the easiest way to miss an opportunity.

1509
01:35:20,689 --> 01:35:35,000
I don't think that has to do with if I'm hungry today.

1510
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,140
You can use it to turn basic foods into canned ones.

1511
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:39,020
A wife can cook delicious treats.

1512
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:42,159
I don't have a wife.

1513
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:46,350
You're losing food from the pantry.

1514
01:35:46,350 --> 01:35:52,520
Who's this imaginary wife that I have?

1515
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,239
Do I need to get married?

1516
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:55,239
I just got here.

1517
01:35:55,239 --> 01:36:02,270
I don't know any of these fucking people.

1518
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:19,699
All right.

1519
01:36:19,699 --> 01:36:25,180
We're almost at the, I have to go all the way up really.

1520
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:26,659
That looks worse than like it did before.

1521
01:36:26,659 --> 01:36:31,350
How's the outside?

1522
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:32,350
All right.

1523
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:33,350
Time to go up to the second floor.

1524
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:40,270
That's a gigantic chimney.

1525
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:41,270
You can cut that in half.

1526
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:43,260
It would still be fine.

1527
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,859
It's a Minecraft house chimney.

1528
01:36:45,859 --> 01:36:46,859
That's too big.

1529
01:36:46,859 --> 01:36:51,420
Let's get up.

1530
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:52,420
Hey.

1531
01:36:52,420 --> 01:37:00,829
Do I have a well?

1532
01:37:00,829 --> 01:37:02,829
Can I get water out of the well?

1533
01:37:02,829 --> 01:37:05,149
Look at all this other shit I have to repair.

1534
01:37:05,149 --> 01:37:09,779
Can I not go up?

1535
01:37:09,779 --> 01:37:20,430
Shit.

1536
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:27,869
I gotta go this way.

1537
01:37:27,869 --> 01:37:28,869
Delete the scaffolding.

1538
01:37:28,869 --> 01:37:37,470
All right.

1539
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:39,739
Let's get up there.

1540
01:37:39,739 --> 01:37:40,739
All right.

1541
01:37:40,739 --> 01:37:42,300
Repair and another scaffolding.

1542
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:43,300
God damn it.

1543
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:52,729
Am I going to play Half-Life Alex on stream?

1544
01:37:52,729 --> 01:37:55,539
Probably not.

1545
01:37:56,539 --> 01:37:59,060
I mean, no, I don't think so.

1546
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:01,779
No, I don't.

1547
01:38:01,779 --> 01:38:07,859
I mean, no, it's just probably one of the largest technological VR jumps in technology

1548
01:38:07,859 --> 01:38:11,420
and gaming and the history of virtual reality headsets.

1549
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:16,300
I probably will play a free to play horror game that somebody made in three days next

1550
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:31,460
time or a unity farmer game.

1551
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:32,460
You don't know this is made in unity.

1552
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:33,460
How do you know that?

1553
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:35,800
How do you know this is made in unity?

1554
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:36,800
You don't know.

1555
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:41,100
How do you know?

1556
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:43,010
It's not unity.

1557
01:38:43,569 --> 01:38:56,119
This is a proprietary engine that was crafted in-house.

1558
01:38:56,119 --> 01:39:07,289
For all you guys know, this could be better than the frostbite engine.

1559
01:39:07,289 --> 01:39:08,930
This runs better than frostbite engine.

1560
01:39:08,930 --> 01:39:09,930
So yeah.

1561
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:12,000
All right.

1562
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,319
We got I got to get in there.

1563
01:39:14,319 --> 01:39:15,960
The second floor is having problems.

1564
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:18,000
Oh, my shins.

1565
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,300
Don't worry.

1566
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:20,300
Dad's okay.

1567
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:21,300
Dad will be fine.

1568
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:28,300
Upstairs.

1569
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:33,510
What do you mean dad?

1570
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:34,510
Question mark.

1571
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:41,420
Who the fuck do you think I am in this scenario?

1572
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:45,149
How would I not be dad?

1573
01:39:45,149 --> 01:39:48,409
I'm the only one here.

1574
01:39:48,409 --> 01:40:01,180
It's me, dad.

1575
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:05,539
This one piece that's just broken somewhere and I'm never going to find it.

1576
01:40:05,539 --> 01:40:13,819
There it is.

1577
01:40:13,819 --> 01:40:15,979
Oh, fuck off with this.

1578
01:40:15,979 --> 01:40:16,979
Where is it?

1579
01:40:16,979 --> 01:40:36,100
It's the door.

1580
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:37,100
Where is the problem?

1581
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:50,449
What's the issue here?

1582
01:40:50,449 --> 01:40:53,869
What happens if I just sleep for a week?

1583
01:40:53,869 --> 01:40:55,470
Like a hundred times in a row?

1584
01:40:55,470 --> 01:40:59,590
Do we just teleport like 10 years in the future?

1585
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:06,340
It's sleep.

1586
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:09,779
Should I sleep for like 200 years and see what happens?

1587
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:13,579
There's a chest.

1588
01:41:13,579 --> 01:41:14,579
Fish.

1589
01:41:14,579 --> 01:41:16,060
I thought it was a chainsaw.

1590
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:19,819
Fish in aroma oil.

1591
01:41:19,819 --> 01:41:28,659
I don't think this is something you would take out of this chest.

1592
01:41:28,659 --> 01:41:31,979
You would throw this away, but I'm going to eat it.

1593
01:41:31,979 --> 01:41:35,500
But before I eat it, I need to like make a, I have to turn on my YouTube channel video.

1594
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:38,779
I have to, yeah, I have to like videotape me doing this.

1595
01:41:38,779 --> 01:41:45,710
All right.

1596
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:46,710
That's it.

1597
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:47,949
Right?

1598
01:41:47,949 --> 01:41:52,460
What else is left to repair in the house?

1599
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:54,970
There's nothing else here to fix.

1600
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:56,090
Help me out here.

1601
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:02,420
The fences outside.

1602
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:03,420
Does that count as the house?

1603
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:12,449
Did I miss a room?

1604
01:42:12,449 --> 01:42:22,579
I did.

1605
01:42:22,579 --> 01:42:23,579
Yeah.

1606
01:42:23,579 --> 01:42:24,579
All right.

1607
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:32,779
This thing that I don't understand though, is this, all this stuff is like shitty.

1608
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:35,460
Even if I, I want this different wallpaper.

1609
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:39,630
Use the kitchen.

1610
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:40,630
Applesauce.

1611
01:42:40,630 --> 01:42:42,699
Cookbook recipes.

1612
01:42:42,699 --> 01:42:45,380
What about honey based recipes?

1613
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:46,819
Eggs.

1614
01:42:46,819 --> 01:42:47,819
Hot sauce.

1615
01:42:47,819 --> 01:42:49,310
Unknown.

1616
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:50,310
Egg based.

1617
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:51,310
I don't know any of these.

1618
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:59,760
There's food here though, somehow.

1619
01:43:00,119 --> 01:43:02,159
I have to, it's the fence outside that's doing it.

1620
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:03,159
Are you sure?

1621
01:43:03,159 --> 01:43:28,260
You might be right.

1622
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:33,100
I kind of want to save the game and then sleep like fucking a hundred times and just skip

1623
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:40,810
every cut scene and see if we can like teleport 10 years in the future.

1624
01:43:40,810 --> 01:43:53,289
See if the world changes at all.

1625
01:43:53,289 --> 01:43:54,789
Get a family first.

1626
01:43:54,789 --> 01:43:55,789
Yeah.

1627
01:43:55,789 --> 01:43:56,789
Yeah.

1628
01:43:56,789 --> 01:43:57,789
Let's get a family.

1629
01:43:57,789 --> 01:44:04,140
Let's have a wife, have a kid and then sleep for 30 years and see if the kid grows up.

1630
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:05,140
That's not a bad play.

1631
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:14,579
I like that play.

1632
01:44:14,579 --> 01:44:17,420
There is nothing else to fix over here.

1633
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:19,460
Why have I not gotten any social points for this?

1634
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:27,770
I'm going to piss my pants.

1635
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:36,670
I'll be right back.

1636
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:37,670
Pretty good condition.

1637
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:38,670
No families.

1638
01:44:38,670 --> 01:44:39,670
11,000 points.

1639
01:44:39,670 --> 01:44:40,670
All right.

1640
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:41,670
I'll be right back.

1641
01:44:41,670 --> 01:44:42,670
I'm going to pee my pants if I don't get the fuck out of here.

1642
01:44:42,670 --> 01:47:12,649
Right back.

1643
01:47:12,649 --> 01:47:13,649
I'm back.

1644
01:47:13,649 --> 01:47:15,930
I'm going to do this thing now where when I come back, I don't just go like this because

1645
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:18,050
it means I'm gone for three minutes straight.

1646
01:47:18,050 --> 01:47:22,250
Hey, I'm back.

1647
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:23,250
It's like, Jesus.

1648
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:25,529
So I'm going to slowly be like, Hey, I'm back.

1649
01:47:25,529 --> 01:47:26,529
Okay, let's go.

1650
01:47:26,529 --> 01:47:37,500
All right.

1651
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:43,460
The goal here is find a family and then try to artificially age them all by like 10 years.

1652
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:47,750
Well, that's going to be such a waste of time.

1653
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:55,010
You know how long that's going to take.

1654
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:56,010
Game sucks.

1655
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:57,010
Play Half-Life Alex.

1656
01:47:57,010 --> 01:48:04,260
Yeah.

1657
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:06,619
So I'm just going to play this until Half-Life Alex comes out.

1658
01:48:06,619 --> 01:48:07,619
That's what you're saying, right?

1659
01:48:07,619 --> 01:48:08,619
Like, yeah, game sucks.

1660
01:48:08,619 --> 01:48:11,619
Like you should transition over to Half-Life Alex.

1661
01:48:11,619 --> 01:48:12,619
Yeah.

1662
01:48:12,619 --> 01:48:15,720
So in four months or five months, I'll just do this for five months.

1663
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:21,890
That's what you want.

1664
01:48:21,890 --> 01:48:22,890
All right.

1665
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:23,890
Game save.

1666
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:24,890
Let's go.

1667
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:26,710
Just got to fix some more stuff.

1668
01:48:27,369 --> 01:48:28,369
I'm into it right now.

1669
01:48:28,369 --> 01:48:29,369
I'm into this.

1670
01:48:29,369 --> 01:48:39,920
I need to see this through.

1671
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:40,920
Harvest the wheat.

1672
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:41,920
Get mad bucks.

1673
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:42,920
I need to find out why this is not done.

1674
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:50,949
Is there something on the roof I missed?

1675
01:48:50,949 --> 01:48:51,949
You've earned no money.

1676
01:48:51,949 --> 01:48:53,869
It's not all about the money.

1677
01:48:53,869 --> 01:48:55,680
Okay.

1678
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,479
It's not about the money.

1679
01:48:57,479 --> 01:49:01,159
Sometimes it's about just having fun and relaxing and making a farm.

1680
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:04,279
It's always about money with you guys.

1681
01:49:04,279 --> 01:49:05,560
Money, money, money.

1682
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:09,180
You should make more money.

1683
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:12,500
I'm always about how I want to just do something because I want to.

1684
01:49:13,340 --> 01:49:14,340
It's the basement.

1685
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:25,029
Is it the basement?

1686
01:49:25,029 --> 01:49:28,550
That's such a huge fall and it's funny that it didn't happen.

1687
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:32,340
No, there's nothing in here that's broken.

1688
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:43,239
Nothing in here.

1689
01:49:43,239 --> 01:49:44,399
Damn it.

1690
01:49:44,399 --> 01:49:47,000
What is the one little thing that's wrong?

1691
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,569
The well?

1692
01:49:51,569 --> 01:49:56,550
There's one tiny thing wrong with this house that I can't figure it out.

1693
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:58,699
Hold on.

1694
01:49:58,699 --> 01:50:12,880
Is there no bathroom in this house?

1695
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:24,899
We don't have a bathroom.

1696
01:50:24,899 --> 01:50:32,739
Why is there not a bathroom in the house?

1697
01:50:32,739 --> 01:50:41,319
It's a huge, huge issue if this is going the outhouse.

1698
01:50:41,319 --> 01:50:42,319
There is no outhouse.

1699
01:50:42,319 --> 01:50:45,840
Are we just supposed to shit into the well?

1700
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:49,640
All right.

1701
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:51,000
Well, I don't know what's wrong with it.

1702
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,960
Is the gazebo broken?

1703
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,439
No, this is normal.

1704
01:50:56,439 --> 01:50:58,840
It's ugly, but it's normal.

1705
01:50:58,840 --> 01:50:59,840
Grain storage.

1706
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,840
Okay.

1707
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:01,840
I have to make some money.

1708
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:10,510
Dog house.

1709
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:11,510
How do I get a dog?

1710
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:12,510
I still don't understand what...

1711
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:13,510
Wait, there it is.

1712
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:18,520
I see it.

1713
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:24,760
No, I don't.

1714
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:25,760
What's the problem?

1715
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:29,130
I've got to get up there before I delete this because there's a scaffolding all over the

1716
01:51:29,130 --> 01:51:30,130
damn house.

1717
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:38,220
All right.

1718
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:41,699
Delete it.

1719
01:51:41,699 --> 01:51:42,699
I don't want scaffolding on my house.

1720
01:51:42,699 --> 01:51:52,770
Delete it.

1721
01:51:52,770 --> 01:51:56,000
Follow the arrow.

1722
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,479
What do I have for a mission?

1723
01:51:57,479 --> 01:52:02,300
Complete repairs on your farm.

1724
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:04,500
I have this fucking dumb place.

1725
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:08,640
God, this is going to be great.

1726
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:13,460
Great.

1727
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:14,460
Is it a balcony window?

1728
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:21,800
I'll check it out in a minute.

1729
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:26,220
We're not going to get a family unless I make this place a home.

1730
01:52:26,220 --> 01:52:35,380
I'm not going to impress anybody that comes over here if it's the exact same thing as

1731
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:38,779
if to take somebody to like an old abandoned hospital.

1732
01:52:38,779 --> 01:52:40,720
Yeah.

1733
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:41,720
You want to see where I live?

1734
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:42,720
Yeah.

1735
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:43,720
Let's go to you.

1736
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:44,720
Let's go to your house.

1737
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:47,239
Yeah.

1738
01:52:47,239 --> 01:52:48,239
Sure.

1739
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:49,239
Come on over here.

1740
01:52:49,239 --> 01:52:50,420
Cool.

1741
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:51,420
Yeah.

1742
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:52,420
We're pulling up now.

1743
01:52:52,420 --> 01:52:53,420
What do you think?

1744
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:54,420
What do you think about my old fucking haunted house YouTube channel?

1745
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:55,420
Abandoned hospital.

1746
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:58,380
Let's walk through it.

1747
01:52:58,380 --> 01:52:59,380
It has to look at least okay.

1748
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:12,210
What is this?

1749
01:53:12,210 --> 01:53:13,210
Grain storage?

1750
01:53:13,210 --> 01:53:14,210
All right.

1751
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:19,430
There's a lot of stuff I need to know.

1752
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:20,430
What is all this?

1753
01:53:20,430 --> 01:53:21,430
Okay.

1754
01:53:21,430 --> 01:53:22,430
Stop.

1755
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:23,430
Stop getting distracted.

1756
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:24,430
That's the only thing only.

1757
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:25,430
That's the only thing I need to do right now.

1758
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:26,430
That's it.

1759
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:29,340
Nothing else.

1760
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:30,340
Repair only.

1761
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:37,750
Make sure I save the game there too.

1762
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:53,319
That would be such a painful disaster if this is like my I have my own gas station.

1763
01:53:53,319 --> 01:53:58,979
You have your own gas station on a farm.

1764
01:53:58,979 --> 01:54:06,350
I pull shit in there to pump my own tank.

1765
01:54:06,350 --> 01:54:08,340
That's kind of cool.

1766
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:09,340
I got to get up.

1767
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:21,460
Get up top.

1768
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:31,960
I got to get all the way up though.

1769
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:32,960
Yeah.

1770
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:37,399
There we go.

1771
01:54:37,399 --> 01:54:38,399
Sit.

1772
01:54:38,399 --> 01:54:39,399
Sit.

1773
01:54:39,399 --> 01:54:48,449
Sit.

1774
01:54:48,449 --> 01:54:49,449
Shit all right.

1775
01:54:49,449 --> 01:54:50,449
He says sit.

1776
01:54:50,449 --> 01:54:51,449
Sit.

1777
01:54:51,449 --> 01:54:52,449
Sit.

1778
01:54:52,449 --> 01:54:53,449
Sit.

1779
01:54:53,449 --> 01:54:54,449
Sit.

1780
01:54:54,449 --> 01:54:59,779
Sit.

1781
01:54:59,779 --> 01:55:00,779
Sit.

1782
01:55:00,779 --> 01:55:01,779
It's not so bad getting up top in the middle.

1783
01:55:01,779 --> 01:55:05,710
Now, I don't want you to put me up top either, I don't want you out the bat.

1784
01:55:05,710 --> 01:55:07,930
All right, I'll mark this, I'll mark this.

1785
01:55:07,930 --> 01:55:08,810
I'm going to go on top of it.

1786
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:14,770
I'm going to go on top of the camera man.

1787
01:55:14,770 --> 01:55:16,109
I'm going to try to make that count for a while or whatever.

1788
01:55:16,109 --> 01:55:19,069
I lost until m we're gonna get close to the wall which is the goal.

1789
01:55:19,069 --> 01:55:21,840
That was great.

1790
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:22,840
Let's go.

1791
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:23,840
Go.

1792
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:24,840
Go.

1793
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:25,840
Go.

1794
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:36,300
Go.

1795
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:43,479

01:57:50,340 --> 01:58:01,630
artificial rooms and then decorate them and take you through it okay that's do

1813
01:58:01,630 --> 01:58:18,560
I think that's done oh fuck hello there's so many repairs to do they would

1814
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:24,399
take too much effort ah it would take a lot of prep but I don't think it would

1815
01:58:24,399 --> 01:58:32,640
be too big all I would need to do is just put up like a wood and then just

1816
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:39,859
have like some drywall just just make like a fake room in like a studio be at

1817
01:58:39,859 --> 01:58:44,859
beyond studio and have like three small rooms made that can have like couches

1818
01:58:44,859 --> 01:59:01,079
and furniture and stuff in them like a TV show set yeah that's I'm saying it

1819
01:59:01,079 --> 01:59:05,079
wouldn't be like a full house it would be like the Seinfeld set but I would

1820
01:59:05,079 --> 01:59:24,380
just have to decorate it and paint it dollhouse the German dollhouse have

1821
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:28,260
multiple floors and what's just weird the camera zooms out I like walk up the

1822
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:34,590
stairs I get into the bed oh this is comfy that would be real-life sims

1823
01:59:34,630 --> 01:59:41,119

1825
01:59:46,359 --> 02:00:14,760
sims but it was just me in a house that would be really really creepy that would

1826
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:21,630
be scary in a way because I would be acting like a sim I wouldn't be

1827
02:00:21,630 --> 02:00:25,310
speaking English or anything I'd be talking like sim and you guys have to

1892
02:14:01,590 --> 02:14:13,560
labor because it's you don't know that it sucks yet we haven't gotten that far

1893
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:28,539

1894
02:14:28,739 --> 02:14:36,840
minute you're on the tutorial yes I am just wait till I get my own seeds that's

1896
02:14:51,319 --> 02:15:19,189
here this is the first strand type game what are you talking about this is the

1897
02:15:19,189 --> 02:15:25,430
best way you to pretend to work how's it going out there that's going good I'm

1898
02:15:25,430 --> 02:15:33,090
just uh shooting compressed air into a board of sheet metal if there was like

1899
02:15:33,090 --> 02:15:41,310
60 people on this job I could blend in pretty quickly all right see that didn't

1900
02:15:41,310 --> 02:16:04,439
take as long as you thought it was going to done almost you're a movie extra

1901
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:19,319
yeah why is everything to be the same color why is everything great the okay

1902
02:16:19,319 --> 02:16:32,500
though everything's just metal what what does that do oh I'm just shooting water

1903
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:41,659
all over me I probably shouldn't have electricity in here well I'm hungry on

1904

riot trying my best now he's stuck forever it's gonna be up a little bit

2636
05:25:00,840 --> 05:26:03,000

2637
05:26:03,000 --> 05:26:24,279
again I need to get him on the roof but I can't I have to stop what if I turn the

2638
05:26:24,279 --> 05:27:02,569
volume down is that gonna go I had him it's so hard to keep it steady because

2639
05:27:02,569 --> 05:27:11,180
it just rips around in so many directions all right I thought I'm gonna

2640
05:27:11,180 --> 05:27:21,130
play the game I have to play the game now I have to stop I will sit here for

2641
05:27:21,130 --> 05:27:27,450
like three days and do this my brain is so fucked up I will be here all day last

2642
05:27:27,450 --> 05:27:51,549
chance here we go this is the last opportunity no the roof it's gonna kill

2643
05:27:51,549 --> 05:28:13,709
me it's gonna kill me he's right here oh it's no it's too hard to control it

2644
05:28:13,709 --> 05:28:50,549
really is it's so difficult hold on quiet ah oh my god I'm gonna lose my mind I

2645
05:28:50,590 --> 05:29:04,810
have to do this I'm gonna lose my fucking mind I did it twice oh it's so

2646
05:29:04,810 --> 05:29:27,299
difficult this is the heart it's a harder than the last boss in secure no

2647
05:29:27,299 --> 05:29:31,939
no it's got you it's got to be in one fucking swoop it has to be perfect

2649
05:29:46,799 --> 05:29:56,459
that's been doing this for two hours I trust me no not it wasn't perfect

2650
05:29:56,779 --> 05:30:07,419
because to be able to get under in the first place you have to go fast enough

2651
05:30:07,419 --> 05:30:11,900
for the game to why are you even explaining this even describing what I

2652
05:30:11,900 --> 05:30:18,849
have to can I use a controller I'd be probably harder what is the joke here

2653
05:30:18,849 --> 05:30:30,349
there is none I just want to pick him up and put him on the roof this is not a

2654
05:30:30,349 --> 05:30:47,939
joke I just like how my brain is just fucking fried and I have to do this I'm

05:30:56,740 --> 05:30:59,900
like I have to glitch into the ground all right this is not a terrible

2657
05:31:00,060 --> 05:31:05,060
opportunity here and you got to get near the back wheels directly right in the

2658
05:31:05,060 --> 05:31:47,220
middle of the car I fucked it up no no you have to go up and then like scream

2738
05:53:56,919 --> 05:54:07,290
Sally what do you mean Wow wait like it's this thing oh this sucks this is the

2739
05:54:07,290 --> 05:54:10,729
only farming content that's been on the whole stream is scraping the dirt

2740
05:54:10,729 --> 05:55:08,299
sometimes this is so much bigger too this is five times larger how much it

2741
05:55:08,299 --> 05:55:11,380
what's your field is isn't this that doesn't count as your field right no

2742
05:55:11,380 --> 05:55:14,139
don't touch it don't touch it don't touch it get off get off get off get off

2743
05:55:14,139 --> 05:55:37,500
that was close no this is not even close it's just this how much I have to do

2744
05:55:37,500 --> 05:55:59,979
this is too much I got to do in chunks this is what you do when you farm so

2745
05:55:59,979 --> 05:56:06,569
farming is not driving around looking for tomatoes and desperately trying to

2746
05:56:06,569 --> 05:56:22,310
find a wife and flying a drone around this is what you do all right if I give

2747
05:56:22,310 --> 05:56:26,669
up right now can I just knock on her door and be like hey I'm done I don't

2748
05:56:26,669 --> 05:56:33,189
want to do anymore just can you pay me like 8% like 4% of what I was gonna get

2749
05:56:33,189 --> 05:56:41,740
I don't feel like doing this and I just have like if it was gonna cost like 500

2750
05:56:41,740 --> 05:56:50,619
bucks to do this can you just give me like $12 also also you want to get

2751
05:56:50,619 --> 05:57:00,490
married let's have a bunch of children too so please marry me

2752
05:57:04,259 --> 05:57:13,540
marry me you're giving us city folk a bad name why would anybody that lives in

2753
05:57:13,540 --> 05:57:21,319
the city know how to do this that's okay why would you expect somebody that has

2754
05:57:21,319 --> 05:57:40,290
lived in this city their whole life to be able to know how to plow a field is

2755
05:57:40,290 --> 05:57:58,259
it disappearing on me like I did this already like four times okay why don't I

2756
05:57:58,259 --> 05:58:07,950
just hire like 25 people to all bring their tractor and then we all start

2757
05:58:07,990 --> 05:58:14,299
side by side by side by side by side all start at the same time and just drive

2758
05:58:14,299 --> 05:58:30,200
forward once how much more work could we get done instead of taking 12 hours to

2759
05:58:30,200 --> 05:58:41,060
do this just do it in 12 minutes and then drive to the next one and in one

2760
05:58:41,060 --> 05:59:06,580
day we could do every single field in the whole county that's a utopian

2761
05:59:06,580 --> 05:59:13,459
utopian streamer he's a giant tractor that's another one too why not just

2762
05:59:13,459 --> 05:59:18,659
build a tractor that's just like this looks exactly the same except it's 100

2763
05:59:18,659 --> 05:59:28,040
times larger the seat could be the same size it's it's just as big as four or

2764
05:59:28,040 --> 05:59:37,490
five houses put together so you're just driving this huge-ass mothership across

2765
05:59:37,490 --> 06:00:01,060
the plane and doing it one just drive forward once you ever mowed a lawn

2766
06:00:01,619 --> 06:00:10,080
yes and if the lawnmower was as big as my house I could just sit it in the

2767
06:00:10,080 --> 06:00:14,319
backyard turn on the blades and then turn them off and the yard would be cut

2768
06:00:14,319 --> 06:00:21,779
now granted that would be a catastrophic death machine it would be

2769
06:00:21,779 --> 06:00:38,400
immensely dangerous but then you then you have a lawnmower instead of a yard

2770
06:00:38,400 --> 06:00:42,680
that the grass just grows up to the blades and then you turn on the giant

2771
06:00:42,680 --> 06:00:46,479
blades and then turn it off you don't even get a you don't have to get to

2772
06:00:46,479 --> 06:01:03,119
have a backyard no it would be on a mechanism that the blade was up like 60

2773
06:01:03,119 --> 06:01:07,240
feet like a hundred feet or something hovering over the yard you could play

2774
06:01:07,240 --> 06:01:10,040
out there you can have fun you can hang out back there and then you would lower

2775
06:01:10,040 --> 06:01:28,259
it down to cut the grass just don't have grass that's another one too just have

2776
06:01:28,259 --> 06:01:33,049
like just paved your backyard you know how much coolest shit you can have in

2777
06:01:33,049 --> 06:01:36,090
your backyard with a paved backyard you can have a basketball court you have

2778
06:01:36,090 --> 06:02:08,119
tennis courts what is all the rain go to the drain that you have built in the

2779
06:02:08,119 --> 06:02:13,020
middle of the backyard a huge drain you didn't think I thought about that a

2780
06:02:13,020 --> 06:02:17,979
giant drain that's connected to the sewer system and it just there you go you

2781
06:02:17,979 --> 06:02:20,340
can put a shower back there you could have like a bunch of showers in your

2782
06:02:20,340 --> 06:02:42,180
backyard draw a penis already all right well I'm gonna try to spell something

2783
06:02:42,180 --> 06:02:45,700
and I'll look at it with the drone I don't even care if I fuck up somebody's

2784
06:02:46,139 --> 06:03:15,139
I'll be done with this game in like 20 minutes anyway but does it have to be

2785
06:03:15,139 --> 06:03:33,919
this slow why can't you attach this to a go-kart those things go 20 no power to

2786
06:03:33,919 --> 06:04:04,779
pull time is it I'm like very tired and very hungry and it's like okay I guess

2787
06:04:04,779 --> 06:04:24,639
we're gonna just keep doing it it's almost done anyways I can't quit before

06:04:33,240 --> 06:04:38,639
gonna have to play this game before I'm allowed to have children I know I wanted

2790
06:04:38,639 --> 06:04:47,700
to go into a coma for 20 years but I gotta get I have to get married just

2791
06:04:47,700 --> 06:05:22,630
don't fuck around with drones yes I can see what I've done it's bad it's really

2792
06:05:22,630 --> 06:05:28,000
bad I don't know that I just gonna stay with stick with what I was doing before

2796
06:06:22,259 --> 06:06:30,240

2798
06:06:42,459 --> 06:06:49,020
certainty that there is a relaxing sleep sounds music video on YouTube that

is tractor sounds guaranteed yeah it's already there of course it is let's play

2800
06:07:15,159 --> 06:07:24,470
a game well I finished this name a thing that makes noise and is it a YouTube

2801
06:07:24,470 --> 06:07:34,729
video that's four hours long of sound effects for you to sleep to fish yep

2806
06:08:09,880 --> 06:08:34,619
would make a new rule if it exists there's a sleep soundtrack for it

2807
06:08:34,619 --> 06:08:49,080

06:47:32,229 --> 06:47:35,470
between 50,000 and 90,000 points if you're lower than 50,000 you might have

2950
06:47:35,470 --> 06:47:40,389
to talk to the ladies more often okay talk to ladies everywhere on the map I

2951
06:47:40,389 --> 06:47:44,950
talked to most of them got 50 social points per conversation complimenting

2952
06:47:44,950 --> 06:47:47,509
them you can right-click to skip the dialogue you don't have to listen to the

2953
06:47:47,509 --> 06:47:52,009
whole conversation I talked to the women about once every two days to make sure

2954
06:47:52,009 --> 06:48:00,729
the timer actually resets well I've been sleeping months in weeks since one game

2955
06:48:00,729 --> 06:48:04,689
hour is about five minutes that means 12 hours in game you can talk to the

2956
06:48:04,689 --> 06:48:17,060
ladies wait what you can only compliment them once per real hour since one game

2957
06:48:17,060 --> 06:48:44,729
hour is five minutes it means 12 hours in game to talk to them but I'm sleeping

2958
06:48:44,729 --> 06:49:07,849
for months I'm sleeping for months the clock on the PC put your computer clock

2959
06:49:07,849 --> 06:49:12,860
forward does that work hold on if I make my computer clock an hour ahead will it

2960
06:49:12,860 --> 06:49:30,150

2961
06:49:30,150 --> 06:49:34,830
it work yeah I guys why would that work this is not like a this is not a DS

2962
06:49:34,830 --> 06:49:56,470
just try it okay it's I'm making it I'm making it I'm gonna make it nine I'm

2963
06:49:56,470 --> 06:50:00,560

2964
06:50:00,560 --> 06:50:23,169
adjust date and time okay set time to change date and time let's make it like

2965
06:50:23,169 --> 06:50:45,970
I don't know fucking ten like 10 p.m. 1041 p.m. I have to come back I have to

2966
06:50:45,970 --> 06:50:53,650
come back I don't know why that fucked up the stream I think the time

2967
06:50:53,650 --> 06:50:58,810
synchronization there it may I guess it's like that the twitch doesn't like

2968
06:50:58,810 --> 06:51:11,479
that so I don't know I'm not gonna do that you literally traveled to through

2969
06:51:11,479 --> 06:51:16,240
time okay I can't do that because the streaming software into twitch does not

2970
06:51:16,240 --> 06:51:23,020
like that I'm pretending it's 1040 p.m. for some reason it's counting how many

minutes you actually play great no I'm not gonna get a trainer you are not

2972

going to watch me download a trainer and put it on this engine on stream and plus

2973
06:52:15,880 --> 06:52:19,000
the trainer doesn't even do anything the trainer gives you super speed and

2974
06:52:19,000 --> 06:52:25,419
unlimited money I can't change the time I can't change the time it's not good

2975
06:52:25,419 --> 06:52:35,880
that you can't change the time the stuff I was doing should work it doesn't care

2976
06:52:35,880 --> 06:52:43,840
how long I'm playing all right well hold on what if we do this is there a way I

2977

3045
07:13:59,139 --> 07:14:37,580
last full year of this guy's life had to call a tow truck I can't even destroy

3046
07:14:37,580 --> 07:15:08,729

3047
07:15:08,729 --> 07:15:40,529
player solitude I'm gonna go live on the beach wait how is this player solitude

3048
07:15:40,529 --> 07:17:05,389
when somebody lives here this is the first spot that I came to I actually got

3049
07:17:05,389 --> 07:17:21,590
off on this beach I rode up thought I could just throw myself into the world

3050
07:17:21,590 --> 07:17:35,919
of farming like people do Hollywood a lot harder than that I thought it could

3051
07:17:35,919 --> 07:18:05,560
have been easy this is the spot slept a lot but you know I was tired four years

3052
07:18:05,560 --> 07:18:14,630
ago when I arrived here the boat was parked on this beach it looks like

3053
07:18:14,630 --> 07:18:21,200
somebody stole that from me it looks like there's an invisible wall that you

3054
07:18:21,240 --> 07:18:29,409
can't cross you know just like in life how many invisible walls do we have set

3055
07:18:29,409 --> 07:18:36,360
up for ourselves the world is teaching me something right now I'm being shown

3056
07:18:36,360 --> 07:19:24,180
something very important that I need to try this with a truck it's time to

3057
07:19:24,180 --> 07:19:54,270
break down those barriers social points some how many likes you can get on

3058
07:19:54,270 --> 07:19:57,770
Twitter how many that doesn't matter to me and once it doesn't matter it stops

3059
07:19:58,369 --> 07:20:17,189
as you see every mountain is hard to climb it's about getting over those

3060
07:20:17,189 --> 07:20:56,150
mountains if the water seems too deep call on a friend oh no friends no hold on

3061
07:20:56,150 --> 07:21:16,619
when friends come in all shapes and sizes it broke it I broke the drone and

3062
07:21:16,619 --> 07:21:42,340
my other friends dead I have to run to a gas station now damn it it's sometimes a

3063
07:21:42,340 --> 07:22:07,020
stranger the kindness of a stranger it's all it takes but our furry

3064
07:22:07,020 --> 07:22:36,040
companions are the true friends what a boring fucking animal stop I need to get

3065
07:22:36,040 --> 07:23:10,029

3069
07:23:48,299 --> 07:23:56,139
material things need to be let go oh well you fucking just get an AI oil

3070
07:23:56,139 --> 07:24:07,099

hi care to talk good morning care to trade that's not enough I need to yeah

3073
07:25:03,779 --> 07:25:08,979
walking into Starbucks and asking the barista behind the counter if they'd

3074
07:25:08,979 --> 07:25:15,869
like to buy a $4,500 drunk I think you're gonna probably want to sleep on that

3075
07:25:15,869 --> 07:25:31,009
one all right tow truck where's my truck and sometimes you get a call on a

3076
07:25:31,009 --> 07:26:26,299
friend to pull you out no mountain news do I but that spot one spot that one

3077
07:26:26,299 --> 07:27:10,159
little spot I don't know I'm trying to get I'm trying to add sounds to the game

3078
07:27:10,159 --> 07:27:18,779
cuz there are no sounds that spot that my grandfather brought me to all those

3079
07:27:18,779 --> 07:27:50,959
years ago it's one of my favorite things when it used to be a kid and

3080
07:27:50,959 --> 07:28:05,479
sometimes you got a call on a friend more than once where's the beach where's

3081
07:28:05,479 --> 07:28:27,830
the beach guys this video they're dropping cars out of the sky why are

3082
07:28:27,830 --> 07:28:37,490
they doing this there are the dropping cars are coming from the sky in frame it

3083
07:28:37,490 --> 07:28:52,819
doesn't make any sense all right can I get in here now

3084
07:28:52,819 --> 07:29:43,409
hey holy shit it broke okay I made it that this old truck since I was 17 I

3085
07:29:43,409 --> 07:29:48,860
first got my permit when even that grandfather drove this over in our boat

3086
07:29:48,860 --> 07:31:36,619
it's a long paddle and sometimes you call on a friend sometimes you have to

3087
07:31:36,619 --> 07:32:35,340
try to glitch into the wall like you do on the houses sometimes you need to call

3088
07:32:35,340 --> 07:32:41,750
on a friend not this time this time we do it on our own

3089
07:32:41,750 --> 07:33:17,840
push sometimes you got to give up sometimes you got to give up sometimes

3090
07:33:17,840 --> 07:33:21,799
you want to go get a large greasy ass pizza so you don't want to do this

3091
07:33:21,799 --> 07:34:25,939
anymore I'm going to bed sometimes you got to go to bed although interesting

3092
07:34:25,939 --> 07:34:30,759
sometimes you have to stick around because there's an invisible wall next

3093
07:34:30,759 --> 07:34:37,020
to me and an invisible wall in front of me we're not leaving yet I can't leave I

3094
07:34:37,020 --> 07:34:44,319
can only go this way I think I did get out into the invisible wall because this

3095
07:34:44,319 --> 07:34:50,529
is blocked and this is blocked let's see what happens I'm going over this

3096
07:34:50,529 --> 07:35:07,139
waterfall can I I wonder what happens here can I actually make it over is it

3097
07:35:07,139 --> 07:35:16,840
moving I can't tell if it's getting closer or not no I found the true end

3098
07:35:16,840 --> 07:35:35,389
this is the true end yep that's it we're just stuck in the water forever but

3099
07:35:35,389 --> 07:35:52,009
sometimes alright see you guys tomorrow we're gonna play sniper contracts

3100
07:35:52,009 --> 07:36:04,659
tomorrow who knows if it's gonna be any good it could be terrible but I'm

3101
07:36:04,659 --> 07:36:13,540
willing to give it a try oh no everything is broken can I even change

3102
07:36:13,540 --> 07:36:20,169
scenes in OBS from the time traveling thing when I went for two hours it just

3103
07:36:20,169 --> 07:36:34,090
fucked everything up I think I can do it manually through here let me see can

3104
07:36:34,090 --> 07:36:44,490
I I can all right cool I don't think I can play the music though this is like

3105
07:36:44,490 --> 07:36:57,750
broken let me try to reopen this thanks for watching though guys that was a

3106
07:36:57,750 --> 07:37:04,220
farming destiny but whatever the damn thing is called farming whatever it's

3107
07:37:04,220 --> 07:37:22,509

3108
07:37:22,549 --> 07:37:35,209
yes I can I can't even open a media file on my computer we're going musicless

3109
07:37:35,209 --> 07:37:44,919

3110
07:37:44,919 --> 07:38:02,200
force quit it must I'm still library okay let's try this there we go all

3111
07:38:02,200 --> 07:38:10,540
right good although I can't see how loud this is because my my actual OBS is

3112
07:38:10,580 --> 07:38:17,409
completely broken I have no idea if this is too loud or I can't I can't tell am I

3113
07:38:17,409 --> 07:38:28,450
fixing it because I don't have an indicator how's that now it's too quiet

3114
07:38:28,450 --> 07:38:37,119

for experiencing with me I thought it was a fun game I just didn't know that

3182
07:47:33,180 --> 07:47:39,669
you had to actually spend like 12 hours in game to do anything it was it was

3183
07:47:39,669 --> 07:47:46,250
enjoyable a game doesn't have to be like nine out of ten on IGN to be an

3184
07:47:46,250 --> 07:47:51,819
enjoyable experience and you make your own fun sometimes that's more fun than

3185
07:47:51,819 --> 07:48:03,340
when you don't there's a good amount of water in here yeah he was about to say

3186
07:48:03,340 --> 07:48:14,380
good it has something for everyone farming simulator doesn't have drone

3187
07:48:14,380 --> 07:48:23,060
car flipping if you want your own car flipping in your game why is there a

3188
07:48:23,060 --> 07:48:30,259
drone in this game there's no camera on that drone you don't take pictures with

3189
07:48:30,259 --> 07:48:43,880
it why is it in the game just because that's just cool there's no farming

3190
07:48:43,880 --> 07:48:54,180
reason farmers use drones maybe they do red walrus thanks for the 346 hey tomato

3216
07:51:24,069 --> 07:51:44,340
sell him your drone he got busy and I got busy and then he got busy and I got

3218
07:51:59,860 --> 07:52:06,830
play something it'll be fun it's been on the docket for like a year so well let

3219
07:52:06,830 --> 07:52:16,400
him up tonight see what he's doing you had over 4,000 people watching you try

3220
07:52:16,400 --> 07:52:26,310
to stack cars when you didn't say a word for five minutes it's crazy but I

3221
07:52:26,310 --> 07:52:38,819
failed I didn't do it that was the worst part I was trying and I failed I think

3222
07:52:38,819 --> 07:52:45,349
I've mentioned this a bunch of times before but if this was if this was

3223
07:52:45,349 --> 07:52:56,439
youtube.com slash German 985 from 2013 2014 I would have sat there every day

3224
07:52:56,439 --> 07:53:03,729
until I got that car on that roof even if it took 20 straight hours and it

3225
07:53:03,729 --> 07:53:15,729
would have been one clip in the video that would have been a total of about

3226
07:53:15,729 --> 07:53:22,799
eight seconds or nine seconds of time in the video but when you're on broadcast

3227
07:53:22,799 --> 07:53:27,849
and you're on a stream you got to move on sometimes you can't keep trying to

3228
07:53:27,849 --> 07:53:39,080
get the one thing you want yeah you know I'm willing to give it a shot so you're

3229
07:53:39,080 --> 07:53:43,360
saying is you don't care that much anymore no what I'm saying is if I turned

3230
07:53:43,400 --> 07:53:47,959
on my stream tomorrow and started moving a car with a drone with the same game

3231
07:53:47,959 --> 07:53:53,560
and that's what the stream was for seven straight hours and then I did that again

3232
07:53:53,560 --> 07:53:59,380
the next day I think I think people would be like I don't want to watch you

3233
07:53:59,380 --> 07:54:06,220
do this at all I don't want to see this and this is the you stream like three

3234
07:54:06,220 --> 07:54:09,040
sometimes four times a week this is what we're getting for the whole week and

3235
07:54:09,040 --> 07:54:14,419
then you're gonna take like a few days off okay well that was that was a cool

3236
07:54:14,419 --> 07:54:32,560
week of trying to get a car on a roof all right those aren't real fans it

3237
07:54:32,560 --> 07:54:37,340

3243
07:55:19,299 --> 07:55:30,840

3261
07:57:36,220 --> 07:57:42,409
cream it's probably the easiest thing to possibly do then do it I don't have an

3262
07:57:42,409 --> 07:57:46,360
ice cream machine well I don't what I'm supposed to go buy an ice cream maker

3263
07:57:46,360 --> 07:57:50,279
then make my own banana ice cream that's actually a pretty good idea nice idea

3264
07:57:50,319 --> 07:57:59,259
good idea really good I'm gonna do that yeah cool I'm gonna get it I'm gonna get

3265
07:57:59,259 --> 07:58:06,990
an ice cream machine and I'm gonna make banana ice cream I'll make it better but

3266
07:58:06,990 --> 07:58:12,750
yeah banana cream pie is the best banana cream pie is better than chocolate

3267
07:58:12,750 --> 07:58:17,520
cream pie I think because chocolate cream pie is just fudge with whipped cream

3268
07:58:17,520 --> 07:58:30,400
on it let's be honest as banana creams way better it's just it's just mousse

3269
07:58:30,400 --> 07:58:34,880
it's just chocolate mousse with whipped cream all over it that's not I don't

3270
07:58:34,880 --> 07:58:47,090
think that's as special but German banana cream pie is just banana custard

3271
07:58:47,090 --> 07:58:53,869
with cream on it stop stop it don't get out of here get out of my room get out

3272
07:58:53,869 --> 07:59:04,919
of my room I'm just trying to get out of my fucking room all right Jesus some

3273
07:59:04,919 --> 07:59:11,279
people just come in and they just talk shit to me would you eat Dorito ice

3274
07:59:11,279 --> 07:59:16,439
cream no that's just I don't like to put bacon on my ice cream either people

3275
07:59:16,439 --> 07:59:25,409
look at put big look at a big bacon ice cream no I don't know that's too much

3276
07:59:25,409 --> 07:59:38,819
for me would you eat chocolate dough yes I would eat chocolate ice cream I love

3277
07:59:38,860 --> 07:59:48,490
chocolate ice cream cool rank ice cream flavors strawberry smooth without any

3278
07:59:48,490 --> 07:59:54,310
strawberry bits or pieces in it just strawberry flavored ice cream and I know

3279
07:59:54,310 --> 07:59:58,430
yeah oh he's a serial killer serial killer he's he's a serious killing he's

3280
07:59:58,430 --> 08:00:04,720
a serial killer no not sherbert just strawberry flavored ice cream plain plain

3281
08:00:04,720 --> 08:00:16,159
banana ice cream plain chocolate ice cream plain he sees case case killing

3282
08:00:16,159 --> 08:00:19,000
people and eating them he's eating he probably eats people I know I know what

3283
08:00:19,000 --> 08:00:25,520
you're saying I but I really do believe that straight-up just flavored strawberry

3284
08:00:25,520 --> 08:00:40,299
smooth ice cream is the best no no tearless no I know maybe tomorrow

3285
08:00:40,299 --> 08:00:45,009
well get it get me some good tearless maybe we'll do them tomorrow cuz sniper

3286
08:00:45,009 --> 08:00:50,270
contracts is gonna last like 38 minutes I'm gonna play it for like an hour and

3287
08:00:50,270 --> 08:00:53,869
I'm gonna be like this game's stupid and then we'll I already bought it so I'm

3288
08:00:53,869 --> 08:00:59,200
not gonna this is what we're doing I'm going in with low expectations so if the

3289
08:00:59,200 --> 08:01:09,650
game's actually good then we'll play the whole thing but let's finish up the bits

3290
08:01:09,650 --> 08:01:14,409
thank you stardust flair for the 300 bits thanks Jermis so many laughs tonight

3291
08:01:14,409 --> 08:01:20,700
and an amazing stream thank you glad you had a good time I did too

3292
08:01:20,700 --> 08:01:25,959
flug boy thanks for the 250 nearing the end of death stranding it's definitely my

3293
08:01:25,959 --> 08:01:30,439
game of the year it's not for everyone but it's a Kojima game for sure not

3294
08:01:30,439 --> 08:01:36,759
sure if you got your hands on it I have not I'm probably not going to play it

3295
08:01:36,759 --> 08:01:43,639
anytime soon because I heard it is it's something it's like a 50 hour game to

3296
08:01:43,639 --> 08:01:48,259
get to the end if you're like a 40 to 60 hour game that is that correct I don't

3297
08:01:48,259 --> 08:01:56,659
think I I'm not sure I'm ready to commit like 50 plus hours to a game at the

3298
08:01:56,659 --> 08:02:01,430
moment unless it was on stream because for the most part when I play video

3299
08:02:01,430 --> 08:02:05,880
games I play them on stream it's just kind of when I game at this point is I

3300
08:02:06,400 --> 08:02:12,270
do some stuff off stream and played God of War a little bit but 40 is standard

3301
08:02:12,270 --> 08:02:26,700
yeah it looks cool that's just something I don't think I would stream if it's a

3302
08:02:26,700 --> 08:02:32,090
game of the year that's good hey better late than never right we are almost at

3303
08:02:32,090 --> 08:02:43,049
the end of November game of the year but they say also that new Star Wars game

3304
08:02:43,049 --> 08:02:48,659
I'm hearing is very secure Oh like you should check it out you guys gotta help

3305
08:02:48,659 --> 08:02:57,419
me out on this one cuz I it's every time that new Star Wars game comes up

3306
08:02:57,419 --> 08:03:04,180
it's like don't play that shitty game it's boring and sucks and like the

3307
08:03:04,180 --> 08:03:09,830
middle five to ten hours of that game is dogshit and then another group of

3308
08:03:09,830 --> 08:03:14,590
people say it's so it's great it's so good you're gonna love it it's like fuck

3309
08:03:14,590 --> 08:03:23,479
this like it's like so split what I've been told is that it's fun like as a

3310
08:03:23,479 --> 08:03:27,639
complete package it's a fun game but there's like an unbearable like string

3311
08:03:27,639 --> 08:03:44,299
of five to six hours in the game that are just like this game's stupid you

3312
08:03:44,299 --> 08:03:51,580
played farmers dynasty but you can't compare you call on you cannot compare

3313
08:03:51,580 --> 08:03:58,799
the farmers dynasty stream to if I'm going to actually sit down and play Star

3314
08:03:58,799 --> 08:04:04,319
Wars the fallen order game that's like there's two different things going on

3315
08:04:04,319 --> 08:04:13,020
there I'm not going when I opened up farmers dynasty we would you know that's

3316
08:04:13,020 --> 08:04:20,520
the same mindset going and playing Star Wars on hard you played this for eight

3317
08:04:20,520 --> 08:04:26,209
hours yeah but I'm not gonna play this tomorrow for eight hours if I play Star

3318
08:04:26,209 --> 08:04:30,169
Wars tomorrow for eight hours I'm gonna play Star Wars again for eight hours the

3319
08:04:30,169 --> 08:04:44,150
next day we'll be flipping cars here yes you will you promised a roof car so I

3320
08:04:44,150 --> 08:04:47,950
can't I can't play Star Wars tomorrow then because there's a I can't put a car

3321
08:04:47,990 --> 08:04:54,220
on a roof how am I gonna put a car on a roof in a sniper game he's no I'm not

3322
08:04:54,220 --> 08:05:00,380
gonna play this again let me get some more opinions on the Star Wars game and

3323
08:05:00,380 --> 08:05:04,830
then I'll just probably just in a plane the damn thing there's you know what I'm

3324
08:05:04,830 --> 08:05:07,909
probably gonna play Outer Worlds I'm gonna play Star Wars game the reason why

3325
08:05:07,909 --> 08:05:14,799
I'm gonna say all this is because we're about to hit that point after holiday you

3326
08:05:14,799 --> 08:05:19,040
know from November into December there's gonna be like two or three months

3327

straight with nothing releases so we'll get a bunch of good stuff now alright

3328
08:05:28,540 --> 08:05:30,540

3379
08:12:43,979 --> 08:12:48,970
right so and then secure Oh and then Mortal Kombat 11 is on here too but I

3380
08:12:48,970 --> 08:12:52,889
mean Mortal Kombat is a really really cool thing but I it's a fighting game

3381
08:12:52,889 --> 08:13:02,259
I'm not I don't really invest time into them but as of all these ones on this

3382
08:13:02,259 --> 08:13:06,909
list I played the good ones Resident Evil 2 that's a good one

3383
08:13:06,990 --> 08:13:14,549
Sekiro that's one of the good ones devil may cry five is the only one on this

3384
08:13:14,549 --> 08:13:17,869
list I think that I haven't played that is like one of those single-player

3385
08:13:17,869 --> 08:13:24,130
experiences put it on the list we'll do it the Witcher 3 came out like four

3386
08:13:24,130 --> 08:13:30,580
years ago smash ultimate I played smash ultimate but I didn't stream it

3387
08:13:30,580 --> 08:13:46,669
triple-a pronounced and sometimes written triple-a is an informal

3388
08:13:46,669 --> 08:13:49,790
classification used for video games produced and distributed by a mid-sized

3389
08:13:49,790 --> 08:14:04,069
or a major publisher informal informal now I'm not against playing triple-a

3390
08:14:04,069 --> 08:14:11,619
games but I just I need to be into them that's crackdown 3 is technically a

3391
08:14:11,619 --> 08:14:23,419
triple-a game and I'm not gonna play that I to be completely and totally fair

3392
08:14:23,419 --> 08:14:30,830
though Metro Exodus and devil may cry are the other two that I have not played

3393
08:14:30,830 --> 08:14:38,840
this year but the reason why I didn't play Metro Exodus is cuz I had a melt

3394
08:14:38,840 --> 08:14:44,020
down during last light I played it for like 30 minutes and I died like ten

3395
08:14:44,060 --> 08:14:47,340
times on my hardest difficulty and I like had a fucking meltdown and I quit

3396
08:14:47,340 --> 08:14:51,099
the game forever so like I can't I can't just skip that game because I can't go

3397
08:14:51,099 --> 08:14:57,849
back to that game I've tried I thought about it I did the Metro 2033 and it was

3398
08:14:57,849 --> 08:15:02,130
really good it was awesome and then I played last night I had a head of full

3399
08:15:02,130 --> 08:15:07,669
on like I can't do this meltdown I just couldn't do I could not play the game I

3400
08:15:07,669 --> 08:15:10,470
don't know why it was something's going on I've put the difficulty in the wrong

3401
08:15:10,470 --> 08:15:23,119
place and I've rage quit it what about salmon max that's not triple-a you do

3402
08:15:23,159 --> 08:15:30,049
that a lot I do not do that a lot when was the last time I've rage quit a game

3403
08:15:30,049 --> 08:15:36,130
in 30 minutes and never played it again it was last light that was the last time

3404
08:15:36,130 --> 08:15:43,720
I did that you know how I know that because I remember it every damn day Neo

3405
08:15:43,720 --> 08:15:50,790
yes that did happen with Neo 2 but that was both way before last light hotline

3406
08:15:50,790 --> 08:15:54,229
Miami I beat hotline Miami and hotline Miami 2 we talked about tougher like

3407
08:15:54,229 --> 08:15:58,029
right when was the last time I rate I rate yeah I've raged in hotline Miami 2

3408
08:15:58,029 --> 08:16:17,090
but I stuck with it and beat the game he checks out that I know I know I do

3409
08:16:17,090 --> 08:16:27,659
even played rage shadow legends I don't even know what that is hey so Sretto

3410
08:16:27,659 --> 08:16:32,340
thanks for the four dollars and 20 cents hello beauty hello beauty lady

3411
08:16:32,340 --> 08:16:41,869
remember the stream that would would have been funny we were talking to the

3412
08:16:41,869 --> 08:16:44,950
pre stream chat or I think it was maybe even the recommended on discord

3413
08:16:44,950 --> 08:16:50,819
somebody said just to open up my iPad open up a like the first YouTube video

3414
08:16:50,819 --> 08:16:53,900
like I just open up as many YouTube videos as I can try to get ads and

3415
08:16:53,900 --> 08:16:58,380
click on every ad for every mobile game that's an advertisement and play them

3416
08:16:58,380 --> 08:17:07,610
download every ad game just go find them just open up any gaming website and just

3417
08:17:07,610 --> 08:17:15,959
go click on every one of those ads and download those stupid banner ads but

3418
08:17:15,959 --> 08:17:19,200
then I thought it's probably a really bad idea that's like a really easy way

3419
08:17:19,200 --> 08:17:38,930
to get just like on like a never-ending sucker list do it on a VM get an Emmy

3420
08:17:38,970 --> 08:17:44,810
letter specifically for virus streams just emulate windows for like the

3421
08:17:44,810 --> 08:17:56,049
specific virus mobile ad games we'll see it was a funny idea is there an update

3422
08:17:56,049 --> 08:18:00,930
on the Sultan stream not yet the fuck the king server stuff is still being

3423
08:18:00,930 --> 08:18:05,250
worked on which actually I can talk about this just a little bit before we

3424
08:18:05,250 --> 08:18:11,029
go this is going to be and I've seen a lot of questions about this this is

3425
08:18:11,029 --> 08:18:15,650
going to be because it has to and I really wish there was another way but I

3426
08:18:15,650 --> 08:18:21,610
really don't think there is this has to be sub only not only does it have to be

3427
08:18:21,610 --> 08:18:26,669
sub only but it might have to be multiple month sub only to join this

3428
08:18:26,669 --> 08:18:35,500
server for a few different reasons the unfortunate truth of the game like

3429
08:18:35,500 --> 08:18:45,090
Minecraft is somebody could just open up a script and just go in the server and

3430
08:18:45,930 --> 08:18:52,939
I have to be I have to lock it down where there's probably gonna be a

3431
08:18:52,939 --> 08:19:00,659
whitelisting phase before like a week or two before the stream and I'm probably

3432
08:19:00,659 --> 08:19:07,819
gonna have to do not just a one month concurrent sub because then what think

3433
08:19:07,819 --> 08:19:12,540
about that scenario oh okay well it's sub only I can get in that server all

3434
08:19:12,540 --> 08:19:16,259
right let me just I'll just pay five dollars and then jump in and fucking

3435
08:19:16,259 --> 08:19:25,159
destroy everybody so it's gonna have to be locked down we I've been trying to

3436
08:19:25,159 --> 08:19:35,189
talk back and forth with people that are working on it but we don't have a final

3437
08:19:35,189 --> 08:19:41,900
a final game plan I guess yet but it's absolutely gonna be sub only and

3438
08:19:41,900 --> 08:19:54,970
multi-month probably so and hopefully we can get enough of you in there tier

3439
08:19:54,970 --> 08:20:03,180
three subs only I'm not doing that I think as long as it's you've been subbed

3440
08:20:03,180 --> 08:20:08,029
for a full month like you're on your second month that's probably enough

3441
08:20:08,189 --> 08:20:12,430
because that means that people can't just sub now and in like two or three

3442
08:20:12,430 --> 08:20:15,110
four weeks when this is probably not gonna be happening for at least a few

3443
08:20:15,110 --> 08:20:21,200
weeks but I just don't want somebody to be able to sub like right now and we'll

3444
08:20:21,200 --> 08:20:25,419
have to find out it might be three I don't know we're also trying to get in

3445
08:20:25,419 --> 08:20:31,750
touch with some people that like code in Minecraft and some anti-cheat people and

3446
08:20:31,750 --> 08:20:38,259
I want to make this really work so I'm trying to put in I'm trying to put my

3447
08:20:38,259 --> 08:20:44,779
thumb in all the holes that are in the wall that's why I have kind of just said

3448
08:20:44,779 --> 08:20:47,299
hey I'm thinking about doing it and I want to do it and it's gonna happen but

3449
08:20:47,299 --> 08:20:53,259
I'm not talking about it in the last few days but there's an update on that I

3450
08:20:53,259 --> 08:21:01,380
know I've seen a lot of questions about is that specifically we'll see but we

3451
08:21:01,380 --> 08:21:09,819
have a two more bits to do thank you Malto for the 500 bits hey I'm

3452
08:21:09,819 --> 08:21:16,849
struggling with the acne can you recommend me a good dermatologist
