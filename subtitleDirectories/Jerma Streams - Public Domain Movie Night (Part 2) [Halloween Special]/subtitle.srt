1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:15,429
Hey guys, what's up? How are you? We're here currently live, technically live.

2
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:26,059
I cannot guarantee that we're gonna be live for very long. We've had cocks at the house for the

3
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:37,159
last like six straight days and they may have figured out one of the issues. So it's just like

4
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:43,479
the first Red Dead stream, that's right. We'll see how long we can go. This is gonna be one of

5
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:50,380
those mystery boxes that you open. The stream might be two hours. It might be 10 minutes.

6
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:57,189
It might be six hours. I don't know. I can't some mystery. Just literally RNG the stream.

7
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:04,439
I know it already already already dead. No, no, we're okay. Are we? No. Hey, I'm here.

8
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:12,200
We just almost dropped though. That's probably gonna happen like every 15 minutes.

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:23,239
That's one minute. Oh shit. All right, when I press the button, it's probably, it's probably

10
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:33,189
gonna do that. So let's ride it out here for as long as we can. We'll do my, do my best to.

11
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:48,900
Oh, this is getting ugly. And before he moves back. No, there's no going back.

12
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:06,250
Damn, it was just green for so long too. It was just so solid green and now it just doesn't wanna,

13
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:13,699
it just doesn't wanna do it. Let's just, what's with the music? You might be hearing the PS4

14
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:25,770
sound effects. Let's see. It's there. Moved on from Comcast and got worse internet.

15
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:35,240
I have no idea. It's almost like a bad joke at this point because this is a gigabit line.

16
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:42,360
This is a, this is a thousand megabits per second down. This is what we get for down.

17
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,389
And they're, they just have some major, major issues that are apparently,

18
00:02:51,830 --> 00:03:01,990
take a lot of work to solve. So this is happening way more frequently than it just was.

19
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:16,199
Nice, already buffering, getting a buffering pop up already. Yeah. Well, we're, well, let,

20
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:24,620
let just, just hang out with me for a minute. We'll sit here for a moment because we do get

21
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:31,909
these spots of like a few hours where it's perfectly fine. I'm getting back in a balloon.

22
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:36,969
I'm going back to Boston. Let's see. What do I take this screen off? What if I do this?

23
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:49,639
Like you can see that, right? Cause that's, that's red dead right there. Come on. Just like,

24
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:59,289
just like feed me through to the line that I need to be on. So I cannot guarantee the authenticity

25
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:08,659
of this current stream. And I'm, I'm so afraid to press the story button. I'm going to press

26
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:15,849
X and it's going to crash the fucking node. What a social club. I think it's the rock star thing

27
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:29,800
when you get online, right? Press X. Should I? I'm so scared. I'm so scared that it's not going to

28
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:41,350
work. Oh shit. Here goes the node. I'm doing it. I don't care. I will fight through the frame drops

29
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:50,019
here. Cause you guys wouldn't even believe this is nothing. We would lose internet for 12 straight

30
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:59,639
hours. It would just be zero. All right. I'm going. Um, here we go. Wish me luck. Ready? One,

31
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:24,439
two. I did it. Okay. Okay. I'll turn it up a little bit. So this is, so this is red dead

32
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,120
redemption too, by the way, you weren't aware. This is a new Western game that came out.

33
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:42,389
I mean, is this supposed to be somebody talking here? Spoilers. Well, what are you doing at a red

34
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:54,810
dead two stream? If you're scared about spoilers. I lived in Vinnie's dryer for a week.

35
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:14,170
No, that's not out of the ordinary though. I pay rent and the age of outlaws and gunslingers was

36
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:21,579
at an end. I have to turn this up. It was like a volume control on this dumb thing.

37
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:38,779
There we go. Turn it up. It's got to do a cowboy accent. I've even the wish had mostly been tamed.

38
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:52,980
That was until they showed up. Bill Bob, Barry, Borg, a few gangs still remain, but they were

39
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,970
being hunted down and destroyed. I can't read cursive. I got taught cursive. I don't know how

40
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:07,800
to read it. There we go. That was a cursive. I would have been upset about that. Rockstar games

41
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:30,139
presents red dead two. Why does it look like horror movie text? Here we go. I'm so excited for this.

42
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,850
Give me my internet. I deserve. I deserve an internet.

43
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:53,930
That's a lot of bird shit. All right, stop. I want to make a joke about a million birds

44
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,430
shitting all over them, but I can't stop it. Don't stop soon. We'll all be dying.

45
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:05,290
Whether it's May, I'm just hoping the law got as lost as we did.

46
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:12,019
It's me, right?

47
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:49,450
10 FPS with gameplay. You might be referring to my internet. Chapter one.

48
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:57,080
Byron. I don't know what that says. I'm not gonna read the subtitles at the bottom. I'm gonna try

49
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:14,840
to read it. This game is like an hour long tutorial. Hey, just long enough to us to make

50
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:29,559
sure the internet will stay on. Hey, welcome to the stream. Oh my god. Ms. Gaskell, get that

51
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:48,330
fire. Thank you. Nothing more you could have done. What are we gonna do? We need supplies.

52
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,210
Well, first of all, you're gonna stay here and you were gonna get yourself worn.

53
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:01,210
And I sent John and Mike scouting out ahead. Thank you so much. See if we can find

54
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,090
wait for some time to deliver these bits to you. It's great to see you back in action,

55
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,850
especially after you had to once again deal with some internet issues still are.

56
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:17,850
Listen, still are at the moment. Listen to me for a moment. Now we've had a bad couple of days.

57
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:33,580
I loved Davy, Jenny, Sean, Mac. What's his last name? John barf bag. We don't know. Something like

58
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:43,639
that. But we lost some folks. Now, if I could throw myself in the ground, in their stead,

59
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:53,159
I'd do it gladly. Quit Comcast? I don't have Comcast. I have a different ISP across the country.

60
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:02,940
And it still follows me. Everybody. We're safe. Now, there ain't nobody following us

61
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:09,419
to a storm like this one. By the time they get here. Well, we're gonna be we're gonna be long

62
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:15,750
gone. We've been through worse than this. John McFar's stun. That was the guy. Mr. Pearson,

63
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:22,870
Miss Grimshaw, I need you to turn this place into a camp. You may be here for a few days.

64
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:34,179
Now all of you, all of you get yourselves worn. Stay strong. It might be the modem router. Oh,

65
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:40,980
no, no, no. Single option is big. So they both must have headed down the hill.

66
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:58,740
Oh, are we like dead dead now? Oh, boy. What really went down back there on that boat?

67
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:09,350
We missed you. That's what happened. Come on. Hey, you need horses? Oh, yeah. Hey, Mr. Smith,

68
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:15,509
get yourself indoors. I know I can see it over here. Get indoors, son.

69
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,230
All right, I get to play the game, though. Need you strong. Okay, it's deep snow.

70
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:36,149
Ain't sure what we're gonna find out here, duds. We have to try. Stay close. We'll do our best to

71
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:41,990
stick to the trail. This goddamn weather. It's been two days or more like this now.

72
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:51,419
Yeah, I didn't think it was. There's Jabba Dab's $250 coming in. Again, thank you so much, man. I

73
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:57,590
know I'm like trying to bounce and monitor my connection and play a game and thank you so

74
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:09,019
fucking much, dude. It's a huge amount of money. It's coming up. Take it easy. Big delayed money.

75
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:19,990
Yeah, I don't know why that's happening. I don't know what it is with Rockstar and not putting

76
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:26,549
their flagship video games on PC. The first Red Dead's not even on. Red Dead Redemption's not on

77
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,830
PC at all. For some strange reason.

78
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,629
They're going northeast at the moment. Sick.

79
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:56,389
I'm sorry. All I heard was crouch in the corner and throw rocks at people. Is that what you wanted

80
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:06,629
me to do with my like Dalmatian horse? Oh, that's snow, right? I thought it was like a giant

81
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:18,460
Dalmatian. Is that someone coming towards us? Someone coming towards us. Are they friendly?

82
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:30,409
Ooh, cutscene. Bring it on. Guy on the left's gonna get picked off with an arrow.

83
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:41,299
Micah. Gentlemen. The audio's delayed. I think so. Found a little homestead down that

84
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:50,149
away. Okay. Anyone home? Sure. Place is blazing with light and noise. Sounded like a party. Let's go

85
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:57,269
see. Follow me. Is anyone is? How's Davey doing? Yeah, this is uh. Nor did little Jenny. Six B's.

86
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:02,870
Bob's Barry. Bunsen. Bugle.

87
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:28,870
John? He's talking about our John? My John? First game John?

88
00:15:47,960 --> 00:16:00,200
How is it to hold? It just disappeared. Talk to Mike. Are you sure about this? Let's do that.

89
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,559
Mr. Morgan. I never thought I would be so pleased to see your face.

90
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:12,600
Things always turn out fine. Except for in Red Dead Redemption. Where's everyone else?

91
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:20,919
Old mining camp back up the hill. Hung for daddy to put food on the table. Gotta love these graphics

92
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:34,200
though. Snow actually permeates. I keep saying people tell me to keep looking at the balls.

93
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,200
No. I wouldn't do that in real life. Why would I do it in a video game?

94
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:47,720
If I was in this time period I wouldn't like go underneath the carriage like it was an oil change.

95
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:50,519
Like lift up the tail and look at the ball sack. What are you talking about?

96
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:56,009
You know me. I'm a good boy. You look under your car and look for your car's balls?

97
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:59,929
What would be the car balls? I'm trying to think what it would be.

98
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:08,019
The cars? The car balls would be like the muffler right? Okay. Let's keep it down now

99
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:33,059
gentlemen. It's just up ahead. Exhaust. Turn it down. Let's head down there. I can't fall off this

100
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:39,609
can I? Health is displayed in the lower left corner. That tiny little thing is health.

101
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:48,970
That's so small. How am I supposed to see that? Wait is this like Super Mario where there's like

102
00:17:48,970 --> 00:18:00,039
three quadrants? Let's hitch up here. The outer bar shows you. All right but that was like about

103
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:09,779
an outer bar and an inner bar. Approach the hitching post. Let's get it on here. Triangle

104
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:20,220
hitches the horse. Now we got our first set of action here I think. Follow Dutch. I remember

105
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:51,579
Dutch. This is a lot of snow. Why does this have to follow me everywhere I go? I don't understand.

106
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,579
Go to the shed and press R1 to take cover. There's this shed over here.

107
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,650
Glad it took three weeks. Blame, blame Cox Communications.

108
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:15,579
Because these motherfuckers can't figure it out either. And it's their service. This is the shed

109
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:36,819
right? It's no. Oh the cattle shed. Like in this thing. This is not the cattle shed. Get up there.

110
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:43,720
Do I just take my glasses off? How do I get out of here? I'm sorry I haven't been paying attention.

111
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:58,759
Get in position. What cattle shed is he referring to? In here. Is this not the shed?

112
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:12,539
Stuck because no blip. No stuck because I have to look over here and watch five percent of every

113
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:19,819
frame drop. Because it's taken this company three weeks to try to fix a problem. Oh my fucking god

114
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:33,819
it's infuriating. Go back. Go to the shed. Is it the shed that's like straight in front of me here?

115
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:43,779
That looked like a cattle shed to me. The huge yellow thing. That's

116
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:49,910
isn't that where it just was? Like isn't this this is where I was. Isn't this where I was?

117
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:54,390
Highlighted in yellow. This thing here. Isn't this where it just was?

118
00:20:55,829 --> 00:21:10,279
I just did this. Didn't I just do this? Excuse me. Hello. I didn't hide. Hello friend. What you want?

119
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:19,670
Very sorry to disturb you. My friends and I. Well we got in some trouble up the way. Lost in the

120
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:30,940
storm. Gentlemen. We can't help you mister. What's he gonna do? I got folks. Arthur we got a problem.

121
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:46,519
Protect Dutch. Okay. Is this guy gonna fire at him? I think you should go now.

122
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:22,500
I just like holy shit this is aiming is a little weird. What's with the aiming? It's like why is

123
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:47,990
it pulling me? I gotta change the sensitivity here. Great soundtrack. Yeah. All right. Where's it this

124
00:22:47,990 --> 00:23:07,240
way? He's not gonna last by himself out there. Now he won't last at all. You didn't handle it. I had

125
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:31,289
to do something about it. I'm gonna follow him. Fucking internet companies man. Hold screen your

126
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:36,009
items. Pick them up while searching the house. We need the essentials. Food. Okay. Medicine.

127
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:52,809
Whiskey. They're gonna open pots and shit. It's cabinets. Hold near items. Pick them up while

128
00:23:52,809 --> 00:24:00,009
searching. Canned sweet corn. There's a big price on Cuomo Drisco's head. Assorted biscuits.

129
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:11,430
Fruits. Whiskey is not essential. Are you serious? Your health core drains over time and is now

130
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:21,819
empty while empty you will experience negative effects. Do you have to eat in this game? Okay.

131
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:30,549
Slowly restores health core and moderately restores stamina core. Interesting. And then

132
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:38,019
we have to go bake beans so that I get a middle is your core. Slightly reduce restores health core.

133
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:48,250
All right. Let's just do this in the middle one first. Let's just try it out. Survival mode it

134
00:24:48,329 --> 00:25:05,029
seems like. Better quality food will refill more core. Okay. I gotta like refill my four cores.

135
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:23,829
Let's look around for some more stuff. Just controls how fast you refill your health and stamina.

136
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:34,730
It's better than nothing. There's a lot of random shit on the mantle. Examine the

137
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:42,619
photograph. Sure. Let's get some lore. Poor bastard was married to. Okay. Flip it around.

138
00:25:43,180 --> 00:26:01,779
Secret code on the back. Quake and ID wedding. Jet. I can't read it. Oh, there we go. Okay.

139
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:14,660
I'm just kidding. Oh look it's from the first game. That's the cottage from the first game.

140
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:28,740
All right. What's we got? $2.43. Have we dropped a frame in the last like 15 minutes? Can anybody

141
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:41,349
tell? Or do I have to like do I have to like scream as loud as I can? I have. God damn it.

142
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:50,700
Well I say it now and now I just did right here. I think that's all I can get.

143
00:26:54,250 --> 00:27:01,059
Keep looking for stuff. Arthur go see if there's anything in that barn. Okay. Micah

144
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:08,680
you search the cabin. See what we missed. Sure. All right. Let's go investigate the barn.

145
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:15,240
I'm gonna go take a look and I'm gonna go examine it. No drop frames since the fight.

146
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,660
Now you can look at the current objective. What's that? Is that a bad guy? Good guy?

147
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:35,000
Another thing there. The atmosphere is great. Yeah. So far it looks awesome. That guy just

148
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:54,630
top rope shot. Hey what's happening in here? That guy didn't get one hit in. Should you kill him?

149
00:27:55,269 --> 00:28:04,309
Not yet. Interrogate. Find out what they're doing. All right. Beat him. Oh that son of a

150
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:11,420
bitch would talk. This is just like the Punisher game. Where is he? Where is he?

151
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:28,539
Okay. What are you? Anything else? Why are you up here? Fiction to rob some train.

152
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:34,680
Gonna blow the tracks. No I don't know more. I swear. Thanks for the info buddy.

153
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:43,000
But say it looks like you have this Arthur. Anything else? What was the last time you shat

154
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:52,359
your pants? When you're done. Joven. When did it happen? When? When was the last time you shat

155
00:28:52,359 --> 00:29:15,240
your pants? Let's try to grab him again. He's like come here I'm not done with you. Oh there

156
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:28,140
animals over here? What the fuck? What's happening? Wait what? I have to restart the whole thing?

157
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:44,140
Oh shit. Wasted. By walking out of the frame. Oh god damn it. Well all right.

158
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:54,089
Tell us. Tell us again. First passing hug. I can't keep up.

159
00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:07,160
Wasted here. Near the light. What are you bastards? His clothes changed? Why? Fiction to rob some

160
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:13,940
train. Gonna blow the tracks. No I don't know the net. I swear. That's his worst mission boundaries

161
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,460
than in GTA 5. Well I would say it looks like you have this Arthur. Do what you want with him.

162
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,539
All right so now we get a second chance. Should I spare him? Remember saving Private Ryan.

163
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,769
This motherfucker's gonna come back. I don't want to do that. I don't. But what if he comes back?

164
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:57,509
Where's my gun? Focus on the horse. Where are you? In the barn? How'd you get in here?

165
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,539
How did you get in here? Well I can calm the horse. This is not my horse.

166
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:21,140
What if this is gonna freak out and start hitting me? This looks animatronic. I don't know if I

167
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:28,839
trust it. It's animatronic. Don't ever stand behind a horse. That's what I was told.

168
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:44,250
Check his balls. No. All right let's lead the horse. Continuing to bomb with your horse increases

169
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:56,759
its trust in you and improves its attributes. The horse has now become your horse as indicated by a

170
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:04,700
blip on the radar. Okay. Yeah figured he won't get far. We still fucking dropped. Yeah.

171
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:19,240
God damn it. This is like I'm like really containing myself right now. I'm like I am

172
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,940
like a I'm holding back but this has been like an infuriating process.

173
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:44,779
Hmm. Literally moved across the country to a different fucking state. Got a faster line

174
00:32:46,630 --> 00:33:02,740
and it's worse than it was before. That's unbelievable. With a different company. A gigabit

175
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:14,759
connection. Thousand fucking megabits a second. Eventually it's gonna get fixed but who fucking

176
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:27,500
knows when. Maybe you're the problem. I don't think so. I haven't had enough time to be the

177
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:46,869
problem. Turned on the modem. Got an IP. That's it. Oh what the fuck? Get off me.

178
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:49,990
Hold on. Come in here boy. Let's go.

179
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:58,140
I didn't hit the wall.

180
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,420
Just keep going west until you get there.

181
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:53,579
I mean that fire wasn't bad. You could just jump on that thing and roll around and it would have

182
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:54,539
gone off.

183
00:34:55,099 --> 00:35:05,860
Of course it's okay. We're bad men. We ain't them. It's okay.

184
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:14,789
Get on. We'll keep you safe until you figure out what you want to do. What's your name miss?

185
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:22,940
Miss. Adler. Adler. What is it that you're used to calling an easy during a blizzard?

186
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:30,119
He he was my husband.

187
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:59,989
Hey somebody's coming. Looks like it's Dutch. Hey everybody Dutch is back. We good. How'd you get

188
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:08,309
on? Micah found a homestead but he weren't the first. Colm or Driscoll and his scum they beat

189
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:18,659
us to it. We found some of them there but there is more about apparently scouting the train.

190
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:26,579
Thank you. This is not on PC unfortunately. Well it is what it is but we found some supplies some

191
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:33,860
blankets a little bit of food and this poor soul Mrs. Adler Miss Tilly Miss Karen would you warm

192
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:42,659
her up give her a drink or something and Mrs. Adler it's gonna be okay you're safe now they

193
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,739
turned her into a widow. He might never be on PC but the last one wasn't either. That's like

194
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:52,659
the unfortunate thing. I need some rest. I haven't slept in three days. You're over here. Miss O'Shea

195
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:58,820
I'll show you the way. Mr. Morgan we put you in a room over here. Thank you Miss Grimshaw.

196
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:04,659
Mr. Bell here with the fellas over there. Well how come Arthur gets a room and I get a bunk bed

197
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:17,880
next to Bill Williamson and a bunch of darkies. Get yourself to bed. Rocks are a bunch of idiots

198
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:25,820
for not putting it on PC. Yeah I don't know there's got to be some reason why. It does not but I

199
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:36,679
really wonder. He ain't been seen in days. The weather ain't let up. He's strong and he's smart.

200
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:50,090
Strong at least. Hello Arthur. Abigail. Arthur how you doing? Just fine Abigail and you? I need

201
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:57,050
you to I'm sorry I'm sorry to ask but. It's little John. He's got himself caught into a scrape again.

202
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:06,409
He ain't been seen in two hours. Two days. Your John will be fine. I mean he may be as dumb as rocks

203
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:12,409
and as dull as rusted iron but that ain't changing because he got caught in some snowstorm. Please go

204
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:20,809
take a look. Javier? Yes. Javier will you ride out with Arthur to take a look for John? You're the two

205
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:31,849
best fit men we've got. Now? We're all pretty worried about him. I know the situation were

206
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:47,400
reversed and he looked for me. Thank you. British accent? This way. Last I know John was headed up

207
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:58,019
the river. We know he kept riding north. Not like that. That emote is making my chat scroll

208
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:06,250
horizontally. Wait what? Wait what? Wait hold on. What are you talking about?

209
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:15,690
It's time to find John. Alright I need to like get happy. I'm like sad right now because of this

210
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:21,050
internet bullshit. I gotta get like excited. This is Red Dead Redemption 2. This is not like

211
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:30,679
another iPad game. Hey I see some smoke. Come on let's take a look. Let's hope it ain't more of

212
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:43,559
O'Driscoll's boys. Seems somebody left recently. Let's do some investigating reporting here.

213
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,170
Did he do it? Did he do it? Did he do it? Did he do it? Are we not going to like it anyways? What?

214
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:57,210
What? I loved the first one. The first one was great. Let's inspect the camp.

215
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:03,340
But what? There could be dust. There could be fingerprints or finger dust on here.

216
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:14,840
Fine. Alright fine fine fine. I wanted to fucking dust for fingerprints and he didn't want to do

217
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:24,250
shit. Watch out watch out. Hot hot hot hot. Ow burning burning. Burn. Burn my horse's legs.

218
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:37,769
Stamina drains when your horse gallops or jumps. I can't see anything.

219
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:42,250
We had the money. It seemed fine. Somebody turn the antennas around.

220
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:50,329
Bounty hunters? No Pinkerton. It was crazy. Raining bullets. That lake was steaming.

221
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:56,179
Well this is a beautiful mountain though. Watch out for this crevice.

222
00:40:57,219 --> 00:41:09,530
To change camera distance and perspective press. It wouldn't even let me do the YouTuber joke. Come

223
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:21,500
on. Why? Come on. Oh what? Sorry. I got off track. Let me just look. Whoa!

224
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:47,019
The horse wouldn't do it. But you get off and you can do it. The horse is smarter.

225
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:53,260
See they continue up that way. That fall was so stupid too. It was like he lost control of all

226
00:41:53,260 --> 00:42:01,500
of his body and function. And that like ahhhh. It was like Emperor Palpatine. He was thrown into

227
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:06,300
the thing in the end of the fourth movie. He just did the Emperor Palpatine scream.

228
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:15,670
We had the money. It seemed fine. Then suddenly they were everywhere. Hunters? No Pinkerton.

229
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:26,119
It was crazy. All right so I got the stamina bar. Take it slow. The horse bar has the horseshoe.

230
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:37,400
Okay so that's distance. That's what I want. Fps boat. Bad way. But it was a bad situation.

231
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:55,699
That ain't like him though. Okay not gonna do it. There's some tracks leading to the river.

232
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:09,880
It's not funny. I'm sorry. It's not funny. Wait that was a bear? What are you talking about a bear?

233
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:15,400
That was I was trying to turn around because I was making the fake.

234
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:24,840
It's not funny. It is funny. It is funny. Whatever. It was a bear? I don't think it was a bear.

235
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:29,159
We had the money. It seemed fine. Was it a bear?

236
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:39,219
Pinkerton. It was crazy. No bullets. It's not funny. Please stop. I'm sorry.

237
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:49,880
Take it slow. Big ravine here. Get me. I'm not going over there. Dutch killed a girl. My side.

238
00:43:50,519 --> 00:44:02,230
Bad way. But it was a bad situation. That ain't like him though. Tracks go left. Down here.

239
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:13,829
Baby got shot. I'm not doing it one more time. Both shot too. Sean we don't even know. I'm

240
00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:17,909
surprised we escaped at all. By the time you boys showed up from the other side of town.

241
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:28,219
Only just holding on to that business all right. Activate cinematic camera. Hold this button down.

242
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:32,860
Damn snow's coming in hard again. We'll lose these tracks if we don't move fast.

243
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:37,739
Automatically follow roads. Oh that's so you can. It's like watching an actual movie.

244
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:48,579
Nice. Change cinematic camera press R3. All right that there's a lot of there's a lot of use cases

245
00:44:48,579 --> 00:45:08,860
for this I think. But am I still controlling the character? Oh shit yeah I am. That's hard to do.

246
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:17,340
All right I'm gonna play the whole game like this. I'm gonna be the first streamer on Twitch.

247
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:34,139
The first guy on Twitch to do it only in cinematic mode. Looks like you know when you

248
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:49,510
were 14 and you made that machinima. That's what I'm doing right now. I'm not gonna turn it off.

249
00:45:50,230 --> 00:46:05,539
Why would I turn this off? Oh wow let's investigate. He was riding this horse.

250
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:29,099
Hell. Where? Up here. I heard it from this way. Is this the right way? Am I going the

251
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:50,090
right way? I gotta get it out of my system now. Oh shit. Okay don't. Okay no no no no. Just relax.

252
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,969
I'm not gonna fucking do it again. I'm sorry.

253
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:12,900
I have like the cinematic mode. I'm trying. I can't do it yet. Let's give me the prompt.

254
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:22,739
The first five minutes of the game. I'm having fun though. I'm actually gonna try to play the

255
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:26,820
whole game in cinematic mode. That'll be my schnick right? Like what the fuck?

256
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,500
Livestreamer plays entire Red Dead 2 in cinematic camera?

257
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:47,429
Okay here we go. No I'm not I'm not gonna jump. I'm not falling off another edge.

258
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:59,829
That is a 100% guarantee. Like I can 100% guarantee. If I fall off the edge in the

259
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:04,630
next like minute or two in this like little tutorial I will do 100 push-ups in a row on camera.

260
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:13,670
All right here we go.

261
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:17,190
I'm coming in hard again. We'll lose these tracks if we don't move fast.

262
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:37,900
Oh good. Take the germ attacks 30%. It adds the bars too that's important. I'm not gonna fall.

263
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:50,219
I'm doing the thing that's impossible. You cannot fall like this. It's not possible. I'm holding X.

264
00:48:50,780 --> 00:49:08,820
Watch yourself. I'm tensed up right now like you wouldn't believe. Yeah a lot of fresh snow here.

265
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:17,980
I like this one. How am I gonna aim and shoot at people with cinematic camera? Is that possible?

266
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:35,400
So close to the edge yeah. She has to guess. You can't I can't just guess.

267
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:45,219
This is beautiful though. Let's get a different angle here. Let's see if he can hear us.

268
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:59,019
So John is here somewhere. All right I'm gonna follow him. Up there. Don't say up there.

269
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:13,579
Okay I'm gonna follow you. Don't push me off. All right here we go. Is it do I go over this?

270
00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:31,940
All right we're good. We have to walk from here. Oh no. Oh no. Grab shotgun. Force weapons.

271
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:40,889
Okay so R1. Okay we can only heal one sidearm. So I'm gonna get the shotgun.

272
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:57,980
So did I lose cinematic? There we go. It's back. Wait hold on. Okay. Oh it turns off right when you

273
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:16,920
hold the button down. You can't do it. But wait is this an edge? Okay we're good. It's on. It's on.

274
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:29,619
It's coming from this way. Hey watch out here. I'm not cheating. I want to see from another angle.

275
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:34,260
I don't want to see. Holy fuck. I just that doesn't count. I fell off a ledge onto another ledge. I

276
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:46,730
didn't die. This damage is played in the lower left corner. I don't have it. Watch yourself.

277
00:51:46,730 --> 00:52:03,059
Okay this doesn't count either because this is okay. Be careful here. Oh god damn it. Okay back

278
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:15,829
there. Watch your head. Yeah I'm all right. This is the most stressful thing I've done in a long time.

279
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:25,750
Am I running the lip? Watch your step. This is real slippery. Stay close to the wall. My stamina

280
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:39,699
core is empty. Square in this climb. Get access to the shaft. I need to eat something man.

281
00:52:40,579 --> 00:52:52,119
That's what I need. Some stamina here. Classic oat cakes. Is there just a stamina one?

282
00:52:52,760 --> 00:53:21,909
Just canned peaches is fine. That looks odd from cinematic view. All right we're doing fine.

283
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:33,349
Just eating peaches. Canned peaches are where it's at man. That's good shit.

284
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:52,679
John. John. John we'll be looking for you. John the street lights are on. You're in deep shit

285
00:53:52,679 --> 00:54:13,289
when you get home. Where is he? He's in the game. He's in the game. Where is he? That's quite a

286
00:54:13,289 --> 00:54:21,820
scratch you got there. Never thought I'd say this but good to see you Arthur Morgan. So he is in

287
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:31,750
the game. Wow. I don't look so good. I don't feel too good neither. I could probably do that if I

288
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:47,559
tried hard enough. Now we gotta we gotta cinematically walk him back to his car.

289
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,480
Oh we actually do.

290
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:06,900
I think I think this is just supposed to happen right?

291
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,739
If we go on the right is this supposed to be okay?

292
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:34,710
Uh-oh. Wildlife. We're being hunted by wolves. I'll distract him while you get to the horses.

293
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,550
Who's gonna distract him? All right yeah to get to the horses.

294
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:47,179
Keep the wolves away from both of them. Let's get you on that horse. That's just not gonna work.

295
00:55:47,900 --> 00:56:10,219
Let's get away from it. No it takes it off cinematic mode. Oh well we tried.

296
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:24,780
Okay let's get going before any more of these bastards show up. Get him on the horse. You can

297
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:33,300
see you're gonna drive him? Okay do first person mode. That's actually a good idea too.

298
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:51,530
Okay where is he? Oh shit. All right yeehaw. We're gonna get a yeehaw.

299
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:12,420
Please don't commit to this. I'm not committing to it. This is not very cinematic.

300
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:43,219
Okay.

301
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,719
He just buried his face in the ground. Just slid.

302
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:57,719
Is this the portal soundtrack?

303
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:01,079
I don't think so.

304
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:10,119
It's really crazy that John Marsden's in this game and he just becomes Darth Vader in the next one.

305
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:13,079
You can see his origin story here. That's really cool.

306
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,559
Damn they're getting even the death ain't good enough for you.

307
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,579
We're good. I did it. I made it.

308
00:58:52,920 --> 00:59:06,679
Super voice. Can I scream too? Does it help?

309
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:19,139
We got some help. We need some help. Come on help him down. Help. Here we go. One two three.

310
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:28,579
Come on let's get you warm. Thank you. Thank you both. This is a new love even by your standards.

311
00:59:29,539 --> 00:59:35,699
Thank you Arthur. Thank you. Any other lost maidens need saving? Not today.

312
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,460
Have you and Dutch talked about how we're gonna get out of this?

313
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:46,500
I was just discussing with Herr Strauss when the weather breaks. I suppose we'll have to keep heading east. East into all that.

314
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,300
That civilization. I know.

315
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:56,500
The west is where our problems are worse. The west. Come on Herr Strauss. Let's get warm. Thank you, Mr. Morgan.

316
00:59:58,019 --> 01:00:01,099
You never seen this game before? Is it on the Sega Genesis?

317
01:00:08,949 --> 01:00:14,869
We've been running for weeks. We found shelter and been resting here.

318
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:19,639
I was just gonna scream yes, but I'm not a screamer.

319
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:33,590
Events and interesting locations are noted in your journal as you explore. Hold w to view. Hold x for details.

320
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:43,019
Log. Enter pursuit by memory. John hasn't returned from an earlier scouting trip. Arthur and

321
01:00:43,579 --> 01:00:45,980
Javier ride out into the snow to look for him.

322
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,500
Okay.

323
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:52,260
Checklist. Kill all the wolves without taking any damage. Complete with the least 80. Didn't do either of those.

324
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,280
That's all right. Let's take a look at this.

325
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,880
Here's the journal.

326
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,860
I guess.

327
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,860
That's very bad drawing.

328
01:01:03,739 --> 01:01:05,739
You know when like somebody asks you for directions

329
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:08,619
and you draw them a terrible map of intersections?

330
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:11,739
What's it just looks like?

331
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,869
Uh, okay. So, uh, and

332
01:01:20,949 --> 01:01:22,949
Can I just draw in here too?

333
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:33,000
What is this book? Why would I not use this piece of paper on the left? It's a waste of trees.

334
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,679
Is it the white house?

335
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:40,650
We're safe. Stay strong.

336
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:44,789
Oh, okay. Blacksmithing.

337
01:01:47,179 --> 01:01:48,940
I can't read this.

338
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:54,119
Oh, thank god it can be translated.

339
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:03,829
That's kind of cool.

340
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:05,829
Continue playing to unlock your bonus content.

341
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:10,969
Oh, I'm one of the suckers that spent 80 dollars to get like the one mission that nobody else gets.

342
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:15,670
I feel real great about that purchase, by the way.

343
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:32,570
All right, let's just go. Let's just do some shit. We got our mini map here.

344
01:02:33,369 --> 01:02:42,550
Got a horse. Yeah.

345
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:48,570
Hold L2 to talk.

346
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:51,449
33 year old substitute teacher can't read cursing.

347
01:03:01,769 --> 01:03:08,489
Let's go.

348
01:03:08,489 --> 01:03:10,489
I haven't been a substitute teacher in a long time.

349
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
All right. All right, let's talk. L2, greet.

350
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:28,900
Another cold morning.

351
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,530
What? What is it doing? Wait, why?

352
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:37,940
Why did it make me get off for it to go to the bathroom? Get over here.

353
01:03:38,659 --> 01:03:40,659
What are you doing? Hey!

354
01:03:41,539 --> 01:03:44,820
Come here. Come back here. What are you going?

355
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,860
All right, relax.

356
01:03:55,369 --> 01:04:00,550
Shit and run.

357
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,550
I guess we can do B or P.

358
01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:13,210
Let's just do wits right here. Let's just do P.

359
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:21,210
B or P.

360
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:49,690
I don't feel like being laughed at by the likes of you two. Stop it now.

361
01:04:50,409 --> 01:04:55,449
You fools punching each other when Como Driscoll's needing punching hard.

362
01:04:55,449 --> 01:04:57,849
You want to sit around waiting for him to come find us?

363
01:04:58,409 --> 01:05:01,530
All of you, we got work to do. All right, I have the team mission.

364
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,530
Are you sure about this, Dutch? Yes.

365
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:06,730
Pope's been through a lot recently. We hardly back on our feet yet.

366
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:10,409
And the last thing we need is to get Bushwhacked by Como Driscoll.

367
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:11,449
Let's go.

368
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:14,809
I know you hate him, Dutch. He's here for us.

369
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:15,849
I doubt that.

370
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:19,610
No, you're just doubting me. I would never doubt you, Dutch.

371
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:24,650
You always said revenge is a luxury we can't afford.

372
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:27,849
This is a right call, Arthur. Take this.

373
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:29,849
Why does he just sound like a pitch-shifted version of him?

374
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:37,420
They were talking about trains, detonators.

375
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:42,699
Here, Combe always had good information. Come on.

376
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:46,860
And you think now is the right time to hit a train?

377
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:53,340
Now you, my fancy living on deer piss and rabbit shit, I'm getting too old for that life.

378
01:05:54,059 --> 01:06:00,059
Mr. Matthews, Mr. Smith, Mr. Pearson, would you please look after the place?

379
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:01,980
There are old Driscolls about.

380
01:06:02,619 --> 01:06:05,340
Voice crack, voice crack. Everyone laugh at him, right?

381
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,219
You laugh at me.

382
01:06:08,219 --> 01:06:09,900
And that guy's way stronger than all of you.

383
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,170
Southwest, right, Arthur?

384
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:15,059
You should follow the main trail southwest.

385
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:17,139
Right, point it out. Everybody point it out in the chat, right?

386
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,460
Let's go find these bastards.

387
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:25,849
All right, so we're gonna go. This is a robbery.

388
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:27,690
Cinematic mode, automatic. I didn't even.

389
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,130
Automatic cinematic. I didn't even do it.

390
01:06:29,849 --> 01:06:33,860
Somebody turn on the AC. It's getting hot in here.

391
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:34,820
Automatic cinematic.

392
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:39,900
I'll scold myself for that one later in the shower, I promise.

393
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:48,969
I'm sorry. I've been away for like three weeks.

394
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:55,380
I'm gonna be in the shower being like with my hand up,

395
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,099
wicked hot water just going like, fucking stupid.

396
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:01,239
Don't ever say something like that again.

397
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:06,920
It must be this way.

398
01:07:09,769 --> 01:07:11,130
You good, Dutch?

399
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:18,440
Listen, I know you don't think much of my eyes recently, but this is the right move.

400
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,269
Okay.

401
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:19,750
Debatable.

402
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:21,449
You know I'm gonna be back.

403
01:07:21,449 --> 01:07:22,489
Stream the shower.

404
01:07:22,489 --> 01:07:27,219
You learned a long time ago that you hit Como Driscolls.

405
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:28,420
No drop frames, by the way.

406
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,940
I get to get out of meltdown mode.

407
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,460
I'm in the fun, fun mode.

408
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:55,670
Just give it 10 minutes for me to pull off on another like audibly upset.

409
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:59,030
You know like the difference when somebody's like, oh, I'm pissed off.

410
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:00,070
What the heck, man?

411
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:02,230
Whoa, I can't believe I died there.

412
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,030
What's happening here?

413
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:03,909
Oh, damn it.

414
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:07,989
First, when you start talking like this, like this fucking stupid fucking thing,

415
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:09,909
like when you, that's how you know somebody's really angry.

416
01:08:09,909 --> 01:08:12,230
And they start like, they get like kind of internally,

417
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:13,510
they're so hot and they're nervous and shit.

418
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,869
Like they start fucking getting angry like that.

419
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:16,710
It's not like, what the fuck?

420
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:18,229
Whoa, I died in the game.

421
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:19,189
Oh, I'm so mad.

422
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:32,890
Whoa.

423
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:33,850
Are we birds?

424
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:34,649
All right, gentlemen.

425
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,920
This is it.

426
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:41,670
We goddamn ready.

427
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:42,789
Ready, Dutch.

428
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:43,510
Good.

429
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:44,550
That was very, very good.

430
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:45,989
That was like a classroom attendance.

431
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:48,859
This morning, we're gonna head up here a little.

432
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:51,180
See if we can't get a sense of the layout of the camp.

433
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:57,260
Mr. Williamson, Mr. Bell, you two take up a hidden position just outside the camp.

434
01:08:57,979 --> 01:09:03,020
Mr. Summers, Mr. Escuela, you two hold position here.

435
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:05,310
Let's go.

436
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:10,170
All right.

437
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:14,810
All right.

438
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:15,609
Throw haymaker.

439
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:17,500
I'm depleting.

440
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:23,960
This is absolutely beautiful.

441
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,079
You know, this is beautiful.

442
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:33,800
It's just beautiful out here.

443
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,000
That was at the same time.

444
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,220
Here they are.

445
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:40,340
That's definitely them.

446
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:42,500
Holy shit, this is what it looks like to look through his eyes.

447
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,140
I think so.

448
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:44,260
Gotta go to a doctor, man.

449
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:45,140
Yeah, that's it.

450
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:46,020
You didn't do prescription.

451
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:51,590
You got astigmatism, bro.

452
01:09:56,569 --> 01:09:58,090
All right, headshot from all the way back here.

453
01:09:58,729 --> 01:10:08,680
What was wrong with that one?

454
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,130
Who's he talking to?

455
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:13,609
He don't seem very happy.

456
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:21,430
They leaving?

457
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,310
Seem to be.

458
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:23,430
Should we go get them?

459
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:23,930
No.

460
01:10:24,949 --> 01:10:25,829
Cole can wait.

461
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,470
Best to get some of them out of there.

462
01:10:29,029 --> 01:10:30,619
All right, so we're gonna sneak up.

463
01:10:31,579 --> 01:10:33,979
Metal Gear Solid 3 Neck Snap.

464
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:34,479
Two of them.

465
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:40,869
I was hoping I could see his big eyes.

466
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:42,949
Like Macaulay Culkin style.

467
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,420
Weapons not set on your load before dismounting will remain on your horse.

468
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,779
Pick them off from up there.

469
01:10:58,779 --> 01:10:59,739
You got it, Dutch.

470
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:04,100
All right, so we got...

471
01:11:07,289 --> 01:11:10,149
Approach your horse to view store.

472
01:11:10,149 --> 01:11:11,109
Hold L...

473
01:11:11,109 --> 01:11:11,609
Do it.

474
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:15,340
Okay, so where's the rifle?

475
01:11:15,899 --> 01:11:17,850
Right here.

476
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:22,329
Long arm back carbine or carbine repeater.

477
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:26,060
Oh, that's just the slot it's in.

478
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:27,180
Okay, I get it.

479
01:11:27,819 --> 01:11:29,500
And I'll take the shotgun too.

480
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,000
What?

481
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:35,899
Horse weapons.

482
01:11:35,899 --> 01:11:40,029
We'll circle around the far side and go down that way.

483
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:40,989
Same as Micah and Bill.

484
01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:41,470
Change sense.

485
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:41,869
Yeah, that's...

486
01:11:41,869 --> 01:11:42,430
I probably should.

487
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:43,789
Like you said, revenge.

488
01:11:43,789 --> 01:11:44,670
I'll get it right eventually.

489
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,029
We can't afford.

490
01:11:46,029 --> 01:11:49,390
Yeah, just wasn't sure you agreed with me.

491
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:49,710
Arthur.

492
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:50,829
Does this stay winter the whole game?

493
01:11:50,829 --> 01:11:53,789
Arthur, have you completely lost faith in me?

494
01:11:53,869 --> 01:11:59,069
Our needs right now are supplies, equipment, and a way out of here.

495
01:11:59,789 --> 01:12:02,029
Everything else, including coal.

496
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:07,880
Okay, there's enough of those bastards down there to deal with as it is.

497
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,430
All right, so we're gonna go carbine.

498
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,960
Not every area is snow.

499
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,760
Well, it's good at least that they put it in.

500
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:24,170
It's not just the desert and only the desert.

501
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:29,659
Take a shot every time somebody says okay.

502
01:12:34,189 --> 01:12:35,550
All right, no fucking around here.

503
01:12:35,949 --> 01:12:37,869
Look at how funny the streamer is jokes here.

504
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:39,960
You know what I'm saying?

505
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:40,760
And we already got that.

506
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,880
We got a cinematic mode.

507
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,600
Oh, LOL.

508
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,119
And then, oh, I fell off three times.

509
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:45,079
LOL.

510
01:12:45,079 --> 01:12:46,439
And then, you know, I'm not doing that again.

511
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:54,920
Steve here.

512
01:12:54,920 --> 01:13:02,800
Can they see us?

513
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:10,010
I don't think I should be crouched.

514
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:10,810
I can't do it here.

515
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:12,729
This is such a long walk down.

516
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:17,210
Wait till I get the game to open up for me before I do any dumb shit.

517
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:31,119
Baby, I'll take the lead on this.

518
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:32,399
What a terrible stream.

519
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:32,560
Hey.

520
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,000
They're gonna be gunning for you.

521
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,159
What?

522
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,439
They ain't got me yet.

523
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:35,840
Why?

524
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:36,720
What happened?

525
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:38,239
I'm just playing Red Dead.

526
01:13:42,329 --> 01:13:43,130
Just jump off.

527
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:43,289
No.

528
01:13:53,069 --> 01:13:54,270
One guy said that.

529
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,520
Yeah, and he's the one guy now.

530
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,960
Why do I always read negative feedback?

531
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,880
Gosh, I need to make sure everyone's happy.

532
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,680
And if people are not having fun, then I want to make sure you're having fun.

533
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:18,170
I really can't fuck this up.

534
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,260
I got to be on point here.

535
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,899
No, like, where's the shed?

536
01:14:28,779 --> 01:14:30,119
Is that the shed?

537
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:31,399
Why am I dropping frames?

538
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:31,720
I don't...

539
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,279
No, I'm...

540
01:14:37,579 --> 01:14:38,300
Is that a guy?

541
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,100
No, that's a good guy.

542
01:14:49,899 --> 01:14:50,619
Take the lead.

543
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,579
He's giving me an opportunity.

544
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,840
Look at Dutch to give instructions.

545
01:15:02,189 --> 01:15:03,069
Send in the gang.

546
01:15:03,069 --> 01:15:03,789
I'll take the lead.

547
01:15:18,189 --> 01:15:21,520
Wait, does the sniper elite thing?

548
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:29,239
Damn it.

549
01:15:39,399 --> 01:15:40,920
Tapping R2 when not aiming.

550
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:41,159
Okay.

551
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:44,170
This is the last guy.

552
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,369
Oh, I'm on top of the roof.

553
01:15:45,369 --> 01:15:46,250
God, don't fall.

554
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,369
Oops, sorry.

555
01:15:47,369 --> 01:15:48,409
That guy was making a video.

556
01:15:49,449 --> 01:15:51,260
I should have been quiet.

557
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,220
That guy was, like, recording.

558
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,180
He's definitely, like, laughing and, like, screaming right now.

559
01:15:56,539 --> 01:16:01,390
Get over there.

560
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:10,810
Pocket sensitivity.

561
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:15,550
Lord.

562
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:22,039
I got somebody.

563
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:22,840
Oh, I'm not sure.

564
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:40,090
Right through his hat.

565
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:44,600
One more guy.

566
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:44,920
Where is he?

567
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:45,239
Right here?

568
01:16:46,039 --> 01:16:47,800
Oh, he just got me right in the mouth.

569
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:50,199
He showed me right in the face.

570
01:16:52,520 --> 01:17:09,550
I'm actually getting shot right in the face like that.

571
01:17:22,909 --> 01:17:23,550
Damn it.

572
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:30,079
Just be dead.

573
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:31,279
What did I shoot twice?

574
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,479
Oh, that was the slow motion.

575
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:37,119
FP.

576
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:38,239
Oh, all right.

577
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:39,680
Is this 90 FOV, though?

578
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,159
This just makes me want this to be on PC.

579
01:17:47,899 --> 01:17:49,260
There's so many corpses, though.

580
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:50,060
How am I going to get them all?

581
01:17:51,979 --> 01:17:57,600
There is a slider in the menu.

582
01:17:59,310 --> 01:17:59,710
Is there?

583
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:04,880
I don't know.

584
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,039
What?

585
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:05,439
A camera?

586
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:07,949
Okay.

587
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:08,189
Yeah.

588
01:18:08,189 --> 01:18:08,510
Okay.

589
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:08,989
It is there.

590
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,520
Get that fucking head bob off, please.

591
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:16,359
All right.

592
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:16,600
Cool.

593
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:19,640
Is it, uh, fly immediately?

594
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,279
Actually, that...

595
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:30,430
No FOV number.

596
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:31,869
It's just this one.

597
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:34,199
Bar.

598
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,039
Bar dragged to the edge.

599
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:47,000
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

600
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,199
More of them are coming in right now?

601
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:49,960
I didn't get a chance to loot.

602
01:18:55,949 --> 01:18:56,510
First person.

603
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:10,890
Well, aiming sure is a thousand times better in first person.

604
01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:12,329
I will definitely say that.

605
01:19:13,369 --> 01:19:22,319
I'll say that.

606
01:19:33,239 --> 01:19:33,800
Defend.

607
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,000
Is there...

608
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,119
Is there Deadeye in this game?

609
01:19:43,449 --> 01:19:43,689
Damn.

610
01:19:43,689 --> 01:19:44,890
I'm not going to knock this cat off.

611
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:57,479
I'm going to cover.

612
01:19:57,479 --> 01:19:58,829
Oh, there is Deadeye.

613
01:19:58,829 --> 01:19:59,949
I can even, like, see it.

614
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:02,720
Oh, shit.

615
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:06,859
Got that guy.

616
01:20:06,859 --> 01:20:07,739
He's dead.

617
01:20:07,739 --> 01:20:09,659
I don't have to worry about him causing any problems.

618
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:30,510
Shit.

619
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:39,680
Oh, my God.

620
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:43,560
I didn't...

621
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,199
I didn't want to...

622
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:45,079
I don't like that.

623
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:46,119
I didn't like that.

624
01:20:46,119 --> 01:20:47,079
Holy shit.

625
01:20:56,409 --> 01:20:57,050
Holy fuck.

626
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:58,170
That was insane.

627
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:02,840
All right.

628
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:08,460
New, uh...

629
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,100
Oh, here we go.

630
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:09,659
Weapon wheel.

631
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:11,550
Deadeye tonics.

632
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:12,829
Fully restores Deadeye.

633
01:21:12,829 --> 01:21:13,310
Okay.

634
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:13,789
You can...

635
01:21:13,789 --> 01:21:14,989
You release to use them.

636
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:17,840
Hides your identity while committing crimes.

637
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,159
Okay.

638
01:21:21,159 --> 01:21:22,439
Let's bring it right back up.

639
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:22,600
All right.

640
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,399
Let's keep looking around.

641
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:24,439
I got this many bodies.

642
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,600
Do it with the shotgun?

643
01:21:29,689 --> 01:21:30,010
Lord.

644
01:21:31,289 --> 01:21:32,010
He didn't like it.

645
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:32,890
He loved it.

646
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,960
They're probably going to keep coming over here.

647
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:39,920
I guess I have to do it.

648
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:48,010
Is this...

649
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:49,930
You can actually cut people's heads off in the game?

650
01:21:51,149 --> 01:21:51,789
My Lord.

651
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,079
Shoot the bodies with the shotgun.

652
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:09,319
Oh, man.

653
01:22:13,319 --> 01:22:14,039
No way.

654
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,039
No fucking way.

655
01:22:18,039 --> 01:22:19,079
There's, like, this...

656
01:22:19,079 --> 01:22:19,560
That's...

657
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,279
That's insane.

658
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:23,819
That's...

659
01:22:23,819 --> 01:22:24,380
It's just...

660
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:25,180
It's brutal.

661
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:26,859
Oh, man.

662
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:27,500
It's brutal.

663
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,380
This is brutal.

664
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:31,869
This game ain't coming out in Germany.

665
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:33,609
Like, no way.

666
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:38,239
This game ain't going to release in Japan.

667
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,840
Is it out in, like, Germany and Japan?

668
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:52,189
What do they do?

669
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:06,439
It is out.

670
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:06,680
Okay.

671
01:23:11,739 --> 01:23:13,500
Blood confirmed it is out in Germany.

672
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:13,979
As is?

673
01:23:15,819 --> 01:23:16,539
Wow.

674
01:23:16,539 --> 01:23:20,590
Well, hold on.

675
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:20,989
Yeah.

676
01:23:20,989 --> 01:23:21,949
I have to loot everybody.

677
01:23:21,949 --> 01:23:23,550
You can't give me all these exes here.

678
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:31,850
Got somebody's belt buckle?

679
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:37,359
I will.

680
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:37,920
But just hold on.

681
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:39,600
There could be money on everybody.

682
01:23:43,609 --> 01:23:44,409
89 cents?

683
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,649
I'm just collecting bits right now.

684
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:48,189
What does this guy have?

685
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,149
What does this guy have on him?

686
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,720
Hey, thank you for the championship belt.

687
01:23:56,989 --> 01:23:57,550
Big bits.

688
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:57,949
All right.

689
01:23:57,949 --> 01:23:58,590
We'll look for, like...

690
01:23:59,229 --> 01:23:59,630
Come on.

691
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:00,109
What do you got?

692
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:01,960
No.

693
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,579
That guy's not even...

694
01:24:03,579 --> 01:24:04,380
That guy's not a sub.

695
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,560
Come on.

696
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:07,520
We don't even have, like, a sub?

697
01:24:16,539 --> 01:24:17,260
What?

698
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:20,720
How many people here aren't even subbed?

699
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:24,010
All right.

700
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:24,890
I gotta cut that out.

701
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,119
Oh, Jesus Christ.

702
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:34,239
All right.

703
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:38,060
What do we got here?

704
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:39,420
He's on to us.

705
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:41,050
Because he's...

706
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:41,529
I'm just...

707
01:24:41,529 --> 01:24:42,170
I'm not...

708
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:42,409
No.

709
01:24:42,409 --> 01:24:45,130
I don't care if you aren't subscribed.

710
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:47,529
Don't worry.

711
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:55,960
Chewing tobacco?

712
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:56,199
Cool.

713
01:24:59,079 --> 01:25:00,199
Pressuring fans.

714
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,460
No, you guys know that.

715
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:03,020
It's not a...

716
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:03,659
I don't care.

717
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:10,479
Oh, there's an upper le...

718
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:12,000
Oh, there's a Fortnite chest up here!

719
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,760
What's in here?

720
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,640
Epic!

721
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:15,439
Is it an epic?

722
01:25:19,069 --> 01:25:19,630
Holy shit.

723
01:25:19,630 --> 01:25:20,029
Somebody's...

724
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:23,720
Hey, the great Lord Walden just gave out

725
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:27,630
20 tier 1 community subs.

726
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:28,510
Thank you.

727
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:30,039
Thank you so much, dude.

728
01:25:34,989 --> 01:25:36,909
20, 20 subs here from Walden.

729
01:25:36,909 --> 01:25:37,390
Thanks, man.

730
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:42,729
Oh, my Lord.

731
01:25:42,729 --> 01:25:43,529
No, no, that's not...

732
01:25:43,529 --> 01:25:44,649
This is not what...

733
01:25:44,649 --> 01:25:46,409
Thank you for the 10 subs, Afrik.

734
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:48,680
Thank you.

735
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:55,630
Oh, here it comes.

736
01:25:58,329 --> 01:26:01,720
I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut.

737
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,479
But thank you, guys.

738
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,039
Unnecessary, but thank you.

739
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:10,300
All right.

740
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,180
I gotta search up here.

741
01:26:11,739 --> 01:26:13,930
There's still things that I need to get.

742
01:26:14,409 --> 01:26:17,949
Okay, that hurt.

743
01:26:17,949 --> 01:26:19,689
What else is in here?

744
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:24,189
Sub...

745
01:26:24,189 --> 01:26:25,310
Oh, there's a chest.

746
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:26,829
I told you there's a Fortnite chest in here.

747
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:29,920
Take.

748
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:33,520
Take.

749
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,079
Is it a knife?

750
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:36,479
$2.12.

751
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:40,350
And cigarettes.

752
01:26:44,859 --> 01:26:45,180
Whoa.

753
01:26:49,399 --> 01:26:50,039
What is it?

754
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:51,159
Is this dynamite?

755
01:26:51,159 --> 01:26:52,279
How would I even climb this?

756
01:27:04,039 --> 01:27:05,310
But thank you, though.

757
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:06,430
Those guys giving out those subs.

758
01:27:07,229 --> 01:27:08,119
Really appreciate it.

759
01:27:10,829 --> 01:27:12,270
Did we get everything?

760
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:13,069
Think so, boss.

761
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:15,149
Found this on one of them.

762
01:27:15,149 --> 01:27:15,630
Thank you.

763
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:17,470
This is perfect.

764
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:19,310
Oh, yeah.

765
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:19,869
Interesting.

766
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:23,149
This is something about the train they was gonna rob.

767
01:27:23,149 --> 01:27:23,710
Train mission.

768
01:27:23,710 --> 01:27:24,189
I bought it.

769
01:27:24,189 --> 01:27:24,670
It was $20.

770
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:26,829
A Mr. Leviticus Cornwall.

771
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:28,750
Mount back up.

772
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:29,710
Let's keep moving.

773
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,239
What does dynamite smell like?

774
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:35,039
All right, let's get out of here.

775
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:36,159
Proud of you, boys.

776
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:36,880
Proud of you, boys.

777
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,859
All of you.

778
01:27:38,859 --> 01:27:39,340
Raisins.

779
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:41,850
Now that's tobacco.

780
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:43,050
Gunpowder smells like...

781
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:46,140
Not bad for some starving down in...

782
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:49,239
They can pummel us hard as they like.

783
01:27:49,239 --> 01:27:50,439
It's hard to describe.

784
01:27:50,439 --> 01:27:51,800
We'll always get back up and fight.

785
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:57,609
That's who we outlawed.

786
01:27:57,609 --> 01:28:02,840
Wait until we have John, Sean back...

787
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:08,569
If you drop the frame, it's gonna happen.

788
01:28:08,569 --> 01:28:10,649
I can't even get angry about it anymore.

789
01:28:10,649 --> 01:28:14,010
This hit'll hurt him a lot more than anybody in the head.

790
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:17,689
You know, there's no sense crying over spilt milk.

791
01:28:17,689 --> 01:28:18,810
Sorry, spilt.

792
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:19,529
It's just gonna happen.

793
01:28:19,529 --> 01:28:20,170
But I guess we'll see about that.

794
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:23,130
Just thankfully it's not happening as frequently as it was the beginning of the train.

795
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:27,500
You know, he'll come after us.

796
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:28,380
Oh, of course he will.

797
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:31,500
Just like all the rest.

798
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,819
But we're gonna stay a step ahead of them.

799
01:28:33,819 --> 01:28:36,359
Make sure we always know where they are.

800
01:28:36,359 --> 01:28:38,760
Until they know where we are.

801
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:42,279
We allowed ourselves to get a step behind at Blackwater.

802
01:28:42,279 --> 01:28:43,960
That won't happen again.

803
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:57,529
All right, hang in, fellas.

804
01:28:57,529 --> 01:28:58,729
Let's make some ground.

805
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,119
Cowboy Skyrim.

806
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:09,079
Yeah, that's not a bad thing, though.

807
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,300
It really makes you feel like Spider-Man.

808
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:14,699
That's right.

809
01:29:24,989 --> 01:29:27,529
Bring him back alive.

810
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:30,939
You got it.

811
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:34,810
Chase down and lasso Old Driscoll.

812
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:39,979
So do I get the la-

813
01:29:39,979 --> 01:29:41,180
Hold and get the weapon wheel.

814
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,500
This is gonna bring up the lasso.

815
01:29:44,539 --> 01:29:48,170
Okay, hold L2 to ready the lasso and aim it at Old Driscoll.

816
01:29:48,489 --> 01:29:54,039
One of the most fun mechanics of the last game here it is.

817
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:10,670
Keep L2 held and dismount.

818
01:30:18,649 --> 01:30:31,369
Let's interrogate him in the water.

819
01:30:31,369 --> 01:30:34,079
Let's drown this motherfucker.

820
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,800
He got out.

821
01:30:47,449 --> 01:30:51,920
Where did he go?

822
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:56,960
Oh, he's-

823
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,680
He actually is, like, getting drowned.

824
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:09,039
Give him a stone.

825
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:10,399
Yep, drop him on the back of the horse.

826
01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:18,270
He might actually be able to drown.

827
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:20,479
Maybe.

828
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:23,779
Okay.

829
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:31,050
Yellow line in the radar is the shortest route in the yellow truck.

830
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:43,479
Press the thumb stick to pet the horse.

831
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:48,680
Yeah, I got him.

832
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:49,180
I pet him.

833
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,199
I gave him a little-

834
01:31:52,199 --> 01:31:53,319
Hey, you're doing a great job.

835
01:31:58,270 --> 01:31:58,829
Thank you.

836
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:06,319
Shut up.

837
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:20,250
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

838
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:20,890
Come on, where is it?

839
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:21,390
Come on.

840
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:22,510
Come on.

841
01:32:23,369 --> 01:32:23,869
Come on.

842
01:32:31,689 --> 01:32:32,489
Trying to shoot the bird.

843
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:36,680
Can you throw dynamite at birds in this game?

844
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:37,960
Does it follow them like in the last one?

845
01:32:45,149 --> 01:32:45,550
What bird?

846
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:46,430
The bird that was on the right.

847
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:52,909
Yes, that does-

848
01:32:52,909 --> 01:32:54,189
That is still in the game.

849
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:04,960
You can try.

850
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:05,439
I mean, we'll-

851
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:06,239
Eventually we'll try.

852
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:24,920
Seeing birds from other dimensions now.

853
01:33:38,119 --> 01:33:39,880
204 bones to go.

854
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:47,680
Bring him to the fire and drop him in.

855
01:33:48,939 --> 01:33:49,979
We're eating good tonight.

856
01:33:57,119 --> 01:33:58,479
Hold near your horse to remove him.

857
01:34:09,069 --> 01:34:09,470
I would.

858
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:10,590
No, I can't right now.

859
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:11,470
We can't do that.

860
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:14,569
I'm not doing that whole thing again.

861
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:22,699
I thought I was going to start cutting him.

862
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:31,560
Uncle.

863
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,439
Mr. Williamson.

864
01:34:33,079 --> 01:34:35,479
Tie this maggot up someplace safe.

865
01:34:35,479 --> 01:34:37,479
We get him hungry first.

866
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:39,159
I got a saying, my friend.

867
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:42,079
We shoot fellas.

868
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:42,960
There's no need shooting.

869
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:44,720
Save fellas.

870
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:45,600
There's no need saving.

871
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:46,800
And feed them.

872
01:34:47,359 --> 01:34:48,319
There's no need feeding.

873
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:52,560
We are going to find out what you need.

874
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,050
I can't believe it.

875
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:58,010
An O'Driscoll in my camp.

876
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,369
I ain't an O'Driscoll, mister.

877
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:00,729
I ain't-

878
01:35:00,729 --> 01:35:03,399
Oh, whatever you say, son.

879
01:35:04,359 --> 01:35:05,640
Well done, Arthur.

880
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,819
I'm just sorry we missed out on call.

881
01:35:07,819 --> 01:35:08,619
Why am I still holding them?

882
01:35:08,619 --> 01:35:09,739
Well, there's time enough for that.

883
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:13,739
Now, I gotta figure out if we can hit that train.

884
01:35:14,699 --> 01:35:15,100
Okay.

885
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:28,170
That's a long saying.

886
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:37,960
Old friends complete.

887
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,369
Now we got P on the map.

888
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:42,649
Oh, excuse me.

889
01:35:42,649 --> 01:35:44,329
I probably got an F.

890
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:48,350
Complete the mission without taking any health items.

891
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,159
One, two, three, four, five.

892
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:53,760
I got a 25% on the test.

893
01:35:54,960 --> 01:36:06,010
Now, let's keep going through the tutorial.

894
01:36:06,649 --> 01:36:10,109
Well, I don't-

895
01:36:10,109 --> 01:36:11,149
I don't even need to get on the horse.

896
01:36:11,149 --> 01:36:12,189
He's literally right here.

897
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:25,180
Stu, I'll take you.

898
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:26,859
I'm gonna starve to death up here, Mr. Morgan.

899
01:36:29,979 --> 01:36:30,779
We're okay.

900
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:35,680
We have a few cans of food and a rabbit.

901
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:36,399
For what?

902
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:37,439
10, 12 people?

903
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:40,430
That was in the Navy.

904
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:44,029
I do not wish to hear about what you got up to in the Navy, Mr. Pearson.

905
01:36:45,310 --> 01:36:46,590
We were stranded at sea.

906
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:48,909
For 50 days.

907
01:36:48,909 --> 01:36:50,989
And you unfortunately survived.

908
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:56,890
When we ran away from Blackwater, I wasn't able to get supplies in.

909
01:36:57,850 --> 01:37:00,569
Idiot streamer, idiot streamer.

910
01:37:00,569 --> 01:37:03,449
Sometimes shopping trips need to be cut short.

911
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:04,970
We'll survive.

912
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:06,649
We always have.

913
01:37:07,930 --> 01:37:09,689
If needs be, we can eat you.

914
01:37:09,689 --> 01:37:10,569
You're the fattest.

915
01:37:11,449 --> 01:37:13,369
I sent Lenny and Bill hunting and they-

916
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:14,329
Oh, ew.

917
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:14,649
Gross.

918
01:37:14,649 --> 01:37:16,010
I mean, fucking disgusting.

919
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:19,579
Bill's a fool.

920
01:37:19,579 --> 01:37:22,060
Unless those mountains are full of game they want to read,

921
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,979
ain't no wonder they found enough of this.

922
01:37:24,699 --> 01:37:26,159
We'll go find something.

923
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:26,880
Come on, Arthur.

924
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,079
Wait a second.

925
01:37:29,079 --> 01:37:29,579
Hold on.

926
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:31,979
Here.

927
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,239
You're gonna need something to eat out there.

928
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:36,640
Assorted salted off.

929
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:40,279
Starving will be preferable.

930
01:37:40,279 --> 01:37:41,399
Come on, let's go.

931
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:46,359
Is it weird that these gross shit items that are in these games,

932
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:52,279
rotten can of beans and packed in spam that's four years expired,

933
01:37:52,279 --> 01:37:53,079
I want to eat them.

934
01:37:54,039 --> 01:37:55,880
If I could pull that out of history and eat it,

935
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:56,920
I would probably do it right now.

936
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,079
Nobody else does that?

937
01:38:07,079 --> 01:38:08,359
I can't use it and you'll have to.

938
01:38:09,819 --> 01:38:10,619
Bow and arrow.

939
01:38:10,619 --> 01:38:13,899
Use a gun and we'll scare off every animal for miles around.

940
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:17,659
You're never too old to learn, I imagine.

941
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:18,880
You okay?

942
01:38:20,439 --> 01:38:20,939
Yeah.

943
01:38:21,319 --> 01:38:21,819
Yeah, man.

944
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:23,890
Yeah.

945
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:34,319
Match the speed of your cockspill.

946
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:48,460
Is that guy on YouTube that eats the old military rations?

947
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:49,979
Yeah, that channel's great.

948
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:59,149
I've put on that guy's channel and just fallen asleep to him eating old rations

949
01:38:59,149 --> 01:39:01,470
and woken up at like 60 videos a player.

950
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:02,750
They'll be needing to feed.

951
01:39:04,109 --> 01:39:08,800
I'm going to tap square when we're stationed from this move.

952
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:15,960
Oh, you can like hold it.

953
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:16,460
That's cool.

954
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,760
Is that just showing off?

955
01:39:26,989 --> 01:39:27,789
I didn't wait.

956
01:39:27,789 --> 01:39:28,670
I'm not saying what?

957
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:29,470
I didn't say that.

958
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:30,770
No.

959
01:39:38,359 --> 01:39:39,640
I've done that to your videos.

960
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,140
Yeah.

961
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:41,340
Just happened.

962
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:57,069
Let's put this out on a tray.

963
01:39:57,869 --> 01:39:59,550
Yeah, I know the line.

964
01:39:59,550 --> 01:40:00,050
Come on.

965
01:40:00,050 --> 01:40:01,229
You don't think I've ever seen it before?

966
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:21,659
Automatic cinematic.

967
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:34,090
Coffee instant cheetos.

968
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:36,810
Oh, God.

969
01:40:47,899 --> 01:40:50,300
I wonder how big the actual map is when the game opens up.

970
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:53,340
But if it's too strong, they won't move.

971
01:40:53,340 --> 01:41:01,340
Stay quiet.

972
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:02,380
Do a German impression?

973
01:41:02,939 --> 01:41:03,439
Okay.

974
01:41:03,739 --> 01:41:06,520
Stop here a second.

975
01:41:07,159 --> 01:41:07,960
I see something.

976
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:11,960
I was about to just wildly make fun of myself.

977
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:13,319
Like just make fun of me.

978
01:41:14,359 --> 01:41:15,399
No, I'm not doing that.

979
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:19,079
Why would I do?

980
01:41:19,079 --> 01:41:19,579
No.

981
01:41:22,439 --> 01:41:23,640
I've already done this before.

982
01:41:24,359 --> 01:41:26,199
How can you tell?

983
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:28,600
I've already done it.

984
01:41:29,319 --> 01:41:33,579
We'll track them on foot.

985
01:41:33,579 --> 01:41:34,989
You're going to need the book.

986
01:41:34,989 --> 01:41:36,909
Don't leave it on your whole gun.

987
01:41:36,909 --> 01:41:38,430
It'll scare everything around.

988
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:39,949
Approach your horse.

989
01:41:39,949 --> 01:41:40,750
Don't use the gun.

990
01:41:41,630 --> 01:41:51,020
So use L2R to select a stowed weapon.

991
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:52,699
Carbine.

992
01:41:52,699 --> 01:41:53,180
Bow.

993
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:53,819
That's the one.

994
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:58,840
No point setting off without that bow.

995
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,439
You make less noise and you crouch.

996
01:42:00,439 --> 01:42:01,079
And slowly.

997
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:04,460
I'm not going to do it.

998
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:05,579
I'm not going to shoot him in the head.

999
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:10,670
You see the tracks?

1000
01:42:11,229 --> 01:42:12,189
I think so.

1001
01:42:13,069 --> 01:42:14,270
Maybe not.

1002
01:42:14,270 --> 01:42:14,909
I see them.

1003
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:18,600
You can use eagle eye to highlight animal tracks.

1004
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:21,630
Okay.

1005
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:23,600
Focus on the track.

1006
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:25,260
Nope.

1007
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:32,119
Enable Eli to focus on the tracks to highlight them again.

1008
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:34,750
Okay.

1009
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:35,229
Yeah, I can.

1010
01:42:35,229 --> 01:42:35,710
I see it.

1011
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,039
Your scent is also shown in eagle eye blowing in the direction of the wind.

1012
01:42:46,039 --> 01:42:47,640
Animals will flee if they smell your scent.

1013
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,800
They'll remain downwind or far away when hunting.

1014
01:42:50,920 --> 01:43:01,899
So is this is that my smell going this way or are those those in his tracks, right?

1015
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:09,130
He's going to be up here.

1016
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:21,479
It's top track.

1017
01:43:21,479 --> 01:43:22,520
I mean, I'm just going to follow it.

1018
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:26,960
22 miles per hour top right.

1019
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,159
Which way is it going though?

1020
01:43:31,279 --> 01:43:31,760
This way.

1021
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,250
Unknown animal.

1022
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:41,050
It's going to be a deer.

1023
01:43:43,659 --> 01:43:44,939
22 miles per hour.

1024
01:43:44,939 --> 01:43:46,859
That would be very, that'd be a lot.

1025
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,420
I don't see anything.

1026
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:49,579
All right.

1027
01:43:49,579 --> 01:43:50,060
There he is.

1028
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:50,220
Okay.

1029
01:43:55,899 --> 01:43:56,779
Am I close enough?

1030
01:44:02,029 --> 01:44:04,029
I'm going to have to do like a, is it bullet drop?

1031
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:14,909
Aim for the head.

1032
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:17,100
A swing.

1033
01:44:17,979 --> 01:44:26,000
Do I not go get the meat?

1034
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:30,510
Hunt another deer.

1035
01:44:30,510 --> 01:44:30,750
Okay.

1036
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:33,770
Well, we're going to, I want to get the meat here.

1037
01:44:34,489 --> 01:44:36,890
Select and call while aiming at it.

1038
01:44:37,449 --> 01:44:40,890
This will give you a chance of a clean kill as they raise their head before fleeing.

1039
01:44:41,689 --> 01:44:45,659
So there's one over here.

1040
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:49,500
All right.

1041
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,180
Well, I do have any luck.

1042
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:59,500
I mean, we get the 21 stink meter up there.

1043
01:45:04,510 --> 01:45:04,829
Okay.

1044
01:45:04,829 --> 01:45:09,630
I haven't even played God of War, the new one for PS4, but I feel like this is the game.

1045
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:11,229
Is that this happens in that game, right?

1046
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:16,720
This is like the same game.

1047
01:45:20,909 --> 01:45:21,789
Something like that.

1048
01:45:21,789 --> 01:45:21,949
Yeah.

1049
01:45:21,949 --> 01:45:22,750
Which way is it going?

1050
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:37,229
I mean, this, this is, is it going that way or to the left?

1051
01:45:39,479 --> 01:45:46,090
That I don't know the tracks.

1052
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:47,210
I mean, those are tracks, right?

1053
01:45:48,010 --> 01:45:49,149
Or did I make those?

1054
01:45:49,149 --> 01:45:49,869
No, it's down here.

1055
01:45:58,140 --> 01:45:58,939
What's the button to call?

1056
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:07,289
Fuck.

1057
01:46:07,289 --> 01:46:15,260
I don't even need to call them.

1058
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:16,380
Why did I even call?

1059
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:17,579
That was no reason for that.

1060
01:46:21,149 --> 01:46:23,310
I, I made these tracks.

1061
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:31,869
Okay.

1062
01:46:31,869 --> 01:46:32,430
There he is.

1063
01:46:42,199 --> 01:46:43,979
Got it.

1064
01:46:43,979 --> 01:46:44,220
Okay.

1065
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:45,100
We can stop this now.

1066
01:46:45,659 --> 01:46:46,060
Let's go.

1067
01:46:56,409 --> 01:46:58,170
Oh, it's actually pick up the whole thing.

1068
01:46:58,970 --> 01:47:01,119
This is realism.

1069
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:06,989
The compendium tracks what you have discovered in the world.

1070
01:47:06,989 --> 01:47:09,390
It can be accessed from the progress section of the pause menu.

1071
01:47:09,949 --> 01:47:15,579
We found the realism.

1072
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:21,239
You can increase the distance that the horse will respond.

1073
01:47:22,039 --> 01:47:24,359
Come on.

1074
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:29,579
There he is.

1075
01:47:31,289 --> 01:47:33,050
Shoot the deer in the head.

1076
01:47:33,850 --> 01:47:35,770
I don't want to explode the team's head.

1077
01:47:37,289 --> 01:47:37,529
All right.

1078
01:47:37,529 --> 01:47:52,189
Let's go.

1079
01:47:53,289 --> 01:47:54,010
Yes, you do.

1080
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:54,649
No, I don't.

1081
01:47:55,289 --> 01:47:56,729
I don't want to do it.

1082
01:47:56,729 --> 01:47:56,970
All right.

1083
01:47:56,970 --> 01:48:04,880
Meet up with Charles.

1084
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,239
All right, Charlie.

1085
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:08,880
I'm coming.

1086
01:48:19,850 --> 01:48:21,210
I want to see its brains.

1087
01:48:21,210 --> 01:48:21,609
Jesus.

1088
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:22,409
Christ.

1089
01:48:29,079 --> 01:48:37,979
Uh, so you drop off carcasses to Pearson at the meat factory to contribute to gang supplies.

1090
01:48:37,979 --> 01:48:38,460
Okay.

1091
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:40,140
I knew you'd be okay with that bow.

1092
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:42,220
Okay.

1093
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:43,340
You want to see the deer's balls?

1094
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:44,460
Everyone's freaking out about it.

1095
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:44,619
All right.

1096
01:48:44,619 --> 01:48:45,739
Let's look at the deer's balls.

1097
01:48:46,699 --> 01:48:47,819
The deer doesn't have any balls.

1098
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:49,899
Right.

1099
01:48:49,899 --> 01:48:50,220
Never.

1100
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:50,460
Okay.

1101
01:48:51,579 --> 01:48:53,149
That's not how it works.

1102
01:48:53,149 --> 01:49:02,199
You know, there are.

1103
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,359
See, I told you they weren't going to be there.

1104
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:21,710
I missed you guys.

1105
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:22,350
I really did.

1106
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:27,600
I like, I unequivocally missed all of you.

1107
01:49:33,710 --> 01:49:34,840
Eat.

1108
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:38,829
We give the cab cook five minutes to grab the essentials and go.

1109
01:49:39,470 --> 01:49:42,750
And he doesn't even bring a crumb of food.

1110
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:44,109
Good that we caught more than one.

1111
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:48,430
We've only been up here a few days and have already picked up two more mouths to feed.

1112
01:49:49,149 --> 01:49:50,350
One more.

1113
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:52,270
I bet German doesn't even know me.

1114
01:49:53,949 --> 01:49:54,350
Boy.

1115
01:49:55,550 --> 01:49:56,029
What's your name?

1116
01:49:56,029 --> 01:49:58,750
Karen Salt and awful Pearson was kind enough to give us.

1117
01:50:00,729 --> 01:50:02,569
She has a wild look in her eyes.

1118
01:50:02,569 --> 01:50:04,409
Of course.

1119
01:50:05,449 --> 01:50:06,649
She lost her husband.

1120
01:50:06,649 --> 01:50:08,569
Even me, the one that makes fun of you.

1121
01:50:08,569 --> 01:50:09,130
Even you.

1122
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:10,569
Even you.

1123
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:26,239
No, I'm not going to show the horse balls.

1124
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:29,279
That's too easy.

1125
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,359
I'm not going to shoot the horses balls with an arrow.

1126
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:35,119
Like everybody wants me to do.

1127
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,119
That's not going to happen.

1128
01:50:50,319 --> 01:50:51,119
No one said that.

1129
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:51,680
Yes, they did.

1130
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:58,399
Oh, shit.

1131
01:50:58,399 --> 01:50:58,800
Bears.

1132
01:51:07,149 --> 01:51:07,869
No, don't shoot him.

1133
01:51:10,350 --> 01:51:11,069
Am I losing?

1134
01:51:11,069 --> 01:51:11,949
What's wrong with my arms?

1135
01:51:12,270 --> 01:51:12,750
No, let it go.

1136
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:13,069
Let go.

1137
01:51:13,069 --> 01:51:13,390
Let go.

1138
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:13,710
Let go.

1139
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:14,109
There you go.

1140
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:27,289
You're going awfully fast.

1141
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:34,239
Oh, the horses.

1142
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:35,520
The horse is spooked.

1143
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:35,840
Okay.

1144
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:40,159
I'm going to hold L3 to make the horse not.

1145
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,890
Can you see us?

1146
01:51:45,319 --> 01:51:46,119
Fight bear.

1147
01:51:46,119 --> 01:51:46,680
Fight bear.

1148
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:54,159
Right in the fucking head.

1149
01:52:01,069 --> 01:52:01,949
All right, let's get out of here.

1150
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:06,170
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1151
01:52:10,649 --> 01:52:11,449
All right.

1152
01:52:11,449 --> 01:52:12,250
Cinematic mode.

1153
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:18,840
He's screaming.

1154
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:20,520
Where's my friend?

1155
01:52:21,239 --> 01:52:21,739
Come on.

1156
01:52:21,739 --> 01:52:22,060
Let's go.

1157
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:22,460
Let's go.

1158
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:23,340
Why is he standing there?

1159
01:52:23,979 --> 01:52:27,609
Is there a reason why he's just standing still up here?

1160
01:52:35,289 --> 01:52:35,930
The bear is gone.

1161
01:52:36,489 --> 01:52:37,479
Yeah, we're good.

1162
01:52:42,569 --> 01:52:43,449
I'm in combat.

1163
01:52:43,449 --> 01:52:44,090
No, I am not.

1164
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:54,640
Let's go.

1165
01:53:00,029 --> 01:53:01,390
I have to fight the bear now.

1166
01:53:01,949 --> 01:53:16,039
Okay, I need to turn it off for a second.

1167
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:16,439
Hold on.

1168
01:53:16,439 --> 01:53:17,000
Okay.

1169
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:17,960
Okay, okay, okay.

1170
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:18,680
Where's the bear?

1171
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,270
Where's the bear?

1172
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:29,149
I don't see a bear.

1173
01:53:32,939 --> 01:53:34,460
Give me the fucking carbine.

1174
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:45,340
There's no bear.

1175
01:53:46,439 --> 01:53:47,159
He's not here.

1176
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:52,680
Do you guys understand?

1177
01:53:57,369 --> 01:53:58,250
Do you see a bear?

1178
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:09,760
I don't see a bear.

1179
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:13,100
Wait, tracks.

1180
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:16,649
Right there.

1181
01:54:16,649 --> 01:54:26,279
The fuck is he?

1182
01:54:35,949 --> 01:54:36,510
He's not here.

1183
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:46,029
I see him.

1184
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:48,880
No, you don't.

1185
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,560
I mean, like, the red marker is over here.

1186
01:54:54,119 --> 01:54:55,640
Wouldn't it be over at the red marker?

1187
01:54:56,359 --> 01:54:59,880
I'm out of stamina.

1188
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:00,359
I gotta eat.

1189
01:55:00,359 --> 01:55:01,159
Hold on.

1190
01:55:01,159 --> 01:55:03,520
Why did you guys make me do this?

1191
01:55:04,239 --> 01:55:06,300
I was so close to the end here.

1192
01:55:10,649 --> 01:55:11,850
Eat a can of beans.

1193
01:55:11,850 --> 01:55:20,779
Give me my horse.

1194
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:24,810
You made you do this.

1195
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:25,529
You did this.

1196
01:55:26,649 --> 01:55:29,819
There was never any bear?

1197
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:33,800
Why do I hear it now?

1198
01:55:34,439 --> 01:55:40,539
Can we just leave?

1199
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:42,220
We can leave.

1200
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:42,619
Can't we?

1201
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:45,899
He said, return to Charles.

1202
01:55:45,899 --> 01:55:46,460
I said, go.

1203
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:47,340
Hurry up and return.

1204
01:55:47,979 --> 01:55:48,859
Where's my carcass?

1205
01:55:49,739 --> 01:55:53,050
Fucking carcass is on the ground over here.

1206
01:55:53,050 --> 01:55:53,930
That's what's happening.

1207
01:55:53,930 --> 01:55:54,329
I get it.

1208
01:55:57,789 --> 01:56:09,130
The horse is just as fucking stupid as I am.

1209
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:13,899
All right, this is why I couldn't move.

1210
01:56:13,899 --> 01:56:15,420
It has nothing to do with the bear.

1211
01:56:18,779 --> 01:56:20,859
Just get back on the horse and let's go.

1212
01:56:20,859 --> 01:56:22,859
See, everyone told me it's because I was in combat.

1213
01:56:22,859 --> 01:56:24,539
This isn't World of Warcraft.

1214
01:56:25,579 --> 01:56:26,460
We can just leave.

1215
01:56:32,619 --> 01:56:33,260
All right, let's go.

1216
01:56:39,149 --> 01:56:39,630
Fuck.

1217
01:56:39,630 --> 01:57:00,220
Who is this fucking bear?

1218
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:09,960
I soft-locked the game?

1219
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:10,680
No, I didn't.

1220
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:38,829
We're fine.

1221
01:57:46,430 --> 01:57:47,710
Shoot bear with arrow.

1222
01:57:48,670 --> 01:57:51,470
And my toddler brain was like, shoot bear with arrow.

1223
01:57:51,470 --> 01:57:53,470
Okay, I do think you say.

1224
01:57:54,909 --> 01:57:55,869
I'm a caveman.

1225
01:57:56,829 --> 01:57:59,369
Jerma, do that thing.

1226
01:57:59,369 --> 01:58:03,529
I do think me shoot arrow to bow to bear head.

1227
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:14,430
Me shoot bear.

1228
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:17,289
Chat say good idea.

1229
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:36,399
We laugh.

1230
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:40,960
We laugh at lowbrow joke.

1231
01:58:42,840 --> 01:59:09,199
Me stream on Twitch with bad internet.

1232
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:20,189
Me try explain TCP IP to Bogo.

1233
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:25,920
Bogo throw rock at head.

1234
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:58,060
Well, it looks good.

1235
01:59:59,659 --> 02:00:02,140
I'm streaming at 6,000 right now.

1236
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:07,149
I mean, when it's good, it looks great.

1237
02:00:07,869 --> 02:00:08,109
Right?

1238
02:00:08,909 --> 02:00:09,550
When it's bad.

1239
02:00:14,619 --> 02:00:25,520
The hell is calling me right now?

1240
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:30,039
But I cannot answer that.

1241
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:42,300
Thank you for showing me how to bow properly.

1242
02:00:45,689 --> 02:00:47,369
Takes a lifetime of practice to master.

1243
02:00:51,079 --> 02:00:51,399
Let's see.

1244
02:00:54,199 --> 02:00:55,239
So this upgrades.

1245
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:58,119
Did they go a Fallout 4 route here?

1246
02:00:59,239 --> 02:01:01,399
Do I have to bring supplies and build stuff?

1247
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:03,880
Just drop it down in here.

1248
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:06,460
What a surprise.

1249
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:09,020
Find a camp rat loitering around in the kitchen.

1250
02:01:09,020 --> 02:01:10,939
Is that any way to greet an old friend?

1251
02:01:10,939 --> 02:01:13,100
I feel like we haven't spoken for days.

1252
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:15,260
I do my utmost to avoid you.

1253
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:16,539
He loves me really.

1254
02:01:16,539 --> 02:01:17,979
It's his sad way of showing affection.

1255
02:01:17,979 --> 02:01:19,020
It's not forced, that's good.

1256
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:20,300
No, it isn't.

1257
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:21,420
Now shoot, get lost.

1258
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:23,739
Well, see you gents later.

1259
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:26,460
See, you got on just fine.

1260
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:27,340
Charles is a wonder.

1261
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:28,140
Have a drink, boys.

1262
02:01:28,699 --> 02:01:29,420
You earned it.

1263
02:01:30,539 --> 02:01:31,020
Have a drink.

1264
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:31,739
It's urine.

1265
02:01:31,739 --> 02:01:33,420
Jesus, what is that?

1266
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:34,699
Navy rum, sir.

1267
02:01:34,699 --> 02:01:35,739
It's the only thing.

1268
02:01:35,739 --> 02:01:36,539
The only thing.

1269
02:01:37,819 --> 02:01:39,100
Keeps you sane, it does.

1270
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:41,739
Yeah, seems to have done a treat on you.

1271
02:01:41,739 --> 02:01:43,420
You go rest that hand, Charles.

1272
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:44,779
I'll be fine in a few days.

1273
02:01:44,779 --> 02:01:47,340
You mind helping me with the skinning, Mr. Morgan?

1274
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:48,619
It's easier if we do it together.

1275
02:01:48,619 --> 02:01:49,659
I'll get to skin you.

1276
02:01:50,619 --> 02:01:53,079
You're always one with the jokes, aren't you?

1277
02:01:53,079 --> 02:01:53,640
Come on.

1278
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:56,199
This really isn't a job for a man with a burnt hand.

1279
02:01:56,199 --> 02:01:57,720
I'll see you both later.

1280
02:01:57,720 --> 02:02:04,199
See, that guy has the quintessential haircut of end of the plate of spaghetti.

1281
02:02:05,399 --> 02:02:06,840
Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, you can take this.

1282
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:07,560
I'm done.

1283
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:08,439
Are you sure you're done with that?

1284
02:02:08,439 --> 02:02:09,000
Yep, yep.

1285
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:14,220
Arthur, come on, get that knife.

1286
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:22,109
Just get him.

1287
02:02:22,109 --> 02:02:23,069
Now shoot the deer.

1288
02:02:23,069 --> 02:02:25,229
No, I'm not going to fuck up the tutorial missions.

1289
02:02:25,789 --> 02:02:27,390
That was very quick.

1290
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:30,039
That's what it looks like in there?

1291
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:31,640
Not too bad, Mr. Morgan.

1292
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:37,789
I thought it was wires and components and shit.

1293
02:02:37,789 --> 02:02:38,750
It looks like that in there?

1294
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:43,630
And pretty much any town, if you're looking to make a legitimate bit of money, of course.

1295
02:02:44,350 --> 02:02:46,189
I thought we just made animals.

1296
02:02:46,189 --> 02:02:47,069
They're like computers.

1297
02:02:47,069 --> 02:02:50,909
Well, if you catch anything else, sir, you bring it to me.

1298
02:02:50,909 --> 02:02:51,409
Sure.

1299
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:53,789
Thank you, Mr. Morgan.

1300
02:02:53,789 --> 02:02:58,750
Heck, Arthur Morgan's first decent bit of hunting after all these years.

1301
02:02:59,710 --> 02:03:01,470
Well, we're on the run now.

1302
02:03:01,470 --> 02:03:03,630
Everyone's got to do their bit to survive.

1303
02:03:03,630 --> 02:03:04,590
You're not a Chuck E. Cheese.

1304
02:03:04,590 --> 02:03:05,470
It's like good stew.

1305
02:03:05,470 --> 02:03:06,189
The folk need it.

1306
02:03:07,069 --> 02:03:08,430
It's been a tough few days.

1307
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:21,579
Few days later, you unlocked the master hunter challenge.

1308
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:24,119
All right, tutorial complete.

1309
02:03:24,119 --> 02:03:31,260
It's been a bad few weeks, but Dutch, being Dutch, he is busy making plans and

1310
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:36,539
Dutch being Dutch, those plans involve robbery and dreams.

1311
02:03:39,310 --> 02:03:39,949
Not yet, huh?

1312
02:03:40,590 --> 02:03:42,909
Who the hell is Epiticus?

1313
02:03:42,909 --> 02:03:45,630
I thought you was reading him his last rites.

1314
02:03:45,630 --> 02:03:49,149
Now I see you're introducing him to your other passion.

1315
02:03:49,149 --> 02:03:52,350
I'll mind you to show me some respect, Mr. Morgan.

1316
02:03:52,350 --> 02:03:53,710
Mind away, Reverend.

1317
02:03:54,590 --> 02:03:55,789
You're still here then?

1318
02:03:57,359 --> 02:03:57,920
I owe you.

1319
02:03:59,579 --> 02:04:00,460
And you'll pay me.

1320
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:02,989
For the moment, just rest.

1321
02:04:04,409 --> 02:04:07,659
Arthur, I think it's time for the train.

1322
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:09,100
Want me to come?

1323
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:12,380
Of course I do, but look after it.

1324
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:14,060
I was always ugly Dutch.

1325
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:15,260
It's just a scratch.

1326
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:16,619
Don't lie still, son.

1327
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:18,060
What's that kid doing?

1328
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,020
Get that kid out of here.

1329
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:21,100
This is an M-rated game.

1330
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:22,140
He's not allowed in here.

1331
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:24,380
He's seen me now.

1332
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:26,640
What's left of me?

1333
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:28,670
What about you?

1334
02:04:29,229 --> 02:04:30,750
Guess I was hoping to see a corpse.

1335
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:32,670
Bide your time.

1336
02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:33,949
You'll see plenty of them.

1337
02:04:33,949 --> 02:04:35,550
You're a rotten man, John Marsden.

1338
02:04:35,550 --> 02:04:37,310
He is an idiot, Abigail.

1339
02:04:37,310 --> 02:04:38,189
We all know it.

1340
02:04:38,189 --> 02:04:39,069
Fix the desync.

1341
02:04:39,069 --> 02:04:41,470
Now, railway men.

1342
02:04:42,430 --> 02:04:44,029
Tell me what happens here.

1343
02:04:44,029 --> 02:04:44,510
Ready?

1344
02:04:44,510 --> 02:04:45,470
At the water tower.

1345
02:04:45,470 --> 02:04:46,670
Just before the tunnel.

1346
02:04:46,670 --> 02:04:47,869
Ain't a problem.

1347
02:04:47,869 --> 02:04:49,390
Why are we doing this?

1348
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:50,189
Weather's breaking.

1349
02:04:50,189 --> 02:04:50,829
We could leave.

1350
02:04:50,829 --> 02:04:52,510
I thought we was lying low.

1351
02:04:53,789 --> 02:04:55,390
What do you want from me, Hosea?

1352
02:04:55,390 --> 02:04:57,789
I just don't want any more folks to die, Dutch.

1353
02:04:57,789 --> 02:04:58,989
We're living, Hosea.

1354
02:04:58,989 --> 02:04:59,630
We're living.

1355
02:04:59,630 --> 02:05:00,510
Look at me.

1356
02:05:00,510 --> 02:05:01,310
We're living.

1357
02:05:01,310 --> 02:05:01,949
Even you.

1358
02:05:02,510 --> 02:05:04,109
But we need money.

1359
02:05:04,109 --> 02:05:06,109
Everything we have is in Blackwater.

1360
02:05:06,109 --> 02:05:06,510
Of course.

1361
02:05:06,510 --> 02:05:07,949
You fancy heading back there?

1362
02:05:07,949 --> 02:05:08,449
No.

1363
02:05:09,310 --> 02:05:10,380
Listen, Dutch.

1364
02:05:10,380 --> 02:05:11,739
I ain't trying to undermine you.

1365
02:05:11,739 --> 02:05:12,539
I just...

1366
02:05:12,539 --> 02:05:13,180
Okay.

1367
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:16,939
I just want to stick to the plan, which was to lie low, then head back out west.

1368
02:05:17,579 --> 02:05:20,140
Now, suddenly we're about to rob a train.

1369
02:05:20,140 --> 02:05:20,779
Now it's too fast.

1370
02:05:20,779 --> 02:05:22,220
What choice have we got?

1371
02:05:22,859 --> 02:05:24,140
The Viticus Cornwalls.

1372
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:25,340
No joke, Dutchie.

1373
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:27,260
Who is the Viticus Cornwall?

1374
02:05:27,260 --> 02:05:27,819
Can I fix it?

1375
02:05:27,819 --> 02:05:31,579
He's a big railway magnet, sugar dealer, oil man.

1376
02:05:31,579 --> 02:05:33,100
Well, how good for him.

1377
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:35,739
Sounds like he has more than enough to share.

1378
02:05:35,739 --> 02:05:36,300
Dutch.

1379
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:41,500
Gentlemen, it is time to make something of ourselves.

1380
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:42,939
Get your horses ready.

1381
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:44,859
We have a train to rob.

1382
02:05:44,859 --> 02:05:45,359
Better?

1383
02:05:59,869 --> 02:06:00,369
Bad.

1384
02:06:00,369 --> 02:06:00,869
Bad.

1385
02:06:07,239 --> 02:06:08,199
Everything's weird?

1386
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:09,479
No, it's not.

1387
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:17,149
We're riding with the gang.

1388
02:06:17,149 --> 02:06:17,710
All right.

1389
02:06:17,710 --> 02:06:18,590
We're riding with the gang.

1390
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:26,909
The street smells like pee now.

1391
02:06:29,390 --> 02:06:36,090
I'm gonna get hit by this train, I guarantee it.

1392
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,680
Why is the audio playing backwards?

1393
02:06:41,399 --> 02:06:41,880
You know what?

1394
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:43,479
You know what?

1395
02:06:44,909 --> 02:06:46,270
Don't you be coming back here now.

1396
02:06:46,909 --> 02:06:52,239
I don't know why that just popped in my head.

1397
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:54,560
That's when you go to jail in the Monopoly game for Super Nintendo.

1398
02:06:57,199 --> 02:06:57,760
I don't know.

1399
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:58,399
That just popped in.

1400
02:06:59,039 --> 02:07:00,079
It just popped in saying hello.

1401
02:07:00,079 --> 02:07:00,479
I don't know why.

1402
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:09,819
It just popped in.

1403
02:07:09,819 --> 02:07:10,539
You know, it just popped in.

1404
02:07:18,199 --> 02:07:19,159
I wasn't paying attention.

1405
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:23,420
God damn it.

1406
02:07:23,979 --> 02:07:24,300
All right.

1407
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:25,020
Rob the train.

1408
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:25,899
That's all I need to know.

1409
02:07:26,539 --> 02:07:38,859
So what's the story about?

1410
02:07:38,859 --> 02:07:50,220
Group of bandits, setting up camp, getting deer, and fending off other bandits so far.

1411
02:07:50,939 --> 02:07:52,380
And John Marston.

1412
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:53,020
Oh, he did?

1413
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:53,579
He didn't die?

1414
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:57,069
Oh, that's a close one.

1415
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:05,800
Well, this is pretty.

1416
02:08:10,409 --> 02:08:11,449
Did we go to like zero?

1417
02:08:12,329 --> 02:08:13,439
What's that right over here?

1418
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:35,149
Well, I was under the assumption that I was hopefully going to be live for at least a couple hours.

1419
02:08:36,109 --> 02:08:36,750
Let's hope it's safe.

1420
02:08:42,989 --> 02:08:43,390
Holy shit.
