1
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:07,219
So if you don't know what Glover is, again, it's an N64 game where you play as a Glov.

2
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:14,580
And this music is pretty great, actually. I don't want it to be that loud, though.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:38,090
Can you see it? Where the fuck is it? Come on, Glover! Glover.

4
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:56,500
So I'm gonna use a controller. This sucks.

5
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,520
Excuse me! What do you mean, do you guys...

6
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,320
Excuse me, this was picked in pre-stream chat. You got...

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,599
Okay, Glov buddies, I would be ready, because you're gonna have to defend yourselves.

8
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,420
This is a Glover for the N64. If one of the mods could please change the stream to this.

9
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,420
Do you remember this place? This sucks.

10
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,379
You haven't even seen one second of this game.

11
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:32,150
Billy.

12
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:40,439
Cutscene. Shut up.

13
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:52,709
Is it evil character? The wizard?

14
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:58,969
Is my cam lagging from this game? I think it is.

15
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:17,659
The accident. The crystals.

16
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,870
Your viewers are tanking.

17
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:30,740
All right, Glov buddies, you got a lot going against you right now.

18
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:45,349
Okay, so Glover, you play as a Glov and you have a ball.

19
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:47,189
You can switch to different balls.

20
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:50,439
I'm gonna have to move the camera, probably, because it's in a bad spot.

21
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:59,590
Does that work?

22
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:08,729
Let's do a poll now.

23
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:09,770
No, what?

24
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,509
Hi, my name is Mr. Tip. If you want any hints, just speak to me.

25
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:16,090
You can do this by sending me and pressing B.

26
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,759
Oh, by the way, you can press and hold B if you ever lose your ball.

27
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:31,370
All right, let's go. Glover Pog.

28
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,889
Oh, that's why my ball is over here.

29
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:38,409
It's like fucking scary.

30
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:46,219
All right, I got my ball. How do I use the ball?

31
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:47,979
This is the entrance to the practice level.

32
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,340
Jump in the well to learn the valuable tips and tricks.

33
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,650
Return balls to the cave to open the gateways to other worlds.

34
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:11,129
How do you jump? That was actually kind of cool.

35
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,620
All right, here we go. Glover action.

36
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,480
You can do this by sending me and pressing B.

37
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,720
To spin the camera. Yep.

38
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,629
To control Glover without the ball, press left trigger.

39
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:42,600
Okay. Yep. Jump. Cool. Sounds pretty fun.

40
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,819
To negotiate steps, try bouncing the ball.

41
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:51,449
This can be done. Yep, I know that one.

42
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,029
That's kind of fun.

43
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,550
To duck, press and hold left trigger.

44
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,629
Tapping left trigger will make Glover do a cartwheel.

45
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:14,629
To get over higher walls, try throwing the ball.

46
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:24,069
To do this, hold B, then push and hold L in the direction that you want to throw.

47
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:30,699
You got it.

48
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,459
Holy shit. What the fuck?

49
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:32,959
Glover!

50
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,170
You can also use the throw action to get across gaps.

51
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,329
If you are about to slap or throw the ball,

52
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:45,620
you can change your mind by pressing left trigger.

53
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,430
Okay. So like, you mean like this.

54
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,259
Like, ah, no, I don't want to do that.

55
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,420
Whoops.

56
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:11,699
Oh my god. Glover bat chest.

57
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,579
Glove buddies, you're fucked, I think.

58
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:26,230
Glove buddies are going to be like not even 5%.

59
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,819
Some gaps are too wide to throw the ball across.

60
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,699
Hold A and push and hold in the direction you want to slap.

61
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:33,899
Yeah, okay. Yep. Remember this.

62
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:42,620
Oops. You're a levitating glove.

63
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,079
Nice. Okay.

64
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,360
This is a ball switch. Place the ball here to activate it.

65
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,120
Nice. This is sick.

66
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,430
Alright, let's see you pull. Let's see you pull.

67
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,949
Alright, glove buddies, this has to be, we're starting at over 50%.

68
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,740
Can you do that? Can the glove buddies get this over 50%?

69
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:31,850
Shallow water can be crossed without a problem.

70
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,610
You cannot hold the ball in deep water.

71
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,610
You will need to use the ramps to get the ball out. Okay.

72
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,689
I'll just slap it over there.

73
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,750
These crates can be broken by fist slamming them by just jumping and pressing left trigger.

74
00:07:51,750 --> 00:08:05,160
Okay. You can use your magic to change your ball.

75
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,319
If you are holding it, press right bumper.

76
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:17,579
How are we doing on the pull? Glove buddies are just children.

77
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,040
Whoa. They got it?

78
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,090
Do you guys understand that this goes up?

79
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,429
This goes up by 5% every like 15 minutes.

80
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,679
This is a Glover switch. Use fist slam to operate it.

81
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,889
Alright. Just like strawberry magic.

82
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:48,889
We've got to keep, we've got to be honest with ourselves here.

83
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,740
Some ledges may be too high to throw the ball.

84
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,500
Try combining bounce and throw.

85
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,110
I need a bouncy one.

86
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,149
What the fuck just happened?

87
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:16,950
What? Change the name.

88
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,309
What's the, what is the name of the stream?

89
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,940
Oh, God damn it.

90
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:30,250
I had this game when I was five and I could only play this tutorial because every enemy scared me.

91
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,799
That is like, I like that.

92
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:37,529
Yeah. We're at 60%.

93
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:47,690
Fuck you.

94
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:53,769
Yeah. And so in 10 minutes, we're going to do it again.

95
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:56,250
If it's not 55% at least, then I'm going to, I'm changing it.

96
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,779
That's how we do it here.

97
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:16,860
To what?

98
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,889
I don't want to tell you what the game is because then

99
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,570
some of the glove buddies might change their mind.

100
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:27,509
You know what I mean?

101
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:29,029
I got, I got to be careful here.

102
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:40,299
How do I do this?

103
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,340
Old B.

104
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:06,789
Ah, how can you be bad at Glover?

105
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,940
What do you mean bad at Glover?

106
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,179
I've done, I've played this game in like 30 years.

107
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:26,500
Does that count?

108
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:42,899
Got it.

109
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:43,539
Oh shit.

110
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:44,340
I have to, okay.

111
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,840
Yep.

112
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:56,860
I got to get more mods on that list if people like to change title.

113
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,100
All right.

114
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,259
So I mean, glove buddy.

115
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,580
How about glove buddies versus everyone?

116
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,539
Does that make sense?

117
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:03,899
I look weird when I'm flipped.

118
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:09,990
Like, like I look weird flipped horizontally.

119
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,389
All right.

120
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:21,909
Glove buds, glove buddies, glove buddies versus everyone else.

121
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:31,190
I'm going to end up changing this in fucking 15 minutes.

122
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,179
Okay.

123
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:40,860
Glove buddies versus everyone else.

124
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:50,230
Glover.

125
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,549
All right.

126
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:55,340
Let's go loud.

127
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:56,230
Okay.

128
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,470
Hi.

129
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:02,659
My name is, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

130
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:03,539
So now where do I go?

131
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:04,740
Is that kind of like Super Mario, right?

132
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,789
How about in here?

133
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:16,740
No, blocked straight in here.

134
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:27,899
Oh, he took my way.

135
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:28,940
That's my ball.

136
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,970
Whatever.

137
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:39,500
Okay.

138
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,419
I think I need to collect these gems.

139
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:46,379
This is just Mario.

140
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:53,100
Dude, Glover, this is, this is a classic game from the Nintendo 64 era.

141
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,539
Wait, where's my ball?

142
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:08,389
All right.

143
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,190
Level one.

144
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,110
Zoomers don't know what this is.

145
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,470
That's all right.

146
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,090
All right.

147
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:18,809
Let's go.

148
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:30,250
Collect gar ribs, gar ribs to score points.

149
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,529
Get 50 and win an extra life.

150
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,409
All right.

151
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:45,850
I'm trying to slap it.

152
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,539
Does that not hurt?

153
00:14:52,539 --> 00:15:06,299
Got it.

154
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,139
You can use your magic to change your ball.

155
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:09,019
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

156
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:14,309
It's really nostalgic.

157
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:16,470
I think the only time I ever actually played Glover

158
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:19,269
was when I rented it from Blockbuster one time.

159
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,399
I don't think I got it.

160
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:21,879
I didn't get it.

161
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,120
I think I just kept changing the ball in the tutorial and thought it was cool.

162
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,309
Like I kept doing that.

163
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:30,549
Yeah.

164
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,669
And I walked around with a bowling ball and then I returned it.

165
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:39,740
Ball soon.

166
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:39,980
Yep.

167
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,879
Let's get another ball in there.

168
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,080
Looking for 55% to continue.

169
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,919
Glove buddies, you're up against the world here.

170
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,320
Good luck.

171
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,809
Objects with cracks in them can often be smashed.

172
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:53,129
All right.

173
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,200
I need 50 of these.

174
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:06,970
Some enemies can be destroyed by fist slamming.

175
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:07,210
Yeah.

176
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,820
What?

177
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,539
What the fuck is that?

178
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,570
Is it 55?

179
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,360
This game looks like ass.

180
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:35,240
Okay.

181
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,539
Hey.

182
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,350
Hey.

183
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:47,029
It is a classic video game.

184
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:47,269
Okay.

185
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:54,019
I don't know if the Glove buddies are going to be able to keep it over 55.

186
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:54,659
By the way.

187
00:16:55,539 --> 00:17:03,059
We'll see.

188
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:07,319
It's a misleading poll.

189
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,000
Misleading poll.

190
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,339
Is it misleading?

191
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,940
Well, what else could it possibly be?

192
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,539
What else could that poll possibly be for?

193
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:35,349
I need to do a recount.

194
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:36,470
I didn't get it.

195
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,109
All right.

196
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:41,910
We'll do a recount.

197
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:50,980
It's misleading.

198
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:57,339
Fine.

199
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:57,819
Fine.

200
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:58,140
Fine.

201
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:00,539
All right.

202
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,259
Fine.

203
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:02,380
It was a misleading poll.

204
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,799
Do it again.

205
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:08,940
Only 5k people voted.

206
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:12,019
All right.

207
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:12,740
We need a recount.

208
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:15,509
Fine.

209
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,509
55% is what you're looking for.

210
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:36,119
This music is pretty good though.

211
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:36,599
Listen to this.

212
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:52,339
This is corrupt.

213
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:55,619
It's not corrupt.

214
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:56,420
What are you talking about?

215
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:05,509
I gotta go up there.

216
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:08,390
Oh, this is corrupt.

217
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:12,119
You don't know what you're talking about.

218
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,410
How do I get it out of the water?

219
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:19,740
Oh, there we go.

220
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:32,140
How are we doing?

221
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:50,329
It's not.

222
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,369
It's not.

223
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:51,849
Oh, boy.

224
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:53,589
47%.

225
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:55,269
No way.

226
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,309
This is your only last.

227
00:19:58,309 --> 00:19:59,269
This is it.

228
00:19:59,269 --> 00:19:59,589
Really?

229
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:04,059
The Glove Buddies can't get this to happen?

230
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,740
This feels rigged.

231
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,059
How?

232
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,339
I just...

233
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:26,980
I don't think there's enough passion

234
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,380
like there was for Strawberry Magic for Glover.

235
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:31,720
Should I go in there?

236
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:33,109
Yeah.

237
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:47,690
51%.

238
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,009
Uh-oh.

239
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,579
Really?

240
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:54,940
What?

241
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,140
Is this Zoomers 1?

242
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,500
What?

243
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:05,859
I can't.

244
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:06,980
I can't believe it.

245
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,940
You have to stop playing.

246
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,180
What?

247
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,579
I...

248
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:09,460
Hold on.

249
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:16,359
Hold on.

250
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:16,839
Give me a second.

251
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,519
Give me a second.

252
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,319
Stop now.

253
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:27,960
No, not yet.

254
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,359
Hold on.

255
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:28,599
Give me...

256
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:28,920
I will.

257
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,400
Give me a second.

258
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:32,579
That did not...

259
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:34,019
I thought that was gonna last a little longer.

260
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:43,509
Okay.

261
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:45,029
So I'm gonna stop playing

262
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:46,950
once I get one puzzle piece.

263
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,390
Holy shit.

264
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,430
Look at how big I am.

265
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,089
Isn't that cool?

266
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:08,950
What weird kind of shit is this?

267
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,549
Dude, it's Glover.

268
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:12,460
Don't fall off the mountain.

269
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,559
You didn't know what it was like back when I was a kid.

270
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,450
You didn't know what it was like

271
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:25,769
to rent a video game from Blockbuster.

272
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,819
I have no idea what the fuck it was

273
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:31,380
because there was no such thing as the internet.

274
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:35,049
You went by what the cover looked like

275
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,789
and you got home.

276
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:37,670
You put it in.

277
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,509
You put it in.

278
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:40,069
Press play.

279
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,269
How's the game?

280
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,470
It sucks.

281
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:45,289
Well, you're not gonna return it

282
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:47,690
because you have it for like four days from Blockbuster.

283
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,690
So this is what you're gonna do for the next four days.

284
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,220
I'm sorry, guys.

285
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:58,740
How do I get up there?

286
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,819
It was seven days.

287
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:02,779
It depended on the release.

288
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:03,819
Some of them were like two days.

289
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,109
Remember new shit was like

290
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:09,430
a day and a half or something ridiculous?

291
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,759
You guys remember that?

292
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:23,500
You're so old.

293
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Can I break that?

294
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,170
Wait, what?

295
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,210
Can I hold on?

296
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,029
How do I activate this?

297
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:32,150
I have to activate something with the big body.

298
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:35,930
This is cute.

299
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,049
What's wrong with this?

300
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:37,609
This is good.

301
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:37,849
Yeah.

302
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,980
What's your problem?

303
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:47,210
How can I get this move?

304
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:52,970
How do I move this?

305
00:23:53,690 --> 00:24:00,869
Where's the camera?

306
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:08,970
How do I get it to move?

307
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:09,849
30 minutes?

308
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,660
No, no, no, no.

309
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,099
I'm not gonna play this for 30 more minutes.

310
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:17,049
The same rules applied.

311
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:17,529
Okay.

312
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:18,890
Hold on.

313
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:27,339
This was a prank?

314
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:28,380
No, this is not a prank.

315
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,700
In the pre-stream, people were like,

316
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,980
yo, dude, Glover Pog.

317
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:48,470
Let me just do this last level.

318
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,630
By the way, the game that we're moving to is Blood.

319
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,769
It's a first-person shooter.

320
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:53,529
It's an old DOS first-person shooter.

321
00:24:54,170 --> 00:25:00,970
You're a liar.

322
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,930
I'm not a liar.

323
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,369
I said we weren't gonna play for another five minutes.

324
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:07,240
I want some weight here.

325
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:17,289
I could actually see myself playing this.

326
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:28,200
How much?

327
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,839
I'm looking at the chat.

328
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:29,319
Am I looking?

329
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,460
Okay.

330
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:30,859
All right.

331
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:31,099
All right.

332
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:31,579
I fell off.

333
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:33,660
This is this.

334
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,259
This is kind of a PogChamp game.

335
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,940
This Pog game.

336
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,150
Is that right?

337
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,869
This is kind of Pog.

338
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:43,299
Dude, you fell off.

339
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,049
You can't fall off in 20 minutes.

340
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:49,049
You can't fall off in 20 minutes.

341
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:49,849
Okay?

342
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:50,809
You can't fall off.

343
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:51,690
I didn't fall off.

344
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,890
It's been 15 minutes.

345
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,569
You don't fall off in 15 minutes.

346
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:55,690
You know what?

347
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,589
You don't fall off.

348
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:00,470
Dude, you literally fell off.

349
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,269
No, I didn't fall off.

350
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:02,900
I didn't fall off.

351
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:04,730
All right.

352
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,609
Let's play Blood.

353
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:06,569
That was Glover.

354
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:07,210
It was fun.

355
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:07,930
It's a cool game.

356
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,089
It's fun.

357
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:13,690
You probably like it if you got it.

358
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:13,930
Maybe.

359
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,119
I don't know.

360
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:16,359
All right.

361
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,160
Let's play Blood.

362
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,049
That was a cool fall joke.

363
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:21,829
There's like half the people here

364
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:23,349
that at Glove Buddies have pissed.
