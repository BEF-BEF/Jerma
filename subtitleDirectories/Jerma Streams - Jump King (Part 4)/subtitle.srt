1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,330
Okay, sorry about that. I had to move around a bunch of stuff in my room.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,500
All right, so what do you want to do for the next, like, couple hours or something?

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:21,820
Let's see, we got a dirty room. All right, let's, uh, let's get a pull-up. Why not?

4
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:36,259
Or maybe, uh, let's see, do roadblocks. Something relaxing? Yeah, we can, I mean,

5
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:39,380
we could go two days in a row doing something fucking wild and then just

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:46,420
fall on relaxation. I don't know if it's going to be Jump King. I don't think I can handle it.

7
00:00:49,700 --> 00:01:04,760
I don't know if I can handle it. Nancy Drew? No, no, let me see what we got. Let me put up my

8
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:11,829
steam. I'm also kind of developing a migraine right now and I don't know if it's because

9
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:22,659
of this dream I had last night or I got a, first of all, actually, let's get on campus.

10
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:29,700
Let me just turn the webcam back on. This dream I had last night was fucking ridiculous. It was

11
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:40,310
insane. It's probably the most ridiculous dream I've ever had in my whole life. Uh, but let's

12
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:48,900
tell, I want to talk to you about it. And then maybe, um, I have Katana Zero. Is Katana Zero

13
00:01:48,900 --> 00:02:01,500
like a super duper insane fast paced headache game? Yeah, it is. Okay. Watch me just open up

14
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,760
Jump King. Jump King is also a headache game. I'm definitely going to play that soon, but hold on.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:17,210
Let me get this back on stream here. Oh, that's not in the right spot. This is my bomb guide.

16
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,139
So, uh, I had this dream last night and I'm going to do my best to explain this.

17
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,620
People are going to think that there's something wrong with me. There probably is.

18
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:39,659
So, you know, when you have a dream that just everything is so connected and just, it just

19
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,180
goes from bullet to bullet to bullet point to bullet point really fast. And it's as if you've

20
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,780
been sleeping for like fucking six hours, like you've been dreaming for six hours.

21
00:02:48,469 --> 00:03:00,150
Oh, but it's actually in reality only been probably like 14 seconds. So I had this dream.

22
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,110
I actually wrote this dream down because it was so fucked up. I had to just rip off my iPad and

23
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:15,030
just start typing. So I'm sitting, I'm sitting on a beach, right? I'm on a beach and there is

24
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,270
a beautiful, beautiful beach and a huge mansion. I live in a huge mansion, apparently for some

25
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,900
reason. Right. And it's, it's like at least a 10 to $20 million house. This place is fucking huge.

26
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:35,020
And underneath there is this tunnel underneath the house. It's a big tunnel, huge, huge, huge.

27
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:41,659
You could be like a dozen cars can fit into more than that. So I'm sitting there and I don't know

28
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:47,819
why this big tunnel is under the house. It just is. So I'm swimming in this beach with this amazing

29
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:56,979
beach house. And all of a sudden I look up and a fucking an airplane, like a jet, a jet is just

30
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:03,060
screaming by and it's just like, that's getting kind of close. That's fucked up. Why is it getting

31
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,020
so close? This shit goes under my house way too close into the tunnel. It flies into the tunnel

32
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,240
and it's all, and I go, holy fuck, this is ridiculous. That I have, I have to do something.

33
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:21,160
I, this is ridiculous. It's going to my house. And I go under the water because I was like,

34
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,519
it's going to be so loud. And I plugged my fucking ears and I just hear,

35
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:33,750
and I'm under the fucking water going like, I opened my eyes and I could see dirt and debris

36
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,790
like coming into the fucking water and shit. And I'm like avoiding it. And I get out of the water

37
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,060
and I go, what the, what happened? And by the way, everything is normal. There's no,

38
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,339
there's no like wreckage or anything. It's, my house is perfectly fine. The house is completely

39
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:56,620
fine. So I walk, I've, I'm like running to the house and my sister and my fucking mother are in

40
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,819
the house and they're freaking out. They're going, what the hell was that? Yeah, that was a jet. I

41
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:05,740
don't know what that was. Like somebody did, was like a jet that just flew into the tunnel and it

42
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,980
like exploded. And I'm like, yeah, that's what the hell I got. We got to figure out what to do.

43
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,540
And I'm running by and there's, I have a big window right here, right? Huge window

44
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,220
out the window. I go, hold on. What's that? And I look out and there's like three,

45
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:27,100
it's my neighbor's yard and there's like two or three little dogs, little puppies, like little

46
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,740
tiny little dogs. And I'm going, oh, that's right. Those, that's the neighbor's dogs, the little dogs

47
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:42,339
and over perching on the fucking guy's wall is a tiger, a huge tiger. And I'm looking over going,

48
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:45,779
no, no, no, no, no, they're going to, they're going to kill, it's going to kill these geese.

49
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,660
He's going to kill those dogs. And my sister just goes, yeah, he's probably feeding right now.

50
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:57,339
And I'm just like, this is really bad. This is what we do. We have to do something. And we opened

51
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:04,060
up the sliding window and I screamed, right? I went like, and he freaked out and he ran away

52
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,279
for a second. And then my mother comes over, God bless her, right? My mother comes over and

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,879
like, it's like, okay, he got away. Let's close the window. And as she's moving the window with

54
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,600
her hands, it comes out of the frame and it's just, she's got it in her hands and she's like,

55
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,879
oh, the frame came out of the window. And the tiger comes back. The tiger comes back and he

56
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:29,720
like fucking looks right me in the eyes through the window, through the window. That's now open

57
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,300
because my mother, my mother took the whole frame off and I freaked the fuck out. I'm like,

58
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,779
mom, give me the fucking frame. Give me the fucking frame. We like sticking on the tigers,

59
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,819
fucking like walking towards the God, like getting really too close. And we get the fucking thing,

60
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,220
click it in and the tiger is still fucking there. We've just barely did it, right?

61
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:53,899
Right after that, I go, I gotta, I don't know what the fuck to do. I don't know what to do.

62
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:59,639
There's so much crazy shit going on. I gotta go get a weapon. So I fucking ran into what was

63
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,639
my huge like mansion living room and I grabbed a pair of shears. Okay. So I grab a pair of shears

64
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,639
and I flip them upside down to hold. So the rubber ends, I was going to like whack them

65
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,560
with the, with the other end. So I'm like, I'm going to go out there and like get out of here.

66
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:24,540
So, all right. I'm, I get that. I'll flip it around. I'm going outside. I hear somebody getting

67
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,779
mauled outside. Like, I'm like, someone's getting fucking mauled out there. So I,

68
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,379
I like go outside. I'm like, what the fuck happened? Somebody's getting

69
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:39,180
fucking mauled. So I'm out there and the tiger's not there anymore, but this guy is. And I don't

70
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,500
know if he was supposed to be my neighbor or I have no idea. He was just sitting there and he was

71
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:50,699
like blood everywhere. And he's just like, ah, you gotta take me to the hospital, man. And I'm like,

72
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:54,300
I don't know what to do. I'm like, stay right there. Just, just don't move. Don't move. Don't

73
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,860
move. And I fucking turned around and I'm like, I don't know what to do. And I ran back in the

74
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,019
house for a second. I was like, what do you call the police? And he goes, dude, are you fucking

75
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:06,699
serious, bro? I was like, I'm just trying to, I'm like, all right, let's, let's get you to the

76
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,220
fucking hospital. All right, let's get, I dropped my fucking thing. And I'm like, let's go, let's go

77
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,860
to the hospital to get in my car. And he goes, all right, sure. And he gets up and he's like normal

78
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,300
and he's like running and he goes, wait, wait, hold on a second. I can't go anywhere without my

79
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:25,290
cigarette. And he like went back to where he got mauled in the first place and like grabbed his

80
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:31,689
cigarettes. And then we ran out. And the last thing that I saw before I woke up was this fucking guy

81
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,570
putting a new cigarette in his mouth and we're running down the stairs and he's lighting it in

82
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,129
the house. And the thing that I, that out of all the crazy shit that happened, the thing that I

83
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:46,409
was most concerned about right now was you don't fucking, you're smoking in my house. You don't

84
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:55,220
smoke in my house. And then I woke up. Like you're smoking in my fucking house, dude. Like

85
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:04,460
kind of weird kind of like you think you can just do that. That was, it was insane.

86
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,889
And every single part of it was so intense. Everything I just described to you, each one of

87
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:18,090
those three different scenes was like living inside of a movie in three different occasions.

88
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:27,899
Oh, and I don't even know what that means. I don't know what that's supposed to mean,

89
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,889
but that was, that was, that was a wild one. It's been a while since I've had a dream like that.

90
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,889
Anyways, I just had to like vent that out because it was, that was seriously fucking ridiculous.

91
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:55,220
Anyways, we are going to do today, you know what, let's just, oh wait, what the fuck is this?

92
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:26,860
Jesus Christ. Oh, it's real. I mean, it is a real image, but not, it's doctored real.

93
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,240
And then of course there's

94
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,990
all right. What do I want to do? I'm like, I don't even know what I want to do. I want to like play

95
00:10:51,990 --> 00:11:03,179
Jump King, but I'm not sure I have what it takes right now. I have what it takes last night. Go

96
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:12,340
back to the coin game. Uh, no AI Dungeon is not going to work. It takes, it's going to take too

97
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:26,039
long to set up. All right. I'll get a poll in here. I'll put a poll down. Why not play Neopets?

98
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:42,889
All right. Let's do, this is what I would do right now. Put that one on there. Put that one on there.

99
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:54,649
I need a third option too. How about, uh, no, no, Drew crew. Not today. What else can I put on this

100
00:11:54,649 --> 00:12:12,539
list? Oh, this game looks like kind of cool. It's another cute game. All right. What do you want to

101
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:34,500
do? What do you want to do? It's a funny face stream. Oh yeah. That image just is still just

102
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:49,700
on there. You're right. Well, uh, I'm going to play Katana Katana Katana zero. Maybe just not

103
00:12:49,700 --> 00:13:00,070
tonight. Katana zero is something that I'm going to do. Give us the king. Give us the game. I mean,

104
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:06,730
it looks, it looks like people, the majority want to see some Jump King. I can't just like turn my

105
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,669
brain off and let that just happen. It like just go as long as, like I said, I've developed a

106
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:21,080
fucking migraine. So it's gotta be something that's easy for my brain to understand.

107
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:34,659
All right. I'm going to close this. Jump King. Nice streamer bait game. Hey, I played Jump King

108
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:39,799
like two weeks ago, three weeks ago. I played it. We had, oh, I couldn't see any of the subs that

109
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:51,610
came in, if anything, but we did have a couple of big ones come in. A friend pal buddy gave 5,000

110
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,330
bits earlier. Thank you friend. Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars. They say bugleberry pottery was

111
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,250
definitely the worst joke of the year, but it was also the funniest shit. I also laughed my ass off

112
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,809
of you taking pottery lessons for it. Watched and loved the content for eight years. Keep doing you.

113
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:15,720
Here comes the jet from the dream. All right. Let's do some Jump King. I'm just, we'll just

114
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:25,220
chill for a little bit. I'm just going to open it, but thank you friend pal buddy. We also had 10

115
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:34,600
community subs from fluid mesic right now. Thank you fluid mesic. And I think that's it for now

116
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,480
because I couldn't see it. Put on some chill music. AI dungeon doesn't need setup.

117
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,720
Now I don't want to do that beta website one. It's not as interesting as the one from collab.

118
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:48,500
Jump King is the opposite of chill. Well, I'm not going to take it seriously.

119
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:55,590
I'm not going to take it seriously. We're just going to play it and relax. All right. Give me a

120
00:14:55,590 --> 00:16:04,870
sec. I'll be back in one second while I set it up. Okay. Okay. That's not going to work. That's not

121
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:10,309
going to work. That's not going to work. That's not going to work. Jump King. I did save it right

122
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:22,250
before I got disconnected last night. I'm going to take it really, really just chill. You know,

123
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:30,809
I need my headphones. Yeah. Sorry for the large intermission here. I had my whole room set up

124
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:49,929
differently for, uh, keep talking and you're going to explode. What was the gift you? Oh,

125
00:16:49,929 --> 00:17:00,169
that's right. Yeah. I can grab that after. Let's change this shit around. Stop talking.

126
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:07,880
How about just stop talking? That makes sense. Just we'll cut the book. Stop talking.

127
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:46,009
No talking for two hours. Okay. Uh, let's continue. There's a hot babe at the top.

128
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:55,500
It's too loud. Is it too loud? It shouldn't be. It should be fine. All right. What can I know?

129
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:06,920
Okay. Stop talking. I know, right? I'm not supposed to talk. What's up here?

130
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:20,500
Do the big jump. I don't even know what the big jump means. Stop talking. I'm, I have to talk.

131
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:32,970
That's a much, that's a bigger jump than it looks like. Shit. Don't go all the way down.

132
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:47,180
I got here last time and then I fucked it all up. Didn't I? I'm trying to sleep. All right. I'll

133
00:18:47,180 --> 00:19:03,690
stop. Uh, my head on this. Wait. Ooh, shit. All right. Hold on. It's all right. It's all right.

134
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:21,210
Just go. Oops. Oh, fine. Fine. Fine. Ah, Dermis too hard on himself. What do you mean? Okay. What's

135
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:31,529
up here? Oh, I remember this part. This part sucks. This part actually sucks. Oops. Oh, fuck,

136
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:37,029
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I didn't see the lift here on the right. All right. How do I get up there?

137
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:46,789
Bounce off of it. Okay. Dermis so hard to do the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. All right. All

138
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:56,730
right. Is this the second DLC? I believe, no, I believe this is the first DLC. Holy shit. Okay.

139
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:10,539
Oof. I was tight. Okay. What's up? Oh, I did get up here. I remember I got up here and I was like,

140
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:20,839
oh, this is going to be easy. Okay. And you can fall all the way down this right side too.

141
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:36,460
Okay. For now, it's okay though. Now we're just across. Did you disconnect your stream last night?

142
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:40,380
I actually have no, that was insane timing because I didn't do anything.

143
00:20:41,609 --> 00:21:01,960
I didn't do anything. It just happened. Shit. I was shorter than that one. Okay. Now what?

144
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:14,859
I don't know which way to go. Can I go? All right. I can go in here. All right. You didn't thank my

145
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:31,220
$300. Wait, that was 300 bucks. When was the 300 bucks? Oh shit. What? I was going to say,

146
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:40,170
what are you talking about? All right. How am I going to get up? I think I have to bounce off

147
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:52,900
of that and to there. Yep. What's up? Okay. Silver coin, silver coin, silver coin. Who cares?

148
00:21:53,460 --> 00:22:10,170
No coins. I'm, I'm, I'm a non coin gamer. Okay. Again, or should I go, I'm going to go like this.

149
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:30,539
All right. Here we go. Okay. Now I gotta be careful. You're pretty good at this. I'm all

150
00:22:30,539 --> 00:23:02,329
right. It's got, you gotta go right, left, right. You have to. It's all right. Fuck. Hmm. Oof. All

151
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:21,019
right. Oh, it's fuck. That's not good. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That jump sucks.

152
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:31,420
Oh, that's bad. That's really bad. Actually. That's the worst thing that could happen.

153
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:51,849
Shit. It's not a total catastrophe yet though. Hold on. Okay. Oh boy. We're good. I could go for

154
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:59,079
some pizza right now. Oh, could you? Oh, I'm not, I don't feel like a pizza right now. So you can't

155
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:18,490
grab me. Fuck. I think I lost it from last night. Yeah. Yeah. It looks, I don't know if it's gonna.

156
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:25,980
Yeah. Yeah. It's lost from last night. Yeah. I lost it. Fucking my headaches getting so much worse.

157
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,460
Why can't I just replace my brain with like a digital fucking computer at this point?

158
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:40,539
Like why? We want, everyone wants self-driving cars. No, I want a self-driving brain.

159
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:04,660
What? Digital computer. LOL. Yeah. I want a digital computer brain. It's on its way.

160
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:20,420
Shit. Okay. Come on. Give me back up to there. Too much. Way too fucking much. That's a tiny jump.

161
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:34,220
No. Forced updates. Yeah. I'd rather have, I'd rather have like a digitized brain.

162
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:47,589
That's better. Don't go too hard. All right. Slowly but surely climbing back up to where I was.

163
00:25:48,230 --> 00:26:04,059
I don't know why. Just jump over though. Just jump over. Fuck.

164
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:20,680
Damn it. I'm telling you it's those 5G signals. I also have a doctor's appointment tomorrow too.

165
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:37,190
I'm bringing this shit up. No, no. Not the, not the digitized computer brain.

166
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,380
Hey doc. I've got something to tell you. You know, like when do, when are we going to have medical

167
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:53,400
procedures where I can replace my brain with a computer? That's not what I'm talking about.

168
00:26:57,589 --> 00:27:26,380
All right. Back up. We go. Oh yeah. Okay. Hope it goes well. Me too. Me too. Easy does it.

169
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:53,750
Easy does it. Oh, I made it back. Well, not I haven't not yet. Okay. Good. Same deal. Get back up here.

170
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:04,460
Oh, come on man. Sorry to hear that you're being, you're being put down tomorrow.

171
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,420
If anything I can say about this stream, I'm so glad I got to tell you about that dream.

172
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:34,700
Seriously. I'm so glad you guys got to hear it. Too much. Oops. Okay. All right. I made it back.

173
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:47,529
A little too much, but it's all right. Oh, I almost didn't make it. Oh, way too fucking much.

174
00:28:47,529 --> 00:29:17,000
Way too much. Shit. This is bad. What do I do about this? Oh, fuck. There we go. Oh man. What the

175
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:33,980
fuck was that? Get on there. Please. I'm begging you. It's so easy. No, no. I'll fall all the way

176
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:47,609
down. I don't want to fall all the way down. Holy fuck. All right. Now we go this way. I'm ready.

177
00:29:47,609 --> 00:30:13,140
Here we go. That jump is fucking insane. But all right. If I go, if I go left instead, can I make,

178
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:22,650
can I make that with a full jump? I'm not sure I can. Can I? No, I have to get this one, right?

179
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:58,970
Man, that sucks. That's so hard. That jump sucks. Jump King sucks. Okay. So I've, I've overshot that

180
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:05,930
jump two times, right? So it's lighter than that, but fuck man. It's so hard to judge.

181
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:42,140
Maybe before this was a 12 hour stream. No, no way. Not a chance. All right. Here we go.

182
00:31:42,140 --> 00:32:01,750
Got it. Boys and girls, we've made it to this next section. All right. Now what? What? Over,

183
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:13,819
wait, over there? Okay. Underburg. There's wind now. Oh God. There's wind. Shit.

184
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:27,339
Hmm. It's not that strong though. Is it? I wonder, can I, should I jump from all the way to the left

185
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:46,420
with the wind? I'm scared. Okay. I think I can just jump up and it'll take me, right? All right. Yeah.

186
00:32:46,420 --> 00:33:02,410
I didn't know how strong it was. Oh my God. This sucks. This sucks. Oh man. Okay. Slow down.

187
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:20,619
I could jump up a little, but then guys, I have to, all the way to the left is not safe.

188
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:53,880
What the fuck was I thinking? Shit. Now I'm back here again. Damn it. It's okay. Oh,

189
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:58,420
no. God, it's so hard. No, it's so hard. And if you fall, you're fucked. It's the anxiety of

190
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:01,699
being so scared that you're going to miss it and go all the way down.

191
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:39,130
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Oh shit. Oh shit. Um, uh, I was on it. What the fuck just happened?

192
00:35:39,130 --> 00:36:01,079
Slow down. I thought I missed it. Let me get up here and see what the hell this even is all about.

193
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:22,170
Let's get, okay. Um, yeah. Full jump to the left into the wind or full jump to the left with the

194
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:28,980
wind. I don't know if that's a good idea. Full left with the wind. I'm going to soar over this.

195
00:36:28,980 --> 00:37:05,579
Hopefully this isn't up top maybe. Ah, shit. Okay. Don't, Jeremy. Oh my God. I hate this part.

196
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:18,409
It's freaking me the fuck out. Jump King and chill. Jump King and increase headache.

197
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:38,460
Why would you don't, why'd you tell me to do that? I was a full jump left. Can you see the wall?

198
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:45,449
What are you doing? What do you mean the wall? Yeah. I, I, I'm scared to do a full jump left.

199
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:56,250
I'm going to soar over the whole damn thing. All right. I'm going for it. Yeah. I know. I can see

200
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,929
the pole. I'm just talking about if I do a full left, I'm going to soar the fuck over the whole

201
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:28,619
thing. Fucking wind. I swear to God. All right. Here we go. Oh my fucking God guys. No, it didn't

202
00:38:28,619 --> 00:39:15,289
work. Oh fuck. Oh, get back up there. You got to go softer than that. Very soft. Not very soft,

203
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:34,070
but shit. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. What's up here?

204
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:41,510
I'm scared to jump up there. Fold to the right with the wind. Full right with wind.

205
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:53,110
Oh, I don't have time to jump and check. Oh, I had to check. I had to check, man. I don't know

206
00:39:53,110 --> 00:40:25,110
what's up there. I couldn't, I didn't even see what was up there either. God damn it. I'm going

207
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:31,849
for it. I'm just jumping up with the wind. Holy shit. Okay. I was supposed to do that. All right.

208
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:46,920
Now. Oh fuck. All right. Now. Um, okay. There's two ways to go. I could try right or just,

209
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:05,900
oh my God, damn it. Fucking Jesus Christ. I just, I didn't, uh, what just happened?

210
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,219
Glag. My controller unfucking plugged. Plug it back in. Plug it back in. Plug it back in. Plug

211
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:20,809
it back in. Plug it back in. What the fuck? Are you serious? I am so mad right now. You've got to be

212
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:32,789
fucking kidding me. What? I, it was plugged in the whole time. Ah, that's so stupid.

213
00:41:33,429 --> 00:42:00,869
Fall right with the wind. I can't fucking believe that shit. Holy fuck, dude. Okay.

214
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:24,860
If you stand still, the wind doesn't, ow, my head. Oh yeah. Wait, I'm, oh, oh, I'm inside of a

215
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:30,860
building. I'm inside of the, I'm inside of a building. Okay. I'm inside of a building.

216
00:42:31,739 --> 00:43:05,139
Don't you dare. What the fuck just happened? You fucking idiot. I got to jump in the air and let

217
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:46,860
it, ah, now I have to get across. Okay. Oh, I do. Oh my God. I think I have to jump straight in the

218
00:43:46,860 --> 00:44:32,440
air. Okay. Oh shit. Oh God. No, no. Oh my God. It's so fucking stressful. I'll get it. I have to

219
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:57,260
jump a little higher. Now what? I can't see. Holy fuck me. Okay. And there? Holy shit.

220
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:23,320
Hello. This is my room. I'm getting tired just looking at you. Can you please leave? My fucking

221
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:46,360
God. Now what? Jump up straight in the air and carry to the left. The wind is getting inside,

222
00:45:47,559 --> 00:46:11,880
but it's too much work to seal the entrance. No, I do know. Uh, where? Middle? Right into the middle?

223
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:21,960
But wouldn't that drop me down? I see over on the right, but how do I get into that room?

224
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:35,110
I don't want to go in the middle. That room on the right. I can't make that jump. Do I have to slide

225
00:46:35,110 --> 00:47:06,019
off of the right side? Nope. Oh fuck. Oh my God. Where am I? What the fuck? Stop. Oh,

226
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:32,090
oh, this sucks. I don't understand. I'm in, I'm fucking, I'm screwed. And then it's full right

227
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:58,340
with the wind. Okay. I almost just missed it. So the middle, I, that's the middle right there.

228
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:03,050
You do know, you do have to go in the middle, huh? Shit. I have to go in the middle.

229
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:39,030
Fuck. What was I doing? Oh my God. I just like closed my eyes for a second. That just like hurt.

230
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:50,099
Oh my God. Try pick toe picks. No, I, uh, this sucks, but I'm going to have to turn my stream

231
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:58,619
off soon. Like the left side of my head through my eye. What a pain in the ass. What a pain in

232
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:08,170
the ass. I really don't want to, but fuck. And I have the doctor's appointment tomorrow.

233
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:26,309
Sorry. What was after this? Oh my fuck. Okay. Jump to what? Maybe jumping wasn't the smartest idea.

234
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:37,480
Uh, it don't matter. It was going to creep up on me anyways. Oops. Too much. You've been stressed

235
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:44,860
all stream. Well, no, not really. I'm all right. Just, it just hurts way too much again. Really?

236
00:49:44,860 --> 00:50:01,800
That was like half the power. There it is. All right. Get me up here and I'm just going for it.

237
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:14,019
I'm going for it right now. I did it. I did it. I actually did it. Now what? Um, should I go down?

238
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:26,179
Oh shit. Hi. Hi. I need to do a little jump with a tiny jump with the wind because look at that

239
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:34,489
ceiling. Oh my God. Needed to be more than that. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. I'm going home. Oh no. This is

240
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:42,539
bad. Oh, this is really bad. This is game over. This is stream over. If I fall down even more,

241
00:50:42,539 --> 00:51:02,039
this is stream over. Oh yeah. I haven't done this in a long time. Oh fuck. Oh well. It ain't over

242
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:23,420
yet. Not yet. It's still, I haven't fallen down too crazy yet. Too much. Oh bye bye. See you later.

243
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:31,449
I'll see you guys later. Nope. Not yet. I thought I was going all the way.

244
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:52,280
Munker Omega. I, I don't even know what that symbol is. How, how much power was that shit? What

245
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:40,460
fucking power are you doing? What the fuck? Fucking give me him. Easy with the power. Slow it down.

246
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:26,380
All right. All right. I'm good. End of the Jump King voice. Yeah. I don't know if I can handle it.

247
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:32,280
I knew that I was going to get crept up on. It happened a lot faster than I thought it was.

248
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,519
You know what? I'm just glad that we could play keep talking and nobody explodes

249
00:53:37,239 --> 00:54:19,369
because that was the plan tonight and fuck me. All right. Oh, God damn it. That jump sucks.

250
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:25,530
That jump fucking sucks. That jump sucks, man. That's the worst jump.

251
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:56,309
Yeah. All right. We're getting, we're getting to critical eye headache.

252
00:54:56,309 --> 00:55:04,090
It's critical. Yeah. It's critical right now. Oh yeah. It's over. It's over. We're at critical

253
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:23,449
headache. I think I'm going all the way down. All right. I'm going to try this one more time.

254
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:29,849
Oh my God. And I, I, I, do I have like a fever? What's going on? Am I like, fuck my body temperature

255
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:36,840
feels like it's like 5,000 degrees. Like what is going on? Oh, it's cause there's a bunch of

256
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:47,769
lights in here. That's why he's, he's dying. No, I'm not. I'm fine. All right. This is it. Last.

257
00:55:47,769 --> 00:56:42,980
No, no, no. Last temp writer. If I fall down one screen streams over. Let's go. Let's do it. What

258
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:50,969
just happened? Okay. I think Mike, the controller fucking unplugged again. I fixed this shit already.

259
00:56:54,170 --> 00:57:11,880
I fixed this controller like a month ago. That's a sign from God. Not yet. Pull right with the wind.

260
00:57:11,880 --> 00:58:05,139
Here we go. I gotta go a little harder than that. Go get some rest. I will. Don't worry. So I,

261
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:09,539
and another thing too, this is why I was like, fuck, I don't want to stream for like two hours

262
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:12,980
today. Uh, there's no stream tomorrow because I have a doctor's appointment. That's going to

263
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:24,409
last a while. So I will not be streaming tomorrow, but I will continue the day after that.

264
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,250
And we'll probably, you know, we're probably gonna start Katana zero. We'll just do it.

265
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:45,800
That's like a five hour game, right? I just want to get up there and try one more time.

266
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:51,159
No, I just want to try again. I just want to save a checkpoint up here so I can,

267
00:58:51,159 --> 00:59:08,659
oh, it's not fair or Kingsway Kingsway looks fun too. Oh my fucking God, Jeremy. What's Kingsway?

268
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:15,340
It's like a weird web browser, RPG pop-up window thing. It looks really, really interesting.

269
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:31,530
All right. Next attempt. Here we go. I gotta be a little bit harder.

270
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:57,880
Not too hard though with the wind. All right. Okay. Harder than that. I gotta wait. What's up

271
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:19,000
here? Oh my fuck. Oh my God. No, no, no, no. My God. Where am I? Where the fuck is my character?

272
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:43,400
No, you stop. All right. Last attempt and I actually have to leave. He's actually crying.

273
01:00:45,719 --> 01:01:00,969
I just wanted to fucking be joking too much. Way too much. All right. Goodbye.

274
01:01:01,769 --> 01:01:06,489
I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm saving everything. I'll pick it up another day.

275
01:01:06,489 --> 01:01:19,929
All right. I gotta go. That's a fun game. It's fun. It's a fun game. I just, my fucking head is

276
01:01:19,929 --> 01:01:27,050
on fire. So I hate fucking headaches more than anything. I would rather, I would rather shit my

277
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:32,570
pants on stream and sit in it than have a migraine on stream because one of them you wouldn't even,

278
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:37,349
you wouldn't even know happened. I would rather shit my pants and sit here in it. Like seriously,

279
01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:46,980
I would then have a fucking migraine. But anyways, I'll see you guys again on Tuesday.

280
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:53,769
As of Tuesday, we'll probably go, we'll do at least two, three days in a row as of Tuesday,

281
01:01:53,769 --> 01:01:56,889
because we did two days one day. We'll do two, three days in a row. Yeah, makes sense.

282
01:01:58,389 --> 01:02:16,170
Either Katana Zero Kingsway or, or Heroes 2. Let's start that. Or a GameCube game. I don't know.

283
01:02:19,099 --> 01:02:23,820
We'll see. Katana Zero. Yeah, we'll see. All right guys. I'm going to go through the bits.

284
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:29,260
It shouldn't take us too long. Thank you so much for watching. The earlier that was a lot of fun.

285
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:34,139
I got, I did some progress in Jump King 2. Keep Talking to Nobody Explodes was actually really

286
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:39,659
fun. That was, it was just all over the place. It's exactly what I thought was going to happen.

287
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:47,420
I guess we'll do that again and switch roles and see if we can do it. Am I going to do yesterday's

288
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:52,619
bits too? Oh wait, that's right. Fuck that, because I got cut off. I might not be able to

289
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:59,219
sit here for that long, unfortunately. Let me see. How many are, how many were there?

290
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:04,070
I'm sorry. I'm just going to be real. Let's see how many there were.

291
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:29,260
Because there's like a knife in my head right now. Let's see. From. Let's restore.

292
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:41,019
Yeah, I, I'm sorry guys. I can't sit here for this long. I wish I could. I really do.

293
01:03:44,469 --> 01:03:52,039
He's currently getting a lobotomy. I will, I will do these when I come back though. And they're

294
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:56,840
going to be very irrelevant, but I don't want to just blow them off. Blame fucking shitty

295
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:05,320
internet yesterday. We'll do it. I promise. I just, I can't do it right now. I can get through

296
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:13,670
the ones from today because there's only about five or six of them. I do apologize though,

297
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:17,909
seriously, but I'll see you guys on Tuesday for those of you taking off. If you want to stick

298
01:04:17,909 --> 01:04:23,429
around for the last bits of the stream here before I get out of here and like dunk my head in cold

299
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:37,539
water. I'll see you soon. Put this. Just do both next time. No, there's really only like six,

300
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:40,900
I think there's like six or seven here. Yeah, there's not very many. This won't take very long.

301
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:53,559
So earlier we had, we had a thousand bits from SSJ Mac. Thank you, Mac. Thanks for the 10 bucks.

302
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:56,920
Hey, German, thanks for making me laugh for like seven years. When are you going to bring back the

303
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:14,090
coffee commentary of justice and doom? Oh, I remember those. Probably never. That's just

304
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:20,059
every stream now. Thank you for the thousand bits though. Appreciate it. Sam of the freelance police,

305
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:24,460
thanks for the 500 bits. Hey German, happy 2020. You've been a constant companion for most of the

306
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:30,380
past decade. Hope this continues into this decade. I go to university abroad and your streams always

307
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:38,739
make me feel cozy and less alone. Please go back to the EU friendly schedule. I'm happy to be a

308
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:46,230
voice that you recognize and a voice that you are used to. That can either be in the background or

309
01:05:46,869 --> 01:05:49,670
if you're completely attentive to everything going on in the stream.

310
01:05:50,869 --> 01:05:57,300
Thank you so much for the support. And yes, I will be going back to one between one and

311
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:01,619
two PM Pacific starting in the next couple of weeks. I will make sure I let you know,

312
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:05,380
but I do want to get back on that. It was just a couple of things made it so I couldn't.

313
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:11,880
But yeah, thank you for the 500 bits. Nile Orion, thanks for the 300 bits. German is the Chris

314
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:25,000
Jericho of streaming. Wow. Effectator, thanks for the 250. German, you don't understand. I actually

315
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:31,320
obsessed over the bomb game last year. I learned Morse code just for the bomb diffusal and got to

316
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:40,170
the point where I could diffuse the first one before the lights came on. What? Oh my fucking God.

317
01:06:44,179 --> 01:06:47,380
How do you do that before? How is that even possible? Don't the lights turn on when you

318
01:06:48,699 --> 01:06:58,409
hold on? I'm confused. Oh, look at this. How don't the lights come on when you touch the

319
01:06:58,409 --> 01:07:17,929
bomb? See what I'm saying? I thought when you touch it, the lights turn on. There's a brief

320
01:07:17,929 --> 01:07:29,659
second of delay. Jesus. Yeah. So watching this stream, you must have been sitting there going,

321
01:07:31,059 --> 01:07:38,650
I could do this shit in my sleep. Thank you though. We'll get better. We'll get better.

322
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:43,210
We'll get better. Morning Maple, thanks for the 300 bits. Mutilated man for next German rumble.

323
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:47,449
Make him have a floppy intestine dangling. I don't even know what I just read. I shoot. Was

324
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:51,530
that, was that a bad thing? I don't know what that I just read. Um, I don't know what that was.

325
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:56,420
But I don't know about that. Thanks for the 300 bits. Morning Maple.

326
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:00,340
Freudian weapon, thanks for 250. What the hell are you eating before bed that's giving you those

327
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:10,230
kind of dreams? Not anything ridiculous. Oh, from your dream. Oh, right, right, right.

328
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:19,989
I'm okay. I want to copy and paste all the text I've punched into the iPad because it is delirious.

329
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:27,960
I wrote it so quickly. I have to like pull that over here. I'll do that like in a couple of days.

330
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:36,149
I'll show you. But thank you Freudian for the 250. Also thank you to Cookieinva for the 500 bits. Hey

331
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:40,470
Jerma, my girlfriend recently ended our four-year relationship because she doesn't love me anymore.

332
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:45,510
I'm pretty down and you helped me so much. I met your YouTube channel in the old days

333
01:08:46,149 --> 01:08:53,850
and though I can't sleep, I got to finally catch a stream live of yours. Sorry to hear that it's a

334
01:08:53,850 --> 01:09:03,079
long time. Four years is a significant time and a relationship. But the one thing you can bring from

335
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:10,020
that that's positive, that really is positive is when you date somebody for that long and it

336
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:17,180
doesn't work out, just I guess be look on the bright side of if it lasted like another few years,

337
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:25,819
you know, then you're talking five, six, seven years. It's a lot longer and it's a lot more to

338
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:31,159
process. Four years is a long time but I am certain that you'll find somebody else

339
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:43,619
and it wasn't meant to be. That's all you can take from it is just know that it was not meant to be.

340
01:09:45,189 --> 01:10:03,399
Eventually it will be to be. Much love to you though. Using somebody to teach math? What do you

341
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:14,699
mean that? What? Let's get the credits on here. Roll them. Short stream. We'll see you Tuesday.

342
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:22,550
Thanks everybody. Even if you subbed over the course of this almost just barely three hours

343
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:29,350
stream. It's a little one's compact money. Yeah it is. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.

344
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,789
Tomorrow the doctor's appointment actually is something I'm really looking forward to because

345
01:10:32,789 --> 01:10:37,750
it is with a new doctor that we're gonna start to talk about what I'm gonna do

346
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:46,300
about my rib cage problem and my hernia. So I'm... this is an appointment I've been looking forward

347
01:10:46,300 --> 01:11:00,069
to so I do not want to miss it. But thank you all of you. Hey Jamie, thanks for the 500 bits Jamie.

348
01:11:00,069 --> 01:11:05,189
You could do a chill pottery stream sometime to show the pottery training you did for bugleberry

349
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:13,909
so it doesn't go to waste. Yeah it's uh it didn't take that much time. It took like three weeks to

350
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:20,470
get that stream set up. The whole thing. But the pottery it was it was like four or five hours.

351
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:26,869
Like four and a half hours total of classes. So it's not like I spent months or weeks preparing

352
01:11:26,869 --> 01:11:40,579
for it. Do it anyways. You lied again. No I said it took away. When did I say I did three weeks of

353
01:11:40,579 --> 01:11:47,380
pottery lessons? Oh wait maybe I did just maybe I was just fucking around. I mean I took pottery

354
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:57,960
lessons and it was like five hours of classes. Oh he's backtracking. Is that a lie? No I

355
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:07,479
didn't I say it took three weeks to get that already? Maybe I did lie. I don't think I did.

356
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:12,039
Hey grandpa pissed thanks for the 250. Just wonder what happened to the previous 984 germas?

357
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:20,260
Well the first like 200 were mixed up into a pot of uh fucking liquid and the 200th one

358
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:28,220
201st one drank them. Got all the power. Um I guess I don't know what else you want me to say.

359
01:12:28,539 --> 01:12:35,189
Oh yeah that's right I'll show I'll show the cake Mario thing before I leave.

360
01:12:35,829 --> 01:12:44,279
But thank you uh grandpa piss. Thank you Pablo for 500 bits. Happy 40 months nerd. That's a very

361
01:12:44,279 --> 01:12:50,039
long time. I have to do new bit badges and sub badges. I gotta get on some of this shit for 2020.

362
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:57,829
I will I promise. I will get them done. Thank you for the 40 continuous months of supporting this

363
01:12:57,829 --> 01:13:03,800
stream. Jesus. Gore grinder thanks for 300 bits. Uh I hope your appointment goes well tomorrow.

364
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:09,500
Thanks for a bomb ass stream. Thank you for being here. Thanks for watching. I do too. Hope it goes

365
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:17,859
well. The PC Int thanks for 300 bits. Hey germa I had a massive migraine two days in a row and lost

366
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:21,699
both days sleeping to try and get rid of it. Both days you cheered me up and made me feel so much

367
01:13:21,699 --> 01:13:26,500
better being there streaming when I woke up and felt better. I appreciate that. I gave bits yesterday

368
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:34,140
but I don't know if you read them yet. I want you to say my name lol. It's Dejen. Dejen. Thank you

369
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:40,779
Dejen. And yeah migraines are the worst especially the worst migraines can just come on you and

370
01:13:41,739 --> 01:13:46,060
there's nothing you can do. Even if you take Tylenol or Advil it just doesn't work.

371
01:13:46,779 --> 01:13:55,189
It's just it's like a different kind of headache. It's such a pain in the ass. But yeah they are

372
01:13:55,189 --> 01:14:04,390
the worst. Thank you for the 300 bits though. Appreciate it. Bdlujay thanks for the 500 bits.

373
01:14:05,189 --> 01:14:09,670
I was in a discord chat with my friends while watching. Yo shout out to Alex and Keifer.

374
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:13,430
And we all had a blast seeing you and Joel yell at each other like idiots and also play

375
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:17,590
Jump King like a pro. I'm all right. Thanks for the laughs as usual. You always brighten my day.

376
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:27,590
Love you germa. Thank you. Thank you so much. You guys hanging out in a in a Skype call and just

377
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:34,199
fucking I love that. That makes me happy. Excedrin is good for migraines. Yeah doesn't

378
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:38,659
Excedrin have a shitload of caffeine in it though? And I take in a lot of caffeine anyways.

379
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:48,119
No it's just being a dark room and keep my eyes closed pretty much is how I get rid of them.

380
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:54,020
Thankfully they don't happen that much anymore. I think realistically only a few streams over

381
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:59,539
the last year have really been shut off from a migraine so that's pretty good. I'm just happy

382
01:14:59,539 --> 01:15:05,260
about that. Doesn't happen all the time. Thank you 90hoo for the 500 bits. I made you a gift

383
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:20,329
of pizza before you go deep rain. No that's not it. Pepperoni pizza. Yeah he almost got me there.

384
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:31,909
He kept saying the word pizza and pepperonis and stuff and then I almost left. What'd you do to my

385
01:15:31,909 --> 01:15:38,439
mouth? Why is my mouth so strange looking? Dobski dude thanks for the 250. I want to make a formal

386
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:43,560
apology. A week ago I tried contributing to the giant enemy spider meme but in the process I

387
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:48,920
accidentally brought the trick to you flog pyro joke back from the dead. It's already spiraling

388
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:54,840
out of control. Even Vinny is getting hit with the clip out of context. Now we have not one but two

389
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:03,000
five-year-old germa jokes running amok. Help one day chat can forgive me. Yeah this is rising of

390
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:16,899
the dead here. This is the second one. He probably just is like what the fuck is this? And that's it

391
01:16:16,899 --> 01:16:25,460
guys. I will see you on Tuesday. Again sorry for the abrupt short stream that just turned off

392
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:33,340
but you know you do what you gotta do and I gotta do this. Thank you all again so much for your

393
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:40,260
