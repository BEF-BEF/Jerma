Hey, what's happening everybody? Jerma here with something a little different today.

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:12,839
This is not my typical video that I would make, but I decided to do it because I got

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,320
approached by this company. They're a super cool bunch of guys over at DorkCube and it is

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,179
the DorkCube. Take a look at it. This is a monthly subscription box that comes in the mail

5
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:29,899
and you buy it, you open it, and there's all kinds of nerdy, geeky, epic, kind of funny

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,500
gamer culture type stuff inside and I thought I should get one and you should open it for you

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,579
and you know give these guys a shout. Give these guys a shout out and give you guys a shout out

8
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:44,469
and we'll give them a shout out. This is DorkCube. I don't know what's inside of it. I have no idea.

9
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,950
They sent it to me so we're going to see what's inside. A link will be in the description.

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:56,070
If you want 2% off your next order, it's $20. So save a little bit of cash, you know, save you guys

11
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,740
looking out for you guys. You know what I mean? All right, you know, let's make this let's make

12
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:05,480
this a little interesting. How about that? Right when the box opens, how about everybody writes

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,680
hashtag in the comments, LOOTGAP. You know what I mean? Like we got loot, you know, that's what

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,359
we'll do. So in the comments section below, right when this opens, everybody say LOOTGAP!
