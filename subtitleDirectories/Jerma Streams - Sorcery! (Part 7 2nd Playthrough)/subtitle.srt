1
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:33,340
Hey, Fred. Hey, Fred. Hey, Fred. What's up? How you doing? Welcome back. Hey, Bonnie. Well,

2
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:50,789
you said B-A-R-N. It's Bonnie. B-A-H. If you were going to be Fred replying. Hey, Bonnie. Yeah. I

3
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,090
just don't, I don't want to correct you in front of a hundred thousand people, but I'm going to.

4
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:08,870
All right. So today, last time we were live, last time I was live, it's me. Can you do a Gandalf

5
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:18,890
voice? I'm ready to do voices today. I'm ready to do some voices today. The, I was going to play

6
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:25,129
Final Fantasy 16 because I just want to play Final Fantasy 16, but we got really into Sorcery a couple

7
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:30,549
days ago and it's like, all right, I, we left on a cliffhanger. I can't just end it on a cliffhanger

8
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:36,870
like that and maybe not play it for like three weeks. Let's play Sorcery. We're going to chill

9
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:46,790
out. Audiobook Andy is here tonight. I'm going to read this story, go over some of the choices.

10
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,640
Why don't you relax? Why don't you get comfortable? We've got some work going on

11
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,000
on the second monitor. We've got something going on, something else, killing some time.

12
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:12,039
Or maybe it's time for you to go to sleep. Maybe you're, you know, could be in Europe.

13
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:20,150
I'd be late right now. Turn the volume down. And I really mean that because some of the sounds in

14
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:26,659
this game are loud. All right, so we'll pick up right where we left off. Not much else of an intro.

15
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:30,259
This is a three minute intro. This fastest intro. This is the fastest intro I've ever done.

16
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:45,740
Can we get a recap? Yeah, we'll get a recap. Honestly, we didn't really do that much.

17
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:57,719
We walked in a big circle and I lost a finger. I just did a huge circle, learned two clues about

18
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:04,099
different serpents and then lost a hand or whatever it was. You didn't even need to lose it.

19
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:10,699
Yeah, I know. I feel like I did the same thing last time too. You snorted the horn dust. Oh,

20
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:17,419
yeah, I forgot. I didn't even get out with the horn. Hey, remember you are bald also. Well, no,

21
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:24,539
I'm not. Okay, here's the thing. You can call me, oh my god, he can't even do puzzles. He's a fucking

22
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:29,979
idiot. Oh my god, he's 5'8". I'm taller than him. Oh my god, there's a lot of things that you can

23
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:36,060
say about me that are true. And it's like, whatever, that's fine. I have beautiful hair.

24
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:44,139
It's very healthy. It's, it's luscious. You don't have that on me. You just don't.

25
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:51,110
And I'm almost 40 years old. And this, I don't have a single gray fucking hair on my whole head.

26
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:59,300
It is wondrous what my hair is like. So you can, that's one of the things that I, you can call me,

27
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,610
you can say anything about me all you want. You don't touch the hair though, because it's healthy.

28
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,090
I'm going to wake up tomorrow and it's going to be receding. And it's going to be such a disaster.

29
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,730
I'm going to be like, oh, I'm going to be doing my, you know, washing my face. And I'll go,

30
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,050
I'm going to have just pulling clumps out or something. I know. I just going to stop talking

31
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:31,129
about it. I, my hair is very healthy. Every time I go get a haircut, they say the same thing. They

32
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:37,980
go, your hair is really healthy. And I always do the thing. I don't know. Does everybody else

33
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,939
do this? But I'm getting a haircut. I kind of be like, yeah, you know, it's thinning. It's thinning.

34
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:47,899
I try my best. You know, it's, it's, it's thinning. I know it's a, I'm losing it. And then they always

35
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:53,980
say the same thing. No, no. What are you talking about? It's, it looks fine. It looks good. It

36
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,829
looks healthy. Am I, am I just being lied to or does everybody do that? He's fishing for compliments.

37
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,470
Now I genuinely kind of feel, I don't know, because when my hair is really wet,

38
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,899
it's really obvious that it's receding. I'm also one of those people that never knows what haircut

39
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:21,959
they're getting. As a 37 year old, I'll sit down in that chair. Cause sometimes it's, it's a while

40
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:29,160
and it's like, what, what do you want to do? And I'm just like, ah, I don't know. I have no idea.

41
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,019
It's like, oh, do you want to take some off? No, I want to leave the length. Okay. Do you want to

42
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:45,800
take up some of the back or the sides? Yes. How much? Um, can you just, you just do it with

43
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,600
scissors first and then we'll figure it out. It's like, okay. And then it's always just with scissors

44
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:59,769
and I never go any further. Can you just trim? Why are you, why are you going? Cause you got to

45
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:03,370
clean it up. You can't just let your, even if you grow your hair out, those of you that have

46
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,110
grown your hair out long, you know, you've got to clean up the ends and shape it. So it grows out

47
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,750
and makes grows onto your head and makes it look, you can't just have it. You cannot just

48
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,430
let your hair grow completely wild without cleaning it up. If you want to have it, you know, fall on

49
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:29,579
your head and shoulders correctly. Is this a PR stunt? Me telling you that I've, I sit in the,

50
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:38,060
what do you mean PR? A PR stunt would be if I turn the face cam on right now and I was completely

51
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:48,339
bald with like a completely shaved with like a Gillette razor. And I started just ranting

52
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:55,800
about hair or something, but no, this is just me talking. Is that what's going to happen?

53
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:17,100
Shave your eyebrows off. No. Is he actually bald? Okay. I just said a brand name. That doesn't mean

54
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:30,040
I, I just was talking about the, I said, Oh, I said a brand's name. All right. Are you ready?

55
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:37,980
You guys ready to play? We, enough people trickled in. I know the sorcery streams aren't necessarily

56
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,699
for everybody, but they're for me. So I'm having a good time. And there you go. That's all I have to

57
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:54,009
say face cam. No, no face cam ever for sorcery. It takes the immersion out. You end up being able

58
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,810
to just the reason. Okay. Here's the reason why I don't want face cam on during sorcery streams

59
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:05,050
because you know, the behind the scenes videos of the actors reading the script in the studio

60
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:11,579
with all the soundproofing around the walls. Imagine if that was in the corner on every episode

61
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:18,360
of Spongebob. I don't, I think you'd be like, I, there's a, there's a guy in the corner.

62
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:27,750
I just, I want, I want Spongebob on the screen. That would be sick. Yeah. It'd be cool for a,

63
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:34,309
but like, but then it's not like Spongebob talking. It's, I have a live cam of the actor doing

64
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:40,309
Spongebob. Let's just use that as an example. It's just Spongebob is talking, but also Spongebob,

65
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:47,539
the actor is talking. You know what I mean? This is a bad take. I don't think it is.

66
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,350
I, I don't think this is a bad take. I mean, for a behind the scenes video,

67
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:59,509
that makes perfect sense to me. That's really cool. I love that stuff, but I don't want that

68
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:08,149
like on the episode. He's right. He's right. He's right. Yeah. Thank you. One guy, Spongebob,

69
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:27,450
the author, Spongebob, the author. Are you our Spongebob? No, that's, I'm not, I'm not,

70
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:36,389
I'm not, I'm not, no, I'm sorry. I ain't anybody's anything. Okay. Let's get that real clear.

71
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:55,299
You turned into Spongebob for you. You're doing Spongebob for PR right now. You rejected our,

72
00:09:55,299 --> 00:10:04,519
in quotes, not Spongebob in quotes. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, it's very, very, that was very clear.

73
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:12,809
This is the shortest intro I've ever done. Yeah. Well, whatever. Sorcery crew is here. And you

74
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:28,649
know, this is, we're good. This is the sorcery crew. I can be way more candid with the sorcery

75
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:32,169
crew. You know what I mean? Like I can be, I can talk to you guys. I can talk to you guys.

76
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:42,039
That's what you guys, you guys get it. Except almost 90% of the chat is contradicting everything

77
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:53,899
I'm saying. So maybe I can't trust the sorcery crew as much as I thought I could. Hmm. Are you

78
00:10:53,899 --> 00:11:07,750
high right now? No. Are you? Are you? All right. Here comes some wind. All right. So let's do a

79
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:17,259
recap. This is where we were. This is where we left off. Hello. Welcome back. So we are right

80
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:30,629
outside this looks like a some kind of dwelling. Let's go. Let's freaking go. It's a sorcery stream

81
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:36,730
of course. Well, whatever. That's a, that's between you. It's between you and God. And you know,

82
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:51,620
obviously the legality of the state or county that you're currently in. I was talking about,

83
00:11:51,620 --> 00:12:01,659
somebody said they were smoking weed. I'm not in the US. Can we get a recap? All right. So here's

84
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:10,250
a recap from a couple days ago. We started here. I went over, I went to the bridge. I actually,

85
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:17,340
actually where did we start? We started here. Okay. Yeah. So I went over the bridge. I climbed

86
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:25,539
down it. I fell off. I broke both of my legs. I got fixed. I went backwards. Tried to cross

87
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:32,340
the bridge normally. Lost a finger to the toll. Went up through here. Decided I could not go any

88
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,059
further. Went through here into this town. This town was pretty interesting. They told us about

89
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:45,129
a mine that was a tunnel that was essentially very dangerous. Went through that. Did not pick up any

90
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:52,070
of the items. Did not talk to the dog that was in here. But we made it out alive and with full

91
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:59,370
health, which is a huge deal. And four rations. Made it through here. Got to this point. We fought

92
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:11,480
a couple of Snatacats. But I lost a finger here. So we have made our way through. We went to the

93
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:21,139
forest of Snata. We did find this lake. I snorted a mushroom and passed out face first into the water

94
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:27,580
and had a bunch of hallucinations and a bat saved my life. That was pretty interesting. And then we

95
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:33,990
walked up here. Ended up in the north side of the forest of Snata. Leading us to here. Which this is

96
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:43,909
sort of some kind of house or hut in the woods. And we can go knock on the door. Remember,

97
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:52,259
recap. We are trying to hunt down the seven Serpents. We do not get rid of the seven Serpents

98
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:58,889
if we don't stop them. They will tell the Archmage that we are coming. We don't want that to be a

99
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:07,850
thing. We want to stop the seven Serpents with our various quests. And when we do those quests,

100
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:15,659
we will complete those quests. It'll be good to go to episode four. You mean six? Yes, that's

101
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:23,590
right. Six are dead. No, six are alive. Wait, what are you asking? One is dead. Six are alive.

102
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:32,360
Let's go knock on the door. Okay. The door is made of heavy wood carved with various runes and

103
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:41,960
symbols in a language you do not know. Do I just open this? Oh yeah. Mind your volume tonight.

104
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:50,340
The like, yeah, see it's a little loud in some places, but one of the spells to open any door

105
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,820
is stop opens locks and doors. The door might just be open. This might be a waste of time. I

106
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:01,379
have a lot of stamina. I could throw a grenade at the door. Wait, what? Didn't I get a pebble?

107
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:20,740
What happened to my pebble? I got pebbles. It was too hot. You dropped it. What? Oh, it was.

108
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:28,620
I could see. Oh, I could read minds. All right. I wonder if I can put, because I have, if I put

109
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:39,539
the skull cap on and see if I can read somebody's mind. I mean, it doesn't cost any stamina. I could

110
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:47,100
just do it. Let's see. You turn the stars into shape around you, pulling on the cloth skull cap

111
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:53,190
as the magic takes hold, but you are alone. So there are no thoughts to hear. What if I just

112
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:58,659
open the door? You tried the door. It is not locked. A dark passageway is revealed. All right.

113
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:04,139
So we would just open the door. I probably should have knocked, but we're already here.

114
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:12,100
The door opens through a short, dark hallway, descends into the hill. This is a tomb. You begin

115
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:23,590
to see a glowing light ahead and hear a voice muttering low, angry curses. Make a move. A little

116
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:35,460
sunshine falls through the doorway. There's still time to turn back. We're just going in. You keep

117
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,500
moving forwards and the passage quickly opens up. You enter a small room lit by a single candle on

118
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,019
a wooden table. Seated at the table is a spindly creature whose attention is focused on a glass

119
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:58,779
orb set on a plinth. We should take that. Let's watch. Oh, I think I remember this.

120
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,400
You watch as the creature stares into their orb, which swirls with colors and shapes.

121
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:14,660
It mumbles something quietly. Announce myself. You open your mouth to announce yourself,

122
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:20,660
but the silence is broken by a squeaky voice. Yes, yes, yes. All right. Don't stare like a half

123
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:35,579
orc. I'm busy. Sit down. Thin finger gestures towards a chair in the corner. What can I even

124
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:47,859
do here? I could do nap cause sleepiness. I don't have pendulum. Uh, that's it. I could read minds

125
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:55,900
in here. This is going to be weird. Me holding like two fingers up, like, uh, X-Men style.

126
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:11,049
This also is, what's L? This is law. Law is controlled, non-intelligent creatures.

127
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:16,569
I feel like this, this, I feel like there's intelligence here though.

128
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:33,299
Mud. Oh, we just, I could make quicksand. I have sand. Do I just make a just giant

129
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:39,690
death trap in the middle of this person's house? Why would you do that though?

130
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:50,920
I don't know. Oh, this could be a sorceress. It could be a sorcerer. I don't know.

131
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,299
Let's talk. I'll sit down. Sit. You sit down as instructed. After a few minutes,

132
00:18:55,299 --> 00:19:07,059
the creature leans back from her orb and looks up at you. So a visitor, a human too. Greetings.

133
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:13,210
Greetings to you indeed. As the light from the glass orb fades a little, you see this speaker

134
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:24,710
is a woman, some kind of elf, though she appears somewhat disfigured. What is your name? Finestra.

135
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:31,160
Now human, as my time is more precious than yours, I will soon lose my patience with you.

136
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,460
What in Gred's name are you doing in this miserable fortress? Forest is not a fortress

137
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:47,319
anywhere to be found. That's in Mampang. Uh, I don't think you just, I don't think you put

138
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:57,640
all your cards on the table. I'm looking for seven serpents. Uh, I'm going to Lake Iklala.

139
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,500
I'm going to Lake Iklala. You tell her, cautious not to reveal your true purpose to this stranger.

140
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:11,019
She nods. It can be hard to cross the lake. There's only one ferryman and he is old now.

141
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:22,950
I have a whistle which you may use to summon him if you wish. Thank you. It's not free. I will charge

142
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:37,190
you five gold pieces. I don't have that much. Shake my head. Just, no. Trey Pang 2 released?

143
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:48,339
What the fuck? Oh, cool. I'll play it. Uh, let's haggle. I will give you three. Okay, very well then.

144
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:55,289
Agreed. You hand over the money and she places the whistle into your hand. How does it work?

145
00:20:55,289 --> 00:21:02,390
You put it up to your lips and blow. There is nothing magic about it. It's just a whistle.

146
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:13,430
If the ferryman is about, and he is most mornings, then he will hear you and come. You stash the

147
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:20,119
whistle away without further comment. The orb on her table swirls with color ever more violently.

148
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:28,819
Benestra sits up sharply. You must go. I have work that must be attended to. What do you see

149
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:41,259
in the orb? You ask. See for yourself. Pointing into the glass. Shapes swirl inside the crystal.

150
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:54,980
Should I look into the orb or don't look? Look into the orb. You peer into the orb and then your

151
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:04,220
jaw begins to drop. For inside the glass is a winged serpent. It is the Sun Serpent. The one

152
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:10,390
called Flanker helped me to trap it. I lured it down from the skies using a rain spell and offered

153
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:18,890
it shelter. But the Sun Serpent cannot tolerate water of course. And then he trapped it. I know

154
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:30,789
Flanker. I know Flanker well. This poor creature despises him. Don't you? She taps on the glass

155
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:41,589
and the serpent lunges uselessly against the glass in reply. Why not kill it? The Sun Serpent

156
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:48,420
is the mate of the Water Serpent. They have a doomed, impossible love. It is enough for me

157
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:59,960
to lure the beast. And when it comes, I will kill them both. But the creature might escape.

158
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:09,319
We must destroy it for good. Be warned, Annalander. This serpent will reach into your mind and control

159
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:21,589
your will if you allow it. It would do anything to be free. I gotta smash it. Smash it. Take it.

160
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:42,970
Smash it. Look into it. What can I do here? Zap. Boom! Out of the finger. Same joke. Same joke. Same

161
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:51,430
joke. From 2016. Same joke. From 2016. Are we going same joke, Andy? Is that what we're doing?

162
00:23:51,430 --> 00:24:08,339
Like eight years later? No. I'm going to, I'm going to read her mind. You place the skull cap

163
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:11,779
on your head as if you craft the spell. You hear the serpent's thoughts enter your mind.

164
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:20,470
It is swirling in anger around cursing Fenestra and you. Oh, I can't get the fuck out of here.

165
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:33,420
Okay. I don't know what to, what's the, I don't know what the, there's no right answer in this

166
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:44,660
game, but I wonder what the path of least problems is. If I look into it, will he like control me?

167
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:51,579
Take it. Take the orb. There's no way this orb can hold the creature and should it escape,

168
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:58,039
your mission will be revealed. The orb must come with me. The fate of the land is at stake.

169
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:08,869
You may take it and return for two promises. No. First, that you will destroy this orb and

170
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:13,980
the snake inside in such a fashion that they cannot return. Know that breaking the glass

171
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:22,200
will set it free. So be sure you do not do that. I shall drop it into a canyon.

172
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:31,660
That sounds like a good plan. I will bury it. I shall drop it into a lake. And what is the second

173
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:40,200
thing? You nod understanding. The second thing is more important. Find the water serpent in Lake

174
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:47,339
Lala and do not leave it alive and do not die in the attempt to kill it. Will you do that for me?

175
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:59,579
I shall do my best. I shall. Wow. Oh no. I shall. You vow. Then with a nod, she steps aside and

176
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:05,849
lets you take the orb with the trapped serpent inside. It will not serve you for the casting of

177
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:15,480
far. The serpent will not allow it. I have an orb of my own already. You too. I have an orb of my

178
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:23,240
own already too. Well then we both own orbs. Yes we do. Then I'm going to put the strange orb carefully

179
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:33,880
into my pack. You turn on your heel and leave the underground room. So let me get this burn into

180
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:43,240
memory here. I can't break this. If I break this it will come out and that's bad. There is a serpent

181
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:53,380
in the glass cube. I need to make sure I destroy it. The water serpent and the sun serpent know

182
00:26:53,380 --> 00:27:08,970
each other very well. So we have to destroy it somehow. Okay. You got it. Well let's head there

183
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:18,970
now. Yeah I think we- here's the plan. Ready? Streamer's Choice. Streamer Vito coming in here.

184
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:25,299
We're going to go down here. Stop by whatever this little hut is. And by the way get Elden Ringed.

185
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:35,930
For those of you that just got here. Yeah. You get a problem? All right so I'm going to go this way.

186
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:44,869
I'm going to go down. Cringe. Is the story in Sorcery the same every time? It is. The- the A

187
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:57,140
and the Z are always exactly the same. And honestly so is- so is like the LMNOP is usually

188
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:03,559
kind of the same like throughout as well. But everything else is kind of your- on your own.

189
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:09,980
But I mean well it really depends. Everybody's goal is exactly the same. You're the Annalander.

190
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,380
You're trying to go get the Crown of Kings that was stolen from you and the Crown of Kings is

191
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,900
the Infinity Gauntlet. It's like the god power. It literally makes you unstoppable. You're unbeatable.

192
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:28,839
And the Archmage has it. The Archmage is evil. You're back in the sunshine of the clearing.

193
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:35,619
You feel the serpent in your bag and angry as it senses the heat and light around. You have the

194
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:42,420
sense that things are watching you from the trees. It's time to move. All right so I want to go down

195
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:49,779
because going back wrapping around left is not a good idea. So we're going to go this way. A wide

196
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:55,420
track leads away from the door into the trees. And here we go. So we're going to stop here.

197
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:02,359
See what this is. The goal is to eventually before Stream ends today to go get the Water Serpent.

198
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:08,789
And you're probably asking yourself bro it's like right here. Yeah okay yep it is right there. See

199
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:16,180
you in like four hours because it's good. That's how long it's going to take us to get over there.

200
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:29,480
The heckin Infinity Gauntlet? Yep. I just spilled all over me. Hold on a second. Okay if I got like

201
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:36,250
a huge replica Infinity Gauntlet and just like put it on and turned the cam full cam and just

202
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:41,750
started just played the like Avengers theme song. How long do you think we could keep that up?

203
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:48,380
Where I was like yeah no it's like holding it up into the camera and stuff. How long do you think

204
00:29:48,380 --> 00:30:01,000
that could go on for? Do you think more than 10 minutes straight of that would be unfair before

205
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,109
a DMCA? Before you laugh 10 seconds? No no no no I would get in character. You guys there okay there's

206
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:14,059
two different ways that I operate on Stream. There's like I'm into this and I'm dedicating

207
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:20,599
into my mind. I'm an actor and I am I will you can't break me. You never will. But then there's

208
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:32,339
I'm just hanging out and I laugh in five seconds. Which one of them will it be? I mean if I treat it

209
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:38,839
like it's a you know like a character or something then it should be easy. It's gonna be so hard though.

210
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:49,109
You have to be committed. What's this worth to you guys? That's what I want to know.

211
00:30:49,829 --> 00:31:03,109
What is a 10 straight minute Infinity Gauntlet pog stream worth to you? And no laughing. I can't

212
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:07,910
make any sounds. I have to just be excited and going over all the stones and what they do and

213
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:12,150
shit and like aiming it at that camera and like holding it up and doing like the two fingers like

214
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:17,740
I'm gonna snap and stuff. Was it worth you? Because that's it that is 10 straight minutes

215
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:23,349
of embarrassing myself in front of millions of potential people. What's it worth? You should

216
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:39,180
paint yourself purple. I'd rather you don't do that. Yeah put up a paid poll for bits. He

217
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:50,220
he's gonna do it or he won't do it. What's it worth to you? That's actually kind of funny.

218
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,220
I would pay to have you not do that. I would pay to have you do that. Have like a fucking money

219
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:04,460
fight to have the 40 year old clown either put on the Infinity Gauntlet or not. What a strange time

220
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,579
we live in. Don't you think? I think these are very strange times. These are very interesting times.

221
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:22,539
It's very odd. All right let's keep going. No no no don't actually do it. Don't actually do it.

222
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:29,750
Did you actually do it? Okay yeah I don't I don't no we're not doing that. I'm saying it's

223
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:45,099
really funny but okay it's just a regular poll okay. Somebody okay if I do a paid version somebody

224
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:51,029
is just gonna be like you know what? I got a lot of fucking money in my account and I'm making sure

225
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:57,990
this motherfucker does not do that. There'll be one like thousand dollar drop or something

226
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:07,559
to just ruin everything. That's why I don't want to do it. Please change your wallpaper. I like that

227
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:16,250
wallpaper. It reminds me of going to the beach. It's a beach right? Yes it is. It reminds me of

228
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:25,799
going to the beach and I like the beach. I've been described as beachy. I've been described as beachy.

229
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:38,710
So I have like a beach aesthetic. I like the beach. I've been described as very beachy.

230
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:46,220
I've been described as enjoying the beach a lot is what I'm trying to say. The path winds

231
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:52,279
tortuously through the forest nightfall as you need to rest. The path passes by a heavy thicket

232
00:33:52,279 --> 00:34:02,789
of tangled branches. Let's investigate it. The dense bushes curl up around themselves in a tangle

233
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:07,900
but in the darkness you can make out nothing more. I think this is good it's night time we should

234
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:14,090
sleep. The thicket will make a good shelter. You clamor into a hollow between its roots and lie

235
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:19,050
down. Laying your pack down by the roots of a tree you try to rest despite the strange noises

236
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:27,400
that float across the landscape. At least you have eaten already today. Then we're good. The

237
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:39,179
stream runs tortuously through the Thanos rant. You got I I really do wonder because the amount

238
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:45,190
of people that would pay to make sure I ended up in cringe compilations. Do you know what I mean?

239
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:50,699
Like there are there's some of you here that that's worth a lot of money to you to make sure that

240
00:34:50,699 --> 00:35:01,059
that happens. You know like I know that's what you'd be doing it for. You don't need to pay to see

241
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:17,300
that. Are you already in them? Nah you already are there. No what? Stop. Do we live rent free

242
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:29,239
in your head? Not really. I mean during streams yeah and maybe like maybe sometimes. I feel like

243
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:33,960
by the very nature of being a live streamer I'm constantly thinking about like the stream and

244
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:41,860
stuff. All right I'll think about it. I'll think about it. Maybe I don't know maybe I'll just put

245
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,500
it to charity or something. That'd be it's easy way to do that right? I don't it's like a better

246
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:55,000
way to do it probably. I don't know. We'll see. I'll think about it. Charity incentive war to have

247
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:07,079
me do it or not do it. The easiest way to do it is to never do it. Actually true and that is that is

248
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:20,760
a that chat comment is just like you get it. You get it. But I'm sorry I don't. I guess I'll never

249
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:45,110
learn. That's what makes me the cool streamer. I did that to specifically get into a cringe

250
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:51,159
compilation so let's go. All right your eyes close and you let your tiredness overtake you.

251
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:59,429
You wake suddenly. There's a flapping of dark wings from overhead. A giant bat is circling above

252
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:13,559
you. Your journey has been plagued by these creatures. What can I do? Let's see. You should

253
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:26,949
title that stream to cringe or not to cringe? That is the question. Oh man and I'm dressed up in a

254
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:43,369
Shakespeare outfit. Uh there's obviously danger. Pep is strength. I think I'm just fight. I don't

255
00:37:43,369 --> 00:38:01,000
want to waste any stamina. Let's fight. This bat has a lot of attack power. This guy is the CCO of

256
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:15,219
off-brand. I just came up with an incredibly engaging live stream event right now. Are you

257
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:21,130
trying to tell me that that was not that's not what just happened? Just tell me that's wrong.

258
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:27,300
I'm going full blast. All right it's actually good that I did.

259
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:42,730
Have Ludwig do it. No it has to be me. Although I kind of like that too though.

260
00:38:47,820 --> 00:39:01,719
Uh I'm going to defend. Yep. Uh I'm going all in. Sorry. I would I would read these but it's pretty

261
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:13,269
you can read them. It's just kind of like you swung and hit them. Okay what about all the Avengers

262
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:20,070
or different streamers and during the all the costumes are on the ground and we are over the

263
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:28,489
course of the next 45 minutes going to get into these costumes and like if there's enough money

264
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:35,500
that's telling us to no to not do it then we don't do it and if there's enough that that says yes

265
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:48,389
then we continue to put it on over then after 45 minutes we end it and see where it is. Could have

266
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:57,429
gone fallen. Would you say what would the point what would be the point of that just to see you

267
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:06,019
guys in costumes? No because once we get yeah what is the point of this? The point is to get

268
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:11,699
in the costumes and be and just and do like Avengers scenes and because people hate it

269
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:26,500
fairly. Fuck I thought he was going to go low. Avengers hot dove stream. It's going to be the

270
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:33,659
Hulk and they just get into the water and they're just green paint just starts coming off. All right

271
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:44,969
this little bat is fucking me up. I gotta pay attention. Stop defending when you're being good

272
00:40:44,969 --> 00:40:50,730
at the game and it's annoying. I could have done it again. All right I gotta all right all right

273
00:40:51,289 --> 00:41:06,119
that's a that's a fun idea. I'll add it to the to the notepad. Here we go. Only one? Okay creatures

274
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:13,769
eyes are fixed on you. There comes a big one. I'm getting I'm getting absolutely destroyed right now.

275
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:19,500
This is ridiculous. There's no way he's going more than 3.0 and he's not. All right I gotta go

276
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:25,530
all in. There's no way he's gonna go out. No he's not. Yes he is. Oh my god I'm just getting outplayed.

277
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:43,300
Oh my god fuck you. Why this bat? I I I fought like I fought a gigantic like Chimera and I beat it

278
00:41:43,300 --> 00:42:01,130
easier than the single bat. What the fuck? What? Fucking die. Yes all right. How much did I lose?

279
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:16,250
12 health. Whatever. The creature falls from the sky dead. You lost some gold. Entered the

280
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:22,090
Vishalami Marsh and you collected the sun serpent meaning there are now only five serpents remaining.

281
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:32,179
And we have to make like an original song and put like different memes from all the Avengers

282
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:39,380
characters. Like you know sing about like a Thanos is gonna snap you and shit. It's something fucking

283
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:47,619
awful. You know what I'm saying? An original song that we all have to sing in unison.

284
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,170
It's it hurts. I'm just trying to figure out how to get the most money.

285
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:14,550
Only if you paint yourself purple. All right I'm I'm stuck on this and I need to get off of it.

286
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:24,869
Well I've what I said for charity. This is not most money for me. I said this would be a charity

287
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:32,340
stream. That's the best way to do it. This is guys this is not happening. I just puke out random

288
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,019
bullshit sometimes. This is not happening. We're not doing this. This is not a thing we're doing

289
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:43,429
tomorrow. Let's say that's how you reel them in right? Now they want they want it to happen.

290
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:49,960
Hey yeah you and me get it right? We know. Okay all right I let we're playing we're playing we're

291
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:55,929
playing again. The bush is a thick tangle peering between the branches. You can make out something

292
00:43:55,929 --> 00:44:06,699
covered over. Oh I have the axe. You hew the branches away with the axe in swift easy strokes.

293
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:14,019
The foliage falls away to reveal first a glassless window and then the top corner of a door. It seems

294
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:36,550
the branches are growing in front of and out of an ancient hut. Go in the window? Did you? Yeah I

295
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:40,619
took 10 damage from the bat. I'm gonna cut free. Cut free the door. You keep cutting until you have

296
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:46,889
uncovered the door enough that you might be able to pull it open. Let me look in here first. Before

297
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:51,659
going inside you think to peer in through the window. You can make a little out through the

298
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:57,639
thick foliage that continues inside. When it seems the hut is otherwise empty then for a moment

299
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:11,929
something seems to move. But looking again you see nothing. Could be a genetic health. I'm gonna go

300
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:19,449
in. I would say I had a lot of health but I have a lot of food. You heave on the door hauling it open

301
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:24,570
ancient dust spills out into the forest air and a million crawling things scuttle from holes all

302
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:34,059
over the ancient wood. Smell the air. The air from inside the hut is an old and stale air but it does

303
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:42,389
not stink of death decay or animal. You look about for where to go. Are we going in or am I running

304
00:45:42,389 --> 00:46:01,050
by? Go in? Going. When are you going to drink the grimace milkshake? I don't know. When I go to

305
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:08,980
McDonald's I'll make sure to get one. Okay. You push your way inside the ancient overgrown hut.

306
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:13,539
There are patches of yellow moss. Much like the one you tried earlier. Growing on the back of a

307
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:22,599
wall. Oh really? This is edible. You gather up a handful of moss. It is much like the last bunch

308
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:29,590
you ate. Eat it. There we go. You chew through the moss. Feeling much better for it. All right I'm

309
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:41,429
gonna I'm gonna do suss. What do we got? Definitely there's suss. There's also sap. Cause depression.

310
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:47,300
Also by the way for those of you that have never played this game. If you sap and there's nobody

311
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,579
to sap. It happens to you. You literally cast it on yourself because it attaches to the first

312
00:46:52,579 --> 00:47:02,869
living thing in the room. So I don't think I want to do that right now. You can do sun. I have a sun

313
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:16,599
jewel and it's free. Just brighten it up. See the future. I can use the crystal ball here. The

314
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:30,570
crystal ball is useful. Sense danger. I'll do I'll do the meme. Cast suss. Craft the enchantment and

315
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:38,550
a steady voice begins to speak to you. It informs you quite calmly. The hut is not empty. Goodbye.

316
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:50,389
Okay. Something here. Let's look around. In the thin sunlight through the windows of the hut,

317
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:57,659
you can make out writing on the far wall. This is the house Elisey built and in its doorway

318
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:06,659
blood was spilled but that blood has dried and gone and poor Elisey is still alone.

319
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:18,460
Hmm. Look at the doorway. Looking at the doorway you see the dark shadow of a bloodstain

320
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:25,210
wiped carefully around the sill like a ward against an evil spirit. Not that such magic

321
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:31,539
works of course. The only true magic comes from the stars. At least that's what they told you.

322
00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:41,690
There are a few more things scratched into the wood. What does it say? You look at the other

323
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:48,329
scratched marks. They're they are hard to comprehend precisely. One appears to depict a person in a

324
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:55,530
circular bubble floating harmlessly above a raging tornado or a whirlpool. Another shows a fiery

325
00:48:55,530 --> 00:49:01,369
ball. Perhaps the sun. Perhaps not. Being drenched by a fist squeezing what looks like a handful of

326
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:19,139
berries. Interesting. So we got floating which is the float spell. Raging tornado is I think

327
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:29,750
with the horn right? It causes like a windstorm. Fiery ball that's hot potentially and drenched

328
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:36,949
by a handful of berries. Let me see. Looking into the dim corners of the hut you uncover an

329
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:43,429
old vial of water. As you lift it to the light it gives off a very faint shine. In your mind

330
00:49:44,489 --> 00:50:14,280
you feel the ape's gentle voice. Watery this vial is blessed to the god Gred. Gred. Do I take this?

331
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:26,300
I'm I think if I take this and I drink it the ape is gone and we might get a new god. We might get

332
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:37,079
the god Gred. I'll keep it. I'll keep it. You place the vial of holy water into your pack.

333
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:46,420
A lucky find. Oh all right so let me just what do we got here? There's some obviously some puzzle

334
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:51,780
here or some secret to do. One of them was floating. This is see the future. I can't do

335
00:50:51,780 --> 00:51:01,340
floating. I could just cause depression. What is it? What is this? Doc is heal disease. I need a

336
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:18,179
medicinal potion. I could do sap but who would I even do it to? I think I'm missing information.

337
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:30,420
I'm gonna look into the future. You settle into a sitting position by the roots of a tree and take

338
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,519
out the orb of a crystal. Reaching up to the constellations overhead you create the spell.

339
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:40,489
You're somewhere new. The world seems to disappear replaced by a vision. A ring of tall shadowy

340
00:51:40,489 --> 00:51:45,909
stones in a desolate waste. You stand by their center holding above your head a long yellow

341
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:51,719
feather taken from some colossal bird. You are casting a spell of curious power. I did this

342
00:51:51,719 --> 00:52:03,880
before. Should I drop it? Dude you should use phar to see if you do the cringe avengers stream.

343
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:19,349
I'm gonna drop it. As the spell builds you panic and release the feather. Slowly it flutters to the

344
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:24,789
ground but as it does so the spell of this strange place takes hold. The feather erupts into vivid

345
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:31,530
flame and you shield your eyes. It fades. The day is likely to be clear and will be hot once more.

346
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:38,570
Did I just do that to get the weather forecast? The day is likely to be clear will there be hot

347
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:51,000
later in the afternoon. Showers coming in tomorrow evening. Okay I don't think I can do anything here.

348
00:52:51,239 --> 00:53:02,920
You know what I'm just gonna cause depression. Why not? Sap. You gather the constellations into

349
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,750
order around you and immediately feel yourself losing your energy and drive. With no other

350
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:15,820
creature nearby the magic is turned on you. Oh great. What the hell is it? I'm missing an item.

351
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:28,019
I can't do it I don't think. It's probably dock. Yeah it has to. It's either dock or damn it.

352
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:39,559
I can't. I can't do it. I gotta go. Go back outside. Can't do it. Damn it. I couldn't solve

353
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:49,719
the riddle of the hut. There is nothing more to be done here. You leave the hut behind. Okay well

354
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:54,820
I wanted to go over here. Oh I can't go over there. That's like a hundred that's like 300

355
00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:11,449
feet in the air. I need this to be fixed. Let me see what happens if I go down here. You walk on

356
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:16,469
between the trees as the sun climbs towards its zenith. The winds pick up. A large ancient tree

357
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:24,820
has fallen down across the path. I'm the trunk for review. You clamor up onto the trunk and look off

358
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:29,780
into the distance of the trees. To the east the mountains rise tall and cold and to the south

359
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:39,829
you see the forest pool. A soft plop echoes from the tree trunk. You leave your pack on the tree

360
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:46,199
trunk and move carefully along its length. Eyes peeled for what it was making that sound. Suddenly

361
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:57,579
of its own accord your pack topples from the trunk and onto the ground. Somebody invisible? Pick it

362
00:54:57,579 --> 00:55:02,489
up. You return to your pack and reach down to pick it up and something bashes you backwards.

363
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:10,329
Fresh blood springs into your arm. You have been scratched by deep claws but you can still see

364
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:28,489
nothing. God damn it it's a snatacat. Let's talk with animals. All right we're doing yap.

365
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:32,489
Grabbing the wig from your pack you put it on and weave your spell. The faint growls in the

366
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:38,840
trees slowly begin to slur, turning into distinct words. The creature appears to be talking to

367
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:50,659
itself. Side open. Stay down. Stay low. I can hear you, you call back, speaking in the creature's

368
00:55:50,659 --> 00:55:57,940
language of growls and whines. Stay where you are. It tries to fool me but it can't.

369
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:07,110
Being invisible has clearly driven this creature quite insane. Leave or I will skin you. What are

370
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:18,070
you? It wants to know what I am. It wants to know what eats it. It wants to know what eats it. It

371
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:26,150
wants to know who. Leave or I will skin you. This is your only warning. The creature seems to consider

372
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:32,409
for quite a moment. Then it launches itself forward. Suddenly long gashes appear on your

373
00:56:32,409 --> 00:56:37,050
arm as claws that you cannot see seem to rake your flesh. For a moment you feel hot breath

374
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:49,239
on your cheek. Then it's gone. You could have casted sun in the hut. I thought all I had was

375
00:56:49,239 --> 00:57:11,500
um I could. It wasn't just sap and sus. Really? Really? Really? Really? Like really? Really?

376
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:28,630
Really? Really? I'm going back. That's one out of three. That's all right. Okay look at the doorway.

377
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:39,139
Look at the scratches. Search the corners. Yep they take the vial. Okay cast a spell.

378
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:55,940
Oh you weren't full of shit. All right let's cast sun. You craft the enchantment until the sun jewel

379
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:05,610
starts to glow with a magical white glow. Nothing. Nothing. Didn't do anything. It just looks cool.

380
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:19,530
Remember why do your tags say thinking about beans? I don't think they do. Huh maybe combine

381
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:37,300
with a different one. You have to sleep in here. Really? It does. Thinking about beans. I don't know.

382
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:47,820
I didn't do it. All right see what happens. God damn it. I think I have to come back here.

383
00:58:47,820 --> 00:59:03,579
All right well now. All right it didn't work. Your tags are fucked up. It doesn't matter.

384
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:11,099
Okay soft plop move. I'm not fighting anything. You rise quickly and gather your things listening

385
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:16,539
carefully for any suspicious sounds and you catch one a soft deep growl a few feet away.

386
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:26,730
So just run. I'm just gonna run. You waste no more time and scurry away between the trees. Okay

387
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:45,369
here we are again. I need to move this to the right. I wonder is there a way down here. I could

388
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:53,610
go down here and see if I can get across somehow. We haven't gone down here at all. I haven't seen

389
00:59:53,610 --> 01:00:03,349
any of this. I'm gonna turn this over here and see if I can do anything or maybe I'll turn it down

390
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:16,949
this way. I can swim. It's it's fine. I lost a fucking food. Your fragile possessions are ruined.

391
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:38,889
All your soft food has been ruined. What the fuck. It's all right. One food loss is fine. Yeah it's

392
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:50,710
fine. Okay I still can do this but I'm afraid to touch it. So what can I get up there if I go like

393
01:00:50,710 --> 01:01:05,639
this? Is that intact? I don't think it is. Is the bridge intact if I do that? It's hard to tell. I

394
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:18,650
don't think so. What about this way? Looks like it. I wonder if I can get. I'm talking about over

395
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:27,929
here though. It might be hard to actually do it. I have to activate another beacon I think. Yeah it

396
01:01:27,929 --> 01:01:38,579
gets kind of messed up on the left side. It's all right. I'll aim it this way. I don't want to aim

397
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:50,380
it all. This is a town over there. I'll aim it over here. That way or something. Oh so this is

398
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:58,329
the town in the past. This is the town now. It looks pretty much in ruins right now. What do you

399
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:11,179
think? Should I go to Tin Pang? Tin Pang in the in the past first? Yeah let's check out the past

400
01:02:11,179 --> 01:02:29,050
first. So that'll be fine. Now I could just go down. This is another beacon so I'll go like this

401
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:36,300
and we'll explore Klattaback. Klattabang? Klattaback? All right I'm going down. I'm going to eat.

402
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:54,969
Somebody said eat food before you lose it. That's a good idea. Let's eat a cooked meat. Make a move.

403
01:02:54,969 --> 01:03:03,579
Get the ring please I beg you. I don't know how to get it because if I break the branch it falls

404
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:08,039
down. If it falls down it falls into the water and if it falls into the water I can't get it.

405
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:12,949
If it falls down in the water I can make the beam go over there but I did that and I can't get it.

406
01:03:12,949 --> 01:03:26,340
I don't know. It's tricky. Maybe the other tower? Point it at the other tower. Just take it off the

407
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:33,960
branch when it's smaller. The ring doesn't necessarily fall in the water. If you go into

408
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:52,099
the past the tree won't be grown by then. Hey. You know. Hold on. Can I concentrate this beam

409
01:03:52,099 --> 01:04:02,739
that way? Because if I can concentrate that this way then this can go in the past. Come back here

410
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:11,210
when the ring is. Yeah. Maybe it'll reach. One of these will do it so I'll leave it. All right so

411
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:34,650
we're gonna head down here. I got this pointing over at that of the town. Let's make a move. Wait

412
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:41,829
I have to swim across again? I can't just like bury my face through the trees? God damn it. Okay

413
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:58,119
well whatever. I'm good. Your videos on this game got me through a day where I was throwing up every

414
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:05,079
half hour. Well that sounds awful. Okay. Things flutter in the trees all around. Hope you feel

415
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:11,909
better. Wait that was like eight years ago. Hope you felt better eight years ago. Things flutter

416
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:16,070
in the trees all around. The sun is all but gone. Soon it will be dark. A movement in the bushes

417
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:23,320
catches your eyes. A glimpse of red and a snake's body. This is the red snake that we've seen a few

418
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:34,099
times. I might be getting I might be being watched. Let's go. Let's investigate it. Why not? The snake

419
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:41,940
disappears before you can catch it. God damn. Do I want to go up and around or should I just go

420
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:50,550
straight down? I'll just go straight down. Easier that way. The path winds torturously through the

421
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:55,880
forest. Darkness closes in. You should try to find a suitable spot to sleep. Underfoot the earth has

422
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:03,179
been churned to mud and you notice the branches either side of this route are broken. Let's look

423
01:06:03,179 --> 01:06:10,199
at the mud. You pause to check the mud. Sure enough you quickly find a sign. A paw print at least

424
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:14,739
twice the size of your palm. Yeah there's a snat of cats everywhere. We need to go through this

425
01:06:14,739 --> 01:06:19,929
quickly. We gotta we gotta go. You keep moving hoping that whatever lives around here doesn't

426
01:06:19,929 --> 01:06:27,880
find you. Snat of cats are everywhere here. They're very dangerous. We don't have time to

427
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,940
investigate every branch that falls. You walk on between the trees in the darkness you can see

428
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:42,659
nothing through the curling branches. Almost out of it. Are they invisible? They are invisible.

429
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:46,820
You trace what might be a path and might be an old river through the trees of the forest.

430
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:52,170
The moon sets. More stars appear. You've reached the edge of the forest. Through the trees you

431
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:58,869
can see the level steps extending into the night. Now might be a good time to rest before

432
01:06:58,869 --> 01:07:06,230
you go much further. I really don't want to do it here but I need to sleep. Removing your pack by

433
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:12,760
the roots of a tree you try to settle despite the cold. At least you have eaten well already.

434
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:17,460
You lie back and try to forget your troubles. You wake halfway through the night at the sound

435
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:27,610
of breathing from between the trees. Snat of cat. What if I stay still? You stay quite still.

436
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:38,650
Something is sniffing the air. It is a wolf. Padding closer. It's a wolf. Maybe I could talk

437
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:59,989
to the wolf. Tell. Read minds. Wrap. Talk all languages. Raz. Sharpen blade. There's always zap.

438
01:07:59,989 --> 01:08:07,860
Always. That's my entire first playthrough of the game. Pep is strength. There's also pop which is

439
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:18,329
grenade but I don't have a pebble. Let's see if we can talk. Talk all languages. Grabbing the

440
01:08:18,329 --> 01:08:22,489
wig from your pack you put it on and weave your spell but this spell is intended for translating

441
01:08:22,489 --> 01:08:39,560
non-human speech and not the utterances of beasts and animals. Come here talk to me. Oh okay. Yeah

442
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:48,569
rap is talk all languages. Yap is talk to animals. Okay well why can I not do yap? I just don't feel

443
01:08:48,569 --> 01:09:08,170
like it. Just zap this fucker. Zap. You gather the constellations into order around you building up

444
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:15,819
a charge of electrical energy around your palm. Fire the bolt into the sky. This would be scary

445
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:27,180
right? Into the sky? All right I'm going into the sky. You fire the lightning bolt up into the air

446
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:33,909
and the flash cracks the heavens. The wolf squeals in fear and turning on the spot it bolts away into

447
01:09:33,909 --> 01:09:48,710
the night. The silence of the trees returns but I have alerted every single person in this five

448
01:09:48,710 --> 01:10:05,100
mile radius of my existence. You wake with your head on a tree root and the smell of fresh dew

449
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:13,289
in your nostrils. Time to choose a direction. There maybe is something to be said about going

450
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:20,579
up this way and investigating whatever this is but hey that's for you to do in your playthrough.

451
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:37,670
I'm getting out of the sonata forest. It's too dangerous. Jeremy can you ask my mom to get me

452
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:44,220
the grimace shake? I don't I don't know I'm not your parent. I'm not it's not like oh hey let me

453
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:57,130
go ask the streamer to can hey ma streamer said I can. You head out across the steps the air stirs

454
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:03,560
a little still cold but fresh. In front of you stretches another plane more rock than dust this

455
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:09,350
time and built of layers and layers of stone stacked like scattered papers. These are the

456
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:16,140
clatterback steps said to be the home of strange half human half asymian creatures. As you walk you

457
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:21,500
see a strange sight a village of listing huts in the middle of open space with no walls or defenses

458
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:31,909
at all. Ugly villagers lope from tent to tent dressed in animal skins. The men and women are

459
01:11:31,909 --> 01:11:36,949
strong and lanky dressed in animal skins by the gate two creatures stand with hefty wooden clubs

460
01:11:36,949 --> 01:11:49,560
clatter men. What can I do? Mods please link him the grimace shake on TikTok. You don't need to give

461
01:11:49,560 --> 01:12:05,850
me the I know what the grimace shake is. I can go invisible. Invisible? There's also big I could grow

462
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:20,659
in size to be huge. I could say what's safe passage here. I could cause stench but I don't

463
01:12:20,659 --> 01:12:35,380
have a nose plug. I could also summon a giant. I could just walk in there with a giant and be like

464
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:42,170
hey me and my giant friend. How many of these I think I only have two or three of these left right?

465
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:54,340
Invisible might be interesting. I'll let you guys decide. Here's the choices you have you have

466
01:12:54,340 --> 01:13:02,229
literally 60 seconds. Invisibility, summon a giant, or become a giant. Which one? Those are your

467
01:13:02,229 --> 01:13:15,420
choices. You get 60 seconds. Summon giant, become giant, or what was the last one? Oh wait what was

468
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:22,439
it? Oh I forget it. Why do I forget it? Invisible right okay. Invisible, summon giant, become giant.

469
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:51,220
Those are three very interesting routes to take. Don't be a coward. Don't be a coward. Can you play

470
01:13:51,220 --> 01:14:02,789
the grimace game boy color game on stream? Maybe one day. All right what's it what's it look like?

471
01:14:02,789 --> 01:14:15,939
It's still close. Become giant and invisibility. It's kind of trending in one direction but I think

472
01:14:15,939 --> 01:14:34,039
we have our answer. Become giant is the winner. All right big. Grow in size. You cast a spell

473
01:14:34,039 --> 01:14:39,000
inflating to more than twice your usual height. It's actually it's not a giant it's just like

474
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,579
you're kind of bigger. A path a path leads into the village or you could skirt past it. Why did

475
01:14:46,579 --> 01:14:54,090
I do this? I just got taller? You approach the guards. The guards are clearly impressed by your

476
01:14:54,090 --> 01:15:01,029
size. They stand quickly aside and let you enter the village without question. You flick one over

477
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:12,199
as you pass. What? Oh this guy's impressive. Okay you step into the center of the village. Gradually

478
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:21,100
you shrink back down to your normal size. Is that bad? So I walk in the front door and they're like

479
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:33,739
yeah bro step right this way. Is that bad? Okay large hut. One hut is much larger than the others.

480
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:39,739
Above its door is a sign depicting a picture of an owl and a hammer. It is amazing anyone here can

481
01:15:39,739 --> 01:15:49,130
draw let alone perform crafts. From inside you can hear the sound of hammering. Look through the

482
01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:55,590
window. Peering in through the window you see a clatter man working away at a bench. He moves with

483
01:15:55,590 --> 01:16:01,750
unusual delicacy for these creatures. His long thin fingers carefully adjusting the position

484
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:11,020
of whatever it is he's working on. You can't help noticing he has an unusually large skull. Okay

485
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:19,500
well let's go in. The clatter man looks up as you enter. He puts down the tiny hammer and pincers he

486
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:26,409
has been using to repair a piece of fine jewelry and tilts his head to regard you and greet him.

487
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:35,770
You greet him with a nod. He seems to understand this and nods in reply. He's in his workbench.

488
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:40,569
You step forward and look over his workbench and he gestures with an open palm to let you look.

489
01:16:40,569 --> 01:16:45,859
The clatter man has a variety of fine tools, pincers, all spikes for scratching and etching,

490
01:16:45,859 --> 01:16:52,229
even a vice. He's clearly a master craftsman despite his species. When you are finished he

491
01:16:52,229 --> 01:17:11,380
steps forward to you gesturing for your pack. Pack? Show him my pack. You hold out your pack

492
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:15,220
to him. He begins to rummage through investigating everything with his long supple hands and

493
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:20,500
occasionally pausing to scratch his bulging skull as though his brain is itching at the sight of

494
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:25,670
your gear. Then he digs around under his bench before finally pulling a long metal shaft and

495
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:31,670
a hooked metal grip. He pushes the two together screwing and clamping with a strange hooked tool.

496
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:36,310
After a short while he produces what appears to be a well-weighted long sword and hands it to you.

497
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:49,510
All right I got him. I'll pay him. You pull out your purse to pay the clatter man. He seems more

498
01:17:49,510 --> 01:18:00,739
interested in the operation of the drawstring at the top of the pouch than the money. Really?

499
01:18:00,739 --> 01:18:12,260
Take the sword? You accept the sword with some suspicion. Uh I just get a free sword? Let's see

500
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:17,579
ask him what he's doing. You try to ask him what he's doing but he ignores the sounds coming from

501
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:21,500
your mouth as if they were just the banging and ringing of his tools. Seems like he is carving

502
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:27,350
jewelry from colored stones. They do not seem to be precious or even beautiful but the weird

503
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:34,819
twisted shapes he is carving are complex and intricate and remarkably precise. Can I take one?

504
01:18:34,819 --> 01:18:44,069
Take a piece. You reach out to take one of the pieces a bejeweled item of clear value but he

505
01:18:44,069 --> 01:18:48,949
responds much more quickly than you expect snatching up a strange two-handed contraption.

506
01:18:48,949 --> 01:18:53,029
He opens the handle and the device expands a series of criss-cross bars. At the far end is

507
01:18:53,029 --> 01:19:01,619
a blade which skewers you through the shoulder pinning you to the wall. Holy shit. Uh oh. He

508
01:19:01,619 --> 01:19:06,579
tilts his head the other way and to make his point wiggles the contraption making your shoulder

509
01:19:06,579 --> 01:19:12,810
bleed. Uh oh. You try to spread your arms to collect the starlight for a spell but the clatter

510
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:20,659
man simply twists the contraption. You howl in pain and cease your attempt at enchantment.

511
01:19:20,659 --> 01:19:28,390
Release me! You demand. The craftsman listens with interest but does not retract the extended arm.

512
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:34,569
I'm sorry. I didn't mean I didn't mean to go for the jewels. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please

513
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:42,579
take me with you. Take me with you. Uh I can't cast a spell. He's got me like pinned by the

514
01:19:42,579 --> 01:19:47,750
fucking shoulder blades with this like weird device that's sticking through my shoulder.

515
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:54,250
I beg of you please please please release me please appealing to all the gods and the spirits

516
01:19:54,250 --> 01:20:00,340
you can name. The craftsman appears to respond when the name of Herm the cloud god is mentioned

517
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:04,760
and slackens his grip on the contraption enough that you are able to push it free

518
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:11,369
and stagger clear. Not taking your eyes off the dangerous creature you move backwards towards the

519
01:20:11,369 --> 01:20:22,949
doorway then hurry out of the low hut. Jesus. I feel like I don't I feel like I probably should

520
01:20:22,949 --> 01:20:30,840
leave now. By the fire you head over to the fire pit but it is unlit during the day and there is

521
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:36,699
no one here. Stop and eat. Taking one of your smoked fish from your pack you fill your empty

522
01:20:36,699 --> 01:20:43,880
stomach. You look around the village once more. I guess I could I could be here I could come here

523
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:53,909
at night. I did get a sword yeah well let me see the sword. A plus two long sword oh

524
01:20:57,050 --> 01:21:11,210
all right I think that gives me plus two to all of my swings that's huge. He gave you a sword and

525
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:23,220
you tried to steal from him. Well I was gonna pay. Hey I tried to pay. Remember I was like here take

526
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:29,460
all these I want to pay you I have coins. I guess that doesn't mean hey dude just like put your hand

527
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:35,909
into the fucking like pasta sauce. That's not how it works. Oh no no I have money I have money I'm

528
01:21:35,909 --> 01:21:39,590
gonna put my hand in the pasta sauce and just take pasta out of it. Yeah that's like give you a

529
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:47,609
fucking hand out of here. Don't touch my what are you doing? All right I'm gonna get out of here

530
01:21:47,609 --> 01:21:54,810
before I cause it any more trouble slip away. The village has no walls you slip between two huts

531
01:21:54,810 --> 01:22:07,020
and back out into the plains. Let's check out over here. You march onwards ascending and descending

532
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:12,460
as the ground breaks and changes level. As the morning moves on the wind begins to rise. A small

533
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:20,699
patch of flowers grows here just by a small rock. Ooh flowers. You smell the flowers they emit a rich

534
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:25,960
thick smell that makes you feel somewhat giddy. Still you feel somewhat better for it.

535
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:40,149
Smell the flowers again. Uh smell the flowers again. You take another long sniff of the flowers.

536
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:44,710
The scent is so strong that it makes your gaze turn briefly red and blotchy.

537
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:58,659
Oh all this guy does is do weird organic drugs. Smell them again. You lie down on the ground and

538
01:22:58,659 --> 01:23:03,699
bury your nose deep into the flower patch and sniff. The effect of the smell is not as powerful

539
01:23:03,699 --> 01:23:10,569
now as though the effect is wearing off. All right all right let's get out of here. You continue to

540
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:26,979
walk. More? No I don't want to do more. That's dangerous. Sunflower update. I am pleased to

541
01:23:26,979 --> 01:23:37,619
announce our biggest sunflower has officially opened and we did we have one two three four

542
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:45,739
there are five sunflowers this year and we did one of those loot boxes where we don't we didn't

543
01:23:45,739 --> 01:23:50,840
know what the colors were going to be because it was a kind of a mix of the sunflowers could

544
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:57,130
be like red or orange or brown or purple or there's a ton of different combinations. I'm pleased to

545
01:23:57,130 --> 01:24:13,369
report color of the main sunflower the big one is a pale yellow with a big brown ring in the middle

546
01:24:13,369 --> 01:24:19,859
it's a beautiful pattern it's pale yellow with a brown ring around the center of kind of where the

547
01:24:19,859 --> 01:24:30,180
petals are going out it's a brown almost painted ring around the middle it is gorgeous picture

548
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:38,180
hold on the pictures are coming but the thing with the sunflower I want to make sure it's fully

549
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:45,350
opened and has time to breathe so you get a really good picture just opened as of today

550
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:58,970
still don't know what the colors of the other ones are though do it after the ad break

551
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:14,439
all right let's keep going rule of third andy you'll see one is grimace purple might be can

552
01:25:14,439 --> 01:25:22,869
you play as an ad please um okay I will play I'll play an ad if you can get more than 95 percent

553
01:25:22,869 --> 01:25:28,819
that says yes on a pole you can just start it now that's been not it has to be over 95 percent

554
01:25:28,819 --> 01:25:36,250
that's been 96 percent or higher all right you walk on climbing slightly across the dusty steps

555
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:42,600
the sun continues to climb the steep sky in the middle of the steps you come across a strange

556
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:50,199
site a wooden pole as high as a tree with nothing around it it has no knots handles or holds of any

557
01:25:50,199 --> 01:25:56,039
kind nothing except a level platform right at the top clumps of the yellow moss you saw before grow

558
01:25:56,039 --> 01:26:08,279
around the base of the pole I'll have way more of this let's get to full health look around you

559
01:26:08,279 --> 01:26:13,880
stop and look around but can't make much out across the contours of the plane you might be able to see

560
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:20,970
more from the top of the pole of course from somewhere nearby you hear singing bang on the

561
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:33,180
pole watch an ad is no you guys not even close I said it has to be at least 96 percent you're at

562
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:42,869
71 percent right now that's just not happening now I'm sorry I got I like apologize I'm sorry

563
01:26:42,869 --> 01:26:53,079
yeah 71 percent is it's yeah I can't show you an ad yeah it sucks like I'm fucking sorry

564
01:26:53,079 --> 01:27:00,760
maybe we'll try again later it's like really disappointing but it's all right all right

565
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:18,840
listen bang on the pole or cast a spell what can we do uh h oh wait I do have a gale horn

566
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:28,090
when did I get a gale horn like episode two how long have I had that for is that why I snorted the

567
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:38,010
other one I've had a gale horn this whole time you do big again big is pretty cheap it's only

568
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:49,060
one stamina so something's obviously buried here can't do doc you do sus just make sure that

569
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:57,720
yeah it's just us you look to the stars and craft the magic into a steady voice it begins to speak

570
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:06,760
to you the voice informs you that this is a pole or a priest of froth who is fasting and contemplating

571
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:21,479
the procession of the sun he's likely to be quite mad okay listen you concentrate and listen

572
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:27,670
there's definitely a voice singing somewhere close at hand but there's no one anywhere in sight the

573
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:33,560
pole is set into a slight rise into the ground and you can see in all directions an invisible

574
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:43,270
creature perhaps dust funnels across the empty plane bang on the pole on the spell's information

575
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:50,039
you unbelt your blade and wallop the pole with the weapon in its sheath the wood vibrates

576
01:28:51,319 --> 01:28:55,159
a moment later a shaggy face appears over the edge of the platform overhead

577
01:28:55,159 --> 01:29:06,090
who's that who's that yeah yeah he's doing the singing are you fasting you demand no I'm not

578
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:13,340
doing the fasting I'm only not doing the eating what I am doing is he's doing the singing he is

579
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:25,800
bawling every word his throat must be sore now hmm what can you see the future and past is one

580
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:32,380
joining is separating and ghosts walking back and forth none of us are quite when we believe

581
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:41,659
ourselves to be I have experienced this myself shut your face hole I don't sit up on this pole

582
01:29:41,659 --> 01:29:46,779
to learn what you muddlers can learn crawling around the ground with your full fat bellies

583
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:58,420
ah would you like some food I can give you some food he calls you something terrible in response

584
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:08,020
I was being generous do you suppose it's generous to torment people not doing the eating with food

585
01:30:08,899 --> 01:30:18,010
oh why do you think I'm up on this pole oh he's fasting holy shit that's actually awful

586
01:30:20,649 --> 01:30:25,689
hey you're fasting up there aren't you don't you want some food I have food that's just I'm

587
01:30:25,689 --> 01:30:32,170
just taunting this is taunting this is not okay this is actually bad all right I would like to

588
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:43,380
learn from you the man does not reply but leans away however a moment later a hand appears over

589
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:53,210
the side of the platform and something falls to earth is a medallion is that for me you're a

590
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:59,739
sorcerer aren't you come up I hope you're a sorcerer otherwise I can't get down again

591
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:09,979
oh okay I gotta take it you take a hold of the medallion nothing in particular happens

592
01:31:09,979 --> 01:31:21,859
come on then let's go you turn the medallion over in your hands it is a jewel studded and set loose

593
01:31:21,859 --> 01:31:28,279
on a chain it is probably worth something to the north mist rolls across the edge of the forest

594
01:31:28,279 --> 01:31:38,810
all right this is definitely a hover medallion or teleporting medallion zen hover in the air

595
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:53,300
require yeah okay so I can float up there yeah what else can I even do here I can take I can

596
01:31:53,300 --> 01:32:03,029
just like blow the fucking gale horn and cause a tornado on this dude that would be so fucked up

597
01:32:06,149 --> 01:32:14,970
well I'm gonna do zen the zen is how I mean this is they're teaching me to do zen you spin the

598
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:19,210
star light into a pattern around you and the medallion begins to glow as you rise gently up

599
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:27,399
into the air you are now floating off the ground float to the top of the pillar here we are up

600
01:32:27,399 --> 01:32:35,319
here with this guy the man shuffles aside to allow you to bob down while taking back the

601
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:43,750
jeweled medallion now he took it back so you are a sorcerer I thought so I might have been a thief

602
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:51,460
you might have never gotten your medallion back that's true oh my sight assures me I will not

603
01:32:51,460 --> 01:33:05,939
need it still I'd rather have it welcome to my little eerie what are you doing up here you demand

604
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:11,859
hi from the world I can see diagonally downwards onto the world I can see through the layers of

605
01:33:11,859 --> 01:33:20,069
curse that affect this land the whole place has unraveled like a poorly woven shoe yeah from up

606
01:33:20,069 --> 01:33:29,909
here I can see all right I'm at it float down I don't even have the medallion anymore I would

607
01:33:29,909 --> 01:33:40,600
just be jumping off and dying I don't have the medallion why would this is bait that would be so

608
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:51,159
fucked up to see no I want to talk to him do you know of the seven serpents you demand

609
01:33:54,170 --> 01:34:00,659
I see much from up here I know of the winged beast in their quest to devour you grind your

610
01:34:00,659 --> 01:34:08,199
bones to dust and then spit that dust into the cup of the king of aniline east of bottles to

611
01:34:08,199 --> 01:34:21,819
scratch underneath his loin cloth so do you like it up here the view is superb yeah I do not see

612
01:34:21,819 --> 01:34:28,739
how a view can be superb it is only looking after all after he speaks you feel a weight

613
01:34:28,739 --> 01:34:34,600
gather about your shoulders as you settle down onto the platform the way I was floating that

614
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:47,430
whole time the spell has worn off can you get me down from here where can I find the serpents

615
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:54,329
they are looking to find you anilander each is waiting for you some are hiding some are not

616
01:34:54,329 --> 01:34:59,369
one waits for you in the very depths of lake eclala he means to pick you off when you're at

617
01:34:59,369 --> 01:35:08,979
your weakest how can I find him you must encounter him I fear the only way would be to swim

618
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:18,550
until he senses your tiredness but that is a most foolish course can you tell me the serpent's

619
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:28,199
weaknesses these are most secret but some I think can be guessed at the time serpent cannot be

620
01:35:28,199 --> 01:35:35,239
defeated from the forest of the north the trees seem to part and a gigantic bird lifts into view

621
01:35:35,239 --> 01:35:45,800
its talons gleam in the sunlight he could get out of here bird yeah go away grab the platform

622
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:56,619
what do I do I think I'm gonna hold on okay I'm gonna grab the platform you grab the platform

623
01:35:56,619 --> 01:36:01,979
below more to stop yourself from falling off in surprise than anything else the bird approaches

624
01:36:01,979 --> 01:36:09,220
and swoops low the priest screams then a moment later he is gone and the bird is flapping gently

625
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:14,979
away you are alone there is nothing on the platform apart from a few stray spots of blood

626
01:36:14,979 --> 01:36:22,859
from where the winged creature's talons punctured the man's side and the jeweled medallion oh no

627
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:44,699
save him uh see the future oh no I I think I think we're I think he's I think he's gone

628
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:52,409
he's gone you can see him getting fucking eaten save him you're a monster say I can't

629
01:36:53,380 --> 01:37:05,750
all I can do is cast zen hover down what about hot no rewind no I think it's all right

630
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:19,539
I think it's all right I don't have the medallion yet I just leap off all right I'm taking the

631
01:37:19,539 --> 01:37:25,319
medallion this probably explains how we got up the pole in the first place okay I'm going let's

632
01:37:25,319 --> 01:37:33,220
okay rewind you monster can't rewind everything I can't I got some decisions have to be final

633
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:46,779
what do I sit on the pole the spell was free right sit on the pole you float down onto the

634
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:52,460
pole's platform and cross your legs to contemplate the sun a few meditative minutes go by and you

635
01:37:52,460 --> 01:38:00,229
feel cleansed and well rested oh time passes a moment later you feel a great weight settle

636
01:38:00,229 --> 01:38:04,390
about your shoulders it is your body weight returning your spell has evaporated and you're

637
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:10,920
now stuck at the top of this gigantic pole in the distance a dark speck appears above the forest

638
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:24,409
is the bird coming back for another like meal there's a wait wait and watch the dark spot

639
01:38:24,409 --> 01:38:29,210
resolves into a bird-like shape and swoops low a moment later you have been snatched up into the

640
01:38:29,210 --> 01:38:49,369
air by the sharp talons where are we going carried away great wings beat above you you wriggle and

641
01:38:49,369 --> 01:38:55,300
struggle but there's no safe way down below the steps transform into thick tangled forest

642
01:38:55,300 --> 01:39:03,909
we do have the ape what if I try to talk to the bird talk to the bird or pray to the ape climb

643
01:39:03,909 --> 01:39:16,949
the creature I like that one let me go you demand of the great bird hoping it perhaps can understand

644
01:39:16,949 --> 01:39:24,380
the common tongue even if it can't speak it and indeed perhaps it can the talons begin to slide

645
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:31,960
from your flesh and you are about to fall grab hold on wait you grab for the creature's feet

646
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:37,880
and it lashes back kicking you sharply in the face the talons retract and you are tumbling

647
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:51,020
you're tumbling downwards through the air towards the canopy why did I do that you plunge to earth

648
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:55,979
the trees breaking your fall miraculously you are largely unscathed by your ordeal

649
01:39:56,699 --> 01:40:05,619
get up you pause as a thin red colored snake slides across your path this fucking snake

650
01:40:05,619 --> 01:40:12,859
what if I play what if I play the flute imagine going through all what I just went through

651
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:22,310
and then being like no it's time to like you play a flute a few notes on the flute but it seems you

652
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:28,010
are no talented snake charmer the snake appears to be watching you but then it lowers its head

653
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:43,079
once more and begins to slither away down the path yep I can become a giant or I can summon

654
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:58,300
a giant rap talk all languages no it's a snake I'm gonna follow the snake you follow the snake

655
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:04,859
into the undergrowth for a moment you lose sight of the creature then a flash of red reassures you

656
01:41:04,859 --> 01:41:11,380
that you are still on its tail but the snake should be far ahead of you it is almost as if it

657
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:22,569
wants you to follow the snake reaches the foot of a tree and coils around the trunk okay as you watch

658
01:41:22,569 --> 01:41:27,850
the snake slithers quickly up the trunk a moment later its head drops down from a branch to stare

659
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:39,880
at you you approach the tree catching a glimpse of a thick red band in the branches and suddenly

660
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:52,229
the whole thing erupts into flame charge forward you charge forward convince the flame is an illusion

661
01:41:52,949 --> 01:41:58,789
it is not and you feel burning heat on your skin but just as soon as it began the fire goes out

662
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:05,590
leaving a badly charred tree looking up into the branches you see the red snake peering down at you

663
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:11,369
it has grown tenfold in size and two fiery wings are now folded across its back

664
01:42:11,369 --> 01:42:20,729
sly eyes watch your movements as if deciding its next attack you stare in shock and fear the blaze

665
01:42:20,729 --> 01:43:00,859
of hissing fiery must be the fire serpent sap i don't have the ring um stench speed i could go

666
01:43:00,859 --> 01:43:20,140
really super fast float in the air sap let me say something about the water i don't have like a

667
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:39,880
water spell fireball why would i do fire against fire wind i could just cause it out i'm gonna do

668
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:50,550
gale horn i'm blowing the horn and i'm causing a fucking tornado here tornado let's go oh boy

669
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:54,550
consulting the constellations above you bind the spell placing your gale horn to your lips and

670
01:43:54,550 --> 01:44:00,949
playing a clear tone a strong wind is summoned from the horn that blows down the serpent's fires

671
01:44:00,949 --> 01:44:07,189
it hisses in fury and frustration and falls from the tree to attack you but without its flames it

672
01:44:07,189 --> 01:44:17,819
is severely weakened dude how am i okay i gotta play well uh you've got much more attack power

673
01:44:17,819 --> 01:44:25,779
than i do i'm gonna hold off good thing all right now i can i gotta do some stamina management

674
01:44:26,659 --> 01:44:33,029
crash against your defense the creature coils its scaly body okay it's getting ready

675
01:44:33,029 --> 01:44:46,659
does that mean it's gonna attack i'm gonna go like 3.6 good good like stab cuts through the

676
01:44:46,659 --> 01:44:51,380
serpent scales the serpent is rearing back but you catch it as it retreats so it's rearing back

677
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:59,350
now i think i'm going all in yep good call what an unbelievable fucking sword play that was

678
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:06,180
your only hope is to keep up the attack you do not hold back laid high above your head the serpent

679
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:12,500
is rearing for you you drive your blade into its open jaw the serpent's fire flickers you'll die

680
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:21,079
i can do better than that you will die here fire licks the edges of the serpent's mouth

681
01:45:21,079 --> 01:45:35,180
i'm going again you will die here alone the creature's claws draw inwards all right it's

682
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:44,630
not going to attack but i think it has way more than i can yes 1.6 all right i have to defend i

683
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:51,479
need to build this back up you jab and step back the snake is clearly fearful moving back attempting

684
01:45:51,479 --> 01:45:57,560
only a minor attack a line of fire streaks along the length of the serpent it's gonna come all in

685
01:45:58,279 --> 01:46:06,310
good you draw back as the serpent arcs forward quickly sidestepping the creature

686
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:12,460
smashes into the bushes behind sending a wall of sparks snake eyes narrow and watch you

687
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:25,859
just did 4.4 i'm going all in all right uh he's got a ton of power now i'm gonna hold back the

688
01:46:25,859 --> 01:46:30,180
flames around the creature flicker a deep dark red the creature seems to flash with heat yep

689
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:38,869
here comes a big one kind of all right the creature flies a short distance into the air

690
01:46:38,869 --> 01:46:45,050
i think it's probably gonna defend the bat was harder than this dude uh i'm gonna defend twice

691
01:46:46,229 --> 01:46:54,859
shit that was a stupid idea now we both are gonna serpent lashes out quickly with the tip of its

692
01:46:54,859 --> 01:47:01,449
tail didn't dive in heat rises from the creature scales all right is it gonna be more than 6.7

693
01:47:01,449 --> 01:47:06,170
all in that's really unfortunate because that's horrible i just took four fucking damage

694
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:18,789
it's really unfortunate the serpent's fire grows dull after that all in again it's all right fire

695
01:47:18,789 --> 01:47:25,640
serpent rears back escaping the worst of the blow the creature shifts back a little i'm gonna

696
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:36,340
die fire creeps around the open jaws i don't have enough yep see but now i do okay creature turns

697
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:47,689
its fire okay turns let's do four four point five again all in five point three all in no i'm dead

698
01:47:48,329 --> 01:48:12,010
no shit oh that was risky that was risky oh damn it it's okay i got so unlucky then all right all

699
01:48:12,010 --> 01:48:23,960
right all right so i'm gonna go at four point four point oh good four point oh six point oh

700
01:48:25,979 --> 01:48:32,659
really good start serpents fire flickers the creature's claws draw inwards okay two point

701
01:48:32,659 --> 01:48:41,750
seven you're not going for an attack you draw any claws in oh shut up lost by all right i'm

702
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:49,930
being watched defend i didn't have one point six a line of fire streaks along the okay i think it's

703
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:57,699
coming in for an attack it's gonna be more than four yep all right now i have the advantage it's

704
01:48:57,699 --> 01:49:05,880
going in the air it's probably it's gonna do a little tail whip let's do four point eight okay

705
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:11,659
the fire grows dull all right i'm doing literally point eight no one point oh it's safe right one

706
01:49:11,659 --> 01:49:20,199
point two oh that's all right the creature flies in the air opening its jaws wide all right it's

707
01:49:20,199 --> 01:49:31,380
gonna be a huge one you only got like four or five after that flash with heat i think you're coming

708
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:43,100
in twice yep creature retreats a little into the trees all right all in again that's fine um i have

709
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:51,880
complete advantage defend okay i think a big one's coming in the fearsome serpent rears its full

710
01:49:51,880 --> 01:50:00,710
height up into the air oh yeah this should be a win right now it's gonna turn let's do like

711
01:50:00,710 --> 01:50:08,229
three point eight good one more of those all in heat rises from the creature scales all in

712
01:50:10,119 --> 01:50:22,859
dead is that panic you see in its eyes or murderous intent you risk another heavy cut the fire

713
01:50:22,859 --> 01:50:30,359
serpent's eyes turn coal black and it looks upon at you questioning helpless in the final second

714
01:50:30,359 --> 01:50:45,380
before it turns to a dark dead husk you step back wiping your brow sword heavy in your hand

715
01:50:46,409 --> 01:50:53,399
you have now defeated three of the seven serpents you need to rest and recover your

716
01:50:53,399 --> 01:51:11,720
search for the serpents is so far taking its toll you move on through the trees yay back

717
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:20,199
wait where are we right now that was interesting how that played out i fucked around here for

718
01:51:20,199 --> 01:51:28,899
too long my buddy got grabbed maybe killed and eaten i got grabbed i fought to get let go i drop

719
01:51:28,899 --> 01:51:36,520
right here snake is right here that's that was cool you gotta go get the water snake in the lake

720
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:46,199
yeah that's true i need to get over here all right the the game plan is still intact i wanted to go

721
01:51:46,760 --> 01:52:00,279
this way because i want to activate this beacon things scurry in the branches all around you

722
01:52:00,279 --> 01:52:05,619
clouds rumble as they roll across the darkening sky the path looks wide and well used but there

723
01:52:05,619 --> 01:52:12,310
are no signs of who or what uses it then a little further along you reach a spot where the trail is

724
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:24,390
suddenly narrower with bushes tight on either side let's take a look oh dear you pause to look

725
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:30,630
at the bush and see that its branches are twitching ever so slightly curling and uncurling like

726
01:52:30,630 --> 01:52:44,020
reaching fingers i don't think i want to walk through that squeeze forward is not the play

727
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:54,279
it's not the game plan i think i draw my sword and try to cut away at some stuff you draw your

728
01:52:54,279 --> 01:53:00,279
long sword warily the branches seem to curve back as though recoiling but surely it's simply

729
01:53:00,279 --> 01:53:03,960
the breeze i don't want to lose this sword if they grab it i think i'm just gonna i don't know i

730
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:17,899
think i'm turning around i'm gonna leave because i'm more of a punk kind of guy who listens to rock

731
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:25,430
wait what not someone who watches germa sorry i mean i'm kind of a punk rock guy i don't want

732
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:38,739
to be here all right that's i like that comment that's fucking funny oh i don't want to like

733
01:53:39,699 --> 01:53:49,000
okay you draw your i mean this is clearly dangerous i'm gonna go in here and it's

734
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:55,850
gonna hurt me for like eight damage i'm turning around i'm not doing this is this is very clearly

735
01:53:55,850 --> 01:54:05,180
that dangerous situation that i don't want to put myself in risk on i have to leave i'm kind of a

736
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:15,529
punk rock kind of guy don't just squeeze in there i'm sorry i'm going in you squeeze your way forward

737
01:54:15,529 --> 01:54:20,090
between two bushes which have overgrown the path only to find yourself quickly tangled in them

738
01:54:20,539 --> 01:54:26,060
it is lucky the sight masters cannot see this far it would be embarrassing if the sergeant could

739
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:34,119
see you now swing my sword you raise your long sword to hack away the branches they react faster

740
01:54:34,119 --> 01:54:40,779
this time long wooden tendrils whip out grasping your wrists your wrists and arms you cannot swing

741
01:54:40,779 --> 01:54:48,659
your sword now and meanwhile another tendril is looping itself around your neck maybe the

742
01:54:48,659 --> 01:54:55,220
ape can come and help us here i'm gonna pray to the ape you close your eyes and raise a prayer to

743
01:54:55,220 --> 01:55:04,170
the ape but nothing seems to change the bush keeps tightening its grip around your neck

744
01:55:04,170 --> 01:55:09,289
you look to the heavens to cast a spell but your arms are held fast by the strangle bush

745
01:55:09,289 --> 01:55:16,460
and so you cannot craft any magic the vice-like grip tightens it's beginning to pull your body

746
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:23,029
in two directions the grip of the strangle bush is turning to steel around your arms and neck

747
01:55:23,029 --> 01:55:23,829
you can barely

748
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:35,560
you struggle and thrash and then finally the ape comes to your aid as the moon rises brightly

749
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:41,319
and the bush turns involuntarily reaching upwards instead of towards you you waste no time in

750
01:55:41,319 --> 01:55:56,409
slipping clear you shiver wanted to leave this spot as fast as you can the ape i think it's funny

751
01:55:56,409 --> 01:56:04,729
because there's the ape and there's also the monkey right well there's a there's a few different

752
01:56:04,729 --> 01:56:09,829
apes and isn't the monkey like doesn't monkey laugh at you sometimes if bad things are happening

753
01:56:09,829 --> 01:56:19,960
to you i remember praying to the monkey and it was like the monkey uh you can hear the distant

754
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:29,720
laughs of like howling laughter as the monkey like watches you get like hurt all right i just

755
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:42,199
distinctly remember that happening okay well let's go ape has been really good to us though

756
01:56:42,199 --> 01:56:47,590
the path winds tortuously through the forest you still feel shaky from your encounter with

757
01:56:47,590 --> 01:56:55,380
the strangle bush i didn't even get hurt actually probably the best way to do that

758
01:56:55,380 --> 01:57:00,600
are you gonna play final fantasy 16 today um i thought about it but i think we're into this

759
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:07,140
right now i'd rather get to a good stopping point here i mean i'm not the stream's not

760
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:23,779
over i'm just saying that probably not lies of jay yep look the high council of the sorcery

761
01:57:23,779 --> 01:57:31,960
enjoyers have been waiting 296 days for this you know what i mean i think we we owe them a little

762
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:41,989
a little extra the path winds time to move you must find your way to the shore of lake eclala

763
01:57:41,989 --> 01:57:50,199
somehow it seems impossible and yet it must be a way the seers in aniland saw a path

764
01:57:50,199 --> 01:57:57,979
dangerous fickle but present you must find it i wonder what happens if you stay with the bird

765
01:57:57,979 --> 01:58:02,300
this is probably like a big bird's nest it's probably i wonder if he's here that like other

766
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:15,699
magician guy i'm almost out of food again all right you walk on between the trees another night

767
01:58:15,699 --> 01:58:25,659
begins you need to rest in the snata forest this is not good but whatever laying your pack down

768
01:58:25,659 --> 01:58:29,260
by the roots of a tree you try to stretch out despite the unsettling noises in the trees

769
01:58:30,619 --> 01:58:39,210
i have eaten today right yeah you stretch out and rest you dream you are trapped in a low straw hut

770
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:45,770
its door sealed with bolts made of bones a small fire is burning in one corner it quickly spreads

771
01:58:46,409 --> 01:58:51,560
until you are surrounded by flame you feel yourself starting to sweat from the heat

772
01:58:51,560 --> 01:59:05,159
and you wake up to find a ball of fire raging mere inches from you look at it jesus the fire

773
01:59:05,159 --> 01:59:11,079
does not seem to be fueled it is a ball about three feet wide gushing with smoke and steam

774
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:18,579
a moment later it unravels uncurling into a long animal form it is a fire fox and it's coming for

775
01:59:18,579 --> 01:59:37,819
your neck in a blaze of fur and fire sharpen blade this rock which is turned to stone

776
01:59:43,369 --> 01:59:53,460
fog summon darkness oh that's kind of cool i imagine when this bell gets cast

777
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:59,319
it plays the diablo 2 sound effect you know the one i'm talking about the one that goes

778
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:05,670
oh you know that one that like

779
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:31,050
when the darkness is summoned in act two the fox is made of light you dope i could like stink but

780
02:00:31,050 --> 02:00:49,699
i can't do it fire is not a good idea i'm summoning darkness i think it's fun or i could do a force

781
02:00:49,699 --> 02:00:56,180
no let's summon darkness let's just who cares fuck it let's go you move the stars into alignment

782
02:00:56,180 --> 02:01:02,819
around you in clouds of dark fog bill about from under clothing your clothing but they are quickly

783
02:01:02,819 --> 02:01:11,989
lost to the winds okay well i have to fight it uh we're going all in good idea three damage points

784
02:01:12,869 --> 02:01:19,829
all in again the fire fox paces the earth before you sparks a fire flashing across its fur driven

785
02:01:19,829 --> 02:01:26,460
by fear you charge headlong it snaps at you which your blow lands in a spurt of blood and fur

786
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:31,500
it limps back bleeding heavily dark blue flames gutter between clumps of ragged fur

787
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:44,579
all in again it's gonna be close uh i oh that was really painful you feel yourself weakening

788
02:01:44,579 --> 02:01:58,760
that's not good at all that's the worst thing that could happen yes get that sneaky 1.6 okay

820
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:56,300
what do you want you ask the clathamen look at you without expressions if they

821
02:07:56,380 --> 02:08:05,189
if they have understood you they gave no sign let me pass you demand they remove the wig in

822
02:08:05,189 --> 02:08:18,060
irritation i just think have this green wig on darn it whatever put my wig away i can't they

823
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:24,140
won't let me do big again they want they don't want me to do it again i guess i'm just gonna

824
02:08:24,140 --> 02:08:30,739
have to pay i'm gonna run out of money what about kid create an illusion requires a bracelet of bone

825
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:38,859
let's do it you move the stars into alignment around you and the bracelet at your wrist begins

826
02:08:38,859 --> 02:08:44,680
to glow you have just a moment in which to choose your illusion turn myself invisible turn myself

827
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:54,060
into a monster monster they like when i was big remember when i got huge they were like come on

828
02:08:54,060 --> 02:09:03,029
in you create the illusion that you are towering infernal beast but the clathamen barely react

829
02:09:03,029 --> 02:09:09,060
it seems they are too stupid to find you threatening what there's nothing you can do

830
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:20,710
but wait for the spell to fade and try something you hand over two gold pieces the clathamen

831
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:25,449
nearest to you seems to love the shininess and takes the coins the other stands aside to let

832
02:09:25,449 --> 02:09:31,050
you pass they do not speak but when motions towards a fire where an animal is roasting on a spit

833
02:09:31,050 --> 02:09:48,199
okay well you look around the weird houses by the fire you make your way to a space by the fire

834
02:09:48,199 --> 02:09:53,880
several clathamen and clathawomen are sprawled around singing songs that consist of barks and

835
02:09:53,880 --> 02:10:00,100
squawks and occasionally turning a roach pig of roach pig on a spit reminding you of the poachers

836
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:05,180
you met in kare one stands as you arrive slapping her chest and then her head in some kind of

837
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:10,979
greeting i'm not doing that i'm not doing that i don't know i don't know what that what i'm

838
02:10:10,979 --> 02:10:18,500
i don't know what i'm saying i don't know what that means i'm just gonna say hi greetings they

839
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:27,699
don't understand speech she slaps herself again i return the gesture return her gesture you reply

840
02:10:27,699 --> 02:10:33,420
with the same gesture and the clatham woman stares in amazement then falls about laughing

841
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:41,460
she repeats the gesture again what what am i doing all right repeat the gesture myself

842
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:47,029
you repeat the gesture again the clatham woman's eyes seem to all but pop out suddenly

843
02:10:47,029 --> 02:10:52,710
she leans forward and smiles strangely drawing up her lips and showing her teeth which she then

844
02:10:52,710 --> 02:10:58,250
begins to pick this continues for a moment but when nothing happens she stops in evident

845
02:10:58,250 --> 02:11:04,340
puzzlement perhaps she thought she was looking into a mirror one of the clatham and by the fire

846
02:11:04,340 --> 02:11:11,850
waves you over and tears off a leg of a pig i mean i haven't eaten you accept the roast meat which

847
02:11:11,850 --> 02:11:16,970
is almost raw and barely palatable another of the clatham and brings you a mug of tea like broth

848
02:11:16,970 --> 02:11:29,260
that accompanies the meat the way of running nose accompanies a feverish cold jesus uh okay eat

849
02:11:29,819 --> 02:11:36,090
more i should probably have i wonder if they might know something about the serpents i wonder ask

850
02:11:36,090 --> 02:11:44,329
about the serpents do you know of the seven serpents you ask one of the clatham and stiffens

851
02:11:44,329 --> 02:11:50,520
at the words perhaps he recognizes them or has heard them from someone else either way he begins

852
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:55,640
to point vigorously at the fire with one hand while with another he lifts a handful of dust

853
02:11:55,640 --> 02:12:00,739
from the ground and makes it as if to throw it on the flames you realize he is telling you the

854
02:12:00,739 --> 02:12:11,989
weakness of the fire serpent sand oh sure wish i knew this he's already dead this is where i take

855
02:12:11,989 --> 02:12:20,100
out like i just i pull out like the serpent's head i already got him he repeats this pattern

856
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:26,630
a few times before seeming to forget what he's doing and sitting back in silence let's have

857
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:32,329
another piece of pig you tear off another leg of pig and munch down on it the clatham and seem

858
02:12:32,329 --> 02:12:37,590
content presumably living so close to the forest they have a good supply of creatures to hunt

859
02:12:37,590 --> 02:12:46,619
suddenly there is a sound behind you followed by a hushed silence turning you see a well built

860
02:12:46,619 --> 02:12:53,449
clatham in taller and stronger than the rest approaching with unsteady gate before you can

861
02:12:53,449 --> 02:12:59,659
react he lifts you and tosses you across the fire to a patch of ground near the gate am i

862
02:12:59,659 --> 02:13:09,020
getting kicked out oh i thought they were throwing me out the arena the large clatham and stumbles

863
02:13:09,020 --> 02:13:19,300
after you growling loudly you cannot understand his meaning then he raises a large club oh uh

864
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:41,239
greetings is he is he coked up wait law control non-intelligent creatures this dud illusion of

865
02:13:41,239 --> 02:13:57,640
treasure there's sap i could cause depression gack which is fear i don't have the mask law

866
02:13:57,640 --> 02:14:07,939
is expensive but it would probably work do it you craft the spell and begin to attempt to take

867
02:14:07,939 --> 02:14:14,100
control of the clatham's mind spell only works on unintelligent creatures now you will find out if

868
02:14:14,100 --> 02:14:21,380
they are truly if they truly are unintelligent the clatham and raises his club to swing it down on

869
02:14:21,380 --> 02:14:31,699
your head i really hope you're stupid make him strike himself down you hold your nerve trusting

870
02:14:31,699 --> 02:14:40,140
to your spell the clatham's great biceps tense and then the club comes crashing down hitting

871
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:47,180
into the clatham's own groin his eyeballs twist about in their sockets like flowers turning towards

872
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:55,300
a sudden ray of sunshine then his face turns a deep shade of blue and he sinks into the he sinks

873
02:14:55,300 --> 02:15:04,409
to the dust he turned he turned blue by hitting himself in his his own balls okay the other

874
02:15:04,409 --> 02:15:10,890
clatham and around the fire nod appreciatively they seem to consider this a fair ordinary fight

875
02:15:10,890 --> 02:15:15,689
and you are the clear victor the other clatham and go and find their fallen champion one of the

876
02:15:15,689 --> 02:15:21,460
clatter women slaps you on the back making you cough and splutter another clatham and beckons

877
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:33,619
from outside a nearby tent his face is painted with strange spirals and markings okay let's go

878
02:15:36,949 --> 02:15:42,069
you head over to the beckoning clatham man from his tent you catch faint wisps of strange herbal

879
02:15:42,069 --> 02:15:53,220
smells get over here attack him uh let's greet you nod a greeting which he returns

880
02:15:53,779 --> 02:15:59,770
placing both hands on either side of your face then he begins to murmur a strange blessing

881
02:15:59,770 --> 02:16:07,300
you feel strength filtering deep into your bones his gift is a powerful one and deep when you

882
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:17,720
step back you feel stronger taller and more confident got a max health upgrade thank him

883
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:27,300
you bow and thanks he smiles and walks away from the fire any more serpents intrigued by

884
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:32,379
the clatham man's first clue you try and ask him about the serpents once more but he merely

885
02:16:32,379 --> 02:16:40,120
repeats the same performance try communicating further you look around for something to use to

886
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:48,899
communicate further point into the teacup point at my sword point into the teacup you point down

887
02:16:48,899 --> 02:16:55,590
into the water in a nearby teacup and the clatham and nods grabbing a handful of burning fat from

888
02:16:55,590 --> 02:17:01,399
the pig on the spit he tosses it into the cup the clatham and whose cup it was becomes enraged

889
02:17:01,399 --> 02:17:10,549
and the two begin beating each other around the head with rocks still perhaps it is a clue should

890
02:17:10,549 --> 02:17:22,729
you try something else i love these guys all right point at the ground you stamp on the ground one

891
02:17:22,729 --> 02:17:28,090
of the clatham women shakes her head perhaps they do not know how to defeat the earth serpent or

892
02:17:28,090 --> 02:17:34,069
perhaps they think you are asking if you can plant vegetables here it's impossible to tell

893
02:17:34,069 --> 02:17:43,739
one clatham it picks up a stone and then punches it is that a clue what about the sword my sword

894
02:17:43,739 --> 02:17:48,979
you indicate your sword and the clatham and nod to one another but it's unclear what they are saying

895
02:17:48,979 --> 02:17:55,000
perhaps they simply like swords enough of talking to these idiots it is like communicating with a

896
02:17:55,159 --> 02:18:04,329
trained dog what the fuck what about the forest what can you tell me of the forest of snata you

897
02:18:04,329 --> 02:18:10,469
ask the creatures look between one another blankly for all their human shape they do not seem to have

898
02:18:10,469 --> 02:18:17,459
a human thought in their heads you stand and take your leave of the fire okay i could probably get

899
02:18:17,459 --> 02:18:26,629
a night's sleep here though one corner of the camp is slung with hammocks what they are for is

900
02:18:26,629 --> 02:18:33,670
unclear as the clatham folk seem to have tents but a few creatures are asleep in them already

901
02:18:33,670 --> 02:18:38,389
you haul yourself up into one of the hammocks they're far from they are far too large for a

902
02:18:38,389 --> 02:18:43,030
normal human but this in fact makes it only more comfortable and ensures there's enough room for

903
02:18:43,030 --> 02:18:51,780
your pack i think i'm safer you stretch out and rest you seem left alone here and your night is

904
02:18:51,780 --> 02:19:00,040
untroubled by dreams during the past day you gained a little max stamina change to using the

905
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:06,340
long sword used one provision and some gold enter the steps and you collected the sun serpent and

906
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:16,780
the fire serpent meaning there are four still out there next morning i'm going to get a send

907
02:19:16,780 --> 02:19:23,659
off from the clatham in you wake after a peaceful night in one of the hammocks feeling much refreshed

908
02:19:23,659 --> 02:19:40,940
i think that's it appreciate it thanks for the help get out of here thanks a lot i have much

909
02:19:40,940 --> 02:19:50,260
respect for the clatham folk you should ever need anything do not hesitate to call there are no

910
02:19:50,260 --> 02:20:01,260
phones i've ruined everything all right let's go down you keep moving the ground dropping a little

911
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:07,399
there moves a little still icy but fresh to the southeast a huge mountaintop rises its peak

912
02:20:07,399 --> 02:20:15,700
dusted with snow it is the southern extent of the horns of iklala near its base is a carved shape

913
02:20:15,700 --> 02:20:23,379
a turreted tower built into the stone of the slope you march onwards all right we want to go here

914
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:34,059
you fall into a steady pace as you walk ascending and descending the moaning winds tug at your pack

915
02:20:34,059 --> 02:20:41,180
and sword the scrub land is broken quite suddenly by a small waist-high post to which is a nailed

916
02:20:41,180 --> 02:20:50,629
written notice you pause to read the sign the writing is crabby and difficult but you slowly

917
02:20:50,629 --> 02:21:00,440
decipher it stop traveler every wish can come true for this post marks the grave of the god

918
02:21:03,819 --> 02:21:23,780
call name close to see your eyes blessed forthwith call the name vinanga rose shift button is broken

919
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:36,489
uh let's go ahead and you know you know the one we're doing you cast sus the voice indicates

920
02:21:36,489 --> 02:21:46,819
that there is some danger here but it does not specify what it is be careful all right i don't

921
02:21:46,819 --> 02:22:02,860
know what happens if i do this should i say it i say vinanga vinanga you stand carefully by the

922
02:22:02,860 --> 02:22:08,790
post and call out vinanga to the empty air nothing seems to change there is no sense of danger or

923
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:18,340
blessing in the air wait i have to close my eyes you close your eyes as the note instructed

924
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:28,149
nothing happens you sense no danger vinanga you call out again but there is still no response

925
02:22:28,149 --> 02:22:39,190
then you feel something move under your feet wait you wait and then your stomach churns you are

926
02:22:39,190 --> 02:22:45,639
falling you tumble landing in the bottom of a conical sandpit that has opened beneath your

927
02:22:45,639 --> 02:23:05,930
feet the top of the post is now only just visible sticking out of the dirt at the bottom of the pit

928
02:23:05,930 --> 02:23:12,250
yes invisibility oh this is a good place for it too i'm so glad i picked up so many of these

929
02:23:12,250 --> 02:23:17,129
items in this first and second game there's something that you don't know uh you actually

930
02:23:17,129 --> 02:23:20,969
can do playthroughs of this game and not have any of these items and it like sucks because like

931
02:23:20,969 --> 02:23:27,340
fuck i want to do i want to do that i don't have the item let's do it let's go invisible i want

932
02:23:27,340 --> 02:23:37,770
let's see it doesn't cost any stamina slip on the pearl ring and cast the spell and slowly a filmy

933
02:23:37,770 --> 02:23:42,649
light extends from the jewel of the ring surrounding your body something stirs in the

934
02:23:42,649 --> 02:23:50,729
dirt underfoot let's dig you dig a little into the sand around the base of the pit after a few

935
02:23:50,729 --> 02:23:56,500
minutes you uncover the bottom of the pole and beneath it a chain this is part of some mechanical

936
02:23:56,500 --> 02:24:04,520
contraption a claw appears through the sand in the side of the pit are we just gonna are we is

937
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:19,270
this a way i'm gonna unclog the drain here pull on the chain oh shit okay you tug the chain and

938
02:24:19,350 --> 02:24:23,750
the floor of the pit shivers slightly but you're not strong enough to haul the post back

939
02:24:23,750 --> 02:24:28,920
the side of the pit collapses as a baby badu beetle emerges there's no time to do anything

940
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:38,250
but draw your sword this is this thing is stronger than a serpent yeah i don't even have 11 stamina

941
02:24:38,250 --> 02:24:47,850
11 power i have eight stiffens and rears up we're gonna go very small like 2.8 good okay that's

942
02:24:47,850 --> 02:24:55,540
clean you aim a blow for its bug eyes the badu beetle mid-lunge bends away from your blade the

943
02:24:55,540 --> 02:25:03,049
creature is losing its spines one by one all right we go again i think 4.2 good it's skillful

944
02:25:03,690 --> 02:25:10,680
okay green blood oozes from between the beetle scales its long claws stretch i think it's ready

945
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:20,120
to come in defend good call good call okay you fall over yourself trying to escape it's a reach

946
02:25:20,120 --> 02:25:30,379
it straightens up just i think i'm going straightens up all in stupid but i still got it

947
02:25:31,260 --> 02:25:38,440
you prepare your sword you swing hard the battle beetle leans aside avoiding most of the blow

948
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:46,250
okay probably coming in hard no all right that's fine we'll both do it you circle away from the

949
02:25:46,250 --> 02:25:51,659
battle beetle it circles the other way creatures vicious claws open and close i think that means

950
02:25:51,659 --> 02:25:59,219
like snap snap snap snap snap snap snap like i'm coming in yep all right now i have all the control

951
02:25:59,219 --> 02:26:07,459
here we're going in at like a two point we're going to like 2.5 it scuttles backwards it's okay

952
02:26:07,459 --> 02:26:13,139
that's all right now we're going it waggles its antenna tilting its head full blast

953
02:26:15,159 --> 02:26:23,450
i'm winning so it's okay this is fine battle beetle bugs the badu beetle bug stumbles and

954
02:26:23,450 --> 02:26:31,430
its jaws stretch wide in rage the thing's cruel claw claws grasp at the air i think it has a lot

955
02:26:31,430 --> 02:26:39,700
i'm gonna defend yep it waggles its spiny arms in a strange motion and stands erect for a moment

956
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:44,579
all right well we're going in it i have to go in you never know you never know it could have been

957
02:26:45,459 --> 02:26:53,940
honestly look at how much bigger the bar is you just got way more to work with scuttles forward

958
02:26:53,940 --> 02:27:04,920
and i could have probably no i couldn't it stiffens i think i'm going all in still winning

959
02:27:05,559 --> 02:27:15,319
defend all right that's fine i think coming in for as high lens begins to dig in the dirt all in

960
02:27:15,319 --> 02:27:27,129
nope defend it shifts sideways okay if he goes all in i'm in trouble i'm gonna defend again okay

961
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:39,930
uh its back legs throw up more sand it's coming in for a full like 12.0 oh my god do it already

962
02:27:39,930 --> 02:27:49,940
it stoops down endlessly patient it hurries a few steps back do it already i don't want to

963
02:27:49,940 --> 02:27:59,059
okay it rears up really a 2.3 you smart piece of shit because now you still have enough to

964
02:27:59,059 --> 02:28:05,850
beat me if i go all in i'm going i don't care oh my fucking god what a disaster

965
02:28:09,639 --> 02:28:23,799
oh my god a huge this is a this is awful this is really bad i got him that was so annoying

966
02:28:23,799 --> 02:28:33,219
outsmarted by a bug you rush forward and stab then your blade lands deep you cut again twist

967
02:28:33,219 --> 02:28:40,700
and the badu beetle collapses on the dust the beetle has died on its back you could scramble

968
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:48,649
up its body to get close to the edge of the pit let's look at the beetle first you look over the

969
02:28:48,649 --> 02:28:57,500
dead beetle around one leg is a small metal tag on which is inscribed the word benanga most curious

970
02:28:57,500 --> 02:29:03,690
benanga is the name of the beetle it's not a god or like a priest or it's literally the name of

971
02:29:03,690 --> 02:29:20,229
the beetle that somebody put here somebody was warning me stop traveler every wish can come true

972
02:29:20,229 --> 02:29:34,059
for this post marks the grave of the god benanga who put this here i'm climbing up the beetle's

973
02:29:34,059 --> 02:29:41,500
body you clamor onto the beetle's hind legs then scramble by leg by leg up the body to the edge

974
02:29:41,500 --> 02:29:46,709
of the pit the beetle's body shifts under your weight and you clamor out just in time as it

975
02:29:46,709 --> 02:29:53,510
slides down out of reach look into the pit the dead beetle's body lies in the bottom of the pit

976
02:29:53,510 --> 02:30:02,379
you leave the side of the pit you continue to walk okay well that was eventful uh let's go

977
02:30:02,379 --> 02:30:08,579
over here first i guess i want to turn this on actually no let's explore all this so then i can

978
02:30:08,579 --> 02:30:22,040
turn it to the past let's explore all of everything in the present first it's the best way to do it

979
02:30:22,040 --> 02:30:28,809
okay you march onwards climbing slightly the dewy light from your pearl ring fades and disappears

980
02:30:28,809 --> 02:30:44,329
but i was invisible that whole time how did i you smell me i was invisible you notice something

981
02:30:44,329 --> 02:30:53,459
white stark against the gray of the dust look at it it's just a sliver of cool white visible

982
02:30:53,459 --> 02:31:00,840
through the thin dusty scrub something is buried here clear the dust you wipe away the dust from

983
02:31:00,840 --> 02:31:09,079
the object it is short dirty white and gently curved take it up you dig around the object

984
02:31:09,079 --> 02:31:15,180
and find two similar objects to the left and right of it they lie parallel in the dirt keep

985
02:31:15,180 --> 02:31:22,659
going you squat down on your heels and dig in the dirt a little more eventually you uncover three

986
02:31:22,659 --> 02:31:29,420
short white rods and at that moment it becomes obvious that they are finger bones of a hand

987
02:31:29,420 --> 02:31:35,190
clenched into a fist the fist points upwards as though its owner had been buried standing

988
02:31:35,190 --> 02:31:45,020
upright in the soil keep digging you keep digging the fist gives way to a wrist and then an arm

989
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:50,629
it is as though the creature was trying to climb out when the soil of the land closed over its head

990
02:31:50,629 --> 02:31:57,739
as you go lower the bones start to accumulate a leathery coating at first you think that it

991
02:31:57,739 --> 02:32:04,440
is the remains of a coat but then once you locate an anchor and sail tattoo it becomes clear it is

992
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:16,170
skin somehow preserved in the soil you are now seriously digging which is hard work you pause

993
02:32:16,170 --> 02:32:20,809
to take a break every few minutes and stop once more and you have the figure on earth down to the

994
02:32:20,809 --> 02:32:29,559
waist its skull is a dried leather ball with two gray brown eyes shrunken in the sockets it wears

995
02:32:29,559 --> 02:32:35,180
a metal ring through its nose and the remains of a beard are just visible its jacket is better

996
02:32:35,180 --> 02:32:41,590
preserved its color faded but its buttons still intact it wears a small three-cornered hat

997
02:32:41,590 --> 02:32:47,659
sticking just above the waist are the remains of some kind of harness it is possible this figure

998
02:32:47,659 --> 02:33:02,969
had a false leg uh keep going oh it is hot now you're starting to sweat in your tunic you work

999
02:33:02,969 --> 02:33:09,299
harder still creating a deep pit and getting down as far as the figure's knees one leg is indeed

1000
02:33:09,299 --> 02:33:23,639
wooden the other trouser clad bone you have the ape yep we're good keep going the sun has reached

1001
02:33:23,639 --> 02:33:29,979
its highest point now out of the shade the air is baking hot you dig down to the figure's feet

1002
02:33:29,979 --> 02:33:37,510
so it is standing proud in a five-foot hole water begins to pool around your feet heat beats down

1003
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:43,879
from a cloudless sky the figure keels over face down against the dirt you've wasted a lot of time

1004
02:33:43,879 --> 02:33:53,479
on burying it but have discovered nothing search the figure you rival through the figure's jacket

1005
02:33:53,479 --> 02:34:01,030
but find nothing of interest in its pockets not even one gold piece take the hat you take the hat

1006
02:34:01,030 --> 02:34:08,360
from the creature's head but it is of little use it crumbles to dust in your hand more interesting

1007
02:34:08,360 --> 02:34:16,040
is what is left behind under the figure's thin covering of hair you can see a dry leathery scalp

1008
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:25,540
inked with another tattoo you examine the tattoo carefully it shows two long thick lines that come

1009
02:34:25,540 --> 02:34:34,729
together to form a v at the top another stroke crosses so the shape becomes an inverted a inside

1010
02:34:34,729 --> 02:34:43,079
the top of the a near the tip is a black x inside an o perhaps it's a map but if so it is surely

1011
02:34:43,079 --> 02:34:53,590
too vague to read rebury the body you begin to pull dirt back into the pit intending to rebury

1012
02:34:53,590 --> 02:35:00,309
the body suddenly the creature in the pit begins to shiver and shake it is moving arms reaching out

1013
02:35:00,309 --> 02:35:09,799
to grasp you how do you skewer it it's a skeleton ah through the bones it's not gonna hurt doesn't

1014
02:35:09,799 --> 02:35:19,719
do anything he's got a tattoo map on top of his head um i'm gonna watch you watch in horror as

1015
02:35:19,719 --> 02:35:25,719
the eyeless creature drags itself up from the pit to the edge and stumbles and clatters away westward

1016
02:35:25,719 --> 02:35:32,139
across the steps it disappears into the dust though after a short while you hear a clattering

1017
02:35:32,139 --> 02:35:40,020
sound most likely the sound of its bones falling to bits around it look in the pit the pit is now

1018
02:35:40,020 --> 02:35:45,459
half filled with sparkling gleaming water there must be an underground river that is feeding it

1019
02:35:45,459 --> 02:36:03,750
you move quickly away from this ghoulish place okay there's this kind of rundown building

1020
02:36:04,389 --> 02:36:12,260
because these stones are already up here or i can turn on the device this thing i would like to

1021
02:36:12,260 --> 02:36:21,430
explore first so let's go here we can turn this back later you walk on the ground dropping a

1022
02:36:21,430 --> 02:36:28,579
little the afternoon is starting drawn the sudden sound of voices to your right startles you look

1023
02:36:28,579 --> 02:36:38,969
around oh dear you spin around to see seven hooded shapes squatting on the ground playing some sort

1024
02:36:38,969 --> 02:36:52,250
of weird game chanting in a curious tongue listen to the chant you listen closely to the voices

1025
02:36:52,250 --> 02:37:01,399
then stiffen as you realize one is calling you by your name we have awaited you you've made good

1026
02:37:01,399 --> 02:37:15,379
time to us we are the seven spirits come join us you raise your eyes to the heavens but there's

1027
02:37:15,379 --> 02:37:23,610
nothing here strange you've heard rumors of spots where no stars at all are in alignment but you've

1028
02:37:23,610 --> 02:37:30,739
never found one before the figures beckon you towards them into the very center of this magical

1029
02:37:30,739 --> 02:37:41,540
darkness there's no stars in the sky here i don't know they seem kind of friendly seem approachable

1030
02:37:46,969 --> 02:37:53,959
warily you approach who are these creatures how do they know your name will they offer advice or

1031
02:37:53,959 --> 02:38:00,969
are they dangerous as their skull mask faces suggest the spirits rise from the ground as

1032
02:38:00,969 --> 02:38:06,409
you approach gliding silently through the air passing through one another as they mingle and

1033
02:38:06,409 --> 02:38:15,850
encircle you linking hands that's not this is where you run caution is understandable but fear

1034
02:38:15,850 --> 02:38:29,270
us not what are you these bodies are not our natural bodies merely shells we cannot touch you

1035
02:38:30,260 --> 02:38:41,979
we cannot harm you how can you help me we can give you knowledge the chant we know will protect you

1036
02:38:42,059 --> 02:38:56,069
from all harm show me your true forms tell me the chant oh yes the spirits begin to turn and dance

1037
02:38:56,069 --> 02:39:02,739
around you chanting in a whispering unison but you cannot understand the words repeat kissing

1038
02:39:02,739 --> 02:39:08,819
with us repeating words in a language you cannot understand is difficult you try but stumble over

1039
02:39:08,819 --> 02:39:18,229
the first few lines a bill mandible as they chant you begin to feel stars appearing in the sky above

1040
02:39:18,229 --> 02:39:39,020
you magic i can see stars now protect from magic that one works there's also zap i don't think

1041
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:54,459
that's gonna hurt anybody there's mud quicksand rap oh i can understand i can understand what

1042
02:39:54,459 --> 02:39:59,420
did that was like a super that was like a boston moment right there oh i can understand all

1043
02:39:59,420 --> 02:40:11,020
languages all right um well i can understand the spell now is what i'm saying that one's interesting

1044
02:40:12,569 --> 02:40:20,569
uh read minds is interesting let's get a couple of options for you guys to decide all right

1045
02:40:20,569 --> 02:40:30,229
rap which is talk all languages and understand all languages is mage which is protect from magic

1046
02:40:30,229 --> 02:40:43,579
mag and then there's also zap which is great lightning 60 second poll let's do what do you

1047
02:40:43,579 --> 02:40:56,889
want what do you feel like they feel like doing there's also some other stuff too there's i guess

1048
02:40:56,889 --> 02:41:05,620
tell is there but i think those are the most interesting yeah one is understanding one is

1049
02:41:05,620 --> 02:41:20,440
protection and what is just chaos so however you feel which one is reading minds tell although it

1050
02:41:20,440 --> 02:41:25,819
might not work because they might not be physically here the person has to be physically in your line

1051
02:41:25,819 --> 02:41:31,979
of sight for it to work and these are specters i don't know if that would work possible it might

1052
02:41:32,620 --> 02:41:43,879
all right what are we what are we thinking here is it rap it's overwhelming all right we're gonna do

1053
02:41:45,209 --> 02:41:58,440
talk all languages taking the wig from your pack you pull it onto your head and form your spell

1054
02:41:58,440 --> 02:42:01,879
suddenly the words of the chant resolve themselves into something you can understand

1055
02:42:03,989 --> 02:42:12,819
i call to be damned i offer a sign i call to be damned no idols are mine the words go round and

1056
02:42:12,819 --> 02:42:17,700
round over and over building in force with the wig on your head it is almost more than you can

1057
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:30,170
bear to listen they're gonna slurp the ape they're gonna slurp oh no he said usurp the ape like slurp

1059
02:42:36,200 --> 02:42:49,420
something horrible i think they're gonna slurp the ape up they're going to usurp us us usurp how do

1060
02:42:49,420 --> 02:42:59,319

1061
02:42:59,319 --> 02:43:06,700
the word doesn't sound right anymore usurp usurp that word does not sound real anymore right say

1062
02:43:06,700 --> 02:43:13,540

1063
02:43:13,540 --> 02:43:21,129

1064
02:43:21,129 --> 02:43:29,930
or take off the wig and get out i feel like if i keep listening then i'm probably gonna die

1065
02:43:31,719 --> 02:43:38,040
keep listening you keep listening the chant goes on and on the clouds begin to churn in the sky

1066
02:43:38,040 --> 02:43:42,760
then a loud crack breaks the stillness as a bolt of lightning skewers the place where the seven

1067
02:43:42,760 --> 02:43:50,549
spirits stand the light clears and they have vanished i'm running i'm running something is

1068
02:43:50,549 --> 02:43:56,549
very wrong you turn and start to run but you cannot get free something like a clawed hand has a hold

1069
02:43:56,549 --> 02:44:02,870
of you and is pulling you towards the top of a low mound the ground itself is transforming into a face

1070
02:44:02,870 --> 02:44:11,079
and you are walking into an open wide smile you struggle and strain but there is nothing to fight

1071
02:44:11,079 --> 02:44:18,620
with the wind your heels score tracks in the dust the force on you is like a hundred invisible hands

1072
02:44:18,620 --> 02:44:23,819
then you are above the wide open jaws of a face in the ground this must be holy ground to some

1073
02:44:23,819 --> 02:44:29,850
dread spirit long forgotten by the civilized people of the world but you will not learn its

1074
02:44:30,729 --> 02:44:40,329
you are not to be a follower you are to be devoured strike back strike back you raise the

1075
02:44:40,329 --> 02:44:45,770
sword to swing but stumble back onto the weight of it your arms seem unable to lift the blade

1076
02:44:45,770 --> 02:44:53,030
i'm so weak but no looking down you see your legs are suddenly thin and your hands are thin and bony

1077
02:44:53,670 --> 02:44:58,549
reaching up to your face you find your hairs coming away in clumps and wrinkles are spreading

1078
02:44:58,549 --> 02:45:08,379
over your skin the serpent face in the ground laughs the jaws of time are inescapable

1079
02:45:12,659 --> 02:45:19,260
you look to the heavens intending to cast a spell you cannot see the stars anymore your eyes

1080
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:24,329
have grown blurry and unfocused and the night swims as if you were underwater

1081
02:45:24,969 --> 02:45:32,569
tumble to the ground and you hear the snap as the bones in your hip and pelvis give out

1082
02:45:32,569 --> 02:45:40,540
the serpent shifts closer you open your mouth to cry out and your teeth scattered

1083
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:56,860
a moment later you are a skeleton you stare out through bone dead eyes cold dry bones you are

1084
02:45:56,860 --> 02:46:03,239
nothing but cold bones but then the winds drop once more the clouds roll back the steps are clearing

1085
02:46:03,239 --> 02:46:08,760
you've failures of becoming young once more bones strengthening skin tightening whatever was pulling

1086
02:46:08,760 --> 02:46:15,159
you towards death has released its grip you turn to see a gigantic shape lift into the ground and

1087
02:46:15,159 --> 02:46:21,020
swoop away northeast it leaves a strange trail as it flies and the wind from its movement knocks

1088
02:46:21,020 --> 02:46:33,239
you to the ground you stagger backwards glad to be alive and keen to leave this accursed place

1089
02:46:39,829 --> 02:46:53,750
made like ripples in time interesting well that's the time serpent and this is where the time serpent

1090
02:46:53,750 --> 02:47:08,229
is now that was the time serpent just fucking with us i do want to see what this is

1091
02:47:10,200 --> 02:47:19,700
before i aim the uh beam at it you set off across the steps with an easy stride but the firm dusty

1092
02:47:19,700 --> 02:47:24,899
ground becomes spongy and after a while you're no longer walking on firm ground but rather

1093
02:47:24,899 --> 02:47:30,020
striding between waist-high weeds in a deep and stench-filled marsh the evening is drawing in

1094
02:47:30,020 --> 02:47:35,290
soon it will be dark suddenly you hear a loud shouting and splashing from the ground of reeds

1095
02:47:35,290 --> 02:47:45,579
close at hand am i wrong you stand your ground as the voices approach you soon recognize them

1096
02:47:45,579 --> 02:47:55,530
as marsh goblins they enter the clearing panting hard as though running from something greet them

1097
02:47:56,090 --> 02:48:10,950
i mean if there's they're running from something i think i could hold on try bring a goblin out

1098
02:48:10,950 --> 02:48:18,440
and be like look i got a goblin where we're got i got a goblin will they be annoyed by that or

1099
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:32,329
would they be i wonder talk all languages is interesting i could talk to them uh cause

1100
02:48:32,329 --> 02:48:51,540
sleepiness can't do smell uh i could do i'm gonna let's talk i'm gonna talk i'm gonna talk okay

1101
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:57,030
removing the green wig you put it on and complete the spell the goblins guttural tongue begins to

1102
02:48:57,030 --> 02:49:06,729
transform into words what is this creature first goblin says we gotta go right out of the gate here

1103
02:49:06,729 --> 02:49:12,469
i mean you no harm you reply the goblins almost jump out of their skins as they realize

1104
02:49:13,030 --> 02:49:18,969
you can not only understand them now but also communicate we don't have time for this

1105
02:49:18,969 --> 02:49:27,770
we must escape what are you running from we're being chased by a terrible serpent it does not

1106
02:49:27,770 --> 02:49:32,889
seem to matter how fast we run however it is always ahead of us it's like it knows what we're

1107
02:49:32,889 --> 02:49:42,940
doing at each turn why is it chasing you it's been coming for us since we encountered the sorceress

1108
02:49:43,020 --> 02:49:52,100
bria she told us this parchment would save us but we're we've been persecuted the serpent is

1109
02:49:52,100 --> 02:49:58,629
clearly scared of it whatever it is i don't know what it is give me that parchment what serpent is

1110
02:49:58,629 --> 02:50:09,430
this which one like this is bad enough one's bad enough it seems to know every moment before we

1111
02:50:09,430 --> 02:50:17,659
know it ourselves give me that parchment he will save you from the serpent to be rid of it goblins

1112
02:50:17,659 --> 02:50:27,319
look from one to another uncertainly this parchment is our only hope i am a sorcerer i will read it to

1113
02:50:27,319 --> 02:50:35,879
you for you it is of no use to you hand it over or i will run you through i'm a sorcerer i will

1114
02:50:35,879 --> 02:50:45,850
read it for you the sorcerer it is worth trying they hand over the parchment and step back as

1115
02:50:45,850 --> 02:50:55,430
though expecting the ground to open underneath you of course nothing happens read it you unroll the

1116
02:50:55,430 --> 02:51:00,149
paper and look it over unfortunately it is written in a language you cannot understand despite your

1117
02:51:00,149 --> 02:51:16,250
spell licks thank them you thank them and they shrug it will do you little good stranger you

1118
02:51:16,250 --> 02:51:24,100
nod to the goblins thankful for their help we must hurry we must go they select a path through the

1119
02:51:24,100 --> 02:51:31,450
marsh and begin to move attack them let them go we need friends you stand aside and the goblins

1120
02:51:31,450 --> 02:51:37,459
hurry away through the marsh they move with the speed of rats still peering into the distant fog

1121
02:51:37,459 --> 02:51:48,629
you cannot see what it is they are afraid of links l i x all right let's go over to the room

1122
02:51:48,629 --> 02:52:00,459
the marshes give way to more solid barren ground the sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky

1123
02:52:01,590 --> 02:52:06,229
something is visible in the distance to the south perhaps man-made or perhaps a freak of nature

1124
02:52:06,229 --> 02:52:17,500
carved from the rocks but it resembles a low stone building interesting the temple behind the temple

1125
02:52:18,139 --> 02:52:34,440
all right okay uh some very clear directions to go to this looks interesting this is interesting

1126
02:52:34,440 --> 02:52:55,290
this is interesting i'm gonna just say let's go uh maybe the well first start at the well you skirt

1127
02:52:55,290 --> 02:52:59,129
around the building and the bits of rubble that surround it around the side of the ruin you find

1128
02:52:59,129 --> 02:53:06,840
an old well house the well is an ancient mud brick structure if it once had a cover it has long since

1129
02:53:06,840 --> 02:53:12,440
rotted but the metal winch handle is still in place and an old bucket on a rope hangs from it

1130
02:53:13,639 --> 02:53:20,100
drop the sun serpent orb into the well i kind of want to see what happens when i do this i'll

1131
02:53:20,100 --> 02:53:27,750
rewind drop the sun serpent orb into the well you lean over the well and then drop the orb containing

1132
02:53:27,750 --> 02:53:33,670
the sun serpent deep into its depths for a moment your heart swells with excitement but then as the

1133
02:53:33,670 --> 02:53:38,459
dust clears you realize you have not destroyed the serpent you have only set it free it boils

1134
02:53:38,459 --> 02:53:45,799
upwards like a rising fireball radiating a terrifying heat the serpent is a blaze of

1135
02:53:45,799 --> 02:53:59,100
yellow fire almost too bright to look at directly cast a spell i don't have anything that connects g

1136
02:54:01,899 --> 02:54:16,940
damn it i need that fucking ring okay shield no no i no no no no we're going to rewind

1137
02:54:16,940 --> 02:54:29,909
uh i'm gonna look in the bucket you haul the bucket over the side of the well and look into it

1138
02:54:29,909 --> 02:54:37,370
it is quite empty clearly this well has not been used for a very long time let's lower it

1139
02:54:37,370 --> 02:54:41,670
with some effort you get the handle of the well to turn and lower the bucket down into the well

1140
02:54:41,670 --> 02:54:48,870
shaft keep going you lower the bucket all the way to the end of the rope there is no splash from

1141
02:54:48,870 --> 02:54:58,649
below it seems the well is dry after all okay raise the bucket you turn the old creaking

1142
02:54:58,649 --> 02:55:05,899
handle raising the bucket up the shaft anything in it you look into the bucket a snake leaps out

1143
02:55:05,899 --> 02:55:10,569
at you from inside and you spring back just in time to avoid being bitten the bucket falls to

1144
02:55:10,569 --> 02:55:15,860
the ground and the snake slithers out towards you fangs bared is this one of the dreaded seven

1145
02:55:15,860 --> 02:55:40,409
serpents it seems very small this is bait it's not a serpent talk all languages again um illusion

1146
02:55:40,409 --> 02:55:58,540
would work fix requires a staff of oak sapling wait was it licks or fix you know you know i'm

1147
02:55:58,540 --> 02:56:09,299
asking it was licks um let's do something fun let's make an illusion we have the bracelet might

1148
02:56:09,299 --> 02:56:18,569
as well use it you bind the constellations into design around you the spell has no effect it seems

1149
02:56:18,569 --> 02:56:22,649
the snake is not intelligent enough to be fooled by an illusion okay well this is pretty evenly

1150
02:56:22,649 --> 02:56:33,059
matched we're going all in 50 hp done already the yellow snake looms up from the bucket spitting

1151
02:56:33,139 --> 02:56:39,459
you lash wildly aiming to chop the creature down as it also leaps forward thick snake blood

1152
02:56:39,459 --> 02:56:47,159
pours along your sword blade i think i can go again because that was all i'm going again

1153
02:56:47,159 --> 02:56:52,870
and it was huge and it was almost a two-hit kill snake is weakening its snarls across the

1154
02:56:52,870 --> 02:56:57,030
ground i think i go again there's no way you're gonna be able to do it by it better than that

1155
02:56:57,030 --> 02:57:04,020
and you're dead perfect sword play flawless fighting you slice a side blow the snake hisses

1156
02:57:04,020 --> 02:57:15,290
as it dies all right you return to the side of the well we're good what else can i do here maybe

1157
02:57:15,290 --> 02:57:35,739
should i float down force field float in the air let's do float in the air see if i can go in there

1158
02:57:36,379 --> 02:57:51,379
oh that lower the bucket oh fuck okay climb climb i'm gonna go climb into the well you feel inside

1159
02:57:51,379 --> 02:57:55,879
the edge of the well for handholds it has been at least a day since you last wandered through a

1160
02:57:55,879 --> 02:58:02,520
sewer after all but there are none the stone edges of the wall are smooth and the well itself is too

1161
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:08,020
broad to shimmy down you could always climb down the rope of course yeah i'll be good i'm

1162
02:58:08,020 --> 02:58:12,569
floating i'm literally floating right now you steal your courage and swing your legs over the

1163
02:58:12,569 --> 02:58:18,360
edge of the well regarding the darkness far below the rope is old and probably rotten and should it

1164
02:58:18,360 --> 02:58:26,440
break there will be no way back up i'm done hand over hand you lower yourself into the ancient

1165
02:58:26,440 --> 02:58:37,000
well shaft okay with your reduced weight you scramble down the rope without difficulty until

1166
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:43,540
you are until you are hanging just beside a crystal seam in the rock look at the crystal

1167
02:58:43,540 --> 02:58:52,409
dig out the crystal with my sword use the aniland sword instead okay what is this the seam of

1168
02:58:52,409 --> 02:58:57,209
crystal is quite beautiful the soft rock walls are studded with fists and lumps of green and

1169
02:58:57,209 --> 02:59:05,780
blue gem glass there must be a fortune down here perhaps even a layered strata of pure wealth

1170
02:59:05,780 --> 02:59:16,329
only the backlands could be mined by the king of aniland uh let's use the shitty sword using

1171
02:59:16,329 --> 02:59:21,209
your old sword awkwardly in the narrow confines of the well shaft you dig a fistful of gems out

1172
02:59:21,209 --> 02:59:27,590
of the wall of the well shaft you cannot catch them all and they fall but thankfully land in the

1173
02:59:27,590 --> 02:59:33,459
bucket a short distance below you oh i didn't lower it all the way the bucket was lowered

1174
02:59:33,459 --> 02:59:39,139
halfway right next to me you have blunted the edge of your blade in the process however

1175
02:59:39,139 --> 02:59:46,940
should i dig for more more you keep digging hoping to get even more crystal from the rock wall

1176
02:59:46,940 --> 02:59:53,459
and you do getting several crystals the size of skulls but then your spell wears off the rope

1177
02:59:54,180 --> 02:59:59,299
and then starts to spin violently it is unraveling there's nothing you can do to stop it

1178
02:59:59,299 --> 03:00:05,559
then it snaps and you fall hitting the bucket below saved for a moment you think you are saved

1179
03:00:05,559 --> 03:00:10,860
but of course nothing is holding up the bucket you fall into the depths of the well when the bucket

1180
03:00:10,860 --> 03:00:24,299
shatters your neck goes with it you fall into your death your adventure is at an end okay well i got

1181
03:00:24,379 --> 03:00:38,979
greedy okay uh thankfully land the bucket dig for more wait shit i did the thing as it says

1182
03:00:38,979 --> 03:00:49,350
it says it's the same thing okay use the sword okay go back up i'm all right all right all right

1183
03:00:49,350 --> 03:00:56,040
i just i didn't know if i could do anything else okay go back up not wanting to risk the spell

1184
03:00:56,040 --> 03:01:04,729
wearing off you clamor up quickly okay now i'm gonna get the gems raise the bucket you bring

1185
03:01:04,729 --> 03:01:09,590
the bucket up to the well look in the bucket you check inside the bucket the bottom of the bucket

1186
03:01:09,590 --> 03:01:15,670
is also filled with uncut gemstones and glittering rock this hall must be worth scores of gold

1187
03:01:15,670 --> 03:01:22,920
pieces take the gems scoop up the gems from the pocket you scoop up the gems from the pocket and

1188
03:01:22,920 --> 03:01:30,299
pour them gleefully into your money pouch an excellent find the gems are an assortment of

1189
03:01:30,299 --> 03:01:36,819
different types of stone and will require an expert to sort value and cut them but the sheer

1190
03:01:36,819 --> 03:01:50,389
size of them is jaw dropping several are the size of eggs and one is the size of a small cat who can

1191
03:01:50,389 --> 03:02:01,530
i bring these to the jeweler from the village is the jeweler from the village ah maybe i can go back

1192
03:02:01,530 --> 03:02:09,510
okay leave the well please with your work you stride away from the well i need to eat

1193
03:02:09,510 --> 03:02:36,309
because i'm dying and i let's see good uh let's go in here oh i love this art style what's the

1194
03:02:36,309 --> 03:02:52,149
artist's name i what's the artist's name look it up sorcery artist i should know this why

1195
03:02:52,149 --> 03:03:12,180
don't have how have i forgotten this ian livingston that's where it is ian livingston is the artist

1196
03:03:12,180 --> 03:03:30,219
i love it you climb up onto the plinth on which the structure stands it appears quiet enough

1197
03:03:30,219 --> 03:03:40,920
so whether it is structurally sound or not is another matter cool one of the pillars of the

1198
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:53,159
temple seems to take a step sideways or was that your imagination you step inside the temple the

1199
03:03:53,159 --> 03:03:58,440
floor space is quite empty but the walls are decorated with long lines of strange hieroglyphs

1200
03:03:58,950 --> 03:04:05,510
that remind you a little of the symbols decorated the ancient shrine of corga in kare you cannot

1201
03:04:05,510 --> 03:04:11,540
read them but may be able to decipher them if you look more closely a little dust trickles down from

1202
03:04:11,540 --> 03:04:21,819
the temple roof okay so this is a corga shrine corga if you recap andy here corga is a god in

1203
03:04:21,819 --> 03:04:35,500
this game a god and if you it's very god's very easy to anger it's the god of what is it chaos

1204
03:04:35,500 --> 03:04:41,909
or something you have to do a very specific step of instructions for it to get the favor of corga

1205
03:04:41,909 --> 03:04:53,899
or it'll kill you instantly um let's let's just read the hieroglyphs are not exactly like any

1206
03:04:53,899 --> 03:04:58,379
language you have seen before but they are similar to others you know you spell out the first few

1207
03:04:58,379 --> 03:05:11,459
words allowed this temple built by priests yadu in honor in honor throth goddess of earth wrong

1208
03:05:11,459 --> 03:05:19,430
lore fake fan oops those not of faith are forbidden and these must not speak the name

1209
03:05:19,430 --> 03:05:25,159
throth you stop suddenly there's a deep rumbling in the ground below your feet

1210
03:05:27,590 --> 03:05:35,690
don't say the name throth while you're reading the name throth uh i forget what happens here

1211
03:05:41,819 --> 03:05:46,870
if i don't have throth for a god i can't be here i think i just need to get out of here

1212
03:05:46,870 --> 03:06:00,100
ian livingston is a different author john blanche the artist really i always thought that ian

1213
03:06:00,100 --> 03:06:11,670
livingston did the art let me hold on let me let's confirm this ian livingston is an english

1241
03:11:21,850 --> 03:11:35,129
down the hall it was you were running to get over here okay no then i will bury you replies throff

1242
03:11:35,129 --> 03:11:40,170
opening a crack in the ground beneath your feet from above the roof cracks and a slab of rock

1243
03:11:40,170 --> 03:11:48,250
falls do not alter my beliefs your heart is resolute and you are fixed the rock overhead

1244
03:11:48,250 --> 03:11:56,840
falls it is your capstone and the ground below is your grave you have been buried alive okay so

1245
03:11:56,840 --> 03:12:07,219
we just don't step over here all right i'm gonna push one of the pillars testing the strength you

1246
03:12:07,219 --> 03:12:13,059
have you heave against one of the temple's pillars it seems solid then a moment later it shears and

1247
03:12:13,059 --> 03:12:21,190
gives way the whole structure is sliding down on top of you dodge you dodge backwards as the gigantic

1248
03:12:21,190 --> 03:12:26,229
roof of the building tilts sliding in your direction you are still alive but you're now

1249
03:12:26,229 --> 03:12:35,500
trapping ease an enormous pile of rubble help help me help you cry out feebly for aid but of

1250
03:12:35,500 --> 03:12:48,520
course no one comes these are the clatterback steps and no one lives here broth traders deserve

1251
03:12:48,520 --> 03:12:58,010
the kid oh my god uh i could summon a giant please giant friend help me i'm buried under all of this

1252
03:12:58,969 --> 03:13:19,989
i can't teleport i could grow in size that one works i'm dead in one hit you cast the enchantment

1253
03:13:19,989 --> 03:13:26,629
rapidly growing to 18 feet in height but in such a small space there is no room for the transition

1254
03:13:26,629 --> 03:13:36,569
and you end up terribly squashed i just made it worse all right push the stones i'm big now

1255
03:13:36,569 --> 03:13:41,299
you even push with all you might and finally a few of the stones begin to move you keep pushing

1256
03:13:41,299 --> 03:13:44,899
yourself through until you squirm out from underneath the giant pillar and lie gasping

1257
03:13:44,899 --> 03:13:52,040
on the stone the temple is now completely destroyed thus spiraling up into the air

1258
03:13:52,040 --> 03:13:57,750
you search through the rubble but find nothing of use the plinth is now knee deep in broken

1259
03:13:57,750 --> 03:14:06,819
stone and pebble sized rocks take a pebble okay i now have access to grenades you gather up a

1260
03:14:06,819 --> 03:14:13,020
couple of pebbles from the plinth of the right size and shape to be useful in spells but of the

1261
03:14:13,020 --> 03:14:23,219
ancient temples treasures and artifacts there's nothing more to be had oh did i lose access to

1262
03:14:23,219 --> 03:14:30,889
this i think i did i destroyed the whole place there's nothing more to be done here you leave

1263
03:14:30,889 --> 03:14:49,180
the ancient building behind and you stride forwards okay okay we're cool what about okay

1264
03:14:49,180 --> 03:14:53,340
so now i'm going to go over here and let's aim this in this direction and see what this looks

1265
03:14:53,340 --> 03:15:06,739
like in the in the past then we can aim it up here too got a lot to do okay you sink lower

1266
03:15:06,739 --> 03:15:12,250
in the mud we already did this you go through the marsh uh just keep walking we're fine we won't

1267
03:15:12,250 --> 03:15:22,389
sink it's just the marsh lands and now let's go into the mountain last hit point dude uh it's true

1268
03:15:23,959 --> 03:20:18,170
i gotta pee let's take a break i'll be right back seeing some people saying woman throff

1269
03:20:18,170 --> 03:20:49,290
hell seems like it's a little bit of a war here we got the age still we're fine back to it all

1270
03:20:49,290 --> 03:21:00,760
right so we are at another tower you want a quick little recap we ruined this temple pissed off an

1271
03:21:00,760 --> 03:21:12,680
incredibly powerful goddess chose the ape uh got like tortured over here by the time serpent time

1272
03:21:12,680 --> 03:21:21,180
serpent kind of fucked off over here i said it looks like at least it looks like that and now

1273
03:21:21,180 --> 03:21:28,940
we're here at one of these beacons you approach the edge of the mountains in the base of an old

1274
03:21:28,940 --> 03:21:33,979
stone tower carved from the cliff face itself from the battlements of the tower protrudes a strange

1275
03:21:33,979 --> 03:21:55,180
brass cylinder nestled between the stones there's a large closed wooden door okay let's just knock

1276
03:21:55,180 --> 03:22:02,200
on the door you knock on the door there's no reply i only have one hp so i can't really cast any

1277
03:22:02,200 --> 03:22:08,469
spells so we're just gonna have to go in you try the door to the tower it's locked but the wood is

1278
03:22:08,469 --> 03:22:16,440
ancient and rotten and could most likely be easily broken break down the door you take a run up and

1279
03:22:16,440 --> 03:22:22,170
then charge at the door smashing straight through and tumbling to the floor inside hopefully this

1280
03:22:22,170 --> 03:22:31,110
doesn't kill me oh no i'm dead i'm gonna die here okay you pick yourself up off the ground

1281
03:22:31,110 --> 03:22:36,389
only finding yourself staring into the snarling jaws of a wolfhound it's clearly half mad with

1282
03:22:36,389 --> 03:22:51,930
starvation there's no time and no choice let's go six good okay that was clean it limps back

1283
03:22:52,010 --> 03:23:00,309
bleeding heavily if i get it close again here like three point let's do all in i just completely

1284
03:23:00,309 --> 03:23:19,510
ruined everything i'm dead i thought it was good okay uh this time it's gonna defend i'm gonna

1285
03:23:19,510 --> 03:23:30,149
defend too and then we full blast uh yep all right we're good full blast again that should do it

1286
03:23:32,090 --> 03:23:37,930
barely but we got it all right i'm good wolfhounds howls a gurgling blood-soaked

1287
03:23:37,930 --> 03:23:44,889
sound that rings inside the tower and then it dies you wipe your long sword and how much

1288
03:23:44,889 --> 03:23:49,829
harder would this be without the long sword i wonder plus two you wipe your long sword and gas

1289
03:23:49,829 --> 03:23:55,350
for breath as you look around the room the wide tower base is empty except for a flight of spiral

1290
03:23:55,350 --> 03:24:03,670
stairs leading up to a hatch in the ceiling overhead search the shadows you try to ignore

1291
03:24:03,670 --> 03:24:08,229
the smell of wet blood that fills the chamber and search the gloomy arches under the spiraling

1292
03:24:08,229 --> 03:24:17,190
staircase in a forgotten corner you unearth three gold pieces take the money you take the coins and

1293
03:24:17,190 --> 03:24:21,110
drop them into your purse time to leave this gloomy place yes we're going to go turn this on

1294
03:24:26,469 --> 03:24:31,940
i should sleep here you clamor up the spiral stairs to the hatch and go through onto the roof

1295
03:24:31,940 --> 03:24:37,559
of the tower the cool wind of the steps hits you full in the face snatching your breath away

1296
03:24:37,559 --> 03:24:42,860
this tower stands on the slope of one of the horns themselves looking out over the hole of

1297
03:24:42,860 --> 03:24:48,600
the steps the tower bears another brass cylinder similar to the last there are powerful unusual

1298
03:24:48,600 --> 03:25:13,059
stars here unusual stars why are they unusual unusual i could see the future again here

1299
03:25:16,069 --> 03:25:30,309
hmm activate the beacon takes a moment beacon is now activated and ah okay look what i could do

1300
03:25:30,870 --> 03:25:43,059
here's okay here's here's the i could aim it here or actually right here i could complete the bridge

1301
03:25:43,059 --> 03:25:57,989
with this one and turn that beacon into the past is there anything here worth exploring probably

1302
03:25:57,989 --> 03:26:07,770
that so remember this is the past so this was the temple now it's something else now it's just

1303
03:26:07,770 --> 03:26:25,829
the one little spot this is still here let's check out this because i want to see what this is

1304
03:26:25,829 --> 03:26:32,379
i want to see this in the past and i want to see over here in the past too that should do it right

1305
03:26:33,020 --> 03:26:47,450
it's also rest go get the ring i'll go get the ring you could not choose a better place to rest

1306
03:26:47,450 --> 03:26:52,809
you close the latch and lie down on top of it nothing will cost you now unless it has wings

1307
03:26:53,530 --> 03:26:58,469
at least you've eaten once already today thank god you close your eyes and let your

1308
03:26:58,469 --> 03:27:05,989
tiredness overtake you you feel quite safe you do not dream you ran out of provisions and gained

1309
03:27:05,989 --> 03:27:11,270
some gold and you collected the sun serpent so you now have destroyed three of the archmages

1310
03:27:11,270 --> 03:27:23,500
serpents okay look at the view you go over to the battleman and lean out looking north you see the

1311
03:27:23,500 --> 03:27:29,799
edge of the thick and virgin forest the fabled trees of santa you heard about them as a boy of

1312
03:27:29,799 --> 03:27:35,579
course but never dreamed you would see them for yourself between there and here is nothing but

1313
03:27:35,579 --> 03:27:40,549
the level flats of the steps layered like the scales on a serpent's back a thin column of

1314
03:27:40,549 --> 03:27:45,579
smoke rises from a point just before the treeline it must be the village of the clatterman

1315
03:27:45,579 --> 03:28:03,030
you look away from the view once more let's get down here okay good good mountains easter

1316
03:28:03,030 --> 03:28:11,370
impassable huh all right so let's see what this is now i feel like i'm gonna get fucked with by the

1317
03:28:11,930 --> 03:28:17,340
time serpent again but this is in the past you're walking through boggy marshland a few clouds

1318
03:28:17,340 --> 03:28:23,719
hurry across the sky you cross the marshland and pause inside a ring of seven standing stones

1319
03:28:23,719 --> 03:28:30,860
look at the stones each stone in the ring is the size and breadth of a man they stand straight

1320
03:28:30,860 --> 03:28:38,420
upright except for one which has listed sideways like an arthritic finger a few are carved in the

1321
03:28:38,420 --> 03:28:43,989
very center of the ring a flat stone lies an inch or so below the water level of the marsh wet

1322
03:28:43,989 --> 03:28:51,049
things gulp and groan in the mud below one time i listened to one of your streams so i could go

1323
03:28:51,049 --> 03:29:00,149
to sleep and it gave me the worst nightmares it's not my fault that's the entire like four or five

1324
03:29:00,149 --> 03:29:06,010
servings of macaroni and cheese you ate before going to bed has nothing to do with me that's

1325
03:29:06,010 --> 03:29:20,420
nothing to do with me come on gwen okay uh should i go stand on it look at it you trace the carving

1326
03:29:20,420 --> 03:29:26,739
on one of the nearby stones shows a fearsome bird rising up into the sky wings blotting out

1327
03:29:26,739 --> 03:29:31,770
the rising sun let's just go stand on it fuck it why not you go stand on the central stone but

1328
03:29:31,770 --> 03:29:37,159
nothing special occurs if there is magic here you cannot fathom it you step out from the circle

1329
03:29:37,159 --> 03:29:45,319
once more and plod on through the marsh water so i don't get it maybe this is where you cast licks

1330
03:29:45,319 --> 03:29:54,969
it's been a long time i don't remember i besides last year when i played it yeah you gotta go back

1331
03:29:54,969 --> 03:30:14,549
seven or eight years okay let's go i want to see this too and this laughing my ass off what is

1332
03:30:14,549 --> 03:30:22,020
this youtube donation shit i don't know i i didn't even look at it yet i have not even opened up my

1333
03:30:22,020 --> 03:30:28,069
twitch dashboard to even see what that is like i know what it is but i haven't even looked at it

1334
03:30:28,069 --> 03:30:33,209
all right the ground itself seems to give way to bog land until you are splashing through marshland

1335
03:30:33,209 --> 03:30:39,079
once again you stumble upon a low round structure it is the mouth of a well oh it's the well the

1336
03:30:39,079 --> 03:30:57,350
well is the only thing that's here is there more gems in here i'm going in should i throw a stone

1337
03:30:57,350 --> 03:31:03,780
toss a stone you toss a stone into the well it falls for a few seconds and then you hear a splash

1338
03:31:03,780 --> 03:31:09,850
so there's water in the past as you stand by the well side you hear a scraping noise from within

1339
03:31:09,930 --> 03:31:14,329
and after a few minutes two curved claws emerge through the opening hooking onto either side of

1340
03:31:14,329 --> 03:31:22,149
the well mouth something is pulling itself up dislodge the hooks acting quickly you knock the

1341
03:31:22,149 --> 03:31:29,829
hooks free there is a scream very human as the figure inside the well falls there is a distant

1342
03:31:29,829 --> 03:31:37,500
splash and then silence oh shit are you in there you cry leaning over the edge of the well there

1343
03:31:37,500 --> 03:31:48,969
is no reply i think i just killed somebody look into the well you stare down hoping for a response

1344
03:31:48,969 --> 03:31:58,299
but can make nothing out below toss down the rope ladder acting quickly you tie the rope ladder to

1345
03:31:58,299 --> 03:32:04,229
a peg on the well house and toss the rope ladder down for a moment you think it has done no good

1346
03:32:04,229 --> 03:32:11,299
but then the rope goes taut someone is climbing up am i just running at this point like why would

1347
03:32:11,299 --> 03:32:23,100
you run wait you wait as the figure clamors out of the well and then dusts itself down

1348
03:32:23,180 --> 03:32:32,809
they collect up the rope ladder and hand it back to you thank you stranger the creature declares

1349
03:32:32,809 --> 03:32:40,299
greetings you declare the creature doffs its hat rubbing a bruise on its head as it hands you back

1350
03:32:40,299 --> 03:32:45,940
the stone you threw down the well then without a further word it turns and disappears across

1351
03:32:45,940 --> 03:33:07,260
what is there something else i could have said it's just okay you continue to walk a big bruise on

1352
03:33:07,260 --> 03:33:32,149
his head uh can i go up here uh the air is warm oh wait a minute i can what's this have i been i

1353
03:33:32,149 --> 03:33:39,000
don't i haven't been here you keep moving ascending and descending the sun is beginning to lower and

1354
03:33:39,000 --> 03:33:50,229
the air begins to cool this is the eastern slope of the baobab ridge move on oh it's too steep i

1355
03:33:50,229 --> 03:34:12,569
can't get up there it's too steep but i want to who's in this hut could i have floated or

1356
03:34:17,819 --> 03:34:27,319
i guess i can let's do uh this doesn't cost any stamina let's hover looking to the constellations

1357
03:34:27,319 --> 03:34:32,600
you craft the spell then the medallion begins to glow as you rise gently into the air you rise a

1358
03:34:32,600 --> 03:34:40,139
short way up the rock chimney but the whole ascent is a long way keep going spell carries you high

1359
03:34:40,139 --> 03:34:49,739
and without incident or weakening you land gently on the mountaintop here we go oh okay your weight

1360
03:34:49,739 --> 03:34:55,940
returns and you settle gradually back down to the ground this was once perhaps the cone of a volcano

1361
03:34:56,809 --> 03:35:03,059
now it is a wide dusty stone bowl but it is not empty in the center stands a circular dwelling

1362
03:35:03,379 --> 03:35:11,129
with a steeply pitched canvas roof look at the chimney looking more closely at the chimney in

1363
03:35:11,129 --> 03:35:14,889
the rock you notice a faint purple aura surrounding some of the stones near the top

1364
03:35:15,450 --> 03:35:21,799
and a few faint purple glows further down perhaps there is some enchantment on this

1365
03:35:21,799 --> 03:35:29,319
blue or perhaps it is simply a color the owner of the hut enjoys cold winds claw your skin it

1366
03:35:29,319 --> 03:35:36,649
might just they might just like the color you're going the wrong way there is no wrong way there

1367
03:35:36,649 --> 03:35:56,469
is only there's only forward in sorcery there's no wrong way drop a stone down the chimney what

1368
03:35:56,469 --> 03:36:08,180
can i do here i keep dropping rocks on people's heads uh i mean this is a great opportunity

1369
03:36:08,979 --> 03:36:21,290
to send a goblin in yeah let's do it i'm doing it okay casting your spell across the goblin

1370
03:36:21,290 --> 03:36:26,870
tooth the tooth erupts into a column of smoke and a moment later a goblin warrior is standing in

1371
03:36:26,870 --> 03:36:35,700
front of you order the goblin into the hut you point at the hut door and order the goblin to

1372
03:36:35,700 --> 03:36:44,280
proceed it does so but a moment later has vaporized into a pile of dust clearly something very powerful

1373
03:36:44,280 --> 03:36:53,989
lives within all right now drop a rock down the chimney you grab a nearby stone and toss it over

1374
03:36:53,989 --> 03:36:59,180
the side of the mountain it plummets just as fast as you might expect careening and bouncing from

1375
03:36:59,180 --> 03:37:06,139
the chimney sides until it explodes into particulate dust halfway down a few loose

1376
03:37:06,139 --> 03:37:19,579
stones tumble over the sheer drop to the east and disappear uh send another goblin in that

1377
03:37:19,579 --> 03:37:40,579
was funny i could do big safe passage how is a good one here do another goblin what about sus

1378
03:37:41,379 --> 03:37:52,489
i mean we we casted a free sus because i said to a goblin to go in there and investigate and he got

1379
03:37:52,489 --> 03:38:02,170
fucking liquidated so we know it's dangerous in there let's do big and just like walk over there

1380
03:38:02,170 --> 03:38:13,510
why not you line the starlight into shape quickly expanding to triple your size let's go into the

1381
03:38:13,590 --> 03:38:19,270
chimney i can't can i no no no no no no this is i'm gonna slide down

1382
03:38:20,659 --> 03:38:26,950
pass no we're going in the hut i'm going to the hut you approach the hut its walls are made of

1383
03:38:26,950 --> 03:38:32,760
painted wooden planks well set into the rock below this is no temporary shack or a traveler's tent

1384
03:38:33,319 --> 03:38:39,879
a little thin smoke is rising from the stack there's strong and generous magic here as often

1385
03:38:39,879 --> 03:38:48,680
occurs high up knock on the door you approach the door and you knock from inside of wizened voice

1386
03:38:48,680 --> 03:38:58,899
calls you're late enter the hut intrigued by the voice's words you open the door and hunch down

1387
03:38:58,899 --> 03:39:08,299
low and squeeze yourself into the oh i'm big what what's the point of being this huge okay

1388
03:39:11,340 --> 03:39:17,850
inside the hut there is no room to stand up it is a small place made even smaller by your spell

1389
03:39:17,850 --> 03:39:30,010
of giantism let us suppose that i am a sorcerer and you are a sorcerer too do you know which of

1390
03:39:30,010 --> 03:39:42,739
us is the more powerful uh there is no contest it is i guess so a moment later there is a snatch

1391
03:39:42,739 --> 03:39:50,329
of music and suddenly your legs and arms jerk upwards then fall still what was that there's

1392
03:39:50,329 --> 03:39:55,850
another burst of magic and your legs begin to kick and pirouette you around you are dancing

1393
03:39:58,250 --> 03:40:07,319
oh i'm getting i'm getting a jig uh stand still you try to hold your body still but it is useless

1394
03:40:07,319 --> 03:40:12,680
it is not that your limbs are under external control but rather the compulsion to dance like

1395
03:40:12,680 --> 03:40:19,299
the compulsion to sneeze is so strong you cannot resist for more than a moment i see you are not

1396
03:40:19,299 --> 03:40:26,459
powerful enough to counter that stop the music the music stops and you collapse into a nearby

1397
03:40:26,459 --> 03:40:35,780
chair i know the spell you hear the speaker rise and approach a wizened calloused hand is offered

1398
03:40:36,709 --> 03:40:44,780
welcome i mean you're no harm as you can tell by my advanced age spit on the hand

1399
03:40:47,670 --> 03:40:55,940
no greetings okay gentle light is filling the hut and you can now see the sorceress a woman so ancient

1400
03:40:55,940 --> 03:41:02,500
that her features are lost within a mess of wrinkles she smiles as you look at her i could

1401
03:41:02,500 --> 03:41:13,530
be anybody under all these years could i not who are you my name is bria i am a sorceress of high

1402
03:41:13,530 --> 03:41:21,620
zamen though i left that place some time ago you're welcome she frowns though if you continue

1403
03:41:21,620 --> 03:41:26,899
stomping around in here at three times your proper size you're going to knock something over so we

1404
03:41:26,899 --> 03:41:38,489
won't have any more of that it'll it'll pass hey it'll pass soon don't worry it'll pass

1405
03:41:39,860 --> 03:41:50,920
cancel the spell no i'm good i'm hanging out i'm big it'll pass soon you reply casually not soon

1406
03:41:50,920 --> 03:41:56,389
enough bria clicks her tongue and reaches into a pouch by her side producing something the size

1407
03:41:56,389 --> 03:42:05,559
and shape of a die what what is that you say as you lean forward bumping the part of your forehead

1408
03:42:05,559 --> 03:42:14,040
that hurts the most onto the beam that is a support beam of the roof ow the giant's tooth

1409
03:42:14,600 --> 03:42:20,780
she replies casting it onto the floor a moment later smoke is hissing from the tooth are we

1410
03:42:20,780 --> 03:42:33,290
having a giant fight uh step back you step back quickly expecting a giant to materialize in the

1411
03:42:33,290 --> 03:42:38,760
middle of the hut but nothing happens the smoke from the tooth quickly passes a moment later you

1412
03:42:39,399 --> 03:42:48,139
are shrinking back to your normal size a counter spell yes the spell of giantism is countered by

1413
03:42:48,139 --> 03:43:02,729
that of giant summoning cheeky very cheeky you are a follower of the archmage jumping back yes yes

1414
03:43:02,729 --> 03:43:09,450
yes you are worried but please the archmage of the fortress was not always as he is now gradually

1415
03:43:09,450 --> 03:43:17,659
you shrink back down to your normal size ask about the archmage can you tell me of the archmage

1416
03:43:17,659 --> 03:43:24,200
imagine if you will a country of great peace and prosperity ruled over by a group of wise and

1417
03:43:24,200 --> 03:43:30,620
powerful sorcerers and sorceresses they tended the fields managed the weather healed the sick

1418
03:43:30,620 --> 03:43:36,809
they chose their leader by an arcane process any child from the land might become that leader

1419
03:43:36,809 --> 03:43:46,920
and be taught their role from an early age what of the crown you demand the crown of kings a

1420
03:43:46,920 --> 03:43:52,440
powerful thing certainly but nothing against a fortress of sorcerers working in concert the

1421
03:43:52,440 --> 03:44:01,020
crown was given to the human kingdoms to let them feel themselves self-governed imagine the archmage

1422
03:44:01,020 --> 03:44:08,629
as a peacemaker teacher but also a thinker a discoverer of many secrets of the stars he looked

1423
03:44:08,629 --> 03:44:25,399
too far this archmage he is evil yes now yes that is probably true it was not always so but you

1424
03:44:25,399 --> 03:44:33,180
should not let that trouble you if you need to kill him and kill him you must she gestures you

1425
03:44:33,180 --> 03:44:41,340
to sit down and takes a seat herself what about the serpents what do you know of the seven serpents

1426
03:44:41,340 --> 03:44:47,370
they are the archmage's servants but even they cannot travel the backlands without

1427
03:44:47,370 --> 03:44:56,500
fouling foul of its terrible curse i see that you search for them do you know where they are

1428
03:44:56,500 --> 03:45:03,959
i've seen a few things the earth serpent lies in wait in a fissure near the great lake eclala

1429
03:45:03,959 --> 03:45:10,500
and the serpent of time is the worst of the seven swift and all but indestructible

1430
03:45:13,209 --> 03:45:22,520
fissure near the great lake does he have a weakness he does i do not know it it is a secret known

1431
03:45:22,520 --> 03:45:31,559
only to the marsh goblins if you can find them i did find them you thank her the old woman stands

1432
03:45:31,559 --> 03:45:40,709
suddenly and goes over to a table tea yeah thank you i'll stay i i licks how do she nods and boils

1433
03:45:40,709 --> 03:45:47,100
a pan of water by holding it between her palms for a moment she drops a pat of goat butter and

1434
03:45:47,100 --> 03:45:57,860
stirs it around and pours out two ceramic cups i did this routine last time but we're doing it

1435
03:45:57,860 --> 03:46:03,459
again you see i swapped the cups when you turned around and then i thought you poisoned your cup

1436
03:46:03,459 --> 03:46:11,799
but then the fact that i swapped the cups means the poison was in my cup thank you i will bow for

1437
03:46:11,799 --> 03:46:25,379
that one inconceivable i love when he just falls over he just goes he's like completely still and

1438
03:46:25,379 --> 03:46:31,350
he just goes just drink it normally i'll just we'll just drink it i'm gonna drink mine you

1439
03:46:31,350 --> 03:46:36,979
lift the cup to your lips and drink deep it is warm and rich and refreshing didn't need to swap

1440
03:46:36,979 --> 03:46:48,700
cups don't need to do anything weird i don't i don't think that rea is gonna hurt us goat cheese

1441
03:46:48,700 --> 03:46:55,590
tea i know i wouldn't drink it this is the anilander not me my suspension of disbelief is

1442
03:46:55,590 --> 03:47:00,469
only go so far i mean i it's actually kind of hard to believe that somebody would drink

1443
03:47:00,469 --> 03:47:07,100
goat cheese tea it's that my disbelief is hard to to quell when i think about anybody eating anything

1444
03:47:07,100 --> 03:47:15,780
goat cheese i just you're losing me a little tell me more of yourself you ask sipping your tea

1445
03:47:18,840 --> 03:47:26,250
me blushing a lot there was little more to know i lived in the fortress for most of my life

1446
03:47:26,250 --> 03:47:35,159
i came here in my old age she winces hot tea is dripping from a crack in her tea cup cheap

1447
03:47:35,159 --> 03:47:41,180
pottery rubbish she grumbles digging up a small pot of glue from a box and repairing it she leaves

1448
03:47:41,180 --> 03:47:49,559
the glue pot on the table do you play swindle stones i mean can i have the i need glue for a

1449
03:47:49,559 --> 03:47:54,969
spell you pick up the pot of glue and put it in your pack without another word the sorceress

1450
03:47:54,969 --> 03:48:02,979
watches you with some amusement though you cannot think why she stands i'm tiring of you you should

1451
03:48:02,979 --> 03:48:12,840
go but first one more thing if you are traveling to high xamen to face the archmage hadn't you best

1452
03:48:12,840 --> 03:48:23,479
know a little of the higher functions of magic you speak of countering good you know it

1453
03:48:26,680 --> 03:48:32,090
it can take a lifetime to discover the pairings and to master them but i can show you something

1454
03:48:32,090 --> 03:48:38,500
simple she raises a finger adorned with a wide collection of rings one made of green metal begins

1455
03:48:38,500 --> 03:48:47,620
to pulse but she does not fire right away she's giving you a moment to react run for the door i

1456
03:48:47,620 --> 03:49:00,059
gotta get out of here oh shit what do i do counterspell my spell of teleportation i have

1457
03:49:00,059 --> 03:49:20,809
already given you the clue as to what spell you need it's glue it's glue great glue that she did

1458
03:49:20,809 --> 03:49:29,190
it on purpose you weave the spell and toss the glue over your own feet you feel it binding your

1459
03:49:29,190 --> 03:49:35,020
boots to the floor the sorceress smiles as she completes her spell firing at you with her green

1460
03:49:35,100 --> 03:49:46,819
ringed finger you stare her magic in the face but nothing happens very good every magic has

1461
03:49:46,819 --> 03:49:54,069
a counter magic the enchantment of gluing matches the spell of teleportation your own spell has

1462
03:49:54,069 --> 03:50:01,290
evaporated as well your boots move freely once more prepare yourself she shows you an open palm

1463
03:50:01,290 --> 03:50:09,139
filled with rock dust hey can you stop afraid of them afraid of the ape save me ape that's my

1464
03:50:09,139 --> 03:50:26,170
counterspell faith that's my counterspell faith to the ape and it always works okay sand that's

1465
03:50:27,690 --> 03:50:48,969
quicksand that would be uh gale horn zen i don't zen's not available it's probably gale horn

1466
03:50:52,170 --> 03:51:09,399
oh wait hold on it could be wall so this is quicksand so floating would probably work

1467
03:51:11,319 --> 03:51:19,290
i think that's it yeah okay feeling your body weight shifting to a mere fraction of normal

1468
03:51:20,250 --> 03:51:25,370
just as bria's spell of petrification begins to take hold the two forces one turning you to

1469
03:51:25,370 --> 03:51:32,250
air the other to stone fight within you but with decreasing force moment by moment eventually your

1470
03:51:32,250 --> 03:51:40,090
body returns to normal yes indeed the magic of lightness is blocked by that of petrification

1471
03:51:40,090 --> 03:51:45,590
you've learned enough you must leave but not without a gift she slides the ring of green

1472
03:51:45,590 --> 03:51:56,969
metal from her finger and holds it out to you teleport ring take it you take the ring swiftly

1473
03:51:56,969 --> 03:52:03,479
and slide it onto your finger you feel a pulse through your veins i wish you well now be gone

1474
03:52:03,479 --> 03:52:19,559
okay now we know where two of them are oh i think okay it's in the it's in the present

1475
03:52:22,170 --> 03:52:30,069
yeah because this is uh i have this going to the past where even are we oh we all the way over here

1476
03:52:30,069 --> 03:52:46,899
geez return to the hut should i go back in no no no oh she'll probably kill me um what what's

1477
03:52:46,899 --> 03:52:58,280
over here let's just look it's a big circle you head over to the mountain pass look around you

1478
03:52:58,280 --> 03:53:03,239
glance around the wide pit of the old volcano but there's little to be seen no doubt the ash

1479
03:53:03,239 --> 03:53:08,340
mixed in the dust is what makes the forest you saw on the slopes so lush and verdant at least

1480
03:53:08,340 --> 03:53:20,440
it seems fairly unlikely the volcano will erupt again so this will take down through here where

1481
03:53:20,440 --> 03:53:38,760
this is where we started by the way it's here uh we need to go back in this way okay make a move

1482
03:53:39,739 --> 03:53:48,389
into the chimney okay you begin to plunge down the mountainside knocking and scraping the rock

1483
03:53:48,389 --> 03:53:52,229
surface on either side you close your eyes and your heart begins to move up your throat wait i

1484
03:53:52,229 --> 03:54:00,940
just jump off the cliff oh i just jumped off you followed speed a dead drop down the side of the

1485
03:54:00,940 --> 03:54:06,229
mountain the rushing wind snatches away your breath death is certain you take a moment to

1486
03:54:06,229 --> 03:54:22,969
arrange your thoughts do i die you're almost at the bottom the sharp rocks rush to meet you

1487
03:54:24,170 --> 03:54:28,409
then a few heartbeats from a terrible death your fall is suddenly cushioned

1488
03:54:28,409 --> 03:54:37,290
and you are brought to a gentle stop at the base of the mountain i landed you stand hearts still

1489
03:54:37,290 --> 03:54:42,950
racing at the bottom of the stone chimney quite amazed to be alive but there's no way back up that

1490
03:54:42,950 --> 03:55:02,600
you can see what plot armor i think it was her i'm going to assume it was her okay let's go back here

1491
03:55:02,600 --> 03:55:21,340
because i want to point this over here see what this was like in the uh in the past keep going

1492
03:55:21,340 --> 03:55:47,139
mm-hmm i'm also going to try to hit the bridge too with this i can sleep up here too which is

1493
03:55:47,139 --> 03:56:00,389
perfect i don't have any food but it's all right ah see the hut up here i wonder if it's worth

1494
03:56:00,389 --> 03:56:17,819
going back there back in the past there's a lot going on in the swamp i think there's probably a

1495
03:56:17,819 --> 03:56:26,340
serpent in the swamp before it became the forest but that's not what i'm going to do my goal is

1496
03:56:26,340 --> 03:56:37,139
to go like this try to hit this part of the bridge so it's complete so i can go across it

1497
03:56:37,139 --> 03:56:52,389
and at the same time hitting this needs to be complete because then i'll aim this one over here

1498
03:56:55,370 --> 03:57:09,020
na aim i'm good is that enough i think that's enough because then i can just connect these two

1499
03:57:09,020 --> 03:57:15,219
let's go for it and i'm going to teleport over here let's go sauron chop chop we got more reading

1500
03:57:15,219 --> 03:57:33,399
to fucking do i'm going i'm going um i need to sleep let me sleep first let's go sauron you've

1501
03:57:33,399 --> 03:57:43,860
not eaten your pack is empty that's all right it keeps reminding me of this even though i did

1502
03:57:43,860 --> 03:58:03,219
that like four days ago okay now i'm going to go get the ring what's the spell to uneat the

1503
03:58:03,219 --> 03:58:15,190
pack of ritz crackers i just inhaled um we'll just wait like 16 hours or so and then when

1504
03:58:15,190 --> 03:58:30,420
you're sitting on the toilet pretend to be casting a spell when you know that makes sense come on

1505
03:58:30,500 --> 03:58:45,909
dude what no they want to eat them again oh but i mean like minus two respectfully

1506
03:58:46,780 --> 03:58:52,219
grow up that's not what i'm saying that i meant like oh that's like a funny oh how do i like get

1507
03:58:52,219 --> 03:59:01,540
rid of the ritz crackers i just ate i don't know i thought like oh yeah to the stars those ritz

1508
03:59:01,540 --> 03:59:17,370
crackers come on that's actually kind of funny the wretched dung eater that's not what i was

1509
03:59:17,370 --> 03:59:24,969
saying and you know it don't put words in my elf or i'll ban everybody this should work now

1510
03:59:24,969 --> 03:59:38,170
slipped over the tip of the branch take the ring that's fine i can break the branch snaps into

1511
03:59:38,170 --> 03:59:58,299
the ring goes off disappears into the nearby trees that's fine it did not go into the water scan the

1512
03:59:58,299 --> 04:00:17,979
forest look down from the view okay climb down did it work yeah the undergrowth here is quite thick

1513
04:00:17,979 --> 04:00:22,950
and despite thrashing at the bushes you cannot see any hint of the ring that fell from the tower

1514
04:00:22,950 --> 04:00:27,590
it may not even have fallen this close to the tower base so is most likely at the bottom of

1515
04:00:27,590 --> 04:00:49,290
the marsh by now what unspeakable i'm floating you are not floating high enough to clear the

1516
04:00:49,290 --> 04:01:21,350
tangled bushes oh fuck off shit force field no no where how do i get that ring i don't know how

1517
04:01:21,350 --> 04:01:41,190
to get the ring but whatever uh i need to aim it this way just let it go dude let it go yeah

1518
04:01:47,059 --> 04:02:07,159
yeah all right i need to move this though i don't know i don't know how to do it the bridge is

1519
04:02:07,159 --> 04:02:52,780
successfully repaired kind of ah is that accurate hard to tell i can't get the ring i don't know

1520
04:02:52,780 --> 04:03:04,260
it's i gotta do something like very special and specific okay i have to kill the seven serpents

1521
04:03:04,260 --> 04:03:37,659
not talk to them this doesn't look like it's connected is it though it kind of is okay it

1522
04:03:37,659 --> 04:03:47,110
breaks up every now and again though uh i have to teleport see it's like broken up can i climb

1523
04:03:47,110 --> 04:04:06,500
this okay like can i climb up here climb the pillar here we go all right let's do it there's

1524
04:04:06,500 --> 04:04:24,260
no way up the bridge from here really i have to go over here then i can climb the bridge in the

1525
04:04:24,260 --> 04:04:47,420
past i should probably teleport to here and then walk yeah that is the past you could have gotten

1526
04:04:47,420 --> 04:05:03,860
a serpent ring in kare it's okay you can't get every item you can't get every single item just

1527
04:05:03,860 --> 04:05:09,659
to make sure i'm gonna aim this one over there too we're hitting this with every single one

1528
04:05:09,659 --> 04:05:21,059
looks like you're playing the elden ring map one of the first things i thought about when i saw

1529
04:05:21,059 --> 04:05:29,930
the elden ring map was that it looked exactly like sorcery and i love the style of this map

1530
04:05:29,930 --> 04:05:36,489
it's super mysterious like the little buildings are just kind of it's not like oh look at this

1531
04:05:36,489 --> 04:05:39,700
here's the point of interest here's what it is it's just kind of like a little hut

1532
04:05:39,700 --> 04:05:51,860
and you can go look at it i really like it a lot like for instance stuff like this is just

1533
04:05:51,860 --> 04:06:01,030
what even is that i don't know but i'm gonna go look at it oh yeah what is like what's this thing

1534
04:06:01,030 --> 04:06:08,180
i don't know seems like kind of like a broken down building i guess i'm gonna i want to see it

1535
04:06:08,180 --> 04:06:15,799
but it looks um pretty similar i love it so i'm glad it's here i'm glad they did an elden ring too

1536
04:06:15,799 --> 04:06:22,920
does skyrim do that does skyrim have a map like that fastest way to make me play that game

1537
04:06:22,920 --> 04:06:37,590
just kidding oh i have right i have to aim at this to get it to aim that way okay i am actually

1538
04:06:37,590 --> 04:06:49,350
gonna go teleport to that one you sound like you have a library card i actually don't

1539
04:06:51,770 --> 04:06:54,889
but the first thing you think of when you hear me talk is this guy reads a bunch of books

1540
04:06:56,260 --> 04:07:14,059
i don't know where you got that from it's almost kind of overlapping yeah it's overlapping oh p i'll

1541
04:07:14,059 --> 04:07:26,780
keep your leg right here all right let's go to the bridge finally it's time to cross into the next

1542
04:07:26,780 --> 04:07:41,030
area in the time between the sorcery streams i was able to beat sorcery one through four normal and

1543
04:07:41,030 --> 04:07:47,620
new game plus i love this game thanks for introducing me to it i am ecstatic that you said

1544
04:07:47,620 --> 04:08:08,489
that genuinely okay here we go at least somebody is finishing it um it's been 295 days since the

1545
04:08:08,489 --> 04:08:14,500
last sorcery stream before these last couple they've had a lot of time to play it if they

1546
04:08:14,500 --> 04:08:30,309
don't mean like in the last two days they mean in the last year uh i think it's safe here wait

1547
04:08:30,309 --> 04:08:36,649
hold on all right we have been through this area a couple times but we have an event here you stretch

1548
04:08:36,649 --> 04:08:41,129
out and rest suddenly all around you goes quiet the night air itself seems to still you hear a

1549
04:08:41,129 --> 04:08:55,959
distant voice listen you stay quiet and strain your ears to listen greetings in tones of voice

1550
04:08:55,959 --> 04:09:05,100
aged and self-satisfied i trust the backlands are treating you kindly as my fair city it takes a

1551
04:09:05,100 --> 04:09:17,049
moment to place the voice it is lorag the wizard of kare what are you doing here i'm here to help

1552
04:09:17,049 --> 04:09:24,780
as you helped me in my fair city you have a message in a language you do not understand

1553
04:09:24,780 --> 04:09:41,639
i may be of some assistance very well i would be glad of your aid in the marsh you were given a

1554
04:09:41,639 --> 04:09:48,819
parchment show it to me you pull out the parchment given to you by the goblins and you begin to feel

1555
04:09:48,819 --> 04:09:53,690
a strange sensation as if someone else was controlling your eyes moving them backwards

1556
04:09:53,690 --> 04:10:02,950
and forwards across the words that's creepy read you have little choice but to read yes

1557
04:10:03,590 --> 04:10:12,540
i was right to come you feel your finger lift and tap the paper it is most interesting indeed most

1558
04:10:12,540 --> 04:10:22,120
valuable the voice vanishes promptly what does it say but the wizard's presence has gone you are

1559
04:10:22,120 --> 04:10:29,290
quite alone once more and none of the wiser for it oh great you seem guarded here oh come on man

1560
04:10:29,290 --> 04:10:33,620
what did he just do he's you're gonna take that and what are you gonna do with it

1561
04:10:33,620 --> 04:10:44,100
typical lorag why would i yeah why would i trust lorag that was a bad idea lorag is like chaotic

1562
04:10:44,100 --> 04:10:51,579
neutral he's i mean he usually he's pretty chaotic evil i think sometimes you just got don't know

1563
04:10:51,579 --> 04:11:07,299
walled yeah okay well thanks for nothing lorag it's kind of a dick oh he's a he's a very he's

1564
04:11:07,299 --> 04:11:16,389
a big dick he's a super dick i would say that's a understatement the sunrise up so high is cold

1565
04:11:17,110 --> 04:11:27,780
you get to your feet here we go oh look it actually fades out i have to hit it as it's still

1566
04:11:27,780 --> 04:11:41,819
there you step onto the bridge the early morning sun makes the air glow keep going okay you make

1567
04:11:41,819 --> 04:11:47,049
your way under the stones of the bridge which form a broad solid path thick marsh we already know

1568
04:11:50,440 --> 04:11:59,959
yes we can still keep going gotta catch it the right moment oh come on don't do this to me

1569
04:12:03,540 --> 04:12:23,270
yes what the stones underfoot begin to disappear revealing a void below no oh come on i have to be

1570
04:12:23,270 --> 04:13:09,260
faster come on really shit that's very unfortunate missed it okay wait wait wait wait here's my idea

1571
04:13:09,260 --> 04:13:19,319
i need to wait and i need to i'm gonna i get a spam move on i have to wait till it's selectable

1572
04:13:19,319 --> 04:13:49,780
it's not it's not selectable for a second or two here comes where is it fuck you shit no

1573
04:13:52,020 --> 04:14:18,790
oh if i gotta go back and move one what's the problem here i have to sleep okay i gotta teleport

1574
04:14:18,790 --> 04:14:30,200
around i'll get there i'll get there i'll get it i'll get it i'll get it so then i guess this one

1575
04:14:30,200 --> 04:14:58,899
has to point over here how do i get the whole bridge to be intact i feel like i can hmm it's

1576
04:14:58,899 --> 04:15:18,780
probably i could probably get in the mountain somewhere too like in here or like down here

1577
04:15:18,780 --> 04:15:25,209
light up the end of the bridge and climb the middle part that's probably the right idea i'm

1578
04:15:25,209 --> 04:15:34,860
gonna go see if it's possible you have the beacons just wrong you can do it let's find out i thought

1579
04:15:34,860 --> 04:15:46,379
i had them in a fine place that was fine let me see can i all right if i go like this uh hold on a

1580
04:15:46,379 --> 04:16:12,299
second here watch this they're fighting each other that's why there we go so now that will be perfect

1581
04:16:12,299 --> 04:16:22,979
i have this the other one is aiming over here i have to turn that one away and i'll aim this one

1582
04:16:22,979 --> 04:16:51,049
this way um where should i point this we did this over here in both past and present i could aim it

1583
04:16:51,049 --> 04:16:56,860
in the this like marsh area yes this is probably a couple of events here that i have we didn't get

1584
04:16:56,860 --> 04:17:24,139
to this looks perfect now the only thing that's concerning me is this that's concerning me should

1585
04:17:24,139 --> 04:17:59,299
i be concerned i hope it's fine i think it's fine all right let's go very cool all right let's move

1586
04:17:59,299 --> 04:18:11,770
the third and fourth game they are a lot there's a lot of backtracking so this is not abnormal some

1587
04:18:11,770 --> 04:18:16,360
of the complaints of the third game in the third book series whatever you want to call it is people

1588
04:18:16,360 --> 04:18:22,729
don't want to do the go back and backtrack three times but i don't mind it i think the beams

1589
04:18:22,729 --> 04:18:38,229
they're going back in time and doing stuff differently i think it's fun all right move on

1590
04:18:38,229 --> 04:18:45,909
here we go yes finally gonna make it across the bridge i don't think this is gonna be a

1591
04:18:45,909 --> 04:18:55,500
problem i think we're good an eagle hovers above the valley waiting to scoop up its prey

1592
04:18:55,500 --> 04:19:06,180
i don't want to wait around for that you walk across the bridge a little light glows in the

1593
04:19:06,180 --> 04:19:11,139
east there are no handrails here sitting by the sheer drop at the edge of the road is a

1594
04:19:11,139 --> 04:19:17,510
starving looking man with legs folded beneath him and head bowed to the stone he is perhaps

1595
04:19:17,510 --> 04:19:26,709
asleep or drunk or dead let's wake him up you touch him on the shoulder and he sits up sharply

1596
04:19:26,709 --> 04:19:34,069
greetings well met spare a coin he slides his palm he perhaps does not have the energy to

1597
04:19:34,069 --> 04:19:44,069
lift across the stone what will you spend it on you ask noting his red rimmed eyes and two aged

1598
04:19:44,069 --> 04:19:53,959
skin that's my business isn't it i have to live don't i we talk very similar you and i here you

1599
04:19:53,959 --> 04:20:04,360
can have a coin use it wisely he nods thank you stranger all right let's get some info you open

1600
04:20:04,360 --> 04:20:09,239
your mouth preparing to ask the man for information to return for your gold but the words fail when

1601
04:20:09,239 --> 04:20:15,129
the beggar holds your gold coin out over the side of the bridge and lets it go it twinkles as it

1602
04:20:15,129 --> 04:20:23,799
sails out of sight that was careless what i dropped it i didn't fumble it i don't have the

1603
04:20:23,799 --> 04:20:33,799
shakes i'm not ill then why did you do that you demand somewhat outraged isn't falling wonderful

1604
04:20:35,219 --> 04:20:42,280
you should try it he chuckles perhaps one day i will i'm just waiting for the right weather for

1605
04:20:42,280 --> 04:20:48,409
it he lies down and peers over the side of the bridge at the distant valley floor lost in thought

1606
04:20:48,409 --> 04:21:09,159
you leave the man and move along the bridge what the hell was that okay here we are you've reached

1607
04:21:09,159 --> 04:21:13,319
the other side of the bridge in the distance the sun breaks over the horizon you have been awake

1608
04:21:13,319 --> 04:21:19,510
all night and are weaker for it from here a set of chiseled steps leads downwards towards water

1609
04:21:19,510 --> 04:21:25,590
you feel cheered by the sight you have crossed the horns of eclala now only the lake stands between

1610
04:21:25,590 --> 04:21:31,290
you and the road to high xamen this is not a place to rest do you still have some way to travel

1611
04:21:31,290 --> 04:21:39,750
before you are clear of the backlands and then some it's still serpents up here probably still

1612
04:21:39,750 --> 04:21:58,010
serpents we just need to get more info and down the slope that's where we will go next time we

1613
04:21:58,010 --> 04:22:11,209
have all of this to explore end of the stream some you guys just know it's coming um yeah my

1614
04:22:11,209 --> 04:22:21,059
stomach's kind of being annoying so i'm gonna go take care of myself you know what i mean i was

1615
04:22:21,059 --> 04:22:24,579
gonna get farther this stream that's the beauty of sorcery sometimes you just don't make any

1616
04:22:24,579 --> 04:22:29,459
progress well that's not true we killed the fire serpent learned about the time serpent we have

1617
04:22:29,459 --> 04:22:33,219
come across at least three of them we know where two of them are these will be bang bang right here

1618
04:22:33,940 --> 04:22:43,959
he just made that sound so dirty he's gonna go take care of himself

1619
04:22:43,959 --> 04:22:44,459
