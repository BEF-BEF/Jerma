1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:11,990
I'm gonna find Poseidon and kill him, apparently, and I've taken my boat over to this area. We'll see what's over here.

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,720
Who sets foot upon the sacred isle of horses?

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,079
Lord Poseidon preserves his favorite creations from the ruination of the world.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,760
To trespass here is to call down the fury of the master of steeds on both land and sea.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,839
Okay, uh,

6
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:32,280
This guy sounds kind of like a wuss if you don't mind. Whoa, shit. He's attacking me.

7
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,000
I didn't think it was gonna happen that quickly. Get him!

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,520
Yeah, you wuss.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,820
Whoa, he's running away. He's running away.

10
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,500
Pulling out my bow.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,219
I'm gonna shoot this motherfucker. Get me on this, get me on this goat.

12
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:47,939
Come here, you fucking master of steeds.

13
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,820
I'll kill you.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,539
So I do want to pop in here for like two seconds and explain sort of what's going on here post commentary.

15
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:59,700
I'll cut back to the live session here in a second, and it's gonna be a very quick video.

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,180
I just wanted to show that yes, that is me. I am the horse lord in apotheon.

17
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:08,019
It was a ton of fun to do the voice for this guy, even though it's not very big.

18
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,299
It's just a boss battle. It's just a little thing that you run into when you go towards Poseidon's area.

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,400
If you have the game, maybe you already knew this. Maybe you were like, wait, is that fucking, is that actually him?

20
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,799
And yes, the answer is yes.

21
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,120
And if you're interested in more voice stuff that I've been doing recently, if you're curious at all,

22
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,359
the link in the description is gonna go to an animation that I was in this last couple months.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,879
And it's not like a Cartoon Network or like Nickelodeon or something like that.

24
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,760
It's just a flash animation that I was happened to be a part of and it's in the description if you want to check it out.

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,060
It's there. Ow, my finger. I just bumped it. Ouchies. And that's gonna end this awkward post commentary that I've cut into a live video.

26
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,459
I don't know why I decided to do this, but I wanted to give some context and that's pretty much it. Enjoy the live

27
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:55,019
parts and bits of this video guys, and I'll see you all next time. Take care everybody.

28
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,620
And let's see who wins the battle of Poseidon's horse lord versus the Parthian guy. I forgot his...

29
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,549
I have to kill him on foot now? That's not good.

30
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,020
I'm just gonna throw fire at him.

31
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:19,099
Great acting. Good acting job you did there, sir. Whoever you are.

32
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:32,659
I'm gonna die. I really think I'm gonna die here. Uh, do I have any? What is this? I don't even know what this is.

33
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:36,259
I'm gonna drink it.

34
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:44,020
God, I'm gonna die. Maybe not. Can I craft anything?

35
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,900
I can't even craft any fucking healing shit.

36
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,430
Dammit.

37
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,990
Dodge, dodge, dodge. I can't get killed by me.

38
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:59,340
As me. That doesn't work that way. He only has like 30 percent, 20 percent. I should be able to get him.

39
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:05,180
Throw some axes at him. Blast arrows. We'll go with these. Oh, another, another steed.

40
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,060
Give me the steed. I don't even care about this guy.

41
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,919
Let's move.

42
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,020
All right.

43
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,539
Ooh, they explode. These arrows explode. Isn't that just nice?

44
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,460
I don't want to waste these. I have 22 of them actually. That's not terrible.

45
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:27,659
Whoa. Whoa.

46
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,599
Shoot him. Please hit him.

47
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,120
Oh my goodness.

48
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,879
Now my horse is dead again.

49
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,050
I'm just gonna spam these arrows over here. I don't even know if they're gonna hit him or not.

50
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,659
Controlling shit in this game can be difficult.

51
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,620
There's some regenting my health.

52
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,430
Get back to the spear.

53
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,430
The farmer's pick. Whatever the hell this is.

54
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,120
Fuck. No.

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,699
Don't kill me.

56
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,699
The hell. He's getting so close.

57
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,180
I still haven't picked up any nectar or anything. Is there any in my boat?

58
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,099
There might be like one on my boat and I still I didn't. Oh, I, I nice. I, I can, I can craft one.

59
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:17,079
Eat it.

60
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,079
Get these pieces of crap out of here.

61
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
My beef is not with you.

62
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,879
It's with the lord of horses.

63
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:28,810
There he is.

64
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,810
A couple more hits. A couple more hits.

65
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,579
Ah.

66
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:35,779
Ah.

67
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,569
No.

68
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,569
Shoot it.

69
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,009
Fuck.

70
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:47,509
I'm gonna come for you. You don't have very much health left.

71
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,389
One more little tap.

72
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:53,860
I've done this like four times now. I gotta kill me.

73
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,569
I got you, me.

74
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:01,930
Fuck you.

75
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,290
Fuck me.

76
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,290
Fuck us both.
