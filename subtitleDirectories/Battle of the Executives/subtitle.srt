1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,019
If that scumbag thinks he can take us on, if he thinks he's going to destroy our will and take down our pride, he has no idea what he's dealing with.

2
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:23,519
Sergeant Truffletop, you are my leader of the command unit. You must take it forward and you must find him and destroy him.

3
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,019
Puffleduffle, say hello to the missus for me.

4
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,649
But of course, who could forget you?

5
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:35,649
Ha ha ha ha. Bill Bowbaggins. Copyrighted character that I've just said.

6
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:42,359
Alright, when you're done with this joke, explain to me if there is anything else we can build.

7
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,359
Besides these drones. Forever.

8
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:57,340
And you, Anthony Wimblestein, you have been my number one companion ever since we were two. Remember we had that birthday cake that time? Remember we shared that birthday cake?

9
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,960
You have to meet me in the middle, like diplomats come forward.

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,960
Alright, so diplomats come forward, I meet you in the middle.

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,959
So stop having them following you.

12
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,959
They're not close enough. I'm not comfortable unless they're close enough.

13
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,959
They're going to start shooting.

14
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,959
No they're not. See, alright. Stop.

15
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:14,840
They're not stopping.

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,019
How do you make them stop?

17
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:19,019
Was there a wait? There's no wait.

18
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:24,969
Where are you?

19
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:26,969
I'm with my executive right now.

20
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:28,969
Oh, I see you walking.

21
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,230
I'm coming up on a secret mission.

22
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,230
This looks so stupid to watch you run.

23
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,560
What an insignificant little like shit you are right now.

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,859
I zoom out to like the normal view and it's like there's an ant coming to get me.

25
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:49,739
In this?

26
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,780
Yeah.

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,780
Stop building me hallways.

28
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,780
It's going to take me too long to get around this.

29
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,019
Just get inside of it.

30
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:05,700
This is never going to happen if you keep building sections.

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
You fucking dick.

32
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,699
This is going to take, you just added like ten minutes to my trip.

33
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,699
Alright, there you go.

34
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:19,699
Oh my god.

35
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:22,879
Well, okay.

36
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,879
Alright, here I come.

37
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,129
This is so funny that you could do this.

38
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,689
I'm coming to your corporation right now.

39
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,860
This is a gun in my hand.

40
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,379
Oh yeah, she wanted to see me.

41
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:42,650
No, no, no. Put the gun down.

42
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,650
I can't put the gun down.

43
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,650
Put the gun down.

44
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,780
You have like this shitty douche smirk on.

45
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,780
Like yeah, I'm going to shoot you.

46
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,780
Yeah, you think you got me in this.

47
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,300
What does your screen say?

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
CEO neutral login screen.

49
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,819
Why?

50
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,819
What did I do?

51
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,819
I got startled.

52
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,819
I got scared. I thought you were trying to kill me.

53
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,819
I went back, I sat down at the computer again.

54
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,819
But I thought you were using like telekinetic powers to try to kill me.

55
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,770
Your executive is dead.

56
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,139
What?

57
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,699
This person's not alive.

58
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,870
They're just not alive.

59
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,870
No, you're dead.

60
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,870
You guys are not even breathing.

61
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,870
You're just sitting there as a corpse.

62
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,870
Easy, easy, easy.

63
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:40,180
Why are you in here?

64
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,180
Your guy's face is so fucked up.

65
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,870
One of his eyes is open and one of them is closed.

66
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,870
You are deep in thought right now.

67
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,870
That thing has taken over.

68
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,870
You've done that too many times.

69
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,870
You know what I mean?

70
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,870
You've done this so many times.

71
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,719
You shouldn't be doing this anymore.

72
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:05,030
Where the hell did you go?

73
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,030
This is rough.

74
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,030
I have to do one more thing before I head out.

75
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,030
I have one more thing I need to do.

76
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,480
No!

77
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,939
What is going on?

78
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:26,459
Why is there an organ playing?

79
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,230
Don't look over here.

80
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,230
Whatever you do, for the next minute, do not look over here.

81
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,470
Did you just make a unit that is playing an organ of death?

82
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,029
No.

83
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:45,000
You can turn around in 10 seconds

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and notice that there's a monster behind you.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Really?

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,430
Yeah.

87
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,430
So you're telling me in 10 seconds I can turn around?

88
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,430
I would turn now.

89
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,379
Turn now.

90
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,339
You can't stop me.

91
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:04,339
He thinks he's so big.

92
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,339
He thinks he's so goddamn strong.

93
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,339
Do you think he's strong enough to take on the march of the C-3PO's?

94
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:10,339
I doubt it.

95
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:12,970
Oh shit.

96
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,660
This is a jack in the box.

97
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,660
Yeah, we built some hinges on our warehouse.

98
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,379
Hey, what are you doing over there?

99
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,620
Nothing much.

100
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,620
I'm just coming over here to kill you.

101
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,620
Yeah, that's fine. Just get over right here and stand right there.

102
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,620
Right over there?

103
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:52,089
Yeah, stand over right there.

104
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,089
What a waste of 500 billion dollars.

105
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:56,329
My grandfather told me

106
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,500
this is the button you press

107
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
when you know you've been defeated.

108
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,939
The final stand.

109
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:05,800
Activate it!

110
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,449
Let him come.

111
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:13,449
They killed themselves.

112
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,120
What is this guy?

113
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,680
I didn't.

114
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,500
I won.

115
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Well, how did you get out there?

116
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Help.

117
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Let me in.

118
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,120
I'm gonna let you in. Just be careful.

119
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,120
How did you get stuck out there?

120
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,819
He wanted to discuss something.

121
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:46,379
What did you want to discuss?

122
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,379
We're a military compound.

123
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,379
Not too far away.

124
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,379
You've been...

125
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:58,519
What did I do again?

126
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,889
You know what? It doesn't matter.

127
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,889
We were playing for two hours.

128
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,889
Two fucking hours of this!

129
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:08,889
What the hell have we been doing?
