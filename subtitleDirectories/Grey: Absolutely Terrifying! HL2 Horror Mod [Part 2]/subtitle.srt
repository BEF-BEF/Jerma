7
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,159
Yeah, there's my light. There it is. Oh

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,219
What about in here? The lock is jammed just like everything in this game every door is locked

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:09,989
Get out of my way. All right, what we got? We got any monsters?

10
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,420

00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:25,079
Don't cross what? Oh

00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,400

We should have said do not smash me. Oh god. What is this thing? Oh

00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:51,700
Hello lady. I don't want you to get me that thing's gonna stand up. Look at this thing's eyes, man

Seriously seriously now

23
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
This is not it. This is

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,759
Whatever. Let's just can I oh

25
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,520
damn

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,870
Can I please get me out of the sewer? Get me out of the sewer?

27
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,590
This is the worst part of playing in a game like this. I just don't know where I'm going. I'm so scared

28
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,069
I don't want to get that eaten by this guy. It's door. There's nothing's opening over here

29
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:45,979
He's not over here. Now. He's not over here now. He was sitting on this

30
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:53,840
What am I going out? Okay. I'm at least I'm out of that

31
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,840
Nonsense, I can't break into that. No

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Open this door open that door

33
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,719
What do you got in here for me anything? No, we don't have anything for me

34
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:15,060
Exit like I found the way out good found the exit. It only took me. I

35
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,979
Closed the building for the working hours

36
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:23,219
I don't want strangers walking around if you want to leave for something the key is on the top of my locker

37
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:36,389
The caretaker. All right. Where's this guy's locker? Where's this like dirty like gym shorts? It's definitely somewhere in here

38
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,150
No, not that way boxes break them

39
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:53,060
Where's this guy's locker? Oh, yeah, just like go find my locker in this deserted desolate place. Thanks a lot, buddy

40
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,400
That's just like trash

41
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:08,800
Whoa? All right. I'm cool with breaking all that so I got to go back into here. I'm gonna find this guy's locker. Oh

42
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:20,230
Great just a couple of vents this little place here

43
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,100
cool

44
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:34,220
Make sure you look both ways before you cross the street. It's my motto another one of these

45
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:39,980
No locker though, at least not in here

46
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:57,019
Maintenance is this the guy's locker? Yeah, I found your key

47
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:02,329
Found the key man, let's go back across

48
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:22,709
Cool. Is there anywhere else I can go over here? No, doesn't look like it. All right. I've got your key

49
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:28,879
Forget where that freaking door was though is over here and straight ahead

50
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:36,899
Right here the exit. I got the key. Don't need to read your note. Let's just go right out the door

51
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:47,060
Mm-hmm. All right, let's keep rolling here. Let's go up the stairs

52
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:55,279
Leon's furniture. All right. Whoa

53
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:06,110
Excuse me, mr. I think I'm gonna have to club you to death in your face because I

54
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:13,269
He's not here. Okay. Good. Good. He's probably gonna be right here though

55
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:24,149
So I'm probably gonna have to punch him in his face with my club my lead pipe can't open this door

56
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,410
For anything

57
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,250
Trash is why the houses are so damn cheaper on here

58
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,850
Really? All right

59
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,170

00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:48,519
Going through whoo more pills. I don't even know how I don't know what those things even do

63
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,459

You haven't seen a scare Saturday like this in a while. I haven't been this

00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:35,850
I don't even know where I am or where I'm going. I have no idea where I'm going where I am

112
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,070
What's even happening? I don't have a clue. I've just been

113
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,909
wandering around aimlessly

114

So yeah, I highly recommend you go download gray if you want to scare

115

The poop out of your pants takes a little while to get there, but it is here and it is here in full force

116
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:09,090
Is there a spider? What the hell was it? It's a spider on me right now. Oh my god

00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:17,610
I think a spider just landed on my shoulder

119
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,309
Really really you're gonna throw you I'm in this game right now. You're gonna throw that at me, too
