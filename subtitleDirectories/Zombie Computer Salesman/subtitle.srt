1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:15,849
Whoa! Whoa! Look at those monsters! Oh, this guy's a monster! Whoa! Whoa! Look at all these

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:26,120
monsters around this hallway! Whoa! Whoa! We have to get 15 minutes into the game, so hurry. Police!

3
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,910
Hey, police! Police! Monsters! I thought we just both were- This one's kind of good.

4
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,549
Mm, this one tastes like raspberry. Oh wow, I drank that in a second.

5
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:46,070
Oh, I'm drinking through my metal mask. Oh, what's this one do? This one's fruity. I like this one.

6
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:52,310
This one kind of tastes like urine. I love urine. This one kind of tastes like- What are you doing?

7
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,369
I don't like this. Fuck this. I don't like this drink. This drink's gross. We have to wrap around

8
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:10,780
because we're going the wrong way. Okay. And once we get- Wow. I really love this game on our new

9
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:25,700
Xbox One console. We're about to blow up. How far did you just like tumble roll out of an explosion

10
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:40,780
and we're fine? My Xbox One gaming console. Hey, drama. No, no! It's my joke! It's my joke! Get

11
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:48,459
out of the- Move. Hello, welcome to, uh, et cetera, et cetera, where we sell all kinds of great stuff.

12
00:01:55,269 --> 00:02:01,000
You just fucking steal something and run. Hey, welcome to et cetera, et cetera, where we only

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:11,419
have one item. A fucking garbage can! And now it's gone. Hey, welcome to et cetera, et cetera,

14
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:15,900
where we sell all kinds of et cetera. Wow, welcome to et cetera, et cetera. Can we get

15
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,860
in the fucking choo-choo train? So what? Oh, it's like a custom PC builder, man. Hey, come in here,

16
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:29,909
dude. There's just all kinds of custom PC units in here. Drama, what do you think about if I buy

17
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:36,650
this computer? Let me check it out for you. Does it look good? Let me check it out for you. I think

18
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,330
this computer, if you go over here, I got a great bunch of PCs for you. See, this one right here,

19
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,490
this one's got your name on it. This one has 32 gigs of RAM and this one over here, this one,

20
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,530
this one's got 42 gigs of RAM. And this one, I'm going to tell you about this one. This one's got

21
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:57,289
an Nvidia GTX 5200 and it's really great for all your computing needs. Do you email? Do you send

22
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:02,379
emails? I don't want it. Do you use the phone? I don't want it. Do you send emails? I haven't even

23
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:06,860
shown you the top of the line product that we have here at computers, et cetera. Come on in.

24
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:11,580
Whoa, do we have a top of the line product back here? What do you think about that, baby? That's

25
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:22,259
47 inches. So you're going to be just with the real, the sheer quality of the craftsmanship.

26
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:25,699
I can tell you right now, it's going to take a whole lot to break this. What the fuck are you

27
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:32,180
doing? Hey, I just, uh, I want to know, I mean, I know you guys don't sell these here, but, uh,

28
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:38,020
I mean, can I possibly return this? Yeah, for maybe a banana. Oh, okay. That sounds good. So

29
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:44,419
you get the computer and I get the bananas. The banana? Okay. This thing is so slow.

30
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:53,500
Bye. We're going to race. Okay. Oh, I thought you were getting in the motorcycle.

31
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,740
You fucking grinded me up.

32
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:16,120
Give me the other motorcycle. Oh my God. Come on. Come on. There's another motorcycle back

33
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:24,100
here I have to get. Fun's over. I broke it. What do you mean it's broken? He's at the half court.

34
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,379
Here it goes. All the people is cheering his name. The people screaming. It's going to get

35
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:44,339
Oh, a fan is come on to the courtroom. I am the king of the castle and I make all the rules.

36
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:47,699
My first rule is going to be, I'm going to be the karate master.

37
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,449
That was so bad. I, my first rule is I'm going to be the karate master.

38
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,769
Do not want to screw this up. Big time, big time, big time, hard time, hard time.

39
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,689
Maybe there's a motorcycle there. I'm not sure if you want that, but you can take it if you want.

40
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,449
I'll follow you. All right. You follow me. We're going to go to the markers. No jokes, no jokes,

41
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:16,009
no goofing. We're doing this for real. No goofing, no jokes, no goofs, no spoofing.

42
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:27,350
Good luck getting out of the house. I don't think I can. I thought this was the objective.

43
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,279
Come on, get out of the house. Get out of there.

44
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:45,779
Oh no, this one's going to blow up. Can we, can we do the game part of the game?

45
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,610
That's two cars. Is this your, is your motorcycle in here? No, that's what blew up the first time.

46
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:07,160
Damn it. No. God damn it. What? We actually just beat chapter one. Are you serious? Chapter

47
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:16,779
zero. It's the intro. Oh good. Very, very good. Skip, skip. Okay. What?

48
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:32,149
Give me the fucking broom. I'm going to spare somebody with a broom. I think that's the last

49
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:54,810
one. That should not be working. Get in. No, I can't get in. Onion rings. This guy's freaking

50
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:12,410
out. Holy shit. Yeah. This, these guys, this guy riding around in a fucking ultra murder

51
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:26,500
machine. Dude, will you stop this shit? We're like strippers now. Oh, you did it too? Yeah.

52
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,339
We're the fucking stupid police strippers. All right, let's go. Look at my shoes. What

53
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:35,769
are these shoes? Is that a fucking coiled up shit? No, it's a pretzel.

54
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:52,300
I thought it was like a big dump. Welcome to the job interview. Please have a seat.
