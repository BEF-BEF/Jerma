1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,660
I'm not thinking about like the numbers and ga... I'm thinking about like the conference.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,380
You know what I mean? That's all I care about. I just care about the Square Enix

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,699
video game live conference. Anybody getting hyped up in the chat in here? Anybody getting

4
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:25,480
hyped up in here? Yeah, I'm sorry. I've been drinking all day. This is just... I've been

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:38,460
drinking booze. So I mean like a big fucking glass of water IQ. Damn. Shave? Probably lay

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,100
after tonight. Alright, so we're gonna do one last break and then we're gonna do the

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,929
Square Enix conference. I'm gonna get myself in the right position. Let's get it on screen

8
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:54,570
just to have it here. That was MS-DOS stuff. It was fun. Glad we got to play some of them.

9
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,939
They were interesting. Now let's close this window out because we don't need it right now.

10
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:08,310
Glass of water. It's kind of peeing out on my intelligence. I bring in so many nutrients

11
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:16,939
and I just pee them out. Alright, where's that browser? We're gonna, yeah, T minus like 15

12
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:21,819
minutes, right? I can change my category again and not be like the guy that's sitting in

13
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:35,349
the wrong category. So this is, is it just, what's the, let's see. Is it Square? Twitch

14
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:55,859
like Square? What's like the actual Twitch page? Or is it Square Enix? Square Enix. Okay.

15
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:06,980
No, that's wrong. Pay no attention to this. It's wrong. I wonder if we're gonna get

16
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:35,909
anything good here. We good? Am I pulling it? Why not? It's weird. Is there a live feed

17
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:52,020
right now or is it not up yet? Let me see here. It should be up, right? Square Enix,

18
00:02:52,020 --> 00:03:09,639
there it is. Yeah, it's live. So where the hell is it? Well, finally. Okay, that was weird.

19
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:18,259
Alright, Square Enix is coming up. I'll be right back to pee. See you guys in a second.

20
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:22,180
Good evening. Welcome to Square Enix Live. No, no, no, no. I'm not ready yet. Please

21
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,099
take your seat. I'm not ready for this. The show will begin in 15 minutes. Oh,

22
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:32,870
alright. Thank God. They had a countdown on the screen too. They're going all out.

23
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:43,800
Feel like I'm watching a live stream. I am watching the live stream. Something in the

24
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:53,030
water today. What's going on right now? Something in the fucking water. I'll be right back.

25
00:03:53,750 --> 00:05:22,740
Where's the countdown? Oh, I thought we were going. What the hell's happening?

26
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:40,060
Alright, I'll go back into the E3 special event category. Square Enix. I can't wait for

27
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,300
Quiet Man to come back. We're not gonna get Quiet Man. They're gonna go bury that in the

28
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:57,240
landfill somewhere. 12 minutes. What am I gonna do for what? What do I do for 12 minutes?

29
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:15,529
Just hang out? Smart. Like, you're not getting that privilege back. There's absolutely no way

30
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:25,459
I'm gonna give that back to you. Tell us my favorite story. Jack and Jill went up a hill

31
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:31,300
to get a patch of water. Jack fell down and smashed his crown, and Jill fell down

32
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,740
afterwards and hit her head on a rock. Then they got up and they drank the water

33
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:50,250
and they were fine. Do I wear shoes indoors? No. Why? Okay. This is why I don't do face

34
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,209
games. I told you. Like, boogers almost just came flying out of my fucking nose.

35
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:01,100
Like, that's what we care about right now. It's like, oh, Square Enix. What are we gonna

36
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,980
talk about before the... Oh, AMD. Oh, right. Never mind. The markets aren't open.

37
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:14,180
This is what we talked about before. Conference. You have to act like we're there,

38
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,779
right? If we were in the audience right now, you and I together, we're hanging out before E3

39
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:23,620
and then here it comes. We got 10 minutes. Are you gonna lean over to me like these people

40
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,970
are leaning over and go, hey, do you wear shoes inside or do you just have bare feet?

41
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:43,990
It's like, what are you talking about? You're not gonna have that conversation.

42
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:53,579
I might ask you that. No, but you know you are. All right, I need to change the

43
00:07:53,579 --> 00:08:02,699
lighting here because it's Square Enix. What's Square Enix's color scheme? Red and,

44
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:21,540
what is it, red? Look, I am there. I get to pretend that I'm here. Good evening. Where

45
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,500
would I be? Welcome to Square Enix Live. Welcome. You have 10 minutes. The show will

46
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:37,019
begin in 10 minutes. Sit down and shut up. Turn the lights off. It's the middle of the day

47
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:55,879
still here. The lights are off right now. We came to the movie early and I hate when this

48
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:59,559
shit happens. I don't like doing this. I don't like coming to the... Oh, no, get to the

49
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:05,370
movie. Let's get to the movie early. Because you go like this and you watch the same

50
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:11,700
fucking ad about like three or four car assurances. There's nobody in the seats.

51
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:23,799
And you're just like, okay. Just waiting. And then you gotta watch the previews. I always

52
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:35,500
show up like two or three minutes late doing that. Talk to your friends. Hey, I'm not doing

53
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:48,870
that. Have I seen Elden Ring? Yes, I have. I don't go to the theater by myself. I mean,

54
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:57,059
whatever you do, you do. The last movie... 7,500 people watching the countdown. Yeah,

55
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:05,769
we got to the movie too early and it's going really slow. I was gonna say fast,

56
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:11,129
but that was not true. Best game of E3 so far? I mean, it's easy to say Elden Ring.

57
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,460
We didn't get to see much of it, but it's one I'm probably most excited for.

58
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:30,379
Best game that they've actually shown gameplay of? I don't know. That's tough.

59
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:50,419
Yeah, Doom did look pretty good. Either Doom or... I kind of do want to say Watch Dogs 3

60
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:54,419
only because I want to be the grandma. It's not about the gameplay. It's about the character

61
00:10:54,419 --> 00:11:06,230
that I get to play as. That's it. That's the only reason why is because of the grandma.

62
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:13,289
And that is extremely biased. They may as well... You could have the shittiest game ever made

63
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:16,649
and there's a clown character that you can play as and run around and punch people as a

64
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:22,730
clown. I would be... Right off the bat, I'd be excited for it. Just like, oh, I could be a

65
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:39,019
clown? I could be a grandma? That's fun. Cool. You just ate 500 grams of apricots. Well,

66
00:11:39,019 --> 00:12:00,539
you're gonna have diarrhea in about 14 minutes. Is it too red or is it just red enough? Your

67
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:11,720
face will look lovely in that golden frame. Dude, I can't believe I'm here right now.

68
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:19,559
I'm facing the wrong way. Am I on the stage? Are they all here from, like, looking at me?

69
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:30,470
Hey! Well, there we go. Now I'm in the audience. This music is scaring me. Well, it's scary

70
00:12:30,470 --> 00:13:07,159
music. Only five and a half more minutes to kill. Put that on your wall. All right. The

71
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:14,659
next... Every time somebody says Five Nights at Freddy's VR, I'm gonna fucking delete

72
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:24,779
one minute from tonight's stream. Good evening. Welcome to Square Enix Live. Please take your

73
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,500
seats. Wow! That's a lot of minutes. That's a lot of minutes. It looks like I'll be out

74
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,740
of here. I'm gonna have to be taken off after the conference, guys. Oh, and it's

75
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,940
about tomorrow too? Oh, you guys are deleting time from every... You know, I'm not even

76
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:58,070
gonna... Shit. What the fuck am I gonna do now? Delete the bots. I feel like I should be

77
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,870
doing something. I can't do this. I'm not very good at this. I'm very bad at just, like,

78
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:08,169
looking. I need to be, like, moving. Do you guys mind if I move around?

79
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:20,070
I can't look at, like, a countdown. We should have played Commander King for, like, an extra

80
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:29,580
20 minutes. What? Not Commander King. What the fuck is that game? Uh, Doctor... The

81
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:37,460
Island of Doctor Moreau, whatever it was called. I just gotta fucking move around. I just can't

82
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,309
sit here. I would be doing this in the seat too. I'd just be like,

83
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:58,809
go get a drink. I've already got one. Do a backflip. No, I ain't doing that again. I

84
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:06,490
gotta be drunk to do that. Three minutes of improv? All right, give me a topic. Quick.

85
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,409
Give me something. Give me something. Let me get a, let me get a setting. A setting. A place.

86
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:18,789
A place. A place. A place. Place. Place. Uh, okay, come on. Come on. Come on. E3. I got E3.

87
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:23,590
E3. Uh, give me, um... Give me a theme to E3. Give me a theme. What's going on? What's

88
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,549
happening at E3? Give me, give me something. Let me see if it comes up. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

89
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,990
Uh, a game. A game. A presentation. A game. Square Enix presentation. Give me something else.

90
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:41,000
Give me, uh, give me, give me, give me a clothing style. Give me like what I should be wearing.

91
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:53,899
Fancy. Fancy. Okay, we got E3. We've got a fancy clothing style. We've got a presentation

92
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:58,460
for a video game. Uh, and give me, give me an adjective. Give me an, give me two adjectives.

93
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:11,539
Boring. Okay. The boring. Stalling. Okay. All right, so we got boring,

94
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:20,039
stalling, E3, game, conference. All right. Okay, let's see what I can do.

95
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,559
Boring. Boring, stalling, E3, game, conference, fancy clothes.

96
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,500
Stalling. No, okay. Okay, just give me a minute to prepare. Let me see what I can do.

97
00:16:51,379 --> 00:17:18,089
Me, me, me, me, me, me. Okay. All right. I'm gonna, here we go. Okay. Boring, E3, conference,

98
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:31,500
fancy clothes. What was the last one? I should have done this joke two minutes

99
00:17:31,500 --> 00:18:00,339
before. Not three minutes before. Stalling. Right. Self. Go in the frame. Quick. There.

100
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:25,059
10 seconds. All right. Here's, here's like the here's your improv joke. Here it comes.

101
00:18:25,059 --> 00:19:14,779
Did it 45 seconds too early. Are they serving booze here? I hope it fucking blue screens.

102
00:19:14,779 --> 00:20:21,380
That's so mean. I'll be, I'll be quiet. Please welcome Yoshinori Kitase, producer,

103
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,500
Final Fantasy 7 remake. Are we ever going to see what this game looks like? I feel like

104
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:41,829
they've been making this game remade like for the last 15 years. Project, gotta speak louder.

105
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:54,309
I am very happy to be able to introduce this long beloved title once again.

106
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,910
After 22 years, the familiar characters we love have returned while becoming more

107
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:17,910
beautiful and captivating than ever before. To our long time fans, we thank you

108
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:22,069
for your support and patience over these years, and we look forward to embarking on

109
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,109
this journey together.

110
00:21:47,910 --> 00:22:02,230
Remaking Final Fantasy 7 has allowed us to dive much deeper into the world and its characters

111
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,150
than ever before. The game design was optimized for this title as well,

112
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,589
and we anticipate two blu-ray discs worth of gameplay content.

113
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:17,589
The first game in this project expands on the story of Midgar and is such an

114
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:21,750
elaborate retelling that it has become a solid standalone game in its own right.

115
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,630
Through the content we are about to unveil today, and through all that we have yet

116
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:46,119
to unveil, we will not disappoint your expectations. Your reunion with the Final

117
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:58,440
Fantasy 7 you know is near. To newcomers who never played the original,

118
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,759
we present to you a completely new Final Fantasy and a perfect starting point

119
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:10,279
to explore the world of Final Fantasy 7. Please welcome Neil Pabon, Senior Manager,

120
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,519
Product Marketing, Square Enix.

121
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,660
is a swing of Cloud's Buster Sword. Cloud attacks, dodges, and blocks all in real time.

122
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,140
His standard attacks do some damage, but they barely scratch the surface of Cloud's

123
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,339
true potential. Succeeding on the battlefield requires much more than just hacking and

124
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:09,859
slashing. Cloud needs to be tactical. He needs ATB. Two ATB bars are displayed in the

125
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:15,220
lower right. These fill up slowly over time, but fill much faster as Cloud lands

126
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:24,069
standard attacks. Once an ATB bar is full, you can enter a tactical mode where time slows

127
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:28,309
to a crawl and you have the opportunity to choose actions from the command menu.

128
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:33,269
Katase-san, I've had the pleasure of seeing you play the game, but tactical mode never

129
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:38,309
gets old for me. I could just sit here all day long and watch this beautiful slow motion action.

130
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:47,990
I think the audience would like to see more. Isn't that right, everyone?

131
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:55,900
Good point, good point. Well, once in tactical mode, you can choose to perform various

132
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,220
abilities, such as Cloud's Braver Attack. So you couldn't do this in the other one, right?

133
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:04,859
Using an item in battle will deplete an ATB charge, and if Cloud has the right

134
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:12,059
materia equipped and enough MP, he can use ATB charges to cast spells. Of course,

135
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:18,900
this being a remake, we're sure to see some familiar faces. The use of his iconic gun arm,

136
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,980
Barrett is able to target enemies at a distance. Barrett's standard attacks generate

137
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,660
ATB charges similar to Cloud, but his abilities are entirely different. Switching

138
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,339
between characters in combat is done with a single button press, which makes rotating

139
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:36,579
through party members a snap. Speaking of other party members, Katasia-san,

140
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:47,259
when are we going to see Tifa in action? Maybe soon. All right. Characters will continue

141
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:51,019
to fight even when you're not controlling them correctly, but it's up to you to choose

142
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:56,140
how and when ATB charges are used. You can maximize your effectiveness by switching

143
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:05,029
between characters or issuing commands to characters with full ATB bars. Every enemy

144
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:09,269
has a focus gauge that fills up as you do damage. When the gauge is full, the enemy

145
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:13,750
becomes staggered, and you'll deal bonus damage. Tactical mode evokes the command

146
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,230
selections from the original Final Fantasy 7 and allows players to enjoy battle while taking

147
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:24,309
the time to think strategically. For players who prefer fast-paced action, abilities and

148
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:29,430
spells can be bound to shortcuts for immediate execution. Shortcuts make combat extremely

149
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,630
dynamic, with the choice of using them is entirely up to you.

150
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,230
Have you ever played Final Fantasy 7?

151
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,589
That's right. The game has been made so that you can choose how to play.

152
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:43,190
I hope players get excited about this.

153
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:50,259
Well, that's a brief introduction to combat in Final Fantasy 7 Remake, and we look forward

154
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:55,880
to showing you a whole lot more in the coming months. For now, let's see how Cloud

155
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,359
and Barrett do against a more formidable foe.

156
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:04,099
All right, now show us Cat's Set.

157
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:36,980
This is more inclined to Final Fantasy 15, right? This is kind of how that game was played.

158
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:22,059
It looks pretty fun. Turn-based is really outdated now. Yeah,

159
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:41,509
it is, at least in a mainstream setting. No, it isn't. Not very many AAA companies make

160
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:46,470
turn-based games like this. What's a turn-based AAA game that's come out?

161
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:06,809
I wouldn't call Persona 5 mainstream AAA game.

162
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:22,440
Pokemon, maybe. It is now. Persona 5 sold a million copies.

163
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:55,059
It's a long fight. It's kind of cool, though. It's good.

164
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,299
There's nothing wrong with a boss battle. Boss battles should be harder, more interesting.

165
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:46,089
This is just a normal fight. I thought that was going the whole time.

166
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:57,829
I got to press the button, Crab.

167
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,470
All right, are we going to get a Cloud or Sephiroth cosplay on the screen?

168
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:26,069
Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

169
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:30,470
Thank you for joining us, Nomura-san. It is an absolute honor to have you here.

170
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:36,069
Kitase-san, how do you feel working with Nomura-san once again on Final Fantasy 7 Remake?

171
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:50,869
It depends. I might be interested. I didn't play Final Fantasy 15.

172
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,190
I'm happy to see that he's working hard on this game.

173
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,109
Nomura-san, please comment.

174
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:28,549
I've been waiting for a long time. Thank you so much for all the support you've been giving me.

175
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:39,750
This is the first time you've seen me play on the screen for a long time.

176
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:46,710
I think it was a little different from what I had imagined.

177
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:52,549
So first and foremost, we wanted to extend our gratitude to those who have been waiting so patiently

178
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:56,150
and have been supporting us for such a long time until now.

179
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:02,789
And also, we've taken a look at gameplay right now and we've fairly showed you a good bit.

180
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:11,829
So that's why I thought you'd all be interested in playing the game.

181
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:16,550
Would you like to actually play the game?

182
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:21,030
And I was wondering, do you guys want to actually play the game?

183
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:46,309
So we actually have playable demo kiosks available at the Square Enix E3 booth.

184
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,670
So I hope you have the opportunity to try it out.

185
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:10,150
What did that person yell?

186
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:17,429
So finally, there is something that we wanted to show you.

187
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,789
Yesterday, we showed you a short version of a trailer at the Final Fantasy 7 concert.

188
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:26,309
Today, we have a longer version.

189
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:29,590
You're giving me the trailer?

190
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,230
All right, please take a look.

191
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:41,159
Oh, this one already was out, yeah.

192
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:50,500
That's the popcorn.

193
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,260
These sewer rats appear to call themselves Avalanche, sir.

194
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,530
I'm saving my life.

195
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:32,420
You think he's a keeper?

196
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:33,699
Oh my god.

197
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:43,320
Have they shown-

198
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,820
Oh, red.

199
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,639
You all gotta look at the bigger picture here.

200
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,559
Nothing worth fighting for was ever won without sacrifice.

201
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:57,239
Not yet.

202
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,719
No red and no pizza, correct?

203
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:24,780
Oh, it's her.

204
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:45,679
Who's that?

205
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:57,690
Oh, it's Axel.

206
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:14,860
That's probably gonna be good.

207
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,500
If you're a big fan of Final Fantasy 7 and you've really, really, truly have been waiting,

208
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,780
you've been waiting for this for a long time.

209
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,619
There are a lot of people that have been seriously waiting for this.

210
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,099
It's taken like two decades.

211
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,329
And you get a motorcycle.

212
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:35,610
It's only like $64,000 for that whole collector's edition.

213
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,559
People are still screaming things.

214
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,320
A new chapter of Life is Strange?

215
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:21,260
Oh my god, this is so exciting.

216
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:24,219
Oh my gosh.

217
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:25,099
I love the setting.

218
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:26,139
It's so beautiful, man.

219
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:28,619
Time to hit the road.

220
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,659
I like the superpowers in the-

221
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,780
I'm not gonna give spoilers, never mind.

222
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,280
Sorry.

223
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,659
I wanna see what his power can do.

224
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:39,860
Come on, Daniel.

225
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,139
You got this.

226
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,659
He's starting to be able to control his powers.

227
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,739
What's going on?

228
00:40:59,059 --> 00:40:59,699
What is that?

229
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,219
This is not part of the video.

230
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:01,699
What is that?

231
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:02,500
What the fuck was that?

232
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,380
It's still coming out.

233
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,860
It's still coming out.

234
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,579
It's coming out of my nose.

235
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,719
This game is awesome.

236
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:06,900
Isn't Life is Strange 2 already out?

237
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,000
What is this?

238
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:51,260
Never did I imagine that it could be so bright.

239
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,780
The Terminator has asthma?

240
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,179
What are you talking about?

241
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,599
What the fuck are you talking about?

242
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:03,480
Keep the adventure close at hand.

243
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,880
The journey now unfolds on smartphones.

244
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:10,599
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition.

245
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,280
This winter, embark on a new journey once more.

246
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,320
Eh, no, that's fine.

247
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:15,820
Whatever.

248
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:24,949
Lead us on our way.

249
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:25,829
This should be fine.

250
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:32,730
This world is full of mysteries.

251
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,059
Kind of just a lot of ads, huh?

252
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,980
This game's out.

253
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,539
Now the true lesser begins.

254
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:47,579
The hunt is on.

255
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,219
This is the beginning, your end.

256
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:52,340
I'm just fighting.

257
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,340
This will certainly be the end.

258
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,500
My blade protects those in need.

259
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,619
This entire event is an ad.

260
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,420
E3 is a giant ad.

261
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:03,460
Strike you down.

262
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:08,329
This is our chance.

263
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:11,050
Yeah, this whole stream is an ad.

264
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:16,489
Yeah, but yeah, like somebody just said,

265
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:18,170
normally it's an ad for new stuff.

266
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:20,679
New?

267
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,550
That's why they removed it from Steam.

268
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:15,219
That was on Steam, right?

269
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:17,059
And they removed it and it was like a big deal.

270
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,940
Is this cool?

271
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,579
Let's find out.

272
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,789
Dragon Quest Builders.

273
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:48,710
The Children of Hargon, the vile cult that worships destruction,

274
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:52,469
has outlawed the building, cooking, and creation of all things.

275
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,150
And captured the builders.

276
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,710
All hope seems to be lost until you,

277
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,230
a young apprentice builder,

278
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,630
manages to escape the clutches of evil.

279
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:07,349
Washed up on the deserted shores of the Isle of Awakening,

280
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,670
and with the help of your spirited and mysterious...

281
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,670
This is a really nice looking game.

282
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:14,789
It is up to you to doth your mallet and club,

283
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,739
unravel the rules of this land,

284
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:20,940
and defeat the hateful Children of Hargon.

285
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:29,289
Travel the diverse islands and discover your true potential as a master builder.

286
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,650
There is a land of adventure with many islands,

287
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,650
offering unlimited building combinations.

288
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:38,650
You will have to master new crafting skills on each island,

289
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:42,010
with more to do and even more to create.

290
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,659
Everything in Dragon Quest Builders 2 is much, much bigger.

291
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:56,920
Build huge structures in a larger world with more variety and options than ever before.

292
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,239
And with a little help from the eager islanders...

293
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:00,280
This kind of looks fun.

294
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,800
The world is humongous, and you'll need your wits about you to get around.

295
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,760
Run across open fields and explore ruins.

296
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,079
It is, and it looks like it could be.

297
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:11,800
It looks like it is.

298
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,219
Die in watery depths to discover hidden treasures.

299
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:20,019
Climb the highest mountains to catch the sunset.

300
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:24,900
And glide home to rest up for your next day of adventure.

301
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:34,070
But beware, monsters roam this land and will need to be dispatched with cunning composure.

302
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:39,690
Luckily, accompanying you on your quest is the enigmatic Malrog,

303
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,889
an aggressive amnesiac with a fondness for fighting foes.

304
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:48,329
Use powerful attacks on the battlefield to take down monstrous beasts.

305
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:49,630
Yay!

306
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,239
Work together with your villagers to till soil, plant seeds, and raise a multitude of crops.

307
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:00,199
Can you do this in multiplayer?

308
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:05,719
Be sure to customize the way you build your fields to support the kind of crops you're growing.

309
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:09,079
Harvest anything from the humble cabbage and wheat.

310
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:10,599
This is speaking my language right now.

311
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:11,800
Tantalize any tasty tomatoes.

312
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,940
It's harvesting fruits and shit.

313
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,019
Big projects require big, big help.

314
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:25,079
You and three friends can team up online to build anything you can imagine.

315
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:28,920
Let your creativity run wild.

316
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:36,260
The only limit is your imagination.

317
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:40,260
So call on your friends and build your fate together.

318
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:49,929
The road you build is paved with peril, young builder.

319
00:48:51,449 --> 00:48:58,869
Only you can defeat the children of Hargar to destruction.

320
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,590
June 27th.

321
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:25,159
Luminary.

322
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:39,539
I've never heard of any of this shit.

323
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:51,750
I mean, I know Dragon Quest, but...

324
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:27,190
Dragon Quest 11.

325
00:50:28,469 --> 00:50:38,869
Dragon Quest 11.

326
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:44,150
Do I have to see the first 10 Jason movies to understand Jason 11?

327
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:25,510
Quiet, man.

328
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:29,989
They're going to show three frames of Quiet, man.

329
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:39,190
Or do they leave it off the list?

330
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:44,090
No, they don't want to put that on the list.

331
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:56,280
This is Carolina.

332
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,079
Alberto.

333
00:51:57,079 --> 00:51:58,599
And Carlos Mastretta.

334
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:07,139
We're a family of motorsport fans from Mexico, and we're the founders of Original Fire Games.

335
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:11,300
Over the last few decades, we have seen a fascinating evolution in racing games,

336
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,539
and nowadays you can drive almost any type of car on amazing recreations of the best

337
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:16,340
tracks in the world.

338
00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:20,019
However, we will reach time to try something different.

339
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:25,219
We want to do this by reviving a style that pioneered racing games decades ago.

340
00:52:25,219 --> 00:52:25,699
Bob Sledding.

341
00:52:25,699 --> 00:52:31,219
The game mixes top-down racing with a classic sharp arcade look and tactile driving physics,

342
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:36,099
which brings together a whole range of styles and eras of motorsport.

343
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:40,179
We are delighted to share this moment with you and show a sneak preview of our game,

344
00:52:40,179 --> 00:52:42,900
which Square Enix Collective will publish in 2020.

345
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,980
Join us for the ride and see you again soon.

346
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:55,849
Micro machines?

347
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,840
Reminds me of those little cars.

348
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,880
But you had the remote control and if you held down the button,

349
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,800
the harder you held it down, the faster it would go.

350
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,159
It would just fly off the track.

351
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,860
Is that what they're going for?

352
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:27,900
Battalion 1944 recaptures the core of classic competitive first-person shooters.

353
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:33,780
You'll need to quickly coordinate strategies with your team on the fly.

354
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:39,460
Whilst keeping your movement nimble and your aim precise if you hope to beat out the competition.

355
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,260
There are multiple game modes for you and your team to dive into.

356
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,900
Test your skills in domination.

357
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,380
Capture the flag or team death match.

358
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,460
And perfect your tactics in the highly competitive wartime game mode.

359
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,579
You know what this reminds me of?

360
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,980
Uh, like Day to Feet.

361
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,699
This competitive toolset is fully integrated into the game.

362
00:53:59,699 --> 00:54:02,500
Bringing world-renowned competitive matchmaking.

363
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,619
Day to Feet was fun.

364
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:06,179
Tournaments, rankings, and leaderboards.

365
00:54:10,809 --> 00:54:17,130
Kill enemies, win matches, and rank up to demonstrate your Battalion 1944 prowess.

366
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,610
And unlock visual customization rewards.

367
00:54:21,449 --> 00:54:29,900
Each season will bring challenges for you to complete and medals to unlock.

368
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,900
Whilst tracking your in-game accomplishments.

369
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,860
And providing you with an easy way to compare them against your friends by in-game leaderboards.

370
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:40,409
Come on Terry, Terry you can do better than that.

371
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:44,090
Hold the Axis Offensive in their tracks with the rapid fire PPSH.

372
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:47,929
Or take fire with pixel precision with the Mosin Nagant.

373
00:54:47,929 --> 00:54:52,250
And a whole host of new weapons just as deadly as their owners.

374
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,809
With a range of environments to test your skills in.

375
00:54:56,809 --> 00:54:59,449
And a variety of weapons at your disposal.

376
00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:03,130
Play as a team and compete to be top of the leaderboards.

377
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,329
They don't look bad.

378
00:55:05,289 --> 00:55:09,289
It looks like a kind of no frills just shooter.

379
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:14,039
It's already out.

380
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,639
Okay never mind.

381
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:28,260
No frills shooter.

382
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,139
It looks terrible.

383
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:31,460
Look I'm trying to keep an open mind here.

384
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,739
I'm giving you what I really think.

385
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:55,780
He is going to blow her eardrum out.

386
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:20,659
I guess it's...

387
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:23,139
They just added it to...

388
00:56:24,099 --> 00:56:26,070
They added their soundtracks?

389
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:34,860
Oh is this Mickey Mouse?

390
00:56:35,739 --> 00:56:38,570
Why is there no voice acting?

391
00:56:38,570 --> 00:57:00,920
Did that remind you of when they first showed that first trailer for Kingdom Hearts?

392
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,440
And it was missing music and audio files and stuff.

393
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,719
They're really not that great at making trailers for these games are they?

394
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:39,139
Quiet Hearts.

395
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,139
Kingdom Hearts 3.

396
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:43,460
Remind.

397
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:51,190
A developer could have just sat in and just

398
00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:52,630
gone like this.

399
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:53,429
She doesn't have voice.

400
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,219
Shadowbringers.

401
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,219
Final Fantasy XIV.

402
00:58:51,219 --> 00:58:53,219
That's like 50 weeks.

403
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:24,260
It's been six years since the release of A Realm Reborn in 2013 and over the years

404
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,860
we have surpassed 16 million total registered users.

405
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:33,300
Plus we have reached the highest number of active subscribers in its history before

406
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,900
the launch of Shadowbringers.

407
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,260
This is all thanks to our players, our warriors of light.

408
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:42,980
Registered users.

409
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,179
How many players does this ever need to have?

410
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:00,980
Two.

411
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:05,300
Play experiences that are comparable to a brand new standalone RPG title.

412
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,099
Over 9 billion served.

413
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,900
Over 100 billion capsules sold of our vitamin.

414
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:24,900
Bottles.

415
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:25,539
Capsules.

416
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:32,679
Skip this.

417
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:35,880
I don't have any master controls here to skip this.

418
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,599
We are excited to bring Shadowbringers as the latest installment in the

419
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:51,239
Final Fantasy franchise for our fans to enjoy.

420
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,760
At least until 2020 March 3rd when Final Fantasy VII Remake comes out.

421
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:01,900
March.

422
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:03,820
March.

423
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,320
We need the mind eraser from.

424
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:14,199
We are pleased to bring a world premiere of the launch trailer for Shadowbringers

425
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:15,079
releasing on July 2nd.

426
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:15,579
I'll help you.

427
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,099
God damn it!

428
01:01:36,739 --> 01:01:37,619
I did it to myself.

429
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:43,300
Square Enix.

430
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:48,389
What happened to Square Soft?

431
01:01:51,369 --> 01:01:52,969
Between realms.

432
01:01:52,969 --> 01:01:56,010
Time, space, war, and land in...

433
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:56,969
Holy shit.

434
01:01:59,909 --> 01:02:01,510
Graphics approved.

435
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:06,500
What O'Riorge saw was the future.

436
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:21,909
That's how the Zenitists came to be.

437
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:28,469
They were once living creatures with people that were caught in the path of the flood.

438
01:02:28,469 --> 01:02:30,230
I certainly do not know how to do math.

439
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:39,340
There is no going back.

440
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:43,420
The eternal light of these creatures has confounded us for nigh on a hundred years.

441
01:02:44,059 --> 01:02:47,739
For each we have put down, another has risen up in its place.

442
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:52,139
Born of the self-sane Aether relinquished by its predecessor.

443
01:02:53,420 --> 01:03:00,730
He's having another episode.

444
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,500
That's him.

445
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,739
That's Valkyrie.

446
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:12,219
Zenitists are part of Yulmur society.

447
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:15,639
But they must be fed with Aether.

448
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,199
Living Aether.

449
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:34,940
This world's beyond saving.

450
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:40,340
Like those who try to save it.

451
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:43,460
This world has had its fill of heroes.

452
01:03:49,929 --> 01:03:51,130
Wizard 202.

453
01:03:51,929 --> 01:04:12,789
He gave.

454
01:04:13,909 --> 01:04:15,989
What was it for?

455
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:25,900
I like that guy.

456
01:04:31,429 --> 01:04:57,099
We did for this moment nothing.

457
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,719
Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers.

458
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:11,159
And sacrifice.

459
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:14,679
The will of the star was made manifest.

460
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:15,480
I'm staying on script.

461
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:15,960
I'm sorry.

462
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,880
I can only assume I misheard.

463
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:23,639
But it sounded an awful lot like you were implying both Zodiark and Hydaelyn are not gods.

464
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:26,760
But they are gods after a fashion.

465
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,260
Yes.

466
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:34,309
The eldest and most powerful of primals.

467
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:42,280
I had no idea what was going on that whole time.

468
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:47,139
They like just opened a book two-thirds of the way through it instead of reading.

469
01:05:58,039 --> 01:05:58,539
Techland.

470
01:05:58,539 --> 01:06:24,159
Dying Light?

471
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:30,010
No this is um this is the other zombie game.

472
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,039
There are a lot of them.

473
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:51,150
No no no.

474
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:51,789
Dead Island.

475
01:07:07,179 --> 01:07:14,090
That was so different than the last Dying Light trailer that I can't believe that's the same game.

476
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:21,469
That was the parkour jumping around and flying around like that.

477
01:07:21,469 --> 01:07:23,070
That was they were two different games.

478
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,250
Say the funny line.

479
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,539
I'm not gonna say the line.

480
01:08:26,539 --> 01:08:27,020
Saga?

481
01:08:33,529 --> 01:08:37,210
No I don't want to be I don't want to be like the washed up actor at the fucking convention.

482
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:39,130
That everyone's just like do it!

483
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:40,569
He's like okay I'll get after it.

484
01:08:41,289 --> 01:08:43,449
Coffee, Cheetos, Chicken!

485
01:08:43,449 --> 01:08:44,489
Everybody screams.

486
01:08:44,489 --> 01:08:45,210
I don't want to do that.

487
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,840
The guy that just goes to every comic con and he has like the one line.

488
01:09:11,529 --> 01:09:12,090
He did it.

489
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:12,729
Let's go.

490
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:17,739
That's all you were here for.

491
01:09:17,739 --> 01:09:19,579
Time to get in line for the next signing.

492
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,079
Oh what's your name again?

493
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,000
Oh Gregory.

494
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,600
Cheetos and Chicken.

495
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,720
I write it on every single fucking person's pamphlet.

496
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:30,960
Who's your name?

497
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:32,409
Diane.

498
01:09:32,409 --> 01:09:32,970
Diane.

499
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:36,010
Copy Cheetos.

500
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:40,170
Enjoyed by fans the world over has surpassed 39 million downloads.

501
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:48,619
Now Square Enix proudly presents the international reveal of a new title born from the FFBE universe.

502
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:53,050
War of the Visions.

503
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:55,289
Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.

504
01:09:56,489 --> 01:10:03,210
These two titles FFBE and War of the Visions will be the pillars of the growing world of Lapis.

505
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:04,409
War of the Visions.

506
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:06,890
Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.

507
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:13,800
This is the story of Ardora, a continent of Lapis.

508
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:20,279
A tiny spark here ignites the flames that would embroil the entire continent in conflict.

509
01:10:22,779 --> 01:10:23,340
Conflict.

510
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:27,579
By the way guys the entire continent is in conflict.

511
01:10:27,579 --> 01:10:29,100
The whole continent, everything, everywhere.

512
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:41,550
War of the Visions possesses the power of visions as well as twin princes.

513
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:51,310
The great western kingdom governed by a policy of peace and its brave and wise king.

514
01:10:53,229 --> 01:11:00,890
Venice where the king of the savages has organized the barbarian tribes into Ardora's

515
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,250
mightiest militant state.

516
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:11,470
Weset the great eastern kingdom over which reigns its icy desolate.

517
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:15,079
How many more kingdoms are there?

518
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:20,199
Crystal Sanctum, a religious city-state with believers throughout Ardora.

519
01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:22,680
Founded by one who claims to be god.

520
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,960
Can't you all get along?

521
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,079
How many kingdoms you got?

522
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:27,399
Each burden with its own dignity.

523
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:32,199
Thus is the curtain drawn on a struggle in which the fate of the nations rests.

524
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:37,960
Is for one's homeland.

525
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:44,520
War of the Visions.

526
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,479
Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.

527
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,439
War of the Visions.

528
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:49,960
Now in development.

529
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,520
Final Fantasy Constant Conflict.

530
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:03,050
All right.

531
01:12:04,329 --> 01:12:04,649
Okay.

532
01:12:20,859 --> 01:13:00,319
Impressive.

533
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:02,640
Impressive.

534
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,399
Outriders.

535
01:13:11,949 --> 01:13:12,989
Welcome to E3.

536
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:16,939
Where all of our trailers could be any fucking game.

537
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,119
Close up of somebody's like burnt scratched face.

538
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:25,869
Long shot of three or four of us standing in front of different buildings.

539
01:13:28,859 --> 01:13:30,140
And laser gunfire.

540
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,920
Guess what it could be.

541
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,399
Who knows?

542
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:41,079
Please welcome Sebastian Wojciechowski.

543
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,760
Studio head.

544
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,720
People can fly.

545
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:56,569
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.

546
01:13:56,569 --> 01:13:58,329
I'm Sebastian Wojciechowski.

547
01:13:58,329 --> 01:13:59,609
Studio head that people can fly.

548
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:02,970
The studio behind Bulletstorm and Geese of War Judgment.

549
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,000
Yeah.

550
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,479
Any Bulletstorm fans in the house?

551
01:14:07,479 --> 01:14:08,840
Which one of these didn't cancel?

552
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:09,800
Wow.

553
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,439
Let me tell you.

554
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:11,479
It feels great to be here.

555
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:14,199
It's amazing to be able to finally announce.

556
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,399
Outriders.

557
01:14:15,399 --> 01:14:16,439
The whole person was happy about that.

558
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:19,680
Looks like Bulletstorm in here.

559
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,439
I'd like to thank the team at People Can Fly.

560
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:24,640
You guys are amazing.

561
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,199
And I know that some of you are watching this live.

562
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,239
Even though it's 4 a.m. in the morning in Poland.

563
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:33,279
So make a noise for them please.

564
01:14:37,449 --> 01:14:38,010
Thank you.

565
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:40,329
You should tell us to wake everybody up across the world.

566
01:14:40,329 --> 01:14:44,250
For the help and support as we work together on this exciting new IP.

567
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:47,210
You know over the past few years.

568
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:50,729
People Can Fly has grown to over 200 developers.

569
01:14:50,729 --> 01:14:53,050
And four studios across Poland.

570
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:54,090
The UK.

571
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,770
And most recently the U.S.

572
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:59,289
To bring you what is our most ambitious shooter to date.

573
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,210
To present more.

574
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:06,000
To present more of our vision.

575
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,199
I would like to take this moment to introduce a short video.

576
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:10,239
From our game director.

577
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:10,800
Am I right?

578
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,600
Bartek Mita.

579
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:13,039
So thanks a lot.

580
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,439
More on Outriders this winter.

581
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:16,560
Thank you.

582
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:33,289
Shooters are in our DNA.

583
01:15:35,229 --> 01:15:36,109
It's our passion.

584
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,319
And it's what we do.

585
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:40,600
Didn't your room get any darker?

586
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:45,720
Outriders draws on all our experience from all our previous titles.

587
01:15:49,899 --> 01:15:53,500
It's a game we wanted to make for a very long time.

588
01:15:54,220 --> 01:16:02,720
We describe Outriders as a dark model shooter.

589
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,279
Built with traditional bodies.

590
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:10,720
By that I mean we are creating an experience with a strong story.

591
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,439
That you can enjoy with your friends or on your own.

592
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,810
We want to tell a complete story.

593
01:16:17,529 --> 01:16:18,729
I already forgot.

594
01:16:18,729 --> 01:16:19,689
We are confident.

595
01:16:19,689 --> 01:16:22,810
We are building a shooter with a powerful gunplay.

596
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:23,689
Sliders.

597
01:16:23,689 --> 01:16:24,810
Incredible weaponry.

598
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:27,449
Long sliders what is it called?

599
01:16:28,409 --> 01:16:30,409
We want to spend many hours in.

600
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:36,510
It's a game we've had in our heads ever since.

601
01:16:37,869 --> 01:16:38,989
Outsiders?

602
01:16:38,989 --> 01:16:39,229
No.

603
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:45,710
Outriders is a one-two or three-player drop-in drop-out cop shooter.

604
01:16:46,989 --> 01:16:49,789
In our game you recreate your own Outrider.

605
01:16:49,789 --> 01:16:52,510
And journey across the hostile planet of Dino.

606
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:56,750
In search of the source of a new strategy.

607
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,310
It's a pretty dark and unforgiving world.

608
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:02,029
And yes there is a lot more depth to the game.

609
01:17:02,029 --> 01:17:04,109
But I can't say too much more right now.

610
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:13,039
Is William Neeson jumping over a fence or what's going on here with these cuts?

611
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,479
Come on that was that was that was fucking with it.

612
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:34,670
No gameplay unfortunately we don't get that.

613
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:45,770
Reincarnation is the foundation of our way of life.

614
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:48,890
For a second I think somebody about to make your room smaller.

615
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:49,930
How the fuck am I going to do that?

616
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:52,409
And offer up prayers for the next.

617
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,720
It is grief of death which shackles the living.

618
01:17:57,359 --> 01:17:59,359
And causes the dead to stray.

619
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:05,039
Indeed there is no greater affront to reincarnation.

620
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:10,640
So we turn our grief to joy as we send off the dead.

621
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:23,159
But the souls of those who held back their tears in life.

622
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,840
Still need salvation in death.

623
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,439
This is a new PS Vita game?

624
01:18:29,239 --> 01:18:32,680
A duty that falls to the Watchers.

625
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,119
PS Vita is discontinued.

626
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:40,199
The Watchers sever the bonds that tie the lost to this world.

627
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,239
And send them off to the next.

628
01:18:43,239 --> 01:18:45,000
They've been working on this for a long time.

629
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,199
Unfortunately the code was already there for this to be on the Vita.

630
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:55,180
They prize life above all else.

631
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:04,590
Looks pretty fun.

632
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:05,470
This looks pretty cool.

633
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:07,229
Alright everybody hold on.

634
01:19:07,229 --> 01:19:10,600
This is the story of one Watcher.

635
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:25,390
I'm not even going to taste.

636
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:28,859
That's the thing that sucks about a lot of E3.

637
01:19:28,859 --> 01:19:31,420
Like they don't even give you a taste of what this is going to be.

638
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:34,220
They just put the flavor in a fucking diluted spray bottle

639
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,699
and like spray you in the face twice.

640
01:19:36,699 --> 01:19:37,500
And then they run.

641
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:43,399
Does that mean I want to taste it?

642
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,199
Final Fantasy.

643
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:58,239
This is Final Fantasy VIII.

644
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,560
Final Fantasy Skate.

645
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:04,560
Final Fantasy Skate.

646
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:23,229
Final Fantasy VIII.

647
01:20:23,229 --> 01:20:32,270
Is this a, are we getting a re-release onto Steve or something?

648
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:41,460
This week?

649
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:57,869
Final Fantasy VIII.

650
01:20:57,869 --> 01:20:58,369
Green map.

651
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:00,109
Green map.

652
01:21:00,109 --> 01:21:01,310
That didn't look very green actually.

653
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:09,180
That looked pretty, that looked really similar to what it looked like when it released didn't it?

654
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:23,479
Well this, okay hold on.

655
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:24,199
This is the Marvel game.

656
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:31,739
The Avengers.

657
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:50,920
Thor.

658
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:51,960
Tony check it out.

659
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:52,920
At once.

660
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,560
Try to keep up.

661
01:21:55,239 --> 01:21:59,390
Who's the villain?

662
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:00,909
She's just got a whole lot more interesting.

663
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:02,670
Or is it a group of villains?

664
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:09,739
That was just a guy.

665
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:12,279
That was the pilot.

666
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:28,760
He's just.

667
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:29,399
Is that a joke?

668
01:22:30,199 --> 01:22:31,399
He's like a superhero power.

669
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:36,090
They got pulsar tanking.

670
01:22:36,090 --> 01:23:29,119
Oh shit.

671
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:30,399
Some say they were set up.

672
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:37,039
Others call them murderers.

673
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:39,520
Do the Avengers pose a danger to society?

674
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,800
That was the question Bruce.

675
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,560
That was the question.

676
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,560
Well why did Thor have a lowly Halloween costume on his chest?

677
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:53,880
That's not how this story ends.

678
01:24:15,229 --> 01:24:16,909
Well what are we waiting for?

679
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:22,989
Is it Galactus?

680
01:24:23,869 --> 01:24:25,600
Oh he's huge.

681
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:31,159
Please welcome Sean Eskai.

682
01:24:31,159 --> 01:24:33,800
Creative director Crystal Dynamics.

683
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,399
And Bill Roseman.

684
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:38,760
Vice president and creative director Marvel games.

685
01:24:50,029 --> 01:24:51,880
Thank you.

686
01:24:54,199 --> 01:24:54,760
We love you.

687
01:24:55,979 --> 01:24:56,539
Yeah.

688
01:24:56,539 --> 01:25:00,270
Thank you.

689
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:01,550
Thank you everyone.

690
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:06,029
We are incredibly excited to reveal Marvel's Avengers to the world.

691
01:25:06,029 --> 01:25:07,149
They look like they're gonna fuse.

692
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,760
I don't like this whole weird stage setup.

693
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,100
A few years ago.

694
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:16,380
The curtain's gonna go up and it's gonna be like a trans-blogger fire behind them.

695
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:17,659
Original Avengers game.

696
01:25:18,859 --> 01:25:21,260
One that combined epic action adventure.

697
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:22,140
They're gonna switch brains.

698
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:29,899
A game where we as players can experience in both single player and co-op what it's

699
01:25:29,899 --> 01:25:32,300
like to be Earth's mightiest heroes.

700
01:25:33,739 --> 01:25:36,329
Do I have any true believers in the house?

701
01:25:37,529 --> 01:25:39,770
Yeah awesome.

702
01:25:40,489 --> 01:25:45,369
Because you will instantly recognize your favorite superheroes and villains.

703
01:25:45,369 --> 01:25:48,970
But you'll also see that they're unique to this game.

704
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:53,210
As this is Crystal's interpretation of these iconic characters.

705
01:25:54,569 --> 01:25:57,130
Our story begins at A day.

706
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:57,850
What does that mean?

707
01:25:57,850 --> 01:26:01,369
San Francisco celebrates the opening of the Avengers West Coast headquarters.

708
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:07,850
And the team's custom helicarrier outfitted with a strange experimental energy source.

709
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:13,369
However the day turns deadly when an attempt to steal this new technology

710
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:15,770
results in massive destruction.

711
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:22,010
Blamed for the tragedy the Avengers are outlawed and our heroes disband.

712
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:28,189
Five years later a horrific evil threatens the world.

713
01:26:28,829 --> 01:26:33,149
And our only hope is to reassemble Earth's mightiest heroes.

714
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:40,270
You'll play as your favorite Avengers in an all new original story.

715
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:45,149
Showcasing authentic Marvel heroism and humanity.

716
01:26:46,109 --> 01:26:51,949
It's about losing what matters to you most and fighting to get it back.

717
01:26:51,949 --> 01:26:54,670
I wonder what the villain's gonna be.

718
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:02,909
I feel like he got that from a Hallmark card.

719
01:27:05,149 --> 01:27:07,760
That was like a pretty good tagline.

720
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:12,960
Most importantly this is a story about self-acceptance in the face of adversity.

721
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:19,920
About embracing our individual powers and learning that together we are mighty.

722
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:29,550
You'll lead the team as the legendary super soldier Captain America.

723
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:33,069
This is a work email I got like five years ago.

724
01:27:33,069 --> 01:27:37,149
You'll call down the lightning as the Asgardian god of thunder Thor.

725
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:45,039
You'll channel the anger of scientist Bruce Banner by unleashing the Hulk.

726
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:53,359
You'll gather intel and strike swiftly as the ultimate tactical spy Black Widow.

727
01:27:55,579 --> 01:28:00,939
And finally you'll blast through the sky as a charismatic Tony Stark.

728
01:28:01,899 --> 01:28:06,060
Known to the wider world as the armored iron man.

729
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:15,069
To bring this incredible story to life we've assembled an all-star cast.

730
01:28:16,189 --> 01:28:18,029
I'll let them introduce themselves.

731
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:27,199
Here they come Robert Downey Jr.

732
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:28,399
So here we are.

733
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:29,439
Avengers assembled.

734
01:28:30,079 --> 01:28:30,800
Chris Evans.

735
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,760
Who are you people again?

736
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:37,359
Hi I'm Troy Baker and I play Bruce Banner.

737
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:40,479
Hi I'm Jeff Schein and I play Captain America.

738
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:43,039
Hi I'm Travis Willingham and I play Thor.

739
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,840
Hi I'm Laura Bailey and I'm playing Black Widow.

740
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,119
Hi I'm Nolan North and I play Tony Stark.

741
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:53,039
There's certain characters I don't think you ever have to be uh talked into.

742
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,319
You know so we'd like to have you play Tony Stark Iron Man.

743
01:28:56,319 --> 01:28:56,800
Yeah yes.

744
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,359
We are we are the Avengers of voice acting.

745
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:02,880
We're in every fucking single game.

746
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,520
We are the Avengers of voice acting and games.

747
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,840
I think he's one of the most vulnerable guys.

748
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,199
I think Bruce is just such a cool character.

749
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:14,880
A lot of people are really quick to bring out the big green

750
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:19,840
but I think that that Bruce is a super complex character.

751
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,000
He's fun and I've never played him before.

752
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,640
What is very relatable about Natasha is she's extremely capable

753
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,279
but she's at the core she's human.

754
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:34,079
She's surrounded by all of this larger than life stuff

755
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:36,560
and she has to step up to it.

756
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,880
I feel like Thor got really interesting in the last like 10 or 15 years from for me.

757
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,880
I like where he's kind of landed in the public eye you know.

758
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:49,359
One of the things I think is cool about Cap is I never feel like he uh

759
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:51,760
he necessarily wants to be a leader.

760
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:52,960
He accepts that he is.

761
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,920
I feel like sometimes the best leaders are the ones who don't necessarily want to be

762
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,600
but they're right for the job.

763
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,439
Having an original story to tell as well

764
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,720
what they've done at Crystal Dynamics is great so

765
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,880
I think everybody's gonna be pretty stoked.

766
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,520
The Avengers are at their best when they are all together

767
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:11,279
but the chemistry is do not shake.

768
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,199
Thanks everybody for joining us.

769
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:16,800
Can't wait for you to be able to play the game

770
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,399
but right now you don't have to wait for some exclusive content.

771
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:21,920
By the way it's me.

772
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,760
I sound like exactly the guy on the other side

773
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,359
but it's not him it's me talking now.

774
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:27,920
When he talks it sounds like me talking.

775
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,399
Do the Avengers pose a danger to society?

776
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:31,600
That was the question Bruce.

777
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:33,439
That was the question.

778
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,760
Did you even check the science?

779
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,039
It was a heist Bruce.

780
01:30:39,039 --> 01:30:39,279
No.

781
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:40,399
We were outsmarted.

782
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:44,720
The Terrigen reactor was unstable and you knew that you knew that

783
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:47,439
and you still paraded it before the entire world.

784
01:30:47,439 --> 01:30:48,079
So what?

785
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:48,960
We just give up.

786
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,199
We didn't give up Tony.

787
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:52,479
We failed.

788
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:54,720
At least I can admit that.

789
01:30:58,279 --> 01:30:59,960
We failed him.

790
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:02,329
We failed him.

791
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:06,859
Who's him?

792
01:31:06,859 --> 01:31:12,060
Please welcome Scott Amis, head of studio and Megan Marie,

793
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:15,819
senior community and social media manager Crystal Dynamics.

794
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:26,760
This game might be pretty good.

795
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:27,720
Hello E3.

796
01:31:33,659 --> 01:31:37,020
You've just seen a high level view of the cinematic

797
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:40,140
and character-driven campaign of Marvel's Avengers

798
01:31:40,699 --> 01:31:44,220
but launch is only the beginning of this adventure.

799
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:48,619
Marvel's Avengers delivers a narrative over multiple years

800
01:31:48,619 --> 01:31:51,579
with exciting new content released at a regular basis.

801
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:56,619
Like the Avengers, you and your friends are stronger together.

802
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:01,340
You'll assemble into teams of up to four players online

803
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:06,680
where you can master extraordinary abilities,

804
01:32:07,319 --> 01:32:11,000
where you can customize a growing roster of heroes

805
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,560
and defend the earth from ever-escalating threats.

806
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,319
Oh, yes.

807
01:32:15,319 --> 01:32:16,279
Oh, yes.

808
01:32:17,319 --> 01:32:20,760
And to make sure everyone on this journey with us,

809
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,840
we're incredibly thrilled to announce

810
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:26,520
that every new superhero and every new region

811
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,680
will be delivered at no additional cost.

812
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:40,279
Our promise to the community

813
01:32:40,279 --> 01:32:42,520
is that we won't have random loot boxes

814
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,960
or pay-to-win scenarios.

815
01:32:45,319 --> 01:32:49,310
I love how that's such a selling point now.

816
01:32:49,869 --> 01:32:51,550
This game represents a collaboration across Crystal Dynamics.

817
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:53,869
It's like going to the fucking dentist.

818
01:32:54,029 --> 01:32:55,310
And he's like, let me tell you something.

819
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:57,630
I promise not to use the drill on your eye.

820
01:32:59,100 --> 01:32:59,659
Oh, thanks.

821
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:00,380
I love Montreal.

822
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:01,100
These guys are here.

823
01:33:02,729 --> 01:33:07,470
Nixie Software, our new Crystal Northwest studio

824
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:10,649
and everyone at Square Enix.

825
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:18,520
So our game is about embracing your powers

826
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,439
and living your superhero dreams.

827
01:33:20,439 --> 01:33:22,600
It's bad when the other dentists do that.

828
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,560
We have an exclusive game play demo in our booth

829
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:26,439
that will show you more of the core campaign.

830
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:28,039
It's original story.

831
01:33:28,039 --> 01:33:29,800
This would be $5 per stamp.

832
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,119
So Marvel's Avengers will release worldwide

833
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:43,119
on PS4, Xbox One, Stadia, and PC.

834
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:43,619
When?

835
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:46,670
We got you covered.

836
01:33:47,869 --> 01:33:50,670
And we're excited to be partnering with PlayStation

837
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:53,069
to bring some awesome surprises

838
01:33:53,069 --> 01:33:54,270
to the PlayStation audience.

839
01:33:55,979 --> 01:33:58,060
Google may as well just pull the fucking zipper

840
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:59,180
off the top of the ceiling

841
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:00,140
and drop the fucking money.

842
01:34:01,850 --> 01:34:02,569
They want it.

843
01:34:02,569 --> 01:34:04,010
They want you on there.

844
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:05,289
That will be revealing in the future.

845
01:34:05,289 --> 01:34:07,449
Just sprinkle it across the whole crowd.

846
01:34:08,779 --> 01:34:09,739
But before we go,

847
01:34:10,699 --> 01:34:13,020
we have one final glimpse into our world,

848
01:34:13,899 --> 01:34:16,539
including when you'll get to play this game.

849
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:22,060
This is what's next for the Avengers.

850
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,260
Thank you, true believers.

851
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:26,399
We're going to release date?

852
01:34:29,689 --> 01:34:30,189
Damn it.

853
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:34,960
I have a plan, but it's risky.

854
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:38,319
Hank, that doesn't look ready.

855
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:39,680
Come on, Tony, live a little.

856
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:49,550
Unbelievable.

857
01:34:50,189 --> 01:34:50,689
It worked.

858
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:53,180
Hank?

859
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:56,680
It's sort of cute when they're small.

860
01:34:57,899 --> 01:34:59,899
Ah, I didn't doubt you for a second, Hank.

861
01:35:01,659 --> 01:35:14,649
Release date, come on.

862
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,079
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes.

863
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:50,060
Whoa, whoa, I don't agree to any of that shit.

864
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:50,939
I don't agree to that.

865
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,710
I didn't agree to this.

866
01:35:54,350 --> 01:36:06,409
Hey, thanks for watching the show.

867
01:36:06,409 --> 01:36:08,409
All right, I'll tell you, I'll tell you one thing.

868
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:14,590
I, Final Fantasy VII was kind of cool.

869
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,000
I'm really not interested in, like,

870
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,760
anything else that was shown today or here.

871
01:36:19,319 --> 01:36:25,210
Final Fantasy VII looks pretty good.

872
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:27,689
I'm not really into really any of the other stuff.

873
01:36:27,689 --> 01:36:36,520
The Dragon Quest building game looked kind of fun.

874
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,199
May 15th, you idiot.

875
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:49,079
Respect the streamer!

876
01:36:49,079 --> 01:36:54,119
So, uh, play the first one.

877
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,680
I really am, like, in a dark corner, huh?

878
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:03,149
E3 was pretty, pretty bad this year.

879
01:37:03,149 --> 01:37:10,750
Am I going to do Nintendo tomorrow?

880
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:12,350
I don't know, I don't think so.

881
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:15,869
Because, let me, let's get like a,

882
01:37:15,869 --> 01:37:17,229
it really is dark in here.

883
01:37:17,229 --> 01:37:22,939
Let's, let's figure out what's going to happen.

884
01:37:22,939 --> 01:37:24,699
I don't think I'm going to do Nintendo tomorrow.

885
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:30,649
Because Nintendo really is only like,

886
01:37:30,649 --> 01:37:32,010
what, like 45 minutes?

887
01:37:32,569 --> 01:37:34,010
It's an edited thing.

888
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:34,890
I'm not sure I'm going to do it.

889
01:37:35,449 --> 01:37:36,250
I didn't do Devolver.

890
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:37,369
I kind of, I'd rather just watch, like,

891
01:37:37,369 --> 01:37:39,449
the 40 to 50 minute presentation, whatever it is.

892
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,079
It's just for, like, Smash.

893
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:45,279
It's probably going to be Smash and

894
01:37:48,039 --> 01:37:50,199
shows up for Bethesda and Square and Ubi,

895
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:51,800
but won't do Nintendo.

896
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:57,100
Oh, this is about to, like, turn off.

897
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:09,869
Show it up for AMD, but won't show up for Nintendo.

898
01:38:11,949 --> 01:38:13,869
Yeah, but come on.

899
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:22,779
I didn't do Nintendo last year.

900
01:38:22,779 --> 01:38:24,060
Did I do Nintendo last year?

901
01:38:24,619 --> 01:38:25,100
I didn't.

902
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,079
I did Nintendo last year.

903
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:35,069
All right.

904
01:38:35,069 --> 01:38:35,470
All right.

905
01:38:35,470 --> 01:38:36,109
I'll do Nintendo.

906
01:38:36,109 --> 01:38:36,829
We'll do, all right.

907
01:38:36,829 --> 01:38:37,630
I'll do Nintendo.

908
01:38:37,630 --> 01:38:38,590
I'm going to do Nintendo.

909
01:38:39,149 --> 01:38:39,550
You're here?

910
01:38:39,550 --> 01:38:40,829
I just confirmed it.

911
01:38:40,829 --> 01:38:42,189
It didn't last, all right.

912
01:38:42,189 --> 01:38:43,869
I'll do, all right, all right, all right.

913
01:38:43,869 --> 01:38:47,119
Tomorrow, tomorrow is going to be a quick one though.

914
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:47,920
Tomorrow I'm going to do,

915
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,289
it's going to be a short stream tomorrow.

916
01:38:51,289 --> 01:38:52,409
It's at 9 a.m.?

917
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:56,699
Oh, fuck no.

918
01:38:56,699 --> 01:38:58,060
It's at 9 a.m. Pacific?

919
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:58,699
No, it's not.

920
01:39:03,609 --> 01:39:04,890
I ain't waking up for that one.

921
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:05,369
I'll try.

922
01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:10,590
I'm going to, I'm going to, okay.

923
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:11,390
I'm going to, I'll tell you,

924
01:39:11,390 --> 01:39:12,270
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

925
01:39:15,399 --> 01:39:17,239
I will tear myself out of bed.

926
01:39:18,039 --> 01:39:19,800
I will, I will rip myself out of bed

927
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,720
and like fucking get over here in a bathrobe

928
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:24,640
and stream for an hour.

929
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:25,199
That's the plan.

930
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:25,760
That's what I'm doing.

931
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,579
You can't get up by 9.

932
01:39:32,109 --> 01:39:34,829
No, it's not that I can't get up by 9.

933
01:39:34,829 --> 01:39:38,029
It's that when your body is so used to waking up

934
01:39:38,029 --> 01:39:41,069
at like fucking 11, 12, 1 p.m.

935
01:39:41,069 --> 01:39:41,789
I wake up late.

936
01:39:41,789 --> 01:39:42,670
I go to bed late.

937
01:39:44,859 --> 01:39:45,979
It's hard to get up at like 8.

938
01:39:45,979 --> 01:39:47,899
I don't, I'm not waking up at 9.

939
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:49,739
I'd have to get up at like 7.30.

940
01:39:49,739 --> 01:39:51,180
I got to go to the bathroom.

941
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,140
I've got to eat food.

942
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:53,020
I've got to shower.

943
01:39:53,659 --> 01:39:54,859
It takes like an hour and a half.

944
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:56,859
I'm going to wake up at like 6.

945
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,760
The big boy sleeps late.

946
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:06,520
No, we'll do it.

947
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:07,079
I'll get up.

948
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:07,399
I'll do it.

949
01:40:07,399 --> 01:40:08,359
I'm going to look like shit.

950
01:40:08,359 --> 01:40:09,399
I'm not going to be like fucking,

951
01:40:10,359 --> 01:40:11,159
I'm going to look terrible.

952
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:12,199
I'm going to be unshowered.

953
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:14,569
I'm going to be unshowered, unshit,

954
01:40:15,130 --> 01:40:16,250
and like unshaved.

955
01:40:19,479 --> 01:40:20,760
So I hope you're ready for that stream.

956
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,800
By the way, that stream is going to be

957
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,399
literally fucking an hour and 30 minutes.

958
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,779
We ain't doing a long one tomorrow.

959
01:40:26,779 --> 01:40:28,060
I'm going to just go back to bed.

960
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:32,649
I'm going to watch the Nintendo conference,

961
01:40:32,649 --> 01:40:35,210
give you my like terrible dog shit takes,

962
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:36,250
and then I'm going to go to bed.

963
01:40:38,489 --> 01:40:39,289
No makeup.

964
01:40:39,289 --> 01:40:40,970
Yeah, no makeup involved tomorrow.

965
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:47,560
Lazy boy.

966
01:40:51,449 --> 01:40:54,729
Guys, do you understand how bad my takes are

967
01:40:54,729 --> 01:40:55,289
for these things?

968
01:40:56,010 --> 01:40:58,560
Persona 5, not even like a mainstream game.

969
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,479
It only sold like millions of copies.

970
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:03,760
But Final Fantasy VII, who's that character?

971
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:04,260
Axel?

972
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:05,680
I don't know shit.

973
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:09,020
I know two things.

974
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:12,640
How to remove a wart.

975
01:41:13,279 --> 01:41:16,600
You put, I know how to remove a wart.

976
01:41:17,869 --> 01:41:20,239
And the best way to clean the toilet.

977
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:22,319
I don't know anything else.

978
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:23,439
I know about conflict.

979
01:41:25,319 --> 01:41:25,880
You freeze it.

980
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:26,760
You get a little freeze thing.

981
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:29,420
You're like, I just did it like a week ago.

982
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:30,140
I had like 12.

983
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:32,060
I had like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

984
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:32,619
They were all over me.

985
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:37,020
I keep like breathing in frogs and I can't stop.

986
01:41:39,979 --> 01:41:41,260
They're all over my hands.

987
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:42,619
I have like 25 frog pets.

988
01:41:42,619 --> 01:41:43,100
They're the best.

989
01:41:43,739 --> 01:41:52,319
How do you clean a toilet?

990
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,340
Wouldn't you like to know?

991
01:41:55,899 --> 01:41:59,340
What's your secret to removing warts?

992
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:02,670
You have to get the witch to come over

993
01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:03,789
and fucking de-curse you.

994
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:07,500
You lick the bowl.

995
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:09,340
You guys are fucked.

996
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:18,300
Hey, skip this guy talk.

997
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:19,420
Where's the next trailer?

998
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:20,699
Where's the next E3 trailer?

999
01:42:20,699 --> 01:42:21,500
This guy sucks.

1000
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:26,939
All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1001
01:42:26,939 --> 01:42:27,819
I'm going to wake up.

1002
01:42:27,819 --> 01:42:28,779
I'm going to get up and I'm going to,

1003
01:42:28,779 --> 01:42:29,579
it's going to be painful.

1004
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:31,979
I'm going to, you're going to see me

1005
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:33,100
at my absolute worst.

1006
01:42:33,819 --> 01:42:34,319
Okay?

1007
01:42:35,819 --> 01:42:36,619
When I'm going to turn,

1008
01:42:36,619 --> 01:42:37,979
I'm going to rip myself out of bed

1009
01:42:37,979 --> 01:42:40,359
and I'm going to press the stream button.

1010
01:42:40,359 --> 01:42:41,720
You, it's going to be me

1011
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:44,840
at the very, very base level of person.

1012
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:45,800
Like it's just going to be me.

1013
01:42:51,210 --> 01:42:52,489
I forgot about five nights at Freddy's.

1014
01:42:53,369 --> 01:42:54,489
Well, that person just removed

1015
01:42:54,489 --> 01:42:55,770
a minute from the broadcast.

1016
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:56,489
So that's it.

1017
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:58,569
I was going to give 60 more seconds,

1018
01:42:58,569 --> 01:43:03,899
but you know, let's back it out here.

1019
01:43:03,899 --> 01:43:04,460
Thanks for watching.

1020
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:05,420
Hope you enjoyed E3.

1021
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:08,829
See you tomorrow for Nintendo.

1022
01:43:11,479 --> 01:43:12,760
Hopefully you're excited about some stuff.

1023
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:16,300
Some of that look pretty good.

1024
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:19,069
I actually really think Watch Dogs 3

1025
01:43:19,069 --> 01:43:21,640
might be fun or Watch Dogs Legion.

1026
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:25,079
Sorry, at least for a while.

1027
01:43:25,079 --> 01:43:35,800
Let me go like this,

1028
01:43:36,939 --> 01:43:38,779
but we'll do the bits and the subs.

1029
01:43:38,779 --> 01:43:39,420
Thanks everybody.

1030
01:43:40,409 --> 01:43:42,090
See you bright and early tomorrow

1031
01:43:42,090 --> 01:43:46,039
if you get up for it at what?

1032
01:43:46,039 --> 01:43:50,239
Something like eight or nine AM Pacific?

1033
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:51,199
Whatever it is.

1034
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:52,159
The suss will be correct.

1035
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,079
I will see you all tomorrow.

1036
01:43:57,079 --> 01:43:57,960
I'm going to oversleep.

1037
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,000
No, I'm not.

1038
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:02,119
If I confirmed it, it's happening.

1039
01:44:02,119 --> 01:44:09,960
I hope you had a good time.

1040
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,270
It's always fun to hang out

1041
01:44:12,270 --> 01:44:14,920
and stick around with the chat for a while.

1042
01:44:17,550 --> 01:44:18,430
So what do you say?

1043
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:21,630
We do the bits from earlier this afternoon.

1044
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:30,010
So from earlier we had

1045
01:44:32,649 --> 01:44:35,449
we had $2.50 from Dorkcube.

1046
01:44:35,449 --> 01:44:36,170
Thank you Dorkcube.

1047
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:40,590
I hate Jerm.

1048
01:44:41,789 --> 01:44:44,350
Liu Da Wang did a stream yesterday

1049
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:45,310
where she made probably

1050
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:47,310
the most accurate depictions of you.

1051
01:44:48,029 --> 01:44:50,189
She may have also given you

1052
01:44:50,189 --> 01:44:51,710
a sans undertale eye.

1053
01:45:03,819 --> 01:45:05,260
I have so many monitors.

1054
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:14,510
One of my monitors is a triangle.

1055
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:15,550
That's fucking hilarious.

1056
01:45:16,649 --> 01:45:19,609
Chatter 7369, 69,000 bits.

1057
01:45:19,609 --> 01:45:21,050
Ah, funny meme reference.

1058
01:45:21,770 --> 01:45:22,989
He doesn't know.

1059
01:45:22,989 --> 01:45:23,390
LOL.

1060
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:24,270
What is a meme?

1061
01:45:24,270 --> 01:45:25,149
I do this all the time.

1062
01:45:25,710 --> 01:45:30,670
I'll put it on the screen.

1063
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:35,050
Every time we have a stream

1064
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:35,850
I have to go back and like

1065
01:45:36,649 --> 01:45:38,170
fact check my memes.

1066
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:40,539
I can't believe that that's a real thing

1067
01:45:40,539 --> 01:45:41,100
that I have to do.

1068
01:45:53,550 --> 01:45:54,189
That's not it.

1069
01:45:54,750 --> 01:46:05,100
What are some of these pictures?

1070
01:46:09,869 --> 01:46:10,350
There it is.

1071
01:46:11,069 --> 01:46:20,590
Two o'clock and you get the

1072
01:46:20,590 --> 01:46:21,390
two o'clock in the morning.

1073
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:22,189
That's perfect.

1074
01:46:23,069 --> 01:46:23,869
Sometimes later.

1075
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:31,529
Is that Kim?

1076
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:34,409
Wait, why?

1077
01:46:37,319 --> 01:46:38,520
There's like a spilt shit

1078
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:39,159
all over the place.

1079
01:46:40,729 --> 01:46:41,609
I'm in A's.

1080
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:44,479
Why is she on the floor?

1081
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:46,960
Thank you for this.

1082
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:47,840
This is fucking awesome.

1083
01:46:56,590 --> 01:46:57,390
That's good shit.

1084
01:46:57,390 --> 01:46:57,710
Thank you.

1085
01:46:58,270 --> 01:47:01,500
And thank you door cue for the 250.

1086
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:05,479
Hey mouse, thanks for 250.

1087
01:47:06,039 --> 01:47:07,239
We can achieve the goal of having

1088
01:47:07,239 --> 01:47:09,880
an only elderly hacktivist organization.

1089
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:13,279
I'll try it.

1090
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:14,000
When that comes out

1091
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,279
I'm only going to do old people.

1092
01:47:18,670 --> 01:47:20,270
My whole gang is going to be

1093
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:21,229
all elderly.

1094
01:47:22,489 --> 01:47:23,050
We can try.

1095
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,239
Thank you SGH for the 15 dollars.

1096
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:29,119
Love you Jerma.

1097
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:30,079
Just finished cracking up

1098
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:31,119
with your last upload.

1099
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:31,600
Never change.

1100
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:34,399
Thanks for the 15 dollars.

1101
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:38,060
I don't have any capability to.

1102
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:44,029
So I can't change.

1103
01:47:44,829 --> 01:47:45,470
It's too late.

1104
01:47:46,109 --> 01:47:47,960
So thank you.

1105
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:48,760
I really appreciate it.

1106
01:47:49,399 --> 01:47:51,079
Thank you for the 15 dollars.

1107
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:54,989
Jerma lied about Taco Bell

1108
01:47:54,989 --> 01:47:55,869
thanks to the 250.

1109
01:47:58,039 --> 01:47:59,560
Devs keep putting celebrities

1110
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,760
into single player storylines

1111
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:02,359
for like five minutes to drum a pipe.

1112
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:04,840
For five out of ten cod rip-offs.

1113
01:48:09,319 --> 01:48:09,960
What?

1114
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:14,039
Oh, thought too much conflict.

1115
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:15,739
You know what?

1116
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:16,699
I am really excited

1117
01:48:16,699 --> 01:48:18,140
for tomorrow's Nintendo stream.

1118
01:48:18,699 --> 01:48:19,260
You know why?

1119
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:21,470
There's not going to be a whole lot

1120
01:48:21,470 --> 01:48:23,390
of constant conflict on that stream.

1121
01:48:26,699 --> 01:48:27,020
Wow.

1122
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,279
Nintendo may win the conference

1123
01:48:31,949 --> 01:48:33,149
just because of that one reason.

1124
01:48:33,710 --> 01:48:37,819
That depends on what they show.

1125
01:48:38,619 --> 01:48:44,560
Smash Brothers is all constant,

1126
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,359
is all conflict.

1127
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:47,050
Uh oh, you're right.

1128
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:48,750
Don't worry.

1129
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:49,229
Don't worry guys.

1130
01:48:49,229 --> 01:48:50,510
Guys like Toad's going to solve

1131
01:48:50,510 --> 01:48:52,189
a couple of puzzles in his new game.

1132
01:48:52,189 --> 01:48:53,869
So that'll balance it out a little.

1133
01:49:00,649 --> 01:49:01,609
Hey, thank you to

1134
01:49:02,409 --> 01:49:03,850
Demonic Cucumber for the three bucks.

1135
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:04,489
The purple light

1136
01:49:04,489 --> 01:49:05,609
and the slick back villain hair

1137
01:49:05,609 --> 01:49:07,210
makes Jerma look like Mega Mind.

1138
01:49:09,079 --> 01:49:09,960
Thanks for the compliment.

1139
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:13,850
It means I'm pretty smart.

1140
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:25,680
But thank you.

1141
01:49:28,489 --> 01:49:30,170
Thank you also to, uh,

1142
01:49:31,529 --> 01:49:32,810
Kyari, Ky-

1143
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:34,569
Kyari 5.

1144
01:49:34,569 --> 01:49:35,770
No, Kyari, Ky-

1145
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:40,140
Kyari 13 for the five dollars.

1146
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:40,539
There you go.

1147
01:49:42,859 --> 01:49:49,079
Uh, for the Gungeon Cab Fund cabinet.

1148
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:51,260
What would you guys do

1149
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:51,979
if you seriously,

1150
01:49:51,979 --> 01:49:52,939
if the stream turned on

1151
01:49:53,739 --> 01:49:54,699
and right behind me,

1152
01:49:54,699 --> 01:49:55,819
I turned the webcam on

1153
01:49:55,819 --> 01:49:56,859
and the Enter the Gungeon

1154
01:49:56,859 --> 01:49:58,460
five thousand dollar cabinet was behind me.

1155
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:07,659
I would post the PogChamp emote in the chat.

1156
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:13,239
But then what would I do with it?

1157
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:14,520
You know how much of a pain in the ass

1158
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:15,960
it was to get that TV out of my room?

1159
01:50:17,850 --> 01:50:18,970
It was so difficult

1160
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:21,770
and so hard to get that television

1161
01:50:21,770 --> 01:50:22,569
into that room

1162
01:50:22,569 --> 01:50:23,449
and out of that room.

1163
01:50:31,479 --> 01:50:33,560
Me and Kim brought that big

1164
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:35,479
300 pound TV down the stairs.

1165
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,239
We almost like died.

1166
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:40,590
The two of us were just like,

1167
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:41,550
no, no, no, no, just look out,

1168
01:50:41,550 --> 01:50:42,670
wait, wait, wait, I gotta put it down,

1169
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:43,949
put it down, put it down.

1170
01:50:43,949 --> 01:50:58,539
I think I threw my back out during that

1171
01:50:58,539 --> 01:50:59,500
and it's never healed.

1172
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:03,399
When we were bringing that

1173
01:51:03,399 --> 01:51:04,760
down the stairs into that room,

1174
01:51:05,319 --> 01:51:07,000
I think I have never recovered

1175
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,439
from like hurting my back

1176
01:51:08,439 --> 01:51:09,479
like a year ago.

1177
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:13,239
It's because Kim did all the work.

1178
01:51:13,239 --> 01:51:14,359
No, I didn't do the thing.

1179
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:15,800
Look, I know everybody

1180
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:16,680
thinks I did the thing

1181
01:51:17,399 --> 01:51:19,800
where like here, oh my God.

1182
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:21,079
You all right?

1183
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:25,479
Yeah, I'll think I did the thing

1184
01:51:25,479 --> 01:51:27,960
where here's a big heavy item, right?

1185
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,880
One person's here, one person's here

1186
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,560
and maybe three of you lifted it.

1187
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,760
And you do the like

1188
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:34,680
we're over at a sleepover

1189
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:35,800
doing light as a feather,

1190
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:36,520
as stiff as a board

1191
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:37,640
and I'm just like pretending

1192
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:39,079
like I'm putting pressure here.

1193
01:51:39,079 --> 01:51:40,359
But really I'm just making you

1194
01:51:40,359 --> 01:51:41,640
you two do all the work

1195
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:43,000
while I go like this

1196
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,279
and just like pretend to lift it up.

1197
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:46,760
I know that you thought that

1198
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,399
that's what I was doing

1199
01:51:47,399 --> 01:51:48,439
but that's not possible.

1200
01:51:49,239 --> 01:51:50,199
That's not possible

1201
01:51:50,199 --> 01:51:51,800
in a two-person scenario.

1202
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,479
In a three-person, four-person scenario,

1203
01:51:53,479 --> 01:51:54,920
yes, I do that all the time.

1204
01:51:55,479 --> 01:51:57,319
And I'm not a strong person.

1205
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:59,640
I just like to people

1206
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:00,520
to think that I'm helping.

1207
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:06,569
Why is this so heavy?

1208
01:52:06,569 --> 01:52:07,529
What the fuck's happening?

1209
01:52:07,529 --> 01:52:09,800
I know this thing's really heavy.

1210
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:10,600
Yeah, this is heavy.

1211
01:52:11,399 --> 01:52:12,439
Fuck, it's like hurt my arm.

1212
01:52:13,239 --> 01:52:15,000
You guys good?

1213
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:20,600
I don't do that.

1214
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:21,239
It's a joke.

1215
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:29,359
You thought I was Jack?

1216
01:52:29,359 --> 01:52:30,800
No, I just it's air.

1217
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,000
I was inflated.

1218
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:37,199
I was wearing one of those

1219
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:38,960
cheap, goofy, inflated suits.

1220
01:52:45,239 --> 01:52:46,039
Spongebob.

1221
01:52:46,039 --> 01:52:47,079
Yeah, Spongebob arms.

1222
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:50,239
Anyways.

1223
01:52:51,659 --> 01:52:52,699
Thank you to Germalight

1224
01:52:52,699 --> 01:52:54,539
about Taco Bell for the two dollars and fifty cents.

1225
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:56,460
You can't rob a bank

1226
01:52:58,079 --> 01:52:59,279
live stream the robbery

1227
01:52:59,279 --> 01:53:00,319
and expect to get away with it.

1228
01:53:02,539 --> 01:53:03,819
No, that's why I know.

1229
01:53:04,699 --> 01:53:05,500
That's not going to happen.

1230
01:53:14,039 --> 01:53:15,640
Why is Slow Mode still on?

1231
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:17,399
Because there were a lot of people here today

1232
01:53:17,399 --> 01:53:18,199
and yesterday too.

1233
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:21,359
So Slow Mode was on

1234
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,279
pretty much the whole time, yeah.

1235
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:28,250
How did I react to Destroy All Humans?

1236
01:53:29,279 --> 01:53:32,079
It looks, from what you can see, looks good.

1237
01:53:32,079 --> 01:53:33,520
I didn't, I saw the trailer

1238
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:35,920
where they, everyone gets hypnotized.

1239
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:42,909
E3, E3 attracts a lot of people.

1240
01:53:42,909 --> 01:53:44,510
I hope they had fun here.

1241
01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:48,399
Sometimes, yeah, you look over and you

1242
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,479
say, holy shit, wait,

1243
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:52,079
there's like 8,000 people here.

1244
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:57,050
Like, hopefully they liked it.

1245
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,760
Hey, thank you Rad Sully for the five dollars.

1246
01:54:04,479 --> 01:54:08,159
All this E3 talk is getting me

1247
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:11,039
hot for the epic Jerma Khan.

1248
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:11,539
When is it?

1249
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:15,710
The epic Jerma Khan.

1250
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:18,220
I forgot about that.

1251
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:24,619
Maybe, soon, possibly, in the future,

1252
01:54:24,619 --> 01:54:26,140
you will see a get-together.

1253
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:27,340
Possible, it might happen.

1254
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:28,939
Don't quote me on that.

1255
01:54:28,939 --> 01:54:29,819
Don't hold me to that.

1256
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:34,140
I know what it is.

1257
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:35,579
I wasn't like trashed.

1258
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:39,149
Hey, thanks Mr. Comcast for the three dollars.

1259
01:54:39,149 --> 01:54:40,350
Hey Jerma, John Comcast here.

1260
01:54:40,350 --> 01:54:41,310
Just letting you know that I'm sitting

1261
01:54:41,310 --> 01:54:42,670
in the audience at E3

1262
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:44,189
and I found it weird when you showed up

1263
01:54:44,189 --> 01:54:46,189
on stage completely naked and drunk.

1264
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:48,029
I found it very disrespectful

1265
01:54:48,029 --> 01:54:50,670
when you DDT'd the other host into the audience

1266
01:54:50,670 --> 01:54:53,789
while shouting about how tight your ass is

1267
01:54:53,789 --> 01:54:54,909
when you flex it.

1268
01:54:54,909 --> 01:54:56,029
I found it weird when you started

1269
01:54:56,029 --> 01:54:57,390
to push your way through the audience

1270
01:54:58,350 --> 01:54:59,310
taking their wallets.

1271
01:55:00,109 --> 01:55:01,149
The police showed up but you managed

1272
01:55:01,149 --> 01:55:01,949
to sneak out the back door

1273
01:55:01,949 --> 01:55:03,550
while holding a box of AMDs.

1274
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:09,239
A box of AMDs.

1275
01:55:10,989 --> 01:55:14,640
Just the letters, not the graphics cards.

1276
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:18,279
Well, I thought they were valuable.

1277
01:55:24,619 --> 01:55:26,859
Thank you Mr. Comcast for the three bucks.

1278
01:55:26,859 --> 01:55:28,699
Thank you Demonic Cucumber for the two fifty.

1279
01:55:30,119 --> 01:55:30,920
I don't think you thought

1280
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:32,600
this MS-DOS game thing through.

1281
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,119
You sorted it by best games

1282
01:55:34,119 --> 01:55:35,720
and are picking three

1283
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:36,680
and then scrolling down.

1284
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,800
Meaning that you're actively skipping

1285
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:38,600
more than 70 percent

1286
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:40,359
of the top-moded games on there.

1287
01:55:40,359 --> 01:55:41,640
Surely you should play more games

1288
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:42,760
towards the top seeing as you're

1289
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:43,960
sorted them by best games.

1290
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:48,079
I can always go back.

1291
01:55:50,649 --> 01:55:51,449
There's so many.

1292
01:55:52,090 --> 01:55:53,050
And look, we don't have to play

1293
01:55:53,050 --> 01:55:56,039
the best games, you know?

1294
01:55:56,039 --> 01:55:58,520
When we sorted by not by popular,

1295
01:55:59,609 --> 01:56:00,970
we got some classics in there.

1296
01:56:01,689 --> 01:56:06,699
There's a lot.

1297
01:56:06,699 --> 01:56:08,140
Oh, there's forty-three hundred.

1298
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:16,510
There's a lot to go through.

1299
01:56:17,069 --> 01:56:18,840
We got to see Pizza Worm.

1300
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:23,319
It's pretty good.

1301
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,180
Although Pizza Worm

1302
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:26,380
may have been really popular.

1303
01:56:31,470 --> 01:56:44,960
Go back and do games that you missed.

1304
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:45,600
I probably will.

1305
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,079
It's just, it's hard to,

1306
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,079
because there are so many of them.

1307
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:52,920
It's almost like we just have

1308
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:54,680
to throw darts for a while.

1309
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:57,479
And then later when we go through

1310
01:56:57,479 --> 01:56:59,000
and get, I think there's like

1311
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,800
an exhaustion period with that kind of site

1312
01:57:02,989 --> 01:57:04,670
where doing another three,

1313
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:05,630
four, five, six times.

1314
01:57:05,630 --> 01:57:06,829
Maybe we will just go back

1315
01:57:07,630 --> 01:57:09,390
and pick out some of the classic ones

1316
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:10,029
to just play.

1317
01:57:10,989 --> 01:57:13,279
But we're in dart phase right now.

1318
01:57:17,239 --> 01:57:18,649
But thank you.

1319
01:57:21,159 --> 01:57:22,199
Also, thank you, Mr.

1320
01:57:22,199 --> 01:57:23,560
Comcast again for the three dollars.

1321
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:25,239
Hey, JermaJohnComcast here.

1322
01:57:25,239 --> 01:57:26,520
Just letting you know that I saw you

1323
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,119
again after the E3 conference.

1324
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:29,640
You were still naked,

1325
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:31,000
but you had two AMD chips

1326
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,039
glued to your nipples.

1327
01:57:32,039 --> 01:57:33,880
What the fuck are you doing?

1328
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,399
You started yelling at passersby

1329
01:57:35,399 --> 01:57:37,720
about how your AMD stocks plummeted.

1330
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:39,319
And that you were broke.

1331
01:57:39,319 --> 01:57:41,239
I found it weird when Keanu Reeves

1332
01:57:41,239 --> 01:57:42,119
showed up and you started

1333
01:57:42,119 --> 01:57:43,479
throwing swears at him.

1334
01:57:43,479 --> 01:57:44,920
Shouting that it should have been

1335
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:47,399
your skin added to Fortnite.

1336
01:57:47,399 --> 01:57:48,279
The police showed up again

1337
01:57:48,279 --> 01:57:48,760
and they caught you

1338
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:50,840
because you stopped to punch.

1339
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:56,840
Thank you, Mr.

1340
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:57,399
Comcast.

1341
01:57:58,039 --> 01:58:00,300
I really appreciate it.

1342
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:02,140
Thanks for the funny little,

1343
01:58:02,859 --> 01:58:04,220
you know, laughing about it fiction.

1344
01:58:08,399 --> 01:58:09,840
Thank you, girl revolution

1345
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:10,640
for the five dollars.

1346
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:11,840
This is actually the very first

1347
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:13,039
video game I ever played.

1348
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,640
Thank you for reminding me.

1349
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:17,180
I'm not sure what game that was.

1350
01:58:17,899 --> 01:58:20,779
Whatever game it happened to be.

1351
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:23,149
I'm glad you got to see it.

1352
01:58:25,689 --> 01:58:26,250
Mini clips.

1353
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:27,050
Thanks for the 10 bucks.

1354
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:27,609
Mini clips.

1355
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:30,619
The look of a mad man.

1356
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:36,060
Me?

1357
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:36,380
Yeah.

1358
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:39,310
The mother goose one?

1359
01:58:39,310 --> 01:58:46,140
Oh, that one was cute.

1360
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:47,020
I would have played that

1361
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:48,060
for like 10 minutes.

1362
01:58:48,939 --> 01:58:52,380
But thank you.

1363
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:53,500
Mini clips for the 10 bucks.

1364
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:55,869
Oh, what?

1365
01:58:55,869 --> 01:58:56,189
What?

1366
01:58:56,189 --> 01:58:56,750
Freage.

1367
01:58:56,750 --> 01:58:58,590
Thanks for the 15 dollars.

1368
01:58:58,590 --> 01:58:59,630
Cheater streamer loses

1369
01:58:59,630 --> 01:59:00,829
Wheel of Fortune anyways.

1370
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:04,109
Not very good at Wheel of Fortune.

1371
01:59:06,510 --> 01:59:07,630
I'm good at Family Feud.

1372
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:12,239
That's the one I'm pretty good at.

1373
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:15,159
Thank you.

1374
01:59:15,159 --> 01:59:16,600
Freudian weapon for the 250.

1375
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:17,800
Lost to Fortune Wheel.

1376
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:21,760
Literally, yes.

1377
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:22,399
Literally.

1378
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:23,359
Sure.

1379
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,130
I'll let that one slide.

1380
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:28,079
And we also had Flug Boy.

1381
01:59:28,079 --> 01:59:28,880
Two dollars and 50 cents.

1382
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:29,840
A German full disclosure.

1383
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:30,960
Dragon Quest 11 is probably

1384
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,479
one of the best in the series.

1385
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:36,560
I've been playing since DQ7, probably.

1386
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:37,520
And I highly recommend it

1387
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:38,640
if you're interested.

1388
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:39,439
I would say it's definitely

1389
01:59:39,439 --> 01:59:41,359
an off-stream game though.

1390
01:59:41,359 --> 01:59:41,920
Much love.

1391
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:49,020
Yeah, they look cool.

1392
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:49,739
It looks fun.

1393
01:59:49,739 --> 01:59:50,539
It looks interesting.

1394
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:58,779
I just never got into any of those

1395
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:01,880
in the years that they've existed.

1396
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:05,000
Do I play games off stream?

1397
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:05,479
Sometimes.

1398
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:07,159
I actually just downloaded

1399
02:00:07,159 --> 02:00:08,279
Slay the Spire for the Switch.

1400
02:00:09,159 --> 02:00:12,489
Just was hanging out

1401
02:00:12,489 --> 02:00:13,210
playing it the other day.

1402
02:00:13,850 --> 02:00:15,119
It's pretty fun.

1403
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:23,500
Frank Leo Wright.

1404
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:26,720
It's another one of those things

1405
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:28,319
that I will just never live down

1406
02:00:28,319 --> 02:00:29,359
for the rest of my life.

1407
02:00:30,079 --> 02:00:35,180
It's like I have live

1408
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:39,020
time-stamped clips of Leo.

1409
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:41,260
What a pee pants moment.

1410
02:00:41,819 --> 02:00:44,409
It's all right.

1411
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:48,479
At least it wasn't the slap.

1412
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:49,439
That was by far the worst

1413
02:00:49,439 --> 02:00:50,479
thing I've ever done on camera.

1414
02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:53,100
Let me remind myself again

1415
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:54,300
to keep myself grounded.

1416
02:01:00,199 --> 02:01:04,670
Jesus fucking God.

1417
02:01:08,270 --> 02:01:09,390
Nobody can do this.

1418
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:12,270
I saw a comment of somebody saying

1419
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:13,789
that this is not possible.

1420
02:01:13,789 --> 02:01:14,670
It has to be fake.

1421
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,119
I agree with that person.

1422
02:01:18,539 --> 02:01:21,180
It's not possible to do what I did.

1423
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:21,979
It's impossible.

1424
02:01:22,619 --> 02:01:31,390
Little do they know.

1425
02:01:34,350 --> 02:01:35,390
Yeah, I saw that comment.

1426
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:36,510
I'm just like, fuck.

1427
02:01:36,510 --> 02:01:37,949
It's I know.

1428
02:01:37,949 --> 02:01:38,670
I know.

1429
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:42,140
I want to like come in there

1430
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:43,020
and be like, I know.

1431
02:01:43,579 --> 02:01:43,899
I know.

1432
02:01:44,699 --> 02:01:45,420
I trust me.

1433
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:46,939
I know better than anybody.

1434
02:01:52,829 --> 02:01:53,630
Hey, Tora T.

1435
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:54,350
Thanks for the $15.

1436
02:01:55,229 --> 02:01:56,699
Jeremy, you better do it.

1437
02:01:56,699 --> 02:01:57,659
Don't lie to us.

1438
02:01:58,380 --> 02:01:59,819
I'm gonna do the Nintendo conference.

1439
02:02:00,619 --> 02:02:02,430
We also had Hack It Fast.

1440
02:02:02,430 --> 02:02:03,310
Had five community subs.

1441
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:04,189
Thank you, Hack It Fast.

1442
02:02:07,949 --> 02:02:09,149
Some more community subs come in.

1443
02:02:09,710 --> 02:02:13,369
We had Hack It Fast gave five.

1444
02:02:13,369 --> 02:02:15,130
Bala Koala gave some too.

1445
02:02:15,130 --> 02:02:17,130
Thank you guys for your community subs.

1446
02:02:17,850 --> 02:02:19,680
And thank you Tora T for the $15.

1447
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:24,939
That was your first ever stream of me

1448
02:02:24,939 --> 02:02:26,539
and I slapped myself

1449
02:02:26,539 --> 02:02:27,340
within the first 10 minutes

1450
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:27,979
of you watching it.

1451
02:02:31,689 --> 02:02:32,489
Welcome to the channel.

1452
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:38,649
Hey, you still here?

1453
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:41,850
How do you do?

1454
02:02:42,409 --> 02:02:43,050
Good to see you.

1455
02:02:43,689 --> 02:02:45,399
That's how you reel them in.

1456
02:02:46,199 --> 02:02:46,840
Oh God.

1457
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:48,520
Dabs for dinner.

1458
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:49,319
Thanks for the $2.50.

1459
02:02:49,319 --> 02:02:50,680
You showed up for the Nintendo showcase

1460
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:51,800
in a bathrobe last year.

1461
02:02:52,439 --> 02:02:53,880
So it's only fitting that you do it again.

1462
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:58,409
Yeah, and I was on East Coast time last year.

1463
02:02:59,130 --> 02:03:01,449
It's three hours behind in Vegas.

1464
02:03:02,090 --> 02:03:03,260
It's gonna be even harder.

1465
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:04,300
I'm gonna look horrible.

1466
02:03:04,859 --> 02:03:13,000
I couldn't even get up at like noon.

1467
02:03:15,279 --> 02:03:16,239
God, I'll be fine.

1468
02:03:16,239 --> 02:03:16,720
I'll be here.

1469
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:17,119
Don't worry.

1470
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:22,430
Thank you SleepTiner for the $3.20.

1471
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:23,149
Thanks for the stream.

1472
02:03:23,869 --> 02:03:25,100
I hope you enjoyed it.

1473
02:03:25,659 --> 02:03:26,989
Thanks for watching.

1474
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:31,319
Snoozingcopter, thanks for the $2.50.

1475
02:03:32,199 --> 02:03:35,279
Derma just said he never lies to us.

1476
02:03:35,279 --> 02:03:37,279
That means we're finally going to see Ace Attorney.

1477
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:43,119
Also really disappointed that we didn't see Babylon's fall at Square today.

1478
02:03:43,119 --> 02:03:46,159
They just teased it last year and now it seems forgotten.

1479
02:03:46,159 --> 02:03:49,359
Even though it looks so cool, it was co-developed by Platinum Games.

1480
02:03:50,399 --> 02:03:58,829
Yeah, I wasn't really grabbed by much of the Square stuff.

1481
02:04:04,859 --> 02:04:05,739
Not this year at least.

1482
02:04:05,739 --> 02:04:07,260
Except for maybe one or two little things.

1483
02:04:07,979 --> 02:04:16,560
I felt kind of bad because I was kind of just like sitting there.

1484
02:04:17,039 --> 02:04:21,930
Watching and like I don't really have much to say about any of these games.

1485
02:04:24,439 --> 02:04:26,520
But I just kind of just didn't really have much to say.

1486
02:04:27,239 --> 02:04:36,170
The cute deer game looked interesting.

1487
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:40,319
It did.

1488
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:41,199
You're right.

1489
02:04:41,199 --> 02:04:45,260
But thank you Snoozingcopter for the $2.50.

1490
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:46,220
I lie all the time.

1491
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:49,979
So Ace Attorney is encompassed in the lies.

1492
02:04:53,399 --> 02:04:55,960
And Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $2.50.

1493
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:58,119
Smelly Boy, thanks for the $2.50.

1494
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:01,850
Do you have a video on the main channel that points viewers to the second channel?

1495
02:05:01,850 --> 02:05:02,569
If not, why?

1496
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:08,319
I don't know.

1497
02:05:08,319 --> 02:05:09,039
I just kind of don't.

1498
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:12,560
The last video I made on the main channel just said that I was going to be streaming full time.

1499
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:14,960
Or like at least a lot.

1500
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:23,449
That was the doctor's appointment.

1501
02:05:23,449 --> 02:05:30,649
Spider-Man hasn't took a year for me to find Jerma 2.

1502
02:05:32,989 --> 02:05:36,750
It's weird because part of me feels like if I make a video on the main channel that says,

1503
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:38,510
hey guys, remember me?

1504
02:05:38,510 --> 02:05:40,270
Well, this is not a video.

1505
02:05:40,270 --> 02:05:42,670
This is me telling you that there's another channel.

1506
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:45,310
And oh, by the way, I'm still streaming.

1507
02:05:45,310 --> 02:05:46,670
This is not a video though.

1508
02:05:47,390 --> 02:05:49,609
I feel like that's like the hermit is coming out.

1509
02:05:49,609 --> 02:05:53,289
Like the rock is moving and there's like a crowd of people just waiting.

1510
02:05:54,250 --> 02:05:55,050
It's like a theater.

1511
02:05:56,970 --> 02:05:58,810
There's a giant rock in a cave.

1512
02:05:58,810 --> 02:06:01,449
And there's like fucking thousands of people all sitting there with popcorn

1513
02:06:01,449 --> 02:06:04,569
with like 3D glasses on waiting for the cave boulder to move.

1514
02:06:05,689 --> 02:06:07,050
And like here it starts to move.

1515
02:06:08,569 --> 02:06:09,289
Oh my god, it's moving.

1516
02:06:09,289 --> 02:06:12,010
And everyone fucking sits down, shuts up, turns their phones off and starts watching.

1517
02:06:12,649 --> 02:06:14,170
Holy shit, the boulder's moving.

1518
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:18,699
And the bright lights hit me in the face.

1519
02:06:18,699 --> 02:06:20,220
I have a huge beard and I'm just like.

1520
02:06:23,930 --> 02:06:24,810
Here he is, he's back.

1521
02:06:25,449 --> 02:06:29,689
Hey, just going to use the bathroom.

1522
02:06:30,409 --> 02:06:33,289
And I grab a newspaper and just walk across the audience

1523
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:34,970
and just go shit in the woods.

1524
02:06:36,220 --> 02:06:41,689
And then go back into the boulder and push it closed.

1525
02:06:42,409 --> 02:06:43,210
That's what that is.

1526
02:06:53,229 --> 02:06:56,029
No, I feel like I don't want to really do that.

1527
02:06:57,130 --> 02:06:58,489
Just do that as the video.

1528
02:07:00,729 --> 02:07:02,489
I feel like that would piss off so many people.

1529
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,399
If I did that and I actually uploaded that,

1530
02:07:06,399 --> 02:07:09,439
people would be like, are we, what, I'm the audience member?

1531
02:07:09,439 --> 02:07:10,800
I'm like just sitting here waiting for you?

1532
02:07:12,239 --> 02:07:13,760
You think I'm just going to sit here and wait?

1533
02:07:14,479 --> 02:07:15,600
What, you think you're that important?

1534
02:07:16,239 --> 02:07:17,279
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1535
02:07:17,279 --> 02:07:18,079
Okay, fine, dick.

1536
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:26,359
Just upload that.

1537
02:07:26,359 --> 02:07:27,079
What if I just did that?

1538
02:07:28,439 --> 02:07:31,800
Before I go to the cave, I'm just like, oh by the way,

1539
02:07:32,829 --> 02:07:36,189
there's a second turbo channel if you want to watch it

1540
02:07:36,189 --> 02:07:38,350
and I stream from inside this cave.

1541
02:07:42,140 --> 02:07:43,739
There's like this, you can peer over the shoulder

1542
02:07:43,739 --> 02:07:44,460
and zoom in a little bit.

1543
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:45,739
There's like a streamer set up.

1544
02:07:53,199 --> 02:07:54,159
Cave office.

1545
02:07:56,159 --> 02:08:02,319
I would watch that.

1546
02:08:02,319 --> 02:08:02,800
I would too.

1547
02:08:03,439 --> 02:08:12,779
You aren't funny, stop doing voices.

1548
02:08:12,779 --> 02:08:15,180
You are, what is this like, what's this coffee pasta?

1549
02:08:23,159 --> 02:08:25,560
Oh shit, it's two, it's two, I'm fucked.

1550
02:08:29,819 --> 02:08:33,920
That's 100% more than the typical one guy.

1551
02:08:46,329 --> 02:08:47,770
Well, I can't stop doing voices

1552
02:08:48,729 --> 02:08:50,010
because too many people live up here.

1553
02:08:53,119 --> 02:08:54,720
I don't even know what you mean by voices.

1554
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:56,399
This is just other people that are up in my head.

1555
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,760
Sometimes they just kind of come out.

1556
02:09:15,399 --> 02:09:16,920
Legal ramifications of tomorrow?

1557
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:18,520
What do you mean legal ramifications?

1558
02:09:25,399 --> 02:09:27,560
Chat lives up in my head, rent free.

1559
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:31,260
Nah, it's not rent free.

1560
02:09:40,619 --> 02:09:41,739
Do they pay rent?

1561
02:09:48,590 --> 02:09:50,350
But somebody, I mean, they said like,

1562
02:09:50,350 --> 02:09:51,869
you're not funny, stop doing voices.

1563
02:09:51,869 --> 02:09:52,909
I mean, I'm sorry.

1564
02:09:53,390 --> 02:09:54,989
I have to disagree with you personally.

1565
02:09:54,989 --> 02:09:56,189
As the streamer, I was interviewed

1566
02:09:56,829 --> 02:09:59,310
by youngbostonfunnycomedians.org

1567
02:10:00,350 --> 02:10:01,310
when I was like 14.

1568
02:10:01,310 --> 02:10:04,829
And I almost won like the RU as funny contest.

1569
02:10:05,869 --> 02:10:10,520
So when I was like 15.

1570
02:10:11,979 --> 02:10:16,489
And I was in Beauty and the Beast as Gaston.

1571
02:10:16,489 --> 02:10:17,930
So I think I have some credentials.

1572
02:10:29,630 --> 02:10:30,590
Yeah, I was Gaston.

1573
02:10:31,229 --> 02:10:38,750
Was that really?

1574
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:39,310
Of course I was.

1575
02:10:41,210 --> 02:10:42,810
And I did this great voice.

1576
02:10:43,529 --> 02:10:44,250
Let me tell you.

1577
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:47,529
It was a really, really good voice.

1578
02:10:52,939 --> 02:10:53,579
No, I'm done.

1579
02:10:53,579 --> 02:10:54,380
I'm done.

1580
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:55,340
I'm done.

1581
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:56,060
No more of this.

1582
02:10:59,229 --> 02:11:00,909
This is the auto voice.

1583
02:11:01,470 --> 02:11:08,239
Oh shit, I just have to rock this.

1584
02:11:14,430 --> 02:11:16,029
No one, I'm not gonna read that.

1585
02:11:22,649 --> 02:11:23,449
Do it, do it.

1586
02:11:23,449 --> 02:11:24,489
You played yourself.

1587
02:11:27,310 --> 02:11:28,670
I play myself every day.

1588
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:37,020
But let's move on.

1589
02:11:39,710 --> 02:11:40,670
I'll fix you though, don't worry.

1590
02:11:48,859 --> 02:11:49,500
Doesn't matter.

1591
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:50,300
I could say anything.

1592
02:11:50,859 --> 02:11:52,380
And it's gonna just turn against me.

1593
02:12:00,010 --> 02:12:00,890
Thank you too.

1594
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:04,140
Where are we?

1595
02:12:07,180 --> 02:12:09,180
Hey Jamie, thanks for the $5, Jamie.

1596
02:12:09,180 --> 02:12:10,140
Appreciate it.

1597
02:12:10,140 --> 02:12:13,689
Is no message.

1598
02:12:13,689 --> 02:12:15,609
Jamie2803, thanks for the $5.

1599
02:12:15,609 --> 02:12:19,449
Thank you Slater Ashby for the $5.

1600
02:12:19,449 --> 02:12:20,890
Jerma, I want to thank you.

1601
02:12:22,750 --> 02:12:24,189
Appreciate the $5.

1602
02:12:24,189 --> 02:12:24,909
Thanks for that.

1603
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:29,720
Anything else show official?

1604
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:30,680
Thanks for the $15.

1605
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:34,800
Thank you.

1606
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:35,760
Anything else show official?

1607
02:12:36,399 --> 02:12:37,039
15 bucks.

1608
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:39,229
Hell yeah.

1609
02:12:39,789 --> 02:12:42,880
Had fun watching your drunken stream today, Jerma,

1610
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,239
while I was sick with bronchitis.

1611
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:49,579
But a bilateral ear infection and sinusitis.

1612
02:12:49,579 --> 02:12:51,340
So I hope you're glad you gave me some laughter

1613
02:12:51,340 --> 02:12:53,100
while I was dying, coughing, and sneezing today.

1614
02:12:53,739 --> 02:12:57,979
Well hopefully you're feeling all right.

1615
02:12:58,619 --> 02:13:05,079
Hopefully you're not like actually in like any pain or anything.

1616
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:08,270
But I wish you a swift recovery.

1617
02:13:08,270 --> 02:13:09,310
Thanks for the 15 bucks.

1618
02:13:12,460 --> 02:13:13,819
Getting sick during the summer is the worst.

1619
02:13:13,819 --> 02:13:14,220
Yeah it is.

1620
02:13:14,939 --> 02:13:16,960
Because you just don't feel like you're supposed to be sick.

1621
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:24,189
You feel like it's like sunny and nice out.

1622
02:13:24,189 --> 02:13:25,229
So it's just like why?

1623
02:13:25,229 --> 02:13:26,829
When it's cold and wintery and shitty out,

1624
02:13:26,829 --> 02:13:27,390
it doesn't matter.

1625
02:13:27,390 --> 02:13:28,510
It's like good I'll stay in bed.

1626
02:13:29,470 --> 02:13:35,130
But sorry to hear that.

1627
02:13:35,130 --> 02:13:36,409
Hopefully you get a swift recovery.

1628
02:13:36,409 --> 02:13:37,449
Thanks for the 15 bucks.

1629
02:13:39,529 --> 02:13:41,449
A vertebral giant.

1630
02:13:41,449 --> 02:13:42,489
Thanks for the $5.

1631
02:13:43,770 --> 02:13:45,529
Thanks for killing it with jokes tonight.

1632
02:13:45,529 --> 02:13:48,010
By the way, Twitch tweeted out your Christopher Walken joke

1633
02:13:48,010 --> 02:13:49,289
about Keanu Reeves.

1634
02:13:49,289 --> 02:13:50,409
Have a good one.

1635
02:13:50,409 --> 02:13:52,170
That was the worst joke I made yesterday.

1636
02:13:52,890 --> 02:13:55,239
That was such like a flat shit joke.

1637
02:13:55,239 --> 02:13:56,680
And people probably clicking on that gale night.

1638
02:13:56,680 --> 02:13:57,720
This guy sucks.

1639
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:59,079
The person that said that my jokes suck

1640
02:13:59,079 --> 02:14:00,279
probably came here from that tweet.

1641
02:14:01,079 --> 02:14:01,720
Now I get it.

1642
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:02,279
I understand.

1643
02:14:11,550 --> 02:14:12,270
No, it was fun.

1644
02:14:12,270 --> 02:14:12,829
That was fun.

1645
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:19,210
But it was kind of the equivalent of me being like

1646
02:14:19,210 --> 02:14:20,649
pee-pee doo-doo.

1647
02:14:20,649 --> 02:14:21,449
Like poo-poo.

1648
02:14:32,029 --> 02:14:32,510
There it is.

1649
02:14:32,510 --> 02:14:33,149
Hilarious.

1650
02:14:42,079 --> 02:14:44,460
That's it.

1651
02:14:44,460 --> 02:14:45,500
That's what I do normally.

1652
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:49,239
If you don't think this stream is funny,

1653
02:14:49,239 --> 02:14:51,399
I hope you find somebody that you think is funny.

1654
02:14:51,399 --> 02:14:52,920
Hope you find something to enjoy.

1655
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:54,840
And if you enjoy not thinking that I'm funny,

1656
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:55,720
I'm glad to have you.

1657
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:56,359
Thanks for watching.

1658
02:14:57,079 --> 02:15:04,489
So we had a couple more from smellyboy250.

1659
02:15:05,050 --> 02:15:07,609
Disregard my last comment.

1660
02:15:07,609 --> 02:15:08,329
I eat ass.

1661
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:10,479
Will do.

1662
02:15:10,479 --> 02:15:15,180
I will, I guess, disregard that comment.

1663
02:15:15,180 --> 02:15:15,680
Thanks.

1664
02:15:17,369 --> 02:15:18,890
DubskiDude, thanks for the 250.

1665
02:15:18,890 --> 02:15:20,890
I love the Dragon Quest series,

1666
02:15:20,890 --> 02:15:22,489
but I would say the constant puns

1667
02:15:22,489 --> 02:15:24,489
are extremely painful to read.

1668
02:15:25,130 --> 02:15:26,489
It's spine breaking.

1669
02:15:27,050 --> 02:15:28,569
They really localize it poorly,

1670
02:15:28,569 --> 02:15:30,489
but otherwise it's pretty fun off stream game.

1671
02:15:33,899 --> 02:15:34,460
Maybe I'll get it.

1672
02:15:35,020 --> 02:15:40,920
Maybe I'll give it a try.

1673
02:15:46,029 --> 02:15:47,630
I kind of need a new game just to lie down.

1674
02:15:49,119 --> 02:15:50,239
Just stare at a screen with...

1675
02:15:51,119 --> 02:15:53,800
Can I get that on?

1676
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:55,079
What can I get that on?

1677
02:15:55,079 --> 02:15:55,579
Let's see.

1678
02:15:56,279 --> 02:15:59,159
Oh, let's get the credits on.

1679
02:15:59,159 --> 02:16:00,119
There were a lot of subs.

1680
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:03,979
Let's show them.

1681
02:16:04,619 --> 02:16:08,029
I don't know what it is with these E3 streams,

1682
02:16:08,029 --> 02:16:09,470
but they like are killing my voice.

1683
02:16:10,350 --> 02:16:14,909
I mean, I've been drinking water.

1684
02:16:15,470 --> 02:16:18,220
Have I been talking more than usual?

1685
02:16:18,220 --> 02:16:18,859
I don't think so.

1686
02:16:24,829 --> 02:16:25,869
Not more than usual.

1687
02:16:26,590 --> 02:16:28,409
I think I'm just getting old.

1688
02:16:28,409 --> 02:16:29,130
Yeah, maybe I am.

1689
02:16:32,780 --> 02:16:33,659
But here comes the credits.

1690
02:16:33,659 --> 02:16:37,600
These are all the subs that were here today

1691
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:38,639
on this stream tonight.

1692
02:16:39,819 --> 02:16:42,620
See you tomorrow morning for the Nintendo conference.

1693
02:16:43,260 --> 02:16:48,879
And then we'll probably hang out for like a little bit after that.

1694
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:56,110
I'm going to show up late.

1695
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:56,909
I can't.

1696
02:16:56,909 --> 02:16:58,030
I can't be late to these

1697
02:16:58,829 --> 02:16:59,870
because they start without you.

1698
02:17:02,559 --> 02:17:03,760
But thank you again, everybody,

1699
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:07,760
for your continued support of this stream.

1700
02:17:11,290 --> 02:17:13,530
Hopefully you've been having fun on these E3 streams.

1701
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:14,329
They're fun to do.

1702
02:17:14,329 --> 02:17:15,290
They're fun just to hang out.

1703
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:19,739
And let's finish up.

1704
02:17:19,739 --> 02:17:21,100
There's only one more bit to do.

1705
02:17:21,979 --> 02:17:22,540
Or is there?

1706
02:17:22,540 --> 02:17:23,340
I think I already got it.

1707
02:17:23,899 --> 02:17:25,719
But yeah, I already got it.

1708
02:17:30,829 --> 02:17:33,309
So you mean you're only late when you can be late?

1709
02:17:33,950 --> 02:17:39,579
I mean, kind of.

1710
02:17:39,579 --> 02:17:41,500
But I mean, that's why I have the window now

1711
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:43,180
to make sure that I kind of can't be.

1712
02:17:46,569 --> 02:17:48,649
But I'll see you bright and early.

1713
02:17:48,649 --> 02:17:50,250
Those of you that are going to be awake or around.

1714
02:17:51,049 --> 02:17:57,049
Have a great rest of your night

1715
02:17:57,049 --> 02:17:59,450
if you're going to check out some more of the E3 stuff.

1716
02:17:59,450 --> 02:17:59,850
I think there's...

1717
02:17:59,850 --> 02:18:00,969
Is there anything else going on tonight?

1718
02:18:00,969 --> 02:18:02,090
I don't think there is, right?

1719
02:18:02,090 --> 02:18:03,209
The Square Enix was the last one.

1720
02:18:04,090 --> 02:18:18,459
Am I only interested in the building one?

1721
02:18:20,940 --> 02:18:22,620
No, I would play Dragon Quest XI.

1722
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:25,360
Don't think I would stream it,

1723
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:26,239
but I would probably play it.

1724
02:18:27,850 --> 02:18:29,370
NVIDIA and Intel subs.

1725
02:18:29,370 --> 02:18:30,649
Well, somebody gave them subs.

1726
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:39,979
Leo.

1727
02:18:44,079 --> 02:18:44,879
It is what it is.

1728
02:18:47,399 --> 02:18:49,479
I'm just glad I did the Dr. Island brain games

1729
02:18:49,479 --> 02:18:51,079
without too much of a problem.

1730
02:18:51,719 --> 02:18:53,159
That was a meltdown waiting to happen.

1731
02:19:06,649 --> 02:19:07,930
Leo Peepo dance.

1732
02:19:11,659 --> 02:19:12,379
Take care, guys.

1733
02:19:13,020 --> 02:19:15,500
Holy shit, there were a lot of subs.

1734
02:19:16,299 --> 02:19:21,600
You guys, generosity never ceases to amaze...

1735
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:23,680
Oh, by the way, let's take a look at this

1736
02:19:24,319 --> 02:19:25,440
because I'm doing this next week.

1737
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,079
Actually, not next week, but I'm doing this this weekend.

1738
02:19:29,209 --> 02:19:29,450
Yeah.

1739
02:19:30,409 --> 02:19:36,299
So after tomorrow, I will be live on Friday and Saturday.

1740
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:41,100
Yeah, after tomorrow, I'm going to be live Friday, Saturday.

1741
02:19:41,739 --> 02:19:42,780
And we're doing this shit.

1742
02:19:44,379 --> 02:19:46,860
You want to show up to like a drunk asshole stream?

1743
02:19:46,860 --> 02:19:47,659
It's going to be this one.

1744
02:19:48,540 --> 02:19:53,149
What do you think we should do first?

1745
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,040
Tombstone Express?

1746
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:00,750
I mean like Tombstone Express?

1747
02:20:02,489 --> 02:20:03,209
What else we got?

1748
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:10,270
The Squeak and Sausage Unlock Adventure

1749
02:20:13,229 --> 02:20:15,229
or the Exotic Expedition.

1750
02:20:15,790 --> 02:20:20,280
We're going to try to beat these.

1751
02:20:22,430 --> 02:20:26,510
These are card games that you play with yourself

1752
02:20:27,870 --> 02:20:28,670
or with a friend.

1753
02:20:29,549 --> 02:20:30,829
But we're going to do that.

1754
02:20:30,829 --> 02:20:31,950
You and I are going to do this.

1755
02:20:34,250 --> 02:20:36,090
It has an app that you sit on a table

1756
02:20:36,649 --> 02:20:40,170
and you essentially have to escape from the encounter.

1757
02:20:41,049 --> 02:20:44,110
It's going to be a wine stream.

1758
02:20:44,590 --> 02:20:46,829
If you're of drinking age, maybe you want to hang out.

1759
02:20:50,139 --> 02:20:51,420
Escape the encounter.

1760
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:54,540
It's Tombstone Express Wild West Dinosaur Expedition

1761
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:56,860
or Squeak and Sausage Weird Fucked Up Circus Climb.

1762
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:00,639
I played Squeak and Sausage.

1763
02:21:00,639 --> 02:21:01,200
Please play it.

1764
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:02,000
It's awesome.

1765
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:02,479
We'll pick.

1766
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:04,559
I'm going to I bought them all.

1767
02:21:04,559 --> 02:21:05,280
I'm going to do them all.

1768
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:09,879
Can chat play too?

1769
02:21:09,879 --> 02:21:10,200
Maybe.

1770
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:11,959
I'm going to see if that's possible

1771
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:15,530
because you only have 60 minutes to escape.

1772
02:21:16,090 --> 02:21:18,489
So I don't know if it's possible that we can.

1773
02:21:19,209 --> 02:21:20,409
That might take too long.

1774
02:21:20,409 --> 02:21:20,809
We'll see.

1775
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:23,979
This is going to be let's see.

1776
02:21:27,709 --> 02:21:27,950
Yes.

1777
02:21:27,950 --> 02:21:30,590
This will this will be Friday and maybe Saturday

1778
02:21:30,590 --> 02:21:31,629
if there's still time to do them.

1779
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:34,600
But it absolutely will be at least Friday night.

1780
02:21:35,479 --> 02:21:39,770
And that's my time.

1781
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:43,719
Thanks for hanging out for E3.

1782
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:47,340
We got one more conference to do tomorrow

1783
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:48,139
in the morning early.

1784
02:21:48,940 --> 02:21:51,500
Have a great rest of your night.

1785
02:21:52,059 --> 02:21:53,340
See you tomorrow if you're going to show up.

1786
02:21:55,579 --> 02:21:56,540
Take care.

1787
02:21:56,540 --> 02:22:15,209
Good night guys.
