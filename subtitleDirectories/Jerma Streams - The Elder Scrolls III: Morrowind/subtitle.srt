1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:09,720
Hold on, we'll go, we'll go full cam for a minute. Okay. Do I, do I have Morrowind? Let's find out.

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:25,690
Uh, is Morrowind on steam? No, please. God, you got a big ass head. Actually,

3
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,530
this camera makes me look fucking huge, by the way. Look at this. I don't know what it is with

4
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:35,210
this camera, but it, I don't, I think it's fisheye or something. Cause look at how huge it makes me

5
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:51,960
look. Look at this, right? It makes me look fucking huge. Don't I look like stacked? It makes me have

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:06,709
like a, I have a good tiny head. That's weird, right? I don't know why, why this is doing this.

7
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:23,239
I swear I don't have, I'm not this like jacked. All right. Where, um, where's Morrowind? How do

8
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:37,659
I get it? It's the tank top? Maybe. Yeah. Do I, I don't, I don't own Morrowind. I don't think.

9
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:44,760
What's it called? Elder Scrolls? I don't own it. Am I actually, is it going to, am I going to buy

10
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:53,719
fucking Morrowind right now? It runs fine. Vanilla. Really? Okay. Well let's get rid of like the giant

11
00:01:53,719 --> 00:02:14,360
arms. Okay. Uh, let's get it. Morrowind. It's on sale right now. Is this game actually going to be

12
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:21,060
fun or is this people are going to leave and hate this? It's $4 and 50 cents right now.

13
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:37,659
That's it. Holy shit. It really is 70% off. All right. Let's go for it. I'll get it. Okay. It's

14
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:56,419
coming through. Okay. Here we go. Pog. Pog. Pog. It's only one gig. This is a tiny game. Okay.

15
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:11,509
Morrowind. Can we get a, this is going to be a terrible stream game. Somebody said it's going

16
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:23,719
to be a terrible stream game. Somebody said this is going to suck. This is, this is going to suck.

17
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:34,520
This is going to suck. Well, look, this is, I guess this is what we're doing. Options. It says,

18
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,219
wait, it's a separate menu for the, how do I wear my options? Oh God. I think my computer's crashing.

19
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:55,689
Okay. I want, there's no HD resolutions. Full screen 1920 by 1440. I guess that's close enough.

20
00:03:55,689 --> 00:04:27,220
It takes a long time to learn. Wait, I think I'm going to have to learn this shit. Hold on.

21
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:34,870
Learning is hard. I mean, I, whatever. We'll see. I'll try it. Can I even capture the game?

22
00:04:34,870 --> 00:05:11,829
Let's find out. Okay. Oh, failed to create shader. Continue running executable. Yes.

23
00:05:14,120 --> 00:06:03,379
Yes. Continue please. Wait, here it comes. Here it comes. It doesn't work. I think it just turned

24
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:09,100
off now. All right. It just crashed out. We got to see the opening music cut scene. I'm going to try

25
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:21,639
opening it again. Epic music. Fucking epic. The elder scrolls three. This is the elder scrolls

26
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:39,939
three. Dude, it won't, I can't open it. I can't open it. I thought you guys said this worked on

27
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:48,939
windows 10. Do I have to go get a mod? Hold on. I'm going to, I'm going to open it in a window.

28
00:06:48,939 --> 00:07:16,629
Okay. Window. Okay. Let's try that. Come on. Do it. Play. Here it comes. Can you see it? Yes.

29
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:30,279
This looks awful on my screen. It's half of my monitor. It's in a cube on the left side of my

30
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:46,860
monitor. Let's go. The elder scrolls three. Morrowind. Can we get the name change of the,

31
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:55,829
you know what I'm saying? Can we get a name change please? The stream name.

32
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:09,860
Oh my God. This text is so small. Why is this so tiny? I can't even see.

33
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:23,660
This is so small. View distance. Real-time shaders. Don't do anything. Don't change anything.

34
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:44,950
Seriously. I'm back. Okay. Okay. New game. Each event is preceded by prophecy, but without the

35
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:53,929
hero, there is no event. In the waning years of the third era of Tamriel, a prisoner born on a

36
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:58,730
certain day to uncertain parents was sent under guard without explanation to Morrowind.

37
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,850
Whatever the rest of that says.

38
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,129
That's cut off. It's cut off for me too, so don't worry.

39
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,179
This dude fucking gave up. I didn't. This was everyone said to play this. Like

40
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:42,179
60% of you said to do this. What? What happened?

41
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:58,870
What's your name? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I need to fix this. Okay. There we go.

42
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:11,259
My name. My name is Morrowind. Last night storm could wake you. I heard them say we've reached

43
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:21,539
Morrowind. I'm sure they'll let us go. Quiet. Here comes the guard. This is where you get off.

44
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:31,750
Come with me. W and S move forward and back. A and D move side to side. You better do what they say.

45
00:10:32,470 --> 00:11:05,750
Put the death counter up. How could you have died this many times in the tutorial?

46
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:25,539
You're playing music way too loud. Spacebar to open it. Whoa. This is where they want you.

47
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:32,899
Head down to the dock and I'll show you to the census office. You finally arrived,

48
00:11:32,899 --> 00:12:03,529
but our records don't show from where. What? Orc, I guess. Great. I'm sure you'll fit right in.

49
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:09,899
Follow me up to the office and they'll finish your release. Oh my God. I'm huge. Hold on.

50
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:34,700
That's as low as I can make it. Yes. We've been expecting you. You'll have to be recorded before

51
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,059
you're officially released. There are a few ways we can do this and the choice is yours.

52
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,960
Answer his questions. Okay. I'll do it. Yeah. I'll get the controller off of my penis.

53
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:57,779
All right. Generate clip. You chance upon a strange animal. It's leg trapped in a hunter's

54
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:07,879
snare. Judging from the bleeding, it will not survive long. What do you do? Use herbs from your

55
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:22,299
pack to put it to sleep. Whereas save the animal. One summer afternoon, your father gives you a

56
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:29,559
choice of chores. What would you rather do? Go catch fish at the stream using a net and a line.

57
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:35,669
Work in the forge with him casting iron or gather herbs for your mother who is preparing dinner.

58
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:41,259
I would probably do this one. I don't know why it's so small. I can't say anything.

59
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:52,139
Can you talk with a louder font? I would go pick herbs from mom. Your cousin has given you a very

60
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:58,700
embarrassing nickname and even worse likes to call you it in front of your friends. You have asked

61
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:06,139
him to stop, but he finds it very amusing to watch you blush. What do you do? Feed him up and then

62
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:09,980
tell him that if he ever calls you that nickname again, you will bloody him worse than this time.

63
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:15,500
Make up an even more embarrassing nickname for him and use it constantly until he learns his lesson.

64
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:20,059
Make up a story that makes your nickname a badge of honor instead of something humiliating. That

65
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:33,019
one. That one. There is a lot of heated discussion at the local tavern over a group of people called

66
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:40,620
telepaths. They've been hired by certain city state kings. Rumor has it these telepaths read

67
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:47,100
a person's mind and tell their lord whether a follower is telling the truth or not. This is a

68
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:53,899
terrible practice. A person's thoughts are his own and no one, not even a king, has the right to make

69
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:58,620
such invasion into another human's mind. In these times of necessary evil, although you do not

70
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,740
necessarily like the idea, a telepath could have certain advantages during a time of war or, well,

71
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,580
I've got another solution here. When we know we're going up against a telepath, just think of the

72
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,779
worst diarrhea you've ever had in your life. Everybody at the same time. When we're charging

73
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,940
into fight, just think of the time you shit your pants and you sprayed diarrhea all over your

74
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,419
fucking underwear and stuff and they would just see it and they'd fuck them up and then you get

75
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:33,620
them. It would work. Everyone has to do it though. We all have to do it. On the death counter.

76
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,980
Loyal followers of the king have nothing to fear. I don't even know. I don't like that.

77
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,940
Pocket the extra money knowing that shopkeepers in general tend to overcharge customers anyways.

78
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,580
Return to the store and give the shopkeeper his hard-earned money explaining to him the mistake.

79
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,100
Decide for the extra money to good use and purchase items that would help your family.

80
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:18,710
I don't know. What's where? What store are we at? Where are we? You're at Walmart.

81
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:32,409
I would probably say, hey, it depends on the store. It's a mom and pop general store. All right. If

82
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:36,570
it's a mom and pop general store, I'm going to be like, look, I think there's a mistake here.

83
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:43,620
I'm not going to do that, right? I know while in a marketplace, you witness a thief cut a purse

84
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,740
from a noble. Even as he does so, the noble notices and calls for the city guards.

85
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:55,299
Marowark. In case to get away, the thief drops the purse near you. Surprisingly, no one seems

86
00:16:55,299 --> 00:17:01,539
to notice the bag of coins at your feet. What do you do? Leave the bag there and knowing that it's

87
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:06,180
better not to get involved. Pick up the bag and signal to the guard knowing that the only honorable

88
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,500
thing to do is return the money to its rightful owner. Pick up the bag and pocket it knowing that

89
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:23,740
the extra windfall will help your family in times of trouble. I don't think I would get

90
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,750
involved in this. It's a noble. So what if I picked it up and brought it to the guards

91
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:36,869
and they go, there he is. That's the man that stole the noble's purse. I'm going to get

92
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:45,750
fucking destroyed. I don't know if I want to get involved in this. Oh, here, I found this. Yeah,

93
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,990
right, right? No, I'm not touching anything. Your father sends you on a task which you loathe,

94
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:55,509
cleaning the stables. On the way there, pitchfork in hand, you run into your friend from the

95
00:17:55,509 --> 00:18:02,309
homestead near your own. He offers to do it for you in return for a future favor of his choosing.

96
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:09,500
Okay. What do you do? Accept the offer, reasoning that as long as the stables are cleared,

97
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,299
it matters not who does the cleaning. Decline the offer knowing that your father expects you to do

98
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:19,859
the work and it's better not to be in debt. Ask him to help you knowing that two people can do a

99
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,539
job faster than one and agree to help him with one task of his choosing in the future.

100
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:37,880
But what's the task? I think I would want to come help me do it because then whatever task...

101
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:57,109
Somebody said, what lame orc are you making? Okay, sorry, guys. There's me smash head with rock.

102
00:18:57,109 --> 00:19:04,150
It's not on this list. It's only me split the difference with friend. What do you want me to

103
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:12,180
do here? No, two of us. Your mother asked you to help fix the stove. While you're working,

104
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,539
a very hot pipe slips its moorings and falls towards her. What do you do? Does that happen

105
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:24,259
to my mother? Position yourself between the pipe and your mother. Push your mother out of the way.

106
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:37,559
Grab the hot pipe. Hmm. I'm doing... Nope. I want option four. Excuse me. I want option four.

107
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:43,579
Put leg out, foot out and have whatever it is hit you in the top of the fucking shoe in a

108
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:47,960
matter how heavy it is, no matter what it is. It's foot out and it doesn't matter how bad it

109
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:58,779
hurts. This could be a phone. This could be a kitchen item. This could be anything. Foot out.

110
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,619
Catch your foot. Doesn't matter if it smashes. It doesn't matter. No, I'm not a knife. You don't?

111
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:11,579
No, no. I'm just saying like I do this with any item. I'm always the person that if they see

112
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:16,700
something about to fall, they go, oh, and they stick. I stick my right leg out to try to catch it

113
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:22,630
hacky sack style with the top of my shoe every time. But if it was an anvil,

114
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:28,630
I would still probably do it. This one. While in town, Baker gives you a sweet roll.

115
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:35,099
Delighted, you take it into an alley. Enjoy only to be intercepted by a gang of three other kids

116
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:40,460
your age. The leader demands... Wait, why are we kids? Or else he and his friends will beat you

117
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:48,039
and take it. But why are we children? Give the sweet roll without argument, knowing that later

118
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,720
this afternoon, you will have all your friends with you and you can come take whatever he owes

119
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:59,509
you. Act like you're going to give the sweet roll, but at the last minute, throw it in the air,

120
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:03,750
hoping that they'll pay attention to it long enough for you to get a shot in at the leader.

121
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:19,500
Drop the sweet roll and step on it, then get ready for the fight. Yeah, um, whereas lift up underarm

122
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,940
and wipe sweet roll all over armpit in a circular motion. They're not going to want it after that.

123
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:38,420
I'm not going to... I'm going to eat it in front of them. Where's eat it anyways?

124
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:47,819
Neither would you. I'd still eat it. It's my armpit. I'll do this one. Entering town,

125
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:52,859
you find that you are witness to a very well-dressed man running from a crowd.

126
00:21:53,420 --> 00:22:02,700
He screams to you for help. The crowd behind him seems very angry. Neutral good orc. What is it all?

127
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:10,569
What orcs? What do you mean? I can't be a good orc? What are you talking about? Entering town,

128
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:13,769
you find that you are witness to a very well-dressed man running from a crowd. He

129
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:19,609
screams to you for help. The crowd behind him seems very angry. Stand aside and allow the man

130
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:25,640
and mob to pass, realizing that it is probably best not to get involved. Okay. Rush to the town's

131
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,119
aid immediately, despite your lack of knowledge of the circumstances. Rush to the man's aid

132
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:35,609
immediately, despite your lack of knowledge of the circumstances. Okay, here's what I'm going to do.

133
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,690
I'm going to get... I'm going to see him running. All right, he's running. There he goes. I'm going

134
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,170
to run to the crowd. First person, the person that's in the front of the crowd is going to

135
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:48,329
know the most information because they want that guy the most. Not the person that's two, three,

136
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:52,410
four, five, ten rows back. That person's just there because I guess I'm here, right?

137
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,170
Whoever's in the front of that line running the fastest to get this motherfucker, I'm going to be

138
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,769
like... I'm going to match speed and I'm going to be like, what do you do? What are we doing? What

139
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:14,170
do you do? What do you do? And then see what he says. This is very contextual. If they're like,

140
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:20,380
oh man, we're just like trying to get this guy and kick his ass for fun and shoving that guy,

141
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,579
right? Like I'm pushing that guy as hard as I can and then I'm going to turn and it's to be like,

142
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:36,859
who? Oh no, but then they'd be after me too. Whatever. Your personality and past reflect

143
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:43,690
a rogue. Okay. Very good. The letter that proceeded, you mentioned you were born under a certain

144
00:23:43,690 --> 00:24:12,950
sign. There's too many of these. Which one of these is good? Which one of these is good?

145
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:39,990
Pick steed. Okay. Interesting. That is correct. Yes, I think. You now have a stat menu. Right

146
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,990
clicking allows you to use your menus when you are done with them. Show your papers to the captain

147
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:53,940
when you exit to get your release fee. Read your papers by pressing space bar. Get yourself a

148
00:24:53,940 --> 00:25:00,980
suitable outfit unless you don't mind being mistaken for a slave or a pauper. Okay. Select

149
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:19,910
skill to train. What? Sneak? I don't get it. Where do I go? I can't breathe this. Hold on.

150
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:52,490
Is there like a make the UI bigger? Can anybody help me? Lower the resolution. Oh my God. That's

151
00:25:52,490 --> 00:26:09,940
horrible. This is so bad. Oh, I think I crashed it. Can you guys see? Is it? It's fucked up.

152
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:20,440
It's fucked up. My whole computer is locked up. Come on, dude. Really? Pick it up. Thank you. All

153
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:27,400
right. Take the death counter off. That joke was funny for five minutes. Mouse. Hello. Where's my

154
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:40,759
mouse? Okay. Let's just go. This is going to be hard to read, but whatever. You'll go no further

155
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:52,940
until you have your papers. How do I take stuff? For release by Emperor Uriel Septim, the 567th

156
00:26:52,940 --> 00:27:00,299
decree to the district of Vvardenfell of the province of Morrowind. Name Morrowind. Race orc

157
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:19,579
class rogue. Signed. Okay. Cool. Take it. Oh my goodness. I can't even see my health. That's how

158
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:26,759
small my fucking health bar is with this resolution. I'm not going to even know if I take damage. Fix

159
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:40,920
the UI, dude. I don't, what do you want me to do? What happened? What are you doing? We'll let your

160
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,480
actions go for now, but once you release stuff like that, we'll get you arrested. I picked a

161
00:27:45,480 --> 00:28:12,779
candle up on your desk. Everything is free in this room. Every single object in this room is free.

162
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:19,420
Stolen for the last time. You've made your last mistake.

163
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:35,079
What the fuck else is in here?

164
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:07,460
Can I sell this? Am I getting bad boy points?

165
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,940
You've made your last mistake, thief.

166
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:35,450
What else is in here? Can I take the rug? Okay. So what do I get? Where's all my stuff?

167
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:48,390
Where's all my stuff? I picked up everything. Wait, what? Did they take it? Oh, they took it all.

168
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:36,549
Stop. I'm trying to fucking get out of here. I don't even know what's in here. Oh, sick. How do

169
00:30:36,549 --> 00:31:11,990
I put this on? How do I equip stuff? How do you equip stuff? Check the barrel. Get the ring inside.

170
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:19,380
Ring of healing. Okay. Take it all. You have a magic menu where you can see all your powers.

171
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:44,089
All right. Press R to ready active magic. What? How do I do this? Right click, drag it. Oh, there we

172
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:59,910
go. Okay. What does that do? Talk to the captain. Don't try persuasion on him. If you're not good

173
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:42,940
at it, he will start to dislike you. Oh, shit. Oh, that's not good. Okay. Well,

174
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:59,460
oh shit. All right. Well, I'm an orc rogue. I know. I know. I know. Orc rogue. I don't care.

175
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:11,819
Last night storm could open MW. We've reached Morrowind. I'm sure they'll let us go. Quiet

176
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:34,819
comes the gun. What did I do to the game? I can't move. I actually can't move. You better do what

177
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:39,700
they say. I don't know. This guy's on drugs, man. What are you guys? What are you guys doing down

178
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:49,210
here? You guys are snorting mushrooms down here. Can I leave? This is where you do what they come

179
00:33:49,849 --> 00:34:01,220
with me. Okay, we're good. By the way, fucking shit that Dr. Manhattan did to you. I'm not a fan

180
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:32,219
either. Not a fan at the end of that movie. Hello. Hi. Good to see you. I'm here. Okay. I am

181
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:47,179
an orc and I look like this. Yes. Great. I'm sure you'll fit right in. Follow me up to the office

182
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:58,099
and they'll finish your release. Why do I hear chewy? Okay, I know what I want to be. I don't

183
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:03,300
need to take all these questions again. Don't steal anything. We've been expecting you. You'll

184
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,099
have to be recorded before you're officially released. There are a few ways we can do this

185
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:17,349
and the choice is yours. Okay, I would like to pick a class from the list. I was what was I?

186
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:28,230
All these are cool. I don't want to be something else. I want to be a pilgrim.

187
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:40,860
Should just be a knight be a thief. Okay. Very good. Merry Christmas. I was like, wow,

188
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:51,480
he's in Merry Christmas. And what would and it was the steed. Okay. Interesting. All right. Goodbye.

189
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:01,659
Make sure this information is correct. Looks good to me. Thank you. See you later.

190
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,699
Show your papers to the captain when you exit to get your release speed.

191
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:13,820
Captain, let's go. See you later. Continue through and talk to Salas Gravius.

192
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:21,449
Pretty good Star Wars. Luke Skywalker is looking at something music.

193
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:32,179
You should learn how to do combat. Pick up the dagger on the table and activate it by space bar.

194
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:54,280
Wait, that was wrong. How do I use it? Okay, press F to pull out your weapon.

195
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:58,710
Once your weapon is ready to hold and release the left mouse button to swing it the harder you

196
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:22,940
swing it. Okay. I can't how do I save the game? F5. I can't save the game right now. You get a map.

197
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:36,260
Okay, cool. Check the barrel to get the ring. Yep. Very cool. I've got my magic item. All right.

198
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:54,119
Nice. Talk to the captain. Hi. Okay, release. Nobody can read this. So whatever. Morrowind.

199
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:59,269
You're in Morrowind. I don't know why you're here. Why you were released from prison and shipped

200
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:06,630
here. But your authorization comes directly from Emperor Rul's symptom, the seventh himself,

201
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:12,539
and I don't need to know any more than that. All right. Okay. You are free, man. Before you go,

202
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:19,139
I have instructions on your duties. What are they? This package came with the news of your arrival.

203
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:27,059
You are to take it to Caius Cossades in the town of Balmora. Go to the south wall corner club

204
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:33,139
and ask for this. Yeah. Okay. We'll find them. Serve them as whatever. All right. All right.

205
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:42,679
Thanks. Report to Caius Cossades in Balmora. Balmora is north of Sidonine. The road passes

206
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:48,039
this village in this fort. So go for it. All right. I got it. You got it. Thank you for everything.

207
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:57,130
Yes. Bye. I feel like I'm fucking gerbil. How do I get out of my? How do I get out of here?

208
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:16,010
Save. I can't save the game. Press J to use your journal and review what you've been told. Okay.

209
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:50,469
I'm sure I don't know how to. Sorry, stranger. I'm training. Shut up. All right. So we got to go

210
00:39:51,989 --> 00:40:20,599
north. Wait, it said check out the trade house. Save. I just did. I saved it already. Popular

211
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:28,760
scrolls. Um, what's the popular scroll? I don't care. I honestly don't care. I suppose it is my

212
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:44,139
duty to help those less fortunate than myself recover some gold. That's right. See, I had a

213
00:40:44,139 --> 00:40:49,420
bad run of luck playing nine holes and lost a bit of money. Normally I'd be fine. We can usually

214
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,940
keep some gold in our pockets just from the money the locals pay us for protection.

215
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,340
But now some of them are holding out on me, especially that little

216
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:03,219
Fetcher Fargoth. He's come up light the last couple of weeks and have shaken them down.

217
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:07,139
I know he's stashing it somewhere. I'd like you to find Fargoth's hiding place.

218
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:14,940
Okay. Yeah, sure. I'm not sure where he goes, but I know he wanders around town at night.

219
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,099
Watch his movements. The best vantage point is on top of the lighthouse south of town. That will

220
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:23,820
give you the nice view of all of this town. Keep an eye on where he goes. Figure out where he's

221
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:34,539
hiding that gold. All right. We got a quest. I will listen outlander, but make it quick.

222
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:48,010
All right, let's go. So go to the lighthouse south of town.

223
00:41:48,730 --> 00:42:08,170
All right. Is that the lighthouse? Can you swim in more wind? What the fuck is that thing?

224
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:29,219
Look at that. How do I pick it up?

225
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:49,829
Just be the dumbest shit you could ever see. Somebody in the town.

226
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,309
Um, how do I pick them up? Can I eat this? Can I pick it up or something? How do I pick it up?

227
00:42:54,949 --> 00:43:02,489
How do I pick this up? You don't have anything.

228
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:14,820
All right. Where's the lighthouse? Bro, I can't even jump in this game.

229
00:43:39,190 --> 00:44:03,590
Yep. How do I eat it? This is gross. Should I not be? That seriously is the Star Wars sound.

230
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:11,719
All right. Where's the lighthouse? Is that the lighthouse here? That's definitely it.

231
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:26,150
Press E to jump. Why would E if you jump? Okay, so I'm going to go up here at night. Wait,

232
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:38,179
can I take this stuff? Never mind. Um, you got any little secrets? Buy from merchants and traders

233
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:45,769
who like you. You get better prices. Okay. Well, of course they treat me better. I'm going to

234
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:57,030
sneeze in his face. No, I'm not. Okay. We're good. No, he's just a yard. That was weird. That was

235
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:04,869
weird. That was fucking weird. Whatever. All right. Anybody up here? I can eat this bread.

236
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:17,239
Is this illegal? This is illegal. That's illegal, but whatever. No one can see me, right? That's

237
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:28,630
illegal, but I can have it. All right. Well, can I just sleep on the ground? I should have cooked

238
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:50,619
the crab meat in here. I'm an idiot. What? What's happening? What's going on? I'm literally stuck

239
00:45:50,619 --> 00:46:08,199
on this. How do I sleep on the ground? T? I don't even know what this guy looks like. Is that him?

240
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:30,440
I don't even know what this guy looks like. What's this guy look like? That's definitely him right

241
00:46:30,440 --> 00:47:25,980
there. Is it a binoculars? That's definitely him right there. He doesn't have a torch anymore.

242
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:40,780
Is that where he's putting the money? That's where he's putting the money. Okay. I know where he's

243
00:47:40,780 --> 00:48:13,019
putting he put the money in the ocean. Okay. All right. I'm going. Got it. Hell yeah. That's a lot

244
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:27,559
of money. I'm not going to bring it back. Heal yourself with the ring. How do I open up the,

245
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:33,380
how do I use magic? Honestly, I would probably bring it back. I just don't know where that guy

246
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:52,659
even is far. I don't even know where that guy was. So it's in the shop. Oh, okay. He's here.

247
00:48:52,659 --> 00:49:05,019
Buy some stuff. All right. What do you got? Barter? Oh, dude, I have so much money now.

248
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:16,329
I'm a thief, right? So could I get like a cool dagger? Shake a fork? Oh, pants. Wait, okay.

249
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:45,130
Armor, iron greaves, iron arrow. What should I get? Why am I yawning? What the heck? I don't know why

250
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:59,429
I'm yawning. I've never yawned on stream before. It's a boring, boring game. I actually have been

251
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:07,880
having fun. Okay. Iron dagger. There we go. That's the one I'm going to take. Iron dagger. Let's go.

252
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:29,940
Where is it? Did I buy it? Um, also I'm going to get, Oh, I already had one of these. Oops.

253
00:50:29,940 --> 00:51:02,389
Maybe like a short sword. What about spear? What's a tanto? No, I want to put them on.

254
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:39,420
I want to equip them. How do I? I can't fucking see anything, man. Offer? Okay. Do I have any

255
00:51:39,420 --> 00:52:33,670
other clothes? I need pants. I'm going to get a sword. Sure. Iron sword. Buy it. There we go.

256
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:58,389
I need a helmet too. Do not start a new fucking game, man. I need a helmet. I don't want to talk

257
00:52:58,389 --> 00:53:13,269
to you. All right. You're supposed to find the hiding place. Did you find it? You found the

258
00:53:13,269 --> 00:53:18,900
hiding place? That's great. Where's the gold? You're trying to hold out on me, Orc? You found his

259
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:31,000
hiding place? That's great. Where's the gold? You're trying to hold out on me, Orc? Um, I'm going to

260
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:52,699
bribe him 100 gold. I hear you, Orc rogue. You're welcome. See? All right. What do you got? Services.

261
00:53:52,699 --> 00:54:05,769
Dump? What? What? All right. I need some, I need some quests. Put me on a quest. Do you have anything

262
00:54:05,769 --> 00:54:13,539
in a specific place or a quest? Oh no, I gotta go north. All right. See you guys later.

263
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:42,980
Balmora. That's right. Bring out the windows magnifying glass. All right. North. What the fuck

264
00:54:42,980 --> 00:55:15,619
do these signs say? Oh, this way. I'm a caravaner. I can transmit you to this place. Nah. Yeah. It's

265
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:37,480
so dark. I can't see anything. Can I turn the gamma up? That doesn't do anything. Oh, what's this?

266
00:55:37,480 --> 00:56:16,519
Yeah, I'll take it. Am I going the right way? Mushrooms. Oh, change the time. Oh shit. A rat.

267
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:56,329
Can hurt rat meat. Yep. This way. How could you do that? I don't know. I'm so blown out now.

268
00:56:56,889 --> 00:57:20,360
Look at me. I'm super blown out. I'm blown out right now. That's better. What does it look? Why

269
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:41,079
does it look? This looks weird, doesn't it? I'm blown out. Why is the FPS so shitty? I don't get

270
00:57:41,079 --> 00:58:05,909
it. Whatever. I tried. I asked a random dude if they liked watching you. They asked you what's

271
00:58:05,909 --> 00:58:40,099
a good anime? Um, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. What is that? Is that friendly? Is this thing asleep?

272
00:58:40,099 --> 00:59:04,980
Can I talk to it? This thing is sleeping. Can you can I ride it? That's cute. I like that thing.

273
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:35,860
Okay, I lost track of where I was going. I think it's this way. That monster is bored. No, no,

274
00:59:35,860 --> 01:00:01,099
this way. Wait, something over here at adventure awaits us. What's over here? Random adventure

275
01:00:01,099 --> 01:01:03,380
awaits in Morrowind. How do you quick? How do you look? What the fuck? What happened to me?

276
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:15,659
What happened? Did I walk into the fire? What? I don't understand what happened. I'm definitely

277
01:01:15,659 --> 01:01:20,599
this too high for me, but whatever. I can probably get the kill. Let's go. Fuck it.

278
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:45,989
How the fuck are you supposed to do this? What class am I? I don't piano player,

279
01:01:45,989 --> 01:01:50,789
whatever it is. Bored. I don't even know. What am I? I got a better idea.

280
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:57,690
You are taking up the in top. How is your body taking up the entire tunnel?

281
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:33,130
That is how how do I heal our right? I don't fucking care. Adventure awaits on the road.

282
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:41,690
This game is 80 years old today. Wait, I can use my other knife. I have another knife.

283
01:02:41,690 --> 01:03:08,630
I can't use that. Oh, Balmora. Oh, a citizen. Is there anything I can do for you to help?

284
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:16,440
How are you? There's a bandit nearby. Yes, I was just walking along here, minding my own business.

285
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:22,519
Suddenly a bandit jumped at me from behind. He was a dark elf, a strong dashing dark elf.

286
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:27,400
He didn't harm me in any way, although he did take my jewels. He was quite gentle and he talked

287
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:38,789
me for a while. What? What is going on? Oh, never mind the jewels. I just want to find that bandit

288
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:46,550
again. He was charming and funny, and I simply must see him again. His name, Nellos, Nellos

289
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:51,670
Anmar, a name that will stay on my lips for eternity. Perhaps you can find him. Please,

290
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:55,909
I cannot live without knowing if you could ever love me. I have nothing to offer you in return,

291
01:03:55,909 --> 01:04:12,579
but could you not help me for the sake of love? Sure. Okay, I'm sure you'll be able to find him.

292
01:04:12,579 --> 01:04:17,219
He mentioned something about having to head north, so I imagine he might be found in

293
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:24,280
Peligaiad. Please, find and give him this glove for me as a token of my love. I'm certain he will

294
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:38,250
want to find me again. Okay, can I keep the jewels? All right, so Peligaiad. See you later.

295
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:01,750
What? What? Oh shit, she's a fucking wizard.

296
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:30,360
Oh, no, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck?

297
01:05:31,579 --> 01:05:50,579
What the fuck? I thought I had this... I'm supposed to be a thief.

298
01:05:54,969 --> 01:06:05,670
Now you have to flee. I don't have to flee, do I? What the hell is going on with this door?

299
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:14,280
What the fuck is this? Did I just let out like the demon bug? Oh my god, it's coming out of me.

300
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:24,389
What the... What is behind that door? That's way... That music is way too heroic for

301
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:33,000
what's in here. Do you understand? That was like a nice... That wasn't scary demon music.

302
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:57,750
Am I even hitting this? Dude, I'm gonna prove to everybody how cool I am. I'm gonna kill this

303
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:29,590
thing. Holy shit, I just killed... I look what I just did. So what was in here? What? It's an electric

304
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:40,679
fence? Why is there an electric fence in here? What are you talking about? That took me so long

305
01:07:40,679 --> 01:08:06,659
to die too. That was an actor. What are you gonna do about it? Huh? What are you gonna do about it?

306
01:08:06,659 --> 01:08:12,489
You're gonna open that door? That trap door? Come on. Why don't you open it? Open it. Open the door.

307
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:22,729
Come on. Open the door. Holy shit. You guys are fucking... You guys are fucking idiots. I can

308
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:51,100
literally just... I can just jump over this. What a shitty door. Can we talk? Open the door. Why won't

309
01:08:51,100 --> 01:09:03,579
you talk? Open the door. Open it. Coward. Open the door, coward. Open the door, coward.

310
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:29,000
Oh my god. I can get over there. I don't know how to heal. I... Is it R? R doesn't do anything.

311
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:38,859
Look. Restore health. How come I can't do it? R. F. Equip the ring. It is equipped, isn't it?

312
01:09:39,579 --> 01:09:52,810
Press T to heal out of combat from enemies. You got bottom right corner on the menu.

313
01:09:54,520 --> 01:10:16,250
Guys, I can't see that. It's... Wait. Magic. The menu. Guys, I can't see... Okay, I have to look at

314
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:25,369
LBS because I literally can't see from here down. It's cut off on my monitor. Where is it? How do I

315
01:10:25,369 --> 01:10:40,710
press it? I can't even see that either. It's cut off from here down. How do I do it though? Not that

316
01:10:40,710 --> 01:11:00,550
one. I don't get it. Down the map. The other menu. Oh, this one? Oh, okay. All right. All right. I

317
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:31,659
got it. Why am I... Why am I sounding like a fucking animal? Oh my god. I'm dying. Fuck this place.

318
01:11:56,100 --> 01:12:09,689
This sounds like Heroes of Might and Magic and one of like the town menus. Does this have... Wait,

319
01:12:09,689 --> 01:12:30,010
I have some stuff. I get... This is 60 bucks? Put a ring? Can I put a ring on?

320
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:51,109
Um, I can't even... I can't read this. Oh, right. Let me heal.

321
01:12:54,250 --> 01:13:03,109
Where's my head? What's berserk? Oh, different spell. Oh, cool. All right.

322
01:13:06,329 --> 01:13:37,960
Let's go. Oh, fucking pop in. I need to... I don't have a sign. Okay. This way.

323
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:59,510
Yeah, you don't have that on you. Whatever. Itchy armpit.

324
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:35,479
Okay. This way. Oh, do you have robot legs? I don't know. No, this way. Did I make it? What's in

325
01:14:35,479 --> 01:14:53,210
here? Wait. Do I have to go that way to... Oh, wait. I killed that lady. Never mind. Still... But hold

326
01:14:53,210 --> 01:15:06,260

327
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:35,060
any rumors? Okay. What do you got in here? Wooden door. Wooden door. Prison tower. Wait, can I

328
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:54,329
release prisoners? This is a really weird prison. Um, what the fuck did I come all the way up here

329
01:15:54,329 --> 01:16:38,779
for? Nice view. Yeah. Can I do anything here? It's just a fort? Um, persuasion. Um, admire.

330
01:16:38,779 --> 01:16:46,060
You notice... Oh, yes. Orc rogue. It's true. Okay. A weapon or something. Maybe.

331
01:16:46,859 --> 01:16:56,069
What can I do here? The back of your shirt looks like a face. It does. Oh, okay. Here we go. What

332
01:16:56,069 --> 01:17:04,890
do you want? Training. Are you a member? No, then my services are not for you. What do you do? I'm

333
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:10,729
a master at arms. I'm a master of all the basic hand weapon types. Willing to train with weapons

334
01:17:10,729 --> 01:17:26,340

337
01:17:48,199 --> 01:18:05,369

Medium armor. Do I have a long blade? Your webcam is fucked. Oh my god. What the hell? It really is.
