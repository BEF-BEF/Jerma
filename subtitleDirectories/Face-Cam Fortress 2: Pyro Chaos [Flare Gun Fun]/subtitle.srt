00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,269
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Basecamp Fortress 2. Playing as the Pyro on Gorge on offense. Can I get this heavy?

2
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:26,940
Yoey! There's a one. And that what? I'm getting quick fixed. Oh, he moved. I'll get him right here. I'll get him right here. I'll get him right here.

3
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:41,090
Hey, what's up, dude? The quick fix. Come here, scout. I will get you. So I got this medic on me. Quick fix medic, baby.

4
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:53,399
That guy just disappeared. Sentry. Oh, there's no way. I need help. I need help. I need help. I need help. Come here, you.

5
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,659
Come on. You are not getting away. There's no way this guy's getting away. He got away.

6
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:09,670
Of course. I say there's no way he's getting away and he gets freaking away. I'm such an idiot.

7
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:18,349
Don't worry. Don't worry. I got this. Don't worry. Oh, don't worry. Don't worry about a thing.

8
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:31,090
No, medic. What? What did the bug up? Where did he come from? Whatever. Get right back into this here.

9
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:41,709
By the way, that's not Dr. Pepper. Blasphemy, I know. It's actually what? What is this? Sparkling grapefruit juice.

10
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:51,609
What kind of weird bastard am I that I'm drinking sparkling grapefruit juice? What planet am I even from?

11
00:01:51,609 --> 00:02:01,469
Hit that sniper. Dude, that sniper is like going like this. What the hell is the medic doing back here?

12
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,780
Walk into it. Oh, you lucky butt head.

13
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,969
So if you're watching this right now, I am currently in North Carolina visiting my sister.

14
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:20,139
Some of you old subscribers will know that I do that every now and then. I think I went there last time during Thanksgiving.

15
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:29,449
Come here. Got him. Got him. Yeah, I went there last Thanksgiving. It was a really good time.

16
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,449
It's a really beautiful house, really beautiful place down there in North Carolina.

17
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:42,509
Dove before he gets that stupid thing off. I'm supposed to hit him. I don't even tell you the load that I'm using either.

18
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:49,689
I'm using the flare gun, the regular just standard flamethrower and the power jack.

19
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:55,319
We need to push this point. We need to get rid of that sentry. Can we take it out? Can I get it right now?

20
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:03,550
Come on. Keep messing with that engineer. Yes. How did I not hit him with that?

21
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:13,509
No. Get on zipped point. Hello. There you go. What's going on, medic? Thank you for the heals.

22
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:28,039
Much appreciate. Damn it. Shouldn't have done that. Mr. Winslow with the face plant. He's AFK.

23
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:38,360
That's not a good thing. You can't be AFK, man. No, none of you guys are spies. Spy check.

24
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:54,550
Spy check. Why? What was that lag? Oh, I was just choked. Wow.

25
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:00,930
I can't believe I actually killed that son of a bitch. Get rid of that sentry. Come on. Yeah.

26
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,930
Tan him again. Do it again. Keep messing with that engineer. Keep messing with him. Yes.

27
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,939
Need some help here. Need some help here. Get me out of there. Damn it. That same heavies.

28
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:26,379
We got to get on that point. Big time. How many sentries are over there? I'm going to go around the left side this time.

29
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:35,430
No, no, no. Where are you going? You're not going to... This guy's probably going to kill me.

30
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:42,379
No, I'm going to miss, but that's all right because he's... Where is he? Where the hell is this guy going?

31
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:52,819
I'll find you. And when I find you, you're going to get your face ripped off. I'll take it. I'll take it.

32
00:04:52,819 --> 00:05:00,779
How can I not hit the guy that's standing still? Why are they both doing that? Why are they both doing this?

33
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:10,100
How many is it going to take to kill this son of a... All right. Fine. I'll just smash you.

34
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:26,079
You want to get smashed? God. Oh my God. That was terrifying. Didn't even need to hit him.

35
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:33,860
We're going to lose. Come on. Give me those heals. Turn around. Turn around, man.

36
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:41,829
I got to try and kill that engineer. That's what I wanted. Get him. Hit him.

37
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:50,740
I'm trying to wait for him just to come across the middle. Oh, this is not good. We're so dead. We're so dead.

38
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,879
Wait. Demoman, go. Quickly. Quickly. Quickly. Quickly. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

39
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:06,620
Yeah. Can I get there in 15 seconds? I don't think I'm going to be able to get there in 15 seconds.

40
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:22,670
What? What? What on earth? I landed on top of that guy's head. Oh my God.

41
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,420
Okay. That's the first time that's ever happened to me.

42
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,420
Imagine if I had the Mantreads on. That guy would have been tombastomped.

43
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,790
Itch. Defense. Damn. Let's play a little bit of the defense.

44
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:41,670
Nice sentry. Very good start. Sniper. Trying to shoot me in my face. And a heavy.

45
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:50,639
This guy's not going to... Maybe he is. I got to get behind him. Come here.

46
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:58,019
Somebody just come here. Two scouts. I'll wrap around you. Yeah.

47
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,639
Give me a heal, man. I need a heal. I need a heal.

48
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:11,819
Damn. You are a jumpy little freak. Close him in here. Close him in big time.

49
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:19,509
No. No. No. Everybody get blown out. This guy's got crits. I'm trying to blow people out.

50
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:32,180
No. Run. Get him. Please. Please die. He's still alive.

51
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:40,649
Oh. No. He died that far. That long after I shot him. He needed to get a health kit.

52
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:45,230
Click, click, click, click, click. They're going to capture this.

53
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,620
No. We can't lose two in a row. We got to hold them for four minutes. Come on, dudes.

54
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:58,279
I might have to switch off pyro. That's something that might have to happen here.

55
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:04,910
Any spies? Don't think so. Medic. That medic is just standing back there.

56
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:13,350
Oh my god. That's a second sick shot of the day. Wrap it up and give it to me for Christmas.

57
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:18,850
Stay away from the sentry. Get this stuff away from the sentry. I got you. Don't worry, buddy. I got you.

58
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:26,310
I got you. Protecting your sentry. Nothing's going to take this down unless a spy comes behind us.

59
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:32,429
We good? That dome man still hanging out here? No, but there's a sniper right there.

60
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:42,500
Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. I'm trying, man. There's nothing I can do, really.

61
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,679
I'm trying to kill him. They came from behind.

62
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:54,740
Oh, now we got to hold this for 11 minutes. We're going to get smoked right here.

63
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:02,509
We are going to get absolutely smoked. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

64
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:08,100
But as you're watching this right now, I'll be on the plane to North Carolina, like I said.

65
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,340
Should be a great time. I love my sister, as I'm sure a lot of you guys have siblings.

66
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,899
Never get to see her that often anymore, which is unfortunate, but I'm going to die.

67
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:26,460
Give me a crit. Do we have anything on the blast point? I don't think so.

68
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:35,590
I think we're just dead. No, no, no. We're going to go demo.

69
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,789
You could always go demo and try to make something crazy happen.

70
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:51,500
Three on the point. Oh, well, that's going to wrap up Face Game Fortress, guys.

71
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
I'll see you all next time. And I got something going up tomorrow.

72
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,500
I got Scare Saturdays. Scare Saturdays is returning tomorrow with the game Gray,

73
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,679
the Half-Life 2 mod Gray. So look forward to that.

74
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,110
I'll see you guys when I get back on Sunday. And of course, take care, everybody.
