1
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:06,910
Early Andy? No, right on time, Andy.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,410
Precisely on time.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,009
201?

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:24,239
Pacific time? How you doing? Well 201, okay.

5
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,679
So in the time it takes to go from 2 to

6
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:30,899
201 is

7
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,740
59 seconds, right?

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,259
So technically if I show up at 2 and

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,340
58 seconds, I'm still on time.

10
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:53,049
Well, you're gonna like, you're gonna like look over my shoulder and see when I clock in?

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:01:00,929
You know, like what if you like just forget to clock in? Well, what if you clock in?

12
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,730
Okay, what if you get there and you have to go to the bathroom or something?

13
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:11,079
You're like, should I get it? I could take a piss real quick. To me, okay, as your boss, right?

14
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,879
I'm as your boss.

15
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,719
You've got it, but you've got like a 10 minute window there.

16
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,109
And I'm talking before or after. It doesn't matter, right?

17
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:22,049
Like you've got like a 10 to 15 minute window where I don't give a shit at all.

18
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:31,950
Like you clock, did you clock in at like

19
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:44,840
208? I don't give a shit at all. I don't care. You know why I have that philosophy?

20
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,299
Sometimes I'm two hours late.

21
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,549
I'm two hours late, but you better be within 10 minutes.

22
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:59,680
That's not, no, you could show up an hour late too. All right, that's fine.

23
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:08,680
What an excuse.

24
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't, I don't, punctual, punctual, I'm not punctual.

25
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,960
Look, shit happens every second of every day.

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh, you got something to do it at like exactly at 2 p.m., right?

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,439
Yeah, but like what if you need gas or something? Like, oh fuck, I didn't get gas.

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Just go get gas. I don't care. It's like 205, 206.

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,080
I'm not gonna look at the clock and wait for you.

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,569
Now if it's more than 30 minutes, then like I'm gonna text you and be like, is everything all right?

31
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,129
Within 10 to 15, 20, move it up to who cares?

32
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:48,770
What are we doing today? That's a good question because it's gonna be really fun.

33
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:52,280
Today!

34
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,580
We are gonna be doing a

35
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:01,180
stream, a special stream. We did this about a year and a half ago, two years ago, and we're gonna do it again.

36
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,479
There's been requests to bring this back.

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,870
It's a really fun time. I don't know what we're gonna get. It's a gigantic gotcha

38
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,389
of every single video and broadcast I've ever done. And what does that mean?

39
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,039
So Lazy Luke, sort of the community webmaster here,

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,439
put together this kind of randomizer of everything I've ever done a

41
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,990
couple of years ago, and we did it and

42
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,550
there's a big, I think as of now, since it's been updated.

43
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,430
The last year or two of streams, it has been put in here, too. So we might get something that happened like a week ago.

44
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,520
So what happens is

45
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
it's a little randomizer site.

46
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,039
You click a button and it's going to give you

47
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,400
a random

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,870
timestamp of a random VOD or video over the last 11 years.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And it totals out to be

50
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,719
something like over

51
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,150
4,000 hours of video, which is about 170 days.

52
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,409
So if you just let this go and just watch every single thing I've ever done, it would take you

53
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,810
170 days straight, 24 hours.

54
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:28,000
Which is weird to think about. I'm surprised there's that much even. It's weird. And we're gonna watch the whole thing.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,379
No, we're not. There's gonna be a few rules here. You better get cracking. No, just hold on. There's rules.

56
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,459
You have to follow the rules.

57
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:44,740
Rule number one. Each one of these has a timer of 120 seconds. I am thinking of making that higher or lower.

58
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,420
I don't know. We have to kind of come to a community consensus on this here. I

59
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
get five vetoes.

60
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,720
Guess what?

61
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,959
You get five vetoes too.

62
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,519
Because if chat is, if chat really wants to skip something and there's a lot of people in the chat saying skip, skip, skip, skip, skip,

63
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:10,939
right? We'll take a general consensus and we'll do a poll. If you vote to veto that means we skip.

64
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:14,959
But I think two minutes is too low if vetoes are in play.

65
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:24,490
Well, that's not gonna work. Well, then I just get five vetoes. Who cares? I'm in control of this shit.

66
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:32,560
So I get five vetoes. I gotta make sure I use them correctly. Five minutes? I think five minutes is too long.

67
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:44,290
Three? Two? How long? What do you think? Five minutes is like as long as entire videos I used to make were. Three minutes?

68
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:52,459
Yeah, three is good. Three is good. That's 180 seconds.

69
00:05:52,759 --> 00:06:03,810
So the last, we got a lot of Nancy Drew last time and also this reversed vetoes too, right?

70
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,730
If I want to stay for more than three minutes, we're staying for more than three minutes.

71
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,759
Also, to make this a little more interesting,

72
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,120
there's gonna be a bingo card of

73
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:23,560
various things that have happened over the years. You know what, let's just do this. Let's get over here.

74
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,910
I pressed it one time and I will watch it for two minutes, okay? I promise.

75
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:38,750
I want to show the, I want to show the board. We're gonna make it even more interesting. Okay, so here we go.

76
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:45,079
So let's change that to 180. As you see here,

77
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:55,019
a lot of these are very possible. If this shows up on the broadcast,

78
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:57,579
we obviously have to put a stamp on it, right?

79
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:05,439
Like this. And if you get bingo, if bingo, I have big rigs in the background,

80
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,839
I know. If you get bingo, then

81
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,639
I didn't really think of, I don't know, I'll give a hundred community subs. That sounds easy, right?

82
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,060
How about this? I'll give a hundred community subs if you get bingo. I'll give,

83
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,170
uh, hold on. How much should I give?

84
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:33,040
How many subs should I give? Let me, hold on. Let me, let me like, think of how like, okay, hold on a minute.

85
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:42,329
What's 250 subs? How much money is that? It's a lot, right? I can't do math in my head. It's

86
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,670
1200 bucks. That's 2, 2, 2, 2, 500 dollars.

87
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,769
1200 bucks. 1250. Okay. Alright.

88
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,350
If you fill the whole board, if we fill the whole board in this stream, by the way,

89
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,949
I have to give a time limit on this stream because if we stay here long enough,

90
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,230
we're gonna get every, we're gonna fill the whole board in at least three or four hours.

91
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:13,610
Horizontal row four is gonna be so easy. You think so? I don't think do it

92
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,209
I don't haven't done doi doi doi that look, okay

93
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,649
We'll go over these because I want to make sure this is really really very clear

94
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:26,100
Jack's moment is when I'm playing a game very very well has to be incredibly clear not just like oh you jumped to that

95
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:32,120
Platform correctly. No like a gamer moment where it's like, holy shit. I can't believe you just did that. Look at me

96
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,080
poses, you know

97
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't know

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,820
You know what I'm talking about and when I put my arms in weird places hog face me know that

99
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,549
Rants are fine rants. You know, I just go off and start talking with something my crazy and a rant does not be bringing up

100
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:52,940
Any topic it's a rant ball joke. We all know that that's when I deliberately fall off of a cliff to make everybody laugh and write

101
00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:00,230
Lul and make me you know, feel happy character voices any impression or character that I'm doing one guy is you

102
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,320
Otto is Otto lich. You don't need a gambling is any gambling on stream

103
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:15,940
It's I'm not gonna say that's like could that be debt oriented. No, I think that's on here, isn't it? No, yeah

104
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,460
That is already on here. See debt ordeal

105
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:21,820
Gambling is not debt ordeal as well

106
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,899
It has to be like I'm playing blackjack or I'm like gambling on the on stream

107
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:32,429
Naked is when I talk about maybe if I talk about being naked which happens a lot

108
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,690
drug

109
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:41,399
It's I don't think that's gonna show up because there's another two years worth of streams

110
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,399
It just became way less likely percentage wise that drew crew will show up

111
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,840
What else is a could be on here that might be you're saying an emote out loud is another one

112
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:59,470
If TF2 shows up if a wrestling video shows up or if I get scared if you get bingo

113
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,789
100 community subs if you fill the whole board in three hours

114
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:15,419
I'll give 250 subs as that's on you just did all I I know but I understand bingo

115
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:19,019
I know what about being high now

116
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,200
That's not on here a lot of community members helped with this

117
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,450
There's been a couple of iterations kind of just grabbed from a bunch of what people were talking about different mods community members

118
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,990
So thank you contributed to this. Thank you

119
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:38,940
It makes the stream that much more fun and I think we can go so can we get him maybe a link to this

120
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:47,539
You probably linked it a few three and a half hours or the deal is off. What no three hours is perfect

121
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,179
You know if you want to open it up and play for yourself

122
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:53,919
And if you want to open up so you can scream at me when something happens

123
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:02,639
Are you ready to go through the ages by the way to test it?

124
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,309
I was going back and forth with a Luke last night. I've tested it a few times and

125
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,570
I landed on really really kind of like cringy TF2 video

126
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:16,690
There was like a live commentary, and I like hated it, so I I'm very ready to use my five vetoes

127
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,279
Already I don't I have to be careful though

128
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,279
I have to see if I can stomach some of those older videos

129
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:30,620
Because if I can then I can save my vetoes for something very important right all right

130
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:39,090
So let's get this off make sure the timer is correct, okay?

131
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:45,269
So this is three minutes, and I did press it once already, so this is I believe a YouTube video of

132
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,419
On the main channel. This is the worst game. This is okay. What's good. Are you ready? I'm ready

133
00:11:52,639 --> 00:12:01,700
Let's go in three face cam not yet if you're good three two one go

134
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:08,279
Oh look at how much fun. This is god damn it. That's not a voice hold on. I

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,399
It's almost a 90-degree angle. I gotta do it that doesn't count

136
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
That's not a funny. That's I do that

137
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,600
Sick Tony Hawk ramp that doesn't count. I'm playing on a half pipe right now. Not a character voice

138
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,039
That's me doing me we do like a 720

139
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:37,000
God damn it no already hold on all right funds over go through this is that I'll take game glitch is fine game

140
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,610
Which is mine is fucking awful truly truly a disgraceful game. I can't think of anything worse

141
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:51,370
I really can't think of a game. That's that's worse than this okay. This is not a brand no

142
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:57,210
It's not it's not a rant. This is not even a video game. Well here. He's a bridge. No good bridge

143
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:01,860
That was fun. Yeah, it was fun going over or something with no detection on it

144
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:10,159
No, it's not a rant. That's complaining. I don't know man if somebody can tell me in the comment section a game

145
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:18,850
That's worse than this. I would can either go. It's gonna be pretty tough. I can't I can't think of anything not not blow oh

146
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:25,720
No, it's okay. Oh look. There's my buddy. This is yelling. Oh, there's my friend. Hey. Hey, remember when you

147
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:33,919
You are winner. Oh, hey, don't worry guys. You are winner. We'll do random race

148
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:39,690
I want a veto already sounds like fun. No, that's not a voice. That's me going like this

149
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,000

154
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,929
Stop doing this. Is it how much time is in the video random race?

155
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:19,330
It's not even enough time in the video to get to the end of the time stop giving me the victory automatically

156
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,769
This game is trying to tell me to stop playing

I understand that this is a game glitch right, but no that doesn't count as a voice that doesn't none of that counts

163
00:14:53,299 --> 00:15:11,669
Anger does not equal rant. That's correct. That's the prime of your career. I'm not cheating. I'm not sure that doesn't count all right

Don't worry. All right. Let me see how like the path of where you can find the best

252
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:20,549
Okay, rumor might not happen wrestling might not happen if you get laughing fit and you get rant

253
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,890
That's gonna be close. It'd be close

254
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:30,470
I really don't want to play this because this is like embarrassing because I get this is like actually like a part of this

255
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,990
This is a stream that I did where I was like pissed out when I turned it off

256
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,819
I was like, I fucking hated that stream. I fucking hated that game. Well, I love the hitman3, but this level well

I'm like actually and this is like the surge to like the surge, right? Okay. Here we go. Let's just go

259
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:57,640
Good luck. Well, let me group these together because this is gonna be a group

260
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:05,859
This is gonna get this gonna start to turn into hell if I don't do this

261
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,480
Okay, there we go. All right resetting timer and

262
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:33,700
Three two one. Let's go. I had to don't sell me the drugs right here. What are you stupid? I save it here

263
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:39,660
Okay, thank God. You can listen to the tone of my voice. I'm already upset about something Richard Nixon impression. Sure

264
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:47,619
I'm fine. When they're pulling the bus, I bring that snob. It's already on there. It's already on there

265
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:57,059
In joke currency fake money, not real one. I'm so predictable. It's just such a joke

266
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:11,210
Why does he drop it on the ground? You notice that so give it to me. That's not one guy. No

267
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:14,730
Should I?

268
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:20,160
You know putting syringe on here wouldn't have been a bad idea

269
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:31,019
That's what I wanted to have happen last time good silent. Somebody will hear me if I stab him

270
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,940
And it ended it down to did it did it did it did it did it down to that?

271
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,900
I'm not a drug dealer. So now I have to walk up to one of these guys and sell drugs to him

272
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:46,589
I think we're yeah, we're missing the part where I go on the rant about it being a concrete level

273
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:52,019
Okay, which one of these guys does the drugs saved see if it's you you were really high on this stream

274
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:56,420
No, I wasn't actually I was lying to you because I didn't want people to think I was a moron

275
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,740
I was fucking probably stone-cold sober on this dream as I said

276
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,099
I was like hi, so people would think I have a moron you you might like

277
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:12,690
You think that why wouldn't he he should put on like a like a ever since I started to tell you guys that I

278
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:17,450
47 never puts a voice on its character voice is already there every time you disguise. He's just like yes

279
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:22,619
I'm here the chef ready to serve you you think if he was an assassin like that

280
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,940
Why wouldn't you put a voice? He's a liar put a voice on

281
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,730
Okay, and would you like some drugs?

282
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:35,359
Why don't you just speak my normal voice this guy doesn't want any drugs

283
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,480
I don't think I just do I do so many voices

284
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,920
I'm probably so annoying to be at it with like a Thanksgiving dinner or like Christmas and shit

285
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:50,700
like at some point I've never been recorded and if I'm the most

286
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,859
Incredible assassin in the world. How do I nobody picked me up?

287
00:28:55,539 --> 00:29:03,539
Like a microphone in an office complex being like the job is done. I just blew it. There we go. I got too close

288
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:05,299

00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:08,670
Not mad yet. Oh

290
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,289
That's right when I shot that person. What is that? That's all right. That's not a rant

291
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,319

296
00:29:52,880 --> 00:30:09,970
What are you talking about got scared? You know, I've come to understand something about myself and about this stream

297
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:13,240
this is not a bingo card for

298
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,799
Things that have happened over the last

299
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:27,279
Eleven fucking straight years. These are things that happen every stream every single one. So

300
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:35,759
Besides big maybe TF2 and maybe special event stream. This is just not a bingo card

301
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,240
This is just a checklist of things that I'm gonna do every broadcast

302
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:46,769
You know, we'll put all on that. I want to watch that. I want to hold on

303
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:54,130
I want to watch this video pause the timer. That's what I want to watch. This video is two minutes long

304
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:59,039
I just want to see this part. This is one of my first t-shirt ever. I don't give up on a garment

305
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,200
This is the crew man t-shirt is now available. Yes. That's right glue man

306
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,279
protector of the innocent

307
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,799
offender of justice and

308
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:12,079
Warden of all that is good and kind has finally caved into marketing

309
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:17,700
It doesn't count not to deliver this shirt to you buying this shirt will take you back to moments like these

310
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:23,700
Glue man's German wrestling debut as a 22 year old newbie under the stage name G

311
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,220
Grossi

312
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:31,099
He made a real splash in his first match when he was nearly killed by Dogman the magical dog magician

313
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:36,500
Was considered at least partially blind each shirt does not

314
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,900
Get of authenticity. I forgot about this might be what one may have looked like if they did

315
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:46,420
Signed and stamped by the father of all contemporary German wrestling

316
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:53,420
George our glue man senior himself, which are mine is a true site of craftsmanship and quality and again

317
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:59,779
No, you don't get one of these how much does a t-shirt like this cost you ask not?

318
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:03,160
12,000 not 8,000 not even

319
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,079
5,000 tired joke to get your very own glue man t-shirt. You need only one low payment of

320
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:16,680
$20 plus shipping and handling a spill joke take pride in owning a piece of German channel history

321
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
brag to all of your friends that we

322
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,759
Depicted character has been deemed out loud as the worst character ever and

323
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:32,480
Useless by the individual who created him these shirts are only available for a limited time and may never be available again

324
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,759
Yeah, they are head over to the spring comm slash glue man to reserve one today. All links will be in the description

325
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:47,660
Yeah, they're available June 2015. Holy shit. That's a long time ago. What a lie

326
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,440
Well, I said they may they they weren't from 2015 to like

327
00:32:53,099 --> 00:33:01,890
2019 this shirt was gone. You could not buy it. You're old. Yeah, I know welcome to how old I am

328
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,299
All right, you're right. Let's keep going. I just want to see that

329
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:11,299
I haven't seen that video in like six years or something. Where do we stand?

330
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:21,900
All right of rumor ends this whole thing for me. Well, not really but you know, we keep going. All right, let's go

331
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:34,420
I'm gonna start the timer back continue to go through the ages. Here we go. Oh shit. Hold on

332
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:53,200
This is just the timer settings. Oops. How did I mess this up? How did I mess this up? What the fuck? Oh, there we go

333
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Okay

334
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:05,779
Streaming the Nintendo I got a time camera off. Yeah, it's gonna be every single character. They're just Bayonetta

335
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:14,079
I'm not on cam yet, though. It's a special event

336
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,159
No, it's not. This is it before

337
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,440
This is like 60 62. This is not a special event. They do one of these every fucking 30 days

338
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,079
That's not a special event

339
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,440
This is e3

340
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,480
I'm telling you if I see Glover, I swear to God

341
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:39,469
It should add a Glover. I'll stand by that

342
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:42,869
Is it if I've got damn it fine. It's a special event. It is

343
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:46,539
Yes, it's e3

344
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,610
all three Battletoads

345
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,760
Which is e3

346
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,760
2018 god damn it. Yeah, okay. That's not just like a Nintendo Direct. This is like e3. I

347
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:08,469
Want to what's the announcement though? I wonder please tell me that they just they just unconfirmed Luigi by putting him in an egg

348
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,630
eternity

349
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:16,710
It's not funny. What about this the big reveal? Who's the new character? Who did they reveal in 2018?

350
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,710
I'm gonna show them. They're gonna zoom in on his face

351
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:22,190
There he is

352
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:29,920
That's right. Every fighter in Super Smash Brothers history is joining about

353
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,880
people are gonna think I'm like

354
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,440
One of these weird twitch channels that just streams random like TV shows and events and stuff

355
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,840
Why is this channel streaming the 2018 e3

356
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,159
I'm not vetoing it with 60 seconds left. This is fine

357
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,719
Even so your starting roster may be as small as the original Nintendo 64 game

358
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:08,780
No, new characters conditions for unlocking fighters and we want to make the process interesting

359
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,380
So I want to know what I have to say about this though. I feel like I have a really shit take on this

360
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,989
Come on give us unbalanced video game

361
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,869
What exactly is this frame it's me watching

362
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:33,349
4000 hours of videos

363
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:45,150
You have shit takes on everything no, I don't what about what I said about peanut butter

364
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:49,309
Link dawns as champions tunic from the legend of Zelda breath of the wild

365
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:54,710
His bombs are now remotely detonated and his final smash. We're going on

366
00:36:55,269 --> 00:37:01,090
Way so they still haven't fixed this because I've tried to go back to direct x9

367
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:06,809
No, no, I was gonna do these commentaries. I tried it still didn't work. I still was getting terrible frames per second

368
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,849
I've tried everything so

369
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:14,849
Don't leave a comment telling me to change my video drivers or something cuz I've already done it

370
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:18,769
So I come up behind this heavy get him with the backs. I'm gonna beat on this one

371
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,769
I don't want to talk about another tip

372
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:24,409
Look at what I have equipped right now as my disguise as a medic

373
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,409
I'm using the bone saw right now

374
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:32,210
You can switch what we're just holding out of the skies if you hit B while you're holding your different weapons

375
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,130
Too many spies walk around if they're just guys

376
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:41,809
Let's just say you're disguised as the back words if you're walking around with a syringe gun out as the medic as your disguise

377
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:48,610
People are gonna know you're a spy because what medic walks around with his syringe gun when there's no enemies around exactly

378
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,650
So make sure you're aware of the different items

379
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,050
So me and this sniper are going toe-to-toe

380
00:37:57,289 --> 00:38:00,050
No, actually what happened was fucked up

381
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:04,329
Somehow you killed that guy and this revolver is really really fun to use

382
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:08,449
It's really really powerful the whole point for me coming back here was to take off the teleporter

383
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:12,869
I figured it was gonna take too long for the sapper and I was right because look at these people coming out to try

384
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:17,670
And get me I get away with my life intact and I decloak right behind this rock

385
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:23,389
Like I told you before this is fine fantastic for decloaking because look nobody seems to know or care

386
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:26,309
so I'm following this line of people and

387
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,070
This is where the dead ringer shines as you'll see in the next second or two here

388
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:36,110
Get this engineer get the sentry gun pull out the dead ringer guys run behind everybody

389
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,949
You know, you're just gonna die and use it

390
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:42,070
Don't be afraid to take something out to give some get on to every single person again

391
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,070
I didn't make this video like two weekends ago

392
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:49,869
Come right back. I made this video before the game. I think was free

393
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:54,829
12 years ago or something row I get this engineer

394
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:58,630
Of course, like this is gonna be outdated in medic and the heavy he was healing

395
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:01,329
Pull it out Brinson repeat again

396
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:06,550
That's the best part about the dead ringer is if you have a set route pretty much

397
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:13,750
Plan out a route you're gonna take and just do it every single time people are very very ignorant to dead ringer spies

398
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:16,469
They never check and they always lose their ground

399
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:21,829
So I get that sniper I get this scout pull the dead ringer out. We turn around

400
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:25,590
We try and do it again. Fuck this and John knows

401
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,730
Video I'm vetoing starting to wise up a little coffee everywhere

402
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:35,429
Dammit right behind these rocks. Oh, this sucks. Awesome. Oh fuck this video come up here

403
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:42,570
I'm jumping doesn't work so clean and right here is a totally totally horribly embarrassing things stop talking

404
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:48,250
I got a beer back. I actually have to bear back. I swear to God. I'm not kidding. I'll be right back

405
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:57,739
I'll be just one second. I guess I gotta clean this up before it stains

406
00:40:19,750 --> 00:41:45,179
I'm not even muted. Whoops. All right, it's coming up. It's coming up. I just give me another minute

407
00:41:45,179 --> 00:43:32,090
I think I'm okay. It's coming up. Damn it. I've been so good about keeping this area so clean

408
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,409
Then I dump up fucking coffee on the ground

409
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,690
Swinging a spy around

410
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:47,250
Mocking my past self. It's like yeah. Yeah. All right. Wait, let's go

411
00:43:47,889 --> 00:44:03,190
Finish the stream hurry up. I want to play terraria. You just put me in a tab man. Oh, that's all right

412
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:19,170
Just put me in a tab. I we got to update the bingo card, which goodness. Okay, we have some new additions

413
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:35,059
TF2 this is actually filling up Jax to really because I got like three four kills in a row

414
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:43,619
All right, I guess that makes sense. Yeah

415
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:48,380
No, like okay getting three backstabs in a row is spy in 2011

416
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,079
I mean

417
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:57,320
Okay, this is important too. This was right after they changed the knife to be instant instead of it taking a full second to swing

418
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:08,179
That's not a Jax moment. Yeah, I disagree. I disagree right after this changed back in like 2010 2011

419
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,980
spy was insane for like a month or two straight because nobody was used to the fact that it took

420
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:20,039
Less than less than a second to stab somebody in the back, but I will give you the special event

421
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,599
Oh, no, I just have to say that by the way, this doesn't count

422
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:32,030
I'm just giving you a reference when I say something like monkey ass or like a pog jam like yeah that

423
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:36,659
This is gonna end pretty quickly. I think all right

424
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:39,659
let's put the time to get the timer back here and

425
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:53,380
Continue in three two one we move

426
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:59,820
Like five people guaranteed if he has more than a few shots and he can land them far too often

427
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,699
I'll see engineers standing by their sentry guns with the glowing bright shotgun

428
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:06,019
Just doing nothing

429
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:09,599
I'm gonna be I feel like if you start to heal those people and tell them over Mike

430
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:12,840
Hey, how many revenge crits do you have? Oh, I got

431
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:18,539
17 hey you want to go kill the whole team right now. It's like I'm no brainers

432
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:23,460
I have five videos right there that was me building the sentry gun and it took about 30 seconds

433
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,260
Maybe it's nothing happened. I didn't die

434
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,739
It was just really boring so I didn't didn't want to have you guys have to sit through that

435
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,579
But killing that sniper right there and people freak out

436
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:35,219
I've said this before in other gameplay commentaries that when you get hit by a crit

437
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:40,260
What is it you get shot in your stomach breaking record whether it's a rocket whether it's a shotgun doesn't matter

438
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:46,300
You freak out a little bit, and you go. Okay. There's crits. I gotta run by oh by the way one shot kill right there

439
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:51,420
You sound like an asshole what I mean right when you see a crit scree when a medic pops a crit scree

440
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,920
I don't somebody and their weapons are glowing you immediately go here comes crits

441
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,059
I'm gonna die the same thing can be said about somebody that has a frontier justice

442
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:04,380
That's glowing even when I'm not playing engineer

443
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:10,059
I could be playing soldier or I could be playing spy this is not if I see the glowing shotgun I go

444
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:17,769
Your aim omega low shit, and I either back up or I go for another target. That's what goes through everybody's mind

445
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:24,170
So this is the second century that's built to completion now get a few kills that spy was 90 seconds ringer

446
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:29,610
Always tell when a spy's a dead ringer when you shoot them one time from far away, and it does two damage

447
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:34,250
But it magically kills them so dead ringer spies. I do that too though everybody does that

448
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:41,650
So I got four kills on this century, and I kind of do something really really outrageous tips and

449
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:46,530
Not recommended to most people that are playing engineer because we have this one point

450
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,050
We only have three minutes to go and I

451
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:53,969
Destroy the century to get the crits. I'm such a greedy bastard

452
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:59,489
Bad idea. This is a good idea. Yeah, let me just destroy the century you put it immediately quick enough

453
00:47:59,489 --> 00:48:06,489
You can get a century built back to complete. Oh, yeah quickly especially when I have that dispenser right there a full level three dispenser

454
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:09,690
I'm not worried about it at all right now. I'm just curious

455
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:15,110
I want to try and look around try and get some more kills soldier right in his face 180 damage remember how I said that before

456
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:20,030
180 looking around perusing seeing if I can get a shot on somebody get a kill

457
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:24,449
I miss a few times, but I get the kill on him anyways from long-range crit guys

458
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:29,929
Don't be afraid to do this if you're afraid to do this if you think you need to stand by your century at all times

459
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:31,610
And I go for life

460
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:36,489
I mean that's true, but it's not true enough where you can't go have a little bit of fun

461
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:42,130
Remember a spy is gonna try and backstab you and take out your century and all your buildings

462
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:47,659
So what happens if a spy just saps all that stuff right now the map is small enough where I'm gonna be able to get

463
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:52,179
Back to at least one or two of my buildings preferably the dispenser or maybe even the century

464
00:48:52,219 --> 00:49:00,099
It's really not we're going go go go I need to like feed this guy drugs, so he doesn't die surgeon simulator almost almost

465
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:07,539

469
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,119
Okay, the doors are closed

470
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:35,309
Vito damn done Vito. I think anybody's gonna do this. I think I just wasted like two hours of my time

471
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:39,360
Would you do it? I would never do this no this video is awesome actually

472
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:42,639

474
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:52,039
He's gonna crash into people

475
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,510
It's if you're alive

476
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:59,030
He's making it into the pool. I love this video was a lot fun to make it in the pool

477
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,610
It's safe. It works

478
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:06,219
Come on. Let's go

Anybody else

486
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:39,389
Pause it see he is about to jump off this high dive right now, and he thinks he's going in the pool

487
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:42,820
Well, what we're gonna. Do is we're going to replace

488

Let's replace a is evil part of this pool that he's about to dive into with you know just just like that

489
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:59,699
Let's just see what happens. Let's see how it happens to this guy. Oh, don't tell me you wouldn't do it either

490
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:02,900
Yeah, you would do the same thing. Yeah, there he goes

00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:18,510
Are you serious? You're completely fine after that. I'm not hungry

493
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:27,019
He's fine. All he has to say is I'm hungry coming through

494
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:34,500
Beach hut was really good value. I'm not that hungry right now. He's shocked by his own video jumped off of a

495
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,739
5,000 foot platform into the ground

496
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:44,519
Got right. What are you fucking spider-man? I made this feel like nine years ago. I don't remember. Oh shit

497
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:49,219
We're at the end. That was a good one. I like that one at the timer doesn't matter for this one

498
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:59,500
Are we good? We updated? Yeah, we're up did no bingo yet

499
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:08,019
No, you'll know when it's actually rant. You'll know we won't even have to have an argument

500
00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:16,800
We won't we won't even have to talk about it. It'll be so so obvious. All right, let me uh, let's go

501
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:35,489
You ready the timer reset and let's go. Okay, the end of this video the last one second. Okay, let's keep going

502
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:46,579
You're one almost done solar system, which this is a Stardew Valley stream or tonight

503
00:52:46,619 --> 00:53:00,139
I'm gonna make a couple more planets. Holy shit. This is old. I can't believe I'm actually doing that by the way veto

504
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:05,420
Why these bat wings to sell for a lot? I remember correctly

505
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:09,659
Let's just go. I'm not wasting a video. I already have I've had four vetoes left

506
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:16,639
I'm gonna waste a video on this. Oh god. I don't care how boring this part of the enemies

507
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:18,639
I'm not wasting too many people down here

508
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:25,030
We have a video want to die down the well gonna have to vote for that. You have to vote for it

509
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:34,690
Geez, I hate these little dust mites to the worst. They're too erratic

510
00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:40,210
The stream sucks. Hey Stardew Valley is like where I started. Okay on like streaming on twitch

511
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:51,199
Anymore food eat this I'm gonna have to go down here. It's like one of the best video games ever made

512
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:53,239
You know, it's a fishing pole

513
00:53:53,239 --> 00:53:55,559
Scared the shit out of me. I thought that something happened to me

514
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,449
Why did I have that selected?

515
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:07,119
What a fun game. I love boring Andy. I was in tear look

516
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,639
You do understand it's everything we could get me sitting there

517
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:18,400
You could get like the credits of the stream and I would have to stay there like you might get like the end credits

518
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,239
It's of a random stream. It's very possible. But truth be told. This is the most enemies

519
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:25,659
I think I've seen in the game so far in one room. Whoa

520
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:29,539
What if we got a veto dwarf scroll to I already got dwarf scroll three

521
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:35,059
That's a worst version of the spell that I are. No, look at all these knows. I ain't going anywhere

522
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:47,719
Look at all these knows that one looks different. Is it gonna explode? You know, I mean look he's doing the he's doing the thing

523
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:52,199
That all enemies do right before they blow up this 50 seconds left where it doesn't take that long

524
00:54:52,480 --> 00:55:01,489
So weird and like just looking into like a sword with telescope into the past weird

525
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:09,300
How come my voice got higher? Please be better than my broken Trident new microphone and I aged 10 years

526
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:14,960
I think the speed is cool. You know, this weird thing happens when you get older your body changes

527
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,920
You don't stay like 25 for your entire life. This is a stab

528
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:23,639
You you age a little your vocal cords to get a little different you get a little gravelly

529
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:32,920
You microphone settings might change. That's it. Plus two speed and second actually making me faster

530
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:44,139
I can't tell where we're going. Where we're going. You see no ink part two. This is a banger. I know that for a fact

531
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:04,960
Okay, guys, oh

532
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:16,719
This part to pasta ataliado. They all go and start like a war at the restaurant. This game is so good

533
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,369
We've got a corner the chef market this game this was the funnest thing I've ever done

534
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:27,559
You need to extend the time for this one because then I'll be the only restaurant

535
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:37,550
Isn't no the casino games are there but I'm not playing it's a heavily guarded fortress

00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:07,440
Oh, they're all in. Okay. Wait, maybe we should extend. Okay, let's extend this this part

00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,570
All right, who's gonna take the shot? Who's gonna make the first shot here?

548
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:16,650
I remember just being in a different room or something just hearing that through the mic

549

553
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,380
Oh

555
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:26,400
By the way, this is like if you've never played casino, Inc

Get out. This is like one of the best games ever made. It's so fun. It's so much fun

557
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:36,019
It's the most absurd fucking game ever

558
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,940
No, no more hitmen stop coming in

559
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:47,099
That laughing fit like if a chef walked out that fucking door if a chef comes out that door then

560
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:51,860
Then this is owned by a trillionaire. Let me matter

561
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,860
Not quite

562
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:58,400
If a fucking chef opens this door

563
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:10,380
Does it happen? I don't remember. Can we extend to find out? I'm curious

564
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:22,820
Oh, no, they all just go in the elevator, right?

565
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,230
So many people in that elevator

566
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:43,380
Extend no, no, we're not just gonna extend this one over and over again. We have we have a hundred and seventy days

567
01:00:44,119 --> 01:01:06,250
Straight 24 hour periods of videos to see so this is good. What was this guy doing? All right, we're going let's go

568
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:10,980
Let's go. Come on

569
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:38,010
I was in retaliation. It was the old guy

570
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,800
He took like seven shots

571
01:01:54,130 --> 01:02:01,150
I'll include it. All right. All right. All right

572
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:06,139
I

573
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,420
Remember this place I just attacked this place

574
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,820
And they got back to normal and they started a fire again

575
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:19,539
Those who they didn't see this dream that this restaurant was on fire two days a week

576
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:21,739
They burnt this place down two days a week. It was

577
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,690
All right

578
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:31,570
He just walked in all right

579
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,280
So that is like this is not bingo, right? Oh, I don't think so not yet

580
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:54,619
Where's laughing fit?

581
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:58,059
Damn it. You're getting close. You're getting really close in God

582
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,239
Naked of rumor saying an emote out loud

583
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:13,400
Text oh one of your staff is dead. What? What are you talking about?

584
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,119
One of your staff is dead again

585
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:26,340
Gambling no, I have to gamble. It's not what it's not just a gambling on the screen. It's me gambling different. All right, let's go

586
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:31,900
razor death at her

587
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:38,119
Wrestling shit is gone. And here comes next already on there

588
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:44,139
Next is number 12 almost to the halfway point which what year is this? Oh German short 2k 18

589
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:51,360
That's clothesline not over-the-top ropes, but just barely into this is like the chat meme rumble right two planets in here

590
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,699
And remember the planets are in here just to make this more difficult for the shit memes

591
01:03:56,219 --> 01:04:00,769
Remember. Yeah. All right. This is really important to remember if a planet wins

592
01:04:00,769 --> 01:04:05,110
Yeah, there you go laughing about it a little bit just a small amount just eliminated German Jupiter

593
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:10,260
Who's this? Who's this gets that much easier for one of these shit memes to stay alive?

594
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:15,480
Who's the guy with the green hat and number 13? I?

595
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:22,369
Didn't say an emo who's still in it who still could be talking about no

596
01:04:22,369 --> 01:04:28,699
I didn't time to leave what I say for sure. Maybe persevere through this whole thing turbo late

597
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:35,909
Oh, what the hood stay and persevere through the whole thing or could he just get eliminated by himself?

598
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:39,630

01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:14,340
Somebody saved the planet pile driver that move is illegal bingo German just did a move that has been banned since 2002

605
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:20,139
You understand that's how fucked up and angry and that's just yes, right? Yeah, it's fine. It counts

606
01:05:20,659 --> 01:05:23,030
Loud P coming in at 14

607
01:05:23,269 --> 01:05:30,030

608
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:34,559
I don't think we're gonna fill the whole board actually I could do with any of these

609
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:39,489
Except for short German and next oh these are characters

That just got here or the head didn't know don't know how we're doing

616
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:17,880
This is a website that is set up to randomly play a video and a random time stamp

617
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,840
That was loud of every broadcast and every video I've ever done speaker in his ass

620
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:47,269
This is where I need to remember again. It's you go up through the this is going to the tree

621
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:57,920
Oh, this is gonna be some massive anger water wheel. Whatever the hell it is, right? I sound really deflated here

622
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:06,900
Oh fuck you don't have the thing. This is blight town. You got it. You got a really good possibility for a rant here

623
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:17,079
I don't have the thing go this way you died to pinwheel

624
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,849
He holds up. He this is PvP PvP and multiplayer

625
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:26,190
Just kind of messing around in multiplayer. What?

626
01:07:26,949 --> 01:07:33,260
When did I did that? Who did I PvP?

627
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:42,610
This is remastered and let me actually our souls remastered part

628
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:45,449
It's this is like the last on the bar because I know it'll be a problem

629
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:57,030
Trying to wonder where this would fit. I just know it will so all right now from here. I gotta go the origin of the sub sound

630
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:02,750
that's from Monster Rancher that is one of the sounds a monster makes and

631
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:06,349
Everyone thought it was really funny because it sounded like

632
01:08:07,429 --> 01:08:09,429
Tim the tool man

633
01:08:10,429 --> 01:08:14,570
Oh

634
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:18,529
That was a kind of funny. I just became the sub sound for like three four years

635
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:23,939
It's not me. No, it's not me

636
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:28,770
Wait, you guys thought that was me

637
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,569
See how many people can read phantoms only?

638
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:34,720
Pull them all in no

639
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:41,039
That's a sound file from Monster Rancher. I'm gonna keep going up right keep going up

640
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:52,130
We I think we're safe on this one. This is just me walking around and boring Lee filling dead air. It's perfect

641
01:08:55,409 --> 01:09:00,300
You guys not get another bingo. That's how you go to get the the soul, but I don't even really want it

642
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,460
I'm really surprised. We have not seen an end of the screen bit reading

643
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:13,560
Why am I feet yellow because the whole character's yellow? That's kind of actually surprising

644
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:26,239
This is 12 year old let's play of Dark Souls. No, this actually is a probably two year old. Let's play of Dark Souls

645
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:28,239
This is the remastered again

646
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:35,579
Happy with our two words. I am completely lost. There's no way I'm gonna

647
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:40,779
We did that very silently. We all knew you dick. This is an old one

648
01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:43,140
It's just me and like this weird hermit guy back here now

649
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,720
I like this video

650
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,210

651
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:57,689
Too bad rats is not one is it also we're wearing bandanas and look like pirates

652
01:09:57,810 --> 01:09:59,810

Customers, but I'll talk the people you got to show them to their seats

656
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:14,920
I'll lower their expectations lower their expectations cuz they're gonna probably throw up after eating one of our burgers

657
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,050
I wonder did it get to the party. Oh, where is it? Where's the video? That's pretty far?

658
01:10:18,569 --> 01:10:22,930
Yeah, still we have to make burgers. We have to make our own delicious cheeseburgers by second rule

659
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:30,239
Start with the bun and hey, I have everyone get away from each other because we're just gonna knock into stuff

660
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,409

661
01:10:34,329 --> 01:10:39,489

01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:16,550
You're really looking for of rumor rumor is really the only way you can get anything again

693
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:27,220
Replay the video. No way. That's not how it works. It's only a matter of time. It is actually it's possible

694
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:33,050
There was a lot of times that happened in Vegas, but this is taking from every single arc

695
01:14:33,149 --> 01:14:41,989
This is taking from Boston arc Vegas arc Vegas arc to right. All right, let's keep going

696
01:14:42,069 --> 01:14:51,409
Where are we gonna go next?

697
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:54,779
Nitro

698
01:14:55,579 --> 01:14:57,579
Nitro is kind of crazy

699
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,600
Road redemption

700
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,000
Nitro again, this is not my job

701
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:13,640
It's okay. I'm still alive. I can still do this. No, this is not a rumor. Let's go you son of a bitches

702
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:19,420

703
01:15:19,579 --> 01:15:21,060
Boy

01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,420
Did you see how much stuff has got crashed?

705
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:25,420
Oh

706
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:35,270
Laughing fit is a free space

707
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,420
You know, I saw the German laughs at car crashes compilation, it's like four hours

708
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:58,340
Oh, I don't laugh at just car. Okay. I laugh it. It's the end of the video

709
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:03,109
I don't laugh. Okay. I don't just laugh at car crashes. Okay, I laugh at

710
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:10,850
Just chaos like just carnage chaos is like just anything that's absurdly happening makes me laugh

711
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:19,699
That's just the way it is anything car like crashes in a game. Oh, just like absurd on their own, right?

712
01:16:19,779 --> 01:16:25,420
Where we gone? Here's a fine. This is the another movie's mouth

713
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:34,039
I think I'm gonna veto this happening with his mouth here

714
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:46,550
But whatever we're gonna send it a character creator for three minutes veto. I'm using my second veto. I have three more

715
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:50,220
go

716
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,850
first-rate stranglehold

717
01:17:04,739 --> 01:17:17,989
I don't even remember playing this game. I got over. I don't even know what this is. Who's left one guy

718
01:17:19,689 --> 01:17:24,939
Jax no, this is easy

719
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,890
I could have been fine

720
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:37,739
One guy nope has to be one guy in chat

721
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,460
Just leave go

722
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:54,250
You said one guy no, it has to be a reference to one guy in the chat. I stuck here forever

723
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,250
I need to like leave this building

724
01:17:56,689 --> 01:18:05,989
Get me out of here. I'm stuck here forever. I can't leave this game. I'm decent. I just I have no memory of this

725
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:08,090
Why?

726
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:16,590
Please look up. I don't know. I I don't know who this is. I'm not even me playing

727
01:18:18,989 --> 01:18:23,750
Dick shot purgatory. That's what we are. I can't get out

728
01:18:24,609 --> 01:18:27,840
There has to be like an exit right like to the kitchen

729
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:33,300
Stupid what am I supposed to do? How do I get out of this?

730
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:42,640
Like a second running from me. I don't know. I can't tell I

731
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:48,739
Don't even know what's going on. This is never ending enemies. I need to escape. What the fuck?

732
01:18:49,420 --> 01:19:03,989
I'd play the whole thing and probably how far into the okay. This is 39 minutes into it. Oh boy. This ends in 20 minutes

733
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:09,430
Get me out of here. Get me out. I just need to find the exit. He's upstairs. It has to be

734
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:14,819
Finally stream this game for an hour. I don't think I need I think I need to kill everybody

735
01:19:14,819 --> 01:19:20,939
I don't think there is an exit. There's no way

736
01:19:29,449 --> 01:19:36,489
This is okay, which I think I found the secret called zombie staircase

737
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:46,640
We're good, I think this is one of the Xbox 360

738
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,899
Screens the stairs

739
01:19:51,500 --> 01:20:00,409
So whatever you guys want to see first I was like into that one, but tonight tonight tonight we have obviously

740
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:05,069
Was this late shift something else we're doing. Oh, it's like an if this is the though

01:20:05,069 --> 01:20:07,069
This is the FMV game get this down here

742
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:10,729
All right, we're gonna play casino ink. Look. I don't know anything about this game

743
01:20:10,729 --> 01:20:15,250
I saw it on Steam and I saw it actually on Amazon first and I was seeing if it was on Steam

744
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:19,489
Oh if he only knew right this game is gonna be fucking stupid, but like there are a couple of options

745
01:20:19,489 --> 01:20:22,449
We have a couple of game sucks options. Oh, if he only knew so don't worry

746
01:20:22,449 --> 01:20:29,449
I was talking about how that could be like and maybe it looks like it sucks and bring this up

747
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:34,739
Should be working now and here's the one problem with this

748
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:45,390
It's gonna be really hard for me to see any like bits and like right when I say that

749
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:48,390
The second I say that here comes fucking glue man

750
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:55,819

751
01:20:55,819 --> 01:20:57,819

01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:17,859
KXE's went through I'm not sure sticks went through because they were gonna be another two when I'm gonna say anything

756
01:21:17,859 --> 01:21:20,880
It's gonna be two minutes and some of those just pretend some of those suplexes were from you

01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,880
Are you kidding me? Cheer? Cheer? Cheer?

01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,430

763
01:21:45,229 --> 01:21:51,590
You're here right now mod James. No, no, we're not doing this joke tonight. No, that joke is done. What's going on James?

764
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:55,560

01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,600
Phallus1916 cheered

01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:20,909
45,000 bits. Who's talking? What? No, no, the winks are only for when they're in stream. Somebody gave like

770
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:23,750
$450 earlier

771
01:22:23,989 --> 01:22:27,189
Okay, I'm gonna veto this if it doesn't get end in 10 seconds or 20 seconds

772
01:22:27,989 --> 01:22:33,609
I have no idea. I didn't see it pop up or anything. Okay, everybody that was okay before this ends

773
01:22:33,609 --> 01:22:36,090
Thank you. Thank you

775
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:44,090
No

776
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:50,069
Grub. The gum you like is coming back. Grubinsky makes the 20 community subs. Is it gum that I liked? No, we're not extending. Go

777
01:22:50,069 --> 01:23:07,939
Oh, oh, although this is a really relaxing part. So I think we're fine. I think we're good

778
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:18,750
This is gonna take two minutes I can't move by oh god damn it. I'm so sorry. I'm trying to move do it again

779
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,840
Picked a perfect place. I just like cut them off

780
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,319
My hair is permanently messed up from when I smashed the coffee into the ground

781
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:34,710
From the top I

782
01:23:35,869 --> 01:23:39,000
Could veto this but I'm not gonna

783
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:44,760
Go outside why it's all right, like they're gonna do it again we're gonna again as a joke

784
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,760
I'm not doing it. I want to hear the whole thing

785
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:55,880
Come on guys, what's with this patience?

786
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:02,850
Can you break? No, I'm good. Extended or suffer the consequences. No, no, this is not how the game works

787
01:24:07,989 --> 01:24:15,979
Take a break you should go BRB. No, I'm fine. Oh, that's why you're saying

788
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:17,859
easy

789
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:20,680
Easy, don't don't let me get the spray can

790
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:23,649
Don't let me get the fucking spray can if everyone's to talk

791
01:24:25,369 --> 01:24:27,560
Stop it

792
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:42,119
What the fuck is he doing? That's to get the shit out of me and I did it like fucking nitrous oxide by webcam

793
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:47,210
Holy shit. I look look I look like deranged

794
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:55,850
I look red and sweaty and what the fuck well you can't just like freaked out. I

795
01:24:57,220 --> 01:25:04,010
Hundred and three not 114. I'm so glad this is not in the middle of me freaking out the bumblebee level actually wait

796
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:08,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's go. I want to see what simple does just out of curiosity

797
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:13,579
Simple what does it do? I beat the game? I think the nice bosses. We're gonna go to you. We'll go. Yes. That's true

798
01:25:18,039 --> 01:25:21,260
Like is it really simple now, you know how we feel

799
01:25:23,539 --> 01:25:28,579
Not really. I mean, it's pretty simple. It's fairly simple

800
01:25:30,489 --> 01:25:32,289
Damn, when's the DLC for this game gonna come up?

801
01:25:32,289 --> 01:25:36,729
I guess this is cold, you know, if you have to co-op with like you like little brother or something

802
01:25:37,529 --> 01:25:41,130
And you're teaching somebody the game. I can understand how this would be 24

803
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:44,130
No, no, it wasn't

804
01:25:44,409 --> 01:25:46,409
You want to like co-op with a friend?

805

Holographic spree is worth like is worth like

$500,000 you're gonna try to rip me off right now

01:26:30,039 --> 01:26:34,500
There's only one in the world, but I've got the one with Japanese text

814
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,380
Do you really?

815
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:38,380
Do you do you seriously have that?

816
01:26:38,779 --> 01:26:43,060
Do you see you guys ever like play Pokemon trading card? Do you seriously have that card though?

817
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:51,680
Cuz I kind of want it with the Japanese text. I hope I'm still funny like ten years later

818
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:58,159
That went right into his mouth dude, are you alright? Please get me to a doctor. I'm sorry. Just chill out

819
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:02,760
I gotta pull the arrow out though. Um, hold on. Just don't talk. Get it out of me mate. Come on

820
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:07,159

01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,489
Fucking murdered this guy

822
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:16,010
Turbo, where are you? Can't get you away from the scene of the crime. It was alright. I want to see your trophy

823
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:19,989
No, oh, he's gone. It's too bad. It was it was absolutely heinous looking

824
01:27:21,609 --> 01:27:25,590
It was it a sniper. Is it this boo?

825
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:33,020
Now that took a lot to do that. This was this was the old the old crew. All right, I found nobody nobody

826
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:37,279
Nobody scared the spy. I found a spy. I'm it's guaranteed that he's a spy

827
01:27:38,279 --> 01:27:42,439
Just don't don't like scare him don't scare him running really slow. I think I know he's a spy

828
01:27:42,439 --> 01:27:44,439
I don't know where you are

829
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:50,319
I loved this so much. Oh, you're right behind just following around a spy. That was you

830
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:03,640
How much fun you could have in team four

831
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:09,279
I'm really sorry

832
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I'm playing shithead Natasha

833
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,680
Fortress 2 is every single drug ever made combined into an oral pill that you take

834
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:26,170
Oh boy, and it's and it's every single thing. It's every single drug ever made. Okay, don't do what I was gonna

835
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:29,550
Do to you you punk only 20 seconds. I'm good

836
01:28:30,029 --> 01:28:37,670
What what why you just kill random crits?

837
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:40,550
What I'm so confused right now from that

838
01:28:41,189 --> 01:28:49,760
Ten seconds, here we go. No, that's the death of accidental Jax. That's not a real Jax scout on the point scout on point

839
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:52,060
Scatter the black

840
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:55,520
Screw it. Oh

841
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,119
It's gonna get scooped up there

842
01:28:58,359 --> 01:29:03,460
This is this is gonna be a ramp for sure. I remember this everyone called me an idiot

843
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:16,039
Up here, okay, then it goes that way that's going fast

844
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:21,560
This game was a lot of fun though. I like this

845
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:29,880
Ah

846
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:35,930
Smarties are great. Yeah, they're very delicious if you eat them. I wouldn't put them anywhere else

847
01:29:36,449 --> 01:29:47,829
I've done this like some such a nervous habit. I remember reading the chat and people saying like can't even solve a simple puzzle like seriously

848
01:29:47,829 --> 01:29:49,550
Dude, I'm like actually worried about you

849
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:53,310
Like I'm worried about you do like no, we're not fucking around and I got like pissed

850
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:59,369
I think I get actually pissed here. Hopefully doesn't happen in the next minute too. Oh, it's exhausting pretending

851
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:06,189
Scoop it already. Come on, man

852
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:09,170
Again

853
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:21,359
Come on. Where'd he go? I think I'm in the clear though. Shit. I think I fucked it up again

854
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:28,960
I think it's like another two or three minutes after this at least because I was here for like 30 minutes. Hey

855
01:30:39,319 --> 01:30:41,319
Extend it

856
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:46,319
I'm just giving you a free space if I do that. All right fine

857
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:56,399
You get your reverse veto. This is number two, by the way. I'm her officially extended whole damn thing

858
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:03,359
That's your second veto and it's all it accounts for a reverse veto as well. So you only have three more of these left

859
01:31:17,619 --> 01:31:20,300
Now here we go, this is once I start getting quiet I

860
01:31:20,899 --> 01:31:22,739
Start talking like this

861
01:31:22,739 --> 01:31:24,739
What happened? What's going on? Like what the fuck?

862
01:31:24,899 --> 01:31:27,100
That's the focus whenever you hear me start to do that

863
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:32,399
That's when like, you know that I'm probably read off camera and I'm looking over here like right here and I see

864
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:37,409
Like holy shit. I did this in fucking 10 seconds actually is the one this dude's a fucking idiot

865
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:41,970
Like this dude sucks. Like how does he have this many viewers and shit? Like when I start to see that I'm just like

866
01:31:49,659 --> 01:31:57,880
You start to laugh it off a little bit and then once it once you realize that you don't know what you're actually doing and

867
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:59,319
everybody else does

868
01:31:59,319 --> 01:32:02,460
You start to like stamp your feet like a little baby

869
01:32:05,079 --> 01:32:39,800
Go I got this is the one got it. It's not the one

870
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,420
What an idiot holy shit. Oh my god seeing that again was fucking so bad

871
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:57,579
But like it's a big hole to fit it in. I've holy shit. I really thought that's what you did Wow

872
01:32:58,279 --> 01:33:00,279
But I come on anybody could have made that mistake

873
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:12,739
Okay, I thought the arrows we're talking about like I like you like tilt this tilt it

874
01:33:12,739 --> 01:33:18,750
Well, look, you got to tilt it around and get it in the middle those old stupid toys

875
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:22,250
I thought it was like till tell there to tilt it around just get a bit in the middle. I didn't

876
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:32,420
I think I fall off here too and it escalates. Alright, I'm gonna give you another extend. I'll give you one more for free

877
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:37,659
Oh, I'll give you another one for free

878
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:43,430
Shit, I I thought it was just like oh get it in the hole

879
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:49,270
Didn't he say get it in that hole too. Can you say something like that? Like, oh make sure you get it in the hole

880
01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:53,149
Can you say that?

881
01:33:53,149 --> 01:34:06,970
You fell off. Yeah, I think I think at this point when I mess this up again, what's that?

882
01:34:16,649 --> 01:34:24,199
Solved the puzzle it took a touch. No wait for 12 or 1 2 2 5

883
01:34:27,319 --> 01:34:31,199
Or 1 2 2 5 what's going on? Oh

884
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:38,880
That's right some we did an elaborate thing where I like made people go skip around the Vaude and shit, right?

885
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:48,340
I have completely forgot about that. We did the Vaude puzzle. Oh, yeah

886
01:34:48,979 --> 01:34:53,909
Why did I pull the controller out I

887
01:34:57,029 --> 01:35:01,989
Specifically remember everybody hating this bit. I thought it was genius and everybody's like this sucks

888
01:35:01,989 --> 01:35:05,909
Dude, who just play the game. I was putting like little clues and hints

889
01:35:07,149 --> 01:35:10,550
To like get go to a specific point in the Vaude, right?

890
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:15,050
It was four hours in like in like 12 seconds or something, right and like the whole idea

891
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:18,710
Yeah, like it

892
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:21,189
Was funny as a Vaude watcher. Yeah

893
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:28,250
Screaming on here

894
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:48,840
No, it's not. We're good. Congratulations. We're good. By the way, uh, I just did that into my chair

895
01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:04,279
I don't know why yeah, I got up. I put my face directly into the bottom of the chair

896
01:36:04,279 --> 01:36:09,239
I don't want to scream because that's way too loud. I'm like, I got a muffle in some

897
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:19,319
Yeah, it was it was gross. I realized it it was fucking vile. I think I'm in the clear

898
01:36:19,319 --> 01:36:21,319
We're not extending it again. We're good

899
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,880
You ate your own ass

900
01:36:25,739 --> 01:36:35,029
All right, where we going? No, we're not extending you got to see at least that part. Let's go. Where is it?

901
01:36:36,329 --> 01:36:38,890
Into the stars and torn into a thousand pieces

902
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:46,319
But if this spell was intended to destroy it does not you are caught three stars and held this is it

903
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:50,380
I love this game

904
01:36:50,539 --> 01:36:59,770
What an amazing game come on, by the way, if nobody if you have not played sorcery, it's on everything. It's on

905
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:03,229

No, no

911
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:29,140
No, at least probably like number four or three. You're just refluxed. I don't whatever. I'm drinking coffee

912
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:43,000
Whatever son of a gun. I have to go all the way back up there. I sound kind of pissed off though

913
01:37:43,159 --> 01:37:52,449
Where is this? This is I can't rewind rewind rewind. Okay. Rez is the only other spell that can counter death

914
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:55,859
Yeah, but there's nothing to Rez

915
01:37:56,380 --> 01:38:03,310
There are four sorcery games. I know that was what I needed to do. They're so good too. I want to scroll up

916
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:07,369
I think the fourth one's probably the worst. No rewinds. Didn't it say like oh you're held in the stars

917
01:38:07,369 --> 01:38:11,050
It was correct. The fourth one has a bunch of weird shit that you have to do, right?

918
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:14,050
But like the sorcery one two and seven a lot of three are

919
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:19,430
Phenomenal spellify. It's just telling me that okay, so it was it's doc

Screw up anybody's order tonight because if you do you're gonna get fired from this job that you need

944
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:22,920
So much

945
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:32,439
It's sitting right in front of you you don't know that much and you squeeze from your bottom to make sure it

946
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,880
Comes out to me

947
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:40,119
A fucking moment right there. All right, just want to be clear on this

948
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:47,520
Some confusion you did not want a complete head of lettuce between two pieces of bread. No

949
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,829
But what the fuck did you want?

950
01:40:51,109 --> 01:40:57,369
I understand you're upset. It's taking a while to get your food. Everybody chill out. It is listen for a second

951
01:40:58,909 --> 01:41:04,149
They're right back at you dickhead. But anyway, I am the only person working here

952
01:41:04,149 --> 01:41:09,550
I know singing my boss is a cheap son of a bitch. He's not gonna hire anybody else. I'm doing the books

953
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:15,310
I'm doing the cashier and I'm doing the cooking. How fucked up is this right?

954
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:20,710
Wow, that is pretty fucked up. That's terrible. I don't like what where'd all the other workers?

955
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:25,199
Seriously, all this game has taught me is

956
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:30,720
How much it sucks to work in the restaurant business like I don't ever want to do this

957
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:38,260
I never want a restaurant job in my life because how fucking awful this is and I give two thumbs up to

958
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:43,239
Anybody that is doing a restaurant job ten years ago, and if you'll excuse me for one second

959
01:41:44,510 --> 01:41:55,909
What is this yes, I would like two large cheese pizzas and I want them crispy on the bottom

960
01:41:55,909 --> 01:42:01,029
Not like last time when I didn't get him crispy. You understand? Oh, I see what I'm doing

961
01:42:01,029 --> 01:42:05,550
And I also want some free drinks too. Otherwise, I'm gonna complain to your boss

962
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:07,670
I

963
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:09,670
Say I get it. I see what I've done

964
01:42:09,989 --> 01:42:25,869
All right, we'll do singing was that video 2013 that was a rant too. Oh

965
01:42:28,409 --> 01:42:38,439
Shit that actually might be a rant could be nope

966
01:42:38,439 --> 01:42:45,439
It wasn't because that was not oh shit frog attack or hours of Dean dingus. I hold on me

967
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:47,439
I gotta get this some good fucking food

968
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:54,159

970
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:17,380
Where is it right there? Oh, it's literally right here. Hello. Is anyone home? Sounds like somebody's inside, but I shouldn't intrude on I'll come back another time

971
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:26,079
No, they're all they're doing something weird and gross on tik-tok. What you doing? No, stop it. What you doing my Wellington stop

972
01:43:26,359 --> 01:43:34,859
Don't do that. You're a detective. Yeah, and I'm I'm detectiving. Well, I people don't know what I'm doing there

973
01:43:36,479 --> 01:43:38,479
That's not me doing an impression of

974
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:45,100
That's not me doing an impression. That's like that's his that's what he does on tik-tok

975
01:43:45,579 --> 01:43:51,659
Tells people that's they make wellingtons and like send him like an M&M's Wellington and he goes that's what my Wellington

976
01:43:51,659 --> 01:43:55,390
What are you doing? Stop Wow singing? Oh shit. You're right

977
01:44:02,449 --> 01:44:04,449
I thought I was I don't know. I thought he's talking to me

978
01:44:05,449 --> 01:44:09,369
I honestly thought that somebody was saying that to me like you were so you were calling me an idiot

979
01:44:09,369 --> 01:44:12,770
I heard you or something. That's weird. He's stupid. Look, he's stupid

980
01:44:13,329 --> 01:44:19,520
Shut up. I'm mad at him. Like I'm fucking annoyed with him right now. Is that weird?

981
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:24,829
Weird thing to say I like I'm pissed off at what I just said. I'm annoyed by that. All right

982
01:44:24,829 --> 01:44:27,960
Um, right. We're gonna do what?

983
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:34,470
singing a

984
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:37,989
Rare doy doy doy is gonna have to show up here for you to get another one

985
01:44:37,989 --> 01:44:42,380
I don't think you're gonna get another bingo by the way, every bingo is another hundred communities

986
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:47,729
I want it's a lost pie. I need one more. There's a huge deer in the water

987
01:44:47,729 --> 01:44:53,210
Take rants off the deer in the water. Okay, that's that's fair because that was not me ranting

988
01:44:53,210 --> 01:44:59,020
That was the character grandpa ranting, right? I mean one more pie the rant was

989
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:04,000
I feel like it's just five rant, but that was not necessarily me ranting

990
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:14,439
The rant has to come from turning the rant was a bit. Okay. All right. Well, let's get this off

991
01:45:17,859 --> 01:45:26,560
Okay frog detective this is really fun as it was frog stick three out what I know that we're doing another one more thing

992
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Not yet. All right. What do you want? I hear your pies. We're gonna bring the voice actor back

993
01:45:37,789 --> 01:45:39,590
and

994
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:43,449
It's very simple. There's a there's like two buttons to this game

995
01:45:43,449 --> 01:45:49,510
There's a punch and there's a kick and apparently there's a jump. Yeah, there is that's that's that fighter beautiful looking by the way

996
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:59,359
May you fat fuck. No, but your health is in the top left. I gotta beat this guy. I got five

997
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:05,640
He's got five. It's over. I lost is that nine by the minute video

998
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:11,789
Another really nice thing that you're probably going to realize is you know, each one of these guys

999
01:46:12,189 --> 01:46:17,750
Vito has the same stupid sound when you pick anyone I just picked this guy ready listen to this

1000
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:24,119
Yeah, look at how much the crowd just looks like utter shit, by the way

1001
01:46:24,119 --> 01:46:33,579
I don't remember any crowd being like sepia tone in my life. I hold on. I might be able to pull this out

1002
01:46:33,579 --> 01:46:37,500
I'm able to pull this through. I feel like we've already seen the whole video a little spin kick

1003
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:42,640
I think we've seen the whole video already. This is like the tutorial. Oh

1004
01:46:45,069 --> 01:46:48,869
Jim it Jim it I got it. All right

1005
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:54,470
That's the first time I've like ever you know that guy. So that's a good thing graduate. Why am I on a forklift?

1006
01:46:54,670 --> 01:46:57,739
How do you say it right match to it? You guys ready?

1007
01:46:58,180 --> 01:47:01,340
So match to sepia, right? Look at my health

1008
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:09,909
Why did I stop with that though health sepia? That's correct. We time. Oh, that's sepia

1009
01:47:15,239 --> 01:47:17,399
I'm just surprised. This is a nine-minute video

1010
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:23,869
Okay, I have 65 health. I'm gonna start the next fight

1011
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:30,869
With six to light I'll veto this but I want to cuz that's that's fucking bullshit. Oh god. That is absolute

1012
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:37,590
Complete utter crap. Look at this guy has 260 health. This game is not possible to complete

1013
01:47:37,710 --> 01:47:42,319
You can't complete this that actually is bullshit though. How would you ever be able to do this?

1014
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:47,220
It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't I doesn't make any sense

1015
01:47:47,819 --> 01:47:54,619
Why that would ever be a thing every fighting game I've ever played in my whole life. This is Street Fighter one

1016
01:47:54,819 --> 01:48:02,220
This is a clay fighter. That's like a staple of all fighters. What? Why would you ever remove that?

1017
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:04,220
Why would you ever not do that?

1018
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:10,739
Everybody starts with the same health when there's a new round. Why would you remove that from this game? That's what I don't get

1019
01:48:10,739 --> 01:48:14,800
I don't understand that. Okay, you got it

1020
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:18,000
so

1021
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:25,930
Fucking stupid. I just want a guy. I want to get past the first you're a fighting game expert

1022
01:48:26,329 --> 01:48:30,800
But that's true though as you yeah, you started around people who made this game

1023
01:48:31,159 --> 01:48:36,600
All I remember is playing off the Super Nintendo and the arcade. This was in the arcades

1024
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:43,630
That's why wasted on this server. I'm more than 15 seconds

1025
01:48:44,109 --> 01:48:53,760
See if I can do it. Is that you you the pyro? Nope. You have to nope another rare TF2 video

1026
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:59,279
Oh, you're you're pathetic little grenades. Just bounce off my manly chest

1027
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:07,920
Come on shoot me again didn't work. It didn't even work. Oh, I didn't know what protects me against that

1028
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:12,819
I am completely protected. Yeah, that's stir. Okay. Let's see how long you stay alive at the mid fight

1029
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:15,920
Okay, why was I so jaded? If I die at this mid fight?

1030
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,880
I have to like drink the rest of my iced coffee as fast as I can

1031
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:22,640
I feel like I've been jaded since I was like fucking do you know why did you say that?

1032
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:25,199
Yeah, I don't think that's ever changed. It was not a good

1033
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:29,720
Ten years ago, that'll hurt your head gambling on the corner either

1034
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:35,329
No, I'm going I'm going up balls to the wall. This doesn't happen. I cannot die here

1035
01:49:35,329 --> 01:49:39,369
Oh, here's the fine. I'm like baby smoke it ever. That was a terrible jump. I

1036
01:49:40,029 --> 01:49:44,329
Try I still try to see the good and things I do but I'm yeah, you know, okay

1037
01:49:44,869 --> 01:49:51,100
No, get this pyro out of here. Yeah, I lived I don't have to drink my ice coffee as fast as I can

1038
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:57,430
I'm gonna come kill you like right disciplined emotional. That's right. Absolutely. That is absolutely correct

1039
01:49:57,430 --> 01:49:59,750
I thought you didn't have that much health

1040
01:50:00,750 --> 01:50:02,329
It's okay

1041
01:50:02,329 --> 01:50:05,409
It's okay. I've died from like 30 Scouts

1042
01:50:05,409 --> 01:50:10,500
I was sitting if my warning for I have like jello vision right now

1043
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:15,260
Oh, okay that that is like kind of horrible to do something to me. No, I didn't do anything

1044
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:18,060
Drugs what's going on?

1045
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:27,489
This is bad, you know, this is real bad. It's serious. Um, yes. All right. Hey, oh

1046
01:50:28,739 --> 01:50:32,739
Tell me when you respawn. What's my name guys? Can I have a comeback Tycho RC?

1047
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:40,479
Are you about to give me like a hundred percent?

1048
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:46,720
You got really weak eyes. Are you respawn? I am spawned. I am spawned actually I kind of do look

1049
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:53,609
What is this thing? Oh, no, do it again. I walked into like a friggin resupply what is going on?

1050
01:50:54,529 --> 01:50:58,609
What does this thing mean? What are we talking about? Oh, that title makes sense

1051
01:50:58,609 --> 01:51:03,409
Just cuz I was like what the fuck is going on. Oh dear lord. Oh boy. Oh

1052
01:51:04,539 --> 01:51:08,060
No

1053
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:12,609
Still didn't even kill him. People are gonna think I'm a legitimate hacker

1054
01:51:14,210 --> 01:51:21,960
Like I killed that was unbelievably bad some pyro blew the rocket back. I

1055
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:28,479
Went spy cuz I was gonna try and kill you while you were like that, but dude, I died

1056
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:34,390
Time within ten seconds. I'm a having that thing. All right, let's go ten seconds

1057
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:38,479
I don't know. I don't know if I can trust you. Let me have it. I know I could trust you. Hmm

1058
01:51:38,479 --> 01:51:41,899
All right this time I promise I'll make use of it

1059
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:54,090
Oracle Mordhau I thought it ticked damage on you cuz I don't play battle royale. I played a battle royale like twice. Oh

1060
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:59,170
I can't believe he's not one of these streamers. It plays battle royale every day

1061
01:51:59,869 --> 01:52:05,569
What I can't believe you didn't know that that was the circle

1062
01:52:05,569 --> 01:52:11,970
I mean this guy streams battle royales 5,000 hours. I can't believe you didn't know what I didn't know

1063
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:24,369
I think it was just gray. I thought it was like gonna battlefield me and turn me around

1064
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:27,649
You know what it goes like

1065
01:52:27,649 --> 01:52:36,229
Please get back to the playing field in five seconds. There was a battle royale. I forgot there was a bit of excuses

1066
01:52:36,350 --> 01:52:38,109
That's not an excuse

1067
01:52:38,109 --> 01:52:43,680
Hey, it's Alex. I did really well. I

1068
01:52:44,279 --> 01:52:50,380
Was killing people I just walked out of the circle here. I don't think he's even in the call

1069
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:53,340
He needs to know how many times have I called him?

1070
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:58,140
You know what? I'm getting getting realization here like I'm gonna call I'm gonna call him

1071
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:04,159
How many times have I called it's Alex like I'm right now like with a complaint about something

1072
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:10,399
Yo, he has me muted the battle royale circle thing instantly killed me. I was doing well

Taleks is just the friend that like if I have something I got a fucking event about I stepped out of the circle for a second

1075
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:23,500
The phones like I'm about to have the word dump soup on you

1076
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:29,949
Please battle royales. Hold on. So you'd like

1077
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:35,069
You strolled casually into the fog and maybe it's because I'm afraid to do that to anybody else

1078
01:53:37,149 --> 01:53:41,350
There are tons of people that I talked to on like a weekly basis right like a whatever do that

1089
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:42,220
Not ignoring more help what what he has no friends

1090
01:54:47,279 --> 01:54:54,399
By based on his true story written by to be true 2033 this is back to back. All right

1091
01:54:54,399 --> 01:54:58,439
Oh, do you guys remember this? Oh my god. I forgot about this stream. Oh boy

1092
01:54:58,439 --> 01:55:05,569
Um, I couldn't get past the tutorial in this game and I was fucking freaking out and livid. Are you okay?

1093
01:55:05,569 --> 01:55:10,180
No, not right now. I'm fucking angry right now. Yeah, this is bad

1094
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:15,659
This actually is running against bad internet and I'm fighting against like my streaming software being a piece of shit. Ah

1095
01:55:17,859 --> 01:55:19,739
new game wait, no

1096
01:55:19,739 --> 01:55:21,739
You guys can see this right? Am I?

1097
01:55:22,859 --> 01:55:27,859
You guys can see this right? You're not jaded. I want to make sure that that's possible positive guy

1098
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:37,409
You can see this. Okay, good. I couldn't get past the tutorial and it was pissing me off

1099
01:55:37,409 --> 01:55:42,210
I was playing on like the hardest difficulty because you got to play on the fucking hardest difficulty because you're on stream

1100
01:55:42,210 --> 01:55:42,729
You're a streamer

1101
01:55:42,729 --> 01:55:47,649
If you don't play on hard and everybody gonna laugh at you and like well snot rockets at you like on their screen

1102
01:55:47,649 --> 01:55:50,250
They're not like streaming software. I'm gonna make my own fucking internet

1103
01:55:50,609 --> 01:55:53,930
I'm gonna make my own streaming software my own internet in my own house

1104
01:55:53,930 --> 01:55:56,569
I'm gonna build my own house with my bare hands. Holy shit

1105
01:55:57,170 --> 01:56:04,020
Fuck this. I ain't like having somebody else have to like run my life. You know what I mean?

1106
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:08,659
I'm gonna build my own house. I'm gonna put I'm gonna make my own bank. I'm gonna make my own bread

1107
01:56:08,979 --> 01:56:10,979
I'm gonna make my own milk

1108
01:56:10,979 --> 01:56:15,439
What the fuck am I talking? Can we talk about that for a second by the way?

1109
01:56:16,529 --> 01:56:18,529
So if you don't know I was in a snowstorm

1110
01:56:18,770 --> 01:56:21,010
I'm pretty bad one and

1111
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:24,989
I don't know what it is with with people for some reason

1112
01:56:25,489 --> 01:56:27,859
What why do people buy?

1113
01:56:27,899 --> 01:56:29,500
bread and milk

1114
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:34,479
What's the bread and milk story there? I still explain it to me you go to a grocery

1115
01:56:34,479 --> 01:56:39,560
Don't matter what grocery store you go to go to any grocery store before like a snowstorm or before like a hurricane or something

1116
01:56:40,399 --> 01:56:42,399
Especially like a snowstorm. I don't understand

1117
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:44,800
You're gonna eat a bunch of bread for like a day. I

1118
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:46,119
I

1119
01:56:46,119 --> 01:56:49,399
Wouldn't eat bread. I won't be able to eat a loaf of bread in two days

1120
01:56:50,119 --> 01:56:57,189
Three days four days. Why do people were you just chugging milk in your basement? Why do people buy bread and milk?

1121
01:56:57,189 --> 01:56:59,189
Why don't you buy like food?

1122
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:04,439
What's going on there to eat where you can eat a bunch of bread? I?

1123
01:57:06,189 --> 01:57:11,800
Wouldn't you bet like get like a fucking a dozen chef Boyardee cans I get like a juggling bread and milk

1124
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:22,039
It's nothing. It's nothing else you go to any other aisle in the grocery store, and it's full

1125
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:30,289
But people are gonna just slam eat like loaves of bread and chug milk. I still didn't get it

1126
01:57:30,289 --> 01:57:33,369
I just don't get it like what the hell are you talking? What the hell are you doing?

1127
01:57:35,239 --> 01:57:39,909
Who the fuck drinks milk on like a regular basis anyways?

1128
01:57:40,289 --> 01:57:47,399
I'm glad we're getting away from this one my mask the thing Oh God

1129
01:57:47,399 --> 01:57:53,619
I could just shit my pants now. I can just buy new pants and then buy a new chair and then buy a new floor

1130
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:59,750
What fuck?

1131
01:57:59,789 --> 01:58:05,710
That does that was next level seriously, that's just been three in a row of me just fucking furious

1132
01:58:06,229 --> 01:58:09,869
Phylacter is still coming in with another another ten thousand bits

1133
01:58:10,430 --> 01:58:20,619
The almighty dollar I gotta like it Lee. I gotta like illegal. I gotta get like I gotta move my hair. I go

1134
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:30,760
He's deranged. Thank you. What am I about to do?

1135
01:58:31,359 --> 01:58:44,079
Holy fuck. Oh, this is nine and a half hour stream Jesus new top. Yeah, I can't even look over there. That's

1136
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:49,510
This is what yeah, all right. I'm gonna be I'm vetoing this one

1137
01:58:50,630 --> 01:58:53,510
Free samples from Trader Joe's that's right

1138
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:55,829
We're gonna go in there and go we're gonna go around the mall and

1139
01:58:56,189 --> 01:58:59,310
Get like the free samples from all the food court places

1140
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:02,229
I want to veto this cuz I don't I'm gonna talk about like a people are subbing all again

1141
01:59:02,229 --> 01:59:07,449
I don't want anyone to sub. I don't sub right now. Even if it's for a job. I'm speechless

1142
01:59:07,449 --> 01:59:17,170
I have no idea what to say. Thanks for the fucking crazy amount of money. You guys are awesome

1143
01:59:17,170 --> 01:59:21,069
Yeah, this goes on for like ten minutes. I remember I'm doing it. Let's try to beat this video game

1144
01:59:21,369 --> 01:59:27,750
Vito, I mean, this is one of my favorite streams ever link the German mustard website. It's it's gonna be crashed

1145
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:32,350
All right, where do I need to go? I gotta go plant the c4 on the hangers, which is upstairs, right?

1146
01:59:32,869 --> 01:59:40,829
Ban people that sub right? Which way do I go from here?

1147
01:59:41,229 --> 01:59:51,539
No, I think we're I think we're over it. I think it just happened like five minutes ago. And this is the post reaction, right?

1148
02:00:00,390 --> 02:00:05,350
I remember having one health at some point this whole game was my friend was a mess

1149
02:00:05,829 --> 02:00:13,739
Is he dead? I think I need him. Don't I my I had like a clenched in the door teeth

1150
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:21,390
Clenched ass this entire time. I played this game this gap

1151
02:00:24,319 --> 02:00:28,359
Guys like dead you actually just did that. I need this guy so I'm gonna heal him

1152
02:00:28,359 --> 02:00:36,670
But what you hiding behind the door? All right, ten seconds. Let's go. Okay, let's keep going

1153
02:00:37,189 --> 02:00:48,229
Anything else in here that I can grab? I got a shave man. Look young little rift area thing

1154
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:54,149
My impressions but this thing right here has to be protected and these doors over here

1155
02:00:54,149 --> 02:00:55,670
If you look in the top right of the screen

1156
02:00:55,670 --> 02:01:01,189
This door is gonna open and this door down here is gonna open as well. What's gonna happen is orcs

1157
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:07,350
Hundreds and hundreds of orcs are going to pour out of those places and you have to defend them

1158
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:12,829
You have to kill them all or else they're going to take that over back when so how do you do this?

1159
02:01:12,949 --> 02:01:13,949
Also

1160
02:01:13,949 --> 02:01:18,909
With your crossjournal, you can shoot it like this. It has a couple of little features, too

1161
02:01:18,909 --> 02:01:21,090
You can do like I don't know why we all thought that place

1162
02:01:21,310 --> 02:01:26,949
But the cool part about this game and why it's sort of like tower defense is because you have all these things you can put

1163
02:01:26,949 --> 02:01:33,359
Down so I have started to upgrade or I've already upgraded this poison spike trap and I use the

1164
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,199
Super boom barrel, but I'm not gonna use that right now because I don't you don't

1165
02:01:38,199 --> 02:01:40,199
I don't

1166
02:01:40,199 --> 02:01:44,479
Really really interesting in this game and look at how many spells you're gonna actually end up getting two more

1167
02:01:44,479 --> 02:01:57,319
It's a whole lot of fun. And yes, you'll see what I'm gonna do here is beat up. I remember this game

1168
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:19,689
America's funny some videos. Oh, yeah, I played this for three hours. Can you hear the fucking jewelry is tapping?

1169
02:02:20,369 --> 02:02:22,210
God's right. How do I dodge?

1170
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:29,869
You just saw this one, right? This game is really fun. I

1171
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:34,590
I want more games like this that are just fun. Don't funny. I don't care if they're like

1172
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:38,369
60 plus hour experiences hundred-hour experiences

1173
02:02:38,369 --> 02:02:45,270
I would gladly pay 40 to 60 dollars for a game that even if I get three to six whatever four to six hours of

1174
02:02:46,909 --> 02:02:50,119
Enjoyment from it. I just want a game. That's fun

1175
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,489
and then I don't have to have like a

1176
02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:59,170
Legend on a mini-map fuck with like 15 different keys on the legend

1177
02:02:59,170 --> 02:03:03,210
You know what I mean? Like oh, there's like that turn in there's like the side quest. There's the collection

1178
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:06,170
There's the other collection. There is the side mission for the collection

1179
02:03:07,890 --> 02:03:17,210
Care I just give me a nice it's gonna be a fun game. I'll pay the money. That's a number 98 opinion

1180
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:20,289
No, I can't go forward. I can't go left or right

1181
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:31,279
Talk shit talk shit talk shit talk. Why are you chanting that?

1182
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:43,130
Chanting in the back just like come on talk. What shit talk shit talk. All right

1183
02:03:45,289 --> 02:03:47,850
All right, okay. Yeah, I hear you. Okay

1184
02:03:48,369 --> 02:03:50,079
I think

1185
02:03:50,079 --> 02:03:54,770
That I think that if you throw it make a game. That's even

1186
02:03:55,210 --> 02:03:59,270
Two to three hours long but has some replayability and some and share ability

1187
02:03:59,729 --> 02:04:02,090
Think about that. You want to share this kind of shit?

1188
02:04:02,090 --> 02:04:04,970
Like let's say it's only like a four or five hour game

1189
02:04:05,529 --> 02:04:10,329
Your ability to want other people to enjoy it is another reason to why to pay the money. I

1190
02:04:13,699 --> 02:04:18,539
Cannot tell you the last time and I fucking mean this the last time

1191
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:21,020
I paid for a triple-a game

1192
02:04:21,939 --> 02:04:22,939
I

1193
02:04:22,939 --> 02:04:26,819
Wanted somebody else to play it too. I like wanted to share it with somebody. Nope

1194
02:04:26,819 --> 02:04:29,420
Give me a deal has not happened in a very very long time

1195
02:04:30,579 --> 02:04:35,659
You play some of these triple-a games that are like 60 bucks and you just want to forget they existed

1196
02:04:35,659 --> 02:04:38,100
You mean you enjoy them for like a couple hours and you forget they exist

1197
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,579
I want to be able to tell everybody about this shit

1198
02:04:41,579 --> 02:04:46,500
Like remember Stardew Valley you remember like telling everybody how fun Stardew Valley was and you've got a fucking play

1199
02:04:46,539 --> 02:04:49,260
You've got to play it that doesn't happen

1200
02:04:53,619 --> 02:04:59,060
$60 is worth it to me if I can share it with people. We actually class shorts there. That's a reddit take

1201
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:06,250
Just maybe stub my toe. I just stub my toe right here and that's your fault

1202
02:05:06,250 --> 02:05:13,949
And I want you banned for at least 10 seconds. I can probably try to what is this game?

1203
02:05:14,430 --> 02:05:23,750
Clone drone in the dangers. Oh, I'm over this. This is actually kind of fun. I think I was playing with people in the chat

1204
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:24,829
Wasn't I?

1205
02:05:24,829 --> 02:05:33,659
It's like a lightsaber robot game watch out for the train

1206
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:46,310
Wanting to connect with other people is the least reddit take Oh

1207
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:52,699
Spikes. Oh, he died. I just got dunked on. Holy shit. That was bad

1208
02:05:53,899 --> 02:05:58,649
All right. Now, I know what I'm doing. I get that was I got slammed dunked on I'm going with a hammer here

1209
02:06:01,119 --> 02:06:07,079
Probably should have an armor, but I got I got another chance here. Where is he up there games for me?

1210
02:06:07,079 --> 02:06:12,159
Are all about being able to like wanted a chase game to play them to show them to people

1211
02:06:12,479 --> 02:06:15,500
That was one of the reasons for like the original YouTube channel

1212
02:06:15,979 --> 02:06:20,500
We actually are doing the chase game. I wanted to show people something because I thought it was really cool fun

1213
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:22,500
Like I really liked it

1214
02:06:25,539 --> 02:06:31,880
If I can't be confident to tell you how much I want to like share an experience with you or like tell you that

1215
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:33,479
You should try something

1216
02:06:33,479 --> 02:06:35,890
All right. Here we go

1217
02:06:35,890 --> 02:06:41,489
No jammer and armor see if we can't seal the deal here

1218
02:06:41,489 --> 02:06:44,210
Oh, he might see what you want to show people how to backstab as a spy

1219
02:06:44,210 --> 02:06:47,210
Well, cuz spy was the little my favorite thing in the world. That was like my favorite thing ever

1220
02:06:47,689 --> 02:06:51,260
You're on his reddit take. Holy shit. That was sick

1221
02:06:54,100 --> 02:06:56,100
This game looks good

1222
02:06:57,659 --> 02:06:59,659
This game actually looks pretty fun

1223
02:06:59,739 --> 02:07:06,100
Smog yeah gets smogged. Good game, dude. Seriously. That was a ton of fun

1224
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:10,539
Let's be the last one that we're gonna take a piss break and come back and we'll do challenge mode

1225
02:07:10,939 --> 02:07:19,590
Spinning wheel of death say it like you haven't played it before you're forced to fight on the one level

1226
02:07:20,789 --> 02:07:26,590
I don't know. I forget everything. Yes. I don't remember anything that I ever do ever

1227
02:07:27,050 --> 02:07:32,609
That's why these streams are so weird to me. We just did it for like 45 minutes and it was it was just fucking mess

1228
02:07:32,609 --> 02:07:34,609
I don't remember saying any of these words

1229
02:07:34,609 --> 02:07:39,979
What's this game called? This game is?

1230
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:43,539
Clone drone in the danger zone. I gotta go in aggressive

1231
02:07:43,539 --> 02:07:49,020
I think we're gonna get into the BRB though after this next one unless I beat away with the game here

1232
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:57,170
For this experiment to work. We've got to win three times did once not more a lot of TF2 and do it again. Oh

1233
02:07:58,979 --> 02:08:00,979
Wow, I can't do that shit anymore

1234
02:08:01,659 --> 02:08:05,500
Got ya, is it gonna be a second win? It's gonna be a second win. I

1235
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:10,100
This is win number two and I don't even need to make an edit. I don't think

1236
02:08:10,739 --> 02:08:11,779
because

1237
02:08:11,779 --> 02:08:16,800
That was like two seconds. So we can just keep talking about like I don't know the weather

1238
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:23,989
Jack's now it's got a dead sunny outright overcast right now. It ain't bad edit Andy. It ain't very good last from the past

1239
02:08:23,989 --> 02:08:29,350
What is this about? Well, I know how to I know how to play territory control. Don't worry. I've played it before about hydro

1240
02:08:29,989 --> 02:08:32,989
Let's do it again. Oh, it is hydro like two minutes

1241
02:08:32,989 --> 02:08:39,350
Let's get at the third victory on hydro and then I can go eat like a banana, right?

1242
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:43,750
I think I had to do this on my server because nobody played this so like why not right?

1243
02:08:43,750 --> 02:08:48,670
Why wouldn't you eat a bunch of bananas if you bought why there's this many people in this one tunnel? That's right

1244
02:08:49,229 --> 02:08:53,229
This is like we're gonna win. Did we get a bingo? You got one

1245
02:08:53,670 --> 02:08:59,829
I'll show you the updated card. I didn't do it. I didn't do anything. I didn't do it looking for a rumor still looking for

1246
02:09:01,109 --> 02:09:02,590
ejects moment

1247
02:09:02,590 --> 02:09:04,590
naked

1248
02:09:07,649 --> 02:09:11,489
Played hydro. I mean some people do it again

1249
02:09:12,850 --> 02:09:17,449
Third time's a charm. Let's go. You've only been naked three times. I've been no no edits

1250
02:09:17,449 --> 02:09:21,130
We're not doing any editing right now. I want to I want to see for myself. I've been naked

1251
02:09:21,890 --> 02:09:23,890
four or five hundred times on screen

1252
02:09:26,039 --> 02:09:30,699
I've been naked probably okay, how many how many streams have I ever done a thousand

1253
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:34,640
I've streamed about a thousand times

1254
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,399
I've been naked seven or eight hundred of those times

1255
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:42,020
I'm just not on camera

1256
02:09:48,699 --> 02:09:56,340
Well, not naked like with no clothes on but like no shirt or like shirt and you know, I'm not

1257
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:04,539
Right now things are just happening. I'm gonna get myself in trouble. I need to shut up and we're gonna win quiet. Yeah

1258
02:10:05,939 --> 02:10:07,939
Stand up right now. You did it. No

1259
02:10:10,340 --> 02:10:13,909
All right, we got to the end of this video. I'm gonna pause it

1260
02:10:13,909 --> 02:10:15,109
I'm gonna take a VRB. I'm gonna go pee

1261
02:10:15,109 --> 02:10:19,069
Why you do it?

1262
02:10:19,069 --> 02:10:25,550
Why would I ever turn a webcam on if I didn't have pants or underwear on are you guys out of your mind?

1263
02:10:25,909 --> 02:10:31,470
The risk I told you about the dream that I had that time. That's a reality for me

1264
02:10:31,470 --> 02:10:34,329
I had a dream one time for those of you that are new

1265
02:10:34,810 --> 02:10:43,079
Where I was sitting here talking and I stood up for a second and I was naked and for a tiny little frame

1266
02:10:43,279 --> 02:10:47,369
Like okay, this is weird. This is maybe you click the mature body and sporting

1267
02:10:47,369 --> 02:10:52,819
I don't give a shit but like one little frame my like my dick was on camera and

1268
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:56,100
Like a 20-30 minute stop knows I'm talking

1269
02:10:56,100 --> 02:11:00,859
but like a tab for like not it was like a little like a tenth of a second frame and

1270
02:11:03,180 --> 02:11:08,579
Like I nobody said anything I looked over at the chat and it was like I've realized what had happened

1271
02:11:08,579 --> 02:11:11,060
I was like, holy shit. I think like I just my dick was just on camera

1272
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:12,140
I like balls were on camera

1273
02:11:12,140 --> 02:11:16,260
But nobody was saying anything and you know for a fact that if that happened in real life

1274
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:21,460
It would be dick dick dick. I could see his dick dick dick, you know, maybe that's what all it would be

1275
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:26,260
So I didn't see that so sitting there going. Holy shit. Did nobody see that?

1276
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:27,920
I like but I have to can't even address it

1277
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:29,600
I have to like delete the vaude

1278
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:33,340
But if I delete the vaude wouldn't that be like kind of suspicious I was like, how did nobody see that?

1279
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:36,430
I was like freaking out about it. I was like fuck man

1280
02:11:36,430 --> 02:11:42,380
I think people saw that and then I woke up so I've had that dream before was like, okay ready like I

1281
02:11:42,579 --> 02:11:46,500
Stood up first thing. I like stretched my back and we're talking like right

1282
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:53,779
It's like dick right here. I just just right and I was like, holy fuck

1283
02:11:53,779 --> 02:11:59,659
I think my camera was small enough where I don't think anybody caught it, right? All right, I'll be right back

1284
02:11:59,659 --> 02:15:26,699
I'm gonna pee. I'll see you in a minute. Okay, what's happening? Also, by the way, just to make sure everybody's aware

1285
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:35,000
As of probably next weekend nominations are gonna open up for

1286
02:15:35,439 --> 02:15:45,489
The best and worst award show start to get the categories ready. It'll be in the discord

1287
02:15:45,689 --> 02:15:53,119
The dollhouse is gonna auto win every category

1288
02:15:53,279 --> 02:15:54,680
well

1289
02:15:54,680 --> 02:16:00,539
I'm thinking of potentially just graying out the dollhouse

1290
02:16:00,619 --> 02:16:09,300
Because we'll end up with the Lord of the Rings the return of the king where it wins every category at the Oscars

1291
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:21,039
That's it. Have it be its own category. Yeah, that makes sense

1292
02:16:21,039 --> 02:16:24,460
Ah

1293
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:35,700
So instead we'll only have four streams to choose from what what do you mean four streams?

1294
02:16:35,959 --> 02:16:43,120
It should be a moment from that stream. Yeah that I'll get some good categories. They're only four

1295
02:16:49,610 --> 02:16:57,760
And

1296
02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:02,959
Stop the music. All right, that's very jarring for a lot of you. I apologize. We're coming back

1297
02:17:02,959 --> 02:17:07,760
We're going to do how long they're gonna we're gonna click it again because we need to kind of recalibrate here

1298
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:13,040
It is currently there are 40 more minutes remaining

1299
02:17:13,879 --> 02:17:17,319
I'll add another I'll add 10 more minutes. So there's 50 is an hour

1300
02:17:17,319 --> 02:17:21,239
Let's call it an hour because the BRBs for you to get any more bingos

1301
02:17:21,399 --> 02:17:28,840
What's the BRB music from that is from Bloor Dow an incredibly talented individual

1302
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:33,620
He's made all the music pretty much for this channel all the art. Literally the BRB screen

1303
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:36,350
You're looking at right now was made by Bloor Dow. Oh

1304
02:17:37,270 --> 02:17:42,809
By the way, let's talk about this for a second. Lord out is currently we talked

1305
02:17:43,690 --> 02:17:50,819
Day or so ago Lord. I was making four new BRB screens and they're gonna be seasonal which holy

1306
02:17:51,620 --> 02:18:01,239
Champ, right four new BRB screens and I just kind of told him more music. He's gonna make a bunch more tracks

1307
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:04,840
We're gonna get more blood out of music at least probably four or five more

1308
02:18:04,840 --> 02:18:15,270
I'm telling you let me be the first to tell you what when when Lord Oh eventually gets hired

1309
02:18:15,430 --> 02:18:19,139
We're doing like a fucking it's like a game soundtrack of the year

1310
02:18:19,139 --> 02:18:29,139
Like whatever whenever it is because it's gonna happen. Yeah, I just we knew first we knew here first, right?

1311
02:18:29,219 --> 02:18:37,299
We knew first it's gonna be so awesome to be like a Bloor Dow hipster when he wins fucking game

1312
02:18:37,459 --> 02:18:48,129
Soundtrack of the year in like five years. I liked him. I knew it and I liked his music before you did

1313
02:18:54,090 --> 02:19:03,600
I'm excited to see what um, what he makes you're gonna be a gatekeeping. I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna do that

1314
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:37,110
You can't the world is ending in 2022. That's I did why are you saying that? Why you say that?

1315
02:19:37,149 --> 02:19:47,069
I mean, he doesn't know you have a setting selected that makes YouTube videos come up much more often

1316
02:19:47,370 --> 02:19:53,280
It's part it's part of the site

1317
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:56,780
I wanted to make sure that YouTube videos had an equal chance to show up

1318
02:19:56,780 --> 02:20:03,299
It still is like I think like 25% chance though because last time last time we did this

1319
02:20:03,299 --> 02:20:07,540
I just was doing the random and it was like 2% chance to get a video

1320
02:20:07,540 --> 02:20:14,370
so now what it does is I believe is it picks the video file first and

1321
02:20:15,139 --> 02:20:18,319
Then picks a timestamp. That's kind of how I imagined it

1322
02:20:18,399 --> 02:20:27,260
So I think it what I think before just picked like a timestamp now it picks a video file then the timestamp

1323
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:38,510
So that that's not rigged. That's exactly how it probably should be. You're gonna stream Elden Ring now fuck that game

1324
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:54,270
All right. Um, let's go. Of course I am I think I can't fucking contain my excitement for that game

1325
02:20:54,270 --> 02:21:03,930
All right, let's put the timer back on. Here we go. Let's just remind everybody about the bingo card that currently stands

1326
02:21:03,930 --> 02:21:15,680
I don't think it's gonna happen again going over these

1327
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:30,360
No, you need a significant moment for some of these to happen. Who's your favorite Game of Thrones character Varys?

1328
02:21:30,360 --> 02:21:34,389
I don't know why I answered that that show is fucking completely who cares about that anymore

1329
02:21:34,610 --> 02:21:41,579
Intended like didn't like HBO come out with like the trailer for like new series

1330
02:21:41,579 --> 02:21:46,399
They were gonna do and it had like fucking four likes on Twitter. We got like retweeted like eight times

1331
02:21:46,399 --> 02:22:01,649
I didn't have something like that. I don't remember stop pretending pretending about my favorite character is do you only know something funny?

1332
02:22:01,770 --> 02:22:04,709
Okay, this is a confession

1333
02:22:04,709 --> 02:22:11,840

02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:41,440

1363
02:26:05,719 --> 02:26:11,219
Robo and incorporated the grip is just too tight. I keep telling them to loosen it, but they refuse to help me out

1364
02:26:11,219 --> 02:26:17,770
I think it's a conspiracy. Do you know robo hand industries are owned by the same company who specialize in PP reconstruction?

1365
02:26:19,110 --> 02:26:21,110
Fuck is happening

1366
02:26:23,030 --> 02:26:26,930

02:26:50,159 --> 02:26:52,719
PP reconstruction

1373

Oh, man, there's an opportunity for another 200 community subs. I

1374
02:27:00,959 --> 02:27:02,799
Think I think I know what happened tonight

1375
02:27:02,799 --> 02:27:08,760
So like the TV bit brought us up to an 11 and then I played this fucking boring game

1376
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:13,319
And it brought us down to like a 4 so I think I think I understand what happened here

1377
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:19,950
We started off at an 11 and we came down to like a three and a half. What like energy wise?

1378
02:27:20,389 --> 02:27:24,940
I'm a vamp here the title

1379
02:27:26,049 --> 02:27:31,250
Vampire I remember that was that was like a really hyped up game. Wasn't it from what I remember admits it was poor

1380
02:27:31,290 --> 02:27:36,930
I'm not I don't I don't think that forget what the story with that was at the opening credits

1381
02:27:37,290 --> 02:27:39,569
the huge fight scene happens and

1382
02:27:40,010 --> 02:27:46,290
You know Jackie Chan has taken on like 30 people. It's the new Jackie Chan movie credits open bang bang bang bang

1383
02:27:47,329 --> 02:27:49,370
Through the guy brings a ladder up

1384
02:27:49,370 --> 02:27:55,409
He dies through the ladder hits the guy in the face swings ladder around bang bang bang bang bang four guys around go flying through windows

1385
02:27:56,049 --> 02:28:00,829
Explosions everywhere and then the rest of the movie is Jackie Chan at a desk

1386
02:28:01,809 --> 02:28:09,059
Writing letters for an hour. That's the rest of the movie. That's what happened today. That's that's what this movie was

1387
02:28:09,739 --> 02:28:16,879
That's what happened. Nice elevator pitch for your show or movie

1388
02:28:16,879 --> 02:28:30,299
He was writing his Christmas cards for the rest of the movie for three hours. All right, we're looking for well

Jax it has to be a real Jax moment under these bullshit

1391
02:28:36,260 --> 02:28:44,059
The movie was too interesting in the first like 12 minutes and then I was writing Christmas cards for four hours

1392
02:28:44,059 --> 02:28:49,020
All right, 20 seconds. Let's go. What the fuck is he saying? Okay, let me translate

1393
02:28:49,659 --> 02:28:54,959
Thank you. Mars gaming. The game was exciting for the first 10 minutes and then it was terrible and boring for the next two hours

1394
02:28:55,979 --> 02:29:02,659
Lenny face what the fuck that's old. That's very old Lenny face

Oh god, and it's in the title. This is bad. Ouch

1398
02:29:25,159 --> 02:29:32,700
I had no idea how this game even worked and I thought it was terrible. I thought this game was awful. I

1399
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:39,079
Didn't even pay attention to any of that. I was too busy laughing at my like stupid jump. Yes, I'll do it. Sure

1400
02:29:44,350 --> 02:29:49,079
Yes, screw your family, I just shut this guy up

1401
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:53,120
Oh my god, oh

1402
02:29:53,799 --> 02:29:56,170
Oh, oh

02:29:56,409 --> 02:30:00,930
Wait, I didn't know you could do that. I didn't know you could do that. Oh, no

1404
02:30:01,569 --> 02:30:07,200

02:30:08,120 --> 02:30:15,940
Wield right weapon two-handed. Oh, I can use this as a two-hander. Oh great. Yeah, let me use it

1406
02:30:16,260 --> 02:30:22,860
Dude dark souls series where you have to unplug your head from the matrix to understand even why people play fighting in a stupid hallway

1407
02:30:22,860 --> 02:30:24,860
I can't even swing my sword

1408
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:29,860
Back in like 2012 2013

1409
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:37,600
This was not as popular as everybody it is now back in like 2010 2011

1410
02:30:38,639 --> 02:30:42,120
No, don't kill me. This was just like why the fuck do people like this?

1411
02:30:42,120 --> 02:30:49,860
I don't even know where's the bonfire. I didn't even get it. Like I was like, why do I die so easily like it?

1412
02:30:49,860 --> 02:30:52,979
What's the guy I have to start over again like this?

1413
02:30:54,979 --> 02:30:56,940
Stupid when I first played it fuck is going on

1414
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:59,180
I had to pull the cord out of the back of my head and go wait a minute

1415
02:30:59,180 --> 02:31:03,899
This is incredible if we're like I gotta I have to play this it took like a year after this video

1416
02:31:04,459 --> 02:31:13,719
Not gonna be an idiot. Oh, that's so much more damage. I had the exact same experience. Yeah, I want to know the actual statistic

1417
02:31:14,559 --> 02:31:17,920
Of people that played dark souls when it first came out or demon souls

1418
02:31:18,319 --> 02:31:23,659
Said I don't I don't get it and then came back two years later and played it again and was like holy shit

1419
02:31:23,659 --> 02:31:24,979
It's my favorite game ever made

1420
02:31:24,979 --> 02:31:28,860
It's probably a shitload of you

1421
02:31:29,020 --> 02:31:38,739
What does that even do? I can't even do it. Look at okay. You can't get me while I'm jumping

1424
02:31:50,290 --> 02:31:54,440
This is how you just know like what I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

1437
02:33:16,690 --> 02:33:26,420
Yeah, well, I got like a bunch of fucking chest and back problems. Hey, hey, hey German from like four years ago

1438
02:33:26,420 --> 02:33:38,299
Thanks for the fucking curse. Take it off. Take it off. I know there's a fucking goddamn goblin or like

1439
02:33:38,819 --> 02:33:42,659
Genie or something watching this right now, then put that curse on and you're sitting there going like

1440
02:33:43,459 --> 02:33:44,739
Yes

1441
02:33:44,739 --> 02:33:56,139
Take it off now. Take it off. We're so good. Goblins aren't real

1442
02:33:56,260 --> 02:34:11,059
Yes, they are. You best start believing in ghost stories because I'm a guy. I'm a goblin. That's whatever

1443
02:34:12,260 --> 02:34:22,420
That's so rude

1444
02:34:23,489 --> 02:34:25,010
So rude

1445
02:34:25,010 --> 02:34:32,159
I'm just it was a just a joke everybody relax. I'm kidding. Oh my god. I'm kidding

1446
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:40,430
Is Santa real yes, who else puts the presents under my tree? What was you gonna say? It's like my mom and dad

1447
02:34:41,729 --> 02:34:59,219
Let's go. I got a ninth. You know, let's just leave it on whatever. What's next overuse Santa joke

1448
02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:08,569
It's like getting to be holiday season. They're in style right now. Please don't tell me this is the corridor mission

1449
02:35:08,569 --> 02:35:14,239
No, not that one the one after that one because the corridor missions to Earth Defense Force five equipment

1450
02:35:14,239 --> 02:35:18,760
Do we eventually get I wonder if I call italics in this room and he's in it

1451
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:24,459
Um, I don't for fence Spencer, I don't know. Yeah, I don't remember them having support

1452
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:31,690
Let's try the bolt gun

1453
02:35:31,690 --> 02:35:34,370
Okay, are you hurting me? I am

1454
02:35:35,370 --> 02:35:40,450
Edf teaches you pretty early on to go back and farm now that repeated weapons get upgraded

1455
02:35:40,450 --> 02:35:44,690
So I guess if you find the same weapon again game was so much fun. That's cool. I

1456
02:35:46,100 --> 02:35:50,459
Remember we were gonna play this a shitload better than one and we just never did ever again

1457
02:35:50,940 --> 02:35:53,379
Who this this thing is actually really great

1458
02:35:54,100 --> 02:35:59,200
It's a great single target. They come up with another one, but it wasn't Edf

1459
02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:04,680
It was like Edf Dragon Lance was a good choice. Whoever suggested it. Thanks. I don't know what it wasn't a numbered one

1460
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:06,159
I'm gonna go that far though

1461
02:36:06,159 --> 02:36:09,850
What's the new one? It's so easy. If six is coming out

1462
02:36:10,530 --> 02:36:12,530
Well, I don't play it

1463
02:36:14,010 --> 02:36:20,059
Three new ones. Holy shit. I love these games. It's just shoot shit

1464
02:36:21,059 --> 02:36:26,299
Iron rain sucked that that's what I'm thinking of. I'm not seeing very many crates. It was maybe a different studio, right?

1465
02:36:26,299 --> 02:36:28,299
It's so slow. These are so heavy

1466
02:36:32,229 --> 02:36:34,229
Doing this because if I look tiny

1467
02:36:34,510 --> 02:36:38,430
I'm just look if I don't frame myself correctly. I look really small

1468
02:36:39,030 --> 02:36:43,510
If I frame myself like this, I'm fucking huge jacked like handsome and shit. You know, I mean

1469
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:47,280
Six would be good. All right

1470
02:36:48,329 --> 02:36:50,329
This definitely doesn't feel harder

1471
02:36:56,149 --> 02:36:57,790
Crap

1472
02:36:57,790 --> 02:37:03,959
This is just playing the game. What happened to you being jacked?

1473
02:37:05,799 --> 02:37:08,719
I mean I was in the gym. It only goes into four or five days a week

1474
02:37:09,399 --> 02:37:17,530
That's what happened. I stopped doing that. I got it does but I missed realness made it hard to really do stuff like that anymore

1475
02:37:19,940 --> 02:37:23,819
Now I just like eat food this thing I'd rather just use the other lighting gun

1476
02:37:26,790 --> 02:37:30,950
Wait, why are combat? I missed the 500 sub celebration video

1477
02:37:34,909 --> 02:37:36,909
30 more seconds

1478
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:50,920
Alright we go you've got about 30 minutes to fill the rest of those slots. It's so hard to aim

1479
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:55,959
Yeah, you don't see it anywhere to buy. Yeah for some reason thousand people here

1480
02:37:56,319 --> 02:38:01,899
We're on the PlayStation store, you have to go look no you have to like look for it was up like purposefully search it. Oh

1481
02:38:03,149 --> 02:38:07,270
God in 2018. Yeah, I explained what we're doing again. I think I've done it a few times

1482
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:21,819
Man that was crazy. I can't believe that just happened. I hope it doesn't happen again

1483
02:38:26,899 --> 02:38:31,340
Protect me my BS protect me

1484
02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:38,139
Weapons they don't even know where they're going

1485
02:38:40,719 --> 02:38:47,180
My god, they're awful. They're not even attacking anything just running

1486
02:38:48,079 --> 02:38:50,510
You guys suck

1487
02:38:56,799 --> 02:38:59,020
This is a classic a classic comedy

1488
02:39:08,120 --> 02:39:12,069
This goes out to the broken hearted

1489
02:39:12,870 --> 02:39:15,069
We already have singing on there. Don't worry

1490
02:39:15,670 --> 02:39:20,280
It's my life and it's now or never

1491
02:39:21,799 --> 02:39:24,319
I don't want to live forever

1492
02:39:25,399 --> 02:39:27,399
Not bad. I just

1493
02:39:27,799 --> 02:39:32,079
He hasn't talked this whole time

1494
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:38,850
I died with god Modan. I have no control over my character

1495
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:46,040
I'm just on fire. How are you on?

1496
02:39:49,459 --> 02:39:52,139
What wait, there's a dinosaur

1497
02:40:00,819 --> 02:40:04,579
Oh, yes, I got up there I forgot about this. Oh

1498
02:40:10,569 --> 02:40:19,530
Man back in the back of the day when I remember stir used to hit me up and say hey

1499
02:40:19,930 --> 02:40:25,750
I downloaded too many mods and my computer crashed. Would you like to play GTA? He's like, yeah, sure, of course

1500
02:40:26,829 --> 02:40:35,639
All these videos of all the weird mods and all like just the the asset replacements the character replacements

1501
02:40:36,629 --> 02:40:41,190
GTA 4 I think is my favorite GTA probably out of all of them

1502
02:40:41,190 --> 02:40:48,200
But I can't ever go back and play it ever again. It's it's I can't

1503
02:40:48,319 --> 02:40:54,930
I'm just imagining a car flying by and like an elephant in a giraffe falling out with parachutes on and like

1504
02:40:55,090 --> 02:40:59,690
500 explosions going on behind me and like I can't die and shit. Like I can't play it anymore

1505
02:40:59,690 --> 02:41:04,409
I have over modded to the point where I can't even enjoy it. Same thing with Skyrim

1506
02:41:04,409 --> 02:41:12,489
I play a character. I've never played before and like know how to play this fucking game like this character

1507
02:41:12,489 --> 02:41:23,409
You got another complaint stream. That's too much pressure. I hated this game, too

1508
02:41:23,409 --> 02:41:28,350
I've really hated this and I didn't want to say I hated it because I knew a lot of people liked it and I didn't

1509
02:41:28,350 --> 02:41:30,010
want to be like the

1510
02:41:30,010 --> 02:41:31,329
contradicting Andy

1511
02:41:31,329 --> 02:41:37,040
What and everybody would be like, oh you fucking just suck at it. Like I hated this

1512
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:42,040
Actually, this is great. Can I go back like years later so I can tell you what I was really thinking

1513
02:41:42,040 --> 02:41:44,979
I hated this game. Yes, you casual

1514
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:49,340
Bend that guy for life for real like give the gift that guy the first

1515
02:41:49,860 --> 02:41:57,659
Real full full band for that I've ever given man that guy fucking fine. I don't ever see that guy again. Damn. I

1516
02:42:01,979 --> 02:42:07,479
Hate this game. I really don't just turn the chat off. I don't want to know turn off the chat

1517
02:42:07,879 --> 02:42:14,479
Keep it on we were doing 2v2s. We were getting destroyed. No stir was like carrying hard and I was dying and getting mad

1518
02:42:14,479 --> 02:42:17,680
I don't do that. I'm kidding. I'm curious. How does it play out?

1519
02:42:28,559 --> 02:42:30,120
shield bad

1520
02:42:30,120 --> 02:42:43,450
Shield is broken shield guys broken

1521
02:42:44,569 --> 02:42:46,350
still

1522
02:42:46,350 --> 02:42:49,549
Holy should you hear that exhale? Oh

1523
02:42:50,430 --> 02:42:52,459
my god

1524
02:42:52,459 --> 02:42:59,950
Is this game still my service? Is this service still library? Is this like get we shopped?

1525
02:43:00,149 --> 02:43:07,479
You know what is this thing still live? I'm gonna beat this guy

1526
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:26,760
Fucking brought that guy's health to zero you can cancel out of literally anything with revenge mode

1527
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:29,440
So mid-grab you probably had one hell that that dude

1528
02:43:29,440 --> 02:43:35,159
I stabbed him three times with zero health and then he pressed triangle and got all his health back and can kill me round two

1529
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:37,680
What? Yeah, why is that?

1530
02:43:38,319 --> 02:43:42,760
Wow, what the fuck is the point of that no explain that to me playing obi soft I want an employee

1531
02:43:42,760 --> 02:43:47,600
Hey, would you like an explanation? They added that mechanic into the game to help you win?

1532
02:43:48,440 --> 02:43:50,440
against multiple enemies

1533
02:43:52,719 --> 02:43:54,920
Karen and yet he was able to build revenge

1534
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:57,000
I

1535
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,239
Am kind of a gamer Karen aren't I?

1536
02:44:01,639 --> 02:44:12,350
Seriously, I was I was somebody from management to tell me I want a written letter about it. Oh, we just did this

1537
02:44:14,239 --> 02:44:20,440
The next room contained an oh, yes under the dear hatchet family crest on the desk were many

1538
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:27,870
Recent veto. No, I'm not wasting my last veto on this. This is I loved this. This was a ton of fun old coins wine

1539
02:44:28,590 --> 02:44:30,959
cryptic runes

1540
02:44:31,159 --> 02:44:37,280
Decide for the runes, but it's our veto. Are you guys gonna use one here? Just as I picked up that'll leave you with two

1541
02:44:38,159 --> 02:44:43,500
The candle lit itself and a funky phantom friar floated into the room

1542
02:44:46,040 --> 02:44:48,040
No veto

1543
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:57,729
This guy looks friendly, okay burn his papers enjoy wine and candle light. Are you naked here?

1544
02:44:57,729 --> 02:45:02,049
I don't he's snapping fingers the candle in a glass of the house

1545
02:45:03,090 --> 02:45:06,409
Extend why this dream was a week ago the ghost what?

1546
02:45:07,209 --> 02:45:10,149
Why would I extend this frame? You can just go well, I didn't want to kill him

1547
02:45:10,149 --> 02:45:13,170
He just wanted to hang out six days ago. Oops. Well, uh

1548
02:45:14,850 --> 02:45:16,850
Sorry, I'm one I couldn't mute

1549
02:45:16,889 --> 02:45:20,530
What's the deal? No that you thought half of these monsters

1550
02:45:20,530 --> 02:45:24,790
I want a very non hostile walk of the Golden's place

1551
02:45:24,790 --> 02:45:35,920
We're staying to watch the stream that just happened you can do a Thanksgiving stream. No music room. I want to go to the music room

1552
02:45:36,340 --> 02:45:40,930
You do but your voice sounds different. What happened dude?

1553
02:45:40,930 --> 02:45:48,680
We sound completely different you like leave the cellar search the cell. Where's the music room sounds like older from now

1554
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:55,870
Hmm

1555
02:45:58,190 --> 02:46:08,120
Dude you sound wicked jaded music room sound jaded whistle sound hummer first floor say second floor second floor

1556
02:46:09,430 --> 02:46:11,510
I'm gonna use my last veto you guys won't

1557
02:46:12,149 --> 02:46:15,700
The second floor looked dark and uninviting

1558
02:46:16,620 --> 02:46:26,270
It's only another 50 seconds. It could room at random find the kitchen waste your veto. No

1559
02:46:26,969 --> 02:46:35,850
Good eats the room. I next entered was obviously a library of some running out of time

1560
02:46:35,989 --> 02:46:38,309
Well, yeah, you got a great job. We had about 20 minutes. Oh

1561
02:46:38,950 --> 02:46:41,069
There is there was a door to my left

1562
02:46:41,069 --> 02:46:46,389
See the reason why you should be using your vetoes as a collective chat room if you have you'll have three you still have my right

1563
02:46:46,829 --> 02:46:49,549
Looking for bingo here and I'm telling you right now

1564
02:46:49,549 --> 02:46:54,690
you're not gonna get it here and you have about 25 minutes, so you need to really kind of get your act together and

1565
02:46:55,569 --> 02:47:02,290
Skip some of these streams that are three minutes of just waste time. Let's go right. Let's see. I'm just telling you

1566
02:47:02,290 --> 02:47:07,309
I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something odd about the woman in the kitchen. Here we go

1567
02:47:07,729 --> 02:47:09,649
You're hungry

1568
02:47:09,649 --> 02:47:12,530
That's why you haven't seen me lately

1569
02:47:12,610 --> 02:47:19,309
but I'm coming right back at you with this daisy game play and I've been playing this game for the last three weeks or so and

1570
02:47:19,790 --> 02:47:25,389
Something to remember something of note. I've died every single fucking time. I've ever played this game

1571
02:47:25,389 --> 02:47:29,430
I don't have any really suits or any sniper rifles or anything like that

1572
02:47:29,790 --> 02:47:34,229
But I live on the edge. I live dangerously as you see right here walking on the main road

1573
02:47:34,430 --> 02:47:36,430
This is new to me, I don't remember this

1574
02:47:55,950 --> 02:47:56,450
Vito

1575
02:48:03,709 --> 02:48:05,709
You have to vote for this

1576
02:48:05,950 --> 02:48:09,989
Eons of centuries of rust and this was owned by

1577
02:48:10,510 --> 02:48:12,510
Alright, alright, it's unanimous

1578
02:48:12,510 --> 02:48:18,159
Catherine of England. All right, you get you know, that's not all right. We're going you got it done. I

1579
02:48:18,799 --> 02:48:37,059
Am currently on my way. Hey Jeffrey Jeffrey. I need to talk to you. Where are you lad? I'm currently bleeding and

1580
02:48:38,139 --> 02:48:45,659
Profusely from the face and I need some bandages. I need some help here. I'm having fun playing

1581
02:48:45,659 --> 02:48:50,329
I haven't played in a long time. Is everybody even listening to me?

1582
02:48:51,329 --> 02:49:00,500
Hey, hey, look, that's true. Let's work together. Come here buddy. Come here. You didn't get scammed

1583
02:49:00,500 --> 02:49:04,090
Well, I'll add three minutes to the timer. You didn't get scammed

1584
02:49:04,090 --> 02:49:16,979
I promise you didn't get scammed to the Warcraft 3 custom map thing on battle.net

1585
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:24,440
The only thing you would see was Dota Dota 3.6 Dota 3.06 all-stars Dota Dota Dota Dota Dota

1586
02:49:24,440 --> 02:49:29,600
That's when everybody really started to get into it and I was delicious. Face it. I was really bad at it

1587
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:30,600
I tried it a few times

1588
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:34,200
I tried to play for a couple hours on the Dota games and I would just get

1589
02:49:34,729 --> 02:49:38,649
Rocked and it kind of turned me off for the rest of my life

1590
02:49:38,649 --> 02:49:42,049
I'm not wasting if you know was when I was probably 16 or 17 years old

1591
02:49:42,049 --> 02:49:45,049
I'm not wasting a long time ago, but it turned me off from MOBAs

1592
02:49:45,049 --> 02:49:50,450
I never really wanted to get started in them again League of Legends, huh? They're all they all kind of were the same

1593
02:49:50,450 --> 02:49:54,450
They're all that Warcraft 3 Dota that I was terrible at but now

1594
02:49:54,450 --> 02:49:56,450
What? It's you? What are you weirdoing?

1595
02:49:56,889 --> 02:50:00,090
Which I wasn't really that excited for I didn't really read up too much about it

1596
02:50:00,090 --> 02:50:04,129
I just knew it was a new mobile one more I think a mobile like you're out of vetoes man

1597
02:50:04,129 --> 02:50:09,530
I think you got one more on I think a Dota 2 and it just kind of was like I don't want to play all right

1598
02:50:09,530 --> 02:50:14,409
All right. All right. All right. Did I know that this game was WASD to move? All right. All right

1599
02:50:14,409 --> 02:50:21,680
All right person Jesus Christ. He's my using the default scatter gun the Criticola and the Sandman

1600
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:28,549
This is the first time I've ever equipped the Sandman in a commentary ever and not just a commentary

1601
02:50:28,549 --> 02:50:32,270
I haven't put this thing on probably since it came out back in like

1602
02:50:32,629 --> 02:50:37,030
2008 or 9 whenever they released this thing. I haven't used it once since then

1603
02:50:37,030 --> 02:50:43,399
This is also on CP gravel pit and it's on defense if you couldn't already tell now here

1604
02:50:43,399 --> 02:50:47,120
Let me tell you why I'm playing scout scout on gravel pit on defense

1605
02:50:47,120 --> 02:50:52,159
He's really really awesome because I don't see in the bottom of the screen. They have to cap

1606
02:50:52,159 --> 02:50:59,860
You know veto veto veto good place. I win. This is a good one. Oh fuck. We have to do it again wheel man

1607
02:51:03,190 --> 02:51:12,280
He'll die. Don't worry. God damn it. They're like little mice. You're trying to catch a mice with your bare hands

1608
02:51:12,959 --> 02:51:14,440
There you go. He's dead

1609
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:23,430
two minutes, oh shit losing down now like I

1610
02:51:23,950 --> 02:51:26,959
Can't believe we skipped

1611
02:51:27,959 --> 02:51:29,959
Shitty this looks

1612
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:34,579
My streams my god, this is like 2,000 bitrate. It's like 2000 like 15

1613
02:51:35,280 --> 02:51:43,510
This is back before like they I could do that raised the cap again left again

1614
02:51:43,750 --> 02:51:52,100
Think I'm running fucking circles, you know, I mean this is a rumor and doi doi doi. No, it's not

1615
02:51:52,899 --> 02:51:57,590
Rumor has to be somebody driving by it's like perfect dick idiots

1616
02:51:58,030 --> 02:52:02,569
The download counts towards the hour. No, it does not

1617
02:52:03,110 --> 02:52:06,319
You still don't scream in 10 ADP turn this spaghetti

1618
02:52:06,319 --> 02:52:12,280
That's because you need to leave you need a higher bitrate to go higher than 720 if you don't have a higher bitrate

1619
02:52:12,280 --> 02:52:15,600
Then it looks like shit, especially if you're at 60 FPS. I don't scream at 30

1620
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:19,600
Go, please

1621
02:52:20,319 --> 02:52:33,950
Cops are teleporting by the way wearing the fence. The fence is now part of the car. Nice networks

1622
02:52:36,969 --> 02:52:43,370
transcoding Andy Oh

1623
02:52:43,889 --> 02:52:49,290
How far away is why can't you raise your bitrate? I see this 1080 and 60. Come on

1624
02:52:49,290 --> 02:52:52,930
They probably have a screaming PC. They probably streaming at more than 6,000 do it

You got about 15 minutes at 5 15

1632
02:53:41,379 --> 02:53:44,870
You're looking for gambling you're looking for Drew crew you're looking for a wink

1633
02:53:45,610 --> 02:53:48,450
Looking for naked you're looking for a room or any room or driving by

1634
02:53:49,889 --> 02:53:52,090
You're looking for an extreme Jax moment

1635
02:53:52,569 --> 02:53:55,469
And even if you get Jax, you still need to get the naked moment, too

1636
02:53:55,989 --> 02:53:58,000
It's a different game

1637
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:05,670
We go to Tokyo chocolate here. Not yet 10 out of 10 game. By the way, I need to go to Kona

1638
02:54:05,950 --> 02:54:14,510

1639
02:54:14,510 --> 02:54:24,739
Are you kidding me? Oh, there is gambling in this but you are a grandma fine

1640
02:54:25,059 --> 02:54:28,569
But is it right here? It's too early

1641
02:54:29,370 --> 02:54:35,190
Yeah, I don't think Lee Wonka

1642
02:54:35,190 --> 02:54:36,610
It's a different a different island

1643
02:54:36,610 --> 02:54:41,329
Zachariah tangi is a friend of mine and I understand that things are going quite well with you in the shop in Morocco extend

1644
02:54:41,329 --> 02:54:44,250
I too am interested in forming a partnership be careful here

1645
02:54:44,250 --> 02:54:48,809
If you use your last life here, you have one more my signing over this you wonder if you have two more

1646
02:54:49,329 --> 02:54:54,020
Take a hundred and twenty cases of your tart of the moon to Zach. I don't really enjoy

1647
02:54:54,020 --> 02:54:57,299
I think the gambling happens one very very much ordering further in this pod

1648
02:54:57,860 --> 02:55:00,559
You have two more you can either extend or you can beat a app store

1649
02:55:00,860 --> 02:55:06,620
I'm staying here because I'm likes my own game. I don't have anybody else hates it, but he's keeping me in business

1650
02:55:07,260 --> 02:55:14,219
It's too late. Yeah, you could veto this in 20 cases. Well, I have to get that ready

1651
02:55:14,700 --> 02:55:21,930
It's far too early for gambling. Even if you extend it twice. God damn it. What do I need?

1652
02:55:22,329 --> 02:55:27,020
Tart of the moon is so such a pain in the ass. No, no, no, it's yeah

1653
02:55:27,020 --> 02:55:30,020
I'm just burning the clock right now against you guys. Okay, I need

1654
02:55:31,020 --> 02:55:33,500
125 lemons I hiked the ball and just went down

1655
02:55:36,799 --> 02:55:45,489
Lemons, okay. Let's go. We need to hold hold. Oh, it's so late to do a veto now

1656
02:55:45,489 --> 02:55:52,110
That would be a waste on the clock pick talk run the clock. I'll take lemons, please

1657
02:55:52,110 --> 02:55:58,930
I need a hundred and twenty five of them too late now. Oh, I love how this is just so slow

1658
02:55:58,930 --> 02:56:13,700
There's nothing happening. This is perfect for me. Perfect. What I just buy let's get a reminder here

1659
02:56:15,670 --> 02:56:21,629
Look like a lemon. No, look at me either. I do that every other stream. I'm surprised even seen it

1660
02:56:21,629 --> 02:56:27,190
It looks like a lemon. I just clicked it and said go whatever. It was a part where click master on every stream, too

1661
02:56:27,190 --> 02:56:29,190
I got eight hundred sixty thousand dollars. Who cares?

1662
02:56:29,670 --> 02:56:37,770
Let me extend at that. I'm making Tart of the moons. All right, I can do better than 21 though

1663
02:56:37,770 --> 02:56:39,770
I said not a crunch time. Let's go

1664
02:56:40,090 --> 02:56:53,479
Okay, come on. This is gambling. No, it's not

1665
02:56:54,000 --> 02:57:04,209
Well, we're gonna go for it cactus. Canyon doesn't like me

1666
02:57:07,930 --> 02:57:09,930
This is that oh, it's absolutely not gonna be

1667
02:57:10,649 --> 02:57:18,299
Nope, that ain't happening. I think our way back again. Oh, I've seen a lot of vetoes here. Yeah until 515 repeat

1668
02:57:18,739 --> 02:57:25,319
Can we do it? Although wait a minute. Hold on and here we go. I'm not gonna pay attention to me

1669
02:57:25,319 --> 02:57:29,819
Oh, I'm done. Okay. There's a lot of going on here. This is gonna be tough

1670
02:57:30,459 --> 02:57:36,739
By the way, if a veto does come through you get the full hundred eighty seconds again. Just make sure you understand that

1671
02:57:40,739 --> 02:57:42,100
Wait

1672
02:57:42,100 --> 02:57:49,049
Cactus candy was so good. Get him out of here. This seems pretty unanimous so far

1673
02:57:49,649 --> 02:57:54,600
You give me that over. All right, you give me that over and things are gonna change. Oh

1674
02:57:57,309 --> 02:58:03,620
Thanks for hanging out run up the stairs on all fours. I can do that. No, I'm not gonna do that

1675
02:58:03,819 --> 02:58:09,459
I'm not going to do that slide down the stairs

1676
02:58:09,459 --> 02:58:14,399
You want to make like a sled and go down the stairs? What are we looking for? What do we have a chance?

1677
02:58:14,680 --> 02:58:21,649
What am I gonna use for sled? You know, I could probably use the like what we use the bed sheet

1678
02:58:21,649 --> 02:58:26,229
This is the dumb actually be possible. I might actually be that makes me be easy

1679
02:58:27,920 --> 02:58:38,360
No, this is all shit. Okay. Oh, right. I don't know. How long is this? Oh, no, that's his opportunity here

1680
02:58:38,559 --> 02:59:07,649
What am I doing? Oh shit, it's an extension. What a weirdo. What are you doing? Oh, no, it's gonna happen, isn't it?

1681
02:59:07,649 --> 02:59:24,270
I don't know when it happens though

1682
02:59:25,629 --> 02:59:33,069
Fucking shit was in there. There was like a bunch of costumes. Why is this Vaughn so shitty?

1683
02:59:33,229 --> 02:59:48,700
Do I know that I'm live why does it look like I don't even know the camera's on did I think I turned the stream off?

1684
03:00:02,379 --> 03:00:21,549
I can't even hear it make a dinosaur to clay. Yeah, I know I'm extending

1685
03:00:44,450 --> 03:00:50,659
You were so thin and young this is like three years ago guys

1686
03:00:59,260 --> 03:01:01,260
I don't know

1687
03:01:01,700 --> 03:01:02,899
Okay

1688
03:01:02,899 --> 03:01:11,569
Will it happen in the next three minutes? Thank you. I need to put the mic back up to my mouth

1689
03:01:11,569 --> 03:01:17,309
What am I doing? So much you aged like milk. Um, excuse me. I don't think so Mike

1690
03:01:19,860 --> 03:01:24,579
I've aged like a fucker. I think I've aged like fucking blue cheese, which is moldy and old, but it's fucking delicious

1691
03:01:24,579 --> 03:01:26,819
What is this on me? Oh

1692
03:01:29,600 --> 03:01:34,530
ghost ectoplasm

1693
03:01:35,090 --> 03:01:38,270
Fuck is that?

1694
03:01:39,190 --> 03:01:47,799
He slimed me there was like a cobweb that was like a spider web that was fucked up

1695
03:01:51,889 --> 03:01:59,069
Anything you didn't hear anything. I actually kind of like this little microphone, right? I like it

1696
03:01:59,069 --> 03:02:04,239
I it's fun. There's a spider in here somewhere

1697
03:02:04,239 --> 03:02:08,399
Probably I probably ran it over when I was doing the fucking six sled move that you guys just saw

1698
03:02:08,479 --> 03:02:18,139
You're drunk is fucking this am I do a ghost hunt stream. Is it where is this where do the magic tricks closets?

1699
03:02:21,389 --> 03:02:27,909
Those might do the magic trick where I unplug my router on camera and plug it back in and like it turns the stream off

1700
03:02:27,909 --> 03:02:32,430
But it like doesn't write the paint cans that he has in his basement. I just disappear off cringe

1701
03:02:35,250 --> 03:02:46,739
You extending again. Oh, this is risky. I can't do a house tour guys. I can't believe that worked

1702
03:02:46,739 --> 03:02:48,860
I unplugged the ethernet from my router

1703
03:02:50,860 --> 03:02:56,059
And I would plug it back in and sprint out of the fucking room and I would just disappear why was that happening?

1704
03:03:01,090 --> 03:03:09,690
This just like scraped my nose all in we're trying to do anything right now

1705
03:03:09,690 --> 03:03:21,889
I have been trying to kill time here for like in a fucking hour almost and it's still not working. Look at me

1706
03:03:21,889 --> 03:03:27,500
Oh, yeah, it's it's off. Do I like pretend to take my shirt off do this?

1707
03:03:27,620 --> 03:03:33,409
Like can you guys hear my stomach you want to see if we could let you want me to do like an endoscopy?

1708
03:03:33,409 --> 03:03:53,969
See, let's see if you guys can hear inside my like esophagus. Could you could you hear it? It's loud inside

1709
03:03:53,969 --> 03:04:05,020
Hold on. What are you doing?

1710
03:04:14,479 --> 03:04:18,700
Screaming

1711
03:04:24,420 --> 03:04:31,979
Everybody's waiting for it. I don't know what's gonna happen though. Ears are dead. Really? I turned it down so low too

1712
03:04:31,979 --> 03:04:43,979
I'm so sorry blame

1713
03:04:43,979 --> 03:04:56,540
This is such a cursed stream. It was gross. It probably was how was my birthday pretty sick

1714
03:04:56,540 --> 03:05:04,590
So wait, okay. Hold on a second if you guys are out of extensions, that's it

1715
03:05:04,790 --> 03:05:13,879
We're good. You're not gonna see the thing you think you're gonna see. I don't

1716
03:05:23,579 --> 03:05:37,180
What are you talking about Lincoln I would say probably

1717
03:05:37,620 --> 03:05:44,139
Face probably Jefferson Grover Cleveland. I saw Grover Cleveland. You were fucked up three years ago

1718
03:05:44,139 --> 03:05:46,780
I can be a pretty good Lincoln. I think from this angle

1719
03:05:49,079 --> 03:05:51,079
Lincoln was I had a full bald head, right?

1720
03:05:53,180 --> 03:05:58,620
Lincoln Lincoln had like a ponytail, right? So Lincoln had like a bun ponytail up here

1721
03:05:58,780 --> 03:06:06,200
Okay, and he had like these long you get another one here. I get another one like that

1722
03:06:06,200 --> 03:06:14,340
If you get another one, I get another one too down here. You really want to make that trade. Do you want to extend?

1723
03:06:14,340 --> 03:06:26,760
Put it up. So, um, you got ten minutes

1724
03:06:28,860 --> 03:06:32,000
Looks like I can close my eyes and see him

1725
03:06:32,600 --> 03:06:36,520
Big eyes up here two big eyes

1726
03:06:38,120 --> 03:06:44,950
blue fur the cookie monster his mouth opens like this that he's got the no nose and

1727
03:06:46,069 --> 03:06:51,899
That's uh, he's eating cookies eating cookies a lot of are we doing it? Hey, right? Okay

1728
03:06:54,680 --> 03:07:01,100
Do you guys want to see it so bad? I don't know if it's gonna happen though. I get another one, too

1729
03:07:05,780 --> 03:07:07,780
Among us character on the whiteboard

1730
03:07:14,299 --> 03:07:16,620
Except a side profile of red

1731
03:07:17,500 --> 03:07:19,500
Is that what you mean?

1732
03:07:22,219 --> 03:07:29,790
That's so fucking funny, I'm gonna go just rage eat no, I'm not supposed to be angry about this

1733
03:07:29,790 --> 03:07:31,069
Oh, by the way, everybody

1734
03:07:31,069 --> 03:07:35,530
I have a lot of work to do you got so much work you've extended but I've got I've

1735
03:07:36,129 --> 03:07:38,129
Received into my bank account of veto

1736
03:07:39,129 --> 03:07:46,340
Interesting so I could veto this right now. It's there interesting. Well this camera angle cuz I can't even unplug

1737
03:07:47,219 --> 03:07:53,979
And tell you you don't need to know when I want to use my video I could use it whenever I want typing into

1738
03:07:53,979 --> 03:08:00,760
Google buzz feed quiz and I don't even care what the first one is. That's the one we're gonna do

1739
03:08:00,879 --> 03:08:06,370
Okay, take this pizza pizza quiz. Take this pizza quiz. How's my punch the camera?

1740
03:08:06,370 --> 03:08:13,680
We'll reveal your mental and actual age pick. Okay. Hold on a minute. Let me get this on screen

1741
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:17,479
We're gonna do a pizza quiz. It would be stupid. Nobody gets anything

1742
03:08:21,100 --> 03:08:32,280
I'm gonna hold it because I know everyone's waiting for like the look of me poses and shit that I'm gonna do

1743
03:08:32,280 --> 03:08:34,600
But it's I don't think it happens and they already think it already did happen

1744
03:08:36,469 --> 03:08:45,350
Yeah, I think you guys I think you guys screwed they're gonna get my age here

1745
03:08:45,350 --> 03:08:52,370
They're gonna get my mental age and my physical age. She was laying on the whiteboard

1746
03:08:52,370 --> 03:09:00,879
Oh you guys are you guys just blew through two extensions three extensions. It's over and I and you gave me a veto

1747
03:09:00,879 --> 03:09:08,309
It happens at 29 minutes. Oh, no

1748
03:09:10,129 --> 03:09:19,579
No, I'm the star. It was an opportunity for like a pose. I think this still is an opportunity

1749
03:09:19,579 --> 03:09:26,309
We got meat lovers seafood. Who the fuck is ordering seafood on their pizza? Yeah, I agree. That's that's weird

1750
03:09:26,309 --> 03:09:41,389
What's on there? I don't like that dinosaur feet on here. No, absolutely not preem. It's a bad take. Whatever

1751
03:09:42,149 --> 03:09:47,250
It's fine. Give me a bad take lovers. There's no meat on here meat lovers sucks. It falls apart

1752
03:09:47,250 --> 03:09:49,969
It's like be you're eating a lasagna barbecue chicken

1753
03:09:50,729 --> 03:09:55,370
Are we kids all right pepperoni that's pretty good, but who the fuck who the fuck was put who put the olives

1754
03:09:55,889 --> 03:09:59,979
walks slime rancher

1755
03:09:59,979 --> 03:10:10,340
What else should I do here? I could buy another plot. Wait, they're actually my I'm this was peel growth. Let's go

1756
03:10:10,620 --> 03:10:14,799
Yeah, this is peak like poses and doy-doy-doys and shit. I might get rid of this

1757
03:10:14,799 --> 03:10:22,209
Oh, yeah, I remember I'm soft lock myself in here, right? Okay. So what's over here? Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice

1758
03:10:22,209 --> 03:10:28,149
Why is the camera so bad looks awful in a rooster get a rooster? Well, there's no roosters over here

1759
03:10:28,829 --> 03:10:39,139
What plots it's always been this bad what not this bad I built this area myself

1760
03:10:39,260 --> 03:10:44,569
I'm just dumping an entire coffee on my ground on my desk and everything. I already did that

1761
03:10:44,569 --> 03:10:46,329
It's just this just like makes me feel cool

1762
03:10:46,329 --> 03:10:51,799
I still can't believe I actually did that earlier like a couple hours ago. Remember get a rooster

1763
03:10:51,799 --> 03:10:57,739
I will that sucks because it's been so clean in here. It really has and now it's gonna be like gross coffee

1764
03:10:57,739 --> 03:11:01,530
It's not about coffee spills. I don't know what the vile

1765
03:11:02,489 --> 03:11:05,170
Disgusting properties like enzymes and coffee or whatever

1766
03:11:05,250 --> 03:11:14,790
But when you spill coffee and it dries it smells like that dirty fucking ass garbage can it's

1767
03:11:15,309 --> 03:11:23,010
Disgusting milk. I don't I don't put milk in my coffee, but it still does that it just smells like just like just

1768
03:11:23,610 --> 03:11:28,420
decaying dead flesh or something. I'm gonna clean this again when I'm done

1769
03:11:31,409 --> 03:11:37,129
You look so young dude. This was this was like

1770
03:11:38,729 --> 03:11:40,729
Seven months ago

1771
03:11:43,819 --> 03:11:45,819
I just have a shaved face

1772
03:11:47,340 --> 03:11:50,860
I have a shaved face and a haircut

1773
03:11:58,620 --> 03:12:01,559
It's kind of weird because you guys have a real-time vision of

1774
03:12:02,180 --> 03:12:07,579
Decades plus of my life. So there will be a point where I kind of look old, right?

1775
03:12:07,579 --> 03:12:14,010
It's but maybe it's starting to happen too. You have a barometer of a decade plus of on-camera shit

1776
03:12:14,049 --> 03:12:19,409
You'll be able to know the moment that I turn old

1777
03:12:19,809 --> 03:12:24,370
Pushes away slime and you need some space you got fatter

1778
03:12:25,010 --> 03:12:36,850
Yeah, I told you I know rooster guys. I meant remind me to get a rooster not spam get a rooster

1779
03:12:40,409 --> 03:12:42,409
Will be okay grandpa

1780
03:12:44,889 --> 03:12:54,020
Hey look, I'm telling you I'm almost I'm getting closer to 40 if I can keep this up

1781
03:12:55,940 --> 03:12:57,940
If I can look

1782
03:12:58,739 --> 03:13:00,440

1783
03:13:00,440 --> 03:13:04,540

03:13:11,959 --> 03:13:15,819
Vito Vito Vito Vito Vito Vito Vito Vito Vito Vito Vito

1786
03:13:22,010 --> 03:13:26,219

Get this spy out of here. Ah

1788
03:13:29,540 --> 03:13:34,719
No, keep them up. Thank you. Keep them off the cat. What's in there listening to that shit?

1789
03:13:35,280 --> 03:13:40,760
But asking what like was I just asking what like your pregnancy cravings were what am I talking about?

1790
03:13:42,520 --> 03:13:49,200
What's what am I what is wrong with me what the fuck Jeremy what the fuck are you doing? What's wrong with you?

1791
03:13:49,200 --> 03:13:54,360

1792
03:13:54,959 --> 03:13:56,959
enough the elevator

1793
03:13:57,399 --> 03:14:03,280
That's from home alone. Oh come on. Nobody has any vetoes left. We just yet not the elevator

1794
03:14:03,280 --> 03:14:07,920
Oh, you was here last night to wasn't you? What was it? Uh you was here and you

03:14:09,280 --> 03:14:17,170
You wish you know everybody that is such a fantastic movie. I remember this happy new year

1796
03:14:18,690 --> 03:14:25,170
Keep the change you're filthy animal. That's a spy. Wow. Yeah, like four snipers sitting in the back. I just got clubbed

1797
03:14:26,170 --> 03:14:29,690
I'll save my century. Thank you Marcus van machinery. You are

1798
03:14:30,809 --> 03:14:36,290
Machinery. Yeah machine. Am I even saying that word right? All right. I'm feeling generous

1799
03:14:36,290 --> 03:14:42,530
I didn't know how to pronounce the machinist with Christian Bale. I thought it was called the mechanic. We each get two more vetoes

1800
03:14:43,409 --> 03:14:45,409
The mechanist let's go

1801
03:14:45,729 --> 03:14:52,290
We each get two more vetoes or extension. Oh my god that guy. He's killed. Let's go. How is that guy still up there?

1802
03:14:52,930 --> 03:14:55,129
Yeah, you know where to go the gates closed behind them

1803
03:14:56,850 --> 03:15:01,229
Kind of trapped we're supposed to be over. Oh, yeah, we're supposed to be over but I've just I did my ultimate extension

1804
03:15:01,770 --> 03:15:05,530
They're coming through the tunnels use one to go back. That's not how this program works

1805
03:15:07,049 --> 03:15:17,129
No deal. What do you mean? No deal the devil man is devil man up in that top left. He's being a real prick

1806
03:15:17,489 --> 03:15:19,489
Yeah, there's a heavy up there in a medic

1807
03:15:19,969 --> 03:15:24,809
This is the bonus round stuff. We're in bonus round territory. Have you said look

1808
03:15:24,969 --> 03:15:26,250
Oh

1809
03:15:26,250 --> 03:15:28,250
Look at how close you are

1810
03:15:29,049 --> 03:15:31,049
You really want to throw the opportunity away

1811
03:15:33,049 --> 03:15:39,049
Me you already won once see look at that. Look at that. It's all right there. What's the pyro pyro spy spy spy?

1812
03:15:40,090 --> 03:15:42,520
All right, let's go

1813
03:15:44,799 --> 03:15:51,040
No deal means the stream turns off have you guys speaking yourself you're doing that. Thank you you guys double enough

1814
03:15:52,639 --> 03:15:54,639
Wait a minute

1815
03:15:56,200 --> 03:15:58,200
What do I get

1816
03:16:00,479 --> 03:16:07,639
So if you get okay, how about this we're gonna remove all here's what we're doing we're gonna remove all

1817
03:16:08,399 --> 03:16:10,399
vetoes all extensions

1818
03:16:10,520 --> 03:16:14,280
Nobody can do shit. I'm gonna do the randomizer five more times

1819
03:16:14,879 --> 03:16:23,309
If it hits I actually want to veto this one. Why is why is the world shaking?

1820
03:16:23,549 --> 03:16:28,190
I

1821
03:16:28,190 --> 03:16:33,540
Can hear noises that I don't like to hear. I'm not naked. I have I'm just sunburned

1822
03:16:35,450 --> 03:16:40,579
What's that? What's this like fairy dust on the ground? Oh, this is roller skates

1823
03:16:45,430 --> 03:16:52,190
Sick I got like the roller skates I can compete in like the roller derby. I'm not naked

1824
03:16:53,110 --> 03:16:58,899
Alright, no vetoes five. This is good. This included this one four more rolls and that's it

1825
03:16:58,899 --> 03:17:06,969
I don't know what it was back in the old YouTube days. I was always red

1826
03:17:07,729 --> 03:17:09,969
Was always just sunburned every single video

1827
03:17:13,569 --> 03:17:22,190
Scares already up there

1828
03:17:27,299 --> 03:17:32,440
If I still had a veto I would get rid of it right now I swear to God it's gone

1829
03:17:32,440 --> 03:17:38,979
What is what is that? It's not there anymore. Is this before your nose job?

1830
03:17:42,100 --> 03:17:48,250
Body just tensed up. I feel I just lifted 200 pounds of weight

1831
03:17:51,239 --> 03:17:57,420
All my reps for like the week. Excuse me. It's like the thing with like the the flaming

1832
03:17:57,979 --> 03:17:59,979
Dr. Doom skull was looking at me

1833
03:18:08,790 --> 03:18:13,229
Why aren't you buff anymore, I don't know because I'm in my 30s indication of where you're

1834
03:18:14,190 --> 03:18:20,549
30s because in this video, I'm like in my mid 20s and I'm fucking jacked and sunburned

1835
03:18:20,549 --> 03:18:24,110
I would had so much vitamin D in my body that it was making my skin red

1836
03:18:25,069 --> 03:18:30,180
Okay, I'm in my 30s you some land

1837
03:18:40,590 --> 03:18:46,030
Any more of this that's not a pog

1838
03:18:54,190 --> 03:19:08,190
It's a pog face it's pog. Oh, no, this is getting hard now. Oh, yeah. Yeah

1839
03:19:08,190 --> 03:19:11,750
How long has it been I've only been recording for five minutes

1840
03:19:12,469 --> 03:19:22,770
Well, doesn't do anything. It's just kind of there for fun. Everyone got a new hat to new sunglasses

1841
03:19:23,450 --> 03:19:26,549
New new hat and every oh snooze

1842
03:19:27,530 --> 03:19:30,850
Human revolutions news. This is gonna be fucking boring

1843
03:19:30,850 --> 03:19:37,250
I can't veto this all these items if you pre-order Deus ex the new Deus ex game or you can find them in drops and they

1844
03:19:37,250 --> 03:19:41,329
Are craftable if I laugh at this I will give a hundred subs because I wanted Deus ex anyways

1845
03:19:41,610 --> 03:19:46,049
So let's get into this guys here. We're gonna start with the engineer and the new engineer items

1846
03:19:46,250 --> 03:19:52,610
Let's start by saying that this is a very very odd mechanic. Take a look at my ammo count down there

1847
03:19:52,610 --> 03:19:58,510
It takes 60 ammo to shoot it. You do not have a clip anymore. There's no reloading. There's no

1848
03:19:59,209 --> 03:20:01,409
Reload time or anything like that. It's just

1849
03:20:01,889 --> 03:20:07,170
60 metal to shoot that gun and it's 35 metal to shoot the new pistol

1850
03:20:07,450 --> 03:20:09,450
Very very weird mechanic because

1851
03:20:09,489 --> 03:20:14,770
You'll find that you'll have no more metal left to shoot the gun and you're kind of just like oh crap

1852
03:20:14,770 --> 03:20:15,569
Now what do I do?

1853
03:20:15,569 --> 03:20:18,649
It's gonna take a lot of getting used to but for a combat engineer

1854
03:20:18,649 --> 03:20:21,090
This will be a awesome new item

1855
03:20:21,489 --> 03:20:27,129
Especially the new shotgun because how many times have you been able to not place a mini century down when you wanted to?

1856
03:20:27,250 --> 03:20:30,729
Because you didn't have enough ammo or metal see look at my ammo count

1857
03:20:31,409 --> 03:20:38,729
113 96 you shoot you lose but you gain it's weird and then this new item here this new pistol it electrocutes people

1858
03:20:38,729 --> 03:20:40,090
It's very very odd

1859
03:20:40,090 --> 03:20:43,489
Hopefully we can figure this all out guys in the near future in the next couple weeks

1860
03:20:43,530 --> 03:20:50,069
It works on buildings as well. So if you shoot a building, I believe point-blank it gives you let's see here

1861
03:20:50,069 --> 03:20:56,809
I think it's I think it's 80 to 85 metal per point-blank shot. So I electrocute this sniper

1862
03:20:56,889 --> 03:21:03,129
It's kind of a weird we can't it's it's like a tesla coil kind of and it spreads I didn't want to show myself lose

1863
03:21:03,129 --> 03:21:07,569
You electrocute somebody I was getting killed around it will hit I cut single person around there

1864
03:21:07,729 --> 03:21:13,370
This also destroys projectiles the new pistol see how I shot that building how I did watch a see

1865
03:21:13,450 --> 03:21:19,489
Plus 60 plus 60 if you get close enough to people it's sort of like having infinite ammo and you never have to reload

1866
03:21:19,530 --> 03:21:26,209
But the problem here guys is you have to be a good shot if you miss all the time if you're not good with the shotgun

1867
03:21:26,250 --> 03:21:31,649
I do not recommend you try and get this item because you will just lose metal over and over again

1868
03:21:31,850 --> 03:21:37,290
So I get a little assist with that thing. It's very weird see 60 60 60 80 80

1869
03:21:37,290 --> 03:21:41,290
It's very very cool. See look see how this thing is spreading. The electrical charge is spreading around

1870
03:21:41,610 --> 03:21:46,370
Maybe it's a new spy check mechanic. Maybe you can check for spies. I'm not sure yet guys

1871
03:21:46,370 --> 03:21:48,409
This is the first time I've ever played with it

1872
03:21:48,649 --> 03:21:52,770
Just want to make sure I get you guys some cool gameplay with it. You see exactly how the item works

1873
03:21:52,770 --> 03:21:59,010
I haven't tried to destroy any projectiles with it yet with the with the pistol because I hadn't I didn't really have a chance to be

1874
03:21:59,010 --> 03:22:01,489
Honest so trying to get that to work

1875
03:22:01,489 --> 03:22:07,090
I'm assuming that it's sort of like a reflect you just click it just did it did it did it you just click once and

1876
03:22:07,090 --> 03:22:11,409
That's it. Let's move on to the spy. This is really really cool. You'll see I think I'm all right

1877
03:22:11,409 --> 03:22:16,010
I decloak next to this century over here. It doesn't matter like I'm all right mini century

1878
03:22:16,010 --> 03:22:20,209
It can be a big century backstab the engine. Thank God. Okay, please

1879
03:22:20,889 --> 03:22:22,649
Thank God

1880
03:22:22,649 --> 03:22:24,649
People were saying these clips are so bad

1881
03:22:24,889 --> 03:22:35,069
Guys wake up at 5 a.m. Some of you do e3 2019

1882
03:22:40,420 --> 03:22:48,540
Well, most do you get up at like 11 10, you know, why some of you especially during the summertime, you know

1883
03:22:48,540 --> 03:22:54,309
I've got that got demographics. I actually do page. I know I know

1884
03:22:56,389 --> 03:22:58,870
Count Olaf hair. Well, I look so much worse

1885
03:23:01,250 --> 03:23:06,250
I look so much better over here. I mean, I'm getting that haircut again

1886
03:23:11,639 --> 03:23:19,959
When I was in college, I don't get up till fucking like 6 p.m. So you look dirty

1887
03:23:19,959 --> 03:23:27,399
Oh, yeah, we get up at 5 every day. I don't look dirty. Who's older. Sorry the data says otherwise

1888
03:23:27,760 --> 03:23:38,959
How do we know how old you are? I just have a beard. I have morning classes. Not right now. I wink here

1889
03:23:38,959 --> 03:23:42,520
What are you in that you wouldn't high school or college right now?

1890
03:23:44,819 --> 03:23:49,639
You're out or into this you're at school

1891
03:23:50,159 --> 03:23:53,579
You got up at like fucking 8 o'clock this afternoon Hugh Hefner

1892
03:23:58,159 --> 03:24:04,680
That's how you can tell I fucking stay up really late 8 p.m. Is like in the middle of the afternoon old German that smells better

1893
03:24:05,200 --> 03:24:10,940
Mmm, I don't think so. I think we smell about the same. I stayed up all night

1894
03:24:10,940 --> 03:24:14,100
I was thinking about doing that because I didn't want to miss this because I really

1895
03:24:15,100 --> 03:24:17,100
We got three more

1896
03:24:19,620 --> 03:24:22,620
Left arm is creepy. Why cuz I'm wearing a bathrobe

1897
03:24:29,100 --> 03:24:31,600
There's no wink I would have been delirious

1898
03:24:35,879 --> 03:24:41,680
Lipstick no, it's called that. My lips are always dry. So I have to always put an application on right now

1899
03:24:43,520 --> 03:24:56,430
I've a lot of different looks guys, although I haven't worn a suit and probably ten years

1900
03:24:56,770 --> 03:25:02,229
Well, you should do that. I've done that before and it's I just okay. Do you remember the first?

1901
03:25:03,159 --> 03:25:07,370
15 to 20 minutes of this stream go watch it

1902
03:25:08,409 --> 03:25:11,549
Look like you drink blood. Let's go. But do you remember go watch that?

1903
03:25:11,549 --> 03:25:15,809
I was sitting here just turning the stream on just barely had woken up and I'm just like I

1904
03:25:17,270 --> 03:25:19,389
I was weird. I was a weirdo

1905
03:25:20,030 --> 03:25:22,469
In a cap, but there's no reason for me to be here

1906
03:25:22,469 --> 03:25:26,309
I'm gonna try and pick off people that come out of the spawn and nobody really comes out

1907
03:25:27,069 --> 03:25:33,549
Again no reactions at all zero emotion or I'll give the hundreds of trying to find somebody that I can't shoot that guy

1908
03:25:33,549 --> 03:25:34,450
I can't shoot that guy

1909
03:25:34,450 --> 03:25:37,469
So I just go over to the right side of the spawn and I end up getting a heavy

1910
03:25:37,590 --> 03:25:43,190
He just kind of comes out and he just bang gets him right there. That's gonna be the end of the gameplay guys

1911
03:25:43,670 --> 03:25:47,069
Thank you all so much for watching. I really appreciate all the support over

1912
03:25:47,709 --> 03:25:51,829
So I'll see you all next time and take care everybody. That was a great gameplay

1913
03:25:52,469 --> 03:26:03,079
That one doesn't count. Yeah, actually does not count. Oops

1914
03:26:03,559 --> 03:26:06,950
It's not over. No, it's not that doesn't count

1915
03:26:07,309 --> 03:26:12,010
Tris to game play commentary and tonight

1916
03:26:12,010 --> 03:26:16,170
I don't plan as the demo man with the stuff that's on the screen right now

1917
03:26:16,170 --> 03:26:19,209
I believe it's the strange lock and load the charge and torch and the

1918
03:26:19,530 --> 03:26:25,850
Islander strange Islander and of course you got a hats and crap the miscellaneous whatever battery canteen

1919
03:26:25,850 --> 03:26:31,770
I don't want to give advice. No, it's an advice video not really to do about the game. It's an advice video

1920
03:26:31,809 --> 03:26:39,180
What's the advice fortress to specifically how to get better at landing your pipe? Oh, no, no, no anything in this game

1921
03:26:39,180 --> 03:26:41,739
No, no, no as travel time. No, no

1922
03:26:42,739 --> 03:26:47,260
No, although this will probably help you out with your skits his skit scan

1923
03:26:47,260 --> 03:26:50,100
What the hell was I gonna just say with your hit scan as well?

1924
03:26:50,260 --> 03:26:56,280
But it's mainly gonna focus on the travel time things like the demo man pipes all the checks moment

1925
03:26:56,280 --> 03:26:59,399
And even the syringe gun this could probably help you out with the syringe gun as well

1926
03:26:59,479 --> 03:27:02,239
And what it is, it's TR walkway

1927
03:27:03,040 --> 03:27:09,399
I didn't know anything about this map for the longest time and just very recent. Wait, we don't have that there was no

1928
03:27:11,040 --> 03:27:16,239
Deal it's a map you can play pretty much by yourself deals begins now and shooting bots no laughing

1929
03:27:16,239 --> 03:27:19,559
It might seem like the most mundane boring thing in the world

1930
03:27:19,639 --> 03:27:23,420
But it actually is pretty addicting and they just keep coming out and you're on the red team

1931
03:27:23,420 --> 03:27:28,360
They're on the blue team and it's just they walk in a straight line straight at you and you can kind of make some

1932
03:27:28,879 --> 03:27:33,639
Adjustments you can make them do jumps. You can make them move in a different direction and it's pretty fun

1933
03:27:33,639 --> 03:27:37,360
You'll find yourself just sitting there for what seems like hours

1934
03:27:37,920 --> 03:27:43,920
Shooting at these bots and it's so important that you do this for a while and you practice inside a TR walkway

1935
03:27:43,920 --> 03:27:50,520
This is good. Eventually your memory will get down to a point where you know exactly where to put this is not cringe

1936
03:27:50,520 --> 03:27:54,879
This is actually good advice. You'll go. Oh, this guy's moving in the direction that I'm used to

1937
03:27:54,879 --> 03:27:59,079
I know where I'm supposed to place this because I know exactly how it's going to move

1938
03:27:59,079 --> 03:28:03,799
I know how the trajectory is gonna go and it's gonna hit the guy and he's gonna die and I'm gonna get more points

1939
03:28:03,799 --> 03:28:11,090
and I'm gonna do better in team fortress 2 and I mentioned why it's so important to be good advice is cringe because

1940
03:28:12,010 --> 03:28:14,850
Everybody always says that to get better in the game

1941
03:28:14,850 --> 03:28:17,090
You got to play you got to practice to get better

1942
03:28:17,090 --> 03:28:18,450
You just play and you get better

1943
03:28:18,450 --> 03:28:23,209
But it can be pretty damn hard sometimes because when you get into a server and there's a bunch of people that are way better

1944
03:28:23,250 --> 03:28:27,090
Than you you're not gonna get to practice your rocket launcher

1945
03:28:27,450 --> 03:28:31,450
Shots because they're gonna just kill you in less than a second. So true. You're gonna start to feel bad

1946
03:28:31,450 --> 03:28:34,889
So what did the bots don't attack back is the main thing?

1947
03:28:34,889 --> 03:28:38,250
They just move and you can practice and it's a way better

1948
03:28:38,610 --> 03:28:43,409
Environment and a way better place to get comfortable with the way that these weapons actually work. That's right

1949
03:28:43,409 --> 03:28:43,729
Yeah

1950
03:28:43,729 --> 03:28:49,370
You don't have to feel so pressured by going up against these guys that have been playing forever that I know everything about every class

1951
03:28:49,370 --> 03:28:55,090
You can take your time with it and just sit sort of in a corner and just get used to the way the

1952
03:28:55,489 --> 03:28:59,489
TF2 was out for three weeks after I made that, you know, I come on

1953
03:29:00,569 --> 03:29:07,569
The game came out two weeks ago according to this video is one thing but my pipes landed with demo man has gone up

1954
03:29:08,489 --> 03:29:10,489
Significantly, we got two more

1955
03:29:11,809 --> 03:29:19,209
He said I'm gonna give you mortality and send you back to earth to solve the world's problems

1956
03:29:19,409 --> 03:29:21,649
And I said, okay

1957
03:29:21,889 --> 03:29:28,610
Send me back Roger that and I arrived in a basket at the Denver School for baby

1958
03:29:28,729 --> 03:29:37,110
Ninja frog people and I befriended your frogs and they said thank you and I said except for one frog named

1959
03:29:37,110 --> 03:29:43,989
Timmy he used to make I can't veto anymore. He's dead. He's been dead for 70 years. Holy shit

1960
03:29:44,950 --> 03:29:51,459
Let me look at my calendar here the fucking these drawings there's German's birth. There's my birthday

1961
03:29:51,979 --> 03:29:57,959
Wow, really? It's been like 82 years since I killed Timmy. Hope his parents aren't that mad at me

1962
03:29:57,959 --> 03:30:03,360
Whatever. Let's get back into this. So I got a job selling old shoes or

1963
03:30:04,200 --> 03:30:08,799
Well, you can put whatever you want here cuz I didn't have a job for the last like probably 40 years

1964
03:30:08,799 --> 03:30:14,239
I got a job at the fishing dock. I was the guy that peeled all the fishes scales off

1965
03:30:14,239 --> 03:30:17,399
I used to eat them and might be weird to a lot of you guys

1966
03:30:17,399 --> 03:30:21,360
But do you think I give a fuck and then came my adult life?

1967
03:30:23,200 --> 03:30:30,639
You've never seen you've never seen quite an action-packed adventure like this one

1968
03:30:31,040 --> 03:30:35,959
Gather your friends and explore the wonderful land of Azeroth

1969
03:30:35,959 --> 03:30:40,549
I actually don't there's context for these videos

1970
03:30:40,870 --> 03:30:46,409
I'm about to pause this motherfucker right now and again drop some knowledge on you all okay

1971
03:30:47,290 --> 03:30:53,049
2002 listen, all right listen to me out of an airplane there and Insta died on the concrete

1972
03:30:54,090 --> 03:30:59,489
Oh, we're gonna pause this we're gonna pause the timer too. It doesn't matter. There's not even as much time left in the video

1973
03:30:59,750 --> 03:31:05,579
Okay, so a long time ago. I had this character named grandpa, right grandpa

1974
03:31:05,579 --> 03:31:09,579
I made videos for machinima and they did really really well

1975
03:31:09,579 --> 03:31:13,819
I made like grandpa as an MLG pro and holy fuck people loved it

1976
03:31:14,319 --> 03:31:17,739
I got like two hundred thousand views and remember I was like a

1977
03:31:18,610 --> 03:31:22,649
I got that guy was like a thousand two thousand three thousand views a video on my youtube channel

1978
03:31:23,010 --> 03:31:26,329
So holy fucking smokes. I just leaned into it

1979
03:31:26,329 --> 03:31:32,719
I leaned into it hard and I made like fucking 20 of these so I was holy shit people like this

1980
03:31:32,719 --> 03:31:39,870
I'm gonna keep making more of these grandpa videos, so that's why this is here people wanted to know more about them

1981
03:31:39,870 --> 03:31:45,500
I don't guys I canonically killed this character twice

1982
03:31:46,299 --> 03:31:54,559
Grandpa's dead. He's been kin. He's canonically gone from the universe into heaven and then here's a funny story guys

1983
03:31:54,559 --> 03:31:59,319
I was in Moses's science class and guess who sits behind me, but God himself

1984
03:31:59,440 --> 03:32:04,040
I walked up to him after class at his locker, and I just simply asked him God

1985
03:32:04,040 --> 03:32:09,379
You know could I have like five more years on earth just Peter Griffin had to trade my fucking lunchables for it

1986
03:32:09,379 --> 03:32:24,680
But I'm here. I don't even need to do that. Oh, it's super toothless. Joe. Whatever his name is these guys freaked me out

1987
03:32:24,959 --> 03:32:33,389
This is scary, this is a long time ago. I've had all the warhammer games for a pretty long time

1988
03:32:34,610 --> 03:32:43,200
Super super yeah, you are a fan of super yes, I would highly recommend you get the original dawn of war I

1989
03:32:44,209 --> 03:32:48,409
Wasn't a fan of dawn of war 2 this is my old Isaac better than the new Isaac

1990
03:32:48,409 --> 03:32:53,809
It was a good game, but I don't think it was nearly as good as dawn of war 1. What is this and?

1991
03:32:54,530 --> 03:32:56,530
Grandpa tries

1992
03:32:57,290 --> 03:33:04,750
Come on come right here come on you want to talk about leaning into it come on same error and soda and

1993
03:33:05,639 --> 03:33:08,559
Holy shit, this is the same era. I wasn't making that up

1994
03:33:12,469 --> 03:33:14,809
We need to find that part

1995
03:33:14,809 --> 03:33:19,719
Fuck the timer. I'm freezing this

1996
03:33:20,100 --> 03:33:27,159
I'm literally gonna find where grandpa plays cuz I want to show you guys what it really means to like grab on to something

1997
03:33:27,159 --> 03:33:31,579
And fucking lean into it

1998
03:33:32,260 --> 03:33:37,520
In the title it's in the title of the video so that means you know

1999
03:33:37,520 --> 03:33:40,719
It's a it's about four to four to ten seconds in the actual video

2000
03:33:40,719 --> 03:33:45,200
It's probably less than 20 seconds in the actual video. Where is it?

2001
03:33:53,100 --> 03:34:01,120
Where's grandpa you know what we might even do it again good position times

2002
03:34:03,020 --> 03:34:11,530
Lean into the sus guy you don't think I've learned my lesson by now. Um I've learned my lesson

2003
03:34:13,549 --> 03:34:15,549
And I died whatever you're gonna

2004

2035
03:37:36,280 --> 03:37:40,610
You play super meat boy, he dies the first level and he throws the controller through the window

2036
03:37:48,649 --> 03:37:50,649
Anybody find that one

2037
03:37:51,489 --> 03:37:55,809
All right, let's go back to what we were doing. I'm telling you I leaned into it

2038
03:37:55,809 --> 03:38:00,000
A lot of you guys can't it stayed on this channel for grandpa

2039
03:38:00,639 --> 03:38:07,809
Actually, you know, I can't talk shit about grandpa literally launch pad my entire career online

2040
03:38:08,049 --> 03:38:15,100
If it wasn't for grandpa, I don't even think I would have grown at the rate that I did I really don't think so

2041
03:38:15,100 --> 03:38:18,079
I went from like

2042
03:38:18,079 --> 03:38:23,719
5,000 view youtuber to like getting hundreds of thousands of views on videos because grandpa was in them

2043
03:38:23,719 --> 03:38:36,629
It was springboarded my whole career. I can't hate grandpa. I core I can't somebody found it. Okay. Well, we'll watch it in a second

2044
03:38:38,399 --> 03:38:55,979
Let's go. We have two more and then that's it. I'm done. Here we go. Turn the timer on we got two more of these

2045
03:38:56,340 --> 03:38:59,030
No, don't turn that off you idiot

2046
03:39:03,549 --> 03:39:06,110
invasion stuff German versus star and the

2047
03:39:07,750 --> 03:39:13,559
Really easy just to turn your brain off and if grandpa shows up, I'm fucking leaving

2048
03:39:17,040 --> 03:39:22,969
I'm gonna play Diablo 3 just kind of run around and swirl when people maybe

2049
03:39:23,409 --> 03:39:28,969
Maybe I'll play like Hearthstone and be terrible. No, I veto this whole

2050
03:39:30,729 --> 03:39:33,250
Delete this stream delete it like what's

2051
03:39:35,629 --> 03:39:42,149
German and versus star in versus TF to wait German versus star versus TF to in binding of Isaac

2052
03:39:42,149 --> 03:39:46,819
What's that title supposed to mean? I don't have a game to show you look at this old

2053
03:39:47,299 --> 03:39:57,829
Like starting soon screen. I can either play Hearthstone and be terrible binding of Isaac or Diablo. Which one?

2054
03:39:58,190 --> 03:40:04,559
Those are all awful choices. I would honestly if I'm in the stream. I'm hitting the X

2055
03:40:04,559 --> 03:40:11,959
I'm gonna warn you guys watching me play Hearthstone is going to drive a ton of you crazy. I didn't even hear that

2056
03:40:11,959 --> 03:40:15,620
I've been gone for at least 30 seconds. Let's do a

2057
03:40:15,899 --> 03:40:17,940
I'll come back and see if he's playing Isaac later

2058
03:40:17,940 --> 03:40:28,219
I'm gonna do one of those fancy poles that you see from time to time. He couldn't do comedy without grandpa

2059
03:40:28,860 --> 03:40:36,879
Grandpa was sort of a an outlet to be a weirdo. He really was changing

2060
03:40:36,879 --> 03:40:41,440
I didn't even guys I didn't there was a period from when I first started doing videos

2061
03:40:41,440 --> 03:40:49,989
I started out kind of like vulgar like I did like vulgar like swears and stuff and then like six months after I started YouTube

2062
03:40:50,030 --> 03:40:51,860
I

2063
03:40:51,860 --> 03:40:53,860
Went to no swears

2064
03:40:54,479 --> 03:40:58,360
Completely like PG PG 13. I didn't say okay. I didn't say shit

2065
03:40:58,360 --> 03:41:02,639
I said like crap and like oh like freaking and stuff. I didn't swear

2066
03:41:02,639 --> 03:41:09,329
I used grandpa as a means to just say and do whatever I wanted and we have you have

2067
03:41:09,930 --> 03:41:11,209
30 seconds to vote by the way

2068
03:41:11,209 --> 03:41:16,709
You have 30 seconds to vote on this ball because it's grandpa is not me

2069
03:41:16,829 --> 03:41:25,870
It was a period of like at least a year or two where I didn't swear and then stir made a video of all this

2070
03:41:26,149 --> 03:41:27,350
Footage

2071
03:41:27,350 --> 03:41:28,959
destroying everything

2072
03:41:28,959 --> 03:41:34,239
stir made a video of all of all this footage of like him recording me and like being in like me freaking out and like saying

2073
03:41:34,239 --> 03:41:35,799
swears and just kind of

2074
03:41:35,799 --> 03:41:38,610
Uncensored and then I couldn't be that guy anymore

2075
03:41:38,770 --> 03:41:45,229
you know what I mean when you have me like calling stir like a piece of fucking garbage and I'm like I

2076
03:41:45,750 --> 03:41:47,229
fucking want to like

2077
03:41:47,229 --> 03:41:51,799
Attack him with like a fucking hammer or whatever like I'm gonna put cigarettes out like you know what I mean

2078
03:41:51,799 --> 03:41:58,739
Like you can't be the guy that doesn't swear anymore after that. Well, I could not keep that up after that

2079
03:41:58,739 --> 03:42:05,520
It was exposed

2080
03:42:07,200 --> 03:42:13,440
Give me a real tree, please. God damn it. Why could you get mad at real trees? What the fuck are these?

2081
03:42:13,920 --> 03:42:15,920
How do you get mad at minecraft trees?

2082
03:42:16,319 --> 03:42:23,239
How do you keep fucking knife and I'm stabbing a motherfucker in the chest? I swear to God

2083
03:42:23,600 --> 03:42:25,600
What the fuck are you talking about? What?

2084
03:42:26,000 --> 03:42:27,559
What is he saying?

2085
03:42:27,559 --> 03:42:38,690
What?

2086
03:42:38,690 --> 03:42:40,450
Shit-faced

2087
03:42:40,450 --> 03:42:53,430
Eat my asshole. Seriously my god. I have to feed on this one. How was that an apple?

2088
03:42:59,540 --> 03:43:01,739
What's wrong with me why am I so mad

2089
03:43:02,620 --> 03:43:16,829
Where's PG Jerma blame stir?

2090
03:43:17,190 --> 03:43:23,149
He caught me on camera talking about like cigarettes butts being put on like my dick and shit and I was over I turned into

2091
03:43:23,149 --> 03:43:25,989
This guy I would have been like PG Andy. I

2092
03:43:26,989 --> 03:43:30,229
Would have my career. I want to know what my career would have looked like after that

2093
03:43:31,430 --> 03:43:34,250
Digging straight down. Yeah, that's fine. We'll be fine

2094
03:43:34,250 --> 03:43:42,719
I would probably have like a hundred million views on my videos playing fortnight, you know

2095
03:43:42,719 --> 03:43:44,280
I would have been like I would just I don't know

2096
03:43:44,280 --> 03:44:00,329
What would I have done some armor if I didn't go down that route God road would I've been on he's still here

2097
03:44:05,280 --> 03:44:10,340
Stir saved this channel. I

2098
03:44:11,459 --> 03:44:16,610
Don't think I would have done that though. Now. Let's go get some let's go get some goddamn armor

2099
03:44:16,610 --> 03:44:17,409
What do you say? Well, I don't know

2100
03:44:17,489 --> 03:44:24,860
I can't tell you the different like multiverses would I have okay if stir didn't make Jerma is mad one two three and four

2101
03:44:24,860 --> 03:44:36,139
I mean how would I have been playing among us and leaned into the sus guy? Jesus? That's something to think about

2102
03:44:36,379 --> 03:44:48,819
What is that noise? What the fuck is this noise? Why does it look like ass today? Okay, keep going

2103
03:44:48,819 --> 03:44:55,659
It's so blurry and like zoomed in. What do you say gamers? Just wait it just give me a minute

2104
03:44:55,780 --> 03:45:03,500
All right, this is the final one. We're ending on this one. This is it. Whatever it is in the description

2105
03:45:03,579 --> 03:45:06,360
It's a horror game. Oh my fucking early

2106
03:45:06,360 --> 03:45:10,100
It's one of the scariest damn games ever made now

2107
03:45:10,100 --> 03:45:15,100
I don't do well with these types of games and as you can see I'm down the first flight of stairs and I already don't

2108
03:45:15,100 --> 03:45:21,260
Want to play is that is that I don't do is that kind of easy cheese in there in case something crazy

2109
03:45:21,260 --> 03:45:28,579
Yeah, what's that cheese? So let's get started and to try not to psych myself out while I do this

2110
03:45:28,780 --> 03:45:31,280
I'm gonna give you the

2111
03:45:31,360 --> 03:45:36,319
Backstory of the game so pretty much this game

2112
03:45:39,100 --> 03:45:44,879
What's this room? This is my old room. So pretty much from like 12 years ago two days

2113
03:45:46,180 --> 03:45:52,120
19-year-old German. No, not that young. He said he did it on coffee breaks and it's a stairways

2114
03:45:58,100 --> 03:46:00,100
Somebody's coming behind me right now

2115
03:46:00,540 --> 03:46:03,030
Yeah, who cares?

2116
03:46:03,989 --> 03:46:11,700
Really all you do. God. God. Damn it. Who fucking makes their bed? Nobody

2117
03:46:15,760 --> 03:46:18,559
This is literally acting and I'm faking this whole thing. Aren't I look at me?

2118
03:46:20,010 --> 03:46:23,170
Dude, this this this could last like less than three minutes

2119
03:46:23,170 --> 03:46:34,540
Like I this could end I might just rage to quit look at how I do look so young though

2120
03:46:34,540 --> 03:46:43,000
I was probably 25 maybe 25 26 Jesus damn it

2121
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:48,190
I hate this but you go down a series of stairs

2122
03:46:48,870 --> 03:46:52,520
Over and over are you so caked because I was in the gym every day

2123
03:46:52,520 --> 03:46:58,629
That's the game and the goal is to see how far you can go down how many stairs you can go down

2124
03:46:58,629 --> 03:47:02,559
I'm at floor number six and I'm almost ready to just quit this game

2125
03:47:02,719 --> 03:47:11,239
And it looks insane to that. I think I keep on repeating myself probably but that's because I am terrified right now

2126
03:47:11,239 --> 03:47:14,680
You look like you sniffed radioactive material

2127
03:47:17,840 --> 03:47:23,090
It's called I don't I didn't white balance my cameras and the screen is like green

2128
03:47:30,319 --> 03:47:32,319
Extend all right fine

2129
03:47:39,909 --> 03:47:44,170
Yeah, which sucks I I it's okay here's thing it's a lot different streaming a horror game

2130
03:47:44,829 --> 03:47:49,030
Then recording a video for a horror game because like I don't feel alone when I stream it

2131
03:47:49,030 --> 03:47:51,030
But I am alone when I record it

2132
03:47:51,030 --> 03:48:05,579
That's the worst part about this stuff is getting just loud horrible. It's a little it's different. It is see it's so much repetition

2133
03:48:05,579 --> 03:48:08,899
That it's you just you're doing the same thing over and over again

2134
03:48:08,899 --> 03:48:11,860
And you know at some point look like you're wearing eyeshadow

2135
03:48:11,860 --> 03:48:24,420
I think I just have that I'm just young something horrible is gonna happen. You just don't know when so I

2136
03:48:25,040 --> 03:48:29,319
I'm gonna my if you hit escape you end the game hitting escape ends it

2137
03:48:29,879 --> 03:48:38,100
Yeah, I know that everybody the meme was like you have a toilet paper roll and like lotion behind you and like a can easy cheese

2138
03:48:38,100 --> 03:48:40,219
I don't know whatever whatever the fuck that is

2139
03:48:40,219 --> 03:48:45,590
I don't know if it's in this video or not is that toilet paper back there next to the bed

2140
03:49:03,909 --> 03:49:09,969
Floor 20 floor 20 I've lost that accent in the last 10 to 15 years. Holy shit

2141
03:49:22,239 --> 03:49:24,239
This is not even that long

2142
03:49:25,479 --> 03:49:37,299
Bastard you son of a bitch you have a Vegas accent now. There is no Vegas accent

2143
03:49:37,299 --> 03:49:42,700
I don't think I'll be able to I think I'll be able to go past 30. We want 10 more

2144
03:49:48,600 --> 03:49:53,469
There's no more timer we're just gonna go timer was fun

2145
03:49:53,469 --> 03:50:00,200
It's the first and given a hundred community subs from the bingo no more bingo. We'll just play some we'll do we'll do it

2146
03:50:00,200 --> 03:50:05,510
Like five ten more times. Let's kill that timer

2147
03:50:06,399 --> 03:50:08,760
The shadows are really starting to mess with you now

2148
03:50:08,760 --> 03:50:11,399
Like the shadows are really starting to kick in and really stuff

2149
03:50:11,399 --> 03:50:14,440
It just shows you just how much horror games have evolved in the last 10 years

2150
03:50:15,000 --> 03:50:17,680
people were freaking out over a

2151
03:50:17,879 --> 03:50:19,879
little mask on a staircase in

2152
03:50:22,200 --> 03:50:27,690
Outlast 2 you like birthed a demon baby. I can't even look at the screen

2153
03:50:27,690 --> 03:50:35,219
I can't I seriously can't look at the screen and my whole body is like hurts right now, but I turn off

2154
03:50:35,700 --> 03:50:43,719
What is that? That's a face. Oh my god

2155
03:50:45,879 --> 03:50:47,879
Like scary anymore

2156
03:50:47,920 --> 03:50:56,069
That's like just a guy all right. What's on the back there? What is that? It's like a fucking orange juice. There's a guy

2157
03:50:59,379 --> 03:51:05,459
Orange juice a fucking oh mega Bible. What's this? Oh mega Bible like I don't know what this is

2158
03:51:06,020 --> 03:51:14,799
What is this a minute made like a hairspray a huge thing of lotion tissues?

2159
03:51:14,799 --> 03:51:21,719
I don't know what this even is I think this is cheese. This is like no what is this like oil for your car

2160
03:51:23,920 --> 03:51:30,399

2161
03:51:30,399 --> 03:51:33,079
I don't know what that goes to coffee mug

03:51:33,079 --> 03:51:40,299
I don't I don't know what all this stuff even is supposed to be I have no idea

There was a shelf here with I don't know what I don't know this aren't like is that a bell pepper?

2164
03:51:46,319 --> 03:51:53,579
It's a car guys. I have no idea you just didn't have it together

2165
03:51:54,739 --> 03:52:01,030
Hold on. What's it? Do I move to see the other side? Let me see the other side

2166
03:52:03,069 --> 03:52:05,069
This is like cigarette juice

2167
03:52:05,190 --> 03:52:14,069
Was like dipping and like spitting tobacco into this thing. What is that? There's a dog food on the ground

2168
03:52:14,069 --> 03:52:17,969
What was it? Hold on. What is this like rat shit down here?

2169
03:52:18,430 --> 03:52:28,860
What is this? What are these pellets? I don't I haven't guys I have absolutely no idea. It's soy sauce. Hold on. Oh

03:52:31,040 --> 03:52:45,190
My god, Jeremy. Hold on move move the head. I think that's cologne move. This is a candle

2171
03:52:45,190 --> 03:52:52,879
I think this is like Vicks vapor rub. Oh boy

2172
03:53:09,989 --> 03:53:14,030
Listen to me. Okay, this is really important. I don't know why this is in the room

2173
03:53:14,030 --> 03:53:20,899
I have no idea what it's doing in the room. But listen, this is dog vitamins

2174
03:53:21,180 --> 03:53:31,139
This is big a big pump of omega-3 for dogs. I don't know if I was eating this

2175
03:53:31,139 --> 03:53:36,700
I don't think I don't think I was eating this but I mean it's possible. I might have been I don't think I was eating that

2176
03:53:36,700 --> 03:53:41,059
But like it's it's a huge pump for it's not lotion

2177
03:53:41,540 --> 03:53:54,959
It's literally fucking dog vitamins. I don't know why it's so big is exposed

2178
03:53:55,079 --> 03:53:57,879
It says it was omega-3 dog pump vitamins

2179
03:53:58,040 --> 03:54:02,639
I have no idea what that is and I don't even know what the hat was either. It's like a gas station hat

2180
03:54:02,639 --> 03:54:10,459
I don't know what that even is. I can't even make out what the fuck this is on my head. Is this like a

2181
03:54:11,540 --> 03:54:13,969
Valphaline, what is this?

2182
03:54:19,120 --> 03:54:28,459
Okay, this is like a jiffy lube hat. I don't even know what that is

2183
03:54:31,930 --> 03:54:44,040
Hey, we're gonna do another one. Let's just go again. Oh nice dusk. I was there's a Jax moment

2184
03:54:44,040 --> 03:54:56,809
We can add it. Why did you have dog? But I don't know

2185
03:54:57,530 --> 03:55:00,889
Stuff just kind of accumulates in random places

2186
03:55:01,530 --> 03:55:11,040
Yeah, and the tissues and the dog vitamin lotion was in a really weird place

2187
03:55:11,040 --> 03:55:15,680
I understand but I'm not it wasn't just sitting there. I oh

2188
03:55:21,440 --> 03:55:34,809
My goodness, I don't think I was eating it had to be a reason why it was there right next to the bed though

2189
03:55:34,809 --> 03:55:36,809
What is it doing there?

2190
03:55:36,930 --> 03:55:41,270
Keep a timer on so you don't stay for too long. I

2191
03:55:42,110 --> 03:55:48,399
Can keep an eye on it was lotion. It was not what lotion company?

2192
03:55:48,399 --> 03:55:50,399
Do you know that makes a weird?

2193
03:55:50,440 --> 03:55:53,680
gigantic like coffee syrup pump like that

2194
03:55:54,000 --> 03:56:01,120
That's that big with a long neck. They don't make it like that with the yellow front

2195
03:56:01,799 --> 03:56:05,559
No, they don't have like the big long fucking turkey neck

2196
03:56:07,440 --> 03:56:11,020
It wasn't lotion was dog vitamins. It was a dog vitamin omega-3 pump

2197
03:56:15,940 --> 03:56:20,719
Something else it's kind of funny to note and I will give you a little bit more

2198
03:56:21,159 --> 03:56:24,819
Like ammo to fire at me the tissue box was empty

2199
03:56:25,760 --> 03:56:30,920
Wow must have been really fucking it must have been really going for it. There's nothing left in there

2200
03:56:38,840 --> 03:56:47,559
God I was just me playing dusk. Whatever. I'm good at this game. Oh, this is a classic. I love this one

2201
03:56:59,799 --> 03:57:12,020
Has this game seen any updates? I feel like this game is really fun. Where's the other wrestler? Oh, they were invisible

2202
03:57:12,700 --> 03:57:14,700
Right. I forgot they're invisible

2203
03:57:18,399 --> 03:57:22,040
You can make the characters invisible

2204
03:57:22,559 --> 03:57:33,250
Wrestling Empire got an update. Yeah, that game was the funniest thing I've ever seen

2205
03:57:33,850 --> 03:57:37,360
All right, let's go again skip

2206
03:57:37,959 --> 03:57:41,120
Little set of clips here, especially in this first one

2207
03:57:41,239 --> 03:57:43,239
circulation nine people in a row and

2208
03:57:43,440 --> 03:57:46,680
Really after playing with this for maybe an hour or two

2209
03:57:46,680 --> 03:57:48,680
I think it took me maybe an hour to get this gameplay

2210
03:57:48,760 --> 03:57:52,020
So after playing with this for a little while I've come to the realization

2211
03:57:52,180 --> 03:57:59,260
What is it I want to do this with the connivorous kunai get a backstab on somebody and just go for the headshots

2212
03:57:59,420 --> 03:58:01,959
All right, fuck off. Yes

2213
03:58:02,600 --> 03:58:05,670
This guy's shit face. He'll be easy. I

2214
03:58:08,819 --> 03:58:17,540
Love it classic. I want to just please have need to make I want more of these I would pay a hundred dollars

2215
03:58:18,379 --> 03:58:23,860
Retail for one of these another one. I would pay a thousand dollars. No, that's way too much

2216
03:58:23,860 --> 03:58:25,860
I'd pay I'd pay a hundred bucks in one of these

2217
03:58:27,950 --> 03:58:30,770
Did he just not even shoot the gun?

2218
03:58:34,049 --> 03:58:37,700
Time for diet and your time has come

2219
03:58:42,329 --> 03:58:46,649
I knew it was in the book. I knew it was in the fucking book and now I lost and it's over

2220
03:58:52,760 --> 03:59:02,469
Yeah, I want to okay, I want to like see some other streamers play these games

2221
03:59:02,469 --> 03:59:10,000
You know, I mean quality acting job lady. Which one is it? I like member when we talked about sharing things

2222
03:59:10,540 --> 03:59:14,059
Yeah, I would love to see other people play this cartoon bag

2223
03:59:14,059 --> 03:59:19,100
I want to watch like streamers play this that's seriously she ran out of there with like a mcduck bag

2224
03:59:19,219 --> 03:59:23,420
You're not gonna fool me. What about this guy Vinny played? Oh Vinny is a connoisseur

2225
03:59:25,219 --> 03:59:28,940
Shit, it doesn't surprise me. He's 500 fucking IQ brain. That does not surprise me

2226
03:59:34,940 --> 03:59:37,500
Thank you shot the ground

2227
03:59:38,500 --> 03:59:41,940
Did they shoot the ground this was directly into the dirt?

2228
03:59:43,059 --> 03:59:48,299
Why is that guy a quick draw fast McGraw? No, we need to gate. He's no get out. We shut up

2229
03:59:49,020 --> 03:59:51,020
No gatekeeping video games

2230
03:59:51,180 --> 03:59:53,180
I have no idea what this guy just said

2231
03:59:53,739 --> 03:59:56,360
Hold on. Wait, that's one of my favorite lines

2232
03:59:57,120 --> 04:00:01,860
So your mama let you come out and play today. Why is that guy a quick draw fast McGraw?

2233
04:00:02,440 --> 04:00:04,440
That doesn't make any sense

2234
04:00:07,549 --> 04:00:09,549
I have no idea what this guy just said

2235
04:00:10,110 --> 04:00:14,350
Target time. Yeah, this could be imagine trying to get the fastest record in the world here

2236
04:00:21,379 --> 04:00:23,379
Oh, there's a mattress right

2237
04:00:24,379 --> 04:00:27,579
You see that mattress behind her that's like a stunt mattress I

2238
04:00:30,180 --> 04:00:34,799
Love it. I'm glad you fell on that stunt mattress inside of a saloon

2239
04:00:36,959 --> 04:00:47,680
Are you sure it out of his hand? I forgot about that one. That was a channel meme five six seven years ago for a long time

2240
04:00:48,180 --> 04:00:55,250
You can't tell oh, yes, the gun and then shoot

2241
04:00:57,950 --> 04:01:08,639
Come on now wasn't that a sub sound for a while that it was wasn't it? Yeah, it was

2242
04:01:10,969 --> 04:01:12,809
moving on

2243
04:01:12,809 --> 04:01:17,850
Get up and walk around after a 50 plus foot jump right there when he fought me

2244
04:01:17,850 --> 04:01:22,950
You're in from behind. They're not even coming out in the right order. This is supposed to be a gauntlet match

2245
04:01:22,950 --> 04:01:27,409
They're not even coming out in the right order. It's supposed to be one after the other. What are they doing? What triggered this?

2246
04:01:27,409 --> 04:01:30,809
I seriously don't it was such a pain in the ass to edit

2247
04:01:31,329 --> 04:01:34,969
Santa Claus has been under that ring for probably like three hours, by the way

2248
04:01:34,969 --> 04:01:40,809
Meanwhile grandpa not paying any attention to who's behind him. That's bad boy with a clothesline

2249
04:01:41,370 --> 04:01:45,010
He's supposed to be dead bad boy is supposed to be dead right now

2250
04:01:45,010 --> 04:01:49,170
But for some reason he just snuck up behind him is even supposed to be in this he's not

2251
04:01:50,129 --> 04:01:53,190
Everybody that is supposed to be a combatant in this gauntlet

2252
04:01:53,190 --> 04:01:57,750
It's over on the left side this is back when and bad boy is in the ring does yeah

2253
04:01:59,649 --> 04:02:02,610
So back the after like 2013

2254
04:02:03,250 --> 04:02:08,459
It wasn't just a rumble. It was like oh, I want to do a bunch of matches and have a big storyline and

2255
04:02:10,379 --> 04:02:14,379
The thing about the old wrestling like WWE 2k14 2k13

2256
04:02:15,059 --> 04:02:20,659
You know the the good ones were before they've ruined everything and the game was a piece of absolute steaming fucking garbage

2257
04:02:21,690 --> 04:02:26,809
So before that you could there was like these little like clip mode

2258
04:02:27,030 --> 04:02:36,620
Well, you could put wrestlers in and make a little scene and you could create and craft these weird rants

2259
04:02:36,620 --> 04:02:38,620
It was it was like the movies

2260
04:02:38,620 --> 04:02:40,059
Where it's like here's a scenario

2261
04:02:40,059 --> 04:02:45,739
Who do you want to be as it's like two like mannequins are standing in and you can just make up your own little storylines

2262
04:02:45,739 --> 04:02:47,739
they were like dozens and dozens of clips and

2263
04:02:49,700 --> 04:02:55,760
Then they made it a sports simulation Madden game that we just update the roster and the game breaks half the time

2264
04:02:57,350 --> 04:02:59,350
It was so good

2265
04:03:04,319 --> 04:03:08,079
It was awesome that half of the clips that you see in these all germa rumble videos

2266
04:03:09,079 --> 04:03:11,079
Were sort of string together

2267
04:03:11,879 --> 04:03:19,200
In that weird sort of puzzle of putting a little scene together and I would cut it and I would put it into the actual match

2268
04:03:21,620 --> 04:03:26,530
See like but they were just wrestling but you are this was

2269
04:03:31,290 --> 04:03:34,809
This was not just part of the match like I had to go in and piece this together

2270
04:03:34,809 --> 04:03:38,809
It was so much fun to do

2271
04:03:42,489 --> 04:03:44,489
And then they got rid of it

2272
04:03:45,930 --> 04:03:51,200
The new one coming out I am gonna hold my breath completely

2273
04:04:08,489 --> 04:04:10,860
Oh, yeah, that's what I was huge

2274
04:04:10,940 --> 04:04:16,149
This is still going on. This is still going on backstage. They're still beating the shit

2275
04:04:18,149 --> 04:04:19,680
I

2276
04:04:19,680 --> 04:04:26,020
I'm gonna hold my breath on any new wrestling game that comes out cuz I feel like they've lost their way completely across every single

2277
04:04:26,260 --> 04:04:32,239
Piece of media from the shit that's on TV from the shit that you play in in your home on your console

2278
04:04:32,319 --> 04:04:34,319
They've lost their way 100%

2279
04:04:34,760 --> 04:04:38,680
Some of these new organizations are starting to try to be a little bit more fun and interesting

2280
04:04:39,040 --> 04:04:46,350
But no, no, it's it's I'm gonna hold my breath you go back to the way that like kind of they used to do

2281
04:04:46,350 --> 04:04:48,350
This shit back in like 2013 2012

2282
04:04:49,280 --> 04:04:52,420
2014 I know that the company that used to work on these games

2283
04:04:53,040 --> 04:04:57,860
Split off right was it a AKI? Whatever was what's the name of the company?

2284
04:04:57,899 --> 04:05:04,139
they said we keep making the same fucking game over and over again and

2285
04:05:05,909 --> 04:05:13,229
It's youks. Yeah, you okay. I was the other company that worked on it, right? They made like a statement saying hey

2286
04:05:13,270 --> 04:05:18,469
We're gonna make our own wrestling game we think because we just keep doing the same shit with these WWE games

2287
04:05:18,469 --> 04:05:21,940
I have such high hopes, but I don't want to have like it

2288
04:05:21,940 --> 04:05:31,069
I'm holding my breath again that they're gonna bring this kind of crazy shit back and yet THQ everybody gave shit to THQ

2289
04:05:31,069 --> 04:05:35,579
But man, wasn't that kind of like a turning point when THQ went away?

2290
04:05:35,579 --> 04:05:43,020
I feel like we lost a lot of kind of really wacky creative fun shit that that that studio was doing

2291
04:05:43,020 --> 04:05:49,700
The people give a lot of shit to THQ. Ah, the games are fucking terrible. They're like sevens out of ten six out of ten

2292
04:05:49,700 --> 04:05:56,620
They're like kind of shitty and dumb. I look back at the catalogue the THQ had it was pretty phenomenal

2293
04:05:56,620 --> 04:06:05,250
And I even remember being one of these people that's like, oh THQ when I business whatever who cares

2294
04:06:05,250 --> 04:06:07,319
I guess they were they were okay

2295
04:06:07,319 --> 04:06:13,010
What if you actually go back to see the influence that they had on the industry and all the stuff that stuff that they were

2296
04:06:13,010 --> 04:06:21,540
Making holy fuck they had a lot to do with a why shit was even people were even to have been making fun games in

2297
04:06:21,540 --> 04:06:35,299
The first place it was one of the last remaining double-a studios. Yeah, I wish they would make a revival

2298
04:06:35,340 --> 04:06:43,479
I wish like somebody would buy them and just let them kind of go again. It was kind of like a weird THQ Nordic is

2299
04:06:44,200 --> 04:06:51,870
Making a comeback. Yeah, I hope so. It's the new revival. What are they making? What are they working on?

2300
04:06:51,870 --> 04:07:08,059
They're doing time splitters three destroy all humans. Yeah, I hope so because they would just really creative funny things and fun stuff

2301
04:07:08,979 --> 04:07:16,840
Look, we've kind of gotten into this mode in video games now where I think a lot of these companies are taking themselves way too seriously

2302
04:07:17,159 --> 04:07:24,430
Like everything's being taken way too seriously. It's got to be like this. It has to be like this. It's got to get done

2303
04:07:24,469 --> 04:07:30,930
It's got to be like I I kind of miss like when devs kind of just fucked around and made fun shit for because they

2304
04:07:30,930 --> 04:07:41,340
Wanted to the indie scene is still doing that right? But it's almost like this just to it's like indie games and just triple-a games

2305
04:07:41,340 --> 04:07:52,620
Right. It's like we lost that double-a kind of mentality. Hope it comes back. Anyways, let's press the button again

2306
04:07:52,620 --> 04:08:06,340
How can you say the double-a studios don't exist when game Freak still makes Pokemon?

2307
04:08:06,340 --> 04:08:11,209
I have it Pokemon is like a mmm a monster property owned by Nintendo

2308
04:08:11,489 --> 04:08:17,299
I I mean, I can't speak to oh that was an insult. Oh, okay. That was an insult

2309
04:08:19,479 --> 04:08:25,219
That was insulting. I get it. Okay, we're gonna click the button

2310
04:08:37,700 --> 04:08:40,250
Here if you think that that's like stupid

2311
04:08:41,600 --> 04:08:46,200
That's like a book and one of the most catchiest songs I've ever heard in my life. What is so I'm sorry

2312
04:08:46,920 --> 04:08:50,180
What song I need to know

2313
04:08:59,049 --> 04:09:14,729
What's the song I don't care enough to tell you that aren't you curious on Super Mario RPG legend of the seven stars Oh

2314
04:09:15,170 --> 04:09:27,299
Based of course my kind of music based absolutely 100% based. We have to actually feed the fire

2315
04:09:27,540 --> 04:09:36,260
All right open. Okay, the oven needs to reach the optimal temperature

2316
04:09:36,780 --> 04:09:43,020
I'm glad we did this again the thermometer on the left side of the oven as time progresses

2317
04:09:43,020 --> 04:09:46,500
The oven will slowly run out of fuel make sure to add logs from time to time keep fire

2318
04:09:46,500 --> 04:09:54,979
I'll just a Pete the pizza one right get in there to do it again. All right, get it in the green

2319
04:09:55,840 --> 04:10:03,979
Yeah, I want enough time to pass where we don't overdo it though a wood-fired pizza. Yeah, that's the best again

2320
04:10:04,180 --> 04:10:07,510
You will come with shibby

2321
04:10:07,950 --> 04:10:09,950
2142

2322
04:10:10,469 --> 04:10:15,850
Yeah, it's kind of rolling through by the way, let me just tell you this right now. I remember this video

2323
04:10:15,850 --> 04:10:21,450
Let's go take that last point. I remember this specifically and you know why I remember this specifically because this was like a holy shit

2324
04:10:21,450 --> 04:10:29,569
This is a big deal shibby. This is back when I had like 500 subs on YouTube actually 2010 2011

2325
04:10:29,569 --> 04:10:37,780

2326
04:10:37,780 --> 04:10:39,600
He was like, hey, man, we should do a video sometime

2327
04:10:39,600 --> 04:10:44,700
I looked at his channel and I was like like holy shit this guy this guy this is a god

Yeah, oh sure. Let's we'll make video should be then went on to work at machinima

And then he started working at other companies and he's like in the industry now

2331

I was he was always like really supportive of like the channel even when he moved on to kind of do the stuff like in

2334
04:11:20,549 --> 04:11:24,010

Damn, and by the way, I'm nervous in this video. I'm like, holy fuck. I better be funny and good

This is before they did an update with a demo man got new items guys

2345
04:12:16,579 --> 04:12:20,290
The demo man didn't have new stuff to play with this is just the game

2346
04:12:29,219 --> 04:12:33,430
Not true, I think I don't remember the demo man had a new item stop he's trying to move it up here

2347
04:12:33,909 --> 04:12:35,909
If they was it was only like one or two

2348
04:12:36,989 --> 04:12:38,989
Have the oh

2349
04:12:39,549 --> 04:12:41,549
Probably was only like three items battle. Oh

2350
04:12:44,579 --> 04:12:46,579
Teleporter and centuries down. Oh

2351
04:12:46,780 --> 04:12:51,819
What's the point of me getting?

2352
04:12:51,819 --> 04:12:57,959
D I remember this this game is awful inventory sticky spamming in a pub

2353
04:12:58,520 --> 04:13:00,600
That that just scared the shit out of me

2354
04:13:01,459 --> 04:13:06,540
Did you left the menu sound scared the fuck out of me? This is look I can't even see what's going on

2355
04:13:06,540 --> 04:13:17,620
I look like I feel like I'm shit-faced watching an old CRT TV with one eye open a button a minute

2356
04:13:17,860 --> 04:13:21,739
Gliding down

2357
04:13:24,379 --> 04:13:26,059
This is the last one whatever it is

2358
04:13:26,059 --> 04:13:28,139
We're going out on it play it really at all

2359
04:13:28,139 --> 04:13:31,010
But kind of a little bit because we're gonna talk about something today

2360
04:13:31,250 --> 04:13:35,290
That I noticed and it's when you notice these things that you start to go

2361
04:13:35,290 --> 04:13:39,690
Why the hell am I doing that and it freaks you out because you start thinking about it every time you do it

2362
04:13:39,690 --> 04:13:42,049
What I'm talking about what is it weird?

2363
04:13:42,729 --> 04:13:49,209
Obsessive compulsive habits that we have when we play video games. Oh, no, it doesn't have to be just team fortress, too

2364
04:13:49,209 --> 04:13:55,450
It doesn't have to be just an MMO or an action game. This is across the board. It's just a different quirk

2365
04:13:55,450 --> 04:14:00,030
It's just a different compulsive thing gone for anything. Yeah, I know. Ooh

2366
04:14:00,790 --> 04:14:07,950
This game was a this is awesome. I loved this game

2367
04:14:10,530 --> 04:14:17,489
No, I did it again the rock is back in Ohio I keep doing that I keep telling you exactly where I'm standing

2368
04:14:17,489 --> 04:14:23,799
It was just one hit kill only rail gun. It was so much fun me. Okay, good

2369
04:14:25,360 --> 04:14:27,600
Give

2370
04:14:30,340 --> 04:14:32,219
Bring this back

2371
04:14:32,219 --> 04:14:36,100
Bring this game back. Don't you believe it? I've got a hacker on the server

2372
04:14:36,100 --> 04:14:41,750
I mean, it's I mean this game was fucking unbelievable. I bring this back

2373
04:14:41,750 --> 04:14:44,870
I'm just gonna like focus up here new new twitch meta

2374
04:14:44,870 --> 04:14:48,899
You think I think it has an opportunity to be one hit the fucking pole

2375
04:14:48,899 --> 04:14:54,420
I hit the pole this really could be one of these kind of new meta twitch metas telling me

2376
04:14:55,579 --> 04:14:57,889
All right, hold on to this thought

2377
04:14:59,170 --> 04:15:03,930
As in the tournament type shit you do lead tournaments with this would be insane

2378
04:15:08,260 --> 04:15:11,379
I work on it my perspective. It looked like I hit you

2379
04:15:12,899 --> 04:15:15,620
You could do a kind of like a bunny hop rocket jump

2380
04:15:18,170 --> 04:15:23,110
Yeah, you're gonna pull that on me you're gonna pull a me on you you're gonna pull me on you

2381
04:15:23,110 --> 04:15:25,110
Gonna hit up Ludwig

2382
04:15:27,610 --> 04:15:34,969
Ludwig I've got another harebrained idea for you. It's called rats is to give get 40 people to fucking show up

2383
04:15:43,250 --> 04:15:48,059
All right last one whatever it is is it classic we're leaving on this

2384
04:15:57,739 --> 04:16:00,780
I know I realize it's Adam Sandler

2385
04:16:23,739 --> 04:16:25,739
And you use the site yeah

2386
04:16:28,120 --> 04:16:30,229
Nearly there

2387
04:16:31,190 --> 04:16:32,629
Now one more

2388
04:16:32,629 --> 04:16:37,809
No, this isn't a bad game. This is weird. I was just making a reference to the fact that all the recent Tony Hawk games

2389
04:16:37,809 --> 04:16:39,530
I've been fucking awful

2390
04:16:39,530 --> 04:16:41,090
What is this?

2391
04:16:41,090 --> 04:16:45,969
this game just is a thousand times more difficult than Tony skate 3 I

2392
04:16:47,579 --> 04:16:49,219
Didn't play this

2393
04:16:49,219 --> 04:16:56,260
Let's go back to the marker. I don't this is this is not even my video. I think this is wrong ramp

2394
04:16:56,260 --> 04:17:01,709
I don't I think the the ramp. All right, it's somebody else's stream. I think I don't think I have enough speed here

2395
04:17:02,430 --> 04:17:07,979
Let's do a pump. Yeah, this is not even my didn't stream this

2396
04:17:15,750 --> 04:17:19,709
This is what okay for all the new viewers this was considered one of the worst streams I've ever done

2397
04:17:24,100 --> 04:17:25,459
Okay, I

2398
04:17:25,459 --> 04:17:31,420
Spent how long is this two hours and 32 minutes and it's just me being bad and talking about how the game sucks and

2399
04:17:33,170 --> 04:17:38,530
Skate 3 is considered one of the greatest skate simulators ever made and I was so salty

2400
04:17:38,889 --> 04:17:41,209
The controls sucked and the game was fucking awful and shit

2401
04:17:41,329 --> 04:17:47,780
Yeah, this is this is one of the worst streams I've ever done putting myself in a really stupid awkward position

2402
04:17:47,780 --> 04:17:50,420
Let's find it only because I wouldn't want demon days to

2403
04:17:51,139 --> 04:18:01,500
Let's find it. I'll own it press a press F and then fucking things to do

2404
04:18:02,079 --> 04:18:08,450
Even days is a good album. Why can I just never have any responsibilities and just play skate and learn how to play it and do good

2405
04:18:09,209 --> 04:18:11,209
He beat me up

2406
04:18:13,299 --> 04:18:16,120
Well

2407
04:18:16,920 --> 04:18:24,360
Jesus but yeah make that shit when do I am I like misremembering this don't I talk about how I hate this whole thing

2408
04:18:24,360 --> 04:18:29,219
And this game is a tutorial

2409
04:18:29,579 --> 04:18:35,469
All right, you gotta stop doing that man

2410
04:18:36,229 --> 04:18:38,409
Speed here. I don't

2411
04:18:38,690 --> 04:18:41,989

Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary

2453
04:22:22,139 --> 04:22:27,180
Meet me at the statue at 12 o'clock. Okay. I don't know what the statue is. I don't play this game

2454
04:22:27,180 --> 04:22:31,540
I don't play Call of Duty. I just like would want to think I did you were gonna beg what?

2455
04:22:37,420 --> 04:22:43,299
That's incredible or by the way Mario you have to do all the dirty that's I'm getting this trip down memory that's incredible or

2456
04:22:47,170 --> 04:22:49,170
Incredible orb was such a fucking awesome, dude

2457
04:22:49,170 --> 04:22:56,819
Because he can jump higher than Michael Jordan, I remember he wanted some funny here his listen to this he still streams, too

2458
04:22:56,819 --> 04:23:04,030
I gotta fucking like rate him. He's just he's from Sweden. So we just never stream at the same time

2459
04:23:05,030 --> 04:23:09,389
So here's thing about incredible orb. There's some tips a little nut tip, but here's some insight for you

2460
04:23:09,790 --> 04:23:17,469
Incredible orb is the only person is one of two people that I have met through like YouTube and like content creation

2461
04:23:17,469 --> 04:23:29,860
That's ever met my parents nice machinima shirt. Yeah, I literally have nothing but like swell things to say about incredible orb

2462
04:23:29,899 --> 04:23:45,840
I just like was just a class act and I'm sure still is take it home. Remember. This is cute

2463
04:23:49,209 --> 04:23:56,309
He just ran a bunch of marathons. Yeah

2464
04:23:56,870 --> 04:23:59,739
He see he kept doing the healthy shit

2465
04:23:59,739 --> 04:24:06,319
I remember us having conversations about all lifting and being healthy and like working out and I turned into like fucking like an

2466
04:24:06,760 --> 04:24:16,770
Insect person I turned to like a bug. I turned to like a big fat like beetle person and he's out here running marathons

2467
04:24:16,969 --> 04:24:22,459
No, good. That's good

2468
04:24:25,659 --> 04:24:27,659
The sway the sway

2469
04:24:43,620 --> 04:24:46,700
I put a in my channel trailer for YouTube ten years ago

2470
04:24:48,829 --> 04:24:55,989
Strafing that's just strafing case. You didn't know

2471
04:24:56,549 --> 04:25:02,219
Well you non gamers they don't know that pressing A and D makes you

2472
04:25:02,579 --> 04:25:06,059
Step left and right without needing to move your mouse

2473
04:25:06,059 --> 04:25:12,010
That was so important that I make sure everybody knows that I thought I was such a brilliant

2474
04:25:12,889 --> 04:25:22,670
Smart motherfucker. I thought I was so goddamn gifted that was in the the four minutes of real estate of

2475
04:25:23,069 --> 04:25:29,389
Small amount of real estate that I had to show you to make sure you knew I was a gamer and it worked

2476
04:25:29,389 --> 04:25:33,379
I was good

2477
04:25:33,379 --> 04:25:34,379
also

2478
04:25:34,379 --> 04:25:38,180
Put smite in the channel trailer cuz I thought I was gonna play it every day and it was gonna be my new game

2479
04:25:56,090 --> 04:25:59,809
I think this burger boy in this and I think he's Matt. Yeah, he misses the table

2480
04:25:59,809 --> 04:26:04,149
Best players in the world and I'll show you right here. Look at this. Get the fuck out of here

2481
04:26:06,700 --> 04:26:14,100
Grandpa there is the whole time turn it up turn it up. Yeah burger boys in this video

2482
04:26:17,290 --> 04:26:21,889
All right, let's go tell yourself it's possible and you have to act on those possibilities

2483
04:26:28,860 --> 04:26:33,579
Okay, so they did on the burger boy there's a video of my channel burger boy in a Twinkie eating contest and

2484
04:26:34,500 --> 04:26:36,500
He there was a little

2485
04:26:36,979 --> 04:26:46,059
Okay, there's some context so burger boy and exoskeleton bug Millennium boy two different people by the way

2486
04:26:46,479 --> 04:26:49,719
they did a Twinkie contest for 15,000 subs on the channel and

2487
04:26:51,120 --> 04:26:54,340
Burger boy one is a disgusting video. I don't even know why it's still uploaded

2488
04:26:55,079 --> 04:26:59,079
so after the videos over I it's a burger boys the champion and

2489
04:27:00,659 --> 04:27:06,500
There's like maybe like four or five Twinkies that are left that he didn't eat and he went to swing his hand down to smash

2490
04:27:06,500 --> 04:27:15,319
Them and it's like a hard just like granite countertop. He misses the Twinkies and smash you see smashes his fucking hand

2491
04:27:16,120 --> 04:27:27,860

04:28:49,989 --> 04:28:55,340

Timestamps of random videos is available for anyone to use we have somebody can please link the website everybody

2509
04:29:05,010 --> 04:29:09,290
I thank lazy Luke lazy Luke is the one responsible for putting this together

2510
04:29:11,149 --> 04:29:17,930
Just like he did last time also did it this time updated it gave a few more control panel things lazy Luke

2516
04:30:03,510 --> 04:30:11,790
You can't all go do it at once if everybody goes it does at the same time. Oh, that's why the credits don't work

2517
04:30:13,819 --> 04:30:23,520
Because the credits are linked to the same web server. I think oh oops well you guys broke it well shit
