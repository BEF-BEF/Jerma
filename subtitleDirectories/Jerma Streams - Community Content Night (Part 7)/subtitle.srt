00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:18,649
Hello. He's early, he's right on time. Welcome back everybody to this community content catch-up stream.

2
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:29,030
And I'm not talking about the red stuff. I still got it after like five days. We have a lot to

3
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:35,530
talk about today and a lot of it is going to be stuff that I don't want to say and it's going

4
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:41,429
to be also stuff that you don't want to hear. So it's going to be great for both of us but both

5
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:48,329
parties are going to be real happy about this. He's retiring and I've decided that that is it.

6
00:00:49,750 --> 00:01:03,659
I broke tits too much and I'm done. Over the last week, well five days or four days,

7
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:12,019
whatever you want to call it. I've been having an internal conflict that was constant to decide

8
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:19,060
what I was going to do. I had an appointment with my doctor and people were saying plus two.

9
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,980
This is not a joke. Like I'm about to like really drop. I'm about to drop like a fucking

10
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,140
you guys not going to be happy. This is not like oh here comes the fucking punch line.

11
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:33,030
Okay I gotta I gotta relax. Here comes the punch line.

12
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:46,329
No comedy. What you're about to hear is what I'm going to call a band-aid rip.

13
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:51,609
It's going to get it's going to get long-winded. So I hope you have time.

14
00:01:53,109 --> 00:02:02,920
Uh those of you that don't know over the last couple of years I've had mystery pain

15
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,340
that runs down the middle of my chest around to the side and down the sides of my spine.

16
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:20,039
I have been told oh you probably have intercostal nerve damage. Oh you probably have costochondritis.

17
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,560
Well you know you might have rheumatoid arthritis. That that test came back positive

18
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:35,400
and I've had to kind of slowly over the last two years try to figure the fuck figure this shit out

19
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,159
and find out what the fuck's going on and kind of keep my regular life going too. But I have

20
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:46,360
to be honest with you because I hope I hope I am you know 95 percent of things I say in this

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,180
channel are lies. So I hope you know that I'm honest with you all the time. I've been operating

22
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:00,409
at probably like a 70 percentile in two years and it became abundantly fucking clear

23
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:11,219
over the last week or two that I have to figure this out and I have to focus on it and I have to

24
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:18,310
make it an immediate concern because after the green screen stream and I talked to my doctor

25
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:27,800
he's just sitting there he was like okay because I was fucking dead bad and we kind of came up with

26
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,259
a treatment plan or instead of hey maybe like once every two months you can come in you'll go

27
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:40,789
hey oh we have you scheduled for an MRI. No I'll see you in like a month. I'm gonna take the next

28
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:48,379
like two or three weeks and 100 percent only focus on this with me and my doctor. That means

29
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:55,099
procedures he might want to do tests he might want to do and get actually definitively truly diagnosed

30
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,610
but whatever the fuck is going on because you guys don't know

31
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:08,389
I it's just been driving me crazy like I'm gonna just lay it I'm laying it all out in front of you

32
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:19,589
it's been driving me fucking crazy and I don't want it to start negatively affecting the streams

33
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:31,060
when I turn the stream on I have fun and this this stream is seriously like such a positive outlet

34
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,990
for me and I'm not talking about like all positivity no no I'm talking about like just

35
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:41,370
I get to come out here and we and fucking have a bunch of fun I have to think about this stupid

36
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,779
shit now yeah sometimes it gets in the way because when you have when you have to start to wear a

37
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:51,980
fucking back brace to sit down on a chair I think it's probably time that you like go figure this

38
00:04:51,980 --> 00:05:02,899
shit out right and I've been oh maybe I'll stream three four hours a day no I'm just going to take

39
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:09,459
the fucking time and I'm just gonna I'm going off the grid for like two to three weeks and we're

40
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:14,259
just gonna hammer this out and get treated because I haven't been treated for it that's the worst

41
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:21,449
thing I went to physical therapy and the physical therapist told me he looked me right in the eyes

42
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:27,160
and he said I don't think this is gonna work for you I'm just like what the fuck are you talking

43
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,540
about he's like well if you have nerve damage or nerve pain if you have like an intercostal nerve

44
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:44,579
problem I can't help you I'm just like oh all right invest in a mecha spine I if I could but

45
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:51,339
it but it's not my spine and that's the problem it's like kind of going back and forth for like

46
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:58,060
years where every couple months I do another test it's like well no you don't have any spinal

47
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:04,120
disc problems okay well you're still fucking everything everything still hurts oh I see you

48
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,139
two months I'm not gonna I'm just ripping the band-aid off because I want to just start to

49
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:15,540
figure the fuck this shit out it could be something so easy or it could be something that's very

50
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:22,629
complicated I just need to know and I want to get it done and so does my doctor now here is

51
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:31,699
here is the plan I want it to wait and by the way we're streaming today like I'm not going to

52
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,779
turn that I didn't want to talk about I didn't want to do like a hey here I'm going to make a

53
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:40,339
tweet here's like 10 characters describing how I'm not going to be around and my back hurts

54
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:44,339
now I wanted to stream today talk about it today we're going to do community content today

55
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:54,459
there's a lot of stuff to catch up I'm going to hang out we're going to chill but because of my

56
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:59,060
absence that is about to happen this has been something's been worked on for a couple weeks

57
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:08,170
the second channel I'm pleased to announce is bringing on I think four new editors I have

58
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:14,490
brought on a third party to really make that process easier there are now six fucking editors

59
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,449
I believe for the second channel the backlog is going to get wiped the fuck out there's going

60
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:27,689
to be a ton of new content probably every single day depending how long it takes I'm not sure how

61
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:34,810
long it will be but we have brought on at least in a temporary sense a bunch of people to help

62
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,139
really smash through that content so although you won't be seeing my face on stream over the next

63
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:51,579
two or three weeks you'll the second channel is going to be ripe with fresh fruits I want to make

64
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:58,220
sure that was available and also on top of that there are some much larger projects that have just

65
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,819
got barely got off the ground are just starting to happen just starting to be talked about

66
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,680
and I want I got I got to get healthy if I want to do the shit that I want to do over the summertime

67
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,600
here at the end of like the late summer early fall I got I can't just I gotta get this shit

68
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:24,579
done I gotta just rip the fucking band-aid off let's go in a long time coming so I wanted to

69
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:30,579
tell you I didn't I didn't want to text it to you I wanted to tell it to you behind the computer

70
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:45,769
screen real life house flipper yeah there's a lot that's happening I've talked to my doctor I've

71
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:50,570
talked to my my producer my friend that's really been brought on board to help with a lot of this

72
00:08:51,879 --> 00:09:01,450
I want to hit this shit hard and I can't do that right now so I'm gonna just go off the grid for a

73
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:09,500
few weeks this is all I'm gonna focus on and when I come back you I will have been at least told

74
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,220
definitively what my real treatment plan is gonna do for whatever this is and like I said it could

75
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,909
be so simple it could be so easy like this could go away in a week if I get it figured out but I

76
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:25,750
don't want to have it negatively affect I don't get long-winded here and a lot of money's coming

77
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,500
in right now and I want to address it but I also want to address this before I do that that I this

78
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,659
is I'm gonna be just fine I've I don't worry about me don't worry about financially don't worry about

79
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:42,700
giving me a bunch of money and shit don't it's not necessary don't do it it's completely unnecessary

80
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:50,490
even though you are a lot of you are it's don't worry about it I'm just fine financially I'm just

81
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,409
I'm just fine mentally I'm just I'm just not so quite fine physically

82
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:16,500
right don't worry give him money not so money god damn it no but we're gonna move on I want to

83
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:25,019
take the first like 10 to 20 minutes or so here to really talk about this and I I I don't want

84
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,580
this to turn into because this is when I first I hate talking about medical shit I hate talking

85
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,460
because then it's just like oh well something's really wrong with him now oh no it's oh I told

86
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,419
you guys I told you guys that he's wicked fucked up it's like no I I just wanted to I just gotta

87
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:45,450
get this taken care of I know and it doesn't matter what I say because I know there's gonna

88
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:51,049
be people they're gonna be like well here's what I think it is going by by uh by degree in fucking

89
00:10:51,049 --> 00:11:04,659
neuroscience I think he's got three weeks to live I don't worry don't do that like I don't want to

90
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:10,659
see like reddit threads over the next two or three weeks going over like well you know I did notice

91
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:15,700
that he had a little bit of a limp on his right shoulder there in this from two from six or seven

92
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:23,799
months ago I I'm telling you I think I know what it is uh-oh no it's it's completely unnecessary

93
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:32,500
but community content night we got a lot of artwork we've got reddit doctors

94
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:45,429
my I'm on a strict no comedy diet so anytime you hear me laugh it's gonna sound really weird

95
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:49,590
I'm gonna be very very cautious about laughing it's gonna be like

96
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:57,929
I told you I was sitting there I was lying down and I saw and I'll just spoil it because it's

97
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:06,330
fucking hilarious somebody took the dinosaur walking with the Thor's hammer thing and then

98
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:12,980
and they knew how much I love baseball and they made the dinosaur just hit a like a baseball

99
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:17,960
instead that's not what I would and it like came back and hit me in the face

100
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,659
it was just I I gotta take a comedy vacation and not even like a medical leave or whatever

101
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:31,110
you want to call it but I know that you guys understand and I don't have to talk about it

102
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,960
anymore I just I don't get long-winded on it and I know I take a lot I take breaks on this channel

103
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:48,039
just like last month I was gone for like two weeks I know I don't mean to do that but sometimes

104
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,000
they're completely necessary and this is one of those times that I have to do it

105
00:12:52,039 --> 00:13:02,009
and that's though that's all I'm gonna say so let's go through how many people have just given

129
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:43,820
over this really really put the point across a bunch of times second channel is gonna have

130
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:49,500
a shitload of content bunch of new editors bunch of new stuff I am going to be gone for a little

131
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:58,440
while but I'll be back hey what do you say we do some of the artwork this is community content

132
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,019
night and we're gonna go over community content oh by the way a lot of people probably were

133
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,179
what's gonna happen with the green screen stuff so instead of just dumping all of this on the end

134
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:16,299
of the another community content night when I come back no there's going to be a another green

135
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:23,190
screen just night where we just do green screen stuff otherwise there's going to be hundreds of

136
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:30,039
videos just dumped right on the end of a community content night so the idea is every time a dlc

137
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:35,240
every time a little green screen dlc pack comes out I don't know why I'm phrasing it that way

138
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,759
but you know what I mean we will do a night where we just do a bunch of them with rules right like

139
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,559
the last couple times and then that footage is just available for you to put into any community

the iphone x no you don't why dude do you know the rtx 2100 is coming out now okay cool you just

319
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,659
you bought the rtx last year don't buy another graphics card for like five years you're fine

320
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:49,769
but you want to run like crisis on every monitor in your house who cares 1080 works just fine

321
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:59,670
you can you can have 1080 and get very fine graphics and like at least 100 fps on like

322
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:03,190
almost every game you play now i know people are gonna argue this here and they're gonna go

775
02:08:53,689 --> 02:08:59,060
it wouldn't even take that much i want to do like a it's like a sports thing where it's like the

776
02:08:59,060 --> 02:09:03,300
clowns like versus the dinosaurs you know what i mean it's like a baseball game and it's and it's

777
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:12,939
just it's just a baseball game and they just play baseball like the clowns like take like rabbits

778
02:09:12,939 --> 02:09:18,859
out of hats and shouldn't like like before pitches and the dinosaurs like roar and hit home runs

779
02:09:18,859 --> 02:09:27,880
it's but it's just a regular game of baseball there's nothing there that's wow that's really

780
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:37,640
interesting no they just play baseball i'd like want to watch it one day yeah like yeah it would

781
02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:46,550

782
02:09:47,109 --> 02:10:00,069
it sounds like fun we got more like he's not already a millionaire okay let me just let me

783
02:10:00,069 --> 02:10:05,189
ask you this how much do you think it costs to rent out a major league baseball stadium

784
02:10:05,829 --> 02:10:16,840
for a day how much do you think that is how much do you think that costs that's a whole net worth

785
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:25,510
of gone in two minutes it's like 100k it's probably like a million it's probably like 50 to 100k

786
02:10:30,649 --> 02:10:41,670
minor league maybe 20 30k maybe but then you can hire nine clowns and nine dinosaurs

787
02:10:42,390 --> 02:10:50,140
and they have to be competent in baseball i have to hire players to play well i can't just what

788
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:56,060
am i not gonna hire like 30 people to play and the clowns have to have like powers you know

789
02:10:56,060 --> 02:11:00,460
if you guys have like special powers i want essentially i want to make mario baseball a

790
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:04,939
reality where like the clown like winds up and like two other clowns run behind him and they

791
02:11:04,939 --> 02:11:10,060

1050
03:01:03,180 --> 03:01:08,219

1051
03:01:08,219 --> 03:01:11,739
the other person just doesn't think you're insane and losing your mind that you're just silent

1052
03:01:11,739 --> 03:01:17,579
so you just say words while you do something else entirely and hope that you're sounding not like a

1053
03:01:17,579 --> 03:01:22,459
fucking moron while you talk and then they pick up on it like what what do you what does it have to

1054
03:01:22,459 --> 03:01:29,159

1164
03:24:49,610 --> 03:24:54,540
go back and watch any of that shit it became very clear over the last like four or five days after

1165
03:24:54,540 --> 03:25:00,700
the green screen stuff that i have to get this figured out and i have to whether it's do some

1166
03:25:00,700 --> 03:25:07,500
kind of procedure where i get an injection into a nerve or i can be going back and forth with my

1167
03:25:07,500 --> 03:25:12,219
doctor about some things that we want to try so the next couple of weeks i'm just going to be

1217
03:34:35,899 --> 03:35:11,690
we're going to do five nights at freddy's this is the right video okay it's like 200 people made

1218
03:35:11,690 --> 03:35:51,159
this first thing first one skip wait grab a snack step so we'll make it so 200 different people

1219
03:35:52,620 --> 03:35:54,940
made all of it or just like pieces of it

1220
03:35:56,059 --> 03:36:07,059
so what did each person make a like an image or like a finally the only thing left to be done

1221
03:36:07,059 --> 03:36:12,260
is to capture the essential pieces of data from your counterpart everyone contributed every point

1222
03:36:13,059 --> 03:36:22,420
my hyper metal sonic when you awaken kill him wait that's actually like a marionette

1223
03:36:23,620 --> 03:36:48,010
the remake of the movie i don't think that's true each person made one thing wait it's a this is a

1224
03:36:48,010 --> 03:36:52,489
remake of the original i don't know anything about song the hedgehog all i know is i made that in

1225
03:36:52,489 --> 03:37:05,270
dreams like a year ago that was exactly my inspiration i had nothing to do with this

1226
03:37:09,299 --> 03:37:21,559
very pretty the 90s sonic ova oh see isn't it great the jet propelled bodyboard

1227
03:37:21,559 --> 03:37:27,110
but you want to try it out oh i i get it i get i see what's happening i'll go use it myself

1228
03:37:27,110 --> 03:37:51,530
oh sure i see what i see this is crazy little kid with his new toy so this is the whole movie

1229
03:37:52,250 --> 03:38:17,430
i feel like i'm watching an episode of gumball this is crazy that's the best my favorite one

1230
03:38:18,459 --> 03:38:31,399
that's the best one that one that was perfect i did the same thing with the shrek movie

1231
03:38:40,659 --> 03:38:50,540
are you all right i'm fine just fine so who's that i shot it i have some news for you

1232
03:38:51,739 --> 03:38:56,459
i guess so gee i hope the president and sarah are doing all right

1233
03:39:14,170 --> 03:39:20,170
just give us 100 times i'll stop being your hostage all right started again this is the i

1234
03:39:21,610 --> 03:39:26,440
what the fuck good animation what the fuck good yeah there's 200 there's 200 people that worked on

1235
03:39:26,440 --> 03:39:49,000
this absolutely not you should do this how when i turn a stream on and every three seconds it's

1236
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:58,899
another artist depiction of the stream

1237
03:39:58,899 --> 03:40:02,340
that'd be pretty funny i think that's just that's the screen for like two hours

1238
03:40:03,219 --> 03:40:10,100
how does the movie end did i even show the ending

1239
03:40:14,969 --> 03:40:29,420
rat movie rebuilt every 10 minutes of a different streamer be you that's so funny

1240
03:40:30,139 --> 03:40:45,670
oh this is pretty sick skip it i told you guys this is like live action sonic better enjoy his

1241
03:40:45,670 --> 03:40:51,829
victory now because once he gets to robotropolis he'll have to fight something far more evil than

1242
03:40:51,829 --> 03:40:58,950
metal robotnik what do you mean are you talking about yourself you better keep your hands off my

1243
03:40:58,950 --> 03:41:09,750
sonic or i'll never forgive you this is with a metal guy oh boy hold on what i was saying was

1244
03:41:10,469 --> 03:41:14,870
i had an idea a long time ago where i was going to pay somebody that looked like me

1245
03:41:16,180 --> 03:41:24,379
that was essentially a doppelganger stream for like two weeks straight and don't ever bring it up

1246
03:41:24,379 --> 03:41:30,139
don't even mention it and i kind of come in sometimes and i sit in behind them in a chair

1247
03:41:30,139 --> 03:41:35,659
for some streams and just teachers aid them you know like put notes down and be like no no no no

1248
03:41:35,659 --> 03:41:41,860
sorry it was look at me you gotta go you gotta do it right like i'm training the next

1249
03:41:41,860 --> 03:41:51,670
germa to take over and they they study the way that i talk and everything that i do

1250
03:41:52,229 --> 03:42:01,719
and they just try so hard to just be me for a week or two straight germa apprentice you have

1251
03:42:01,719 --> 03:42:08,870

1267
03:45:04,229 --> 03:45:08,309
with the doctor and i'm gonna get this shit settled and i'm gonna come back at 100

1268
03:45:10,790 --> 03:45:16,549
i've never tried to do like an extended break like this but it has to be done

1269
03:45:17,510 --> 03:45:22,760
it's long term there's a bunch of projects that i'm doing that i want to work on that i want to be

1270
03:45:22,760 --> 03:45:29,940
100 for and that's just all there is to it and it's it's really really difficult for somebody

1271
03:45:30,899 --> 03:45:35,780
like me that has been doing this and been around and cares about doing this shit so much

1272
03:45:36,659 --> 03:45:41,219
to be like i had to buy i'm gone and i don't know when i'm coming back a few weeks it's like

1273
03:45:43,579 --> 03:45:53,979
i hate to do that he's never coming back well that's what that's not true

1274
03:45:55,180 --> 03:46:01,819
not true uh i know it'll be fine and i'm just overthinking it like oh my god they're gonna

1275
03:46:01,819 --> 03:46:06,219
take like what if i'm not back for in like a month what if i have to get a procedure what if i have

1276
03:46:06,219 --> 03:46:10,700
to have like a surgery or something oh no i'm not going to be able to be live for like a month two

1277
03:46:10,700 --> 03:46:21,610
months like shit happens whatever so good i'll tweet more right i'll do more tweets uh just

1278
03:46:22,649 --> 03:46:29,930
it's been a hard call to to make because i knew it was coming eventually tonight we're going to

1279
03:46:29,930 --> 03:46:35,530
do the bits we'll hang up a little bit more uh thanks for watching and i will see you when i

1280
03:46:35,530 --> 03:46:42,860
get back at 100 100 on the 60 70 percent anymore none of them no more of this bullshit

1281
03:46:44,440 --> 03:46:50,409

1282
03:46:50,409 --> 03:47:04,780
and with that i will see you guys in a couple weeks i'm not going to put a time frame on it

1283
03:47:05,420 --> 03:47:14,700
because let's put it this way if this could i could figure this out in the next six or seven days

1284
03:47:17,129 --> 03:47:25,020
or two weeks or more so i would rather just say i'm gonna get this figured out

1285
03:47:25,659 --> 03:47:29,340
if it's less than a week it's less than a week if it's more than two weeks it's more than two

1286
03:47:29,340 --> 03:47:38,540
weeks and i don't know what it's gonna be so he is a different person i'm gonna come i'm gonna

1287
03:47:38,540 --> 03:47:42,379
come back as a different person i hope i come back as a more healthy person that'd be great

1288
03:47:43,180 --> 03:47:57,979
in the meantime i am gonna set up a auto host with just a big bunch of people that i think are

1289
03:47:57,979 --> 03:48:01,340
really really interesting that i think that i respect that i think are funny that i think are

1290
03:48:01,340 --> 03:48:09,719
cool i'm just gonna there'll be an auto host just for the next couple weeks of of my like streamer

1291
03:48:09,719 --> 03:48:19,459
list of people that you know for you to watch if you want to watch them but let's do the bits

1292
03:48:19,459 --> 03:48:30,860
let's go through these don't need to go very very fast but kind of just well we'll hang out

1293
03:48:30,860 --> 03:48:39,899
for a little while ribbiorrhea thanks for the 250 i hope things go well me too i also hope that

1294
03:48:39,899 --> 03:48:55,799
because it is in my best interest to make sure that it happens no more half diagnosis no more

1295
03:48:55,799 --> 03:49:02,180
half well it could be this we'll test you for that oh that looked like it was positive come back

1296
03:49:02,180 --> 03:49:05,459
some other time no no no no we've talked back and forth me and the doctor we're doing it now

1297
03:49:05,940 --> 03:49:14,420
now now now now now everything hey pixel mike thanks for the five dollars here i know full well

1298
03:49:14,420 --> 03:49:18,100
how scary it is for the doctor to flat out tell you i can't help you i've been bouncing around

1299
03:49:18,100 --> 03:49:22,340
doctors for about five years and they still can't really figure it out although i've improved

1300
03:49:22,340 --> 03:49:25,620
incredibly it's still so unnerving not really knowing what's wrong but i think taking three

1301
03:49:25,620 --> 03:49:35,420
weeks of recouping will really help i'm sorry to hear that you're also having bullshit to do

1302
03:49:35,420 --> 03:49:40,860
and when you have some kind of underlying problem and that's the thing i i have a lot of underlying

1303
03:49:40,860 --> 03:49:47,079
problems i've had colitis and i've been diagnosed with with irritable bowel disease

1304
03:49:47,719 --> 03:49:53,059
and i've been treated for that and i remember a time when i wasn't being treated for that

1305
03:49:53,059 --> 03:49:57,989
and it was miserable so i'm kind of putting myself back in that same

1306
03:49:59,350 --> 03:50:10,010
headspace where when i was not getting treated for colitis holy shit hurry the fuck up let's go

1307
03:50:10,010 --> 03:50:17,020
once i started to get on a regimen that is completely under control completely i have not

1308
03:50:17,020 --> 03:50:25,719
had a uh a irritable bowel disease issue i've not had a colitis issue for years since i got on the

1309
03:50:25,719 --> 03:50:34,389
right treatment plan absolutely no problems at all it's it's it's 100 managed so i'm hoping that

1310
03:50:34,389 --> 03:50:43,639
same thing can happen whatever is causing this issue it's just a question of finding it even if

1311
03:50:43,639 --> 03:50:49,590
it's some weird condition that is kind of hard to find i'm gonna find it that's what i'm gonna do

1312
03:50:53,000 --> 03:51:05,540
we'll see what is the issue to not completely broken record myself i have intercostal pain

1313
03:51:05,540 --> 03:51:13,829
nerves that run from my somewhere in the middle of my chest around my band to my back just around

1314
03:51:13,829 --> 03:51:21,299
my ribs hurts all day every day for no reason i didn't get into any accident i didn't have any

1315
03:51:21,299 --> 03:51:28,649
problems it just hurts to move it hurts to sit for a long time and it just hurts to kind of exist

1316
03:51:28,649 --> 03:51:35,139
there's no real cause and it's been the the the bane of my existence for the last probably

1317
03:51:35,139 --> 03:51:47,000
a year and a half it has never gotten better but it's never really gotten any worse so obviously

1318
03:51:47,000 --> 03:51:59,899
i need to figure this out and the latest is and it would make sense but i don't want to

1319
03:51:59,899 --> 03:52:13,030
self-diagnose or anything but this i had what was potentially shingles a few years ago and sometimes

1320
03:52:13,030 --> 03:52:19,260
if you have and remember this is not this is not me telling you this is what it is but this is

1321
03:52:19,260 --> 03:52:24,329
just one of the theories is that if you have shingles and shingles is a rash that goes around

1322
03:52:24,329 --> 03:52:32,229
your it goes down a nerve and there's a small chance if you have shingles that you end up

1323
03:52:32,229 --> 03:52:50,620
with permanent nerve damage it's a neuralgia is what it's called it's rare if it's not that

1324
03:52:51,000 --> 03:53:01,459
i also tested positive for potential rheumatoid arthritis so we're gonna explore that so it's i

1325
03:53:01,459 --> 03:53:11,049
don't know but you can test positive for ra i've been tested for it more than once to make sure

1326
03:53:11,049 --> 03:53:20,979
that we don't get a false positive but it also might just be costochondritis which is just

1327
03:53:20,979 --> 03:53:25,989
inflammation in your rib cage i've been that the doctor said that's probably what it is there's

1328
03:53:25,989 --> 03:53:31,700
been like three or four different opinions on what it could be but it's time to just be like

1329
03:53:31,700 --> 03:53:40,340
which one which one is it which one because if it's something like nerve pain

1330
03:53:40,340 --> 03:53:47,379
or costochondritis i go get a small slightly invasive procedure where they inject a needle

1331
03:53:47,379 --> 03:53:55,719
into my rib and kind of numb with steroids the nerve and they shut it up and then for some people

1332
03:53:55,719 --> 03:54:04,569
you are fucking fine for the rest of your life that has been one of the procedures that i was

1333
03:54:04,569 --> 03:54:10,309
about to do diagnosed you have costochondritis intercostal pain on nerves we're gonna shut the

1334
03:54:10,309 --> 03:54:18,819
nerve down and i said no because i wanted to be definitively diagnosed so i've got a couple more

1335
03:54:18,819 --> 03:54:26,340
opinions on it if it does turn out to be that i'm gonna do it and that will be what i do over the

1336
03:54:26,340 --> 03:54:43,030
next few weeks i'm just gonna get it done but like again i this is why i don't want to to to

1337
03:54:43,030 --> 03:54:49,059
i don't want to tell you guys all this stuff but i kind of have to because you don't just disappear

1338
03:54:49,059 --> 03:54:57,639
for three weeks without me giving you some kind of reasoning oh i have a pain and uh bye see you

1339
03:54:57,639 --> 03:55:08,950
next month no that doesn't work like that you guys you guys kind of need to know he's gonna come back

1340
03:55:08,950 --> 03:55:25,930
as jex yeah i'll i'll be all right it's just something i just don't want to have to deal with

1341
03:55:25,930 --> 03:55:29,450
anymore like like if you were here in the beginning of the stream i'm gonna parrot what i said after

1342
03:55:29,450 --> 03:55:38,500
the green screen dlc it was bad it was bad to a point where i just was kind of looking i was lying

1343
03:55:38,500 --> 03:55:45,420
on my floor just hanging out looking at the ceiling going this has got to stop i gotta get

1344
03:55:45,420 --> 03:55:52,739
this figured out and that's where i kind of had the flow to the ideas around to do it why did you

1345
03:55:52,739 --> 03:55:59,979
break dance because i was having fun i was having too much fun and that's all i cared about and i

1346
03:55:59,979 --> 03:56:07,100
would do it again if i had the chance right now it wasn't that though i did that in the first

1347
03:56:07,100 --> 03:56:21,350
20 minutes of that stream it was just a combination of actively moving around screwing me up because

1348
03:56:21,989 --> 03:56:26,899
there are other times that you guys don't see where i get up and i move around and i feel all

1349
03:56:26,899 --> 03:56:32,100
right but if i you know if i do anything that requires me to rotate it's like oh that fucking

1350
03:56:32,100 --> 03:56:38,979
hurts a lot like i bet well now i'm sore now i'm sore for the rest of the day now why so it's not

1351
03:56:38,979 --> 03:56:46,149
just all i must have done something on that stream this happens on a this is a daily occurrence and

1352
03:56:46,149 --> 03:56:51,270
i don't want to scare anybody i like oh my god monger ash oh shit he's gone what's happening is

1432
04:11:17,739 --> 04:11:23,610
anyone's comfortable giving it's that i want to make sure that you're paying for something

1433
04:11:23,610 --> 04:11:33,020
that's worth paying for it's always been like that so obviously anytime somebody gives a bunch

1434
04:11:33,020 --> 04:11:39,559
of money i don't want to make sure that you're able to do it too you're able to actually give

1435
04:11:39,559 --> 04:11:49,030
that kind of money because i know that a lot of people maybe can't so obviously it gets to that

1436
04:11:49,030 --> 04:11:55,459
point where i just want to make sure that you're doing fine too and not worrying about like money

1657
04:41:50,470 --> 04:41:56,220
the time you need to figure out what's going on we'll be here when you get back that's the plan

1658
04:41:56,220 --> 04:42:05,959
that's all they say paper is food gave 200 bucks at 20 000 bits 200 fucking dollars

1659
04:42:06,520 --> 04:42:13,220
that's a ton of money a year ago i started animating my thesis film so i can graduate

1660
04:42:13,220 --> 04:42:18,340
next week after four years with my bfa before i started production i knew that i was going to

1661
04:42:18,340 --> 04:42:24,340
need colorist plus music plus composition help but i also realized that i would need to budget

1662
04:42:24,340 --> 04:42:30,419
for the entertainment so here's your payment for entertaining me for the 12 to six hour days

1663
04:42:30,419 --> 04:42:37,099
while i animate my thesis since 2012 helped me make it to the end and now i have a film about

1664
04:42:37,099 --> 04:42:43,500
a strawberry ready for festivals stay healthy germa see you later you gotta have you're gonna

1665
04:42:43,500 --> 04:42:52,310
have to fill us in on what this is you if you're still around eventually let us know what it is

1666
04:42:52,310 --> 04:43:13,240
i'm curious now watch this clip vinnie wants to be friends with germa it'll even fucking load and

1667
04:43:14,200 --> 04:43:24,659
i always get really guilty about that because turn that off where's my audio like i said that

1668
04:43:24,659 --> 04:43:33,290
every other stream there we go and i always get really guilty about that because i like people

1669
04:43:34,009 --> 04:43:40,759
people like germa hey you know like for example i wish i had a better friendship with him

1670
04:43:41,720 --> 04:43:49,259
but i don't put the effort in and um only germa that's it one guy one guy but

1671
04:43:50,060 --> 04:43:55,430
you know and we we all get busy everyone gets busy but the point is like i got to

1672
04:43:58,580 --> 04:44:10,549
yeah i mean that's i feel that it's it's it's really really really easy to just kind of

1673
04:44:11,590 --> 04:44:18,470
just do your own thing and do shit and not really reach out like i do that i do it all the time i

1674
04:44:18,470 --> 04:44:21,750
know a lot of you guys know that i'm like i mostly do i'm a solo guy and i think then he's the same

1675
04:44:21,750 --> 04:44:27,080
way likes to do a lot of his stuff you know solo but you know you you can start to lose track

1676
04:44:38,659 --> 04:44:44,180
i've i've hung up with vinnie in real life he's a really really he's a great fucking person he's

1677
04:44:44,180 --> 04:44:52,439
a really good dude he is like he's exactly like how you think he is you know what i mean just like

1678
04:44:52,439 --> 04:45:04,099
the most chill dude the most like just he's exactly the way that you think he is he is he

1679
04:45:04,099 --> 04:45:09,159
tall than you no i've got at least two or three inches on him he's probably like he's like he's

1680
04:45:09,159 --> 04:45:24,540
like five he's like five eleven i'm like fucking six two you know it is now there's there's tons

1681
04:45:24,540 --> 04:45:28,220
of people that i could say this about you know about hanging out with people reaching out to

1682
04:45:28,220 --> 04:45:34,540
people you know you there's a lot of people that you end up talking to on a weekly daily monthly

1683
04:45:34,540 --> 04:45:47,659
basis i completely get it yearly but that's another thing too that i think a lot of people

1684
04:45:47,659 --> 04:45:55,220
need to understand is um friendships are great and they work very well especially when when

1685
04:45:55,220 --> 04:46:02,360
people don't feel like they're obligated to have to hang out with anybody you know what i mean

1686
04:46:03,000 --> 04:46:07,639
it can make it a little more comfortable when it's not like oh i have to hang out with you

1687
04:46:07,639 --> 04:46:12,779
because i have to but you want you do you want to and you want to spend time with this person

1688
04:46:12,779 --> 04:46:30,150
and you just do here comes the but no that was it that was the statement

1689
04:46:30,709 --> 04:46:45,209
but no i have i have a lot of friends in random various places that i've met over the years and

1690
04:46:45,209 --> 04:46:48,729
years and years some of them you don't talk to very much some of them you do some of them you

1691
04:46:48,729 --> 04:46:51,689
spend a lot of time with some of you don't spend very much time with anymore some of you used to

1692
04:46:51,689 --> 04:46:55,450
some you do some may be in the future you know oh well this friendship is now you talk to this

1693
04:46:55,450 --> 04:47:02,779
person every day now you don't there's another person that you hang out with or another group

1694
04:47:02,779 --> 04:47:11,220
of people it's just kind of it's kind of how how life is there are at least there are probably

1695
04:47:11,220 --> 04:47:17,060
at least a dozen people i can think of right now that are maybe not that maybe like six

1696
04:47:18,540 --> 04:47:26,729
that i will never stop talking to for my entire life those long-term just super friends that you

1723
04:50:52,470 --> 04:50:58,580

1724
04:50:58,580 --> 04:51:03,299
you know some of those costumes that get ripped or get fucked up in the process that can't really

1796
05:00:30,619 --> 05:00:37,020
are caused by your rampant alcoholism endless marijuana smoking and incessant cbd addictions

1797
05:00:37,020 --> 05:00:42,650

1808
05:01:48,759 --> 05:01:55,529
for me to figure out which one it is this is too many now this ain't happening this is not gonna

1809
05:01:55,529 --> 05:01:59,509
happen it's gonna take too long it's gonna take too long for me to figure out which one it is

1810
05:01:59,509 --> 05:02:04,659
i'm gonna i'll sit there for three days trying to figure that out my my phone will be blowing up the

1816
05:02:34,970 --> 05:02:43,659
face bernie pog well it was way more than one percent it was about 70 of my power what can i

1817
05:02:43,659 --> 05:02:51,500
do with the extra 30 percent imagine if we could unlock the other 10 if we could unlock even 11

1818
05:02:51,500 --> 05:02:55,180
percent of our brain power like that movie where it happens people could control shit with their

1819
05:02:55,180 --> 05:03:05,779
brains we'll see what i can do hey ryu bait thanks for the hundred bucks hundred dollars for the

1821
05:03:17,779 --> 05:03:23,180
for 250 so i gotta be a little sappy for a bit sorry here it goes having to go back into my

1822
05:03:23,180 --> 05:03:27,909
home situation because of this pandemic nearly sent me back into a real bad depression where

1823
05:03:27,909 --> 05:03:32,970
your streams helped keep me feeling semi okay take as much time as you need we're all rooting

1824
05:03:32,970 --> 05:03:44,869
for you yeah the the pandemic has really fucked up a lot of people's lives put people into

1825
05:03:44,869 --> 05:03:53,700
situations they shouldn't be in taking people out of situations that they really wanted to be in

1826
05:03:53,700 --> 05:04:09,580
is not good but we have some encouraging data that hopefully over these next couple months

1827
05:04:10,569 --> 05:04:19,450
somewhere into july that we can really start to be on the down it's just the downtrend try to go

1828
05:04:19,450 --> 05:04:40,360
back to fucking normal as much as we can i would love to see it because out here in uh in nevada

1829
05:04:42,169 --> 05:04:48,419
the stay at home order is still here and it's gonna stay and we're doing this whole phased

1830
05:04:48,419 --> 05:04:54,020
thing where if a couple weeks go by and there's no spike in cases then we're gonna slowly go

1831
05:04:54,020 --> 05:05:01,590
into another phase but from everything everyone i everything i've read about this this shit's not

1832
05:05:01,590 --> 05:05:07,799
gonna go away it's just here and i don't think we're gonna this is might be a situation where

1833
05:05:07,799 --> 05:05:13,700
this is something that we have to deal with for a long time people say the word second phase but

1834
05:05:13,700 --> 05:05:20,810
i'm not even sure i don't even know if i believe that because i think it's just here and i'm not

1835
05:05:20,810 --> 05:05:28,520
even sure if there's a second phase what about just first phase that never leaves until obviously

1836
05:05:28,680 --> 05:05:43,959
like a vaccine right phase five a second spike is more accurate yeah i'm not a doctor i'm not a

1837
05:05:43,959 --> 05:05:52,150
scientist just kind of we just went that it's out of my it's out of my court for this i'm an e-clown

1838
05:05:52,150 --> 05:05:56,549
that dances to jojo's bizarre adventure i don't know anything about fucking medicine i'm just

1839
05:05:56,549 --> 05:06:01,349
going to listen to the people that do know about medicine and know how to run shit and that's what

1840
05:06:01,349 --> 05:06:05,110
i i just danced at jojo's bizarre adventure in front of a green screen that's what i do

1841
05:06:05,669 --> 05:06:16,659
and let's hope they can figure it out because this is an unprecedented thing and sure there's

1842
05:06:16,659 --> 05:06:20,259
a lot of well we have like we've been we potentially have been running through these

1843
05:06:20,259 --> 05:06:25,139
like simulated pandemics and we have some idea of what might happen and what might not happen

1844
05:06:25,139 --> 05:06:30,520
who fucking knows this is the first time this has really ever caused this much of a problem

1845
05:06:30,520 --> 05:06:48,299
at least in the in the united states can we ban sour please why what about spanish flu

1846
05:06:49,020 --> 05:06:56,380
well when i say that when i'm talking about is like disney world closed for more than a week

1847
05:06:57,529 --> 05:07:03,720

1848
05:07:03,720 --> 05:07:13,270

spanish flu is modern times no when your tv could push through colors is where modern times starts

1906
05:14:59,959 --> 05:15:05,959
that's called uh neurokinetic therapy it's supposed to help your body it unhooks muscle

1907
05:15:05,959 --> 05:15:10,520
tension is the short way i can explain it it sounds fishy but i've seen it work it may help

1908
05:15:10,520 --> 05:15:25,900
you i am i'm willing to try pretty much anything but we i do have a positive result for potential

1909
05:15:25,900 --> 05:15:34,259
potential maybe i maybe remember this is not a diagnosis i don't know but rheumatoid arthritis

1910
05:15:36,169 --> 05:15:42,630
my rheumatoid factor was high which apparently can explain a few different conditions that can

1911
05:15:42,630 --> 05:15:50,009
cause that and ra is one of them that was the last thing that happened and the next thing to

1912
05:15:50,009 --> 05:15:59,209
say all right let's get this taken care of let's get this figured out but yeah i looked into i

1913
05:15:59,209 --> 05:16:05,560
looked into like acupuncture and massage therapy i went to physical therapy i was told to physical

1914
05:16:05,560 --> 05:16:13,990
therapy this might not even help so i'm willing to try pretty much anything i will actually write

1915
05:16:13,990 --> 05:16:26,650
that down take a look neurokinetic therapy let's just put it in there cool thanks for the tip

and i was about to book the procedure then i had another doctor that said wait don't do that yet

1920

1951
05:20:44,840 --> 05:20:51,509
you know i was actually talking to kim about this you don't really feel like an adult or feel like

1952
05:20:51,509 --> 05:21:00,680
you've grown up at all until until you you say a certain phrase out loud or you do a certain

1953
05:21:00,680 --> 05:21:04,520
thing that you just go i can't believe what what the fuck did that person say that's unbelievable

1954
05:21:05,080 --> 05:21:11,189
wait when i was like 17 18 19 i probably would have thought that was funny no i wouldn't have

not me not me i'm perfect well i'm sure i've everybody grows up everybody you know grows up

1956
05:21:19,669 --> 05:21:25,110
a little bit through the teens into their 20s i like to hope i've become a more mature person

1957
05:21:25,110 --> 05:21:31,139
in the last 20 years but i don't i i do agree with you though i don't think that i've

1958
05:21:31,860 --> 05:21:37,479
i don't think i've changed my approach i think that's still it's that's stayed pretty much the

1959
05:21:37,479 --> 05:21:54,340
same have you tried going 2 000 years into the future in search of a cure two that's a lot um

1960
05:21:55,740 --> 05:22:02,700
how about like 50 100 years 2 000 years i don't know if i want to step out of the time machine

1961
05:22:03,799 --> 05:22:07,700
the ground might be made out of liquid by then i'm not sure i want to do that

1962
05:22:11,580 --> 05:22:20,040
there might be a new animal that has eaten us all well i'm not doing that i'll i'm going tops 10

1963
05:22:20,040 --> 05:22:26,310
years in the future you go 10 years at a time don't go right to 2 000 are you out of your mind

1964
05:22:26,310 --> 05:22:33,349
just go five years take a look around go order a hot dog walk around some streets is it normal

1965
05:22:33,349 --> 05:22:39,029
okay take a look at what what companies have is there any new medical things or any new

1966
05:22:39,590 --> 05:22:44,150
human advancements okay this is pretty normal another five years do it again another five

1967
05:22:44,150 --> 05:22:48,819
once you start to see shit really fucking hit the fan i'm assuming it's probably going to be

1968
05:22:48,819 --> 05:22:53,939
somewhere around the one to two to three hundred year mark what that's when you start to go

1969
05:22:53,939 --> 05:23:00,619
backwards and then start to tell people how they can fix some of those issues like right now like

1970
05:23:01,500 --> 05:23:09,770
now now now no not all right well we don't we don't know that yet you don't know that

1971
05:23:09,770 --> 05:23:16,520
but what they won't listen they will if you can prove to them that you've seen it all you got to

1972
05:23:16,520 --> 05:23:21,909
do is just say like i don't know you could just you could you could prove that you're from the

05:35:17,529 --> 05:35:23,259
while and i was on it for about two or three weeks and it just it absolutely destroyed it

2066
05:35:24,630 --> 05:35:30,229
and sometimes if i have a flare up which happens from time to time i go on a stint of this exact

2067
05:35:30,229 --> 05:35:37,349
medication because where i have all my problems is localized in the lower end of my colon

2068
05:35:40,540 --> 05:35:48,139
to reach talking about suppositories thank you somebody because if somebody was gonna say it

2069
05:35:51,380 --> 05:36:00,389

2070
05:36:00,389 --> 05:36:06,950
eight of them a day and it didn't do anything so we started finally tried to treat from the other

2071
05:36:06,950 --> 05:36:15,639
way and it worked perfectly but also the condition i have might not be in the same spot that you have

2072
05:36:16,279 --> 05:36:23,479
i was able to do it well with the other way because of where it sits the disease in the colon

2073

so i was fortunate that i was able to do it that way there you go look i'm let i i'm a transparent

2146
05:46:25,580 --> 05:46:29,900
people without interfering or would you change the track to make the choice to kill one person

2147
05:46:31,930 --> 05:46:41,110
um there are no trolleys where i live the statement doesn't make any sense to me

2148
05:46:41,110 --> 05:46:49,959
how big is this trolley is it big enough could i stop it with my bare hands you won't answer it

2149
05:46:49,959 --> 05:46:59,900
would you let the trolley so the trolley is just flying down the trolley track and i can pull a

2150
05:46:59,900 --> 05:47:11,560
lever for the trolley to run a guy over or let the trolley go forward and and and die or something

2151
05:47:11,560 --> 05:47:18,099
um well how can i be certain that i can change this track if i go over there and pull it it's

2152
05:47:18,099 --> 05:47:23,319
too heavy and what if it like snaps and if i what if i do it wrong i don't know how to do it

2153
05:47:23,319 --> 05:47:33,619

2154
05:47:33,619 --> 05:47:40,009
switch it okay no i have a solution so i'm in control of the track and i'm pulling the lever

2155
05:47:40,009 --> 05:47:44,729
so what i can do here is the the guy that's standing where the track is going to go i'm
