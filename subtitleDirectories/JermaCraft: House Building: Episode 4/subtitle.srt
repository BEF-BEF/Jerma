1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:07,929
Alright, well I literally can't afford to lose all that stuff, so I have to go get it.

2
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:10,429
Where was that piece of crap? There it was.

3
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:16,109
Okay, we're good. We're good. No harm, no foul.

4
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:27,079
I got it. Come on, give me this. Let's get out of here.

5
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,339
This house is a travesty.

6
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:34,899
First of all, I need to make... I need to make a furnace.

7
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:43,570
Furnace is done. And I got... okay.

8
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:50,119
I gotta put the furnace down. Let's get some iron.

9
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,119
I can take this and put it here.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,670
So you make multiple furnaces. That's what I like to do.

11
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,670
Whenever I play this pro game that I'm a pro at.

12
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:11,260
Let's get multiple furnaces going, burning mad stuff.

13
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:18,859
I at least want to get this closed off so it's not a completely open area.

14
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:24,640
There we are. Get me on top.

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,640
And I want to make rooms. You know, it's gonna be quite the challenge.

16
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,519
But I'm up for the challenge.

17
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,209
Because this is JermaCraft, baby.

18
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:38,340
As long as it matches. What is it, three up?

19
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,340
Something like that.

20
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,079
Look at that hole. That's an instant death waiting to happen.

21
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,430
I can't reach down there.

22
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,129
Gotta make the climb. Start putting some torches down.

23
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:55,430
Those things still brewing?

24
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,489
Alright, castle mode activate.

25
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:07,310
Do I have any other... I don't have any of the materials, do I?

26
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,639
Alright. Starting to come together a little.

27
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:18,419
Dun, dun, dun, dun.

28
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:23,530
Alright. What do I got for iron?

29
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,409
Ow. Six bars.

30
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:29,840
Seventeen bars of iron.

31
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,550
Get the coal back.

32
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,789
Let's make some armor.

33
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:36,789
Because I really need it really badly.

34
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,669
Let's go with a helmet.

35
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:43,360
And I think I got... I want to get a chest piece.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,599
Chest piece is like this, right? Yep.

37
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,900
Chest piece.

38
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,210
I want to make sure I get an iron pick.

39
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,210
Because that's really important right now.

40
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,599
And I want an iron shovel as well.

41
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,949
And... nice.

42
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,900
Alright. I'm looking for diamonds.

43
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,530
You know what I haven't seen anything of yet?

44
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,530
I haven't seen any endermen.

45
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,020
And people were telling me, oh well Jerma, if you see an enderman, don't look at it.

46
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,020
If you look at an enderman right in the face, it just starts attacking you or something.

47
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,199
So you're not supposed to make direct eye contact with them.

48
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,439
Which that's pretty damn terrifying.

49
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:31,259
If I can think of one very scary thing, it's to... it's like Medusa.

50
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:34,389
Don't look at him or he'll just murder you.

51
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,629
So they must be passive.

52
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:38,629
They must be... hello iron.

53
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:40,629
They must be passive.

54
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,629
Unless you look at them I guess.

55
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:44,629
They kind of just walk around.

56
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:47,830
I don't know. That's scary.

57
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,069
How many irons?

58
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:52,069
Only one.

59
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,590
Oh come on.

60
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,590
You're killing me.

61
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,590
I can't wait for my first enderman experience.

62
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,919
I'm probably going to crap my pants.

63
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,930
So let's get my house built more.

64
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,930
Because I want to make sure I can close this off.

65
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,740
I don't want to have to deal with this anymore.

66
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,740
I need to get a bed too. This is bad.

67
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,439
That's good enough.

68
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,870
So speaking of building houses.

69
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,620
I got a little mini story for you.

70
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,379
I guess while I close this up.

71
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:27,189
So my sister, my sister used to go.

72
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,329
Well not used to. When she was younger.

73
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:32,329
She was in some kind of like Peace Corps thing.

74
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,329
Not really Peace Corps.

75
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:36,699
But she went to the Dominican Republic.

76
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,699
To build houses for the very needy.

77
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,060
And the people that have no houses.

78
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,060
No any shelter really at all.

79
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,370
And she kind of used to go do this.

80
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,740
She used to go to the Dominican.

81
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,740
She'd fly down there.

82
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,490
This is when she was I think in high school.

83
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,490
She was only like 17 or so when she did this.

84
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,110
Which is pretty crazy.

85
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,670
And she used to go build houses for people.

86
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,670
Well I can't really call them houses.

87
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,670
Because obviously if you don't have an architectural degree.

88
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,850
You can't really build a house.

89
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,850
But every time I do this I think about my sister.

90
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,410
Building something like this.

91
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,410
Just making a small hut.

92
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,029
Just a small you know living space.

93
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:17,529
And it makes me smile.

94
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:19,959
Because my sister is really cool.

95
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,959
If you saw the latest grandpa video.

96
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,139
You already know who my sister is.

97
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,019
Because she had a cameo.

98
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:29,019
She was the granddaughter I guess.

99
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:32,019
In episode 3.

100
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:34,519
And yeah she's cool.

101
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:37,019
That story can lead into another story.

102
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,449
I have two siblings.

103
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,009
If those of you who are wondering.

104
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,500
They're both older.

105
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Brother and a sister.

106
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
I'm 26.

107
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,810
Which makes us pretty much.

108
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,879
We're all pretty much a year and a half apart.

109
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,879
And it's pretty interesting living a life.

110
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:58,120
I'm the youngest. I'm the baby.

111
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,259
Say your jokes. Go ahead say your jokes.

112
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,819
But it's good being the baby.

113
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:05,819
The baby always gets like what he wants.

114
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:09,779
I need to make legs.

115
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,600
Do I have enough legs?

116
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
I don't think I do.

117
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,160
And I'm probably doing it wrong.

118
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
No I do. Nice.

119
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,779
So I have a full set of armor on now.

120
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:23,779
At least not as easy as it was before.

121
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,470
Full set of armor.

122
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,470
Let me know in the comments guys.

123
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,470
If you have a brother or sister or something.

124
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,779
Let me know how things are going with them.

125
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,459
Because if you're not close with your brothers and sisters.

126
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,639
You should be.

127
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,639
You really should be.

128
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,639
Because when all S hits the fan.

129
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,639
When things really go down.

130
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,879
Your family really is the only thing that's really totally there for you.

131
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,879
At all times.

132
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,500
At any given moment.

133
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
So if you're having problems with your siblings or something like that.

134
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Just always remember that.

135
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,790
Really important.

136
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,790
So let me know.

137
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,790
I like to hear about that type of stuff.

138
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,500
It interests me.

139
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,829
Trying to make this all level here.

140
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,649
So the roof. I can essentially extend the roof.

141
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,649
By not building anymore.

142
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:17,660
And kind of just dig down.

143
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,579
With my new beautiful iron shovel.

144
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:24,579
I need to make a.

145
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:30,220
I gotta get more wood.

146
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,970
Look at this. They're just kind of floating in space.

147
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,980
I'll move them.

148
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,180
I will move them.

149
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,959
Oh will you stop it already.

150
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,970
How's that look?

151
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,720
Close this off.

152
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,720
I gotta make. Oh my god.

153
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,899
Remember like five minutes ago.

154
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:59,100
When I said that that was going to happen.

155
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,100
I even said it.

156
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,220
I just scared the crap out of myself.

157
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,860
By doing that.

158
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,300
Okay. Okay. Alright.

159
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
Make a little bit of a doorway into this room.

160
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,180
This is going to be the bedroom.

161
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,180
This is going to be the sleeping quarters.

162
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,660
Because that's not going to be cool.

163
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,540
Alright. I gotta fix this room.

164
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,100
A lot of stuff I gotta fix.

165
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,269
But as of right now. See you kind of turn the corner.

166
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:32,409
Right here.

167
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,419
Clean this up a little right here.

168
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,230
Alright. Awesome.
