1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:08,039
but that would be that would be you lying. You understand? Dude, the two best things at

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,839
BlizzCon were World of Warcraft Classic, something they did more than a decade ago,

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:24,920
and Warcraft 3 remastered a 16 year old game. And the third best thing is that Mike Morheim

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,000
stepped down before the company turned into a dogshit show. Oh my god. Dude, the mic is hot,

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,909
man. The mic is hot. You got a hot mic. What the fuck? Oh, dude. Everybody's already

6
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:55,899
saying that. Oh my god. Somebody says hot bod. No, hot mic. Oh, hi guys. You know who this is.

7
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:04,579
Sometimes it really be like that. Yeah, well, we're not playing a Blizzard game right now.

8
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:11,620
We're playing another game. You know how when you're a sweaty tryhard and you get like

9
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:18,260
gamer gunk on your controller. Oh, I know that. Tell me about it, man. I have about three inches

10
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,700
of gunk on this controller from all the Soul Calibur I've played. It is disgusting. I mean,

11
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,980
at what point do you just put that underwater and like shake it around with like soap and

12
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,140
stuff? Well, I stopped using it because I got a different one. But now that I like,

13
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,939
because I have to use this one for Lethal League, I've gone back to it and it's like,

14
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:43,450
wow. I think I could spread a disease. I think this could be ground zero. Oh my god.

15
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,010
What even is gamer gunk? Like, it's disgusting. Is it like sweat that just cakes on over like

16
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:59,719
years of time? Years? This took a few days. Yeah, but it wasn't, you didn't have gamer like

17
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:07,340
that. That was like years. These are my excretions. I like shake your hand. I don't

18
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,430
like that. Well, you know what? If we shook hands for like a day, you'd get all my excretions.

19
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:24,409
But I think one shake isn't enough. Did you make a tweet yet? I don't tweet anything. You

20
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:27,689
don't have a tweet yet about your story? I should, honestly, because I've people have

21
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,289
been asking me like every time I look at my chat for the past week and I said,

22
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:39,139
do you know Lethal League? Well, apparently you are stet abs. Lethal League with stet abs

23
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:44,259
then maybe Fred dead too. I don't, I auto, I don't know what happened.

24
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:51,719
Lethal League with stet abs. I don't understand. Well, then you're going to be germ bad.

25
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,300
All right. Let's move this over here. Are you like, do you even do like an intro anymore?

26
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,590
Or do you just say like, who cares play? What is, what is, what is it like now? Like,

27
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:18,379
how are you? Um, I gave up a long time ago. Let's go this way. Okay. Hey everybody. Welcome

28
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:22,219
to the stream for another edition of wacky Wednesday, where we check out the latest

29
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:33,939
goofiest games today. Lethal League. And boy is this one wacky. Oh, I burnt my mouth. Oh,

30
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:40,580
okay. Are you ready? So I, how do you, I remember we just did like, we did a test.

31
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:47,060
We did a test to make sure it works, you know, we did, we did it. And then you left the game

32
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,060
and I have to do it again. No, you're like, yeah. Like, are you, are you ready? Are you in

33
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,699
the game? I'm ready. I'm ready to be joined. So you should, should I give like a rundown of

34
00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:03,349
what Lethal League is? You know what? Go for it. Tommy Pickles. Okay. So Lethal League

35
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,270
is a series of back and forth. It's a never ending struggle between two forces.

36
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:15,909
You've got the red team versus the blue team. Well, nobody dies here. Everyone lives. It's

37
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:21,050
just a game of back and forth and never ending struggle ball. You got blue team versus red

38
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:26,569
team. I'm on the blue team. He's on the red team. And there's a ball that signifies

39
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:33,050
a spherical entity and it goes back and forth between the two never end. Just press

40
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:39,610
press. I was waiting for the story. Okay. So there was, there is no story. I like it's called.

41
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:47,610
I just woke up. You wake up at 3pm. No, wait, no, wait. It's 1 30. I didn't just wake up.

42
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,009
Okay. I don't know how time zones work. Also you drink hot coffee in the desert.

43
00:04:53,350 --> 00:05:00,629
Yeah. What's wrong with that? You don't drink iced coffee. I look, it's you save money. I

44
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:03,670
play ping pong. You save money. If you drink, if you make your own coffee, like I used to

45
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,709
drink a Dunkin Donuts every day. Good. Keep doing that. By the way, if you guys didn't know

46
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:14,069
what this game was the back and forth between two struggling places and whoever gets hit

47
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:19,850
first is the one that gets their health taken away. Hey, you're not going to get that one.

48
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:26,420
I'm sorry. It's about, it's about two struggling forces. It's so confusing when it's that fast

49
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,620
and you can also make it go through walls. Yeah. So everyone's got it. You've got a

50
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,149
special ability. Uh, his special ability is being a fucking cheater. What's that?

51
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:43,720
Is that a smash ball? Smash ball. It's a smash ball. Oh yeah. They edit power-ups.

52
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:51,370
What the fuck? I don't know what that is. What does that do? Oh, oh, oh, oh my God.

53
00:05:56,329 --> 00:06:00,329
I don't understand what it's doing. It's, it's your superpower where it's going through walls

54
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:09,879
and now you know how confusing it is. Jesus Christ. I hate that ability.

55
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:16,839
What even, what is your, wow. Mine like curbs it and it's, it's not, it's not anything.

56
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:22,839
What, what, what does yours do? Like just that maybe curbs it. Show it to me. Show

57
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,519
people what that was. That was best special in the game. What are you talking about?

58
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:44,500
Ow. Oh, he's reading the summary of the load of the rings. Fuck one to find them. One to

59
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:55,240
bind them and one to shine them. The speed of the ball affects like hit damage. Oh fuck. Oh

60
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,779
my God. Oh my God. Oh yeah. And you can hit the people's dead bodies. Very important.

61
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,579
Oh, that's right. Oh my God. But like, but just for real though, if you don't know

62
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:19,819
what this game is, it's a red versus blue scenario where I'm playing by myself. Oh,

63
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,980
red, red communist China. That's why my ping pong pad. Wait, did you win? Yeah. I killed

64
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,500
you. All right. Now that we can explain what the game is. So if you don't know what the

65
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:39,500
game is for the next hour, I just felt fucking caught. I just got this fucking room. I just

66
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:45,259
got this room and I spilled coffee all over it. God damn it. Well, did it get on like

67
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:52,069
the nice walnut desk? Oh no, I'm good. We're good. He only lost because he spilled his

68
00:07:52,069 --> 00:08:01,800
coffee. Who are these other characters? Should I be, should I be crocodile Dundee?

69
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,519
You still like crocodile Dundee. Did I? What is this special? I don't remember,

70
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:12,339
but I know he can, he can hang on the walls. Oh shit. It did get on the desk. Hold

71
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:14,980
on. I have a, I have a coaster here specifically for this. Oh, I got to take

72
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:21,610
my shirt off. Oh my God. Is this a web cam shirt off Jerma Stream? No shirt. No,

73
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,970
it's called, it's, it's called really like I spilled on my walnut desk. How much did

74
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:34,419
you pay for your walnut desk? It was at least like $400. It's a beautiful walnut

75
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:41,259
desk. I don't, don't swing that at me. I'll know you're going to do it. Okay.

76
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:44,299
That's good. I can put it back on the coaster. I'm not going to wash this again

77
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:50,870
later. I'm going to wash it. Okay. Now I got coffee all over me. I'll give me

78
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:58,440
one more second. You know, it's enough to fighting nations. Oh yeah. He like eats

79
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:11,480
it. His is really good too. Oh, I just heard you. I just heard you being me.

80
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:33,799
You're going to die, dude. I had my catcher's mid out. Oh my God. What was

81
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:37,960
that? You got double hit by it. We, uh, if you attack at the same time,

82
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:43,879
sometimes you, uh, you're like double hit it. What did I say? Nice for,

83
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,720
Oh, there's an emo button. I don't remember what it is.

84
00:09:52,659 --> 00:10:02,789
Ooh, nice throw. Oh, I thought I had it. Tommy Pickles burst five. Whoa. That was

85
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:14,230
weird. That was a weird one. That is so strange when you do that. Oh my God.

86
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:25,990
Wow. What's the button? It's, I don't know. I want that to be my thing on my

87
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:32,789
screen. I'm not going to tell you. You always were a freaking selfish lover.

88
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,259
Oh my God. You've been practicing.

89
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,830
Wouldn't it be cool if Blizzard like announced this game instead of Diablo

90
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:58,620
Immortal and then lethal league blaze had a player base. Well, another funny

91
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,740
joke you could make is if Val bought this company and then put it out again.

92
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,179
What happened to PC gaming? What happened to it? Dude, I was saying this the other

93
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:13,379
day, um, 2019 and beyond get ready for the weird times where Val is going to

94
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:17,480
start releasing better games than Blizzard. It's about to happen. You

95
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,559
heard it. This is a new character. I'll try this character. Uh, I messed

96
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,840
with her in training. She like, she puts the ball in a bubble and slows

97
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,840
it down and then it, when it wears off, it speeds up again. Oh, that's

98
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:35,049
cool. Oh, for those of you, for those of you, German might on the German side

99
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:37,450
here, uh, we're going to be, uh, I got, I got a couple of bounces for you

100
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,289
here after playing lethal league. I'm going to give you some updates on the

101
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:43,450
green screen. Those of you, German might sit here in the German channel.

102
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,360
What the hell? Yeah, it's okay. It does a weird slow thing. It has like

103
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:59,289
three phases to it. Wow. Okay. That's pretty cool. I got it. I got it. I

104
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:07,289
got it. I got it. Why did I just do, I, I got it. I, I got it. I got it.

105
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:21,240
That just was, Ooh, that throw was actually pretty nifty. Oh, how did you

106
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:30,940
catch that? I just went the wrong way. I swung the wrong way. Did I hit

107
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:44,759
by that? Yeah. Oh, smash ball. What the heck? Come on. Give it to me.

108
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:53,539
Ooh, just homing missile it in. I'm Satan. I'm Satan. I don't know. What

109
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,379
does it do? I don't know. I think I'm Satan. Is it? Oh, I think it

110
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:02,019
changes too. What the fuck? Yeah, that's actually pretty stupid. I

111
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:05,059
thought it was a really dumb power, but once you get that fast.

112
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,899
No, it's my ball. What am I doing? Like cast. I'm like throwing confetti

113
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:21,669
at you. What the fuck am I doing? You're dying. Oh God. Not for long.

114
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:30,779
All right. Let's bring this to the stratosphere. Oh my God. Oh my God.

115
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:37,419
Some of this I saw in the sewer stage. If you get the ball a certain

116
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,980
speed, like a monster comes out of the sewer in the background.

117
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,580
Oh really? That's pretty cool. Oh my fucking God. That was the

118
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:59,320
easiest thing ever. I just lost it. Whoa. I'm doing it. I'm doing

119
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:07,210
it the wrong way every time. Fucking God damn it. I'm a football

120
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:13,669
player. Oh, that's weird. Oh my God. That's real weird.

121
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:35,190
I don't like that. Watch out. Oh, I don't know where it is. These

122
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:45,899
old man eyes. I think, I think for the, the sake of how things

123
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,779
used to be back in the good old days, the old stir, the old

124
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:55,820
German, I think we have to make a bet. Oh no. If you win,

125
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:07,419
I'll stop DDoSing you. Oh my God. That's like.

126
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:19,879
That's like, that's too close to home here right now. I want to

127
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:25,289
be the yellow guy. What about if I win? You just, no. Okay.

128
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:31,700
All right. If you, let's go to the, the pad room. Give me,

129
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,299
give me like a round of think about that. Cause you just,

130
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:37,220
you just gave me like an impossible scenario. No, it's

131
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,700
not. We have to get like five warmup rounds. You gotta learn

132
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:47,110
the game. Actually like on second thought. Oh, I mean,

133
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,960
yeah. Like we shouldn't do it this time. Why would you

134
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,120
stand in front of it? I'm dying. You need to stand in

135
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,919
front of it. Hold on. I'm dying. You don't even on

136
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,519
second thought. If I win.

137
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:05,960
Okay. This game requires so much concentration. Like there

138
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,080
is no like funny commentary. No, there is. Well, what's a

139
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:15,940
funny commentary? Yeah. The funny commentary is I think it

140
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,860
has made so much noise that I just shook the balls.

141
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,259
Oh, here it comes. Here it comes. Oh, fuck me. Oh,

142
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:46,470
fuck me. No, no, no. Cause it hit the wall. It goes up

143
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,950
and down when it hits the wall. This is the scariest game

144
00:16:48,950 --> 00:17:01,909
ever. It really is. It was like that before too. Oh,

145
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:09,930
no. Are you trying to hit me? No, I was trying to hit

146
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:17,690
it right when it came out. All right. We got just a

147
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,609
stand over there. Ow. Ow. All right. Well, I didn't want

148
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,650
you to hit twice. Go all the way to the edge. Let's

149
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,809
try to get the monster to break through. Oh, no,

150
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:30,170
that was only on the sewer. What? I don't know if the

151
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:35,819
other stages have anything like that. I'm trying to

152
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:38,700
speed it up. Oh, my fucking God. All right. We just

153
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,380
replay. Forget it. Let's give you a free kill.

154
00:17:45,339 --> 00:18:02,420
Hey. Shit. Shit. I can. I can tea bag you. Very

155
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,349
good game. So let's explain the game. So pretty

156
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:09,990
much how it works. So you got two sides, right? You've

157
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,029
got red team versus blue team. And it's a red team's

158
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,230
goal to hit the blue team's player with this

159
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,190
spherical entity. It's a it's a it's a it's a big

160
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:24,630
it's a it's a large circle that there's probably

161
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,869
an easier word to say, but it becomes away from

162
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:33,029
me right now. It goes back and forth at pixels

163
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,789
on the screen and you have to try to hit the

164
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:40,309
other person's team with that. The protractor

165
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:42,230
when you when you take a protractor and you go

166
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,269
around in the circle with the I just said circles

167
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:51,299
and remind the joke is over. I don't that was

168
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,259
a joke. No, I was trying to not say the

169
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,980
fucking word ball or sir. I don't even know

170
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,259
what I was trying to say. I can't you

171
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:00,180
understand. It's like being speech jammed trying

172
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:07,289
to play this. No, I don't. I don't. I was

173
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:08,970
going for something and it just it just wasn't

174
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:20,250
going to work out. I summoned the monster. I

175
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,210
didn't see it. How did you not see that? Oh

176
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,490
because I was focused. You didn't see the

177
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:33,349
monster. Really? I was going to grab that

178
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:44,009
shit. You wish you grabbed it. Take this.

179
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:53,509
Sure. Holy fucking hell. He didn't come out

180
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,750
that time. He's he's picking up a little

181
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,890
bit. Oh, that was a good play. Oh, that

182
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,579
was a bad play. And that ability is a rough

183
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:17,819
one. Oops. The germamites. Haha. Ban that

184
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:21,259
guy for life by the way. I don't want to

185
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:31,940
die. Alright, so if hey how about instead

186
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,059
of like jokey like stick the knife in

187
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:38,019
and twist it jokes. Yeah. What do you

188
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:44,490
actually want to do here? I don't know. I

189
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,930
think everything in your life has lost

190
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,759
value to you. There's nothing I could

191
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:52,390
offer you that you don't already have.

192
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,470
You're such a big germa now. High in the

193
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,549
clouds with his head and his ego. What

194
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,829
can I possibly offer?

195
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,339
How about that? You know, I got a new

196
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:09,339
place. You know what I could use right

197
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,750
now? I could use some new curtains

198
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,200
here. New place. Yeah, why don't you

199
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,640
have your real friend italics get

200
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,759
them. Hey, you got a new place too.

201
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,200
Don't you need some new curtains?

202
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:30,680
But perhaps. But is this the curtain

203
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:42,339
battle? Yes. Okay. Okay. Yep. See he I

204
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,940
the candy man said yep like four times.

205
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,460
I thought you heard it. Yep. You're

206
00:21:47,460 --> 00:22:05,660
cheating. Nice throw. The thing that's

207
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,140
different this time is both terrible.

208
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,869
I tried to grab that shit. Oh, you

209
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:24,230
fucking lobbed it over at me. You

210
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:37,380
fucking lobbed it over at me. I keep

211
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:46,420
doing that. Not this bullshit. I

212
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,460
remember this shit from last time we

213
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,660
played. You like then you then you

214
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,940
get out of the way. I remember that.

215
00:22:50,980 --> 00:23:02,250
Come get it. That slowed down so much.

216
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:15,109
Why? Oh my fucking lord. What am I

217
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:25,960
thinking? What am I thinking? Oh my

218
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,339
god. So is that is that one curtain?

219
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:32,259
Two curtains a set? You get you get

220
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:36,220
one side. Okay. One side. What does

221
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,059
that mean? Did get one side. Yeah, but

222
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:39,420
you get a double window. That's one

223
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,019
curtain for one side. One of the double

224
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,619
windows. You always wear a cheapskate.

225
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:55,670
I want to summon the guy. So let's go

226
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,680
to the wait this one here? Yeah. Is

227
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,640
it this one? Yeah. No, not this one.

228
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:03,900
Well, it's too late. So you get

229
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:13,500
one side of one curtain. Oh my

230
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,910
lord. Aye yi yi yi yi.

231
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:33,859
Can I get can I get? Oh, I just got

232
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:35,460
mortal combatted. I just swept your

233
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:38,250
leg over and over again. I really stood

234
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,849
up into it three times. I don't know how

235
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:53,640
you control standing up in this.

236
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:02,150
Catch it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

237
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:12,009
Nice. Stop it. What's happening here?

238
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,059
You're a bull hog. I was just waiting

239
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:17,259
on this side like it'll come here

240
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:17,819
eventually.

241
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,259
What the fuck am I doing? What's the

242
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:31,700
taunt button? I don't know, but you

243
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,500
better stop pressing it.

244
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:38,869
It's too fast. I can't get it.

245
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:04,150
I don't like this game. Get him.

246
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:19,259
He just ayah. That makes me so happy.

247
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:25,509
Is it ayah? Yeah. Why does that

248
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:27,269
make you happy? Because that's

249
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:28,869
that's what all the old Chinese men

250
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:30,549
play say during ping pong.

251
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,089
Is it? Yes. That's why we play

252
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:39,529
ping pong. I played like a week

253
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:40,650
after I moved here and it's been a

254
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,730
while though. I haven't gone back.

255
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,769
My chat knows that I showed up. I

256
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:47,930
paid five hundred dollars for a year

257
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,289
membership and never came back.

258
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:54,359
Well, you sure you sure sound like

259
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,079
you know what the fuck you're

260
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:55,640
talking about.

261
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,740
Like press mute here. Let's mute it.

262
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:05,319
No, we fucking don't. Wait,

263
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,920
there's a store? What?

264
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,299
There's a store in this? I think

265
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:18,099
you can buy characters. I caught

266
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:22,180
that one on the edge. Oh, I thought

267
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,420
I timed that right. What a bunt boy.

268
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:44,579
Damn it. Oh, did I catch it?

269
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,980
Yeah, I did. Oh, God, I hate that.

270
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,099
Oh, my God, I got caught it. I

271
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,500
thought I thought I got hit. I got

272
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,029
hit. Oh, you did. You did get hit.

273
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,799
No. Oh, I thought you did get

274
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,240
hit by it. Sometimes your

275
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,119
character does this thing where he

276
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,079
crunches forward and looks like

277
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:10,309
it's hit. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes

278
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:17,109
it'd be like that. You have fun

279
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:20,460
over there. What? How did that

280
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:31,750
hit me? Oh, oh, you don't know

281
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,869
nothing about curving the ball

282
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:38,140
and spin. Oh, you don't know

283
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,460
nothing about spin. That bounced

284
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:50,920
around. I thought I turned. I

285
00:28:50,920 --> 00:29:09,480
turned. I turned around. That was

286
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,079
bullshit. What the hell was that?

287
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,539
I wish the other boys unlocked.

288
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,059
They have like the giant boombox

289
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,309
boss you could play as. I think

290
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:23,430
yeah, you get like currency

291
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,309
though, don't you? There's some

292
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:25,910
kind of currency thing. Dude, I

293
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,869
don't know. I'm going to go try

294
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:29,670
somebody else. I'm going to try

295
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,029
skateboard man. I've been playing

296
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:36,710
him a lot. Like we can unlock

297
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,630
different modes in the store

298
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,829
apparently. Oh, yeah. Remember

299
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:44,519
there was a big ball mode. Oh,

300
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,720
was there? Yeah, there was a

301
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,200
giant ball mode. My stream labs

302
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,240
has been turned off this whole

303
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,440
time. It's like I don't even know

304
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,839
how to fucking stream. Your what

305
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,200
was turned off? Sorry about my

306
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,839
stream labs. Oh, what is this

307
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:57,880
special movie? Skateboards

308
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:08,549
around. I don't remember. What are

309
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:11,700
these days? I'll get it. Oops.

310
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:25,619
Brain. Kick flip. Kick flip. Damn

311
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:34,039
that. Oh my God. When you all just

312
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,480
like jump around like idiots.

313
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:46,150
Wait, what is that? Hold on a

314
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,880
second. That's a different move.

315
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,279
One of them is throw probably. No,

316
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,480
okay. That's just different move

317
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,920
for a bunt for a second. I was

318
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,720
like, what the hell is it? Left

319
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,279
trigger. No, there's anything else

320
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,079
do anything. Are we missing

321
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,359
something like that? Like I'm

322
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,480
trying to figure out what game

323
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,440
and he just loves the ball.

324
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,960
Bunt hit throw in your special.

325
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:14,299
That's it. What? That hit me. Yeah,

326
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:19,190
nice internet man. My internet. Yeah,

327
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,029
I know it's not good. Well, no, no,

328
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:22,230
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

329
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,589
that's not true. The internet is fine

330
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:25,190
here. It's a great internet. Great

331
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,269
speeds, fast speeds. It's just the

332
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:29,269
company that makes it. Well, they

333
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:30,470
don't make the internet. Nobody makes

334
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,589
the internet. It's like just data

335
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,829
that travels through tubes. But the

336
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:35,190
company that's responsible for moving

337
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,750
the traffic, the internet traffic is

338
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,950
having a little bit of a problem

339
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,349
right now as you can plainly see.

340
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:43,509
It's not good. There we've been

341
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:44,470
informed that it is going to get

342
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,390
fixed and maybe soon enough here you

343
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,670
will. You'll see it and I just

344
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,750
fucking won the goddamn game. I did

345
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:54,490
great thing. I swung in the opposite

346
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,170
direction on every ball

347
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,369
because I won the last two in a row.

348
00:31:57,369 --> 00:31:58,809
Do I delete your curtains that I

349
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:00,089
gave you and then I just never

350
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:01,529
agreed to another deal? No, you

351
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:04,700
never agreed because we're going to

352
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,500
agree that I'm going to go to my

353
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,589
main.

354
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:10,470
All right, let's do let's do one

355
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,430
more and see if we can like get

356
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,630
another game mode.

357
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:16,059
Okay, like how much is another

358
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,299
character?

359
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:19,259
I think you might have to go

360
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:20,619
through the story mode to unlock

361
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:22,220
characters.

362
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:29,109
Oh, really? I don't know. This one.

363
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:32,519
No, I want to ready up. X. I tried to

364
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,960
click the ready button.

365
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,920
It's X. It's not X.

366
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,500
Okay, well never mind. You're X. It's

367
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,380
one thousand.

368
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,980
You buy characters with the sparks

369
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,269
you earn while playing the game.

370
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:52,250
It's a thousand bucks. So we're

371
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,769
almost there. We've played like 30

372
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:55,210
minutes.

373
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:59,019
A thousand bucks DLC. Oh, you don't

374
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:07,349
know nothing about the spin.

375
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:11,029
Oh, look at those omnics in the

376
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:13,420
background.

377
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,500
Oh, speaking of overwatch. So what do

378
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,259
you think about the new character?

379
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:18,700
I think it's just McCree without his

380
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,980
flashbang, which is how he should have

381
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,420
been originally.

382
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:28,380
Oh, you don't know. Not this time.

383
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,420
You're not going to go backwards

384
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,019
on me this time.

385
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,579
Oh, I don't know if I like this

386
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:34,779
character. It's the character. It's the

387
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,339
fucking character.

388
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:43,609
Oh, that's the character. No, the

389
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:45,369
character. This mallet's too heavy.

390
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:46,970
Yeah, the heavy. The mallet's just

391
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,769
really heavy. It's just heavy. It's slow.

392
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:59,259
And uh. Oh, please.

393
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:00,539
That's just. That's the mallet's a

394
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,380
little too big for me.

395
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,740
No, I mean. What if I. People are

396
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,500
going to take that. I'm going to.

397
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,369
Maybe we're going to like take that.

398
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:12,730
Like that's not what I meant. Like

399
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,809
people are going to take that.

400
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:19,510
So how often do you itch your nose?

401
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,230
Oh, do I itch my nose? Yeah. I don't

402
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,750
know. Maybe once every.

403
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,469
All right. Or wipe your nose.

404
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,550
Whoops. I quit. The host has quit the

405
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,989
game. All right. Well, fine. That's fine.

406
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:32,070
All right. So let's go to.

407
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,820
What is showcase? Characters. Oh, we're

408
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,539
like. We're like one coin away from

409
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:39,820
being able to get one.

410
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,820
How come I don't have 985? That

411
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,760
would have been perfect.

412
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,440
Okay. Well. And the modes cost like

413
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,550
400.

414
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,789
Okay. Free for all teams. Lethal

415
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:51,989
volley.

416
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,769
Oh, okay. This is cool. This is uh.

417
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:57,929
It's like tennis or like ping-pong.

418
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,329
Oh, dude. Leave the volleys ping-pong.

419
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:02,250
You know that. You know that. I'll buy

420
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,050
that.

421
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,570
And then because I'm going to. Do I have

422
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,929
to own it too? I don't think you have

423
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:06,570
to own it.

424
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,730
Dude, you have to pay to earn how to

425
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,559
play too.

426
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:12,679
That's why. Secrets that give the

427
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:16,889
game the competitive edge.

428
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:19,449
Or like volleyball. Okay. I'm in the

429
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:20,650
game. Join on me

430
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:24,940
and we'll play volleyball. Or what?

431
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,820
Yeah, but

432
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,980
volleyball is just tennis. They

433
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,340
dragged the poles up a little bit

434
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,300
higher.

435
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,059
Guys, tennis has been around for

436
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:37,530
like 2000 years. Yeah, I believe it was

437
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,889
that tennis. Tennis was invented in the.

438
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:40,409
That invented. No, it wasn't.

439
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:41,610
No, it wasn't. It was the fucking Ming

440
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,449
dynasty. They fucking played tennis.

441
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:46,250
Yeah, and when Plato traveled there

442
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,929
he came up with it.

443
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:57,829
There's uh. There's new evidence to

444
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:00,070
suggest that Jesus was Japanese

445
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,630
as well and he had a son

446
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,909
and his name was something.

447
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:07,190
What are you doing right now? I don't

448
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,110
know. I don't know what this is.

449
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,079
Did I just lose?

450
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:14,280
I. Yes. I guess you have to hit it over.

451
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,880
You can only hit it three times and it

452
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,239
has to come over.

453
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:19,079
Okay, all right. So don't like jump

454
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,190
around.

455
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,670
If the ball slows down it's not

456
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,389
speed.

457
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:27,909
You're losing the speed aspect of the

458
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:31,619
game.

459
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:36,860
Nothing's going forward. I'm pressing.

460
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,300
Oh, I would laugh if it just landed

461
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,050
right there.

462
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,530
You suck ass.

463
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,650
This is the first time I've ever seen

464
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,719
it.

465
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,360
It's so hard not to just hit it

466
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:58,309
straight down.

467
00:36:58,309 --> 00:36:59,510
All right, I think we're getting the

468
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,710
hang of this.

469
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,780
But how does that make any sense?

470
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,980
Wouldn't it have just been a point

471
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,500
for me? Oh my god.

472
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,960
What happened? You can only hit it

473
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,400
three times.

474
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,820
Good strategy. I'm thinking I'm

475
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,380
picking up on this.

476
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,019
Stop. I just gave you a perfect ball

477
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:23,380
to spike.

478
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:34,809
Oh fuck. Yeah, like when you jump and

479
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:35,210
press

480
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,809
up you just slam it down into the

481
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:38,889
ground. Yeah, you just can't. Oh my

482
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:39,769
god.

483
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:41,849
You have to be completely under the

484
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:44,309
ball for it to even be remotely

485
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:45,590
possible.

486
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:58,340
Oh no. Can I grab the ball and throw

487
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,300
it at you?

488
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,420
Does that still work?

489
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,980
I think you can still grab here.

490
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,630
Oh, well I just saved that one. That's

491
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,230
what I call a fucking

492
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,960
save.

493
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:20,090
How do I dive? How do I dive?

494
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,670
No. Why did I jump over it? What the fuck?

495
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,269
I actually really like this game mode.

496
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,190
It's very awkward, but...

497
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:32,179
No, I just almost died.

498
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:40,599
I just called you dead. I swear

499
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:52,869
to god.

500
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:55,320
I'm just playing simple D. Just hit it.

501
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,239
You just hit it back, you know?

502
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:02,010
It's because I'm like my fucking

503
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,849
analog like spins me around in

504
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:04,889
circles.

505
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:07,800
I'll tilt like one direction and then

506
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,400
I rip the other direction.

507
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,000
Ripping this thing out.

508
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,039
The controllers be like that.

509
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:17,340
I'm fucking tearing this thing out.

510
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,280
I'm gonna plug in my steam controller.

511
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,789
Do you actually use that?

512
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:35,159
No, god no. Oh my god no.

513
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:38,650
Mad Kuzbad blaming the controller.

514
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,730
Yeah, I can blame the controller

515
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,010
because I know that

516
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,690
in my brain I've got these inputs

517
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,969
and this knowledge and this data

518
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:47,449
that's just like

519
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:49,130
flying around everywhere and it's so

520
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,650
intense. And then like it has to

521
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,050
translate through my hands

522
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,530
into a controller. That's just like a

523
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,489
middle man.

524
00:39:56,489 --> 00:39:58,170
About how you're too fast of a

525
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,769
thinker and you're too smart.

526
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:01,940
Yeah, like it has to transfer through

527
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,059
like it has to go through like the

528
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:05,059
pipeline to my hands and shit like

529
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:06,260
god damn it. Like just hook me into

530
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,300
the fucking machine. You know what I'm

531
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,820
saying?

532
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:22,280
Oh nice nice get.

533
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
See the pipeline of my brain just

534
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,519
wasn't ready.

535
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:29,530
See that's what I'm talking about.

536
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:33,719
My brain's pipeline is just like if

537
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,840
you could just connect a wire to the

538
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,639
back of your head and just like

539
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,920
stare at the screen and like hit out

540
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,760
go go go. Like you have to transfer

541
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,199
of data through your hands to the

542
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,079
controller.

543
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:44,619
There's too many middlemen there.

544
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:46,139
It's three hits.

545
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:50,440
Stop asking what happens. I will

546
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,559
divorce.

547
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:56,599
Oh boy you're really unraveling here.

548
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:59,880
Remember everyone's going to keep his

549
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,880
off.

550
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:09,059
Good one.

551
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:15,989
Whatever. Oh my god that is so

552
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:22,389
annoying.

553
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,880
I just tried to like I tried to

554
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,320
like meet the parents here right

555
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,519
there.

556
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,440
I was going to just like fall on spike

557
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,980
it down into your head.

558
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,500
Oh that would I wish you would have

559
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,940
just fucked it up right there.

560
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,630
I'm doing great. See I'm trying I'm

561
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:54,099
over complicating it.

562
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:57,940
Oh it always

563
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,500
I did go up. Be able to hit it up

564
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,460
from the air you

565
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:08,940
goon. Oh my god. I'm gonna win

566
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,699
this. This is the comeback.

567
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:13,099
No it's not. This is the comeback. I

568
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:15,099
literally I literally 100% guarantee

569
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,219
you don't. If not I will delete my

570
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:18,780
twitch channel.

571
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:24,840
Oh my god. See that's like that's

572
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,400
like

573
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,079
that's like the deal of winking at you

574
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,599
saying the next hand is blackjack

575
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:29,239
for you sir.

576
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,920
It's like I'm gonna go I'm gonna go all

577
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,519
in. Rematch me. Rematch me. Next game's

578
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:33,639
blackjack. Next hand.

579
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:35,000
Next I see I wasn't in the right

580
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,219
skin. This is the skin that I need

581
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:44,380
to win.

582
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,260
You made that bet a million times.

583
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,690
Yeah I know. So which one let's go

584
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:57,130
to this one. Construction joy.

585
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,610
Yeah I'm not gonna lose a single point

586
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:07,610
this game.

587
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:11,050
Yeah go get it noob.

588
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:14,150
This is the skin. This is the good one.

589
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,429
Boom.

590
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:29,110
What the fuck happened with that one?

591
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,710
See you can't press the direction

592
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,070
when you're in the air. Otherwise it

593
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:37,139
just goes straight to the ground.

594
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:42,070
Oh I'm not gonna lose a single point

595
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:46,889
because of you.

596
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:51,449
Getting a little tough there.

597
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:52,570
No it's because it yeah it's with

598
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,170
neutral air neutral air that's the

599
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:57,059
problem. Neutral air is the problem.

600
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:59,860
I see that's how I lost every point.

601
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:05,369
No that's not neutral air.

602
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:15,289
Fucking Jesus Christ almighty.

603
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:21,929
I'll wait.

604
00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:37,219
No it didn't it didn't go to the

605
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:43,539
right like I thought it would.

606
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:44,900
I'm trying to be fancy you can hit

607
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,340
it straight up so if you press up it

608
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,719
will go up.

609
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:49,400
I'm too scared to do that that's too

610
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,820
much for me.

611
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:58,460
I did it again he did it again.

612
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:10,710
See when when you wrote the script

613
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,780
before we started this stream

614
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,059
yeah you didn't think this would be

615
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:15,260
funny.

616
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,880
What this?

617
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah remember when we wrote the

618
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,440
script and we're like yeah let's not

619
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,880
know how to not hit the ball into the

620
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,159
ground for like 30 minutes and you

621
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:24,599
were like nah that's not gonna be

622
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,599
that funny.

623
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:30,090
What are you playing? Yes.

624
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,269
This script.

625
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,260
I swear to god I fucking had it I had

626
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,699
him right there in my grasp and I just

627
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:43,139
let him go.

628
00:45:43,139 --> 00:46:00,619
Again shit okay I'll try that again.

629
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:06,519
Now it's tied.

630
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,639
Oh this is too much for me I don't

631
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:16,260
unravel here come on.

632
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,719
Whoo as as painful as this is and

633
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:21,400
how stupid we look I actually really

634
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,179
like this game.

635
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:27,059
I came all the way back there too.

636
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:28,969
It was the skin.

637
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:31,210
People were like on the sub reddit just

638
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,369
like in real time going like come back

639
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:35,289
of the century dude he's coming back

640
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:37,050
right now and I got like a rush from

641
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,010
it

642
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,019
on the reddit. Yeah like you refresh

643
00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:42,699
like new comments like zero minutes

644
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:43,739
zero minutes zero minutes you know

645
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:44,699
I mean

646
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:49,059
fucking let them all down.

647
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:52,179
Everyone got banned just vote random

648
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,219
every time because otherwise I think

649
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:55,380
it makes us wait 10 seconds

650
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,400
for each person to vote I don't know.

651
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,039
Does it?

652
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:02,199
All right I'm gonna let's let's try a new

653
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:03,239
game mode after this one.

654
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:09,699
Get the reddit post ready.

655
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:15,030
Whatever. You just just whatever.

656
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:24,699
He's not gonna do it he's gonna fuck

657
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:26,619
up here he's too far away.

658
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:27,980
In the name of god was hat what

659
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,260
happened that you did your special

660
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,780
move.

661
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,980
Oh of course he wants to play with

662
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:41,030
items on.

663
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,869
It's a dead ball it just died.

664
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:46,710
Deflate bait.

665
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,110
That was Daria from fucking the Daria

666
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:51,699
intro.

667
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:53,139
You gotta be fucking kidding me here.

668
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:54,739
Oh what a recovery the reddit's gonna

669
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:58,199
be talking about this one for a year.

670
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:17,769
Oh no oh no.

671
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,780
You're dead.

672
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,670
You're dead buddy. What a fun game.

673
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:27,349
Oh my god.

674
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:28,949
That one wasn't a mistake like it

675
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:30,309
wasn't the same dumb thing we've

676
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:31,750
been doing that was I thought I had

677
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,550
it.

678
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:38,710
Oh my god the reddit.

679
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,000
My life for reddit.

680
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,760
A good thing that didn't hit it.

681
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,280
I swear to fucking god dude I'm never

682
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,400
I'm never playing that ever again

683
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:56,619
enough doing that ever again.

684
00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:57,659
I've come to know how you're gonna

685
00:48:57,659 --> 00:48:58,860
do that shit you can throw it over

686
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,090
every time that's how you do it.

687
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:05,769
See that's what he does. It's a good

688
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:06,409
move.

689
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:15,579
I died. How about a taste of your

690
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:32,420
own fucking grandpa's applesauce.

691
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,760
No.

692
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,679
I thought I would bunt it over I

693
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,460
don't think I pressed it right.

694
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:47,739
Oh that was a good recovery.

695
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:53,829
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

696
00:49:53,829 --> 00:50:02,820
Every time in the fucking corner.

697
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,980
That was a that was a conflict in the

698
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:10,730
middle there.

699
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:19,139
One more point. You would have just

700
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:20,260
lost right there.

701
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,900
No mother. Thank goodness gracious.

702
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:30,539
It comes down to this burst 18.

703
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:32,780
Hot hot hot hot hot hot hot too hot.

704
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,250
Too hot hot.

705
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,179
Too hot.

706
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:42,179
Actually really again I'm a broken

707
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:50,170
record but that's really fun.

708
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:51,449
All right let's go let's let's give

709
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:54,039
you a character. Did you see how many

710
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:55,480
points we had?

711
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,809
No I got 1400. All right we got uh

Fat McCree and then like a

00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,780
Dr Wily.

715
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,380
I want to play Doombox because

716
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,460
he's so big and that's how I am.

717
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,940
I just keep getting bigger and bigger.

718
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,860
So I'm getting Doombox. All right I'm

719
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,460
going to do the Mega Man boss.

720
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,380
This is like cut man. Told you.

721
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,239
Okay. I was seeing the game again.

722
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:27,880
All right so like I got this dude.

723
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,800
Okay cool. I could not afford a game

724
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,300
mode. We're just going to unlock it.

725
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:40,389
Now we can unlock how to play two by

726
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:41,989
the way. Yeah but I know how to play

727
00:51:41,989 --> 00:51:43,429
two.

728
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:47,480
Oh are we red? Oh only three

729
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,230
costumes here.

730
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:54,619
Two three uh four. Let me be green guy.

731
00:51:54,619 --> 00:52:01,699
What is what mode is this? I couldn't

732
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:03,619
afford another one since volleyball.

733
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:10,170
Oh well there it is started. Okay

734
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,090
that's a good start.

735
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,449
Oh I can't double jump but I get a

736
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:19,340
float.

737
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,619
What I'm too big. I'm too big.

738
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:38,090
Yeah your pit box is just weird.

739
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,809
Like don't even fucking. I swear on

740
00:52:40,809 --> 00:52:42,329
everything that I've ever done

741
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:44,090
that that was like I was said I was

742
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,449
desperately trying to make that not

743
00:52:45,449 --> 00:52:46,250
happen.

744
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:51,900
Oh god I thought it would bounce far

745
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,539
enough.

746
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:56,539
I got these big arms for nothing.

747
00:52:56,619 --> 00:53:01,449
He's so he's too big for this shit. I

748
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:03,610
can't get it out of the corner.

749
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:23,130
I didn't even see where that went. Whoa.

750
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,170
I don't know what it does.

751
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,860
Oh oh can I test mine? Oh no I

752
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,300
can't. Yeah you have to build up

753
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:36,139
that many hits in a round.

754
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:40,809
It's gonna get over. Nope nope nope.

755
00:53:40,809 --> 00:54:03,659
How many pickles man? I don't like this

756
00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:04,619
character.

757
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:05,900
Maybe at least not for volleyball

758
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:12,489
because it's a piece of shit.

759
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:14,329
Did you break it? You stepped on it. I

760
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:15,849
just hit straight down.

761
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:19,219
Oh I was trying to play a little bit

762
00:54:19,219 --> 00:54:21,699
fancy. My throw doesn't gain you

763
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:22,820
meter.

764
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:34,699
Holy fuck. I don't know what this

765
00:54:34,699 --> 00:54:35,900
does but I'm gonna do it. No I'm

766
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,579
not. I spent too much time focusing

767
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:38,539
on the special and I should have just

768
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:41,800
won the game.

769
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:50,900
Nope. Shit. It all comes down to this.

770
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:56,630
No god it's so hard to not do.

771
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,630
I want to hit it forward now you

772
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,849
straight down.

773
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:03,610
He's kind of doing reddit. Okay let's

774
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,730
play a normal one so we can see what

775
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,809
our supers do.

776
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:09,539
That sounds a good idea. So do we

777
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,139
rematch or you just join again?

778
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:13,460
No just play. I can change the game

779
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,579
mode in here.

780
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:18,599
Oh okay. I can't press rematch.

781
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,460
What? I'm in the character slot. No I

782
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,500
think I have to just rejoin you.

783
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:27,780
Well no I can't even quit the game.

784
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,139
I believe I'm stuck here forever. It

785
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:30,500
works for everyone else.

786
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:35,400
What did you do? I don't know. There's

787
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,719
a countdown on my screen?

788
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:39,159
All right well what's the countdown

789
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:41,960
at? Oh it like

790
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,639
count it down you for not selecting

791
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:44,840
a character. Now we're starting a

792
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,679
game.

793
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:47,639
Are you sure about that? We're

794
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:51,130
starting a video game right now. Yeah.

795
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:54,489
Okay now I can only quit. So you're

796
00:55:54,489 --> 00:55:55,690
going to want to alt f4. I took away my

797
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:58,519
rematch.

798
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:05,079
Come on. Son of a god damn. Oh yeah

799
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:06,440
striker is the other game mode is

800
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,130
supposed to be right here.

801
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:21,139
Fucking I I I forced quit OBS.

802
00:56:21,139 --> 00:56:25,429
No that has nothing to do with cox.

803
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:28,150
Jesus god damn it man. Rage quit.

804
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:37,989
I like oh that's so that I'm so

805
00:56:37,989 --> 00:56:40,949
I'm so angry that I just alt f4ed

806
00:56:40,949 --> 00:56:42,150
OBS.

807
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:46,219
Like I alt I fucking force quit OBS. I

808
00:56:46,219 --> 00:56:48,860
did like the task man.

809
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:53,449
I get it. It's not even on the same

810
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:54,329
window.

811
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:56,409
Oh can I can I just like lock a

812
00:56:56,409 --> 00:56:58,010
window to never be like removed you

00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,369
know what I mean? Windows 11

814
00:56:59,369 --> 00:57:03,000
make it happen. I can't wait for

815
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,599
Windows 11. It's going to be so much

816
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:05,400
better.

817
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,880
Don't worry they're going to skip

818
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,000
two versions and they'll come up with

819
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,530
like Windows 15.

820
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,780
All right I'm back. I'm going to join

821
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,139
your game.

822
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:22,780
He what a noob. It's weird too for

823
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,139
having power ups on.

824
00:57:24,139 --> 00:57:28,469
Like there aren't that many of them.

825
00:57:28,469 --> 00:57:32,699
Oh yeah and there's a minimum ball

826
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,199
speed you can set.

827
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:37,800
All right so you you know what?

828
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,019
Yeah. All right coming in.

829
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:42,389
Oh good thing we're gonna have two

830
00:57:42,389 --> 00:57:45,610
streams here now.

831
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:46,969
God damn it like such like a

832
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:49,210
bonehead accidental like just kill

833
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,730
OBS. Hey hey give yourself a break.

834
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:51,769
You've never streamed before you

835
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:56,380
know it's been a long time.

836
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,900
Yeah I raised the volume on music. I

837
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,940
saw people saying that they couldn't

838
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,699
hear it so I put it up a little bit.

839
00:58:00,699 --> 00:58:07,980
I just listen I heard you say hit alt

840
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,340
f4.

841
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:13,420
What is that? Is that your special?

842
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,539
You turn into an electronic device?

843
00:58:16,539 --> 00:58:21,400
I don't know what this does.

844
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,989
Oh I think I like I have no idea what

845
00:58:25,989 --> 00:58:28,789
that does. It goes into my hand.

846
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:30,420
It looks like it comes back to me.

847
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,539
Yeah.

848
00:58:31,539 --> 00:58:38,920
Well let's see what yours does.

849
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,719
Nothing.

850
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:45,000
No that must be like a proximity

851
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,199
thing. It must like knock me around

852
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:47,480
or something.

853
00:58:47,480 --> 00:59:02,380
Maybe you can change directions. The ball

854
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:02,940
homes

855
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,849
into you apparently when you do that.

856
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:09,139
I don't I don't I guess I don't know.

857
00:59:09,139 --> 00:59:11,269
Wow that killed me.

858
00:59:11,269 --> 00:59:13,190
Yeah it fucking murdered me.

859
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:18,250
Do you have like extra speed on the

860
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,530
ball or extra power on the ball?

861
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,050
Are they like actual stats like that?

862
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,969
I don't think so.

863
00:59:22,969 --> 00:59:27,639
Oh my lord. Oh my god.

864
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:29,480
Oh my goodness I didn't hit the ball

865
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,679
once.

866
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:48,780
Yeah I have no idea what that's doing.

867
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,659
Whoa whoa okay. Oh he's got like a hook

868
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:52,460
arm.

869
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,019
I hooked to it after I hit it.

870
00:59:55,019 --> 01:00:07,530
Strangely enough.

871
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:14,579
Hey what the fuck was that?

872
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:17,639
I don't know. What did I get? What did I get?

873
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:23,909
What's my Mario Kart? Oh god.

874
01:00:23,909 --> 01:00:28,519
No stay away from me. No. I'm afraid

875
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:29,880
to even go near it.

876
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,309
I okay I just get done. What happened

877
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:33,909
there? It. I'm confused.

878
01:00:33,909 --> 01:00:35,670
It got bumped it somehow and then

879
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:37,429
when it hits the ground it resets

880
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:40,309
to me and I guess you didn't hit it.

881
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:50,699
Football's the worst power up. Is it?

882
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:55,800
Doombox uh. He seems very uh hard to

883
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,719
use. He seems like the worst character

884
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:00,599
you could possibly have. He's big

885
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:01,960
and everyone's saying his special is

886
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,400
homing so that just means you know

887
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,760
where the ball is gonna go

888
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:11,530
which is bad. Maybe. Come back to

889
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:13,289
volleyball.

890
01:01:13,289 --> 01:01:15,369
Doombox special shoots the ball

891
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:17,050
straight at the enemy.

892
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,809
Yeah so that's what I'm saying it's like

893
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:21,050
you you know where the ball is going to

894
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:24,179
go so it's bad.

895
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:26,019
I think there's a there's a few people

896
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:27,780
that are telling you that you might

897
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,659
be uh wrong about this statement

898
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:32,739
because apparently he's very good.

899
01:01:32,739 --> 01:01:34,360
Well you know what I'm telling you

900
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,460
is that um who are you going to

901
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,539
believe twitch chat or me?

902
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:41,380
I mean apparently the best player in

903
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:44,099
lethal league mains Doombox so

904
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:45,300
I I don't know I mean what does

905
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,739
that say? Because that guy is a

906
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:48,179
boombox and he just plays him

907
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:49,380
because he associates with the

908
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,699
character.

909
01:01:51,699 --> 01:01:54,019
Oh we're doing this thing again? Yeah I

910
01:01:54,019 --> 01:01:56,150
like this.

911
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:05,940
No I couldn't reach it. Oh my god.

912
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,380
He was a little sloppy he was a little

913
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:12,940
sloppy.

914
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,860
Oh he's getting a little sloppy. It's

915
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,460
because my ping pong paddle has horns

916
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:23,769
on it.

917
01:02:23,769 --> 01:02:25,690
Well nice fight. He's getting a little

918
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:35,460
sloppy. I didn't hit it straight to

919
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:44,949
the ground.

920
01:02:44,949 --> 01:02:49,829
That time I did.

921
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:55,719
Did I just re? No I didn't.

922
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,360
I was trying to knock it back. I wasn't

923
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,480
thrown to the wall where it just

924
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,159
doesn't even bounce.

925
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:09,400
Oh my god he's gonna fuck it up

926
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,760
again.

927
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:17,699
It's in slow motion. Stop with the

928
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:27,940
funky shit and just get it over there.

929
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,059
What?

930
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:32,900
Go straight down. Straight down.

931
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,619
Straight down. Not even at an angle.

932
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:38,550
Straight fucking down.

933
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:49,909
I don't even how is it impossible?

934
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:58,199
Oh shit. Oh there we go. You accidentally

935
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:00,599
pressed forward so you're gonna hit

936
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:07,690
straight down. Not even. Why did I set

937
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:08,250
you?

938
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,530
I was like he's not gonna expect this

939
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:13,610
button. Why would anyone do this?

940
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:18,070
Why would anyone do this? Okay.

941
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:29,219
Up. Up. No. Oh fuck.

942
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:36,150
Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

943
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:40,280
Hey I'm ready. My brain is prepped.

944
01:04:45,739 --> 01:04:51,429
Oh wowie man. Wowie. That was actually

945
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,469
really great.

946
01:04:52,469 --> 01:04:54,070
That was a great volley. I mean it just

947
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:56,070
was. Nobody can say otherwise. They just

948
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:57,030
can't.

949
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,670
Oh that's not so much though. That one

950
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:15,059
not so much. That was not so much.

951
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:21,539
Nice. 600 experience points. I wish I

952
01:05:21,539 --> 01:05:24,860
could have. I could unbind

953
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:30,139
forward. You might be able to.

954
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:31,980
No because I wouldn't be able to walk

955
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,420
forward. What's the uh what's the other

956
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,539
game mode?

957
01:05:34,539 --> 01:05:36,940
Strikers which is you have to defend

958
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,699
against the thing but if you buy it

959
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:40,460
you have to be the host and I put it

960
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,139
into your game last time.

961
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:45,340
Should we learn to play again? There

962
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,219
has to be something either we don't

963
01:05:46,219 --> 01:05:48,280
know. I'm buying it.

964
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,639
Okay but I'm saying how to play.

965
01:05:49,639 --> 01:05:50,599
You're gonna have to be able to

966
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:51,960
host.

967
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,510
No well then just play another

968
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,269
couple because. Because I can't afford

969
01:05:55,269 --> 01:05:58,090
it.

970
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:59,289
All right let's see what's what's this

971
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,210
uh learn to play two.

972
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:04,980
You do it too. I think it just

973
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,420
watch my stream.

974
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,340
Open up my stream. Watch my stream.

975
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,500
Teaches you the the ball parry.

976
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,170
All right so here we go. You can

977
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:14,010
bump by holding. You can you can aim

978
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:16,329
bunts by holding left or right.

979
01:06:16,329 --> 01:06:18,409
Nice elaborate scheme to get one plus

980
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:19,769
one viewer.

981
01:06:19,769 --> 01:06:21,130
You can also aim bunts down

982
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:22,730
advanced okay.

983
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:24,409
Bunt down by pressing B and holding

984
01:06:24,409 --> 01:06:25,849
down. Okay nice all right you can

985
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:27,769
bunt down. You didn't know that.

986
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:30,250
I knew that. Hit the ball back and

987
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,610
forth at high speed.

988
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:34,099
Okay you probably didn't know you could

989
01:06:34,099 --> 01:06:35,860
do that.

990
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,139
You can see when the ball would

991
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:39,699
release on the boombox.

992
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:42,900
Oh you probably didn't know that.

993
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:50,760
Yeah so you can see what the ball

994
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,750
would release. I knew that.

995
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,670
Did you? How come you didn't say

996
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:56,869
anything about it?

997
01:06:56,869 --> 01:06:59,500
So I thought you knew. You can parry

998
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,019
if your opponent tries to hijack your

999
01:07:01,019 --> 01:07:02,059
ball.

1000
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,150
I'm doing this so you don't have to

1001
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,920
pay for it. To activate your parry

1002
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,079
hit the ball and press B.

1003
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:12,940
You didn't know that. I told you that

1004
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:14,619
before you started the stream.

1005
01:07:14,619 --> 01:07:16,539
You did you did not know hitting the

1006
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:18,219
ball and then pressing B.

1007
01:07:18,219 --> 01:07:19,579
I've never seen you do that move one

1008
01:07:19,579 --> 01:07:20,539
time. Because you haven't tried to

1009
01:07:20,539 --> 01:07:22,699
steal the ball from me once.

1010
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:23,820
This didn't happen. Look at this. This

1011
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:25,659
like animation didn't happen.

1012
01:07:25,659 --> 01:07:32,139
You didn't even know that. When you

1013
01:07:32,139 --> 01:07:33,260
serve the ball it automatically

1014
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:36,119
parries.

1015
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:37,400
So remember it depletes your energy

1016
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,000
bar in case you were curious.

1017
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,059
So you can grab the ball by the way.

1018
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,900
You're watching? Yeah I'm watching.

1019
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,059
Okay so if somebody's parrying you can

1020
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:50,019
pull the ball out of their hand.

1021
01:07:50,019 --> 01:07:52,710
I didn't know that. Well look something

1022
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:54,150
else you didn't know.

1023
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:56,389
Now you know. It's right stick to say

1024
01:07:56,389 --> 01:07:57,510
all the emotes. You were looking for

1025
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:59,030
this.

1026
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:06,170
Now you know. See okay that was

1027
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:08,440
160 dollars.

1028
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,960
I'm ready to play. And so are you. So

1029
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,000
you don't have like we

1030
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
you don't have to play for it now. I

1031
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,840
totally don't have to play for it.

1032
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:24,220
Okay join game. I kind of like the

1033
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:27,029
cut man. Cut man? His special is weird to

1034
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:27,670
me.

1035
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:28,949
I don't see how you would use his

1036
01:08:28,949 --> 01:08:30,789
special in volleyball.

1037
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:33,930
Oh you're really on this volleyball.

1038
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:36,489
I'm on this volleyball thing.

1039
01:08:36,489 --> 01:08:39,529
Okay you really like this game mode.

1040
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:44,600
Think of all the strategy. Think of

1041
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,880
how hard you can hit the ball

1042
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:54,500
straight down.

1043
01:08:54,500 --> 01:09:03,800
Ready. Oh home court advantage.

1044
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,479
I'll try. I thought you had a

1045
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:06,840
little bit of a different approach

1046
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:20,010
there.

1047
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:22,170
Oh that was a good one. Yeah reach over

1048
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:26,579
the net. Good job.

1049
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,420
Nice. Nice. See we're getting better at

1050
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,329
this.

1051
01:09:30,329 --> 01:09:32,090
I'm gonna be best volleyball player in

1052
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:33,449
North America.

1053
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:36,390
Yeah I wish. I tell you know what and

1054
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:38,069
that just you said you talked so I

1055
01:09:38,069 --> 01:09:39,430
couldn't play. Oh sorry. Sorry. I

1056
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:44,260
won't talk anymore.

1057
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,020
Okay okay Trolla didn't turn to the

1058
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,260
other way. I was quiet.

1059
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:52,729
Just just quiet. I was gonna hit it

1060
01:09:52,729 --> 01:09:54,090
straight down. See I talked and then

1061
01:09:54,090 --> 01:10:14,859
you fucked it up.

1062
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:24,659
Damn. Let's roll. That was a that was a

1063
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:28,680
move you did there.

1064
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:31,079
Oh what? It sped up off the wall. So

1065
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:32,520
weird.

1066
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:39,060
That was weird. That was strange.

1067
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:45,109
Back at your own net.

1068
01:10:45,109 --> 01:10:46,789
That you see if you that was a nice

1069
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:48,149
move. You got you you

1070
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:53,159
messed with my expectations there.

1071
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:55,560
Trying to emulate what you did. Great

1072
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:59,000
move. I'm gonna try it.

1073
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:06,810
Oh don't you dare. I what it wasn't

1074
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:07,930
close enough for that. I wasn't close

1075
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,449
enough for that apparently.

1076
01:11:09,449 --> 01:11:12,090
Apparently. I don't use this character.

1077
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:15,850
I gave up. I'm not using him again.

1078
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:18,010
He's a good character. His body's too

1079
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:19,210
weird for me.

1080
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:23,239
This guy's body is just so strange.

1081
01:11:23,239 --> 01:11:24,359
His tail is all the way over there.

1082
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:26,119
His face comes out.

1083
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:27,479
He's like this Donald Duck looking

1084
01:11:27,479 --> 01:11:28,760
motherfucker like no I'm done with

1085
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:36,340
him.

1086
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:48,439
Really be like that. Wow. It made you

1087
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:52,779
they make you even buy new songs.

1088
01:11:52,779 --> 01:11:54,859
No he's a good character if it's not

1089
01:11:54,859 --> 01:11:56,140
in that.

1090
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:59,800
He's just too he's too long. Dink.

1091
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,079
You parried me didn't you.

1092
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:02,680
Yep. I thought you're being real cute.

1093
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,199
Well the serve always parries.

1094
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:07,939
You just read that. I mean I didn't

1095
01:12:07,939 --> 01:12:09,619
that was about two minutes ago.

1096
01:12:09,619 --> 01:12:10,739
Just reading it would be like right

1097
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:12,420
now. Got it.

1098
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:15,989
You ready for this play?

1099
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:25,270
I heard that like a two seconds later.

1100
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:28,149
I heard me myself screaming.

1101
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:38,710
I swear to fucking god.

1102
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:47,829
What is happening?

1103
01:12:47,829 --> 01:12:49,859
I just I can't I don't I can't do it

1104
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:51,859
anymore. I like lost my mojo into the

1105
01:12:51,859 --> 01:12:52,979
game.

1106
01:12:52,979 --> 01:12:58,890
I think it's this character. I don't

1107
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:00,090
think this character is very good for

1108
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:01,210
this. No it's

1109
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,810
it's this game mode it's like too

1110
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:05,739
deliberate. Oh you have to like

1111
01:13:05,739 --> 01:13:27,989
you have to think. No.

1112
01:13:27,989 --> 01:13:29,750
What and and I hit I hit the ball

1113
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:31,029
I hit the ball backwards to myself.

1114
01:13:31,029 --> 01:13:32,949
You hit the top of the net.

1115
01:13:32,949 --> 01:13:35,270
I you know what I like hit the ball

1116
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:36,310
went backwards.

1117
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:38,149
Went the other way there backwards.

1118
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:39,590
I'm not sure what fucking happened on

1119
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:43,189
that one.

1120
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:46,260
I want I want to play the regular game.

1121
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,659
Oh my god fine.

1122
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:50,340
This is like this is like the star

1123
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:51,539
game mode and you all know what I'm

1124
01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:53,319
talking about.

1125
01:13:53,319 --> 01:13:56,279
This is the star game mode where

1126
01:13:56,279 --> 01:13:57,479
after the stream

1127
01:13:57,479 --> 01:13:59,239
he's going to put like a hundred

1128
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:02,310
hours into this game mode.

1129
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:04,069
I left because I can afford the other

1130
01:14:04,069 --> 01:14:11,899
game mode.

1131
01:14:11,899 --> 01:14:13,899
Now I can't leave again. I don't want

1132
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:14,699
to all tap

1133
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:18,520
OBS and kill it. All right I'm going

1134
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,119
to make this run into this real

1135
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:22,199
slowly here. Well I'm hosting.

1136
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:25,699
Hold on hold on. Okay I think I'm safe.

1137
01:14:25,699 --> 01:14:33,619
Oh it's it's the goddamn star mode.

1138
01:14:33,619 --> 01:14:40,649
Are there AIs in this? I think so.

1139
01:14:40,649 --> 01:14:42,789
All right coming in. Do we do you have

1140
01:14:42,789 --> 01:14:44,229
enough for the new game? Yeah yeah

1141
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:45,510
I'm hosting already.

1142
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:52,100
Oh yes I was gonna say that

1143
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,539
striker's play needs four people

1144
01:14:53,539 --> 01:14:55,300
for it to be good

1145
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,979
but I don't see where I can add AI.

1146
01:14:56,979 --> 01:14:58,420
He used to be able to I know that

1147
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:00,180
because we did it.

1148
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:01,699
Maybe I guess we could just do quick

1149
01:15:01,699 --> 01:15:02,899
jump.

1150
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:05,960
Also the star wants to play with AI

1151
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,479
instead.

1152
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:08,920
I don't know if you're supposed to

1153
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,939
beach ball if it's probably not.

1154
01:15:12,939 --> 01:15:14,539
So what is this? You're defending

1155
01:15:14,539 --> 01:15:16,140
your

1156
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:19,180
your hole. Oh okay so

1157
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,859
can you hit your own hole?

1158
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:23,699
I'm sure we'll find out. Yeah um

1159
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:24,659
because if you can put it in your

1160
01:15:24,659 --> 01:15:25,699
own like hole that would be bad. Yeah the

1161
01:15:25,699 --> 01:15:28,180
beach ball sucks for this.

1162
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:30,489
Hold on let me see can I can you

1163
01:15:30,489 --> 01:15:32,010
can you put it in your own like

1164
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:37,800
like I don't think you can. I mean

1165
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,359
we're

1166
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:40,119
kind of testing how these the game

1167
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:41,239
works.

1168
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:45,500
All right I get it. That's cool. No you

1169
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,140
can't. Yeah

1170
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:54,699
it's really good.

1171
01:15:54,699 --> 01:15:56,060
Yeah this is rough with only two

1172
01:15:56,060 --> 01:16:02,869
people as well.

1173
01:16:02,869 --> 01:16:22,939
What oh oh nice score.

1174
01:16:22,939 --> 01:16:30,920
What? Nice score buddy. What the

1175
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,279
fuck happened there?

1176
01:16:32,279 --> 01:16:43,880
Oh no burst five. You kind of need

1177
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,159
like a goalie huh?

1178
01:16:45,159 --> 01:16:47,800
Yeah. Where's where's your new best

1179
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,720
friend italics?

1180
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,319
Uh I think he's downstairs. I don't

1181
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:53,239
think he has this game though.

1182
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:56,840
But that would be three. Oh well then

1183
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:57,960
I could get someone

1184
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:02,579
else. I have friends I think.

1185
01:17:02,579 --> 01:17:06,500
I think I have friends. That would be

1186
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,859
unfair.

1187
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:11,819
How would that be unfair? Oh god.

1188
01:17:11,819 --> 01:17:13,020
With like a two.

1189
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:15,100
How how does this not hit your goal?

1190
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,460
I pulled it away right before he

1191
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:21,060
hit it.

1192
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:25,210
No. Okay that's freaked me out. The music

1193
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:26,409
just stopped.

1194
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:28,409
Yeah the music timed it perfectly for

1195
01:17:28,409 --> 01:17:32,020
like.

1196
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:45,029
Don't you dare. The world. Why don't

1197
01:17:45,029 --> 01:17:45,989
you like you just block.

1198
01:17:45,989 --> 01:17:48,310
Oh that's what we call a super shot.

1199
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:58,300
That's what they call a super shot.

1200
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,699
I'm just like going don't you dare.

1201
01:18:00,699 --> 01:18:01,979
I'm just like posing in front of

1202
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:06,310
you.

1203
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:08,149
That super is really good at this.

1204
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:10,470
Yeah it is good for this for sure.

1205
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:14,869
Oh my god I was trying to farm super

1206
01:18:14,869 --> 01:18:17,109
to see if I could do some.

1207
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:18,470
You're trying to do a super shot but

1208
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:19,670
come on man.

1209
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:47,399
Oh my god that is so good.

1210
01:18:47,399 --> 01:19:07,060
I fucked it up. It's all right.

1211
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:15,979
What?

1212
01:19:15,979 --> 01:19:30,550
Holy shit. Holy shit. Oh you caught it.

1213
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:45,180
Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.

1214
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:57,640
Ah that was just too high for me.

1215
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:08,779
Damn again too high.

1216
01:20:08,779 --> 01:20:11,989
It feels like we got better. Kind of.

1217
01:20:11,989 --> 01:20:30,090
No.

1218
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:32,630
Tried to be fancy. All right trying to

1219
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:34,390
see how it works with the baseball.

1220
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:44,140
I can't believe those plays are legal.

1221
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:50,060
I'll try.

1222
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:51,819
He'd probably be really good here.

1223
01:20:51,819 --> 01:21:00,090
Yeah just keep picking op characters.

1224
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:02,520
Uh see I keep just changing

1225
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,880
characters but you're playing the

1226
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:04,760
same character.

1227
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,399
He plays ping pong. You're getting to

1228
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:09,159
know every inch of that one character

1229
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:10,279
where I'm spreading my knowledge

1230
01:21:10,279 --> 01:21:12,680
across multiple different people.

1231
01:21:14,789 --> 01:21:20,789
Oops that was. Wow that was a pretty

1232
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:21,750
cool move.

1233
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:28,460
I'll give you that. Okay I saw you.

1234
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:30,060
All right I see what you're doing here.

1235
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,180
That's an interesting little play.

1236
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:32,300
Ain't gonna work again though. I

1237
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:44,470
mean you know.

1238
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:51,189
Offense defense. Oh my god that is

1239
01:21:51,189 --> 01:21:52,470
some bullshit.

1240
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:53,909
I guess at that point I just need to

1241
01:21:53,909 --> 01:22:03,380
defend. Why is it still going?

1242
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:08,039
It went over it. Oh my god.

1243
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:24,569
Oh my god. I can't get it.

1244
01:22:24,569 --> 01:22:28,149
Oh my god. I can't touch it. I can't

1245
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:34,970
touch it.

1246
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:57,590
Holy shit. I tried to grab it too

1247
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:58,550
but it said

1248
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:05,020
it said no. You're lucky.

1249
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:06,060
I was like holy shit what happened

1250
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:13,479
there.

1251
01:23:13,479 --> 01:23:20,439
Oh good play. You gotta parry it.

1252
01:23:20,439 --> 01:23:40,710
Oh my god. There's the monster.

1253
01:23:40,710 --> 01:23:47,850
Goodness gracious.

1254
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:52,170
No. Oh we got. I gotta cheat.

1255
01:23:52,170 --> 01:24:08,060
Oh fuck that was too high.

1256
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:38,659
Burst. Nice save.

1257
01:24:38,659 --> 01:24:43,750
Intensity.

1258
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:51,000
No no no no no. Damn it. Damn it. Damn

1259
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,500
it.

1260
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:57,750
Nice play. Oh my god.

1261
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:02,460
I forgot about throws. You can do

1262
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:03,500
them.

1263
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:16,890
Uh oh. Good video game.

1264
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:19,770
This is like. I love this game.

1265
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:22,170
They're so hyper focused they can't

1266
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:24,250
communicate.

1267
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:26,090
That's the excuse I keep giving about

1268
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:28,710
me and my wife.

1269
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:32,789
Wait. Every time we do couples therapy.

1270
01:25:32,789 --> 01:25:39,539
We're just too hyper focused.

1271
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:44,100
I'm ready. Actually why would you want a ring box on this?

1272
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:47,130
I'm gonna hit it to you. He is bigger.

1273
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:48,810
He is a lot bigger. No you stay with

1274
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,010
the green.

1275
01:25:50,010 --> 01:26:01,460
No there was a raid came in. Who

1276
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:02,340
raided here?

1277
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:07,739
I did. Oh critical did.

1278
01:26:07,739 --> 01:26:11,930
Hold on wait. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Just pause the

1279
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:13,210
game.

1280
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:18,739
Thanks a lot dude. You still here?

1281
01:26:18,739 --> 01:26:22,260
Critical streaming. How's it going?

1282
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:25,590
I did. I did. I did. Well thanks a lot

1283
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:26,390
man.

1284
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:33,029
We'll have to hit you up after this.

1285
01:26:33,029 --> 01:26:39,909
See how things are going. Wow. What I'm not allowed to have other friends?

1286
01:26:39,909 --> 01:26:41,109
No but like when you're on a date

1287
01:26:41,109 --> 01:26:42,229
with someone you really shouldn't be

1288
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:55,609
looking at other girls.

1289
01:26:55,609 --> 01:27:06,869
Hey fuck you. Uh oh boy.

1290
01:27:06,869 --> 01:27:09,109
Oh you just went straight ahead. I was

1291
01:27:09,109 --> 01:27:10,390
like this one's coming down because

1292
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:11,590
that's all we can do is hit it

1293
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:17,109
straight down.

1294
01:27:17,109 --> 01:27:19,239
What? I'm just playing fundamentals

1295
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:20,520
right now man. I'm just fucking playing

1296
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:30,789
fundamentals.

1297
01:27:30,789 --> 01:27:33,029
Ah yeah fundamental that. Jet Set

1298
01:27:33,029 --> 01:27:34,310
radio up my ass.

1299
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:37,739
I'm just gonna play fundamentals. It's

1300
01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:39,180
all about the fundamentals dude. You

1301
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:41,020
gotta get back to the basics.

1302
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:48,100
See and I thought I didn't play

1303
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:59,609
fundamentals that time and you did.

1304
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:09,750
Oh my god.

1305
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:13,189
Oh you know what you know they say

1306
01:28:13,189 --> 01:28:22,220
this is such a germa game mode.

1307
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:27,640
Oh fuck it's gonna do the thing.

1308
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:37,000
Get in there. Nah a little early.

1309
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,619
Oh what a what a germa game mode.

1310
01:28:41,619 --> 01:28:43,939
What a fucking sweaty tryhard over

1311
01:28:43,939 --> 01:28:45,460
there. This is germa game mode.

1312
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:59,260
Hey let's keep playing this game.

1313
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:02,460
Yeah okay let's keep playing this one.

1314
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:08,149
We can do the we can do the other one.

1315
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:10,310
No because you might have to think of the other one.

1316
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:29,130
I'm getting this come back.

1317
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:37,689
Just go back to basics. Come back. I

1318
01:29:37,689 --> 01:29:43,529
don't like her specialness.

1319
01:29:43,529 --> 01:29:45,800
Oh fundamentals it's all about those

1320
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,090
fundamentals. I need this rematch.

1321
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:51,720
Are we doing it again? I need this rematch on my main.

1322
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,800
Okay. I'm with my my main skin and not

1323
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,600
in your home character's stage.

1324
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,239
Why not? That doesn't mean anything.

1325
01:30:01,239 --> 01:30:03,960
It does. Well then it's all random. I

1326
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,239
didn't pick it. No you get plus 10

1327
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:07,159
speed on your main stage.

1328
01:30:07,159 --> 01:30:08,939
You see you'd like that to be true

1329
01:30:08,939 --> 01:30:18,420
wouldn't you?

1330
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:21,689
You would like that to be true all

1331
01:30:21,689 --> 01:30:22,970
those years.

1332
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:25,289
All those years of star beating me

1333
01:30:25,289 --> 01:30:32,949
at everything but this not this time.

1334
01:30:33,029 --> 01:30:48,630
Hit it.

1335
01:31:00,869 --> 01:31:03,770
You gotta let them get one. Otherwise

1336
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:08,550
we'll cry.

1337
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:22,229
Gotta let them get two. Oh my god.

1338
01:31:22,229 --> 01:31:28,869
Look out. It's fine. Oh that's okay.

1339
01:31:28,869 --> 01:31:30,390
That's okay. That's okay.

1340
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:31,909
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's

1341
01:31:31,909 --> 01:31:33,989
okay. Don't. It's okay.

1342
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:37,750
It's all right. It's all right. All

1343
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:39,670
right. Now you made it a fucking game.

1344
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:48,250
Now you made it a game. Now you made it

1345
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:50,020
a game.

1346
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:52,500
Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. I like

1347
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,859
my run animation.

1348
01:31:53,859 --> 01:32:05,699
A piece of shit. Oh now you made it a

1349
01:32:05,699 --> 01:32:11,239
game.

1350
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:13,399
All right. Okay fine. I gotta go

1351
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:27,619
straight carry to the goal.

1352
01:32:27,619 --> 01:32:31,350
Oh shit's in my pants. That's where it

1353
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:32,310
goes.

1354
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:52,619
Oh my god. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1355
01:32:52,619 --> 01:33:02,149
Oh you suck. Do I though?

1356
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:03,989
I just I'm not and he let it go

1357
01:33:03,989 --> 01:33:05,350
through his legs in the world.

1358
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:10,579
I planned the whole thing. The ball

1359
01:33:10,579 --> 01:33:11,460
went through his legs in the world

1360
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:26,340
series.

1361
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:31,779
No. Come on. Come on. Come on. Fundamentals.

1362
01:33:31,779 --> 01:33:40,649
And they blew into the world series.

1363
01:33:40,649 --> 01:33:42,090
Fundamentals.

1364
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:46,550
God that got cocky at the end there.

1365
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:51,720
Why beat you at your own game?

1366
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,079
You gotta let him win one. I mean

1367
01:33:53,079 --> 01:33:54,840
he's won one in like four. I mean

1368
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,960
come on. It was inevitable. He can't

1369
01:33:55,960 --> 01:34:02,939
be perfect every time.

1370
01:34:02,939 --> 01:34:04,859
You gotta let him get ten you know.

1371
01:34:04,859 --> 01:34:07,180
Just to build up his overconfidence.

1372
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:08,619
That's how you hustle. Then you say

1373
01:34:08,619 --> 01:34:09,819
oh the rematch. We'll double

1374
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:16,619
double or nothing.

1375
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:24,500
Oh please. Oh please. Please.

1376
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:51,020
Oh that was a freaky move. That was a

1377
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,460
freak. That was a freaky. That was a

1378
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:54,779
freaky eater. I'll tell you that.

1379
01:34:54,779 --> 01:34:57,579
You remember freaky eater? How could I

1380
01:34:57,579 --> 01:34:58,779
how could you forget? I don't even

1381
01:34:58,779 --> 01:35:00,779
remember talking to you about freaky

1382
01:35:00,779 --> 01:35:02,619
eater. Well you know my wife is a

1383
01:35:02,619 --> 01:35:06,140
freaky eater you know.

1384
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:09,180
No. Oh my god that doesn't hit.

1385
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:11,739
Oh good thing can't score on your own

1386
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:13,340
fucking goal.

1387
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:30,229
I should have ran back to my goal.

1388
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,720
I'm just like a such a huge fan of

1389
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,399
cheesy potatoes.

1390
01:35:35,399 --> 01:35:39,939
Oh you're cooking broccoli. Why are you

1391
01:35:39,939 --> 01:35:42,739
cooking broccoli right now star?

1392
01:35:42,739 --> 01:35:47,939
I tried to block it.

1393
01:35:47,939 --> 01:35:57,380
Harry fucking mayonnaise all over your

1394
01:35:57,380 --> 01:36:00,729
face.

1395
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:06,630
You're doing shit.

1396
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:16,300
Oh turning into Peewee Herman. Holy

1397
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:23,180
shit I thought it was gonna hit.

1398
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:26,380
Sometimes you gotta be aggressive.

1399
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:40,649
Sometimes. Oh yeah.

1400
01:36:40,649 --> 01:36:46,199
Oh man oh man. I learned that from star.

1401
01:36:46,199 --> 01:36:49,500
Sometimes you gotta be aggressive.

1402
01:36:51,619 --> 01:36:55,819
Come back. Okay you gotta let them get

1403
01:36:55,819 --> 01:36:58,140
10 sometimes.

1404
01:36:58,140 --> 01:37:01,399
You let me get 10 I let you get 10.

1405
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:02,439
That's how it works.

1406
01:37:02,439 --> 01:37:04,439
By the way level 10 that's a good

1407
01:37:04,439 --> 01:37:11,159
good comment you made there.

1408
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:17,819
That's not how friendship works.

1409
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:19,579
You know these guys are wind trading for

1410
01:37:19,579 --> 01:37:22,460
views.

1411
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:24,220
That's what we're doing. Wind trading.

1412
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:25,420
No that's that's what everyone's saying

1413
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:26,699
over here.

1414
01:37:26,699 --> 01:37:32,250
Wind trading. I spell new characters new

1415
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:33,289
character. What do you mean you spit it

1416
01:37:33,289 --> 01:37:34,569
up? I sped it up.

1417
01:37:34,569 --> 01:37:36,569
I hope you're ready.

1418
01:37:36,569 --> 01:37:37,529
What are you what are you doing? What

1419
01:37:37,529 --> 01:37:38,890
do you mean you spit? I don't know.

1420
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:40,250
Okay excuse me here this is this is

1421
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:41,689
not regulation. I mean even if I

1422
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:44,500
lose this it's not regulation.

1423
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,699
You can't just lower the hoop because

1424
01:37:45,699 --> 01:37:46,579
you're not good at shooting the

1425
01:37:46,579 --> 01:37:53,899
basketball.

1426
01:37:53,899 --> 01:38:00,100
Oh you cheat.

1427
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:09,899
No please. How'd that not go in? I'm

1428
01:38:09,899 --> 01:38:10,939
going to start doing the Vincent

1429
01:38:10,939 --> 01:38:20,859
Price laugh here in a minute man.

1430
01:38:34,069 --> 01:38:42,760
Oh oops now okay now okay I gotta be

1431
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:43,800
carefully because this

1432
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,159
how this happens sometimes a star

1433
01:38:45,159 --> 01:38:47,319
gets to the point where he's

1434
01:38:47,319 --> 01:38:49,319
he needs to try as hard he's trying

1435
01:38:49,319 --> 01:38:50,279
to get this to happen.

1436
01:38:50,279 --> 01:38:51,640
He's gonna be totally silent he's

1437
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:53,079
gonna focus he's gonna stop saying

1438
01:38:53,079 --> 01:38:54,039
anything funny.

1439
01:38:54,039 --> 01:38:55,720
I haven't seen anything funny in

1440
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:07,989
years.

1441
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:14,869
Feels bad man. You want to parry me? I

1442
01:39:14,869 --> 01:39:31,300
can go for a parry.

1443
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:35,220
Oh it's so fast. It's like a bomb.

1444
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:42,090
I don't know what to do.

1445
01:39:42,090 --> 01:39:59,609
Shit. I thought you were too high.

1446
01:39:59,609 --> 01:40:02,970
I was a little bit. Maybe not though.

1447
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:16,520
All right all right.

1448
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:30,920
Holy shit that moved around. Oh you

1449
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:32,439
did a thing with that. You made it

1450
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:33,880
oh okay all right I see. I did a

1451
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:47,109
thing with that.

1452
01:40:47,109 --> 01:40:53,859
Oh fucking Jesus. God that's so good.

1453
01:40:53,859 --> 01:40:57,590
It starts off so fast.

1454
01:40:57,590 --> 01:41:07,510
No I have to double jump for that.

1455
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:11,560
This is a very fun game. This is a

1456
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:13,779
very fun game.

1457
01:41:13,779 --> 01:41:15,779
Okay I set it back to regulation.

1458
01:41:15,779 --> 01:41:17,779
Are you what? New characters. New characters.

1459
01:41:17,779 --> 01:41:19,060
Oh I don't know if I have enough

1460
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:22,500
because I have to buy this game mode for you.

1461
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:26,359
Oh it's shocker from spider-man.

1462
01:41:26,359 --> 01:41:29,560
Yeah I can't afford any walls. Okay this guy looks kind of cool.

1463
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:30,600
I mean I think it's just because I've

1464
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,279
been winning so much that it's just

1465
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:33,960
giving me extra points.

1466
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:43,579
Yeah.

1467
01:41:43,579 --> 01:41:47,430
Yeah. Yeah. Am I coming in?

1468
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:55,750
Yep what game mode? Am I? The good game mode?

1469
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:59,079
Uh I mean if you want to like take

1470
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:00,520
the take this back and like start to

1471
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,279
embarrass me again you could like

1472
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:03,560
you could do the volleyball game mode

1473
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,479
again. Yeah. Build up a little bit

1474
01:42:05,479 --> 01:42:07,079
more confidence maybe take us into

1475
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:09,859
the next round you know what I'm saying?

1476
01:42:09,859 --> 01:42:13,670
Who the hell? What? Jack the Ripper? No

1477
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:15,350
it's shocker from spider-man

1478
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:18,579
with plugs on his hands. Hmm his name

1479
01:42:18,579 --> 01:42:23,539
is grid because he has a grid.

1480
01:42:23,539 --> 01:42:25,060
I didn't check the costumes. Oh that

1481
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:29,420
was a mistake. Let's see.

1482
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:32,539
Oh I forgot what I forgot what we

1483
01:42:32,539 --> 01:42:33,819
were doing. Yep. Okay this is the

1484
01:42:33,819 --> 01:42:47,180
this is the volleyball one.

1485
01:43:05,739 --> 01:43:13,319
Whoa that's weird. That's just I just

1486
01:43:13,319 --> 01:43:14,439
can't do this one.

1487
01:43:14,439 --> 01:43:36,170
I can't do it. Oh yeah. That was fancy.

1488
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:45,029
Aye and I tried and I tried and I tried

1489
01:43:45,029 --> 01:43:46,310
and I tried. I got so far.

1490
01:43:46,310 --> 01:44:14,100
That's what I wanted to do. No.

1491
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:18,069
No perfects yeah I can't get flawless.

1492
01:44:18,069 --> 01:44:22,520
No. I think there's one too many.

1493
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:28,569
Yeah it's one too many.

1494
01:44:28,569 --> 01:44:32,710
Some things never change. I like this

1495
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:33,670
guy's kind of cool looking though

1496
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:35,109
his character design.

1497
01:44:35,109 --> 01:44:37,750
Shut up Jeremy shut up.

1498
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:39,670
Stop talking. He's the worst character

1499
01:44:39,670 --> 01:44:41,350
design by far.

1500
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:42,789
What what's wrong with his character

1501
01:44:42,789 --> 01:44:49,289
design? What you hate him why?

1502
01:44:49,289 --> 01:44:50,729
What's wrong with his character

1503
01:44:50,729 --> 01:44:52,329
design? He's cool looking. He looks

1504
01:44:52,329 --> 01:44:54,220
like shit.

1505
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:58,859
He looks like corn somebody said. He does.

1506
01:44:58,859 --> 01:45:02,300
So he's cool. That wasn't too many

1507
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:12,729
hits give me a break.

1508
01:45:12,729 --> 01:45:15,609
Corn he's a corn superhero what you

1509
01:45:15,609 --> 01:45:21,350
have.

1510
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:27,909
That's it it's a corn.

1511
01:45:27,909 --> 01:45:38,279
Oh you missed it and I missed it too.

1512
01:45:38,279 --> 01:45:50,010
Fucking hell. Dude NA corn NA corn.

1513
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:56,939
I press up. NA corn.

1514
01:45:56,939 --> 01:45:58,699
Oh you got me with that little back

1515
01:45:58,699 --> 01:45:59,979
and forth there. You got me with it.

1516
01:45:59,979 --> 01:46:03,270
He got me with it and it was

1517
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:04,310
he got me with it. See you in the

1518
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:09,930
corn field. You found a new outfit to

1519
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:11,689
unlock for raptor.

1520
01:46:11,689 --> 01:46:16,020
All right let's see the outfits. Okay

1521
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:18,039
so I can be corn.

1522
01:46:18,039 --> 01:46:23,539
Error texture on wall.

1523
01:46:23,539 --> 01:46:26,840
Funky. I think I'm gonna be texture wall

1524
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:29,479
error. You kind of have to be corn.

1525
01:46:29,479 --> 01:46:37,029
Oh this one kind of hurts. Let's try

1526
01:46:37,029 --> 01:46:38,390
this one. I've been playing too much soul

1527
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:39,750
caliber that they just look like bad

1528
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:40,710
characters

1529
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:43,350
people create it. Random grid thrown

1530
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:45,340
on them.

1531
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:51,300
Well it's not. I feel like this stage has

1532
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:52,100
a higher ceiling.

1533
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:53,859
And I tried to go I just like

1534
01:46:53,859 --> 01:46:55,619
cracked my neck so hard. I like almost

1535
01:46:55,619 --> 01:47:02,859
just this whole stage is just bigger.

1536
01:47:02,859 --> 01:47:05,020
Damn it. Damn it man. I just got no

1537
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:07,260
patience. I got no patience.

1538
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:19,050
And I try I got I got no patience man.

1539
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:20,890
You got to do 100 000 miles per hour.

1540
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:23,449
100 miles per hour or or bust.

1541
01:47:23,449 --> 01:47:25,529
Oh no patience. I had no patience on

1542
01:47:25,529 --> 01:47:26,569
that one. See if I just waited I

1543
01:47:26,569 --> 01:47:27,930
could have got it.

1544
01:47:27,930 --> 01:47:41,369
I went the wrong fucking way. I have no

1545
01:47:41,369 --> 01:47:42,890
patience. All right just let just let

1546
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:43,930
him play himself.

1547
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:59,289
Don't even move. What the hell. I tried

1548
01:47:59,289 --> 01:48:00,569
to press x.

1549
01:48:00,649 --> 01:48:02,329
It was too hard to press a different

1550
01:48:02,329 --> 01:48:04,810
button. I just my fucking fat fingers

1551
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:09,880
went all over it.

1552
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:11,640
Oh by the way um if you if you don't

1553
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:12,840
know how the game mode works

1554
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,199
and the game works. So there's two

1555
01:48:14,199 --> 01:48:15,479
sides. All right you got red versus

1556
01:48:15,479 --> 01:48:16,279
blue

1557
01:48:16,279 --> 01:48:19,399
and there's a ball that is just goes

1558
01:48:19,399 --> 01:48:20,600
back and forth between the two

1559
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,199
entities.

1560
01:48:22,199 --> 01:48:24,550
Yeah that was a good one.

1561
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:26,710
And I'm fucking just can't do this

1562
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:28,069
like game mode.

1563
01:48:28,069 --> 01:48:32,680
I can't do it.

1564
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:39,140
All right like all right let me

1565
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:40,180
explain.

1566
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:43,539
It's volleyball. No no but like the the

1567
01:48:43,539 --> 01:48:45,460
core video game itself.

1568
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:47,300
It's like hey here's a porsche and

1569
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:48,739
you're on the autobahn.

1570
01:48:48,739 --> 01:48:50,899
But please go 10 miles per hour sir.

1571
01:48:50,899 --> 01:48:51,859
It's like no you're gonna you're

1572
01:48:51,859 --> 01:48:55,380
gonna go a fucking hundred.

1573
01:48:55,380 --> 01:49:05,399
No. So what you're saying is you

1574
01:49:05,399 --> 01:49:07,159
you spent all the money on a porsche

1575
01:49:07,159 --> 01:49:09,560
and you finally you know you have a

1576
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:10,439
porsche

1577
01:49:10,439 --> 01:49:11,880
and then you get there and it

1578
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:14,149
doesn't even have internet.

1579
01:49:14,149 --> 01:49:15,909
No no you had you buy a porsche and

1580
01:49:15,909 --> 01:49:16,949
it's like oh by the way this thing

1581
01:49:16,949 --> 01:49:18,949
can go zero to a hundred and point two

1582
01:49:18,949 --> 01:49:20,470
seconds. It's like holy shit wow.

1583
01:49:20,470 --> 01:49:22,630
And then they put the porsche between

1584
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:24,229
like one old lady in front of you and

1585
01:49:24,229 --> 01:49:25,750
one old lady behind you.

1586
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:27,029
And so you can't go anywhere. You just

1587
01:49:27,029 --> 01:49:29,510
to go 15 miles per hour on the

1588
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:29,989
autobahn.

1589
01:49:29,989 --> 01:49:31,109
What does that have to do with this

1590
01:49:31,109 --> 01:49:32,869
game? I don't get the comparison.

1591
01:49:32,869 --> 01:49:34,710
Because it's fast. It's a fast game

1592
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:36,229
with like back and forth crazy

1593
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:37,350
speeds and then it's like I gotta

1594
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:39,699
drive behind an old lady.

1595
01:49:39,699 --> 01:49:40,819
What's the old lady in this

1596
01:49:40,819 --> 01:49:43,220
scenario? This this game mode

1597
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:44,180
volleyball.

1598
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:46,779
We're playing it again and then we

1599
01:49:46,779 --> 01:49:48,220
can play your stupid

1600
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:51,579
casual game mode. Oh yeah.

1601
01:49:51,579 --> 01:50:00,039
Oh the casual mode. Game mode is an old

1602
01:50:00,039 --> 01:50:01,079
lady.

1603
01:50:01,079 --> 01:50:14,199
So yeah are you the old lady in this

1604
01:50:14,199 --> 01:50:15,399
scenario?

1605
01:50:15,399 --> 01:50:18,779
No you are. Because you want to go so

1606
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:19,739
slow and I want to go

1607
01:50:19,739 --> 01:50:31,430
fast on the fucking highway. That ball

1608
01:50:31,430 --> 01:50:32,710
went pretty fast

1609
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:37,659
right by you. I mean why even play

1610
01:50:37,659 --> 01:50:38,939
the other game mode if you can't

1611
01:50:38,939 --> 01:50:40,619
play the slow one? I think it'd be

1612
01:50:40,619 --> 01:50:42,140
too much for you.

1613
01:50:46,550 --> 01:50:51,819
Turn around. Psycho driver.

1614
01:50:51,819 --> 01:50:56,890
Psycho. Psycho driver.

1615
01:50:56,890 --> 01:50:59,130
What?

1616
01:50:59,130 --> 01:51:00,329
It's all about speed. That's gonna

1617
01:51:00,329 --> 01:51:09,319
keep moving around.

1618
01:51:09,319 --> 01:51:16,199
I man I saved you.

1619
01:51:16,199 --> 01:51:18,039
Just keep driving. I'm going too fast.

1620
01:51:18,039 --> 01:51:19,000
Out of the middle.

1621
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:37,659
I don't like how the stage is

1622
01:51:37,659 --> 01:51:46,840
actually moving the camera.

1623
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:48,920
Why did I hit it again?

1624
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:50,500
Why did I?

1625
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:51,939
Why did I do that again?

1626
01:51:51,939 --> 01:51:57,029
Why is it kind of good? I hit it. I hit it right there. It's done.

1627
01:51:57,029 --> 01:52:02,500
I did it. Okay I'm fine.

1628
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:08,739
Wow. Turn around. You're jumping around

1629
01:52:08,739 --> 01:52:10,420
it's it's driving me crazy the way it's

1630
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:12,020
moving the camera. Like this stage is

1631
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:15,779
just like a pixel too big.

1632
01:52:19,029 --> 01:52:22,420
Oh look out. That's fucked up because I

1633
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:24,100
have to jump then turn around in the

1634
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:25,380
air to hit it but if you press

1635
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:26,819
forward then it doesn't

1636
01:52:26,819 --> 01:52:28,260
it goes into the ground. Well I'm sorry

1637
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:31,850
I have to move. You don't.

1638
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:34,949
Yes I do. You don't have to move.

1639
01:52:34,949 --> 01:52:36,470
Don't you understand? Like I'm playing

1640
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:37,430
better now because I'm moving

1641
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:38,550
around.

1642
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:50,680
We're not just going like this.

1643
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:53,289
Wow really? Okay yeah that's really

1644
01:52:53,289 --> 01:52:54,420
dumb.

1645
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:56,340
Nice game fucking shitty

1646
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:58,260
developers. Got you.

1647
01:52:58,260 --> 01:52:59,859
We're playing on a stage. We're one

1648
01:52:59,859 --> 01:53:01,300
more of volleyball because I know

1649
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:02,420
you're you're sad you're stuck

1650
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:03,699
behind this old lady but we have to

1651
01:53:03,699 --> 01:53:05,939
play one more

1652
01:53:05,939 --> 01:53:07,220
and you're gonna you're gonna vote

1653
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:10,140
for the

1654
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:16,119
the white stage. Okay.

1655
01:53:16,119 --> 01:53:18,600
So screen doesn't it still is. Oh but

1656
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,279
I have to admit you lost one game.

1657
01:53:20,279 --> 01:53:22,119
Like come on man.

1658
01:53:22,119 --> 01:53:52,649
Okay nice catch.

1659
01:53:59,670 --> 01:54:05,989
Did I just wait did I say oof? I did

1660
01:54:05,989 --> 01:54:07,350
not say oof.

1661
01:54:07,350 --> 01:54:39,880
Did I? No. Can I aim that down? I'm so

1662
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,319
afraid to hit it down.

1663
01:54:41,319 --> 01:54:48,680
Got it. That was a great volley damn

1664
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:51,420
bad.

1665
01:54:51,420 --> 01:55:04,979
I bunted and you just slammed it.

1666
01:55:04,979 --> 01:55:07,380
Ah I did it a little too far away. What was I

1667
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:09,779
doing? What was I thinking?

1668
01:55:09,779 --> 01:55:15,020
See you did it too. Because you have to

1669
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:16,460
turn around and you have to press

1670
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:17,979
forward. I'm realizing where the suck

1671
01:55:17,979 --> 01:55:25,079
is.

1672
01:55:25,079 --> 01:55:26,119
Oh I don't know what happened there

1673
01:55:26,119 --> 01:55:53,779
but I'll take it.

1674
01:55:53,779 --> 01:55:56,340
I tried. I tried. Don't don't lose it

1675
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:59,989
here. I lost it and I fucking just.

1676
01:55:59,989 --> 01:56:14,359
Silent tryhard.

1677
01:56:14,359 --> 01:56:17,560
What the fuck was that? What the hell?

1678
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:19,720
That was just return that one.

1679
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:22,119
And I'm ready for the ball. I wasn't

1680
01:56:22,119 --> 01:56:23,079
even ready for the ball.

1681
01:56:23,079 --> 01:56:24,520
I'm going to shake it off. Sometimes

1682
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:25,800
somebody hits a home run pitcher. Come

1683
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:46,380
on.

1684
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:51,340
Curve. I went I tried to go up and it

1685
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:51,979
didn't do it.

1686
01:56:51,979 --> 01:56:54,460
I can't even karamba. I can't even

1687
01:56:54,460 --> 01:57:11,210
karumba.

1688
01:57:11,210 --> 01:57:13,130
What? Did we both reach through the

1689
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:14,649
you reached through the net. I blocked

1690
01:57:14,649 --> 01:57:15,130
you.

1691
01:57:15,130 --> 01:57:19,140
I blocked you.

1692
01:57:19,609 --> 01:57:23,210
I did it. I did it. I fucking was.

1693
01:57:23,210 --> 01:57:46,779
Spin around. You're good. Oh nice.

1694
01:57:46,779 --> 01:58:05,640
Good volley. Oh right on the.

1695
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:07,960
I was too busy marveling over the

1696
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:08,920
bounce.

1697
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:10,920
I was marveling over the bounce on

1698
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:12,760
the net and Eddie you did the curve

1699
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:13,239
ball.

1700
01:58:13,239 --> 01:58:19,699
Okay what game mode do you want?

1701
01:58:19,699 --> 01:58:21,449
Regular.

1702
01:58:21,449 --> 01:58:27,079
Regular game mode. I can't rematch

1703
01:58:27,079 --> 01:58:27,880
again.

1704
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:32,779
I have to force quit. Wow.

1705
01:58:32,779 --> 01:58:39,239
It's a shame. All right don't delete OBS.

1706
01:58:39,239 --> 01:58:44,010
Okay coming back. You have to rematch

1707
01:58:44,010 --> 01:58:47,109
before he changes the game mode.

1708
01:58:47,109 --> 01:58:57,020
Well coming back. Team reptile

1709
01:58:57,020 --> 01:59:08,039
joining your game.

1710
01:59:08,039 --> 01:59:09,800
I want to try this guy in regular

1711
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:12,819
mode. Okay. I feel like he's

1712
01:59:12,819 --> 01:59:19,659
he has potential. Where are we going?

1713
01:59:19,659 --> 01:59:21,260
Have we even played here?

1714
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:23,899
Played where? Here. I just unlocked

1715
01:59:23,899 --> 01:59:28,020
new stages. Oh okay. Is it still oh

1716
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:37,819
it's still on like super fast mode.

1717
01:59:37,819 --> 01:59:40,659
Whoa. He teleports forward and then

1718
01:59:40,659 --> 01:59:59,079
shoots it.

1719
01:59:59,079 --> 02:00:01,460
I don't. It was because it was my serve

1720
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:03,130
at auto parry.

1721
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:12,890
Oh I was trying to queue up like a

1722
02:00:12,890 --> 02:00:18,649
huge one.

1723
02:00:18,649 --> 02:00:36,300
Oh I'm afraid you keep meter in between rounds on this one.

1724
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:38,300
It's less climactic when it starts

1725
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:39,420
fast.

1726
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:42,460
Yeah it's a little too fast.

1727
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:44,699
See this is the equivalent of being

1728
02:00:44,699 --> 02:00:46,380
on the highway and you. We're doing

1729
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:48,619
tournament regulation.

1730
02:00:48,619 --> 02:00:54,140
Regulation tournament. Damn it's not.

1731
02:00:54,140 --> 02:01:02,979
Are you gonna main grid corn man?

1732
02:01:02,979 --> 02:01:04,819
Where's the other stage?

1733
02:01:04,819 --> 02:01:08,739
Um the street. The subway one.

1734
02:01:08,739 --> 02:01:10,500
Oh god that's a lot going on in the

1735
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:12,899
background.

1736
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:34,949
What the fuck? Ultra.

1737
02:01:34,949 --> 02:01:39,140
Oh god. It's what it bounced like

1738
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:40,739
like three times behind me. Those

1739
02:01:40,819 --> 02:01:57,590
bounces didn't make sense.

1740
02:01:57,590 --> 02:02:00,539
I'm just gonna let it happen. You know

1741
02:02:00,539 --> 02:02:01,420
what I'm saying? Like sometimes you just

1742
02:02:01,420 --> 02:02:04,279
gotta let. Whoa.

1743
02:02:04,279 --> 02:02:14,100
What? I promise you I did that.

1744
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:16,939
That is so confusing. Yeah that's

1745
02:02:16,939 --> 02:02:19,739
really good.

1746
02:02:19,739 --> 02:02:21,260
Oh shit I thought it hit you. Did it?

1747
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:26,260
It did. Uh oh. Uh stink ball.

1748
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:28,359
What? I don't know what happened.

1749
02:02:28,359 --> 02:02:29,880
You're cheating.

1750
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:31,880
I didn't do anything. You hey you're

1751
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:32,920
the one that you're the one playing

1752
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:41,399
with items. Items are on by default.

1753
02:02:41,399 --> 02:02:45,350
Ah I was trying to invisible.

1754
02:02:45,350 --> 02:02:54,380
What am I doing? Oh is it invisible?

1755
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:55,579
I guess.

1756
02:02:55,579 --> 02:03:09,239
That's weird.

1757
02:03:09,239 --> 02:03:12,539
Oh my god does he also say Cho?

1758
02:03:12,539 --> 02:03:14,619
Tournament standard regulation match.

1759
02:03:14,619 --> 02:03:19,289
Now who put items on?

1760
02:03:19,289 --> 02:03:21,560
Do I turn them off?

1761
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:23,239
How is that standard tournament mode?

1762
02:03:23,239 --> 02:03:28,619
Because it's on by default.

1763
02:03:28,619 --> 02:03:34,739
Oh oh you're going for uh.

1764
02:03:34,739 --> 02:03:38,840
I'm going for big boy.

1765
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:42,810
You know what you know what corn is

1766
02:03:42,810 --> 02:03:43,930
weak to?

1767
02:03:43,930 --> 02:03:48,760
Sound.

1768
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:52,119
That would be crazy. Oh crazy if true.

1769
02:03:52,119 --> 02:04:15,779
Ow my head. Oh shit.

1770
02:04:15,779 --> 02:04:34,500
Oh where did it go? Damn.

1771
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:37,140
Damn it. Oh my god it double tapped me.

1772
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:38,260
It went bang bang.

1773
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:42,220
Standing up is hard sometimes.

1774
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:44,140
Oh you keep your health between rounds.

1775
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:53,880
I didn't realize that.

1776
02:04:53,880 --> 02:05:09,109
Shit. What the hell was happening

1777
02:05:09,109 --> 02:05:10,869
there? I know I have a hover I just

1778
02:05:10,869 --> 02:05:24,090
okay I hold it that way.

1779
02:05:24,170 --> 02:05:50,779
Shit. All right this you have no health

1780
02:05:50,779 --> 02:05:52,140
man. I have one yeah I know I'm gonna

1781
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:55,340
make it perfect.

1782
02:05:55,340 --> 02:05:57,260
I knew you're gonna do it. I knew you

1783
02:05:57,260 --> 02:05:58,539
were gonna do it. I just needed a little

1784
02:05:58,539 --> 02:06:03,130
tiny tap.

1785
02:06:03,130 --> 02:06:04,409
I knew it was gonna happen too and I

1786
02:06:04,409 --> 02:06:05,449
was trying to prepare for it and

1787
02:06:05,449 --> 02:06:06,729
preparing for it is what caused me a

1788
02:06:06,729 --> 02:06:07,689
problem.

1789
02:06:07,689 --> 02:06:21,020
Play this guy. Ready. Wow didn't you

1790
02:06:21,020 --> 02:06:23,109
dress up like that for Halloween?

1791
02:06:23,109 --> 02:06:27,939
Like this? Yeah with the claw and the

1792
02:06:27,939 --> 02:06:29,460
hook.

1793
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:30,659
How would I dress up for a guy for

1794
02:06:30,659 --> 02:06:33,220
Halloween? I didn't know who he is.

1795
02:06:33,220 --> 02:06:35,220
You don't make any logical sense. I

1796
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:36,819
thought you made this game.

1797
02:06:36,819 --> 02:07:02,890
It'd be so weird if I did. Oh what

1798
02:07:02,890 --> 02:07:04,810
happened? Did you seriously parry right

1799
02:07:04,810 --> 02:07:05,449
there at the end?

1800
02:07:05,449 --> 02:07:15,340
Yeah. Oops. Wait hold on wait wait

1801
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:16,460
wait what?

1802
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:17,500
I don't think you can hit it when

1803
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:19,260
it's in the bubble. So what's in the

1804
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:20,619
bubble it can't be hit. I don't think

1805
02:07:20,619 --> 02:07:21,659
okay.

1806
02:07:21,659 --> 02:07:24,220
That's interesting. That changes things

1807
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:25,420
a little bit makes it that makes her

1808
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:36,060
special better.

1809
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:38,779
Shit. Oh man. Yeah it's pretty good.

1810
02:07:38,779 --> 02:07:43,130
That's tough.

1811
02:07:43,130 --> 02:07:45,689
That went so fast. I just threw it at

1812
02:07:45,689 --> 02:08:00,890
you.

1813
02:08:00,890 --> 02:08:16,180
Jumping into this one. Freaking noob.

1814
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:19,619
Just using throws.

1815
02:08:20,699 --> 02:08:26,060
The bros. I can't parry it if it's in

1816
02:08:26,060 --> 02:08:34,260
there okay.

1817
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:40,100
I like her. Game. Yeah I know what I'm

1818
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:41,460
playing. You don't have to tell me

1819
02:08:41,460 --> 02:08:45,420
game.

1820
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:46,859
I feel like uh I feel like star is

1821
02:08:46,859 --> 02:08:48,619
gonna play as this character

1822
02:08:48,619 --> 02:08:52,279
on his on ranked mode. I used to play

1823
02:08:52,279 --> 02:08:53,319
in the real world

1824
02:08:53,319 --> 02:08:56,970
with the the roller blades. Really? Yeah

1825
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:59,670
back in the day.

1826
02:08:59,670 --> 02:09:01,689
That's pretty cool. Did you actually

1827
02:09:01,689 --> 02:09:02,890
roll it around? Do you know how to

1828
02:09:02,890 --> 02:09:03,449
roll it?

1829
02:09:03,449 --> 02:09:06,729
Yeah I was I went to the skate parks

1830
02:09:06,729 --> 02:09:08,329
and everything.

1831
02:09:08,329 --> 02:09:14,600
Fruit dooder. An itchy eye and it's

1832
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:15,319
gonna fuck me up.

1833
02:09:15,319 --> 02:09:32,600
Itchy eye syndrome here it comes. Nice.

1834
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:34,680
Um so now that this game's uh

1835
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:36,840
like relevant again right

1836
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:37,720
do you think something like this

1837
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:39,239
would show up at EVO?

1838
02:09:39,239 --> 02:09:42,100
Um because that would be

1839
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:43,539
how cool would that be? I would love to

1840
02:09:43,539 --> 02:09:44,899
see this at EVO but I don't think it

1841
02:09:44,899 --> 02:09:48,859
will.

1842
02:09:48,859 --> 02:09:49,979
I thought you were either gonna. That'd be

1843
02:09:49,979 --> 02:09:54,520
so fun. Just put it in like the

1844
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:56,039
comedy slot right? Isn't there always

1845
02:09:56,039 --> 02:09:57,079
like a comedy slot

1846
02:09:57,079 --> 02:10:03,529
for EVO? Is there? I don't know. Is there like just a comedy slot?

1847
02:10:03,529 --> 02:10:04,970
I mean there's a lot of side tournaments

1848
02:10:04,970 --> 02:10:06,090
that are run that aren't on the

1849
02:10:06,090 --> 02:10:07,449
main stage.

1850
02:10:07,449 --> 02:10:08,649
So that they don't do like a four

1851
02:10:08,649 --> 02:10:10,170
fun like just little fun like

1852
02:10:10,170 --> 02:10:12,649
session it's all just all competitive?

1853
02:10:12,649 --> 02:10:16,390
Uh no. Like what if they think they

1854
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:17,670
got like Burger King to sponsor it

1855
02:10:17,670 --> 02:10:19,029
and you got like

1856
02:10:19,029 --> 02:10:20,789
like three like meals for like a

1857
02:10:20,789 --> 02:10:22,149
week or something?

1858
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:25,909
Free meals for a week. I don't know.

1859
02:10:25,909 --> 02:10:29,380
Stand-up comedy at EVO. Yeah. Who's the

1860
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:30,819

Fuck. Yeah wowee wowee wowee wow.

Oh no.

1866
02:11:00,409 --> 02:11:02,859
Oh I don't know what to do.

1867
02:11:02,859 --> 02:11:09,420
Oh my god I jumped right into it. I

have a much harder time.

1870
02:11:11,739 --> 02:11:16,069
I think it's the skin. Does Jerma think

1871
02:11:16,069 --> 02:11:18,729

you're right in the middle.

1936
02:15:05,859 --> 02:15:17,739
Or you can move. Oh you saw that

1937
02:15:17,739 --> 02:15:19,500
coming from a mile away didn't you?

1938
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:32,979
Oh my god. What the hell what the

1939
02:15:32,979 --> 02:15:34,260
fuck?

1940
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:36,180
That like did a full circle it came

1941
02:15:36,180 --> 02:15:37,380
backwards.

1942
02:15:37,380 --> 02:15:47,800
Who grabbed it? I did.

1943
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:49,640
Oh I think I think gamer exhaustion is

1944
02:15:49,640 --> 02:16:00,060
starting to get in here.

1945
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:01,659
I don't know what happened. I think you

1946
02:16:01,659 --> 02:16:03,180
grabbed it out of my hand. I caught it

1947
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:04,699
like right after you hit it I

1948
02:16:04,699 --> 02:16:05,739
caught it.

1949
02:16:05,739 --> 02:16:17,220
Ow my joints. I need to drink a

1950
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:18,979
stamina potion.

1951
02:16:18,979 --> 02:16:21,289
God if only those existed in real

1952
02:16:21,289 --> 02:16:38,870
life. Come get some.

1953
02:16:38,870 --> 02:16:41,989
Oh come on you bastard you timed it

1954
02:16:41,989 --> 02:16:44,069
you waited for it and you flicked it.

1955
02:16:44,069 --> 02:16:47,959
You flicked the button and it was in.

1956
02:16:47,959 --> 02:16:49,639
Yeah you got you got stamina potions

1957
02:16:49,639 --> 02:16:51,000
over there. I don't have any here.

1958
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,360
Dude I took a stamina potion right

1959
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:54,540
before this.

1960
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:57,180
And you had the stamina copy. Did you

1961
02:16:57,180 --> 02:16:58,379
not? No but

1962
02:16:58,379 --> 02:17:00,379
but that but but caught the stamina

1963
02:17:00,379 --> 02:17:02,299
coffee puts you up to like a hundred

1964
02:17:02,299 --> 02:17:03,420
percent stamina.

1965
02:17:03,420 --> 02:17:05,340
But then you drain rate is like plus

1966
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:06,540
a hundred percent. What are you?

1967
02:17:06,540 --> 02:17:08,860
So I I would have a hundred percent

1968
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:11,379
stamina.

1969
02:17:11,379 --> 02:17:14,170
What? The German that lived in Boston

1970
02:17:14,170 --> 02:17:16,250
didn't do drugs.

1971
02:17:16,250 --> 02:17:20,420
Why are you bringing us back here? I

1972
02:17:20,420 --> 02:17:22,260
don't know. I have fun doing this.

1973
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:31,799
Drugs are bad. I don't do I don't do

1974
02:17:31,799 --> 02:17:33,079
drugs.

1975
02:17:33,079 --> 02:17:36,729
Don't listen to this dweeb. Oh it's the

1976
02:17:36,729 --> 02:17:37,930
beach ball again. I didn't even

1977
02:17:37,930 --> 02:17:39,209
realize. I didn't mean to have a

1978
02:17:39,209 --> 02:17:40,649
beach ball.

1979
02:17:40,649 --> 02:17:46,940
You're not gonna like respond to the

1980
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:48,459
fact that I spelled you dweeb. I

1981
02:17:48,459 --> 02:17:49,659
don't

1982
02:17:49,659 --> 02:17:54,250
have a problem with that.

1983
02:17:54,250 --> 02:18:01,459
Oh you dweeb.

1984
02:18:01,459 --> 02:18:14,020
Bunted it for you. Damn.

1985
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:19,430
This beat is pumping. Can I score

1986
02:18:19,430 --> 02:18:20,629
a point

1987
02:18:20,629 --> 02:18:23,829
real fast? I can't. I tried. Should I

1988
02:18:23,829 --> 02:18:25,350
should you? I mean there. Yeah I let

1989
02:18:25,350 --> 02:18:26,870
you do it. I was like

1990
02:18:26,870 --> 02:18:28,149
I was like you know it's time for him

1991
02:18:28,149 --> 02:18:32,360
to get one.

1992
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:34,200
Ah too bad it wasn't at the right

1993
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:39,829
spot.

1994
02:18:39,829 --> 02:18:53,909
Ah. Oh fuck fuck fuck. Give me one

1995
02:18:53,909 --> 02:18:55,270
that's fucking to beat.

1996
02:18:55,270 --> 02:19:17,639
Oh going for a little move there.

1997
02:19:17,639 --> 02:19:32,440
Oh just out of reach. Fucking beach

1998
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:35,079
ball.

1999
02:19:35,079 --> 02:19:40,010
No. I actually with beach ball I don't

2000
02:19:40,010 --> 02:19:41,129
like if you had two people I don't

2001
02:19:41,129 --> 02:19:42,889
know how you'd ever score.

2002
02:19:43,719 --> 02:19:46,520
That would be very hard. Nice. Unless you

2003
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:47,159
have some

2004
02:19:47,159 --> 02:19:55,510
superb extreme donors spotted.

2005
02:19:55,510 --> 02:19:58,389
Nice okay he's finally getting into

2006
02:19:58,389 --> 02:20:15,370
it isn't he?

2007
02:20:15,370 --> 02:20:24,659
Oh that's unfortunate. Damn I was

2008
02:20:24,659 --> 02:20:25,860
waiting for the defense I couldn't

2009
02:20:25,860 --> 02:20:40,809
get it.

2010
02:20:40,809 --> 02:20:42,409
Shit I tried to blunt it up higher

2011
02:20:42,409 --> 02:20:47,510
so you couldn't get it.

2012
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:58,760
Okay I jumped over just a little too

2013
02:20:58,760 --> 02:20:59,479
high. Oh

2014
02:20:59,479 --> 02:21:00,680
I can't believe you grabbed it a

2015
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:03,639
second time. Oh that was it.

2016
02:21:03,639 --> 02:21:06,680
That was it.

2017
02:21:09,829 --> 02:21:11,590
What game mode? What's the situation? What are we

2018
02:21:11,590 --> 02:21:12,889
doing?

2019
02:21:12,889 --> 02:21:14,649
Um I don't know what do you think? I

2020
02:21:14,649 --> 02:21:16,299
like that.

2021
02:21:16,299 --> 02:21:19,690
You having fun? I like that. How long

2022
02:21:19,690 --> 02:21:20,170
have we been?

2023
02:21:20,170 --> 02:21:22,329
I mean my stream turned off. I turned

2024
02:21:22,329 --> 02:21:23,290
off my stream

2025
02:21:23,290 --> 02:21:25,049
accidentally so two and a half hours.

2026
02:21:25,049 --> 02:21:33,750
22 minutes.

2027
02:21:33,750 --> 02:21:40,739
222. You cheated super hard there

2028
02:21:40,739 --> 02:21:47,370
which is what because I bumped it.

2029
02:21:48,250 --> 02:21:52,870
I just passed it to you. This with four

2030
02:21:52,870 --> 02:21:53,829
people would be

2031
02:21:53,829 --> 02:21:56,069
I think actually really hard to score a

2032
02:21:56,069 --> 02:21:57,590
goal. It would be like just pretty

2033
02:21:57,590 --> 02:21:58,229
random.

2034
02:21:58,229 --> 02:22:01,899
Yeah it'd be a lot of like mashing

2035
02:22:01,899 --> 02:22:02,940
next to the goal post

2036
02:22:02,940 --> 02:22:05,979
and getting parries I assume.

2037
02:22:05,979 --> 02:22:11,270
It'd actually be kind of doable with

2038
02:22:11,270 --> 02:22:13,510
the baseball though.

2039
02:22:13,510 --> 02:22:25,270
I thought that was too low. Play lego

2040
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:26,389
island.

2041
02:22:26,389 --> 02:22:40,420
What?

2042
02:22:40,899 --> 02:22:45,059
That's like just that's just too much.

2043
02:22:45,059 --> 02:22:51,110
I will somebody I will never give up

2044
02:22:51,110 --> 02:22:52,549
trying to get me to play

2045
02:22:52,549 --> 02:23:01,420
lego island. Can you guys play lethal

2046
02:23:01,420 --> 02:23:02,700
league blaze?

2047
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:08,379
I don't know. Soon we'll play it

2048
02:23:08,379 --> 02:23:13,290
after this.

2049
02:23:13,290 --> 02:23:18,920
I'm facing the fucking wrong way. What

2050
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:28,170
the hell am I doing?

2051
02:23:28,170 --> 02:23:33,059
I'd be down for lego island to be

2052
02:23:33,059 --> 02:23:34,659
honest.

2053
02:23:34,659 --> 02:23:40,520
Lego island. I don't think

2054
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:41,799
I can even run that game on my

2055
02:23:41,799 --> 02:23:43,719
fucking computer.

2056
02:23:43,719 --> 02:23:52,579
Oh fuck whoops a daisy whoops a daisy.

2057
02:23:52,579 --> 02:24:05,510
Dinosaur.

2058
02:24:05,510 --> 02:24:18,469
Do it like you do drugs. Yeah like

2059
02:24:18,469 --> 02:24:19,030
when you get

2060
02:24:19,030 --> 02:24:20,389
next to the next sometimes it's hard

2061
02:24:20,389 --> 02:24:22,149
to even tell like what happened

2062
02:24:22,149 --> 02:24:23,030
there.

2063
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:41,610
I thought you're gonna hit it up.

2064
02:24:41,610 --> 02:24:51,000
Oh okay all right nice.

2065
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:56,920
Oh and he literally missed that.

2066
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:59,239
Now that's he has a snort key mode oh

2067
02:24:59,239 --> 02:25:02,100
god.

2068
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:06,629
I can't fucking break. So what's the

2069
02:25:06,629 --> 02:25:07,750
deal?

2070
02:25:07,750 --> 02:25:09,670
What's what deal? Another you want to

2071
02:25:09,670 --> 02:25:11,989
keep doing this one? I enjoy this.

2072
02:25:11,989 --> 02:25:13,829
Okay I'm gonna change character ah

2073
02:25:13,829 --> 02:25:15,659
never mind.

2074
02:25:15,659 --> 02:25:19,020
I'm not gonna change character. It's a

2075
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:20,219
very it's a very uh

2076
02:25:20,219 --> 02:25:24,649
engaging you know tug of war. It's a very

2077
02:25:24,649 --> 02:25:25,530
engaging

2078
02:25:25,530 --> 02:25:40,870
game. Tug of war back and forth. I was

2079
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:42,229
like trying to wait for you to do.

2080
02:25:42,229 --> 02:25:43,350
Yeah I was trying to wait for you

2081
02:25:43,350 --> 02:25:44,309
to do.

2082
02:25:44,309 --> 02:25:50,889
We're getting to that next level.

2083
02:25:50,889 --> 02:25:58,870
Ability sucks. You already had enough to

2084
02:25:58,870 --> 02:26:00,420
use that?

2085
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:14,950
Yeah. Suck dude you suck. I'm gonna do

2086
02:26:14,950 --> 02:26:15,750
like the form

2087
02:26:15,750 --> 02:26:21,750
formation. Oh oh.

2088
02:26:21,750 --> 02:26:40,520
You suck. You suck.

2089
02:26:43,979 --> 02:26:47,899
Fucking move. I had to use mine more. That move is so good.

2090
02:26:47,899 --> 02:26:55,989
Okay okay see now that I'm now that I'm

2091
02:26:55,989 --> 02:26:57,350
close to losing everyone knows from

2092
02:26:57,350 --> 02:26:58,870
Soul Calibur then now now's when we

2093
02:26:58,870 --> 02:27:00,229
try. Now's when we come back we

2094
02:27:00,229 --> 02:27:01,989
kick your ass.

2095
02:27:01,989 --> 02:27:05,479
And maybe I'll go there and kick your

2096
02:27:05,479 --> 02:27:07,850
ass.

2097
02:27:07,850 --> 02:27:09,049
Here's what you know here's where it

2098
02:27:09,049 --> 02:27:11,450
really you know balls to the walls.

2099
02:27:11,450 --> 02:27:13,049
Maybe you'll see me on the

2100
02:27:13,049 --> 02:27:14,889
battlefield and smash to kick your

2101
02:27:14,889 --> 02:27:31,670
ass.

2102
02:27:31,670 --> 02:27:34,069
Yeah learning from the

2103
02:27:34,069 --> 02:27:42,379
learning from the master I see. Does

2104
02:27:42,379 --> 02:27:44,620
that thing just auto target?

2105
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:48,340
No I have to I have to aim it. I

2106
02:27:48,340 --> 02:27:50,739
have to like actually aim the thing.

2107
02:27:50,739 --> 02:28:00,739
Press Q to make Candyman's mouth

2108
02:28:00,739 --> 02:28:01,940
move. Well I'm using a controller. Was

2109
02:28:01,940 --> 02:28:02,979
it on controller? Are you using

2110
02:28:02,979 --> 02:28:03,700
controller?

2111
02:28:03,700 --> 02:28:05,940
Yeah. Okay just making sure we're on the

2112
02:28:05,940 --> 02:28:07,540
same level here.

2113
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:10,229
I mean you you could have used like

2114
02:28:10,229 --> 02:28:11,989
the I'm using keyboard and mouse like

2115
02:28:11,989 --> 02:28:12,870
to your advantage you know what I

2116
02:28:12,870 --> 02:28:13,909
mean?

2117
02:28:13,909 --> 02:28:15,979
Whatever. How would you play this game

2118
02:28:15,979 --> 02:28:17,340
reliably with keyboard and mouse?

2119
02:28:17,340 --> 02:28:20,979
I feel like it'd be very hard.

2120
02:28:20,979 --> 02:28:25,799
Just do it. Just do it. Nike just do

2121
02:28:25,799 --> 02:28:26,840
it.

2122
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:50,420
Oh I gotta use that better. Really?

2123
02:28:50,420 --> 02:28:59,829
Oh oh shit. That's why we're playing the chief ass.

2124
02:28:59,829 --> 02:29:02,649
All right let's see. I gotta be

2125
02:29:02,729 --> 02:29:07,530
ready for that one.

2126
02:29:07,530 --> 02:29:08,969
And you're just going to teleport it

2127
02:29:08,969 --> 02:29:15,799
inside the goal.

2128
02:29:15,799 --> 02:29:18,360
No fuck oh no. Okay I gotta watch your

2129
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:19,559
special leader.

2130
02:29:19,559 --> 02:29:43,530
Oh I let go of it too early. Damn.

2131
02:29:43,530 --> 02:29:46,120
Hold on. What? I'm trying to figure out

2132
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:47,959
like what actually makes me

2133
02:29:47,959 --> 02:29:52,420
climb it. Can I do that? No it's his

2134
02:29:52,420 --> 02:29:54,100
thing. I think you think I can climb up

2135
02:29:54,100 --> 02:29:55,299
it but he like falls off and it's

2136
02:29:55,299 --> 02:29:56,819
really weird.

2137
02:29:56,819 --> 02:29:58,920
I don't know maybe I can't stand on

2138
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:00,360
the scoreboard.

2139
02:30:00,360 --> 02:30:11,559
Okay. I don't know if I can even get it

2140
02:30:11,559 --> 02:30:12,520
from you

2141
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:21,700
at that point. Maybe not. Oh fuck.

2142
02:30:21,700 --> 02:30:47,770
Fuck. Oh fuck.

2143
02:30:47,770 --> 02:30:50,569
No not this time. I was trying so hard

2144
02:30:50,569 --> 02:30:57,500
to pay attention to it.

2145
02:30:57,500 --> 02:31:21,610
Wow. No this is so stupid now.

2146
02:31:21,610 --> 02:31:22,889
It really is. We're just like doing

2147
02:31:22,889 --> 02:31:25,690
the thing to each other.

2148
02:31:25,690 --> 02:31:26,969
I'll gain meter faster than you'll

2149
02:31:26,969 --> 02:31:33,020
gain meter.

2150
02:31:37,209 --> 02:31:59,750
Oh it's too much. Oh no.

2151
02:31:59,750 --> 02:32:07,139
Almost tied it up. Come on now. Set it

2152
02:32:07,139 --> 02:32:10,379
up for me.

2153
02:32:10,379 --> 02:32:13,420
I did it the wrong way. I did it the wrong way. I did it the wrong way.

2154
02:32:13,420 --> 02:32:16,700
Oh shit I let go of it.

2155
02:32:16,700 --> 02:32:27,959
No. All right let's do it.

2156
02:32:27,959 --> 02:32:31,159
You son of a bitch. I should have

2157
02:32:31,159 --> 02:32:32,280
known you were just

2158
02:32:32,280 --> 02:32:44,620
gaming meter there. Oh you fucking threw me out of the bus.

2159
02:32:44,620 --> 02:32:53,510
Good game. This is all for the curtains? Yeah we gotta tally up every

2160
02:32:53,510 --> 02:32:54,790
single win and loss.

2161
02:32:54,870 --> 02:33:02,280
Well then I obviously win. Let's go with

2162
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:04,440
who else would be fun in this mode? Are

2163
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:06,440
we still playing this mode?

2164
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:09,219
Um what's the other one that we didn't

2165
02:33:09,219 --> 02:33:13,879
do? Did we do all the game modes?

2166
02:33:13,879 --> 02:33:16,920
Maybe go back to original. It's dark in here. I gotta turn the fucking

2167
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:23,530
lights on. I heard what Switch does but I

2168
02:33:23,530 --> 02:33:32,649
played him a lot before. There we go. Turn on the lights. There

2169
02:33:32,649 --> 02:33:39,819
they are. Hey there they are. All right is

2170
02:33:39,819 --> 02:33:42,059
this what we do? Is this regular mode?

2171
02:33:42,459 --> 02:33:52,489
We're doing regular mode? Oh yeah he can like hit it over

2172
02:33:52,489 --> 02:33:56,860
his head behind him. What was this thing?

2173
02:33:56,860 --> 02:34:00,620
Oh somebody said press Q? Well I'm not gonna do that. I'm in the middle of an

2174
02:34:00,620 --> 02:34:13,079
intense video game right now. I remember that.

2175
02:34:13,079 --> 02:34:23,459
Oh I just my brain just goes to it. I forget what Switch flip is even

2176
02:34:23,459 --> 02:34:28,139
doing. When you do a special what does

2177
02:34:28,139 --> 02:34:34,200
it do? Do you know? I don't know. Hey do you see in the back right at

2178
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:36,920
the top of the screen in the background?

2179
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:40,760
I know you can't look right now but TF2 play TF2.

2180
02:34:40,760 --> 02:34:44,120
Is that what it says? That's what it says. I've got the logo. Oh it's the

2181
02:34:44,120 --> 02:34:54,170
oh it's the Team Fortress logo. Is that what that is? Is that

2182
02:34:54,170 --> 02:34:57,690
like an is that an homage? What else would it be? I think you

2183
02:34:57,690 --> 02:35:00,729
may have found a fucking pretty cool homage dude.

2184
02:35:00,729 --> 02:35:08,790
Oh you see that blimp in the background? Please play TF2.

2185
02:35:08,790 --> 02:35:11,750
Tense but that's what the the aliens of the monsters the robots come out

2186
02:35:11,750 --> 02:35:26,149
of the man-averse machine. Oh my lord. Oh my lord I just watched

2187
02:35:26,149 --> 02:35:32,040
myself get hit by fucking four cars in a row.

2188
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:39,819
Oh man do you see that baseball? Remember the Sandman?

2189
02:35:39,819 --> 02:35:42,620
No you have to make all the references to Fortnite now that's how

2190
02:35:42,620 --> 02:35:47,579
it works. Oh Fortnite? Did you just default Fortnite dance?

2191
02:35:47,579 --> 02:35:55,829
No that's been vetoed. That has been vetoed.

2192
02:35:55,829 --> 02:36:03,290
Good landing. Hey pick stage landing. Tilted towers.

2193
02:36:03,290 --> 02:36:06,729
That was a good initial. You did a good initial there man.

2194
02:36:06,729 --> 02:36:11,530
But was it enough? No I'm too big. I'm too big.

2195
02:36:11,530 --> 02:36:25,670
I would call it a perfect a perfect forward smash. If his super wasn't dumb.

2196
02:36:25,670 --> 02:36:29,540
Are you sure you're like doing it right? Maybe are you sure there's not

2197
02:36:29,540 --> 02:36:40,409
something else you need to do? Sure. Wow. Oh though he does get

2198
02:36:40,409 --> 02:36:46,889
okay I'm kind of understanding. Okay. Wait you can fly?

2199
02:36:46,889 --> 02:36:55,180
You can fly. I can fly. That's really weird. I can fly. I can fly.

2200
02:36:55,180 --> 02:37:00,459
Do you have to tap uh just tap A or anything? Just hold A and I'm flying.

2201
02:37:00,459 --> 02:37:19,940
Oh shit oh shit. Oh I got hit in the same head.

2202
02:37:20,420 --> 02:37:33,510
It's so weird though. Oh I didn't want to taunt.

2203
02:37:33,510 --> 02:38:00,870
Well here it is. Oh that was that was close. Can you parry without full

2204
02:38:00,870 --> 02:38:03,270
meter? Like I was worried about it. I was like wait he doesn't have full. I

2205
02:38:03,270 --> 02:38:06,469
don't know what the rules are here. I know it drains your meter but I

2206
02:38:06,469 --> 02:38:09,430
didn't know if you if you need to have the full one.

2207
02:38:09,430 --> 02:38:13,850
I don't know that's a good question. Um is someone's asking is there an

2208
02:38:13,850 --> 02:38:17,930
option for it to be one hit like the first game? Can you like

2209
02:38:17,930 --> 02:38:28,280
make it one hit and you're out? Or is it only HP? Wait what did you

2210
02:38:28,280 --> 02:38:31,399
ask? I said is there an option to make

2211
02:38:31,399 --> 02:38:33,799
it like the original game? Oh yeah there is.

2212
02:38:33,879 --> 02:38:38,069
Oh you can. Yeah. Would you like it that way?

2213
02:38:38,069 --> 02:39:02,170
Um we can do it after. Oh it's the rocket.

2214
02:39:02,170 --> 02:39:14,440
Ah my brain broke. It's the rocket. And he's gonna build it over there

2215
02:39:14,440 --> 02:39:30,010
aren't you? I don't think I like this man.

2216
02:39:30,010 --> 02:39:44,760
He's just not for me. He seems a little slow.

2217
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:53,100
Holy fuck. Oh all right. So yeah it goes

2218
02:39:53,100 --> 02:39:56,139
just right to the other person. Yeah but people are telling me

2219
02:39:56,139 --> 02:39:59,260
that you can bump out of it so that you don't always know that it's going to

2220
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:15,239
come get you and that that helps make them better.

2221
02:40:15,239 --> 02:40:31,860
Oh I was a little confused on exactly what happened there.

2222
02:40:31,860 --> 02:40:56,100
Oh oh good. We haven't seen this one yet. It's two balls.

2223
02:40:56,100 --> 02:40:59,620
It's two fucking balls at the same time.

2224
02:40:59,620 --> 02:41:10,979
Oh I'll see ball. Yeah I don't like he doesn't have a ping pong.

2225
02:41:10,979 --> 02:41:16,899
And I'll uh use HP turned it off. Somebody said there's a dev in the

2226
02:41:16,899 --> 02:41:21,159
chats. Really? Is that is that or are we just

2227
02:41:21,159 --> 02:41:27,000
getting named? Yeah no I made this. Don't you remember like the last couple

2228
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:30,280
of months where I've been putting like dev updates to you?

2229
02:41:30,280 --> 02:41:33,819
I've been snail mailing them to you. Do you not read them?

2230
02:41:33,819 --> 02:41:36,940
Yeah. No I mean I just kind of put them on

2231
02:41:36,940 --> 02:41:43,879
like the counter. I think I opened one of them. I

2232
02:41:43,879 --> 02:41:46,360
thought it was just bills or something.

2233
02:41:46,520 --> 02:41:54,780
Oh he died. He turned it on. I told you. All right. Wow. Now we get to prove just how

2234
02:41:54,780 --> 02:42:11,899
bad we really are. Now we have to play like gods. Well I

2235
02:42:11,899 --> 02:42:37,209
bunted it and it immediately killed me. Bunt. Oh shit. Oh you bounced it.

2236
02:42:37,209 --> 02:42:57,379
Oh boy you bounced it. Yeah he bounced it man. Oh my lord.

2237
02:42:57,379 --> 02:43:11,510
What? I thought I had it. Oh is there like a delay after you throw?

2238
02:43:11,510 --> 02:43:26,739
Uh it's like a it's like if you do an actual throwing animation.

2239
02:43:26,819 --> 02:43:34,680
Ah damn. Okay I need the dev to confirm that my my character actually says

2240
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:44,809
says Aiyah and Cho. Is he actually saying Cho or my hearing thing?

2241
02:43:44,809 --> 02:43:59,579
Damn and I tried to grab it out of midair and I was being a little funky.

2242
02:43:59,579 --> 02:44:03,100
What? You just made the eye got hit and died noise.

2243
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:10,309
No I didn't. You didn't. I'm dead. Definitely saying Aiyah.

2244
02:44:10,309 --> 02:44:14,809
That's all I need to know. Never heard any elderly Chinese player say Cho.

2245
02:44:14,809 --> 02:44:18,969
Uh Cho is like good ball and Cho Lee is good ball again.

2246
02:44:18,969 --> 02:44:22,729
I hear it a lot in competitive like tournaments.

2247
02:44:22,729 --> 02:44:33,159
That's interesting. Like good point. Well game point match point here it

2248
02:44:33,159 --> 02:44:57,850
comes. Ah good game good game good game.

2249
02:44:57,850 --> 02:45:01,770
All right what do you say? What do I do? I like that a lot.

2250
02:45:01,770 --> 02:45:04,969
I just want to make it more points because it's quick.

2251
02:45:05,290 --> 02:45:10,440
Points to 12. Yeah I'm gonna talk about the green screen after

2252
02:45:10,440 --> 02:45:14,979
we play lethal league blaze. The new game.

2253
02:45:14,979 --> 02:45:19,780
New lethal league. It's very fun. I'm going to try

2254
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:23,780
so hard. How much is this game? What's the price point on this one?

2255
02:45:23,780 --> 02:45:32,979
Uh I don't remember. I thought it was like 20.

2256
02:45:32,979 --> 02:45:42,180
Aye nice. 20 bucks. 20 bucks. We got a fucking endless amount of

2257
02:45:42,180 --> 02:45:45,299
activity here. Holy fuck that was much faster than

2258
02:45:45,299 --> 02:45:52,139
I thought it was. Oh my god I bunted it down just so you

2259
02:45:52,139 --> 02:45:55,450
could kill me.

2260
02:45:56,790 --> 02:46:09,940
Me too. Yeah just like that. Okay try it.

2261
02:46:09,940 --> 02:46:17,459
I'm trying to like legend of Zelda to you.

2262
02:46:17,459 --> 02:46:24,840
Oh my god. I'm trying to do the uh the link down smash.

2263
02:46:24,840 --> 02:46:50,549
What the fuck happened to me? Because I served it at parry.

2264
02:46:50,549 --> 02:46:54,409
I didn't even see you hit it a second time. I did my special.

2265
02:46:54,489 --> 02:46:59,750
Remember my special comes out and then comes back in. Oh

2266
02:46:59,750 --> 02:47:08,379
nice. Excellent work. What? Why? I don't know. I bunted the shit out of

2267
02:47:08,379 --> 02:47:18,149
that. That second was much faster than I

2268
02:47:18,149 --> 02:47:20,790
thought it would be.

2269
02:47:24,629 --> 02:47:32,809
Handcuff man. This guy's font man. Why is everybody saying spy party?

2270
02:47:32,809 --> 02:47:43,979
Spy party. Spy party. Oh my god. You jumped in. I was like he's gonna hit it

2271
02:47:43,979 --> 02:47:49,209
down. Uh like that and okay. Jesus

2272
02:47:49,209 --> 02:48:00,819
Christ. All right. Oh my god. She was like where the random

2273
02:48:00,819 --> 02:48:04,420
random xd. Oh I'm telling it's gamer fatigue. Gamer fatigue? No.

2274
02:48:04,420 --> 02:48:11,079
It's just. It's gamer fatigue man. The throw is weird.

2275
02:48:11,079 --> 02:48:22,340
You gonna let me pogo this? It's not mine. Oh my god. What am I doing over here? I'm

2276
02:48:22,340 --> 02:48:36,469
trying to like steal the ball from you. Oh my god. Are you telling me you really

2277
02:48:36,469 --> 02:48:39,750
aimed those? Because that's just like it feels like it tracks

2278
02:48:39,750 --> 02:48:47,559
exactly wherever I am. I just hook shot at you. It's called the sniper.

2279
02:48:47,559 --> 02:48:51,239
It's never like it's never slightly off. It's always just

2280
02:48:51,239 --> 02:49:05,190
right where it needs to be. Spy party. Spy party. Spy. I don't even

2281
02:49:05,190 --> 02:49:24,950
have a spy party on this computer. I had full meter. I think

2282
02:49:25,030 --> 02:49:35,940
if you parry somebody else you get full meter. I ya indeed.

2283
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:58,200
This is why this character embodies me. Oh that was.

2284
02:49:58,200 --> 02:50:18,780
Ding. Boop. Oh it really is like a falcon punch. I get it.

2285
02:50:18,780 --> 02:50:24,040
Attention germ reviewers. No I'm not reading that.

2286
02:50:28,469 --> 02:50:47,180
Shit. I'm not reading that. Oh I didn't know you had it.

2287
02:50:47,180 --> 02:50:51,260
Yeah if you hit it like before you get the final one that counts as your

2288
02:50:51,260 --> 02:50:55,420
final hit. So if you run three bars the next hit will be enough to use it.

2289
02:50:56,139 --> 02:51:03,209
Damn I see. Damn he's getting on to me fellas. He's on to me fellas and lads.

2290
02:51:03,850 --> 02:51:05,930
Fellas and ladies. Fellas and lads.

2291
02:51:18,629 --> 02:51:21,930
Oh boy I'm just throwing. I'm throwing it here.

2292
02:51:22,489 --> 02:51:29,340
The bunting in front of people. Not a good idea.

2293
02:51:31,850 --> 02:51:35,370
Whatever that was not a good idea. I don't know it's gamer fatigue.

2294
02:51:40,600 --> 02:51:45,180
It's gamer fatigue man. It's fucking gamer fatigue.

2295
02:51:46,219 --> 02:51:55,590
Gamer fatigue. Gamer fatigue. Not just really fast.

2296
02:51:55,590 --> 02:51:57,590
Sometimes it throws surprise.

2297
02:52:06,379 --> 02:52:10,139
Oh what the hell was that? That was like a super ball.

2298
02:52:10,139 --> 02:52:18,889
Fucking I was trying to time it.

2299
02:52:18,889 --> 02:52:31,989
You just need one point.

2300
02:52:43,110 --> 02:52:45,190
I thought you were going to throw it. I thought you were going to do the thing

2301
02:52:45,190 --> 02:52:49,190
where you just try to blanket on me very quickly. I'm going to try to throw it back at you.

2302
02:52:49,190 --> 02:52:51,030
Is there actually the one character we hadn't seen?

2303
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:53,879
Have we? I don't have.

2304
02:52:55,159 --> 02:52:56,280
There's one other guy right?

2305
02:52:57,319 --> 02:52:59,239
Is there? I mean there's this dude.

2306
02:52:59,239 --> 02:53:00,120
Oh oh yeah.

2307
02:53:03,559 --> 02:53:04,360
Let's try somebody else.

2308
02:53:06,459 --> 02:53:09,639
I'm gonna play baseball guy. What's his special? What is baseball man special?

2309
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:14,440
I don't know. He spins and hits and then it does nothing.

2310
02:53:16,489 --> 02:53:17,049
Sounds fun.

2311
02:53:17,690 --> 02:53:21,590
I can't remember. I used to play him a lot.

2312
02:53:21,590 --> 02:53:23,750
So I remember being good but I didn't. I don't.

2313
02:53:23,750 --> 02:53:25,829
Yeah I think it just goes faster.

2314
02:53:29,879 --> 02:53:45,139
Jesus fuck man. I didn't know you were going to activate it.

2315
02:53:56,420 --> 02:54:01,299
My god that was the most embarrassing round.

2316
02:54:02,659 --> 02:54:04,180
Even worse than the volleyball earlier.

2317
02:54:05,940 --> 02:54:07,750
It's gamer fatigue.

2318
02:54:11,819 --> 02:54:12,780
I thought it was gonna.

2319
02:54:14,700 --> 02:54:15,979
I thought it was gonna get you.

2320
02:54:17,180 --> 02:54:19,819
That would have been ultra ultra gamer embarrassment.

2321
02:54:26,629 --> 02:54:27,110
Jesus.

2322
02:54:33,850 --> 02:54:35,049
Oh I jumped into it.

2323
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:37,639
It was weird that you like hit it up.

2324
02:54:42,940 --> 02:54:44,059
What the fuck am I doing here?

2325
02:54:53,590 --> 02:54:55,750
Wow that was quick.

2326
02:54:55,750 --> 02:55:06,360
Yeah oh man.

2327
02:55:07,159 --> 02:55:07,959
I just threw you.

2328
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:09,399
Yeah I didn't turn around.

2329
02:55:09,399 --> 02:55:10,440
I just threw you over there.

2330
02:55:26,860 --> 02:55:27,360
Nice.

2331
02:55:34,180 --> 02:55:38,250
Whoa I think you can just go any direction and it goes faster.

2332
02:55:38,969 --> 02:55:43,190
Yeah god damn it what the fuck am I thinking?

2333
02:55:43,190 --> 02:55:45,270
I just keep trying to go over that bonehead play.

2334
02:55:45,989 --> 02:56:06,620
Is Jermey even trying anymore?

2335
02:56:06,620 --> 02:56:07,120
Yeah.

2336
02:56:11,319 --> 02:56:12,680
Oh Jesus.

2337
02:56:25,659 --> 02:56:26,159
Damn.

2338
02:56:37,879 --> 02:56:39,239
You got that twice in a row didn't you?

2339
02:56:46,069 --> 02:56:47,110
I'm surprised I didn't get that.

2340
02:56:47,750 --> 02:56:49,030
Kind of right where I was swinging.

2341
02:56:49,909 --> 02:56:58,649
I was waiting for it.

2342
02:56:59,129 --> 02:57:02,739
Oh my god.

2343
02:57:05,989 --> 02:57:06,489
Didn't work.

2344
02:57:19,239 --> 02:57:20,600
Nice fucking play.

2345
02:57:20,600 --> 02:57:21,879
I was I knew it.

2346
02:57:23,450 --> 02:57:26,020
I should have just backed off.

2347
02:57:26,020 --> 02:57:34,020
Dinked him.

2348
02:57:34,020 --> 02:57:49,690
I'm trying to grab it in midair.

2349
02:57:49,690 --> 02:57:50,190
Nice.

2350
02:57:50,729 --> 02:57:56,420
Grabbing from a parry is more difficult than it seems.

2351
02:57:57,780 --> 02:57:58,420
Yeah?

2352
02:57:58,420 --> 02:57:58,920
Yeah.

2353
02:58:00,299 --> 02:58:02,139
Recuperate from gamer fatigue.

2354
02:58:03,100 --> 02:58:05,979
Recuperating from gamer fatigue is more difficult than it seems.

2355
02:58:07,590 --> 02:58:10,440
Come back to you.

2356
02:58:11,079 --> 02:58:13,049
Controller unplugged.

2357
02:58:17,620 --> 02:58:18,659
You can bait parries?

2358
02:58:18,659 --> 02:58:19,159
Yeah.

2359
02:58:20,340 --> 02:58:21,940
Yeah this is a lot trickery.

2360
02:58:21,940 --> 02:58:24,579
Do you remember what this girl's thing was?

2361
02:58:24,579 --> 02:58:25,459
You used her a second ago.

2362
02:58:26,100 --> 02:58:27,700
I don't even remember.

2363
02:58:27,700 --> 02:58:29,379
I don't think I even got a chance to use her special.

2364
02:58:29,379 --> 02:58:29,940
I was so bad.

2365
02:58:30,899 --> 02:58:35,700
Do you know that you can bunt out of your special?

2366
02:58:36,809 --> 02:58:38,489
Does it consume the special?

2367
02:58:38,489 --> 02:58:38,989
Yeah.

2368
02:58:39,930 --> 02:58:41,290
So while you're in the mid you can just bunt.

2369
02:58:42,010 --> 02:58:43,129
Interesting.

2370
02:58:56,219 --> 02:59:05,819
Damn it.

2371
02:59:05,819 --> 02:59:07,420
What the fuck is going on?

2372
02:59:07,420 --> 02:59:08,059
What happened here?

2373
02:59:09,079 --> 02:59:10,200
What? Are you still here?

2374
02:59:10,200 --> 02:59:10,700
Yeah.

2375
02:59:10,700 --> 02:59:11,239
What the fuck?

2376
02:59:11,239 --> 02:59:12,920
Is that your is that your move?

2377
02:59:12,920 --> 02:59:13,719
Her move changed.

2378
02:59:13,719 --> 02:59:16,280
I remember it changes the direction a couple times.

2379
02:59:16,280 --> 02:59:19,000
No no I mean like there's like a dummy here of you.

2380
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:20,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

2381
02:59:21,190 --> 02:59:21,690
Oh well.

2382
02:59:22,649 --> 02:59:25,209
I thought you put a dummy here.

2383
02:59:25,209 --> 02:59:25,709
No.

2384
02:59:26,329 --> 02:59:27,049
Oh well.

2385
02:59:27,049 --> 02:59:27,549
Oh well.

2386
02:59:33,629 --> 02:59:34,670
Oh that's what it is.

2387
02:59:38,030 --> 02:59:39,149
Okay now you're off the screen.

2388
02:59:39,870 --> 02:59:53,290
That was a that was just a bad program.

2389
02:59:54,090 --> 02:59:56,489
It really doesn't feel like it didn't.

2390
03:00:03,520 --> 03:00:06,559
One of you hundred devs needs to fit a hundred devs.

2391
03:00:06,559 --> 03:00:08,399
Yeah can you believe they have a hundred dev team?

2392
03:00:16,250 --> 03:00:16,809
Damn it.

2393
03:00:16,809 --> 03:00:18,329
I'm so panicking over that shit.

2394
03:00:18,969 --> 03:00:32,670
Shit I'm holding it down now.

2395
03:00:41,719 --> 03:00:43,959
Oh lord I'm slowing down.

2396
03:00:44,040 --> 03:00:45,079
Yeah I'm slowing down.

2397
03:00:54,920 --> 03:00:57,639
Oh my god I thought I was you because we're both beautiful women.

2398
03:01:15,610 --> 03:01:17,290
I programmed the cars in the background.

2399
03:01:17,290 --> 03:01:18,010
Nice job man.

2400
03:01:36,239 --> 03:01:38,799
Stages like this I don't know there's some of the stages that

2401
03:01:38,799 --> 03:01:40,159
the wiggling back and forth is.

2402
03:01:41,280 --> 03:01:43,280
I can't I can't I can't man.

2403
03:01:44,479 --> 03:01:45,680
I don't like the stage wiggling.

2404
03:01:48,409 --> 03:01:49,930
Damn well you still just saved my life.

2405
03:01:52,250 --> 03:01:53,370
Oh cheese bag cheese bag.

2406
03:02:01,530 --> 03:02:02,030
Jesus.

2407
03:02:12,399 --> 03:02:13,440
I just want to get a hand on it.

2408
03:02:14,079 --> 03:02:15,600
I just want to touch it.

2409
03:02:26,059 --> 03:02:29,020
Oh shit I thought it was gonna go the other way.

2410
03:02:29,020 --> 03:02:53,950
Down instead of up.

2411
03:02:53,950 --> 03:02:54,909
Oh my god.

2412
03:02:54,909 --> 03:02:57,440
Sometimes you gotta I gotta just stop moving.

2413
03:02:58,520 --> 03:02:59,159
Just slow down.

2414
03:02:59,159 --> 03:03:00,600
It's like you know what people are like I don't.

2415
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:01,399
Never mind just.

2416
03:03:04,920 --> 03:03:06,200
You might want to move a little bit.

2417
03:03:22,600 --> 03:03:23,319
Sonic boom.

2418
03:03:27,159 --> 03:03:27,559
Shit.

2419
03:03:27,559 --> 03:03:28,360
You fooled me.

2420
03:03:28,360 --> 03:03:29,159
You fooled me.

2421
03:03:29,159 --> 03:03:29,659
Fooled him.

2422
03:03:34,540 --> 03:03:35,180
You fooled me.

2423
03:03:36,559 --> 03:03:37,280
Level 23.

2424
03:03:47,069 --> 03:03:47,709
You fooled me.

2425
03:03:50,200 --> 03:03:50,760
Knock out.

2426
03:03:50,760 --> 03:03:52,600
Piece of cake.

2427
03:04:01,370 --> 03:04:02,329
What is wrong with you?

2428
03:04:03,209 --> 03:04:05,530
That's the that's the punch out.

2429
03:04:05,530 --> 03:04:10,559
It's only one good character.

2430
03:04:11,200 --> 03:04:12,000
Ping pong guy.

2431
03:04:19,709 --> 03:04:22,190
That's that was that was the when you beat somebody in punch out.

2432
03:04:23,229 --> 03:04:23,709
Look it up.

2433
03:04:25,229 --> 03:04:26,510
You beat someone in punch out.

2434
03:04:42,809 --> 03:04:45,370
Oh come on really you how did you get rid of that one.

2435
03:04:46,860 --> 03:04:48,540
You were you were doing it.

2436
03:04:49,420 --> 03:04:50,780
That didn't sound anything like it.

2437
03:04:50,780 --> 03:04:51,659
I'll play it in a second.

2438
03:04:52,299 --> 03:04:54,379
What the hell why was it floating to me.

2439
03:04:54,379 --> 03:04:55,739
It floated to me.

2440
03:04:55,739 --> 03:04:57,180
Because after a second it floats to you.

2441
03:04:58,059 --> 03:05:00,799
Come on bro.

2442
03:05:00,799 --> 03:05:09,049
What's happening with my body.

2443
03:05:09,049 --> 03:05:09,610
I think it was.

2444
03:05:09,610 --> 03:05:10,649
Oh I was in the middle of a special.

2445
03:05:10,649 --> 03:05:12,729
Yeah you were in the special so you still had a lock on it.

2446
03:05:13,879 --> 03:05:14,200
All right.

2447
03:05:15,079 --> 03:05:19,280
You're just like binding of Isaac me.

2448
03:05:19,280 --> 03:05:22,479
With the fucking item that's like aerial of you know what I'm saying.

Okay weird check out that thing I heard it I heard it.

2627
03:19:17,079 --> 03:19:18,440
That was bullshit that was over the net.

2628
03:19:20,079 --> 03:19:34,829
You wish it was over the net lucky.

2629
03:19:43,559 --> 03:19:45,959
I thought you were gonna do the thing where it spins around goes the other way.

2630
03:19:45,959 --> 03:19:46,920
Thought you're gonna do your special.

2631
03:19:46,920 --> 03:19:54,319
You're gonna go where you're gonna go.

2632
03:19:54,879 --> 03:19:57,120
I only had one hit there's no way to get it over.

2633
03:19:58,000 --> 03:20:04,829
Okay you're gonna be like that and I'm gonna be like this.

2634
03:20:05,549 --> 03:20:14,059
All right okay all right okay.

2635
03:20:16,159 --> 03:20:19,260
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho.

2636
03:20:19,979 --> 03:20:45,549
Oh I thought you had I thought that was the no yes.

2637
03:20:47,100 --> 03:20:48,780
That did not bounce how I thought it was gonna be.

2638
03:20:52,010 --> 03:20:54,409
All right I'm trying to bait you out there it's fine.

2639
03:20:55,290 --> 03:21:07,819
Holy fucking hell oh you didn't do it.

2640
03:21:08,459 --> 03:21:21,690
Oh what I thought I had super it didn't do it.

2641
03:21:21,690 --> 03:21:22,809
I should have been able to use it.

2642
03:21:25,120 --> 03:21:27,000
For the likes.

2643
03:21:27,799 --> 03:21:29,239
Come on come on.

2644
03:21:38,700 --> 03:21:41,530
What here it comes.

2645
03:21:42,250 --> 03:22:04,520
Can he win it will he win the world's next game.

2646
03:22:06,110 --> 03:22:07,709
It's crazy how this set was the best of seven.

2647
03:22:08,430 --> 03:22:10,989
You're gonna have anything left in your room before we're done here.

2648
03:22:12,360 --> 03:22:16,600
It's actually insane how the tension is boiling in this best of seven set.

2649
03:22:19,500 --> 03:22:20,940
You're gonna have anything left in there.

2650
03:22:23,159 --> 03:22:24,760
You'd be surprised how little you need.

2651
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:34,110
You need food water and winning and bread and winning.

2652
03:22:38,430 --> 03:22:39,549
I'm done taking it easy on you.

2653
03:22:42,799 --> 03:22:44,239
Look at him wiggle look at these wiggles.

2654
03:22:59,290 --> 03:23:00,329
I can feel you.

2655
03:23:01,690 --> 03:23:03,610
It's not activating my super ever.

2656
03:23:03,610 --> 03:23:06,670
I could I could like smell it.

2657
03:23:07,870 --> 03:23:23,950
I almost want to lose because I feel like you're gonna like sledgehammer your computer.

2658
03:23:25,309 --> 03:23:34,700
Yeah just play it off like you want to lose just play it off.

2659
03:23:37,420 --> 03:23:39,340
Yeah that's what that was so you want it to lose.

2660
03:23:58,270 --> 03:23:59,629
Yeah you just want it to lose huh.

2661
03:24:01,200 --> 03:24:01,700
Yeah.

2662
03:24:17,319 --> 03:24:18,520
Yeah you want it to lose right.

2663
03:24:18,520 --> 03:24:19,639
That's what's happening.

2664
03:24:19,639 --> 03:24:24,729
Well you're gonna get it be careful careful careful it's hard again.

2665
03:24:41,120 --> 03:24:42,639
I was trying to spike it on you.

2666
03:24:51,659 --> 03:24:53,159
All right come on now.

2667
03:25:01,690 --> 03:25:04,969
Oh you gotta be kidding me with that bullshit I've never seen it before.

2668
03:25:05,209 --> 03:25:08,489
I've seen it before last time you were trash of this game.

2669
03:25:10,489 --> 03:25:11,850
Oh yeah I've trapped this game.

2670
03:25:19,069 --> 03:25:21,790
Yeah I let you win those just like you're you are.

2671
03:25:21,790 --> 03:25:24,350
I think I should let you win because otherwise oh you're in danger.

2672
03:25:24,350 --> 03:25:24,989
My controller.

2673
03:25:27,309 --> 03:25:30,989
What oh that's excuse that's excuse man.

2674
03:25:32,680 --> 03:25:33,959
Controller oh god.

2675
03:25:34,600 --> 03:25:40,079
Oh you can't fool me with that bullshit.

2676
03:25:40,079 --> 03:25:40,559
You're not gonna.

2677
03:25:43,120 --> 03:25:46,989
Bullshit oh that's bullshit.

2678
03:25:46,989 --> 03:25:49,069
Oh what the fuck dude my controller.

2679
03:25:52,840 --> 03:26:00,270
Oh looks like I won seven for everyone keeping track at home.

2680
03:26:00,270 --> 03:26:02,280
It's like I'm ahead by four.

2681
03:26:10,600 --> 03:26:13,000
Got two free points it's still lost.

2682
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:16,840
Hey it was a series I won the series two times in a row.

2683
03:26:16,920 --> 03:26:18,680
Three times in a row actually.

2684
03:26:18,680 --> 03:26:20,520
Best out of three best out of five.

2685
03:26:20,520 --> 03:26:21,639
Well that's that's seven.

2686
03:26:21,639 --> 03:26:22,680
Looks like I'm in the lead.

2687
03:26:25,709 --> 03:26:27,629
If it's best of seven I have to I've already won.

2688
03:26:28,670 --> 03:26:32,649
I've already won he's like it's already it's already over.

2689
03:26:39,870 --> 03:26:43,129
You know what just fucking water all over me.

2690
03:26:45,209 --> 03:26:47,850
Same.

2691
03:26:47,850 --> 03:26:49,610
Fucking you see you're dumping water on me.

2692
03:26:52,920 --> 03:26:55,000
There's like you're not gonna recover from this shit.

2693
03:26:55,719 --> 03:26:56,280
No way.

2694
03:26:56,280 --> 03:26:56,920
He didn't turn.

2695
03:26:58,440 --> 03:27:01,159
Because if you try and turn too hard you just slam it into the ground.

2696
03:27:12,459 --> 03:27:18,219
I was so good that was so good and I fucking flew it at the end it was so easy.

2697
03:27:28,989 --> 03:27:29,549
What the fuck.

2698
03:27:30,190 --> 03:27:36,969
Okay best of seven come on now it's gonna happen here.

2699
03:27:36,969 --> 03:27:39,530
There is they know by the way there ain't no such thing as

2700
03:27:39,530 --> 03:27:42,250
ain't no such thing as best out of 10 or best out of 15.

2701
03:27:42,809 --> 03:27:44,809
Doesn't matter what sport even it doesn't matter.

2702
03:27:54,250 --> 03:27:55,610
Oh you gotta be kidding me with that.

2703
03:28:02,590 --> 03:28:04,829
Snuck it under there like a little fucking mouse.

2704
03:28:11,260 --> 03:28:15,610
It was still counting as my ball too again.

2705
03:28:15,610 --> 03:28:18,329
Okay oops a daisy parried him.

2706
03:28:42,110 --> 03:28:51,360
This game blows game was made by toddlers.

2707
03:28:52,000 --> 03:28:53,680
This game's great.

2708
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:01,559
Gamer rage here comes the rage.

2709
03:29:01,559 --> 03:29:03,319
Okay so we're even at three to three.

2710
03:29:03,799 --> 03:29:04,600
The next game wins.

2711
03:29:06,120 --> 03:29:06,760
I quit.

2712
03:29:08,159 --> 03:29:11,440
I don't know how many series I have to win when you keep extending them.

2713
03:29:12,399 --> 03:29:22,590
I mean it's just it just comes down to just

2714
03:29:23,309 --> 03:29:25,629
getting in the right moment in the right mindset.

2715
03:29:27,239 --> 03:29:29,799
Timing your shots carefully fundamentals.

2716
03:29:30,760 --> 03:29:34,040
He left the discord by the way he's gone he's he's gone.

2717
03:29:34,760 --> 03:29:35,319
He's not here.

2718
03:29:37,959 --> 03:29:39,639
He turned his stream off.

2719
03:29:40,969 --> 03:29:41,690
Wait what.

2720
03:29:42,959 --> 03:29:44,319
What is.

2721
03:29:46,399 --> 03:29:48,079
Why did you turn off his stream.

2722
03:29:53,850 --> 03:29:55,770
It was a very good intense series.

2723
03:29:56,409 --> 03:29:58,840
Hey you probably won more games total.

2724
03:30:02,280 --> 03:30:03,399
See you in another year.

2725
03:30:07,979 --> 03:30:12,219
Well that was a star by the way a star twitch twitch.tv's flash stir.

2726
03:30:14,760 --> 03:30:20,190
Welcome everybody from hi hi stars switch twitch channel.

2727
03:30:22,700 --> 03:30:24,219
So here's what we're going to do now.

2728
03:30:25,180 --> 03:30:27,500
Is I'm going to go take a pee and grab a water.

2729
03:30:28,750 --> 03:30:30,750
And then from there we're going to talk about the green screen.

2730
03:30:30,750 --> 03:30:32,350
I'm going to update you guys on the green screen.

2731
03:30:33,309 --> 03:30:34,670
Which is happening very soon.

2732
03:30:35,629 --> 03:30:37,549
Because there are some changes to be made.

2733
03:30:37,549 --> 03:30:39,069
So stick around.

2734
03:30:39,069 --> 03:30:39,709
I'll be right back.

2735
03:30:40,270 --> 03:30:41,149
Pee break.

2736
03:30:41,149 --> 03:30:42,110
Water break.

2737
03:30:42,110 --> 03:30:42,670
You know the deal.

2738
03:30:43,229 --> 03:30:44,010
See you in a bit.

2739
03:32:37,040 --> 03:34:00,440
Okay hello.

2740
03:34:00,440 --> 03:34:14,350
So let us discuss this out of the way while I listen to music.

2741
03:34:14,350 --> 03:34:16,030
This is from lethal league.

2742
03:34:16,969 --> 03:34:18,649
Lethal league blazes soundtrack.

2743
03:34:19,290 --> 03:34:20,540
It's very good.

2744
03:34:21,340 --> 03:34:22,299
Highly recommend.

2745
03:34:25,870 --> 03:34:31,639
Okay so you want to see just how much this game takes out of me.

2746
03:34:32,920 --> 03:34:34,760
I'm like so sweaty and greasy right now.

2747
03:34:34,760 --> 03:34:35,639
It's like unbelievable.

2748
03:34:36,360 --> 03:34:38,270
Turn this on.

2749
03:34:45,000 --> 03:34:47,280
Let's get that off.

2750
03:34:47,280 --> 03:34:48,079
I'll take this out too.

2751
03:34:51,680 --> 03:34:53,200
Like look at look at this shit.

2752
03:34:53,200 --> 03:34:53,760
It's insane.

2753
03:34:54,399 --> 03:34:56,379
Take a look under them.

2754
03:34:56,379 --> 03:34:58,000
I am.

2755
03:34:58,000 --> 03:34:59,200
This is just this is water.

2756
03:34:59,200 --> 03:35:00,639
That's not a shadow guys.

2757
03:35:00,639 --> 03:35:02,000
That's that's water.

2758
03:35:03,719 --> 03:35:05,370
Look at that.

2759
03:35:05,370 --> 03:35:06,649
This is like heavy under here.

2760
03:35:06,649 --> 03:35:07,770
It weighs a shitload.

2761
03:35:09,290 --> 03:35:10,250
Check out this side though.

2762
03:35:11,389 --> 03:35:17,479
It's like I'm just sitting here like I'm wet.

2763
03:35:17,479 --> 03:35:18,120
I worked out.

2764
03:35:19,049 --> 03:35:21,610
I could walk like when I talk to Kim.

2765
03:35:22,170 --> 03:35:25,450
I could tell her I was like doing push-ups in here for like fucking three out four hours.

2766
03:35:25,450 --> 03:35:28,250
And she'd be like oh wow wow you really look like you've been working out.

2767
03:35:28,809 --> 03:35:30,479
Don't even need to go to the fucking gym.

2768
03:35:31,360 --> 03:35:33,600
But anyways let's get this back off.

2769
03:35:35,319 --> 03:35:37,159
And let me transition.

2770
03:35:37,159 --> 03:35:38,760
Well actually I don't think I can just keep this on.

2771
03:35:39,559 --> 03:35:41,129
So let's talk about the green screen.

2772
03:35:41,770 --> 03:35:46,840
Those of you that don't know just like I'm just going to be this cube in the middle.

2773
03:35:47,719 --> 03:35:48,360
Yeah that's fine.

2774
03:35:48,920 --> 03:35:50,959
I don't want to use too much internet.

2775
03:35:51,930 --> 03:35:56,090
So for those of you that don't know there is a thank you for sharing.

2776
03:35:56,090 --> 03:35:56,809
You're very welcome.

2777
03:35:57,530 --> 03:36:02,969
So next week I'm going to do a stream where I get in front of a green screen.

2778
03:36:03,610 --> 03:36:09,770
And I'm going to do potentially 150 to 200 separate actions.

2779
03:36:10,409 --> 03:36:15,850
So originally the plan was I was going to have a voting period.

2780
03:36:15,850 --> 03:36:18,889
And it was going to be secret where I didn't know what you guys were suggesting.

2781
03:36:19,690 --> 03:36:24,729
But I've changed the rules a little bit because it's just not going to happen.

2782
03:36:24,729 --> 03:36:29,850
There were like I think 1500 plus different suggestions in that channel in the discord.

2783
03:36:29,850 --> 03:36:34,489
So it was like there was no way I was reliably going to just be like oh hey mods.

2784
03:36:34,489 --> 03:36:37,770
Hey can you do like fucking if there's props involved I need to know what they are so I

2785
03:36:37,770 --> 03:36:38,489
can buy them.

2786
03:36:38,489 --> 03:36:38,889
You know what I mean?

2787
03:36:38,889 --> 03:36:42,889
I need to know what these things are so if I need to know what they are so I can buy them.

2788
03:36:42,889 --> 03:36:43,290
You know what I mean?

2789
03:36:43,290 --> 03:36:46,250
I need to know what these things are so I'm able to do them.

2790
03:36:47,209 --> 03:36:52,409
So what I did is I went through myself and I did a pre-screening.

2791
03:36:52,409 --> 03:36:56,170
Essentially I went through every single every single submission in that channel.

2792
03:36:56,889 --> 03:36:59,930
And it was oh we're going to make a poll.

2793
03:36:59,930 --> 03:37:01,290
We're going to make a voting.

2794
03:37:01,290 --> 03:37:03,530
There's not going to be any voting for all the actions.

2795
03:37:03,530 --> 03:37:04,809
I'm just going to take the ones that I like.

2796
03:37:05,450 --> 03:37:06,969
The audio is out of sync.

2797
03:37:06,969 --> 03:37:08,489
Oh it's because of PlayStation 4.

2798
03:37:09,290 --> 03:37:10,090
Here let me do this.

2799
03:37:11,790 --> 03:37:13,549
It is because of the PS4.

2800
03:37:22,860 --> 03:37:43,229
The mic has been out of sync the entire stream hasn't it?

2801
03:37:43,229 --> 03:37:43,950
It had to have been.

2802
03:37:47,899 --> 03:37:50,620
Yeah no there's no way that it wasn't out of sync the whole stream.

2803
03:37:53,280 --> 03:38:04,030
Was I like responding to things Star was saying like two full seconds before he said them?

2804
03:38:04,030 --> 03:38:05,309
So wait hold on a second.

2805
03:38:05,309 --> 03:38:07,309
I've been I've been like a full second behind.

2806
03:38:10,059 --> 03:38:10,700
It was fine.

2807
03:38:12,590 --> 03:38:15,690
All right it seemed fine.

2808
03:38:15,690 --> 03:38:20,170
All right well that my microphone was 650 milliseconds behind.

2809
03:38:20,889 --> 03:38:23,610
So he would say something and it would take me almost a full second to respond to it.

2810
03:38:23,610 --> 03:38:28,559
But as long as it uh as long as it wasn't that noticeable.

2811
03:38:28,559 --> 03:38:31,280
It was just stuck there from the PlayStation 4 when when it did Red Dead.

2812
03:38:35,389 --> 03:38:36,510
It still seems off.

2813
03:38:37,069 --> 03:38:37,870
It should not be.

2814
03:38:40,319 --> 03:38:42,559
Yeah I'm at zero here and the camera's at zero.

2815
03:38:45,690 --> 03:38:46,010
Is it?

2816
03:38:46,649 --> 03:38:49,719
Yeah it's fine.

2817
03:38:49,719 --> 03:38:56,569
But anyways uh the let's go well hopefully that wasn't fucking horrible to watch.

2818
03:38:58,250 --> 03:38:59,930
Uh sorry about that.

2819
03:38:59,930 --> 03:39:02,250
I you know it's been kind of crazy here with the internet.

2820
03:39:02,809 --> 03:39:06,250
So I saw green and stepped on the fucking gas.

2821
03:39:06,250 --> 03:39:07,129
Didn't even think about it.

2822
03:39:07,129 --> 03:39:08,489
It was just like green internet screen go.

2823
03:39:09,370 --> 03:39:11,120
So sorry about that.

2824
03:39:11,120 --> 03:39:15,239
Anyways uh talk about the green screen right.

2825
03:39:15,239 --> 03:39:21,610
So instead of having it be a period where everybody votes and I don't know in secret.

2826
03:39:21,610 --> 03:39:24,969
I just I went through and I picked out the ones that I think I want to do.

2827
03:39:24,969 --> 03:39:29,209
And I narrowed it down to about 120, 130 plus actions.

2828
03:39:30,170 --> 03:39:31,209
There's going to be one poll.

2829
03:39:31,930 --> 03:39:37,530
So the poll is going to be what meme shit you guys want me to do.

2830
03:39:37,530 --> 03:39:39,450
Because there was just a lot of meme shit.

2831
03:39:39,450 --> 03:39:42,250
And I don't even want I don't even want to talk about them.

2832
03:39:42,250 --> 03:39:46,780
So there's going to be a poll with all the memes on it.

2833
03:39:46,780 --> 03:39:48,219
I've already vetoed three of them.

2834
03:39:48,219 --> 03:39:50,780
So you'll you'll get to see it over the next day here.

2835
03:39:52,319 --> 03:39:55,280
So I'm going to put a poll in the discord.

2836
03:39:55,280 --> 03:39:56,399
I'll give it to one of the mods.

2837
03:39:56,399 --> 03:39:57,280
I'll put it in the general.

2838
03:39:57,280 --> 03:39:58,239
That's where it's going to be.

2839
03:39:58,239 --> 03:39:59,920
I haven't made it yet so that's why it's not here.

2840
03:40:00,959 --> 03:40:03,360
And there's no more suggestions as of tonight.

2841
03:40:04,079 --> 03:40:08,639
So pretty much by the time this stream is over five or six hours later.

2842
03:40:08,639 --> 03:40:09,760
I'll probably till like midnight.

2843
03:40:10,879 --> 03:40:14,399
Pacific which would be 3am eastern is when it's going to be just completely closed.

2844
03:40:15,440 --> 03:40:19,280
I'm going to then a couple days later figure out exactly how I want to do it.

2845
03:40:19,280 --> 03:40:20,319
What I want to do.

2846
03:40:20,319 --> 03:40:23,120
And then you guys are going to be a poll that's going to be up for like three or

2847
03:40:23,120 --> 03:40:24,639
four days before the stream happens.

2848
03:40:25,200 --> 03:40:29,840
From what mean is three meme shit that I get to do out of like 20 different options.

2849
03:40:30,399 --> 03:40:32,239
So we'll go we'll touch on that later.

2850
03:40:33,280 --> 03:40:37,370
Police temple you chose where there are a lot of great ones.

2851
03:40:38,329 --> 03:40:42,729
There are a lot of odd ones too but you'll see soon enough.

2852
03:40:43,920 --> 03:40:48,479
And because I got a little bit of time here to be able to actually explain all this.

2853
03:40:49,799 --> 03:40:52,200
After the poll is closed and after it's ready to go.

2854
03:40:53,319 --> 03:40:56,520
It's going to be the after the stream happens.

2855
03:40:56,520 --> 03:41:00,440
There's going to be like full two full weeks before we even do anything else.

2856
03:41:00,440 --> 03:41:05,079
So you'll have plenty of fucking time to be able to put together whatever you want.

2857
03:41:05,079 --> 03:41:07,079
And the rules for that.

2858
03:41:07,079 --> 03:41:09,079
I think I won't even talk about them till later.

2859
03:41:10,040 --> 03:41:11,799
What's my personal favorite one.

2860
03:41:12,920 --> 03:41:15,399
There's two of my I'll tell you that my two personal favorites.

2861
03:41:15,399 --> 03:41:18,040
Because I just can't even imagine how stupid that it's going to be.

2862
03:41:19,000 --> 03:41:20,360
Personal favorite number one is.

2863
03:41:21,479 --> 03:41:25,159
Go limp on the ground hear something and pretend to be a toy from Toy Story.

2864
03:41:25,719 --> 03:41:28,520
Like that's like what that's fucking ridiculous.

2865
03:41:29,319 --> 03:41:32,200
Go hear something and go limp.

2866
03:41:33,000 --> 03:41:35,079
Like I don't even know where you're going to put me there.

2867
03:41:35,079 --> 03:41:36,120
And the second one is.

2868
03:41:37,719 --> 03:41:41,879
Be in a bowl of cereal and avoid a toddler eating cereal from the bowl.

2869
03:41:45,600 --> 03:41:48,159
Like what how am I supposed to even do that.

2870
03:41:51,180 --> 03:41:54,299
There's hundreds of guys like you think that that's it.

2871
03:41:54,860 --> 03:41:56,379
And people were concerned though.

2872
03:41:56,379 --> 03:41:58,860
I mean let me let me squelch these concerns right away.

2873
03:41:58,860 --> 03:42:02,540
A ton of people are like oh man we're just going to get like a bunch of fucked up shit.

2874
03:42:02,540 --> 03:42:04,860
Not going to be able to use oh no no I'm.

2875
03:42:05,420 --> 03:42:07,420
We're doing a full spread here man.

2876
03:42:07,420 --> 03:42:09,020
I am doing like standing.

2877
03:42:09,819 --> 03:42:16,059
Blinking walking running dodging getting hit getting hit in the shoulder getting hit in the arm.

2878
03:42:16,059 --> 03:42:20,059
Getting hit in the shin getting hit in the face like this is going to be a full nine.

2879
03:42:20,700 --> 03:42:26,299
It's not going to be like oh I'm just going to like eat fucking bananas on stream.

2880
03:42:26,299 --> 03:42:27,979
And then that's it.

2881
03:42:27,979 --> 03:42:29,659
There you go meemers like no.

2882
03:42:31,180 --> 03:42:32,139
We're doing the whole thing.

2883
03:42:33,530 --> 03:42:38,969
Like oh react scared react scared plus react scared plus plus you know what I mean.

2884
03:42:38,969 --> 03:42:40,569
Like there's going to be plenty of options for you.

2885
03:42:41,930 --> 03:42:45,209
And there's a ton of random fucking things that people have suggested that are going to be funny too.

2886
03:42:47,979 --> 03:42:50,700
Sprites essentially I'm making human sprites that's right.

2887
03:42:52,280 --> 03:42:55,799
And then a couple weeks later we're going to do it might even take two streams in a row.

2888
03:42:55,799 --> 03:42:58,680
To do a night where we sit around and we just hang out and we just play them.

2889
03:42:59,239 --> 03:43:01,639
And they will be rules by the way based on that.

2890
03:43:01,639 --> 03:43:05,719
I'm going to assume it's going to be this is not set in stone so it's not quite ready yet.

2891
03:43:05,719 --> 03:43:10,200
But up to two minutes and at least 10 seconds.

2892
03:43:11,559 --> 03:43:15,079
That has to be there because like I said I was talking to the discord the other day.

2893
03:43:15,639 --> 03:43:20,600
I ain't going to have like 400 submissions that are just like up.

2894
03:43:20,600 --> 03:43:24,920
Like no that's not like it's got to be at least 10 seconds or up to two minutes.

2895
03:43:24,920 --> 03:43:25,399
You know what I mean.

2896
03:43:26,200 --> 03:43:30,479
Those actions are funny but do we have anything to really add the green screen.

2897
03:43:30,479 --> 03:43:33,760
Oh there's a lot of things that are going to be worthy of the green screen.

2898
03:43:34,719 --> 03:43:37,530
There's at least 60 of these actions.

2899
03:43:37,530 --> 03:43:39,450
They're very very going to they're going to be very fun.

2900
03:43:42,600 --> 03:43:43,799
When was the sideburn patch.

2901
03:43:43,799 --> 03:43:44,440
I fixed them.

2902
03:43:44,440 --> 03:43:46,840
Look see right there.

2903
03:43:48,350 --> 03:43:50,270
Right there even I fixed it.

2904
03:43:51,360 --> 03:43:55,100
See I fixed it.

2905
03:43:55,100 --> 03:43:56,219
I told you guys I was going to fix it.

2906
03:43:56,940 --> 03:44:02,329
Can you do 10 bups?

2907
03:44:03,500 --> 03:44:09,979
Sure it could be like but I mean is it going to pass the pre-screening.

2908
03:44:09,979 --> 03:44:11,340
Because all these members.

2909
03:44:11,340 --> 03:44:13,659
Here's something another thing that a lot of people might not understand.

2910
03:44:14,299 --> 03:44:19,659
There's going to be a rigorous pre-screening on every single one of these submissions.

2911
03:44:19,659 --> 03:44:23,420
And you only get to submit I would probably assume we're going to have a limit here.

2912
03:44:23,420 --> 03:44:27,340
You can only submit like two or three submissions because people will just

2913
03:44:27,340 --> 03:44:31,659
diarrhea in like a hundred fucking submissions of random shit.

2914
03:44:31,659 --> 03:44:35,659
So we're going to have very strict rules and if they don't follow the rules

2915
03:44:35,739 --> 03:44:40,760
Strictly strictly they're going to just get thrown out.

2916
03:44:40,760 --> 03:44:46,170
Because I cannot have a scenario where it's like do you know.

2917
03:44:48,540 --> 03:44:50,860
What oh guy stands in front of green screen.

2918
03:44:50,860 --> 03:44:53,899
You know how fucking easy it would be to do up all kinds of fucked up shit.

2919
03:44:54,459 --> 03:44:57,659
No they're all getting pre-watched pre-screened not by me.

2920
03:44:57,659 --> 03:44:59,180
I mean maybe I will do it.

2921
03:44:59,180 --> 03:45:00,620
It depends on how much there are.

2922
03:45:02,170 --> 03:45:05,659
So there's going to be laws here in this lawless country.

2923
03:45:06,299 --> 03:45:07,100
There's going to be laws.

2924
03:45:10,479 --> 03:45:12,319
Should we put a cap on the amount of videos total.

2925
03:45:13,120 --> 03:45:17,770
Um I don't I'm not sure because it really depends on how many submissions there are.

2926
03:45:18,889 --> 03:45:24,489
Because if there are like let's say 50 to 100 really great submissions

2927
03:45:25,209 --> 03:45:26,649
and they're up to two minutes long.

2928
03:45:27,370 --> 03:45:28,889
I mean that's not very long.

2929
03:45:28,889 --> 03:45:29,450
You know what I mean.

2930
03:45:29,450 --> 03:45:32,329
Like that wouldn't take a long time and plus if we do an entire stream

2931
03:45:32,889 --> 03:45:39,049
a full three four plus hour live stream maybe two streams maybe possibly.

2932
03:45:39,770 --> 03:45:42,329
Then they would have to be hundreds of submissions that get through.

2933
03:45:42,969 --> 03:45:44,569
If you take back to the emote contest.

2934
03:45:45,530 --> 03:45:50,170
I mean the emote contest had a ton of submissions and a ton of ones got pre-screened.

2935
03:45:50,170 --> 03:45:52,329
But it wasn't like an outrageous level.

2936
03:45:52,889 --> 03:45:54,889
I mean there's 3,000 people here now.

2937
03:45:54,889 --> 03:45:59,450
But I don't think this channel is quite at a spot where it's unmanageable.

2938
03:45:59,450 --> 03:46:00,010
You know what I mean.

2939
03:46:01,129 --> 03:46:04,010
Up to like three four five hundred submissions then going through them

2940
03:46:04,010 --> 03:46:05,530
and bringing them down to like a hundred or two hundred.

2941
03:46:06,329 --> 03:46:09,290
I mean if there were like two thousand submissions then this would be impossible.

2942
03:46:09,290 --> 03:46:09,530
Right.

2943
03:46:10,969 --> 03:46:11,770
What is this contest?

2944
03:46:12,170 --> 03:46:12,809
It's not a contest.

2945
03:46:12,809 --> 03:46:14,250
This is not a contest at all.

2946
03:46:14,889 --> 03:46:18,889
This is just a fun thing that we can do just to make some weird shit.

2947
03:46:19,690 --> 03:46:21,370
And see what you guys can come up with.

2948
03:46:21,370 --> 03:46:25,450
Because I also I was talking to Star about this earlier.

2949
03:46:26,090 --> 03:46:30,649
It's going to be kind of fun to essentially bring in some people to do them.

2950
03:46:30,649 --> 03:46:31,209
Right.

2951
03:46:31,209 --> 03:46:34,170
Like I'll have I'll see if Star wants to do an edit.

2952
03:46:34,170 --> 03:46:34,969
He's already talked about it.

2953
03:46:34,969 --> 03:46:36,649
Like italics might want to do an edit.

2954
03:46:36,649 --> 03:46:39,850
Bring in some more people to like do edits and like show theirs on screen.

2955
03:46:39,850 --> 03:46:40,329
You know what I mean.

2956
03:46:40,889 --> 03:46:42,489
Hit up some people see if they'd want to do it.

2957
03:46:43,290 --> 03:46:47,549
Am I going to be doing a fortnight?

2958
03:46:47,549 --> 03:46:48,510
No that was already vetoed.

2959
03:46:51,020 --> 03:46:53,579
So see like if I just see if anybody was interested in doing it.

2960
03:46:56,000 --> 03:47:00,280
But is that a dong on the door?

2961
03:47:00,280 --> 03:47:01,920
That's a fucking creeper man.

2962
03:47:01,920 --> 03:47:02,159
Come on.

2963
03:47:02,159 --> 03:47:03,120
You guys have played that game.

2964
03:47:03,840 --> 03:47:07,479
How am I going to veto the default dance?

2965
03:47:07,479 --> 03:47:09,639
Because I get three vetoes and I don't want to do it.

2966
03:47:10,200 --> 03:47:13,079
And it's it's actually kind of funny because I didn't do the veto thing.

2967
03:47:13,079 --> 03:47:14,360
It's just there kind of for fun.

2968
03:47:15,000 --> 03:47:18,280
Because I vetoed a lot of fucking things that came through there.

2969
03:47:18,280 --> 03:47:21,159
I vetoed almost 90% of every submission.

2970
03:47:21,159 --> 03:47:23,770
So that's a creeper.

2971
03:47:30,670 --> 03:47:32,319
But it should be fun.

2972
03:47:32,319 --> 03:47:33,440
There'll be way more.

2973
03:47:33,440 --> 03:47:34,879
What's with the shitty wallpaper?

2974
03:47:38,909 --> 03:47:41,709
It's it's just like regular wall man.

2975
03:47:44,409 --> 03:47:44,969
Shitty wall.

2976
03:47:44,969 --> 03:47:47,209
There's no there's no wallpaper on this wall.

2977
03:47:49,280 --> 03:47:49,920
Wallpaper.

2978
03:47:52,479 --> 03:47:54,000
Three vetoes is bullshit.

2979
03:47:57,870 --> 03:48:04,959
Three hold on three vetoes based on like 1500 submissions.

2980
03:48:05,770 --> 03:48:08,809
And I pre-screened them down to like 200.

2981
03:48:08,809 --> 03:48:10,649
Three vetoes out of 200.

2982
03:48:11,290 --> 03:48:13,209
You're lucky I don't veto 50 of them.

2983
03:48:13,770 --> 03:48:17,760
Let's see what's what do you mean the drink?

2984
03:48:17,760 --> 03:48:18,959
This drink right here.

2985
03:48:18,959 --> 03:48:23,370
Will I pretend to be a rat?

2986
03:48:23,370 --> 03:48:25,610
It depends on if I want to put it in there or not.

2987
03:48:26,170 --> 03:48:28,889
I got a whole list and it's pretty much ready to go.

2988
03:48:28,889 --> 03:48:31,450
After tonight I'm going to do one more pass through tonight.

2989
03:48:31,450 --> 03:48:34,729
And see if there's any new ones or any good ideas and we'll go from there.

2990
03:48:35,450 --> 03:48:36,489
But this is but what's today?

2991
03:48:36,489 --> 03:48:41,530
Today is today's Sunday.

2992
03:48:42,430 --> 03:48:45,870
So I would assume based around the fact that closing it tonight.

2993
03:48:47,450 --> 03:48:51,450
Maybe gonna give myself like three days or so to like.

2994
03:48:51,450 --> 03:48:53,290
Well remember I have to buy props on Amazon.

2995
03:48:53,290 --> 03:48:54,329
So at least two days.

2996
03:48:54,969 --> 03:48:57,440
I would I would probably say that by this weekend.

2997
03:48:57,440 --> 03:48:59,360
Like this next like weekend coming up here.

2998
03:48:59,360 --> 03:49:01,680
We'll do it on like probably Saturday or Sunday afternoon.

2999
03:49:02,319 --> 03:49:03,520
Is what I'm going to shoot for.

3000
03:49:04,729 --> 03:49:08,569
And after that two weeks later there'll be all the footage will be available.

3001
03:49:08,569 --> 03:49:10,409
Whether you want to pull it from Twitch directly or.

3002
03:49:11,049 --> 03:49:13,450
It's going to be difficult for me to put it all up raw.

3003
03:49:14,489 --> 03:49:16,409
I'll have to find out if I can do that.

3004
03:49:17,129 --> 03:49:17,610
We'll see.

3005
03:49:18,170 --> 03:49:19,770
But expect it at some point this weekend.

3006
03:49:20,409 --> 03:49:24,479
Is this still a one dance limit?

3007
03:49:25,120 --> 03:49:27,819
There weren't no not very many people did dances.

3008
03:49:27,819 --> 03:49:29,739
Not very many people were putting up dances.

3009
03:49:29,739 --> 03:49:32,459
They were doing the people would to give you guys a lot of credit here.

3010
03:49:32,459 --> 03:49:37,180
You guys were trying to at least put some interesting shit up there.

3011
03:49:37,180 --> 03:49:39,260
It wasn't just like total nonsense.

3012
03:49:39,260 --> 03:49:40,299
You guys did a pretty good job.

3013
03:49:41,100 --> 03:49:44,600
I'm not going to use more than three vetoes.

3014
03:49:44,600 --> 03:49:45,079
I already have.

3015
03:49:45,079 --> 03:49:45,559
I've already done it.

3016
03:49:46,520 --> 03:49:48,760
You want to tell you what the three vetoes are.

3017
03:49:49,239 --> 03:49:54,760
Fortnite dance dab and reenact the gnome video.

3018
03:49:54,760 --> 03:49:56,200
That's an automatic veto.

3019
03:49:56,840 --> 03:49:59,920
I ain't doing any of those three things.

3020
03:50:00,399 --> 03:50:07,850
Reenact the gnome video was suggested like six thousand times.

3021
03:50:08,569 --> 03:50:10,649
Then it was upvoted like a thousand times.

3022
03:50:10,649 --> 03:50:11,450
That's a veto.

3023
03:50:14,590 --> 03:50:18,319
Well let me just give you a little bit of a consolation here.

3024
03:50:18,559 --> 03:50:21,600
Oh no the gnome is not selectable in the meme poll.

3025
03:50:21,600 --> 03:50:25,680
But run as Sonic and say Sonic's the name speeds my game.

3026
03:50:26,479 --> 03:50:28,479
That's not fucking embarrassing as hell.

3027
03:50:29,200 --> 03:50:29,920
That's an option.

3028
03:50:30,639 --> 03:50:32,959
Are you kidding me?

3029
03:50:35,819 --> 03:50:37,180
You could be known as the gnome.

3030
03:50:37,180 --> 03:50:38,860
I don't want to be known as the gnome guy.

3031
03:50:39,739 --> 03:50:42,860
I don't want to be known as the guy that's like the annoying dude that

3032
03:50:42,860 --> 03:50:45,979
I'm the new gnome video that people start to put into the other gnome videos.

3033
03:50:45,979 --> 03:50:46,940
I don't want to be that guy.

3034
03:50:47,739 --> 03:50:49,899
I'll be the guy that people will hate me for that.

3035
03:50:49,899 --> 03:50:51,260
People will be very upset.

3036
03:50:51,260 --> 03:50:54,780
Streamers, YouTubers, friends of yours.

3037
03:50:54,780 --> 03:50:57,340
People like random people on like Overwatch lobbies.

3038
03:50:57,340 --> 03:50:59,180
People are going to be like that guy sucks.

3039
03:50:59,180 --> 03:51:00,219
Why did he make this?

3040
03:51:00,219 --> 03:51:01,659
He made that.

3041
03:51:01,659 --> 03:51:02,379
I didn't make it.

3042
03:51:02,379 --> 03:51:03,500
I don't want to make it veto.

3043
03:51:06,959 --> 03:51:08,000
Vetoed man.

3044
03:51:08,000 --> 03:51:08,479
No way.

3045
03:51:09,200 --> 03:51:16,159
But anyways it's going to be a lot of fun.

3046
03:51:16,159 --> 03:51:16,959
I'm looking forward to it.

3047
03:51:17,680 --> 03:51:18,719
All the props that are there.

3048
03:51:19,680 --> 03:51:23,760
I mean it's going to be hard but I'll try to do a full figure skating skit.

3049
03:51:23,760 --> 03:51:26,079
That's going to be fucking hard but it's going to be funny.

3050
03:51:26,079 --> 03:51:28,399
I'm going to put like fucking fake blades on my shoes.

3051
03:51:29,579 --> 03:51:31,180
There's so many fun things.

3052
03:51:31,180 --> 03:51:32,299
I don't think you guys understand.

3053
03:51:37,280 --> 03:51:39,680
There's a lot of interesting potential things here.

3054
03:51:40,399 --> 03:51:43,760
Could you say something for a senior quote of mine?

3055
03:51:54,559 --> 03:51:58,270
Falling down hard through the ground.

3056
03:51:59,950 --> 03:52:03,450
Eventually you end up standing up because you go through the earth

3057
03:52:04,250 --> 03:52:06,360
and you're on top of the world in China.

3058
03:52:07,000 --> 03:52:09,559
So move to China.

3059
03:52:10,200 --> 03:52:25,420
But you just moved to Vegas.

3060
03:52:25,420 --> 03:52:27,340
Yeah well I'm moving to China now.

3061
03:52:27,340 --> 03:52:28,700
I'm going to China now.

3062
03:52:29,340 --> 03:52:30,840
Take a new balloon.

3063
03:52:33,260 --> 03:52:34,459
Is the sip part of the quote?

3064
03:52:34,459 --> 03:52:34,700
No.

3065
03:52:35,340 --> 03:52:42,959
Help me come up with a wedding toast.

3066
03:52:42,959 --> 03:52:43,200
Okay.

3067
03:52:44,000 --> 03:52:45,959
Hey everybody.

3068
03:52:46,600 --> 03:52:47,239
Good to see you.

3069
03:52:47,959 --> 03:52:49,799
For those of you on this side that don't know me.

3070
03:52:50,360 --> 03:52:50,920
I'm Greg.

3071
03:52:52,729 --> 03:52:54,329
Little bro over here you know.

3072
03:52:54,329 --> 03:52:55,129
I'm the little bro.

3073
03:52:56,569 --> 03:52:57,370
I've seen some of you guys.

3074
03:52:57,370 --> 03:52:58,170
I've met some of you guys.

3075
03:52:58,889 --> 03:53:00,889
And first of all I gotta say,

3076
03:53:02,719 --> 03:53:06,559
Kristen you've been like a sister to me so far

3077
03:53:06,559 --> 03:53:09,520
over these last probably 15 years or so.

3078
03:53:10,520 --> 03:53:12,440
I really didn't think that it was ever going to happen

3079
03:53:12,440 --> 03:53:15,879
because obviously there was all the issues that we had

3080
03:53:15,879 --> 03:53:16,760
as a family.

3081
03:53:16,760 --> 03:53:19,690
But we love you.

3082
03:53:19,690 --> 03:53:20,729
You're a sister to us now.

3083
03:53:20,729 --> 03:53:23,930
I just want to say that really quickly before everyone is clapping.

3084
03:53:23,930 --> 03:53:24,489
Everyone is clapping.

3085
03:53:28,510 --> 03:53:30,270
Dude man I gotta say something.

3086
03:53:30,270 --> 03:53:31,469
Put my little bro over here

3087
03:53:32,110 --> 03:53:33,389
because that's the man of the hour.

3088
03:53:33,389 --> 03:53:35,879
There he is right there bro.

3089
03:53:36,600 --> 03:53:38,360
No no this is for the green screen.

3090
03:53:39,799 --> 03:53:41,159
No this is for the green screen.

3091
03:53:41,159 --> 03:53:44,139
I have to be standing up in a suit for this.

3092
03:53:50,250 --> 03:53:50,649
Save it.

3093
03:53:51,899 --> 03:53:53,260
You have nothing else to do?

3094
03:53:53,260 --> 03:53:53,760
What?

3095
03:53:54,219 --> 03:53:56,559
Can you help with the funeral speech?

3096
03:53:59,520 --> 03:54:00,879
Hey everybody.

3097
03:54:01,760 --> 03:54:03,760
So for those of you on this side of the family

3098
03:54:03,760 --> 03:54:05,440
that don't know I'm Greg.

3099
03:54:06,959 --> 03:54:08,079
Met some of you guys already here.

3100
03:54:09,120 --> 03:54:10,959
But before we get started I gotta say Kristen

3101
03:54:12,590 --> 03:54:15,069
it's been a pleasure having you as part of the family.

3102
03:54:16,190 --> 03:54:20,200
And it's just too bad you're down there.

3103
03:54:20,920 --> 03:54:21,639
Down there now.

3104
03:54:22,700 --> 03:54:25,659
But it was it was an absolute fucking honor.

3105
03:54:31,479 --> 03:54:32,680
No no.

3106
03:54:42,889 --> 03:54:44,969
It's been an honor going down.

3107
03:54:47,450 --> 03:54:48,649
Funeral wedding.

3108
03:54:51,200 --> 03:54:52,639
Wedding slash funeral.

3109
03:54:54,409 --> 03:54:59,610
Now you see the move to China as we've all seen.

3110
03:55:01,479 --> 03:55:04,200
You made it right to us when you get there.

3111
03:55:06,329 --> 03:55:07,209
Same event.

3112
03:55:08,440 --> 03:55:12,440
Oh anyways we talked about the green screen.

3113
03:55:13,319 --> 03:55:16,680
Now I'm going to move some stuff out of the way

3114
03:55:16,680 --> 03:55:22,079
and I'm going to open another game called Red Dead Redemption.

3115
03:55:24,170 --> 03:55:24,889
It's a fun game.

3116
03:55:25,530 --> 03:55:28,780
You can last out people.

3117
03:55:29,420 --> 03:55:33,149
You can shoot people.

3118
03:55:36,909 --> 03:55:39,069
It's probably the most fun I've ever had in a video game.

3119
03:55:39,069 --> 03:55:47,559
But I don't know man.

3120
03:55:47,559 --> 03:55:52,319
It seems like it's going to be pretty hard to do with the internet and all.

3121
03:55:52,319 --> 03:55:58,430
What's the matter?

3122
03:55:58,430 --> 03:56:05,290
I don't understand what you guys are talking about.

3123
03:56:10,190 --> 03:56:11,549
Okay let's go.

3124
03:56:11,549 --> 03:56:13,760
What a bad internet joke.

3125
03:56:15,200 --> 03:56:17,680

03:56:25,709 --> 03:56:34,540

03:56:54,569 --> 03:56:55,129

3142
03:57:06,959 --> 03:57:09,840

3143
03:57:11,500 --> 03:57:15,079
But by the way Lethal League is very good.

3144
03:57:15,079 --> 03:57:15,559
Very fun.

3145
03:57:16,280 --> 03:57:18,489
It's a lot like the first one.

3146
03:57:19,129 --> 03:57:21,959
But the first one was also a ton of fun.

3147
03:57:21,959 --> 03:57:24,620
So doesn't surprise me at all.

3148
03:57:24,620 --> 03:57:27,239
I need to move through this.

3149
03:57:27,239 --> 03:57:27,959
That's all good.

3150
03:57:27,959 --> 03:57:28,459

3151
03:57:35,879 --> 03:57:39,319

3153
03:57:44,170 --> 03:57:45,690
So thank you so much KingLam.
