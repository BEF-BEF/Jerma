1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:11,580
Alright Michael, we're here on your special day.

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,580
That's right, it's my birthday today, not anybody else's.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,579
Alright Michael, calm down.

4
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:21,579
Mom, shut up. I get all the presents Cathy doesn't get any because she's an idiot.

5
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:25,579
Come on Michael, you ruin your fucking birthday every year for everybody else and we get it.

6
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:29,579
I went through so much trouble to get you this rat's mixtape. I know how much you like them.

7
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,079
Can we just dance together as a family for once?

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:52,399
This year I got something new and exciting and different for everybody.

9
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:53,899
Hey kids, it's me.

10
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:54,899
It's a clown.

11
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:56,899
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

12
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:57,899
Get away from me.

13
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:58,899
Please.

14
00:00:58,899 --> 00:00:59,899
What the hell is happening?

15
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,899
It's a clown.

16
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:01,899
This clown's out of control.

17
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:02,899
Just chill out, everybody calm down.

18
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:03,899
It's my birthday.

19
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,969
Everybody calm down, I'm just a clown.

20
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:09,340
Oh whoa man, that clown.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,280
Why did you invite him?

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Rats, we're rats, we're the rats.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,280
We play at night, we stalk at night, we're the rats.

24
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,780
I'm the giant rat that makes...

25
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,780
Hey, wait, hey, wait.

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,780
I'm stuck.

27
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,780
I knew this was a bad idea.

28
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,780
I'm stuck.

29
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,780
How did you...

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,780
You're making us late to the birthday party.

31
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,780
I'm the giant rat, I make all the rules.

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,780
You need to help me out of here now.

33
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,780
You know, you say that but...

34
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,680
No.

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,719
Hey, happy birthday.

36
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,719
Dad, those are rats.

37
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,719
Yeah, happy birthday.

38
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,719
A special box inside a treat for you here.

39
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,719
Thanks for the guy.

40
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,719
Thanks for the guy.

41
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,719
Bye.

42
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,599
Oh, I remember that box.

43
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,599
I shit in that one.

44
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,599
Oh dad, it's definitely something really cool.

45
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,599
A super cool toy that everyone's gonna be jealous of.

46
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,599
Hey, what's up?

47
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,599
I'm your new best friend.

48
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,599
We got a problem.

49
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:22,909
The fat guy doesn't fit y'all in the toilet.

50
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:23,909
Alright, honest opinions.

51
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:24,909
What did you guys think?

52
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:28,810
That wasn't good at all.

53
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,810
Yeah, why?

54
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,810
That was bad.

55
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,810
That was terrible.

56
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,810
Well, that's the beauty of this whole thing, son.

57
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,810
None of this even matters at all.

58
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,990
As a sequel, we're trying to do one very important thing.

59
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,490
That's sell toys, sell books, and sell audio tapes.

60
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,490
Now the movie itself could be about a blue toothbrush.

61
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,490
And as long as we sell the merchandise and keep the suits happy,

62
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,490
who cares about the subject matter?

63
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,490
But, what if I don't have a suit?

64
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:58,949
Prepare the drop.

65
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:01,949
And please, hit the right target this time.

66
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,949
Yes, sir.

67
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:19,979
You don't need to know what I had for breakfast this morning, alright?

68
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:21,979
Just let's talk about the deal.

69
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:28,900
Wasn't there a guy that was just right here?

70
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,699
Huh?

71
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:35,199
What's this guy doing here?

72
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,199
This might be the pizza delivery guy.

73
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,199
Yeah, I'm gonna go get the car and I'm gonna pull it around.

74
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,199
Save me a slice.

75
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,199
Don't eat the whole thing.

76
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,199
I don't know.

77
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,199
It might be a pizza.

78
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,199
Maybe I press it and I'll get a pizza.

79
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,629
Yeesh.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,560
I'm going home.

81
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
I want a chicken nuggets.

82
00:03:51,560 --> 00:04:01,180
Oh, what was that?

83
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,000
Welcome, Bratikin, to the dog capital.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,430
I trust you alright?

85
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,930
In that case, walk with me and talk with me.

86
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:17,259
I'm going to show you something that I haven't shown anyone in over two thousand years.

87
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,120
What do you see before you?

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,620
Yeah, a toothbrush.

89
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,620
It is a toothbrush.

90
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,620
One of the most important in the entire galaxy.

91
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,620
Oh, cool.

92
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,620
This toothbrush holds the DNA of every single animal on Earth.

93
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,620
It must be protected.

94
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,620
Yeah, I know.

95
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,620
If this would have fallen to the wrong hands...

96
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,620
The infiltration was a success!

97
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
We've been breached.

98
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
We have been breached.

99
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Sound the alarms.

100
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
We have been breached.

101
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
What's happening?

102
00:04:51,680 --> 00:05:19,490
I've been in a nightmare for two weeks straight.

103
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,740
That's a pretty good toothbrush.

104
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,029
Now hold on just a second.

105
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,029
Pause the movie.

106
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,029
Hit pause.

107
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:35,110
Did you hear what they just said?

108
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,110
That toothbrush has got the DNA of every animal on Earth.

109
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,110
Well, mate, it's just a movie.

110
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,110
I don't buy that for a second.

111
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,110
You're telling me it's just a movie?

112
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,110
Was Finding Nemo just a movie?

113
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,610
No, that was a documentary.

114
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,610
They had cameras down in the ocean.

115
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,610
I've never seen them filming it in Philadelphia.

116
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,610
Hang on a second.

117
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,610
I'm just going to get up right now because you're fuming me.

118
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,610
I'm just saying, we rented this film from Blockbuster.

119
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,610
Oh yeah, Blockbuster clothes.

120
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,610
Good joke.

121
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,610
I'm going to go to the sewer.

122
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,610
You coming with me?

123
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,610
Well, no.

124
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,610
See you later.

125
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,610
I mean, you can't...

126
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,610
Bloody hell.

127
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,870
Nice and easy.

128
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,870
You don't want any cops to see us pulling in here.

129
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,300
All right.

130
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,480
We're going to have to split up for this.

131
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
A lot of junk.

132
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,980
Yep.

133
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,980
Tell me if you find anything.

134
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,980
I thought I'd be doing real jobs.

135
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,980
Robbing banks.

136
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,980
Stealing paintings.

137
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,980
It's pretty good filler content.

138
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,980
I'm waiting through shit to find a dirty toothbrush.

139
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,980
This is just to make sure you understand the story.

140
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,980
Fucking day off as well.

141
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,980
Yeah.

142
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,980
None of this even matters.

143
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,980
Yeah, it doesn't.

144
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,980
Oi!

145
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,980
I've got something for you.

146
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,980
You found something?

147
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
Yeah, I got something too.

148
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,480
What do you got?

149
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Well, it's a blue toothbrush.

150
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Yeah, they're fucking everywhere, man.

151
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
So I'll just grab a couple.

152
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,980
You know, we could probably sell these.

153
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,980
Get in the car.

154
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,980
You know, I've got an idea.

155
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,980
I know exactly who we can sell these to.

156
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Just put your seatbelt on, because I'm about to step on the gas.

157
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:01,709
I would go to a doctor, but I'm just scared of what he has to say.

158
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:02,709
You know?

159
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:03,709
That's why I asked you about it.

160
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:04,709
That is just grimp.

161
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:05,709
Quiet down here.

162
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:06,709
Let me do the talking.

163
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:07,709
You keep your mouth shut.

164
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:11,529
How we doing this evening, cat police?

165
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,529
We don't have time for small talk.

166
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:15,529
Did you bring the product or did you not?

167
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:18,529
Did you get my text by any chance?

168
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:21,029
I have Verizon, so maybe it didn't go through.

169
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:22,269
Enough.

170
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:25,269
The least of your concern should be text messages

171
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:29,269
and how we are about to decimate your disgusting planet.

172
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:31,269
The $20 is what I was told.

173
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:34,269
So you don't get shit unless I see 40 bucks.

174
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:35,269
Not so fast.

175
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:39,790
The rats have told me everything.

176
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,790
And if you think that I, Gary, guardian of...

177
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,600
This ends now, cat police.

178
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
What do you have to say about this one?

179
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Yeah, it's pretty cool, huh?

180
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
Now let's see what happens when you fight me.

181
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
And what I'll win, I'll beat you up.

182
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,600
How did you guys sort this out?

183
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,040
For centuries we have tried to find the Noah's Ark toothbrushes.

184
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,279
And for centuries we have failed.

185
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,279
But not tonight.

186
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,279
You intergalactic space beings will never win.

187
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,279
We will always band together and stop you.

188
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,639
At any cost.

189
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,949
Such a pity.

190
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,949
It's too bad, really.

191
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:17,120
Our DNA would have fused together wonderfully.

192
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Now let us show you our true power.

193
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,310
Oh, shit.

194
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,000
Now witness the power of over 2,000 galaxies come bad.

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,500
And yours will be next.

196
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Evil will never win.

197
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,320
Quickly, hero.

198
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
There's not much time.

199
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Take that toothbrush and cast it into the fires about noon.

200
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
I will hold him off as long as I can.

201
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,370
Take that!

202
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:05,480
Maldome.
