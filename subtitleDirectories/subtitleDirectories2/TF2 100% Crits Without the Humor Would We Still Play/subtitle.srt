00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,820
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:20,820
And tonight, gonna be playing as a bunch of different people. I think it's the Demoman, the Soldier, and the Scout.

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,820
I believe I could be wrong. I don't know how I edited this together.

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,820
But it's okay, because I'm not really gonna be talking about the gameplay all that much.

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
I'm gonna be talking about Team Fortress 2, and specifically...

6
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,820
Well, first of all, this is a 100% crit gameplay, not meant to be taken all that seriously.

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,820
And that's the point of this whole video. TF2 is not a very serious game.

8
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,820
I mean, there are, of course, the competitive aspects of this game.

9
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,820
There are the very hunker-down focus, get a bunch of kills as whatever your favorite class is.

10
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:59,820
But this game is meant, at least for me, primarily for the humor and the hilarity of every single moment.

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,820
There's at least one or two moments per round that I laugh at the screen for.

12
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:11,819
Like, heavy, like eating a sandwich and then getting backstabbed while the Spy then goes onto the point and gets hit in the face by a frying pan.

13
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:14,819
Like, these things happen all the time in this game.

14
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,819
And I really do truly think that this is sort of where I'm taking this video.

15
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:24,239
If Team Fortress 2 did not have the humor, where would it be?

16
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,239
Would it just fall into forgotten memories, or would we ever play this game that much anymore?

17
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,239
If the Spy didn't have revenge kill lines, if there were no fully voice acted characters, there were no meet the team videos,

18
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:45,239
if this was just a first person shooter and nothing else in a phong shaded world, would we still be playing right now at this point?

19
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,799
I don't think so. I don't think I would still be playing.

20
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:58,799
If Team Fortress went with the original design for Team Fortress 2, which was a more serious guys in camo outfits with rifles and stuff,

21
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,799
if that really was what it was and there was no character, there was no humor, there was no ridiculous moments,

22
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,099
I probably would have played it for a couple years maybe and then I would have probably moved on to something else.

23
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:16,340
Now I'm not sure if that's because I really love cartoons, I love animation, I love the voice acting behind different characters,

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,340
I love when people are brought to life and they don't really exist anywhere else and there's a whole lot of comedy,

25
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,340
I love Cartoon Network, all the adult swim shows, I love that stuff.

26
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:33,780
So not having it really just go, it's like meh, this game was fun for a while, but you know, whatever, I'm done with it.

27
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,780
What else is it? What time is it? Can I like do something else?

28
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,780
I would say the same thing about the Grand Theft Auto series.

29
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:49,780
There is a reason why the GTA series does so well and performs so well and gets such high ratings and has such a huge replayability factor.

30
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,780
It's because the game is bat shit crazy, like you can do the most ridiculous things in that game.

31
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,780
It's not meant to be taken that seriously unless you're playing obviously the campaign, but even the campaign does not take itself seriously.

32
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,780
People blow across the screen in cars and the cops like fly off buildings and stuff.

33
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,780
It's insanity and that's the reason why I keep going back and playing that game.

34
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,780
But I want to hear what you guys have to say about this.

35
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,780
What do you think is your favorite crazy moments in quotes game? Is it something like Team Fortress?

36
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,780
What's the craziest most hilarious thing you've ever seen in Team Fortress 2?

37
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,780
We'll start with that.

38
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:34,340
So I guess I'll go first because obviously there's nobody else in this room, so I guess I'll go first.

39
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:42,340
So anyways, my favorite most hilarious Team Fortress 2 moment is something that I recorded and it unfortunately got deleted.

40
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:49,340
I was going to show it because I wanted to talk about this and I was going to show it right freaking now, but it is no longer in existence.

41
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,340
What happened was I was playing as the spy and I was completely tryharding.

42
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,340
I was trying to get I was trying to get a gameplay backstabbing people, pull out the rubber, bang, bang, bang, getting a couple kills.

43
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,340
Go after this guy, get behind him.

44
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,340
I was trying to get a gameplay and I ended up turning a corner.

45
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,340
This was on viaduct right where one of the buildings are on the enemy team side.

46
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,340
I was in the building and I walked around the corner and there was a sniper there.

47
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,340
The sniper saw me.

48
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,340
He knew I was a spy and we started dancing.

49
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,340
He started to try quick scoping me.

50
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,339
He tried to then come in with the melee back up like I was trying to shoot him with the revolver.

51
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:25,879
And then we just stopped and then he crouched and I crouched and we walked into each other while we were still crouching.

52
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,879
I kept on calling him a spy.

53
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,879
He kept on saying yes over and over again.

54
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:35,879
And for about 45 seconds to two minutes, I don't know what the exact time was, we were just sitting there doing that.

55
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,879
And the whole time this is on viaduct.

56
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,879
There were just there was shit going on all around us.

57
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,879
A pyro, an enemy pyro actually came over and looked at us and then walked away.

58
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,879
He didn't want to interfere with our like weird tea party moment we were having.

59
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:55,879
I was cracking up so hard and I'm so mad that I didn't have it recorded because I was going to put it right here.

60
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,879
It was hysterical.

61
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,879
Why did that happen?

62
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,879
You can't do that in Call of Duty.

63
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,879
You can't do that in Battlefield.

64
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,879
You can't do that in any other game besides the hilarious Team Fortress 2.

65
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,500
And with that, that's going to wrap up the video guys.

66
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:19,500
So in the comment section again, please, if you can remember, leave me what you think your funniest Team Fortress 2 moment has been thus far.

67
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
And thank you so much for watching everybody.

68
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
You really do appreciate it.

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
And I'll talk to you all next time.

70
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
And of course, take care everybody.
