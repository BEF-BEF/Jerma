1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,629
Hey everybody, get out of the way! Hey everybody, what's going on? It's Jerma the Cactus here.

2
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:24,809
Oh, that's a tree. Let's switch now. Hey, what's up everybody? Jerma here, and Italics and MLC Stealth.

3
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:31,809
Welcome to Timed Chaos Build, where we build crazy stuff in a timed amount of time. And you two introduce yourself.

4
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:35,619
I know they know who you guys are, but still, it could be fun. I'm looking at you.

5
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:44,619
I am Italics, and my channel is Gamers Descent, and you've probably seen me with Jerma in Minecraft and against him previously. Woohoo!

6
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:46,619
Alright, where's MLC Stealth? Where are you?

7
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,990
I'm right here, I just found this guy. My name's MLC Stealth.

8
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:58,420
Hey, stop it! Stop breaking stuff. People are going to see the pit that was hidden under here that we just patched up.

9
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,420
We're like dead bodies. Children bodies.

10
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:14,659
Alright, so if you're not familiar how this works, we time ourselves. It's going to be eight minutes this time, and we're going to try and build a horse in eight minutes in today's episode.

11
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:21,659
And once eight minutes is up, we have to stop hands up in the air. We can't do anything else, so let's get this started. Are you guys ready to build a horse?

12
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,099
We're ready. Yes.

13
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:32,180
So, on the count of three, eight minutes. Three, two, one, go!

14
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,670
Alright, hooves should be black, right? Start with the feet.

15
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,849
So, the horse is going to be brown?

16
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,849
Yeah, the horse is going to be brown. This is going to be a huge freaking horse, man. That's a pretty big hoof.

17
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:45,340
Alright, that is a big hoof.

18
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Any forders?

19
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,340
That's a big hoof, yeah.

20
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,909
Hold on, I'm trying to figure out, like, should we do this? He's going to have, like, skeletal legs.

21
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:57,859
Wait, wait.

22
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:01,859
The front two, wait, should they be staggered, like he's walking?

23
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,859
Yeah, I think he should just be relaxing, maybe?

24
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,859
Alright, just, like, standing at attention.

25
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,930
Reading the Sunday newspaper? Alright, I'll get this leg.

26
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,930
Are those two close together?

27
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,229
I think they're okay.

28
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:17,229
I think so.

29
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:23,539
Dude, I'm waking, this leg is way too big.

30
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:32,520
This is going to be a huge creation. We only have, like, seven minutes left. Go, go, go. No more dilly-dallying.

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,819
Okay, maybe not.

32
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:39,090
Legs go straight up for a little while. Yours doesn't.

33
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,090
No, it's okay. It's okay, he has a broken leg, don't worry.

34
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,259
What the crap is going on here? Okay.

35
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:48,259
And now it's his body.

36
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:53,259
Alright, so you close the body together. Oh my god, dude.

37
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:55,259
Why is he the same?

38
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,500
This is going to be the derpiest horse I've ever seen.

39
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,960
Hurry up, we don't have time.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,330
Mine doesn't have any knees.

41
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,330
Just go. We don't have time for this.

42
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,319
It's just going, like, straight up. It's going to be like a stick figure horse.

43
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,319
There's no time.

44
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,949
We kind of just have to build it.

45
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:23,449
Oh my god, why do we make the legs so big? We're never going to finish this.

46
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:27,449
Mine's kind of like, mine's like sprouting fat.

47
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:29,449
Oh my gosh, this is going to be huge.

48
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:32,449
This is going to be an enormous horse.

49
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:38,620
Alright, first of all, his body can't come out further than his legs.

50
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,620
Oh god, that's why.

51
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,620
He's so short. It's the shortest horse I've ever seen.

52
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,620
Alright, two minutes and 18.

53
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,620
This is like a wiener dog horse.

54
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,620
We're making a dachshund.

55
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,620
Alright, we can change animals. We can change animals.

56
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,620
It's okay.

57
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,620
It's got to stick to the guns, man. It's got to be a horse.

58
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,110
What's the deciding factor that makes it not a dog and not a horse?

59
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,110
A long face. Actually, a dachshund has a long face, too.

60
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,349
That's not going to work, then.

61
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:17,350
Alright, no more messing around.

62
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,350
No more messing around. We've got to get the body done.

63
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,910
Alright, am I allowed to make a daytime again?

64
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,910
Yes, alright.

65
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,620
Dude, this is not even...

66
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,620
Why is this leg so skinny?

67
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,620
Dude, he's like tiny Tim.

68
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,620
What the hell?

69
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,180
Alright, I'll work on the belly.

70
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,180
I'll work on the head. I'll work on the head.

71
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,699
I was also going to work on the belly.

72
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,699
Too late. I'm already doing it.

73
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,699
How am I going to make this? I have no idea what I'm doing, man.

74
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,699
I have absolutely no idea.

75
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,329
Alright, work on his back. He's got to have an arched back.

76
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:01,329
He's got to be round. He can't be flat.

77
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:06,329
Dude, if this thing was alive, it would come alive and just be like, please kill me.

78
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:09,329
Please, please kill me.

79
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:15,149
This is like an anteater.

80
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,149
Alright, almost four minutes.

81
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:19,779
We've got to put like a sack on it.

82
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:22,779
Oh my god.

83
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:28,579
I'm laughing too much. I can't even do this.

84
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:32,209
I'm really out of health on this sack.

85
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,699
Oh my god, I'm stuck.

86
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,699
It looks like a really derpy camel.

87
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:43,779
It's like a really flat camel.

88
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:47,779
This is like a truck disguised as a camel.

89
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:52,779
This is like a Trojan horse camel.

90
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:56,959
My whole body hurts right now.

91
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,959
It really is a camel.

92
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,959
Oh my god. How do you make a horse's face?

93
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,389
I don't know how.

94
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:08,389
It's Alex. You're like the smart one. Get over here.

95
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:10,389
I don't know how to make a horse's face.

96
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:13,209
Alright, finish the belly. Make the belly round.

97
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:16,699
Four minutes and 40 seconds.

98
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,699
Alright, how do you make a horse's face?

99
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,699
Is this the face?

100
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,699
This is not a horse.

101
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,139
This is like a...

102
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:28,139
I don't know what this is.

103
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,139
It's like Snoopy.

104
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,379
He's got no neck, dude.

105
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:36,680
Just fix it.

106
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Five minutes.

107
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,329
Alright, we have to close this up right now.

108
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:45,629
That's what I'm doing.

109
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:48,129
We've got to put a door on this thing.

110
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:51,329
It's basically like a house.

111
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,209
I can't even do it.

112
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:56,209
What are you doing?

113
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,209
I'm destroying it.

114
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,209
There was no neck there, dude.

115
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:02,209
There's no time for destroying.

116
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:04,209
Watch. Watch me.

117
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:06,209
I've got time.

118
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,209
I'll work on the tail. He's going to have a big gray tail.

119
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:10,209
We've got to have some more colors in here.

120
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:13,449
Give him some spots. He's just one big round dude.

121
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:19,209
Man, that was the hardest I've laughed all week, definitely.

122
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:27,089
This looks like there's a spoon up his ass.

123
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:35,250
It looks like one of those toy things and you turn it and something happens.

124
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,250
And it winds up.

125
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,250
This looks painful. I'm sorry, Mr. Horse.

126
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,250
Why is it so straight?

127
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,250
I don't know. I don't know how to make things bushy. They can't.

128
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,620
He's got like a platypus's tail.

129
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:59,660
I'm making some ears. I don't know what I'm doing exactly.

130
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,660
I'll clean up the bottom of the belly.

131
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:07,180
He's got horns. I'm turning him into a steer.

132
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,180
Horses have ears.

133
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,180
Look, he's a bull now.

134
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,959
Oh my God.

135
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,259
Actually, this is not a bad bull.

136
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:22,269
Change of plans. Our horse is now a platypus bull.

137
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:26,639
Go down here. I've got to get down here and change this.

138
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,009
I've got to trim the fat off his legs.

139
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,730
It's a little too weird over here.

140
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:40,000
Oh God. This is bad.

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How much time do we have?

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We have less than one minute.

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What?

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Put eyes on it now.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What are you doing? What is this?

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,370
He's saddled.

147
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,370
Oh, okay.

148
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,990
He's got a broken neck.

149
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,990
He looks like a turkey.

150
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,440
Fix his turkey neck.

151
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,899
Nice. Good eyes.

152
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,899
Wow. That's a cow.

153
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:17,899
This guy is perfectly square.

154
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,899
We only have 15 seconds.

155
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:23,710
I've got to make his mouth open like a carrot.

156
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,399
We only have 10 seconds.

157
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,620
I've got to put the apple in his mouth.

158
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,889
Three, two, one.

159
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,889
That's it.

160
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
Is that still a horse?

161
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
He turned it into a bull?

162
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
I don't know.

163
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,950
I don't know what that is.

164
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,129
He looks all right to me.

165
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:53,370
Somebody broke his leg right here.

166
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,370
Somebody took a baseball bat and just...

167
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:02,679
Somebody just carved his whole front muscle up.

168
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,740
He's got a big walk back here.

169
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
What is this mouth?

170
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,740
What's the deal with this huge mouth in the front?

171
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,169
He's chewing.

172
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:16,169
There's the apple.

173
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:22,070
We're going to name him something, of course, as tradition.

174
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:27,070
His mouth and his face looks like the grandpa thumbnail face.

175
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,070
I say we just call him Brokeback because that's what he looks like to me.

176
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,500
Brokeback.

177
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,500
In the comments section, give him a name if you want.

178
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:43,620
Of course, give us a rating 1 out of 10 because that's the way we roll.

179
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,620
I guess that's going to wrap it up, guys.

180
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,620
This is his...

181
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
We're going to give this guy a whole farm of animals.

182
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,620
Hang on.

183
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,620
Are we allowed to make modifications here to this guy?

184
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,620
No modifications allowed.

185
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,250
Can we delete the modifications?

186
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,679
He needs a cowboy hat to go with...

187
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:04,679
That's his chef's hat.

188
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,240
What is with this guy's eyes, man?

189
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,909
Seriously, that's five different types of drugs in his bloodstream.

190
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:16,909
When you go to get ice cream from the guy who's driving around the street,

191
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:22,909
you get a Bugs Bunny character and he has those oogly-googly yellow eye gumdrop things on the ice cream.

192
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:24,909
You are absolutely correct.

193
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:27,149
Wow, that's awesome.

194
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,149
That's going to wrap it up here, guys.

195
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:31,149
Thanks so much for watching.

196
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,149
Of course, take care, everybody.
