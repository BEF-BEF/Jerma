1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:14,679
Oh, no, that was a shpee. He just jumped out to try to stab me in the face.

2
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:28,489
Get out of town. Arc those bullets. Yeah

3
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:38,130
Right click is sandwich. All right, these guys put the sentry on top of the point. Oh

4
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:46,670
Get it. There we go. We got one more point to cap. Sentry, sentry, sentry, sentry. Look out, look out, look out

5
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:52,299
There's the sentry. God, it's so hard to arc these bullets. I'm almost dead

6
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:57,820
Look, what if I just sit here and spam over there? Oh, they disappear. There's actual range on these. Good to know

7
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,600
Please

8
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,680
Kill him, kill him

9
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
No

10
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:22,540
What? The pyro looks like a skeleton. Look at this like scream mask he has on. He looks like an anteater scream mask

11
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,290
What the fuck is that?

12
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,090
Let's go air blast some motherfuckers right now

13
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:40,849
Come on get in range. Air blast. Fuck. I don't have enough ammo. God damn it.

14
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,530
I gotta get a couple of kills with the pyro. I mean, come on. There it is. Oh, let me get that last hit

15
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,200
What the hell was that medic doing? Medic, that was not a safe choice

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,019
Capped this last point. You want to go Engie? I should probably stay on that. Oh spy. I got the spy

17
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,319
Don't let him build that sentry. Nice job. Nice job. You have no health

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,669
Let's hope you don't get destroyed. We're gonna win. I saw that spy. Yeah

19
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,479
Get burnt. There we go. Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

20
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:31,069
Let's go scout. What are these like generators? Double jump. Cool. Cool. I love this jump noise

21
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:34,419
I kind of want this in regular TF2

22
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,849
I'm gonna like figure out how to like mod that and like put that in as like a jump file

23
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,340
Too many people on red

24
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:52,159
Too many red people. Too many red team. Too many red team. Gotta play it like you actually play scout

25
00:02:54,099 --> 00:03:07,849
Are there any unlockables in this game? Gotta try hard. Hold on. Oh, I gotta double try hard. Oh, he blew himself up

26
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:15,680
Fucking god, that's the second time that's happened. This guy with his like direct hit bullshit

27
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,189
Oh, Jarvis getting a little mad here. Calm down. It's okay. It's just gang garrison. Is this the guy? This is the guy

28
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:29,819
How many shots does it take to you get to the center of a goddamn soldier? That's what I want to know

29
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:39,460
I got him at least I got him. That's all I care about all I care about is I killed that guy now make it to

30
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:46,719
Their generator room just run by everybody. You're the scout. Jerma. Come on. Let's go here. There it is generator

31
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,879
There's a got up. They got a century in here

32
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,560
David this guy's trying what?

33
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,000
What I killed a spy how the hell did that happen?

34
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:12,219
All right, I want to get this guy. This guy is just causing me all kinds of trouble

35
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:25,519
Yeah, let's go. Why is the engineer? There it is. This thing is almost dead. We're gonna lose

36
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,089
We're going to lose right now. I can't even get in that room

37
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:34,040
We need like somebody to take out that century. I hear the two soldiers again

38
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,029
Oh, bye and there's a century in here still in here. Yeah, it is. I'm so dead. Goodbye

39
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,689
Go down to like the sewers. Yeah bait him. That's what you want. Do you want to bait him? You want to bait him?

40
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:53,759
Get baited. Yeah, this guy knows I have like no HP. Come on shoot me

41
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,110
What a pain in the ass I am

42
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:05,079
No, damn, I would have probably would have killed him

43
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:14,629
Something tells me it's gonna be really really friggin difficult to place by because it's only on a 2d plane

44
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:21,050
Somebody's just gonna spam over here and like I did earlier and just kill me. There's no disguise. I don't think I'm just cloaked

45
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:30,040
Looks like the cloak is infinite though. So that's good. That's good. What is that friendly fire? No way

46
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:41,040
It's gonna get behind enemy lines and wait for some sorry sucker to come over here. What is that? The cave story guy?

47
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,160
All right, the 10th class you heard it here folks is the 10th class is confirmed the cave story guy

48
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:00,170
Okay, okay. Okay. Here we go. Gonna get the backstab right here. Oh my god

49
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
That's so slow. Oh

50
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
I did it

51
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,209
Big step. All right. I got him big step

52
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,569
I actually got both of them makes them shit. I

53
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,750
Can't believe I actually

54
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,470
know get him I

55
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:41,600
Kind of like spy spy is a lot of fun. Let's follow this. Let's follow this asshole up here

56
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:48,899
How does he know I'm here didn't bump into me? How does this guy know I'm here? There's no way he knows

57
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:56,610
I'm cloaked right now. What a bastard. I can't even make this jump. Anyways, all right, he's gonna come back up here

58
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:10,959
Here's another scout get over here screw it. We're going this way. It's bubble gun bullshit. What the hell you can't what?

59
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:20,500
How am I supposed to combat this? It's just a but it's cool. They have like these D made maps. That's very interesting

60
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:28,769
Very interesting. I'm going down below. Forget this. I'm gonna come up from the pine

61
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,750
Or we can just spawn camp them that will that'll work, too

62
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:41,579
This guy is legitimately just firing into the spawn waiting for someone to appear. Oh my god, this is awful

63
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,589
Spawn camp city come on now

64
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:52,509
Who am I to say that? I'm probably gonna just jump down and try to backstab someone

65
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:59,430
Well, we got striking similarities between TF2 and gang garrison. The spawn camping is in both games

66
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,009
striking similarities

67
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,509
You gotta be kidding me
