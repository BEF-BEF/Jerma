00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,699
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with the Midnight Launch of Mists of Pandaria.

2
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:19,699
I'm actually here with MLC Stealth Live here. Say hello.

3
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,699
Hello, everyone. We're making pandas.

4
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,699
We're making pandas. The Mists of Pandaria just literally launched like five seconds ago.

5
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:33,700
It is three o'clock in the morning here right now, so it's very late for me, but still I want to make a panda.

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:41,240
Gotta be playing as a monk, the new class in World of Warcraft in this expansion. Found Darian, the race, and let's go, let's make him.

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,859
Alright, I'm gonna be typical panda color.

8
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:54,820
Dude, I might be like tabby cat panda. Like look at, I look like a cat. This looks like my cat that's in my house right now.

9
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,500
That's so funny.

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,219
That's what I'm doing. Yeah.

11
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:08,079
Alright, is he gonna be a male? Face. Alright, he's gotta have a really stupid face.

12
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,510
Female panda looks kind of cute. Not gonna lie.

13
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,939
Does it? No.

14
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:24,170
Oh, MLC Stealth loves those female pandas.

15
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,170
Alright, let's go back to male. Oh, did I lose it? No, I didn't. Okay.

16
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,920
Oh my god.

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,420
Are there a lot of people here?

18
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,189
Oh, hey, hey, look at everybody. I wonder if you guys just installed the game.

19
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:43,879
I just see a thousand people climbing these steps.

20
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,879
Dude.

21
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:48,500
Wow.

22
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
There's so many people here.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,500
We all look the same, like ridiculous.

24
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Wait, what do I got for my first move? Jab?

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,739
Look at all these people just practicing.

26
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:03,739
I can't even click on the quest giver.

27
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,709
Where is he?

28
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,400
Oh, man. Oh, this guy broke the, I wanna hit that thing.

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,729
Oh, wow. This is cool. Oh, everyone's training.

30
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:16,729
What is this, quickening palm?

31
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:20,990
Oh, man. Oh my gosh.

32
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,680
Look how fake this looks. We're all wearing the same armor and it looks ridiculous.

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,680
Hey, did you see my Winnie the Pooh character yet?

34
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,330
What the hell was that? What the hell was that?

35
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,699
What the hell was that over there?

36
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:39,129
What just came out of the water? Something enormous just came out of the water over here.

37
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:41,689
I don't know what you're talking about.

38
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:45,500
Hold on. Did you see that?

39
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
No. Where are you? Can I jump down there?

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,500
I need to add you.

41
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,430
Okay, Jerma, I'll give you a hundred dollars if you can find somebody who's not panda monk.

42
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,469
Hold on. Oh, I found a priest. I found a priest.

43
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:15,569
Congrats. You're the only panda priest in WoW.

44
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,569
In WoW.

45
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,750
What?

46
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,750
We're supposed to kill trainees in here. There's no way we're getting like a kill for this.

47
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,750
Are you serious?

48
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,750
Get in here. You're supposed to kill six of them.

49
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,379
There's no way. This is impossible.

50
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,379
This is just chaos.

51
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:47,189
Wait, did I get hit?

52
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:50,189
Oh my God. Can we just make a raid and just...

53
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,189
Oh, wait. Yeah. Nice. Nice.

54
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:55,189
Hold on. Oh my God, dude.

55
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:59,259
Yeah, like you were saying before, I love how this is supposed to be very, very personal.

56
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:02,259
Look at how personal this is.

57
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,259
Take a look at how personal this is.

58
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:09,259
I'm being trained by the Shaolin master monk.

59
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,259
And he's training like just us.

60
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:13,259
He's just training me right now.

61
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,500
I'm being trained, but me and Stealth are the only people in here being trained. It's so personal.

62
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
I don't even know where we're supposed to take this.

63
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,050
Hold on. Burn the Edict of Temperance.

64
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,350
I don't know. I love how everyone's doing the same jump down the stairs.

65
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,350
It's so... That's one of the most addicting things in Warcraft.

66
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,350
It's just jumping down the stairs.

67
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,350
Everybody does it.

68
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,720
Over the bridge. Right, which bridge?

69
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
This place is awesome looking.

70
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Just hold on. I've got to get into Alt-Z here.

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I want to... Look at this.

72
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,019
This is really, really cool.

73
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:54,019
Alt-Z, huh? Oh, that takes for the HUD.

74
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:59,480
Yeah. I'm going to take a look at some stuff first.

75
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Oh, wow. Look at that water. Look at the stream.

76
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,779
Everything is so beautiful.

77
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,779
So finesse. So wonderful.

78
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:08,779
Yeah, look at this.

79
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:13,329
It's so lovely. I just want to live here all day.

80
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:17,329
Oh my god. What are you doing?

81
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:19,399
Did you die?

82
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,899
No.

83
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:23,899
Oh, it is going to be such a pain in the ass for you to get back up here.

84
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,069
We've got to wait for the cart driver.

85
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:28,069
I wish there was an AOE move. Just like...

86
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:30,439
Are you ready?

87
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,439
Wait, wait, wait.

88
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,439
Get it! Get it! Get it!

89
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,439
We didn't get it.

90
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,439
I didn't get any. Did you get any?

91
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,740
Wait, I don't think we were supposed to be killing these.

92
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,740
We need to kill those because they have the stone supplies.

93
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,740
Oh my god.

94
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,740
Get ready again. You ready?

95
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,740
Ready? No. Ready?

96
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,740
Hold on. He spawns right here.

97
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,240
I'm going to seriously just go into first person mode.

98
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
Get it! Get it! Get it!

99
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
I didn't get it. This guy beat us.

100
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
One more time. Third time's the charm.

101
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,670
Hold on.

102
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,670
This guy's going to help.

103
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,670
Here it comes. We've got to get it. We've got to get credit for it.

104
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,670
Get it! Get it!

105
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,670
Yes!

106
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,670
You got that one?

107
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,670
No, I didn't.

108
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,670
Hit him!

109
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:22,730
Oh my gosh.

110
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,209
That's so funny.

111
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:28,209
I can't believe this is how we're doing this right now.
