1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,619
This guy looks like he's waiting for a bus.

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,140
Get out of my way.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,640
Yeah, fuck you.

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,140
This is the same person talking.

5
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,949
I didn't even do that. I didn't even do that. Why? I did not press any button to hit him.

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:25,949
He just hit him.

7
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

8
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,549
So what's next?

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,879
Alright, this really does sound like...

10
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:08,879
This sounds like somebody was just at a bar drinking with their buddies.

11
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,879
And held a microphone in front of someone, one of their friends.

12
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,879
Which is like, hey, can you...

13
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:18,629
Can you do like a fucking shitty pirate voice for me?

14
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:24,900
Be brave, son of a bitches.

15
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,900
Alright, this swear guy is seriously driving me crazy.

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Be brave, motherfuckers.

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
This is all he does.

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
There's a guy on this boat that's just saying a variation of the same insult.

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Be brave, pile of shit.

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,200
He's telling us to be brave in the same sentence. He's calling us names.

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Which one is it?

22
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:47,629
Be brave, fuckers.

23
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,250
We're sinking.

24
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,250
We don't die today, you bitches.

25
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:13,509
Well, first I'm going to stab him.

26
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,509
And then I'm going to butt him.

27
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:16,509
And then I'm going to butt him again.

28
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:18,509
And then I'm going to butt him again.

29
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:19,509
And then I'm going to stab him.

30
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:20,509
And then I'm going to stab him.

31
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:26,500
I guess a cup of drinks would make me think that it's all out.

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,469
Why does he keep telling me to do the fear skill?

33
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:33,469
Who do I have to...

34
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:34,469
I did not mean to shoot that guy.

35
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:35,469
Didn't mean to kill that guy.

36
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:37,469
I really didn't. I'm trying to do the fear skill.

37
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:39,469
Nobody seems to care though.

38
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:40,469
Apparently that guy...

39
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,469
Nobody cares about that guy.

40
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:43,469
Everyone's cool.

41
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:44,469
All right, we're good.

42
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:48,180
Look, a guy sleeping on the dock.

43
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,180
What do you know?

44
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,490
Hey, who's got a gun here?

45
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,490
You're going to put a gun on me?

46
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,490
Are you crazy, man?

47
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,490
That thing put somebody's eye out.

48
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,490
I'm tired. I'm going back to bed.

49
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,490
I think I'm good.

50
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,490
Wait, you got a gun still?

51
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,490
Oh my God.

52
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,490
You're going to kill somebody with that thing.

53
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,490
I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.

54
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,490
I'm not tired anymore.

55
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,490
You think I'm tired?

56
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,490
No, I am tired.

57
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,490
No, I'm going to wake up now because you got a gun.

58
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,490
This guy's crazy.

59
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,490
I'm tired again.

60
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,490
No, I'm not tired.

61
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,490
You think I'm tired?

62
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,490
Fuck you.

63
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,490
I'm tired again.

64
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,490
Oh, hey.

65
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,050
I don't want to fight these guys.

66
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,539
I'm riding around like a dinghy boat and these guys are shooting like 300.

67
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:21,539
Oh my God.

68
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,550
There's no way I'm going to be able to fight these guys.

69
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,550
I just like 2%.

70
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,550
I did like not even 1% damage.

71
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,550
We're like instantly getting killed.

72
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,729
I can't even turn the wheel.

73
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:37,819
You need me.

74
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,069
No.

75
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,219
What?

76
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,219
Who's saying you need me?

77
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:51,310
Why is that the fucking reverse of beer?

78
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,620
Yeah.

79
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,620
No.

80
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,259
No.

81
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:59,169
Oh shit.

82
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:00,169
There's a prisoner in here.

83
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:03,860
Get me out of here.

84
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,860
That's not a very secure prison.

85
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,449
Excuse me.

86
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,449
Just go the other way.

87
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,449
Could I use half a crown now?

88
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:13,449
I don't even know what that means.

89
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,449
You just said a nonsense statement.

90
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:16,449
Just please go out the door.

91
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:17,449
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:18,449
I'm on my way.

93
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:19,750
Get on your way.

94
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,750
Go.

95
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,750
I'm going to block this side of the door so you have to fucking go this way.

96
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,120
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
I'm on my way.

98
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,089
Go.

99
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:29,089
Turd sniffer?

100
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:31,089
Did you just call me a turd sniffer?

101
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:39,779
They're all like bumbling all over each other and like saying excuse me and like oh I don't

102
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,779
want any trouble.

103
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:46,889
Whoa.

104
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:47,889
Oh.

105
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:48,889
Oh.

106
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,829
God.

107
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:51,829
Dude.

108
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:52,829
I can't beat this.

109
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:54,259
I can't beat this like hen house.

110
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,259
That's all I hear.

111
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:00,259
Literally that's all I fucking hear right now.

112
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,259
It's making me want to die.

113
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:03,759
Go.

114
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,759
Go.

115
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,790
Go.

116
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,790
Go.

117
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,350
Did I get out?

118
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,420
What is that nightmare?

119
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,009
You cannot be serious right now.

120
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,009
What?

121
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,009
Wait a second.

122
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:37,750
Don't even tell me.

123
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,759
Is this lady?

124
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,759
What?

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,759
No.

126
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,930
Yeah this is a lady pissing into a bush.

127
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,930
God they keep tempting me.

128
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,930
Stop tempting me with this.

129
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,930
Come on.

130
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,930
I like don't want to do this.

131
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,930
They keep putting them in the perfect spot for you to push them off the giant scaffolding.

132
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you have any idea how hard it is to not do that?

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Look.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Again.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And this guy.

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,259
This guy's pissing.

137
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,259
No he's not.

138
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:11,259
What is this guy doing?

139
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:14,490
Oh he's throwing up.

140
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,490
He's throwing up into an invisible ground.

141
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:24,300
I don't know why.

142
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Wait was that the guy I was supposed to talk to?

143
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,879
Mind the sodding cannibals.

144
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,879
You guys notice something?

145
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,660
Anything seem a little off to you guys?

146
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,660
At all?

147
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,660
Just listen.

148
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:46,459
I found you cowards.

149
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,459
They patched him out of the game.

150
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:51,459
The last clip you saw was like two and a half days ago.

151
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,459
They removed.

152
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,459
This is all new dialogue on the boat.

153
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:58,459
Anytime you go on the boat now it's this.

154
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,459
What were the patch notes?

155
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,459
Did they say like oh we removed these scream swears be brave guy.

156
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:08,459
We apologize for his uncalled for insults.

157
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,459
And he has been removed.

158
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:10,459
I want him back.

159
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:11,459
Where is he?

160
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,459
He was an integral part of my crew.
