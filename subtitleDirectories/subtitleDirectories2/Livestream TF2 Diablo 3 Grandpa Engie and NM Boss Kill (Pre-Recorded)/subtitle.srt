1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:26,769
720p for the win. Starting in 15 minutes. Exactly. Let's do it. Alright, ladies and germs.

2
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:37,710
And let us go into a new server. Let's try and see how many people are in my server right now.

3
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:52,219
My server is currently full, but it's okay. We can fill up an empty one.

4
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,979
Just because that's what I typically do anyways. So let's fill up an empty server.

5
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:03,539
Just because I feel like a lot of you guys would rather be able to see where we're playing and you guys in the stream would like to play.

6
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:12,959
So here is the IP. If you can see it on the screen, I'm also going to put it in here.

7
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:23,150
It's going to be... Oh god, I have a lot of tight balls in that statement.

8
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:30,359
And there you go. Posting it right now.

9
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:39,560
Funda Mountain.

10
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Germany needs a catchphrase like Chibi's chocolate sauce.

11
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,400
How long am I going to be streaming Diablo 3?

12
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,400
At least a couple hours. At least.

13
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,540
At least that.

14
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,540
Oh, and is the stream running okay? There's a 360 and a 720 option.

15
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,540
Are both of them looking okay? Or is it... How does it look? Are we good?

16
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,580
Hopefully we're good.

17
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,580
Because this is the first time I've ever streamed in 720 and I think the test went...

18
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,580
The test went okay. I don't know if it's perfect, but it should be better than before.

19
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:28,020
Let's watch the...

20
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:35,169
And while I think about it, let me turn up my fans here.

21
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:42,759
How is that even possible?

22
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:50,139
Diablo 3 looks... Oh no, Diablo 3 is fun, man.

23
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:57,139
I got a lot of problems I have with it, but they are overshadowed by the fact that the game is really good.

24
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:02,259
So I can't really complain.

25
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:07,650
I have a major, major problem with it though, and it's something I can't get over.

26
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,650
I'll probably talk about it in...

27
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,830
The video I do when I review the game.

28
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:24,229
When I actually review the game, I will talk about it.

29
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:27,620
Where is everybody?

30
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,419
Where is everybody?

31
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:36,180
Somebody want to post the IP again? In the chat?

32
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,180
Oh, make sure, if you haven't already done it, select update automatically.

33
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,270
For your stream thing on the chat window.

34
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,219
Yah, yah.

35
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:56,810
It's going to be 1v1. There's a lot of spots in this server.

36
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,810
I'll do this, so you guys can see.

37
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,810
Because maybe the chat is lagging or something.

38
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,620
This is the server.

39
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,620
63.146.183.23.27015.

40
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,990
If you take a look at it right now, write it down maybe.

41
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,089
That's where we're going to be for a little while.

42
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,089
And hopefully you guys got it by now, so I'm going to close it, and here we go.

43
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:26,980
The only problem with Diablo 3 is the constant...

44
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,980
That's another thing that's kind of shaky in my opinion as well.

45
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,600
What's up, ZCS? How you doing, bro?

46
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,269
The combat is incredible though.

47
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:40,269
It is one of the most satisfying combat games.

48
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:43,269
At least action RPG combat games ever played.

49
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:47,019
Playing a barbarian if you didn't see the video.

50
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:51,420
Man, what's going on? Is this...

51
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,420
Are we getting like a crash or something? No one's really joining.

52
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:03,779
What is going on with this server?

53
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,259
People should be able to join.

54
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,259
Yah, I'll go online. That makes more sense.

55
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,060
Alright, you can join off me.

56
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,060
You can join off me.

57
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,860
You can, and in fact will join off me.

58
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:31,660
Yah, I gotta go over to Twitch and say it's not going to be there.

59
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,899
The only reason why it's not on Twitch is because I wanted 720.

60
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:38,899
And I don't have a partnership with Twitch.

61
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:43,899
I never plan on really getting a partnership because I of course have a machinima contract with live streaming, so...

62
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:47,339
I need to utilize it a little bit.

63
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,430
Can somebody do me a favor?

64
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,430
One of the mods I have in my typical Twitch stream.

65
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,430
Can somebody go over there and just tell them that the stream is over here?

66
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,490
Because my window is currently closed.

67
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:10,600
How?

68
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,670
Yah, I'll...

69
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,259
Somebody please go over there.

70
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:22,120
Streaming on the YouTubes.

71
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,490
I'm going to be streaming for a long time, so...

72
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,790
People will figure it out sooner or later I guess, right?

73
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:41,649
I'll probably be streaming for maybe half an hour, maybe 20 minutes.

74
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:47,100
Couple of rounds. I want to get a couple of good rounds though, that's the most important thing.

75
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:54,980
Let me get this thing rolling now.

76
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,980
Let's not tryharden as a scout.

77
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,730
Let's get this rolling. Here we go.

78
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:10,500
Nah, I mean Diablo 3 is taking over the streams.

79
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
By a large margin.

80
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:20,430
Well when I say taking over, I don't mean like...

81
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,430
It's not like taking over, but...

82
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:31,579
I got a bob. Bobarian.

83
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:35,279
Oh! Oh god.

84
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,279
Speaking of jag, I'm getting lag.

85
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,279
What rhymes with jag?

86
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:46,870
Oh, you see that? I threw the milk and it didn't even come out of my hand.

87
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:55,579
Oh, let's go.

88
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:56,579
Candy cake.

89
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:03,850
Yah, TwitchTV has a better chat system.

90
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,850
But this is 720.

91
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,850
And no, I just wanted my Diablo 3 videos to be in 720.

92
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:14,670
For the most part at least.

93
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,670
Oh!

94
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:25,399
Oh, where you going? Where you going?

95
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,980
Nah, we're doing it. Nah, we're doing it.

96
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,990
Oh!

97
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,990
That was like a goomba stomp with the scouter gun. You guys see that?

98
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,990
Ow.

99
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,279
Jerma, killer of steam, is back.

100
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:45,720
Yeah, it's not a...

101
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Everyone's pings look okay.

102
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,200
I think it's the server we're on.

103
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Yeah, it's definitely too many people at the same time.

104
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:07,149
Hey, we gotta stop it.

105
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:09,669
Damn.

106
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:16,320
I can see the YouTube comments. I have a little pop-up window that comes up where I can see whatever you guys are saying.

107
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Say something in this video that could become a real viral saying.

108
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,879
Umm...

109
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,399
I want Burger Boy to go viral.

110
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,700
I want Burger Boy's entire presence to be viral.

111
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
But I don't know if that'll ever happen.

112
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,899
Yes, this will all be uploaded to YouTube. Probably tomorrow afternoon.

113
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:39,809
Oh, God.

114
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,299
That lag.

115
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,210
Alright, I'm gonna appear offline now.

116
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,659
I think it's just too many people trying to join at the same time.

117
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,480
But yes, Burger Boy 2012.

118
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:00,279
Actually, no, let me rephrase that. It's Burger Boy 2012.

119
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,279
Emperor of Earth.

120
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:08,490
That's the hashtag.

121
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,730
Alright, let's see if we can get a good string of non-lag here.

122
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,610
God, they're gonna push it. We're dead.

123
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:21,299
No, this is not good.

124
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:25,210
That's a dead ring for sure.

125
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:32,379
We all okay up there?

126
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:34,379
You are a spy.

127
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:38,090
We don't have a medic, do we? I might have to go medic.

128
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,460
Germa, say...what do you want me to say?

129
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,460
Alpha...I missed it. Alpha something, something, something.

130
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:50,419
God, that's such a laggy shot. I shot him five seconds later he got hit.

131
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:56,399
Oh, God. Oh, God.

132
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,899
Oh, God, I'm dead.

133
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,289
Oh, my word.

134
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm watching Germa and eating brownies.

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,519
Brownies are good, man. I love brownies.

136
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,700
So, if Burger Boy was president of the United States of America,

137
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,879
what do you think his first legislature would be?

138
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,360
Spy over here. I just saw him.

139
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Oh, no, is it soldier actually?

140
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
That guy just floated.

141
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,120
So, reserve shooter is becoming my default.

142
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,360
I love this thing.

143
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,539
Oh, no.

144
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,779
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

145
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,370
Oh, God, this is bad.

146
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,370
He's gonna kill me.

147
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:54,830
God, give me the health.

148
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,830
Oh, good spy, good spy.

149
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,389
Good backstab.

150
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:05,049
Oh, good medic, good medic.

151
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:07,049
Oh, heal me, help me.

152
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:10,529
Oh, I'm gonna die.

153
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:17,029
Too many things going on at the same time.

154
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,029
Do some market gardening.

155
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,029
I'm so bad with the market gardener. I'm terrible.

156
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:24,740
Me, market gardening is like...

157
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:32,620
I'd rather watch paint dry. I'm terrible. I'm like so bad.

158
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,620
Stand on the freaking point, you moron. Stand on it.

159
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:44,399
I didn't get the kill, did I?

160
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,990
Oh, shoot it at me again.

161
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,990
Damn.

162
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,379
Where's grandpa?

163
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:57,379
Grandpa, you want me to get him?

164
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:04,320
I'll get grandpa after this round.

165
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,620
The heavy.

166
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,620
That would be the heavy.

167
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:19,250
Oh, random crits. Ow.

168
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,000
My body.

169
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Gamer class is engineer.

170
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,769
I haven't been playing a whole lot of engineer though.

171
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,769
I've not been playing really any engineer.

172
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:33,769
I don't know why either.

173
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,389
And we're gonna lose the game.

174
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:39,389
I'm ready. People are gonna walk right by me. Watch this.

175
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:42,889
People are gonna walk right by me.

176
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:48,669
Hey.

177
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:52,450
Oh my god.

178
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,799
That kill feed.

179
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:03,830
Oh, so by the way, those of you that were at the stream a couple weeks ago,

180
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:09,830
during the whole debacle where people can see through the backpack, the game show event,

181
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:16,830
I wanted to clarify that Optimus Prime, he could see the backpack,

182
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,830
and he wanted to make sure that it didn't get stolen,

183
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,830
because he's obviously a mod on the stream.

184
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,830
Optimus Prime is not a thief.

185
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,830
Oh god, I'm lagging.

186
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,649
He is not a thief.

187
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:32,649
He did that in the merits of his own heart to try and protect the unusual hat.

188
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:34,649
Oh my god, I can't even walk.

189
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,889
Yeah, I can't even walk either. What the hell is going on?

190
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:49,279
Maybe if we all crouch, the lag will go away.

191
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,279
If you're wondering, I am working on a new solution

192
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,279
to figure out how to do another stream like that and have it work.

193
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,899
I mean, it worked. It was okay after the first 15 or 20 minutes,

194
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,460
but there were a lot of issues, and I will figure them out.

195
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,460
And I'm gonna get overcharged right out the gate, and I'm gonna mess something up here.

196
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,340
I'm gonna be like Sir Derpington.

197
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,340
When you hit this on me, if you're gonna hit it on me...

198
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,340
Actually, don't do it yet. Sit right here.

199
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,340
Sit right here. We're gonna hide.

200
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,340
We're gonna hide right here.

201
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,840
We're gonna eat cookies and pancakes until they come out.

202
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
No, no, hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

203
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,590
Okay, go! Woohoo!

204
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,590
Oh dear god.

205
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,590
Oh, how is he not dead?

206
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,279
How many Ubers did we just have out the gate? You kidding me?

207
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:45,259
That was like... Holy crap, that was a lot of people.

208
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:54,610
Soup can!

209
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,809
Oh god.

210
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:59,809
So after this round, I'm probably gonna move on to my own server,

211
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:04,179
because it's just like chaos.

212
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:09,460
I think too many people are trying to connect at the same time.

213
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,460
What is it?

214
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,460
Every time I hear... Let me tell you...

215
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,460
Agree in the comments if you agree with this.

216
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,460
So every time I hear the ambassador shot,

217
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,460
that like boom, boom, I always think it's not on our team.

218
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,830
Oh my god.

219
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,570
I like broke his legs.

220
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,570
Oh, this is gonna be bad. Bad news for everybody on the cot.

221
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:38,519
Oh, good backstab. Good backstab.

222
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,169
Come at you.

223
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,409
Oh god!

224
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:44,580
Hide.

225
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,450
He's still alive. He's right here.

226
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,740
Oh, dead ring and bastard.

227
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,740
Well, that was... Okay.

228
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
Ugh!

229
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,179
Don't let him get away!

230
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:02,740
He's gonna get away.

231
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,299
Oh god, it's like lagging all over the place.

232
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:07,299
Alright.

233
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,299
Run!

234
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:09,299
Run away!

235
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,789
Alright.

236
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:15,400
Now they think we're running away?

237
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,980
Oh god.

238
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,980
No!

239
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,160
Hey, it was a good run.

240
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
It was a good run.

241
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,099
It was a good run.

242
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:30,779
Ambassador.

243
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:32,089
Or backstab too.

244
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:34,089
Whenever I hear the backstab sound, that...

245
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:35,089
I always go...

246
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:38,089
I freak out and I turn around and look around all over the place.

247
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:45,900
And he spies over there.

248
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:52,509
Oh god, spam everywhere.

249
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:53,509
What just happened?

250
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:55,750
Did I kill that guy?

251
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,119
What?

252
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,359
Oh, Optimus Prime backstabbed him. Okay.

253
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,940
Oh, you need one more shot and you're dead.

254
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,490
No, get out of my face!

255
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,490
Ugh!

256
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,049
Thank you.

257
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,400
For healing me.

258
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
That's a spy.

259
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
That's definitely a spy.

260
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,750
Aw, I'm trying to reflect it.

261
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,500
Get this help over here, bro.

262
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
There you go, buddy.

263
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,000
Oh, they know we're in here. This is not good.

264
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,240
That's a spy.

265
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
No, it's not.

266
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,180
Oh lord!

267
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,380
Oh no.

268
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Uber charge.

269
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,740
Oh, just die.

270
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,740
No, just...

271
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,299
Die!

272
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,299
All I cared about was killing that guy and I didn't even get him.

273
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,059
Aw, damn.

274
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:02,660
Aw, at least I got the pyro.

275
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,180
At least I got the pyro.

276
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,279
Let's go, let's go sniper.

277
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,279
He'll never get me.

278
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:17,849
Spy.

279
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:18,849
Sappin Mountain Spencer.

280
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:21,660
Favorite weapon in Team Fortress 2?

281
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,740
Probably... uh-oh.

282
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,740
Let us take a moment to mourn the loss of this sniper.

283
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,039
He was a good man and all he wanted to do was just snipe

284
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,039
and kill and melee.

285
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,039
I was actually hoping I was gonna get backstabbed.

286
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,039
That was like the whole point there.

287
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,039
I was hoping I was gonna get backstabbed.

288
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,009
Fire, fire, fire.

289
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:48,170
I just heard it.

290
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,170
Where is he?

291
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:54,160
Ah, I thought I was gonna run into that.

292
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,849
Oh god, they're everywhere.

293
00:19:56,849 --> 00:20:01,200
Oh, get away from me.

294
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Crush him, crush him.

295
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Strategy that I never really talk about is the freak out melee.

296
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
It actually works more times than you'd think.

297
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Oh god.

298
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,789
Ow.

299
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:18,250
Hello.

300
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,000
Hold on, that came from Optimus Prime.

301
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What the hell was that?

302
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,259
Optimus Prime just like morphed into a woman for a minute there.

303
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:32,089
Yeah.

304
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:37,940
Did you?

305
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,940
You son of a... you bastard.

306
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,940
Oh, I thought that was actually a spy.

307
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,940
That was funny.

308
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,940
You ducked from my arrow.

309
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:50,099
Ah.

310
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,099
Kill him.

311
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:52,099
Kill him.

312
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:53,099
Chaos.

313
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:54,099
Ah.

314
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:57,200
I lost.

315
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,450
I lose.

316
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,450
I lose.

317
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,329
He's been a woman the whole time.

318
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:08,619
Where am I?

319
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:11,369
I'm actually not doing too terribly.

320
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:19,180
For as laggy as this is being.

321
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,180
Doctor!

322
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,549
Don't worry.

323
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,549
Oh my god.

324
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:27,500
Oh god.

325
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
It is so scary when I just bump into spies.

326
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,119
Then I bump into a second one.

327
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,119
Give me a headshot.

328
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,490
I refuse to put this thing away until I get a headshot.

329
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,140
Come on.

330
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,140
Aw.

331
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,539
Damn.

332
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:50,980
Alright, you want the Boston Basher on there?

333
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,980
I don't even think I have it.

334
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,339
No, I don't even have the Boston Basher.

335
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:58,930
I don't even have the Boston Basher.

336
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,369
I'm not used to it.

337
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:03,369
Oh my word.

338
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,500
Wait a second.

339
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Wait a second.

340
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Wait a second.

341
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
I just shot by him.

342
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,869
And killed the spy that was behind him.

343
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:14,160
Alright, there we go.

344
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
That's three.

345
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,339
Let me get a quad.

346
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:21,650
No, no, no, no.

347
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,950
Damn.

348
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,539
I just freaked out right there.

349
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:28,160
Medic.

350
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,000
Freak out, smash.

351
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Freak out, smash.

352
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It always works.

353
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It always works.

354
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,559
I told you.

355
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:38,569
As long as you just freak out.

356
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:42,569
If you freak the hell out and start swinging at somebody, you probably will kill him.

357
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:47,990
Oh, that's a crit screen.

358
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,990
Chaos.

359
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,359
It's going to be, it's going to work.

360
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,920
When all else fails.

361
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
When all else fails.

362
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Chaos.

363
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,289
Smash.

364
00:22:58,289 --> 00:22:59,289
When all else fails.

365
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:00,289
Chaos.

366
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:01,289
Chaos.

367
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:02,289
Smash.

368
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,589
No, no, hear me.

369
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:15,690
What's up, potato fryer?

370
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:22,019
How you doing, my man?

371
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:24,019
You can't beat the chaos.

372
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:27,180
Smash.

373
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,180
Alright, one more, one more little life here with this huntsman.

374
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,180
And wait, is somebody on the cart?

375
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,809
Going up top.

376
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:36,049
I'm going up top.

377
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:40,359
Yeah.

378
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:44,140
Just shoot down this hallway, man.

379
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
I'll kill somebody.

380
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,140
I'm bumping into a spy, too.

381
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,140
I don't have Jurati.

382
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,630
There he is.

383
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,019
Oh, god.

384
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:54,779
What?

385
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:56,779
How many spies do they have on their team?

386
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:05,990
Alright, I think I'm going to try.

387
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,990
See, here's like the big joke.

388
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,990
See, listen to this, ready?

389
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,990
So my server is full right now, right?

390
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,990
And I can't even get into it.

391
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,359
I have reserve slots set up for myself, but apparently it doesn't work.

392
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,359
I guess not.

393
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,880
So I'm going to try and do this again and see if it works.

394
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,950
And let's see what happens.

395
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:34,200
Yeah, see, server is full.

396
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
I have a reserve slot.

397
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
I'm probably doing it wrong.

398
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Who knows?

399
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
But I'm changing servers.

400
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,529
We're going to go somewhere else.

401
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:45,529
I would go in my server, but there's no way I'm going to get in.

402
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:48,339
I can't even get into my own server.

403
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:54,859
No, this is like, I'm knocking on the door to my own house.

404
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:58,859
And there's like a party going on in my house.

405
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:00,859
That's pretty much the equivalent of this.

406
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:04,859
There is like a crazy party going on in my house right now.

407
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:06,859
They're like breaking vases.

408
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:08,859
Somebody's like puking in the bathroom.

409
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:10,859
And I'm outside just staring at the house.

410
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:12,859
That's pretty much what's going on.

411
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,859
I can't get it.

412
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:17,299
Wait, I can't get it.

413
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:26,259
I can't get it.

414
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:34,190
Wait, connect, you rip?

415
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,009
What is that?

416
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:38,009
Oh, your IP.

417
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:39,009
Yeah, I just tried it.

418
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:40,009
I don't know.

419
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,009
I have it set up.

420
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:42,950
It doesn't work.

421
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,950
I'll try it one more time.

422
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,700
Ready?

423
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
Connect.

424
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Here's the IP.

425
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
Server is full.

426
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,140
And I have a reserve slot.

427
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,140
I don't want to be a jerk.

428
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:00,329
That's my own fault for not having it set up right.

429
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:04,980
Party at Jerma's, but he's not invited.

430
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,980
I'm not invited to my own party.

431
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,720
Oh, I want to check something.

432
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,440
I got to drop that down.

433
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
I do play on Shibby's server.

434
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
I mean, now that I have my server, I kind of...

435
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,440
I try to stay on that as much as I can.

436
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,690
Who's on here?

437
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,690
Is anybody on there that I know?

438
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,019
Nope.

439
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:36,750
All right, new server.

440
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,750
So what's going to happen now is because my house is full of people at a party.

441
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:46,750
We're going to go to somebody else's house that is not having a party right now.

442
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:53,460
So let's go.

443
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,460
Let's see.

444
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,819
No, not RTD.

445
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:03,579
After this, I'm probably going to play some Diablo 3.

446
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:05,579
So here's the IP.

447
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:09,579
If somebody wants to paste that into the chat, it's right there.

448
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:12,579
Because if I do it, it's going to get swarmed.

449
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:14,579
So post that into the chat.

450
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:20,680
By the way, turn on automatic updates for the chat.

451
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
That'll help it with the reload time.

452
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
But that is the IP.

453
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,680
If somebody want to link that, I would be appreciated.

454
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,680
I would be appreciative, not appreciated.

455
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,839
I bet you Burger Boy the dump machine is there.

456
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,339
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

457
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:36,339
Let me get Grandpa.

458
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:37,339
Hold on.

459
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:39,019
Hey, yo, Grandpa.

460
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:41,390
Get down here.

461
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,599
We want to talk to you.

462
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,599
Who wants to talk to me?

463
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,289
Who wants to talk to me?

464
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:50,289
Let me sit here.

465
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:51,289
Sit down.

466
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:52,289
I'm sitting.

467
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:53,289
I told you I'm already sitting.

468
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:55,299
Okay.

469
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,299
All right.

470
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,299
It's question and answer time with Grandpa.

471
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:02,299
So what do you want to ask me?

472
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:07,940
In the comment section, make sure you ask a good question,

473
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,940
or I'm going to punch you in the face,

474
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,940
and you're going to bleed.

475
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,230
Let's play some Red Team.

476
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:21,029
Wait, how come I'm not invited to the party?

477
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:22,029
Where's there a party?

478
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:24,980
Who didn't invite me to the party?

479
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980
I'm the best son of a bitch here.

480
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,980
I'm going to play engineer for a second here.

481
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,980
Put this down.

482
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,980
Put it right here against the wall.

483
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,980
Because you never know, there could be a spy

484
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,980
that's going to come around this corner here

485
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,980
and try and get the spawn.

486
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,980
So I'm going to put that at the spawn door

487
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,980
to make sure no spies get it.

488
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,980
What the hell is going on with this lag?

489
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,859
Oh!

490
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:49,869
Oh!

491
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:51,869
What the hell is going on here?

492
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:56,220
This is the laggiest piece of crap server

493
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,450
I've ever played out of my entire life.

494
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,450
Oh!

495
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,329
How old am I?

496
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:06,329
Somebody want to know how old I am?

497
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:07,329
I am...

498
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,329
You'll never know.

499
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:12,819
You're never going to find out how old I am.

500
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:16,240
Let me get this century...

501
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Help me get this century to level three.

502
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
While the lags...

503
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
While the server lags out.

504
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,990
What?

505
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,990
How does that actually work?

506
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,990
Oh, he's right there.

507
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,990
Get him.

508
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,809
You want me to high five you?

509
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,430
You're not getting a high five from me.

510
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:36,430
Well, my birthday is June 15th, 1918.

511
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:42,230
So if you can figure that out for yourself, go ahead.

512
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,230
What is this game?

513
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,230
Why is it even happening?

514
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,230
Where do I go?

515
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,500
I don't even know where to go in this game.

516
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,500
I just know you build a century here to protect the spawn

517
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
from those bastard spies.

518
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,640
And I'm thirsty, too.

519
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
What the hell is on this guy's head?

520
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,640
What is that?

521
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,819
You look like a freaking Nordic god or something.

522
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:05,819
Get away from me.

523
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:07,819
You're freaking me out.

524
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:12,809
All right, well, this server lags too much.

525
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:15,809
So I'll pull this over here.

526
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:17,240
And he's going to...

527
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Right here is a good spot for the century.

528
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,740
Century going up over here, boys.

529
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,740
It's a good spot for it.

530
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,490
And then the dispenser is going to go, like, over here.

531
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,490
Ah!

532
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,730
Suspect, you're going to go right there.

533
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,730
And then the century shoot people.

534
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,480
And I'm lagging out way too bad.

535
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
This is the worst server ever.

536
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,700
Do I get all the bitches?

537
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,140
Yes.

538
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,140
Absolutely yes.

539
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,950
You might think because I'm old, I don't have any, uh...

540
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,450
I don't have any Lubino left,

541
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,450
but you'd be totally wrong when you put that statement.

542
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,900
So if I kill two people, then I leave.

543
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,900
And I've already killed one, so let's get another kill.

544
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,900
Come on.

545
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,299
What are you...

546
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,299
Get out of here!

547
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,299
You're making me show up on the radar.

548
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,299
This is like Modern Warfare, right?

549
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:15,180
The more you shoot, the more you show up on the radar, right?

550
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,980
Where is the radar?

551
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,980
What are you two doing?

552
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,980
Go fight the battle!

553
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,660
You guys need to fight the war!

554
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,160
What are you doing hitting the thing around here?

555
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
Somebody challenge you to a duel.

556
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,809
What is that?

557
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:38,319
What's that do?

558
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,319
Second kill!

559
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,319
I got a second kill.

560
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,319
That means I can leave and put this century down here

561
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,319
for a suicide century.

562
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:49,500
There we go.

563
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,680
This is the best part of the game right here.

564
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,380
This is where you get all the kills.

565
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,380
Come at me!

566
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,380
Somebody come at me!

567
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,680
Look at this century doing work.

568
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,680
You're a F-U-C-K-I-N-G spy.

569
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
I'm not allowed to swear on these streams.

570
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,680
Jeremy told me I'd get in trouble, so I can't do that.

571
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:15,519
Grandpa, have you ever gone to the bathroom two times a day before?

572
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,519
Yes.

573
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,890
I actually go to the bathroom...

574
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,890
What's going on?

575
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,890
What's going on with that century gun?

576
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,339
Yeah, look out for that bastard spy.

577
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:26,339
He's a Frenchman.

578
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:28,339
All Frenchmen are bastards.

579
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:29,339
We all know that.

580
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:32,519
They're all sneaky, and they steal your stuff,

581
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,519
and they love your women.

582
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,950
What the hell just happened?

583
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:43,930
What just happened to me?

584
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,930
Oh, I'm out of here.

585
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,099
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

586
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,099
This game sucks.

587
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:52,539
Not playing this game again, Jeremy.

588
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:54,539
This game sucks.

589
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:59,869
You need to go take a nap, anyways.

590
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:01,869
You've been up a little too long.

591
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:05,390
You've been up a little too long, Grandpa.

592
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:12,619
Somebody keeps repairing that century, by the way.

593
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:16,759
I didn't even know I was in a duel.

594
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:20,730
I think you're a spy, but I could...

595
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,730
Yeah, I was right.

596
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,730
I was right.

597
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,099
I was right all along,

598
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:28,099
and I cannot land a shot to save my life right now.

599
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:31,380
There you go.

600
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,069
Are you a spy?

601
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:37,380
No, but I'll high-five you anyways.

602
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,190
Yeah.

603
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,880
Whoa.

604
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,880
How did he even get me?

605
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,880
I was too busy choking on my own throat.

606
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:59,420
Is the lag in the game unbearable to watch in the stream,

607
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,420
or is it okay?

608
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,420
How does it look in the actual stream window?

609
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,259
Oh, my God.

610
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:07,259
Chaos.

611
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:09,619
Remember what I taught you guys.

612
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:10,619
Chaos.

613
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:17,070
Chaos.

614
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:28,530
Unlapped.

615
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:32,199
I'm just going to go wrench.

616
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,199
I'm just going to wrench people in the face.

617
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,820
That's all I'm going to do.

618
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,820
There's a guy right here.

619
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,280
I'm not going to get that scout, ever.

620
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,489
Ugh.

621
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:46,489
I'm waiting.

622
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,489
I'm waiting for someone to jump over here

623
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,489
so I can just...

624
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,619
I'm going to freak somebody out.

625
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:51,619
Ready?

626
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:54,269
Let's do this.

627
00:34:54,269 --> 00:34:56,269
I want someone to walk out and land on this.

628
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:58,269
Oh, my God.

629
00:34:58,269 --> 00:35:03,010
Ugh.

630
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:12,219
It's coward killing time.

631
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:19,460
I am a derpington.

632
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,460
I really am.

633
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,460
Whenever I do these live streams,

634
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,460
my brain shuts off,

635
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,460
because I'm looking at the chat talking,

636
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,460
and I'm doing like...

637
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,460
Like, where's your head?

638
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,780
I feel like I just bought the game.

639
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,340
Bring back those memories.

640
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:39,210
Let's get this sentry up.

641
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,389
At least a little bit.

642
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:43,389
I'm not even protecting it.

643
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:44,389
I'm just running away from it

644
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:45,389
every time it goes up.

645
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:49,059
There we go.

646
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:51,059
I really do think...

647
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:53,059
If you're watching this on YouTube right now,

648
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:55,059
did I get more melee kills

649
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:57,059
than...

650
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:59,059
Are you serious?

651
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:00,429
I'm getting...

652
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:01,429
I don't think I've killed anybody

653
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:02,429
with anything else besides melee

654
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:03,429
this entire time.

655
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:04,429
Maybe I killed, like,

656
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:05,429
four people with the Huntsman.

657
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:06,429
Did I kill anybody

658
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:09,429
with anything else besides melee?

659
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:15,579
Medic!

660
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:22,420
Why am I not streaming on Twitch?

661
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,659
Because...

662
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:26,659
I can't do 720 on Twitch.

663
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:28,969
And we're lagging again.

664
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:30,969
So I'm gonna disconnect from this server.

665
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:35,510
So I'm gonna go on a random server

666
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,329
so that nobody can see the IP,

667
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,329
because I think what the problem

668
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:40,329
is happening right now

669
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:42,329
is we keep on crashing servers out,

670
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:44,329
because too many people are getting the IP.

671
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:46,329
So let's just go to...

672
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:50,539
I'm gonna take it off screen.

673
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:52,539
I'm gonna take it off of this screen.

674
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:58,539
What's going on here?

675
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:04,619
Let's see.

676
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,349
Let's find a map I like.

677
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:11,349
We'll play in some gravel pit.

678
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:13,349
No, we won't. Yes, we will.

679
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:15,349
No, we won't. Yes, we will.

680
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:23,929
What is that hat with the Eiffel Tower?

681
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:25,929
We are all highly intrigued.

682
00:37:25,929 --> 00:37:27,929
And I looked, I can't find it in the store.

683
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:29,929
Oh, yeah, the...

684
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:31,929
Eiffel Tower hat from Kritzkast.

685
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:33,929
If you don't know Kritzkast,

686
00:37:33,929 --> 00:37:35,929
it's a Team Fortress 2 podcast they do every week.

687
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:37,929
And every week they give out Player of the Week.

688
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:39,929
And I guess it's like a thing they do

689
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:41,929
where they find somebody that's doing

690
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,929
a lot of cool stuff,

691
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,929
or they're doing well, or something with competitive.

692
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:47,929
I'm not really exactly sure.

693
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:49,929
But I do know they give it out pretty much

694
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:51,929
every week, I think, to somebody else.

695
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:53,929
And I happen to get Player of the Week,

696
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:55,929
which that's awesome, and thank you to the Kritzkast guys

697
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:57,929
if you're watching this or if you're seeing this at some point.

698
00:37:57,929 --> 00:37:59,929
Thank you for that, I much appreciate it,

699
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:01,929
that's awesome, thank you so much.

700
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:03,929
But that's where that hat came from, it's from the Kritzkast guys.

701
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:07,449
Alright, let's go to...

702
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:13,800
Gold Rush, this one, whatever it is.

703
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
Yeah, I want to get at least one

704
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
good non-laggy Team Fortress 2 game.

705
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,769
And it seems like every time we're...

706
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,769
I don't know, recently I don't know what's been going on.

707
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,769
Every time it's been...

708
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:27,769
The streams from a long time ago,

709
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:29,769
I've been doing streams for the last

710
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:31,769
four or five months. I've never seen

711
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:33,769
this problem before, and I used to give out IPs

712
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,769
like crazy. We would always just flood a server

713
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:38,199
and that stuff would never happen.

714
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,199
So I'm wondering, I'm wondering if something else is going on.

715
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:43,340
Who knows? But

716
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,340
I'm going to try and play a little bit of one more session

717
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,639
here with the...

718
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:50,780
Demoman.

719
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,489
I am appearing offline.

720
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:57,429
So I don't want to kill this person's

721
00:38:57,429 --> 00:39:01,719
server. Thank you, doctor.

722
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:08,630
I've got my strange lock and load.

723
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:11,960
Oh, I thought he was going to back up into that.

724
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,159
Whoa, just barely.

725
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:19,769
Just barely.

726
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:24,360
Oh, I didn't get him. Almost got him.

727
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,360
Oh my god, I just barely dodged that crit rocket.

728
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,710
There's a sentry right there.

729
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:33,849
Oh, and

730
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:39,159
goodbye, sentry.

731
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:41,590
Oh, I'm going to be in trouble.

732
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,590
I need that medic, there's still stuff over there.

733
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:49,670
What happened to that medic?

734
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,539
Oh god.

735
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:54,780
I hate when that happens.

736
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,739
Bumped right into him,

737
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:00,739
shot him right in the face, instantly blew up myself.

738
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:02,739
I do that far too often,

739
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:06,070
by the way.

740
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,070
I do that more often than not.

741
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:14,150
Alright, let's go. I want to kill

742
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,150
at least ten people in a row.

743
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,130
Doctor.

744
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,860
No!

745
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,099
I saved him.

746
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:34,230
Oh my god, more spies!

747
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,230
Oh, that's crit, someone's going to walk over that.

748
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,300
Someone's going to walk over that.

749
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,300
I don't feel bad for them.

750
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,480
Oh, this is not good.

751
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,550
I forgot I had this equipped.

752
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,550
It's fine, that's fine. Oh, great.

753
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,500
Come on, somebody walk over here.

754
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,300
Somebody touch that cart.

755
00:40:54,300 --> 00:41:00,760
There he is. Oh, I thought I was going to blow somebody up.

756
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,760
Let's see, let's see if I can't ambush

757
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,260
somebody. Come on,

758
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,260
you coming? Oh, okay, okay, we got a medic, we got a medic,

759
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,570
we got a medic. Coming out this way,

760
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,510
buddy, where you going?

761
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,510
I think I'm running into a spy.

762
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,139
Alright, alright, alright.

763
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:22,139
Stalk the prey, just like you would

764
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:24,500
in the jungle.

765
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
Random crit, random crit.

766
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Random crit! Yes!

767
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
Yes! Oh,

768
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
I can't believe it.

769
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,219
Oh, let's be a real jerk.

770
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:45,449
Oh, I'm being a real

771
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:47,449
bad person right now, I'm out of here.

772
00:41:47,449 --> 00:41:54,409
Oh, get that

773
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:56,409
spy! I keep pulling this

774
00:41:56,409 --> 00:42:01,019
stupid thing out. I'm going to be

775
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,019
playing Diablo 3 in like

776
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:05,019
15 minutes or so.

777
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:09,300
Here we go, same guy, same guy.

778
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,119
Round 2? Round 2.

779
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,900
Come on. Oh, round

780
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,900
2. Round 2.

781
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,539
I got him. Oh,

782
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,539
now I'm a lot sober.

783
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:29,559
That pyro has to be very, very upset

784
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:34,170
with me. You got to imagine

785
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,170
that that pyro is probably not happy right

786
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:44,019
now. Well,

787
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:53,179
I would be quite upset as well.

788
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:55,179
Oh, I'm hitting into the stupid thing.

789
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:58,309
One heavy down.

790
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:02,860
Come on, somebody get on that. Cut!

791
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:07,659
I need some health.

792
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:11,500
I need some health, man. Help me!

793
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
Please help me.

794
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:19,639
Thank you.

795
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:26,420
Oh, come on. I got it.

796
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:31,929
Spencer down. Come on,

797
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:34,869
walk out that front door.

798
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:36,869
Oh, come on. Walk right into a crit

799
00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:42,039
rocket. Crap. Damn it.

800
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:44,039
God dang.

801
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:48,650
That pyro is your friend?

802
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,579
Oh my god.

803
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:58,699
I'm going demo night. 7 and 3?

804
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:00,699
What'd I say? 1 of 10 kills?

805
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:03,059
Alright, I'll get it all right now. Here's 1.

806
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:08,889
No, that's no spy.

807
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:10,889
They're getting locked in the spawn, man. I feel bad

808
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:15,369
for these guys. Hey, spy.

809
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:17,369
I just ran into you. Don't know where you are, but it's okay.

810
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:20,889
Oh, there he is.

811
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:23,320
Prey number 1.

812
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:33,099
Yikes.

813
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:35,099
Oh, how did they know? How did they know?

814
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:38,739
Did you win that duel,

815
00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:40,739
Justin? I don't even remember.

816
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:43,940
You probably did.

817
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,269
Medic, medic, medic.

818
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:55,800
All you have now

819
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,800
is that crit's cast hat.

820
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,739
Uh, no, I have other

821
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,739
hats. I just recently got it, so I haven't put it...

822
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:04,739
Oh, this is it, by the way, if you want to see it.

823
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:06,980
Vintage lo-fi

824
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,059
longwave. I just have it on

825
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:12,059
all my classes right now, just

826
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:14,059
for fun, because I just got it recently.

827
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:16,230
And it can be equipped on anybody, so...

828
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,730
Oh,

829
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:20,730
no.

830
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,610
I totally did not time

831
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:26,489
that right. Totally didn't time that

832
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:30,710
right.

833
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:35,699
HalBlobberFatty, what's up, man?

834
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:40,119
I play Diablo 3 with

835
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:42,119
Star, Shibby, MLC Stealth, and

836
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:45,320
Burger Boy. Alright, let's start

837
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,320
the chain here. Let's start the chain here.

838
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,159
This guy's gonna kill me.

839
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:53,590
I have no health at all.

840
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:57,239
Come on, stay alive until I get charged!

841
00:45:57,239 --> 00:45:59,239
Yes.

842
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:01,239
Alright, let's do it.

843
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:05,380
Let's go for this.

844
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,380
Somebody, like, walk up here.

845
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,380
Oh, crap.

846
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,610
Suicide

847
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,780
for the win.

848
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,780
Alright, one more kill, and I'm gonna

849
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,780
probably move on to Diablo 3.

850
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,789
Let's all ask him

851
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:27,030
if he's a Brony.

852
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,849
I...

853
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:31,849
I...

854
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:34,789
I don't think so, no.

855
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:36,789
That's somebody that really likes watching that

856
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:38,789
show, right? That My Little Pony show.

857
00:46:38,789 --> 00:46:40,789
I've never watched one episode, I've never

858
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:43,860
seen one episode.

859
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,860
I don't really watch any TV. The only TV

860
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,860
I really watch is... I mean, I

861
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,860
watch a lot of YouTube, if you count that.

862
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,639
I can't believe I missed. Thank God

863
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:55,639
El Scorcho just sniped him, because that was

864
00:46:55,639 --> 00:47:00,889
awful.

865
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:07,590
Ah.

866
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,590
I'm sorry, did you just say suicide for the win?

867
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,590
Fake in-game

868
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,590
suicide for the win. We'll put it that way.

869
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,780
I got the kill, though. That's what I wanted.

870
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:26,139
Never seen one of my streams? Well, welcome.

871
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:29,079
Thanks for coming, man.

872
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,829
Oh, super trick!

873
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:33,829
Alright, let me see...

874
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:36,579
Is anybody even online?

875
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:38,579
Do I have to play some Diablo 3?

876
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:41,530
I'm not even in Skype.

877
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:45,820
Let's see if anyone's

878
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,909
online.

879
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:53,559
Burger Boy is online.

880
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:56,570
No sign of Brett with Shibby.

881
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,260
Shibby is online.

882
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,260
And Star is online, too.

883
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:05,219
Alright, we can make something happen here.

884
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:07,659
Oh, not a new game. Yeah!

885
00:48:07,659 --> 00:48:09,659
So, I have to get Diablo 3 in a window.

886
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:11,659
So, if you came here for the TF2,

887
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:13,659
thanks for coming.

888
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:15,659
Glad you stopped by.

889
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,150
And yeah, thank you.

890
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,150
If you want to stick around for Diablo 3, I'm going to be streaming Diablo 3 for

891
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,329
probably

892
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:24,329
quite a long time. And when I say quite a long time,

893
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:26,329
I mean at least an hour or two.

894
00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:28,739
So, yeah.

895
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,519
Let me get that rolling here.

896
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:38,659
First, let me write a heart.

897
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:42,659
The screen is going to go black

898
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:44,659
for a minute

899
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:47,219
or so here.

900
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,219
Whoa! Streamception.

901
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:51,659
The screen is going to go black. But I'm still here.

902
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:54,659
Don't worry.

903
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:57,800
I have not left. I'm still kicking.

904
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,900
So, what can I talk about while I do this?

905
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,519
Oh, Diablo 3.

906
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:08,619
Because I'm going to play Diablo 3 right now.

907
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:10,619
Loading up Diablo 3.

908
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:14,840
So, what I can talk about while this is

909
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,840
kind of a black screen right now is

910
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,840
yes, I'm still a barbarian.

911
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,840
I'm having fun with this new build, and I'll try and talk about it.

912
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,840
What I'm doing is

913
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,840
I've got to show it on the screen before

914
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,550
any of that

915
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,550
good stuff happens.

916
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,550
So, hold on a second, guys.

917
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,550
It's probably going to be a whole lot of

918
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:38,329
nonsense in the background.

919
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:42,329
Windowed.

920
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:46,420
80 by 720.

921
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,179
Why can't I make it to window?

922
00:49:49,179 --> 00:49:54,739
Well, that's weird.

923
00:49:54,739 --> 00:50:03,260
Why can't I change it to...

924
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:07,099
What's the deal? There we go.

925
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:09,099
All right. Windowed. There's the window.

926
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:11,400
I believe that's

927
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:18,630
correct.

928
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:27,260
There we go.

929
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,260
Okay. I'm coming back.

930
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:36,869
Coming back. Coming back.

931
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:43,639
Are we back?

932
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:46,650
No, that's not quite what I wanted.

933
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,650
Not quite. Hold on, guys. Sorry about this.

934
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:54,659
Not quite what I was

935
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:59,320
looking for, but it's okay.

936
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,320
All right. Okay. Now I've got to do this.

937
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,329
Hello.

938
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:08,090
Ah!

939
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:10,090
Inception. Inception.

940
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:16,420
Inception.

941
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:22,250
Hold on. I'm going to try one more thing here.

942
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,869
Just black bars on the side.

943
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:28,260
I don't want that.

944
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:34,730
I don't want that at all.

945
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:41,579
Now let's try this again.

946
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:43,579
Okay. I got it this time.

947
00:51:43,579 --> 00:51:51,579
I got it this time.

948
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:58,809
Add screen region. Screen region.

949
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:18,440
Hello.

950
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,340
And let's do it.

951
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:27,530
Okay. We're back.

952
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:30,599
I'm actually going to turn some of these down.

953
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:32,599
The purposes of...

954
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:36,250
The purposes of streaming.

955
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:43,800
And there we go.

956
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,800
Watch if you like servers are down.

957
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,900
So now I want to show you guys my...

958
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,900
This is my barbarian.

959
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:57,590
Look at him. He's like, cool.

960
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,590
Oh, Burger Boy is in the game right now.

961
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:04,260
I'll go play with Burger Boy.

962
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,260
He's in Act 1.

963
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,260
Oh, so I've got to say this is going to have...

964
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,760
Actually, this is not going to have any spoilers.

965
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,219
Let's go join him.

966
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:17,219
He's going to be so confused.

967
00:53:17,219 --> 00:53:28,420
He's going to be like, what are you doing in here?

968
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,420
I just said, sup, Burger. I'm streaming.

969
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:35,610
Where is he right now?

970
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,610
So this is what I wanted to show you my build.

971
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:42,539
This is the build I'm working on right now for the barbarian.

972
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,030
So I have right now...

973
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,030
See this thing right here?

974
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,030
Berserker Rage.

975
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:53,030
You inflict an additional 25% damage while at maximum fury.

976
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,030
So what I'm trying to do is

977
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:57,030
I'm trying to use as many moves as I can

978
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:59,030
that are not

979
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:01,030
consumers of fury.

980
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,030
Because obviously these ones are not.

981
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:05,030
As a barbarian, if you don't know,

982
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,030
you have moves that build fury.

983
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:09,030
And you have moves that

984
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,030
use it, remove it.

985
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:13,030
So what I'm trying to do is

986
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,030
I'm trying to do this kind of build where

987
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:17,030
I'm always at maximum fury, at least for the most part.

988
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,030
So I get 25% damage from that

989
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,030
just by having the fury

990
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:23,030
as high as it can go.

991
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,030
And then this,

992
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:27,030
Enter a Rage, which increases damage done by 15%

993
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,030
and critical hit chance by 3%

994
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:31,030
for 30 seconds. So it's a buff, right?

995
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,030
And of course I have this rune

996
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,210
where it makes it so

997
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,210
it increases that damage bonus to 30%.

998
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,380
So, if you can do the math,

999
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,380
what I'm trying to do is have this be at 30%

1000
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,380
and have this be full all the time

1001
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,380
so it's at 25%.

1002
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,380
So you're talking

1003
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,380
55% more damage if I have

1004
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,380
full fury. And I'm trying to stay there

1005
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:56,570
as much as I can.

1006
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:58,570
So let's go

1007
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:02,019
find Burger Boy. Burger Boy!

1008
00:55:02,019 --> 00:55:04,329
Actually I want to turn up

1009
00:55:04,329 --> 00:55:06,949
I'll just join off him.

1010
00:55:06,949 --> 00:55:09,320
I'm not sure where he is right now.

1011
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,739
I think he's in the Old Ruins.

1012
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:15,980
Barbarian, someone's asking?

1013
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,980
Oh god, lag.

1014
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,980
Why Barbarian? Because Barbarian,

1015
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,980
I don't know, I remember the Barbarian from

1016
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,150
Diablo 2.

1017
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:27,030
Let me turn the sound down a little bit.

1018
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,030
The Barbarian in Diablo 2 is just a classic.

1019
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,030
And I'm a huge fan of the classic

1020
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,230
Diablo. So of course

1021
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,230
I'm going to try and pick it and play.

1022
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,980
This is on Nightmare by the way.

1023
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,980
We have already completed this game at least once.

1024
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,980
And it's probably going to lag for the first

1025
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,980
few seconds or minutes

1026
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,980
or so of the game.

1027
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,980
Only because

1028
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,980
it does that for some reason. I don't know why.

1029
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,980
Diablo 3 is very, very buggy right now.

1030
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:57,590
What quest are you on

1031
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:01,239
right now?

1032
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:03,239
I'm going to show you what I'm talking about though.

1033
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:05,239
So I have Frenzy, right?

1034
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:07,239
Frenzy speeds up the more I hit people.

1035
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,239
Like speeds up my attack speed.

1036
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:11,239
So what I'm trying to do is just be like an absolute

1037
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:13,239
psycho and swing like 100 miles per hour.

1038
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:15,239
See if I can't show what I'm talking about here.

1039
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:17,239
So see, the more I hit people

1040
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:19,239
the faster I'm going to swing.

1041
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:21,239
And those yellow letters, those are crits.

1042
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:26,679
Yeah, let me get Burger Boy in the Skype call.

1043
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:29,500
Burger Boy, I'm going to

1044
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,019
call you. Where are you, Burger?

1045
00:56:33,019 --> 00:56:37,050
Actually Burger Boy,

1046
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,050
can you call me?

1047
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,050
Just call me Burger Boy.

1048
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:43,050
Because I'm a bit used to much of my bandwidth.

1049
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:48,550
Oh, he just started Act 1

1050
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,550
Nightmare. So for those of you

1051
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,550
watching, this is the very beginning of Act 1.

1052
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:54,550
And it's on Nightmare difficulty.

1053
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:59,030
You just started Burger Boy.

1054
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:04,980
Where are you, Burger?

1055
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:10,420
That's where I am.

1056
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:14,460
I'm trying to remember what quest he's even on.

1057
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,949
Oh, Burger Boy has to come in here.

1058
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:18,949
Because he has the quest person.

1059
00:57:18,949 --> 00:57:21,960
So you want to see my stuff?

1060
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,960
Before we get going here?

1061
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,960
Before Burger Boy gives me a ring-a-ding-ding.

1062
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:33,579
Burger. Look at that face,

1063
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:35,579
by the way. Look at like Burger Boy's

1064
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:39,289
face. Someone's asking

1065
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,289
what is Diablo 3 about?

1066
00:57:41,289 --> 00:57:43,289
It's kind of a difficult thing to explain,

1067
00:57:43,289 --> 00:57:45,289
but pretty much it's an action RPG

1068
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:47,289
where you run around and you kill

1069
00:57:47,289 --> 00:57:49,289
literally hundreds and hundreds

1070
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:51,289
of monsters at the same time.

1071
00:57:51,289 --> 00:57:53,289
And hold on, Burger Boy is actually calling.

1072
00:57:53,289 --> 00:57:56,619
What's up, Burger?

1073
00:57:56,619 --> 00:58:01,219
Oh, hold on, I gotta change something.

1074
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:03,219
You know you guys can't hear, am I gonna make it so he's coming through the right

1075
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:06,170
line? Line 1.

1076
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:10,889
There we go. Burger Boy, close

1077
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:12,889
your windows.

1078
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,889
Oh yeah. Sorry. Hold on.

1079
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:17,510
Burger Boy like lives like on a

1080
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:19,510
highway.

1081
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:25,590
Alright, let's do this

1082
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:28,019
thing, man. Bring a

1083
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:30,019
Leia. Oh, she's actually right here.

1084
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:32,650
You want me to grab

1085
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,650
my 42 and you want to continue

1086
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,650
where we left off?

1087
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,650
No, it's alright. It doesn't matter. We gotta catch up

1088
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,650
a little bit anyways, cause Shibby and

1089
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,650
all them, Breton, they're all

1090
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,980
a little higher. It's a beautiful

1091
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,980
face, somebody said, about your face.

1092
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:51,480
Oh, sweet.

1093
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,480
But somebody was asking what this game's about.

1094
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,480
Pretty much loot. It's about picking up

1095
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,480
stuff. It's about

1096
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,480
collecting gear.

1097
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,480
And I'll show you my character. This is my

1098
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,360
character's stuff. It's about

1099
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,360
collecting gems and rares and uniques

1100
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,360
and there's literally thousands and thousands

1101
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,360
and thousands of different items in the game.

1102
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,789
And right now we're in the middle of

1103
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:14,789
the Act 1 quest where we're supposed to be killing,

1104
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:16,789
I think we're supposed to be finding somebody actually.

1105
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:18,789
So let's start whooping butt.

1106
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:24,300
So Burger Boy, I'm a barbarian.

1107
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,300
Burger Boy is a monk.

1108
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,300
Oh god, freeze.

1109
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:32,579
Yeah, killing stuff. That's pretty much what

1110
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:34,579
it is, killing stuff. Killing

1111
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:36,579
bosses, trying to get better gear, trying to have...

1112
00:59:36,579 --> 00:59:38,579
For you TF2 guys, I'll

1113
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:40,579
explain it like this. So you

1114
00:59:40,579 --> 00:59:42,579
have unusual hats in

1115
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,340
Team Fortress, right? So unusual

1116
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,699
hats, pretty much think of it,

1117
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:49,699
every time we kill a boss in this game,

1118
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:51,699
or any time you kill a major enemy or

1119
00:59:51,699 --> 00:59:53,699
a very rare enemy, it's like opening

1120
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:57,159
a crate. It's like opening

1121
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:59,159
a Team Fortress crate. And there's

1122
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:01,159
items that are really, really incredible

1123
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:03,159
they're called Legendary.

1124
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:05,159
And the chance of getting one of those is like

1125
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:07,159
probably 1-2% per

1126
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:09,159
major enemy you kill.

1127
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,159
So it's a very

1128
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:13,159
big like treasure box game where you want to get

1129
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:15,159
like as many cool pieces of gear, you want to get all the awesome stuff.

1130
01:00:15,159 --> 01:00:17,159
That's the best way

1131
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:19,159
to describe this game. It's all about making your character

1132
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:23,579
better. And I'm level

1133
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,820
32. I'm 42.

1134
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,820
I should probably not even be here with you. I'm probably not going to get

1135
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,820
rid of that much experience. Yeah, I'll roll on my 42.

1136
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:31,820
That's fine, staying game. Okay.

1137
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:36,550
It's just very addicting.

1138
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:40,389
Everything about it is addicting.

1139
01:00:40,389 --> 01:00:42,389
There's an auction house. You can sell stuff. You can...

1140
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,389
There's a whole trading atmosphere to it.

1141
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:49,960
It's very, very interesting.

1142
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,960
But I've been waiting for this game for over 10 years.

1143
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,139
Just about 10 years.

1144
01:00:54,139 --> 01:00:56,139
2,000...1999?

1145
01:00:56,139 --> 01:00:59,590
Yeah, exactly, Shaxx. Exactly.

1146
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,590
It is unboxing a boss.

1147
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,590
And even just

1148
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:05,590
regular enemies too. If you notice when I kill some of

1149
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,590
these guys, they'll just drop stuff.

1150
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:09,590
They randomly will drop stuff on the ground.

1151
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:14,780
And there's a big storyline to it.

1152
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,780
There's a whole lot of cool stuff to read about.

1153
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,019
Just interesting.

1154
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:27,260
Excuse me.

1155
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,260
Oh, the Puke spell. Puke spell.

1156
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:38,139
I'll give you guys this buff.

1157
01:01:38,139 --> 01:01:42,300
That's still recharging.

1158
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,300
But if you are a fan of action RPGs,

1159
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,300
this is pretty much the series that started

1160
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,659
it all. Diablo 1.

1161
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:53,269
I'm not going to

1162
01:01:53,269 --> 01:01:55,269
give up my battle tag.

1163
01:01:55,269 --> 01:01:57,269
For the main purposes of...

1164
01:01:57,269 --> 01:01:59,269
It's very easy just to join off of

1165
01:01:59,269 --> 01:02:01,269
anybody's game. So I'm going to

1166
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:03,269
keep that probably private for now.

1167
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:06,789
Because as you know, if

1168
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:09,420
anybody joins your game,

1169
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,420
the game just gets harder.

1170
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,420
I gotta get a water. Hold on.

1171
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:17,820
I'm starting to get froggy.

1172
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,820
But if anybody joins your game,

1173
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:22,500
the game just gets harder. Everything just

1174
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,829
gets harder. Oh, this is where it gets nuts.

1175
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:28,780
Going to Super Saiyan mode.

1176
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:32,550
See, I can turn into this

1177
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:36,070
giant barbarian. Smash.

1178
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:38,889
Get smashed.

1179
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:43,349
Enemy drop.

1180
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:45,849
And you get bonus experience.

1181
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:47,849
You get bonus experience

1182
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:49,849
for killing a certain amount

1183
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,849
of enemies in a row. It's very, very addicting.

1184
01:02:51,849 --> 01:02:56,969
Everything about this game is addicting.

1185
01:02:56,969 --> 01:02:59,139
I'm going to go this way. Just split up so we can

1186
01:02:59,139 --> 01:03:06,949
fight it easier, I guess.

1187
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,469
I got 144

1188
01:03:10,469 --> 01:03:12,469
killstreak earlier. It was

1189
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:14,469
insane. Oh my god.

1190
01:03:14,469 --> 01:03:17,219
144?

1191
01:03:17,219 --> 01:03:19,219
Yeah, the monk's nasty.

1192
01:03:19,219 --> 01:03:21,219
Oh, I gotta turn you up a little bit.

1193
01:03:21,219 --> 01:03:27,239
There you go. People are probably having trouble

1194
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:30,119
hearing you now. They can hear you probably.

1195
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:32,119
Can you guys hear Burger Boy okay? Or should I lower him?

1196
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:36,920
Drop him? Oh, here we go.

1197
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,920
This is what I'm talking about. This is a room. This is like a

1198
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,920
room full of enemies I want to fight. Bang.

1199
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,920
I'm at the

1200
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,099
point where we need to be.

1201
01:03:45,099 --> 01:03:47,099
Just... I'll TP off you in a second.

1202
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:50,940
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

1203
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,940
This will all be

1204
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,940
uploaded to YouTube.

1205
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,579
Tomorrow, probably afternoon.

1206
01:03:58,579 --> 01:04:00,579
Yeah, you can just take it. I'll just accept off you.

1207
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:02,579
So, just skip everything.

1208
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:04,579
Because I don't want to, you know, the story.

1209
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:06,579
People might not want to see it. Yep.

1210
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:12,070
And skip!

1211
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:14,070
Get him, minions.

1212
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:19,639
Deckard Cain.

1213
01:04:19,639 --> 01:04:23,349
It's Deckard Cain. This is on Nightmare, right?

1214
01:04:23,349 --> 01:04:25,349
Yep. Yep.

1215
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:27,659
I think it is. Yeah, it is.

1216
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:29,659
We got a big boy right here. What's he going to drop?

1217
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:33,940
Legendary. He just keeps

1218
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:36,309
dropping, like, vintage items.

1219
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:41,429
Skip, skip, skip, skip.

1220
01:04:41,429 --> 01:04:43,429
How much is the game? The game is

1221
01:04:43,429 --> 01:04:46,119
60 bucks. It is

1222
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:48,119
60 dollars. It's a brand new AAA release.

1223
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:51,190
Kind of expensive, but

1224
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:53,190
for the amount of time that we've been

1225
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,329
playing this for...

1226
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:58,329
Skip. Yeah, skip it.

1227
01:04:58,329 --> 01:05:00,329
For the amount of time we've been playing this for, like, I'll just show you.

1228
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:08,969
I think I can show you.

1229
01:05:08,969 --> 01:05:10,969
I guess I can't. But I've been playing this game

1230
01:05:10,969 --> 01:05:12,969
on this character for probably 25, 30 hours already.

1231
01:05:12,969 --> 01:05:18,409
I'm almost level 43, too.

1232
01:05:18,409 --> 01:05:21,739
This is good stuff.

1233
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:27,369
Alright, get the next quest.

1234
01:05:27,369 --> 01:05:29,369
Yeah, Burgerboy, he just changed classes.

1235
01:05:29,369 --> 01:05:31,369
He's a witch doctor now. He was on

1236
01:05:31,369 --> 01:05:33,369
his monk, but now he's playing as the witch doctor.

1237
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:36,500
Let me sell some of this stuff.

1238
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,380
And as you can see, he's

1239
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,380
like 37.7 DPS, and the thing I have

1240
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,380
on is 75.6.

1241
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:45,380
And you can look at the stats, too, and you kind of go

1242
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,380
stat crazy, and you get all nuts.

1243
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,820
It's a lot of fun.

1244
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,309
I don't need any of this stuff, really, though.

1245
01:05:52,309 --> 01:05:55,769
And I want money.

1246
01:05:55,769 --> 01:05:58,969
So I'm just going to sell it.

1247
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:03,260
I want dat money.

1248
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,260
Oh, no, it is not monthly. It is not

1249
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:07,619
monthly. You just buy it once,

1250
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:09,619
and you have it forever. You don't have to ever pay anything ever again.

1251
01:06:09,619 --> 01:06:11,619
Yeah, that's the best part about this game.

1252
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:13,619
It was monthly, man.

1253
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:15,619
I hate that,

1254
01:06:15,619 --> 01:06:17,619
monthly stuff.

1255
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:19,619
No, I wouldn't do it if it was monthly.

1256
01:06:19,619 --> 01:06:21,619
Maybe for like a month or so, maybe, I don't know.

1257
01:06:21,619 --> 01:06:23,619
It would be tough, because the game is really fun.

1258
01:06:23,619 --> 01:06:28,300
Oktoberfest!

1259
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:33,860
But it can get really crazy.

1260
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,860
When you get a group of four people,

1261
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,860
because the maximum amount of people you can have in a

1262
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,860
lobby is four,

1263
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,860
you get four people in this game, and it gets pretty

1264
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:45,579
ridiculous.

1265
01:06:45,579 --> 01:06:47,579
Do we have to kill this lady, or no?

1266
01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:51,420
Yeah, we gotta kill this lady.

1267
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,849
Get her. Super Saiyan mode.

1268
01:06:53,849 --> 01:06:55,849
Oh, she went down.

1269
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:59,420
I'll just grow up all over.

1270
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:04,469
Nothing good.

1271
01:07:04,469 --> 01:07:12,519
Nothing good.

1272
01:07:12,519 --> 01:07:14,889
The major points of the quest is to

1273
01:07:14,889 --> 01:07:16,889
make the story keep going,

1274
01:07:16,889 --> 01:07:18,889
progress the story, get some more gold, get some more loot.

1275
01:07:18,889 --> 01:07:21,130
But the real

1276
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:24,139
treasure chest is the bosses.

1277
01:07:24,139 --> 01:07:26,139
There's like

1278
01:07:26,139 --> 01:07:28,139
15 major bosses in this game, maybe a little bit more.

1279
01:07:28,139 --> 01:07:33,960
That's like the real joy

1280
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,960
of this game.

1281
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,960
It's killing a boss and crossing your fingers that you're going to get a legendary.

1282
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,960
Or like a good rare or something.

1283
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:46,869
Somebody wrote,

1284
01:07:46,869 --> 01:07:48,869
doesn't Burger Boy only buy games

1285
01:07:48,869 --> 01:07:50,869
when they're $10

1286
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:52,869
when they're $10?

1287
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:54,869
Wow, that says a lot about this game.

1288
01:07:54,869 --> 01:07:58,010
Yeah, that is true.

1289
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:04,980
Watch out, we got some dudes over here.

1290
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:20,789
Oh, we got a lot of people over here.

1291
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:22,789
Oh, God.

1292
01:08:22,789 --> 01:08:25,930
Let's just smash them.

1293
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,939
Smash them.

1294
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:30,939
I love that move so much. Cleave is so much fun.

1295
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:32,939
You can just swipe at everybody

1296
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:34,939
and just crush them.

1297
01:08:34,939 --> 01:08:39,159
Yep, bosses are treasure boxes.

1298
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:41,159
When you kill a boss,

1299
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,159
a ton of stuff just jumps out

1300
01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:45,159
into the screen.

1301
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:47,159
And you see what you want to pick up,

1302
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:49,159
what you don't want to pick up, what you want to trade to people,

1303
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:54,859
what you want to sell.

1304
01:08:54,859 --> 01:08:56,859
We'll be at one of those bosses

1305
01:08:56,859 --> 01:08:58,859
probably in the next 25 minutes or so.

1306
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:01,420
The Skeleton King.

1307
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:17,340
This way.

1308
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:27,939
Burger Boy. Get out of town.

1309
01:09:27,939 --> 01:09:34,470
Pick up all the money is important.

1310
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,470
Waypoint.

1311
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:45,289
You found the waypoint, nice.

1312
01:09:45,289 --> 01:09:51,819
Is there a way?

1313
01:09:51,819 --> 01:09:53,819
Just trying to see when people were online last.

1314
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:57,590
Always check the...

1315
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,590
Oh, I thought, oh my God.

1316
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:01,829
I almost just lost my mind.

1317
01:10:01,829 --> 01:10:03,829
I thought my brain just collapsed right there.

1318
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:05,829
I thought that was a set item or something.

1319
01:10:05,829 --> 01:10:08,010
You want to go down one of those doors

1320
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:10,010
and I'll go down another

1321
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:12,010
since we're a little ahead on the level here?

1322
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:16,420
Yep. Sounds like a plan.

1323
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:25,380
Get that speed.

1324
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:31,079
Jerma, are you grandpa?

1325
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:33,079
That mystery will never be solved.

1326
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:38,140
I can neither confirm nor deny

1327
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,140
that statement.

1328
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:45,189
I'll check this one.

1329
01:10:45,189 --> 01:10:47,609
If you need help, just call it out.

1330
01:10:47,609 --> 01:10:49,609
Yeah, I'll be good. I got my minions.

1331
01:10:49,609 --> 01:10:51,609
That's right, you are.

1332
01:10:51,609 --> 01:10:53,609
You are a witch doctor.

1333
01:10:53,609 --> 01:11:00,010
I do forget that sometimes.

1334
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:02,010
Technically Diablo 3 is not an MMO,

1335
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:04,010
but I guess you could classify it as one.

1336
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,010
With the trading and the items

1337
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:08,010
and the multiplayer.

1338
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:11,020
But it is at the heart

1339
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,020
of a single player game.

1340
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,020
For the most part.

1341
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,279
Oh, a treasure bandit.

1342
01:11:18,279 --> 01:11:20,279
Oh man, I wish you were down here right now.

1343
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:24,180
It's alright, I'll try and kill him.

1344
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,180
Oh, die you little bastard.

1345
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:28,180
Yes, nice.

1346
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:31,319
I got to check that out.

1347
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:33,319
So what I just did right there, guys,

1348
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:35,319
is there was a little dude and he carries around

1349
01:11:35,319 --> 01:11:38,199
like a knapsack.

1350
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:40,199
Burger Boy immediately

1351
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:42,199
came to where the Treasure Goblin was.

1352
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:45,399
And if you kill that guy, he drops

1353
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:47,399
a lot of stuff, as you can see. Look at the ground.

1354
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:50,020
It's covered with things.

1355
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,020
See, these are rare.

1356
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,840
This is like the uncreating thing I was talking about, guys.

1357
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,840
It's not a legendary, but it's still a rare.

1358
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:07,220
Let's see what it is like.

1359
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:10,039
The thing I have is better.

1360
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:12,039
Vitality, 3 health per second.

1361
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:14,729
I can sell that, though.

1362
01:12:14,729 --> 01:12:18,310
I can sell it.

1363
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:26,359
I'll grab some more of this stuff.

1364
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:29,369
Yeah, I think there will be DLC.

1365
01:12:29,369 --> 01:12:31,369
Oh, got an event down here.

1366
01:12:31,369 --> 01:12:33,369
They already confirmed that there was going to be

1367
01:12:33,369 --> 01:12:35,369
at least one expansion.

1368
01:12:35,369 --> 01:12:37,369
Oh boy, there's a couple lords.

1369
01:12:37,369 --> 01:12:39,369
Lords and ladies.

1370
01:12:39,369 --> 01:12:42,250
Yeah, these guys got nothing.

1371
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,939
We're a little bit high level for this.

1372
01:12:44,939 --> 01:12:46,939
But, I mean, it's good just to

1373
01:12:46,939 --> 01:12:56,090
clean through everything.

1374
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:58,090
If you wanted to bring your witch, I mean, your monk in here,

1375
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:00,090
when we get to the boss, you could.

1376
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:02,090
Just, like, speed level him.

1377
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:05,159
Hmm.

1378
01:13:05,159 --> 01:13:07,979
Good idea.

1379
01:13:07,979 --> 01:13:10,340
I'm pretty sure that's how it works.

1380
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:12,649
Yeah, we'll try it.

1381
01:13:12,649 --> 01:13:14,649
What do you mean, when we get to the skeleton king?

1382
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:16,649
Yeah, yeah.

1383
01:13:16,649 --> 01:13:18,649
What do you think, like, you don't have to complete

1384
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:21,020
the quest before?

1385
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:23,020
I don't think so.

1386
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:25,020
I could be wrong, but I don't think so.

1387
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,020
Level 43.

1388
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:30,260
Ow.

1389
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:32,260
A new rune.

1390
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:35,020
Gotta check that.

1391
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:40,899
These guys, these little bastards are running around like crazy.

1392
01:13:40,899 --> 01:13:42,899
I'm a melee class, I can't keep up.

1393
01:13:42,899 --> 01:13:47,319
Oh, damn.

1394
01:13:47,319 --> 01:13:50,460
Kill this guy.

1395
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,460
Speed hack, speed hack.

1396
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:54,460
I don't even need to use my cooldown.

1397
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,590
Anything?

1398
01:13:57,590 --> 01:14:02,899
No.

1399
01:14:02,899 --> 01:14:04,899
Oh, that is good to know.

1400
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:06,899
Good to know. Thanks for whoever said that.

1401
01:14:06,899 --> 01:14:10,300
Let me see what his name was.

1402
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,470
Thank you for that.

1403
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:14,470
This guy just said, if you hold down control while you hover over an item,

1404
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:16,470
you can see the stats on it.

1405
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:19,100
Oh, wow. That's awesome.

1406
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,100
I didn't even realize that.

1407
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:24,619
What an idiot both of us are.

1408
01:14:24,619 --> 01:14:26,619
Oh, man.

1409
01:14:26,619 --> 01:14:28,619
Rare shoulder plates.

1410
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:31,689
Let's identify these babies.

1411
01:14:31,689 --> 01:14:34,699
Oh, a shibby's gonna want these.

1412
01:14:34,699 --> 01:14:36,699
74 intelligence.

1413
01:14:36,699 --> 01:14:38,699
82 vitality.

1414
01:14:38,699 --> 01:14:42,859
I'll hold on to those for the shibster.

1415
01:14:42,859 --> 01:14:44,859
Alright, so it wasn't in here.

1416
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:50,920
Yeah, it wasn't that one.

1417
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,420
It might be the one you were at.

1418
01:14:53,420 --> 01:15:00,260
Let me check this one.

1419
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:08,329
What's my favorite type of cheese?

1420
01:15:08,329 --> 01:15:10,329
Swiss cheese.

1421
01:15:10,329 --> 01:15:13,720
If you want, we can try and do...

1422
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,720
If you want to go to Act 2 and try and farm the boss, maybe.

1423
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,899
Yeah, let's do it.

1424
01:15:17,899 --> 01:15:19,899
If you want to do that after we...

1425
01:15:19,899 --> 01:15:21,899
I want to go through a more little dungeon first.

1426
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:24,520
Yeah, because I don't even have to complete this.

1427
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,520
I already did this on this character.

1428
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,979
See, the cool part about this game, guys,

1429
01:15:29,979 --> 01:15:31,979
is you can literally

1430
01:15:31,979 --> 01:15:34,729
just keep opening crates.

1431
01:15:34,729 --> 01:15:36,729
You just keep killing the same boss over and over again

1432
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:38,729
to try and get cool stuff.

1433
01:15:38,729 --> 01:15:41,739
Yeah, we'll do that.

1434
01:15:41,739 --> 01:15:43,739
Let's do that. I'll make the game.

1435
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:51,930
Alright, is that a new perk?

1436
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:56,020
TF2 was before this.

1437
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:58,020
If you missed it, it's gonna be uploaded tomorrow to YouTube.

1438
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:02,699
Okay, change quest.

1439
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:05,960
Act 2.

1440
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,899
We'll do...

1441
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:10,899
The Lord of Lies Belial.

1442
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:16,539
Act 2.

1443
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:18,539
You can join off me when you're ready.

1444
01:16:18,539 --> 01:16:22,500
What we just were playing right there

1445
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,500
was kind of the beginning of Act 1

1446
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,500
because Burger Boy was on it with another character

1447
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,500
and I was just coming to help him out.

1448
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,500
But now that he's on his actual character

1449
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,500
and I'm on my main character too,

1450
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,500
we're gonna do the boss of Act 2 again.

1451
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,500
Just because he's

1452
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,500
a very major boss,

1453
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:43,939
cool to farm,

1454
01:16:43,939 --> 01:16:50,600
maybe get some good stuff.

1455
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,600
No, getting good items does not cost $2.50.

1456
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,500
It costs nothing.

1457
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,739
Unless, of course,

1458
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,739
the real money auction house is coming out at some point.

1459
01:17:00,739 --> 01:17:02,739
We don't know when in the next few days.

1460
01:17:02,739 --> 01:17:06,390
Okay, this is what I'm talking about.

1461
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:08,819
This is gonna get difficult.

1462
01:17:08,819 --> 01:17:13,619
So all about being prepared.

1463
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:17,460
With that cleave.

1464
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:21,939
Let's get this sped up. Frenzy mode.

1465
01:17:21,939 --> 01:17:24,630
I love frenzy.

1466
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:31,159
Stop them!

1467
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:36,149
Oh, I'm taking some hits now.

1468
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:38,520
That's what I'm talking about.

1469
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,520
I want to take that pain, take that suffering.

1470
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:46,470
No, don't stand on the poison.

1471
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:55,420
Yeah! Nice.

1472
01:17:55,420 --> 01:18:01,750
Do I think the real money auction house is a good idea?

1473
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:06,819
Tough to say.

1474
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:09,829
Well, I gotta go activate this.

1475
01:18:09,829 --> 01:18:12,579
Tough to say, because

1476
01:18:12,579 --> 01:18:14,579
it's one of those things where

1477
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:16,579
Diablo is supposed to be all about finding the loot.

1478
01:18:16,579 --> 01:18:18,579
And, oh, you found this, you found that.

1479
01:18:18,579 --> 01:18:20,579
But with the auction house,

1480
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:22,579
it kind of makes it

1481
01:18:22,579 --> 01:18:24,579
oh, let me just go buy

1482
01:18:24,579 --> 01:18:26,579
whatever I want from the auction house.

1483
01:18:26,579 --> 01:18:28,579
I don't have to find anything.

1484
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,579
And to me, that kind of takes away from the game a little bit.

1485
01:18:30,579 --> 01:18:32,579
But most people probably aren't going to

1486
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:34,579
really use it that often.

1487
01:18:34,579 --> 01:18:36,760
I'm not sure.

1488
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,760
But yeah, that's my opinion. I think that a real money

1489
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,760
auction house makes it so you can just buy whatever you want.

1490
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,760
And have the best gear in the game

1491
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,760
and you really maybe didn't even play.

1492
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,760
You didn't even like try and get it.

1493
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,760
I'm an old school Diablo guy.

1494
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,760
I was all about farming the same boss over and over and over

1495
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,760
and over again until you got that one item you wanted.

1496
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:55,060
But it's cool.

1497
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:57,060
It's something new. Something interesting

1498
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,060
that they added.

1499
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:01,060
That kid's going to like

1500
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:03,060
get way better gear than you.

1501
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,060
It's going to piss you off, isn't it?

1502
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:07,060
No, I don't care.

1503
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:09,060
Just me personally,

1504
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:11,060
I probably won't use the real money auction house.

1505
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:13,060
At least right off the bat.

1506
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:17,220
Oh god, don't stand in that.

1507
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:24,500
Get over here.

1508
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,500
Don't stand in that lighting.

1509
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:30,859
It'll be your demise.

1510
01:19:30,859 --> 01:19:32,859
Besides the barbarian, the wizard.

1511
01:19:32,859 --> 01:19:34,859
I have a level 17 wizard I haven't really been playing with lately.

1512
01:19:34,859 --> 01:19:37,159
But probably the wizard.

1513
01:19:37,159 --> 01:19:41,060
I gotta run away from that.

1514
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:45,350
See the problem with this build?

1515
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:47,350
Oh boy, we got, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

1516
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:50,300
We got a couple of

1517
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:52,470
elite creatures over here.

1518
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:55,350
Oh, they're all doing that

1519
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:57,350
lightning thing.

1520
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,869
I can't even stand near them.

1521
01:20:00,869 --> 01:20:05,420
Oh god, I gotta try and single them out.

1522
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:09,449
I keep doing that mirror thing too.

1523
01:20:09,449 --> 01:20:14,060
That's annoying.

1524
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,359
Get out of here.

1525
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:18,859
Alright, I'm going Super Saiyan.

1526
01:20:18,859 --> 01:20:21,350
You got nothing on me.

1527
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:24,420
Super Saiyan mode.

1528
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,689
Any good drops?

1529
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:29,689
Sick. What'd you get?

1530
01:20:29,689 --> 01:20:32,500
Oh, nothing. That was just a

1531
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:36,279
destructive...

1532
01:20:36,279 --> 01:20:38,279
If you buy too much stuff, won't it defeat the purpose of

1533
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:40,279
Diablo?

1534
01:20:40,279 --> 01:20:42,279
Yeah, that's my opinion.

1535
01:20:42,279 --> 01:20:44,279
A lot of people share the same opinion.

1536
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:46,279
But there's also a lot of people that say,

1537
01:20:46,279 --> 01:20:48,279
and it's very warranted,

1538
01:20:48,279 --> 01:20:50,279
they say, I don't have time to grind

1539
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:52,279
the same boss over and over and over and over again.

1540
01:20:52,279 --> 01:20:54,279
Oh by the way, we're about to

1541
01:20:54,279 --> 01:20:56,279
you're about to see a boss, a major boss,

1542
01:20:56,279 --> 01:20:58,279
so if you don't want to see it, then you don't want to see it.

1543
01:20:58,279 --> 01:21:00,279
So I recommend clicking

1544
01:21:00,279 --> 01:21:02,279
away from the screen for a second,

1545
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:04,279
because you're about to see a major Act boss.

1546
01:21:04,279 --> 01:21:08,630
Oh, we're skipping the scene anyways, right?

1547
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,630
Yeah, we're skipping it, but still, it doesn't really matter.

1548
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:16,520
Spoiler alert!

1549
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:23,539
But this

1550
01:21:23,539 --> 01:21:25,539
guy is probably going to be incredibly

1551
01:21:25,539 --> 01:21:27,539
difficult with just me and you.

1552
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:32,149
This is Act 2.

1553
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:34,149
What was your question, Brunden? Sorry, I'll answer it.

1554
01:21:34,149 --> 01:21:36,149
Ask it again. I apologize.

1555
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:38,970
I'm trying to pay attention to

1556
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:40,970
five different things at once here, so sorry.

1557
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:46,979
Got to get rid of his snake ads.

1558
01:21:46,979 --> 01:21:50,500
Yeah, we're

1559
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,500
definitely going to wipe. There's no way we're going to do this.

1560
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,739
Maybe we will.

1561
01:21:54,739 --> 01:21:56,739
This guy's quite difficult.

1562
01:21:56,739 --> 01:22:02,380
Actually, we can show

1563
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,380
this. Oh, no, we don't.

1564
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:06,739
It doesn't matter.

1565
01:22:06,739 --> 01:22:09,180
Get him!

1566
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:13,140
Sick of minion!

1567
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,960
I only have one potion,

1568
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,960
dude. This is going to be really bad.

1569
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,899
This is going to be really, really bad.

1570
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:23,850
Getting annihilated already.

1571
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:25,850
We are going to get

1572
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:27,850
so owned, it's not even funny.

1573
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:30,859
Oh, he's almost like

1574
01:22:30,859 --> 01:22:32,859
Half-Life. Not bad.

1575
01:22:32,859 --> 01:22:35,989
Are you forgetting the most important

1576
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:41,109
thing? I don't.

1577
01:22:41,109 --> 01:22:45,399
Crush him. I'm saving my Super Saiyan

1578
01:22:45,399 --> 01:22:47,399
for when we really need it, because we're really

1579
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:49,579
going to need it.

1580
01:22:49,579 --> 01:22:51,579
He's just about to give up.

1581
01:22:51,579 --> 01:22:53,579
Kill that ad. We don't want this guy here.

1582
01:22:53,579 --> 01:22:56,010
We want this guy gone.

1583
01:22:56,010 --> 01:23:05,590
Let's see...

1584
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:07,590
Am I going to Dreamhack?

1585
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:09,590
Uh, it's

1586
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:11,590
probably not. It's across the world, and I don't really have

1587
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:13,590
the funds, I guess,

1588
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:15,590
to travel across the world.

1589
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:18,409
Okay, this is where it gets nuts.

1590
01:23:18,409 --> 01:23:20,649
Oh, god. Oh, god. I'm literally

1591
01:23:20,649 --> 01:23:22,649
scared. We're going to wipe right in the first two seconds.

1592
01:23:22,649 --> 01:23:24,649
We're going to wipe in the first two seconds.

1593
01:23:24,649 --> 01:23:26,649
Probably.

1594
01:23:26,649 --> 01:23:30,550
Oh, god.

1595
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:32,789
I have like half health.

1596
01:23:32,789 --> 01:23:34,789
We're dead.

1597
01:23:34,789 --> 01:23:37,350
Oh, me too.

1598
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:39,350
Alright, let's go Super Saiyan. Give me that health, yes.

1599
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:43,899
Oh, come on.

1600
01:23:43,899 --> 01:23:46,199
We got to burn up as quick as we can.

1601
01:23:46,199 --> 01:23:48,199
He's crushing me right now.

1602
01:23:48,199 --> 01:23:50,500
He's going to do the poison thing.

1603
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,500
He's going to do the poison thing.

1604
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,500
When he does it, make a run for it.

1605
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,000
Try not to stand in it. There it is.

1606
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Don't stand in it. Oh, no!

1607
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Oh, that was so close.

1608
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I get the orb.

1609
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Get away.

1610
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
That was so close. He does this

1611
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,649
for so long on Nightmare.

1612
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:12,649
Alright, come on. Here we go.

1613
01:24:12,649 --> 01:24:14,649
Come on, come on, come on.

1614
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,649
Pick up that health.

1615
01:24:16,649 --> 01:24:21,000
There's a health right in front of you. Don't get it yet.

1616
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Oh, dear.

1617
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I didn't hold shift.

1618
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
There's another health there. We'll be okay.

1619
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I'm going to grab it. I need it.

1620
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:35,130
Watch out.

1621
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:37,430
Oh, crap.

1622
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:39,670
Get that health globe. I'm alright.

1623
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:44,920
Here he goes. Here he goes. Run.

1624
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,920
Run around. Don't stand in it.

1625
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,800
Oh, no.

1626
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,800
I'm so dead. I died.

1627
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,800
Are you dead? Oh, no.

1628
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,800
Can I revive you? Can I revive you?

1629
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,800
Come on. Come on.

1630
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,300
Oh, this is bad.

1631
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,300
This is bad.

1632
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:05,500
Oh, no. It's over.

1633
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,119
Get that health.

1634
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:10,300
You know what I have to do? I have to do it

1635
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,300
right now.

1636
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,659
Right now. Come on.

1637
01:25:14,659 --> 01:25:16,659
Come on, you son of a bitch. Yes.

1638
01:25:16,659 --> 01:25:18,659
Alright, run.

1639
01:25:18,659 --> 01:25:22,439
We got to do some damage to him.

1640
01:25:22,439 --> 01:25:24,439
He's not dropping any globes.

1641
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:26,810
There's one. There's one.

1642
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:28,810
Alright, good. Smoke him. Smoke him.

1643
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:30,810
Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.

1644
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:32,810
Oh, I'm stuck in the corner over here.

1645
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:34,810
I just died again.

1646
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:36,810
No.

1647
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:38,810
Oh, my God.

1648
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,810
No, don't die.

1649
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:42,810
Oh, I'm so dead. It is over.

1650
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:45,880
Super Saiyan mode.

1651
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,880
Go. Go. Smash him. Smash him. Smash him. Smash him.

1652
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:54,579
No.

1653
01:25:54,579 --> 01:25:56,579
Oh, it's over. We're dead.

1654
01:25:56,579 --> 01:25:58,949
Oh, it's going to hit me and I'm going to die.

1655
01:25:58,949 --> 01:26:00,949
I need to get a globe out of him.

1656
01:26:00,949 --> 01:26:06,310
It's over, regardless.

1657
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:08,680
That was disappointing.

1658
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,680
Yeah, it was a little too hard.

1659
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,680
A little too hard.

1660
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,680
I just got to go repair.

1661
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:17,180
We know what we need.

1662
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:20,819
We need to get potions.

1663
01:26:20,819 --> 01:26:22,819
I didn't have any potions.

1664
01:26:22,819 --> 01:26:24,819
I had like one potion. Going back to Tom.

1665
01:26:24,819 --> 01:26:27,579
Damn.

1666
01:26:27,579 --> 01:26:33,590
We got him down to half.

1667
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:35,590
Sorry, I was paying attention to that craziness.

1668
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:38,149
When you die, you don't lose your character.

1669
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:40,149
No, you don't. That's hardcore mode only.

1670
01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:42,149
If we just lost our characters right there,

1671
01:26:42,149 --> 01:26:44,149
I would have peed my pants and then like

1672
01:26:44,149 --> 01:26:46,149
pooed my pants immediately after peeing.

1673
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:48,149
I would have never played this game again.

1674
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:50,520
All right.

1675
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,520
The potion person is down here in town.

1676
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:55,909
And yeah, I absolutely will do arenas.

1677
01:26:55,909 --> 01:27:00,970
Absolutely.

1678
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:02,970
I can't wait for them to come out to be honest.

1679
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:06,810
It's going to be awesome. I need to go.

1680
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:10,899
Where's the potion person?

1681
01:27:10,899 --> 01:27:12,899
I think they're like in another little area, aren't they?

1682
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:17,130
Oh, they're all over here. I'm thinking of Act 3.

1683
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:20,970
Yeah, I got to think of a good arena team.

1684
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:23,210
Because

1685
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:25,960
there's going to be a lot of options.

1686
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:30,760
Bye, bye, bye, bye.

1687
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:35,939
Super health potions.

1688
01:27:35,939 --> 01:27:39,399
Okay. Yeah, this game is awesome

1689
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:41,399
for solo. The reason why me and him are having trouble

1690
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:43,399
right now is because this is nightmare.

1691
01:27:43,399 --> 01:27:45,399
This is on a higher difficulty mode.

1692
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:47,399
And when there's

1693
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:50,090
more than one person in a game,

1694
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:52,090
it makes the game like twice

1695
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:54,090
as hard.

1696
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:56,090
So when three people are in the game, it's three times as hard.

1697
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:58,090
When four people are in the game, it is at max difficulty.

1698
01:27:58,090 --> 01:28:03,979
All right.

1699
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:07,430
Are you ready to try this again?

1700
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:09,430
Yeah.

1701
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:11,430
If we wipe again, then we're going to have to go back

1702
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:13,989
and we should be

1703
01:28:13,989 --> 01:28:15,989
all right this time. We didn't have potions.

1704
01:28:15,989 --> 01:28:17,989
You got potions, right?

1705
01:28:17,989 --> 01:28:19,989
I got four. I'll be good.

1706
01:28:19,989 --> 01:28:21,989
All right. You sure? I don't know about that.

1707
01:28:21,989 --> 01:28:23,989
Four potions doesn't seem like very much.

1708
01:28:23,989 --> 01:28:25,989
I better put on the heroic ones, too.

1709
01:28:25,989 --> 01:28:28,739
Let's go.

1710
01:28:28,739 --> 01:28:34,180
Here we go again.

1711
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:39,050
We're doing it again.

1712
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:44,810
Let's do it. Nightmare.

1713
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:51,020
You know what I'm going to put on?

1714
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:53,020
I got to put on a different passive.

1715
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:55,699
Where is it?

1716
01:28:55,699 --> 01:28:57,880
I forgot to do a better offensive move.

1717
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,880
When we have a second here,

1718
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,880
I'm going to put on the health globe one because we get more health globes.

1719
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:04,760
Because we need them bad, bad, bad.

1720
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:06,760
I'm going to hide behind your minions.

1721
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,130
All right. Let's do it.

1722
01:29:09,130 --> 01:29:11,130
What am I going to replace it with?

1723
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:13,619
Where is it?

1724
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:15,619
Take it. Thank you very much.

1725
01:29:15,619 --> 01:29:18,250
So what this is going to do, guys,

1726
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:20,250
is I just put on a passive ability

1727
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:22,250
that makes it so much more

1728
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,250
health globes drop and they heal for much more.

1729
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:26,250
The health globes are little

1730
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:28,250
health bubbles you see on the ground.

1731
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:36,810
This is absolutely

1732
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:39,750
worth getting.

1733
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,750
Troy Thorn. What's up, man?

1734
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:44,630
I'm not sure I'm going to be able

1735
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:46,630
to make it to Pax Prime.

1736
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:49,000
The only reason is because it's just a lot of money.

1737
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I don't have the money to fly out there.

1738
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,300
I think the tickets are even sold out now,

1739
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:56,119
to be honest.

1740
01:29:56,119 --> 01:29:58,119
So I'm probably not going to make it to Pax Prime.

1741
01:29:58,119 --> 01:30:00,119
We'll see, though. I'm not totally

1742
01:30:00,119 --> 01:30:03,640
ruling it out of the question.

1743
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,640
All right. I'm doing much better this time. Much more controlled.

1744
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:10,310
I died twice

1745
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:12,310
last time. Can't blame you

1746
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:14,739
for that.

1747
01:30:14,739 --> 01:30:17,050
Are you going to watch that poison?

1748
01:30:17,050 --> 01:30:20,550
My guy's like

1749
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:22,550
too, like,

1750
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:24,550
his back is too ush to run.

1751
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:28,710
I was

1752
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:30,710
at Pax East. I was at Pax East.

1753
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:33,020
All right. Here we go.

1754
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:35,020
Wow. We destroyed him that time.

1755
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:37,380
Yeah. Well,

1756
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:40,140
this is the part that matters.

1757
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:42,140
And here we go.

1758
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:45,020
Thank you, Geronimo.

1759
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:47,020
Whatever your name is. Thank you so much.

1760
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:49,020
All right. This is where we go. Super Saiyan!

1761
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,770
Puke. All over.

1762
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:53,770
All right. Leave the health globes alone.

1763
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:55,770
Let them stay. Let them stick around for a little bit.

1764
01:30:55,770 --> 01:31:00,119
You know what I mean? Until we need them.

1765
01:31:00,119 --> 01:31:02,119
I'm going to grab this one now. This one right next to me.

1766
01:31:02,119 --> 01:31:04,119
Good. This health globe thing was something I absolutely

1767
01:31:04,119 --> 01:31:07,130
should have had on from the beginning.

1768
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:09,130
So what you're saying, it's all your fault.

1769
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,130
Pretty much it's all my fault.

1770
01:31:13,819 --> 01:31:15,819
Watch it. There we go. Oh, no. Not again.

1771
01:31:15,819 --> 01:31:17,819
Anything but this.

1772
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:19,819
Try and stay away from each other. We're going to like bump into each other.

1773
01:31:19,819 --> 01:31:24,619
All right. Let's do it.

1774
01:31:24,619 --> 01:31:27,369
Start it up. Start smashing.

1775
01:31:27,369 --> 01:31:29,369
Health globe. Health globes everywhere

1776
01:31:29,369 --> 01:31:31,539
now. We're good.

1777
01:31:31,539 --> 01:31:33,539
Or are we? Maybe I spoke a little too soon.

1778
01:31:33,539 --> 01:31:35,539
I had to take a potion.

1779
01:31:35,539 --> 01:31:37,979
Take as many as you need.

1780
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:39,979
You're the tank.

1781
01:31:39,979 --> 01:31:43,180
Oh, don't you spray that at me.

1782
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:45,180
How dare you?

1783
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:51,180
I'm running this way.

1784
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:53,180
He's going to do that thing again. Very, very soon.

1785
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:55,180
Oh, here it comes.

1786
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:57,180
Yeah, it's definitely coming like right now.

1787
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,180
Oh, you had to do that right before

1788
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,609
you did this. Here it is.

1789
01:32:01,609 --> 01:32:03,609
Oh, no. Oh, don't get clubbed to the quarter.

1790
01:32:03,609 --> 01:32:07,319
Don't get clubbed to the quarter.

1791
01:32:07,319 --> 01:32:10,069
Oh, my God. Oh, no.

1792
01:32:10,069 --> 01:32:12,760
Oh, I got hit by one.

1793
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,130
We're good. We're good. We're good.

1794
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:18,899
Even those dogs are like upset about this.

1795
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:20,899
We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it.

1796
01:32:20,899 --> 01:32:26,579
So

1797
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:28,579
pissed about it. So funny.

1798
01:32:28,579 --> 01:32:30,579
Dude,

1799
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:32,579
this is getting so intense. Even like the dogs

1800
01:32:32,579 --> 01:32:34,949
are getting intense.

1801
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:37,699
Oh, no.

1802
01:32:37,699 --> 01:32:39,699
He's going to do it one more time. It's going to happen probably like

1803
01:32:39,699 --> 01:32:43,100
right now. I'm going to have

1804
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,100
super saiyan mode one more time.

1805
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,100
Come on. Oh, no.

1806
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,100
Watch it. Here it is. Here it is.

1807
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:51,720
Oh, this is the last one.

1808
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:55,109
That's it. We got to only deal with this last one

1809
01:32:55,109 --> 01:32:58,380
and we'll kill him.

1810
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,130
Yes.

1811
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:03,130
All right. Burn him. I'm going super saiyan.

1812
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:05,430
To death.

1813
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:07,430
Burn him. Burn him.

1814
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:09,430
Kill him. Oh, legendary.

1815
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:11,430
Come on. Oh, it's over, baby. Legendary.

1816
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:13,430
Legendary. Legendary.

1817
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:15,430
Legendary. Come on.

1818
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:19,590
Crap.

1819
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:21,770
Kidding me.

1820
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:23,770
What is that? Garbage.

1821
01:33:27,859 --> 01:33:32,789
Oh, man.

1822
01:33:32,789 --> 01:33:34,789
All that for blues.

1823
01:33:34,789 --> 01:33:36,789
I just got blues too.

1824
01:33:36,789 --> 01:33:40,500
Rage. Quit.

1825
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:42,500
Rage. Quit.

1826
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,869
Oh, well.

1827
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:46,869
That was pretty difficult. Not going to lie.

1828
01:33:46,869 --> 01:33:52,060
Where is auto?

1829
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:55,060
Auto. Auto.

1830
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:58,199
I don't want to move on.

1831
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:00,199
Where are they?

1832
01:34:00,199 --> 01:34:02,199
Where is shibby stealth star? Where is everybody?

1833
01:34:02,199 --> 01:34:04,199
Get a four player action going.

1834
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:06,630
Continue on to act three.

1835
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:08,630
I would absolutely say that.

1836
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:12,979
That actually was not auto.

1837
01:34:12,979 --> 01:34:14,979
That was Burger Boy's two dogs.

1838
01:34:14,979 --> 01:34:16,979
He has two big crazy dogs.

1839
01:34:16,979 --> 01:34:18,979
They're like 180 pounds each.

1840
01:34:18,979 --> 01:34:20,979
They both like

1841
01:34:20,979 --> 01:34:22,979
they stand six feet tall.

1842
01:34:22,979 --> 01:34:26,380
I got to

1843
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:29,640
check on the stuff I just got.

1844
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,640
Well, that was a bad crate.

1845
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:33,640
Yeah, it was.

1846
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:35,640
That was like a crate eight.

1847
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,649
No strangers, no nothing.

1848
01:34:38,649 --> 01:34:40,649
The only crates I ever opened.

1849
01:34:40,649 --> 01:34:42,649
The real problem here is

1850
01:34:42,649 --> 01:34:44,649
we've got to get magic find.

1851
01:34:44,649 --> 01:34:46,649
I don't have like any. You don't have any.

1852
01:34:46,649 --> 01:34:48,649
We need like 100 percent

1853
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:53,829
extra magic find.

1854
01:34:53,829 --> 01:34:57,859
I'm going to save those for shibby.

1855
01:34:57,859 --> 01:34:59,859
These

1856
01:34:59,859 --> 01:35:02,680
are actually not that great.

1857
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:05,050
I'm selling them.

1858
01:35:05,050 --> 01:35:07,050
Could I sell them in the auction house?

1859
01:35:07,050 --> 01:35:09,050
Probably not. The stats on these are really just

1860
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:11,670
dumb. I'm selling them.

1861
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,670
Sockets are good, but not

1862
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:15,670
I'm not really too concerned about it.

1863
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:21,369
This is not that bad, but I got better.

1864
01:35:21,369 --> 01:35:24,119
This is

1865
01:35:24,119 --> 01:35:27,260
not that good. This is not that good.

1866
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,260
And this is not that good.

1867
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,939
Alright. Actually, I think I had auctions

1868
01:35:31,939 --> 01:35:33,939
that were going. I wonder if they sold.

1869
01:35:33,939 --> 01:35:38,300
I'm going to check on my auctions for a second.

1870
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:40,300
Okay. So I'm going to

1871
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:42,600
show you guys the auction house.

1872
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,600
I'm doing the same. Okay.

1873
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,600
So this is the auction house.

1874
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,600
So what you do here is

1875
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,600
you go to equipment, gems,

1876
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,600
crafting, recipes, pages,

1877
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,600
and you can search for stuff. So let's say right now I'm level

1878
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,600
43. So let's say I want something in

1879
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,600
40, the 40 to 45

1880
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,970
range, right?

1881
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:02,970
And I want one-handed

1882
01:36:02,970 --> 01:36:04,970
weapons. And it doesn't matter

1883
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:06,970
what one-handed, I want it to be rare

1884
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:08,970
though. I want it to be of rare quality.

1885
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:10,970
So right now I just hit search. These are people

1886
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:12,970
that are selling things on the

1887
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:15,460
auction house in

1888
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:17,460
that particular category

1889
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:19,460
that I just mentioned. So right now

1890
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:21,460
if you take a look at this, this guy is absolutely

1891
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:23,460
not going to sell this. This thing, he's selling this for

1892
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:25,460
8 million gold. Which is

1893
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:27,460
I mean, I don't

1894
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:29,460
know if you're like going to sell that.

1895
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:31,460
But see, what you can do is

1896
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:33,460
you can play the auction house, right? You can play the field.

1897
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:35,460
So you go back to like the

1898
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:37,460
bids and the buyouts to some of the cheaper stuff.

1899
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:39,699
There's a lot of pages

1900
01:36:39,699 --> 01:36:42,899
as you can see. And Burger Boy

1901
01:36:42,899 --> 01:36:44,899
is going to like puke on

1902
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:46,899
his microphone.

1903
01:36:46,899 --> 01:36:48,899
See this is the least expensive one in here

1904
01:36:48,899 --> 01:36:50,899
for the level 40 to 45 range.

1905
01:36:50,899 --> 01:36:52,899
$115,000. So if I bought this

1906
01:36:52,899 --> 01:36:54,899
right now, I have $118,000.

1907
01:36:54,899 --> 01:36:56,899
If I bought this

1908
01:36:56,899 --> 01:36:58,899
right now for $115,000

1909
01:36:58,899 --> 01:37:00,899
I mean it really wouldn't be that

1910
01:37:00,899 --> 01:37:03,399
good.

1911
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:05,399
Because obviously you can

1912
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:07,399
find stuff, you can make stuff. Or you could buy this

1913
01:37:07,399 --> 01:37:09,399
and then resell it and try and get more money

1914
01:37:09,399 --> 01:37:12,090
for it. But for now

1915
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:14,090
let's go to my completed auctions.

1916
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:16,899
See I put this up for $160,000

1917
01:37:16,899 --> 01:37:21,130
gold.

1918
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:23,130
This should have sold though. This is $14,000

1919
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:26,899
that's like chump change.

1920
01:37:26,899 --> 01:37:28,899
You can see your past auctions.

1921
01:37:28,899 --> 01:37:30,899
This is like the money that I've

1922
01:37:30,899 --> 01:37:32,899
made. Money that I've made.

1923
01:37:32,899 --> 01:37:35,590
Money that I've purchased.

1924
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:37,590
See it can get really really addicting.

1925
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:39,960
It can get really addicting.

1926
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:48,409
Eventually

1927
01:37:48,409 --> 01:37:53,079
see currency.

1928
01:37:53,079 --> 01:37:55,079
The real currency auction house will be available

1929
01:37:55,079 --> 01:37:57,079
at a later date. $529.

1930
01:37:57,079 --> 01:37:59,079
So in a couple weeks you're going to

1931
01:37:59,079 --> 01:38:01,079
be able to use real money

1932
01:38:01,079 --> 01:38:03,079
to buy things. People are going to be able

1933
01:38:03,079 --> 01:38:05,079
to put like oh here's my

1934
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:07,079
attack weapon thing.

1935
01:38:07,079 --> 01:38:09,079
It's $5.

1936
01:38:09,079 --> 01:38:11,079
Real money. And it's going to be totally

1937
01:38:11,079 --> 01:38:13,079
legal, totally encouraged. It's going to be

1938
01:38:13,079 --> 01:38:15,079
ridiculous.
