1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,570
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 Grain Play Cromontary.

2
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:21,570
And tonight, I'm gonna be playing as the Devil Man with the Lock and Load, the Shield of Righteousness, and the Islander.

3
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,870
I don't know why the Islander's on. I mean, I think I killed maybe one person with it.

4
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:33,869
It doesn't go through my brain at the given time that maybe I should probably take this thing off and put on a sword that's not gonna gimp me for the rest of this game.

5
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,369
But I didn't. It stays on, whatever we're gonna move on.

6
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:41,369
And the first thing we're gonna talk about is my new computer. It's sitting up here on the shelf.

7
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,369
It looks beautiful. It looks pretty. I wanna kiss it right in the face.

8
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:49,369
Now, I'm gonna show you some pictures because I promised that I would show you what it looked like.

9
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:53,369
You know, people wondering what the case looked like, how does it look, what lights are inside of it.

10
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:59,369
There's one thing that I kinda don't like about it, and it's very, very minor. It's a very stupid thing to not like.

11
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:05,370
But the light on the graphics card, if you can see there, it says GeForce GTX in like a bright lime green.

12
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,370
That's cool. I think it's interesting, but sometimes it kinda catches my eye because I'm looking straight at it.

13
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:17,370
I'll show you a couple pictures here. You can see how it's just GeForce GTX like right in my face almost at all times.

14
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,370
And there's probably some way to turn that off in the bios. I just don't know how to do that.

15
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:27,799
But I love this thing. It's great. It's amazing. It allows me to do 1080p videos, 100% reliable now.

16
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:35,799
There will never be a 720 video on this channel. It's always gonna be 1080p from now until the hour of our death. Amen.

17
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,799
But yes, if it looks better, please let me know. If it looks worse, then that would be pretty odd,

18
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,799
considering that this is like one of the only times I've ever been able to reliably record 1080p.

19
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:53,799
And I don't know, you'd probably have to stuff a thermometer up my ass and I'd probably have a fever at that point because I'd be very steaming mad.

20
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,659
Anyways, why did I just say that? That was a very weird thing to say.

21
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:03,659
So what I want to talk about in this video is not so much the computer. We already kind of went over that.

22
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,210
But I want to talk about this gameplay and getting mad at video games, getting angry at games.

23
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:17,210
A lot of you guys know that I happen to do that from time to time. I swear. You know, don't say swears.

24
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,210
Look, I said it. There, I said it. I said it. I actually said it for the second time in my life.

25
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,379
And we're going to talk about swears. We're going to talk about swearing.

26
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,379
We're going to talk about energy coming out of your body when you're playing games.

27
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:32,379
And this gameplay right here is one of those times when I was a little upset.

28
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:36,379
I might have been a little angry. I might have been, you mad? Yeah, I was.

29
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:41,560
And here's why. What you haven't seen in this gameplay so far is us getting steamrolled.

30
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,560
We were getting destroyed for like 10 straight minutes.

31
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Like there was two rounds before this or three rounds before this where we were losing substantially

32
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,560
and not even to the point where, oh, there's like two people on your team that are okay

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,560
and there's like three people on the other team that are doing great.

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,560
No, we were just getting crushed. Like, you know, you've had those games, we've all had them,

35
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,560
where the cart starts at the starting point and in like two blinks of an eye,

36
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,560
you look over and the cart has passed like the second goddamn point.

37
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,560
It was one of those games and it happened a couple of times in a row.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
And it's very frustrating.

39
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,560
And I don't think getting mad at games is particularly a bad thing or getting frustrated at games.

40
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,800
But when you get mad at other people, that's when things start to get a little out of hand.

41
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,800
And let's say you're like, oh, this medic on my team sucks. Fucking kill him.

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Like, no, that's not how I get really mad at games.

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,800
When I get mad at games, I get mad at like the stuff in the games

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
rather than the people playing them.

45
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,169
Except if your name is Star, then like fuck you because like you do it on purpose.

46
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:54,599
But what I'm getting at here, the real purpose of this video is when you get flustered

47
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,599
or when you get mad at a certain game, it doesn't have to just be Team Fortress 2.

48
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,599
It could be anything. It could be a MOBA. It could be an FPS. It could be an RTS.

49
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,599
It really doesn't matter what it is. You lose your edge.

50
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,599
I mean, there are probably some people that when they get mad, they play better,

51
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,599
but I'm not one of those people.

52
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,599
When I get pissed off at something, when I get really annoyed at something,

53
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,600
my skill level goes down like 60% because I'm just sitting there like fucking good.

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Oh, you think your stupid game sucks?

55
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
And you can't even focus on what you're trying to do.

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,899
And if you just took a second, one second or two seconds to just sit back in your chair for a second,

57
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:39,079
let it run its course, and then go back into what you were doing, you'll be much better off.

58
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,079
This gameplay you're watching right now is that exact case.

59
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,079
I was playing like shit. We were getting destroyed.

60
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,079
I was playing like shit pretty much all day as well, trying to record some stuff,

61
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,079
trying to get some cool footage, and then this happened after I just calmed down.

62
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,639
So the moral of the story is this.

63
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,819
It's okay to get frustrated. It's okay to get mad at games.

64
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:03,819
Because the more you get frustrated, the more you will actually learn

65
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,819
because that means you didn't do something correctly

66
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:10,819
or you learn about a new game mechanic or a player was just better than you

67
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,819
and you can learn off of what they did.

68
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:17,990
So it's okay to get frustrated. Just try not to go totally overboard

69
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,990
because once you fall off the boat and there's like a storm like lightning striking and stuff

70
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,990
and it's like the boat is going up and down on the waves,

71
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,990
once you go overboard, that life vest ain't going to help you.

72
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,990
You think somebody's going to throw it to you and it's going to land in front of you.

73
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,990
You're going to be swimming to it like you're going to go under.

74
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,990
That's what's going to happen. So don't go overboard. Just stay on the goddamn boat.

75
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,170
Yell at the captain. If the captain's like going over these waves like shit,

76
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,170
he'd be like, hey, captain, fuck you. You suck at boating.

77
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,970
All right. Well, you don't have to. That would be kind of mean.

78
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,970
But just don't go overboard because once you're there, it's hard to come back.

79
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,459
And with that, I'm going to wrap up this video, guys.

80
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,459
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

81
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:07,050
And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course,
