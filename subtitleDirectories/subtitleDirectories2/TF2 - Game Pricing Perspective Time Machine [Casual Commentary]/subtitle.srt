00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,529
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jirban here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:22,879
And tonight, I'm gonna be playing as the Soldier with the black box, the Conqueror, and the halfs of Taichi.

3
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:29,879
And tonight we're gonna talk about some stuff today, not really to do with the Soldier, or really to do with TF2 that much.

4
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,880
But we're gonna talk about it regardless. And before I even get started, I wanna make a couple of points here.

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,880
Number one, Happy New Year. Happy New Year, it's 2014, probably when you're watching this. I don't know when it's gonna get uploaded.

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,880
It'll probably get uploaded either a few hours before New Year's, or a day after New Year's Eve, or something.

7
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,880
I don't know, but regardless, Happy New Year, welcome to 2014. And we'll move on from that.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,119
Hopefully you saw the ball drop. Hopefully my balls dropped. They already did. I did hit puberty already.

9
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:04,299
So secondly, if you happen to miss the Grandpa Christmas Story, which was an animation, it was a fully animated short,

10
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:10,299
that was animated by my buddy Blordow, I highly suggest you go check it out. There's gonna be a link in the description.

11
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:14,469
If you did happen to miss it, that's pretty much all I wanna say, because I wanna give that more attention.

12
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:18,469
I feel like a lot of people just kinda skipped over it, because it was like, oh, well, I don't even know what the fuck this is,

13
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:22,469
so I'm just not gonna watch it. But it's there in the description. Please go give it some love.

14
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:31,140
And now, we can talk about the actual point of this video. The whole reason why I decided to make this video has to do with money.

15
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,140
We're gonna talk about cash. We're gonna talk about paper in this video. We're gonna talk about that real cheddar cheese.

16
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,140
So sit back and relax, and open the discussion up in the comments section if you wanna add to this.

17
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,140
But it's gonna talk about gaming money. It's not like in-game currency.

18
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:53,140
It's gonna talk about gaming and the monetary value of games, and how it's really changed a lot in the last few years.

19
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,140
It has changed insanely in the last few years.

20
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:04,640
Hop in a time machine with me. Let's go inside Jerma's big fat hot tub time machine, and let's go back to a time in the mid to late 90s.

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,639
We're gonna go to like 1995 or 1996, when the cartridge consoles were kind of still relevant.

22
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,639
We're gonna talk about like Nintendo 64.

23
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:22,009
Those of us that are old enough to remember going into the stores and buying games or being young and having your parents buy.

24
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,009
Like, I want that one. Okay, honey. I love you.

25
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:32,159
You will remember Cartridge Games GoldenEye 007 was $79.

26
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:41,159
It was $80 fucking dollars off the shelf retail at a place like a GameStop or electronics boutique, I think is what it used to be called.

27
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,659
We were totally okay with paying that.

28
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:48,659
I never saw a complaint of anybody really talking about how that's not worth it.

29
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:55,659
Oh my god, $80. I'm gonna fight the system. No goddamn way I'm paying $80 for GoldenEye.

30
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:01,659
Everybody did it because that's just what it cost. That's what the games costed back then, especially if it was a cartridge.

31
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:09,009
Now, you can get out of my time machine. We can go back to like 2012, 2013, 14, whatever year you want to say it is.

32
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:18,789
And if a game was gonna cost $80 nowadays, that thing had better have some goddamn collector's edition shit inside of that box.

33
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:24,789
You better open that box and there's like a little figurine of Solid Snake and he has a button on his arm and you hit it and you go to Kung Fu Action.

34
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:30,789
Like, there better be that in that goddamn box or you're gonna be pissed off if the game is $80 at retail.

35
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:34,460
And I was thinking about this the other day. What happened?

36
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,699
Why did we just become not okay with paying that much money for a video game?

37
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:43,699
And now I'm not saying that that's that, oh man, I wish games were $80 still.

38
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,699
No, no. God, no, because that would suck because I spend so much money on games to begin with.

39
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,699
I'm glad that games are a lot cheaper now, especially if you're on PC.

40
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:57,699
If you're on console, you're still looking at about like $50 to $60 for every pretty much major retail release.

41
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:05,699
But on PC, we have the Steam sales, the Stales, we have the Steam sales, we have Amazon, we have get a good old games.

42
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:10,879
We have a lot of places that give us high discounts on games, but the point still stands.

43
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,879
Nobody is really willing to pay $80 anymore for a default standard game.

44
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:22,879
Now you can go to the manufacturing side of things and say, well, Jerma, the reason why they are not $80 anymore

45
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,879
is because cartridges were crazy expensive to make and discs are a lot cheaper.

46
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,879
Yeah, that makes a whole lot of sense. That does make sense.

47
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:38,920
But people are really, really hesitant nowadays to spend even like $15 to $20 on a game now that's new.

48
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,920
I'm guilty of doing this. I am guilty myself of doing this, and I'm trying to figure out why this is.

49
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,920
A game will come out on Steam that I know is supposed to be pretty good.

50
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,920
I've seen reviews on it. I've heard people talk about it, and it's like $25.

51
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,160
And I'm sitting there in my chair going, it's a little too, it's a little fucking expensive, ain't it?

52
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,160
And then I go back in time and I'm like, wait, I used to spend $80 on games.

53
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,160
What am I talking about? Why is that such a big deal?

54
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Why is a game being like $17 or $16, $15, whatever your regional equivalent is, why is that such a big deal now?

55
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
I don't know.

56
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,660
And especially considering that graphical fidelity in games has gone really through the roof in the last 10 to 20 years.

57
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,660
You guys remember like Tomb Raider, remember old PlayStation 1 Tomb Raider

58
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,660
with like the triangle block boobs?

59
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,660
Like that's an iconic picture when you're talking about graphical fidelity.

60
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:39,089
But I know most of these games that come out nowadays are a little less graphical fidelity.

61
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:45,089
They're very retro. They're very stylized. They're not so much, hey, look at our crazy graphics engine as it is.

62
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:48,089
Hey, look at this fun gameplay that I created. I understand that.

63
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:51,459
But I'm just trying to piece the pieces together.

64
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,459
And if you guys have any ideas in the comments, please let me know.

65
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:59,459
But why are we okay with paying that much money back then but not okay with it now?

66
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,459
I guess that's the question of the video.

67
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,629
So that's going to wrap it up, guys. I hope you enjoyed.

68
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,629
I'll see you guys all next time.

69
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:07,629
Thank you so much for watching.

70
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,629
That's going to wrap up the video.

71
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:15,779
And of course, take care, everybody.

72
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,779
You probably expected a weird sound sometimes like I do at the end of my videos.

73
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,019
I don't know.

74
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,019
Kind of got old.
