1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:10,060
I was looking for a health pack. What did I do?

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:16,269
Hold on, hold on. I found a wild Shpee. He's a baby. He doesn't know where he is.

3
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:22,280
He's figuring out how to use the disguise kit. I figured out how to use

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:31,859
the... I just killed a baby Shpee.

5
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:46,200
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:01:00,079
Oh, I think this is him. Oh no. Did the baby Shpee make it out okay?

7
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,500
I need to check on him. Where is he? There he is. Okay, baby Shpee.

8
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,319
Are you alright? No, that's not a baby. That's not a baby Shpee. That's an adult.

9
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:19,930
That was an adult. What are you doing, baby?

10
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,760
What are you doing? You can't get over to the tires. What are you doing?

11
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,909
I have to go into the tires. I need to get this way.

12
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:32,609
I am a Shpee. Ahhhh.

13
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:39,280
How could you? He was a baby. So while you are

14
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,980
baby Shpee watching, one thing you really have to do, guys, is you have to protect

15
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,879
the really young ones, the ones that just got out of the nest.

16
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,980
They're not going to be too sure what's happening.

17
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,180
You have to be there to protect them, to lead them in the right way,

18
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,680
because their mother is not here. Baby Shpees leave the nest at 11 days old.

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,280
And you see this one right here is walking all over the map.

20
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,780
He's not exactly sure where he's going. I'm not sure if he's looking for food,

21
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,480
if he's trying to scavenge a rat or a mouse somewhere. That could be the case.

22
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,780
His legs are not strong. As you see here, he's standing still.

23
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,479
He doesn't get strong enough legs until he gets to adolescence.

24
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,180
So that's something to keep in mind. We're going to hope he gets his first kill here,

25
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,180
because if a baby Shpee gets his first kill, then they can get their wings

26
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,379
and they can start to fly. And I'm really hoping.

27
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,280
I don't want to mess around with nature right here, guys.

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,080
I'm going to try to lead him in the right direction as best as I can,

29
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,379
but not a good idea right now. He's coming back to the enemy spawn.

30
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,379
I'm not sure what he's disguised as. This is not a good situation.

31
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,379
I might have to come out here. Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no.

32
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,180
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't, don't, don't.

33
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,780
So I have made it my mission to be able to protect the baby Shpees at all costs.

34
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,680
I'm going to go heavy. I'm going to protect this guy at all costs.

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,879
No matter what happens, I am going to protect that he's dead.

36
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,939
Hi. Hi.

37
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:57,979
Set up time. Hi.

38
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:00,979
You want to play spy? Yes, we're supposed to be.

39
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,979
You want to Shpee? Yes. Yes.

40
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:04,979
Okay. Sniper, hi.

41
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:06,979
We both die. We'll walk out spawn and die.

42
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,979
I die. This is walk out spawn, same time, die.

43
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:11,979
I love you. Okay, we'll walk out spawn, same time, die.

44
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:13,979
Okay, I follow you. We both go.

45
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:26,699
I'm really happy about this one, guys. I'm so glad we found this.

46
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,699
Statistically, about 700 Shpees are born every minute.

47
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:36,699
And unfortunately, only about two will ever survive leaving the nest.

48
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:39,699
We have found one of those spies right here.

49
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,699
Looks like he's got himself a good job, maybe a wife.

50
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,699
He probably even has a nest of his own.

51
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:48,699
He has reached spyhood. He is no longer a Shrey.
