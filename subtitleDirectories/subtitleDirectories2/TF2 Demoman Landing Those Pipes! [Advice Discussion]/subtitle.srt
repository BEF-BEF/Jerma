00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,500
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jirma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,500
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Demoman with the stuff that's on the screen right now.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,500
I believe it's the strange lock and load, the charge and torch, and the islander, strange islander.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,500
And of course, you got the hats and crap, the miscellaneous whatever, battery canteen, who cares?

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,109
So today I want to talk about something, not really to do about the gameplay, but to do with Team Fortress 2.

6
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:44,109
Specifically, how to get better at landing your pipes, or really anything in this game that has travel time.

7
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:50,109
This is not really gonna talk about hitscan, although this will probably help you out with your skits- skitscan.

8
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:53,109
What the hell was I gonna just say? With your hitscan as well.

9
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:59,109
But it's mainly gonna focus on the travel time things, like the Demoman pipes, all the rocket launchers,

10
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:02,109
and even the syringe gun, this could probably help you out with the syringe gun as well.

11
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:09,349
And what it is, it's TR Walkway. I didn't know anything about this map for the longest time.

12
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:14,349
And just very recently, like in the last two months or so, I've been going onto TR Walkway,

13
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:18,349
it's just a map you can play pretty much by yourself, and just been shooting bots.

14
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:23,659
And it might seem like the most mundane, boring thing in the world, but it actually is pretty addicting.

15
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,659
They just keep coming out, and you're on the red team, they're on the blue team,

16
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:31,659
and it's just they walk in a straight line, straight at you, and you can kind of make some adjustments,

17
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:36,659
you can make them do jumps, you can make them move in a different direction, and it's pretty fun.

18
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,659
You'll find yourself just sitting there for what seems like hours shooting at these bots.

19
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,659
And it's so important that you do this for a while, and you practice inside a TR Walkway,

20
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:54,659
because eventually your muscle memory will get down to a point where you know exactly where to put your crosshair in an actual game.

21
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,659
You'll go, oh, this guy's moving in the direction that I'm used to, I know where I'm supposed to place this,

22
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,659
because I know exactly how it's going to move, I know how the trajectory is going to go,

23
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,659
and it's going to hit the guy, and he's going to die, and I'm going to get more points,

24
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,659
and I'm going to do better in Team Fortress 2.

25
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:13,219
And I mentioned why it's so important to be in something like TR Walkway,

26
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:19,460
because everybody always says that to get better at the game, you got to play, you got to practice,

27
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,460
to get better, you just play, and you get better.

28
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,460
But it can be pretty damn hard sometimes, because when you get into a server,

29
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,460
and there's a bunch of people that are way better than you,

30
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,460
you're not going to get to practice your rocket launcher shots,

31
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,460
because they're going to just kill you in less than a second, and you're going to start to feel bad.

32
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,460
So what the bots don't attack back is the main thing.

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,460
They just move, and you can practice, and it's a way better environment,

34
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,460
and a way better place to get comfortable with the way that these weapons actually work.

35
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:51,020
And you don't have to feel so pressured by going up against these guys that have been playing forever,

36
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
that know everything about every class, that you can take your time with it,

37
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,020
and just sit sort of in a corner, and just get used to the way the item works.

38
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:06,020
I've seen such a huge increase, guys, in my amount of pipes landed, especially with Demoman.

39
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:12,020
Like, I mean, Soldier is one thing, but my pipes landed with Demoman has gone up significantly

40
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,020
just by hanging out in a Skype call with friends and just messing around in TR Walkway.

41
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,189
And then there are many more places besides TR Walkway, don't get me wrong,

42
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:25,189
TR Walkway is not, like, the only map in Team Fortress 2 where you can practice your shots,

43
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:29,189
but it's the one that I use, it's the one that I've fallen in love with, I guess.

44
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:33,370
And I will leave a link in the description to tf2maps.net,

45
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,370
where you can go download TR Walkway if you do not have it.

46
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,370
And please, in the comments section, if any of you guys have any other options

47
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,370
for people that are just as good as TR Walkway or even better,

48
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,370
some better options or other places you can go,

49
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,370
then please, by all means, leave some comments for some of the people that could use the help.

50
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,180
So that about wraps up that part of this video.

51
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,180
And the second part of this video, which is only about a minute or so long before this ends,

52
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,180
is I got this question asked in my livestream the other day,

53
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,180
and it was, when is my sister's due date?

54
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,180
Because somebody said that that was probably coming up pretty soon.

55
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,180
And yes, I'm going to be an uncle fairly soon here, in the next three or four weeks.

56
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,180
I believe my sister's due date is July 31st, and I'll be going down to North Carolina,

57
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,180
be taking all kinds of pictures with the baby.

58
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,180
I'm sure I'll tweet them out, so if you're not following me on Twitter

59
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,180
and you want to see these type of things, then that's probably where you're going to be able to see them.

60
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,180
But it'll be interesting. My parents are all freaking out.

61
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,180
Everybody's like going nuts right now, trying to figure out flight plans,

62
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,180
when we're going to meet down there, who is going, who is not going.

63
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,420
So it should be pretty interesting.

64
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,420
I'm sure I'll be in overdrive mode in the next three or four weeks.

65
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,730
But we will cross that bridge when we have to.

66
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,730
And also, before this video ends, I'm sure you're noticing right now,

67
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,730
we're losing by a pretty huge margin.

68
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,730
I'm not exactly sure why, because, I mean, we were doing pretty well.

69
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,730
I think people just weren't going on the point.

70
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,730
I'm watching it right now, and I seriously can't believe that with overtime,

71
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,730
we only have like, what, 15, 20 seconds capped right now.

72
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,730
And I mean, I was killing a lot of people.

73
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,730
I was doing pretty well in this gameplay.

74
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,730
And it was probably because I was just moving around too much.

75
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,730
I was going, I was dodging around the point rather than jumping on the point.

76
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,730
I didn't really have stickies either, which was pretty much a disadvantage

77
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,730
when you use this setup.

78
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,730
You can't really defend points as well as you could with stickies.

79
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,100
But regardless of that, that's going to wrap up this video, guys.

80
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

81
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
And I'll see you guys all next time.

82
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,100
And of course, take care, everybody.
