1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,699
What's up, Doc? What's up, Doc?

2
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:25,699
I don't think a motorcycle can go through these tiny holes.

3
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,829
It's duck season.

4
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:34,390
Hey, Jeremiah, I think we're playing a zombie game and I need you to cooperate.

5
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,820
I have so much of this in my mouth. I have to spit this out.

6
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,049
What's up, Doc?

7
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:52,240
Dude, come on. I'm going to break your arms with this brick.

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,240
Shit, E. Press E.

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
Come on.

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:03,039
One hand plays the game, the other hand pretends to be Bugs Bunny.

11
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,010
Get in this taxi.

12
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,500
Yeah, scoop me up in the taxi.

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
That sounds like a good scooper.

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,109
No, put the thing down. Put it down. Put the thing down. Put the thing down.

15
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:20,480
What the fuck?

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,909
I'm not going to make it, man.

17
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:24,909
Holy shit.

18
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:28,109
Okay, dude, seriously.

19
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:30,109
What's happening?

20
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:34,109
Let me get a car. Stop. Stop driving.

21
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:36,109
I'm trying to get out of here. We have to go.

22
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:40,400
I know, but I want...

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
There we go. Okay, don't do anything.

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,069
All right, now drive.

25
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,069
Okay, now lift me up. Oh, this is going to work.

26
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:53,849
Is it going to work? Who is this working for?

27
00:01:53,849 --> 00:02:03,459
I think we are lagging bad because stuff is happening on my screen that's not...

28
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,459
Which actually is probably a pretty good thing.

29
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,770
So we should probably go do something stupid.

30
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,770
No, no, no, no, no, no.

31
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,770
I am done. We are playing the game.

32
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Let's go.

33
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,770
We are playing the video game Dead Rising 3.

34
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,939
There, I helped you get out.

35
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:24,939
Can my girlfriend come with us?

36
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:30,319
Absolutely, let's go.

37
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,319
Everybody loves Terra.

38
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,319
Oh my god, you...

39
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,319
Oh, made it.

40
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,319
Holy shit, that was a jump. I didn't even realize that.

41
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,319
Don't go back. I jumped out.

42
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,319
No, no, no, no, you idiot. Did you fall?

43
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,349
What are you doing? Get in.

44
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,349
I don't want to fall back.

45
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:50,349
I'm not going to fall back.

46
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,349
You seriously think I'm going to fall back?

47
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:57,090
What a fucking dummy.

48
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,090
I'm not doing this. Get in.

49
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,090
I'm not doing this joke.

50
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,090
Well, then you die. I surrender.

51
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,710
All right, get in for real.

52
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,590
Get in for real this time.

53
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,590
Get in for real.

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,590
I'm going to spin around. I'm going to do a three point turn.

55
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,590
I'm only doing this to get fucking, you know, able to...

56
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,080
What?

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Physics. Physics, how is this possible?

58
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Oh, there's a fucking thing in the middle right here.

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,919
Okay, it all worked out.

60
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,919
Look, it all worked out.

61
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,919
Now, climb back up.

62
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,919
Get in the car.

63
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,039
All right, I'll figure this all out.

64
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,039
Get out.

65
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,039
I'm begging you to come play the game with me.

66
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,039
I know, but this has to happen.

67
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,110
Push it off.

68
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,949
I want to see the big explosion.

69
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,949
No, it needs to fall off.

70
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:03,520
Don't just like throw shit at it.

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,949
Fuck.

72
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:09,409
What happened? Did you fall off?

73
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,409
No.

74
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,030
Hold on a second. I'm crashing.

75
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,269
I crashed. That's what happened.

76
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,899
I crashed.

77
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,899
No, no, no, no, no, no.

78
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,899
I am done.

79
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,899
We are playing the game.

80
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,899
Let's go.

81
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,899
Come on. Fill me with bullets.

82
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:30,899
Come on. That's all you got.

83
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:32,899
I can take another 200.

84
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:34,899
Another 2000.

85
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,889
No.

86
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:41,889
I've been thwarted.

87
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,420
I don't know what to do here, man.

88
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,420
There's a car blocking this way.

89
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,420
Do you see this car blocking the exit?

90
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,170
I see the car blocking the exit.

91
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,500
How am I supposed to get out of here?

92
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
There's a window.

93
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,079
Did you know there was a window?

94
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,500
Yeah.

95
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
She's calling in her reinforcements.

96
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Why did I just spawn next to her?

97
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,670
Yeah, you are right next to her.

98
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,980
Are you alive?

99
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,980
Yeah, the cutscene ended and I just appeared on her.

100
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,980
I have no guns now.

101
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,980
I'll kill her with flares.

102
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,240
See, you don't know where she is.

103
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,480
She's right there.

104
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,720
There's a grenade under your feet.

105
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,550
You probably should move.

106
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,790
Get in the car.

107
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,790
Get in the car this instant, young man.

108
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,420
No.

109
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,420
I got a call from Mrs. Rogerson.

110
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,420
Are you going to get a B- on your math exam?

111
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,420
No.

112
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,420
You get in this car right now.

113
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,420
No.

114
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,420
Your father is going to hear about this and he is going to lose his shit.

115
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,420
No.

116
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,420
Are you going to make me come all the way into the hotel?

117
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,680
Yeah.

118
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
I don't even like this hotel.

119
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,430
They don't even serve breakfast.

120
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,430
This thing is going to go.

121
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,430
If you touch a wall, all of your gamer skills are coming together right now.

122
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,430
All of my gamer skills need to be here.

123
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,430
I'm playing Operation.

124
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,430
Operation.

125
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,430
The thing with the naked guy that lies on the table and you have to pull his bones out.

126
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,430
We're playing that right now.

127
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,740
No.

128
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,740
That game where you pull bones out of...

129
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,910
Operation.

130
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,910
I don't think I can even go out here.

131
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,910
It's buzzing so loud right now.

132
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,600
I've lost so many times.

133
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
This is the guys femur.

134
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
That was always the hardest one.

135
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,290
The femur was the hardest one for me.

136
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,290
Mom, I don't want to go into the hotel.

137
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,290
You're in big trouble, mister.

138
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,290
I've come all the way into the hotel to get you.

139
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,290
And now I've got you.

140
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,290
And you're not going to even get your cereal.

141
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,589
Just like in GTA.

142
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:54,589
Take out the driver.

143
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:57,860
I'm alright.

144
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,319
He ate those all in one bite.

145
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,259
Easy.

146
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,720
What the fuck?

147
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,250
I got you something.

148
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,250
I got you a burrito from Taco Bell.

149
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,250
It's Chalupa.

150
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,939
Try it out.

151
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:25,939
It's really good stuff.

152
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,850
What are you doing?
