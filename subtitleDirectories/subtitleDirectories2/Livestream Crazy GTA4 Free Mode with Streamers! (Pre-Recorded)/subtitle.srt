1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:10,199
Friends, let's make sure we get you in here. If you like the game, the rest of you guys

2
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:11,039
should be in here.

3
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,160
Um, it's starting. Should we start it? It's starting. Oh, it's already starting.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,399
Alright, so we got about seven people. I think I can still join.

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,420
Yeah, but you can still join. So if you go to GTA Free mode and you find our game,

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,379
that's where we all are.

7
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:30,440
Alright, what am I gonna do? First of all, get out of that car. Give me that car!

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:38,689
Alright, nice. Nice. Oh, dude!

9
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:44,509
I didn't know it was gonna be that long. Alright, everyone's just like

10
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,009
killing each other.

11
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:52,420
I was expecting like a little more... Oh my god! Chaos!

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,130
Alright, somebody get in the car with me.

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:03,219
Alliance. Alright, I absolutely do not want to be in a...

14
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,700
Oh, go on, Bob, get in!

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,069
Oh my god, it's total chaos!

16
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:10,819
Oh my god!

17
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:18,620
Alright, everybody in, everybody in.

18
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,700
Alright, let's go.

19
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,260
Oh my gosh.

20
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,640
I don't even know who this guy's shooting at, but...

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,209
Oh, it's the French guy left.

22
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:39,739
So, what is it? Everybody versus MLC stealth? Death is happening right now?

23
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,909
Oh my god!

24
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:47,069
Hey, you guys are my assassins. You gotta take out MLC stealth.

25
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,269
What are you doing?

26
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:51,849
You just glitched out of the car.

27
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:55,180
Oh my god, everyone's like glitching.

28
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,750
Alright, hissing gem.

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,010
We're gonna do a wraparound here.

30
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,969
Oh no.

31
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:06,469
Oh, cops. Cops.

32
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:09,000
Take them out.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,689
Alright, where is everybody?

34
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:14,080
Oh, this car's stalled.

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,419
It's not stalled, it just doesn't have tires.

36
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:19,780
Alliance, broken.

37
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,520
Alliance, broken.

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,759
Alright, let's do...

39
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,919
Alright, you guys wanna...

40
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,879
You guys wanna actually do something?

41
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,360
We should actually do something.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,139
Looks like do something.

43
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,740
Shibby wants to chat.

44
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,960
He sent me one of those, too.

45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,930
Uh-oh.

46
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,090
Where are...

47
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,770
We're streaming. Can you just...

48
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,530
Oh, you can't alt-tab. We can't alt-tab. Oh no.

49
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,930
We can enter his group chat.

50
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,969
And then tell him we're streaming. Hold on, let me do that.

51
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:52,909
Yeah, just do that. Tell him we're streaming.

52
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:55,479
Hello, Shibby. Is it...

53
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,680
Me and Jerma be streaming.

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,319
Alright, who's behind me right now?

55
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,240
Who's in this car?

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,789
You guys are in both.

57
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:10,930
Alright, c'mere, c'mere. Let me get in this car.

58
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,699
Let me get in this baby.

59
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,949
Oh, I love how there's no door.

60
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:20,150
Let me just get in like it's a milk truck.

61
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,599
Who's in the...

62
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,180
I love how Burger Boy's just in an ambulance.

63
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,219
Or what is that? Was it an ambulance or a fire truck?

64
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:31,969
I don't really remember.

65
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:35,199
Alright, let's... Hey, let's go get a...

66
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,460
Let's go get a helicopter.

67
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,800
Let's go grab a heli.

68
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,439
Oh my god.

69
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,969
What are you doing?

70
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,680
I'm just gonna sit here.

71
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't have to go anywhere.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,930
I can just... Oh my god.

73
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,120
Oh no, he's shooting at me.

74
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,599
That chick killed you.

75
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,199
No, I'm like sitting on top of her with my car.

76
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,580
Oh, she's not having any of that.

77
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,389
Officer, I can't believe what's happening here.

78
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:07,509
I'll be a good guy.

79
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:08,870
Hey, officer, c'mere for a second.

80
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,870
Can I like look at your gun? Can I just...

81
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,459
I just saw you wave by.

82
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,110
Oh, you're gonna bring a gun to a point... Oh, c'mon.

83
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,730
You're gonna bring a gun.

84
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,519
Alright, Burger Boy, where are you?

85
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,410
I wanna get in your car.

86
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,329
Who's the pink? Who's the pink blip?

87
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:35,170
Oh, it's this dude, alright.

88
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,970
He's being chased by police.

89
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:42,240
Let me get in your whip.

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,920
No!

91
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,399
You wanna shoot out? That's what you got.

92
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,810
I'm taking your car, too.

93
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,910
I'm taking this thing to a dealer and I'm selling it.

94
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,790
Oh god, there he is.

95
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:01,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,079
I want everybody...

97
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,560
Everybody to...

98
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,399
MLC City, it's there, it's there.

99
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,600
So everybody come to me on the map.

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,920
My car is very destroyed right now.

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,480
Everybody come to me on the map.

102
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,959
My car doesn't have any doors on it.

103
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,649
Look at my car.

104
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,839
Nobody kill each other.

105
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,120
Everybody come to where me and MLC City are right now.

106
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,560
The brown blip and the...

107
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,470
What color am I?

108
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,120
I'm orange, I think.

109
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,800
Ah, this cop wants me dead.

110
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,560
I'm gonna let him kill me.

111
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,240
I have no health.

112
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,519
If you guys come to the blip,

113
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,720
I wanna try something.

114
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,199
I wanna see if we can make something weird happen right now.

115
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,040
Will you just kill me or what?

116
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,600
Is that cop shooting at me?

117
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,480
Oh, he is.

118
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,000
What?

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,240
Did he just kill me?

120
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,980
Did you just back into me or did that cop shoot me in the face?

121
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,399
He shot you in the face.

122
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,120
Alright, you know what?

123
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,310
Screw this.

124
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,189
Screw this, I don't know.

125
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,339
Look at my statue.

126
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,949
What's it look like?

127
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,000
Is that like a bow?

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,800
What the?

129
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,360
Alright, follow me.

130
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,600
We're going to get a helicopter.

131
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,759
Did you just punch me in the face?

132
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,000
I did, but I was accidental.

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,180
I didn't mean to.

134
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:04,899
Alright, let's go.

135
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:05,740
We gotta get a helicopter.

136
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,500
Hold on.

137
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,660
Look at all these people.

138
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,189
Look at this war going on right here.

139
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:12,509
Where is Burger Boy in all this?

140
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:13,949
Let's go get a helicopter.

141
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,339
These cops are doing a horrible job at regulating the laws.

142
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,300
Okay, we gotta spawn.

143
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,639
We got a spawner.

144
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,680
Don't kill us.

145
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,199
Oh yeah, alright.

146
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,839
He's not gonna kill us.

147
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,720
Alright, come with us.

148
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,959
I get so afraid whenever there's a person in front of us.

149
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,930
Please don't shoot us.

150
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,930
Alright, put your parachute on, everyone.

151
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,990
Yeah, make sure you get your parachutes on.

152
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,389
I love how this just...

153
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,509
There is something going on, like a hundred feet away from us.

154
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:39,069
People are just slaughtering each other.

155
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:41,709
And I feel like it has something to do with Burger Boy.

156
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,720
Oh, we need a car.

157
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,720
We're all just running with parachutes.

158
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,439
Oh, hey cop.

159
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,279
Ooh, get in this thing.

160
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,019
It only has two seats, I think.

161
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:51,579
It's alright though.

162
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,779
Oh my gosh, crazy lady.

163
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,699
What just happened to you?

164
00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:00,750
Look, this guy is out of his mind.

165
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,560
I'm outta here.

166
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,759
That guy's out of his mind.

167
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,649
That guy's out of his mind.

168
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:09,410
That guy hissing is like just killing people left and right.

169
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,490
I'm running away.

170
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,490
Oh, on our team?

171
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,490
Or not team?

172
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,170
I just saw him like putting out everybody that was in a driver's seat in a car that

173
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,560
was next to us.

174
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm going to get a helicopter.

175
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,560
Oh my god, this thing handles like...

176
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Where are you driving?

177
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,629
I...

178
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:25,629
I have it on my GPS.

179
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:31,540
I just bought my GPS from Walgreens.

180
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,540
I have cops on me?

181
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,100
No, I don't.

182
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,920
I guess I do.

183
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,009
Alright.

184
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:40,009
Look at this.

185
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,170
Look at these people just killing each other.

186
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,529
I'm going to get a helicopter and then it's going to be game over.

187
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,060
Again, I'm going way too fast.

188
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,819
This always ends very badly.

189
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:50,899
Anytime I go this fast, it never ends well.

190
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,250
Ever.

191
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,529
You never like find like a nice safe jump to go off of.

192
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:55,529
Oh, here we go.

193
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:56,529
Out of control.

194
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:01,680
Out of control.

195
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Why did I do that?

196
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,110
There was no reason to do that.

197
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,800
I'm okay.

198
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,160
The cops are still behind me.

199
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,759
Dude, I felt like I was just on a bike.

200
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,120
Alright, I gotta add this guy so we can get in.

201
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Jacob Watson.

202
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,480
Absolutely.

203
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,660
Come on in, man.

204
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,350
Come on in the game.

205
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,720
Oh, my god.

206
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Oh my god.

207
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,129
No!

208
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,129
Get away from me!

209
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:27,310
Oh.

210
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,480
Oh.

211
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Oh, Jacob's in.

212
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,090
Is he?

213
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,960
Who is singing right now?

214
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,850
Who is singing?

215
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,850
Wait.

216
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,690
What is that?

217
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,690
How come there's like people talking?

218
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,690
Oh my gosh.

219
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,690
Alright, let's go.

220
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,929
Burger Boy, get in.

221
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:56,929
Oh, it's Burger Boy.

222
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:57,929
Burger Boy, get in.

223
00:08:57,929 --> 00:08:58,929
Quick.

224
00:08:58,929 --> 00:08:59,929
Alright.

225
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:01,169
Is that cop just shot one of us?

226
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:02,169
Okay, which way are we going?

227
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:03,169
We're going to get a helicopter.

228
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:06,480
Is it off this cliff right here?

229
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Okay.

230
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,039
Alright.

231
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,659
I'll be the navigator.

232
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:11,659
Go straight.

233
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:13,659
Go straight until you can't go straight anymore.

234
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:20,480
Burger Boy, I love how you were in an ambulance just like driving a hundred miles per hour.

235
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:23,269
One of our tires is blown.

236
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,110
It's going to end very poorly.

237
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,110
Alright.

238
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,110
Don't like drive us into a cliff.

239
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,370
There we go.

240
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,440
Why did you get out?

241
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
They're so far away.

242
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,679
Alright, so still.

243
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,679
Ready at the count of three?

244
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,679
I know where we're going.

245
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,919
We're going to...

246
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,919
Oh, you know where we're going.

247
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,919
You're taking us to like the...

248
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,919
What just happened?

249
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,919
I love how I'm in the back.

250
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,919
I'm your chauffeur.

251
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,100
Alright.

252
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,110
Just take...

253
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,110
I'm getting out.

254
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,370
I'm getting out.

255
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,370
I don't trust you.

256
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,549
No.

257
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,549
What?

258
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:53,549
I don't trust you.

259
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:54,549
No, no.

260
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:55,549
Get in.

261
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:56,919
I thought you were just going to drive off the edge.

262
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,919
Alright.

263
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,210
Alright.

264
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,210
Okay.

265
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,460
Go.

266
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,460
I don't even have like my headphones plugged in.

267
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,460
People...

268
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,889
You guys are probably like...

269
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:10,889
Oh my...

270
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:12,519
What?

271
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,039
What?

272
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,039
Oh my god.

273
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,039
Oh my god.

274
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,039
It's hissing gems.

275
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,409
Get them.

276
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:21,409
Get them.

277
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:22,409
What an intense shootout this is.

278
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:23,409
No!

279
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:24,409
That guy is not having a good day today.

280
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:25,409
He just wants...

281
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:26,409
Everyone's shooting each other.

282
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:27,409
I got to plug my headphones in.

283
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,379
Because I think I might be reverbing.

284
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,399
Because I was just too excited to play.

285
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,399
Where are my headphones?

286
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,210
I got to find them.

287
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,210
Everyone just wants everyone dead.

288
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:46,960
I think about it every night and day.

289
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Bring my wings and fly away.

290
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,200
I believe I can soar.

291
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,710
I see you running through that open door.

292
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,710
Oh god.

293
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,200
Did I crash?

294
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Oh no!

295
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
I crashed!

296
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,960
No I didn't.

297
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
No I didn't.

298
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,220
I'm good.

299
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,509
I'm here.

300
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:10,509
I thought I crashed.

301
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:14,100
But I'm good.

302
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
Oh I got to get my headphones on.

303
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Alright.

304
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
We're good to go.

305
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
We're good to go.

306
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,610
So everyone's in the airport.

307
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,610
Now it's pretty much just a race to who gets the helicopters.

308
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,610
Sorry.

309
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,559
I'm sorry.

310
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,289
Operation Dodge.

311
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,289
Oh give me this P90.

312
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,600
Oh man.

313
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,039
It is a sad day for anybody coming close to me.

314
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,070
Alright.

315
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,370
I'm safe.

316
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,370
You know what?

317
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,190
I got to get a car.

318
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,190
I got to get a cup.

319
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,190
Hey.

320
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,070
How you doing?

321
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,070
Please don't kill me.

322
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,009
Okay.

323
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:54,009
He ran by me.

324
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:55,009
Good.

325
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:56,009
Hey.

326
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:57,649
This guy's idea of fun is getting inside the helicopter and shooting all the other helicopters

327
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:58,649
so nobody else can get in.

328
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:00,929
Oh you piece of crap.

329
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,620
Alright.

330
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,399
Operation take out the guy in the helicopter.

331
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,080
Operation take out helicopter flyer.

332
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,769
Operation rocket launcher and dispose of.

333
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:13,769
I got in the helicopter.

334
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:18,850
I'm going to get over there.

335
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,159
I'm on my way.

336
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,379
I'm en route.

337
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,840
Break that window.

338
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,440
Oh this brings back memories when I smashed my face on that guy.

339
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,809
He's not even moving.

340
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:31,120
What is that guy doing?

341
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,470
Wait.

342
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,029
What?

343
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,029
Where am I going?

344
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:38,029
Aren't the helicopters...

345
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:41,570
Oh they're right there.

346
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,570
They're right there.

347
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,570
Sorry for the...

348
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,580
It's a good tactic man.

349
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,580
That's alright.

350
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,519
Alright.

351
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,960
Who thinks I'm going to make it underneath this plane?

352
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,330
I do.

353
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,330
Woo hoo.

354
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,389
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me a helicopter.

355
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:01,519
Please don't die.

356
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,519
I am so addicted to...

357
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,080
Oh my god.

358
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
Oh my god.

359
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Oh my god.

360
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Oh my god.

361
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Oh my god.

362
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,639
Oh my god.

363
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,769
I need to crouch.

364
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:15,230
How do I crouch?

365
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,230
Oh my god.

366
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,919
What a psycho.

367
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,919
What a psycho.

368
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,240
What is he doing?

369
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,870
What are you doing?

370
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,490
My helicopter.

371
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,490
What is happening to it?

372
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,490
Why can't it just stay flying?

373
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,490
What the...

374
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,690
Are you in a helicopter?

375
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,690
Where are you?

376
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,789
Hey dude.

377
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:34,789
Stop crouching.

378
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:35,789
Run.

379
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:36,789
All these helicopters are destroyed.

380
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:41,289
Oh dear god.

381
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:42,289
This is bad.

382
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,659
This is so bad.

383
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,090
I'm going to die the second I get into this.

384
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,649
Oh run away.

385
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:47,649
I'm not even going to go in that dude.

386
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:48,649
I'm going to die the second I get in there.

387
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,720
Oh my god.

388
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
I'm still alive.

389
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,090
It's my chance.

390
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,090
It's my chance.

391
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,090
Get in.

392
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,090
Get in.

393
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,120
Get in.

394
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Get in.

395
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Go.

396
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,429
Go you slug.

397
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:03,669
Oh yeah.

398
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:05,100
It's time for copter wars.

399
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
Oh my god.

400
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
No.

401
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,470
No.

402
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,470
No.

403
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,159
Get up.

404
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,159
Oh that was...

405
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:18,000
I just really had a heart attack.

406
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Those helicopters suck.

407
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,690
Oh my god.

408
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,690
Oh my god.

409
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,690
Oh my god.

410
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,320
Oh my god.

411
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,940
Those helicopters suck for being a helicopter.

412
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,940
Alright I'm good.

413
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,690
This just sucks.

414
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,639
I'm good.

415
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,639
I'm alright.

416
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,639
Yeah what's going on?

417
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,259
I feel like I'm driving a...

418
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:38,379
Alright let me aim it down to the ground.

419
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,059
Any unsuspecting people I can smash into?

420
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:44,899
There's cops down there.

421
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:45,899
Barrage.

422
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,519
Unleash the fury.

423
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,759
Ah.

424
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,840
I'm not killing anybody.

425
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,139
You know what?

426
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:54,139
I'm going kamikaze.

427
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:55,639
Oh my god.

428
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,320
Whoever this pink dot is.

429
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
You picked a bad day to be a pink dot.

430
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
You picked a bad day to be a pink...

431
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Oh I'm going to throw up dude.

432
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Really.

433
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,940
I'm really going to puke.

434
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,009
Did like the controls change or is this lag?

435
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,379
Oh no.

436
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:17,320
How did I...

437
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
But I'm like 4 but flying is...

438
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:28,139
Well that's how we get out of a helicopter and walk off the front and...

439
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,759
Hey come pick me up.

440
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,840
Alright.

441
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Oh my god.

442
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,970
I think papa got a brand new bag here.

443
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:44,840
No.

444
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:50,409
I'm such a bad shot.

445
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,100
I was like landing.

446
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,340
Oh you were trying to pick me up?

447
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,350
Oh I'm sorry.

448
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,350
I thought you were like...

449
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,350
You were shooting missiles at me.

450
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,350
I was scared.

451
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,350
Because you shot a rocket at me.

452
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:07,000
Alright.

453
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm conserving the rest of this ammo.

454
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,370
Let's get out of here.

455
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,370
We're like being shot at to death.

456
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,080
If that killed me I was going to be so angry.

457
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Everyone just spawns and pulls out pistols and you just start shooting each other.

458
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,600
This is so like unorganized.

459
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,159
I'm going to kill this guy.

460
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,299
Oh no.

461
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:29,299
Get him.

462
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:30,299
Get him.

463
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:36,490
Oh I could have sworn.

464
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,490
Do I blame Tom Brady or anybody for Wes Welker?

465
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,419
No.

466
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:43,419
I mean the Patriots didn't really have that.

467
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,919
It was a pretty much string of luck that they got into the playoffs to begin with.

468
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:50,690
Good to see them get that far.

469
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,690
But yeah go Celtics.

470
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,690
That's all I got to say.

471
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,070
Alright where's Burger Boy?

472
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,399
Burger Boy is the number one target for me.

473
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,399
I think he is...

474
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,399
No you're brown.

475
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,700
You're brown.

476
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,519
He's green.

477
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,160
You're orange.

478
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,980
Alright so stream Burger Boy is target number one.

479
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
Look at how mad he is.

480
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
Look at how mad he is.

481
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,220
I want the whole stream.

482
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,220
Let's see if we can make him rage quit.

483
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,970
You guys suck.

484
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:27,049
For some reason I want to save Cordobomb.

485
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,049
Get in.

486
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:29,049
Get in Burger Boy.

487
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,230
We're making it out of here alive.

488
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,069
Get in Cordobomb.

489
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:36,880
Me and Burger Boy are going to escape.

490
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,250
I actually you know Burger Boy.

491
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,799
Oh no.

492
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,799
Oh no.

493
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,799
Oh I got the P90 man.

494
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,359
How is he?

495
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:49,039
I just unloaded 70 bullets into that guy.

496
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,410
What a champion.

497
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,720
So are we still having a war against Burger Boy?

498
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
It doesn't seem like that.

499
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
I'm trying to get in a helicopter.

500
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,210
I say we I mean you guys.

501
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,519
Oh my god.

502
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,519
Stay with it.

503
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,329
What was that?

504
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:06,849
What on earth was that?

505
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:07,849
That was ridiculous.

506
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:08,849
Was that a rocket?

507
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:10,730
Holy crap.

508
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh no I want to live.

509
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,240
I want to live.

510
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,549
Get me on like the Italian scooter.

511
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,789
Sick drivings.

512
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:26,799
Oh here we go.

513
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,799
Get me on this bike.

514
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,799
Burger Boy you want to get in some helicopters?

515
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,569
God ball.

516
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,900
Oh no.

517
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,900
The stream is counting my deaths.

518
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,589
I'm up to 11.

519
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:41,470
Where'd you go?

520
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,309
Where are you?

521
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:48,170
Try Burger Boy.

522
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,170
Hey get on this bike.

523
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,559
That's a place I don't want to be at.

524
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,380
Let me get in with you Burger.

525
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,259
Hey wait I would enjoy the fun too.

526
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:00,269
There's another helicopter.

527
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:01,269
You can't get in.

528
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:03,269
I'm trying to hit my head on the blades.

529
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:06,710
Oh hey let me just get in this helicopter.

530
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,710
Like hit my face on the blades.

531
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,710
Just go go go go go go go go.

532
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,710
Go without me.

533
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,710
We got a boat.

534
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,710
Oh my god.

535
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,079
I'm getting out of this.

536
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:21,880
Burger Boy that's going to blow up.

537
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
That's going to blow up.

538
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
What are you doing still driving?

539
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,640
RPG watch out.

540
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:47,089
That was so perfect.

541
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:51,779
Oh my god thank god this is being recorded.

542
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:57,150
Because if I didn't get that on tape I would have been so bad at myself.

543
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,390
Look how destroyed he just got.

544
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:07,339
He was like trying so hard to stay alive.

545
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,339
And he just died.

546
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,960
You can see like the intensity in his like jump out.

547
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,289
Hold on Burger Boy.

548
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:17,289
Oh my face.

549
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:19,289
Hey let me get in that car with you Burger Boy.

550
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:22,299
Alright Jacob let me get on the back of that scooter.

551
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:25,049
Oh you bastard.

552
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:28,640
I was trying to get on the back.

553
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:35,359
Everybody that got to see that.

554
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,359
That was one of the funniest things I've seen.

555
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,849
Alright let's go.

556
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:39,849
Oh wait.

557
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:40,849
Alright get in.

558
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:43,049
Get in.

559
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,049
Get in the car.

560
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,049
Get in the car.

561
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:46,049
Get in the car quick.

562
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:49,599
Alright who's...

563
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,599
Oh the cop's on you.

564
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,410
Okay.

565
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,549
Let's go back to the airfield.

566
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:55,549
Oh man.

567
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:57,359
Look at this guy.

568
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,359
That guy just got robbed by a cop.

569
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,599
We almost sandwiched that dude.

570
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,460
Let's move.

571
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Alright let's get in this helicopter.

572
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,720
Oh look at that perfect pull up.

573
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,329
I got a feeling this guy might turn into a traitor.

574
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:27,329
I don't know.

575
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:28,759
I'm scared.

576
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:29,759
Oh my god.

577
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,759
Did you just run into the helicopter?

578
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,759
Alright get in.

579
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,759
Oh you flipped it.

580
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,759
You flipped it.

581
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,200
You flipped it.

582
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Let me like flip it back.

583
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Can I like get back in?

584
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,759
I'm going the other way.

585
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,759
Go away.

586
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,250
Go away.

587
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,250
These cops are on me.

588
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,250
Get...

589
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,250
No I'm going to die from the police.

590
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,029
Damn it.

591
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:53,930
Damn it.

592
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,240
Damn it.

593
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,440
Damn it.

594
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Helicopters.

595
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
I was trying to...

596
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,200
Can you like get in and flip it over?

597
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,700
I want to get in the helicopter and I want to just peacefully just fly down, watch some

598
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,700
TV, read a book when I'm parachuting down.

599
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,900
That's all I want.

600
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,900
That's all I care about.

601
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,900
I just want to parachute out of the helicopter.

602
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,609
That's all I want to do.

603
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:22,609
Let me aim out this window.

604
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:23,609
Get out of town.

605
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,069
Oh my god.

606
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:27,069
That guy's a shotgun.

607
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:28,069
You pulled up in front of the guy with the shotgun.

608
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:30,200
Oh that's more...

609
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,759
Chaos.

610
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,259
Pure chaos.

611
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:35,440
All right get us to the airfield quick.

612
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,809
We got people, we got bogeys on us.

613
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:41,809
What's going on?

614
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:42,809
He's pulling me out of the car.

615
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:54,609
He is pulling me out of the car right now.

616
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:58,450
Gourd bomb, let me in.

617
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,079
I'm leaving you guys.

618
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,079
I'm getting the hell out of here.

619
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,319
Thanks burger boy.

620
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,319
Appreciate that.

621
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,319
All right get in.

622
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,579
Hurry up.

623
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:09,579
Hurry up.

624
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:10,579
Hurry up.

625
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:13,549
Oh my god.

626
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:16,069
They are unloading on us.

627
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:17,069
Geez.

628
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:19,079
I love how this is just a race.

629
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:23,490
This is just who can get in the helicopter.

630
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,490
What is that cop doing?

631
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,490
Freak.

632
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,519
He's a bad guy.

633
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,519
He's aiming his gun at us.

634
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,519
Oh man look at this chaos.

635
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,519
We got a fight going on over here boys.

636
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:36,089
He's got an RPG doesn't he?

637
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:37,779
I'm getting out of there now.

638
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:38,779
Oh wait burger boy you're dead?

639
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:40,779
I'm like sitting in the car with you.

640
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:41,779
Who killed you?

641
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:48,119
All right we're at the airfield waiting for a spawn.

642
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,119
Come on.

643
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,609
Come on.

644
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:51,609
Spawn a copter.

645
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:52,609
They're not in the air are they?

646
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:53,849
Oh man.

647
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,670
Everyone really likes shooting.

648
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,670
Nobody just wants to run cars into each other.

649
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,700
Where are these helicopters?

650
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,029
I'm taking cover behind.

651
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:08,029
I know someone's going to come and just smash into us.

652
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:12,599
Oh yeah.

653
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:16,779
Take the cover.

654
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:17,779
I'm stuck on the door right now.

655
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:19,339
Oh man.

656
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:20,339
Oh man.

657
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:21,579
Oh man.

658
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:24,099
Oh man.

659
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:25,099
Oh no.

660
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,099
No.

661
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:27,099
No.

662
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,470
All right.

663
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,470
At least I would have died from that explosion.

664
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,029
If I didn't die from that explosion I would have died from the...

665
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:32,029
You know what?

666
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:33,029
I'm going this way.

667
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:34,029
There's police helicopters here.

668
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:35,519
I got a plan.

669
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,200
You know I have a plan and it's going to work.

670
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Oh it is absolutely going to work.

671
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,630
Maybe it won't.

672
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,980
Probably not.

673
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
Run.

674
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,980
Run.

675
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,559
I'll take the cop car.

676
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,869
I'll take the cop car.

677
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:52,869
For those of you asking in the stream this is Episodes from Liberty City.

678
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:55,490
It's the expansion of GTA IV.

679
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,730
We're playing the Ballad of Gay Tony.

680
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,730
And if you want to join...

681
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,730
Did you just see that helicopter crash?

682
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,109
That was...

683
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,109
Who is in this helicopter is the real question.

684
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:13,130
So if you want to join, my name on here is Jermaw with four A's.

685
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,130
And just join the game I'm in once you send a friend request.

686
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,809
You should be able to.

687
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:21,809
L-C-P-D.

688
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:24,049
Oh my goodness.

689
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:28,400
That is a missile coming at us.

690
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,279
I'm getting out.

691
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,279
Of course I have three stars.

692
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,279
Fantastic.

693
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:36,640
Alright let's set up shop here.

694
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,450
I'm going to add Zeus.

695
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,839
Where are you Zeus?

696
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,839
Oh my god.

697
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:51,019
I'm in the middle of inviting somebody to the game and I just hear a crash and you're

698
00:25:51,019 --> 00:26:01,160
next to me.

699
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,609
Okay.

700
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:04,609
What am I doing?

701
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:05,980
I'm just like creeping.

702
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,880
Now I'm waiting for a copter.

703
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
I'm waiting for a helicopter.

704
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,599
There's no way I'm going to get it.

705
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,599
Oh my god.

706
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,799
Alright I'm getting in.

707
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:20,420
Look at all these people everywhere.

708
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,420
I'm going to do plan B. Look at the mini map.

709
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,420
Look at how many police are here.

710
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,420
Look at the mini map.

711
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,660
Look at the mini map.

712
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,960
That's ridiculous.

713
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,589
There's a lot of them.

714
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:30,589
Oh I just barely.

715
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,920
I just barely almost got in there.

716
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,670
Alright new plan.

717
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,700
I'm doing plan B.

718
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
I am absolutely.

719
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
What was plan B?

720
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,309
Plan B is to go get the helicopter.

721
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,740
Oh here comes the SWAT team.

722
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,740
Good thing they're not coming after me.

723
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,559
How tall.

724
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,440
Somebody's already doing plan B.

725
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,680
Somebody's already doing plan B.

726
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,849
What did he say it was?

727
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:59,930
To go base jump and go float over here.

728
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,359
Who is this?

729
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,359
Is nobody even in here?

730
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:05,140
I'm taking this.

731
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,569
Give me that.

732
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:07,569
Give it to me.

733
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:09,579
Get out of there.

734
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:11,140
Oh man that was bad.

735
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,140
I'm sorry Mr. Ambulance Driver.

736
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,140
You just try to help people.

737
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,140
I'm such a bad person.

738
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,980
I'm sorry.

739
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,650
Alright turn that off.

740
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:22,650
That's going to get annoying.

741
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,529
Alright let's see.

742
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:27,089
I need to go right here.

743
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:29,480
Why am I flipped over?

744
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,660
I just rammed you.

745
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,660
What?

746
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,660
You're on fire.

747
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,660
Oh my god you're on fire.

748
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,660
You're on fire.

749
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,089
You're on fire.

750
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,089
No.

751
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,970
Get away from that car.

752
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,529
Give me this one.

753
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:43,440
No.

754
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
Give me this.

755
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Alright.

756
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,000
Did I get him?

757
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
No I didn't.

758
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,619
Come here.

759
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,440
Come here.

760
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,339
This dude's lagging.

761
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,640
I got away.

762
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Alright.

763
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
Let's see if the plan works.

764
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,910
Come pick me up.

765
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,910
Turn around.

766
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:04,069
Alright.

767
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:05,069
Come here.

768
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:07,200
I wasn't going to run into you.

769
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,700
I promise.

770
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
I'm in the back seat.

771
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,700
Alright.

772
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,349
Driving Miss Daisy.

773
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:14,349
Driving Miss Stealth.

774
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:18,019
Hopefully this building is tall enough so we can base jump off of it and fly into the

775
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:20,920
action.

776
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,289
That's a right hand.

777
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:25,009
Oh jeez.

778
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:27,349
Please exit the vehicle and watch your hands and feet.

779
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:29,829
Thank you for riding in German the worst car driver in the world.

780
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:32,480
Thank you so much.

781
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,359
No don't shoot me.

782
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,359
Oh you're going to blow it up.

783
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,529
I see.

784
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:37,529
I see.

785
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:38,529
No I'm shooting all the tires.

786
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:39,529
Woodadelic this will be on YouTube.

787
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:40,710
It will.

788
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,470
The whole thing will be on YouTube.

789
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,730
Probably tomorrow.

790
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,730
Alright.

791
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,759
We're going to get a new car.

792
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:52,630
We need a new car.

793
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,630
Somebody's already doing the parachute.

794
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,630
Where are the cars?

795
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,869
I found a motorcycle.

796
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:58,710
Oh jeez.

797
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,119
Is this the guy?

798
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,809
Why is he...

799
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:04,809
Oh get this guy.

800
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:05,809
Shoot him.

801
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,970
Shoot this guy.

802
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:12,440
Shoot him.

803
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Kill him.

804
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,210
Kill him.

805
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,440
Kill him.

806
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,849
Alright.

807
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:23,630
I'm right there.

808
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,630
We're right here.

809
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,630
Oh here's the guy that was shooting us.

810
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,630
Let's back into him.

811
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,380
Argh.

812
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,380
Argh.

813
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:35,609
I will run you over as many times as I have to.

814
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,880
Hahaha.

815
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
Alright.

816
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
Let's uh...

817
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,200
I'm getting out of here.

818
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
I'm going to do that base jump.

819
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,900
It's going to happen.

820
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,650
Corner.

821
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,039
Here we go.

822
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,039
Oh this is a really small building.

823
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,990
This is going to...

824
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,990
Is there a taxi I can call?

825
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,160
Actually that's not that small.

826
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,400
I don't think they have taxis in...

827
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,710
Aww.

828
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,200
Dude.

829
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,759
Hurry hurry hurry.

830
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,839
Alright.

831
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:06,839
How high up am I?

832
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,279
Pretty damn high.

833
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,279
Alright.

834
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,089
Where's the action going on?

835
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:13,720
Over here.

836
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
So I've got to jump off this side.

837
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,529
And...

838
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:17,529
Let's go.

839
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:19,670
Open.

840
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,700
Open.

841
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
Alright.

842
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,319
Let's see if I can like...

843
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,319
Float into the madness.

844
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,319
That guy's a helicopter.

845
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:29,779
Float on the helicopter, boy.

846
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:30,779
Woohoo.

847
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:31,779
I'm sure that'll be pretty easy.

848
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:33,339
Ah.

849
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:36,990
Look at how relaxing this is.

850
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,990
Just floating around.

851
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,990
Relaxing with my friends.

852
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,700
Oh hey stealth.

853
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,940
I made it.

854
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,819
That was fun.

855
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:46,819
Woohoo.

856
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:50,579
Let's go do that again.

857
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:51,579
Except this time.

858
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,119
I want to get on this.

859
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,119
I want to get on the bike.

860
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,029
I want to get on the bike.

861
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:58,029
I...

862
00:30:58,029 --> 00:30:59,029
I'm trying to...

863
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,029
I just flew.

864
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:01,269
What?

865
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:02,269
These are right next to me.

866
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:03,269
What?

867
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:06,680
This guy got...

868
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
This guy...

869
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,279
He was still in the riding position.

870
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:13,359
He jumped up and he was like, oh nothing's going on here, I'm just like still riding

871
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,819
the bike.

872
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:16,819
What the hell was that?

873
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:23,349
Oh I love how many glitches are in this game.

874
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,519
Oh jeez.

875
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,519
Oh my god.

876
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,519
I can't control it.

877
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,400
Who wants to play baseball?

878
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,339
We've got enough people to play baseball.

879
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:33,339
We've got like...

880
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:34,779
There's enough people in here.

881
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:36,279
Alright, I'm going to be the pitcher.

882
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:38,279
I'll be the batter.

883
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,609
Let's play grenade baseball.

884
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:46,089
Do we have any grenades?

885
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:47,089
I'm the batter.

886
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:48,089
Alright, ready?

887
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:49,329
Ready.

888
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:50,329
So I'm going to throw the ball.

889
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:52,210
Alright, did you hit it?

890
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,210
Oh I hit it.

891
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,210
Boom.

892
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,210
Oh look at...

893
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,210
Wow.

894
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,210
It went so far.

895
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,210
Look at how far it went.

896
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,210
Around first base.

897
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,210
Go to second.

898
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,210
Oh no.

899
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,769
I got to throw him out.

900
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:03,769
Oh I didn't get him.

901
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:04,769
Oh no.

902
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:05,769
The ball got thrown in.

903
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:06,769
Oh he's still safe.

904
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:08,400
Here you are.

905
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
You got a triple.

906
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,569
You got a triple.

907
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:12,009
Alright.

908
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:13,009
Ghost man on third.

909
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:14,009
Oh okay.

910
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:15,009
Wait.

911
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:16,250
No.

912
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,250
No.

913
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,250
No.

914
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,250
You have to leave the car.

915
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,250
Oh.

916
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,559
But it's a ghost man.

917
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,559
Yeah.

918
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,970
But then you have to get in the car and drive to home plate.

919
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:28,279
So you get over there.

920
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,279
So you get over...

921
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,599
Someone in the stream just wrote, the crowd goes wild.

922
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,970
Alright.

923
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,470
So here we go.

924
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,470
Ready?

925
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,640
I pitched it.

926
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
Alright.

927
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,950
Now go run to first base.

928
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,950
Oh.

929
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,319
Missed.

930
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,319
Oh god.

931
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:45,069
There's another guy here.

932
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:46,069
We're playing baseball, dude.

933
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:47,069
Oh it's Zeus.

934
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:48,829
Oh yeah.

935
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:49,829
We're playing baseball.

936
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:51,710
Do you want to play baseball?

937
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,710
Alright.

938
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,710
My runner got home.

939
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,079
I got a single.

940
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,079
Zeus, you're up.

941
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:58,980
Alright.

942
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,980
Baseball is over.

943
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,980
I win.

944
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,519
Because you didn't get home.

945
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,519
What's my...

946
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,519
What do I win?

947
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:08,720
I just shot you in the toe.

948
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Alright.

949
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,160
Run home.

950
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,609
To your real home.

951
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:14,609
What?

952
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:15,609
Is that a Bad News Bears joke?

953
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:18,710
Alright.

954
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,400
Hey.

955
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,470
Oh.

956
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,369
Let's get in the tanker.

957
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:26,369
Let's get in the tanker.

958
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:27,369
Please tell me those explode.

959
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:28,369
Please tell me those.

960
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:29,369
Please tell me.

961
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:31,700
No.

962
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,700
No.

963
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,460
Don't shoot it.

964
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,460
Don't shoot it.

965
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,460
Is it connected?

966
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,460
No.

967
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,460
It's not connected.

968
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,829
I don't even think we can connect it.

969
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:40,829
This is on GTA San Andreas.

970
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:42,769
They definitely explode though.

971
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:43,769
For sure.

972
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:45,910
Oh.

973
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,400
Let's see if I can connect them.

974
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Nah.

975
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,579
You can't connect them.

976
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:50,579
This is going to be a massive...

977
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:53,289
You're going to die.

978
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:54,289
You're going to die in like two seconds.

979
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:55,289
The fire is gone.

980
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:56,289
Oh my god.

981
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:58,109
Look at this.

982
00:33:58,109 --> 00:33:59,109
Burger Boy to save the day.

983
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:00,480
He did...

984
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,680
Wow.

985
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,170
What a pro.

986
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:11,429
Let me get in.

987
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,429
No.

988
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,429
I want to get in this.

989
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,760
No.

990
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Dude.

991
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,960
He just flipped.

992
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,719
He just flipped that car.

993
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,079
That's like a five million pound car.

994
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,690
And he just like flipped it over.

995
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:32,210
I still have my parachute, right?

996
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,210
I hope so.

997
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:39,210
I love how you just came out of nowhere Burger Boy.

998
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,730
That was like amazing.

999
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:48,280
I can't believe that thing flipped my anchor.

1000
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
That's why I laughed so hard.

1001
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,269
Oh Burger Boy.

1002
00:34:54,269 --> 00:34:55,269
You're going to waste all your ammo.

1003
00:34:55,269 --> 00:34:56,760
All right.

1004
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Ready?

1005
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,130
Here we go.

1006
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,130
I am going to jump out of the...

1007
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,130
I'm going to parachute.

1008
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,130
I'm going to parachute and see how long I can parachute.

1009
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
So keep coming up.

1010
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,210
Shoot.

1011
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,210
Oh shoot.

1012
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,710
All the people down there.

1013
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,710
Wow.

1014
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,710
We are up really high.

1015
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,710
I think this is as high as we can go.

1016
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,710
Thanks Burger Boy.

1017
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,550
Woohoo.

1018
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,039
Oh yeah.

1019
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,039
Thanks Burger Boy.

1020
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,039
Woohoo.

1021
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:28,159
So I'm going to watch and see where Burger Boy goes.

1022
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,159
So I'll tell you a story while I'm parachuting.

1023
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,110
It's like story time.

1024
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,110
So one time.

1025
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,989
Let's see how long it takes before I can finish this story.

1026
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:39,570
One time I was at Halloween.

1027
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,599
I was having a good time as a Ninja Turtles.

1028
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,000
And the story is really going nowhere.

1029
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:51,940
I just want to try and talk and see how long it takes for me to land.

1030
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,590
Oh more talking.

1031
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,590
I love all these people.

1032
00:35:55,590 --> 00:36:00,159
I feel the same way.

1033
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,159
I feel the same way.

1034
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,869
Whoever was just talking in a different language.

1035
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:04,869
Let's...

1036
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:05,869
Woohoo.

1037
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:07,750
Who is even talking?

1038
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:19,289
I just heard a language I am not familiar with.

1039
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:24,820
Wow.

1040
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,820
So who thinks...

1041
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
Place your bets.

1042
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,239
Am I going to die right now?

1043
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,380
Am I going to die right now when I land?

1044
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,380
We'll find out.

1045
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
Somebody is now chasing me.

1046
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,519
And I have a feeling they are going to take me out.

1047
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,519
Oh it's Bert.

1048
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,519
It's Bert.

1049
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,190

1050
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,190

It's Bert.

1054
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:50,489
It's Bert.

1055
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:52,050
It's Bert.

1056
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,050
It's Bert.

1057
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,050
It's Bert.

1058
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,050
It's Bert.

1059
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,530
It's Bert.

1060
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,530
It's Bert.

1061
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,030
It's Bert.

1062
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,269
It's Bert.

1063
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:03,639
It's Bert.

1064
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,639
It's Bert.

1065
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,639
It's Bert.

1066
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,769
It's Bert.

1067
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:08,769
It's Bert.

1068
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:11,230
It's Bert.

1069
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,659
It's Bert.

1070
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:13,659
It's Bert.

1071
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:14,659
It's Bert.

1072
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:17,309
It's Bert.

1073
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:18,309
It's Bert.

1074
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:21,400
It's Bert.

1075
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,219
It's Bert.

1076
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:24,219
It's Bert.

1077
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:25,219
It's Bert.

1078
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:26,219
It's Bert.

1079
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:27,969
It's Bert.

1080
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:28,969
It's Bert.

1081
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:29,969
It's Bert.

1082
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:30,969
It's Bert.

1083
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:32,340
It's Bert.

1084
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,769

1093
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,059

00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:58,650
It's Bert.

1095
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,650
It's Bert.

1096
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:04,409

1097
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,550

1098
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,750

1104
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,260
It's Bert.

1105
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,840
It's Bert.

1106
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,010
I don't think he died.

1107
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,010
I think he's still alive.

1108
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,510
I thought you killed him.

1109
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,510
Oh, I killed him.

1110
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,030
I'm going way too...

1111
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,639
Why is this?

1112
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:44,599
Dude, can you imagine if you landed from that high up?

1113
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:47,670
If you landed, like, flat on your stomach?

1114
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,849
Dude, your insides would just explode.

1115
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:53,849
Oh, God.

1116
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:54,849
That would be so horrible.

1117
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:57,849
You would not want to be at that crime scene cleaning that up.

1118
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:03,119
What the hell was that?

1119
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,960
That guy just...

1120
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,269
Okay, I'll take the car.

1121
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:12,130
Fine.

1122
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,880
Oh, that guy's got an automatic gun.

1123
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,880
Goodbye.

1124
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,710
All right.

1125
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:27,119
I'm going to play in cinematic mode for the remainder of the game.

1126
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,940
Look at this, like, oh, it's a trailer.

1127
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,940
I wonder how long I can survive.

1128
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:41,380
Oh, my God.

1129
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
I hope everyone in the stream just saw that.

1130
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,369
I was trying to, like, hit you.

1131
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:48,369
Dude, on my screen, you just...

1132
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:50,369
How am I still...

1133
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:57,500
How am I still...

1134
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,500
I can't play this game for more than an hour, man, and my head starts to hurt from laughing

1135
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,190
at, like, the nonsense.

1136
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:06,449
Michael Bay present...

1137
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:07,690
What?

1138
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,690
What the...

1139
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,690
What is that?

1140
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,690
What is this?

1141
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,690
What happened to us?

1142
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,150
What is going on?

1143
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,150
What is going on?

1144
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,150
Why...

1145
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,150
Is there a hacker in here?

1146
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:21,030
Why am I, like, a teddy bear, like, hippopotamus?

1147
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,030
Why...

1148
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,000
Why...

1149
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Why are we, like, a parade float?

1150
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,710
Hey, get in.

1151
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,710
Get in.

1152
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,880
Get in.

1153
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Get in.

1154
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
Get in.

1155
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,829
Get in here.

1156
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:44,719
We got to get another person in this car.

1157
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:46,719
Zeus is right above us.

1158
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:47,719
Zeus, get in this car.

1159
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:53,179
Take the other seat in here.

1160
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:57,179
Somebody please get in here so we can have, like, a sodding can parade float.

1161
00:40:57,179 --> 00:40:58,179
Zeus is trying to land right now.

1162
00:40:58,179 --> 00:40:59,420
Hold on.

1163
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,420
All right, let's just try...

1164
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,420
Oh, jeez.

1165
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,420
He's going out of control.

1166
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,420
Let's just try.

1167
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,239
Let's just try.

1168
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,239
When I turn...

1169
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,179
When I...

1170
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:09,179
All right.

1171
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,179
Before I...

1172
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:13,179
Before I get into uncontrollable laughter.

1173
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:19,480
When I turn, watch the heads go back into the car stalled.

1174
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
All right, get...

1175
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,210
We don't have any weapons.

1176
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,210
Hey, guys, it's Paulie the hippopotamus.

1177
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,210
Let's play Hungry Hungry.

1178
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,210
Let's play Hungry Hungry Hippos.

1179
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,210
Ready?

1180
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,210
Just hit control.

1181
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,210
Come here.

1182
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,210
Come here.

1183
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,210
Wait.

1184
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,210
Come here.

1185
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,210
Come here.

1186
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,210
So I'm going to stand right here.

1187
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,210
You stand opposite me.

1188
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,210
And then just keep hitting control over and over again.

1189
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,210
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

1190
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,280
Ready?

1191
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,679
It's Hungry Hungry Hippos.

1192
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,679
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

1193
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,449
Oh, my God.

1194
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:53,449
Hey, Zeus is right here.

1195
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:54,630
All right, Zeus.

1196
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,869
Oh, Zeus is a normal human.

1197
00:41:55,869 --> 00:41:57,239
Why is he normal?

1198
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,239
He must have died.

1199
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,409
Oh, well.

1200
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:00,409
All right.

1201
00:42:00,409 --> 00:42:01,409
Get in this new car.

1202
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:03,159
Get in this, like, Camry.

1203
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,159
Oh, my God.

1204
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,159
It just pulled up.

1205
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,159
Oh, my God.

1206
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,159
What is happening?

1207
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:10,070
What is...

1208
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,070
How does this happen?

1209
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,239
Are you guys in?

1210
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,239
Look at our heads.

1211
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,239
All right.

1212
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,239
Watch the heads when I turn.

1213
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:16,239
This is the funniest damn thing ever.

1214
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,059
I've got to get some speed.

1215
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:19,059
I've got to get some speed.

1216
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:20,059
I've got to get some speed.

1217
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:21,059
I've got to get some speed.

1218
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:22,059
I've got to get some speed.

1219
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:23,059
Hold on.

1220
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:25,130
Watch the heads.

1221
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,130
Here we go.

1222
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,130
Ready?

1223
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,820
All right.

1224
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,820
Come on.

1225
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,820
Get out of this mode.

1226
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,380
I don't want this mode.

1227
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,070
I want, like, the head mode.

1228
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,070
I don't want to go too fast because...

1229
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,070
Oh, it's the spirit.

1230
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,559
Look at...

1231
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:38,559
Ready?

1232
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:39,739
Oh!

1233
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:40,739
How do I keep glitching out?

1234
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:42,170
I want to see, like, the heads tilt.

1235
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,170
This is the dumbest thing ever.

1236
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,170
How does this happen?

1237
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,199
I don't know.

1238
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:48,199
There must be an advent in here.

1239
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,679
Look at the heads.

1240
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,679
Look.

1241
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:53,860
We look like Barney.

1242
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,860
We look like Barney.

1243
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,289
We look like Barney.

1244
00:42:56,289 --> 00:42:57,289
We look like Barney.

1245
00:42:57,289 --> 00:43:00,449
We look like Barney.

1246
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:03,610
We look like Barney.

1247
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,610
We look like Barney.

1248
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,610
I feel like...

1249
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,840
All right.

1250
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,269
Look at what this looks like right now.

1251
00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:16,269
This looks like America's, like, most wanted videotapes.

1252
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:19,269
And it's like, what kind of criminals are we?

1253
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:20,269
You know what I mean?

1254
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:24,269
Like, look at the criminals driving away in their crazy costumes.

1255
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,269
Like, they're trying to hide their identities.

1256
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:27,440
Wait.

1257
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,440
What button do you press?

1258
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
Cinematic.

1259
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,769
That's V until you get there.

1260
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:33,769
All right.

1261
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:34,769
Here's the real kicker.

1262
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:35,769
Oh, go on automatic control.

1263
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:36,769
All right.

1264
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:38,769
I'm going to laugh uncontrollably at this.

1265
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:39,769
All right, Zeus.

1266
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:40,769
Get in.

1267
00:43:40,769 --> 00:43:41,769
Get in here.

1268
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:42,769
America's most wanted.

1269
00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:43,769
Like, the hungry, hungry hippos.

1270
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:44,769
They robbed a liquor store.

1271
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:45,769
It was like a helicopter like...

1272
00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:46,769
Oh!

1273
00:43:46,769 --> 00:43:47,769
No!

1274
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:48,769
What was...

1275
00:43:48,769 --> 00:43:50,329
Did he just kill us all?

1276
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:51,329
Yeah.

1277
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:53,340
Oh, now I don't have my hungry, hungry hippo head.

1278
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,769
Oh, no.

1279
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:55,769
That was awesome.

1280
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:56,769
Oh, my goodness gracious.

1281
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:57,769
Give us back our hungry, hungry hippos.

1282
00:43:57,769 --> 00:43:58,769
This is so funny.

1283
00:43:58,769 --> 00:43:59,769
I'm going to laugh uncontrollably at this.

1284
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:02,550
All right.

1285
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:03,550
Zeus, get in.

1286
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,559
Get in here.

1287
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,559
America's most wanted.

1288
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:08,440
Like, the hungry, hungry hippos.

1289
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,440
They robbed a liquor store.

1290
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,679
Oh!

1291
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:13,449
What was...

1292
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:15,010
That was so funny.

1293
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:16,190
All right.

1294
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,489
So...

1295
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:18,800
Oh, you should...

1296
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Don't shoot at the tires.

1297
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,800
That's our only vehicle.

1298
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,300
Oh, I think that's a good note to end on, to be honest.

1299
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,300
Seriously, that was...

1300
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,760
I don't know how that happened.

1301
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,360
There was probably an admin in here or something.

1302
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,599
I have no idea, but that was absolutely hysterical.

1303
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,360
Hippo burgers.

1304
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,360
All right.

1305
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,360
Let me get on that bike.

1306
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,360
All right.

1307
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,360
Wait, wait.

1308
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,360
Here's how we're going to end it.

1309
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,360
Oh, my gosh.

1310
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,360
Here's how we're going to end it, guys.

1311
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,360
Ready?

1312
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,360
Everybody.

1313
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,360
Everybody get into where we're standing right now.

1314
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,800
Boxing match.

1315
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,480
And the last man standing wins.

1316
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,480
So don't...

1317
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,480
Not yet.

1318
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,719
No, not yet.

1319
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:56,079
Take the knife.

1320
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,079
Put the knife away.

1321
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,079
Put the knife away.

1322
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,079
Put the knife away.

1323
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:00,260
So everyone get to where we're standing.

1324
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,260
No knives.

1325
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,949
Only boxing.

1326
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:03,949
So if we all...

1327
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:04,949
If we...

1328
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:05,949
Ready?

1329
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:06,949
This is how it's going to end.

1330
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:07,949
Make sure we get everybody here.

1331
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:08,949
So this is how...

1332
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:09,949
Wait.

1333
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:10,949
Not yet.

1334
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:11,949
Not yet.

1335
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:12,949
Burgaboy just puts me in the face.

1336
00:45:12,949 --> 00:45:14,639
All right.

1337
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:15,639
Wait.

1338
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:17,579
Burgaboy.

1339
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:18,949
Stop it.

1340
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,250
Burgaboy.

1341
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:21,369
One.

1342
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:22,369
Two.

1343
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:35,130
One.

1344
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,130
Boxing fight.

1345
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,130
Go.

1346
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,010
Jeremy, you just disappeared.

1347
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,010
I'm over here punching people.

1348
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,190
Oh, I'm going down.

1349
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,679
I'm going down.

1350
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:43,679
No, I want to run.

1351
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:44,679
I want to get on top of the car.

1352
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:52,000
Like jumping.

1353
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Punch.

1354
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
People are like running away.

1355
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,210
Oh, it's because they're low on health.

1356
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,250
I love how nobody's even grunting or talking.

1357
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,110
So it's just like silence.

1358
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,650
Ready?

1359
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:08,650
Like...

1360
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:09,650
They're just like...

1361
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,019
Dude.

1362
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:12,019
Gang up on Burgaboy.

1363
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,019
Don't let him win.

1364
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:14,019
Don't let Burgaboy win.

1365
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:15,579
Gang up.

1366
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:16,949
Burgaboy's dead.

1367
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:18,760
Oh, I'm dead.

1368
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,599
He has full health.

1369
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:21,599
And I've none.

1370
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,199
Oh, did MLC Stealth just win?

1371
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:24,199
No.

1372
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,079
Did this guy win?

1373
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,960
Oh, and you're a winner.

1374
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,960
Hissinggem2788.

1375
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,960
Congratulations.

1376
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,960
You won the punching round.

1377
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,070
And you know what would win?

1378
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,070
A knife to the face.

1379
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:42,840
Oh, now they're bringing out guns.

1380
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,469
Oh, man.

1381
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:52,679
That was awesome.

1382
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:57,369
That was amazing.

1383
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:01,250
Oh, so if you missed it, if you missed some of it, we've been playing for just about an

1384
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,429
hour now.

1385
00:47:02,429 --> 00:47:05,869
Oh, if you missed, if you just got here or something, this is all going to be on YouTube

1386
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:06,869
tomorrow.

1387
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:07,869
So...

1388
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:12,480
There were some hysterical things that happened in this.

1389
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,360
Like if you just joined us, you're going to want to watch it tomorrow.

1390
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,800
What the heck?

1391
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,880
All right, it's time for some QWOP.

1392
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,570
That's how I pronounce drama.

1393
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:28,090
So what was my final death count?

1394
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,400
25?

1395
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,889
Oh, God.

1396
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,130
Wait, does it say?

1397
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:33,769
No, they've been counting in the stream.

1398
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:38,989
I'm just looking over and glancing over and seeing.

1399
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:41,230
All right, thanks a lot for playing, guys.

1400
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,150
If you played, I'll probably do this again.

1401
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,469
This was actually pretty damn fun.

1402
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:46,659
So thanks for coming.

1403
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:48,880
If you joined into the game, into the session.

1404
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,500
So now we're going to play some QWOP.

1405
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,280
And yeah, thanks so much, guys.

1406
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:03,210
Oh, that was a shot in the face.

1407
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,840
Pull up.

1408
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,099
How do I get out of here?

1409
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:11,300
All right, it's going to be a black screen until I get QWOP loaded.

1410
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:18,039
Q-W-O-P, QWOP, QWOP, QWOP, QWOP.

1411
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:20,360
Hey, yo.

1412
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,480
I love Liberty City.

1413
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,269
QWOP is a flash game.

1414
00:48:28,269 --> 00:48:34,969
It's a flash game where you have to use QW and then OP to run.

1415
00:48:34,969 --> 00:48:37,230
And it is incredibly difficult.

1416
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,110
So screens, actually screens probably not going to go black.

1417
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:42,800
It's probably going to be just my background.

1418
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,800
Just my desktop background.

1419
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:54,969
All right, let me pull up some QWOP.

1420
00:48:54,969 --> 00:49:00,269
Let me make sure the stream thing is there.

1421
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:02,159
Oh man, that was funny.

1422
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:07,780
That was so damn funny.

1423
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:15,980
Q-W-O-P, QWOP, QWOP, QWOP.

1424
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:22,780
I'm going to make it so it's just the QWOP screen because that's more fun that way.

1425
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,780
Black screen.

1426
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,300
Ah!

1427
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,369
Screen region.

1428
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:29,369
The QWOP screen.

1429
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:31,750
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

1430
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,400
How are you?

1431
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,719
And let's play.

1432
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:45,190
So the goal, let me put myself a goal for this match, this round.

1433
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,190
Slug.

1434
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,559
Slug.

1435
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:49,880
I'd say 10 meters.

1436
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:55,639
I'm going to try and slug my way to at least 10 to 30.

1437
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:59,119
Here we go.

1438
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,599
Hold on a second.

1439
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:06,630
I've got to get my mixer here.

1440
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,110
It's going to be a little too loud.

1441
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,480
There we go.

1442
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,570
All right, let's move.

1443
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:16,219
Yeah, TF2, I will do a TF2 stream next week, absolutely.

1444
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:20,500
But tonight, I was just running, I had a lot of work I had to do, so I just wanted to unwind

1445
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,199
with a little bit of GTA, and that was a lot of fun.

1446
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:25,639
And can I play League of Legends?

1447
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:27,679
That was one of the questions somebody was asking.

1448
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:31,900
Me and Stealth actually have played League of Legends.

1449
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,900
For like five minutes.

1450
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,019
I'm just not that good, though.

1451
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:37,960
I'm such a noob at that game.

1452
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,360
Oh no, god!

1453
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,840
No, that didn't count.

1454
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,840
That didn't count.

1455
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,320
That didn't count.

1456
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,320
This will, though.

1457
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,090
Oh, come on.

1458
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,090
Co-op.

1459
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,090
Co-op.

1460
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,090
Co-op.

1461
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,159
I just finished GTA, Mr. ADZY.

1462
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:59,230
If you want to check out my YouTube channel tomorrow, it'll be there, the whole thing.

1463
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,230
Go!

1464
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:04,800
Go!

1465
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,079
I'm actually starting to kind of understand how this works.

1466
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:11,619
Oh my god, how did I still...

1467
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:12,619
Wow.

1468
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:15,269
Okay, I'm good.

1469
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:16,269
And Diablo, I'm going to be...

1470
00:51:16,269 --> 00:51:21,679
For those of you guys that are still here, Diablo 3, I'm going to be doing a lot of live

1471
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,820
streaming of that game.

1472
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,369
A lot of Diablo 3 streams are going to happen.

1473
00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:28,369
So be on the lookout for those.

1474
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:31,239
All right, I've got to get to 30.

1475
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:32,860
Come on.

1476
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:33,860
30 meters.

1477
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:41,179
Use your slug powers from the slug god of sluggington.

1478
00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:42,179
You know what I want?

1479
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:48,150
I want to go to like a track in real life and see, like just hopefully I'd see one guy just

1480
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:49,840
doing this.

1481
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,760
Hey, what are you doing, man?

1482
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,639
I'm just training for the Olympics.

1483
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:55,719
Like oh, good.

1484
00:51:55,719 --> 00:51:56,780
You'll probably get there.

1485
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,780
Keep trying, man.

1486
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:05,079
Like just like slugging, like go, go, go, go, go.

1487
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:06,079
30 meters.

1488
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,079
I'm going to make it.

1489
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:08,769
I'm going to make it.

1490
00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:11,250
Oh, speaking of grandpa, the grandpa season one premiered tonight.

1500
00:52:24,929 --> 00:52:25,929
I did my goal.

1501
00:52:25,929 --> 00:52:27,099
Now I can...

1502
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:28,099
Whoa.

1503
00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:31,519
Now I'm going to try and actually run.

1504
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:32,699
Put it up.

1505
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:33,699
No.

1506
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:37,429
Don't go backwards.

Thanks for sticking around, for watching GTA.

1510
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,500
That was awesome.

1511
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,460
And again, if you just came and you were like, oh no, it just ended.

1512
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,150

1523
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:10,719
No, one more after that.

1524
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:12,219
I got in a groove last time.

1525
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:13,219
I don't know how I got in that groove.

1526
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:14,219
I'm like tiptoeing now.

1527
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:16,210

You got to pull.

1532
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,210
You know, the left leg has to come down.

1533
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,900
Oh, that's it.

1534
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,389
I can't do it.

1535
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:30,269

1542
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:47,829

1543
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:49,070
Woosh.

1544
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:50,070
Why can't I not say this?

1545
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,590
