1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:47,509
My legs are so weak, I really need to strengthen them on the treadmill.

2
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:56,450
The Tower of the Goat was once key to the treasure of the gold buried underneath. Mortimus, the

3
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:06,099
grey goat, held the tea to the tower for generations. And Excalibur, the black and white goat.

4
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:16,879
What? Somebody on the computer over there? What's that? They're eating dinner? Hi. Hi,

5
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:29,920
I'm Mr. Goat. I hope you're enjoying your dinner. This game is amazing. Trampoline,

6
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,079
baby. I used to have one of these in my backyard. Want to see what I used to do in the trampoline,

7
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:43,280
I'm going very high. Hold on, this does not seem to be right. Nobody can really jump this

8
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:52,859
high on a trampoline. Catch me! Catch me please! Help! Not gonna invite me to your backyard party?

9
00:01:52,859 --> 00:02:04,079
I'll show you. I wanted the hot dogs. What? I was trying to kick the thing over there and it didn't

10
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:15,030
work. You know what? It is gonna work. I'll make it work. He's flying. He's flying. And he's on fire.

11
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:22,979
Oh. And these people are all still dancing. Do you see what just happened to the guy that was

12
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:32,259
hosting the event? And what kind of dance is this? I've never seen anybody do this dance,

13
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:37,860
unless you were a toddler. These people are doing the I'm a toddler learning how to dance

14
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:46,810
to like Mickey Mouse music. Honey, can you just go check on the greenhouse and make sure my

15
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:53,759
petunias are in line? Oh, sure thing, honey. Oh, the glass doesn't break. I've got your

16
00:02:53,759 --> 00:03:04,259
favorite breakfast cereal waiting for you. It's Pop-Tarts! Oh, Pop-Tarts! Where are they? I hate

17
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:08,659
going grocery shopping. I always have to go grocery shopping. This stuff sucks. I'm gonna

18
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:12,419
get Coca-Cola Classic. That's like my favorite. And I'm gonna get Doritos,

19
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:19,819
Spanada chips. Those are good too. I also want, what else do I want? I guess I could use a little

20
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:26,259
bit of ham. Do they have ham here? I don't even know. Maybe. Excuse me, sir, do you have ham? Oh,

21
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:36,740
he's not here anymore. Oh, she's dead. Frodo, you must take the goblins out of the cave of mystery,

22
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:44,580
and you must, you shall not pass into it fast enough. You could go first, because best friends

23
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:57,360
let their best friends go first on the slide. Okay, have fun. Have fun on the slide. Whee,

24
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:12,680
this is so much fun. Oh, whoa, sorry. I'm sorry. I'll pay for that. I'll pay for that. I'll make

25
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,000
sure you get like an extra monitor, a 27-incher, not just a 22-incher, whatever that is. Who are

26
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,339
you, Bill? How's life? How's the kids? Yeah, the kids are good, huh? Yeah, that's great. Everybody

27
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:33,120
expects me to just trash this place. But you know what? I think I'm gonna have some self-control,

28
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:41,779
because I could just trash this place right now, and it's really starting to build up,

29
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:48,829
and I really want to do it. But I think I'm gonna hold back just a little bit right now.

30
00:04:48,829 --> 00:05:09,949
Get out before I change my mind. Hello, sir. Welcome to the goat station. Did I tell you

31
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:21,939
that today was baseball day at the gas station? Thank you for coming. Hey, Mortimer, welcome to

32
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:31,420
the party. Hey, Frank, how are you? What are you cooking on the grill? We've got some various meats

33
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:39,060
that we are cooking here on the grill. That better not be goat meat. If it's goat meat,

34
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:49,350
I'll be upset with you. Well, it is lamb. My family, we eat lamb. Same difference. Come here.

35
00:05:49,350 --> 00:06:09,500
Come here. Oh, Lee. This is like Katamari Damacy. How much stuff can I pick up? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
