00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:16,539

00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:11,879
have to do this every time? I have no what? That was just so complicated. I have to enter a service

8
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:20,260
number. Let's just go like 916. I think that was one. I'm pretty sure that was a service number.

Photoshop right now I have an erase tool and I'm just gonna drive by these people and they're

21
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,189
going to be erased. See watch. Oh I let go. I messed up. I made a mistake on that part of my

22
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:21,430
Photoshop thing. Oh these people too. You know I messed up that as well. Might as well just use

23
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:30,099
the paint tool and erase everyone. Look at these people are just gone. They're just gone.

24
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:43,050
Look see this lady in the green. Watch this. Ta-da. She's gone. And so is like the other six people

29
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:28,790
space-time continuum training we had and. What? What? So what happens if I get in a head-on

30
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:48,339
collision? Oh that was so awful. That was the glitchiest piece of crap thing I've ever seen.

31
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:55,689
That was like tactical intervention right there. Bringing back horrible memories. Oh hey look let's

32
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:05,139
get in a crash. Oh yeah. Hey I like to drive buses. Have you played my video game where you drive

33
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:17,110
buses around? It's fun. It's called Bus Simulator 2013. Where are his hands? This guy's hands aren't

34
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:35,800
