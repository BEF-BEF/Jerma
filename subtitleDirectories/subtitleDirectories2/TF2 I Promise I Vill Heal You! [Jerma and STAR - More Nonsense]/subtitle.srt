1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,970
I'm just gonna stick this medigun up your ass and we're gonna kill everybody. That sounds fine. I'll grab

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,670
the righteous bison

3
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:32,570
Oh, you can juggle I didn't know you could juggle Jerma. I learned how to the other day when I was bored waiting for my

4
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:42,340
Anal exam. Oh, really? How'd that go? They put the juggled in my butt. What's a juggle? Oh

5
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,380
Right. We were just talking about juggling

6
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,740
I

7
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,740
Don't know that it's a noun but I mean

8
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:57,479
The juggle is it time? Is it time here? Is it time? Yeah, not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet

9
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,939
Not yet. Use it. Yeah, I needed it for that ng because screw ng's watch up on a scope

10
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:10,939
No one here now. Yeah. Oh backstab. Watch out turn around turn around. I was

11
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,769
Could have gone better. It was like a whole nest up there a second ago

12
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,810
Could have sworn at least yeah

13
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:25,459
Things. Hey, that's all that matters shot a guy killed an engineer

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,420
That's top priority mini century engineer. That is like not priority number one

15
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,569
That sounds smash, you know, we're gonna go around the round the back

16
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:41,829
It's right for that spy too, cuz he's like always killing me because I'm Jerma

17
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,459
I got a double kill at the crit rocket. Like I was standing there just like waiting to see who would hit and I got

18
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,379
Me killed

19
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:04,790
Yeah

20
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,870
That was very very crazy looking on my screen. It looks like you just disconnected from the game

21
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,590
Are you dead? No, I'm alive. I made it out

22
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,530
he's

23
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,409
Connach I feel like I've done nothing. Oh

24
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:26,909
Bye. I was like, are you ready? You ready Jerma? No, not yet. There's no one here. Oh

25
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:34,750
Let me heal this guy

26
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,319
Boy, oh boy. I'm gonna die. I had to run. Okay. I'm coming with you. Where you be? I'm on the cart

27
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,400
I'm just trying to get some help. Oh, I forgot I had them

28
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,580
What keeps happening to you, I don't know but at least I'm doing it spectacularly

29
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:04,150
I mean if you're gonna die make a scene of it and

30
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:12,229
We need like a bug we'd like six snipers standing in the same spot for you to get like a quadruple to the kill

31
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,379
Oh

32
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:28,840
Oh, he jumped down going for it. Oh you oh, he took so much damage. Let's back up. We can't be here

33
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,379
This is scary gonna get on that cat. Oh

34
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:38,580
No, they're kind of like camping them. Maybe we can stay here kind of where's the red team?

35
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:48,650
I don't know. Where the hell is the other team? What's going on? Oh, I got this reload the bison and here it goes

36
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:56,349
Use it going up. Oh

37
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,629
That was pretty oh back step. That's okay. I think we we are winners. I'm gonna go scalp

38
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,030
I'm gonna go scale just a run on the cot just sprint on it. Oh, yeah

39
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,979
I got him pretty good here at spawn. This is how we do it

40
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:34,300
Top frag again, I'll play the Solomon

41
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:43,879
Soldier is a spy. The heavy is a spy. The heavy is a sniper. What?

42
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,879
Good job

43
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,959
Should have played harder. What did he just like shoot him in the friggin door?

44
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,120
There was like a hundred of them at the gate like how they always placed them there

45
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,079
Yeah, I was like I was like standing where the train tracks are like I would do like behind the cart

46
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,600
Oh, I think that some of them got blown back by an explosion

47
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,480
Okay

48
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,079
Makes sense

49
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:10,790
There we go. Pray. I love your rock anybody in there

50
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:18,620
I'm you I'm also birding to death somebody in there somebody in there. I just heard like I heard the ding

51
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,100
I heard the ding. What's the ding it goes dings? Which class did oh the ding?

52
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:30,870
I heard a ding. Oh a lot of stuff going on up here

53
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:39,480
I love all that guy just thought this was an actual built dispenser. I've done that so many times before

54
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,319
I keep thinking that like I'm not used to that yet. I've seen the sentries do that

55
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:51,360
What way dispensers are newer you think they would fix that you think they wouldn't fix like the invisible players

56
00:05:51,639 --> 00:06:01,439
You think they would fix a lot of things like heavies hands disappearing valve. What the heck man

57
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:10,100
Hey, come up left with me. We got to be one again. Come over here. I'm right over here. Yeah, is it good?

58
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
Hey, let's go adventure

59
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,000
There's way for this to open wait. Just wait here. Just just crouch in the corner with me

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,439
We're gonna have a good time. Don't shoot hold your fight. Okay. Oh

61
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:35,949
Mini century don't think so. I think we're winning. I'm damn looks like it. We have the heavy

62
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:40,709
No, don't you think about it? Don't you think about it?

63
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:57,379
I am in desperate need of a medic big time or this health back. Thank many century. Where are you where?

64
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:04,930
There's a mini century in that gray gravel Co building and I'm afraid to go over and do anything about it

65
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:21,230
Oh, it's gone. Hey, I could smell you scout right behind you. Just keep walking forward. Oh

66
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:24,769
Sentry

67
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:39,420
Whoa, you didn't top left top left. Oh, I'm up there. Oh, there's a lot of people up there. I'm up there

68
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:47,879
That's cool. Oh my god, there's a video. We did it. He got 50 points for just standing on the car

69
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,779
Wow, well, he really did he really got 30 above everyone else just for I'm gonna stand on the cart
