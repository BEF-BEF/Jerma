00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,630
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,629
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Heavy on Badwater on Offense.

3
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:26,629
Gonna be using the default minigun, the strange shen, which that's not true.

4
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:29,629
The regular sandwich. I don't think there is a strange sandwich.

5
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:33,810
And the gloves of running urgently, as you see right here.

6
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,109
So this commentary is gonna be a little bit different, gonna be a little more strange, a little more weird.

7
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,109
You see what I did there?

8
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:46,479
I just drank like five coffees and I decided, what if I drop all my conventional wisdoms of commentary

9
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:52,479
and just hit record after having a bunch of caffeine and just let loose and see what I say and see what happens.

10
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:57,479
I'll talk about what happens on the screen, I'm gonna talk about random stuff, but you know, whatever, let's just go.

11
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,719
So this is gonna be called, The Coffee Commentary of Justice and Doom.

12
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,859
Rated R.

13
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:13,040
As you can see, this is already going off to a great start.

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
So what am I gonna talk about? Let's talk about of course what's going on on the screen and what am I doing here?

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,409
Well, it's Team Fortress 2 for one thing, one of my favorite games.

16
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:23,409
Okay, that really just scared the crap out of me.

17
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,409
I forgot that happened and that just, I felt like I was in the game.

18
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:30,840
Will you get out of my face? I'm trying to talk to my friends.

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,019
Thank you, he's gone.

20
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:36,019
But I forgot that happened and I actually couldn't believe I was still alive at this point.

21
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:42,019
A soldier comes around the corner, right here I think it is, and he starts shooting at me and I don't die.

22
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:48,019
I couldn't believe I was still alive. I was praying I wasn't gonna die because obviously I wanted to keep this run going.

23
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:56,019
And this run does go for a pretty long damn time and that is a spy, you're dead twice.

24
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:01,319
So talking about Badwater for a minute here, I want to bring up, don't get me wrong, I love Badwater.

25
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,319
Badwater is probably my second or third favorite map in this game.

26
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:11,319
But while you're attacking, it is the most frustrating thing if they have a good defense on the last point.

27
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,319
And hold on a second, I shit you, yeah, that was the noise he made.

28
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,560
So attacking on Badwater the last point is almost impossible if they have a good defense.

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,560
It is almost impossible and it's the most frustrating thing.

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Because you'll see, once we get up to this second or last checkpoint and we start turning the corner and we start going around,

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,560
it stops to a snail's pace, like a legit slug. We are slugs when we get around this corner.

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,560
And look at how fast we've been going. We have been absolutely rolling this whole entire time.

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,740
And what stops us is a couple of level three sentries down the bottom.

34
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,740
And nobody can really get down there because of course it's on an incline and everyone's kind of down in the pit,

35
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,909
just tossing up grenades and like throwing fire bombs and firecrackers on your front lawn.

36
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:02,150
And it can be very frustrating. So I mean, I had to cut like four minutes off of this gameplay,

37
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:09,150
specifically because it was just me jumping down to my death, getting slaughtered by the sentry guns every two seconds.

38
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,150
And it was just failed push after failed push after failed push.

39
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,150
So I figured chew the fat off a little bit, get you the good stuff, get you the real milk and cookies of the gameplay,

40
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,150
and you get to see the ending too. So don't worry.

41
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,780
So now I got a less than 150 health. This is not a good position to be in. Run away from that cart.

42
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,780
I shoot this soldier right in his spinal cavity, right where it hurts the absolute goddamn most.

43
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,780
And now I want to talk about this hat. A lot of people ask me, Jermo, what the hell is that thing on your head?

44
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,780
Wait, is that the Eiffel Tower? What the hell is that goddamn thing?

45
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,780
And I will explain. I got that hat from a gift from the Kritz cast guys.

46
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,780
They give away, I think every week they do a show when they give away a hat.

47
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,780
And that's the hat they give away. It's the vintage lo-fi long wave, I think it's called.

48
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,780
And you can only get it if you get Player of the Week. And that sniper.

49
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,020
Oh, I was so mad at that guy. I was my hand buried down into my keyboard.

50
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:10,020
I was so pissed about that because I thought I could stay alive and get a full game one life, but it didn't happen.

51
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,020
But yeah, I got that from the Kritz cast guys. They're really cool dudes.

52
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,189
I may in fact be on the Kritz cast at some point. I don't know when.

53
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:21,189
I mean, we kind of went back and forth about maybe doing something, but I'm not sure.

54
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:24,370
Maybe in the future you'll see me on that podcast.

55
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,370
But anyways, let's return to the gameplay.

56
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,370
Seeing this sentry right here, I know I can outrange it because the engineer is kaput. He is dead.

57
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,370
And the lower right, a spy just sapped that one as well.

58
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,370
So right now we have like a little tea party going on in this cart now. We are going to win this.

59
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,250
There's no reason why we can lose. I can't think of one reason. We're going to win. We won the game, right?

60
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,680
You fucking sniper. We were going to win right there, man. Come on. Why'd you do that?

61
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,800
All right, we got over it. We're good now.

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,800
So I bump into a dead ringer spy right here. Either that or it was lag.

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
And I feel like that happens more often than it should.

64
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Where you got to, what the hell did I bump into somebody? But it turns out you didn't.

65
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,800
But anyways, this is the end of the gameplay. We win the game right here.

66
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Top fragging as House Targaryen.

67
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,800
If you watch Game of Thrones, you'll understand that reference.

68
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,300
It's a very good show. I could go on for hours about that show, but I'll do that a different time.

69
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,300
So let me know if you guys like this new style of commentary. Not going to do it every single time.

70
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
But just trying something a little different.

71
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,300
So I'll see you guys all soon. That wraps up the video.

72
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,300
And I'll catch you guys all next time.

73
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
So take care, everybody.
