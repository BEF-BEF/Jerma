00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,199
Hey, what's happening guys? Today, we're gonna be doing TF2. We're gonna be opening up some boxes.

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:22,620
I've opened up quite a few of these already, and we're just gonna get into it. Hopefully I get something good, because I've been shafted quite a few times.

3
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:28,239
So, enjoy the unboxing. Let's go ahead and get number one open. It's a lightning rod field tested.

4
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:36,200
You know what? You know what? Get them all open. You know, get them all open. Open them all right now, at the same time.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Yeah, come on. No, I take it back. No, no, no. Oh, shit. I just blew through that. That was so stupid. What an impulsive, stupid idea.

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:55,619
And now I got a backpack that's in even worse shape than it was before this update, and it was in pretty bad shape before.

7
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:08,379
But look at this. I got so many of these now, from doing contracts and opening cases. I don't know. I counted. I have 13 of the McDonald's Happy Meal Shotgun.

8
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:18,569
What am I supposed to do with this stuff? Look at how many of these I have. Like, this one is well-worn with a strange on it. I don't even know what these things are worth.

9
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:29,629
And look, look at this. I didn't even notice this before. Why do I have 10 strange knives? What purpose do these serve? You know, I'm just gonna take the backpack off.

10
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:42,819
I just gotta get it off. Just get it off and take a look inside and see what you're actually working with. I don't know what this is. I don't know what that is.

11
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:53,819
It might be a strange... Here's a scatter gun. I want to keep this. This is my strange scatter gun. This is my Tommy Slav. I know I have to hold onto that because it's worth like 15 cents.

12
00:01:53,819 --> 00:02:10,599
Here's... Oh, Jesus. What? This is a fucking dog bone? There's no dog bone item in TF2. I don't know where that came from. This is part of a sandwich, obviously.

13
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,780
I just... I don't know what to... I don't know what to do with this stuff! I have too much of it!

14
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,490
Hey, if you're going... Hey!

15
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,490
I'll be right back.

16
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:36,900
No, hit me up some french fries. The good ones from Wendy's. Are you listening to me? Fucking idiot.

17
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,139
Ten knives. You gotta have ten knives, don't you?

18
00:02:42,139 --> 00:03:02,719
Hello. Hey. What's going on, dude? How you doing? You're outside right now? Yeah, yeah. Just give me a second. I'll be right out.

19
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:08,539
I'm so glad you're here. It's been like a year since I last saw you. You want to do something? What do you want to do? You want to go out?

20
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:11,539
I don't have any more room. This is your problem now.

21
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,539
What?

22
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:18,490
Come on, man.

23
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,490
That was my first time!

24
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,930
Jesus.

25
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:34,449
Ow.

26
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:35,449
Damn.

27
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,919
Assistant?

28
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,919
Yes?

29
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,919
Get in this room.

30
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,919
What's wrong, sir? What's wrong? What's wrong?

31
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,919
You piece of crap.

32
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,919
What?

33
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,919
I called you fifteen seconds ago, maybe even twenty. And it took you this long?

34
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,919
I'm so sorry, sir.

35
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,919
Get that fucking door open.

36
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,919
I'm so sorry. Thank you, sir.

37
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,919
You know what? The next time you're late like that, the next... Connor is a real bitch. You do something like that again?

38
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,919
You embarrass me like that in front of all these fifty-five million people? You're fired.

39
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,919
I'm so sorry.

40
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,919
Oh, shit!

41
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:21,689
I'm fucking dead.
