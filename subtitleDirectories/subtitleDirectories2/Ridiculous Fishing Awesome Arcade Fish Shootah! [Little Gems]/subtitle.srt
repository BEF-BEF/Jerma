00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,070
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jirba here with Ridiculous Fishing.

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,070
This is an iOS device mobile game for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch.

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:24,239
And it is a great one. We're gonna talk about this, gonna break it down in the little gem fashion that you are used to.

4
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:31,239
Now, before the video gets started, I need to address this because there's gonna be at least a dozen people in the comments section that are gonna say this.

5
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,240
And I wanna address it before the video even goes anywhere.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,740
So Ridiculous Fishing is not a copy of Ninja Fishing.

7
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,240
A lot of you guys have probably already played that game, Ninja Fishing.

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:49,240
There's a lot of controversy surrounding these two games because Ridiculous Fishing, of course, was an old game in 2000.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,740
I believe 2010 is when it first came out.

10
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,240
And it was a free flash game. You just played it. I think it was called Radical Fishing was the actual title.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,740
But Ninja Fishing took inspiration from it and made their own game.

12
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,239
And there was a lot of BS surrounding it. Everyone was like, wow, this is a copy. What's gonna...

13
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,239
It's kind of like... It sort of reminds me of the DayZ WarZee situation,

14
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,239
where the DayZ developers were working on the DayZ standalone.

15
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,239
And then the WarZee kind of came along and was like, but look, come play our game. It's like the same thing, but like, cool, right?

16
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:20,239
It's sort of that situation. That's the best way I can really describe it.

17
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,239
But with all that, I'm not gonna go into that any further.

18
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,239
This is just to let you know, this is not a copy of any game.

19
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:28,569
This is the original, as they say.

20
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:33,069
So Ridiculous Fishing is, as the title suggests, a fishing game.

21
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:37,569
You cast your line into the water, you try to get as deep as possible, and you catch fish.

22
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:45,069
So what you do when you catch the fish is where this game really deviates from many of the fishing games you've probably ever played.

23
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:49,069
When you get to the top of the water, you shoot the hell out of everything you catch.

24
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:54,569
So it's... There are a lot of guns in the game, too. There's pistols, machine guns, like laser beams.

25
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,069
There's a lot of different upgrades you can get for gun-wise to destroy these fish.

26
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,879
Some that are more effective than others.

27
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,879
But regardless of what you choose for an arsenal, the shooting mechanics are just plain fun.

28
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,879
The game feels very polished and refined.

29
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,379
There's no real bugs I've found yet that have been like, what the hell just happened? I shot that fish.

30
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,379
This is bullshit. Like, that hasn't happened yet.

31
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:19,379
And not to mention the fun, pixelated, retro kind of art style.

32
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,879
It just adds more flair to it in general.

33
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:27,259
And real briefly, we'll talk about the actual mechanics of the game, how it plays, how it works.

34
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:31,259
It's a tilt control game. So you hold your iPad, you hold your iPhone straight in the air,

35
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,759
and you go side to side to move the lure around.

36
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,259
And you don't want to touch anything. When you're going down, this is a big important thing.

37
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:44,259
While you're going down, if you bump into any fish, you're going to start your ascent upwards.

38
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:48,759
So you want to try to get as deep as humanly possible before you try to catch anything.

39
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:52,259
And you can upgrade how deep you can possibly go.

40
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:58,689
And a lot of you guys are probably wondering, Jerma, I just watched you smash into like a hundred fish.

41
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:01,189
What do you mean you have to avoid them? You're not doing that.

42
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:06,189
Well, that's specifically because I have a huge amount of upgrades into my fish grinder.

43
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:09,689
What that does is I can activate it by tapping on the screen and holding,

44
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:14,689
and I blend up anything that gets in my way so I don't have to go up prematurely.

45
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:20,560
The game soft caps you at certain meters that as you get money by shooting the fish,

46
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,060
that's how you actually make the money, you can keep upgrading to go lower and lower and lower.

47
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,060
And eventually it gets to be quite difficult because in the deep sea,

48
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,060
everything is dark and you have to get a lantern. You have to buy the different light upgrades.

49
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,060
There's a lot of stuff in this game for as simple as it possibly could be.

50
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,050
It's a ton of fun. There's a bunch of areas you can unlock.

51
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,050
There's a whole soundtrack. There's a lot of great things about this game.

52
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,550
And Vlambeer is a fantastic independent studio, guys, and I would highly recommend you play this game.

53
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,550
This is one of the best iPad, iPhone games to come out this year, absolutely guarantee.

54
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,050
I can guarantee you that, that that's going to be the case.

55
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,550
And it's $2.99 on the App Store.

56
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,550
It might seem like a lot of money for a simple game like this, guys,

57
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,050
but with the upgrade system, the amount of fun you can have just by sitting there playing,

58
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,550
I was in the DMV playing this game for like two and a half hours,

59
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,550
and it was almost like I wasn't even at the DMV. It was fantastic.

60
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,550
So that alone is reason enough to pick up a game like this.

61
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:23,050
So go support Vlambeer, guys. They're actually the same people that made Super Crate Box,

62
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,550
which is a little gem in its own right.

63
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,050
And that's going to wrap up the video.

64
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,050
So again, this is a universal app for iOS devices.

65
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,550
As long as you have iOS 5.0 or higher, you can play this game.

66
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,550
So thank you all so much for watching. Really do appreciate it.

67
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,050
I'll see you all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.

68
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,050
Little gems.
