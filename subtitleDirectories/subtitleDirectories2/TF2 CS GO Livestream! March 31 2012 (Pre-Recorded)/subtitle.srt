25
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:13,759
I've not seen the hunger games. Is it any good? And if the answer is yes, I would probably see it

26
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,250
It's about as good as the TV show community as good as it gets

27
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,379
That was a I was a good movie with Jack Nicholson. Oh, there's burger boy the insensitive one

29
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,520
Sensitive one

30
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:41,629
Burger Boy the insensitive one areas because we all know that he's a real insensitive bastard. You've seen it five times

00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:13,379

35
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,139
Oh burger boy

36
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:19,579
There's this page one so you can go over page one while I do Twitter and then I'll do page two in a second

37
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:38,189
I got backstabbed don't get backstabbed. All righty. All right, we go to page two page two

38
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:43,000
That's the page two even though you can't see. Oh, it's show. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry

39
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,180
So I go back to page one so you can see the colors and this whole thing is being given away

40
00:04:48,339 --> 00:05:21,610
So hopefully you're one of the winners. Oh, no page two. I got a lot of strangers a lot of strangers page three

41
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:30,170
Hey, you're heck you're heck. Yeah

42
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:39,680
Page four. I love how burger boys using the

43
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,319
Logger now and you're gonna have to deal with it now, aren't you? No, I don't know. He's on my team

44
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:56,339
Oh, I'm like medic on him one more page after this. Does any of them stick you to the wall?

45
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:04,449
I don't think it does. I think only the is my character was like standing up after I get killed and then page six

46
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:11,509
There you go. This is probably like the best page with all of my actual hats that I like love

47
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:24,050
And all the strangers are of course are over here and you get the idea. Do you do you do?

48
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,209
All right, let's do it. Let's do a high five and let's get this wrong

49
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:37,189
Yeah, I items that I cannot give away. I've not I won't be able to get away

50
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:42,129
So I can't give away the cheaters lament. I can't give away. I think there's a couple other things

51
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:53,240
You can't give either. There's like two or three items. I know for sure. I cannot give I'll be ginger

52
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:06,079
Let's turn this down. It's just a tick just a tick. Well, where's my Gerardi? I don't have the Gerardi. Oh

53
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:12,649

You a spy you kind of acted like one. Oh look MLC stealth just killed stealth

57
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,069
When do I think I'll hit 25,000

58
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:51,769
Probably a couple weeks, maybe maybe a week. I don't know. It's gonna happen sooner rather than later

59
00:07:51,769 --> 00:08:05,620
I probably will say that I don't know though. I have no idea follow me Jack

60
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:18,509
Oh you ran into it whoo-hoo-hoo. That was pretty nice, but don't say so myself. I just got like fished

Nucleus

68
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:12,159
Nucleus direct it. I'll try it and the conqueror. Why am I using that the contrar?

69
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:20,679
It's CH. It's like church. Do you know how to pronounce things snipers? I'm scared

70
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,759
Oh, do you remember yesterday? I was saying about how hard is the headshot soldiers that there's like four soldiers on the other side

71
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,759
I just can't headshot one

72
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,139
Actually, I recognize that beard any day. Come here German. Well, what's that?

73

Nevermind boo. Why you know post-modern warfare 3 that's what she said

74
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:44,120
Oh, it's cuz I really don't like the game anymore

75
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,139
I might not be totally dumb and I'm weighing it about in my head because I've got some old recorded gameplay

76
00:09:50,139 --> 00:10:01,559
I just never used I might make a few more bids out of it pyro direct hit. Oh

00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:16,419
Come on, come on come out of that watch out for the crits people everywhere like all over it

85
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,409
Well, I'll hear a joke. Yeah, tell me a joke. Let's hear it. Give me all you got with jokes

00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:13,980
You son of a bitch you rat bastard, so what way what was the joke? I'm waiting. It's probably tight

89
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:24,549
No, it's probably a joke. Oh, no, I just missed I gotta step my game up a little bit here

90
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:36,509
I'm like one in twenty five thousand. Oh, no, like I wrote stealth just like you do stuff. Mm-hmm

91
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:47,289
Then he backstab me. Oh, how did I not get him? Oh, get me out of there. I'm dead

92
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:51,669
Oh, there's no way I could have survived that can't be pyro right now. That was a lucky headshot. Holy shit

93
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:59,120
I'm going demo. I'm going demo demo man. Hey, what makes you a good demo man?

94
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:07,129
Um, a lot of things if you are good with shooting your pills, I can drink from a frying pan

95
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:17,460
What makes me a good demo man, oh he just felt

96
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:27,179
How do I not get him with that how do I not get I want to be your discussion it with you now would I

97
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:37,570
No, we need a medic. We all we do have a medic. We need more than one medic

98
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:43,679
You have two medics. I think we do. I had showing one of them

99
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,350
Once I just walked right off the map. Hey, there's a big hole in the middle of this map

100
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,960
If you didn't notice and I'm still as a joke is your mama's so fat

101
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:02,129
Everyone at the movie theaters thinks she's I can't really yet burger boys coming for me. Hey, it seems

102
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:12,669
Your mama's so fat at the movie theater. She sat next to everyone sick

103
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,399
I got one for you. Your mom is so stupid

104
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,169
She made me cookies and was a wicked nice woman and was awesome to be around at all times. There you go

105
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,169
Oh

106
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:26,450
Oh

107
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:34,799
All right. I got one too. All right. What is it? Why did the

108
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:43,779
King and Queen get a divorce? No, why because they had a bad night?

109
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,210
Yeah, suck both versions of the like word night. All right, boo. You're gonna do one now. Well, I've got to do a joke

110
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,799
That's why I work good Lord

111
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,200
You'll have to give me a few minutes then. Oh, come on. You have to like make it your own

112
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:10,080
No, the pressures are no, I've got to be honest man. I've got to deliver. Yeah. Yeah, get out of town

113
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,110
Big joke. Yeah. Good luck. Oh my god. No, I don't want that

114
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:32,889
No, get on the point. Yeah, I can't I can't keep my head over there. I'm just trying to log stuff in there. Come on

115
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:37,440
No, no, no

116
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:43,940
So boo, how about that joke? I can't I'm sniping him in my element

117
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,049
Sniper was walking down the street one day was he singing to a diddy diddy dum dee dee dee

118
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:58,340
Yeah, so he was singing that song and all of a sudden a bus came and just smashed into him

119
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,799
Oh, and that's the punchline. They will live happily ever after

120
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:14,019
I just got the like event for Germans and he made cycle path. Oh, really?

121
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,399
It's just starting

122
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,399
That was happens like much later than it should yeah, I sometimes said it to do that

123
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:24,720
Because when I usually when I'm when I first put the announcement out

124
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:27,879
I'm just kind of sitting there doing like nothing and shouting things out

125
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:33,419
So people probably just like what the hell is he doing 15 minutes in is pretty much when everything really gets going

126
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:38,720
I guess you stream get priority as well for the for the game, which is fair enough

127
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,399
Let's do one more round in here and then we're gonna go to

128
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,299
Different

129
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:07,470
I literally just tried holding down shift to sprint. Yeah, I've been doing that since I've been playing battle. Oh, look at how the jokes

130
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:14,160
Oh, did I save your life just barely? I think who just wait. Okay. I'm so confused right now

131
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,720
I just saw a stealth die in front of me by MLC still

132
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:28,150
Bye behind me, but I don't care. I'm too fast for hey, who's the real one? Oh my god. I can't hit the soldier

133
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,069
I'm so scared. Oh my god. Thank you for saving my life

134
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:41,670
Can I play Saxton Hale? I we tried doing that a while ago. It didn't really work out so well, though

135
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,549
It's we do prop hunt

136
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:49,750
Well, only because I was the only person that could get into the server and we were just spending a whole lot of time

137
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:56,259
Just watching spectating and it was kind of boring. So at least for a stream. It was kind of boring

138
00:17:56,259 --> 00:18:01,210
I'd want to do that for like a video get get a bunch of people in there and make some like fun video

139
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:10,299
And I'm going to die get me out of here. They're way too many people there to be fighting right now

140
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,339
Come on

141
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:28,569
That other stealth guys being is like

142
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:38,039
360 I have to help it's it just the end for me might as well just do this. Oh my god. Oh my god

143
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,250
But I don't kill by a fit. I was you

144
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,019
Oh

145
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,579
Son of a bitch

146
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,940
I was in the spawn door and he shot me right in the back

147
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:03,579
Like I was like I was right like in the door and I got hit right in the back. Yeah

148
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:13,140
The red team it was a revolver too. He's not dead. We got a lot of scouts. I just heard it

149
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:23,930
I just heard him. I just heard him the soldier behind this bastard. I feel like playing pyro. I'm starting to like him more now

150
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,970
I was never good at pyro before

151
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:34,779
You know, I've learned to really like playing pyro playing pyro is like a ton of fun for me and I never used yeah

152
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:40,339
I I never used to like him because I always wanted to use the flare gun and when I found another pyro eyes

153
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,140
It's impossible

154
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:51,259
Yeah, the flare gun pretty much reinvented pyro for me like it became so much fun

155
00:19:51,299 --> 00:20:01,400
What are my views on meet the pyro? I think it's gonna be epic judging by the last two

156
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,119
We've gotten meet the medic and meet the spy. They've been unbelievable

157
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:12,059
So one can only hope it's got to be something just as good if not better than meet the spy and meet the medic

158
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:23,039
What are they? What are those like a 2d animation thing? Yeah, that'd be interesting. It'd be interesting. It'd be cool

159
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,420
No, no, like it looked like it sucks

160
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,670
What if meet the pyro sucked? I would be disappointed. I shouldn't have shot him. Why'd I do that?

161
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,400
Well, at least you got my back. Anyways, I'm getting destroyed

162
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,869
Passage meet the pyro was like stick figures and like the music was a MIDI file like

163
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:52,910
What if what if the pyro was a stick figure Wow, you just blew my mind right there what?

164
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:58,940
You just totally blew like he takes off his his mask and it's literally just a stick figure

165
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:02,549
It's like a broom like in Family Guy

166
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:17,690
Yeah, they're probably not gonna take his mask off I bet you hit the hill take his mask off

167
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:25,890
You're saying why are you saying well hurt him or her the pyro will probably take off the mask right when the ending happens

168
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,890
Like oh, here I go. Like you're it

169
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:34,829
It'll probably be something like that. What if it'll be Gabe Newell's troll face? What if it was just Gabe Newell's face?

170
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:41,200
It's just Gabe Newell's face is him like he made the character like after himself

171
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:49,230
I cannot hit this scout to save my life. Can't hit anybody to save my life for real. Jeez

172
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,859
I mean all jokes aside the pyro is clearly just gonna be Zoe

173
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:04,160
Clearly stick the scout and if I'm gonna go with the if I should stop do I have a strange stuff?

174
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,829
I don't we'll go with the whole set. How do you stop a gay bed easy?

175
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:18,559
You press the gay bet gay Ben gay bet in addition. I'll save you. Oh

176
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:33,000
Help me. Oh boo with the pistol. Nice

177
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:39,049
Somebody can somebody can find an empty

178
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:45,339
Randomizer server we need we need an empty randomizer server not a full one not one

179
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:52,589
That's like an arena a real good like instant respawn randomizer server with nobody in it then we can hop into it

180
00:22:52,589 --> 00:23:03,930
No, I'm not doing with that. It's going to lose to be destroying me all game

181
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,380
So that so that is a

182
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,019
Quest for the germa group to find that randomizer server

183
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,140
How many how many

184
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:23,299
Germa points do they get for completing that quest? I said 15 German points. I know that's you

185
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:26,390
You got Optimus Prime with you

186
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:34,359
Come on now. He's gonna headshot me. I know he is he always does

187
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:53,180
Can I like vote Optimus Prime like Best Buy in the in the world like Best Buy in team fortress

188
00:23:53,259 --> 00:24:01,779
Can I like can I like safely say that right now? I like really think I can he's in part of part of that

189
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:04,539
But like electric bugalow bungalow get with electric

190
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,220
espionage

191
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:24,539
Oh my god, why am I not hitting anybody with this? Let's get in here and then do it. That was so lucky stuff

192
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,220
I'm gonna die. Oh

193
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:34,680
This is a brass piece. What are you doing? Oh, did I get lucky? I did not sorry. I'm sorry

00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:55,140
No, no, I refuse to die. I refuse jump it jump it jump of the pit quick

196
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:03,529
Alright, so that that is a we got a randomized server right there empty if that is the game

197
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:10,029
Oh, that was so close. Let's go find out. I need to go to

198
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:23,859
Add a server. Let's see if this one has like no people in it. Alright, so here we go

199
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:30,099
This is the server that we're going into right now. You ready guys. Yes

200
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,589
207.188.214.12

201
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,869
colon two eight zero one six go go go go go

202
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:52,299
Attempt in one five idiot. How dare I assume so randomizes like heavies with spy knives

203
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:55,900
Yeah, this is like this is like total nonsense. Oh, it's in it's on nucleus

204
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,779
There you go drop to the slot reservation what?

205
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,220

00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,029
Okay, so slot reservation well

207
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,470
Well, my first one was a medic with the machina girati and

208
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:21,980
Disciplinary action. I should have got in there first before sending it. Oh damn it. All right. What was the second one?

209
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,420
I don't know. I gotta get in there first

210
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:29,630
See if this one was existing we're gonna have to change. This is no way I'll get in there now

211
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:36,799
Server let's try it again this one. Okay. There we go. All right

212
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:44,589
So I'm I'm gonna go I'm gonna put a new IP into the chat. So when you get a chance

213
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:53,869
Everybody go to this server and I'm gonna tell you guys ready two or five dot two three four dot one five two

214
00:26:54,190 --> 00:27:00,490
Dot eighty five colon two seven zero fifteen head in there now. Let me know when you're connecting

215
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:03,339
and

216
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:06,519
There you go. That's the one we're playing on right now

217
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:11,089
The other one filled up too quickly and has a lot of slot reservations. All right, there we go

218
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:25,150
Thank you Ari or Zeus whoever it is and doesn't really matter whatever you pick what okay, this is like the oddest thing ever

219
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:34,150
I'm holding the am I the heavy or this on the sniper? What in God's name? I'm holding the enforcer

220
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:39,930
It's totally broken apart and I just I can't even if we have to see this. I can't even explain it

221
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:48,420
No, I got the sticky chopper. I've never had oh nice the golden wrench. Oh my god

222
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,990
The the hand models of me sometimes they're fine

223
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,869
Sometimes they're just totally broken because I'm a soldier and I have medic gloves with my syringe gun

224
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,460
Then I pull out a weird-looking winger and he has normal hands

225
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:07,900
Dude, I'm holding this wrench like a gun and it's like I'm not even touching it. It's like floating in my hand

226
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,279
Who has the century this guy spy with a degreaser?

227
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:21,819
It's floating around like a clown. That is an oxymoron right there spy with a flamethrower

228
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,670
Oh, I am like the child was found missing

229
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,839
They're like hello

230
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,480
What the hell is this? This is the force of nature. I

231
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:44,500
Can I can't even do it? I can't even taunt all right the force of nature the pistol and

232
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:51,750
The Clyde and more crits god. This is I can't even play my head hurts by looking at this

233
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,549
ugliest thing

234
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:08,259
That guy's still standing there all I can see what I'm so confused this guy's just

235
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:18,940
Oh look at this like a sniper with the Liberty launcher the chocolate and the the fan of war all right Liberty launches sniper

236
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,519
This could be interesting and I zoom in every funny good

237
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:36,230
Hold on this guy has it that guy just had the Natasha as a sniper and he was holding it like a sniper rifle shooting

238
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:40,170
Oh my gosh

239
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,890
I'm using the

240
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:46,289
Overdose and if you like reload and shoot at the same time you can just keep shooting forever

241
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:55,200
I was like yeah, like it instantly reloads it all right. Oh wait. No it doesn't actually like shoot

242
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,839
Look at this like pump action like freak out gun. I'm using what else do I have on the pistol?

243
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:04,410
That's boring and what what the hell is this?

244
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:08,759
What the hell is this? Why am I like a monster?

245
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:14,740
What I wish you could have just seen that I had huge like brown

246
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,799
Monster hands

247
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:23,200
It was the engineer who are you playing? What are you doing? I'm a spy with the Ollipool caber

248
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:32,819
I was like sasquatch right there a poco fists is that is that like a fake thing what?

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,740
Say wait just soldier soldier spy turn on but when I say soldier spy I mean like soldier with a with a knife

250
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:55,250
Soldier spy so they've added new crazy funny items huh right engineer with the oh the criticola and the all this is gonna be good

251
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:59,440
Oh, that's awesome. I hope I can stay alive

252
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:05,519
Because this is a great setup is it a soldier of the criticola soldier with a rocket launcher. Oh my

253
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:11,240
Rocket launcher criticola like are you are you shooting me? Oh, no come on

254
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:22,410
He's come on what I didn't even get to use that awesome setup. I just had that pains me

255
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:27,950
It's it's thereby not a does it not have like king of the hill cuz it this would be great for king in the hill

256
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:34,230
I don't think so all right ubersaw frontier justice in Geront

257
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:42,730
Fantastic that has a medigun as a pyro. I'm a medic Tommy slav it looks so like out of place

258
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:50,069
Oh, okay, that's it. Did I kill him I got so the a poco fists are the regular fists

259
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:55,430
But they give people when you crit them. I don't think I was hurting anyone. I was shooting them. It wasn't doing damage

260
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:04,099
Numbers weren't popping up above their head god. This this like makes me so happy like this mode doesn't doesn't just make you like so hell

261
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:14,130
Look at this this guy's like wearing wearing the intelligence like mary poppins like what the hell are you doing?

262
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:23,309
He's bouncing it on his head all right syringe gun and the wrench again, and I built you can't build buildings

263
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:29,099
I forgot well. Well. This is a bloot sauger. I'm dying right now. Are you serious? No?

264
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,089
I'm literally dying right now because I'm happy blue. It's gonna kill me

265
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:35,970
Oh

266
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:44,420
So the blue saga was literally killing oh that was ball, okay?

267
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:49,960
I need German. I need you to tell me what I have all right. We're actually I'm standing outside the spawn door

268
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,119
I just I have no idea what says you have the direct hit the crits Creek and

269
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,440
Also, Chris Creek. Yeah, you have the crits crazy. Let's see what this looks like from my point of view

270
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:05,099
This is retarded. I just saw like two seconds all right. I got the fist. I don't even have a secondary

271
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:13,890
Okay, I don't have a secondary apparently. It's probably the razorback so razorback fists of steel wait. What's fish cake?

272
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:26,839
It's like a reskin of the chocolate. Yeah, this is so why does this look so perfect with the sniper? Oh come?

273
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:39,960
We just got crits too. We got crits. I'm a spy knife read the top of the screen. What's at the top of the screen?

274
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:50,700
Oh, oh god. I am so stupid wow wow wow you uh wow look at how stupid

275
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:58,400
I am it says what you have right there, but that wasn't like right when you spawn it tells you what you have

276
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,970
Oh my god. This is not there. I'm using like a regular pyro set right now

277
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:14,730
I literally have the like a normal active. What do I for a melee golden wrench?

278
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:21,869
I'm a dimmer man with the enforcer and the guns like broken apart and floating well. I got it

279
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:24,750
I got a golden wrench somebody. I don't know. I'm trying to reflect Rockets

280
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:34,300
I don't know what he has called the wrench they turn to a gold statue. Don't know yeah, they do I've never seen

281
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:45,769
Yeah, everyone's like he's like he's a different class and I was standing in the same spot. Oh this person's awesome

282
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:52,420
Why do they keep like capturing the flag so quickly? That's like the kill

283
00:34:54,019 --> 00:35:02,090
Kretsna, oh, that's too funny. I don't know. I don't think I could play this mode a

284
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:10,389
Thousand times and I would probably laugh just as hard every single time. It's just this medic is holding this enforcer light like a

285
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:12,780
like a

286
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,099
Gang member like sideways. I want I want everyone to see just how I picked that up look at this

287
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:23,579
Like oh yeah, let me just spin this giant axe in my hand. It's like a hundred and eighty pounds

288
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,760
Let me just hold it with one hand. It's not even doing any swing animation

289
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:37,420
There's no swing animation with that. This is so odd my brain like cannot handle how this looks

290
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,980
It actually looks like kind of normal to be honest

291
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:47,940
I feel like that's the way like a shotgun would act in somebody's hands like no one

292
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,539
I'm gonna lot of kills with this enforcer. Oh, let me just one second guys

293
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:56,219
Let me spin up my like 200 pound axe in one hand. Let me go cool

294
00:35:56,219 --> 00:36:01,889
Look at look at all useful. This is gonna be come on. I gotta kill him with it

295
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:25,340
Now who keep well, that was weird. No swing animation. You can't tell I got burger boy the insensitive one

296
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:28,260
Burger boy, you can't call for medic man. Nobody has it

297
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:41,280
It could be like a heavy with the damn crits critical the many gun engineer with the Natasha the winger and the atomizer

298
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:47,369
Can I double can I triple jump? I can double jump. I can double jump as the engineer

299
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:55,449
Probably the atomizer. Yeah, I have the atomizer with the ng. I can double jump and I can build building. That's a spy

300
00:36:55,889 --> 00:37:03,769
You I get the cool setup and I die instantly this happens every single day. I turn the corner

301
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:07,750
Oh, that was the spy. So I was going invisible behind people my force of nature

302
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:15,349
Invisible that's crazy term a singer song. That's somebody just said

303
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,789
Come on winger. Oh, let me look. Let me hold. Let me let me just

304
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:23,449
like a little

305
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:31,760
No words can describe that. I can't even make a joke. It's too stupid. Oh god. That's a dead

306
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,800
That's a dying battle right there. I have the revolver

307
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,440
My spy has three hands because I'm holding killing gloves a box and I pull up my cello

308
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,349
Scout with a minigun everyone run for your life

309
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:59,940
Teagle challenges me to a duel. Yeah, I wonder how mad burger boy is right now

310
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:08,659
I bet you burger boy is screaming at his computer screen. I healed for a hundred points as a sniper

311
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:15,889
X-tank, wait, am I holding this backwards? All right. Look at how I'm holding this

312
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:22,869
I could really hurt myself with this thing fish cake. Oh, it still works

313
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:33,690
I will let me launch your fish cake and the backwards extinguisher. Hmm. Yeah, make sure don't drop it on your face

314
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:43,329
I have two shotguns scout a gun of family business. I have the syringe gun of the heavy

315
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:53,599
I don't like this what just even killed me what what I am confused. That was weird

316
00:38:53,719 --> 00:39:03,730
We do do do do do bring up. Oh, that's my favorite dubstep song. How'd you know? I was doing the heavy minigun noise

317
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:19,289
Charge and charge can I charge as a sniper? I can't oh, I can't charge. Damn it. What?

318
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:25,079
Okay, so I'm I'm a spy and all I have is the tribal and shit. I don't have any other item

319
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:33,309
Can you cloak? Yeah, I wish I could charge and charge right there. That would have been hilarious

320
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:39,199
I just spawned and for some reason I spawned with like 350 health overheal. Yeah

321
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,699
I think I think some of the people do something. I think everyone does be honest. I'm spawning over heels

322
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:45,719
I have a rocket jumper

323
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:53,980
I guess no, maybe not everybody bootlegger Razorback. Okay, this is actually a pretty good setup. I know I can't charge

324
00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:03,769
Oh, this sucks. Never mind guys. That's the worst set up ever. I got a razor back though. I can't be back

325
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:10,869
I had Girardi rocket jumper and

326
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,250
Equalizer I can't

327
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:29,539
I'm a spy with a tribal men's ship and that is literally a if you shoot me a duel I'll do you I'll do anybody

328
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:39,699
Why not? Absolutely dead ringer heavy vote for the next map. Let's go to

329
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:47,190
Bad water bad water sounds fun. Alright, so I have I'm a soldier with a big earner and the enforcer

330
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:54,739
Don't work the taunt. I can't do the taunt. Damn it. Taunt doesn't work with this thing. What the hell better off?

331
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:02,280
Yes, I was scotch resistance. I have no idea how this works

332
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,650
Okay, right. Look at that's just pointing straight down into the ground. That's so funny

333
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:15,670
Oh, this thing's great for people to jump in

334
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,860
I don't think I've even seen the guy I'm dueling one time

335
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:37,179
Oh my god, that guy's got so many people that Natasha. All right

336
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:41,820
this will be the last round of the randomizer and then we'll go to one more random server and

337
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:50,420
Oh my god, I'm a medic with the Natasha and a different screen. Well, what do I have for mail?

338
00:41:50,420 --> 00:42:01,300
I didn't even read it. Oh the wrench. Oh, you thought the medic was just gonna be healing didn't you? Oh my god

339
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:09,519
This is so OP. Now. I just switch over get some heels around a little bit

340
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:16,340
I'm a spy running around with heavy fists punching people

341
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,429
Well, I got you. I got your king Dedede. Oh

342
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:38,340
Come on, give me those crits. Come on. Come on. Where is somebody? Oh, this is so insane

343
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:45,929
Medic with a god damn mini gun. Are you serious? And I'm healing people with the crits for you

344
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:50,260
This is ridiculous and I can upgrade and repair buildings

345
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:59,809
Wait, what's the big kill? It's a reskin of the revolver. I have a revolver and I have a pistol

346
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:07,670
I don't even know what he has. What does he have? Let's get the Scottish resistance. Somebody do something

347
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:12,190
Well, what that last like two seconds?

348
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:19,099
I had this thing called a jar of ants is that just I thought it was dry

349
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:23,420
But when I threw it at people they would like taking damage. I never seen that pool. That's weird

350
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:29,599
I get that is healed a thousand points as a pyro. I was I don't think it was that even a pyro

351
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,849
That was weird. Did you did it? Did you did it?

352
00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:42,480
So because I'm a spy I have a wrench and I can't I can either disguise but I can't build anything

353
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:53,570
All right shotgun short-circuit. What what is going on? I'm so confused. This is how he's holding the shotgun. Hold on

354
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:55,269
Hi

355
00:43:55,269 --> 00:44:00,190
So this is that's the reserve. Oh, I have the knife too

356
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:08,400
Okay, I was holding the shotgun down like a minigun and it was like shaking. I couldn't even like tell where I was shooting

357
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,949
All right. So after this we're gonna go to a no, I'm getting the worst things ever

358
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:24,019
Yeah, I got a great one last time the medic medic set up. All right, so bonk it

359
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:32,699
Oh, this is gonna be great bonk a tongue punch. Does it do anything? Am I am I'm invincible, right? Yeah, I am sick

360
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:41,190
I'm getting I'm getting all these pistols. What what?

361
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:51,380
Buffalo steak sandwich to again mini crits and you take mini crits, but you can't use anything but melee that was weird

362
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,860
I'm the no swing animation throws me off cuz I'm just like standing there. I'm like am I even swinging people

363
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:06,039
Oh, it's tied up now. Oh, we don't make it. Wait a minute. How does the widow maker even work?

364
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:10,239
How would the widow maker work? Am I this is infinite ammo? Well, how's this gonna work?

365
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:20,079
I think I just haven't fitted ammo. Oh, no, I can't lose this. No shit. No

366
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:23,079
I really think I just had it fitted in with that thing

367
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:43,699
We're getting my spawn trapped now the front two justice had ten shots and I'm confusing. Oh, man

368
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:50,420
Oh, yeah, I still have metal like yeah. Yeah, I just can't see it. That's still funny. All right

369
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:57,559
We're gonna go one more a random just normal server to play and then we're gonna hop in a CS go

370
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:07,599
Let's do let's find another good server. Sure. Let's try and get a

371
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,460
32 person here we go. Oh, let's go back and turbine

372
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:22,420
No, no, no, no go to dust bowl. That's 30. That's got 32 right now. Yeah, we're gonna do it

373
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,530
There are 32 people can play in this. So this would be the last shebang

374
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:31,210
I gotta give it to burger boy first. Hold on burger boy will like flip out if I don't and

Good old dust ball good old-fashioned dust ball. Oh, it's not randomized

380
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,099
No, this is just a regular. Okay. Oh, yes dust ball my favorite

381
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:07,900
I like dust ball people don't like it, but I like it. I like it after that brass beast game yesterday

382
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:25,650
So my buddy, I'm from Providence. So cool, dude. Good old Rhode Island. I'll go blue. Why not mission begins

383
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:34,860
In 50 seconds, that's what I just said Hobo King. Yeah, I will absolutely do jailbreak

384
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,710
Oh, I have while there's people here

385
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:41,829
I need I need to mention this there is going to be no stream next weekend

386
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:45,519
Because I'm gonna be a Paxi's Paxi's live stream

Well, I bring your computer with you bring everything down that would not that would not happen

388
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,599
I'm going to know stream next week. I just want to be very clear

389
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:00,849
But the good part is I'm gonna get plenty of cool videos at packs and there'll be plenty of cool stuff to see from that

390
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:08,199
So do not worry. So what do you actually do it packs? Cuz I know nothing about game conventions. You just play new games

391
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,880
Um, it's pretty much a good giant

392
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:17,650
It's just a convention where pretty much every developer you can think of is gonna have like an alpha build or a beta build of their

393
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:21,400
Game there and you can kind of they have like playable demos

394
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,079
They have like trailers that you've never before seen stuff and it's just a great place to hang out

395
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,780
There's like a bunch of like free play rooms

396
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,159
They have like a hundred Xboxes a hundred like ps3 is like like a hundred

397
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:38,130
PCs all lined up you just to go in and play with like people that are in the room. Well, it's it's really interesting

398
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:43,269
So, what sort of games can you go and check out or any you're looking forward to checking out?

399
00:48:43,269 --> 00:48:49,139
I don't know man. Not nothing really. I'm trying to think if there's anything I in particular would like to

400
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:53,000
Well, too. Yeah, put what you do portal to last year

401
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,559
I went last year the line for portal to was like an hour and a half long to play the demo and like to see

402
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:00,480
Like the trailer and stuff

403
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:07,760
It was like this enclosed off boxed off room and you couldn't you couldn't get you you couldn't even see what was in there

404
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,760
It was like a closed off like box and they could line went into the box

405
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:22,789
So it was pretty nuts. Do I live near the West End? I do not I do not live in the city

406
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:38,119
I am just outside of the city. Oh a lot of peeps up here. We got a double of a right there. That's spy

Wait, that has a language. Wait, that has yeah. That's really what? Welsh, yeah

That's like no belly. No belly anyone speaks it in this country though. That's crazy. I don't know

439
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:21,619
They had like an actual like I thought they just spoke English. Don't open that door burger boys out there

440
00:54:21,619 --> 00:54:31,920
Oh, it would be bad. It'd be bad if burger boy got in here. I'll close that door. Do not let burger boy in here

441
00:54:34,829 --> 00:54:37,070

447
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:19,639
Probably engineer. I'm like most comfortable playing engineer. I knew you were fake. I could smell ya get off the elevator

448
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:30,219
Oh, I was waiting for him to try and stairs to have me and I got killed either engineer or maybe pyro

449
00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:41,269
Just because pyro is I could probably do what we needed to be done. Hey, I'm pyro. He's not dead. There's no way he's dead

450
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:47,670

We were having a lot of server problems

462
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:10,739
It would be crashing all the time and I don't know we might try and do something else at some point just cuz it was

463
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:23,869
Me is that another spy? I think so. Oh, come on. We can do this. Oh, no, we can't eat the sandwich

464
00:57:23,869 --> 00:57:27,969

469
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,250
What's the worst game ever played?

470
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:30,980
The lens that's a tough one. No, it's definitely not not borderlands not for me

471
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:38,969
I don't know why I'm such a thing against borderlands. I just you've made you bought it like come on

472
00:58:39,969 --> 00:58:41,210

00:59:09,739 --> 00:59:16,820
worst game

477
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:25,429
Recently the worst game I played I can't think of one. I heard that mermaid that

478
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:32,869
Darksiders is it or something like that dark side. We just law we got destroyed. This is something about this

479
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,389
I don't know a new game that came out which is kind of like

480
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:41,179
It was like an indie game. I like Nova did a playthrough on it

481
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,460
I know it's called I am alive. No get him off. Oh

482
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:50,539

486
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:21,460
It's totally bad. How do I do this?

487
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:30,570
What am I doing? No, actually I'll stay online to be honest. I'll do that after me when we switch

488
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:38,670
All right, if we get rolled again, there's not this is not good news. Yeah, get your crits Creek on the pyro now for this

489
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,210

That's a spy holy mine, oh my god

496
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:11,699
Why did I jump down?

497
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:19,260
That's bulls crazy. It's like no respawns to like no respawn delay. We're getting absolutely destroyed right now

498
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:34,289
Oh, yeah, he's still alive. That's by is still alive. All right fall back fall back. Watch your backs too for that spy

01:01:38,469 --> 01:01:43,329
Thank you very much. You are the man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

501
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:49,510

All right, keep the defense keep up the defense. Oh watch them watch the spike app watch this bike app

503
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:08,619
If I could be any class in TF2, I definitely would be the spy

504
01:02:09,019 --> 01:02:12,900
You just go invisible and not die in real life. Yeah, you can just never die

505
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:19,260
I go ahead good shooting the shooting the face. I don't like let you step on a candle or something. I'm fortunate like that

506
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:25,670
Like oh, yeah, you can go ahead and put like three bullets in my head and I'll just deadbringer

507
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:27,340
Oh

508
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:34,860
That Joe was a spy. That'd be really weird. Think about that in real life with the dead ringer, right?

509
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:40,579
Let's say let's say you I you had a gun and I had the dead ringer and you shot me and I had Degrin dead

510
01:02:40,579 --> 01:02:44,460
Ring around so it would drop like a dummy like body of me

511
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,019
But I would still be alive and I what if I like appeared again, would it be the same body?

512
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:52,500
What if you disguised as burger boy, then you went to burger boys house me like hey burger boy. Oh

513
01:02:54,559 --> 01:03:00,610
I just talked to burger boys like parents. Oh, hey. Hey, what's going on? Mr. And Mrs. Burger boy

514
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:13,969

515
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:20,179
I turned I turned around to fight the first spy and I got backstabbed by another spy that came behind me

516
01:03:20,179 --> 01:03:36,369
Oh teams a spy by in the base red spy in the base pie in the base. That's right

517
01:03:36,369 --> 01:03:46,280
No, it's not get her to that spy. That's his bike. No, it's not. I am so conscious right now

518
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:56,980
I'm like freaking out credit to run away. Oh you bastard. He's still alive

519
01:03:57,059 --> 01:04:01,340
We need some we need some serious spray action going on over here. Oh

523
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:56,699
Ah, this is gonna be a losing battle if I don't do this. Oh

524
01:04:57,699 --> 01:05:02,690
I got backstabbed. Oh

525
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:09,719
Yeah, at least we're holding them, right?

526
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:20,070
Is there a spy right here? What's going on there? That was like a freakout session. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go

527
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:27,210
Oh, no, run run run

This could be really bad. Oh, I knew it

534
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:29,860
I was thinking about doing a team fortress one video team fortress classic video

535
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:34,250
I think it'd be funny showing like what it looks like then and what it looks like now. Oh

536
01:06:40,099 --> 01:06:57,079
There's another heavy right there, too. No, do it. I'm struggling. You just did a oh

Get bad. Oh my god, they're gonna spy cap us somebody come back there

539
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:25,030
Really seriously play it. It's just ridiculous. No, we're about to lose. We are

01:07:49,869 --> 01:07:51,710
Own loadouts

We got to get up in that room. They're all up in that room. Well, this is good

545
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,960
This is a low round. Oh

01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:16,220
Yes, this is this is we're putting up a defense right now. Oh, oh my it's you again

01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:22,750
Oh, it's interesting. I actually like I'll just like a movie

01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:26,390
German what movie bad news bears?

555
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:29,569
I

556
01:09:29,569 --> 01:09:35,380
Was like a baseball player and they said hey any baseball player who like thinks they're an actor

557
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:42,029
Like come to this like open audition thing so I'd like try it didn't work

558
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:53,159
Because I was in drama and like middle school so I was like I'm a good actor you could have been a star dude

559
01:09:53,199 --> 01:10:07,979
Who's constant back up back up back up. Whoa look what console just said whoo in the chat or in them

560
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,800
Somebody said oh, so you got a live streamer right now. Well, thanks for choosing the QQ buffet. Oh

561
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:25,899
You are very welcome. Oh, we're going in over coming in watch it watch it right when they turn it cool

562
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:35,100
Oh, oh well

563
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:39,100
Oh, no, so this is like a legit stalemate right now

564
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:43,550
I think because I want to get see it's going so we might have to like

565
01:10:44,109 --> 01:10:51,979
16 on 16. Yeah, this is just a this is just a totally balanced game right now. No respawn delays on dustbowl

566
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:12,810
I'm gonna go we got a ton of engineers do which you know, I can't no no change which it either

567
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:21,539
Oh, I hear the fan. See your fan just turn on mine. I just heard

568
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:27,930
And I was probably yours. She probably was mine. You're right. No, it's fine mine

569
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:38,819
Oh my look at the three bags my god run run away

570
01:11:39,619 --> 01:11:57,159
Run away after I think afterburn you could you could tweak afterburn a little bit make it a little more balanced

571
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,800
Maybe you'd make a shorter duration but more damage

572
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:05,430
So like instead of like 10 seconds or whatever it is make it like four or five seconds

573
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:10,189
But have it do more damage a little bit more damage. It's okay in its current form though

574
01:12:10,189 --> 01:12:14,310
I think I don't think it's that it's not that bad. Oh my god. Oh

575
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:26,369
You got it. Hello. Hello, mr. Medic. How are you?

576
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:31,060
I

577
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:36,840
Like how he just stood there while like we put mines all over him

578
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:54,529
No backstab. I'm gonna go I'm going scalp at the end here. This is such a difficult game to win

579
01:12:54,529 --> 01:13:00,739
Oh my god, but I don't think I've seen you once. No, I've been I keep getting killed by Jemma

580
01:13:03,029 --> 01:13:15,060
Stop being so selfish. I want kills too. I just mean I got like I was like octo heavy for this like whole thing

581
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:27,439
Two or three medics on me not anymore though. I'm saying as to scoot. No

582
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:47,630
Imagine a team of 16 spies all just cloaked sneak on the point and at the same time all decloak and capture

583
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:53,170
I was gonna say imagine that and like they they just like pretend that they're the other team

584
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:59,640
Super spy check mode super spy check

585
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:14,609
Oh, it took me so long to get ahead of you. Oh man, dude, look at look at the

586
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:23,239
Metals, that's ridiculous. I feel I want to like switch to blue. I can't though

587
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:36,199
Oh my yeah, the domination like things nice headshot sick. Come on blue. Oh

588
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,800
stealth

589
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,359
Come on blue man 61

590
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:57,920
Ready to charge doctor. Oh, they got a big century back there now tables good turn right now

591
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:01,760
You guys got a good uber good like push coming tables

592
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:09,119
Um, not too sure about the uber is that uber charge, but are you sure about the push?

593
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,899
Confidence is growing slightly. I'm standing in the tunnel not taking damage

594
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:23,920
What about burger boy just stand here burger boy

595
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:34,500
I think it's nothing good about this team. Oh burger boy burger boy

596
01:15:34,899 --> 01:15:42,100
There's nothing good. Yes stuff at last

597
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:46,189
There's nothing good about this team

598
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:08,229
Fire I wish I could hear that but I have my voice chat turned off

599
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:16,670
That would be funny to be able to watch that burger boy. There's nothing really upset

600
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:18,539
All right

601
01:16:18,539 --> 01:16:20,539
So burger boy on a scale of 1 to 10

602
01:16:20,579 --> 01:16:26,710
10 being like like you will like rip down your house like burn your house down and one being like

603
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:30,229
I guess I'm like kind of mad how like pissed off are you right now?

604
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:38,460
I bet you it's at least a seven or an eight. Oh, let's speak. Let's be quiet so we can hear his answer

605
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,100
I can't hear it. So it's you're gonna have to relay it to me

606
01:16:47,829 --> 01:17:00,550
Actually, maybe he's not even listening to the stream. No, maybe he forgot. I was screaming. Oh, they got that. Where's that spies right there?

607
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:04,140
Oh my gosh

608
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:06,470
What do you say? What is that?

609
01:17:08,869 --> 01:17:15,319
Is that what he thought damn it I wish I could have my I need to turn it on hold on

610
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:29,909
Oh my god. All right. All right, you can tell him to do it again burger boy. Do it again burger boy rage again

611
01:17:29,909 --> 01:17:50,220
Is he gonna do it? Oh, no, he's not like actually bad. I wish I caught that on video. Oh, you're losing burger boy

612
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:56,319
It's over. Oh look at it. It's it's all over. Let's see what he says. Hold on. Here it comes

613
01:17:56,319 --> 01:18:07,829
Oh, what do you say about that burger boy? And what cuz I want no I want him to like flip out. He's silent

614
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:15,539
Yeah, but I did he's still here. No, he's not yeah

615
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:19,489
Alright, I'm gonna transition to

616
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:26,119
CS go. Thanks for coming. No, you're not allowed to come. Yeah

617
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:52,029
All right, let me um, let me try and figure out how to do CS go could be sort of difficult

618
01:18:52,029 --> 01:19:00,899
I'm gonna do windowed mode. It's gonna take maybe a few seconds. Give me a minute guys counter-strike global effects

619
01:19:00,899 --> 01:19:08,539
All right screens gonna go black for 20 or 30 seconds

620
01:19:08,539 --> 01:19:13,760
I'm still here. Don't worry. Oh, no black screen. Oh

621
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:26,270
What do we do? It's a black screen. Oh burger boy. You're listening right now after we play this for like 20 or 30 minutes

622
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:35,779
We're going to McDonald's. We're going to get double cheeseburgers. I hope you know that video settings

623
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:39,399
We are going to be playing in

624
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:43,159
windowed

625
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:45,079
1280 by 7

626
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:48,619
I think I'm gonna go and play Call of Duty 4 so I'll drop out the

627
01:19:48,939 --> 01:19:52,920
Job out the chat, but I'll see I'll still listen to the stream. Okay, that's cool

628
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:59,739
Yeah, I can do I know what you're saying at all times stuff

629
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:08,640
If you're back later and happy days, but enjoy CS go

630
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:14,439
Thanks. Thanks for coming boo. Thank you. Bye. No, all righty

631
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:22,770
So we're gonna try and we're gonna play some CS go gonna play some gun game

632
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:28,800
And if you're more than if you have this you're more than welcome to try and join in off of me or if stealth is

633
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,800
appearing online him it's gonna be difficult

634
01:20:31,239 --> 01:20:36,460
it's gonna be kind of difficult to get everyone in the game because it's um

635
01:20:36,819 --> 01:20:44,130
Wait valve confirms that meet the pyro is already done and ready. Holy crap

636
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:54,079
That means we're gonna get it soon unless we don't unless it doesn't happen. Yeah, at least we don't get it

637
01:20:56,710 --> 01:21:01,550
Someone like sneak like I would steal that if I like work for valve and put it on the internet

638
01:21:07,159 --> 01:21:10,760
Yeah, you probably would get fired that would not be good

639
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:24,590
You guys can hardly they're they're quiet. Are they still quiet who they are like me. Apparently you guys are quiet

640
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:30,960
I don't know why I just try to turn you up. That's odd

641
01:21:31,479 --> 01:21:35,109
Did you did you did it? So this is gun game?

642
01:21:35,109 --> 01:21:40,960
This is like legit like gun game was it like that the whole time or was it like that?

643
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:47,050
Just for uh for when I changed over was it like that during tf2 as well. Oh

644
01:21:55,510 --> 01:22:06,100
Get gun games

645
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:12,500
Also, they so they were both low really really low for the team the team borders or just at the end there

646
01:22:12,579 --> 01:22:21,010
That's weird the whole time. No someone they were saying it's like the end of team for just to probably when I transitioned over

647
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:29,020
Oh, oh, yeah. So this is the gun game. This is my favorite thing about this game. I love gun game

648
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:33,800
I can't handle the kid

649
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:39,489
Thanks for the feedback guys. I appreciate it because I I try to it's hard to make it

650
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:43,489
Sometimes explet is weird and they just lower the volume of everybody

651
01:22:43,489 --> 01:22:47,930
I don't know why but so thanks for uh, thanks for being here to be able to tell me what's going on

652
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:56,270
So if you don't know what this is every time you get a kill every single time you kill somebody you

653
01:22:56,550 --> 01:23:01,470
Get you get a different gun and I think it's 26 or 27 kills

654
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:15,750
I don't know the nice healthy stuff is the worst counter-strike play ever. I must have to in general doon-doon-doon-doon-doon

655
01:23:15,869 --> 01:23:26,260
No, it's fine. Oh, I'm not standing still don't look at me. That's off of his prime

656
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:38,140
Optimus Prime. Oh, he's dead. Oh, I'm gonna get behind. Oh damn it. This is still in beta

657
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:38,380
Yep

658
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:44,939
So as you see when I kill somebody else see if I can show you right when I kill somebody the instant I do it

659
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:51,569
I'm gonna switch a gun. It's gonna go to something else. This is the like shotgun type thing

660
01:23:51,569 --> 01:24:01,550
Oh, I'd love to show them that example, too, but I can't get a kill to switch my gun

661
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:05,729
Hey, well, you're not really on the screen. I was just saying ah

662
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:13,279
Yeah, we're this is PC. I don't this is not really even getting developed right now for consoles

663
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:18,479
I think they're doing that later. Yeah, I think it's actually co-developed for car. I could be totally wrong

664
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:27,390
I'm not sure on that. Oh, well, that's that's how you miss three times point-blank

665
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:33,899
Well, that was the auto shotgun somebody's already reached knife level

666
01:24:33,899 --> 01:24:36,979
So once you go through all the guns once you get like 27 kills

667
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:42,840
You you use a knife and you have to knife somebody and if you knife them the game's over and you win

668
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:50,260
Well, whatever team had the person knifing. Thanks

669
01:24:50,779 --> 01:25:04,140
Come on, keep you going. Damn it. Ah, oh, that's game. Oh, so do you want ways MLC still?

670
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:10,760
At the bottom of the league of boards. Yeah, this is definitely the best mode in Counter-Strike

671
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:15,640
No, in my opinion it used to be a mod then they made it like an actual game mode. It's so fun

672
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:20,649
Hey, what do you mean go go see teeth? What up? What a delic?

673
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:24,600
Yeah, I mean the streams been going for like an hour and a half now

674
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,560
So if some of you guys got to go you got to go. Thanks for coming. Appreciate it

675
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:31,789
Oh, I love this map. I love this map. This is a map. Shibby was like losing his mind on

676
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:45,069
There's only two maps. Oh, I love this one. Oh, that's right. There's only two maps. What oh no bullets

677
01:25:45,149 --> 01:25:53,119
Wait, didn't there used to be a map? There is where it's in the top left. What are you talking about?

678
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:55,279
Oh, cuz there's nothing up there for me. Oh

679
01:25:56,359 --> 01:25:59,880
Well, you must have been glitching out. Oh, there it is. It just came out there dad

680
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:06,770
Oh, I got a headshot from across the map. Well, I'm gonna make a ton of vids and packs man

681
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:16,699
It's gonna mean me and taxis are gonna be best friends when it comes to videos. I'm in trouble. No

682
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:28,800
Running the bullets burger boy has a YouTube channel. He's his first video is gonna be going up and like probably like 15 months

683
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,359
Oh

684
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:54,779
Show yourself. I gotta get a good string together. Oh, come on. Damn

685
01:26:54,779 --> 01:27:06,880
I hear these people in the chat saying like this game of sucks. No way

686
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:16,090
Let's get this is the most fun game mode on don't see us know what our teammates here Sam

687
01:27:16,090 --> 01:27:27,119
Oh really that is goomba stomp that guy. I don't think I did. I mean we had that conversation last night

688
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:29,119
We were like, can you goomba stomp? What's going on here?

689
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:34,090
Cuz it said I like damage the teammate when I land on top of them. Oh my god

690
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:45,479
Can't believe it how many bullets does it take? Yeah, my favorite gun in CS

691
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:55,760
Go is probably the shotgun. He just regular shotgun. I love that thing. Oh, come on this thing

692
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:01,600
This is my favorite gun in CS right now. I love this thing. Unfortunately when I get one kill that it's going away

693
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:11,550
No, I'll see it's gone. I don't know how you get kills in this

694
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:20,279
No one dies when I shoot them is the auto shoddy P90 is awesome, too

695
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:26,739
Everything is pretty balanced in this game. There's way too many of them over there. No way I was gonna do that

696
01:28:26,899 --> 01:28:37,539
I'm the worst counter-strike player. I literally don't think it's the worst one

697
01:28:37,539 --> 01:28:44,899
You know, it's it's tough playing this game in a window. It is very hard to do this. My like my my hands look so tiny

698
01:28:44,899 --> 01:28:59,060
It's like yeah, I'm little baby. I can't believe I didn't kill him. Do I like pretzels? I love pretzels rolled gold, baby

699
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:06,430
I'm doing absolutely terrible right now terrible. I wish I could full screen this

700
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:16,689
All right, X split make it so I can full screen my game first problem. There's no hats second problem

701
01:29:16,689 --> 01:29:20,880
No hats third problem. No lasers

702
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:25,470
fourth problem

703
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:42,039
Oh my gosh, that killed me. I'm sorry. I got already on the line machine gun. I was doing pretty well last night

704
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:55,869
Oh, thank you. The game's already over. No, no, she's I'm yeah, that's Alex. I know just saying

705
01:29:56,189 --> 01:30:03,170
Please the asses is over. He's in the yeah, what where is he? Why is he not a mod doesn't make any sense

706
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:13,159
We don't we don't trust him after I would have after what happened I'm gonna go tea go tea go terrace after I got into the

707
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:18,439
cookie jar

708
01:30:18,439 --> 01:30:26,899
Okay, really? Oh, well, I'm a moron. No, I'm not shooting. I'm shooting my own teammates up

709
01:30:26,899 --> 01:30:34,130
Oh, I thought I was gonna get him. I got it. I gotta get in tryhard mode now

710
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:47,039
I want to get a good game tryhard mode activate three and two. Let's go

711
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:52,079
I want to be at least one to two. I didn't kill him

712
01:30:52,439 --> 01:31:02,489
Gotta get that gun game gotta get that gun game up. I didn't see that guy

713
01:31:02,489 --> 01:31:14,649
I got it blended in with the background. Let's go. Let's go. Keep it moving. Keep it moving here. Keep it moving

714
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:22,560
Okay, I literally think I'm doing 99% damage to people and then other people are just taking the last shot

715
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:34,659
Well, LL Cool J in here. Let me see if I can speak up on it. We go. There we go

716
01:31:34,659 --> 01:31:45,420
So that's what I'm talking about. Now we're now we're going now we're going strong do

717
01:31:53,779 --> 01:31:55,779
Moving keep it moving here. Keep it moving. Oh

718
01:31:57,380 --> 01:32:04,750
Eggs, I gotta try hard like an egg. How do you have 14 freaking points?

719
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:24,970
I went to try hard boy. Didn't I tell you I'm not messing around anymore. No more messing around dude sniper rifle

720
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:36,100
Let's get one. Hey shaboom. Where is it? 18 and 8? Come on

721
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:42,159
Give me like 10 more kills in a row, baby. Be careful with this light machine gun, dude

722
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:46,859
Oh, that was that wasn't killing. Ah

723
01:32:53,380 --> 01:33:02,460
Come on. It's hard when you get to the pistols. It gets difficult. This is where it gets really difficult

724
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:05,199
It gets difficult when you're using any gun in this

725
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:26,500
Trying to pull up a headshot not gonna happen. Oh, come on now. Come on now. Oh

01:33:28,579 --> 01:33:50,920
Oh, I had it. I had it. Come on. Let me win this round. No crap in my pants. No, this is not good

727
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:57,569
I gotta find a way around damn it. All right, I'm gonna someone over here

728
01:33:57,569 --> 01:34:03,649
Oh, I can't believe I didn't hit in the face losing it now. I'm losing it

729
01:34:03,649 --> 01:34:11,880
I had it had it for a little bit. No, I'm gonna lose it. I'm gonna lose it

730
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:28,600
I was so far ahead. I gotta kick off somebody. I'm going this way, man. There we go

731
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:35,670
Finally got out of that stupid pistol. Now. I got the dual Berettas dude. Oh this guy

732
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:42,880
I'm gonna make this guy's day bad this egg over here. Where would this egg go? He's had a clean shot on that egg

733
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:55,439
Oh my god, I can't believe I didn't do it. That was a lucky spawn. Did I get it again?

734
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:05,770
Yeah, I did it. Oh, yeah. I can't believe I won the game. That's the first time that's ever happened

735
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:17,210
This game's so hard. I just made them rage quit. Yeah, that's the first time I've ever done that

736
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:26,029
Wow, that was a I wish I was like I wish I was like recording that because it's probably not gonna happen again

737
01:35:26,029 --> 01:35:30,359
Well, you kind of were recording that

738
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:36,779
I own Battlefield 3 so do not you don't don't please do not get Battlefield 3 for me

739
01:35:36,779 --> 01:35:44,289
I appreciate the gesture though. Like thank you so much for even considering doing that, but I have Battlefield 3

740
01:35:44,289 --> 01:36:00,810
Oh boo, did you see my I just won did you see it was for you? Yeah, but I'm I don't it's gonna be

741
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:09,100
360 I guess I could use it. I could use that. Oh you bastard Optimus Prime

742
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:13,300
Hey, what do you know? Optimus Prime has the knife in this game and he's wicked good with it

743
01:36:15,239 --> 01:36:17,239
Coincidence I don't think so

744
01:36:25,449 --> 01:36:39,500
Give me that headshot. Give me that headshot. Oh, no. Oh

745
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:47,479
All right. I'm I I quit the game you left

746
01:36:48,000 --> 01:37:00,710
Optimus Prime spits in the hill. Oh, I guess he's wicked good counter-strike source. Did I say source?

747
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:05,119
I meant counter-strike go stealth can't take it. Oh

748
01:37:11,989 --> 01:37:20,680
Jump down. I was doing alright in the beginning. I was doing alright

749
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:27,270
See if I can come back to life here what how does how does that make any sense?

750
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:38,039
How I killed that guy did I shoot him through the grate and how the hell did that happen?

751
01:37:38,039 --> 01:37:45,359
Yeah, I'm not sure how much money it'll be I was assuming it won't be more than 50 bucks

752
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:57,479
It probably wouldn't be more than 40. I bet you it's I'm gonna say 30 bucks. That's my prediction again

753
01:37:57,479 --> 01:38:00,880
I could be totally wrong really depends on what kind of strategy they want to go for

754
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:26,329
No, Steve stop killing people. I can't see what gun you have. Oh, this is gonna be tough sniper

755
01:38:26,329 --> 01:38:29,970
I'm gonna have to like cool. I'm gonna have to like call of duty quickscope somebody. Oh

756
01:38:35,829 --> 01:38:44,989
Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Where'd he go? How did I not hit him? There we go

757
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:58,600
LMG is that the real burger boy? You better believe it. You better believe Oh

758
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:26,560

759
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:50,750
Damn it 22 somebody's already at the knife level. It might end right now. That's over

760
01:39:50,789 --> 01:39:58,439
It is over the TKO. I believe he's the one that got it. Good game. Oh

761
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:08,460
All right. I think I'm uh, I'm gonna hop out of CS go now just wanted to play I got that

762
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:15,239

01:40:15,239 --> 01:40:22,750

773
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:41,010
Here we go. Just get good enough at the game so we can hear the music in the background

774
01:41:41,130 --> 01:41:42,409
That's never gonna happen

775
01:41:42,409 --> 01:41:53,800
I will never get good enough at this game for that to not happen co-op looks like grandpa trying to walk when he has no

Crutches. Oh, but I almost did a legit back foot. That was sick. Oh good. Thanks for reminding me woodadelic
