00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,080
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:22,379
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Scout with the Default Scout Gun and a bunch of other stuff that's in the other slots.

3
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:25,379
But anyways, guys, we're gonna talk about a couple things here.

4
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,379
Not really to do- Oh, I just burped in my side of my head.

5
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:33,380
You ever do that? You ever like burp inside your head while you're talking and you like-

6
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,380
Especially in a conversation with somebody. Can I just talk about this for a second?

7
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,689
When you get in a conversation with someone and you like burp in their face but you try so hard not to do it

8
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:47,689
and you have that face and you put your chin down and you're like, yeah, I'm not a fucking alien.

9
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:50,689
I hate that. And that just happened. Good thing you didn't see my face.

10
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:53,689
Anyways, I wanna talk about creativity.

11
00:00:53,689 --> 00:01:00,179
I wanna talk about how to stay creative, how to stay motivated, and how I do it myself.

12
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:05,180
Because obviously this channel, this whole YouTube thing, is me just sort of expressing myself

13
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,180
and expressing my views and trying to make you guys laugh, trying to have fun and games with some friends.

14
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,420
This whole thing can be shaped around how I feel about creativity.

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,859
And right off the bat, we're gonna talk about the most important thing I see when it comes to being creative.

16
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:23,099
And it's not forcing it to happen.

17
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,459
I get PMs and comments sometimes, people asking me,

18
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:28,459
Jerma, where do you come up with these ideas for videos?

19
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:32,459
How do you come up with these ideas? How do you come up with these voices and characters?

20
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:38,939
And really, it's just things that just happen while you're playing a certain game or while you're doing a certain thing

21
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,939
or while you're writing a certain song.

22
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:42,939
Never force creativity.

23
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:47,120
It has to come to you. It has to come like a eureka effect.

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,120
Not the wrench, like the light bulb, like Edison.

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,120
It has to come to you and it has to really show itself.

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,120
And if it doesn't show itself, you have to let it. You can't force it.

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,120
There's been a million times, guys, I can't even tell you the amount of times

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,120
where I've wanted to make something, I've wanted to create something,

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,120
and I just can't do it.

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,120
And I'm sitting there at my desk and I'm going, damn it, man.

31
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,120
I want to make this idea work. I want to do this. I want to do that.

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,419
But I just can't do it right now.

33
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:16,419
Take a step back and take a break.

34
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:18,659
Take a step back and take a break.

35
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:21,659
Because you're gonna be in bed that night or two nights later,

36
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:23,659
and your eyes are gonna open. You're gonna go,

37
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,219
yeah, Bob Dylan needs to ride a T-Rex into the sun in the future.

38
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:30,219
That has to happen. Like, bang, I got it.

39
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:33,780
And I'm not just talking about things that, you know,

40
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,780
are mostly associated with creativity.

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,780
Like, you know, writing songs and writing screenplays and making videos.

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,780
You can take this into any type of situation

43
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,090
where there's some type of thought process that has to go into it.

44
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,389
You can take this process into test-taking in school.

45
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:52,389
Don't just sit there and stare at your screen

46
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,699
while you're trying to learn about, like, biology.

47
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:57,189
Go look at a fucking frog.

48
00:02:57,189 --> 00:02:59,189
There's tons of them out by the pond.

49
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,620
Skip some rocks. Talk to some birds.

50
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,800
Make a big, write in a diary.

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I don't know. Does anybody keep a diary anymore?

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Probably not. Maybe you do. But if you do, then that's good.

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
But you understand, right?

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,229
Let it come naturally. Don't force it.

55
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:16,229
Because when you force it, that's when you get pissed.

56
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,229
And when you start to get angry, anger leads to hate.

57
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:21,229
Hate leads to suffering.

58
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:23,229
Suffering leads to therapy.

59
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:25,229
Leads to Antarctica.

60
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:29,229
Whatever that little green guy says in Star Wars.

61
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:32,229
This has been a very strange video.

62
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:34,229
I'm just, like, ranting all over the place.

63
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:36,229
But really, though, we're gonna move on to point number two.

64
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:38,229
If there even was a point in this video, then listen up.

65
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:42,050
The best way you can come up with some ideas.

66
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,050
And I'm not kidding. This is not a joke.

67
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,050
Don't take this as a joke.

68
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,479
It's gonna sound like a joke, but don't take it as that.

69
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,979
In the bathroom.

70
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:54,219
When you are in the bathroom taking a dump,

71
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:58,219
that is, like, the best place to ever come up with any ideas

72
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:00,219
or any problem-solving.

73
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:03,219
Do you wanna know why there's a statue of that guy,

74
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:06,219
the thinker, sitting down with his fist on his chin?

75
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:08,219
He's taking a dump. He's on the can.

76
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:11,219
There's no doubt in my mind that that guy was sculpted

77
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,840
inside of his bathroom.

78
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,839
You can't find a better place that is a private setting

79
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,839
for just complete personal thought

80
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,839
than when you're on the bathroom doing your business

81
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,839
or when you're in the shower.

82
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,839
And the shower is another great one, guys.

83
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,839
If you're ever trying to figure out something or do something

84
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,839
or, damn it, I wish I could just come up with something,

85
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,839
get in the shower, turn the heat up a little bit.

86
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,839
Don't get it too hot so you get, like, hurt.

87
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,839
But turn the heat up a little bit, get a little bit of steam

88
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,839
in that room, and just breathe it in and just relax.

89
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,839
And you'll come out of that shower, you'll shake your hair

90
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,839
or whatever, and you'll be like,

91
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,839
holy shit, E equals MC squared.

92
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,839
I did it.

93
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,399
But in all seriousness, it really does help.

94
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,399
I know there's probably some psychological reason

95
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,579
why we feel very comfortable in our bathrooms.

96
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,579
And it has to be said, it definitely has something to do

97
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:00,579
with the privacy and nobody can really come in

98
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:02,579
and you can lock the door and just kind of chill out in there

99
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,579
for a little bit.

100
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:04,579
It's something to do.

101
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:05,579
I don't know.

102
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:06,579
If you're a psychologist, let me know.

103
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:07,579
But that's gonna wrap up this video, guys.

104
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:10,579
Just a quick little sort of a rant, but not really.

105
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:13,579
I don't even remember how this video started.

106
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,579
All I know is I'm here now.

107
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:16,579
So thank you all so much for watching.

108
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:17,579
I really do appreciate it.

109
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:20,579
And get those problem-solving creative minds going on the can.

110
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:21,579
Telling you.

111
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:23,939
See you guys all next time.

112
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:24,939
Take care, everybody.

113
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:26,569
Get out!
