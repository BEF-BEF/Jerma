00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:08,410
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary and tonight

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:15,109
gonna be playing as the... So what I want to talk about today guys is a few things and uh

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,089
some things are really bad in this video some of the things we're gonna talk about are not cool

4
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:25,289
but you gotta deal with it you have to deal with these problems if you are going to have a computer

5
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,449
that is custom built that's just it's just things like this are going to happen so

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,289
let's start from the very beginning here you probably watched the video from like two or three

7
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:37,609
weeks ago where I was like building a supercomputer going to the micro center gonna get a bunch of

8
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:44,820
parts it's gonna be so sick and I did that and I had it built and the thing like shit the bed

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,219
last night like that I had a motherboard problem last night I don't know what's going on I think

10
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,700
the motherboard might be bad it might be a crappy I don't know I don't know all I know is that it

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:00,579
doesn't work and I'm currently recording this on my laptop so if this video is not 1080p I

12
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:05,379
sincerely apologize I'm gonna try to do it so it really could be 1080p it might not it might not

13
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,659
but it might be now if you've been following this whole me showing pictures of it me talking about

14
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:14,900
it then you you'll know that when you get when you run into a problem like this with a computer

15
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,019
when you have an issue if you custom build a computer if you have somebody build it for you

16
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:23,400
whatever whatever if you have a custom built pc when you run into a problem like this you want to

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,359
just pick the thing up and like spike it through a fucking window like that last night when this

18
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:33,000
was happening and it was like 12 hours were going by I was having so many problems I was trying to

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,920
figure out what the hell was going on doing everything I could possibly think of and nothing

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,920
was working I couldn't get anything to really work the way I wanted it to and it was just a

21
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,400
nightmare and if this thing had a tail if this computer had a tail I would have grabbed it spun

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,319
around a bunch of times and just let go and shut up into whatever it was gonna fucking run into

23
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:59,500
it was that close good thing I didn't install a tail on this pc and actually I just thought of

24
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,609
something what if you took what if you took a computer bear with me for a second what if

25
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:08,949
you took a computer and you put a little tail on it and then you gave it ears on the front

26
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:14,120
and put whiskers on the front too so it was like a giant like mouse that would be pretty funny

27
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,520
wouldn't it or am I this is just totally just inaccurate but that probably wouldn't be funny

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,539
at all all right forget it but the computer is currently being fixed it's going to be fine in

29
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:28,180
probably a day or so I just haven't really been able to do very much this last couple of days

30
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,819
which sucks because I got a whole lot of stuff going on there's a whole lot of videos I'm making

31
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,860
in the process of I was in the process of making them before the video dumped to the bed like

32
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,340
dumped its pants and shit its diaper in the bed like I there are at least a few videos and thank

33
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,009
god that I backed up all this stuff if you guys have never seen my video on backing up your hard

34
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:52,629
drive then go watch it well you don't really even have to go watch it just back up your hard drives

35
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:58,550
with information you don't want to lose because if I had lost a bunch of this stuff for videos

36
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:05,379
that I'm currently working on right now like I don't even know I can't even imagine my

37
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:12,259
infuriation if that would were to happen anyways we're gonna move on we're gonna talk about the

38
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:16,259
second thing I wanted to bring up in this video which is a little better and a little nicer and

39
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,539
a little more uplifting than the previous few minutes or a couple minutes and that's the tf2

40
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:26,819
mix-up tf2 mix-up number six I got to be a part of this year so it was really really cool really

41
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,219
awesome if you don't know what the tf2 mix-up is they get a bunch of youtubers and some gaming

42
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:35,860
developers a couple people from valve end up showing up and we play matches against each other

43
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,939
and it's all recorded it's all captured and it's all for charity so I was able to be a part of it

44
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:45,460
this year I was actually on captain sparkles team a link will be in the description if you want to

45
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,659
watch the videos that were recorded during this segment of time we were playing for the mix-up

46
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:54,580
there's going to be I think three or four different rounds that sparkles is going to

47
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:00,979
be uploading so if you want to check if you want to check out the perspective from our end our team

48
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:04,419
go to sparkles channel go to that video that's going to be in the description there'll be a

49
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:09,139
link there you can't miss it you're going to take a right on second street if you see the mcdonald's

50
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:12,900
you went too far and then take a left at those lights and you're going to be a captain sparkles

51
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,660
channel so that's where you want to go if you want to see that and we're going to move on to

52
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:23,259
talk about something else in this video is the fact that holiday crates are dropping now

53
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,860
holiday crates are dropping all over the place I just got some I don't even I might even have

54
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,860
gotten one in this video I don't even know if I show the death or not and I think they've been

55
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,740
dropping for a little over a week I think December 6th is when they were added so like a week and a

56
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:42,060
few days since they have been dropping but what this means the initial hypothesis that we are

57
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,819
going to be getting three updates in three months is actually potentially going to come true so we

58
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:53,579
are probably going to see the holiday christmas miss miss whatever you want to call it tf2 update

59
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:59,339
fairly soon here and everybody can cross their fingers and hope that we get some pretty cool

60
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:05,509
stuff because there really has never been a holiday themed tf2 update that didn't give us

61
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:11,189
something cool they've always introduced at least a couple of new weapons at least a couple of new

62
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:15,910
maps or new modes they have there but they've always released something cool for the christmas

63
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:22,870
and holiday season so here's hoping that these holiday crates coming around is a sign that the

64
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,660
update is sort of looming and with that that is going to wrap up the video thank you all so much

65
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:34,899
for watching I really do appreciate it stay tuned for the holiday animation video that I was talking

66
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:40,339
about that should be ready to roll here in the next week or so I think I touched upon this

67
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:44,819
once but I'll reiterate it one more time there's going to be an animation on the channel it's going

68
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,699
to be a grandpa video it's going to be grandpa animated that's all I'm going to say I'm not going

69
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:54,100
to say anything more about it you'll just see it in your sub box when you see it a lot of time has

70
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,300
gone into this the animator has been spending a ton of his time putting it together and I hope you

71
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,300
guys enjoy it you'll see it when you see it so that's it everybody thanks for watching everybody

72
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:12,459
just appreciate it and I'll see you guys all next time and of course take care everybody I did I

73
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:17,579
just did that because um I don't have any like the files the sound files or the photoshop files

74
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:21,670
they're probably not even a thumbnail on this video either and you know I because I don't have

75
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,310
the files okay well bye
