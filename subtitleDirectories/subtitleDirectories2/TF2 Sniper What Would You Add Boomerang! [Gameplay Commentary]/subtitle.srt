00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,759
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,760
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Sniper with the... no, no, that was... I almost said the Machina.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,760
With the Heatmaker, the... Darwin's Danger Shield? I god damn it, I just don't remember.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
I think... I actually think it's the Razorback because there are a lot of spies on the other team.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,760
And the Tribalman Shiv.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,939
So this video, we're gonna talk about... I started this sort of little mini-series a while ago, and I never really followed up on it.

7
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,939
So today, we're gonna follow up on it. It is, what would I add into Team Fortress 2?

8
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:47,939
And we're gonna be covering the Sniper today, because I'm playing as the Sniper.

9
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,939
And of course, I wanna get your guys' opinions on all this stuff. Last time, when I talked about the Engineer,

10
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:56,939
we had a really, really good discussion going in the comments section, so do that again.

11
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:00,939
Whatever you'd like to see added for the Sniper, or what you think would be cool for the Sniper.

12
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:06,939
Whether it's a melee secondary or a new primary, please put it in the comments section. Let's keep that going.

13
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:12,939
So, talking about the Sniper, of course, he has his primary, which is the Sniper Rifle.

14
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:18,939
And they didn't really deviate that much, except for the Huntsman. The Huntsman is a huge deviation from his typical primary.

15
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:21,939
And that's kind of where I wanna go here.

16
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:27,939
And it's something that a lot of people have actually talked about, and I think there is a Steam Workshop item of this.

17
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:32,939
And I think it is an incredible idea, and they really should think about implementing this.

18
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,939
It is a Boomerang primary. Not a secondary, a Boomerang primary.

19
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:45,370
And after sitting here for about 45 minutes or so, just thinking about it and talking about what I'm gonna do with this commentary to myself,

20
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,370
I've come up with this. And let me know what you guys think about this.

21
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:53,370
I'm not sure if this is 100% the best thing that could possibly be for this item, but it's what I think would be cool.

22
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:59,370
So, you cock it back. Let's say you have it in your left hand. You come out of spawn, and there's a Demoman 50 yards in front of you on the enemy team.

23
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,370
You cock it back, and there's a bar in the lower right that fills up.

24
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:09,610
Once that thing's filled up, it's gonna go max distance, and maybe it would mini-crit if you filled that bar up all the way.

25
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:15,610
And the bar wouldn't be just one second. I would think it would be something around two or three full seconds before you got a mini-crit.

26
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,610
Therefore, making it not just an easy weapon, just a bang, bang, bang, just get mini-crits over and over again with this thing.

27
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,610
So picture this. A Demoman is coming at you, and he's spamming his stickies at you.

28
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,610
He's shooting his grenade launcher at you. You fall back, you're charging this thing up, you whip around, you throw it,

29
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,610
and maybe you're taking it off to the side a little bit to try and compensate for the curve that would be happening.

30
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:43,610
Because how I picture this is the weapon comes out straight, and then kind of takes a curve and swings over to the right-hand side,

31
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,610
making skill shots available for you to do.

32
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:54,099
And to keep discussing this skill shot idea, maybe instead of, throw away the mini-crit idea I just came up with,

33
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,099
what if instead of holding the button down gave you crits?

34
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:05,099
Think of that bar filling up, that's the arc. The more you hold it down, the more insane arc you are going to get,

35
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,099
and maybe it could go through people rather than just hitting one.

36
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:13,469
And TF2 really does need more stuff like this in the game.

37
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:18,469
I know they're harder to balance because if you have five rocket launchers with a soldier,

38
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:24,469
and then you come up with a soldier rifle, you're redesigning the whole class from the ground up, essentially.

39
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:29,469
But they are so cool, and it gives a much more variety-based gameplay.

40
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:32,469
You can make a bunch of different combinations rather than having,

41
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:40,469
oh, I'm going to use this sniper rifle and the Jirardi, or this sniper rifle and the Jirardi, or this sniper rifle and the Jirardi.

42
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:47,780
You have a lot of different options. When you come up with different core class mechanics that get changed,

43
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,780
you can go nuts, you can have so many different options.

44
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,780
I think I would love to see more stuff like this involved in Team Fortress 2,

45
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,780
because I think it would breathe a lot more air up the butt of TF2.

46
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,780
That's a really bad way to say that, but it would breathe more air and breathe life into this game again.

47
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:12,270
Now, TF2 does not necessarily need a burst of fresh air underneath it to make it have people play it,

48
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,270
because there, of course, is a community behind Team Fortress 2.

49
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,269
There are still active players. It's still a really active game.

50
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:25,269
But at least for me, seeing these new things implemented, these new core gameplay class mechanics put in the game,

51
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:31,269
I get so excited. When the Heatmaker came out, I was like, oh, well, cool, the Heatmaker.

52
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:34,269
It's another sniper rifle. Sweet.

53
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:39,269
When the Huntsman came out, I was like, holy shit, what the hell is this thing?

54
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:43,269
The same thing. Is this a boomerang? There's a boomerang in the game right now?

55
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:46,269
I've got to go play this game. Holy shit, cancel all my appointments.

56
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:51,769
Seriously, we get excited for new things. That's the nature of human beings.

57
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:54,769
We look forward to things. We want to see things.

58
00:04:54,769 --> 00:05:00,769
I'm not going to say that I'm getting sick of the same sniper rifle with different stats,

59
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:04,769
or the same grenade launcher or sticky bomb launcher.

60
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:07,769
What I'm getting is kind of not... I'm just going to say it.

61
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:13,769
I think I feel this way because Valve has spoiled us for so many years with free content

62
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:18,769
that they're just like, well, damn, we don't know what else to give you.

63
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:25,069
Here's another shotgun. They're spending a lot more development time in other games.

64
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:27,069
And I'll reiterate it one more time.

65
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:32,069
Balancing these items, these brand new items, can be impossible.

66
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,069
And sometimes they can break the entire game.

67
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,069
We all saw what happened with the Mini-Century.

68
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:41,069
When the Mini-Century first came out, people weren't really that concerned about it.

69
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:45,069
But the Mini-Century has really changed everything about the engineer.

70
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:49,069
And a lot of people do not like that and hate that item.

71
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:52,069
So let's say the boomerang comes out and they try to balance it.

72
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:56,069
They put some development time behind it, and the thing is just broken.

73
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:58,069
And it's really powerful. It's just unbelievable.

74
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:01,069
And there's no reason to ever equip the sniper rifles.

75
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,069
That stinks. That sucks.

76
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:05,069
But where do you balance it?

77
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:10,069
Where do you draw the line into what you want and what you're willing to live with?

78
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:15,379
Because this game was originally balanced and designed around all the stock items.

79
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,379
If you just play on a stock server, the game is supposed to be completely balanced.

80
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,379
They spent a lot of time doing that.

81
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:24,379
But ever since they've been implementing these items, things have changed a lot.

82
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:32,620
And that's something we all have to remember and realize that almost 80% of the items in this game are not release items.

83
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,620
They have been added in the last seven years.

84
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,980
But I will get off of that tangent now and wrap up the video, guys.

85
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,980
So thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

86
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
And let me know what you think.

87
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,980
Throw some stuff in the comments section.

88
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,980
What would you like to see added as the sniper?

89
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:53,980
Whether it's, like I said in the beginning, if it's a primary, secondary, melee, whatever you guys think would be cool.

90
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,980
And maybe try to balance it.

91
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,980
Maybe talk about the balance issue I brought up in this conversation as well.

92
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,980
So yeah, guys, thank you so much for watching.

93
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,980
That's my time.

94
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,980
And I'll see you all next time.

95
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,980
And of course, take care, everybody.
