00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,070
Hey, what is happening guys? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:11,830
Doing it with the Scout tonight, Default Scattergun, the Mad Milk, and the Unarmed Combat,

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:18,140
the new Halloween unlockable new Halloween item. If you are wondering why the cart is almost

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,500
kept for the enemy team, I'll tell you it's because we were getting absolutely dominated

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,219
in this gameplay. I was playing as a medic for the most part, and we were just getting crushed.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,539
There was nothing we could have done. We were getting absolutely owned. This only took like

7
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:37,100
five minutes for them to get this far. I figured we were just gonna lose, so I switched over to

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,579
Scout just to get some kills, just to have a little bit of fun. And it turned out to be quite

9
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,939
a good thing because we end up coming back with a victory in this gameplay. And in other news,

10
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:53,079
did you guys see the trailer for Grand Theft Auto V? Oh my god, I can't wait for that game to come

11
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,799
out now. Unbearable it's gonna be in my brain when they announce, oh that's coming out in,

12
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:04,760
June 6th 2015. Oh my god, going back to San Andreas, going back to Los Santos, that's gonna

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:11,079
be so much fun. I can't wait to play it. I have played every Grand Theft Auto back to Grand Theft

14
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:17,959
Auto I. I was one of those guys that owned Grand Theft Auto London. If any of you guys know what

15
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:24,280
that is, if any of you know what Grand Theft Auto London is, then you get props from me because

16
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,920
that's an old, really not that well known game. So if you know what that is, mad props to you.

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,189
So this is kind of a derp moment right here. I jumped down here. Instead of going for the medic,

18
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,030
I shoot the heavy multiple times. I figured, I figured that our team had enough people shooting

19
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,379
at him or somebody was backing me up that I could get two meat shots on him and he would die. But

20
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:52,620
that was not the case and I end up looking like a derp derpington, which it's okay. Sometimes it's

21
00:01:52,620 --> 00:02:00,340
okay to be a derp derpington. So I digress. Let's get back into this here. Barn Blitz is a crazy map.

22
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,379
Takes a long time to play Barn Blitz. I don't have a problem with maps that take a long time. It's

23
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:12,650
just the fact that upwards a very long map, bad waters a very long map. Most of the popular payload

24
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:19,050
maps happen to be the long, long maps, with the exception of course of Gold Rush. I wish they

25
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:24,409
would implement more maps like Gold Rush. You know, one, two control point checkpoints,

26
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:30,099
just because things go a little bit quicker. Because it can take potentially like 30 or 40

27
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:35,139
minutes to play one of these maps from beginning to end if the teams are balanced. Hopefully somebody

28
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:39,060
comes out with a map that's kind of like a Gold Rush but a little bit better, a little bit more

29
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,020
sleek and well-designed. I know there are plenty of custom maps that are like this, but I'm talking

30
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:50,009
more about official Valve style maps. So if you're looking for some scout tips on Barn Blitz,

31
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:54,009
here are a couple. These are the most important ones, especially when you get to this choke

32
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:58,330
point near the end of the last control point. This little area back here with the health pack

33
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,930
and the ammo pack is your best friend. I take out this pyro. I'm on fire. Keep going up here over

34
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,819
and over again. Probably go up here five or six times looking for the health pack. Sometimes I

35
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,300
don't find it because other people have the same idea. Get the assist on that heavy coming up here

36
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,099
to look for one last health pack. I get it just before this scout comes after me. Jumping around

37
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:23,219
the corner here. This is a great idea. Do this. Do a double jump around the side. There's a sentry

38
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:27,719
over there. Don't want to get myself killed so I just jump down here, shoot this scout in the face,

39
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,199
ruin his birthday party. The clown had to go home too. It's actually unfortunate. So this next part

40
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,039
is actually pretty odd. You'll see what I'm talking about. See that sentry over there?

41
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:41,639
I shoot it a few times and this engineer, rather than repairing it, he just destroys it. See,

42
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,319
I don't get the kill for this. Look at the top right. Nobody got the kill for it. He just destroyed

43
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,180
it and I think he put a new one down too. Kind of weird but you know people have different strategies.

44
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,740
Who knows what he was thinking? Probably trying to do something different. That's not a bad thing so

45
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,979
let's move right along here. Coming up to get the health pack like I told you guys before.

46
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,699
Jumping down to shoot this sniper in his face. Nothing he can do about it because as we all know

47
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:08,340
the machina what he was using cannot shoot from the hip. So even if he wanted to kill me he would

48
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,259
have to zoom in in my face. Level 1 sentry is now built up over there on the right side. Nothing I

49
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:19,699
can do about it so I run backwards. I'm gonna try and patrol the back area now just to make sure

50
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:24,019
there's only a minute left. So I want to just make sure that nobody comes around the side or around

51
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:29,220
the back door because Barn Blitz, the last point, has a couple of different places where you can

52
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,779
just pop out on the enemy team. So if you have a couple people on the right side and the left side

53
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:38,980
you'll be able to secure the last point. Get the health pack. Dancing around like a freak show.

54
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,699
Coming out here seeing if I can find somebody. I see there's a sentry and I hear the sentry as well.

55
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,819
There it is straight ahead. Try to get the milk on that soldier. Does not go well. I see a spy

56
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:51,540
picking up this health pack. Don't know what I'm going to do because I don't know where he is.

57
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,420
Probably a dead ringer. This is going to be the end of the gameplay. I make a pretty dumb mistake.

58
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,560
I know the sentry is out there but I'd run into it anyways. I'm just stupid. So I kill a soldier,

59
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,680
kill a sniper, get into a small scuffle with another scout. He disappears. I'm kind of like,

60
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,259
I look around like where the hell did he go? So I just run outside and get plastered by that level

61
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:17,459
three sentry and that's going to be the end of the gameplay. We win this game. I top frag only

62
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:22,019
because I was playing as a medic before. So if you're wondering how the hell did you get 40 points

63
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:27,399
in five minutes like that as a scout, it's because I was playing medic before. Thank you guys so much

64
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:31,959
for watching. I really do appreciate it. If you like this video, throw me a like, shoot me a like,

65
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,079
thanks guys. I'll see you all next time. Take care everybody.
