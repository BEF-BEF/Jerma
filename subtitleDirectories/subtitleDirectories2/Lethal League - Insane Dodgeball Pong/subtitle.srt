1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:09,820
I'm playing crocodile man. Alright, that's fine. You can be crocodile man.

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,619
Whoever has the biggest mouth for eating birds with. Alright, let's go, go, go, go, go.

3
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,660
Here we go. Alright, this is where we start. I'm not giving you any time. I don't know any

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,579
buttons, but I'm not giving you time. So am I like coming to punch you in the face?

5
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:27,780
Yeah, no, no, no, no. The ball. It's only the ball. Alright, oh, okay. So it's like

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:35,090
dodgeball. Is that how this works? Kind of, maybe. I don't know. This is like New Age

7
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,659
Pong. This seriously is New Pong. This is sick. I don't know. Wait, wait, wait. Okay,

8
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:45,539
I can do an eat move. I can do an eater. Yeah, you can like gently tap it and then

9
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:55,609
you launch it up. It's volleyball pong and it goes faster every time. Okay, I'm

10
00:00:55,609 --> 00:01:02,820
going to beat you now. Yeah! Jesus! We just ponged the shit out of each other.

11
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:17,510
Alright, it's time for you to get PONGED by Mist. Oh, easy, easy. Okay, okay, this might be

12
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:27,060
too much for my brain. Oh, fucking come on. That was not fair. I was not, I wasn't, why

13
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:38,230
was it right? Oh, you're going to do the jump threat. I don't know what I'm doing. Alright,

14
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:43,469
it's X. Do you have an Xbox controller? I do. It's X. You can hold it to do like a

15
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:50,689
charge attack, I guess. I guess. Okay, I've got it. Do you understand? Yes. And there's also

16
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:59,230
special moves. Don't you know how to do special moves? I get it, I get it. The ball is your

17
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:16,979
color now, so if it hits me, then... At least we had a volley going. At least. It's your color,

18
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:22,900
so you can hit it. No, it was purple. Nobody's... No, it starts off as the losing persons. Oh,

19
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:31,289
it does? Easy. Yes, yes. Yeah, so you have three HP left. What are the special moves?

20
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:36,180
Oh, and I can break dance. I think you hold down the button, you press the button. Yeah,

21
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,819
I mean, but I think there's other special moves you can do too, maybe. Other? All I can do is

22
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:50,710
like do some like dances and stuff. Okay, well maybe we should have looked. Yes, that was not

23
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:59,310
my plan at all, but it worked. Oh, come on. Noob. I even said damn it. Oh, you want to see this

24
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,110
pretty... Oh, what's he going to do? What's he going to do? What's going to happen here? What's

25
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,990
going to happen? I didn't know who won that one. All right, it's two. It's two. We both have two HP.

26
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:16,789
Oh, you ducked. Excellent work. No, I want to go down. I want it to go like... How did we get it

27
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:23,150
to go nuts before? You have to jump and hit it. I'm going to win. No, you're not. Yes, I am. I

28
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:31,629
don't think you're already... This one! Okay, this is where we really need to step up the game here.

29
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:42,030
I'm pretty sure I can like charge it maybe after I hit it for like a... Come on. Yes! I did the...

30
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:48,740
I won. I won. I get 100 bucks. I won. I won. I get 100 bucks. I won. Wait, you get XP? You

31
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:56,930
level up in this game? Maybe you can like... Do you unlock abilities? Okay, okay. All right,

32
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:02,960
so no mercy. This is the no mercy round. I paused the game accidentally, but it actually helped me

33
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:10,639
out. No! It didn't help anyone out. That's one. That's one. You little frog piece of dookie.

34
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:19,579
Somebody's getting a little upset about this. Oh! Super! Super! Good luck. Good luck. Good luck.

35
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:28,370
Fuck you! How are you ever supposed to do that? Shit. Take that. That was a quick move. They call

36
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,529
it volleyball. They call that the quick move. Do they? Something tells me that's not what they

37
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:36,769
call that in volleyball, but it's okay. I'm not sure how much volleyball you know. Oh, what? Get

38
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:43,360
out of my... Get out of my house. Get out of my house. I almost forget my accident. Get out of my

39
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:55,230
house. Get out of my house. See you later. Man, it's so funny. It's getting destroyed. Hey,

40
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,589
you said no mercy. I did. How did you get up that high? I don't know. Maybe it's like a move my guy

41
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:12,930
has. Yeah, it's a move to die. Okay. All right. You thought you had it. You thought you had it.

42
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:22,899
Get out of my house. Hey, get ready. Oh, be careful with this. Be careful with this. No,

43
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:29,139
I was swinging at you. The ball went through me. It was very bizarre. It was bizarre, wasn't it?

44
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,779
Come on. I faked you out. You see, you thought I was going to hit it, but then I missed. I was

45
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:41,089
just going for the alley-oop. What is your special move? We saw mine. Mine's like insane.

46
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:49,779
Oh, God. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm trying to like hit it again. Oh, here you go.

47
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:55,939
I don't know how to get up that high to even get it. Can you... Oh, I jumped. Can you... Maybe my...

48
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:01,199
Oh, you can double jump. I can't double jump. Yeah, that's the thing your character can do,

49
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,959
not mine. I hit that. I hit that. No, I hit you and it canceled out your swing. Well, you know what?

50
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:17,980
I don't even care. I don't even care. I don't even care. Try to get it. How did you come back?

51
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,860
You're not coming back. You're not going to come back and win this. No, you're not going to use

52
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:27,420
your double jump and like double jump all over me. What? I thought I had way more time. It didn't go

53
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:35,569
all the way to the edge. Redo, rematch, triple match. Let's go. Let's go. This is like a dirty

54
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:40,050
pool. You don't like the dirty pool level? It's kind of cool, I guess.

55
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,680
You're really good with the alligator. I wasn't really... Hold on. I was just trying to figure out

56
00:06:49,680 --> 00:07:03,329
one very... Come on. You read right through that. So is this the perfect that I'm going for?

57
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:08,660
You're not going to get a perfect. I can guarantee you that. See? Curl up in a ball. He can't see you.

58
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,439
All right. No. Get over here. You did that by accident. You didn't even know. No, I was trying

59
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,560
to hit you out. I knew you were going for a jump because you always do the jumps.

60
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,879
I always do do the jumps. You got to jump in. You don't have good anti-airs.

61
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:28,459
I thought you were going to hit it right back, but you didn't. Nope. No, I'm meta gaming.

62
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:34,939
All right. Fine. Get meta gamed. All right. I'm obviously not going to do that again.

63
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:44,269
He hit it underneath you this time. Whoa. You hit that from behind you because you have a tail.

64
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:51,860
I did a tail whip. Oh, doing the tail whip. Oh, you want to do a tail whip again?

65
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,170
You know what? Every time you jump into it and I keep thinking you're hitting it

66
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:08,459
like this. Yeah. Oh, like this. Oh, I did not think you were going to get that. I was putting

67
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:19,230
my controller down and about to start the ship talking. How do you get those every time?

68
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:26,100
I'm a sly alligator. I almost just lost right there.

69
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:35,389
Oh, now it is one and one. Who is going to end this epic battle of epic proportions?

70
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:51,549
What is happening? What just happened? That was the scariest thing I've ever done.

71
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:56,960
I didn't even think you hit it. Like this game's fun.
