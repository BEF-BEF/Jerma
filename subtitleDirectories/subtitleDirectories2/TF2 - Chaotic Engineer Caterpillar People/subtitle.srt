1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,990
This is so dumb. This is the dumbest thing ever. I love it.

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,469
Alright, are we ready to play Red Light Green Light?

3
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,469
Yes, yes, yes, yes, stop.

4
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:23,160
So turn around. Come over here.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,399
And green light. Red light!

6
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,120
This guy right in the-

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,479
No! You're not supposed to taunt kill!

8
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,840
Look at all these.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,969
So both of you guys stand over there. Make sure your sentry does not fire.

10
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,000
Make sure-

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Be careful you don't fall off.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Look at that guy just did.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh man.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's going to be very difficult to upgrade them because they're just going to start firing.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,870
If you can get it, if you're confident you can get it built to level 3, then try.

16
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,870
But try not to kill anybody.

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,870
Oh dear. Oh dear. It's chaos. It's chaos. Somebody died.

18
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,870
Abandoned mission. Abort mission.

19
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,870
Abort mission.

20
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,290
What's happening?

21
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,620
Dude, this is insanity.

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,620
Well, okay, so I think we found a problem.

23
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:47,579
If one person dies, then it all goes to hell.

24
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,579
Everybody point your laser beam.

25
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:53,579
Let's go with the guy in the green hat first because he's standing up there.

26
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,579
Everybody point your laser. The friendly fire is on.

27
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:58,140
Everybody point your laser at him.

28
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,760
I want you to uber him and then everybody unload on this guy.

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,709
So are we all ready?

30
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:15,340
Yeah, on the count of three, uber him and then once he's ubered everybody just start annihilating him.

31
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,340
Ready?

32
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,280
Three, two, one, uber.

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,319
Get him.

34
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,319
He's getting pushed back.

35
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,319
Is he still alive?

36
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,400
Alright, hold your fire. Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Hold your fire. Oh no.

38
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,340
Here comes the cottage.

39
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,340
Here comes the cottage.

40
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:55,939
This server is going to break.

41
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:01,759
Alright, so what we have created here, it looks almost like, it's like a caterpillar.

42
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,759
We've made an NG caterpillar.

43
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:10,000
This is actually like very, this is like very pretty.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,599
Bang, right there.

46
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,599
Make sure you got that Wrangler on.

47
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,599
Everybody get on top.

48
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,599
Let's hope it works this time.

49
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,030
Our beautiful centipede.

50
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,030
Our wonderfully beautiful engineer centipede that we've made.

51
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,159
And I want, everybody just move your, do a laser light show.

52
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,159
I want to see what it looks like. Just spin around everywhere.

53
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,039
Everybody spread out a lot.

54
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,479
That's good, that's good.

55
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,479
Everyone spread out a lot and then everyone aim at the ear.

56
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:58,639
And at the same time, count to three, everybody right click.

57
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,069
And let's just see what happens. Ready?

58
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:04,719
Three, two, one, click.

59
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,719
Alright, let's see what happens. Oh god.

60
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,599
Only one person.

61
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,599
This guy right here is the only guy.

62
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,599
That guy hit by one.

63
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,600
And look at how long he's stunned.

64
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Wow, I did not expect that.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,860
And three, two, one, go.

66
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,209
Yay, it's like fireworks.

67
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:34,310
Was it the same guy?

68
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,310
Blue pyro.

69
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,480
You should probably get over to the blue pyro side.

70
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,480
This is the red territory.

71
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,980
This is red territory.

72
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:48,269
Alright, get on, blue pyro's go, blue pyro's go on the blue side.

73
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:50,569
Red pyro's on red side.

74
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:53,389
This is not going to work.

75
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,389
This is not going to work. Oh my god.

76
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:57,689
Holy shit.

77
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:03,769
You are the scariest person I've ever seen in my life.

78
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:07,040
That is outrageous.

79
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Okay, you just, you just, I have nightmares.

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,040
I'm going to have nightmares tonight because of that face.

81
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,399
Alright, you guys ready?

82
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,709
Only air blast, only air blast.

83
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,709
And whoever wins, wins.

84
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:21,779
This one blue pyro, get out of here, man.

85
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,149
You gotta get on the blue side.

86
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:27,350
Ready? Here we go.

87
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,589
In three, two, one.

88
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:35,079
Charge!

89
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,079
No, no, who used fire?

90
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,079
Somebody used flames.
