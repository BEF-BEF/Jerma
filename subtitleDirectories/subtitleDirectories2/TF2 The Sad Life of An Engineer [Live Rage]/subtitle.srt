00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:21,100
Hi, sir. Yeah. Spies? You are so scary. Yeah, I- get- no, no! You punk! God damn it, you-

2
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:31,980
God, every word in the dictionary to describe hatred and pissed-offness. Let's move this up.

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,939
This is where we can start to do a lot of damage, right? God damn it!

4
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:58,219
Put the exit right over here. It's not that far from spawn, but it's okay. It's not that far from

5
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:04,150
spawn. This teleporter is, like, as far as you can throw a baseball from spawn. Like, oh, let me just,

6
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:12,790
like, toss a baseball, like, underhand. Underhanded. This is an underhand softball. You headless bastard.

7
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:26,700
Get out of here. What? What? What? What? How did this happen? I gotta watch that back. What the- what

8
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:41,849
the hell just happened? This thing blew up for no reason. I'm so paranoid right now. I- it- am I

9
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,409
going absolutely crazy right now, or is there, like, a ghost on Bon Blitz that is killing

10
00:01:46,409 --> 00:02:05,590
my teleporter over and over again? No! No! No! No! No! Thank the old gods, the new gods,

11
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:12,330
and the gods of old and new, and the- you- get the hell- no, it's okay. It's just a regular bald-ass

12
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:22,219
pyro. Anytime I see, like, a bald-ass pyro, I just automatically think spy. Just, like, a default

13
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:27,180
bald pyro just running at you. Just, hey, hi, I'm not a spy. Don't worry, I'm not a spie.

14
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:47,500
No! God, did you see that crit rocket? Holy di- no! Where is he? Where is this guy?

15
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:59,270
That just- son of a- ah! No, are you real? He's- it's the pyro back there. What- what I tell you,

16
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:07,300
what I tell you, the bald-ass pyro running around up here is a spy. Watch this. That's him right

17
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:19,379
there. Yeah. Could- could you guess? Can I please just get this set up and not have to, like, worry

18
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:28,020
about this anymore? Okay, I gotta go on- on the guys of Nightfall. Here we go. I got- there has

19
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:37,449
to be, like- dude, I don't even know which one it is. This has gotta get in here. Hurry. Hurry up.

20
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:43,000
Hurry up. Hurry up and build. Hurry up and build. Hurry up and build. You stupid son of a bitch! I

21
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,969
hate you. All right, I don't hate you. I did hate you for, like, a good five seconds right there,

22
00:03:48,969 --> 00:04:00,340
but I don't hate you right now. Maybe I hate myself for doing that. See, when there's a spy on the

23
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,199
other team, or, like, multiple spies on the other team, that are just making your day just a living

24
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:12,090
hell. Like, seriously, playing Engineer is, like, the scariest class to play in this game, especially

25
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:20,220
when there's, like, a friggin' unusual spy with, like, 20 billion kills on his knife running around

26
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:27,750
trying to get, like, free kills on you. Ain't gonna happen. You ain't gonna get me. You ain't

27
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:41,050
gonna stab me. I promise you that. You shut up. Oh my god, what am I doing? I fall off cliff

28
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:54,870
cuz I'm an idiot. Let's just keep a base out here. Get a teleporter built. Holy hell. I swear. Where

29
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:03,019
is he? You fucking piece of- Stop playing the Giles theme music right now, guys, because this- it's on

30
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:18,600
now. Hi, sniper. Get the- Yeah, where you going? You going down here with your dead ringer? Oh, I

31
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:27,350
heard you. Where are you? Where'd you go? I heard it. You all heard it. Not gonna let him get away

32
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:39,610
with that. Yeah, get the- Yeah, what's up, bro? How you doing? Oh, you're the real one. I'm hiding

33
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:52,060
this in the bushes. The sentry bush made from the- I just ruined my desk. Um, this is- Oh, look at

34
00:05:52,060 --> 00:06:04,149
the ad. I found the Spycicle. Can you believe it? It's my personal mission now to kill that spy.

35
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:09,240
Oh, look. Look who's up there. Now he doesn't have his dead ringer. I want- No, the soldier,

36
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,529
let me get this kill. Let me hit him. He doesn't have a dead ringer right now. It's my kill,

37
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:24,889
not yours. It's my kill, not yours. You leave me the fuck alone, okay?

38
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,459
Oh, I keep falling off of this cliff and it's gonna make me mad. It's gonna drive me friggin'

39
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:43,959
mental. Once I get this teleporter up, if I don't get trolled by spies for the remainder of the game,

40
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:54,410
then we should be okay. Just gotta get it up. Keep having to use my metal on things I don't

41
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:32,019
want to use the metal on. Screw you! Teleporter up. At least all my stuff is up. You can go ahead

42
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:37,860
and like shoot from across the map and be a prick. That's fine. I don't even care. All I want is to

43
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:45,589
get this teleporter up. Who is attacking this teleporter? Who is doing this? Somebody help me.

44
00:07:47,990 --> 00:08:00,019
I- This is not gonna work. It's over. Good. Game. Good. Game. At least I got that.

45
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:04,620
At least I got that last laugh right there. Oh, look who it is. Oh, look who it is.
