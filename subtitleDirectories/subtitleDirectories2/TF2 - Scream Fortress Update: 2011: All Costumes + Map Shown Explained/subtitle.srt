1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,480
Okay, so here are the costumes for all the classes. Hopefully you guys enjoy this.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,279
Some of these are hysterical. We're going to start with the Scout.

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:14,439
The Scout is the Cursor Nature. It's a set, three pieces, one hat, and two miscellaneous items.

4
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:18,199
You start with the Wrap Battler, which is kind of like a mummy hat over his eyes.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,879
The Bunk, which is an arm wrap and a little ankh symbol for the necklace.

6
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:31,960
And the Futa, oh my god, how can I pronounce this? The Futan Kuman, or whatever you pronounce it.

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,079
So it's kind of like a mummy setup for the Scout. Looks pretty funny.

8
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,119
And he got a new melee weapon, the Unarmed Combat. Don't think it does anything.

9
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:43,000
It's just kind of a reskin of the bat, but it still looks pretty funny.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,869
As you can see, it's some dude's arm.

11
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:52,149
All right, now let's move on to the Soldier. The Soldier got a, oh this is awesome. I love this so much.

12
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:59,109
This is the Tin Soldier, and the hat is the Idiot Box, which is kind of this robot head.

13
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:05,349
These really crappy steel pipes for his arms, and the shoestrings that's like little box shoes.

14
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,540
I think it looks hilarious. It's going to be so funny watching people running around with this.

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,140
Now the Pyro. The Pyro got this demon setup. This is really, really cool. I like this one a lot.

16
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,900
The Blazing Bull. It's called the Infernal Imp, is the name of the set.

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,109
The Blazing Bull for the head, Fallen Angel for the wings, and the second secondary is

18
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:31,849
Tail from the Crypt. He has a tail. So out of his little compression thing here. This is so funny.

19
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:36,730
All right, let's move on to the Demoman. The Demoman kind of got like a werewolf setup.

20
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:43,030
Look at this face. It's ridiculous. So it's called the Highland Hound, and the hat is the

21
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:48,230
Hair of the Dog. The first miscellaneous is the Scottish Snarl, which is kind of the face,

22
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,670
and look at the paws. These are great. The Pickled Paws.

23
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,920
Kind of see some werewolf Demoman running around. Pretty ridiculous.

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,439
Let's move on to the Heavy. The Heavies is kind of a let down, to be honest. I guess it's okay.

25
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:08,389
But it's a Frankenstein sort of remake, I guess. The name of the set is the Franken Heavy.

26
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,789
The can opener is the Head. The Steel-Tilled Stoppers is one of the miscellaneous,

27
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:17,509
and the second miscellaneous is the Soviet Stitch-Up. So it's kind of like a Frankenstein

28
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,949
monster kind of thing, with the brain coming out here in the end. It's cool, I guess. A little

29
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:29,020
kind of on the line. Like I said, I'm not really too happy about it, but whatever. It's cool.

30
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:36,139
This is the by far best one in the entire update. This is the Engineers. He got a Bug Fly update.

31
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:42,759
Oh god, this is so funny. The name of it is the Brundle Bundle. The Buzz Killer, which is this

32
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:49,300
Fly Face Mask thing, which is hysterical. Fly Wings as one miscellaneous, and the Fly Feet

33
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,020
as another one. I love this. I hope that they don't take this off. I hope they allow you to

34
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,870
keep this, because it can get... Oh, I can't believe it. It's so funny. The Medic is another

35
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:06,310
one of the really funny ones. Take a look at this. This is called the Mad Doctor, as I'm sure you

36
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:13,370
could assume. The Head is the Einstein, the Emerald Girardi, and the Dr. Google Stache is the other

37
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:20,819
miscellaneous. Very, very funny stuff. This is great. Let's move on now. The Sniper is also a

38
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:26,340
little bit on the somewhat lame side. The Hat is pretty cool. The Holy Hunter, the name of the

39
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,710
set is the Camper Van Helsing, and it's pretty funny. The Hat has got this little symbol up

40
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,990
here. It's a nice little... I like the hat. It's pretty cool looking. Garlic Flank Steak. It's the

41
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,069
miscellaneous. It's kind of hanging on the sides here, the garlic and the little knife. And Silver

42
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:47,139
Bullets up here. Kind of wish they did a little more with it, but it's still interesting. I still

43
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:52,090
think it's great. The Spy is also really interesting. Look at this. He looks like a Sand Raider.

44
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,979
The name of this one is the Invisible Rogue. So it's like the Invisible Man. I think it looks

45
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:04,099
like a Sand Raider. The Undercover is the Hat. The Intangible Ascot, whatever you say that,

46
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:09,960
is one of the miscellaneous. And the Goggles, the Griffin's Gog, are the second. So you can collect

47
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,159
these all from the new map that is updated. It is Ioduct. We're going to take a look at that right

48
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,240
now. And you get them in the cauldron when you first log on. You can get one of these in the

49
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:26,970
cauldron. So let's move on to the new map and the new monster. Okay, so here we are on Ioduct.

50
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,970
This is not Viaduct. It might look like Viaduct, but it's kind of a reskin of Viaduct. They took

51
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,689
Viaduct and made it haunted. Haunted Viaduct. And if you're wondering in the top part of the screen,

52
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:45,930
that is the new boss's health. The new boss is this thing right here, this giant floating eyeball.

53
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,569
The Monoculus, the Monoculus, whatever you want to say, however you want to pronounce it.

54
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:56,810
When he dies, he opens up a portal that you can go into, if my understanding is correct. And I think

55
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,850
the nearest few people, or maybe somebody that got the last hit on him, I'm not sure, but I end up

56
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:07,850
getting the last hit on him here, as you'll see. Not really sure. Gonna try and find that out later

57
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,089
on in the next couple of days, but you'll see what happens. He has almost no health. Also forgot to

58
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:17,689
mention, I want to say the new spy knife is just a reskin of the eternal reward. No biggie. Forgot

59
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:21,930
to mention that earlier. Wanted to bring that up. So there's the last hit right there. He just exploded.

60
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,620
Let's go into this new crazy world. Nobody wanted to shoot each other. I was kind of shooting this

61
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,459
guy, and then I was thinking, wait a minute. Maybe we should just see what's going on here. This little

62
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:37,220
gate runs down, and whoever picks it up, I think maybe everybody gets it. I'm not sure. I believe

63
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,420
maybe only one or two people can get it. Then once you get it, you turn into psycho mode, ubered and

64
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,500
critscreeged, and you can just kill everybody. This was just so confusing to me. I was like,

65
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,540
what is going on? But that is kind of the update, and then once I die, you will see the items that

66
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,500
I got for completing that. Two achievements, guys. You can get them, and one of the new items you can

67
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,339
get is this thing right here, the bombonomicon. That's a new mask. The monoculus is a new mask,

68
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:06,819
and this thing explodes spontaneously on death. Not really sure what that does,

69
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:11,300
but maybe it kills people that you blow up near. Thank you all so much for watching. I really

70
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,620
appreciate it. Go have fun with this new update. There's a couple of things I didn't get to cover,

71
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,100
but I tried to get most of it in one video. Thank you guys so much. I'll see you all next time,

72
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,540
and take care, everybody.
