00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,459
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with an update video.

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:11,060
I felt the need to make this video because of various developments going on in my channel in my life.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:17,399
So we're going to talk. I don't have any gameplay. I haven't recorded much gameplay since like four or five months ago.

4
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:23,289
So in the background of this video is probably just going to be Spider-Man. You cool with that?

5
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:31,079
You don't want Spider-Man. Okay, but how about Spider-Man 2? Yeah, I knew I'd get you with Spider-Man 2.

6
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:35,909
So if you want to listen, you go ahead. And if you don't, then you've probably already left.

7
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:41,420
And I don't know why I'm even addressing that person because they've been gone for probably the last 10 to 15 seconds.

8
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:48,490
So I will address the elephant in the room, which is my uploads over the last couple of months.

9
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,369
I'm sure you're well aware there's only been like three uploads to this channel in two months.

10
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:56,090
And that's something that I'm not particularly happy about.

11
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:01,750
I obviously want to make as many videos, make as many videos that I'm proud of that I want you guys to watch.

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:08,790
Try to get as much videos and content up as possible. But sometimes, sometimes you need to collect yourself,

13
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,109
take a break, and reiterate inside your head why you do these things, why you make these videos,

14
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:20,090
what you're doing it for, who you're doing it for, and are you still interested.

15
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,879
And that's a very important point that I want to make. Very, very first off, before we talk about anything else,

16
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:32,040
I have to stay interested. We could talk about money and power and the fame and the fans and

17
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:40,969
how fuh-wow. Kiss my hand. Now kneel. I don't, no, I just, I need to stay interested. I have to be

18
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:47,319
completely and totally into the thing that I'm currently working on. I've never been able to just

19
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:52,920
force myself to upload something. Even back when I was uploading a shitload of videos years ago,

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,640
I was totally fucking into it. I wanted, I was so into making those videos every day because I was

21
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,629
currently so into the subject matter. And lately, I've been into certain subject matters that take

22
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:10,949
way more time to come up with and way more time to produce, which we can segue into talking about

23
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:17,189
the next subject I want to bring up. And it's a huge video that I've been working on. I've wanted

24
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:22,150
to make this video for about a year and it's currently taking up a bunch of my mental energy

25
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:28,469
and spare time and money and effort is gonna be huge. And it's gonna come out this summer.

26
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:33,129
I don't want to talk about what it is. I'm sure people can piece together the stupid fucking things

27
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:37,370
I've said on live streams to be able to piece together what it is. And I've told some people

28
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,409
what it is. If I've told you, if you're one of the people I've told, just keep zipping, you know

29
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:47,050
what I mean? Just keep it up. You're a secret keeper now. You've been elevated to the status

30
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:52,969
of secret keeper. That doesn't happen very often, especially in my circle of acolytes that I have

31
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:59,770
here. So if I've told you, just you know what to do. So stay tuned for that. It's coming. You'll see

32
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:05,099
it when you see it and I really hope you guys enjoy it because it is a legit just like love

33
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:12,389
letter to you guys. And without getting overly sappy or emotional in this video, it's for you.

34
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,909
This video is for you. I've had this idea that I thought people would really, really be into

35
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:23,300
and it's just a total concentration of all the stupid shit that's been going on on this channel

36
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,219
for five years. And I hope you guys really enjoy it when you see it. And that's pretty much all I

37
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:32,550
got to say about that subject. We're going to move on to the next one, which is streaming,

38
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,990
which I got to be careful of because every single time I talk about streaming in a video,

39
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,500
I curse myself and I don't stream for like three months. So let's hope that doesn't happen right

40
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,060
now because I've been streaming a lot lately. These last like four months, I've been going

41
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:51,219
a couple of times a week, sometimes more than that. Sometimes like four, five, six, seven,

42
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:58,020
eight hour streams. I streamed all of Dark Souls 3. I streamed a bunch of Stardew Valley. I did

43
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,099
Doom a couple of days ago. I've been streaming Overwatch as shit load. I've been on there a lot

44
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,599
and it's something that I'm having a ton of fun doing. So if you still have not followed my Twitch

45
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:14,250
and you're into that and you like streaming, then come on over. And if you're not, if you really just

46
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,660
hate live streaming, you don't like watching live streams, then there is a little bit of good

47
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,060
news here for you too, because all the streams that I do, at least the major ones that have

48
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,699
substantial amount of content in them will be broken up and they will be uploaded as highlights

49
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,079
to YouTube. Now I don't know if that's going to be this channel or if I'd make a separate channel

50
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:40,439
entirely for stream content. I don't know, but I don't like the idea of putting whole streams up

51
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,959
on YouTube because they are currently on Twitch right now. You can watch entire VODs on Twitch

52
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,819
right now. So I don't want to do that. I'd rather have, oh, you played through Dark Souls 3. Here's

53
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:56,459
like two or three videos condensed of all like the best moments from when you were streaming.

54
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:01,819
That's what I'm into. I'm just not sure exactly when it will happen, but I would assume in the

55
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:06,970
next couple of months here is when it would start to be a thing. And finally, we're going to talk

56
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,350
about my book. That's right. You didn't think you were going to ever hear that shit again,

57
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,139
did you? About my book that I'm writing. If you have no idea what I'm talking about,

58
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:19,939
if you're fairly new to the channel or if you're an old subscriber that forgot because it's been

59
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:25,699
so damn long, I wanted to try to make a choose your own adventure book, write it and come up

60
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:29,620
with some stupid ideas, put it in like a medieval fantasy world and you get to pick different things

61
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,019
to do. And it was going to be free. I was never going to charge for it. I was going to just release

62
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:39,180
it because I'm using the Inkle writer to write it. And there's been progress. I actually started

63
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,540
writing again. I stopped and I started and I stopped and I started and now I'm finally

64
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,500
writing again. And it's become kind of like therapy to me. You know, whatever I feel,

65
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,100
I fucking today sucks. You know what, I'm just gonna sit down and I'm going to write like two

66
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,230
chapters and I don't know. We'll see what happens. I have no idea if this is ever going to get

67
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:02,629
finished. Another like six to 12 months might go by and I might just throw it up onto Twitter

68
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:07,110
and have everybody just enjoy the fucking mess that it's probably going to be.

69
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,310
So that's the update on that. And that really wraps it up. That's all I really wanted to talk

70
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,269
about today. Just want to make sure you guys know I'm still around. I'm still kicking. I still get

71
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:22,649
a bunch of shit up my sleeve, but a magician never reveals his secrets except to like a few people,

72
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:27,459
except maybe like 30 people that I've already told the secret to. So he does reveal his secrets only

73
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:31,060
due to a very small amount of people. Anyways guys, thanks so much for watching. I really

74
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,180
appreciate it. Have a good rest of your day. Have a good rest of your morning, night, evening,

75
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,480
whatever the hell you're watching this video. And I'll talk to you guys soon. So take care everybody

76
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,040
and goodbye.
