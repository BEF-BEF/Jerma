00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:11,320
Hey, what is going on everybody? Derma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary and tonight

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,719
going to continue my sort of update discussion coverage on the new Team Fortress 2 bread

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,339
teleport bread update love and war or whatever you want to call this update this is going to

4
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:29,820
cover the demo knight the new demo knight shield or demo man shield and before we get started

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,979
i just want to say that it's crazy that stuff like this is now possible watch the ground that i cover

6
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:41,899
here i would you see where i started i started all the way back where the cart is and look at

7
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:50,140
where i ended up after four charges in what like 10 seconds i went back to their spawn got a medic

8
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:58,200
pulled up around the left side escaped with my life intact and i got three kills to show for it

9
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,759
this item really just makes you bounce around like a pinball like i feel like i'm inside of

10
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,879
the adams family pinball machine from 93 or whenever the hell that game came out i hope i

11
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:11,799
brought enough quarters because i want to keep playing like with the tide turner let me like

12
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,680
jingle them all out what 50 cents to continue hope i get a multi ball that's what i feel like when

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,560
i'm playing with this item and even when you're not using the tide turner to about i didn't even

14
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,519
explain like what the tide turner even is the tide turner is the shield that is giving the

15
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,400
opportunity to do this if you don't know how it works when you charge somebody and you get a kill

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,400
while you're charging you are able to immediately charge again which is why i say you turn into a

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:44,519
pinball and also you get the 25 explosion reduction and damage and fire reduction and damage so it

18
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:50,120
does the same amount of damage reduction as the splendid screen but it also allows you to have a

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,319
hundred percent like turning control you you can turn as much as you want with this item you don't

20
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,400
even have you know the wee booties you don't have to put those on this thing is totally negates the

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,000
wee booties in that regard but that's how the item works and on top of it being really good for

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,520
offensive measures bouncing around and getting a bunch of kills the escape mechanism of this item

23
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,530
is also really good as a demo night before when you charged into somebody if there was a bunch of

24
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,530
people that you saw okay there's a bunch of people on this point i'm going to charge in with my demo

25
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,289
night and i'm going to try to get a kill with it okay great you got one kill now you're just like

26
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:28,169
swinging around blindfolded at like a fucking pinata like go like where is it did you get

27
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:33,780
somebody else maybe you did but this item allows you to get out so if you charge around a corner

28
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,500
and you get like another demo or you get a scout or something you can immediately turn around and

29
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,460
get out and get to a safe position which is exactly what i did in the very beginning of this video i

30
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,759
get that i got the medic i got out and i was totally safe now if you have one of the grenade

31
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:54,199
launchers on obviously that's another way to protect yourself if you turn a corner you get

32
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,719
someone and there's a bunch of other people you can try to make something else happen with the

33
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,919
grenade launcher but if you just want to get out and keep a streak going this thing is fantastic

34
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:08,919
for that because it's pretty difficult to shoot at a charging demo night unless he's coming right at

35
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,199
you or you're a pyro and you can air blast them they move really damn fast and sometimes it can

36
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:19,960
be difficult to plan a shot on them and if you want my thoughts as a whole i think that this

37
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:26,759
shield is incredibly powerful i think it's probably the best shield out of the three right now there

38
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,039
are the other ones sure the other ones have a good place but the full turning control and the

39
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:38,599
be able to charge after kill i think are so huge that it's really hard at this stage right now to

40
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:44,169
argue against it being the best shield in the game right now and before this video wraps up i just

41
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:48,569
want to briefly go over this part of the update because a lot of people had a question about this

42
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:54,169
and they were and myself included i was asking okay we got day one we got day two and we didn't

43
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:59,530
get a day three and i was in the crowd of people that a lot of us thought we were going to get the

44
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,610
moon base the big new moon base map that valve was working on on day three and there was no day

45
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:12,889
three so what that means is there's more stuff coming pretty damn soon you got end of the line

46
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,290
you got this whole moon base thing i don't know if end of the line and the moon base map

47
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,569
are going to be tied together part of the same update and if they're not then that means there's

48
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:28,730
two updates that are coming to this game at a reasonably fast pace i'm going to assume it's

49
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,449
not going to be oh yeah end of the line is going to be out like next june no this is going to be

50
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:38,490
probably pretty soon with all this new stuff so keep that in mind there's still more things

51
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,370
coming to this game and it's a really great time to be a team fortress 2 player i know a lot of

52
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,329
people myself included thought okay that we haven't seen anything new in such a long time

53
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:54,410
does valve still care and apparently they do so it's good to know that it's really awesome to

54
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,610
see this game having a bunch of concurrent players uh jumping back into the game some new players

55
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,689
some old players that are checking it out again and it's awesome and if you happen to be one of

56
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:08,550
these people that just jumped in for the update keep playing it's fun but anyways guys that's

57
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,470
going to wrap up the video thank you all so much for watching just my thoughts on a couple of the

58
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,040
things in the update and i'll see you guys all next time and of course take care everybody and

59
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,199
you know it's been beautiful out it's been especially like in united states we're in the

60
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,680
middle of like pretty much the summer time right now go go like throw a frisbee you know just go

61
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,000
outside go outside and just throw a frisbee and just be like yeah just throw a frisbee
