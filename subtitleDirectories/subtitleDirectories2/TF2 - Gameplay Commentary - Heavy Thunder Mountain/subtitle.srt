1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:09,130
What is happening guys, it is Jerma bringing you a complete fucking roll video as a heavy.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:15,130
I'm using the default minigun, the sandwich, and the gloves are running urgently.

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:21,129
And I left it with a little bit of setup time so I could just say a couple things to you guys.

4
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:29,129
I want to thank most of the subscribers, I think there's 12 of you now that have subscribed to me in the very beginning of this run I'm doing here.

5
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,130
It really means a lot to me, I thank you guys a lot from the bottom of my heart.

6
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:41,130
And I'll be doing probably some type of giveaway, some type of subscription giveaway for people or something like that.

7
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:47,130
Something to show my gratitude and get more people to come to the channel and have a little bit more of an advertising thing.

8
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,130
But it's three seconds left, this is a complete roll.

9
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:58,130
I'm not going to really give too much gameplay commentary because it's a complete roll, we destroy this team with no regard.

10
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:03,130
I get ubered right out of the gate, there's a sentry on the right, kill the sentry, kill the engineer.

11
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,129
Kill this guy over here, no actually I don't kill anybody, we get on the cart.

12
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:13,129
And like I said in a video before, rolling people is stupid, I hate it.

13
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:16,129
I wish it would never happen, but it does.

14
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:21,129
This sentry gun is distracted by something over on the left, I end up taking it out very very easily.

15
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:24,129
Keep moving up here, there's a demo man I think up there.

16
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:29,129
Get rid of this engineer's equipment because that's just a slap in the face.

17
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:31,129
Get back on the cart.

18
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:34,129
We are absolutely rolling to the point.

19
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:37,129
This scout, I didn't think I was going to kill him, he was running around like a little bunny.

20
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:39,129
Kill him anyways.

21
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:41,129
And we are still rolling.

22
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:43,129
These type of games just annoy me.

23
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:47,129
Well it's hard to say that when I'm playing cart heavy.

24
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:50,129
That pyro just disappeared by the way.

25
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:53,129
He jumped up and sprayed everybody.

26
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,129
And then was launched 100 feet in the air and he was just gone from there.

27
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:59,129
This spy backstabbed somebody on my team, I kill him.

28
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:01,129
Still on the cart, we are at the second point.

29
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,129
And this is a big tip for you guys right here.

30
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:06,129
When you cap this point, watch what I do.

31
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:10,129
I don't wait for the bridge to come up like everybody does.

32
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,129
You don't have to wait for that bridge to come up.

33
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:14,129
Just run around the side like I'm doing here.

34
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:19,129
And you'll get people off guard coming through this house like I get this medic off guard.

35
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:22,129
I'm not sure I actually kill him, but I get this sentry off guard.

36
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:24,129
There's pretty much this whole team over here off guard.

37
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,129
I think I'm going to die, I run back, throw my sandwich in the ground.

38
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:31,129
But the point is, use that little route on the left.

39
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:35,129
You don't have to wait for the bridge just sitting there waiting like 30 seconds for the bridge to come up.

40
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:37,129
You don't have to do that.

41
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:40,129
I get ubered again, come up here, there's another sentry over here.

42
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,129
This makes it four I think for me of kills for me.

43
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,129
Take out the engineer, take out the heavy.

44
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:49,129
And people start to leave the cart at this point.

45
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,129
Nobody's pushing the cart.

46
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:56,129
Everyone's kind of just sitting back and as you can see the cart just has one or two people on it.

47
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:59,129
And I believe I say over Mike, I say something like,

48
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,129
Can we push the cart?

49
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:05,129
What are we doing? Let's just get it over with.

50
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:07,129
So we all get on it.

51
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:09,129
And this is an absolute roll like I said.

52
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,129
It's a very quick gameplay.

53
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:15,129
But if this happens, if you see this happen in the server,

54
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,129
Please switch to the other team.

55
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,129
If you're number one, number two on the server,

56
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:23,129
Switch to the other team. Don't be a dick.

57
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,129
Switch to the other team, make it fun for everybody.

58
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:29,129
There's no reason to do this at all, ever.

59
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:32,129
But anyways, thank you guys, all the subscribers again.

60
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,129
I appreciate all you guys do. Thank you so much.

61
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,129
I'm out.
