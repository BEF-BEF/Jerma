00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,660
This place has like a weird playground mode. Wow, are you serious? No, don't fall in the spikes.

2
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,579
Please help me. I didn't want to die. I don't want to die like this.

3
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:34,009
Dude, this is brutal. I'm gonna turn.

4
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,039
Unbelievable. I'm still alive. I'm turning into a piece of trash.

5
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,920
I can't believe this is actually still a drivable car.

6
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,880
Well, it's okay. I just, you know, whatever. I turned into a fucking piece of trash.

7
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:11,349
Come on, you can do it. You can do it, little trash car.

8
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,109
No, I can't. I couldn't do it. I couldn't. You told me I could. I couldn't do it, mummy.

00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,219
This is the thing from Double Dare. You guys remember Double Dare?

10
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,739
The thing on Nickelodeon when the people would slime through this thing and it like looked like

11
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:34,659
it was going to squish them? Double Dare, this is awesome. I can't wait to see what happens here.

12
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:44,170
Did you get the flag? Did you pick up the flag, dad? Oh, god damn it. Goofball asshole,

13
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,849
dad didn't pick up the flag at the end. I'm not going to get my Super Nintendo and my mountain bike.

14
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,530
You guys remember the prizes for Double Dare? They were shit. You got like a Super Nintendo

15
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:10,969
game and a bike. That is so cool. That was awesome. I love physics engines, man. There's

16
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:15,939
so much fun. What else is there? What other like weird toys can I play with in this game?

17
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,520
Yeah, I think I'm going to need your insurance information. You backed into me when we were at

18
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,439
the Walgreens. I could really... my car has a bump on the fender now. You need to get your

19
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:39,400
insurance, you fucking bitch. This is definitely the best thing is this thing down here. Just you

20
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:47,259
get absolutely destroyed in here. I seriously want to... I wonder how much car damage you can really

21
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:52,650
do. The thing from the Brave Little Toaster is my goal. I want to turn into a cube from the Brave

22
00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:03,060
Little Toaster. I'm making a lot of references to old shit in this video. Hi, I'm Mr. Car and I don't

23
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:14,569
feel good right now. My tummy hurts. Welcome to the dentist. In my office, how we do things is I use

24
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:27,050
a super teeth grinder. And your teeth really need to be cleaned. Yes, yes they do. Don't mind,

25
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:45,030
don't mind the guy crashing into the wall. I gotta go look at that guy. The guy looks like a school

26
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:56,199
bus. The guy... oh no, he's gonna get crushed. Oh no, no, he can't do it. Yeah, yeah, okay, I hear you.

27
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:02,539
Yeah, so where's this cargo going? This really expensive cargo from Japan? Yeah, well, I don't

28
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:06,620
want to just be careful next to it because, you know, you never know what could happen if you

29
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:13,020
accidentally bump it. And if you couldn't understand the joke already, then oh no, all that expensive

30
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:23,189
Japanese cargo. Whatever will we do? Whatever will we do? That joke's getting edited out of the video.

31
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,629
Get in the jet engine. You can do it, Luke Skywalker. Use the force, just like in the movie.

32
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:47,740
Yes! Come on, get in the six, you fuck. Yes! Yes! And the four. And the four. That's ten points.

33
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,339
Are you trying to tell me right now that this person in here is not injured at all?

34
00:04:55,339 --> 00:05:02,379
Is this even a person? Is this like, what is this thing? This poor guy's stuck. Oh no, I'm stuck in

35
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:10,899
here. Whatever will I... See, a lot of people didn't know that there was a boss battle in this.

36
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,779
The giant enemy spider.

37
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:50,069
I don't even know. Help. What have I done? My frames are going down. I just want to go bowling.

38
00:05:50,709 --> 00:06:02,250
That's all I wanted to do. Just want to go bowling. I just want to go bowling. Cousin. Cousin. Let's go bowling.
