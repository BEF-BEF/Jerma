00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight, gonna be playing as the soldier with the strange Liberty Launcher, the buff banner, and the vintage, I believe it's a vintage, escape plan.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So the gameplay is gonna kinda sit in the background. It is a one-life gameplay on Badwater, on Defense.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I actually change over in the very end to Offense, to try and do some goofy stuff, to try and cap the cart, but you'll see if that is successful or not.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,179
But what I wanna talk about is the future of Team Fortress 2. I wanna know what you guys have to say about it, I wanna get you guys involved in the discussion.

5
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:57,179
But it's something I've been really thinking about, and I've had topics like this before, talking about is Team Fortress 2 coming to an end soon, is Team Fortress 2 still relevant, and that sort of thing.

6
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:05,180
But what I wanna talk about is the future of Team Fortress 2, and what they can possibly do to keep this game running for years to come.

7
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:17,609
Because as we all know, the game is very, very old, and by standards of this generation of gaming, five to six years is a pretty long time for a community to still be around supporting a game.

8
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,609
But I just wanna know your guys' thoughts, and I'm gonna give you some of my thoughts as well, on the future of this game.

9
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:28,980
So as we have seen in the recent months, Valve has been putting a lot of time, a lot of development into Team Fortress 2.

10
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:39,980
And we have seen not only a massive amount of items and some Meet the Team videos, we've also seen a brand new mechanic, a brand new game mode in that being Man vs. Machine.

11
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,280
So I guess the real question at hand here is, where are they going to go?

12
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:54,819
Because sadly, it's looking more and more and more like we're not going to get a Team Fortress 3 really anytime soon.

13
00:01:54,819 --> 00:02:00,819
They have this microtransaction setup, they have this little store setup, so Team Fortress 2 will continue to make the money.

14
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:06,129
And thinking about it more and more and more, do they really even need a Team Fortress 3?

15
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:15,300
I mean, maybe you update the engine, maybe you add another class, but wouldn't Team Fortress 3 be the same as Team Fortress 2 with an updated graphics engine?

16
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,300
Because that was the main problem people had with Left 4 Dead 2.

17
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:25,300
When Left 4 Dead 2 came out, Left 4 Dead 1 was essentially the exact same game, they just added a few more things.

18
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,300
And I think that's what they've already done in Team Fortress 2.

19
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:34,300
Remember, Team Fortress 2, back in 2007 when it launched, did not have any of this stuff.

20
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,479
It was just default loadouts, six to eight maps, and that was it, you just played.

21
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,479
There was no unlockables, there was no Mann Co. store, there were no drops, there was no payload.

22
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:50,479
So I really do feel like Team Fortress 3 is what they've added to Team Fortress 2 since the beginning.

23
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:56,849
So what is the future? What is Valve going to do? Are they going to drastically change something eventually here?

24
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:00,849
They've already done, like I said, Mann vs. Machine, but what else do you do?

25
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:05,849
Do you elaborate on Mann vs. Machine? Do you create a whole new mode?

26
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:10,849
Does Team Fortress 2 become Valve's experiments for all their newer games?

27
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:13,849
Because I think that's what one of the Valve employees said a while back.

28
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:20,849
They said that Team Fortress 2 was sort of an experiment for all the things that they're working on and trying to implement in their other games.

29
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,090
And if we ever did see a Team Fortress 3, what would you guys want in it?

30
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:31,090
Because I'm trying to think about it, and I don't know. I really don't have an answer to that question.

31
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,389
I think Team Fortress 2 is as close to perfect that I'd ever want it.

32
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,569
Team Fortress 3, I don't know. I really can't answer that question.

33
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,569
And maybe some of you guys in the comments can answer that.

34
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:46,870
And that's why I'm posing the question why I made this video.

35
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,870
Because years ago, we had no idea that Mann vs. Machine was going to come out.

36
00:03:52,870 --> 00:04:01,870
And Mann vs. Machine is so drastically wildly different than anything that Team Fortress has ever seen ever in the entirety of the series.

37
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:09,110
If you had told me back then that there was going to be a horde mode where you fought robots and you all were on the same team,

38
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:14,110
I would have laughed in your face. I would have said, what the hell are you talking about, man?

39
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,110
There's no way there's going to be robot teams and upgrades on your guns.

40
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,110
I never would have believed you.

41
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,110
So it's cool to speculate and to think, because really anything is possible.

42
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,610
So while this video plays out, this little quick one live video, I do want your opinion.

43
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,610
So please let me know in the comments section, whatever you want to say in a tweet.

44
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,610
What do you think is going to happen to Team Fortress 2?

45
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,610
Is it going to capsize in a couple of years?

46
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,610
Are they going to add something drastically different like Mann vs. Machine?

47
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,610
Or are we going to see Team Fortress 3 in like five years?

48
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,610
Nobody knows, but we can all speculate.

49
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,610
And that's the beauty of Team Fortress 2.

50
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,910
But that is going to wrap up the video, guys.

51
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,910
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

52
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,910
And I'm getting ready for PAX Prime. I'm packing my bag right now. It's almost full.

53
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,910
I got all kinds of stuff, all the stuff that I need.

54
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,910
And I can't wait to potentially see some of you guys there.

55
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,910
So on Sunday, on Sunday afternoon, I'm going to put a tweet out or something.

56
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,910
And make sure you're following my Twitter if you're going to PAX Prime.

57
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,910
Because I'm going to be tweeting out where I'm going and what I'm doing and all that sort of thing.

58
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,910
So please keep up to date with that if you want to meet me at PAX Prime.

59
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,910
And I'll see you guys all next time.

60
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,910
And of course, take care, everybody.
