1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,240
God damn it all. Here's a pyro on that point, fellas.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,160
Don't worry, I'll take care of this. I take care of pyros all the time.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,279
I do. Oh, what's this thing?

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:25,269
The new exciting game in TF2.

5
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:29,500
Watch the saw blades in Sawmill.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,299
You get one point for every person that walks directly into the saw.

7
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,429
There's one point already.

8
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:41,030
So I'm just going to sit here.

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,310
I'm going to sit here and just record this whole round, start to finish.

10
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:47,829
And we're going to see how many times people die on Sawmill to the blades.

11
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:49,829
Use the scientific method.

12
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,710
Roll up your sleeves, get out your safety goggles, because watch out.

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,390
We're going to see some type of chemical explosion from this experiment.

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,429
So get your flask ready.

15
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:58,710
Get your sodium fluoride ready.

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,909
We got a lot to talk about here.

17
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:00,630
Here we go.

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,890
This is the pyro.

19
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,770
Same guy.

20
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,730
Did the same thing.

21
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:05,849
That's one.

22
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:07,379
There's one.

23
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:15,510
Oh, there's two.

24
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:19,260
He didn't get his second double jump off in time.

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,189
This is like the most intense game of TF2 ever.

26
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,629
Just now, red is nearing capture.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,359
Oh, blue scout.

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,379
That was like a photo finish right there.

29
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:41,500
I think that guy got hit by the saw, but he just didn't register.

30
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:46,329
One of these guys is definitely going to walk into it.

31
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,129
I would be shocked.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,680
Okay, see, I told you.

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,519
I wonder if there's a way, like a server mod or something,

34
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,439
where you could have those saws go back and forth like a hundred miles per hour,

35
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,439
because there would be a hell of a lot more deaths if that was the case.

36
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, scout, he wants the health pack.

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,199
Place your bets.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,240
Didn't even have time to go to Vegas and place my bet.

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,909
Here's another skirmish.

40
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:21,349
When there's like three to four people standing on the point,

41
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,590
that's when you start to get the saw blade action.

42
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,629
Like for instance, I don't know what happened right there.

43
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,550
I'm not entirely sure what was happening.

44
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,110
I think, I think, I don't know.

45
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:33,669
He just wanted to go see his friends.

46
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:37,259
They have a sentry on here.

47
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:38,780
Red, you got to get that sentry off the point.

48
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,189
We need more saw deaths.

49
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:43,419
It is required.

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,580
It is a requirement.

51
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,770
We need more saw blade deaths.

52
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,729
This is not enough.

53
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,550
He just barely caught himself.

54
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,840
He still might walk into it.

55
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,379
It's definitely a high possibility at this point.

56
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,009
Oh, there it is.

57
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,129
There's another one.

58
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:15,610
See ya.

59
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,819
God, he got launched.

60
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,060
He got launched.

61
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,879
If red can hold this or blue needs to come take it.

62
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,639
Otherwise, wow, that was close.

63
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,479
Blue pyro coming in.

64
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,280
Bye bye.

65
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,919
There's another one.

66
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,430
Have a wonderful trip to saw blade hell.

67
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,919
Life will find a way.

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:05,699
Let's snipe her on it.

69
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:12,300
No, it's going to be blue team with a victory with I don't know how many saw deaths.

70
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,979
It was at least seven or eight.

71
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,980
I could seriously sit here all day.

72
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,139
I could sit here all day and do this and I probably will cancel all of my appointments

73
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,579
put everybody on hold because I don't really want to talk to them.

74
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,660
I want to watch people walk into saw blades.

75
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,699
That's like the number one.

76
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,660
That was almost that was pretty close.

77
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:41,189
All right.

78
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:45,560
And wait, wait till it wait till it comes until it comes back.

79
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,680
All right.

80
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,000
Ready?

81
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,800
Three, two, one, go.

82
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,779
It can't even do it.

83
00:04:58,949 --> 00:04:59,829
It couldn't even do it.

84
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:01,269
It was getting stuck on people.

85
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:04,649
Yeah.

86
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:07,100
How are you doing that?

87
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,220
You are a master all dudes pile on top of him.

88
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,180
Somebody trying to get on his head.

89
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,620
Can that work?

90
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,740
Can that actually be a thing?

91
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,740
Can you guys like ride on top of each other's heads?

92
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,990
I love everyone trying to attempt to do this.

93
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,629
This is great.

94
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:40,759
It's not seem to be working.

95
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,120
It's not seem to be working.

96
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,899
Oh, we got to get above the waterfall.

97
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:49,379
That's key.

98
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:50,819
If we can get above the waterfall.

99
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,279
Oh, no, oh, no, it's over.

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,100
Oh, who toppled Jenga.
