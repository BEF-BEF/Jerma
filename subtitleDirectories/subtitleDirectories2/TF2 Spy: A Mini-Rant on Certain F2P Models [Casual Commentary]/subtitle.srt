00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,949
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Germa here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:23,129
And tonight, we're gonna be playing as... I don't know. It could be anything. It could be the Scout, it could be the Engineer, it could be the Spy.

3
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:27,129
You know what? We're gonna have a bet. I do this too often, so we're gonna make this interesting.

4
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:35,780
If I'm not playing as the Scout, the Engineer, or the Spy, then you all just won 20 Germa bucks.

5
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,780
Now, you're probably wondering, what can I do with Germa bucks?

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:45,780
Well, you can head on over to the Germa store. There's one pretty much on every corner, every Walmart that exists.

7
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,780
There's at least two Germa stores. People think it's a little excessive, but I said, I didn't think so.

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,780
I think there had to be a Germa store on every single corner.

9
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,780
And there's like Germa koozies in there. You can put my face on a koozie.

10
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,780
There's a mouse pad in there you can get. There's a couple of little... This is not real. I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,959
Anyways, guys, we're gonna talk about a few things before I go completely crazy in this commentary.

12
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,959
First and foremost, this is gonna be casual commentary. As you probably could already tell, this is pretty casual.

13
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:21,959
I got my coffee here. I got my Razor Nostromo here, which I'm not gonna own in a couple of weeks,

14
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,959
because one of you guys is going to own this. Let me give you the story.

15
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:32,700
So I bought a Razor Nostromo the other day, well, like a week ago, and I can't get used to it.

16
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,700
It's advertised as a keyboard replacement for hardcore gamers.

17
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Like if you play games all the time on a keyboard, and you want to get like better comfort,

18
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,700
and you want more buttons and more flexibility, it's supposed to replace this whole keyboard.

19
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:53,700
And according to what people have said, once you try it, you never go back, and it's like the best thing ever.

20
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:01,700
But I didn't really have that experience. I've been playing PC games for like almost 20 years with a keyboard and mouse.

21
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,699
And this thing was just like putting my hand into a jar of mayonnaise. I could not get used to it.

22
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,699
So one of you guys is gonna get it. So I'm gonna ship it to you. We'll exchange addresses.

23
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:18,699
Do not put your address in the comments section. That is a very terrible idea. Don't do that.

24
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:26,699
If you win, I'll pick you. How to be eligible to win is just write a comment.

25
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:33,699
Make sure you write razor dash so I can decipher the comments so I'm not picking random people that don't want it.

26
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:38,699
That's how you can be chosen, and I'll get your address, and I'll ship it to you, and you can check it out for yourself.

27
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:49,819
And now that that's kind of over and done with, I want to talk about TF2 in a sense, because TF2 I think does this very well.

28
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:56,060
And we're gonna bring up another game that just recently released, and I was actually gonna make an entire video on this game,

29
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:04,060
but I scratched it because I did the commentary a few times and I really couldn't get it right because I didn't want to piss anybody off

30
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,060
and I didn't want to poke and prod at a company that I actually very highly respect.

31
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:17,919
We'll go into that in a second, but TF2 has a fantastic free-to-play model. I think we can all agree on that.

32
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:23,919
The free-to-play model, the freemium way that you play TF2 is very well done.

33
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:32,919
You don't have to buy anything. You can just play. You can just unlock items with achievements, and you can just play, and you'll get drops.

34
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,919
And none of the things that you unlock are better than the originals. Everything has a downside.

35
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,919
Nothing is just a pure straight upgrade than anything of the defaults. We can all agree on that. It's a great model.

36
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:51,419
I played Plants vs. Zombies 2, and I put probably five to six hours into Plants vs. Zombies 2,

37
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:57,909
and I gotta say, that game's really, really heavy with the in-app purchases.

38
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:05,909
It really encourages you to spend a ton of money inside that app store, inside Plants vs. Zombies 2.

39
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:13,409
And I was kind of shocked by this because, first of all, Plants vs. Zombies 2 is not even on PC.

40
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:20,779
I couldn't believe that. When I found out that Plants vs. Zombies 2 was not even installable on the PC,

41
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:27,019
it's only on iOS, I kind of had a little freak out. I was like, why would they do that?

42
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:32,019
Why wouldn't you just put it out on everything at the same time? But that's really besides the point.

43
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:37,379
Besides that, which I don't agree with, I didn't really agree with the way that they have purchases in the game.

44
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:42,379
You have to buy some of the old plants that we all used to use and we all used to love.

45
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:47,620
It actually costs money to continue playing through the game. If you get past the first ten levels,

46
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:54,620
and you don't go back and grind out stars, you have to spend five dollars to even continue the campaign.

47
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,620
So at that point, it's not even really free to play. It's more so free to download.

48
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,620
And if you want to buy some stuff, then like nudge nudge, like go for it. I don't really like that model.

49
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,620
It's a fantastic game. The game is great. I love Plants vs. Zombies 2. It's a very fun game.

50
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,930
But that's just kind of like, it's like taking a cup of coffee like I got right here.

51
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,100
And you got some very delicious coffee. You got like a Dunkin' Donuts, like fresh brewed coffee.

52
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:28,100
You fill it up like halfway with that. And then like Burger Boy comes over and blows a fucking snot rocket in it.

53
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,100
It's like, yeah, the coffee is still good. This is still going to be like a good coffee.

54
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,100
But Burger Boy just blew a snot in here. Like I don't want to, I guess I'll drink it.

55
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Like that's how I feel about Plants vs. Zombies 2.

56
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,660
And the reason why I bring up TF2, and I talked about TF2's free to play system, how I like it.

57
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,660
I think it works. And look at Dota 2. Dota 2 gives you everything for free.

58
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,660
They unlock all the champions for you. They just want you to go play.

59
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,660
And you'll end up spending money just because you like wanted to spend money in the game.

60
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,660
Now I know that I understand the argument here that you're talking about multiplayer games.

61
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,660
There's not much to a multiplayer game besides the multiplayer.

62
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,660
There is no single player campaign in TF2 or in Dota.

63
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,660
Now there is a single player campaign. That's the only thing there is to do in Plants vs. Zombies 2.

64
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:26,660
So it's justified that they make you buy things and spend money on things because you downloaded the game for free.

65
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,660
And you didn't give them any money at all. Whereas in a multiplayer game, eventually you might do it.

66
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,660
You might give money to a multiplayer game.

67
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,290
But the whole reason why I'm making this video is because I wanted to say this couple string of sentences

68
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,290
that I think really is a good analogy to this.

69
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,290
Analogy? Say words, Jerma, correctly, please.

70
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,459
A good analogy to this are airlines.

71
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:56,459
And I really don't want to see gaming and the free to play model go down the same road as the friggin' airlines.

72
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,459
And those of us that travel frequently will know exactly what I'm talking about here.

73
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,639
Once you go through security.

74
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,639
Okay, I bought my ticket. I'm ready to go through security. Let's go.

75
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,639
You go through security and you're stuck there.

76
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,639
You can't leave. You can't just like go to the TSA agent and be like,

77
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,639
hey, excuse me, can I like get out of here for like an hour and come?

78
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,639
But you can't do that. So everything in the airport is insanely expensive.

79
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,639
All the drinks, all the food, because they know you can't go anywhere else.

80
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,639
And they have you locked in the friggin' airline in the terminal.

81
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,639
So you have to spend the money or else you're just not going to get a drink today.

82
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,639
Like that. I don't want that to happen to gaming.

83
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,639
I don't want to like install a game and have a pop up window come up and say,

84
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,639
hey, thanks for installing the game. Glad you're having a ton of fun.

85
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,639
Wait like six dollars now or go fuck yourself.

86
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,639
Like I don't want that to happen.

87
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,069
And I really feel like we could be getting there soon.

88
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,069
So that's really all I want to say.

89
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:58,069
This is not a direct shot at PopCap because in the very beginning,

90
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:02,069
I said I have a lot of respect for PopCap because they make very good games.

91
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:04,439
But I just want to get that throw that out there,

92
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,439
throw that idea out there that I really don't want to see that happen.

93
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,439
And let me know what you think guys in the comments section.

94
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,439
If you still want to be eligible for the Razer Nostromo,

95
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,439
then with your comment about this topic,

96
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,439
just put Razer Dash and then your comment just so I can be able to know

97
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:23,439
that you still do want this Nostromo,

98
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,439
but you want to make a comment on this topic. That'll work too.

99
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,810
But yeah, guys, that's going to wrap it up here.

100
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,810
Thank you all so much for watching and really do appreciate it.

101
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,809
And I'll see you guys all next time.

102
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,809
And of course, take care, everybody.
