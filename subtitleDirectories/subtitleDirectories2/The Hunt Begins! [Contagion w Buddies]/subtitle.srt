1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:12,390
How many how many like mini Milky Way candy bars do you think it takes to make like one candy bar?

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:19,800
You know I'm talking about I would say five. Oh shit. Yeah

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
I've eaten like fucking 19

4
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:34,340
Does that mean I've eaten like four candy bars, all right, so that's not good

5
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,210
Hunted what was this game? What's called hunted? Yeah, I think so

6
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,850
So it's probably a terrible idea for me to try to jump. No, I'm not doing that screw that

7
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:49,549
I'm not jumping up on like one of the tents. Ah

8
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:58,899
Somebody's real trigger happy who was just shooting their gun. Yeah, I just hear somebody just bang bang bang bang. Somebody's in trouble

9
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:09,900
Oh, okay. Okay. No, okay. Probably should not have just done that. Oh my god

10
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:12,260
What

11
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:22,459
I showed you like three times in the chest and you're telling me you golf club being like the forearm and I die

12
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:29,299
So where are you where the talks? Where are you right now? I want I'm gonna give you some hints

13
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:38,530
No, just give me one hint on where you are. There's grass. Just grass. That's a great hint. It's Alex. Very very good hint

14
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,799
I appreciate the hint. There's more tense than we were

15
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:51,450
Next to you. I'll say that much describe the tents to me in detail. What do they smell like what?

16
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,450
Give me some landmarks and some like sightseeing that you could potentially like close to me or something

17
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:05,829
No, I don't know. Am I I don't know. I was just trying to figure out why you're focusing on me specifically

18
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:09,639
I know like

19
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,229
No, who wants to do a duel who wants to play let's play Marco Polo, okay, who wants to play

20
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,419
Marco

21
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,319
Okay Marco

22
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,770
No, you're further away

23
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,710
Marco, I didn't even hear that bullet. So you didn't

24
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,210
No, it don't matter because you know games. Oh

25
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:53,289
It don't matter because the game's over

26
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,930
What

27
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,460
Hold on that was that was not out correct

28
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,379
Cuz we were playing I thought I thought that was coming from that direction

29
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:15,500

31
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:34,349
Are you really gonna break the Marco Polo rope? I did way more than that. Whatever. You can still hear the directions

32
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:40,849
There you go. He's just like hunting us both. Yeah boo. He's been like dead silent this whole time

33
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,240
I'm shooting as well. Yeah stealth is a zombie. I feel like he's this person behind me

34
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,180
Like this one right here. Oh

35
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,129
Son of a bitch is that stealth right there?

36
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:11,180
Um, I need to alright you need to do polo again like 30 more times. Oh my god

37
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,560

00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:06,819
Think I'm near someone how nervous is this making you jammer? Really nervous. What makes you more nervous using the phone?

44
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:11,839
I'm buzzing someone nearby or not using the phone and thinking shit. Maybe someone's near but

45
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,470
Is that you trying to tell me something boo? Are you in fact nearby right now?

46
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,250

Hello hiding in the dark, I see I know where you are. I didn't even see you until I was waiting

67
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,660
I was waiting there in the attic. I saw Jerma's panic attack underneath me when he was shooting zombies

68
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,660
And I was just gonna wait for him to come up in the attic, but he never you ran out of the house, dude

70
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660

00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:12,410
Already, I can't get out of the door

00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:22,199
Okay, I get me out of here. Is there a kind of climb this ladder? Thank God

76
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,230
This place I spawned with a ton of zombies around me

78
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:36,460

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,210
Who killed me?

80
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:47,019
I spawned with like ten zombies underneath me climb up a ladder and get shot in the face and fall down ladder and die

81
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,779
Great. You had your flashlight on

82
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
You should have like a flashlight on around

83
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,139
No, I've learned my lesson. No more flashlights unless it's necessary

84
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:05,190
Unless it is totally necessary

85
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,570
What am I gonna do with a pocket light?

86
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,570
In fact, it might be necessary right now

87
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,259
What can I loot?

88
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:19,929
Oh that is a ladder

89
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:23,929
Right when I turn it on really? Who's up there? Who is up there? Are you on a roof?

90
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:27,679
Where are you?

91
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,679
I saw those traces coming down from like the top. Yeah, they're on the roof. They're on the roof

92
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,820
How did you get on the roof? You are legitimately you are like spider-man on the roof

93
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,639
Do you sling some fucking web to get up there?

94
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,639
That was bullshit
