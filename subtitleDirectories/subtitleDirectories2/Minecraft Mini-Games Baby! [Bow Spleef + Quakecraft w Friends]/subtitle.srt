1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:07,450
Um, people are just spawning in here like crazy.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,419
Oh my gosh, there's so many people in here.

3
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:12,859
Let me see if I can find you guys.

4
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:15,289
Oh my.

5
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:23,059
I feel like somebody just opened up a server for the first time and just told the White House to shout it out.

6
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,059
There's thousands of people on these servers.

7
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:36,939
I feel like I'm at a costume party.

8
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,740
Like, oh hey look it's Batman, or it's like a sexy nurse.

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,659
Is this Halloween server? This is what I feel like we're playing right now.

10
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,299
I see Link, I see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, I see Spider-Man. I'm Deadpool right now.

11
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,500
Yeah, this is like the biggest costume party we've ever been to.

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Jerma, where are you?

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
I see you. You, like, bearded king thing.

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Oh, there he is, he's Jimbo.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,500
I remember when we made that for you.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,909
It's so dumb.

17
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,909
There's a lot of people here, man.

18
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,909
This is gonna be complete chaos.

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,750
There's like gonna be 24 people doing this.

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,989
This is gonna be awesome.

21
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:22,989
We're gonna insta-die.

22
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:24,989
I don't think this is gonna happen.

23
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,989
I might as well just shoot my feet right when the game starts.

24
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:28,989
Oh, here it goes!

25
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,989
What? What?

26
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:32,989
Now we got 15 seconds to spread out.

27
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:34,989
They're still spreading out!

28
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:36,989
You do not get a bow.

29
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:38,989
You don't get a bow?

30
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:40,989
I don't know. It looks like you're supposed to get hit.

31
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:42,989
Alright, it's starting in one second.

32
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:44,989
Oh, you do get a bow!

33
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:47,829
I just shot that guy in the face.

34
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,829
This guy, get away from me, dude.

35
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,010
Oh, get dropped.

36
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,010
Get elevated.

37
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,010
Hello?

38
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,010
Is my name still a different color?

39
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,569
Is my name still a different color?

40
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:08,569
No, it's not.

41
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,569
I'm doing what it's Alex is doing.

42
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,569
I'm looking at the ground.

43
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:17,409
I almost just killed myself.

44
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:19,409
You almost just killed yourself.

45
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,409
No, please!

46
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,409
Come here!

47
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,409
Oh, no!

48
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:27,409
Tino, leave me alone!

49
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:29,409
Tino, get away from me!

50
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,409
No!

51
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,409
Come on!

52
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:37,409
This guy's standing still! Get the guy that's standing still!

53
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,409
What?

54
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,409
We're the last three and then we make our own rules to finish the minigame.

55
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,250
Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't you try.

56
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,250
I'm not going to attack any of you guys until we're the only ones left.

57
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,250
It's going to be hard either way.

58
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,250
Tio, stop attacking Jerma.

59
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,250
I want to kill Jerma!

60
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,250
You can. Trust me.

61
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,419
I can't make them fall.

62
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,419
All of us go for those two in the car.

63
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,419
No!

64
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,419
I know!

65
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,419
I know.

66
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,419
Alright, I got my money.

67
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,259
But I'm going to...

68
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,259
I got my money on Tio.

69
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,259
Tio's still in this, huh?

70
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:19,259
Tio's riding the circumference.

71
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:21,259
He's going around the circle. That's a good idea.

72
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,259
Are you dead as well?

73
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,259
Oh, he's right there. Look.

74
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,259
It's just you three and then this other guy with the...

75
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:29,259
Real's nagging for me. Real's frozen.

76
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:31,259
Oh, he's gone.

77
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:33,259
Oh, no!

78
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:35,259
Oh, no!

79
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,259
That's awesome!

80
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,259
It was lagging!

81
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:46,099
You just teleported around in a circle and then just dropped through the center.

82
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,099
God damn it.

83
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,469
Oh!

84
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,469
Oh, it's Alex is alive. I thought he died.

85
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:57,539
Oh, I got one!

86
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,539
Oh, my game froze.

87
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,539
You're still there.

88
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,539
It's my time. I'm going to die.

89
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,539
No, that guy hasn't...

90
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,539
Oh, no! Please!

91
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,539
No! No!

92
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,379
He just walked off again.

93
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,379
Oh. Oh.

94
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,379
All right, it's Alex. You've got to prove your worth here.

95
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:18,379
Oh, we can still watch from up here?

96
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:20,379
Yeah. Oh, that was a pretty sick shot.

97
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:23,139
Oh!

98
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,139
You've got to lead him. Lead the target.

99
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,139
Oh, it just fell down!

100
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:33,310
Look, this guy didn't even need to do anything. He's just walking around in a circle.

101
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,310
There we go. It's on.

102
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,680
Who's going to get smoked?

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,110
Oh, Tio goes in with the first blood.

104
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,189
Peanut-pone.

105
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:45,189
Oh, Alex!

106
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:47,689
Where were you?

107
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,689
I was on the rafters.

108
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,689
Oh, this guy spawned camp in the stairs.

109
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,689
Oh, my God.

110
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:55,689
Where the hell were you?

111
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:58,120
Right behind you.

112
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
Ah, there's explosives all around me.

113
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,420
Little snake.

114
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,420
Oh, baby.

115
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,420
No, don't kill me, please.

116
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,790
I don't think so, stealth. It's nice to meet you across the map.

117
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,790
God, I feel like I'm playing like direct hit soldier right now.

118
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:13,629
Oh, Tio, if I had killed you from that shot, oh, my goodness.

119
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,629
The 360!

120
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:17,629
Get me out of there.

121
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:19,629
Oh, hi, Tio!

122
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:21,629
I did get him.

123
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:23,629
No, I spawned kill you from my spawn.

124
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,629
The reverse spawn kill.

125
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,629
The reverse spawn kill.

126
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:30,379
I always feel like somebody's behind me.

127
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,379
Check my back.

128
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,379
God damn it!

129
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,379
This music doesn't fit at all, by the way.

130
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,379
I always have music turned off.

131
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,379
It's like...

132
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,379
It's like the most peaceful music.

133
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:46,379
Hold on a second. I gotta turn this up.

134
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,939
Turn it up.

135
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:50,939
It doesn't fit at all.

136
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:52,939
This is pretty good, like, let's kill each other music.

137
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:54,939
Didn't feel like chasing you around the map.

138
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,939
I didn't feel like chasing you.

139
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,939
I got you, friend.

140
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:00,939
I didn't kill you with that?

141
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:02,939
God damn it!

142
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,939
Oh, yeah.

143
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,939
God.

144
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,939
Oh, come on now.

145
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:11,569
God, stealth.

146
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,410
I don't know why, but anytime I can, I jump.

147
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,410
Stealth, I'm so sorry.

148
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,410
Don't worry, I got revenge for you.

149
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,410
I just heard you, like, upset.

150
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,410
Like, in complaint.

151
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,410
I right-clicked, I was like, I probably shouldn't.

152
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,410
And I did.

153
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,410
I don't know why, but I always jump off something.

154
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,410
Very tip-top for fun.

155
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,410
I'd be a horrible tactician.

156
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,410
This is what I do.

157
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,410
And we jump off.

158
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,410
I run to the top as fast as I can.

159
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,410
And just make a leap off the top.

160
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,250
I honestly just can't believe it.

161
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,620
You can do this without installing any mods.

162
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,620
Yeah, it's completely mod-free on the user end.

163
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,790
Where is everybody?

164
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,160
What's going on here?

165
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
I got teleported to a different part of the map where

166
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
no enemies were.

167
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Except for me.

168
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Oh, okay, here we go.

169
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Alright, alright, fine.

170
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
You stood still, I thought I got you.

171
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
No, you...

172
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
God!

173
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
I saw you pick your little cactus head up over the blocks.

174
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,430
I got you.

175
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,430
I gotta stop looking over that edge.

176
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,430
It's like the death of me.

177
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,430
Oh my god, I am gonna freak out.

178
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,430
Oh, hey!

179
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,430
Jerma and Tio, the last two people I killed,

180
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,430
returned to their crime scenes.

181
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,430
No, no!

182
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,430
Alright, I'm not dying again.

183
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,430
I'm not dying like five times in a row.

184
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,430
I'm gonna go on a spree.

185
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,430
Yeah, that's what's going on for me as well.

186
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,430
That's my plan also.

187
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,430
We're making like a little choo-choo train here.

188
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:42,269
Ask Tio, who I was stalking,

189
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:44,269
and it shoots me instead.

190
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:46,509
I'm going down in like the spider kingdom.

191
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,689
If you wanna meet me down in the spider kingdom,

192
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,689
you're welcome to come try.

193
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,689
Where is the spider kingdom?

194
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,689
You don't know where the spider kingdom is?

195
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:56,689
Oh!

196
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:58,689
I knew it!

197
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:00,930
Oh, hello!

198
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,930
Tio, why are you there?

199
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,930
I run the spider kingdom.

200
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,930
Whoa.

201
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,930
Take that, Tio!

202
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:12,779
Career.

203
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,079
Are you trying to tell me that that didn't...

204
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,079
Okay, I was gonna say.

205
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,079
Jumped up 360!

206
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,079
Oh! You got me!

207
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,079
And Tio gets...

208
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,079
That was a long shot.

209
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,319
Jerma!

210
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,319
I was about to kill that guy.

211
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,319
I know, it's Alex!

212
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,320
Oh! I missed twice and you still got me!

213
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Who killed me from behind?

214
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Oh, it was...

215
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,480
I don't even know who the hell hit me from behind.

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Stealthy's one more point.

217
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
And he wins the golden cup!

218
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,559
Oh, wow.

219
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,559
It's Alex. Get down from there, you kid.

220
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,559
Oh, baby.

221
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,559
Come back, come back!

222
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,759
Somebody show me your body!

223
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,759
It's Alex, can't win.

224
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,830
Ah!

225
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,220
Is he one more?

226
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,220
No!

227
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,169
From the top turnbuckle.

228
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:13,169
Hi, it's Alex!

229
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,169
Hey!

230
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:18,009
Yay!

231
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:20,009
I'm so mad!
