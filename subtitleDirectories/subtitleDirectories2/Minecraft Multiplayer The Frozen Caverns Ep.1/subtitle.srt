1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:08,589
Minecraft, Minecraft, Minecraft.

2
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:11,589
Oops, that was the wrong one, wasn't it?

3
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:14,279
Hey, what is going on everybody?

4
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:17,280
Jerma here with a new Minecraft series.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,280
And a lot of people have been asking me.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,280
They said, Jerma, what happened to JermaCraft?

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,280
I know you ended it at that 10 episodes,

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,280
but are we gonna get any more Minecraft?

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,280
And here's the answer.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,579
Absolutely, my friend.

11
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:32,579
And on the screen right now,

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,579
I'll give you a couple of lowdown of the maps and who I'm playing with.

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,579
So the map is gonna be the Frozen Caverns,

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,579
is the name of this survival map.

15
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,579
And I'm not sure how far I'm gonna go with this.

16
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:45,579
I'm not sure how many episodes.

17
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,579
I don't think I'm gonna have like 55 million episodes.

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,579
But I'm gonna get enough where you guys can see some of the funny things,

19
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,579
some of the highlights, some of the interesting things that happened.

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,579
And the people in this video, this is with Lepter1,

21
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,579
who a lot of you know of, and Italics.

22
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:01,579
And both of those links, of course, will be in the description.

23
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:02,579
Go check them out.

24
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,579
Two cool dudes in my personal opinion.

25
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,579
So what do you say we get this started?

26
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:09,579
And before I go any further, I forgot to mention,

27
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:14,579
both of these two guys, they're gonna be doing videos of this series on their own channels.

28
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:16,579
So if you want to see it from somebody else's perspective

29
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:19,579
or from a different viewpoint, then definitely go check them out.

30
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,890
So let's get this started now.

31
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,890
Everybody, I hope you enjoy the video.

32
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,890
And I will see you all soon.

33
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,890
Take care, everybody.

34
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,890
Zombie up here.

35
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,379
Oh, don't worry, take care.

36
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,650
The zombie's got nothing.

37
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,230
Oh, God.

38
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,230
Oh, God.

39
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,230
I just said something.

40
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,230
Something just exploded.

41
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,299
That would be me.

42
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,299
This guy is like whooping my butt.

43
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:49,180
It's okay, I'm just collecting a ton of snowballs

44
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,180
from which we will make a ton.

45
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,180
And I mean a ton.

46
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,180
We've got a tag team this guy.

47
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,180
There we go.

48
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,180
Okay, we were just like hammering on that guy and he didn't die.

49
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,549
All right, what do we have in here?

50
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:03,980
We have some leather and we have some fishing rods.

51
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,980
Fishing rods.

52
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,980
I will fish.

53
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,980
We can make food.

54
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,980
Yeah.

55
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,979
We can make armor with that, can't we?

56
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,979
We have an Enderman up there.

57
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,979
Yes.

58
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,860
All right.

59
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,860
I dare you to throw a snowball at the Enderman.

60
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,860
Dare you.

61
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,740
What?

62
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,740
He's gone.

63
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,740
I don't even know where he went.

64
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,740
Hold on.

65
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,740
Oh, there he is.

66
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,180
Oh, this is not going to end well.

67
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,180
You can't double dog dare me.

68
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,800
I'll always do it.

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
No, I'm running.

70
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Lepter is using up the fishing rod on the Enderman.

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,509
Get out of here, you tall bastard.

72
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:48,069
Jerma, you can jump and do crit hits.

73
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,069
Yeah.

74
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,069
My food.

75
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,069
All right, so that was good.

76
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,069
I've already got six rotten flesh.

77
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,069
All right, so before taking on hard areas, prepare yourself.

78
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,069
That's over here.

79
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:01,069
Oh, skeleton.

80
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:03,069
Watch out, there's a skeleton on your left.

81
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,210
Jump and crit this guy.

82
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,990
Man, we are not even going to make it out of the starting.

83
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,990
He is freaking out.

84
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,990
OK.

85
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,990
All right, so is there anything else that we need to know about this place?

86
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,379
Maybe underneath.

87
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,379
I'm going ice fishing, baby.

88
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:25,379
Should we go down?

89
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,379
But the point is we're trying to find records, right?

90
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:33,379
Right, but we also have to find supplies to live off of.

91
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,379
Well, I'm sinking like a goddamn rock.

92
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,379
Oh, God.

93
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:42,379
All right, just use the charge attacks to push them back.

94
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:44,379
Wait, what do you mean charge attack?

95
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,379
If you double tap, you sprint, and then if you hit them while sprinting,

96
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:48,379
it pushes them back.

97
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,879
I got a bone.

98
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,879
What just happened?

99
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,879
Good job luring.

100
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,699
Jerma ran right in there.

101
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,699
I used my charge and dodge.

102
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:08,699
This was a nice ice cave until that fateful explosion.

103
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:09,699
There's a sign up here, guys.

104
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:11,699
I knew I saw something earlier.

105
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:12,699
Really?

106
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:15,509
Well, look at this hallway.

107
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:17,879
This looks eerie.

108
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,879
All right, I'm making some more snow.

109
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,879
I'll be back to check on that.

110
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,879
There's something else in there, guys.

111
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,879
We'll have to go back in a second.

112
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,879
We'll die.

113
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,879
Is there?

114
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,879
A lot.

115
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,879
So it's OK.

116
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:30,379
Junction one, no records.

117
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:31,379
What does that mean?

118
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,379
Oh.

119
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,379
Start.

120
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:34,379
I got it.

121
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:35,379
Start your zone one record.

122
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,379
Oh, no.

123
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:38,379
Bye, Lepter.

124
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,379
Oh, no.

125
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,379
Did you guys just both fall off?

126
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:42,379
Yes.

127
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:43,379
How am I still up here?

128
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,379
I'm like the stupid one of the group.

129
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:47,379
There's a hole in the glass.

130
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:50,189
Oh, I'm looking through it right now.

131
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:54,189
I'm like right below the bridge.

132
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:55,189
Stay here.

133
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:59,189
Just take this stuff and keep it safe.

134
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:00,189
OK.

135
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:02,189
Just don't fall.

136
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:03,189
Hey, guys.

137
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:05,189
There's skeletons in that tower.

138
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:06,189
I know.

139
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:07,189
Watch out.

140
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:08,189
I'm going to get knocked down by them.

141
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:09,189
It's going to be gruesome.

142
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:12,189
It's going to be like the other recording, you and I.

143
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:15,189
Oh, we should not have thrown all those snowballs.

144
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,189
Yeah, I need them.

145
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:19,189
Dude, those archers are just aiming for you.

146
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,189
You're going to get like toasted.

147
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,189
I'm past them.

148
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,189
There's a chest all the way down there, though.

149
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,189
All right.

150
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:27,189
So I got over to here.

151
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:30,189
I'm going to fill in any blatant holes.

152
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:32,189
So we have at least like a two block.

153
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:34,189
Are they shooting at you?

154
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:36,189
No, I'm just like throwing snowballs at them.

155
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:38,189
We need to make the snowballs into snowballs.

156
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:41,189
Don't throw snowballs.

157
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:46,009
I didn't figure that out until it was too late.

158
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:47,009
All right.

159
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:49,009
Look over there in the corner with all those.

160
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:51,009
I got over here.

161
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,009
Should we follow you?

162
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:54,009
Well, you can.

163
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:55,009
I mean, don't fall.

164
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:56,009
Run.

165
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:57,009
Yeah.

166
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:58,009
No, don't run.

167
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,009
You don't need to run.

168
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:00,009
Oh, no, don't run.

169
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,009
You're out of their reach.

170
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,269
That's not a good idea.

171
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:05,269
And watch out for the holes in the ground.

172
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,269
Yeah.

173
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,269
Watch out.

174
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,269
I'm filling in a two wide.

175
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,269
How do you make those blocks?

176
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,269
Is it four snowballs?

177
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,269
Yeah, it's a four snowball thing.

178
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:13,579
All right.

179
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:18,579
So if you guys walk here, it's black ice caves.

180
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,579
I have one record.

181
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:27,009
Good thing we didn't make, you know, leather stuff.

182
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,009
I just fell in the lava.

183
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:30,009
Yeah.

184
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,009
Oh, you fell in the lava?

185
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,009
Yeah.

186
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:34,009
That was that was what the was.

187
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,009
Oh, that was what that noise was.

188
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:37,009
Yes.

189
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:38,009
That's what that was.

190
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:41,009
I'm about to run out of food.

191
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,009
I got I got 13 blocks.

192
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,009
There's a tree down there.

193
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,009
That's what we need.

194
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:47,009
All right.

195
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,009
I'm going to get that tree.

196
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,949
All right.

197
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:52,949
So I'm going to fall and I'm going to die.

198
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:55,899
No, you don't say that.

199
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,899
I can't believe I died.

200
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:59,899
I see more of those.

201
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:00,899
Take more of these blocks.

202
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:05,220
Take some more of that ice cream.

203
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,230
Is that all you have?

204
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,600
Yeah, that's all I have.

205
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
I thought we were saved for a second.

206
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Jerma comes to the rescue.

207
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
No.

208
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Oh, I know.

209
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Wait, maybe, maybe we do because I have a bunch of clay.

210
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
All right.

211
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,600
I got down here.

212
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Oh, we have mine carts and mine tracks, which are useless to us.

213
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Here we have some.

214
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,600
I'm going to get this tree down.

215
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Cut this tree down.

216
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
We need to save it for Christmas.

217
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
That is a Christmas tree.

218
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,779
If I ever saw one, it's it's nighttime.

219
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:40,779
It's nighttime, guys.

220
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:43,779
Just let you know.

221
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,779
So we got to build a shelter like ASAP.

222
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:50,779
It's about to get real nasty.

223
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:54,980
We missed what you missed the block of wood up there.

224
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,110
Oh, look down here, guys.

225
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,170
Oh, you guys.

226
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,170
OK.

227
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,170
Oh, my God.

228
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,170
I just.

229
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,170
Oh, my God.

230
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,170
I'm OK.

231
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,170
Lepter.

232
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,170
I'm not OK.

233
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,170
I died.

234
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,170
What happened?

235
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,170
I dropped down on a pressure plate.

236
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,170
Oh, there's just like pressure bomb plates all over the place.

237
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,170
Apparently.

238
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,170
I will not.

239
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,170
Oh, my God.

240
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,170
So should I eat this bread parkour over that zombie?

241
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,170
What?

242
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,170
How hungry are you?

243
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,170
How bad are you?

244
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,170
I'm not that hungry, but I'm going to die.

245
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,170
He's going to make it past the creeper.

246
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,170
Yes, he does.

247
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,169
If you are going to die, then go ahead and eat it.

248
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,169
All right.

249
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,169
I'm going to eat it.

250
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,169
Oh, God.

251
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,429
That was delicious.

252
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,429
What did what did you eat?

253
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:44,610
What was your bread selection?

254
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,610
It was a piece of old stale sourdough bread.

255
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,360
It's all in your mind, man.

256
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
That was probably like artisan bread.

257
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,659
You know, that was like like cheese bread.
