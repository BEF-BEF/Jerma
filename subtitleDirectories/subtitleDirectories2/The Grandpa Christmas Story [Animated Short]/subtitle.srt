00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,620
The story you'll hear is heartwarming and charming, although some of you may find it alarming.

2
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:24,500
On a napkin I write some ink and a nail. I'm writing, of course, from the old county jail.

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:32,859
Those fuckers got me, as you can plainly see. What do I do now, besides take a pee?

4
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:40,789
Arrested for much I'm about to explain. Sit back and relax while my words entertain.

5
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:48,259
Our story unfolds on a cold Christmas Eve, a two pairs of socks night, if you could believe.

6
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:54,649
The TV was loud and just how I like it. Fodded 30 times, trust me, I counted.

7
00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:02,280
What a glorious night, not a care in the world. Nothing could ruin this holiday, this great...

8
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm having a really good time. Really, I can't think of what rhymes with world for this current situation.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So it was just fun. Sipping my tea and eating my crackers, an annoying voice came up through the rafters.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,840
It's Christmas Eve, Grandpa. This is not good. There are no gifts from you underneath that hood.

11
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,439
Of that beautiful tree that we spent so much time making. I'm not messing around and I am not faking.

12
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,819
Get your ass out of that chair and into the snow or Christmas is ruined. Hurry up and go.

13
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:40,980
Jerma sucks. That's all that needs to be said. I really wish he would permanently go to bed.

14
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:48,519
Standing up from my wonderful man station. God damn it, my procrastination. Stores were all closed.

15
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:54,280
Nothing was open. This new found bad news, I was having trouble coping. I had to think fast.

16
00:01:54,359 --> 00:02:01,980
There was just no more time. I was all out of options. So it came to a crime.

17
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,539
The night came quick and I acted with swiftness. For there's only so much you can steal on Christmas.

18
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:14,919
Out through the door there was no looking back. It was time to rip off a neighborhood ass crack.

19
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:21,719
Down the street I trotted on my imaginary horse. The hallucinatic drugs I took were running their course.

20
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:28,599
Through my body and blood it made things all hazy. This house looks good. But was I going crazy?

21
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:34,889
There was nobody home, not a light in the house. I got off my steed and creeped close like a mouse.

22
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:40,169
Dressed all in black from my head to my toe, I smashed through the front window with a perfect

23
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:45,539
brick throw. Climbing through the clearing I slithered like a snake. No one's home though.

24
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,199
I could have been a fucking earthquake. Once inside I went right for the jewelry.

25
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:56,810
Because that's the most expensive. There is no tomfoolery. On my way out I left an IOU.

26
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:03,610
If I ever would pay it. Not sure if that would be true. Into the brisk wind from which I first came,

27
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,930
a cruiser was waiting. They were ready to tame. This old man can still run, I shouted and screamed.

28
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,009
A sharp pain I felt shooting into my spleen. I was feeling the wrath of over 5,000 volts.

29
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:22,889
My body struck down like a lightning bolt. A taser, really? I'm an old man for Christ's sake.

30
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:29,289
Every single inch of my body did ache. Into the back of the cruiser we rolled through the night.

31
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:34,889
I heard them joke and giggle about my pathetic attempts to fight. I don't blame them though.

32
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:40,330
It was really dumb. Would I take it all back? Was I feeling numb? Do I plead insanity?

33
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,379
Shit myself in the backseat? Punch myself in the face and blame it on Wall Street?

34
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:52,969
No. I think not. I'll do my time. I've made the mistakes put forth in this rhyme.

35
00:03:52,969 --> 00:04:00,539
Sitting in this cell with much time to think. Not being with the people I love really does stink.

36
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:08,490
So remember this tale this holiday season. Don't do dumb shit. For absolutely no reason.

37
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,090
Happy holidays everyone.
