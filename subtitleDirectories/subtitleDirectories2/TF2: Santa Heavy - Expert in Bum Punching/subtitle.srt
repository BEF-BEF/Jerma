Hello ladies and gentlemen. It's me, Santa Claus. I found my way into Team Fortress 2.

2
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:28,530
And it's going to be a very holiday, cheerful, and exciting video today. We're going to punch people in the bums.

00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:38,079
It's time to see who's on the naughty list. Let me have some chocolate before I do this. Right from Prancer's ass.

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:52,070
That was gross. Why did I say that? Here we go. Get up there you fat bastard. Oh my god. What a fail. Oh my god.

5
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:58,039
Geez man, the chocolate bar is a piece of crap for trying to just heal yourself.

6
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,039
I got two targets right here. There's a sentry. They know the sentry's over here. It's okay.

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:18,700
