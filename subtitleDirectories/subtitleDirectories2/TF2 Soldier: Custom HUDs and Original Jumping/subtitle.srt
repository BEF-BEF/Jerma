00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,439
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:24,440
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier with the original, the default shotgun and the strange equalizer.

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,440
There you go, I almost got those two mixed up.

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,619
And yes, I have a cold again. Again. I don't know what it is, but it's definitely from coming back from California.

5
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:39,619
And all the craziness that happened the last week. And of course the pollen here, so yes, I am sick again.

6
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:47,619
And I could probably explain why I get sick more often than I should, but that is a tale for a different time.

7
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:51,619
But I'll give you this. I take immunosuppressants for my Crohn's disease.

8
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:55,619
And that's kind of the reason why I get more sick. So we'll leave it at that.

9
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:02,289
But anyways, I have a custom HUD now. A lot of you are probably wondering, a lot of the old subscribers,

10
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:07,459
if you have been on this channel since day one, I've never had a custom HUD. Ever.

11
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:14,459
For any reason, I've only used the default and I've made the minimal HUD. I checked the minimal HUD box and the advanced options.

12
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,900
But I've never downloaded and installed a custom HUD. And I really don't know why.

13
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,900
I don't know why I take so long to do these things. It took me forever to turn on fast weapon switch.

14
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Took me forever to turn on the damage indicators even, the sound indicators.

15
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,900
And I mean, I've been playing this game since beta, since TF2 beta. And I don't know. I don't know why.

16
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:40,069
I can't tell you a reason why. But now that I've done it, I will never go back.

17
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:46,069
These custom HUDs, they are so much better. They just free up the screen. You can see much more of what's going on.

18
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:51,069
It's much more minimal, much more condensed. And if you want the link to the one that I'm using right now,

19
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:55,069
it will be in the description. And it's courtesy of Star.

20
00:01:55,069 --> 00:02:00,379
I think Star told me this is a mix of Garmin HUD and something else.

21
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:05,620
I don't remember what it was. But I think he made it. I think he screwed around with it and did some settings.

22
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,620
But there's a link to Star's HUD, which is now my HUD. So thank you, Star. I appreciate it.

23
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,860
And I'm going to use this till the day I die. Unless, of course, I find something better,

24
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,860
which leads me into the kind of question of the video. What HUD do you guys use?

25
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,860
And what HUD do you recommend? Because I know there are a million Team Fortress 2 HUDs.

26
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,860
There's PV HUD, Eve HUD, Franken HUD, Burger Boy HUD, Burger Boy HUD 2.

27
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,860
I mean, there are so many HUDs. Those last two don't exist, by the way.

28
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,860
But there are so many HUDs in this game that it can really become overwhelming.

29
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,860
And I think that's one of the reasons why I never tried. Because I heard of all these HUDs.

30
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,860
Let me download this one. Oh, this one. Which one do I even want? And they all look pretty different.

31
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,159
So I think that's one of the reasons why I never did it. But now I have jumped into the custom HUD glory.

32
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,909
And I'm ready to try. So now I want to talk about the gameplay for a minute or two.

33
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:04,909
I want to talk about the original because in the entirety of this channel,

34
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:10,909
there's only been one other discussion or one other video talking about the original or even showing the original.

35
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:14,090
But what I want to talk about is rocket jumping with this thing.

36
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,330
Now, I am not a pro rocket jumper by any means, but I do know the basics.

37
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,330
I've done jump maps before. I know how to do general rocket jumping.

38
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,330
I know the mechanics. I know how to wallbang and stuff like that.

39
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,569
But because the rockets in the original come right out of the middle of the screen,

40
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:34,569
you have to overcompensate a little bit when you try to do a turn crouch jump forward jump.

41
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:39,569
And it really launches you a lot higher than you would go forward, if that makes any sense at all.

42
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:45,939
But in condensed terms, you're pretty much shooting at your toes rather than at the ground behind you.

43
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:50,370
And there's a pretty good example of this happening. I think it's in like 30 seconds or so.

44
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,370
I try to jump over those two cargo train things that are on the middle of the point.

45
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,370
And instead, I just go straight in the air and land kind of straight down.

46
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,370
And that's not what I intended. But of course, I'm using the original. So that's why that happened.

47
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,990
But of course, it comes down to using the item and getting used to it.

48
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,990
I had a video go up about the Liberty launcher not that long ago talking about the rocket speed

49
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,990
and how going back and forth between different rocket launchers can really screw with your muscle memory.

50
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,990
But that's something you need to work on. That's something you have to pick.

51
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:26,300
You got to just go with it and you got to try it. But that is going to wrap up this video, guys.

52
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,300
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

53
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,300
And again, leave me a comment on this video telling me what your favorite HUD is,

54
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,300
because I'm probably just going to download all of them and then install them one right after the other

55
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,300
to see which one I like the best. So I mean, that might take a little while, but I'm willing to try it.

56
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,300
So anyways, guys, thank you again. I will see you all soon. And take care, everybody.
