1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:10,230
Oh, you're hurting the the defenseless heavy. You're hitting the defenseless like toupee heavy.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:18,469
He's trying to holiday punch people, see? What'd you do? I didn't do anything!

3
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:48,340
This guy is just... you're missing... he's missing over and over again. Dude,

4
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:54,969
maybe you should get a little closer instead of just like shooting long-range rockets at me.

5
00:00:54,969 --> 00:01:03,289
What the fuck are you doing? What? Dude, I can't believe... what just happened?

6
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:12,120
That was out... okay. Are people just blind right now? What is going on? That guy was a spy.

7
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,469
Oh my god, I've never seen such a well-decorated last point. Yeah, I'm looking at this right now.

8
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:26,549
I'm looking at it on Spectator, it's hilarious. Oh, that sick like surround sound setup you guys got

9
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:33,989
there. It's like Dolby 5.1 up there. It really is. I'm gonna do a coffee commentary of Doom. Oh,

10
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:40,790
you want to do a coffee commentary of Justice and Doom? Yes. Headshot. I want to show you how we

11
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,230
headshot, we headshot, and this is how we headshot. We should've been the face and we should've been

12
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,909
the bum. That is how we do it. One and a two and a three and a four and one and a two and a three

13
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,629
and a four. Three headshots in a row. What do you know about that?

14
00:01:50,629 --> 00:02:07,780
Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot.

15
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:18,500
Hey, Star, where are you? You wanted to make save? Are you serious?

16
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,669
You freaked out and you like swept around. You weren't even there. You weren't even...

17
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:30,550
You're a ghost. Now I got balanced onto your stupid team.

18
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:38,310
Yo, you're real, okay. Lots of people down there, holy crap. I keep getting extinguished.

19
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,550
I was so scared. I'm so scared. Is there a health pack? No, it's a defensor!

20
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,509
This is the worst thing, dude. I'm stuck up here. How? Oh, okay. I don't know what to do.

21
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,430
How dumb did I look when I just ran, sprinted and clenched at your feet on fire. It was awesome.

22
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:08,840
Oh my god, this... Look, I had no idea I was there. If I can get this to level three,

23
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:21,960
you gotta be kidding me, dude. I'm building a nest up here. This is a very dangerous thing I'm doing.

24
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:34,169
This is very dangerous. This is too dangerous. I'm getting the hell out of here. Get me the hell

25
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:43,129
out of here. Get me the hell out of here. No, damn it, you fucking little mini sentry.

26
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:50,599
Fuck yeah. There's only one medic and a pyro. He didn't get... How did he not get hit by that crit?

27
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,139
You're dead. Did you have a sandwich? Did you just fall off the edge?

28
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,020
I did have a sandwich. And I just fell off the edge. I fell off after you.

29
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,139
I was so intrigued by if you fell off or not that I jumped off the edge too.

30
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,509
Who's the only one that made it out of that alive? Wow. I see. I have to check and see if you die.

31
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:19,720
I die. I can't see his body. You were on fire and you shot a cheeseburger body and fell down the

32
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:30,339
hole. Yeah, it just flopped off the edge while I was eating my sandwich. All right. Can I be on

33
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:41,050
your team? That was a double headshot. Hey, Heavy, when you come around this corner, I'm gonna... What

34
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,379
the hell is going on? You wanna get turned into a fried egg? You wanna get turned into a fried egg?

35
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:52,970
Oh, I have my buff banner on crap. All right. Thank you, medic. Who wants to get turned into

36
00:04:52,970 --> 00:05:01,019
a friggin' fried egg? This guy right here does. Fried egg. You want a fried egg? Oh, that guy

37
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:08,089
didn't want a fried egg. Hey, you want some hash? Where are you? I can't hit this guy. Thank you.

38
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:14,329
Somebody killed him. Watch out. That's a spy. No, it's not. Just an engineer with a shotgun.

39
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:23,000
Watch out for that spy. Nope. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap.

40
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,259
Go festival, M. Quit drinking. We need to talk about that. It calms my nerves. We're gonna have

41
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:37,189
to talk about you drinking on the job every day. I've got a crown. I can do whatever I want.

42
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:46,939
Well, you could follow me. You're like, I feel like you're gonna backstab me. Egg. Oh, here we go.

43
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:58,709
Nice crits. Nice crits. Yay. Well, it looked like you weren't on my team. It looked like for a second

44
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:07,689
you weren't on my team. There is like two quick fix mechs on this team. On their team or ours?

45
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:10,649
I'm just like baiting people in here to like get killed by this entry.

46
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:19,540
No, you want to have a melee fight? Let's go. Come on, come get me. Yeah, come get me. Ow.

47
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:31,899
Oh my god, I've gotten this guy like five or six kills on this century. God. No. No. Where's the

48
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:40,500
engineer? Is he dead? Damn it. Well, that's not good. Run away. Spy is still alive, by the way.

49
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,980
Give me the health. Give me the health. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

50
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:53,910
Bad move. Bad move. Turn around. Run away. I knew it. What the fuck?
