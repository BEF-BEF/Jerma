1
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:13,060
What is going on guys, Jerma here. I'm bringing you the new Team Fortress 2

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,559
update, the Mano Technology update. Huge, huge deal guys. The Engineer, the Sniper

3
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,859
and the Spy all got new awesome items. Gonna talk about them in brief detail

4
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:27,219
right now. Gonna show you them all. It's so exciting I can hardly contain myself.

5
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:30,859
Let's start off with the Engineer. The new shotgun is the Widowmaker. On hit

6
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,299
damage dealt is returned as ammo. No reload necessary. Minus 60 ammo per shot

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,939
and it uses metal for ammo. The new pistol is the Short Circuit. On fire generates an

8
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:45,619
electrical field that destroys projectiles and does slight damage to

9
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:51,420
players. No reload necessary. No random crits. Uses metal and it takes 35 ammo.

10
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,979
Ammo is metal guys, if you're wondering that. It's the 200 ammo you

11
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,420
get. You have to use that as your actual ammo. It's a very strange mechanic but

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,780
we'll get into that later. The Sniper got a new sniper rifle, the

13
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,299
Machina on full charge. 15% more damage done per shot and if you have a full

14
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:14,959
charge it can go through people. The big downside for this weapon guys is it

15
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,040
cannot fire unless it is zoomed and it fires tracer rounds. So no more no

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,799
scoping with the sniper rifle if you're going to use this and people are all

17
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:29,159
going to know where you are because it fires the tracer rounds. On to the Spy. He

18
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,099
got a ridiculous new revolver and a new hat which is actually kind of funny. The

19
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:38,180
diamond back gives one guaranteed critical hit for each building

20
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,859
destroyed with your sapper attached. Minus 15% damage done and no random

21
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:47,040
crits. So this is kind of a reverse frontier justice for the Spy. If you

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,159
destroy, it works on many sentries as well, so if you destroy a sentry with

23
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,359
your sapper you are going to get one crit and it stacks too. So like I said

24
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,760
it's kind of like the frontier justice for the Spy. I'll show you all these

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,200
items now in detail. Me playing with them. It's super exciting. I can't wait

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,280
to show you guys these things. They're all ridiculous. Oh the heavy by the way

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,719
got a new miscellaneous item but it doesn't matter. It doesn't do anything.

28
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,960
It's just kind of there for fun. Everyone got a new hat too. New sunglasses. New

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,599
new hat and stuff like that. It's kind of it's for the Deus Ex human revolution.

30
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,159
That new game that's coming out for the new Deus Ex series. You can get all these

31
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,439
items if you pre-order Deus Ex. The new Deus Ex game or you can find them in

32
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,159
drops and they are craftable. But I went ahead and I bought Deus Ex because I

33
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,199
wanted Deus Ex anyways. So let's get into this guys. Here we're going to start

34
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,340
with the engineer and the new engineer items. Let's start by saying that this is

35
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,280
a very very odd mechanic. Take a look at my ammo count down there. It takes 60

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,479
ammo to shoot it. You do not have a clip anymore. There's no reloading. There's no

37
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:55,439
reload time or anything like that. It's just 60 metal to shoot that gun and it's

38
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:01,240
35 metal to shoot the new pistol. Very very weird mechanic because you'll find

39
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,039
that you'll have no more metal left to shoot the gun and you're kind of just

40
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,680
like oh crap now what do I do. It's gonna take a lot of getting used to but for a

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,840
combat engineer this will be a awesome new item. Especially the new shotgun

42
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,439
because how many times have you been able to not place a mini sentry down

43
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,159
when you wanted to because it didn't have enough ammo or metal. See look at

44
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:27,090
my ammo count. 113.96. You shoot you lose but you gain. It's weird. And then this

45
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,629
new item here this new pistol it electrocutes people. It's very very odd.

46
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,990
Hopefully we can figure this all out guys in the near future in the next

47
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,710
couple weeks. It works on buildings as well. So if you shoot a building I

48
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,030
believe point blank it gives you let's see here I think it's I think it's 80 to

49
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,389
85 metal per point blank shot. So I electrocute this sniper. It's kind of a

50
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:53,250
weird mechanic. It's it's like a Tesla coil kind of and it spreads too by the

51
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,729
way. So if you electrocute somebody and there's a bunch of people around it will

52
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,289
hit every single person around there. This also destroys projectiles. The new

53
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:06,330
pistol. See how I shot that building? How I did watch a see? Plus 60 plus 60. If you

54
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,770
get close enough to people it's sort of like having infinite ammo and you never

55
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,650
have to reload. But the problem here guys is you have to be a good shot. If you

56
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,889
miss all the time if you're not good with the shotgun I do not recommend you

57
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:23,329
try and get this item because you will just lose metal over and over again. So I

58
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,850
get a little assist with that thing. It's very weird. See 60 60 60 80 80. It's very

59
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,889
very cool. See look at see how this thing is spreading. The electrical charge is

60
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,209
spreading around. Maybe it's a new spy check mechanic. Maybe you can check for

61
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:40,129
spies. I'm not sure yet guys. This is the first time I've ever played with it. Just

62
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,970
want to make sure I get you guys some cool gameplay with it. You see exactly

63
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,220
how the item works. I haven't tried to destroy any projectiles with it yet with

64
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,339
the with the pistol because I hadn't I didn't really have a chance to be honest.

65
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,120
So trying to get that to work I'm assuming that it's sort of like a

66
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,279
reflect. You just click it just you just click once and that's it. Let's

67
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,839
move on to the spy. This is really really cool. You'll see here I decloak next to

68
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,120
this sentry over here. It doesn't matter. Like I said it can be a mini sentry. It

69
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,879
can be a big sentry. Backstab the engineer. Put the sapper on and look at

70
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,360
the lower right. One crit I missed but it's okay. I just wanted to show you

71
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,079
guys how it all works. I actually do something pretty cool in a minute here. I

72
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,360
get a soldier. It works on mini sentries, big sentries. Doesn't matter as long and

73
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,519
it's an assist too. It'll work on assists too. So if you assist somebody in

74
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,800
destroying a sentry by putting a sapper on it you will get the crit. It just has

75
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,649
to be on the sentry. You see this mini sentry right here. Place the sapper on.

76
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:42,170
Did I get the kill? I did but that pyro actually helped me and I get the crit

77
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:46,410
kill. That soldier hundred and two damage. It is insane guys. I can see so many

78
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,649
people using this over the ambassador. I'm going to use this over the

79
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,089
ambassador now because it stacks. If you're a good spy you can potentially

80
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:58,410
hold three or four crits in this thing if you kill a couple mini sentries. On to

81
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,689
the sniper now. As you saw just headshot of that heavy and you saw the tracer

82
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:08,209
rounds. It's a direct line coming out of your sniper rifle right to where you are.

83
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:12,300
As you can see, see how it's still there after I shot the demoman. It lasts for

84
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,019
about one or two seconds. Not really that big of a deal but it kind of can be when

85
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:19,139
you're trying to be sneaky and trying to hide. People are going to see it. It's a

86
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,540
red flag. See right there? People know exactly where I am. Get a couple

87
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,660
headshots but the big deal about this sniper rifle guys is the fact that if

88
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:34,459
you make the charge go up to 100% it will do 15% more damage and it will go

89
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,939
through people. Now I don't really get to utilize it. I don't really get to show

90
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,579
you it going through people but you'll see how much damage it does with a full

91
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:47,819
charge shot. I believe it's 518 damage for a full charge headshot which is

92
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:52,779
insane but you got to remember guys a fully overhealed heavy is only 450

93
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,819
health. So this weapon if you fully charge and shoot somebody in the face

94
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,819
you're gonna be doing way too much damage. Way more damage than you ever

95
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:04,699
needed to do in the first place. Where this weapon is going to shine is if a

96
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:09,500
line of people are in a corridor and you body shot somebody and it goes through

97
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,540
four people. Another downside of this weapon though guys is you cannot no

98
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,620
scope. No scoping is disabled. If you try to do it it just makes a clicking

99
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,480
sound. So this weapon is really catering to bringing back the SMG. That's in my

100
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,060
opinion because you have no other option. You have to be zoomed in when you shoot.

101
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,060
So I think that this paired up with the SMG would be a very very good

102
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,620
combination. We'll see how things play out in the next couple weeks. If they

103
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,089
nerf, if they buff some of these items I have no idea. We will find out. But guys

104
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:43,810
thank you so much for watching. That's pretty much all I got. I wanted to really

105
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,569
rush this out and give you guys a really really good look at all the new items.

106
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:51,209
Hopefully you guys got a little bit information from it. I did from doing it.

107
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:58,209
So take care everybody and have fun with the new update guys. See you later.
