00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,390
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,890
Gonna be playing as the sniper tonight with the Bizarre Bargain, which I don't know why I used this thing.

3
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,890
To be totally honest, I should not be equipping this thing at all. I just like the way it looks and I like the way it sounds.

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:32,390
So, regardless of all of that, I'm using the Bizarre Bargain, the Razorback, and the default Kukri.

5
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:38,390
And the reason why I have the Razorback on is I know that the Razorback is not the best option.

6
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,390
I know that you should just put on the Jurati or put on the Danger Shield. I usually have the Danger Shield on.

7
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:50,390
But I have this on because for some reason, when you put this on, this is just like going under the covers when you were 5 years old.

8
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,390
Ducking your head under the covers and sleeping that way to protect yourself from monsters.

9
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:01,130
Now, as we all know, if a monster did come into the room, he would rip the covers off and just kill you.

10
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,629
And that's kind of the same theory with the Razorback. It just makes me feel more comfortable.

11
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:11,430
It makes me feel like I'm protected when I'm really not. But that's why I have it on.

12
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,430
This is also on King of the Hill Lakeside, which is one of the best sniper maps in the game.

13
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,430
Because it really is just built for snipers. There's a little roost over here.

14
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,930
There's a spot over on the left that has a wall to protect you.

15
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:30,430
There's a spot down below. There's plenty of spots for snipers and that's why everybody plays sniper on this map.

16
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:36,430
This is a great sniper. This is a great spy map, which is the reason why it can get sort of crazy on this map.

17
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:43,430
If you hold down tab and look at the scoreboard and you go, why are there seven snipers on this game right now?

18
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,430
Well, that's the reason, because it's a map that's catered to snipers, I guess.

19
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,989
So what I want to talk about in this gameplay, I want to talk about something very, very, very important.

20
00:01:53,989 --> 00:02:01,790
It's about live streaming. I just got the ability to live stream on YouTube through Machinima.

21
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,789
I have a Machinima contract that lets me do it now. And I want to start to transition from Twitch over to YouTube.

22
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:14,789
Now, I'm not just going to stop doing my Twitch TV stuff. I'm not going to turn that off and be like, okay, that's it.

23
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:17,789
No more Saturday, six o'clock streams. No, that's still going to be there.

24
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:22,789
Every Saturday at six p.m. Eastern Standard Time, I'm going to live stream on Twitch.

25
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:28,400
Regardless of all of this new YouTube live streaming stuff. So don't be worried about that at all.

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
That's going to keep going. I'm going to keep that going for a long time.

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,639
I just wanted to give you guys a heads up that I'm going to start doing random YouTube streams to try and get the feel for it.

28
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,639
Try to get into the YouTube scene for streaming, because I don't want anyone to be taken off guard by this.

29
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:51,639
I don't want someone to see in their feed that I'm streaming on YouTube and have them be like, what is going on right now?

30
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,939
What? So look out for that in the next couple of weeks. I'm not going to do it so soon.

31
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,439
I want to make sure I do it right when I do it. So be on the lookout for that.

32
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,439
So now I have a question for you guys. Has to do with Team Fortress 2, has to do with snipers.

33
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:15,439
So it's in a perfect video, right? So the question is, what is your favorite sniper rifle and where is your favorite spot on any map?

34
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,439
Because I'm trying to find some new places to snipe, not just on Lakeside.

35
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,439
I'm talking Gold Rush. I'm talking Badwater. I'm talking everything in general.

36
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,620
So I'll give you an example. I'll start off. Ready? My favorite sniper rifle is the Bizarre Bargain.

37
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:36,050
I don't know why. It just is. And my favorite sniping map slash spot is Badwater.

38
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:41,050
And it's that spot right when people come around that corner for the first card when you're on defense.

39
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:47,050
So if I'm on defense and I'm a sniper, the spot where right where people come around that first corner there on offense.

40
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:54,050
I love that spot. Just shooting down that tunnel. You get so many kills because so many people are stuffed in that one little area.

41
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:59,289
So that's what I mean for an example because I'm trying to find some new spots and trying to find some new fun ways to play sniper.

42
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:03,719
So let's start talking about the gameplay right now. Nice headshot on that spy coming out here.

43
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,719
I don't know why I decided to do this. This is not really advisable. I don't get myself killed or anything.

44
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:16,720
But I don't know why I decided to come all the way over to the point. I told myself I wanted to get a better view, a better look.

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,720
I wanted to be able to shoot downward at people. But this is not really recommended at all.

46
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,149
Trying to get the shot on that medic with the crossbow because he is aiming for me and I am scared.

47
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:33,149
And now the soldier medic pair comes up here. I smarten up now. I turn around, go back to my roost.

48
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:37,149
Not going to screw around anymore. Let's end this the right way, right?

49
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:43,149
But now I see there's a sniper in the way so I decide I'm not going to stand here. Two snipers in the same spot. That is not a good idea.

50
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,389
So I make my way up here. I'm going to go, whoa, wait a minute, four people on the point right now.

51
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:52,389
I just barely caught myself. I would have been killed instantly if I had walked up there.

52
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,569
So I come through the left pool room, as a friend of mine likes to call it.

53
00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:00,740
Just trying to kitty corner myself so I can aim through that hole there.

54
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,920
Doesn't really work out so well so I end up turning around going towards their spawn area.

55
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,920
And I hang back here. I get a spy. Spy comes after me. I club him in the face.

56
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,920
And then I get a nice headshot on this sniper coming up here.

57
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,920
And that's going to be all she wrote. We win the game, guys.

58
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,100
Thank you so much for watching, everybody. I really do appreciate it.

59
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,100
And be on the lookout for my YouTube live streams. I have no idea when they're going to start.

60
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,339
But they're going to start soon. So I will see you guys all next time.

61
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:31,339
Take care, everybody.
