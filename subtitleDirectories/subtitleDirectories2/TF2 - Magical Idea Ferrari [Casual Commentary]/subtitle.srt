1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:17,899
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Sniper.

2
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:23,899
How long has it been since I've known in a post commentary what class I was playing on in Team Fortress 2?

3
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:29,899
It's been probably like at least like nine weeks or like a couple of months at least since I've known that.

4
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:33,899
But whatever, we're gonna talk about something today. It's not really gonna have to do with the gameplay.

5
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:41,899
It's gonna talk about what I really want to do in the next 10 years or so. That's the tentative plan.

6
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:46,579
And I'm just gonna get out and say it. We're gonna start talking about it. I want to make my own game.

7
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:54,579
I feel like a lot of gamers have this sort of fantasy and this passion for gaming where they say to themselves on a pretty regular basis,

8
00:00:54,579 --> 00:01:01,579
man, what would it be like if I were to make my own video game? What would it be like if I were to have my own thing or my own product that I could call my own?

9
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:05,579
What would it be? What kind of game would it be? Would it be an RPG? Would it be action?

10
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:17,140
But my reasoning for wanting to make my own game doesn't even really stem from the creative process, from the character creation and the world design, the level design.

11
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:25,140
My passion lies in the customer service and the customer satisfaction slash business area of video games.

12
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,769
Because when I play a game, I like to feel like I'm being treated fairly by the game company.

13
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:36,769
I like to be treated as though they care, as though we do matter as customers.

14
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:43,010
I don't like to be treated as though I'm just a number in a book for the bookkeeper to walk down,

15
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:48,010
I'm the bookkeeper and like have a giant textbook on his side and it's got like a bunch of dusty notes.

16
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,010
And he's like, yes, master, here's your book.

17
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,010
He drops it down and they go over it and how much money is inside of it.

18
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,180
No, I want to have a company and more so to make a video game.

19
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:06,219
I want to make a game company that strives for customer service because I feel like I really feel like guys,

20
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:12,900
that there are a lot of game companies out there that really just don't give a shit and they'll punch out anything.

21
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:20,900
They'll put out anything with their name on it or with underdeveloped bullshit in it just to make a few bucks off of you guys.

22
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,379
And I don't like that. And it's not everybody.

23
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,379
There are plenty of companies that strive for excellence and I applaud them.

24
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,680
The whole industry suck.

25
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,680
No, there's plenty of people that strive every day to make quality products and those people deserve a pat on the back.

26
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,680
And some of the people that work for some of these quote bad game companies that try as hard as they can and they work with what they got.

27
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
They deserve a pat on the back too.

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,479
And I think it's maybe because I'm getting older and I'm seeing the things that I want to change.

29
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,479
I'm seeing things that I would like to do differently.

30
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,780
But you always hit the wall.

31
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,780
You always you get in the car.

32
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,780
This is what my analogy here is going to explain how I feel about this.

33
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,219
Anytime you have an idea or something interesting or something crazy or something new you want to try to do.

34
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,219
It's like getting in a car.

35
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:18,219
You're getting a new Ferrari and you're like, oh, yeah, like you turn it on the gas and it's like, oh, holy shit, that's a pretty good gas.

36
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:27,520
And then you put it in drive and you start driving and you get to the there's a cliff and the cliff says the big idea.

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,520
And it's a huge rainbow and it's a giant like unicorns flying all over the place.

38
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,520
And your car starts to have wings come out and you're like, oh, my God, the car has wings.

39
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
They start coming out.

40
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,520
And then the second the wings start coming out, you get kind of scared and you're like, no, no, hold on.

41
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
I'll push the brake on a little.

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
I want to go a little slower.

43
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
And you know what?

44
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
I'm kind of tired.

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,520
I don't really want to go into the big beyond right there.

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Yeah.

47
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Let me just turn around.

48
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,520
And you turn the car around.

49
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
You know, you slow down.

50
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:05,759
You go back to your house and then your Ferrari sits in the garage for the next 10 years and it's got dust all over it.

51
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,759
You walk out.

52
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,759
You have like a briefcase.

53
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,759
You go into work or something.

54
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,759
You look over and you see this.

55
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,759
Yeah, I'm going to write my name in the giant dust that's on my Ferrari.

56
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,000
That's what it feels like.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,240
You can never like pull the trigger on ideas like this.

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,240
You can never go all the way with ideas like this.

59
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,240
You just kind of end up getting a taste for it and feeling for it.

60
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,740
And then you stop and you don't ever think about it again.

61
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,980
And if you do think about it again, you never want to get back in the Ferrari.

62
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,149
You just kind of want to watch the Ferrari and make sure nothing happens to the Ferrari.

63
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:40,149
You protect the Ferrari, but you never want to use it.

64
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:42,149
You just want to keep it safe.

65
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:47,149
You want to keep that Ferrari safe in your garage rather than actually do anything with it.

66
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:53,329
And anytime anybody asks you about that Ferrari, hey, didn't you like drive a Ferrari?

67
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:56,500
And you just go, I mean, yeah, I did.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
But I mean, it's all fucked up.

69
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,500
It needs a new calibration device inside of it.

70
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
It needs a couple of wheels.

71
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
You know, it needs some work.

72
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,810
And you'll get answered by a nod and like a wave or like, oh, yeah, that's cool.

73
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,810
Whatever.

74
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,810
Nobody ever pushes you to fix that Ferrari.

75
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:19,560
Your dreams and your thoughts and your realities are really yours.

76
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,439
And if anyone wants to try to push you to try to make them happen, make them a reality, it's got to be you.

77
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,439
It's got to be you or somebody really close to you that can help you do it.

78
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,740
And that's the wall.

79
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,740
That's the giant wall that we all hit.

80
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,920
And me talking about making like a game company, it's always on my mind.

81
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,920
But it's just I haven't dusted off the Ferrari in years.

82
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:51,920
And eventually here, I want to get that thing down to the super China, get it nice and cleaned up, get all the fixes that need to be done on this Ferrari.

83
00:05:51,920 --> 00:06:03,589
And just this time when I come to the cliff, push it and actually have the wings come out and take off and soar into the air and then land on the other side and make the German game company.

84
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:07,769
Although I don't know how long that would take, but you guys get the idea.

85
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:09,769
That's going to wrap up this video, guys.

86
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,769
Thank you all so much for watching.

87
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:11,769
I really do appreciate it.

88
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,769
And keep your dreams going.

89
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:18,769
If you have your own Ferraris, if you have your own nice cars, dust them off.

90
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:21,939
Take a look at it and just try to see what you can do.

91
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,250
Okay.

92
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,250
See you guys the next time.

93
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,250
Take care, everybody.

94
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,250
And good night.
