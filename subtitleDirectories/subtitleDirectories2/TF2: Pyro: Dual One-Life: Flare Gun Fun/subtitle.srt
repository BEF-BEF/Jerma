00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,099
Hey, what is happening everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:18,699
Gonna be playing as the Pyro tonight. Two one-life gameplays back-to-back as the Pyro,

3
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:25,500
using the strange degreaser, the strange flare gun, and because I never use melee as a Pyro,

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,000
I have on the stupid guitar thing. The third degree, that's what it's called. So these

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,280
are two back-to-back one-life gameplays, like I said, on Hightower. And Hightower is one of

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,399
those awesome Pyro maps because you can really just hide around corners, jump at people, blast

7
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,520
people off the edge of the cliff. So it's a whole lot of fun. I suggest you try Pyro on here if

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,979
you've never done it before. So what I want to talk about in this gameplay, I want to talk about

9
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:56,600
the flare gun because I want to give you guys some tips and strategies on how I use this thing,

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,460
how I get most of my kills with this thing, and just general basic strategy and tips for you guys

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,700
because some people have a lot of trouble with this item. And I did a video about the flare gun

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,980
a while back, probably like three months ago, and I didn't really go into that much detail. I talked

13
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,099
about it for a little bit, but I want to give at least a minute or two of this video's time to

14
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:22,010
explaining how I use this item. Now let me back up for just a second. I want to show you what I'm

15
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:27,530
talking about as I'm talking about it. So your compression blast shoots people up in a straight

16
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,010
line. They go up in a straight line and they come down in a straight line. There's no running,

17
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,209
there's no moving all over the place. They just go up and come down. So it's really easy to get

18
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:41,609
the timing down. And some people will ask me, they'll say, Jerma, if you're going to do the

19
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:46,170
compression blast in the air, why not use the reserve shooter or why not use the shotgun?

20
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,170
Which they're both really, really good options. They're awesome options. The reason why I don't

21
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,730
use them anymore is because the flare gun does 90 damage when you crit somebody. And you're going

22
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,810
to crit them if you do this technique. You light them on fire, blast them in the air, and they're

23
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:04,329
also going to take afterburn damage as well. So it would take two or three shotgun shots to get the

24
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:09,210
same amount of damage you'll get with these crits. And I know it does take only about one and a half

25
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,490
seconds to shoot your shotgun twice or three times even. And it does take about two and a half seconds

26
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,810
to shoot the flare gun, but it really does even out. They both equal about the same amount of

27
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,050
damage if you have good aim. So it really is just personal preference finding what you want to play

28
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,610
with. I just like the flare gun because I love getting those crits and I like having the long

29
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:33,020
range option. Getting one more look at what I'm talking about right there and then I get myself

30
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,780
killed. I don't know what it is about engineer buildings, but look it, I'm just standing still

31
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,939
right now aiming at it. I think it just puts you in a trance whenever you see an engineer building.

32
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:45,340
You're like, I gotta get rid of that damn thing. But anyways, this is the second gameplay. This is

33
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,750
the second one life gameplay. Had to spray that picture of Burger Boy right there because

34
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,669
everybody loves Burger Boy. So coming up right here, this is really, really ridiculous. I couldn't

35
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:00,469
believe I survived this whole thing. MLC Stealth is my medic right now. He gets himself killed.

36
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:05,349
Actually, I probably get him killed for going too overzealous right here. I get the reflect shot

37
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,629
on this demo man, get the kill on him, turn around, Stealth is being attacked, Stealth goes down as

38
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:14,949
the medic. And then it's just me and this guy in this room being ridiculous. And then another pyro

39
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:19,830
comes in here and I'm just like, Oh my God, swinging all over the place. And I actually get

40
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,349
the kill on both of them and look at how much health I have. And to be honest with you guys,

41
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:29,909
if I had the shotgun right there, I probably wouldn't have even pulled it out. Only because

42
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:35,110
when you get closed off in an area with another pyro and you're a pyro, you pretty much just chaos

43
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,310
spray and get all crazy. There was three pyros in that room. So there's really all you can do is just

44
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,949
spray and pray and hope you get the kill on somebody. That's really all you can do. I mean,

45
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:48,870
maybe I could have done one or two meat shots, but it was just so chaotic in that tiny little

46
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,060
room. I really don't think I would have pulled it off. So coming up, this is the best and worst

47
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,300
part of Hightower. If you're on the receiving end, it's the worst. If you're on the delivering end,

48
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,860
it's the funniest best thing in the world. Blowing people off of the edge right there at that cart

49
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,139
turnaround. Speaking of the cart, this is when we all get on it. We all start to push it because

50
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:13,259
really it's just been sitting here the whole time, not really moving that much. You get a lucky crit

51
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,259
shot on that scout that was jumping over the edge there, and this needs to be said, I'll bring it

52
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:23,500
up again, the afterburn kills him. So if you crit any of the classes with 150 health or less,

53
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:29,019
you will kill them with the afterburn. The only way that won't happen is if there's a medic on the

54
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:33,980
team healing people, overhealing people, et cetera, or they pick up a health kit. That's the only way

55
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,500
they will escape that. Moving the cart right along here, this is the part on Hightower where

56
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,899
pretty much every single game ends in a stalemate, because they both get to this point right here

57
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:49,339
where this large hill is, and neither team ever seems to be able to push it all the way up.

58
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:53,660
Especially if there are engineers here, because even if you take it out with an uber charge,

59
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:00,060
you still have to push the cart all the way up, and literally the spawn doors are right there.

60
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,290
So it can be quite a challenge sometimes. Sentry gun up in that little loft right there,

61
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,769
I end up taking it out with the flare gun. There was a bunch of spam going at that thing,

62
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:14,649
so I think I just luckily got the last shot on it. Then Stealth does an uber charge right here,

63
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,970
and he gives it to the soldier, then he gives it to me, and was not really expecting that,

64
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:25,300
but I think he was practicing his transition uber. So this is going to be the end of the

65
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,180
gameplay right here. I get on the cart going upwards, and instead of just jumping around

66
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,939
and trying to get rid of this sniper that's aiming at me, I really didn't even know he was aiming at

67
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:39,139
me to begin with, but I get myself shot right in the face, and the cart goes all the way down.

68
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,269
We could have won, but whatever. You take and you give, right?

69
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:46,149
So thank you guys so much for watching, I really do appreciate it,

70
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:50,470
and I will see you guys all soon. Take care, everybody.
