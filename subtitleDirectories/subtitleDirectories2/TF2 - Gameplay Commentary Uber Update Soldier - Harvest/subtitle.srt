1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,299
What's going on guys? It's Germo once again with a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:10,539
This time I am on King of the Hill Harvest with the Uber Update Soldier.

3
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:14,859
I know in a previous video I said that I could not use the Uber Update Soldier.

4
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,739
I didn't like the rocket launcher. I didn't like the three rockets.

5
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:20,699
But I have had a change of heart because I started playing with it.

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,379
I said I'm going to give it another chance.

7
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,460
And I absolutely wreck complete house in this gameplay.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,660
Unfortunately we lose both of the games you're going to see.

9
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:35,179
But I was very proud of how I was absolutely destroying people with this setup I got here.

10
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:38,060
The shotgun, I love the shotgun. I didn't like it at first.

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,380
But it reminds me of the Frontier Justice.

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,219
I like having the three shots to be honest.

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,619
Like I said, it reminds me of the Frontier Justice.

14
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:46,460
And I'm really good with the Frontier Justice.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,140
Especially when you get those crits.

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,219
It's like a Frankenstein Frontier Justice in my opinion.

17
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,979
This is funny. I get this sniper off guard.

18
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:55,990
And I get him with the da whip.

19
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,030
A lucky crit right there.

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,789
But he probably still would have died.

21
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:01,700
And also to talk about the whip for a second.

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,219
Is anybody else having hit detection problems with this thing?

23
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:07,219
I was really gung-ho about using this.

24
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:08,579
And I really was excited for it.

25
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:10,420
And I was looking forward to it.

26
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,019
And it seems like 40% of the time you hit somebody with the whip.

27
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:14,739
Nothing happens.

28
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,939
I feel like it's happened so many times where I've hit somebody.

29
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,459
And it's just like, nope, sorry, nothing happened.

30
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:23,620
You didn't hit him apparently.

31
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,500
I don't know.

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,900
It might just be lag compensation or something like that.

33
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,379
Hopefully there's a fix for that.

34
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:31,780
Because it's kind of annoying.

35
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,549
Because I feel like now after using it for a while.

36
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:39,269
It's only use is to run out of the spawn when a round starts really fast.

37
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:41,030
I feel like that's the only use it has now.

38
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,670
This is pretty cool.

39
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,950
I jump over here.

40
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,909
Kill this Demoman.

41
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:44,709
I did it!

42
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:45,209
No!

43
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:47,140
I didn't.

44
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,469
But honestly though.

45
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:55,189
I know people are going to be giving me examples of how the whip is useful.

46
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:56,469
And where you should use it.

47
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,790
I don't know.

48
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,829
I just switch in between too many weapons every three seconds.

49
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:00,790
Like, oh, I've got to whip this guy.

50
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,510
Then grab my shotgun.

51
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,150
Then whip this guy.

52
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,709
And then run over here.

53
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:03,510
And then whip that guy too.

54
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,709
And I've got to whip him too.

55
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:05,590
By the way, this is great.

56
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,909
This shows my expertise in Team Fortress.

57
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:08,150
Ready?

58
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,110
Watch this.

59
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,490
We get the cap.

60
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,810
And then here comes the brigade of people.

61
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,810
You would expect that we were going to win this, right?

62
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,610
You would think that we were going to win this with only like 15 seconds left.

63
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,129
And like 12 people here.

64
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:20,569
Murder that Demoman.

65
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,050
Murder that soldier with a crit because he jumped in the air.

66
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,629
This thing is cool.

67
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:25,590
Pyro comes over.

68
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,789
He gets destroyed.

69
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:28,310
Shot with a shotgun three times.

70
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,780
He's dead.

71
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,460
In comes, I believe, a spy.

72
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,479
Yep, spy, dead.

73
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,240
I kill like seven or eight people here.

74
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,680
Oh, you're dead too, spy.

75
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,909
And look.

76
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,349
Look who comes to ruin the fun.

77
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,150
An ubered friggin' heavy.

78
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,990
And that's why we lost the match.

79
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,259
I was going to just toss this gameplay out the window.

80
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:52,889
But I figured that because this is only like three minutes long at this point.

81
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,409
That I'd use another one.

82
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:55,610
And here's another full gameplay.

83
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,090
And I do very, very well in this one too.

84
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,090
But we still seem to lose.

85
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,289
But it's fun, I guess, to see me kill people and, you know, wreck house.

86
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:04,169
So that'll be cool.

87
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:10,169
So when this next match starts, you're going to get to see an example of what I'm talking about with the whip.

88
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:14,330
There are so many people in spawn right now that it's actually useful to hit people.

89
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,569
Because there are people walking in front of you.

90
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,250
This medic is kind of right in front of me.

91
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,289
I can get him.

92
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:21,050
And it works out very, very well.

93
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,810
The only problem now is when I die and I have to spawn again.

94
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,729
See, I die from this scout that's right here.

95
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,169
He hits me with the soda popper.

96
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,080
And the problem now is when I spawn, there's nobody that's going to be around to whip.

97
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,520
Which is the whole point of the weapon.

98
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,319
You need somebody to be right next to you to be able to hit them.

99
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,139
And with the hit detection being so odd that I can't even figure it out.

100
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,340
See, watch, you'll see what I'm talking about.

101
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,780
Here's the hit detection problem.

102
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,229
See, ready?

103
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,430
I didn't hit him, apparently.

104
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,310
I hit that, I actually hit the sniper is who I actually came in contact with.

105
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,509
So when I first hit that medic and it made the noise and I didn't move.

106
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:58,949
That happens all the time.

107
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,750
And maybe I was a little bit too far away for that example.

108
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,870
But it still made the noise.

109
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,310
I mean, why would it make the noise if it wasn't going to be contact?

110
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,189
You know what I mean?

111
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:09,349
And plus there are much worse occasions where that happens.

112
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,349
When I would hit somebody right in their face.

113
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,669
Like directly right into their face or in their back and I don't move at all.

114
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:18,870
So if I'm missing some part of the mechanic of this item.

115
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,829
Somebody please let me know if I'm just being an idiot.

116
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,750
And it's like, oh, you have to be running straight.

117
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,430
You can't, I don't know.

118
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,269
So me and this medic both get on the point.

119
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:28,310
We cap it.

120
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,230
I'll stop talking about the whip now and I'll start talking about the gameplay.

121
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,990
That was a nice backstab from that spy.

122
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,110
He really did save my life.

123
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,470
Heavy medic pair comes around the corner and they don't go for the point.

124
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,910
So I think maybe I can come over here and do something about it.

125
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,670
But this soldier ends up killing me anyways.

126
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,790
I do a quick little check.

127
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,029
I hit tab and I realized I was recording with fraps.

128
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:49,930
So I was like, oh, shit, no, I can't do that.

129
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,050
Because normally I record with the demo feature and then watch it.

130
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,569
And then I'll export it.

131
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,730
But I normally don't record with fraps.

132
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:03,529
But now that I've started doing that, I'm so compulsive when it comes to looking at my scores.

133
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:04,649
Like, oh, did I get an assist?

134
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,170
Oh, how many points did I get?

135
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,250
Nice little turnaround shot, by the way, on that soldier.

136
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,329
I get a good three or four kill streak here in a row.

137
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,170
And I'm going to have to learn how to not do that.

138
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,209
I'm going to have to really, really try hard to not hold down tab every five seconds.

139
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:20,170
It was very difficult.

140
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,170
So I smash this medic with a crit, come out here, and then watch this lag.

141
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,529
This ruined everything.

142
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:27,449
See, oh, you see that little glitch right there?

143
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:28,970
That was a bunch of BS.

144
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,569
Because I probably would have killed that heavy.

145
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,500
I was on a roll right there.

146
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,259
So I was very disappointed about that.

147
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,420
And they end up getting back on the point.

148
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,420
And I really wanted to win this because I hate doing gameplays where you lose.

149
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,300
Because it's kind of like, well, you did good and you were contributing to the team.

150
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,379
But you guys still lost.

151
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,420
I want to see you win.

152
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,060
And then I say, OK, well, I'm trying.

153
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,740
I'm trying as hard as I can, guys.

154
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,939
So don't ask me what that Pyro was doing.

155
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,860
Our Pyro was just behind him spraying him.

156
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,740
And he was just so deliberate on killing that sniper.

157
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,939
But he just couldn't do it.

158
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,300
So I come out here, get this scout, dominate him, dominate the Pyro before him.

159
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,180
And guess what?

160
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:11,449
Yep, dominate that spy, too.

161
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:13,290
So that's three dominations in a row.

162
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,290
So I feel like I'm doing OK now.

163
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,250
I'm having a good time.

164
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:20,889
But it's short-lived because now is where I start to fall apart.

165
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,250
And the team starts to fall apart.

166
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:27,610
And now that I have a second, you can watch me be a moron for two or three lives in a row.

167
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,329
I get a few kills.

168
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:31,689
It's not terrible, but not like what you've been seeing so far.

169
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:37,449
So now that there's a second, if you haven't done the Terraria contest yet,

170
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,250
I'm giving away three copies of Terraria.

171
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,410
If you haven't seen the video, go watch it.

172
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,290
It's the last video.

173
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,649
I'll put a link to it in this video.

174
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:46,410
But it's the last video I uploaded before this.

175
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,290
If you haven't done it, there's really good odds right now, man.

176
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,329
There's only three or four Minecraft videos.

177
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,769
So I highly recommend you go check it out and try and make something.

178
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:58,170
All the submissions so far, the Team Fortress 2 ones,

179
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,490
the comments and the Minecraft video ones,

180
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,290
they are off the wall.

181
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,730
Some of them are hysterical.

182
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,250
It's going to be so hard to pick between all these great submissions.

183
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,810
But I plan on sitting on Monday night for like three hours,

184
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,610
just deliberating with myself to figure out what I'm going to pick.

185
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:22,089
And by the way, some of you guys are insane with the comment section of the contest.

186
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:25,209
It's a riot, some of the things you guys are writing.

187
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:27,850
And it's going to be so difficult to pick one.

188
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,889
But I got to pick one.

189
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:29,930
And it's this Tuesday.

190
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,050
So go get your submission.

191
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,769
And if you haven't done it, don't wait till the last minute.

192
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:35,050
It's a good teacher.

193
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,259
I'm Mr. Germa, your math teacher.

194
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,579
Your submission, if it's late, you're going to get an F.

195
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,540
But anyways, back to the gameplay.

196
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,939
In overtime, we capped the point, which is great because I was so happy.

197
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:50,019
I thought that, okay, let's hold this.

198
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:52,819
And maybe it won't be a complete failure.

199
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:55,620
And we do hold it for a wicked, wicked long time.

200
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,259
It's a great, great little set we do here.

201
00:07:58,819 --> 00:07:59,860
This heavy gets over here.

202
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,060
I'm thinking, okay, heavy's here.

203
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,860
I'm here.

204
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,899
We're going to be able to do this.

205
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,269
And then there's a sentry.

206
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:11,959
And that person is using the strategy that I talked about in the King of the Hill Lakeside video I did.

207
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:19,290
So very, very nice job doing the big sentry on a King of the Hill map and making me walk into it.

208
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,050
So we still have control of this point.

209
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,250
And right now I'm freaking out.

210
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:30,329
I'm trying to get up there really, really fast because I was hoping that this could be a gameplay I could talk about where it's like, look, we come from behind and we win.

211
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:32,649
So I am not playing games here right now.

212
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,009
I really want to win this.

213
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,769
This heavy medic pair comes around the corner and their push is unsuccessful.

214
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:42,580
He actually gets killed by the sentry, I believe, the mini sentry that was in here.

215
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,179
So I'm trying to get a few rockets over to this side to kill that sentry.

216
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,139
Demoman comes in.

217
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:48,580
I ruin his day.

218
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,980
And now I get two rockets.

219
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:53,539
One, two, and I get the sentry down.

220
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:57,940
And now, at this point, I am saying to myself, we're going to win this.

221
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,059
There's a mini sentry in here.

222
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,179
We got a medic.

223
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:01,299
This is fantastic.

224
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:03,620
I was so skittish and edgy right now.

225
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,899
Get this engineer.

226
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:05,779
I was so happy.

227
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:06,500
I was like, this is it.

228
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,220
We're going to win.

229
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,509
They don't got, they got nothing right now.

230
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:12,460
And look at what happens again.

231
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,899
The same heavy medic pair from last round that screwed everything over once again.

232
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:21,750
They screw it over again and we lose.

233
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,309
My head was down in the, like my chin was down into my chest.

234
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:28,549
And I was really, really sad about that.

235
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:34,899
So thank you for watching this depressing gameplay commentary on King of the Hill Harvest.

236
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,309
And hopefully, hold on a second.

237
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:39,110
Oh, okay.

238
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,070
I'm okay.

239
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,750
Hopefully you enter the contest and I look forward to your submissions

240
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,269
and I look forward to more and more crazy comments.

241
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:48,629
Keep it coming, guys.

242
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,389
And I'll see you guys next time.
