I'm just going to sit over here on the team that's missing two people and wonder where my friends are. He's very dead. He's very dead. And this is this is stars. Sentry is in here. So we need to be very careful about this. All right. So we need to. Got it. You guys are having some fun over there.

You made the mistake to not be on the friend team, didn't you? Look at this guy.

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:59,580
This guy's fucking AFK. I got to kill him before I got to get him. I got to kill him. We have seven engineers. Hey, look at that. All right. I got. Oh, I got bullet resistance. Let's go take out this gun. Top. It's over on the left side. Left side. You're going to have to walk over this little incline. Oh, I see. I'm using it. I can't. I have no idea what's going on. I can't see anything. I think I'm shooting in the right direction. I have crits now too. Shit. Where? I can't see anything. Move up more. What are you doing? Dude, there was something.

6
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:33,300
Look at this. Oh, my God. Even in the right corner behind the one. You got to go. All right. Fine, dude. There was so much blood in my face. I couldn't see anything. I was taking so many hits from every direction that I couldn't see because there's too much blood splattered over here on the friend team. There's one top right. There's one over the left incline. And then next to top right, there's the little alleyway and there's like

7
00:03:33,300 --> 00:04:05,120
three century nests in this little alley. All right. Where are the three? There are three following the track. All right, there's one. I'm using. Get that. There's two. Oh, nice. Left, left, left, left. Oh, my God. I'm stuck in here. I'm stuck over here. All right. Okay. I don't even know if this is possible. I'm so like. Where are you? I'm in this right little room. I'm so stuck.

8
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:20,529
There's two sentries looking at me. This thing is so spread out. Do you see where I am? Can you spectate me? I can't see you. If I just go over here. Oh, my God. Okay. Seriously, there is a sentry gun every 15 feet.

9
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:39,540
They are spread out far enough where it's not possible for us to kill them. Are you just arrowing me? Yeah. You, you, you. 600 health points worth of arrows. Help me. Help me. Shut up. Help me. Friend team.

10
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:46,579
I'm standing behind you. Not on friend team. You kidding me right now? I don't know what class you are. We're going to die. I just told you I was a spy.

11
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,899
I'm dead behind you. I'm dead behind you. Who helped me? Who helped me? Who was there? Watch this. I got it. You want to see who's going to help you?

12
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,920
Hold on. Give me a second.

00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,519

Pyro behind us. He was in this doorway. He's he's he's coming out. Oh, my God. Spy behind you. Jerma, can you take care of these spies?

15
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,509
I can't be a counter spy. Me and Mila are working together and you aren't. Hey, who's got a c-note?

16
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,870
Huh? That's what I thought.

17
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:27,939
Where uh, where are you guys? We're on the tracks. We're on the same team and now you guys are complaining about star being not in the friend zone.

18
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,420
Hey, shut up Mila. I mean. Heal me. Jerma.

19
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,180
Heal me.

20
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,300
I'm healing you. Yeah, I need to be included too. You can't just not include somebody on friend team. I don't know what class you were.

21
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:43,379
I'm I'm a demo. They keep changing.

22
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:45,779
But they're like we have them in the spawn.

23

No one could stop the guy floating in the sky. Thanks a lot you fucking dickholes.

26
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,639
I missed him like four times.

27
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,759
That guy was so easy to hit and I missed him over and over again.

28
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:25,470

You're like 50 health now,

52
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:33,769
because you've been fucking around this whole time.

53
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,549
We're gonna get one medic now, maybe.

54
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,529
Get that spy.

55
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
Like it was a really good time to use it

56
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,120
until you did that joke.

57
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,289
Dude, we already did this joke.

58
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:51,129
Yeah, I know.

59
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:56,090
This is like 50 videos ago.

60
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,419
Are you using the fucking stickies in a pub, too?

61
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:01,940
Like I'm surrounded by morons.

62
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,740
I'm using a regular sticky launcher.

63
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,820
I'm not using the quickie launcher.

64
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,419
Oh, so like the completely broken thing

65
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:09,259
that does 100 damage per shot.

66
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,019
Hold on a second, so I am not allowed

67
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:12,740
to use the sticky bomb launcher,

68
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,620
because you said it was too strong.

69
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,460
No, because you, oh fuck.

70
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,299
It's actually broken now.

71
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:19,779
I hate the try hard, oh try hard, broken weapon,

72
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:22,419
try hard cheater, practically glitch, glitch abuser.

73
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:23,460
Glitchers. Exploit, exploit.

74
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,860
Hey, how about you suck a fart out of my ass?
