00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:21,059
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Demoman with the half demo night set up with the shield, the surf, and the turf.

2
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,239
And this is gonna be a very casual commentary, just gonna bring up a couple of topics like, you know, I do sometimes.

3
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:32,240
And first of all, there's a baby down the hall. My sister and her husband are here for the holiday, so I can't really scream in this video.

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:39,240
As much as I want to, you know, I'm in a real screaming mood right now, but I can't do it because there's a baby down the hall, and if I wake it up, then I'm in big trouble.

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:48,990
Anyways, the first thing I'm gonna go over, the first thing I'm gonna talk about is the supercomputer that I'm building, the Absolute Beast, the Mammoth, the Monster.

6
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:57,729
I mentioned it like maybe a month or so ago, saying I was gonna build it soon, I was gonna try to get the parts, and that's what I did.

7
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:04,730
I did that this afternoon, this morning, this evening. I don't even know, my brain is scrambled right now, guys, because it's Black Friday.

8
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,730
Recording this video, it's like two o'clock in the afternoon, just got back, just bought all this stuff.

9
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:15,730
And if you don't know what Black Friday is, let me just, for all you guys, I'm gonna be in different countries that don't have Black Friday.

10
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:24,099
I think it's starting to spread out even more, but it's an American thing where all the stores, all the major outlet stores, all the electronic stores,

11
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:33,099
pretty much every single store in the United States drops their prices on a bunch of different products by sometimes like 40 to 50% off,

12
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:38,099
and it gets like crazy. There's like fights at the door, there's people screaming at each other,

13
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:47,099
Burger Boy this morning got in like three or four different arguments with people, and it's like, dude, you gotta chill out, there's like 150 people standing around the side here.

14
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:52,269
And it was like really cold, it was like, it was freezing, it was below freezing today in Boston,

15
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:56,269
and we're sitting outside the Micro Center, and there's like hundreds of people lined up at the door.

16
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:00,269
It's just, I don't even know, I don't know why I decided to do my computer shopping today.

17
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:06,269
Well, I do know why, I do know why, because I saved like $1,000 by buying all these parts right now.

18
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:12,830
And it can get kind of nerve wracking, you know, when you're sitting outside the door like that, you always hear these horror stories every year,

19
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:22,830
every single year on Black Friday, like somebody dies, you know, maybe not somebody dies, but something horrible happens to somebody every year.

20
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:30,830
It's like, oh, in Montana, some guy got like run over by a tractor, like this stuff does happen because of how crazy these stores get.

21
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,139
But regardless of all of that, I made it out alive, you know, I'm still living.

22
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:40,139
I only got like two computer monitors smashed over my head, so I think I'll survive.

23
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:45,310
No, but the parts that I bought are going to be on the screen right now, if you're curious, if you're wondering what did you get,

24
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,310
you know, what graphics card, what motherboard, how much memory, it's all going to be listed right there.

25
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:57,310
So, if I made a mistake, which I probably did, because every time I try to build a computer, I always have to go back and exchange something,

26
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,310
because either I didn't like the purchase I made or I messed up some compatibility thing,

27
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,310
but I'm pretty sure all these things work together and it should be a pretty beastie PC.

28
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,310
And I'm going to show it, I will do a full anatomy of this computer in a vlog or something when I get a chance,

29
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,310
so you can see like, oh, like that's the lungs or there's the esophagus, that's the thyroid,

30
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,939
like I'll go over all the whole insides of this computer when it's done.

31
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,939
So, the second part of this video is going to take a little bit more of a serious tone,

32
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,939
going to slow it down a little bit, do sort of a real talk with you guys.

33
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:33,939
It's going to cover Thanksgiving and happy Thanksgiving, by the way, I don't think I've said it yet this whole video.

34
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:37,939
Black Friday obviously is today, so Thanksgiving was yesterday,

35
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:45,719
and what we're going to talk about is what you're thankful for, at least this year, for the 2013 season.

36
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,280
What is this, like a baseball team? Oh, the 2013 season of living.

37
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,280
No, we're going to get serious though, we're going to get serious now.

38
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,280
I'm thankful for, and in the comments section guys, please, if you want to share what you're thankful for this year, please do it,

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
and I will get us started.

40
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,270
So, this year I'm definitely thankful for, most importantly, this YouTube channel,

41
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,270
and how much I've grown in the last year.

42
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,580
Those of you guys that have been part of this channel since its inception,

43
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,579
you'll know that I've done a lot of growth in the last year.

44
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:22,579
Since the end of 2012, this channel has more than doubled in size.

45
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:25,579
I was at the same amount of view counts, the same amount of sub counts for a while,

46
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:30,579
and then eventually something happened, and my channel started to really take off,

47
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:34,379
and that's unbelievable.

48
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:37,379
You guys have made me financially independent.

49
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,379
I make money off of YouTube, I don't make very much, but I do,

50
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:44,620
and it's enough to keep me financially independent,

51
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,620
and that's something I have never been able to say, that's something I've never been able to do,

52
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,620
just recently in this last year, have I been able to make enough money,

53
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,860
where I'm not like a bum.

54
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,100
It feels great, it's a great feeling, and I really got to thank all you guys that are here.

55
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,100
That did this for me, that got me here, that supported me,

56
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,100
that continued to support me, whether it's something stupid I do,

57
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,100
whether it's something funny I do, or something serious like this,

58
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,529
then I just got to say thanks. I got to say thank you.

59
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:16,529
I might say it a lot, I might say thanks, I might address you guys a lot in these videos,

60
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:19,769
but it's because I really give a shit, you know what I mean?

61
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:21,769
I care that you guys are here.

62
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:24,769
If you guys weren't here, I'd be making videos to zero people.

63
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:28,120
Think about it, it's a big deal.

64
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,420
And especially in this last year, guys, the support has been overwhelming at times.

65
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,790
It's just great, I wish there was more I could say,

66
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,790
but I'm really thankful this year for that, for you guys, for all this.

67
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,790
Let's push on to 2014 so I can thank you again.

68
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,790
The second thing I'm thankful for is definitely the thing that's a couple doors down,

69
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,970
this new baby in my life.

70
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,209
It's hard to even explain this, but there's a thing over there

71
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:58,209
that has blood in its bloodstream that's part of my bloodstream.

72
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:01,209
That's a very odd thing to say, and this is not like fucking aliens.

73
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:04,209
Don't take it like that, it's not like Predator.

74
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:07,579
Baby's not Predator, all right? Confirmed, baby not Predator.

75
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:08,579
But you know what I mean?

76
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:11,819
I'm thankful for my sister having a very healthy baby,

77
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:17,500
and I'm thankful for my brother, who we just recently found out a month or so ago,

78
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
his wife is pregnant, so there's going to be another kid in this family now

79
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
that's directly related to me.

80
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,060
And I'm thankful for that too.

81
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,560
I'm thankful for all this stuff, man, it's great.

82
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,560
And just before we go, I want to say a couple of final words here.

83
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,560
First of all, happy Thanksgiving, and happy Hanukkah too.

84
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Hanukkah has fallen on the same day as Thanksgiving.

85
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
The day one of Hanukkah is Thanksgiving right now,

86
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,560
so that hasn't happened in like thousands of years or something,

87
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
so that's pretty crazy.

88
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,800
And I want to bring up, before the video ends real quick,

89
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,800
that there is going to be a Christmas video, there is going to be a holiday German video.

90
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,980
It's going to be animated.

91
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,980
It's going to be a full animated short.

92
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,980
I'm not going to tell you what it is, but I'm spending a bunch of time on it right now

93
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,980
with a really talented guy, a really talented animator friend of mine.

94
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,980
And keep your eye on that.

95
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,980
It's probably going to come out sometime in December.

96
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,980
Just starting the hype train now so you know what to look for.

97
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,980
So I'll see you guys all next time.

98
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,149
Happy Thanksgiving, happy Hanukkah, happy holidays, and take care, everybody.
