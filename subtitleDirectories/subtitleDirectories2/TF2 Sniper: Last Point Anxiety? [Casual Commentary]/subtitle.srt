1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:28,699
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm going to be playing as the Sniper with the Machina, the Backscratcher, the shield that's on your back that prevents spies from stabbing you in the back, that thing, the Razorback. That's on, and the ham, I believe, is the melee.

2
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:40,700
That took longer than I wanted to do the intro, but this video is going to talk about something important to Team Fortress 2, and it's something that I feel like we all go through when we get to a stage of a payload like you're going to see here.

3
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:52,700
The first one or two minutes is kind of just the lead up to it. I wanted to make sure it wasn't like a four minute video, so I wanted to keep something in the beginning to have something there, but this is going to be a casual chat about last point anxiety.

4
00:00:52,700 --> 00:01:05,189
Now you're probably wondering, what does that mean? What do you mean last point anxiety? And what I'm talking about here is when the cart, the payload cart, really it could be anything, it doesn't have to be payload, it could be control point, it could be cough, it doesn't matter.

5
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:16,189
But when the last point is nearing capture, but the team is not steamrolling enough for it to be completely imminent, everybody kind of goes into this freak out mode.

6
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:37,189
You'll see it later on so I can describe it a little more clearly, but it's funny to watch that when something victory or defeat is very clearly about to happen, people just go into overdrive and you'll see scouts just like jump on the point and suicide into the pit and then a spy just like face stabbing somebody in front of the cart.

7
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:54,609
Like everybody loses their mind right when that point of the game happens and I want to make like an entire video just called like point overdrive and just capture all the ridiculous things that happen during the final 60 seconds of a pretty much every TF2 game you play.

8
00:01:54,609 --> 00:02:00,609
We've all seen crazy shit in the last 30 seconds, 60 seconds of a game, so it probably wouldn't be that hard to get it.

9
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:11,610
But we're going to transition here now, we're going to actually talk about the topic of the video and as you see here we are on the final point now and the cart is kind of sitting here.

10
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:20,039
It's hanging out right near the very last point, it's sitting right there, they got plenty of time to do this and they've been steamrolling us almost the whole game.

11
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,039
I cut out most of it because obviously that would be a pretty boring video, hey let's watch Jerma get steamrolled.

12
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,039
Who wants to watch that? I mean there's probably some of you that would want to watch that.

13
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:35,039
But I took most of it out, I put the first clip in there for a little bit of preface to it, but you see wherever, they got a lot of time.

14
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,039
We know they have a lot of time and we don't want to lose, so we go into freak out mode first.

15
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:48,039
The red team always goes into freak out mode first because they don't want to lose and if they're close to losing they don't want it to happen.

16
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:59,039
Blue doesn't typically go into the insanity freak out mode until there's like less than two minutes because then if they can't push the last point when it gets to be about the two minute warning,

17
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,860
everybody on blue team is like can we actually do this? Like are we actually going to do this?

18
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,419
So what the fuck man, like people start to freak out because they don't think they're going to win even though they've been winning like the whole game.

19
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:18,419
And you take a look at the time right now, there is more than like five full minutes left and the cart is sitting right on that lip.

20
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:28,419
And so you can imagine every time you die, and I know I'm not alone with this, every single time you die when the cart is that close, you sit there with your fists clenched,

21
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:35,909
you're back against the chair and you're just like, please somebody, and we all do that.

22
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:40,909
I've been in calls with people while we play this game and everybody does that.

23
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:46,909
When the last point is about to get capped, everybody makes that like dying cat noise that everybody does it.

24
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:49,909
Everybody does it. I do it, you do it, he does it, she does it, we all do it.

25
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:57,340
And essentially that noise is you're just waiting for somebody to do something, somebody to cap it, somebody to defend it.

26
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:04,340
And then you exhale and go, get me out there, respawn me, I'm going out there, I'm going to start killing everybody on that other team.

27
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,340
And then you might die instantly again, but the thought still stands there. I love that.

28
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:16,339
The reason why I'm making this video is to talk about that like feeling where you're about to win or you're about to lose, but it's not a complete role.

29
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:21,339
It's a fair kind of balanced game at this point. It's great.

30
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:27,339
This is like the best part of games like this is being in a game like this where you don't know what's going to happen

31
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:34,339
and you're trying to make sure that your team doesn't lose or that your team will push through and win.

32
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:41,339
This is like the quintessential online multiplayer experience is this feeling that we get right here.

33
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:51,160
So for the remainder of this video, I am no longer going to cut my depths because I want you to see just the calamity of nonsense that happens on this cart.

34
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,160
I'm not going to cut it out. I usually typically cut the respawn time because it's just you just sit in there and you're looking at a respawn timer.

35
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,160
But for this one, the camera is sitting right on there and you can get to check out the craziness.

36
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
And the craziness has kind of already started.

37
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:10,160
I'm sure you've seen the engineer on blue that's like building a level three sentry in the door to the right there.

38
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,160
I don't know what the hell he was doing, but he does it a couple of times.

39
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,160
I have to build this. We have to kill them. Get them like that.

40
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,850
I feel like he was screaming in his head this entire time he was building that.

41
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,850
But I'm going to use the remainder of this video for sort of a play by play shoutcast.

42
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,850
I'm not going to really even call it a shoutcast.

43
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,850
I'm going to tell you what I was thinking, what was going through my head, why I did certain things, et cetera.

44
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,850
So you're probably wondering, Jerma, why have you not changed off of sniper?

45
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,850
Why are you not going demo? Why are you not heavy at this point?

46
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,850
Because there are so many people here. There's so many things on the cart.

47
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,850
I was landing my shots pretty well as the sniper. I was killing people.

48
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,850
I was pretty confident that I could get kills with the sniper.

49
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,850
And you just get into a zone. You don't want to change.

50
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,850
And then a bake burner pyro ruins your entire life.

51
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,470
I mean, we all have been there before.

52
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,470
And I'm right now clenching my fist because look what's going on in the cart right now.

53
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,470
We've got a medic. We've got a heavy. Bang, headshot on the heavy.

54
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,470
And then bang, headshot on the medic as well.

55
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,470
And then this demo man comes over and gets killed by the sentry.

56
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,470
That was three opportunities there that they could have had to win the game.

57
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,470
But our team was just like, no, I ain't having that right now.

58
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,839
So I'm respawned. I'm taking a look at the cart.

59
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,839
Just trying to make sure I don't get counter sniped by that guy that's been killing me the whole game.

60
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,839
I'm sure you've realized it by now. I've been getting destroyed.

61
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,839
There's the engineer building the sentry gun again.

62
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,839
But I've been getting destroyed by this sniper.

63
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,839
And I am freaking out looking all over the place for him.

64
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,839
Pyro comes behind me and I still end up getting killed by that same guy.

65
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,839
So even though I was looking for him, I was trying to find him.

66
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,839
I probably shouldn't have shot that engineer because somebody else would have probably killed him.

67
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,839
And then there's a spy on the cart. There's a spy.

68
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,839
And he gets killed. Thank goodness gracious for the demo man.

69
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,839
Because I don't even know if that spy would have backstabbed.

70
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,839
It looked like he missed a couple of times.

71
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,839
And at this point right here, this is where I definitely should have switched.

72
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,839
Because I was too freaking out. My blood pressure was too high.

73
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,839
I was just making dumb mistakes like running into the cart like that.

74
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,839
I guess maybe I could have prevented it a little bit.

75
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,839
But there's a heavy on the cart right now. This is the end of the game right here.

76
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:07,839
No, it's not backstabbed. So let's roll the cart back again.

77
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,839
But then, did you see that?

78
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,839
A spy just like did like a quick turnstab and killed that spy.

79
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,839
And the game is going to end right there.

80
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,839
So all the crazy things that happen at the end there, everybody just freaking out.

81
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:25,019
Nope, everyone loses all their skill during that period where everyone's just body blocking the cart.

82
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:28,019
And just sacrificing themselves over and over again.

83
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:33,019
When if they just kind of cooled off and just took the time to shoot people and kill people,

84
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,189
it probably would have gone a little better for them.

85
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,189
And there are plenty of people that have unbelievable pressure control.

86
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:41,189
It's not every single person.

87
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:46,189
But I put myself in that category of hard to keep myself cool, if that makes any sense.

88
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:48,189
But that's going to wrap up the video guys.

89
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:50,189
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

90
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:52,189
And I'll see you guys all next time.

91
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:54,189
And of course, take care everybody.
