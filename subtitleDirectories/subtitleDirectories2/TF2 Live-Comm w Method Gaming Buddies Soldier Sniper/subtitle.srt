00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,250
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,730
This is going to be a live commentary though. It's going to be a live commentary with four

3
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,489
people. Just messing around, having a good time with the guys from Method Gaming, Pwnstar,

4
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:28,129
MLC Stealth and Enad. Playing as the Soldier and then the Sniper in the next gameplay.

5
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:31,839
Two pretty good gameplays. I probably could have done normal commentaries on them. So

6
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:42,119
enjoy everybody. The live commentary will be kicking in right now.

7
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:16,930
I'm dead. What are you talking about? Oh my God. That's a Spy. That's a Spy. I'm so scared

8
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,730
right now. Get away from me. Is it us three against Enad? No, Pwn. We're on the same

9
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:30,769
team. What are you talking about? I think you need to... Oh my God. Oh my God. That's

10
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:37,689
a lot of people. All right. Let's get a quick cap here. Quick cap. Oh, I died. I'm going

11
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:47,049
for gold here. Jerma rocking it out with 10 points. I don't believe in you. All word

12
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:53,680
I'm in trade says Pwn. The word of the day is all word. We got anybody coming up this

13
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,579
little hallway here? We do. Oh jeez. Somebody just gave me five crates. Is that you right

14
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:08,099
there, Enad? No. What the fuck is this? Oh my God. Sure, let's just sit in the corner.

15
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:14,259
Is that you fucking camping? You little bitch. You were all crotch down, nuts sitting there.

16
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:21,539
Were you fishing or something? I'm on a pyro. You were like casually sitting there too, man.

17
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:25,620
Like you had some beef jerky and beer on the side. You were fucking making... That's called

18
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,620
like camping. That wasn't camping. Who camps in Team Fortress 2? I call it strategic waiting.

19
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,719
Strategic waiting. Okay. Hey, what's the rule? Sitting in the same spot for 30 seconds? I

20
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,560
was only there for like four, five. Bullshit. Yeah, it's the same thing like when a fucking

21
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,759
whore calls herself an escort. It's the same damn thing. Oh man. Oh, Optimus Prime's in

22
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:56,759
here again. Oh, is he on our team? Hopefully Optimus Prime is on our team. He is. Oh, you've

23
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:06,659
got to hit this. Oh, I will. Oh my God, where'd you go? Where'd that medic go? Oh man, come

24
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:14,650
on now. Oh damn it. No, they aren't. Not if I have anything to say about it. Do you think

25
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:22,520
about that one, Burt? No, I didn't. Oh, heavy on point. What's your butthole catch? Oh, you

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,759
guys are going to get it. I've almost got it. Oh my God, uber germa. I've almost got it.

27
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:41,520
Uber germa. No, get away. Too many people. I have nowhere to go. Run. Oh, you guys are

28
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,650
so going to get this. Over time. We can't even get up there. Don't fucking hate. I just

29
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:56,300
want crates. Oh, we won. Oh, I think we did win. They did. Unless somebody can get on

30
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:03,800
this. I think that's all she wrote. I'm hiding. I've got my Sandman out. Oh, that's it. Good

31
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:17,240
to game. All of them. Here we go. I'm a plain sniper. This is going to be the round where

32
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:23,240
we destroy. At least I hope so. Oh, that guy dropped down right at the right time. What?

33
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,160
Oh, you want to duel me, Optimus? You're going to whoop my butt. I got ubered and I just

34
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,759
walked outside and started swinging my sword in every which direction and didn't kill anyone.

35
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:40,759
Then I just ran back inside. Oh, God. I'm the worst. Oh my God. I keep on throwing the

36
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:50,189
Girardi right at somebody's back. That's what I wanted to do. Here we go. Wow, I just got

37
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:56,060
fucking... This guy said, po, no offense. You should have a ping limit. Offense taken.

38
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,019
I am so rich right now. Oh, that was a nice headshot. That's what I'm talking about. That's

39
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:10,259
what I'm talking about. Let me say, let's keep it rolling, boys. You denying the duels,

40
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:17,410
too? No, God. Oh, I got the Gunslinger. I already have that, don't I? It's a good weapon. Any

41
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,290
spies? I'm just throwing the P down. I'm not going to take that chance. Optimus Prime's

42
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:28,860
hiding somewhere. I can't even see. I literally can't even see. I'm just shooting into people's

43
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:33,579
backs. I don't even know if I'm hitting anyone. Okay, now I can leave now this way. So we're

44
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:38,379
doing Battlefield after this, yeah? Yeah, sure. Why not? Well, I'm going to try to.

45
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:43,740
Oh, boom. It's not going to work because my computer's going to be like... Oh, can I get

46
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:52,060
that heavy from back here? There it is. Come on, now. I'm going to try that spy stuff.

47
00:05:52,060 --> 00:06:00,949
Damn it. Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it. Oh, Optimus Prime. What is the Envis watch for the spy?

48
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:10,550
I'm stupid. Oh, no. There he goes. There he goes. Off to the races. He's still alive. Off

49
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:18,480
to the races. Get him. He's not dead. He is not dead. He's going to get me right in the

50
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:34,029
back. God damn it. No, I knew it. I knew he was there. I didn't turn around. Oh, don't

51
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:46,550
even go there. There you go. Nice job, guys. That is going to wrap up the video, guys.

52
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,110
Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it, and I will see you guys all

53
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,470
next time. Take care, everybody.
