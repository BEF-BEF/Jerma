1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:10,429
Hey, what is going on everybody?

2
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,429
Jerma here with some Slender.

3
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:17,859
By popular demand, a lot of people wanted me to play this.

4
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,859
I got a lot of comments telling me to do this.

5
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:27,160
And I looked up some stuff on it, and my god, I'm not ready to play this game.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,339
But you know what? It's Scarce Saturdays, so we gotta go.

7
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:35,530
The whole point of this game is you're supposed to collect eight pages

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:44,380
and avoid this thing that's in the woods, the Slenderman.

9
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:54,039
Here we go. This is just a giant wall in the middle of nowhere.

10
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,850
Oh my god, a page. Okay, there's one.

11
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:08,829
How do I pick it up? Okay.

12
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,829
How do I zoom back out? How do I zoom out?

13
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:17,780
Okay, Q. What is that noise? What's going on here?

14
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:28,150
I'm just gonna run. I don't even want to know. I'm not gonna turn around.

15
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:35,530
Oh, where is this guy? I don't want to go in the same direction that he is.

16
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:45,060
Oh my god. He's right behind me. He's back behind me.

17
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:52,769
Oh my god, please tell me there's like a place I can go over here.

18
00:01:52,769 --> 00:02:00,730
Get me out of here. If I'm holding down shift and I can't run that fast.

19
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:08,689
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

20
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:15,340
Team! Go, go, run, run, you mother.

21
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,870
He is right behind me. Just go.

22
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,469
I found a little archway. A little archway. That's what I want. That's what I want.

23
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:30,150
I don't see him. Don't see him. Don't see him. Don't see him.

24
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,099
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go.

25
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:44,729
Let's grab this note. The drumbeats are gonna drive me crazy.

26
00:02:44,729 --> 00:03:01,840
Can't run? What the hell does that mean? Can't run. Can't run. Great.

27
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,229
What is it, like a bathroom in the middle of nowhere? What the hell is this?

28
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:13,990
Alright, I gotta take like a dump. Hold on, I gotta go in like the bathroom.

29
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,719
This is a bad idea, man. This is a terrible idea. There better be a note in here.

30
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:24,490
Oh man. Oh my god. Oh my god.

31
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,900
What's with this bathroom? This is the weirdest bathroom I've ever seen in my life.

32
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,020
What is going on up there? Oh, there's one. There's a note.

33
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,530
Help me.

34
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:48,830
Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful.

35
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,939
Where else have I not been? I'm lost in the forest.

36
00:03:52,939 --> 00:04:02,129
With a madman.

37
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:10,110
Oh my. That was him. That was him. He's right behind me.

38
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,909
You have to run faster, you son of a bitch. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

39
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:20,129
What's going on? Sticky keys? No, screw you. Oh my god, he must be right behind me now.

40
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:26,730
Dude, like Windows just had like an error because I hit shift way too many times.

41
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:36,459
That's a tree. Oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god.

42
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:43,100
Just don't look at him. Just don't look at him. Just go this way. Go this way. Go this way. Go this way. Go this way.

43
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,730
Oh, man. Oh, you...

44
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,100
Where's the other notes?

45
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,699
Alright, this is different. This is different. This could be a note.

46
00:04:53,699 --> 00:05:01,100
Could be a note here on one of these big trees.

47
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:10,350
Come on, give me a note. Give me a note. Give me something.

48
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:22,189
I have no more run. I have no more run. I have no more run. I have no more run.

49
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:27,860
This guy is just a relentless prick.

50
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,860
Dude, playing Ring Around the Rosie with this guy right now is not a good idea.

51
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:50,319
I just walked into a wall. I just walked into a wall.

52
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:57,560
Well, I'll see you guys all next time. And the link is in the description if you want to play that game.

53
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Slender.

54
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,699
I'll see y'all soon. Take care, everybody.
