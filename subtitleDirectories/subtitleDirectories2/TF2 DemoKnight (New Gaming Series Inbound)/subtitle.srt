00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:06,820
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:12,439
This is gonna be a demo man with the demo night setup. This is just a quick little prelude.

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:17,480
I got a bunch of multi-kills in a row. Just wanted to briefly show them before we got into the actual

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,519
gameplay. The actual gameplay is like three and a half minutes or something, and you guys all know

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:28,359
me. I do not like having less than three or four five minute gameplays, which is why this is here.

6
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,380
And I gotta ask, how was your Christmas? Hope you got what you wanted, hope you gave some things

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,100
to your friends and family as well, because it's not just about getting, it's about giving guys.

8
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:44,700
And the only real holiday that's left in the year is New Year's Eve. And New Year's Eve, if you're

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,420
over 21, New Year's Eve potentially is the best holiday of the year. Only because there is so

10
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,299
much stuff going on, so many parties, so many bars are open really late, it's just awesome.

11
00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:00,939
And even if you're under 21, even if you're not old enough to drink and go to a bar, it's still

12
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:05,900
just as fun. You get to stay up wicked late, hang out with your friends, watch the ball drop, it is

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:12,859
magical. So anyways, I want to talk about a couple of things in this gameplay. I'm not going to really

14
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:17,189
talk about what's going on, because as a demo night, you can't really talk about a whole lot.

15
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,989
You just bullet train people in the face, smash them with your sword, and rinse and repeat. There's

16
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:26,709
not really a whole lot to it. I top frag in this gameplay, but you know, that's, you can pay

17
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:31,799
attention if you want. I want to talk about a new series I want to try and do. A lot of people are

18
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,040
familiar with indie showcases, where, oh, here's an indie game, here's how you play it, there's

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,239
little things about it. Indie showcase. I kind of want to take that another step. I want to do a,

20
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:47,079
not really an indie showcase, an unknown showcase. Take a game that not very many people know about,

21
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,200
not very many people play, and it doesn't necessarily have to be an indie game. It can be

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,599
an older game that maybe everyone has forgotten at this point, or maybe a game that came out

23
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:02,040
recently that nobody really cared about. But it's probably good. So that's my plan, sort of. I want

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,199
to do this unknown series, or unknown showcase, or something. I'm not sure what the title will be yet.

25
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,280
Probably won't be more than once or twice a month. Maybe not even more than once a month. I'm not

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,919
sure. I haven't figured it out yet. But we could probably turn it into a community project. That's

27
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:22,039
kind of the future of the series. I see it as, you know some cool games that maybe not all your

28
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:26,280
friends know about. Maybe you just found it the other day, but I would like to know about it.

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,680
So we could start this community project where we share all these games with each other,

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,199
and it'll be great for everybody. Because we can all, oh I heard of this game. I heard of that game.

31
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,840
You should really do the video on it. Try and get as many people involved as possible. Because a lot

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,159
of these older games guys, especially for PC, if you're going back to like 1995 or something,

33
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,800
they can be pretty difficult to find. Like vaporware. That's what they call it. And also speaking

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,080
of PC, some of the older titles that had servers that were multiplayer, I'm sure nobody plays them

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,319
anymore. So how cool would it be if we got everybody in one of these servers and made an

36
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,199
entire game out of it? I just wanted to throw this out there. Wanted to see what you guys had

37
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:10,039
to think about it. Probably going to start this with the Neverhood. If any of you know what the

38
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:15,800
Neverhood is, I love you to death. And if you don't know what the Neverhood is, you are going

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,599
to find out in the next couple of days. Because that's what I'm going to do the first one. So look

40
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,560
for that on Friday. I'm assuming I'll have it done by Friday. Going to do a small showcase,

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,199
probably a five to six minute video. I'm not sure it'll take much longer than that. And the first

42
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,759
one, like I said, is going to be the Neverhood. The Neverhood is an adventure game for the PC.

43
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:41,159
Came out in 1995. It is made entirely out of claymation. It's one of the best games I've ever

44
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,759
played in my life. It's my childhood and it's great. So you can either wait for the showcase

45
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,960
this weekend or you can go do some research yourself. But let's talk about the gameplay now

46
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,479
for just a minute so I can give you one or two tips before the video is over. This is on King

47
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:03,479
of the Hill Lakeside, arguably the best demo night map in the game. Pretty much any King of the Hill

48
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,560
map, you'll have success with the demo night. Because there's so many places you can run around,

49
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,599
so many hiding spots. Not to mention people are literally all over the place because there's only

50
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,959
one point right in the middle. And really the only thing you have to worry about as a demo night on

51
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,959
a King of the Hill map is an engineer. Because most engineers are going to be running with the

52
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,560
mini sentry, which can really be horrible if you're playing demo night. If you charge somebody and

53
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,720
there's a mini sentry right near where you charged, you're in a lot of trouble because you can't

54
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,759
really get away and you're just sitting there taking hits over and over again and it'll eventually

55
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,639
kill you. A good way to go against that is to equip one of the grenade launchers and not have

56
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,879
the wee booties on. But in my opinion, I like to play demo night straight up full demo night,

57
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,680
which it actually does get me killed quite often. But I love the theory behind it. I love the

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,199
aesthetics. Like you have one item, you can only swing at people, that's all you can do.

59
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,199
And of course you can charge too, but it's just funny when you scroll through your weapons.

60
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:08,360
Nope, just got a melee item. It just makes me laugh every time. The only other real enemy you need to

61
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,399
be careful of is a pyro with a compression blast because they will just bounce you around and get

62
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,300
away from you. Other than that though, you can pretty much take anyone else. You get the jump on

63
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,259
somebody, doesn't matter who it is, you'll probably kill them. That's going to be the end of the video

64
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,060
guys. Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. Keep on the lookout for this new

65
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,819
unknown showcase I'm going to start doing and I'll see you guys all next time. Take care everybody.
