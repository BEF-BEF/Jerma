1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,349
This is gonna be you want to get bake-stabbed part two. Do you want to go to sleep a little bit?

2
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,149
Hey, you want to go to sleep? You want to go to sleep? You want to get sleep slabs?

3
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,839
Hey, you want to get sleep-stabbed?

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,289
You want to get sleep-stabbed? I don't want to get sleep-stabbed. Is it like when you go to sleep,

5
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:30,489
but a spy was like actually disguised as your bed?

6
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:39,280
I can't even like play because you just said that. Come here, I got you.

7
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,630
You want to get sleep-stabbed? I don't want to get sleep-stabbed.

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:56,299
The spy is just like a big square. I don't know how he does it. What am I voting for?

9
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:09,370
What are you singing? Is that copyright? Is that copyright? Yes. Then are you singing a

10
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:18,459
copyrighted song? You're gonna get me arrested. Hey, I only copyright when I'm Fourth of July.

11
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:22,939
I can't believe I got that guy. Actually, you know what? I can believe that because I should

12
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:32,569
have got him. Yeah, you had it in you the whole time. I hope I did. What are you playing as right

13
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:39,079
now? The snipper rifle guy, the Australian long shoot man. Oh, the guy with like the

14
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:46,890
elephant hunting rifle? Yeah. Well, you can take down a wildebeest with this. When are they gonna

15
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:56,030
put in a hunting rifle in TF2? Damn it. When are you gonna make a new huntsman with changed stats?

16
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:04,250
When are you gonna make a crossbow that on headshot does 700,000% more damage than the

17
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:13,530
huntsman and on body shot, you fucking EXE crash out of TF2? That would be actually really cool.

18
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:21,319
I like that idea. Yeah, you don't get a headshot, you HL2.EXE crash if you don't get a headshot.

19
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,080
What happens if you miss? Like you don't get a body shot, but you miss? Does it still crash?

20
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:32,000
No. What happens? Does your FPS drop by 10 every time you miss? Yeah, your FPS drops by 10 every

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,620
time you miss. And if you land a headshot, it goes back up. Oh, I'm just like walking around.

22
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:49,419
It's the skill based mechanic. The periwinkle. Insert funny name here because I'm tired and I

23
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,830
don't know funny names. Periwinkle. No, but periwinkle. No, that sounds like a Christmas toy.

24
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,180
Are you saying that it's not a Christmas toy? It has like festive lights on it.

25
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:13,610
Touche. Touche. Gotcha. Touche. God, Hamlet's headshot him in the air. Kill me.

26
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:19,560
Oh, crashed the desktop. No, my FPS is just dropping. Oh, body shot.

27
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:29,949
How about a rocket launcher that has one shot, that has one bullet in it, and it moves like

28
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:34,590
two miles per hour. When you shoot it, it moves incredibly slow. It's like a turtle,

29
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,159
but wherever it lands or wherever it hits, explodes the size. Hey, hold on before you go

30
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,830
any further with this. Why is everyone always going to make fun of turtles? What's what we mean?

31
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:50,250
Oh, it's so slow. It's like a turtle. Because turtles are frigging slow. Not all of them.

32
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:57,580
You've met a fast turtle? Yeah. What's his name? That's my grandfather. How is that not a headshot?

33
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,509
That was like a shoulder shot. I tell you my grandfather's a turtle and all you have to say

34
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:07,710
is, oh, how was that not a headshot? You're very supportive, Jerma. Your grandfather was really a

35
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:17,310
turtle? Yes. What was his name? Longbeard. Longbeard the turtle. Yeah, he was a pirate too. So he had

36
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,560
like a pirate name, like Longbeard. Because every pirate is named after their beard. You got red

37
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,259
beard, long beard, yellow beard, gold beard, Johnny Locks beard. We're going to have to call

38
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:36,160
Burger Boy Cheese Crumbs because that's what is always in his beard. That's actually a really good

39
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:44,269
pirate name. Hey, Cheese Crumbs, get over here. The same scout has hit me with every single move.

40
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:52,990
You know, how about that one? Yeah. Oh, right when I was like starting to do like decent and by

41
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,560
decent, I mean like luckily shoot one dude in the face. Oh, get me. You're not going to get me.

42
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,480
Too bad. You're not going to get me. I'm standing right behind him. You don't even have, you have no

43
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:10,300
idea. You have no idea. You're not going to get me. What team was I just, what's going on here?

44
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:17,019
I'm so confused. What was happening? If you have reserve slot, I think you do. They can't kill you

45
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:27,560
at the end of the round. Oh, yo, Merry Christmas. That's that. Why is your server have yo Merry

46
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:36,410
Christmas? It's festive and shit. Yeah, but it's not Christmas anymore. Anymore. It's always

47
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,250
Christmas. You just had like the Huntsman with the lights on it. Yeah, but that's, but I didn't mean

48
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:50,810
to. Christmas isn't a holiday. It's a way of life. I guess you're right. Cause you wake up in the

49
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:59,449
morning. You're like, yo, Merry Christmas. Yo, Merry Christmas. Is that what you do when you wake

50
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:06,329
up? That's the first thing I say. I wake up, I look at the ceiling and I go, yo, Merry Christmas.

51
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:13,949
And then I diarrhea every single morning. Let's edit that part out. Cause I don't want people to

52
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:22,810
know that I diarrhea every morning. I think they know. I think they, they can just guess. Oh, you

53
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:32,829
know that guy German? Oh yeah. He diaries every morning. How did I not kill that scout? No,

54
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,680
you Swayze son of a bitch. Hi, I have ham. Tyco RC is about to charge up his batteries for his race

55
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,040
car and have the battery only last 15 minutes after like a six hour charge. What is this guy

56
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:59,120
doing over here? Are you, what are you hiding from? Are you protecting this rock? All right.

57
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,060
Yeah, I guess he was protected. We are at the last point. It makes a little bit of sense. I guess

58
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,269
got to protect that rock because once you lose the rock, everyone could just walk into mortar

59
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:19,550
mortar. All right. New, new tests to see if I can do this. I have to stay alive on star server for

60
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:32,939
more than 15 seconds. See if I can do it. Is that you? Are you the pyro? Nope. Nope. Oh, your,

61
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:41,439
your pathetic little grenades just bounce off my manly chest. Come on. Shoot me again. Didn't work.

62
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:48,779
It didn't even work. Oh, I didn't know it protects it against that. I am completely protected. Okay.

63
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:54,319
Let's see how long you stay alive at the mid fight. Okay. If I die at this mid fight, I have to like

64
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,740
drink the rest of my ice coffee as fast as I can. That'll hurt your head. God damn it. Why did I

65
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:06,160
just say that? That was not a good idea. That means I have to stay alive. That'll hurt your head.

66
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,029
Don't hide in the corner either. No, I'm going, I'm going up balls to the wall. This is happening.

67
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:22,360
I cannot die here. Mid fight. Here we go, baby. Smoke it. That was a terrible jump. Smoke it.

68
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,050
No, get this pyro out of here. I lived. I don't have to drink my ice coffee as fast as I can.

69
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:36,700
I'm going to come kill you like right now though. No, you're not. Oh, I thought you didn't have

70
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:44,399
that much health. It's okay. It's okay. I've died from like 30 scouts since hitting F9.

71
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:53,080
I have like jello vision right now. Did you do something to me? No, I didn't do anything.

72
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:00,110
Did you like give me drugs? What's going on? Oh my God. This is bad. This is real bad.

73
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:15,789
It's serious. Hey, tell me when you respawn. All right. You guys can have a comeback.

74
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:22,590
Are you about to give me like 100% corrects and no clip? Are you, are you respawn? I am spawned.

75
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:29,279
I am spawned. Good luck. What is this thing? Oh no, do it again. I walked into like a freaking

76
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:38,330
resupply. Oh, what does this thing mean? What does this thing do? Just have fun. Just shoot a guy.

77
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:50,570
Oh dear Lord. Oh boy. Oh no. People are going to think I'm a legitimate hacker.

78
00:09:51,529 --> 00:10:03,100
I got killed. Some pyro blew the rocket back. I went spy because I was going to try and kill

79
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:09,960
you while you were like that, but. Dude, I died within 10 seconds of me having that thing.

80
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,639
Can I have it again? I don't know. I don't know if I can trust you.

81
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:28,110
Let me have it again. All right. This time I promise I'll make use of it. Yay. What is it? Oh,

82
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:35,360
right. God, no. Oh, that's you. Stabbed you in the back. Now I'm Swayze. Just give yourself

83
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:43,120
the valve rocket launcher. I could no clip. Just no clip and stop backstabbing people.

84
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:50,240
You know what? You know what, Jerma? You know what? That's a good idea. I just want to see this.

85
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:06,159
Waiting. Oh damn it. I was like waiting to watch and I got friggin' cabred. I actually died.

86
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:20,700
Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. I feel bad for that Angie.

87
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:27,549
Like of all the ways for your sentry to go down, the spy who just came through the wall

88
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:31,870
was probably like the worst. Can we have just like another no clip fight?
