1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:22,070
Wash hogs. We're here. We're the wash hogs. We wash hogs. Do not adjust your screens. Do not adjust your monitors. This is the pixelation on the screen is just wash hogs at its finest.

2
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,809
You did. I had the marker directly on you.

3
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:34,810
I'm going to put this on you and it's going to say, I'm going to put this over you like, oh, under hypnotherapy for phobias. I'm going to move it to you and it's going to be like, idiot.

4
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,579
Are you ready?

5
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,950
A little bit.

6
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,950
All right, we're going to go see. You have to stay on.

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,619
Actually, don't crash. Kind of surprised this is actually working.

8
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:49,619
Why is this working?

9
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,619
You should not crash. Don't crash. Don't crash.

10
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,619
This is my life on the line.

11
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:57,619
It's going to be harder than that.

12
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:59,619
I'm like a bull rodeo thing.

13
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:00,619
I am.

14
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:02,619
So I'm going to dump you do it so hard.

15
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:05,760
What?

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
Hold on a second.

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,760
We'll go. I'll find a way.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
I will find a way to dump you.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,319
You.

20
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,780
Okay.

21
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,780
Now we're going for the bridge to the left.

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,780
It's to the left.

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,780
I know.

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,780
Okay.

25
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,590
Let's go on the bridge.

26
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,590
I want to make the jump while on the roof.

27
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:40,060
That was a sick jump.

28
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,060
I'm going to just drive straight.

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,060
Wherever it takes us, it takes us, you know?

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,060
Yeah, I know.

31
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,549
Wherever we go, we go.

32
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,620
You have like a Spider-Man web coming out of your ass.

33
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,620
Why not?

34
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,620
I'm also holding an assault rifle.

35
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,620
Just a dude with an AK.

36
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,620
Do you see your leg? Is your leg doing the same thing?

37
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,620
It's going like...

38
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,620
I can't really see anything.

39
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,659
You're like lifting your leg to pee like a dog.

40
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:10,469
I feel like I'm in a Batman movie.

41
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:13,469
I feel like this is like, I'm the Dark Knight.

42
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,469
That's Raiders of the Lost Ark, I think.

43
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:21,469
No, it's not. It's Batman.

44
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:23,469
That's Batman of the Lost Ark.

45
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:26,710
Why can I not hack the traffic lights?

46
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,710
I already did.

47
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,710
This guy, what happened?

48
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,719
He squirted out.

49
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,719
Let's go.

50
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,219
I mean, there's a giant jump right here.

51
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,219
Let's go! Yay!

52
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,490
Why did I die like 30 seconds late?

53
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,789
You died?

54
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:56,219
Why did you die?

55
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,219
Oh, good.

56
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,219
Give me a push. Push me.

57
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,219
Please push me.

58
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,219
Come on.

59
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,530
You can do it.

60
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,770
Yeah.

61
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,770
Alright.

62
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,710
Totally, totally spectacular, man.

63
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:19,259
These cops just drive over here and just sit here and do nothing?

64
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:23,159
That guy's doing something.

65
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,159
They don't get out of their cars unless you do.

66
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,159
I'm stuck in my car.

67
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,159
That guy didn't even try.

68
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,159
That cop didn't even try.

69
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,159
He went straight through.

70
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,159
He didn't even try.

71
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,159
He was just sitting there.

72
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,159
He was like, what a fucking idiot.

73
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,159
You're just going to let it open and fall through?

74
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,159
Oh, look at this.

75
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,159
Look at this mess.

76
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,340
Oh, shit.

77
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,770
Oh, that idiot cop.

78
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,770
Oh, please tell me I can just...

79
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:02,020
That didn't do anything.

80
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,020
It broke my windows.

81
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,520
That broke the windows.

82
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
I want to go play with the train, mommy.

83
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,520
I want to go play with the train.

84
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,520
What the fuck?

85
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,519
We need to find one of the stairs.

86
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,519
That's why I'm driving in the first place.

87
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,519
Look at this rock.

88
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,519
We're going to do it from the rock.

89
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,170
You can't do it from the rock.

90
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,199
Get the car up here.

91
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,199
We're going to jump from this rock.

92
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,199
I was just kidding.

93
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,470
This piece of shit car is behind me.

94
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,470
It's right here.

95
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,470
I'm going my own goddamn way.

96
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,470
Right here.

97
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,470
You're going to take the bike to the steam car.

98
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,610
What was that?

99
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,610
Speaking of what was that?

100
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,610
The train.

101
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,610
Get out of my way.

102
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,850
I need to get in the train.

103
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,850
You're standing on some weight.

104
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,850
I can't.

105
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,850
I'm up.

106
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,850
I made it.

107
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,850
Let's get out of the train.

108
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:23,680
It's just inching forward.

109
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
It's pushing me.

110
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,300
This guy does not give a shit.

111
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,300
He's nubbing me.

112
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,540
He's nudging me. Look at this.

113
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,540
He's like, get out of the fucking way, you idiot.

114
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,540
Just keep driving.

115
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,279
Get the guy that does the Guinness Book of World Records.

116
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,279
Get the guy that does the

117
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,279
Guinness Book of World Records down here right now.

118
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,279
This has got to be some kind of a record.

119
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,500
You want to have a fucking motorcycle duel?

120
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Is that what you wanted?

121
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,740
A motorcycle fight?

122
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,740
He poses.

123
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,740
Nice try.

124
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
Motorcycle fight.

125
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
Still doing it.

126
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,740
I'm still going.

127
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740
Nothing will knock you off a motorcycle.

128
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
Wash hogs. Get it right please.

129
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,430
Motorcycle fight.

130
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,430
See ya.

131
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,430
See ya later.

132
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,430
I did the same thing.

133
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,860
Alright.

134
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,860
I want to get on the back of your mumber cycle.

135
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,860
You can't. Bye.

136
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,230
Get back here.

137
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,110
This guy is like pretending to shoot at you.

138
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,439
He's got like an

139
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,439
iPad.

140
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,439
He's like shooting an iPhone game.

141
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,829
What's he really doing here?

142
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,829
Out in the middle of nowhere.

143
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:50,420
What did you just do?
