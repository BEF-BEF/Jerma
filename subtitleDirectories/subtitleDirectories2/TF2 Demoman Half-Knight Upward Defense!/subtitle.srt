00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:17,500
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Demo Knight.

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Well, not really half Demo Knight, I guess you could call it, because I'm still using the lock and load, I'm not using the Wii booties like you typically would if you were using a strict Demo Knight setup.

3
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:35,939
But really though, what really is the Demo Knight? Is it just any Demoman with a sword, or do you have to have on the Wii booties, or do you have to have a shield on?

4
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:41,939
I would probably assume that if you're running around with a shield on, you are a Demo Knight.

5
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:48,939
Because really the charge mechanic and the crit you get on your melee weapon, it's, you're a Demo Knight. If you got a shield on, that's the way it is.

6
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:58,500
And I've actually become more accustomed to using this type of setup where you have that long range option with the lock and load or the grenade launcher.

7
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Because the Wii booties, really if you think about it, all the Wii booties are gonna do for you is give you the extra 25 health and a little bit better turning accuracy.

8
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,500
But really though, it's just the 25 health that really matters in that situation.

9
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,500
So if you don't care about 25 health and there's medics on the team and you're getting overheal, it's okay to not put on the Wii booties.

10
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,799
Plus it is also going to solve a major problem that Demo Knights have.

11
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:29,799
After you charge somebody and you miss if they get away from you, you do absolutely nothing.

12
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:37,799
You run backwards or you just try and wildly mad men swing at them and a lot of times it doesn't work. Sometimes it does.

13
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,799
But this gives you an option to step back and go, okay, I'll pull out my gun if you're going to pull out your gun.

14
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,549
And it also really doesn't matter if you're going to use the default grenade launcher or you're going to use the lock and load.

15
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:58,549
It's just personal preference. Let's say you tell yourself, do I want to be able to spam around this corner and then charge over there and smash somebody in their skull?

16
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:05,549
Or do I want to sit back and try and get those direct shots, kind of like I'm doing, even though I am failing pretty miserably at it.

17
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,550
Later on in the video, I do get a couple of good direct shots, but it really is just personal preference.

18
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:17,180
So now I want to briefly talk about a couple of things and not about the gameplay really at all. It's going to be in the background.

19
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:24,180
I want to discuss a lot of you guys have a bunch of concerns about the giveaway I'm doing and I want to be very clear with this.

20
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:31,610
I want to clarify this to those of you that are concerned. No, I am not quitting Team Fortress 2.

21
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,610
I'm going to keep making videos on Team Fortress 2. I have plenty of backup items.

22
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,610
I have a lot of people, a lot of good friends that are willing to help me with this.

23
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,610
So do not worry about me. I'm going to be here for a long time, guys.

24
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:51,090
I don't think I could even if I tried. This game has a real deep clench on my heart and in my brain.

25
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,090
I love this game way too much to quit it. So nobody be concerned about that.

26
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,090
I am not going anywhere. Jerma is here forever until I'm 157 years old.

27
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,090
I'm going to keep making Team Fortress videos.

28
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:10,270
So now that that is out of the way, I want to talk about the Steam Workshop thing that I'm doing.

29
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,270
Like you all know, I have a modeler that is diligently working on these couple of things.

30
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:21,449
It is not one thing. It is multiple things and they are all for the heavy.

31
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:24,449
And I'm going to make sure I make this clear again. It is not a weapon.

32
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:29,449
It is not an item that you equip to gain stats or to shoot. It's not an item.

33
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:32,449
It is a hat and a miscellaneous.

34
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:37,750
Some of you have already started to speculate it because I think I've talked about this before.

35
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:44,750
But it's coming. It's great too. I wish I could just show you and tell you because I was laughing my ass off.

36
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,750
When I saw it for the first time, at least one of the items, I was dying laughing.

37
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:54,990
So expect more information and maybe even a few images in the next coming weeks.

38
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,990
So that's all I'm going to really say about that now.

39
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:01,990
But speculate away and if you already know what it is, then congratulations, you know what it is.

40
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,259
So let's talk about the gameplay for the last minute or so here.

41
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:10,430
Playing on upward. I think I forgot to say the map we're playing on.

42
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:17,430
This is defense on upward and right about now, they're coming to the last point and I'm not really doing a whole lot.

43
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,430
I'm kind of just, oh, let me shoot over here and let me shoot over there.

44
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,430
I'm not really doing anything.

45
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:28,430
Probably should have changed to the sticky launcher at this point and taken this off, put on the default grenade launcher.

46
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,430
But I don't do that and I end up doing pretty much nothing for the next 50 seconds.

47
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,610
To be honest, I was being a little too overconfident.

48
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,610
I was telling myself, no, I just got to get one or two kills with the eye lander.

49
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,610
Get myself with my health up, be able to run faster. That does not happen.

50
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,610
I act like a scrub for the remaining part of this video.

51
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,100
So here comes my most glorious moment in Team Fortress 2.

52
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,100
I'll make sure to slow it down because it really is.

53
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,100
You start taking notes now, guys, because I'm the biggest pro you could ever meet in your life.

54
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,100
So I turn around here, see an engineer building something.

55
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,389
So yeah, that's definitely something you want to do any time of century is right next to you.

56
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,339
Shoot it and get the blast damage killing yourself. That's a great idea.

57
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:20,339
So anyways, guys, this is going to be the end of the video. I go for an eye lander attempt.

58
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,339
Doesn't happen. I fall down in the pit of despair and we lose the game.

59
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:27,579
So thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

60
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:31,990
And I'll see you guys all soon. So take care, everybody.
