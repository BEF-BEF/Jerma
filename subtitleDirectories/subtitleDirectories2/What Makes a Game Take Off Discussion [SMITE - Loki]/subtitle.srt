00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:21,269
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some Smite gameplay slash commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as Loki, the trickster god of Thor's brother and Zeus's son.

2
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:24,449
I think that's right, I hope. No, Odin's son, right? Yes.

3
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:31,690
Well anyways, this is Smite. Again, I'm getting into this game a lot more than I did before, and I'm not exactly sure what the reason is for that.

4
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:37,689
I think it's just you go through those cycles of games that you play, and this is the one right now that I happen to be playing a ton of.

5
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:44,689
But I'm gonna talk about this game, Smite. I'm not gonna really talk about the gameplay, really. It's a 12 and 4, I think, 12 and 5.

6
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:50,689
It's just a couple of montage-y type clips back to back of me getting some kills, getting a double kill, and that sort of stuff.

7
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:55,689
But I'm gonna talk about a topic and a discussion I want to get you guys to chime in on as well in the comments section.

8
00:00:55,689 --> 00:01:02,859
It's about what makes a game take off, and the reason why I bring this up is Smite is one of those games that's still currently in beta,

9
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:09,859
but it hasn't really steamrolled yet. It hasn't really taken off yet, at least as of the recording of this video.

10
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:13,859
It still kind of has a small community of players that are playing it currently in the beta.

11
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,859
Now when the game opens up, this could completely change. This game could be incredibly popular.

12
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:22,859
A lot of people will be playing it. People will be making videos and streaming it. I'm just not exactly sure.

13
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:26,859
But I want to get your guys' opinion on this, because I was thinking about this the other night in my bed,

14
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,859
because that's where I do all my thinking. You guys know that.

15
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:37,099
What makes a game take off? How do you get a game to go from a small community to an explosion of popularity?

16
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:40,099
And I'm gonna bring up one game in particular. It's Minecraft.

17
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:46,459
Minecraft was made by like one dude, or like a few handful of people in Java,

18
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:51,459
and the game just absolutely erupted with this crazy popularity.

19
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:54,459
And I think you can break it down into maybe a couple different categories.

20
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:59,700
And Minecraft would probably fall into this one, which is ingenuity.

21
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,700
When there is a game that comes out or something that is being developed that has been never seen before

22
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,699
and has nothing like it on the market at all, that's where people say,

23
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:14,699
holy crap, look at that game. You could build blocks and the whole world is like eight times the size of the Earth,

24
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,699
and I can get in the multiplayer server with my friends.

25
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:23,699
There's a whole lot of stuff going on in Minecraft that made it something like that has never been released ever before in the history of video games.

26
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:31,000
But is that all it takes? Is that all it takes to get yourself out there and to get your name noticed in the gaming industry

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
is to be able to make something that has never been seen before? I don't know.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And that's why I want to get your guys' opinion on this, get you guys to chime in in the conversation,

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
because I feel like there are a lot of games out there that require attention,

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
that if you don't get a chance to play them, you are losing out.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And they are very small, knit groups of people, and I would definitely even put Team Fortress 2 into this group.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
As popular and as amazing as the game is, it still has a very, very, very small community,

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and there are people that don't even know that Team Fortress 2 even exists still, that you can still play it.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,240
I have a personal friend of mine that plays console, plays PC, plays everything, and he didn't even know.

35
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,240
He did not even know that Team Fortress 2 has been doing these big updates to the PC version.

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,240
He thought the Xbox version just came out, and oh yeah, I played it, it was fun, oh cool.

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,240
And he doesn't even know that the TF2 version on the PC has like a million different updates,

38
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,740
and all the crazy new maps, all the crazy new game modes, weapons, items. He was flabbergasted at that.

39
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,740
But let's move away from Team Fortress 2 and bring up the second thing that I think makes a game explode,

40
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:41,740
and it's ease of play. If you cannot just jump into a game and play and kind of know what you're doing

41
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,740
in the first 20 minutes or 15 minutes of you getting in the game, chances are you're going to stop playing it,

42
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,740
or you're going to say, this game is way too hard for me, it's way too ridiculous for me.

43
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,740
Perfect example right here is of Dark Souls. You guys probably saw the Dark Souls video.

44
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:01,740
If you haven't, I suggest you go watch it. I made a Dark Souls video, recorded the first half an hour of me playing the game,

45
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,740
and I seriously almost diarrhea'd my pants because of how hard that game is.

46
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,740
I don't even know if I'll ever play that game again.

47
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,740
I may or may not do it just for fun on a live stream or something like that, watch me rage or something,

48
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:19,100
but the game is so, there's so much to it, and it's so difficult, and the learning curve is pretty steep

49
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,100
that it turns off a lot of people, and I would bring Smite into this category as well.

50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:31,100
But then again, you take a look at a game like League of Legends or Dota, Dota 2, those games are insanely popular.

51
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,279
They are like worldwide phenomenons. So how come, why is Smite not in that category?

52
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,279
You think of like Heroes of Newerth, you think of, like I said, Dota 2, League of Legends.

53
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,279
Why is Smite not one of those big games right now?

54
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:50,279
And I'm trying to figure out why, because I love this game.

55
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,519
I think this game is one of the most fun games I've played in the last year or two,

56
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,519
and when the game finally releases and it's not in beta anymore, it's completely free to play, open to the public,

57
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,519
it will get some more players and it will get some more attention,

58
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,519
but it's going to fall into that category of, like I said, Team Fortress 2,

59
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,519
and some of these games that have the really good community, small communities behind them,

60
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,519
like something like Monday Night Combat is another MOBA type game that's like this,

61
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,519
Awesome Knots is another game that's like this, but why are these games not huge?

62
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,519
Who decides that? Who's the one that makes the decisions on stuff like this?

63
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,519
Because I want to meet them and I want to say, look, dude, alright, listen, baby,

64
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,949
you've got to make this game popular because it's a fun game, dude, you've got to play this.

65
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,949
And maybe that is really all it takes.

66
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:37,949
Now that I really sit down and I think about it, maybe that really is all it takes.

67
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:41,949
It's just word of mouth telling people how much fun things are,

68
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:44,949
and then they get it and they get the same thing and they tell their friends and they have so much fun,

69
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:48,949
and that's where it all explodes from, because Minecraft, going back to Minecraft,

70
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:53,949
Minecraft really blew up during the YouTube breakout, when YouTube was starting to get,

71
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:58,949
let me rephrase that, when YouTube Gaming started to really take off,

72
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,949
people were making Minecraft videos, and then everyone started to play Minecraft

73
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,949
because they saw the Minecraft videos, they saw all these people having so much fun making creations

74
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:10,949
and hanging out with their friends, that's where it comes from.

75
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:14,949
So I guess before the video is over, I want to, of course, get your input as well

76
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,949
as to why you think games can take off and why some of them don't take off,

77
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:20,949
and I guess we will end it at that.

78
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:23,949
So again, please leave your comments in the comments section, let's keep the discussion going,

79
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,949
and thank you so much for watching, I really do appreciate it,

80
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:29,949
and I'll see you guys all next time, and of course, take care, everybody.
