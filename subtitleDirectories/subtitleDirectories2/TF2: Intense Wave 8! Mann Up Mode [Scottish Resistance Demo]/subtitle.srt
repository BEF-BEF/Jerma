00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,320
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,320
Doing a lot of Team Fortress 2 the last couple of days, and that's because Man vs. Machine is just a ton of fun,

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:29,320
and especially this Man Up mode. And the only way you can get into a Man Up mode server is if you buy one of these Tour of Duty tickets.

4
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,320
They are 99 cents each, and these tickets allow you to not only play in the Man Up mode servers,

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,820
but after you complete one of these six missions, there's only six right now, you are going to consume that ticket,

6
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,820
and it's going to give you a random item. Now, you are definitely going to be playing for these items.

7
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,820
It is very, very difficult. As you'll see in this video, this is one of the most intense things ever,

8
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,820
that I've ever done in Team Fortress, or gaming in general. You're going to see some really intense moments here,

9
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:04,819
stuff that comes down to the absolute wire, and I believe Shibby has this on his channel as well if you want to see his perspective.

10
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:10,629
Just wanted to give this video a brief introduction. Playing on the map Decoy, this is wave 8 only,

11
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:16,000
and I hope you guys enjoy the chaos that is about to ensue. So thank you guys so much for watching,

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
we really do appreciate it, and enjoy the live commentary. Take care, everybody.

13
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,519
Go back and spend it.

14
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,760
Yeah.

15
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,530
Back, and crit boosts.

16
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,530
I haven't even got to shoot anybody yet with my sentry.

17
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:03,159
Oh, I got destroyed projectile. I can just keep shooting rockets. Nice.

18
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,159
Alright.

19
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,159
Oh shit.

20
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,150
How was that mover again? Demo.

21
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,150
Do you want it now?

22
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,150
No, don't use it. Hold on to it.

23
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,150
I need ammo.

24
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,150
That money.

25
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,150
Do it now.

26
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,520
That paper.

27
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Pick up the ammo crate when you can.

28
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,020
Oh, these guys are all going to die when they step on that.

29
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,020
So that's not taking all the ammo from the dispensers?

30
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,020
Yeah, I'm shooting your rockets.

31
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,020
Very good, very good.

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,639
I haven't even got to kill anybody with the sentry yet.

33
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,069
Might as well.

34
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,069
Oh, that was dumb.

35
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:41,069
Here comes another super soldier.

36
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,069
That was dumb.

37
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,310
He's got all crits. Watch out.

38
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,620
Money steps on that.

39
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,620
Watch these rockets. I got it, I got it.

40
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,240
I need...

41
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,740
Here comes the con and the heavy.

42
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,740
Heavy with the medics.

43
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,740
You got crits?

44
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,919
Heavy with medics.

45
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,159
Oh boy.

46
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,159
Here he comes, here he comes.

47
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,159
Oh boy.

48
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh, I died, I died. Shit.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What is he doing up here?

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What is he doing up here?

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is there a path change?

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,069
I don't know, but we got to get rid of this tank.

53
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,590
Tank always goes left. You're good about that.

54
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,360
Oh man, there's bad news.

55
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,009
They're all over here. They're going up that right...

56
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,009
They're going to try and go up there with you.

57
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:29,009
I'm going to try and take the medics.

58
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,389
Oh, damn.

59
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:36,169
Medics are gone, medics are gone.

60
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:37,169
This heavy should go down.

61
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:38,169
He's dead.

62
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:39,469
Nice one.

63
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,469
Two snipers.

64
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:42,469
We got to get rid of this thing.

65
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:43,469
Oh, coming up again.

66
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:47,969
I am officially out of ammo.

67
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:52,129
Oh come on, step on that.

68
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:53,129
They're just walking over it.

69
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:54,560
This heavy's coming up onto it.

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
German, get rid of detonator on them.

71
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,930
Yep.

72
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,930
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for him.

73
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,930
I'm going to need help with this tank, guys.

74
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,930
Yeah, I'm here.

75
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,930
We got this heavy over here.

76
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,930
I don't think we're going to get it.

77
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,729
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

78
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:07,729
I'm coming back.

79
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,229
Tank, tank, tank.

80
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:10,229
Oh no.

81
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,229
It's alright, we're here.

82
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:12,229
We're here, we're here.

83
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:13,229
Kill it.

84
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,229
Oh no, it might be too late.

85
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:15,229
Nope.

86
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:16,230
We got a big dude here.

87
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,040
Yes.

88
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,560
Alright.

89
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,740
Do you got...

90
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,740
No.

91
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,740
That was nuts.

92
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,300
I almost got crits.

93
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,300
This is the first...

94
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,300
Hey, this is the first...

95
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,300
No, not yet.

96
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,300
This is the first we've ever been.

97
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Alright, do it now, do it now, do it now.

98
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
Go.

99
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,670
They popped uber.

100
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,230
Oh, come on.

101
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,230
Please tell me they're going to all have no open with this.

102
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,230
Come on.

103
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,660
Damn it.

104
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,920
No.

105
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Fucking sniper.

106
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Fuck.

107
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
It's alright, it's alright.

108
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Get the medic, get the medic.

109
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,160
There we go.

110
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Got him.

111
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Get this, get him.

112
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
Get him.

113
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Get him.

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
No.

115
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
It's alright, it's alright.

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
This is the furthest we've ever been.

117
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,860
Just relax, relax a little bit, relax.

118
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,860
We only have like a little bit left.

119
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,860
There's a sniper around.

120
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,860
Heads up.

121
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,860
There's a sniper around.

122
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,860
Be aware.

123
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,860
Watch out for this guy.

124
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,860
Got to kill his medics.

125
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,860
Oh, he's over here on the left.

126
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,860
On the right.

127
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,860
He's ubering.

128
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
Fuck.

129
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,420
It's alright, it's alright.

130
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,339
Knock the medic away, knock the medic away.

131
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,639
He's got to go down in a second.

132
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,639
He comes up here.

133
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,399
Yes.

134
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,399
Oh.

135
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,399
God.

136
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,399
I got to go.

137
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,399
I'm going to go buy crits.

138
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,399
I'm going to go buy crits.

139
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,399
Another one.

140
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,339
He's got medics though.

141
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:22,339
Alright, do not crits me.

142
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,410
Do not crits me.

143
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,410
Crits somebody else.

144
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,410
Do not crits me.

145
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,589
Oh, I've been knocked away.

146
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:28,589
Shit.

147
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:32,259
We did it.

148
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:35,290
We just did it.

149
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,290
Oh, we did it.

150
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,290
Yes.

151
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,290
Yes.

152
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,290
Yes.

153
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,290
Yes.

154
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,290
It only took us like three fucking hours.

155
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:51,949
Oh, anybody get anything good?

156
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:52,949
No.

157
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:54,319
No.

158
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:04,870
Oh, that was one of the most intense things I've ever done in gaming.
