1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,890
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with the Q&A video, the answers portion of the Q&A video.

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,890
And this is gonna be over some Smite gameplay. This is a 10-3 with the character Zeus.

3
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,890
If you don't know what Smite is, there's gonna be a link in the description to a Smite video that I made a long time ago.

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,060
But if you have no idea what's going on, you can watch that either before this video or after this video, during this video.

5
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,060
Whenever you watch that video, that is when you can kind of understand the basics of this game.

6
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,060
But I'm gonna let that sit in the background. We are gonna start talking about the questions now.

7
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:47,060
And the first one I'm gonna answer is something that I've been asked a lot and I haven't really addressed it in a long time.

8
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:53,060
And I'm going to right now. It is what do I do for work? What is my job? What do I do? How do I make money?

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:01:00,060
And that sort of question. So I'm gonna start off, first of all, this answer has changed over the last year and a half or so.

10
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,060
It started out as me doing freelance videography work. I did weddings. I did events.

11
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,060
Like, I was the guy that filmed your sister's wedding. Like, I was that guy.

12
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,239
But now, YouTube has kind of turned into a full-time gig for me.

13
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,239
Now, I need to really say this because there's a lot of misconceptions with the amount of money that people make on YouTube.

14
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,239
There are probably a lot of you guys that think I make a ton of money doing this and I'm just like swimming in money.

15
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,239
I've got like millions of... No, no, no, no, no. I don't make very much money at all from YouTube.

16
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,239
In fact, I would probably guess that most of you guys that have jobs probably make more money than I do.

17
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:41,239
But I'm not gonna get into that because I can't talk about money. It's against contract. It breaches all kinds of things.

18
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:46,239
So I don't want to get into any trouble. But I will say that YouTube has become a full-time thing for me.

19
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:52,239
And while I have another couple seconds here, another minute or so, I'm gonna blow the covers off of one more misconception

20
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:59,480
that a lot of people have with people that have a YouTube partnership or people that make ad revenue money off of YouTube.

21
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:05,480
If you like a video or favorite a video of somebody that has a partner channel, you're not making them any money.

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,479
That doesn't do anything like that for them. A lot of people think that.

23
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,479
A lot of people think that if they click the like button or favorite button on somebody with a partnership,

24
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,479
they're gonna give them more money. And that's just not the case.

25
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:18,479
What actually does happen when you like or favorite a video, if you don't know,

26
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,479
the reason why people want likes and people want favorites so much is because it spreads your content around.

27
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,479
It lets other people know that the channel exists, which is really, really important if you're trying to grow a channel, obviously.

28
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,479
You want more people to see it. The more people that see it, the more potential people will subscribe

29
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,479
and the more people will be around to watch your videos.

30
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:39,479
And you gotta remember, you guys have a lot of power on this website.

31
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,479
Never take for granted the power that you hold on YouTube.

32
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,479
People might try to make it seem like you're not that big of a deal,

33
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:53,479
but you are a huge deal. You are a massive deal to the success of every single channel on this website.

34
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:59,719
Every single one. If you watch YouTube videos, even the view, even if you hate a video,

35
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,719
even if you dislike a video or you like a video, whatever you're doing,

36
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,719
you're part of this collective community that keeps this website going strong.

37
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,719
I'm not gonna get into that anymore. I will probably talk about this on a completely different video,

38
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,719
but I want to move on now and get into another question, because it's been question one,

39
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,719
and it's been like three minutes. So we're gonna move on now. Yes, I do YouTube for work.

40
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,719
It's what I do to try to make myself stay alive.

41
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,219
So this next question is a very, very good one. I got this a lot as well.

42
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:31,219
It is, what is my opinion on Valve's Steam box?

43
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:35,219
Now, if you don't know, Valve is going to get into the hardware game here.

44
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,219
They're coming out with a console. I don't even think you can call this a console.

45
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:44,219
They're coming out with a condensed PC. It's gonna run on Linux. It's not gonna run on Windows.

46
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:49,219
And it's going to be something you hook up to your TV, kind of like a mini gaming PC, I guess you could call it.

47
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:55,219
I really don't know the details of this, but if you want my opinions on it, I think it's amazing.

48
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,219
I love Valve. I think Valve is an incredible company. I think this thing is going to be fantastic.

49
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:04,219
It's gonna make the people, because PC gaming has kind of this in-between period,

50
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:09,219
where if you don't have a lot of money, it's hard to get the most out of PC gaming.

51
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:16,389
If you can't spend, like, at least $500, $600, $700, you're not gonna get, like, a good gaming PC.

52
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:21,389
Now, some people might be able to throw a PC together for $325 and have it run.

53
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:24,389
Crisis at low settings or something like that.

54
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:32,389
But I'm talking about the real genuine PC gaming experience, where you have, like, a 24, 25, 27-inch monitor

55
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,389
running your game at a sick graphics card, 1080p, with all the settings up.

56
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,389
You really cannot hold a candle to that if you spend, like, $300 or $400 on a gaming PC,

57
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:45,389
but this SteamBox that's coming out could solve a lot of those problems.

58
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,389
It could make PC gaming completely viable to a bigger, broader mainstream market,

59
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,389
which is awesome because that means there's gonna be more development into PC gaming.

60
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:00,629
There's gonna be more eyeballs on PC gaming. We're not gonna be in that minority, really, anymore.

61
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,629
Well, I think, guys, it depends on how well the SteamBox does when it gets to retail.

62
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:07,629
If it ever does, it's still kind of in the development stage.

63
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:09,629
But it's gonna be really interesting to see where that goes.

64
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:12,629
I cannot wait to see all the crazy things that happen with that.

65
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:17,629
They're gonna take over. Valve is gonna take over the gaming market, and it's gonna be fantastic

66
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:21,629
because they are probably my favorite company, at least in gaming, of all time.

67
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,870
So we'll end on that. We're gonna move on to the next question.

68
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:31,180
The next question is by a guy named Erland. Erland D. Erland, maybe, but I'm not sure.

69
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,180
It's about Otto. I'm gonna go over a couple questions on Otto.

70
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,180
Otto is my little dog, if you don't know. And he does big adventures.

71
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,180
He has two big adventures, if you didn't know about those crazy movies.

72
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,180
But whatever, we're gonna get going here.

73
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,180
If, for some reason, I had to change Otto's name, what would I change it to?

74
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,670
That's pretty easy because my family was talking about this when we got the dog.

75
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:56,670
If it wasn't gonna be Otto, it was going to be Bandit, like a little bandit, or Pickles.

76
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,410
Little Pickles. I actually really like that name. Oh, look, it's Little Pickles.

77
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,410
But we stuck with Otto, and I like the name Otto because it's a very quick name.

78
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,410
It's a very short, two-syllable dog name.

79
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,410
I've met people before that have dogs with, like, a six-syllable name.

80
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,410
Oh, look, it's Mr. Wigglesonworth. How the hell do you call that dog?

81
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,410
Oh, come in, Mr. Wigglesonworth. Just call him Wigman.

82
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,649
Oh, like Wiggles or something. I don't know.

83
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:25,649
And follow-up to this, got this question a lot, too, is what breed is Otto?

84
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:28,649
Is he a dachshund? Is he a pincher, a mini-pincher?

85
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:32,889
What we think he is, and this is after research with his traits,

86
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:35,889
how he looks, how his body is, his body type, everything like that,

87
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:40,889
because with a rescue, because he is a rescue, it's hard to tell exactly what they are.

88
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,889
And those blood test DNA things that you can order from online or you send it into somewhere,

89
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,889
they're not always 100% accurate.

90
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:52,889
So what we think he is is a Chihuahua dachshund. We think he's a Chowinny.

91
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,889
He might have some beagle in him, maybe some pincher, we don't know,

92
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,889
but he has all the Chihuahua traits. He's got the curly, cute tail.

93
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:01,889
He's got the big head, big eyes.

94
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,889
And if you look up a Chowinny and you look at this dog face-to-face, back-to-back,

95
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,889
they look identical. So Chowinny, that's what we think he is.

96
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,579
So the next question is from A.E. Samuel, and he or she asks,

97
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:16,579
who is my favorite film director?

98
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:19,579
And they ask that because they're currently in film school.

99
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:22,579
They're learning communication and videography and stuff like that,

100
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:23,579
which is really cool. That's what I did.

101
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:25,579
So if you're doing that, cool, two thumbs up for you.

102
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,579
But my favorite film director is Christopher Nolan,

103
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:32,579
and most notably because not really the Batman movies,

104
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,579
but the stuff that he did before the Batman movies.

105
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,579
Don't get me wrong, I love the Batman movies.

106
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:40,579
The Dark Knight, Dark Knight Rises, Batman Begins.

107
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:42,819
They're fantastic films.

108
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,819
But before that, he made something specifically called Memento.

109
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:51,819
If you've never seen Memento, you go right now and Netflix the hell out of this movie right now.

110
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:52,819
Is it on Netflix? I hope it is.

111
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,819
Go watch it. It's one of the most mind freak movies I've ever seen in my life.

112
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,819
You have to watch it a couple of times, but it's the reason why I got into Christopher Nolan.

113
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,819
And another one of his movies that's really insane is Inception.

114
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,819
But we all know that. A lot of us have already seen Inception.

115
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:10,819
I still haven't even figured out what the hell is going on with that movie.

116
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:16,819
I've watched that movie three times now, and I think I get it, but I don't get it. Inception, baby.

117
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:20,629
But yeah, Christopher Nolan is my favorite film director.

118
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:22,629
So this next question was asked by a lot of people as well.

119
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,629
It is, where is Grandpa's face? Where's the face cam video?

120
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,629
Where is that freaking video?

121
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:31,629
And I already touched upon this in a video last week, but I'm going to touch upon it again.

122
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:35,629
Grandpa's face cam video is coming, but I want to make sure it's done right.

123
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:37,629
I want it to be a really, really big production movie.

124
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:41,629
I don't want it to be just a sloppy video where I throw it together and oh, there it is.

125
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:46,809
I'd rather do it the way that it should be done and the way that Grandpa would be proud of.

126
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:50,809
So it is coming. Don't worry. Just you're going to have to wait a little longer.

127
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:53,809
I don't know the exact time frame, but it is going to be soon.

128
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:55,809
I promise you that.

129
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:59,559
So the next question is, can you play an instrument?

130
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:02,740
And if so, can you do it on the video?

131
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,409
Well, let's see.

132
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:28,529
No, I cannot play a musical instrument, as you can see by that little clip there.

133
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,529
I've always wanted to though.

134
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:34,529
One of the instruments I've always wanted to play was either the guitar or the drums.

135
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:37,529
But I could never, it never really came to fruition.

136
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:38,529
I just am not that good at that.

137
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:44,529
I can't do the hand-eye coordination required to play the drums and my brain is like swish cheese.

138
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:49,529
So I can't like make my fingers go in the right spot when I'm playing the guitar.

139
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:53,529
I've tried both though, but both things, it just was not for me.

140
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:54,529
I could not do it.

141
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,700
But after trying a couple of times and trying to learn how to play an instrument,

142
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,700
I have such respect for people that can play instruments because knowing how difficult it is

143
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,700
and how much practice it requires, it's just my hat's off to you.

144
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,700
If you can play an instrument, hell yeah, that's awesome because I cannot do it.

145
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,460
So the final question for this particular Q&A is going to be from Chakra Cannon 97.

146
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:20,460
And they ask, would I ever discuss my political views or social issues

147
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,460
or things that are considered of higher importance?

148
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,700
And the real answer to this one, guys, is probably not.

149
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,700
I want to separate my social issue, my beliefs and my political beliefs away from this channel

150
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,059
because what you do when, let's just talk about politics for a second.

151
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:41,059
If I were to say I root for a certain political party, the other half, the other parties,

152
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:45,059
whether it's Republican, Democrat, Independent, whatever you consider yourself as,

153
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:49,059
at least in the United States, you're going to see me in a more negative light.

154
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:53,059
And I don't want to bring politics into a channel that's around fun

155
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,059
and just hanging out and having a good time.

156
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:59,059
I don't want to be like, well, you know, let's talk about abortion and gay rights.

157
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,059
And I really don't want to bring that into the discussion here.

158
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:05,059
I would rather keep it very neutral and just kind of have fun.

159
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:11,429
And that's the same reason why I don't do videos on news stories or drama in the community.

160
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:13,429
Like, I really just don't care.

161
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:19,429
I like to stay as far away from that as possible because this channel was never really designed that way.

162
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:23,429
It's always been about just gameplay, fun, funny moments, funny things.

163
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:28,429
It's never been the rant channel where I talk about like this asshole in the community.

164
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,429
No, it's never really been like that.

165
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:33,179
So I don't know why I would change it now.

166
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,179
But that is going to wrap up this Q&A, guys.

167
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:37,179
Thank you all so much for your questions.

168
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:42,179
The way I'm going to do future Q&A videos is ask another question in this video

169
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:45,179
down there in the comments section to prevent me from having to do another video

170
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:47,179
where I ask you to do questions.

171
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:49,179
We'll just kind of pile them on top of each other.

172
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:53,360
So each Q&A video I do just shlops you more questions down in the bottom there.

173
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
So thank you guys again for watching.

174
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
I really do appreciate it.

175
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
And I'll see you all next time.

176
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
And of course, take care, everybody.
