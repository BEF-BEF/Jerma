00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:17,760
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Demoman and the Spy.

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:29,000
Two back-to-back clips here, not two full gameplays. Well, the gameplay at the end, the Spy gameplay, actually does finish, and I get on the top of the scoreboard, but that is regardless of the point.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The main purpose of this video is to talk about something that I've never done before, and it's something I want to get your guys' opinion on.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And it's about Thanksgiving, and first and foremost, I want to say Happy Thanksgiving to everybody. It is currently 7.30pm here Eastern Time.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,369
So it might, may or may not be Thanksgiving where you are when you're watching this video, but regardless, Happy Thanksgiving.

6
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:59,369
And this video is going to be about Thanksgiving, specifically a type of turkey that I've never had before, and my family is doing it this year.

7
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:09,370
And I want to get your guys' thoughts on this, and some of you guys might have some tips and some, like, epic MLG strats on how to do this, but we are taking the necessary precautions we are gonna do this.

8
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:18,609
We are deep-frying a turkey. That's right, we are dropping a turkey in a vat of hot boiling oil, and then we're gonna eat the son of a bitch.

9
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:27,609
And I don't know how it's gonna turn out, I don't know if it's gonna be good or not, how delicious it's gonna be, but I've heard from many people that it is the best way to cook a turkey.

10
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:36,980
Now, I've had turkey a lot of different ways. I've had turkey brined and cooked for hours, I've had turkey wrapped in a chicken, I've had a turducken.

11
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:43,980
I've tried a lot of different variations, a lot of different seasonings, a lot of different culinary ways to do it, but never this one.

12
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:54,980
And the reason why it's so scary, and the reason why I'm asking you guys for tips and tricks, is because you always hear of some story of some dude dropping a turkey in a vat of oil and his face exploding.

13
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,980
Or something really bad happens, like the house lights on fire or something like that. So it can be quite dangerous.

14
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:07,980
So if you're doing it this year, and if you've never done it before, or if you do it every year, I'd like to know your rituals or something you plan on doing with it.

15
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:14,979
Do you hold hands and then spin around five times and then put the turkey in the oil, or do you just drop the thing in there and just pray?

16
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:17,979
What's the best way to go about doing this?

17
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:24,979
Now, I know there's electric fryers and then just a haphazard pot with a bunch of oil in it.

18
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,979
Now, I'm not exactly sure which one we're going to be doing, but we're probably going to be doing the electric fryer.

19
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:36,979
Now, if somebody is objecting to that in the comments section and they say, no, no, no, no, no, oh my god, Jerma, you can't do it in the electric fryer.

20
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:41,979
You've got to do it with at least two fat guys present. There's got to be two fat guys.

21
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:45,979
And you have to do it outside with no shirt on. And that's the only way you can do it.

22
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:49,979
But there's got to be a pot that is made out of gold and then you like dump in the pot.

23
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:55,979
I don't even know what. Well, any of these things you guys can tell me that could make the process a little bit easier.

24
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:01,979
I would love to relay that information to the proper authorities and the authorities being my family, my parents.

25
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,979
So there you go, because I'm not cooking this thing. I would be too terrified to do that.

26
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:10,599
So if you're wondering if it's going to be good or not, you can stay updated with my Twitter.

27
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:14,599
I'm probably going to be live tweeting my first bite of this turkey.

28
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,599
So you will know if you're following me whether or not it was worth it.

29
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,030
So that kind of brings me to the second point of this video. Very, very briefly, I'll talk about it.

30
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:32,030
It is changing the norms of holiday dinners and changing the norms of very, very iconic classic dinners in general.

31
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:40,210
Now, whenever you think of Thanksgiving, I think of that golden brown turkey sitting on a plate of like mashed potatoes and gravy.

32
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:46,210
And somebody's carving off beautiful pieces of white meat and it's so delicious and delectable.

33
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,210
And that's that's what everybody thinks about when they think Thanksgiving, at least here in America.

34
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,210
I'm not sure what some of the iconic dinners are overseas and in different countries.

35
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:01,210
But Thanksgiving American dinner, that is like the image that pops up in every advertisement and in everybody's head is that image.

36
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:06,509
But that image is starting to change. There's people doing weird things with their turkeys.

37
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:09,509
There's people that don't even eat turkey at all on Thanksgiving.

38
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:14,509
They have something totally different like a ham or sausages or anything like that.

39
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,509
And that's really, really interesting to me.

40
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:27,509
So follow up question in the comment section is, is your family one of those families that has kind of done away with the Thanksgiving turkey and brought in something else different that you never really had before?

41
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:33,509
I'd love to hear about it. And again, if you're from a different country, I'd love to hear about your classic holiday meals or something.

42
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:36,509
Maybe a twist on your classic holiday meal you have over there.

43
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:41,509
And that's going to wrap up the video. So again, guys, have a very happy and very safe Thanksgiving.

44
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:45,509
And hopefully I don't bought my house with this deep fryer.

45
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,509
I don't know how crazy this is going to be or not, but I will let you guys know via Twitter.

46
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,509
And that's going to wrap it up here, guys.

47
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:54,509
So I'll see you guys all soon. And of course, take care, everybody.
