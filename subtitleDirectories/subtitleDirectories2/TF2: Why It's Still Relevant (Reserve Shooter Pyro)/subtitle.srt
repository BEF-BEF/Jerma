00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,870
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Pyro.

2
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,870
And before I get started, I do have to apologize. I am getting a little bit of a cold.

3
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,870
Because I went to Burger Boy's house, and Burger Boy of course has a cold.

4
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,870
And I'm gonna get it, so I'm getting a stuffy nose now. I'm getting a little bit of a head cold.

5
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,049
But you know, I had this topic in my head, and I wanted to go over it a little bit.

6
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:39,049
But I wanted to talk about it with you guys, because I find it to be very, very important.

7
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:44,420
And it has to do with why has Team Fortress lasted this long?

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:51,590
And when I say this long, I'm really talking about why has the community stayed for this long?

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:57,829
Why have we been playing this game for over five years? At least for me, I've been playing this game for over five years.

10
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:02,829
I started back in Team Fortress Classic, as a lot of you guys know, and I've been playing this game ever since.

11
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,829
I've never got that urge to stop playing. Sure, I've taken a couple breaks here and there.

12
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,829
I've taken one or two breaks, maybe one or two months. I don't feel like playing it, whatever.

13
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:14,829
I'll wait for some updates. But I always come back.

14
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:20,069
There's never been a time when I haven't played this game between two or three months.

15
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:26,069
And it was actually during this gameplay, right here, that I had this epiphany, I guess you could call it.

16
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:32,109
My brain was kind of just telling me, Jeremy, why are you still playing this game?

17
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:37,109
It's been five years, and you're still having this much fun playing this game?

18
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:43,290
Because I love this game. This is one of my favorite games, probably my number one favorite game of all time.

19
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,290
And it's really slugged its way up there. It never was like that.

20
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:54,590
This game was probably two or three on the list. But it's made its way up to number one, and I'm trying to think why.

21
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,769
And the answer is very, very simple. And I thought about this for a while, but it's very, very simple.

22
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:03,140
What to do with developer attention.

23
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,140
Now, I'm going to bring up a couple of different companies here and a couple of different game franchises.

24
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,139
This is not meant to hate on anyone. I love these games as well. I play these games all the time.

25
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:19,139
So don't worry, this is not me saying, well, this game sucks. No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying.

26
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,979
But anyways, take a look at Call of Duty or Battlefield 3.

27
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,979
There are recent iterations. I'm not talking about the franchises in general.

28
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:33,289
So they get content updates, they get patches, bug fixes, all that kind of stuff all the time.

29
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:38,289
The main problem with those updates are, there's a couple of things that I think are wrong with the industry right now,

30
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:44,289
but mostly those content updates are usually not free, at least for Call of Duty.

31
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,590
And they're not really that much of a change. They're adding maybe some maps.

32
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,590
They're buffing or nerfing a gun or something like that.

33
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,590
The changes that they make are not that drastic and they're not that forward-moving.

34
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:06,259
You go to Team Fortress, though, almost all of Team Fortress's big updates are massive, massive game-changing updates.

35
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:09,259
And that's why people keep coming back. That's why I keep playing.

36
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:16,259
That's why I keep my butt sitting in the chair, because I know they're going to add something crazy for the soldier.

37
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,259
They're going to add something insane. Look at the Pyro, the Phlogistinator.

38
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:21,259
The Phlogistinator, nobody really saw that coming.

39
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:25,259
And they keep trying to change the game and they keep listening to the community.

40
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:30,500
And the reason why this all came up when I was playing Pyro is very, very important.

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:37,300
The Pyro back in 2007 is wildly different than the Pyro now.

42
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,300
They didn't even have a compression blast.

43
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,300
The compression blast was added into the game in an update.

44
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,479
So you got to remember, the Pyro, before the compression blast, you were an ambusher.

45
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:53,479
You kind of hid behind corners, you WM1'd into people, and you only had a default shotgun.

46
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,479
And you couldn't blow anybody away, pull the shotgun out like we do now, and shoot people.

47
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,479
That's not how it used to work. You just used to run down a hallway holding down the mouse button.

48
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,659
Now look at what you can do as the Pyro now.

49
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:09,659
There are so many fun, incredible options to play with.

50
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,659
There's the flare gun. There's the reserve shooter, which I'm using right now.

51
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:18,660
There's the detonator, or you could just use the default shotgun, and they keep adding more stuff.

52
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,660
And there's the man melter. There's all kinds of stuff.

53
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,829
And I think that's why the game has lasted so long.

54
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:29,829
That is why this game is still one of the best. That's still why everybody keeps playing it.

55
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:36,069
They just have so much attention to their franchises, and they really care about what's going into their games.

56
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:41,069
And that's not to say that Dyson, you know, Infinity Ward and Treyarch, they don't put a lot of time into their games.

57
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,069
That's not what I'm saying. Of course they do.

58
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:47,069
All these game developers, they put blood, sweat, and tears into all their products.

59
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:52,069
But it's just the way that Valve goes about doing business that I seem to really, really love.

60
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:59,699
And what you're watching right now, by the way, is you watched a spy clip, a little bonus clip, of just a sequence of ridiculous events.

61
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,699
I couldn't even believe that all happened.

62
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:05,189
But I wanted to add that because, of course, the Pyro game was a little short.

63
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:09,189
So thank you all so much for watching. This is going to wrap up the video.

64
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:12,189
And keep the discussion going in the comments section, guys.

65
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:15,189
Let me know what you got to say about all this.

66
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,189
I would love to jump in and chime in on some of the comments as well.

67
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:19,189
So let me know what you think.

68
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:24,189
And, of course, Happy Mother's Day to all you mothers, or all of your mothers.

69
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,189
I think I phrased that right.

70
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:29,189
But yeah, Happy Mother's Day, everybody. I'm a day late, but it's okay.

71
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:31,689
At least it's the thought that counts.

72
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:33,689
So yeah, take it easy, guys. Black screen, I got to get out of here.

73
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:35,689
So I'll see you guys all next time.

74
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:39,170
And take care, everybody.
