1
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:08,380
Alright. Are you ready to be introduced?

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,179
Yeah, I'm here. Do the drumroll first for me.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,910
I want a drumroll. Hey! What is going on, buddy?

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,309
No, see, that's you introducing yourself. Only I want the drumroll.

5
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:29,289
Okay. Star! Hey, what's going on guys? Welcome to...

6
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:32,649
This is Lethal League, as you probably could tell. We're gonna do

7
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:37,109
round two on Lethal League, as both of us have had a chance to figure out how to play this

8
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:37,890
video game.

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,450
You haven't played this game. Yes, I have. Since the last video.

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,700
We played it in the hotel at PAX. You played like two games.

11
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,780
How do you know that I haven't been sitting around

12
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,640
practicing? Well, do you have the extra super skins?

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,159
What's that? Oh, he does!

14
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:06,140
Play ball. Play raw. Get destroyed.

15
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:11,180
Oh, I might have increased the ball speed, by the way. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

16
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,819
What did you do? I increased the ball speed. Why did you do that?

17
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:17,739
Well, I'm not used to this increased ball speed.

18
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:22,700
I've never played like this. It's alright.

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,739
You think you could stop me? You can't stop anybody.

20
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,409
Yeah, well, you told me about the balls and how am I supposed to know?

21
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:38,489
This is going a lot better than the last time we played.

22
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,769
Yeah, this really... says the guy that increases ball speed.

23
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,930
Puts his balls in my face.

24
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:54,349
I was going to warn you, I guess.

25
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:58,629
There we go. You don't get away from this.

26
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:02,469
Shit! I tried to jump on you. I just got an achievement for that one.

27
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:06,349
Okay, well, I didn't. What are you doing? I was trying to

28
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:11,139
launch it back at you. Did you get an achievement for that one?

29
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,449
That thing's going to be so late.

30
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:19,990
You never know where I'm going. You've got to be shitting me.

31
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,819
You know what's really freaking me out? It's the fact that I'm blue.

32
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:30,909
There we go. You don't like being blue?

33
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:35,979
You're not going to catch this one. Wow, I didn't. My face, maybe.

34
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:38,819
Well, I'm still ahead. Sorry, not for long.

35
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,740
I guarantee you, I bet you $50 billion on this net.

36
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,580
No, I was talking. I bet you $50 billion you get hit by this.

37
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,719
Are you ready? Are you willing to make that bet?

38
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:56,189
Yes. I meant, like, right now...

39
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:02,699
50 billion! 50 billion! You can't just change the parameters.

40
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:07,800
That was a good warm-up.

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Can you make that color adjustment in your brain?

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,680
I'm trying to make the adjustment in my brain.

43
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,250
But it's okay, because I'm playing the Candyman.

44
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,270
You're not going to fool me with that.

45
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,949
You ain't going to fool me. For some reason, just completely blanked.

46
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:33,830
What's going on? My controller just fucking broke.

47
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,229
Oh, yes! We're going to do that again?

48
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:43,520
We're going to try to do that again. We're going to try to do that again.

49
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,430
Oh, he doesn't know when I'm going to hit it.

50
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:52,960
You've got it way down there. This is where it's going to get interesting.

51
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,449
It's going to get really interesting here. No, you're just going to get hit.

52
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:04,780
Izzy! What the fuck happened to me?

53
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,379
I swear, it's going to get really interesting.

54
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,860
Oh, it is going to get interesting. I did, yeah.

55
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,419
Okay, well, now I've got to put my pants on.

56
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,779
You're not wearing pants right now? No.

57
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,480
Well, that's interesting, I guess.

58
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,160
You know, I will just keep hitting this, and...

59
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:30,970
You're hitting it just slightly over my head.

60
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,649
And it's messing everything up.

61
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:40,680
Well, why don't you try to handle this situation, you motherfucker?

62
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,029
You're too tall. Hey, I do have a height advantage, but it's not a big deal.

63
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:52,430
You ready for this massive comeback? You're not going to get a massive comeback.

64
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,199
What you are going to get is you're going to get...

65
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,439
You're going to... I was talking to you.

66
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,149
Well, you should have been playing. All right. Come here.

67
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:04,399
Come here. Come over here.

68
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,379
Mmm. Why would I do that?

69
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:13,720
I win! So, what is at stake right here?

70
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,939
What are you putting at stake? Don't hit the ball.

71
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:26,319
Don't touch that ball. I will hand cook, like personal chef make you dinner.

72
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,399
All right. I will come over and cook you a delicious meal.

73
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,759
Now, I'm going to come to your apartment.

74
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,600
I want you to make me dinner at your place.

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,680
Okay. And it's got to be good.

76
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,040
You thought you could really do that? Did you really think you were going to do that?

77
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,800
I think you knew that I was going to do that.

78
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,480
So, what happens if you win while I let you just fucking farm your special?

79
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,959
That sounds like a great idea.

80
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,079
Well, if I win, I don't know. You need to make something up.

81
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,000
All right. If you win... I think we're even now.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,040
If you win, then I will write you a personal song.

83
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,560
Like with like instruments, it'll be like a legitimate like why Star is like so cool song.

84
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,959
Yeah. You okay?

85
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,439
Yeah, I'm down with that. All right.

86
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,680
Whoever wins this, this is the champion. This is the champion championship.

87
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,079
Let's go. I think you're getting a song out of me.

88
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,720
You're very sorely mistaken here.

89
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,600
Whoa, how did you hit that?

90
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:29,180
Tall. Totally. God. What?

91
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,660
It's those tall hits that are up above my head. You don't understand.

92
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:40,379
Damn it. I was trying to bounce it up, bounce it around.

93
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,899
No, you bounce it back down to Charlie Town.

94
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:47,360
This is the one. This is the one for me.

95
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,069
Why? Oh, god damn it.

96
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:58,430
Oh, I'm going to get that personal ballad by my little bar to Jeremy.

97
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,110
You're not getting it.

98
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,430
I'm getting a delicious dinner of my choosing.

99
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,829
I want a bib with my name on it.

100
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,110
All right. I didn't promise any bibs.

101
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,220
Time to sit up.

102
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,939
You see which way it's going? Do you see where it's going?

103
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,540
You're going to have a little. Why did I jump into it?

104
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,699
I don't know. What kind of decision making am I doing here?

105
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,240
That was a bad decision.

106
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,319
No, I didn't want to do that.

107
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,930
OK, I did want to do that, though.

108
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,449
OK, that was all right.

109
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:40,939
Why? Yes. What kind of again, the decision making here?

110
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,139
What do I want for dinner? Let's think.

111
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:48,129
Do I want am I going to want like am I going to want like onions in this meal?

112
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,370
Do you want some frogs?

113
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,970
What do you even like know how to cook, by the way?

114
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,089
Are you knocking like maybe like microwave, like macaroni and cheese or something?

115
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:58,129
Are you? No, I know how to cook.

116
00:07:58,129 --> 00:07:59,850
I hate that stupid bullshit.

117
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:06,870
You can go back to kindergarten with that that that pansy ass candy ass.

118
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,629
Oh, well, this is a pretty close game.

119
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,350
This is getting close.

120
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,829
This is getting close. I'm getting scared.

121
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:23,500
I mean to come on now that don't.

122
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,100
I freaked out for no reason.

123
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:35,519
I was you turn your freak.

124
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,299
Holy shit. This is bad.

125
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:41,539
Oh, my God. What am I supposed to do about this?

126
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,779
Holy shit.

127
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:51,139
No, I let you get it.

128
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,019
No, no, get away.

129
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:54,019
I don't know.

130
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:00,740
No, no, I'm getting that song.

131
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:11,710
No, I'm shutting up.

132
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,710
You get a fucking song.

133
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:22,299
He shines in the sky, that twinkle in my eye.

134
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:35,419
He gives me what a perfect guy at any point in time or history.

135
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:39,139
Once it's done, when we're done, stars the man.

136
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:41,659
He's so cool. He's so nice.

137
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:44,220
Everything about him is now strife.

138
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,620
Who's that flying in the sky?

139
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,220
Star on a motorcycle made for the sky.

140
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,659
There he goes, flying in front of your face.

141
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,379
Home on a journey to outer space.
