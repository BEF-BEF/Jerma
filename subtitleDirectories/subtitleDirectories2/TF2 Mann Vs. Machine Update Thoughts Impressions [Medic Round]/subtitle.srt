1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,500
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with the man vs. machine update for Team Fortress 2.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Now playing as the medic on the screen, I'm gonna get into some live commentary here in just a minute, but I do want to explain this mode,

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,500
because a lot of people still haven't been able to play this yet, and I know that when Last Night With Us came out,

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,740
it was very difficult to even get into a server, and we actually had to join a private match to even play the game.

5
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:39,740
So I do feel your pain if you were trying to play Last Night, because we all were trying to play, and it was just pure chaos.

6
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,740
Hopefully today, these servers are a little bit better, and that's... I'm assuming they will be.

7
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:50,179
So anyways, let's talk about the mode, and what I think about it, and how much fun it is, and all that jazz.

8
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:57,179
So first of all, guys, this is incredibly fun. If you can get like three, four, five, six of your friends,

9
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:03,179
or five of your friends actually, because it's six total, into a game, and get on Skype or get on Mumble or something,

10
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:08,180
you are going to have some of the most fun you could ever have when you load up Team Fortress 2.

11
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,180
Now that's a very bold statement, I know it is, but remember, this game is quite old now, guys,

12
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,180
and I'm happy to see that Valve is starting to try some really, really drastically new ideas.

13
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:27,349
And this is definitely a drastically new thing to Team Fortress, a wave co-op tower defense mode.

14
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:32,349
So it's very exciting, and what's also really exciting is modders, the future development of this game mode.

15
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:38,349
This could go in so many different directions, guys, and I just am giddy. I can't wait to see what's going to happen with all this.

16
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:48,090
So let's talk about the mode now. The very general basics of this game mode is kill robots, pick up money, upgrade your character.

17
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,090
That is the pretty much gist of the entire mode, but here's the real kicker,

18
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,260
and this is something that I didn't know when I first started playing, every single item in this game,

19
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:05,260
whether that be an unlockable, whether that be a stock item, everything has its own upgrade tree,

20
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:10,699
and I'm pretty certain on this that all the weapons fall into a certain template for upgrades.

21
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,699
So let's say you have a pistol versus a Mad Milk or a Jurati.

22
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:19,699
The Mad Milk and the Jurati will have the same available upgrades rather than the pistol.

23
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:25,699
So the amount of builds you can make are pretty much through the roof, especially because there's a character tree as well,

24
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:31,699
which does things like run speed, jump height, bullet damage resistance, fire damage resistance.

25
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:38,870
There's a lot to this. I am pleasantly surprised by this, guys, and although we did not get any new weapons,

26
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,870
all of the things you can unlock in this game mode with the Tour of Duty tickets, they are all cosmetic.

27
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,870
So we didn't get any new weapons, but still, it's an awesome update, and I'm sure they're working on stuff right now anyways, guys,

28
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,870
because they're always working on stuff, but I'm going to let the live commentary kick in now, guys,

29
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,870
playing with guys like Shibby, Boo, Italics, MLC Stealth, and John.

30
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,870
So enjoy the live commentary playing as the medic and go have fun with the update, everybody,

31
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,870
and I'll see you guys all soon, and of course, take care, everybody.

32
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,069
Oh, yeah, got them heels.

33
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:45,810
Yeah, you should always Italics before you before you charge in to grab like some money.

34
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,810
Just come back to me. I'll make sure to get you get like an overkill.

35
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,560
All right, sweet. Oh, wow. Oh, my God. It's got the bomb.

36
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,490
Oh, yeah, buddy, getting some head decapitations from the robots.

37
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:09,740
All right. Stealth. Oh, God. Oh, God. Just do it.

38
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,639
Smash people. Oh, they snuck down the stairs with the bomb.

39
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,639
I fall down. Shit, there's more, there's more, there's more.

40
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,170
Oh, my God. Heavy is dead.

41
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:31,009
I just screamed at that. Heavy is dead. All of them.

42
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:37,379
Wow, this is actually going pretty well. Still alive.

43
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,459
What if I get like attack speed with the Persian Persuader?

44
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:51,459
No, that'd be amazing. Last one alive. Lock that aura.

45
00:04:51,459 --> 00:05:01,790
Oh, geez, man. Come here. Heals.

46
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,790
I got to get the next thing I'm getting is it is healed, right?

47
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,269
Definitely. All right. We're almost done with wave two.

48
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:12,269
They're just coming across the bridges. They're coming on the right side.

49
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:14,269
They're all sneaking across the right side.

50
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:18,300
It's all right. We got to Chris here.

51
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Oh, there was one sneaky scout that almost got in there, but I killed him.

52
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,300
Heals. Heals. There we are. Nice mini centuries. There we go.

53
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,600
Excellent. Wow. Wow. I just get it from a little spittle.

54
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,779
I need health. Where is he? Where are they? They're all up there.

55
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:46,259
I took out the soldiers. I got a guy. I'm sorry. I'm not healing.

56
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,259
I just got to grab health. I'm going to lose this Uber.

57
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:54,459
They're all coming across the bridge. All right. Oh, shibby.

58
00:05:54,459 --> 00:06:01,589
Nah. Get him. All right, John. Here we go.

59
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:06,240
They come right bridge, right bridge. Got him. There it is.

60
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,420
Money, money, money. Turn around. Turn around.

61
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,060
I was just like, yeah. Money. See you.

62
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,430
We're not doing so hot on the money collecting.

63
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,529
Back when Boo was a scout, he was just running in there.

64
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:25,829
So scouts are actually very, very, very useful when it comes to money.

65
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:29,709
Particularly good with bunk if you want to get all the cash.

66
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:34,139
You don't want to run behind super pyros. Yeah.

67
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,769
I'm not going to use it right away.

68
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:42,019
I'm going to wait until we get the heavies to drop down because those are scarier.

69
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:46,860
So now. Oh yeah. Now we're talking.

70
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,209
Yeah, it's Alex. Yeah, buddy.

71
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:56,050
I'm going to do it when these guys drop right now. Yeah, right now.

72
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,050
Oh, they finally got me. And I fell off, but it's okay.

73
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,800
This guy's just trying to swing at me.

74
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,959
Get the money. Somebody get the money. I'll get it.

75
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,779
Oh, I sacrificed myself for the money.

76
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,779
No, I'm a spy. Spy's general.

77
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:18,279
No, D's not stay alive. Oh, wow. I was clear. I couldn't get it on you.

78
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,279
I'm going to die too.

79
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,279
Spy is me. Spy is me. I was clicking on you.

80
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,279
I don't know. I think what was happening is I was running into the bots.

81
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,279
Like I was hitting the bots with the beam. They were blocking you.

82
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,519
Oh my gosh. Heavy weapons guy. I'm falling back.

83
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:39,790
Give me a stealth. Taking out the heavy weapons.

84
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,029
Get rid of that.

85
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,720
Get down there and get the money. So much money.

86
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Where is it? Oh crap. Nice.

87
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:59,410
Ow, ow. This guy's got the bomb.

88
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,410
Spy's sapping sentries up there.

89
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,629
We're not going to be able to get all the money.

90
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:08,319
Scout, there's a bomb.

91
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,319
I fell down on them. Oh, they've got the bomb.

92
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:18,959
Oh God. I got it. Nice.

93
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:25,180
Should see how fast this SMG shoots.

94
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,449
Hacks. I'm just going to use it.

95
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:32,450
Just get rid of these guys so we can get our bearings.

96
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,450
There's two scouts left. Nice.

97
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:43,679
Excellent. No, give me a stealth.

98
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,679
So many scouts. Yeah, there really is so many.

99
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,679
I can only Wrangler with one sentry.

100
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,220
There's so many scouts.

101
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,220
Spy Boo, no.

102
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,220
Give her italics. Hey, heals.

103
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,220
There it is. Get the money.

104
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,850
Get the money. We don't see any money.

105
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,350
Sorry, we did alright. Oh boy.

106
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,350
Let me get this heal right even further.

107
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,720
One huge heavy with scout support.

108
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
You know what? You guys can all just get over it

109
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,019
because I readied first this round.

110
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,200
This uber charge rate is going to be ridiculous.

111
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,980
After I get this heal right.

112
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,980
Max overheal. I don't know what to do.

113
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,980
There's so much cool options.

114
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,750
They're spawning on the left side.

115
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,750
There's a whole bunch of them right up here.

116
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,750
Oh my God. Oh my God.

117
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,750
I think I should start the back.

118
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,820
I'm going to get that money up there.

119
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,580
That just startled the crap out of me.

120
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,139
I just used it.

121
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:53,820
Oh, John, you're going to get overwhelmed here.

122
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,450
I'm going to get the money.

123
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,220
I'm getting it. I'm getting it.

124
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,100
I'm getting the money. Oh God.

125
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Oh, snipers, snipers.

126
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
So many people.

127
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:13,500
I'm crushing as many as I can

128
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,149
before they can get through.

129
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:22,960
Hey, boys.

130
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,250
We've got to get that money.

131
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,809
Here they come.

132
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:32,240
I need ammo.

133
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
I've got a dispenser up here.

134
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
All right, get it.

135
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
No, that's cool.

136
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,940
Everyone's out of ammo.

137
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,940
I have a hack and slash machine.

138
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,299
Jeez.

139
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:53,299
Are we going to get this money that's over here?

140
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:55,299
They're up here.

141
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,299
I'm going to get the money at the beginning.

142
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:01,460
Got it.

143
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,460
They're shooting so fast.

144
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,460
Oh, come here.

145
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,759
Get the money.

146
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,149
Oh, sniper taking my sentry guns.

147
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:17,299
Oh, ow.

148
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:19,299
Stay alive.

149
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,299
I've got bullet resistance,

150
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:23,299
so I'm doing pretty good against the scouts.

151
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:27,009
And I can one-shot them now.

152
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:29,820
Which is the swing? Yep.

153
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,129
That's pretty beast.

154
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,129
Smoke them. The hard part is hitting them

155
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:37,009
because it's so fast.

156
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:39,009
Oh, my God.

157
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,009
That's so ridiculous. Are you shooting?

158
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:43,629
You're shooting like six bullets on top right.

159
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,629
Behind us.

160
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:47,629
The mini sentry just destroys

161
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:49,629
everything.

162
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:51,629
How many can you have? Two or three.

163
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:54,450
I'll get that last 20 right next to your boot.

164
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,450
Oh, I got it.

165
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,940
Oh, sorry.

166
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,940
Money.

167
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,940
I have my ammo count at 600.

168
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,940
And then I'm getting ammo on hits,

169
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,940
which they penetrate.

170
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,940
I can just keep shooting forever.

171
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,909
It's insane.

172
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:14,909
Let's see what I want to do here.

173
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:18,299
Definitely this.

174
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:20,299
Scouts, medics,

175
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,299
super tank.

176
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:24,299
Definitely doing a refill clip

177
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:26,299
and ammo. Oh, wow. That's a lot of scouts.

178
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:31,120
Hey, buds. Oh, my God.

179
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Get that money. Get that money.

180
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Oh, stall.

181
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Super heavy came down here.

182
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,620
He's not taking damage.

183
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,559
Yeah, they came down here.

184
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,940
Geez, Louise.

185
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,779
Oh, my God. Oh, my goodness.

186
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:52,529
Got him.

187
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:54,529
Oh, soldiers got him.

188
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:56,529
Scouts got behind.

189
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:59,470
Two, a couple of them.

190
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,419
Heals, please.

191
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:05,169
Where are you? There you are.

192
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:07,169
Oh, no.

193
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:10,940
Oh, my God. He killed me, too.

194
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,940
He's carrying the bomb.

195
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,210
Scouts and spawn.

196
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,220
Doing work on him. Got him.

197
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,100
Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him.

198
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,240
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

199
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,860
Just body block.

200
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,860
Now there's a tank, right? Tank's the last thing?

201
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:39,100
Oh, shit, yeah.

202
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,519
Stop that tank.

203
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,519
So much damage. I'm going to give you the crits.

204
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,519
I'm doing a hundred per hit.

205
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,519
And let's see how much damage you do now.

206
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,529
And...

207
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,529
Oh, that's nuking it.

208
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:57,659
Wow. Insane.

209
00:13:57,659 --> 00:13:59,659
Yeah, each of my swings was doing a hundred damage.

210
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,659
F.

211
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:04,669
We got an F.

212
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:06,980
There were so many scouts.
