1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:05,480
Oh jeez, I've got so much work to do. Oh, goodness gracious.

2
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:20,739
I don't want to talk to him right now. Hello? Yes, I'm aware that I owe the reports next Tuesday.

3
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:25,940
Yes, I don't care. I don't want to talk to you anymore. I'm a professional fucking businessman

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,289
and I don't care. Good day. There's my files.

5
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:47,189
Okay, it's time to be a total dickwad. If you don't know how to be a total dickwad on TwoFort,

6
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,350
I'll show you. So what you want to do is you want to disguise as a friendly sniper.

7
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:56,659
Go out here, make sure you have whatever sniper rifle they have out. Pull out the dead ringer

8
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:01,079
and just pretend like you've never played this fucking game ever before in your life.

9
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,489
I don't, hey, where, where do we start? Where's the spawn? I don't, I, uh.

10
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,209
And then you come back here, go on in your uh, into your resupply and do it again.

11
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:28,260
Hey, I don't know what time is it? I've never played. Mom? Mom, how did I, how do you play

12
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:38,459
Team Fortress 2? Oh shit, the gig is up. The jig is up. No, it's not. And there's a dispenser here.

13
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:48,519
I can make this even worse for this guy. You thought you killed me.

14
00:01:55,099 --> 00:02:06,680
What even just happened? Did I get backstabbed and then headshot immediately?

15
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:12,569
Or did I get double like headshot by like two or three different snipers? I have no idea what

16
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:22,650
just happened. You know, you got to mourn for these two gentlemen, two fort snipers. You got

17
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:30,439
to mourn for them. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the, wait, no, that's wedding.

18
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,800
That's a wedding ceremony. I'm supposed to be doing like a funeral. Well, that, I fucked up

19
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:41,270
that joke. Let's keep going. They have a century in our intel. Are you serious right now? Hold on,

20
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:50,219
I got to check this out. How did they get this down here? What, who let this happen?

21
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:59,849
There's a century in our intel. How the, how did this happen? Is it, there's an engineer,

22
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:06,870
there's a teleporter down here too? You got to be shitting me. All right. See, that's going down.

23
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,659
I ain't letting this guy get away with that. Sniper's a good job, mate. Sniper's a good job,

24
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:20,680
mate. Sniper's a good job, mate. Get those direct shots. What's up? I'll take the intel, baby.

25
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:31,289
Oh, uh, right. Uh, I'm on the blue team. The blue team doesn't pick up the blue intelligence.

26
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:40,729
Sometimes I wonder. It's going on. We're, we're just going to go harass the hell

27
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:50,180
out of these snipers over here. We're going to get a bunch of Zatoichi kills.

28
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:57,560
Good evening. My name is Jerma. I suck so bad. It's okay. I, what is there a cent, why is there

29
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:16,139
a century there? Here we go. See you. That can be only one. How did I get covered in Jirardi?

30
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:23,060
That's what I want to know. No, I forgot. I already forgot that that century gun was there.

31
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:40,819
God damn. Eight, six, seven, eight. I look at where I am.

32
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,160
I made it on top of this thing. Look at how cool it is.

33
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:55,860
If that guy headshot me, right? If I fucking forget about this century one more time,

34
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:03,100
I swear to God, I'm going to flip out. There's nothing here. There's a century right there.

35
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,199
You don't have to protect this. I didn't, how did I not, did I hit the damn century?

36
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,060
That was stupid. That was so stupid. I think it just gave me diarrhea and that wasn't a headshot

37
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:31,370
either. I will get this guy. Can't see. I can't see. Don't you guys know how two foot works?

38
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:38,779
You can't just like walk in a straight line on the balcony. Dude, that's not how it works.

39
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:45,000
Look at, what if these people are getting destroyed? I'm going to prove to you guys

40
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,240
why that's a bad idea. You ready? Like watch. See? Do people not understand? Just watch.

41
00:05:49,800 --> 00:06:04,180
Oh, hi. I'm going to walk this way on the two foot map. Ah, what do these do? All right,

42
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,050
before I go, I'm ending the video. Teleporter exit. Okay, cool. That makes sense.

43
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:19,259
Teleporter exit. Where are these entrances? Are they down here? Why? You're going to have to walk

44
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:26,139
anyways. If you go through that teleporter, you're going to have to walk at least some of them.

45
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:31,850
I don't understand. Somebody explain it to me. They don't even go down here.

46
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:43,300
Where do those teleporters go? What? All right, so let's go ahead and go over my loadout before

47
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,899
the video starts. We got the grenade launcher, the sticky bomb launcher, the half set Aichi,

48
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,579
the unusual, that's my patch, and the moomer smites.
