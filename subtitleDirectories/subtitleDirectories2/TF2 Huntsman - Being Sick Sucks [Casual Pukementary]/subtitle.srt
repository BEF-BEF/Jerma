00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:19,949
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jermaw here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as, I don't know, I'm really sick right now, I don't know what to do.

2
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,320
Uh, no, this is gonna be a pretty incoherent video because I am very ill right now, guys.

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:33,320
If you follow my Twitter, I made a tweet a couple days ago saying that I woke up as the sickest I've been in a long time.

4
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Probably to get into my voice, probably doesn't sound that different because it's not really like a cold.

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:47,689
It's more so like insta-puke, insta-diarrhea, like I'm sorry if you happen to be eating right now and I just ruined your meal, but it is what it is, you know?

6
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:55,689
And I wanna make this video just to give kind of an update that I've been under the weather for a couple days and I'm trying to get better.

7
00:00:55,689 --> 00:01:00,689
And my computer needs to be like made, like all this had to happen at the stupidest possible time.

8
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:07,859
And I wanted to get so much stuff done, there was a whole lot of things I wanted to do, a whole lot of videos I was planning to make that just can't be done now

9
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,859
because these last few days I've been pretty much a dead rat.

10
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:17,859
Like, you know when you pick up a dead rat by the tail and you're like, holy shit, this is a disgusting dead rat.

11
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:20,859
That's, you're holding me right now, like that's, I feel like a dead rat.

12
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:28,859
I was actually thinking about putting a picture on the screen of what I look like right now, but it's definitely not there because I probably watched this video back,

13
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,859
saw the picture and said, no, fuck, no, I'm not gonna put that up, that's horrible.

14
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:39,859
So it's probably not there, but point still stands guys, I feel like crap, I look like crap, it's just a crappy couple days.

15
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:47,299
I actually had to spend yesterday in the ER and not because I'm like really, really sick or something like that,

16
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:53,299
but because with the condition I already have, the disease I already have on top of this illness,

17
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:59,299
it's very hard for me to like take in fluids and stuff because it just comes right out immediately.

18
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:03,299
So, you know, you can put the pieces together with that if you need be.

19
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:10,300
But I had to get like an IV infusion of a couple different pain relievers and some saline, some fluids just because I couldn't keep anything down.

20
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,300
I couldn't keep anything in my body, which obviously is a bad thing.

21
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,300
So that's where I was yesterday.

22
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Are you sure that you don't want to get an IV shoved up your ass instead of setting up your new computer you just got?

23
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,300
An IV doesn't go in your ass, guys, it goes in your arm.

24
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
That was a joke.

25
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,789
But it really, this whole thing got me thinking.

26
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:30,789
This is kind of a whole topic on its own.

27
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,789
And chime in if you guys would like to in the comments section.

28
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:33,789
I'd love to hear it.

29
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:34,789
I'm going to burp.

30
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,099
Oh, no, I'm not going to burp.

31
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:39,550
Hold on.

32
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,550
Okay, so we're back.

33
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,789
Welcome back to the commentary.

34
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,789
Welcome back to the pukeumentary.

35
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,789
Is that the title of this video?

36
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:48,789
I don't know, maybe.

37
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:51,789
But anyways, okay, let's get real here for a second.

38
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:58,030
What I want to talk about in this video or the second half of this video is how getting sick,

39
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:04,770
and this wasn't something I really thought of until yesterday when I was in the midst of this whole horrible thing,

40
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:12,009
how scary is this goddamn world we live in where there's just like viruses just floating around?

41
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:14,009
Like I was lying in bed the other day thinking about this.

42
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,009
It's like, this is scary shit.

43
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:22,250
There's just illnesses and viruses just hanging out on like a stovetop for you to grab and like put your fingers in your mouth.

44
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,250
And congratulations, you now have diarrhea.

45
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,490
That's a scary thought.

46
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,110
And I know that seems a little ridiculous.

47
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,110
Oh, I'm going to go over to my friend Harold's house.

48
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,110
This is a nice new stove you got here.

49
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,110
Let me put my fingers in my fucking mouth.

50
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,110
Like people don't do that.

51
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,110
Well, maybe some of you do.

52
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,110
Some people might be like under the age of two.

53
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,110
Babies do that.

54
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,110
Babies grab things and go put their hands in.

55
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,110
You understand, right?

56
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:52,800
And I didn't even think about this, but there's a huge amount of people that bite their fingernails and bite their fingers, you know, on the sides there.

57
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
I used to do that all the time.

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
You don't want to get diarrhea.

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Don't do that anymore.

60
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,229
Look, the whole point of this video is you don't want diarrhea, right?

61
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:02,229
There's a checkbox.

62
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:03,229
There's two boxes.

63
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,229
One of them says diarrhea.

64
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:07,229
The other one says not diarrhea.

65
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:09,229
Which one of those boxes are you going to check?

66
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:11,659
I'm going to check the not diarrhea one.

67
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:20,100
I really don't want to wake up with like, you know, it's going to be a record for how many times I've said the word diarrhea in a video.

68
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,100
One thing before we go here, before this video wraps up, is Pedialyte, guys.

69
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:34,100
If you don't know what Pedialyte is, Pedialyte is this elixir, this masterful mana potion of the gods when you are sick.

70
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:42,459
If there's anything you take away from this video, besides me being like a complete psychopath that lasts like five straight minutes, it's to drink Pedialyte.

71
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:44,459
It's got a bunch of electrolytes.

72
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,459
It'll give you more energy.

73
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:49,459
It's got zinc to help speed up the recovery process of your illness.

74
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,459
It's just fantastic.

75
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,639
It is an absolute dream come true when you are sick.

76
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,639
It is Super Gatorade.

77
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,639
It is Ultra Powerade.

78
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,639
The one and only Pedialyte.

79
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,639
And with that, I'm going to wrap up this video, guys.

80
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,639
I'm going to get my computer squared away.

81
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,639
I'm going to get it all set up.

82
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,639
I got a lot of installation stuff to do in the next day or so.

83
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,639
Hopefully I can feel better and get that going.

84
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,639
But in the meantime, take care of yourselves.

85
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,639
I hope you guys have a great day, and I'll see you all next time.

86
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,259
And of course, take care, everybody.
