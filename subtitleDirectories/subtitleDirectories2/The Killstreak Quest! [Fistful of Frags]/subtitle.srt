1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:19,010
Howdy, partners. It's me, Jerma, here with a Fistful of Frags gameplay live compo.

2
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,010
I just was getting started.

3
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,570
Whiskey. Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, a whiskey, pass, a whiskey.

4
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:31,429
For the love of all that is sacred.

5
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:40,270
I want to go in like a at least five kill streak right now. Have to. Got to. It's mandatory. It's absolutely mandatory.

6
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,689
It is mandatory.

7
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,310
This guy's got two weapons. There we go. It's three.

8
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,310
Oh! Coming from behind.

9
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,070
Had a bullet on that.

10
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,070
Let me get that one more hit. Oh boy. Oh boy, I'm in trouble.

11
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,950
This is actually a good place to be.

12
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,829
I can sit in here and I can reload the gun.

13
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,829
Don't have to really worry about anyone coming through. There's some whiskey on the ground.

14
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:12,230
Dude, I don't want to be that drunk for this.

15
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,230
Because it sounds like there's a lot going on out here.

16
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,159
I've got to get to like at least five or six kills.

17
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,849
And this guy doesn't even know.

18
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,849
Oh, you don't even know.

19
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:31,099
Just creeping in the room like friggin' Slenderman.

20
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:34,489
I'm at four. Ready to bang.

21
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:36,489
Oh, that was close.

22
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:38,489
That was close. Show your face again.

23
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:40,489
Did I get him? Oh, I did get him.

24
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:42,489
This is five.

25
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:45,920
Oh boy, this is bad. This is bad.

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
This is real bad.

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,920
People around all over the place. I got to make this shot count. This shot has to count.

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
It counted. It counted. I got it.

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,920
It counted. Oh my god, that guy didn't even see me.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,159
How did that guy not see me?

31
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,590
I don't know. I'm not going to ask questions.

32
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,829
But I'm going to try to keep this going.

33
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,010
There it is.

34
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,500
Give me that gun. Give me this thing. No, I don't want this thing.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,740
I want to stay with the pistol. I want to stay tried and true with the pistol.

36
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,050
Try to get to ten.

37
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,050
No!

38
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:26,349
Must pay attention to your surroundings, son.

39
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:31,939
Pay attention to your surroundings.

40
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:35,500
Pay attention to your surroundings.

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,939
Let's go with the...

42
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:41,069
No. I'm going to try to do this.

43
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,870
It's very important.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,710
There is a dynamite behind me.

45
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,710
Guy throwing dynamite up top right there.

46
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,710
Seriously, you got to get out of my face.

47
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,219
Four.

48
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,219
The quest for the ten kill streak.

49
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:04,129
It is a quest indeed.

50
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:07,129
Especially on a free for all map.

51
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:11,430
It's difficult to do because people could be seriously all over you.

52
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,430
In every single direction.

53
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,949
Let's get out here in this room.

54
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:20,949
It's so scary because if you turn a corner and there's somebody just sitting there and they're ready before you're ready.

55
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:23,699
Sayonara.

56
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:25,699
You ain't going to make it.

57
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:26,699
Like that.

58
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,699
That's exactly what I was talking about.

59
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,969
What happened to my kill streak?

60
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:34,400
I don't even know what this is. I was on like four. Why does it say three?

61
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,659
Well, I don't believe that at all.

62
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:41,419
So I like lost pace.

63
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:43,419
Hopefully this is like at least eight.

64
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:44,419
I hope.

65
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:49,150
I don't know how many kills this is.

66
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,580
I've lost track. It's like seven or eight. I don't know, but I need ten.

67
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,580
Got to get to that ten.

68
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:59,949
All right. All right.

69
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:01,949
Just calm down. Calm down.

70
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,949
Calm down and whip a knife at this guy.

71
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:08,280
Oh, I'm in trouble.

72
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm in trouble.

73
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
This could be ten here.

74
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,650
Oh, no.

75
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,649
No, I was at nine.

76
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,360
I can clean this up.

77
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,970
I'm going to clean this shit up.

78
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,970
Somebody call Billy Mays.

79
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,970
Tell him to bring all of his oxy clean.

80
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,970
Because this place is a fucking mess.

81
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,269
It needs like a deep clean.

82
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:34,920
Hide, hide, hide from this guy.

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Holy shit.

84
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,920
What is happening?

85
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Shoot the guy next to you.

86
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,990
You dipshits.

87
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,990
What the fuck is going on in that room, dude?

88
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,990
Look at everybody's in this room.

89
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,990
Every single person was just in this room.

90
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,990
Why is so many people in here?

91
00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:01,329
Oh, I had to be quiet for that one.

92
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:06,079
There's no way I was going to do that one while opening my big mouth.

93
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,240
My big mouth.

94
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,600
If they go for a kick, just do the reverse kick.

95
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
God, the derringers are so scary.

96
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
I was so scared to use these things.

97
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
You get two shots at each side and if you miss, it's over.

98
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
You get four, but you know what I'm saying.

99
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,290
You understand.

100
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,060
You understand my stress.

101
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,439
I'm under a lot of stress with the derringers.

102
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,439
Was that three?

103
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,189
Was that three?

104
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:42,370
All right.

105
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,370
Cool.

106
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,589
Just leave me alone for a second.

107
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:49,899
I'm just trying to reload.

108
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,899
I'm just trying to reload for crying out loud.

109
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:53,899
Is that a grenade?

110
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:54,899
Oh, not a grenade.

111
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:55,899
A dynamite?

112
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,339
I don't know.

113
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:03,339
But we're going to one of the worst parts to go to because it's just out in the open.

114
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,339
I missed.

115
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:07,470
I missed again.

116
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,470
Okay.

117
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,470
Okay.

118
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,610
Chill.

119
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,610
Getting close here.

120
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,259
Seriously.

121
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,259
Fuck you, dude.

122
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:18,259
Where are the derringers?

123
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,819
I got to shoot.

124
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:22,269
I got to hit this.

125
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:24,269
Get that dynamite out of my face, bro.

126
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:26,829
Get it out of my face.

127
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm in so much trouble.

128
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Seriously, I need whiskey.

129
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Otherwise, there's no way I'm going to get to 10.

130
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,920
I don't even want to open that box.

131
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,610
I'm too timid right now to do anything besides just like chill.

132
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,129
Someone's going to hit me from afar.

133
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,129
It's going to happen.

134
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,129
It just is.

135
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,129
Accept your fate.

136
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,709
I'm freaking out.

137
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,459
I'm freaking out right now.

138
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,470
I'm freaking out.

139
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,980
Oh my God.

140
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,980
I killed him.

141
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,980
Give me the whiskey.

142
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,279
Come on.

143
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,420
I just like...

144
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,420
No.

145
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,420
I was at eight.

146
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,420
Fucker.

147
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
One more.

148
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
Come on.

149
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:17,930
That guy's got like two health.

150
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,680
I wasted three shots on that guy and I'm not even going to get the kill for it.

151
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Where am I?

152
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,879
I am.

153
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,879
Box crate is here.

154
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,120
Nobody around.

155
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,300
Give it to me quick.

156
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,050
Come on.

157
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,050
Before somebody comes in the room.

158
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,860
Pump shotgun.

159
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,810
Give it to me.

160
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,199
Let's get this done.

161
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,199
Let's get this 10 kill streak done.

162
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,199
What do you say?

163
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,779
What do you say?

164
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:44,779
Huh?

165
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,689
What do you say, mate?

166
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:48,689
Let's go.

167
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,120
What do you say?

168
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,180
I'm going to do it.

169
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,180
I'm going to do it right here.

170
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,269
I don't care where you come from, you snakes.

171
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:04,269
Just like a snake.

172
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:05,269
You got to get a couple kills and you got to jump away.

173
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:07,269
You got to take a way back to your home.

174
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:11,639
I would open this, but I don't want to because I want to be sure that I'm going to get this

175
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,639
streak.

176
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,839
Go back to my snake den.

177
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,740
And I see bodies.

178
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Fresh bodies.

179
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,740
Yep.

180
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
Fresh bodies.

181
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,740
Fresh bodies.

182
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,139
That's all right.

183
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,139
That's all right.

184
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,310
That's all right.

185
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,310
I had a little bit of a freak out moment there, guys.

186
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,490
A little bit of a freak out moment.

187
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,919
Because I'm real close to that big 1-0.

188
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,570
Give me that whiskey.

189
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,000
Give me that heavily, heavily.

190
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't think it matters.

191
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's not going to matter.

192
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I need to get a couple more kills here.

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,220
Oh, there's a guy.

194
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,220
There's a guy.

195
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,220
There it is.

196
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,870
I think I got it.

197
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,870
I have no idea, though.

198
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,870
I have absolutely no idea if I got it or not.

199
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,870
Is the kill streak quest over?

200
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,870
I hope so.

201
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,870
I hope so.

202
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,870
Because I really...

203
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,940
Let's get it to 15.

204
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
I did it.

205
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,019
I did it.

206
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,379
I got it.

207
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:02,820
I got it.

208
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,179
I got it.

209
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:05,179
I got it.

210
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,259
I got it.

211
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,259
I did it.

212
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:09,259
I did it.

213
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:10,259
I got it.

214
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,259
I got it.

215
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,559
I got it.

216
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,559
I got it.

217
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,990
Hands up.

218
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,990
I got it.

219
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,990
Ten.

220
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,990
Low left.

221
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,990
Kill streak quest is complete.

222
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,299
And that's going to wrap it up.

223
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:21,299
That's what I wanted to do.

224
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,299
That was the goal.

225
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:23,299
That was what I set out to accomplish.

226
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:24,470
And I did.

227
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,470
And yeah, a fistful of frags, guys.

228
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,470
By the way, hold down alt for those of you that are wondering.

229
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,470
Hold on.

230
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,029
What the fucking...

231
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:30,029
All right, hold down alt.

232
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,029
That's the tip.

233
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,029
That's the strategy for the day.

234
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,029
It makes your aim better.

235
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:34,029
All right.

236
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,029
Take care, everybody.

237
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:35,049
Goodbye.
