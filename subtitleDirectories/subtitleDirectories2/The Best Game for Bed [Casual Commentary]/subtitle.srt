00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,509
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:22,690
Tonight's episode of gameplay commentary is going to be what my favorite game to play in bed is.

3
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,989
Now you might be wondering, what do you mean your favorite game to play in bed? What are you talking about?

4
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:33,299
You have a PC, you've got like computers, you've got consoles. No, I'm talking about a game that you can pick up

5
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:40,299
and lie down on your bed and play for seemingly hours before you kind of drift off to sleep or to relax for a little bit.

6
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:45,299
I usually play this game to relax, although it doesn't have a whole lot of replayability.

7
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:51,299
And before anybody says anything, I need to say this very, very clearly, nobody paid me to make this video.

8
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:58,299
I didn't get paid money to make this. The guy that made this game, The Room, did not hand me a sack of hundreds

9
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:04,299
or like a sack of dirty sock full of fucking $20 bills. I like this game, so I'm making a video on it.

10
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:07,299
I did not get paid a single dollar. Please do not think that.

11
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:13,299
And if you say it, God help me, I'm going to be very mad at you and you're going to get in trouble with the Jerma police.

12
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:19,420
But anyways, now that that's out of my system, I play a lot of games in bed.

13
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:26,590
I play a lot of mobile games and I really should get myself something like a DS or a Vita,

14
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,590
because I spend so much time when I'm lying in my bed, just like sitting there chilling out and relaxing before I go to bed

15
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,590
or even when I'm in downtime during the day. I love just chilling out and playing the game.

16
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,769
And sometimes you just want something that'll do that.

17
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:44,769
You want a game where you want to program or something that you can just get in a different mindset,

18
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:51,769
take yourself away from the typical like shooters and like jumping.

19
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:55,439
Like sometimes you want to take yourself away from that.

20
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:03,680
And by far out of any game I've played on the App Store, at least, and this is Android, this is iTunes.

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,680
As long as it's iOS 5 and a recent device, you can't play this on like a 1997 iPod or something.

22
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,919
As long as you have a recent Apple product or a recent Android product, this will work on it.

23
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,219
It's called The Room. A lot of you guys have probably already heard of this game.

24
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:23,219
A lot of you guys probably saying, I played that game. It was pretty cool. It was pretty awesome.

25
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm getting a frog in my throat. A lot of you guys probably played this game before.

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,879
I don't want to show a whole lot of the game.

27
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,879
I'm going to try to put some other stuff in the background probably because I don't want you guys to see all the puzzles

28
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,879
and all the boxes and all the openings and all the cool things that kind of happen during the time you play.

29
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,879
I don't want to give away any of the puzzle answers.

30
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,879
You can figure that out on your own or you can go find the answers if you really want to.

31
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,879
So I'm not sure what I'm going to be doing for the background of this video.

32
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,250
There might be like some random footage of me lifting weights.

33
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,419
I don't know. Something will be there during the course of this because I don't obviously want to give everything away.

34
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:08,659
But what this game is, it's a 3D adventure kind of point and click exploration game

35
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:14,840
where your whole goal is to open up this box that's just sitting on a table.

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,840
And it's not as easy as you think. It's not just like opening up, taking the crate and like prying it open with a crowbar

37
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
or just taking a key and opening and open up the box.

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,840
No, it's a series of crazy contraptions that you have to figure out.

39
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,840
And, oh, let me take a look at that. Let me put this device here.

40
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:40,780
And like it changes the box and it's one of the most satisfying gaming experiences for this type of genre that I've had in a while.

41
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,780
And there's a sequel to that recently came out last year.

42
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,080
This is not a new game.

43
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,080
And it saddens me that a couple of years ago I didn't find this when I was looking for cool games to play on the iPad or on my iPhone

44
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,080
just when I was in the doctor's office or something.

45
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:02,259
Now, the one problem with this game that you might have is, well, Jerma, you made a video pretty recently

46
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:09,259
about how shitty some of these companies are with their freemium, free to play, paywall type experiences.

47
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:13,259
That's not here. This game is one dollar and that's it.

48
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:16,259
There is no in-app purchases. There's no like super clues to buy.

49
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,259
Oh, I need to buy like a super clue to find out this, but no, it's all there.

50
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,259
Everything is there for you for one dollar.

51
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:31,259
As long as you are OK with having the experience be done and not really being able to go back and play it again.

52
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,259
That's the one thing of this game that you can't really do because you know all the puzzles.

53
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:42,259
And although it could be interesting to see how fast you can go through maybe like a speed run or something, but you can't really speed run it.

54
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:48,430
It's one of those games that you have to take your time and see all the animations and all the cool 3D models and stuff.

55
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:55,860
That's part of the game. And it is pretty short for the entire experience for both the room and the room 2.

56
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:03,470
You can probably do them both in less than 10 hours, but it's only going to cost you four bucks for everything anyways.

57
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:11,470
And it's one dollar for the original game and three dollars, two ninety nine for the room 2 as it stands right now.

58
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,470
These prices could change. They could drop. They could go up. I don't know.

59
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,470
That's what it is right now and recording of this video. So I'm just recommending it.

60
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:25,470
Just saying you guys, if you want to try it, go check it out. It's a really fun experience and go lie down in bed.

61
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,470
Go get yourself like a chocolate milk and go start the room and open up the boxes and see what's in there.

62
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,269
I think it could be a hat. No, it's not. It's not a hat inside the box.

63
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,269
All right. Well, that's going to wrap it up here, guys. Thank you so much for watching.

64
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:41,509
I really do appreciate it. And of course, take care, everybody.
