00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,370
Hey, what is going on, guys? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, a one-life commentary at that.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:15,039
Gonna be playing as the Engineer tonight with the Default Jag, the Strange Frontier Justice and the Strange Pistol.

3
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,239
And before I get into any of this, do this, guys.

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,940
When you come out of the spawn, if you've got plenty of setup time, get one of your buildings built already out of the way.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,239
Because then you can get a full Level 3 Dispenser or a full Level 3 Sentry.

6
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:33,350
Then you can just drag it out there, drop it down somewhere that you want it, and be fine.

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,149
A lot of people don't realize that just because the setup time goes down to zero, that doesn't mean anything.

8
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:46,649
It's gonna take the other team at least 10 to 20 seconds to get over to where your Sentry Gun even will be in the first place.

9
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,719
So it's alright if you're like, oh no, I don't want to do that because you only got like 4 seconds left on the clock.

10
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,630
Don't worry about it, you'll be fine.

11
00:00:53,729 --> 00:01:00,399
And before we get into this gameplay, guys, I want to show you something that happened earlier when I was trying to play Sniper.

12
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,799
So I came into this gameplay, I wanted to play Sniper, I wanted to do a gameplay commentary for Sniper.

13
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,900
And look what happens right here, okay? This is ridiculous.

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,000
So right now, there's two Snipers right here, right?

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,200
And as anyone will know, it is very difficult to counter-Snipe two Snipers when they're both aiming at you.

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,799
So watch this. Aim down. I missed this shot, but watch right here.

17
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,969
Bang, headshot, doesn't kill him. Bang, headshot, doesn't kill him.

18
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:26,469
Like, wait, what happened right there? And then look at this!

19
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,769
There's four Snipers right here.

20
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:34,469
I was looking down the sights at a firing squad. They're all aiming at me. Look at how ridiculous that is.

21
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,700
I couldn't believe it.

22
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,829
So let's get back into the Engineer gameplay. I just thought that was insane, so...

23
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,530
Got my buildings all pretty much secured, need a teleporter.

24
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,629
Here is a tip for this spot. This is a great spot.

25
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:53,530
Build all your buildings back here, but leave enough room for you to fit back there.

26
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,530
It's really hard for a Spy to get back here and backstab you if you hang out back in this spot.

27
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,030
You'll see a couple of times a Spy will come back here, and he just gets screwed,

28
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,129
because they have to jump over things, they have to get really, really up in your face to be able to even get behind you.

29
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:12,629
But don't leave too much room, guys, because if you leave enough room for another person to fit back there,

30
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,030
you're going to get backstabbed. You want your back to be stuffed right in the back of the wall.

31
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,729
Also, make sure your teleporter is your number one priority in this type of situation,

32
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:26,930
because if you take a look to the right, that metal, there's 200 metal, like five feet away from me.

33
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,629
So my dispenser is not really that big of a concern. I want to get it up to level three, but that's not priority.

34
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:34,430
Get your teleporter up there first.

35
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,930
And here we go, here's that Spy I was talking about.

36
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,629
Notice how there's not any room back here for him to decloak and find a little situation where he can be safe.

37
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,229
He's stuffed in the back of the wall with all of us, so there's no way he's going to be able to do anything.

38
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:51,030
Where that situation goes really, really bad for most engineers,

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:58,830
is if that dispenser is five or six inches up from where it is right now, a good Spy will always kill you.

40
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,229
So if you are having lots of problems as an engineer getting backstabbed every single time you build a sentry,

41
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:07,229
or every single time you try to do something, try this technique.

42
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,530
You really want to stuff your back against a wall.

43
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,539
If you're against a wall, they can't do anything, they have to just shoot you with a gun.

44
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:16,439
Pretty risky move I just did right there, I pulled it off though.

45
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,539
Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't, but I am a risky bastard, you guys all know that.

46
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,039
What I'm trying to do right here is I am the only engineer on the team.

47
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,840
So if there is no structure, no defensive structure right there, they will just cap it with no problem.

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,740
Looks like they were going to cap it, so I brought it over there, want to try and get some defense on it.

49
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,539
It does a little bit of work, but you can't really be in two places at the same time.

50
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:41,409
I'm trying to be two engineers, and it just doesn't work out so well.

51
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:47,750
Sentry goes down, but I end up with a large amount of revenge crits, and I put them to very good use.

52
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:53,349
Just peeking around this corner right here, making sure no demo men or soldiers were shooting any stickies across the map,

53
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,360
because sometimes that will happen.

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,659
Sentry ends up going down, like I said, and I got the ten revenge crits, take out this heavy medic pair with a couple of shots,

55
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:07,560
miss this one, but he's running away, get him right in the back, boink, get the pyro as well, doing work.

56
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,860
So this part right here is an enormous mistake, I should not have done this.

57
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:18,759
What I should have done is gone right back to my sentry nest, make sure I can get some ammo, make sure build another sentry to full completion.

58
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,259
Instead, I'm trying to go for some shady business here, try to drop a sentry in the tunnel.

59
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:28,459
Look what happens, Spy drops a sapper on my stuff, I don't end up getting there in time.

60
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:31,899
Major, major mistake right there, I should not have been doing that.

61
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:36,000
Trying to get my nest back up to square one, get a dispenser, get a sentry.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,800
It's not worth it though, they are encroaching way too far on this point right now, so I say screw it,

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,100
I'm gonna come out here and kill some people with my revenge crits, and I get a couple of kills, get that demo man, get that Spy.

64
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,699
Not going after a heavy, that's a dumb idea.

65
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:55,199
End up jumping down to this little area on the right side, see a Spy freak out for a second, and then these guys just kind of go in front of me.

66
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,199
They didn't even know I was there, and at this point right now guys, I am freaking out,

67
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,199
because look it, there's only one minute left on the clock pretty much, and there's no defenses here.

68
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,300
And they start to get onto the point, and I'm just like, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I gotta do something.

69
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:14,870
And it's all for naught, because I end up just dying right there, and that Spy saps the sentry, and they cap the point.

70
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,269
That is gonna be the end of the gameplay, the One Life as the Engineer.

71
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:21,470
Thank you so much for watching guys, I really do appreciate it.

72
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,569
If you liked this video, go ahead and shoot me a like, and I will see you all next time.

73
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:27,170
Take care, everybody.
