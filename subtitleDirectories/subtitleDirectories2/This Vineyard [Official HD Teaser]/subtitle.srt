00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,380
You are standing in paradise right now, Frank.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,500
Simply take a look around. Do you see anything besides pure beauty?

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,879
Would you ever sell it?

4
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,879
Oh, no. Absolutely not.

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,989
Everything you see here is all for my boy.

6
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:30,660
It blows my mind. How does it taste this good?

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,659
Well, you don't learn something unless you teach it, in my opinion.

8
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:38,659
I've been working at the same place, Los Santos University Wine Studies,

9
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:44,560
for the past 25 years. And counting, let's hope.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,060
Mom saw those guys outside again. It's the third time this week.

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,060
I'll handle it. Just stay inside.

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:57,240
This is my vineyard! This is my recipe! You're not going to take it!

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,740
You hear me?

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:06,079
You don't understand. It's not just good. It's the best.

15
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,450
We want that wine.

16
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,950
That's not for sale.

17
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,640
What? No, Jeffrey, get down!

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,640
Dammit! No!

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,180
Oh, you bastard! You son of a bitch! Who did this?

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:38,060
Did he receive our message?

21
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,939
I'm going to need a favor.

22
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,439
You're trying to do this all by yourself? That's crazy talk. What do you need?

23
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,439
I think you know what I'm going to do, Tom.

24
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:57,299
They tried to kill my son. They torched the very thing that I've put my entire life into.

25
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,159
You want this vineyard? Come and get it.

26
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,159
But I warn you, I have a very special set of skills like the guy from Taken.

27
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,319
I want him dead, and I want his family dead too!

28
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,319
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

29
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,759
You want to bring a fight to me? Now that was a big mistake.

30
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,759
I beg to differ.

31
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,569
They're not going to stop until they get what they want.

32
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:31,370
If I have to go through every single one of them, so be it.

33
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,930
Wine is complicated. Life is complicated.

34
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,930
Do you have the right ingredients? Do you have the right time frame?

35
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,930
Are you ready to start your winery? Are you ready to start your life?

36
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:51,240
Write that down, because yes, it will be on the test.
