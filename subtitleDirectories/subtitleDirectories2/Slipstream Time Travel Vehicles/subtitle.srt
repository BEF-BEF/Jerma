16
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,530

00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,099
What the fuck just happened to me

25
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,110
Wait

26
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:15,909
I don't know you cheated. I was in front of you and you just like lagged. All right. I'm voting for and back again

27
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,590
Way to go sugar. I wish I wish I had like a face cam on right now. My hands are like i'm

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,199
So i'm getting really confused right now. Your name is purple. My car is purple and it's freaking me out

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,159
I feel like I should be over there. I feel like that's like my name floating above you

30
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,020
Maybe it is

31
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:42,020
What do you mean maybe oh, this is a time travel game I just I just hit you with something germa and it did nothing

32
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,819
I'm gonna land on top of star

33
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,740
Nope missed

34
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,740
Well, yeah, you have like the unlockable car

35
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,669
It's not unlockable. What are you talking about? Right? You like you do like download that for like 4.99

36
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,530
I don't even

37
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:05,849
Mail is just like in the back. I landed on the side and it just I just started sliding into the water. Oh

38
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,810
Baby, oh baby, baby. He's got blast oist

39
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,939
You just got totally blast oist

40
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,659
All right. So how do I go through the the super time travel thing space?

41
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:24,539
Okay. Oh, oh

42
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,259
No, it does nothing though. Don't worry

43
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,860
It does it does you have to go into one of the rocks

44
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,050
So this whole game's mechanic is based on

45
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,990
Teleporting in front of each other

46
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,710
Yeah, basically what the fuck is that?

47
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,629
Oh, yeah, let's make a game. Let's make a racing game where you just like teleport in front of each other

48
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,430
The track doesn't even matter. Look

49
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:53,909
Oh second place i'll be like fly in front of everybody

50
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:57,860
How did you get up there? I feel like I feel like you're angry

51
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:03,330
Oh, that's fine. That's fine. Like you think you're gonna win is what this is right now

52
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,930
I I think i'm going to fucking teleport in front of you right now

53
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,569
Because like here I am. Hi

54
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:11,250
Hi star

55
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,449
I'm in front of me. I'm literally like right in front of means

56
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,329
I'm gaining on you

57
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,949
What the?

58
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,550
That doesn't I

59
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,509
What is this device on my back? What is?

60
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:26,790
Hey star

61
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,790
Hi, I teleported behind you

62
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:31,889
Great. I'm driving

63
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,420
No, see ya. No

64
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
teleportation technique unleashed

65
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
No, what the hell just what happened?

66
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,899
Uh, i'm about to win. I have a very serious question incredibly serious question this needs to be addressed

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,139
Why?

68
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,779
Is this game named carnage racing and not like time travel racing? Why?

69
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:06,500
What the fuck is the point? Why is this called carnage racing? It's not like carnage. It's time travel getting it done sugar

70
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,959
No, the game would correct itself

71
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,589
You just came

72
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,589
from

73
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:25,970
I

74
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,930
Wow, you're just taking all my things. You're absolutely correct. Cool. This whole game is just a series of

75
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:37,889
Quote what the fuck just happened. That's this whole game. Like for instance, right like what the fuck just happened

76
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Yeah, yeah, come come on hit me just

Let me know when you're getting to the end of almost the entire race. Okay?

86
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,500
When you guys are looking at the finish line, I want you to tell me that okay

87
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:41,149
Okay, i'm gonna go get a drink. I'll be right back. Oh look

88
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,189
I'm having so much fun playing this video game with my friends

89
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:54,959
I haven't even moved one time. I looked almost done. This is a fun racing game to play

90
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,379
Especially with your friends. You should go through

91
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,019

Now slow down slow down

96
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,620
I need to see if this works

97
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,019
What is this game

98
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,180
That's so dumb i'm done over game over we're done

99
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,089
I don't want to play this anymore

100
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,930
There's no reason to play this

101
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,490
There's no reason to play this if you guys can just if people can just do that

102
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,319
What's the point of ever playing this game ever?
