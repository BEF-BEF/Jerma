1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:25,469
I'm going for the shotgun. Shotgun is where it's at. I did not know what Francis was going to say. He was like, man, Zoe is pissed. I thought he was going to say, man, Zoe is hot. Quite the opposite.

2
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:35,780
Alright, let's do this thing. Very careful, they can spawn now. Yeah, they're usually on that roof up there. Yeah, they are. There's a smoker up there.

3
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:50,939
You got one. There you go. Oh, Rigatoni. Oh, Rigatoni. Rigatoni. Oh, there's a hunter coming down right now. Hunter on the move. Thank you very much. And a smoker on Rigatoni.

4
00:00:50,939 --> 00:01:00,179
Oh, hunter on me, hunter on me. Alright, let's go, let's go. They're all down at this boomer. Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh god, it's alright. They're all down. We have 20 seconds just to move. Just move.

5
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:11,230
Okie dokie. Reload, dammit. They got a respawn time. Oh, they have a spitter behind us. Or in front of us, I'm not sure. How? How is that possible? I have no idea.

6
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:21,629
Do they have like a set respawn delay? Or is it on like a... It's like 20 seconds. Yeah, it's like 20 seconds, I think. Okay. That's a nasty time delay. Let's move on out of here.

7
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:30,810
I think it's like, if they have a full team, then it takes longer. But if there's only like two on their team, it's only like a 10 second delay so they can get more infected. Oh crap, oh crap, crap. Where's the spitter up top?

8
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:42,500
I don't know. Spitter on the roof. Spitter on the roof. Fiddler on the roof. Yep. Alright, so far so good. So far so good.

9
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:53,280
Here's an axe and... Oh, give me that auto shotty. I'll take that. Oh god, jockey on me and rigatoni's getting plastered right now.

10
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:02,519
Wait, somebody just got... Oh my god. Oh, he's talking in the... Oh, he can talk. We can hear him. Oh no. Oh, I see him. Oh, nice. Oh, what's he doing?

11
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:18,879
He can heal. Let's have him heal up. Oh god, I got you. Oh, rigatoni's got... Oh, I'm on fire now. Oh god. I'm just healing. Oh my god, we're getting dominated. Oh god.

12
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,879
Thank you. Alright, we gotta keep moving, keep moving. I definitely don't overreact.

13
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:35,449
Hey, overreacting is okay, left for dead, because it's scary. Oh, is that a spitter back in here? There's a hunter right there coming up to try and get...

14
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:48,699
He's not dead. The hunter's still back there. He is still back there. Keep your eye out for boomers. There hasn't been a boomer in a while, so keep your eye out.

15
00:02:48,699 --> 00:03:03,860
You know what? I'm gonna throw this behind us. Oh my god, I'm busy trying to blight a fire and I can't even... Oh, what an idiot.

16
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,860
I hear a hunter, I can't see anything. Oh my god, that was a good charge.

17
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:16,349
Oh man, all at once. Are we dead right now? I'm coming, Jerma. Save me! Kill that charger!

18
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:28,250
Alright, we're good. We're alright. What a real shame about my aim. Oh, the son of a bitch is still stomping me.

19
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:36,120
It's no problem. We're good. We're good, we're good.

20
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,550
I need a boo, let me get those pills. Sure thing, honey.

21
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:48,560
Oh, come back to me. Boo, boo, boo. Oh, what? What? Come on, Rigatoni. There's a jockey over here, too.

22
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Jockey on me, jockey on me. Oh my god. Our teammates are killing the shit out of me.

23
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,939
We gotta get out of this area. Oh my god, they just respawned me.

24
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,370
There's a charger. Oh no, it's not a charger. Just a very fast common infected.

25
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:19,189
Let's do this thing. We gotta get out of this area. Like, right when I get up, run. Just start running the other way.

26
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:22,189
Give them pills, give them pills, boo. Just right click on me with those pills.

27
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:29,430
That's what I'm talking about. Let's get the hell out of here. Is it through here? Pills. Auto. Okay, let's go.

28
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,129
Let's get out of here. There's a Rigatoni. There's a Rigatoni right there. Dead.

29
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:42,180
Rigatoni is behind us. I don't think he's playing, to be honest.

30
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,180
Is he just like AFK? No, we can't leave him.

31
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,620
Alright, if you revive him and he stands still, we're just gonna run.

32
00:04:53,620 --> 00:05:00,300
Oh no, no. He's still alive. Yeah, he's standing still. God damn it.

33
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,819
Just go, just go. Leave him, leave him. Goodbye Rigatoni. He'll be fine.

34
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:11,819
Oh, Gordon Bennett. It's alright, we're good, we're good.

35
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,579
Incendiary ammo. Oh lord. We, we, we're good. Okay.

36
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:20,579
Just some ammo. Oh, I'm smoked. Cheers. He's still up on that rock.

37
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:26,290
Oh, boomer in here, boomer in here, and a hunter, and a hunter.

38
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:31,769
I got you. I'm just gonna crouch. Don't stand in the spit, don't stand in the spit.

39
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,769
I can't see anything. Oh, a hunter on me, a hunter on me kicking my ass.

40
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,220
Oh, I'm getting owned. Can I get him? Yep.

41
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Oh, they don't have these hazmat suits on.

42
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Oh, we gotta pick up that, pick up that boomer bile.

43
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:54,889
Pick up this incendiary ammo, we gotta keep moving. Let's run.

44
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,889
Yay. Just ammo in general is nice.

45
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,769
Alright, this is, we're like just getting to like the point.

46
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,769
Wow, we're just, yeah, this is gonna, this is the friggin' tank.

47
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,259
Oh no. Oh no, I can't, we can't, we just like jumped down.

48
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:13,259
Oh no. Oh lord. Oh, this is it, this is game over.

49
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:16,259
Game over. This isn't even a disaster.

50
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:19,259
We just got our asses kicked, like big time.

51
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,259
Just getting smoked.

52
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,439
So thank you everybody so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.

53
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,439
