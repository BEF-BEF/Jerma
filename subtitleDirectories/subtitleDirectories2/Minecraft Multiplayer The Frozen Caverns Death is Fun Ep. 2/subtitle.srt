1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,320
So is this going to be like a little hotel? This is uh, it's going to be like a little...

2
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:22,280
How? Hey, I'm not sleeping with like three dudes clumped up in one little area. I feel like I'm

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:31,480
back in college. Alright, here's a crafting table and we can't make... Do we have coal?

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:39,750
Anyone have coal? Anybody? It's down there. By the tree. By the tree. Okay, well we need a pick to do

5
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:53,219
that. I'm gonna make a leather helmet and I'm gonna make a leather... I don't know. Alright,

6
00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:00,710
I have a wooden pick now. Alright, I have leather pants and a leather helmet. I'm gonna look like a

7
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:15,060
clown. You look all steampunk with this texture pack on. I look like I have a cardboard box on my

8
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,859
head. Yeah, I think we're all using different texture packs. It's pretty cool. I'm using Snacks

9
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:27,349
PRBD. I'm using the default. That's a good one, you know. That's the classic right there. I'm using

10
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:37,140
the classic. So don't... Did you guys plant the saplings? Don't dig this out. There, let's

11
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:45,700
put the door down right there. So I'm gonna plant a tree right here. I'm making my way

12
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:51,750
through the snow. I can't plant a tree anywhere. You have to do it on the dirt. Oh,

13
00:01:52,469 --> 00:02:00,549
uh, right. He's way over there. He's exploring without us, man. We're like building structures

14
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:07,670
and houses and stuff. I'm playing with fire right now. I'm throwing snowballs at this enderman

15
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,550
that's all the way up there. No, we might throw snowballs. Put the door down right here, man.

16
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:22,789
Oops. Oops. I got sticky keys that did not like that. Okay. So we make a door.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,159
I think you have one. I made one. Oh, God. Mops are dropping down on me. Oh, look at this little

18
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:42,330
house. Oh, yeah. Julius Caesar would have lived in this house. And just unlimited glass. I have

19
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,610
three stacks of 64 glass. All right. I want my bed to go right here. I want a picture of my favorite

20
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,370
president. Uh, Grover Cleveland right here. And then I want, um, a cop to go right here.

21
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:59,020
We need to find some sheep. I don't think we're going to find any sheep.

22
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,780
Uh, we're going to find a bunch of leptors. Just look at this.

23
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,780
Left is up there being like a one man army. Oh, I just fell. Yeah.

24
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:15,060
I'll get your stuff, man. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, zombie. Get away. All right. Oh, my God.

25
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:23,659
I'm getting knocked all over the place. Oh, there's a creeper and a zombie. Oh, my God.

26
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:33,580
Okay. Creeper blew up. I'm cool. All right. Here's some leather stuff. No problem. I'll make some

27
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,039
other stuff as well. I am. We need to make a chest.

28
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:48,099
Welcome back. I have something for you. You do? What do you got? Let me see. What is this? Do we

29
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:54,090
have like a new friend? Is this like our God dog? What is this guy doing? He's, he is, uh,

30
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:05,590
defending the fort, man. That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey you, I'm talking to you. He's, he's waiting

31
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,870
patiently for the lepter to come out. You look at me when I'm talking to you. All right.

32
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:19,100
Oh, well I just hit him. He's dead. Nice. All right guys. Here you go. All right. We do have

33
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,589
some bones. He's got an iron sword and I'm over here trying to pass out wooden swords.

34
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:30,360
Hey, I'll take a wooden sword. I will absolutely take a wooden sword. It's starting to be daytime

35
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:39,430
now. I'm going to do a travel. Germa, pass me your, that bone you picked up. Here you go. I have it

36
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:48,779
now. It's my bone. My one and only bone. I put two more bones in the chest. So we got, we got some,

37
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:54,300
some miracle grow right here. Oh, I thought you were just looking at your pants.

38
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,699
You look like Steve Urkel. You got your pants are like all the way up to like to your belly button.

39
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,220
All right. Back up, Germa. Back up a lot. They're all going to die.

40
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,769
Yeah. They blew it up. Ha ha. Yeah. This is all, there's a bunch. This is two or three in there

41
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:19,449
still. I'm going down. I'm going to bring the bow. And then, then there was one. I thought he got

42
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,930
him. I thought he got him. Let's go together. Hang on. Hang on. There's still, there's something

43
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,009
in here. Look, look, look. This is what I wanted to explore before. I think, was there only one more

44
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:33,699
in there? Did you get them? Was, was there only one more creeper in there? Yeah. He blew up.

45
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:39,620
All right. There's nothing in here now. Oh God. There's one in here. All right. Here's the thing.

46
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,060
We got to get back and get our stuff before it disappears. But sweet. I finished them off.

47
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:50,579
Why are these, why are these two fighting each other? Because one of them took damage from the

48
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:57,579
other. Taking these guys down. I'm almost out of food though. So kind of a problem.

49
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:06,120
Get out of here, spider. Anybody got any food? I need arrows. Do you guys have arrows? I, yeah. I

50
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:14,339
do not. All right. Cool. All right. Zombies are the primary target here. Yo, there's electric.

51
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:20,709
Actually, let's just go to the melon farm. Yo, that's. Venom sack. Venom sack. Really should

52
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:31,019
have attacked his ring today. Yeah. But where's the fun in that? So. Oh, there's another one though.

53
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:34,620
Come at me. Watch out. Come at me. Everybody. Let's go. Don't, don't, don't go that way.

54
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,459
All of you. We'll take every single one of you on right now.

55
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:49,420
Oh, there goes Jerma. But he took one for the team. Hey, at least we got some zombie flesh.

56
00:06:50,860 --> 00:07:00,870
Okay. So try to stay on the same path. Man, this bridge freaks me out. Yeah, it really does. It's

57
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:07,449
just like, where am I going to fall down? Drop that skelly on the left. Oh, there's a chest down

58
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:17,350
there. Forget the chest, man. We got to get that enchanted bow. Except everyone is. I think

59
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:23,509
Jerma went the wrong way. Did I go the wrong way? Oh, there he goes. Watch out. There's a skeleton

60
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,750
that's on you. Except for me and you left there. I looked over to see you because I heard you say,

61
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,069
I think you went the wrong way. I turned and I fell.
