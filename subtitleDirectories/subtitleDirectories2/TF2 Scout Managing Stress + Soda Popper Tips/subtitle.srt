00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,380
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jermaw here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,379
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Scout with the Soda Popper, the Mad Milk, and the Candy King.

3
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:25,679
So this video is gonna touch upon a couple of different things. It's always a couple things with me.

4
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,679
It's never three, never four, never one, always two.

5
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:34,679
The first thing is gonna be soda popper tips, and how I use this thing, and how I've gotten better with this thing.

6
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,679
And pretty much things to avoid when you do use this thing.

7
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,679
And the second thing is gonna talk about managing stress.

8
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,679
Stress in everyday life, stress in gaming. I really just stress in general in how I manage it.

9
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,679
And I guess we will touch on that first, because I'll talk about last night.

10
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,679
If you were at the stream last night, you probably know what I'm talking about.

11
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,679
I was given some codes to give away on Smite Game.

12
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,679
There were 400 gem codes, and I was given 10 of them by the fine people at Hi-Rez.

13
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,680
And what happened was I got about maybe a third of the way through the codes.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,680
And I accidentally showed them on stream, and it was just bang like that. They were pretty much all gone.

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,920
So what I ended up saying is I said, look, if I rolled your name, and you tried to put the code in and it didn't work,

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,920
please let me know, and I will just buy you a gem code with my own money.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Because, I mean, before I go any further, I want to make this very clear.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,920
When I do stuff like this, guys, I want to make sure that you actually get what I say is gonna happen.

19
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,920
It's so important to me that stuff like this does go through, and stuff like this does happen without major hitches.

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,920
And if it does, and that's the first point I have to make about dealing with stress and managing stress,

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,159
things are never gonna go according to plan.

22
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,400
Even if you have the most concrete plan that you think is never gonna go wrong, chances are it's not gonna go 100%.

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
It's not gonna go completely according to your plan.

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,400
And that's the first thing you need to realize when you're managing something like a stressful situation or stress in daily life.

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Always plan for your plan to not work.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Now, that's pretty ironic because I just said all plans never really go according to plan,

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,400
so you planning for your stress to be planned is planning it.

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,400
It's kind of a weird oxymoron there, but still, you need to be prepared for the worst possible situation.

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I believe it's called Murphy's Law is the actual term for that.

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,400
That if a situation can go wrong, it will go wrong.

31
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
That is Murphy's Law.

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,830
And when you start applying your everyday life to things like Murphy's Law, stressful situations don't really get to you.

33
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,830
They don't really make you overreact.

34
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:46,830
They don't make you freak out or, you know, pull your hair out because you kind of expected something like this could potentially happen.

35
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,830
And that's really what I'm getting at here is stressful situations, although they cannot be avoided,

36
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,830
they can be managed by staying calm and not freaking out.

37
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,830
Last night, if I had freaked out, like, oh, dear God, the codes are out.

38
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,830
The codes are out. Everybody get to get into Winnebago.

39
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,830
We're going to get to get it.

40
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,830
Like if I had done something like that, it would have caused a major, major problem.

41
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,830
But instead, I just was like, all right, this happened.

42
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,830
How am I going to deal with it? And then you can apply that to everyday life.

43
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,830
That's something you have to apply on a daily basis.

44
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,830
It doesn't come that easily.

45
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,830
You're going to you're going to have some freak out moments.

46
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,830
Let me tell you right now, if like if you're like your car is going off a cliff,

47
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,830
like if you're like driving down the street and you go off the highway into like a ravine,

48
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,830
it's OK to scream because that's a pretty ridiculous situation.

49
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,069
You can't just sit there and be like, well, you know, this could have happened.

50
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:40,069
We could have gone off the ravine.

51
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,250
Like that's not really what I'm getting at here.

52
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:51,250
What I'm getting at is to keep your levels of stress down by preparing for bad things to actually happen to you.

53
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,250
Always be cautious, always be optimistic and always have a backup plan.

54
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,250
Those are the three things to manage your stress.

55
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,250
At least that's how I do it.

56
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,250
And that's going to end that little topic there.

57
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,250
Just wanted to bring that up and let you guys know how I deal with situations like the one that happened last night.

58
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,250
Now let's move on to the soda popper.

59
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,250
I want to talk about this for a couple of minutes.

60
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,250
Some various tips on how to not freak out and not get stressed out when you're using this weapon.

61
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,680
So the first thing to talk about is the fact that probably the most important thing is it only has two shots.

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,680
And I would say the same thing about the Force of Nature as well.

63
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Never just unload both shots at the same time.

64
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Even if you think you're going to hit somebody with this thing, both shots, you know in your head, I'm going to hit this guy with both shots.

65
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Do not jump the gun and launch out both at the same time.

66
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Because if you happen to miss, if you miss the person with the second shot, you're out of luck because then you got to reload the thing.

67
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,860
And even though it reloads quite quickly, you're still not shooting somebody for a couple of seconds.

68
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,860
You still have to get back into position.

69
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,860
You still have to aim at them.

70
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:55,029
So it's a better idea to wait till you know you have a guaranteed boom, wait, boom.

71
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:57,029
You want to time it accordingly.

72
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:04,269
Because when you jump the gun with this thing, and believe me, I'm guilty of this myself, you end up just shooting erratically.

73
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,269
You know, like bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

74
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,269
And you're missing every single shot.

75
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:16,579
And if you just took the time to calm down a little bit and plant one, plant one shot, especially if you have the mini crits activated,

76
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:25,939
that one shot, that two shots that you actually plant on them are going to be way more effective than if you're just spamming at them erratically trying to hit them with a random shot.

77
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:32,939
So the second thing I want to talk about, and I will end on this, is the fact that managing the mini crits doesn't have to be that complicated.

78
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:34,939
You don't have to really, I mean, it's good to store them.

79
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:37,939
It's good to switch over at the last second before the height meter fills up.

80
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,939
And wait, maybe get yourself in a better situation.

81
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,939
If nobody's around, you probably shouldn't be using the mini crits.

82
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,939
But it shouldn't be something that you're just actively thinking about.

83
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:46,939
It should be something that's in the back of your head.

84
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:49,939
Because when you start to go, oh, wait, I don't want to use those crits now.

85
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:50,939
Oh, damn it.

86
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:52,939
Oh, and you switch out and you switch back and you switch out.

87
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:59,120
You're giving your brain something else to do rather than actively pursuing a point or attacking somebody.

88
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,120
And most of the time when you're in that situation when there's nobody around, like I said, that's okay.

89
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,120
But if there are people around, if there's at least one or two enemies around, just let the crits happen.

90
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
You don't have to store them.

91
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,120
You don't hoard them and think of a time when it would be a better situation for it because the thing is going to pop right back up in no time.

92
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
The hype meter fills pretty quickly.

93
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,120
So don't be afraid to just let the crits roll out as long as there's a couple people around.

94
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,810
But that is going to conclude this video, guys.

95
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,810
Thank you all so much for watching.

96
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,810
I really do appreciate it.

97
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,810
And I'll see you guys all soon.

98
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,810
And of course, take care, everybody.
