1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:15,369
It's time to move in. Why is everybody standing completely still? What is going on?

2
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:25,739
Let's go everybody. Welcome to your new home, the rumble house. You can go in.

3
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:37,070
They all immediately want to go to the gigantic stereo. Oh, they're turning it

4
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:43,590
off and turning it on. What the fuck are they doing? Why is everybody pulling on a

5
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,740
changer and turning it off and turning it on again? We'll see what happens. We got

7
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:13,920

8
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,040
You're all supposed to hate each other. Stop getting along. This is the rumble

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,090
house. This is not the like let's talk and have fun and be friends house. This

15
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,099
gonna start the first fight. Eventually people are gonna start to get real

16
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:34,199
tired and somebody's gonna throw a punch. Nope. We're doing more sit-ups. All right. Turn

17
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:40,800
off the fucking stereo. Come here burger boy. Get over here. Turn the stereo off.

18
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:52,259
Turn it off. This party is over. Grandpa is just. Oh there we go. Here we go.

19
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:59,669
Grandpa's got like flaming drinks. Yeah. All right. Where do they put them? What?

20
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:10,050
Oh they're on the table. These drinks are on fire. What are you doing? What are you

21
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:18,060

22
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,219
clicking on to for him to jog but apparently he's gonna do it anyways.

23
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:26,300
Wait. That's it. That was it. That's the whole jog. I really think he's coming

25
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:41,860
property line and you're coming back and you're very uncomfortable. Well I wonder

26
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:48,479

32
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,509
Glue man and Jerma. They hate all and they both drink at the same time. They're

33
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:45,459
both just pissed. Don't even tell me. Don't even tell me. That wasn't even the

34
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:53,069
right drink. That was. Where did I get that drink? I picked up like a bowl of

35
00:04:53,069 --> 00:05:02,870
fruit punch and threw it in his face. All right. Well we're gonna. Uh-oh. Wait a

36
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:16,680
minute. Wait a minute. What? Oh you screwed that up. He's gonna piss his pants.

37
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,620
Yeah you gotta. We gotta make some friends. Everybody go over there quick.

38
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:35,410
Call her over. So say hello. We need to make some friends. We're all such

39
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:41,600
shitheads. It's like we need to like make a friend. I don't think she heard you. No

40
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,350
I really don't think she heard. No she's gone. You see that was a great job. You

41
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:54,060

42
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:07,620

43
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:16,620
What is going on with this group? Why is this person over here doing

44
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:32,709
sit-ups? Well it looks like they made some friends. At least glue man did. Glue

45
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:39,220
man made a lot of friends. This entire bar and club like loves him. He's like

46
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:49,199
the coolest guy in town. Where's grandpa? Where'd he go? He's sleeping on a bench.

47
00:06:49,199 --> 00:07:02,860
Good for you grandpa. He only had like ten gin and tonics. Okay. My like stomach

48
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,730

49
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,329
here and turn on the radio. I guarantee it. I bet you a thousand dollars somebody

50
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:14,529
comes in here and turns the fucking radio on and they're gonna wake up the

51
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:21,180
whole house. They're asleep. You can't. They're not listening to you. I can't.

52
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,360
Alright. Star's gonna pull a cereal. When is somebody going to pull out the remote

53
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:34,980
control? Turn on the stereo and wake up everybody else that's sleeping in the house.

54
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:47,779
We're still missing King Bia. Who knows if he made it out alive? Because he might have

55
00:07:48,620 --> 00:08:01,980
on the way back. There it is. There it is. Who did it? I don't even think anybody did it.

56
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:25,769
Everybody just went like. Why are you all so stupid? Takes us one asshole. No one will ever

57
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:30,370
sleep in this house. Because somebody always goes I want to dance. I want to like to dance

58
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:43,049
now please. I swear to God if I come back again to somebody else doing fucking sit-ups that has

59
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:49,009
nothing like I am I don't even know what I'm gonna do. Why? And they're gone. Disappeared.

60
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:57,909
Look look look look. I think it's the same lady every time.
