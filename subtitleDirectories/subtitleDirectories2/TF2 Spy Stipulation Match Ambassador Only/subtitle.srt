00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,890
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,890
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Spy tonight with a stipulation match.

3
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:26,320
So if you do not remember what this is, I will give you a quick little memory jog, a brief description of what's going on here.

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,320
This is the series where I take a class, a certain set of items, or a certain rule set, and I have to follow the rules.

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,320
Like, for instance, in the last video was a shotgun heavy, and I was only allowed to use the shotgun, could not use the minigun.

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:46,500
And in this video, this is a Spy, like I said, and I'm only allowed to use the Ambassador and the Dead Ringer.

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
I cannot use the knife and I cannot disguise.

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,859
And before we get really started here, I want to say this setup surprised the hell out of me.

9
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,859
I really didn't think this was gonna go anywhere. I thought I was gonna just be dying and raging all over the place.

10
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:05,859
But no, I do really ridiculously well in this little set of clips here.

11
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,859
Especially in this first one, I killed like nine people in a row.

12
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:15,099
And really, after playing with this for maybe an hour or two, I think it took me maybe an hour to get this gameplay.

13
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:22,099
So after playing with this for a little while, I've come to the realization that I want to do this with the Connivorous Kunai.

14
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:25,340
Get a backstab on somebody and just go for the headshots.

15
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,519
I mean, who knows how well that's gonna work in practice, but it was just a thought I had.

16
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,519
I might try it at some point.

17
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:38,079
And also, guys, leave me a couple more comments. I love getting your ideas on the next stipulation matches.

18
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,079
The next one is probably gonna be a sniper with the Jurati and I can only no scope.

19
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,079
So that's probably gonna be the next one. But after that, I don't really have any plans.

20
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,079
So shoot me some comments. Let's get some more cool ideas going.

21
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,829
So let's talk about the gameplay now. We are on CP Gorge on defense.

22
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,829
And I would probably recommend you do this on defense if you're gonna try and do this.

23
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:04,829
Only because offense, you really have to push and there's a lot of spam factor you have to take into consideration.

24
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,830
But try it on defense. That's where I've seen the most success doing this.

25
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:15,629
Picking off that sniper right there and then me and this soldier get into one of the most ridiculous fights ever.

26
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:20,629
Like seriously, cue your favorite carnival music because that's what should be playing right now.

27
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,870
Like really, this is ridiculous. Look at this.

28
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,870
We are still going and eventually I get the kill on him. I couldn't believe that.

29
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,870
I was flabbergasted that I got that, by the way.

30
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,560
Coming out here, I'll get to strategy in a second, but watch what happens right here.

31
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Demoman goes in the air. Do I get the? No, I don't.

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,560
Oh, well. Yeah, I do.

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,500
That guy was in the spawn door when I shot him.

34
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,810
I mean, it would have been so much better if I had got him in the air.

35
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,810
But, you know, whatever. At least I still got him.

36
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,430
Oh, also, I gotta bring this up.

37
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,430
So in the kill feed, you're probably seeing Henry Bubinski.

38
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,430
And that's just one of my stupid aliases I've been putting on lately.

39
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,430
That and Dick Simmons.

40
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,430
So if you see Henry Bubinski or Dick Simmons, it's just me being a weirdo.

41
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,430
I like to mess around sometimes.

42
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,800
Right there, also, I was trying to get the soldier to blow himself up on my dead ringer.

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,620
I don't know why it didn't work, though. Maybe I was a little too far away.

44
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,620
So now I want to talk about strategy, not just strategy with this setup.

45
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,620
I want to talk about the ambassador and how to improve your ambassador game.

46
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,620
This is how I do it, and it's a little weird. It's a little unorthodox.

47
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,620
But, you know, it might help somebody, so might as well tell you how I do it.

48
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,979
So what I do, I pretend the ambassador is a sniper rifle.

49
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:44,159
Not only do I do that, I also pretend that I'm zoomed in with the sniper rifle.

50
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,159
So if you can give yourself this mind trick where when you aim at somebody with the ambassador,

51
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:55,159
you're really telling yourself, hey, this is just a really crappy sniper rifle with, like, no zoom on it.

52
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,509
You'll start doing better, because, trust me, that's how I started using it.

53
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,509
And you have to remember, guys, it's all mental.

54
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:07,069
That crosshair, the ambassador crosshair, is no different than the sniper rifle crosshair.

55
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,069
It's all just mathematics. It's all mechanics in the game.

56
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,069
Because the ambassador and the sniper rifle, they're both hitscan weapons.

57
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:21,069
So if you just put yourself in the sniper mindset and shoot like you would a sniper,

58
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:24,069
you're going to use this item so much better, and you're going to be so much better with it.

59
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:29,310
And also, one more thing to add to this, do not freak out with this weapon.

60
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,310
Too many times I see ambassador spies just...

61
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,310
And they just freak out and shoot every single second they can.

62
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:43,490
And you have to realize, you have to wait a full almost two seconds before this is going to be able to headshot again.

63
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,730
So really take your time with this, guys.

64
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:51,730
Even if it takes you three or four seconds between shots, take that time to get yourself in the zone.

65
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,730
And don't just fire randomly, because this thing does less damage if you don't headshot someone.

66
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,290
So this is going to be the end of the gameplay, guys.

67
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,290
Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

68
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,290
And I don't get on the top of the scoreboard or anything like that.

69
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,529
I wasn't really expecting to.

70
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:11,529
So I'll see you all soon, and take care, everybody.
