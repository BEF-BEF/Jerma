00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:18,620
Hello, it's Traveler. I got you. What the hell is your character? What's your name? What is your name?

2
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:27,100
You look like Elmo. Don't do that. I'm gonna die now. Yeah, I'm gonna bleed to death now. Did you slice him?

3
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,969
Yeah, he sliced me. I'm dead. I'm just looking at the screen right now. It's just 19, 18, 17, 16.

4
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,979
Hold on, I can do something. Hold on, hold on. I have a... You better hurry up, whatever the hell

5
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:48,820
you're gonna do. You! Oh, you're a zombie? Well, hello zombie. I've got pocket knife. All right,

6
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,539
let's also save all the looting and stuff for when we actually meet up. We just get like a melee

7
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:59,560
weapon. I broke my leg by the way. I was climbing, I climbed up this ladder to try to find like just

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:08,790
like a weapon and I slid down and broke my like femur. So I'm gonna have like a bro, a handsaw.

9
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:16,010
Good, here we go. Come on! I've got legitimately like 30 zombies on me. Yeah, there's so many.

10
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:28,780
Get away from me, back! Back, you vile spawn of Satan! These guys are gonna kill me. Why does the

11
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,900
handsaw suck? Holy shit, this item is terrible! I'm dead. Well, you're trying to kill zombies

12
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:44,010
with a saw. What do you expect? I think I'm at pizza again. Oh, there's a lot of zombies here.

13
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,209
Yeah, just be careful. It's out, it's out, it's out. No gas. Oh, that one does not have any gas.

14
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:54,939
I'm at pizza again. All right, well you are currently getting swarmed. Yeah, no joke.

15
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:05,719
Don't die. I haven't got hit yet. Oh, that's a fast one. That's a fast one. He's fast.

16
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,759
Where's the katana man? Yeah, you have to run to me. I'm running to you. Just kill the fast one

17
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:18,219
behind me. That's it. Just backpedal, backpedal while you do it. Okay, I don't think I want to

18
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:27,289
do that. Oh, sledgehammer. All right guys, we finally met up three friends. What do you guys

19
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:36,729
want to do? What the hell? Is that a door? The shield stay on your side. Your arms are just

20
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:41,770
coming through. Hey, dude, it took us seriously like an hour and 15 minutes to find each other.

21
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:54,060
Do not just to start attacking. Are there no headlights on this car? Oh, there we go. All

22
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,099
right, let's do it. If you turn around, you can see Jarvan sitting in the back. That's funny.

23
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,740
I'm going to sit in the back with him. He looks lonely. All right, I have no idea where I'm going,

24
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:10,439
by the way. Sit back here with me. Hey, is there a military base? No, I did not mean to do that.

25
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,960
I didn't mean to do that. Did you hit him? I'm not going to tell you what happened,

26
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,650
because I don't want this to turn bad, so no. I'm trying to do it. How do I hit you?

27
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:25,270
You can't. Only I can, apparently. All right, let's go. You can shoot out of the windows.

28
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,419
How? If you have guns. I don't know. Can I shoot him in the back seat? Don't even tell me.

29
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:37,930
Seriously, don't. Don't even seriously. Hey! Oh, you killed me.

30
00:03:52,550 --> 00:04:00,280
Why? I didn't think I was going to instantly kill you. I'm crying right now.

31
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:09,699
I really didn't think that was going to instantly kill you. Instantly. Dude, I thought it was just

32
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:17,930
going to be like when I hit him, it was just like boop. A zombie. Oh, no. Whoa. Whoa.

33
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:28,149
What the hell, dude? He wasn't even in here. What happened? He's dead now. I almost died.

34
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:37,579
Snuck up on him when I was looting. I took some vitamins. Did they give you help?

35
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:46,040
No. Oh, I guess maybe they do. Hey, Jeremy, get out of that building real quick. That car's

36
00:04:46,040 --> 00:05:00,170
about to explode. What car? No, that car. What are you grunting for? There's so many zombies.

37
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,779
You better get out of that car. I'm out. It's going to blow you up. You're still too close,

38
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:20,009
probably. Can you kill this guy? I only have 35%. There's bandages in here. There's vitamins

39
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:28,649
in here. All right, let's get them. They've trapped me. No, I can't get in there. Don't worry. I got

40
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:37,910
you. I got you. Jeez. Punch him. Punch him. Punch him. There's an island with a helicopter down

41
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,629
there. Oh, you're in the island with the downed helicopter? That's what I've been saying. Wait,

42
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:56,519
let me look through my binoculars. I see him. I'm so glad we found him. Italics, land ho. Whoa.

43
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:04,230
All right, you guys don't do it. I think I found food and I think I'm holding it in my hand now.

44
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:10,500
But I think I want to eat it. You're going to give that food to me? I'm at 18%. I want to put

45
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:17,860
that back down to zero. I have 85%. You're dropping that food. Put that food down. Put it down.

46
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:28,259
Come on. I will catch up to you. We got a runner. I'm at 90. I can't believe you ate that food.

47
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,100
He dropped it. He dropped it. It's on the ground.
