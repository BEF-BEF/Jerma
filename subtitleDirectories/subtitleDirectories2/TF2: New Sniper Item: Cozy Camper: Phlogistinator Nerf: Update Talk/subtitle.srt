00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,609
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:16,609
And tonight, we got a couple of things to discuss tonight.

3
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:21,609
Well, first of all, there's a new update. And the new update brought a new sniper item.

4
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:27,609
Kind of weird in my opinion. Why did they do this? Why not just release a bunch of stuff?

5
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:31,609
Why release one item? Just, oh, here's an item for the sniper, there you go.

6
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:34,609
I don't know, I don't really agree with the item release schedule.

7
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:40,850
But, regardless of all that, we did get a new item, the Cozy Camper.

8
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,850
And this is a backpack. This is not like a miscellaneous item, this is not like a hat or something.

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,850
This goes right on your back, where the razor back, where the Darwin's Danger Shield goes.

10
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,850
It's an unlockable, and it is craftable.

11
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,850
So the blueprint's gonna be on the screen right now. It actually doesn't take very much.

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,850
So you can probably craft this right now if you have the materials.

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,849
But anyways, no flinching when aiming, and knockback reduced by 20% when aiming.

14
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,849
So what this means is when you are zoomed in, you are not gonna take flinching fire damage.

15
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:12,849
Because all we all know, when you get lit on fire, I'll show you in a second here.

16
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:18,849
When you get lit on fire, that tick tick tick tick, it makes your mouse cursor move up and down really annoyingly.

17
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:26,090
And when you get hit by anything, if you get hit by a rocket, if you get hit by spam, you're not gonna move at all.

18
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,090
Which brings me to the bad part of this weapon.

19
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,090
60% slower movement speed when you're aiming.

20
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,090
So essentially when you have this thing zoomed in, you're a slug.

21
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,090
And you cannot move really at all, and it really, really, really is very annoying.

22
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,090
Especially, especially if there is another sniper on the enemy team.

23
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,260
Because when you're zoomed in with this thing, you almost stand completely still.

24
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,260
Any sniper that's paying attention will be able to kill you so easily with this on.

25
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,260
Not to mention spies. Oh my god.

26
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,260
You are just a spy magnet with this thing on.

27
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,259
Because it doesn't block anything. This does not block a backstab, this does not block anything.

28
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:14,259
It just gives you the ability to not flinch when you're taking damage.

29
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,699
Alright, so now that we got the bad out of the way, let's talk about the good.

30
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,870
So what this thing does, this allows you to be a more aggressive sniper.

31
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,870
You don't have to run away from fights anymore, you don't have to back up.

32
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,870
Oh he's getting too close, I gotta run away. You don't have to do that anymore.

33
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:38,870
Now you can just stand where you are and plant shots on people regardless of if they are shooting you or not.

34
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:45,110
Because back in the day, and when I say back in the day I mean yesterday before this update came out,

35
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,110
you had to be really, really conscious of who was shooting you.

36
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,110
Because obviously it screwed up your aim.

37
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,110
I can't tell you how many times I would be aiming as a sniper.

38
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,110
And I would lose my aim because a scout 500 feet away was shooting me with a pistol or something.

39
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,419
That is eliminated with this setup.

40
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:04,419
And I suggest you try, it doesn't take a whole lot to craft like I said, so give it a go.

41
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:09,979
So anyways, the next part of this video is going to talk about the Flogistinator.

42
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:11,979
And the nerf it just received.

43
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:14,979
And really, I don't agree with this nerf.

44
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:19,979
And it's not because I don't think this weapon needs to be changed, because it really does.

45
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,979
I just don't think you can slap minus 10% damage on something and go, okay that's fixed.

46
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:28,150
No, this thing needs to be totally redesigned.

47
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:34,330
I think if you remove the taunt invincibility and change the crit mechanic a little bit,

48
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,330
make it so it was 8 seconds rather than 12 or 10, because right now the nerf, I didn't even tell you the nerf,

49
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,330
the nerf is minus 10% damage and 10 seconds of crit rather than 12 seconds of crit.

50
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,500
Now that's great, but again, I said it's sort of a band-aid fix.

51
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,500
They need to redo this weapon, change it completely, give it a compression blast,

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
because I don't think the no compression blast works on any of the flamethrowers.

53
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,500
It didn't work out well on the back burner, and they got rid of it.

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,680
So we'll see what they do.

55
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,680
Hopefully they continue to tweak things, because they always do that anyway,

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,680
so I'm confident in their tweaking abilities.

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,180
So now before this video is over, I want to go over my TF2 modeling adventure I've kind of gone off on,

58
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,180
because I have got a couple of PMs.

59
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,180
People are wondering, Jerma, what's the story with your Steam Workshop stuff?

60
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,180
Are you still doing that?

61
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,180
The answer is yes I am.

62
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,180
I'm currently talking to a pretty talented guy.

63
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,180
He's a nice dude.

64
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,180
He already has a couple of things on the workshop already.

65
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:35,180
I'll get into that at a later date, because I don't want to give away any of the potential information that we're working on.

66
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,180
So yes, I have been in contact with a modeler, and I'll give you one hint.

67
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,180
I'm going to give you guys one hint on what we're working on.

68
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,350
It is not a weapon, and it is for the heavy.

69
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,589
So there you go.

70
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:51,959
Let the speculation run wild as to what I'm working on right now.

71
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,959
So this is going to be the end of the video, guys.

72
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,959
Thank you all so much for watching.

73
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,959
I really do appreciate it, and I will see you guys all next time.

74
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,139
So take care, everybody.
