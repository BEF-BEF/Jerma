00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,129
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight, not exactly sure what I'm going to be playing as.

2
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:24,129
I'm going to be playing as one of the nine classes, I assume. Maybe even the tenth class, the Indian Chiefmaster.

3
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:30,300
I have no idea. So this video is not going to talk about Team Fortress 2. It's going to be a discussion video.

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,299
It's going to be something that was brought up last night when I was hanging out in Star's stream.

5
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,299
If you were there, then you probably know what this commentary is going to be about.

6
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:43,299
But if you weren't there, let me briefly bring this up.

7
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:48,039
We were playing a game in Alpha, and it's called Cannon Brawl. It's pretty fun.

8
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:55,039
It's a 1v1 type of Worms RTS hybrid base building tower shooting game, and it's great. I suggest you pick it up.

9
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,280
It's like less than ten bucks. If you got the money, you and your friend can have at least a few hours of fun.

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,709
Regardless of any of that, a couple of developers were actually in the stream chat.

11
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:09,709
The guys that made the game were hanging out in Star's stream.

12
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:12,709
We got to talking with them. They were legitimate. They weren't making it up.

13
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:16,709
It wasn't like, oh yeah, I'm the developer. And it just wasn't them. It was actually them.

14
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,709
Which was cool in itself. I love talking to developers.

15
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:25,709
I love seeing where they're coming from, seeing their angles, finding out stuff about them, the backstory, etc.

16
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:31,950
And that kind of conversation got into people talking about in the comment section how much they hate certain developers

17
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,950
because they don't do certain things, they have bad customer support, and screw them. Like, fuck EA.

18
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,950
And that's the topic of this discussion. That's the topic of this video. That's where I want to go with this.

19
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:54,609
Because when you say something like, in quotes, fuck EA, end quotes, what you're effectively saying is this.

20
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:58,609
At least, for the most part, this is what people mean when they utter this phrase.

21
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:02,609
What they're really talking about is the consumer-company relationship.

22
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:05,780
And the consumer-company relationship can mean a million different things.

23
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,780
It can mean the amount of money you have to spend on something.

24
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,780
It can mean who's in charge that's making broad spectrum company decisions.

25
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,219
It could mean how the company reacts to negative criticism or positive criticism.

26
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:23,219
It can mean a bunch of different things.

27
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:29,580
But a lot of people really, really get upset with, and I'm in this category myself, I'm included in this,

28
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,580
I get really mad at a company when they blatantly just mishandle the stuff I just said.

29
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,889
For instance, when a company charges way too much money for something, it annoys me.

30
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:43,889
When a company doesn't follow through on promises it makes, it annoys me.

31
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:49,129
When a company has a CEO that's like a complete dickwad, that annoys me.

32
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:55,300
But something that we all have to keep in mind is it's not just one guy that makes a video game.

33
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,300
It's not just one dude that is making all these decisions for this company.

34
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,300
There are thousands and thousands of people that are working for EA.

35
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,610
There are artists, there are programmers, there are coders, there are marketing people, there are advertising people,

36
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,610
there are people on the board.

37
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,219
If it's just one person you don't like, then do you really hate the company?

38
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:21,219
Or do you hate the person that's in charge?

39
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:25,219
Or do you hate this one particular person on the development team?

40
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:28,219
I'm going to give you a real situation of this.

41
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:30,219
For instance, Diablo III.

42
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:34,650
Diablo III was one of my most anticipated games ever.

43
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,650
Like, I was waiting so much for that game, I couldn't wait for it to come out.

44
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,650
The second it came out, I bought it like midnight release, let's go, I'm going to spend like 30 hours playing this game straight.

45
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,449
And I had a little bit of fun in D3.

46
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:49,449
I enjoyed myself.

47
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:59,449
But after a while, it started to really annoy me that the developers took this game such in a far direction away from one of my favorite games of all time, which is Diablo II.

48
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:07,449
I made a review of Diablo III, and I even said, if you're a die-hard Diablo II fan, this game's going to let you down in a lot of places.

49
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:14,009
And it really got me thinking, do I hate Blizzard for making Diablo III the way they did?

50
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:20,009
I guess maybe there'd be a couple of rage moments when I was sitting in a game going, man, like, I hate Blizzard.

51
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,009
What the hell, man? Like, what did you do to this game?

52
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:24,009
Like, how could you, Blizzard?

53
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:27,009
In quotes, just like the same EA, how could you?

54
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,009
Fuck you, EA.

55
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:33,439
But then you break it down even more and it's like, but who, who was even really responsible for this?

56
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,439
It was not Blizzard as a whole.

57
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,439
It was only like a few guys in Blizzard that probably made these decisions.

58
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,439
The StarCraft guys didn't do it.

59
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:45,439
The friggin' Warcraft team had nothing to do with it.

60
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,439
So why would I hate Blizzard as a company when it only was a couple of people that really had the say?

61
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:58,050
And something else to keep in mind is most of the people that work for these companies, guys, are just going to work.

62
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,050
They're just going to work and they're doing their thing and they're going home and they're going home to their family.

63
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,050
They're working their ass off as a programmer or an artist or a coder or a concept designer.

64
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,050
And then they leave and they go home to their families.

65
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,050
And they don't read forum posts about how much people hate the company that they work for.

66
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,050
Hell, they might not even like the company they work for, but they're doing it anyways.

67
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:31,980
And my whole point here is when you make a generalization about really anything, you include all the people that you really didn't mean to include when you made the generalization.

68
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,980
So just keep that in mind.

69
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,980
It's something that we were talking about in the stream.

70
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,980
And I was like, you know what?

71
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,980
I want to make a commentary about this.

72
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,980
I want to see what everybody has to say.

73
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,980
So please in the comments section below, leave what you think about this.

74
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:53,980
Leave your opinions on this and maybe some generalizations that you've made over the last couple of years, because I know I've done plenty of them when it comes to game companies for sure.

75
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,410
But yeah, that's going to wrap it up here, guys.

76
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,410
Thank you all so much for watching.

77
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,410
I really do appreciate it.

78
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,410
And I'll see you guys all next time.

79
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,410
And of course, take care, everybody.
