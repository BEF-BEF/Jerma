00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,940
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Super Meat Boy Mondays, Chapter 6, which is going to be the end.

2
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:29,109
Now this is, this may or may not be the final Meat Boy video I make. I know there's the Dark World stuff, there's Cotton Alley, there is the Warp Zones, Character Unlocks, Band-Aids.

3
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:37,109
I know there's all that stuff in here, but I'm not sure if I'm going to do it or not. I might and I might not. I'm going to leave that pretty much totally up to you guys.

4
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:48,109
And I guess we'll just go from there. So if you want to see more Meat Boy, let me know in the comments and let me know with a like or a favorite or something like that so I can determine if you guys want to see more of this series.

5
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:53,229
So we're just going to keep going here. Super Meat Boy, Chapter 6, the end.

6
00:00:53,229 --> 00:01:02,920
Dancing around like a freak show. Hey, quit dancing, you piece of crap. No, I'm not going to stop dancing. And I have your girlfriend too. What are you going to do about it?

7
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:20,430
The end. This is the end. Okay, there are only five levels in the end. So this hopefully does not take 60,000 years, but it probably will because this game is so goddamn hard.

8
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:33,010
Let's just go here. Let's beat this in 10 minutes. What do you say? There's no way that's going to happen. Is he here? Oh, it's locked. It's locked. Okay. Got to go around, I believe.

9
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:48,469
No, I don't. What was I supposed to do down here? Oh, there's the key. Okay. Oh, that's how you take down the wall over there. It's all coming back to me now.

10
00:01:48,469 --> 00:02:07,450
Jump over, get the key over here. That opens up the wall over this side. This way. Okay, okay. Cheese, it's in gravy. All right there. Woohoo. So far so good. Oh, I can't do anything careless here though.

11
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:24,500
I, I'm, I, just go. I can do this. This level isn't even that bad. Come on, Meat Boy.

12
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:44,569
Epic music. Epic music is going to make me win. Over this way. It's over here. Be careful of the saw blades. They will kill you. They have been known to do that.

13
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:59,099
I just don't do anything stupid here like you just did. No, I got to stop jumping with it. And right now. Whoa, that was close.

14
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:17,270
All right, how many people died? How many did we lose? Only two or three. Here's the vector right here. Nice job. There you are. Woohoo. Schism. Schism. I don't even know how you say that word.

15
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:36,689
I will protect your honor. I will defend you to the day I die. My lady. My beautiful, sweet lady. I will complete this for you. Oh, jeez.

16
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:47,009
You just got to drop straight down this. I don't know why I'm trying to do something tricky with that. Same thing here. There's no need to be so nuts about it.

17
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:57,770
Now, if I remember correctly, it's easier to jump off of this and I could be totally wrong, but I don't think I am. Judging by me completing that, I don't think I was wrong.

18
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:15,289
Shoot me in the face with a machine gun. Just put like an entire god. All right, just be easy. It's only the second level. Be easy here. Can't freak out.

19
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:33,779
There we are. Super Meat Boy, baby. There's the key. I got to go back up. Oh my god. Oh my god. What am I doing? What did I drop? What did I drop down right there? What an idiot.

20
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:51,069
Oh my god. I can't believe I did. Oh my god. Just go. Just jump, you piece of crap. I'm going to drop a piano on your head if you do that again.

21
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:58,810
Am I talking introspectively? Am I speaking to myself when I say that? Who am I talking to when I say that? Okay, we're good.

22
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:08,790
Who's going to get the piano dropped on their head? Is it going to be like me? You? No, I wouldn't do that to you. Why would I do that to you? That wouldn't make a whole lot of sense.

23
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:24,009
No, don't go down there again. Just go down nice and slow like this. There we are. That'll do it. Okay, jeez. Here we go. There we are.

24
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:43,399
Okay, now just be careful here. You don't want to do anything ridiculous. Can't screw this up. Just like that. I'll take the pie and I'll eat it too.

25
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:57,610
How many died in the very beginning here? One dude? Who got the piano dropped on them? That's what I want to know. You don't see that anymore.

26
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:06,790
Nobody drops pianos on anybody anymore. See, back in the old days of cartoons, people used to get pianos dropped on their heads. Not anymore though.

27
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:31,949
Piano. Even the name is funny. Piano. It's so amusing. Oh, you get crushed by the thing, you elevator bastard. That was very unconventional how I just got that.

28
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:40,860
That's not how you're supposed to get that at all. But you know what? It works. If it works, then just take it. Get it and run. No, it's the exact same.

29
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:50,740
I'm doing a carbon copy of the same thing I just did a second ago. Okay, easy. There's only a few levels here.

30
00:06:51,740 --> 00:07:00,050
You're going to spend the majority of the damn time on the boss anyways, because the boss is really difficult. Okay, let's think of it like a clock.

31
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:12,079
And you're going to get it right there. Freeze. You're good. Just be smart. Don't do anything stupid.

32
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:27,480
Let's keep it rolling. Just go. Speedrun. Speedrun. Oh, you thought you could mess with the speedrun. It's actually working. Speedrun's working.

33
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:36,689
Wow. Okay, I just went through half of that level right there in a speedrun. I did not expect to survive past that halfway point.

34
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:49,399
What's up here? You want to be able to see? Because I forget. And I don't want to have to speedrun again. Oh, baby, that was a beauty if I say so myself.

35
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:59,540
This is it. After this, we are at the blast boss of the game. Well, technically of the storyline of the Meat Boy storyline.

36
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:19,079
Now you and God's jeez. Trump down maybe. Oh, my God, that hurt. That hurt to do that. Yikes.

37
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:33,220
Oh, wow. Wow. I am. Oh, this is difficult. I remember this. You got to be very, very careful here. Oh, I did it too early.

38
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:44,279
God damn it. I would have did that in first try. Oh, no. Madden. I'm getting all over the place. Oh, back at the beginning back.

39
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,279
You know what? Just fall off. It's stuck from scratch here again.

40
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:58,659
And we're going to speedrun because last time I speedrun it worked. Maybe not. Just when you just get over there, you piece of crap.

41
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:13,179
Speedrun. It's all about just speeding. Forget the speedrun. Not going to work. Up, up and away.

42
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:21,539
No. What the hell? Will you? Will you stop doing that? Just get through the hole.

43
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:31,379
I had it the first time and I'm just a stupid idiot. And I got too busy scratching my ass or whatever the hell I was doing.

44
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:36,500
I don't know how I would scratch my ass with, you know, my hands on the controller, but whatever.

45
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:50,820
Now I forget how I just did this part. Now I don't. Just jump right through. Same thing here. Just this time. Don't be. Don't be a butt scratcher.

46
00:09:50,820 --> 00:10:14,779
Key. Oh, oh, oh, damn. That was near the end of the level too. Time to be quiet.

47
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:19,139
We all know what happens when I be quiet. I complete levels that are difficult.

48
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:44,220
There we are. Just don't do that again. Oh, okay.

49
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:53,299
Here is the last boss, Dr. Fetus. Here we go, guys. Where is he? I'm gonna find him.

50
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:59,860
Yeah, yeah, you're not gonna come near me because I'll show you what a bazooka. You know what this is? It's a bazooka, you bastard.

51
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:06,860
Yeah, you're dead now. Maybe you're not. Yeah, he's dead. Wait, what? Get out of here. Now he's dead.

52
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:12,860
What the hell? Will you just get? God, he's gonna kill me. This thing is jammed. This thing doesn't even work.

53
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,860
Why'd I spend $5,000 on this thing? It's worthless. Come here. Let's go.

54
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,860
The whole point of this is you gotta beat Dr. Fetus. You can't get killed by his missiles or his rockets and you gotta kill him.

55
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:30,429
Oh my God, I am so nervous. Doctor? Doctor? Doctor? Please? Doctor?

56
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:39,559
Oh my God, I didn't realize what was happening. Okay. Didn't realize that was happening. Oh, great. Oh, great.

57
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:48,200
Come on, shoot me. Shoot me, doctor. Shoot me, el doctor. Danke, el doctor.

58
00:11:48,200 --> 00:12:02,090
Make it over here. Gotta move. Gotta move. He's gonna start shooting. Oh man, this is bad.

59
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:16,960
Oh, this is bad. Whoa. This is bad. Oh man, oh man.

60
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:29,690
Oh come on, I'm almost there. Get up. Get up there. Oh no. Oh.

61
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:37,769
Damn it. I was at the end. I was near the end. I was...

62
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:44,769
Fotted my face and called me Dave Stevenson. Oh my God. I'm so mad right now.

63
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:52,139
I'm so... I am so mad right now. Just take it easy. This is not even that difficult. I can do this with my eyes closed.

64
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:59,139
That is an untrue statement. Let's pretend I didn't say that. Imagine playing this game with your eyes closed.

65
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:09,039
It would not be possible. I want to see a guy do a let's play of this game with their eyes closed and have a face cam. Whoa.

66
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:23,070
Careful here. He's gonna start shooting that stupid rocket launcher. This part was horrible. I can't believe I made it through this part.

67
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:36,269
I had it. I had it the very first time I tried this. I had it. Oh man.

68
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:45,179
Just go. You gotta stay in front of him. That's the major thing. If I can stay in front of him, I can do this.

69
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:53,100
Believe in yourself. You gotta believe that was why you...

70
00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:02,889
Alright, time to do this. No more messing around. I'm doing this right now.

71
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:21,169
Silent. It's all about just memorization. I'm playing that game where you flip the cards over and you memorize everything.

72
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:33,129
Oh, somebody just texted me. Too bad. It's not as important as not dying in this level. It could be, though. That's the thing.

73
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:40,340
Back where I was before. Okay. Nice and easy here.

74
00:14:40,340 --> 00:15:04,700
Oh! Hit that thing! Gotta hit that thing! Oh my god, I did it! No!

75
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,259
Oh man, that looked like it hurt. I know.

76
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,570
I'm sorry about everything.

77
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,179
Oh my, that was pretty morbid. Let's get out of here, sweetheart. Let's go get a drink. Yeah, let's go get it.

78
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:31,539
I'm not dead yet. F you. My final request is for you to die.

79
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:35,779
Oh, now we gotta get out of here. We gotta run. Come on, let's go, sweetheart.

80
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:46,990
I forgot that this was actually the last level. And it's really hard.

81
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:14,059
So, ow. I just hit my thumb. Man, this is very, very difficult. Time to be quiet again.

82
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:22,779
Oh, shoot me in the face. I've already said that, but still. Let's go, honey.

83
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:27,019
Oh man, somebody's probably texting me right now like,

84
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,019
Hey, Jeremy, your house is on fire. I'm standing outside looking at it.

85
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,779
And I'm just like, I can't talk right now.

86
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,779
Uh, Jeremy, there's a tornado about to come to your house.

87
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,940
How did I not die at that? Okay, let's go here.

88
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:01,179
Oh, now somebody's calling me. My duck call.

89
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,180
Hold on, I gotta answer this. This is like my mother.

90
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:10,480
Okay, so the house is not on fire, but my mother was just like, needed to talk to me.

91
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,900
It's okay. Let's get back into this. Go, go, go.

92
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,140
Nope. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

93
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:32,559
God, I'm going to puke. Up, up and away.

94
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,819
If I could just get by this one stupid pot. Like that. Okay, now be easy here.

95
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:46,609
Oh, let me look at this. I just said I wanted to look at it and I didn't even look at it.

96
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:49,609
I just went, I didn't even think. I just went, just go.

97
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:57,390
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

98
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:04,740
Be careful. You don't want to freak out here.

99
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,990
Got to drop right now.

100
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:18,099
Wow. It's so long. It's so ridiculous. I'm going to throw up.

101
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:28,230
Once it goes around one more time.

102
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:37,099
I thought I beat the game. I forgot about this part.

103
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:42,109
This very long, very awful part of the game.

104
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:47,829
Okay, I got through that. I'm good with that.

105
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:50,829
This part's not that bad. I just got to go now. Jump over it twice.

106
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:55,140
Wait till it goes. Go. Go up here.

107
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,440
This part, you just kind of slug your way over this way.

108
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,539
Up here. Risky, I know, but I had to do that.

109
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:11,240
No more thinking. Just go.

110
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:26,109
Never made that noise before.

111
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:29,670
Son of a bitch. This is so hard.

112
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,420
Dark World? Can you imagine this on the Dark World?

113
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Blood's going to come out of my eyes if I play this on the Dark World.

114
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:42,400
I should just, what am I thinking here?

115
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
I can just skip this.

116
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,160
Wow. Okay. That's good to know.

117
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
I'll remember that for next time.

118
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:59,289
Easy up there. These are just saw blades.

119
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:02,420
These are just saw blades. You can do this.

120
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,420
Just saw blades.

121
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,309
Just go easy through the saw blades. That's all you got to do.

122
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,700
And don't just skip those.

123
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,500
I did it. At the end.

124
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,130
We did it, sweetheart. I'm so happy.

125
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,130
Come on, hurry up. What are you doing?

126
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,130
Oh no, this thing's falling everywhere. I can't get out of here.

127
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,690
Oh no. Oh.

128
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,700
He's dead.

129
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,579
No. I got you, man. Just get out of here.

130
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:38,579
Go with your girlfriend.

131
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:40,579
Wow, thanks. You're the best.

132
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:43,579
No, just forget about me, man. I got this.

133
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:44,579
Oh, but...

134
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:47,579
No, man. Just go with her.

135
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:52,500
I love you both.

136
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
That's him dying.

137
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:00,259
Well, Meat Boy and his girlfriend decided to go to Paradise Island after this.

138
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,809
To see their honeymoon.

139
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:07,809
The Dr. Fetus was killed during the collapse of his lair.

140
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,180
And Pooh Boy saved the day as well.

141
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,740
So I guess we can say one earlier.

142
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,740
I'm back to kill you. You stupid bitch. I'll kill you. I'll rip your eyeballs out.

143
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,910
Super Meat Boy. The end.

144
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:25,480
Oh, goodness gracious. Oh my god.

145
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,980
Okay. Well, thank you guys so much for watching the series.

146
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,150
I very, very much appreciate it.

147
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,150
And like I said in the beginning, if you want to see this continue,

148
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,150
if you want to see some of the warp zones, more of the characters unlocks,

149
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,150
some Dark Zone stuff, or Dark World stuff,

150
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,150
then just leave me a comment, let me know, or leave me a like on this video,

151
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,150
and we will go from there.

152
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,150
So, I guess we'll just let this play out.

153
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,150
Thank you guys so much for watching.

154
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,150
And I'll see you guys all next time.

155
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,329
And of course, take care, everybody.
