00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:12,140
Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with a live Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,190
Tonight I'm going to be playing as the squirrel, and let's just play.

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:27,730
There we go. Whoa! Don't scare me like that, man. Don't scare me like that.

4
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:33,500
Let me try and get around everybody. That's all I want to do.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:41,710
You think I'm still in here? No, I ran away. Probably a sentry right here. I would be shocked if there wasn't.

6
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:52,350
I would be shocked. No, no, no, no, no! Don't get stuck in the door!

7
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,750
Sentry? I don't know. I don't think so. I'm just gonna do it just to be careful.

8
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:07,049
No, there isn't. Okay. Well, don't be spotted. Maybe I can get like three scout backstabs here.

9
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:19,439
Well, that was kind of. Sort of. Sort of. I'm gonna go with sort of. I'm gonna go with maybe.

10
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:28,530
What is this guy doing? Uh-oh, we got a fight. We got a melee fight. Who's gonna win the melee fight? Soldier or Spy?

11
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,420
Soldier or Spy? Oh! I turned right into that.

12
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,780
I was too busy paying attention to the fucking pay-per-view Soldier versus Spy match.

13
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,900
It only cost me like 60 bucks pay-per-view to see that. Was it worth it? Bet your ass it was.

14
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:55,010
Move on. You, I thought you were a Spy, but you weren't.

15
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,620
Drink it!

16
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:09,139
That's a great screen. Huh? Are we gonna win? I think.

17
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:17,949
Ladies and gentlemen, we have won the game. Not yet. Almost. Yes. Yes. Yes.

18
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:20,509
Here comes your scramble!

19
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:28,780
Hmm, you know, I guess. Are you guys all real? You're all real. Then fine.

20
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:35,610
It's all right. We're just gonna play on the red team and your red scout on the red team.

21
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,909
This sniper is trying to shoot me. Don't shoot me.

22
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:46,569
Time to be a creep and creep up behind this sniper.

23
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:57,580
All right, I'll walk in his face. That works too. And this scout, you think you can beat a red scout on a red team?

24
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,909
You get away. Everybody, I made it out alive.

25
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:08,669
Fucking Mini-Sentry almost kills me.

26
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:12,879
No, no, no, no, no, no.

27
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:21,900
Where is he? God, I don't know how I'm staying alive like this.

28
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:29,129
Hmm, I can't really go head on here.

29
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:34,939
I can't really do much. I have to wait till they move or I could just go right at them.

30
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:47,229
There we go. Now I can overheal. Now I'm not as scared as I just was.

31
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:56,139
There it is. What? They can't. Oh, okay. All right. Okay.

32
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:03,219
Son of a bitch. I thought I had that guy, but I didn't.

33
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:09,750
Move away. Um, all righty.

34
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,120
Just stop them here for 10 minutes. Ain't gonna be that long.

35
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:24,180
I keep on just barely not getting the last Mini-Sentry again.

36
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:33,290
Please don't kill me. One.

37
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:40,120
Okay. All right. We'll just respawn. We'll do it all over again.

38
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:48,660
And we'll just spawn right now. I'll come out with my delicious soda.

39
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,019
I'm not going to drink it. I want to save it because I'm going to a movie later and I want to have a soda for the movie.

40
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:59,899
But you can't bring like sodas into the movie. Otherwise they get like mad at you.

41
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:06,879
All right. Well, it doesn't matter. I'm not having a soda for the fucking movie.

42
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,879
