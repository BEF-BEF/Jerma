00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,260
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Scout.

2
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,260
So what I want to talk about in this video is about the new update. Yes, if you don't know, we just got a new update.

3
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,260
If you've been living underneath a rock like Patrick Stewart Star, then you won't know this.

4
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,259
But we got a major update to TF2, a lot of new Man vs. Machine stuff, and a few balance changes to weapons.

5
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:36,259
But I'm not going to really cover all the content in the update.

6
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:41,259
I'm going to cover what I think this update means for us as a Team Fortress community.

7
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:46,259
And right off the bat, the first thing that we need to talk about here is this.

8
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:51,689
This is the second content update that we've received to this game in the last two months.

9
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:58,990
When was the last time they did anything like this? When was the last time we got two content updates sort of back to back in a row?

10
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,990
That has not happened in probably like two years.

11
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,299
And just around the corner, guys, are the holidays.

12
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:12,540
There has always been a TF2 update to coincide with the holiday season.

13
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,540
Now this could be the update that we're looking at right here, but I don't think so.

14
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,540
There's always been something there a week before Christmas, usually at the week of the 20th to 21st.

15
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,540
That's when they add a holiday-themed update, and it's happened every year without fail.

16
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,780
That means we're potentially going to have three updates in three months to Team Fortress 2.

17
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,209
Nobody could have ever believed that was ever going to happen.

18
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:39,209
We all thought, oh, wow, we're not getting any updates. What's going on here?

19
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:43,209
It's been like a year since we've seen anything really new to the game.

20
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:47,209
I would have believed you more if you were sitting in a room with me across and sitting on the couch.

21
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:52,209
If you told me, hey, there's going to be a TF2 update, three of them in a row in three months.

22
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:59,209
And also, aliens are going to land tomorrow, and they're going to take your whole family and turn them into fucking loaves of bread.

23
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:02,209
I probably would have been more inclined to believe the second statement.

24
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:07,700
But regardless of that, it's awesome to see that Valve is spending time in this game.

25
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:16,699
Because for the longest while now, the TF2 community has felt like an old, raggedy, broke down toy that Valve didn't want to play with anymore.

26
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:18,699
Think about when you were a kid. Think about when you were younger.

27
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,699
Think about when you were younger. You had that one toy that you really liked.

28
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:25,699
Teddy Ruxpin was the coolest stuffed animal you could have had.

29
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:29,699
You were the only guy on your street with a goddamn Teddy Ruxpin for crying out loud.

30
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,699
And then Dota 2 comes around. The Matchbox cars.

31
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:38,699
You used to remember Matchbox, power wheels. That was so cool.

32
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,699
And you loved it. And you played with that.

33
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,699
And Teddy Ruxpin just sat in the corner and kind of just cried for a while.

34
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:47,699
And then eventually, eventually you went back to that toy.

35
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,879
And eventually you picked up the Teddy Ruxpin and you said, holy hell, I remember this thing.

36
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,879
This thing was awesome. It used to say like four different phrases. That's amazing.

37
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,500
And that's kind of what the Valve team is doing right now.

38
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,500
They spent a bunch of time on the Steam box, a bunch of time in Dota 2 and all these new projects.

39
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And then they just... Toy Story. I'm explaining the plot of Toy Story.

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Valve is Andy from Toy Story and we're fucking Woody. That's what's going on here.

41
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:21,740
And at the end, at the very end of Toy Story, Andy finds out he can not only have fun with Buzz Lightyear,

42
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,740
Dota 2 and the Steam box, but he can also have fun with Woody too.

43
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,740
And it's a big happy family and the credits roll.

44
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,740
And then there's like three more movies that explain much more weird shit that who even cared about in the first place.

45
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,740
Didn't Toy Story 4 come out and Andy went to college and flunked out?

46
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,740
I don't even know what happened to that. I didn't see the movie.

47
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,180
All right, let's get back on track here now.

48
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,659
So, what these updates mean?

49
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:48,830
Think of the last three or four updates we've got to Team Fortress 2.

50
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,830
No, they haven't added any new weapons to the game.

51
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,830
And I know I've complained about this before.

52
00:03:53,830 --> 00:04:00,069
I have complained very outspokenly about how we haven't had anything really new added to the game in a long time.

53
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:05,069
And I had this realization the other day, or well, today and yesterday, because that's when the update came out,

54
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:11,379
that Valve is taking a different approach to how they're patching and content updating this game.

55
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:12,379
It goes like this.

56
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:19,860
They have added so many items to this game, so many weapons to this game that just go unused, right?

57
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:25,860
And they do a bunch of these patches where they make balance changes to these items to make people actually want to use them.

58
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,860
And that's what they did with the Baby Faces Blaster, this patch.

59
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:36,860
They're taking this approach where, sure, we could add a new weapon that's plus 20% more fire damage and you piss rainbows.

60
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,860
But who's going to use that item in the next two weeks?

61
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,860
People will equip it. You'll see a couple of videos on it.

62
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,860
But would I actually use that item in a game?

63
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,860
And usually, most of the time, the answer to that question is no.

64
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,100
So what they're doing is they're going back and they're trying to make all these items that they've added

65
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,100
that not very many people really use and try to make them actual items that people will want to use.

66
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,100
And the Baby Faces Blaster, as you're watching this video right now,

67
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,100
has been changed into an item that I would see myself using from time to time.

68
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,100
Switch out from the stock, switch out from some of the other scatter guns.

69
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,100
It's an actual usable, good scatter gun now, when before it was kind of just a gimmick item

70
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
that you would equip for a laugh every now and then.

71
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,589
Now, people did play with these before, before the big palance, the palance.

72
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,589
Before going to, like, the palace show when Valve went to the palace,

73
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:28,589
before they did all these balance changes, people still used these items.

74
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:31,589
People still ran around with the Baby Faces Blaster.

75
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:35,589
I've seen people with Hale's own Baby Faces Blasters before this update.

76
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:38,589
I'm not saying that those people, oh, yeah, fuck you.

77
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:44,149
What I'm saying is, these last few patches have been housekeeping patches,

78
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:48,149
trying to get the game up to a standard where everything is kind of usable,

79
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:52,149
everything works, everything makes sense, and there's no, like, gimmicks anymore.

80
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:56,149
There still will be, there always will be, but just not as many.

81
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:58,709
And that's going to wrap up this video.

82
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,709
I will do Man vs. Machine, you'll probably see that in the next few days with a couple of friends.

83
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,709
I don't know, we'll see how that goes.

84
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:05,709
But those are my thoughts on this update.

85
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,709
And let me know what you think, guys. What do you think of the update?

86
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:08,709
What do you think of this stuff?

87
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,709
What do you think of, like, the recoloring of weapons that's coming soon?

88
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:12,709
There's a lot to talk about.

89
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:15,709
I just wanted to get this part of it off my chest for the time being.

90
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,709
And I'll see you guys all next time.

91
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,949
And, of course, take care, everybody.
