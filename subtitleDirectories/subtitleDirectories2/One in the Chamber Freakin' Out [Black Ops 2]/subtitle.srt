1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:20,269
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jirba here with some more One in the Chamber, Call of Duty Black Ops 2, and away we go.

2
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:25,269
Oh Jesus, right off the bat I turned the corner. Oh, you bastard, he was lying on the ground.

3
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:33,869
I'll make a note of that. I'll make a mental note of that. You son of a bitch.

4
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:42,820
Something going on in this- Whoa, what the hell? That guy just teleported! That guy just teleported through my screen!

5
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
That guy, what the hell was that?

6
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,189
Alright, gotta get my bearings here.

7
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,969
That's a bad shot, I'm not taking that.

8
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,909
Let's find my way back downstairs.

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,439
They could be anywhere.

10
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:11,980
There's a guy up here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come here.

11
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:18,579
Where the- Damn!

12
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,950
Don't shoot me!

13
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,950
Get it! No, there's another guy!

14
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,510
No, there's not. Yeah, there is!

15
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,629
Damn it! Damn it, crouch!

16
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,629
Here he comes, ready?

17
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:34,469
It actually worked!

18
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,310
It actually worked.

19
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,739
I can't even think.

20
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,739
Too many things going on in my brain.

21
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:46,519
Whoa, what the hell? I just like, panic knifed.

22
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:51,819
Oh boy.

23
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:54,629
Oh boy, oh.

24
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,519
What? He's still running.

25
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,340
The guy back here, I'm gonna try and just-

26
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,219
God, I didn't make one shot with-

27
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:07,159
I didn't make one shot with this freaking knife.

28
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,159
I mean, with this freaking gun.

29
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,509
I gotta- I need to- I could still win this.

30
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:18,500
Just gotta play smart. There's only two guys here.

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,319
Time to play smart. Here we go.

32
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,620
Smart German, here we go.

33
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,810
Wow, that guy's just sitting right there.

34
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,289
Oh, what do you know about that one?

35
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:40,759
Bastard.

36
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,759
Is that him? That's him!

37
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,259
What?

38
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:47,740
No! No!

39
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,060
I don't think I've played on this map yet.

40
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,750
This is one of the only ones that nobody ever plays on.

41
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,000
Maybe I have. Let's go.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,319
This map is big, too. This is a big map.

43
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,439
This is gonna be tough.

44
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:17,580
Damn it. That guy's got a bullet.

45
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,479
Freak him out. It worked.

46
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,939
Wow. Hey, man. Whoa.

47
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,750
Big map. Big casualties.

48
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,270
I got ya. I still got ya.

49
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,860
I got ya. Whoa, a guy behind me.

50
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,819
No reason to freak out.

51
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,819
No reason to freak out. No reason to-

52
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,819
Geez! Louise!

53
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,639
Oh my goodness. People are everywhere.

54
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,639
Oh, there's a guy behind me, too.

55
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,819
Get out of my face!

56
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,819
Let's go down. I got three bullets here.

57
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,819
Just calm down, Jerma. Just calm down.

58
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,060
You don't gotta freak out.

59
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,060
You got three shots in this gun.

60
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,500
You got the upper hand. There we go.

61
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,939
See this guy right here? This guy's toast, too.

62
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,560
If I could- He's probably gonna-

63
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm scared. I am legitimately scared to go around this corner.

64
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,980
Here's a guy right here. Come on.

65
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,930
Show yourself. Oh, this guy's doing a ring

66
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,279
around the Rosie with me.

67
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,310
Come on, man! Come on!

68
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,959
No! And he got the kill!

69
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,529
Oh!

70
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,529
Ashes, ashes. We all freakin'

71
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,279
fall down, apparently.

72
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,279
I'm gonna shoot that guy in his head

73
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:50,550
when I get the chance. Is anybody even over here?

74
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,750
There's only one dude. I got one life.

75
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,930
What? What is going on in this room?

76
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,930
Why are there two guys just, like, hanging out in here?

77
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,189
What the hell is going on in here?

78
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:03,620
What on earth-

79
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,459
What on earth is happening in this room?

80
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,459
Those two guys are just, like, sitting there

81
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:13,430
having tea. Alright.

82
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,779
I'm on my last life now.

83
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:21,050
I'm gonna die. There's one guy in here.

84
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,250
Yeah. Show your- Put your head

85
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,879
through that door. What?

86
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,569
Oh, man. Oh, man!

87
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:33,639
No! No! No!

88
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,639
Oh, I lose!

89
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,639
Well, not technically

90
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,639
no. Let's see. I got nine kills.

91
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,819
Yeah, nobody could pass that right now.

92
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,819
The next guy below me has three.

93
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,819
So, yeah, I'm going to win

94
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,819
this game. Let's think about one of the chamber.

95
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,819
You can kill, like, five or six

96
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,819
people in a row and then die three times in a row

97
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,250
and still win the game, so it's pretty cool.

98
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,490
Anyways, let's see how this ends. Let's go, man!

99
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,199
Hey, look, chickpeas!

100
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,850
I can't believe I died. I would have

101
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,850
been, like, 12 and 0 if I didn't screw up in one place.

102
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,850
But there was, like, two guys

103
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,850
camping in the same room. What the hell was that

104
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,339
all about? Ban them all, boot it, get them

105
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,860
out of here. Let's close it out on the cruise

106
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,259
level. Time to take a cruise.

107
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,420
Okay, we got a guy right here.

108
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,490
And we got a guy over there, too.

109
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,750
Two guys. Don't be too crazy.

110
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,629
Don't be too crazy.

111
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:36,279
Don't be too...

112
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,800
Why did I do that?

113
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,920
What the hell?

114
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
The knife went... Get up the stairs!

115
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
There's a guy coming up. Oh, God!

116
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

117
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,300
He's coming! No, he's not.

118
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,370
Oh, what? Come on!

119
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,990
Oh, Lord!

120
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,230
I don't know how those knives...

121
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,230
How are these knives not hitting?

122
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,230
I mean,

123
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,230
I have a three bar, but that's not

124
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,240
that bad.

125
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Dude, those knives were going into, like,

126
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
the abyss. It's as if I wasn't even hitting

127
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,319
the button. It's alright.

128
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,319
We'll push through here. We'll push through.

129
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,839
Wow! I shouldn't even knife

130
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,550
anybody anymore.

131
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,709
I should just put the knife away.

132
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:32,709
Last guy, last guy, last guy.

133
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:35,139
Hello there!

134
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,449
Mr. Guy!

135
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,779
Moment of truth! The knife!

136
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,779
Alright, I'm gonna get this guy right now.

137
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:50,810
I'm not gonna use the knife.

138
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,709
Oh, it doesn't even matter.

139
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,709
The knife prevails!

140
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,980
Oh, my goodness.

141
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,980
Alright, well, that's gonna wrap it up here, guys.

142
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,980
Thank you so much for watching. I really do

143
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,980
appreciate it. And I'll see you all next time.

144
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,149
And of course, take care, everybody.

145
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:10,149
Connection interrupted!
