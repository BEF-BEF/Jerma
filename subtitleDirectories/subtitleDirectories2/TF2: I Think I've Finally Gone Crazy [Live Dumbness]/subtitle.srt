1
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:05,530
I'm so glad that I got killed by a default demoman.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,410
All right, say default demoman as fast as you possibly can.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,539
Default demoman.

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,380
No, it has to be like, it has to be like default demoman. Let's be perfect.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,419
Default demoman.

6
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:18,969
Default demoman. Default demoman. Default demoman.

7
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,809
This almost sounds like I'm gonna have to put effort into it.

8
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:23,670
Default demoman. Default demoman.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,739
Default demoman. I'm gonna do this.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,280
That's wrong with me. No, get away from me, baby.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,039
Oh, are you gonna...

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:56,250
Oh, sentry? You want to get sentry'd?

13
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,530
Son of a bitch!

14
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,500
Oh my god, rampage.

15
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,140
This is another sentry gun.

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,689
God, there's so many sentry guns. This game sucks.

17
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,250
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here, Covenant Piss right now.

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,290
Covenant P, Covenant Poo.

19
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,530
We're going to be doing a live commentary right here.

20
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,450
Playing on the map CP, Gravel Pit.

21
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,849
Got Mrs. Buttsack gonna be healing me for this round.

22
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,450
Gonna be live shellcasting, like I said.

23
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,730
And here we go. We got the first point here.

24
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,769
We got a sniper coming out of the corner.

25
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:29,370
We got a B. Now the A is being captured.

26
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,170
Now B is being captured.

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,530
I got the quick fix Uber right here.

28
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,569
Trying to get this Pyro off the point.

29
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:33,849
I get him. I'm getting this shot in the back.

30
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:35,129
I've got another demoman coming from the side.

31
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,810
It's unfortunate that he was not able to get through here.

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,849
There's a sentry gun here.

33
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:40,569
Two sentry guns in a really stupid dumb place, but it's okay.

34
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:41,849
Let's keep going here. I want it.

35
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:44,090
I took this part of the live shellcast out

36
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,170
because I didn't make it very much.

37
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,530
So it just...

38
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,730
Boss that medic right there, but it's okay.

39
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,849
We got a teleporter over here.

40
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,890
Oh my goodness gracious.

41
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,930
Ladies and gentlemen, we got the teleporter down.

42
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,450
We got the engineer down as well.

43
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,049
Jerma seems to know what he's doing here.

44
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,129
Oh, now he's at spawn.

45
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:59,370
What the fuck is he doing at spawn?

46
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,530
Ladies and gentlemen, he's doing some really crazy stuff right here.

47
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:19,319
You kept that going for a really long time.

48
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,680
Where the fuck did he come from?

49
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,520
I'm just like whipping this guy.

50
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:30,629
You want to get whipped?

51
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,189
Oh my God.

52
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,099
How many people can I whip?

53
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,900
Let's find out.

54
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,259
Let's find out how many people I can actually kill with the whip.

55
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:42,460
Here comes a scout.

56
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,099
Here we go.

57
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,360
Oh no, here comes Pyro.

58
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,719
No medic.

59
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:50,229
Damn it.

60
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:53,210
Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

61
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:53,849
Coming down the corridor.

62
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:54,810
He sees a sniper.

63
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,250
Huntsman sniper, by the way, which is helps out.

64
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:56,810
He hits the bait.

65
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,610
It's a crit.

66
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,409
A crit rocket.

67
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:59,610
Guy hanging on the side of the wall there.

68
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,530
We've got some really important things going on.

69
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,729
There is a soldier up top here.

70
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:03,530
Jerma gets a culture.

71
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,050
One shot with the direct hit does not get the kill.

72
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,770
Default the moon.

73
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,669
Trying to do a shoutcast and it gets ruined.

74
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,150
And did you see that air shot?

75
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,590
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll just get that right.

76
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,310
Get into this here.

77
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,590
Another devil man around a quick fix.

78
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,110
Uber, is he going to get the devil knight right there?

79
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,229
Gets one shot, two shots.

80
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:21,030
Here he comes around the corner.

81
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,909
Gets the shotgun.

82
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,349
One, two, and a three.

83
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:24,069
Third time's a charm.

84
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:24,949
Pyro going after the medic.

85
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:26,389
He gets a one shot, two shot, three shot.

86
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:26,949
Does not get the kill.

87
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:27,509
Gets the bet.

88
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:29,509
He's got to get that whip attack.

89
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,080
Yes.

90
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,280
That is so...

91
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,680
You know what?

92
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,960
Let's just stop right here.

93
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,460
Can I just say this?

94
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,469
If you can do that, you are talented.

95
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,270
You just really are.

96
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,789
Because I don't know how people continue to...

97
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,030
You know, Heavy, just fucking die.

98
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,030
Oh my God, I'm terrible.

99
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:49,780
Oh boy.

100
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:53,430
You know, I'm fine.

101
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,229
Oh my good...

102
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:58,900
Ow, my butthole!

103
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,449
What?

104
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,520
Is there something wrong with this engineer?

105
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,560
Like, what is going on?

106
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,370
Why?

107
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,009
What are you doing?

108
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:19,620
We have a point to cap, you know.

109
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,420
We have to go over there and get this point.

110
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:22,980
No, I...

111
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,699
Sir?

112
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:24,980
Sir, excuse me.

113
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,660
Sir, you have to go that way and cap the point.

114
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,379
I'm done with you.

115
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:32,730
Let's see how...

116
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:37,829
You see?

117
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:38,949
You see what happens?

118
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,870
You see what happens when you don't do that?

119
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:48,410
You want to step inside for the next Game of Thrones.

120
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,779
It's gonna be so much fun on the next Game of Thrones.

121
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,899
You have this song style that you always, always go back to.

122
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:02,019
And if you were like, actually, like an artist, like a musician...

123
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:02,339
Yeah?

124
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:03,379
You would be the worst.

125
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:08,660
Why do you say that?

126
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,910
I'm gonna go to the next Game of Thrones.

127
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,470
That's like the...

128
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,110
You're always so excited about like nothing.

129
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,750
That's a theme.

130
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,750
That's like the general theme song music.

131
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,860
Have you ever heard like a theme song from anywhere in the 80s or 90s?

132
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,019
Holy shit, did you see this pyro?

133
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:31,500
Every theme song in the 80s and 90s had a motto.

134
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,300
The Otto?

135
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,459
Like, for instance, like, we were moving on up to the east side.

136
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:39,899
Like, that was the song's motto.

137
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:42,699
And it said it like three or four times in the exact same tone.

138
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,100
Right?

139
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,139
Yeah.

140
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:45,860
Here's another one.

141
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:51,750
Oh yeah, child's in charge.

142
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,910
Like, the child's in charge.

143
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,230
Come on.

144
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,230
You know what I'm talking about.

145
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,189
I do know what you're talking about.

146
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:00,870
So that's why when you say...

147
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,870
When I'm like, you better step inside for the next Game of Thrones.

148
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,189
Like, the next Game of Thrones is the motto of the theme song.

149
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:10,810
The Otto?

150
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:12,089
No.

151
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:12,730
The motto.

152
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,410
No!

153
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,810
There's a pyro just standing there, like, hitting this engineer at spawn with...

154
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,850
What the fuck is...

155
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:24,970
Hold on.

156
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,290
What the...

157
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:25,930
What was that?

158
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:31,060
Why did the whole earth just rotate like 100 miles per hour?

159
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,300
Is that like a bug?

160
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,500
What the hell just happened?

161
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,420
Where the shadows like move across the ground?

162
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,899
Yeah.

163
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,660
Yeah, it's actually a pretty common bug.

164
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:41,459
I've never seen that before.

165
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,339
That was ridiculous.

166
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,750
It looked like somebody was like speed hacking above me.

167
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:51,589
All right.

168
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:53,430
Let's see how long it takes me to get headshot here.

169
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,629
Okay, that didn't take long at all.
