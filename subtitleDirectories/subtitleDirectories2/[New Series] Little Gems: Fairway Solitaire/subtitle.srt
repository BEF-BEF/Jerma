1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,789
Hey, what is going on everybody, Jerma here with a brand new series.

2
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,949
This is going to be Fairway Solitaire first and foremost, and it's gonna be the start

3
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:22,429
like I said of a new series called Little Gems.

4
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,429
Now what do you mean Little Gems?

5
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:30,350
Well I'm talking about mobile games, I'm talking about Android, iPhone, iPad, anything

6
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,679
on a mobile platform.

7
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,299
And the reason why I decided to do this is because I'm always on my damn iPhone.

8
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:41,520
I'm always playing a game when I'm waiting in line for the DMV or I'm at the doctors

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,520
or something like that.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,159
I'm always just sitting on it and I have a lot of favorites.

11
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:49,079
So I guess the whole purpose of this series is to give you guys, before you buy, because

12
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,399
I know it can be really, you never know with mobile games.

13
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,920
It's so hard to tell if a game is actually good because nobody really covers it and it's

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,600
not a whole lot of press on any of these games anyways.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,159
So you could buy a game that you think, oh this looks okay, what do people say about

16
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,159
it?

17
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,000
It's got okay reviews and then you play it and you hate it.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,189
So I'll be the middle man, let me play these games for you and give you my favorites baby.

19
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,370
So Fairway Solitaire, already in the middle of this game right here in the very beginning.

20
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,450
The way this game works, first of all it's for Windows, Mac, that's right you can get

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,709
it for your PC, iPhone and iPad.

22
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:26,709
I actually first played this for the iPhone and then I said oh my god I gotta get this

23
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:29,040
for the PC too because it's so addicting.

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,560
So if you ever played Mahjong or you ever played Solitaire, imagine this is like a strange

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,879
mix between the two, as you see in the bottom I of course have my face card and I have to

26
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,560
clear this entire deck, this whole place.

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,120
Now I don't have to, but the thing is if I don't clear this, look in the top left of

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,400
the screen, it's kind of like golf.

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,989
You can be above par, you can be even at par or you can be under par, hence the Fairway

30
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,519
in Fairway Solitaire.

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,439
So the way it works you have to go one above or one below the current face card you have

32
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,200
and you can just keep going in a chain.

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,680
That's the whole point, you want to get yourself in a chain and that's where this game becomes

34
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:16,370
so addicting, it just grabs a hold of you because you want to go 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 8, 9,

35
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,789
10, Jack and you get massive amounts of points for stringing things together.

36
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:24,210
Not to mention the awesome sound effects that are in this game, it sounds like you're at

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,250
a driving range.

38
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,569
I love that noise.

39
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,689
I love that noise.

40
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:32,810
It just brings me back, me and Burger Boy used to go to a place called Starland and

41
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,610
we'd hit a bucket of balls and just that steel on ball, ugh, I can't explain it, it's just

42
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,090
an awesome noise.

43
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,289
So how you win this game, before I talk about that I want to bring up the golf bag here.

44
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:46,689
In the lower right you're going to see there's a 9 iron sitting in there.

45
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:53,069
If I click this 9, it will turn the queen into a 9 card which can be insanely helpful.

46
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,569
It doesn't stop your streaks and it doesn't take up a card.

47
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,770
So how you get these, you have to buy them with the game's currency.

48
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,289
They're 500 golf bucks or you have to find them luckily in the world and that doesn't

49
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:09,250
really happen, they don't show up that often in the world.

50
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,129
So it is recommended that you buy them.

51
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:15,789
And how you get golf bucks, you have to string combos together really well or I think you

52
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:19,780
can do it by completing courses at a good point score.

53
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,099
So how you win this game, you have to complete courses at even or under par.

54
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:31,939
If you go over par, you will have to start the entire course from the very beginning.

55
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:34,699
Not the level, the entire course.

56
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:39,539
So it is very much recommended that you take your time and really try to get even or at

57
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:44,780
least one over or one under on the various holes of that course.

58
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,979
Because if you go like 4 or 5 over par on one particular hole, you're going to have

59
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,659
a ton of catching up to do.

60
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,819
So it's best to stay as close to even as you can possibly get.

61
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,780
So the addiction factor of this game is at an insane level.

62
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,199
I can't even begin to tell you how many hours I've sunk into this game already.

63
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,659
Just like I said, sitting at doctor's offices, sitting in plane rides, sitting in terminals,

64
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:08,659
anything.

65
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:11,699
This game just melts through time.

66
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:12,979
And that's what you want in a mobile game.

67
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:17,560
I think in any mobile platform game, you want a time waster.

68
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,879
This is a time waster.

69
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,480
And it's got a bunch of levels, a ton of unlockables, a ton of different things you can do with

70
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,720
the golf bucks.

71
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,040
So there's a lot here.

72
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,680
It kind of reminds me of PopCap games, games like Plants vs. Zombies or Insane Aquarium.

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,439
There's just a lot of stuff to do.

74
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,860
There's a challenge mode.

75
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,439
So I highly recommend this.

76
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:43,819
It's only $3.99 on the iTunes store and $2.99 on the website as well.

77
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:45,339
There's also a free version of this game.

78
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:49,019
It's kind of old and outdated, but it is still supported by the developer.

79
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,660
But you can get an hour long free trial if you go to Big Fish Games.

80
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,139
All the links will be in the description.

81
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,660
All the relevant things you need to know will be there as well.

82
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,420
And also the reason why I have the circle over the cards, that's not in the game.

83
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,779
I put that in there after in the editing process because you can't see where you're touching.

84
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:08,339
You can't see where you're clicking when you capture this game.

85
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:09,660
So that's the reason why you're seeing that.

86
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,750
That's not going to be on your screen.

87
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,370
So that's going to wrap up the video, guys.

88
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,370
Thank you so much for watching.

89
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,750
I really do appreciate it.

90
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,129
And let me know if you like the new series.

91
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:18,370
Let me know if you want to see more.

92
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,370
If you have any games you want me to try that are on a mobile platform, then definitely

93
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,370
let me know.

94
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,170
Leave me a comment on this video and maybe I'll check it out.

95
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,170
We'll see.

96
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,449
So yeah, guys, that's going to wrap it up.

97
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:29,810
I'll see you all soon.

98
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,250
And take care, everybody.
