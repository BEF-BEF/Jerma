1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,650
Yeah, there's at least two creepers out there. Yep. And they're like on top of the roof.

2
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:21,789
This was a horrible place to build the house. Whose idea was this? Mine. And mine. I'm gonna

3
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:27,100
build out, see where my name is, guys? Whoa, they're lagging too. That's the worst part.

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:36,740
Yeah. Be careful. I'm coming to rescue you. Oh no, they're coming for me. I'm digging

5
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:43,820
straight up, guys. I'm trying to take care of this skeleton over here. Get in here. I

6
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,500
might be able to just lure them away. All right, they're coming after me. Both the creepers

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,320
are after me. This is our time to act. Oh my god. I have, I don't know where to go.

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,780
Oh jeez. Head towards me. Where are you? I'm digging out. Are you in the original home?

9
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,859
Yes, right here. Get in, get in, get in. Oh, the creepers are coming lefter. I got in,

10
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:10,340
I got in the house. All right, are you in? Me too. I'm in the house. We're both in the

11
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,659
house. Nice. Oh my god. I'm gonna get away. Oh my god, they're pounding. See how scary

12
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:18,739
that is? Hey. It's terrifying. I need food. I'm dying. Because there are creepers out

13
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:22,980
there too. Hey guys. You guys can't do nothing. We got food. We have food. I'm gonna defend

14
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:29,310
myself, yo. Get these creepers and, oh gosh. What happens if I open the door? Don't open

15
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,489
the door. All right, viewers at home, while you were away, we started a lovely weed farm

16
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:44,810
and as a result, wow, thank, why? This is not working at all. Give me food. Chests do

17
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:51,420
not automatically pick that stuff up. Just an FYI. I want those. Where are those? This

18
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:59,060
is real. All right, you get one bread for you. Actually, two bread for you. Om nom nom

19
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,939
nom nom nom nom. How's your hunger doing, Jerma? It's all right. Oh, I was gonna open

20
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:11,860
the door. I was just tempted to. And I need to eat. I need food. Yeah, I do. Actually,

21
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:22,830
I got bread. I just gave you one, so. Oh yeah. All right. It's a total bread party. Oh no,

22
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:30,830
no. I didn't mean to do that. I'll take the hit. Oh my god. I have to piss them off. Oh

23
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:42,110
wow. Why did that just happen? Why? Oh my god. They are so good now. What is this? Okay,

24
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:48,629
I'm rebuilding the wall. I'm distracting, but they're everywhere. All right. I didn't

25
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:54,669
know if you right click, you open doors. Oh my god, they're so good right now. Yes. I

26
00:02:54,669 --> 00:03:01,680
right click to like throw a snowball at the door and I open the door. All right. I have

27
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,080
to make another door. I've got the wall back up, but man, we need a safer way to do this

28
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,840
now. They are way too smart. All right. I need to pick up all of our items. Oh my god.

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,639
Open up. Oh god. Oh, I'm coming for me. Don't worry. I'm here to the rescue. Oh, he's.

30
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:26,479
How did he get inside? He went through my. He went through. Oh my. What is going on here?

31
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:32,319
Hold on. This is this is a secondary entrance now. Lepter dug up. Remember to distract them

32
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,360
and then a creeper like dropped out. He went through his hole in order to come down here

33
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,979
and attack me. Oh my god. Luckily for me, he only needed one fist punch to die or else

34
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:50,349
they would have exploded our chest. All right. So masterful, you know, movement around the map.

35
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:55,229
All right. So if I if I right click, I don't throw snowballs. Don't do it.

36
00:03:55,469 --> 00:04:02,909
Here you go. Hang on. We're going to fix this. Good lesson. Good lesson to learn. Do not right

37
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:08,509
click near a door. I got it. I should make another door for us up top here, though.

38
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:14,270
Here's what I'm going to do. We're going to make like a secondary, secondary door for the

39
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:19,139
to protect the first door. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, we need one door to protect the

40
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,819
second door. Exactly. Exactly. All right. So I have a door up here now as well.

41
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,220
Like one exit on this side and one exit on this side. You know what I'm saying?

42
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,620
Like two exits. Yeah, because if they're on one side banging on the door,

43
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:42,189
then we just go to the other side. Hey, what if they're smarter than that? What do you do then?

44
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:45,389
What a great way. That's a great way to deal with like a Jehovah's Witness.

45
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:52,990
Just make two doors so you can escape to the second door when they knock on the first door.

46
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,139
Let's go. There we go. All right. Oh, wait, no, no, don't fill that in. That's where the door is

47
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:05,100
going to be. Oh, yeah. I cut down this tree. I think totally. Yeah, I did. Actually, we could

48
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,670
have three doors. We could have one in the front and one on each side. And then it's literally

49
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:17,470
impossible to get back in the house. I can't believe we really are making a door to get into

50
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,029
the door. That's so funny. We're making three doors to get in the door. We heard you like doors,

51
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:28,899
so we gave you a door with the door next to another door. Oh, my God. Look at all that snow

52
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:33,939
video. I love how I'm not doing anything. I'm just like watching you guys like build this house.

53
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:40,290
I'm just like, what time is it? What a great voice.

54
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:51,470
Okay. It's granddaddy germs. Now we just need doors. Oh, no, this is off by one. Okay, I'm good

55
00:05:51,470 --> 00:06:01,250
now. I'm okay. Oh, did we freeze? We froze. Wait, what happened? Yeah, we froze. I need one more

56
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:08,209
door. Oh, this looks really, really cool. I think we need to up the style a little bit, though. So

57
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:15,620
I'm going to just. I almost feel like I belong here. We'll sacrifice practicality for an uneven

58
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:24,180
house. What are these shenanigans? This isn't allowed. No, if you play Minecraft long enough.

59
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:32,370
Hey, hey, don't we have a lot of glass? Or am I just mistaken? So they can't like punch out

60
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:40,209
windows, can they? Let's hope not. Yeah, I'm hoping not. Do we have any more glass? Yes,

61
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:45,250
absolutely. All right. Well, I have nothing. I can't. I can't let this slide, man. Can't let

62
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:51,100
it slide. I don't know what's going on. Is that thing up there supposed to be like the chimney

63
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:59,180
or something? There's like a little like dongle up top. We have a snow. I'm going to add a

64
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,860
glowstone block on top of that. I do have another snow block. Where do you need it? Right in this

65
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:15,680
corner right over here. Hey, guys. Did I make you miss? No, it apparently made Jerma's mistake.

66
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,240
Oh, right clicking doesn't do anything. Oh, it's there. It's easy. I think it's I am helping.

67
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,579
And you know what we can do? How did you even get up there?
