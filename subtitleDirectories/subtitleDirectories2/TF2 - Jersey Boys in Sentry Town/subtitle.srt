24
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:35,520
I've been sitting here. Just laughing and me and star but just been being wicked stupid. How did I even get back here?

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,560
Look what the card is. What did I do?

26
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,000
What did I do? I'm at their spawn on upward all the way at the back and they're at the second point

27
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,659
Um

28
00:02:52,060 --> 00:03:00,009
Star I know exactly what I want to do. So get your ass in the game like right now

29
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:09,370
Okay, there's three spies on this team. Okay, that's fine. I'm the fourth. That's great. Just letting you know so you don't like

30
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:17,699
Your job is to get back to red spawn like the all the way back. Oh like back to the future

31
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,210
I wonder who that medic is

32
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:28,080
This engineer is paying so much attention to like what I'm doing. He's like, what the hell is this guy doing? Wait, wait

33
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,419
No, he doesn't he doesn't know your spot

34
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,919
Just come over here

35
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:51,599
Yeah, all right now take your disguise off. No one's gonna spawn. Damn it dude. This is no

36
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Kill it. I kill him

37
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,669

40
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:19,269
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is there another spy? Is that another spy? I'm so confused right now. Hold on. Let me I gotta go look

41
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,230
Yeah, that's a spy. Yeah, wait, there's a cloak spy behind you behind you behind you

42
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,079
I thought this was a dumb idea, but I forgot like the germa factor

43
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:48,620
Well, you're not gonna like hit it as soon as I show. No, I didn't I that was

44
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,860
Unnecessarily. I did not mean to do that. Oh look who it is

45
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:02,230
Okay, you need to get to no, I don't trust you. I'm look I promise you. Okay. Okay. That was a little bit scary with it

46
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,389
Oh, you're like whole team spawning here now. Yeah

47
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,149
So go hide and like a place like just do

48
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,529
No, just disguise as an engineer and just walk over to that guy

49
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,680
Just get in front of him. I want to try to box

50
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,560
Okay, do you see this engineer which one down to the down down spawn down at the their spawn?

51
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
He we can literally lock him in. I

52
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,959
Don't think he'll know what's going on. You get up you get on that side. I'm gonna get on this side

53
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:44,660
So he can't move. Yeah, he's stuck. He doesn't care

54
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,930
Completely locked in he's confused. He's like what's going on here? What can I not move?

55
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,930
This is this is confusing me

56
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:03,529
Get out of the way he's saying get out of the way in chat, this is awesome

57
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
