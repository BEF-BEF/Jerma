00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,440
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight, gonna be playing as the Pyro.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,440
Now, this is not gonna be one straight gameplay in a row. It's gonna be a few clips of the Pyro back to back on various maps,

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
but just a couple of streaks here and there that I got with the Extinguisher and the Flare Gun.

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,439
You guys know the deal, but I'm using the Strange Degreaser, the Flare Gun, like I said, and the Extinguisher.

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:41,740
So the topic of this gameplay is going to be about communities, gameplay communities, or really communities in general,

6
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:49,740
and how they shape the world of gaming and why they are so important, and especially a game like Team Fortress 2, which is pretty old.

7
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,740
And I've done community videos before talking about, you know, why TF2 is lasting so long or why games are worth playing,

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:06,920
but I want to focus mostly on communities as a whole and why they need to be strengthened from the core to continue on in their legacy of their game franchises,

9
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,349
or just in general, just in the world of gaming. So let me define what I mean by the word community.

10
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:18,349
I know it has probably a couple of different contexts and a couple of different things, but this is what I see it as.

11
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:24,349
A community is a group of people that are all collectively in the same area or in the same interest field,

12
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:33,349
that are all trying to coexist together and strengthen themselves from the inside out to be a better place or a better group of people.

13
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:40,349
Now, gaming communities in specific here are very, very important to a game's lifespan.

14
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:43,349
I'm going to bring up Team Fortress 2, because of course we're playing Team Fortress 2.

15
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:47,349
Team Fortress 2 has lasted this long mainly because of its community.

16
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:52,349
Valve has done a great job of putting out all these updates and giving us all this free stuff

17
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:55,349
and giving us all these great things to play with in their games,

18
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:59,349
but it really is the people playing the reason why it's still going,

19
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:04,780
because if you don't have people playing the game, you don't have that active demand from the whole group of players,

20
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,780
there's no reason to keep supporting a title. You move on to the next big thing.

21
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:15,090
And really, this is where we come in. We do things like make mods for games or game mode modifications.

22
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,090
We make content, video content, like you're watching right now.

23
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,090
There's a lot of people that make YouTube videos on gaming content.

24
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,389
And even with something like the Steam Workshop, which adds items and artwork and 3D modeling into the game.

25
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:32,389
So you've got a lot of things going on with a community that if they were not there, think about this for a second.

26
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:39,759
If those things that I just mentioned were not there, would something like Team Fortress 2 have died years ago?

27
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,060
And the answer is I'm not sure, because Valve, like I said, has been actively updating this game

28
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,060
and actively putting a lot of developer support into it, that it's hard to tell.

29
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:57,060
But can you imagine a world where there was no Saxton Hale, there was no crazy mod servers with Prop Hunt or Balloon Race,

30
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,060
or nobody putting Steam Workshop items on the marketplace and having you go click and vote and watch

31
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,060
and see all the cool new things coming through the pipeline, if there were no YouTube videos, if people didn't make gaming?

32
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,060
And this is not just Team Fortress 2 exclusive. I have no idea what would happen.

33
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,060
But what I do know is when we get interested in something, it sparks interest from the developers.

34
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,060
When the developer gets sparked interest from the community, they start to make more stuff.

35
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,060
When they make more stuff, people buy it potentially, or they start playing more, the company makes more money, so on and so forth.

36
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,430
It is a love-love relationship that cannot really be broken.

37
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:39,669
And unfortunately, I can probably name you a handful of franchises that have really, really bad, bad relationships with their communities.

38
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:46,669
And you see this clash of heads all the time between developers and the people playing, it can get so out of hand.

39
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:52,669
People asking for bug fixes that never happen and content patches that are expensive and they don't really add a whole lot.

40
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:54,669
It's really bad sometimes.

41
00:03:54,669 --> 00:04:02,909
But it is so important to have that backbone of people pushing for something because it allows you to shape the games you love to play.

42
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:10,090
As a group, as a collective, we have a voice that if it gets ignored in a lot of these cases with the developers not listening,

43
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,259
it causes massive problems because we won't buy the next game that comes out.

44
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:18,259
We won't pay for the really expensive DLC.

45
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,259
We won't do these things and it hurts the company.

46
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:24,259
If they don't play ball, play ball.

47
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:31,259
If they don't play ball, then we have a little bit of power because we won't do the things that they're asking us to do.

48
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,629
And a little earlier I brought up mods and game modifications and stuff like that.

49
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:41,629
And those are so awesome because it gets to, it lets people, when game companies, let me say this first,

50
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:48,629
when game companies allow us use of their game code to create new things and new ideas,

51
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:51,629
it is such an incredible thing for the whole collective.

52
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,629
It is unbelievable.

53
00:04:53,629 --> 00:05:00,629
And I actually have a really big problem with companies that take their game code or take their stance on modifications and game changes and stuff.

54
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,629
And they put it in a box, close it and lock it and throw the key in the backyard.

55
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:10,629
I have a big problem with that because what you're effectively doing is we brought up having a voice in the community.

56
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:16,629
You're essentially silencing everybody and not letting anyone have an imagination with your fantastic product.

57
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:21,810
Because, I mean, a lot of people spend, I understand the argument that these companies put a lot of time in their work.

58
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,810
They don't want their game code to be exploited.

59
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,810
It's an intellectual property and it's copyrighted and sorry, screw you, go deal with it.

60
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:38,050
But I can name you three franchises right now that started as mods that became major, major wild successes.

61
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,050
Here you go.

62
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,050
League of Legends.

63
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,420
All those MOBA games started in Warcraft 3 as a Warcraft 3 custom map.

64
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,589
You've got something like DayZ.

65
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:49,589
DayZ is a mod.

66
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:52,589
And then you've got a little game called Team Fortress 2.

67
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:54,589
Team Fortress was a Quake mod.

68
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:59,589
Can you imagine if Quake did not allow mods to their games?

69
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:02,589
We would not even have Team Fortress 2.

70
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:03,589
And that's the point I'm going to make.

71
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:04,589
I'm going to end on that, guys.

72
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:06,589
And that's going to wrap up the video.

73
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:09,589
So let me know in the comments section what you think about all this.

74
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:10,589
And we will go from there.

75
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,589
Community, stay strong, baby.

76
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:13,589
And I'll see you guys all next time.

77
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:15,589
And of course, take care, everybody.
