1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,759
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Super Meat Boy Mondays.

2
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,760
In this episode, we're going to tackle the Salt Factory Chapter 3.

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,750
So what do you say we get started and watch the cutscene?

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:30,000
Alright, so he's got my pig girlfriend. She looks like a pig from behind right there.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,439
He turned into the moon, went into the Salt Factory. I love this music.

6
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:43,060
This is like one of my favorite songs in the whole game. I don't know why.

7
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:49,700
Just like that. Here we go.

8
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,060
This is where it's going to start to get really, really bad on the rage front.

9
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,060
So let's see if I can't just pull this off.

10
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:03,689
Can I get it? Yes.

11
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,170
No, I can't. I should have just jumped over it. I'm an idiot.

12
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,659
No, screw the Band-Aid. I don't need it.

13
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,810
There it is.

14
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,260
We go up and down. I don't even remember.

15
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,439
It's been a long time since I've played this game. Looks like we're going up.

16
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,739
Level complete.

17
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,420
I can walk on this, right? Okay, good.

18
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,420
I was going to say, hopefully I can walk on this.

19
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,859
Jump, jump. Let's go, Super Meat Boy. Show them what you got.

20
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:52,659
You know what? For a second I thought that was in the background.

21
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,659
Like the foreground. I couldn't run into it.

22
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,670
I thought it was part of the scenery.

23
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,640
Now I know. See, now you...

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,140
Oh my god. I'm shifting in my seat. I've got to get comfortable.

25
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:18,000
Get the key. Nice and easy here.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,560
No bologna. No bologna and cheese sandwiches here.

27
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,090
Now I know that happens. It's good to know.

28
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,460
Run!

29
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,460
Oh, jeez, I forgot that happened.

30
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,469
See, that's definitely the worst part about playing this over again.

31
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,469
Just blindly. I forget all these levels.

32
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,469
Now I know that happens so I can...

33
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,469
God, the noises that are made.

34
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:53,469
Warp Zone, Warp Zone, Warp Zone. Can I get in there?

35
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:56,340
How the hell do I get in there?

36
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,340
Oh, for the love of Pete. Whatever.

37
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,150
Hold on. There we go.

38
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,020
Oh, no. Hold on.

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,379
Ninja Meat Boy.

40
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:20,219
20 points to who knows what that is.

41
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,169
Oh, let's keep it skiing here.

42
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:28,169
Tribes Ascent. Just like Tribes.

43
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:30,659
It's all about the skiing.

44
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,659
Hey, Blush Baby.

45
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,659
This is my favorite part. I love this.

46
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,310
Yeah.

47
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,310
Boomtown. Oh, I forgot. Oh, yeah, these things.

48
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,310
You have to kind of dodge these things.

49
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,310
They shoot a little slow, but they have homing capabilities.

50
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,740
So you want to b-ya-hoo and then you want to b-ya-ha and then you want to b-ya-ha.

51
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,740
Otto, what do you want?

52
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,740
Otto just walked in my room.

53
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,740
Which means my door is open.

54
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,740
Which means the other big dog, the big, gross, smelly dog can get in here now.

55
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,740
And I don't want that.

56
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,740
Not that I don't love my dog, but he's a...

57
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,740
He is big and he is gross.

58
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,740
Here's a little quick story about that dog.

59
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,740
So the big, huge dog you've probably seen in videos past.

60
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,740
We have to give him to the groomer every couple months or every few weeks.

61
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,740
Because he's just so big and disgusting.

62
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,740
He just stinks sometimes.

63
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,980
But he's a big, lovable ox. We love him.

64
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,980
His name's Boo Boo.

65
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,220
Oh my god. That's the fifth time that's happened.

66
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,220
Enough. Enough. Enough.

67
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,220
My ship sails in the morning.

68
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,220
I wonder what's for breakfast.

69
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,819
Come on.

70
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:59,660
Dog. God damn it.

71
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,790
Come on.

72
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,459
You see, they have to explode.

73
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:10,459
If you don't get them to blow up, then you're in big trouble.

74
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:11,459
Like that. See?

75
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:12,459
There was like...

76
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,459
Please. God. No.

77
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,899
Okay. Time to...

78
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,899
I really got to pay attention here.

79
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:25,079
No.

80
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,079
Oh my god. I'm going to throw the friggin' controller into the wall.

81
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,019
Come on.

82
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,569
Alright. Wait for another one.

83
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:35,569
Good.

84
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,569
Now. God. In. Heaven.

85
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:42,300
Go.

86
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,670
I'm sick of this.

87
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,449
There. That's it. You're supposed to turn and run.

88
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,449
And then do it again.

89
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,449
And then do it again.

90
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:53,449
Thank you very much.

91
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,449
Holy crap.

92
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,449
Oh no. I didn't want to skip that. Crap.

93
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,449
I wanted to see all those deaths.

94
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:02,449
I'm sorry if you wanted to see that too. I apologize.

95
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:05,199
But I have such an itchy trigger finger in this game.

96
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,199
I just have to go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

97
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,220
Woohoo.

98
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,800
Got to stay in the middle. Got to stay in the middle.

99
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,810
A+.

100
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,430
Yeah.

101
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,819
The bend.

102
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,819
Welcome to the bend.

103
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,019
Bender bending Rodriguez.

104
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,019
Bite my shiny metal ass.

105
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,519
Oh no.

106
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,980
Me and Fry are going to go do some terrorizing.

107
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,470
Come on, Professor.

108
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,470
I don't think I'm going to do.

109
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,470
Why do all my voices sound the same?

110
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,290
Every voice is just like grandpa.

111
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,360
Whatever.

112
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,689
Just go. You know what? I'm just going to go. Go.

113
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:01,310
That didn't work so well.

114
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,449
Got to wait here.

115
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,449
This is the word. Meat Boy levels where you have to be patient.

116
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,449
I cannot do it.

117
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,449
When you got to be patient, I can't do it.

118
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,620
I cannot stand it.

119
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,620
I just want to go as fast as I possibly can.

120
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,990
That really just killed me.

121
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,990
Got to go as humanly possible.

122
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,990
As fast as I possibly humanly, humanly can.

123
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,620
No, come here.

124
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,899
No, my...

125
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:33,589
Oh, at least I'm not dying.

126
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,589
Oh my god.

127
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,589
What the hell?

128
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:40,589
Alright, that's not going to happen again.

129
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:44,480
Told you.

130
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,000
Get the girl.

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Take her back to mom and dad's.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Have some dinner.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,350
Meet the fam.

134
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,350
Oh boy, this thing moves. This thing moves and yet it moves.

135
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,589
Isn't that a game?

136
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:01,899
I think that's a game.

137
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:11,800
Oh crap.

138
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,810
Otto.

139
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,399
There we go.

140
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,370
Hello, my queen.

141
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,120
Rustic. Sounds pretty rustic to me.

142
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

143
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,129
Oh god.

144
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:37,340
Okay, good thing I didn't...

145
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,559
Just got to go, got to go, got to go.

146
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,559
Alright, getting to the boss here.

147
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,559
I think the boss is...

148
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,559
I remember the boss in this level is

149
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,179
difficult.

150
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,179
And I'm probably going to use so many lives

151
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:54,179
at that boss.

152
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:58,279
It's not even funny.

153
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:03,529
Oh my god, how am I going to get this

154
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:05,529
like that? That's how you're going to get it.

155
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:09,049
And you're not going to die here.

156
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,049
It's all about the patience.

157
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,049
My patience, my young padawan.

158
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:15,049
And you will be victorious.

159
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:17,610
Don't go yet. Okay, go.

160
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,039
Yes. Alright, well

161
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,789
right after beating that level, we

162
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,789
just had a crash, but that's okay.

163
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:26,789
Back, ready to do it again.

164
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:29,419
Come on, bro. Come on, bro.

165
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:32,169
Oh, look at these dodges.

166
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,600
Dude, why am I playing

167
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
the Super Mario Bros. 2 level where you have to

168
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,159
dig down? I forget

169
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,159
what you have to do here. Oh my god,

170
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,980
what do I do? Oh my god.

171
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.

172
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,980
I totally forget what you have to do here.

173
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,820
What does go-

174
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Oh, no, no, no. Okay, I remember, I remember.

175
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
You go through here. Okay.

176
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,500
There we go. For a second

177
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
I was just, by brain, had no idea

178
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,509
what was going on. Would you just get in there

179
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:08,379
you sloppy bastard?

180
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,379
And this is going to be another Biahu.

181
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,830
Yes it is. Oh, hi.

182
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,980
Uh, Biahu?

183
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,409
Now I know you. I will probably say

184
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:22,970
I hate

185
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,340
these things. These are the absolute

186
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,340
worst things in the game.

187
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,470
These stupid missile launches.

188
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,700
Oh, you're going to take this- come on.

189
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,129
I'll jump over you all day.

190
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:42,870
Yes. Okay.

191
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,870
Hopefully I don't crash at the

192
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,820
boss, because that would not be good.

193
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,379
Brownie. I gotta go,

194
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,379
gotta go. Help me. Please.

195
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:55,379
Oh, you're here. Of course I'm here. You're my

196
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,379
girlfriend. Excuse me, you can't

197
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,379
touch that. I will be hitting this button

198
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:01,379
right now. Or pulling this lever, same thing.

199
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:03,379
Here comes your toilet.

200
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,879
Who's it going to be?

201
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,879
Oh my god. What the hell

202
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,879
is going on? What is this?

203
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,309
It's- oh, it stinks.

204
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,309
What is it?

205
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:17,000
Who is that?

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,559
Hey guys, it's me.

207
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,559
Brownie.

208
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,559
Alright, let's go.

209
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,559
You have to beat this guy in a race,

210
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,179
that's all I remember. Oh, you are

211
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:30,179
done. I- come on.

212
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh, no.

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,139
I gotta be right up his ass the whole time.

214
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:38,889
I can hear, like, my phone

215
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:40,889
ringing. You guys hear that?

216
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,889
Whoever you're calling right- whoever's calling

217
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:44,889
me right now can't talk. Fighting

218
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:46,889
Brownie. I'm not really fighting him, but

219
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:50,340
racing him. Oh,

220
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,340
you just got passed.

221
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,480
You just got passed, man.

222
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,620
You got passed. Just don't

223
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,620
screw this up. Oh, what a

224
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,110
s- come on. No!

225
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,019
Ugh! Damn it!

226
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,019
I was way ahead of him, too.

227
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,320
I was running circles around him.

228
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,159
I have to stay way ahead.

229
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:17,159
This is where you gotta get some ground, right here.

230
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,149
Down here, and then don't be

231
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:22,649
a stupid idiot.

232
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,649
See, right there I screwed that up.

233
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,649
Screwed it up. Oh, my god.

234
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:30,870
Totally screwed everything up.

235
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,870
Go, go- oh, who's talking to me on Skype?

236
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,870
I'm getting all these, like, notifications.

237
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,870
Come on, you bastard!

238
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,870
What? What? What? Okay.

239
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,419
Thank god.

240
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:44,419
I made it.

241
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:46,419
Please don't kill me. I'm- I don't wanna-

242
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,419
I got you, buddy. Don't worry.

243
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:50,419
Thank you, man.

244
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:53,179
I appreciate it.

245
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:55,179
You'll never take him. I'm gonna throw another brick in his face.

246
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,179
You'll see-

247
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:59,740
Dude, what are you doing?

248
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Leave him alone. She-

249
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,230
I love you.

250
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,230
I love you, too, man. You're gonna

251
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,230
get it. Hi there, how are you? You're dead

252
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,230
when I see you, man. I'm jumping over there. I'm gonna kick

253
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,230
the absolute crap out of you.

254
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,230
Not if I press this button.

255
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,230
I'll just throw it at you.

256
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:22,169
Alright, guys.

257
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,470
That's chapter three in the bag.

258
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,470
The salt factory.

259
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,470
The salt and sugar factory.

260
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,470
And hell is

261
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,470
next, chapter four.

262
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,220
Let's see how good I do there.

263
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,779
But in the meantime, of course,

264
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:39,779
enjoy the rest of your day or night, and

265
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,779
I'll see you guys all next time. And of course,

266
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,779
take care, everybody.
