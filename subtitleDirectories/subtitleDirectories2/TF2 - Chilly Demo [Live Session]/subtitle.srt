00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:11,580
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Derma here with some live Dermalicious Man gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:23,670
Tonight I'm gonna be playing with the new items, the new demo items, because, you know, I haven't really had a chance to sit down with them consecutively, so let's go.

3
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:32,469
So I have to try to like figure out how this stuff works. It's been a week or so since I've played Team Fortress 2, but we're gonna give it a go.

4
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:41,219
So, when I first saw the sticky launcher, I was under the impression that I was probably going to like it, because you just shoot stuff and explode.

5
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:49,590
Shoot stuff and explode. Is that spy dead? I have no idea. Does anybody know if that spy is dead? Can I please hit...

6
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:57,259
You wanna go ham on ham? You wanna go ham on ham? It was a big mistake. You never go ham on ham with a demo.

7
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:04,569
Oh, you were a demo, so don't ever mind. You are a spy. If I've ever seen one, you are a goddamn spy.

8
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:21,670
No, he wasn't. He was a regular player. Look at you. Oh, no, don't. We can't lose. No, you fucker. Oh, I saw that happening too.

9
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:30,540
I legit just watched that happen and didn't do anything about it. I just kind of, my brain turned off and he's gonna get to the point here with crits.

10
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,829
Somebody do something about that. Oh, good job. Good job, Pyro. You flamed him. Nice job flaming him.

11
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:46,019
Now we lose. That guy charged on it and we lose. Alright, let's just restock the video. Hey, what's going on, everybody?

12
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:55,400
So, you're probably wondering why we're on cold front, and the answer to that is quite simple. It's really, really cold right now in the northeast.

13
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:03,420
There's like a big cold front passing through, and I figured why not show the implication that it's chilly out.

14
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,729
And it's like five degrees, and I'm sure a lot of you guys from really cold areas are probably like, wow, that's nothing.

15
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:16,030
You're telling me you're gonna close schools for like five degree weather? I walked to school in like negative 15.

16
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:22,370
What does this guy think he's doing? Oh, I didn't get anybody. I'm gonna wrap around.

17
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:29,740
I still don't understand this item. This item is like, what, a combination of the lock and load? Should I be treating it like a lock and load or what?

18
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,180
It's like lock and load in the default, kind of as one. I'm not even entirely sure how I should be playing with this.

19
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,860
But all I know is it's good for stuff like that, because it travels really far.

20
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,729
And that's what you should be using it for, at least in my opinion, is to launch stuff really far very quickly.

21
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:55,800
Well, let's try to get this capped. Hey, hey, that's two spies. No, it's not. It's just one. Where'd you go? Show yourself.

22
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,979
Give me this health. I don't feel like dying right now. Is he dead? All right, he's dead. We're gonna get this.

23
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:12,629
These rounds are going super, super fast. Yeah, I mean, direct shotting with this thing. Is it as fast as the lock and load? I just don't even know.

24
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:17,009
What the hell do I even know? Got that guy.

25
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:26,379
The one thing I don't like about this new sticky launcher is the point, the point, the thing. Can you say words? Say words.

26
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:36,330
It's not that difficult to produce vocabulary. Do we have a medic? I don't even know. Is the short detonation time?

27
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:44,379
I don't like that. But I guess you kind of have to give up the fact that you're able to shoot things across the map in like less than two seconds like that.

28
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:50,879
So we're gonna wait for this health to spawn. Please spawn. And you are. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about that.

29
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:58,379
You could have used that health instead. I took it from you. Do we have this many snipers on the team or is that like a spy or something?

30
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:13,569
Get rid of that thing. Where's the medic? There's too many snipers. I keep thinking you're all spies. No, no, no. One more hit.

31
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:22,329
I would have had him. Still got him. I'm good. It's good to go. Good to go. Good to go. Good to go. Not really. Here comes everybody.

32
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:31,329
I should really pull this out. There we go. Oh, I just barely didn't get that guy with the long range shot.

33
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:41,850
Give me a medic. Holy shit. Get me out of there. Let's recharge. We need some health. Give us the health.

34
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:51,920
Oh, damn. Was that a crit screen or did he just get a random crit? Shit. I wanted to. I wanted to win this video game.

35
00:04:51,920 --> 00:05:00,670
They got it. Damn it. All right. I got to like set up in my chair. Let's set up in the chair.

36
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:09,420
Let's take a sip of our crystal clear. That guy just lost an uber. Shit. That's no good. Can I stick?

37
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:16,800
I can sticky jump. Yeah, I think so. Right. Yeah. That's a sniper that's going for my. You know what? Screw it.

38
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,620
I'm going to use this thing. I like this thing more than the. Holy shit. Did he really just launch that across everything and hit me?

39
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:34,120
Damn it. Now they're going to cap it. No, I didn't. And you know, I didn't even sit up in the chair. That's problem number one.

40
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:42,459
I'm still like slouching back like a fucking sloth. There we go. Now we're sitting up and we're just going to go for this.

41
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:48,319
Let's see if we can get somebody right now. See if that just hit somebody. It did.

42
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:56,399
That's too bad that that didn't kill somebody. That would have been pretty funny. I'll pop it. He popped it. He didn't drop it.

43
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:04,420
That's too bad. And I'm still taking damage of one HP spirit.

44
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:11,939
Spirit of Halloween. No, we're in the middle of January.

45
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:18,240
It's like, what is what is this? Halloween only comes once a year and I would I would accept Halloween

46
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,740
anywhere between late September to early November. But in January, that's pushing it and I need health.

47
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:39,430
We're getting just swarmed right now. Oh, my God. I'm using this thing like a shotgun. If I could just hit this medic, that would be fantastic.

48
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:46,259
But I can't actually maybe I can. I'll just babysit up here at least for now until I can get some health.

49
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:54,769
There we go. The spirit of Halloween go through. I just saw a candy pumpkin. That was a candy pumpkin.

50
00:06:54,769 --> 00:07:09,600
Oh, my God. You're you're no longer among the living over here. Where the fuck did you come from?

51
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:18,329
Oh, I got a winter crate. I got to do some shit. I'm not doing so well right now.

52
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:30,620
You got to arc these differently, I think. Sort of. You're not getting away with that.

53
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:42,019
Damn it. Come on up here. Come on up here. No, get away with me with that shit.

54
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:50,620
Oh, there's a lot of people coming down there. I need some help. Give me the heals.

55
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:59,540
No, not quite. Not quite through the hall. There are a bunch of people in here now, especially that spy.

56
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:07,579
I don't want that spy to wrap around. Yeah, there he is. Where's he going? Where is he? Right there.

57
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:18,509
Get out of here. Get out of. Damn it. Come on, we got to spawn. We can't lose right here.

58
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:24,029
What's going on? We having like a fucking tea party and spawn, guys? Let's go.

59
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:29,600
And there's a spy that just opened this door because the invisible man.

60
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:38,559
Nobody can open doors like that unless. Holy shit. What do we got here? You.

61
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,700
That's a crit. Come on, hit somebody. That didn't hit anybody. It was like three people just standing here.

62
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:52,360
You know, wrap around this way. Well, I got the medic of all people to get.

63
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,919
Oh, damn it. You're going to run right into me, aren't you? You didn't think that spy was going to get you.

64
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:05,049
I hit him with two. Can I hit him with that? I'm just going to go for the sniper instead.

65
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:12,129
Screw that guy. Sniper won't even know I'm going to do this because I can shoot at super long range.

66
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:18,200
Good thing I detonated before it even got to anybody. Holy shit. Bye. I didn't even kill him either.

67
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:27,070
I did not even kill him, but I will take credit for it nonetheless.

68
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:33,789
Damn it. I'm so bad with that thing. No, nobody on it. They're all over here.

69
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:38,700
You know, there's definitely a sniper here. Yeah, of course there is.

70
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,580
Can't even hit a guy standing still with this thing. Can't even hit a guy standing still.

71
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:51,370
Goodness. OK, well, sort of made up for it. Sort of.

72
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:59,100
You need a medic, don't you? What? What? It's OK.

73
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,860
I will take this medic and maybe we can push in. That would be great.

74
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:14,610
That would be fantastic if we could just push in right now. Oh, don't let him get over on that health.

75
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,960
You've got to cover all your bases when there's a health thing. You've got to put one here, you've got to put one there, you've got to put one over there.

76
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,100
This is not good. OK, well, we've got a team. Whoa, somebody's going to cap it.

77
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:33,950
Somebody was just about to cap it on our team. And we've got a Kritzkrieg.

78
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,940
Ooh, a Kritzkrieg. I bet you if you use it, we win.

79
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:45,039
I bet you we win. Oh, my God.

80
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:52,039
I got two people. Perfect timing for me to be good at the game.

81
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:58,419
What's happening? Just, you know, screw it. I'm going for it.

82
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:03,659
I made up for it. I made up for my two kill Kritzkrieg.

83
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:08,419
I did the sticky jump over and got the point. I did it.

84
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:15,740
I just heard a spy decloak. Is that you? That was you.

85
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,440
That was you. I got him. OK.

86
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,299
Well, OK. So got a spy. Got ourselves a spy there.

87
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:32,409
They're flooding the point right now. Oh, don't stop and drink.

88
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:36,710
Don't stop and drink your fluids, your Gatorade or your Powerade.

89
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,230
Whatever the hell you were just drinking. Dear.

90
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:47,440
Nobody there? Nobody there. How are our sentries doing? Good?

91
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,480
All right. Well, we only have to push through four points or not lose it.

92
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,299
Oh, there we go. There we go. Thanks for the speed boost, dude.

93
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,350
We're actually going to push out. Would you look at that?

94
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,110
Here comes a scout. I thought he was going to open the door.

95
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,379
He kind of is going to open the door, is he?

96
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:12,190
This is what we're talking about here. What we're talking about like long reds, a crit.

97
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,929
Was that a crit? How am I not hitting anybody?

98
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,679
I can't hit the backside of a fucking barn door.

99
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:26,629
Oh, that's a lot of damage. At least I got somebody.

100
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:31,889
Hopefully it was the heavy. If it wasn't the heavy that...

101
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:35,740
No. Spy. Where is he? Watch out for the spy.

102
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:42,110
Dude, I'm going to wait here because there's no way I can let that happen.

103
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,700
Because he will come over here and just sap this thing.

104
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,690
I got to give this guy a little bit of protection, at least. At the very least.

105
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:56,940
No, you're real. There's a sniper. Sniper down.

106
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,620
That's a lot of people.

107
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,019
No, I got him. Let's push out. Push out, boys.

108
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,519
We've got places to be. Guy's on the right.

109
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:18,110
Oh, he's still alive. There he goes.

110
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,299
What about this guy? Long range.

111
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:26,110
Too bad. Too bad.

112
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,179
No, get away from me with that.

113
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:36,230
Now I'm on fire. Heal up.

114
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,230
We actually, surprisingly, we were back on our toes there.

115
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,049
We're back on our heels.

116
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:45,539
Is that whatever the expression is? Is that even an expression?

117
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,539
I don't know. Probably not.

118
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:50,110
We're going to pretend it is, though.

119
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,110
And we're going to hope that the spy did not just walk right by my ass.

120
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,379
Which he probably did.

121
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:04,759
That scout just almost ate me alive.

122
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,830
Here comes the Uber.

123
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,519
Don't you even think about it, you two.

124
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,519
Die! Did I get the medic?

125
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,269
I didn't get the medic. I didn't get the medic.

126
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:19,899
We're in trouble now.

127
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:22,269
We still got the sentries?

128
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:26,600
If we still got those sentries, we'll be in pretty okay shape.

129
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
But I'm going to assume.

130
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,159
That might be enough to prolong this.

131
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,159
Oh, no, we got two. We got two. There's one right there.

132
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:37,220
Don't worry about it.

133
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,649
Nobody worry.

134
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,649
We just got to make sure this heavy medic doesn't roll in here

135
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,649
and just destroy everything.

136
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,340
I'm going to try to shoot over the heavy and kill the medic.

137
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,220
And I was sort of successful.

138
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,389
Kind of. I did damage.

139
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:57,769
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.

140
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,649
There's nobody behind you.

141
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,649
Oh, I should have paid attention behind me.

142
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,649
I was too busy hamming people.

143
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:05,269
Oh, well.

144
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:08,340
Shit. Well, that's what happens.

145
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,159
I'm going to try one more time.

146
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,159
I'm going to go balls to the wall.

147
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,409
I'm going to try to just cap it quick.

148
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:21,809
Hashtag cap it quick is what I'm trying to do here.

149
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:26,259
But it's probably going to end in my own death.

150
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,139
Considering I didn't do any jumping or anything.

151
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,139
I didn't like sticky jump or anything.

152
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,600
But here we go. Cap it quick.

153
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,759
Middle point.

154
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,730
We got a couple of people going about.

155
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,730
Oh, we got. Here we go.

156
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,179
Here we go.

157
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:46,320
All right, we got two or three down.

158
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
Two or three down. What we got? One Demoman?

159
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,009
Where's he at?

160
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:53,169
There we go.

161
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:55,169
No, not quite.

162
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:57,500
You bastard.

163
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
You just killed my medic.

164
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
We're going to cap it.

165
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
We just got it.

166
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,120
Oh, my God.

167
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Hashtag cap it quick.

168
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
It's actually a thing.

169
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,620
No.

170
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Shit.

171
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
Cap it quick.

172
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,620
Yes.

173
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,389
You see what happened?

174
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:14,389
See what happens when you use a hashtag in a game?

175
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:16,399
You got to write it.

176
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,399
You got to know what's going to be written.

177
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,159
Hashtag cap it quick.
