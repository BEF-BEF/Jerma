00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,890
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:23,059
And tonight, I'm not sure what I'm gonna be playing as, and it doesn't really matter, because this video is not gonna talk about Team Fortress 2.

3
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:27,300
It's not gonna talk about Smite. I don't know why I just brought up Smite.

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:40,579
There hasn't been a Smite video on this channel in like 70 years, but it's gonna talk about how this whole YouTube thing has truly been the most humbling experience of my entire life.

5
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:49,759
And this is not a subscriber milestone video. It's not like, thank you for 150,000 subscribers. No, this is not like any video like that.

6
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,759
It's just something I've wanted to do for a long time, is talk about this in a little bit more detail than I ever have.

7
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:02,500
And I figured it would be a good idea to do it right now, because I'm in the mood to talk about it.

8
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
So what am I getting at here? What's the point here? What am I talking about?

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:13,500
I'm talking about when people send me comments or tweets or personal messages. I read them all. I really do, I promise you guys.

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,500
I read all the comments, I read all the tweets, I read all the personal messages. It's just too much to ever be able to reply to them.

11
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,500
I think Gabe Newell famously said, I don't reply to them all, but I do read them all, talking about emails.

12
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,859
I'm the same way. I can't reply to them, but I do read them and I do appreciate them.

13
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:41,469
But why I bring up this topic of comments and people sending me messages is, what I get a lot of times in any of my inboxes

14
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:50,469
are people telling me that the videos that I make, the content I make, whether it's a comedy video or a discussion video, anything, it helps out their life.

15
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:57,469
They watch it and they feel better about themselves, they feel better about the world, they're going through depression, they're going through some tough times.

16
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:02,650
And they watch these videos from just from a YouTuber like me and it helps them out.

17
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:09,270
And I'm not going to solely say that like, oh, it's just because I'm such a good, it's a lot of different people.

18
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,270
There's a lot of people on this website that make fantastic content, very uplifting, fun, awesome content.

19
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,270
I'm not the only one that makes videos. There's plenty of other people.

20
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:27,750
But knowing that what I'm doing could potentially be helping somebody else in a much deeper way than I ever could possibly have imagined is life changing.

21
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:35,550
Being able to directly impact somebody else's life through video content is amazing.

22
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,550
And I really, truly hope that I can help out in any way I can, guys.

23
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:45,919
If you're watching the videos for fun and then you move on, if you're watching the videos to get away from something, I'm glad I'm here.

24
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,919
I'm glad there's a lot of us here on this site that can help you do that, that can help you through that.

25
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,099
And I mean that from the very bottom of my soul. I really do mean that.

26
00:02:55,099 --> 00:03:02,069
A lot of you guys already know this. I've went through fucking all kinds of depression in the last, you know, 10 years.

27
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:06,069
I'm not perfect. I'm not a perfect guy. Like, I'm not.

28
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,069
I've gone through plenty of problems in my life. And I've gone through plenty of issues.

29
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,069
And I've gone through plenty of times where I've been like, you know what? Fuck it.

30
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:18,699
But the more you dwell on stuff like that, the more you're going to bring yourself down into a place you don't want to be.

31
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,699
You don't want to be there. Trust me on that. You do not want to be there.

32
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:27,699
You want to be up. You want to be high. You want to be on the mountain. You want to be shouting from the mountaintops, baby.

33
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:30,699
Sawmill. That was a reference to one of Star's videos. But whatever.

34
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:33,939
You want to be in a position where you're happy.

35
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:41,740
And if I can help you get there, if I can help you do that with these videos, then god damn it, I'm going to keep doing it.

36
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,740
And I'm going to try my absolute hardest to make the best videos I can.

37
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,740
To make the funniest videos I can. To make the most entertaining videos I can.

38
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,740
That's what I'm all about. That's what this channel is all about.

39
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:58,979
This channel is not about anything else. That's the number one thing. That's the number two thing.

40
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,979
That's the number three thing. The top three things of my channel are that.

41
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,979
And everything else is underneath.

42
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:13,469
And the whole purpose of this video, the whole reason why I made this video, why I opened up Audacity, why I started talking in the first place,

43
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:17,949
is to say thank you to those of you that have watched these videos.

44
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:21,189
That, you know, it's not a subscriber milestone, like I said in the beginning.

45
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:24,189
Not like, oh, 200k, no. I just want to say thanks.

46
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:33,540
Because me making videos that you guys enjoy, or that help out your life in some way, anyway, makes me want to be a better person.

47
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,540
Makes me want to strive to make better content, strive to make better videos, more entertaining things, have more ideas, more experiments.

48
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,540
It's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jerma upstairs in my noggin lately.

49
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,540
Because I got a lot of ideas, and I want to do them.

50
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,300
But we're not going to go into that now.

51
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,540
And to close this video out, I'm only going to take about 30 seconds or so in this video,

52
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:58,720
because if you're having problems, if you're having real problems, talk to somebody.

53
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,720
You have to. You have to get in touch with somebody.

54
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,959
Because it's not healthy to stay mad, to stay depressed.

55
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,379
It's not a healthy thing. I know. I know.

56
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,379
Take it from me. I know.

57
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:15,379
You don't want to be sad. You don't want to be depressed about certain things.

58
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:19,379
You want a good old grandma for Christine to help you.

59
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,379
That's a new character. I don't know who that is.

60
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,680
You want to be happy. So try to get happy.

61
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Try to find ways to make you happy.

62
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,860
And if I can make you happy, like I said, god damn it, I'm going to keep fucking doing it.

63
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,860
So thank you everybody for watching. I really do appreciate it.

64
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,160
I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care everybody.
