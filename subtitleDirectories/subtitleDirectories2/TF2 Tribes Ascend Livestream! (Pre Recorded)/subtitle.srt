00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:23,949
will be up on YouTube. This whole thing.

5
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:28,180
Again, because I didn't check that.

6
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,669
Where from Massachusetts am I from?

7
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,379
I am from Boston. I guess I'm not

8
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,379
really from Boston. I'm kind of

9
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:38,379
from a suburb of Boston, but

10
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:40,379
I'm close enough where I can say I'm from Boston, I guess.

11
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,439
Let's get a zero out of

12
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,939
chart 24.

13
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:54,830
Any zero out of 32? There it is.

14
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,280
Alright, how about this one?

15
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,870
Here's the IP. I know what Redding is.

16
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,139
I have family members in Redding.

17
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:16,290
That's pretty cool. Alright, the

18
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,980
IP is going in the chat right now.

19
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,800
Make sure I get in there first. There you go.

20
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:37,139
What's going on, guys?

21
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,139
Bad water basin. Let's fill this server up, huh?

22
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:54,740
Come on, let's go.

23
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,189
I don't got all day.

24
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:00,740
Who am I kidding? I got plenty of time.

25
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,620
I got all the time in the world.

26
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,480
That's not really that true.

27
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,540
Zero to zero. Where is everybody?

28
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm the only person. Did I give the right server?

29
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,600
I think I did, didn't I? Hope I did.

30
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,220
I hope I gave the right server.

31
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:33,860
Let me make sure I did.

32
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,259
This is the one, right? Yeah, okay.

33
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,839
Copy. Yeah, I'm going to put it in there again

34
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:54,300
just in case. Just in case.

35
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,300
Alright, it looks like that was the right server.

36
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:04,100
I hope so.

37
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:14,639
Like you won't fight off.

38
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,639
I like your hat, Nimby. You get a cool hat.

39
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,439
First time in my stream because you are

40
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,439
six hours ahead. It is late for you.

41
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:29,699
You are a late dweller.

42
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,699
That guy's lagging. I don't want to kill him.

43
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,470
I feel bad. That guy was slow motion.

44
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:46,319
Got my lemonade over here on the left.

45
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,319
It has been really nice out.

46
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,319
I don't know what it's been like for you guys

47
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,750
wherever you live, but

48
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,750
my goodness, it has been so beautiful out here lately.

49
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,750
It's been 75 degrees,

50
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,180
80 degrees every single day.

51
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,180
And I've been going outside a lot.

52
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,550
I've been taking my new dog for walks.

53
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,110
You know that deal. Oh, I actually killed him.

54
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,819
Oh, that's a spy.

55
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,819
Oh, nice shot, dude. Nice shooting, Tex.

56
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:27,360
Funny spots.

57
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,600
Alright, what have we got here?

58
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,060
Ooh, good dodging.

59
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,699
Jump into it.

60
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,740
Damn. How long did the stream go? I just started.

61
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,980
I literally just started like

62
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:51,870
five minutes ago. Oh, boy, that's death.

63
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:58,660
Oh, come on. Pyro versus Pyro.

64
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:06,060
Oh, I didn't kill him.

65
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,220
Oh, I thought he was going to go to the...

66
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm going to die. He knows how much health I have.

67
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:21,149
Oh, run away. Dead.

68
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:23,149
Aquafire 102. What's up, dude?

69
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:26,990
No demo, man. I'll change the setup.

70
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,300
Oh, by the way, if anybody has noticed,

71
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
I'm not sure if you've noticed. Oh, God, there's that spray again.

72
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,730
But, my...

73
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,220
I changed my FOV. I made it bigger.

74
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,220
I'll show you what I did.

75
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,220
I didn't make it too huge, but

76
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,850
here's my FOV now.

77
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,409
I changed it to like 30% more,

78
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:47,580
and I made my

79
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,950
weapon view model like 30% more.

80
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,950
So, if you've noticed that, I know a lot of people were saying,

81
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,950
please change that.

82
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,830
So, I did.

83
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,139
And it actually is a little bit better.

84
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:07,580
Easier to see things.

85
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,639
I got a healer now. Alright. That guy's got a buff of Vienna.

86
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,620
Oh, I didn't kill him. He walked right over it, too.

87
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,049
What? Where did he come from?

88
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:22,740
Where did he even come from?

89
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,980
Was he the medic? No, the medic was healing me.

90
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,750
Like, that medic behind me was healing me.

91
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,440
He just came out of legit nowhere.

92
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Dear Engi, I sapped your sentries. See you again soon,

93
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,000
lol, spy.

94
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,879
Spray over.

95
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,879
That's a nice spray, though. What? That's how he gets in here.

96
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,870
He's still alive.

97
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:49,299
Don't let him get me. Don't let him get me.

98
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:52,179
Oh, he's got nowhere to go now. How did he get that?

99
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,740
He's gonna get me.

100
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,169
He's doing a side stab.

101
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:59,470
He's gonna move. Yeah.

102
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,500
There we go. Dear Engi, I sapped your sentries.

103
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,809
Oh, and I'll move that.

104
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,809
That's mean.

105
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:11,259
We're getting rolled right now.

106
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,259
Oh my god, I haven't done anything.

107
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:21,779
Why do I only have like one kill?

108
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:27,860
Oh, you're making me waste my stuff, scout.

109
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:35,779
Oh, come on. How did I not hit him?

110
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:41,340
Let's get him out of here.

111
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,340
He's not dead. He is not dead. He is definitely still alive.

112
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:50,190
Alright, let's go for a super spam shot here, dude.

113
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,309
Come on, walk over that.

114
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:57,779
Oh my god.

115
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,659
Chaos.

116
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,730
What do I have crits for?

117
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,990
What a waste.

118
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,169
Let me get the medic at least.

119
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,169
Thank goodness. If I didn't kill that medic, I would have been so upset with myself.

120
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:20,940
Do I like Twitch or do I like YouTube better?

121
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,870
I mean, YouTube has a lot of problems right now.

122
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,870
There's a lot of glitches with YouTube.

123
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,370
There's a lot of bugs and stuff.

124
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,610
And it's in beta. I can understand that.

125
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,419
But I would definitely say the process is much easier on Twitch.

126
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:40,820
That's what I will just say at least.

127
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
The YouTube stream is better quality though.

128
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
Because I'm partnered on YouTube and I'm partnered through Machinima.

129
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
So the YouTube stream will look better.

130
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,059
But, I don't know.

131
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:52,059
Hopefully they fix up some of their bugs.

132
00:11:52,059 --> 00:12:00,940
I'm confident they will.

133
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:10,659
Whoa. Somebody walked through there.

134
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:13,470
Medic!

135
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:19,090
Yeah, I'll go combat engine next.

136
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,899
Look at all these people. My goodness.

137
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,940
Oh, don't get yourself killed.

138
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:32,720
Oh man.

139
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,789
Oh, come on. Kill somebody.

140
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:40,129
Oh, I got the medic. Good.

141
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:43,120
Oh, keep coming. Oh no!

142
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,059
Come on, give me the health.

143
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:48,940
What? Uber! What? Escape! Escape!

144
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,750
Damn.

145
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:01,470
Thought I was going to escape. But I didn't.

146
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,570
Boom. Yeah, after this round I'm going to go combat engine.

147
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,129
Oh, there's a crit dude right there.

148
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:14,259
Oh no, give me away.

149
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,259
Where's the spy? Oh, he's up top there.

150
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:19,629
He's going up this way. Get him!

151
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,320
Why am I stuck on the staircase?

152
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,990
Is that another spy?

153
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,190
Yeah, there he is.

154
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,190
Everyone's running frantically around chasing this spy.

155
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,190
Oh, I'll walk over that, please.

156
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,190
Somebody go to the left side.

157
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,820
Come on. Dare you.

158
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,220
I double dog dare you.

159
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,379
Anybody up there? I'll leave that there.

160
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:51,820
That can be the defense spam.

161
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,059
Oh god. Anybody in the car?

162
00:13:54,059 --> 00:14:00,190
No, not yet. Get away from me.

163
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,429
Yeah, come on. Get on the car now.

164
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:07,740
Come step on that car. You know you want to.

165
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,500
Somebody get on that car. I want to blow it up.

166
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:18,929
I need to get healed.

167
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:20,929
Wait, is there a spy up at spawn?

168
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:23,490
I might have to go deal with that. Hold on.

169
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,370
Oh, I just launched myself into nowhere.

170
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,799
What? What is going on?

171
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,220
Why? Why are they bouncing?

172
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,250
Where's the spy?

173
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:42,269
He's freaking me out. Was that a sniper?

174
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:47,309
No. Yikes.

175
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:50,320
The IP, I linked it a while ago.

176
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,940
I'm going to be changing servers after this anyways.

177
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,940
Get more people into the game.

178
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,299
There's a lot of people in this room.

179
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:03,580
There's definitely a lot of people still in here.

180
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,850
Oh, crits. Oh, I didn't get anybody.

181
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:15,870
Come on, damn.

182
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,620
A soldier? Hold on. I've got to deal with this.

183
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,700
Oh!

184
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,259
That's a spy.

185
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:27,389
That's definitely a spy. No way. Maybe not.

186
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,830
No, it's not a spy.

187
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:37,419
Oh my god.

188
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:39,860
I was not ready for this, but I'm going to do it anyways. Let's do it.

189
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,860
Oh, come on. There may be something over here.

190
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:48,059
I can blow people up. Come on. Die, you bastard.

191
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,720
Jerma is a wizard. Official.

192
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,620
Let's go. Woohoo.

193
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,070
Oh, man. Look at all those people.

194
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,139
How am I doing?

195
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,049
Not that bad.

196
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:20,610
No 720 here.

197
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:27,259
I'm not partnered on Twitch.

198
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:29,259
It's over. I owe gaming.

199
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:36,240
Register today.

200
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:44,419
I killed myself. Damn.

201
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:46,419
I want to start live streaming soon.

202
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:49,419
Any advice on how to get started? Oh, yeah.

203
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:51,419
Most important thing is your internet needs to be able to handle it.

204
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,980
That's, I'd say, the number one thing.

205
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,980
Go to speedtest.net

206
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,159
and run a speed test.

207
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,159
I'd say if you upload speed,

208
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,399
if your upload speed is less than one,

209
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
like 1.0,

210
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
one megabit per second up,

211
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,769
I'd say it might be difficult for you to stream

212
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:10,769
in good quality.

213
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:13,009
But if you're higher than one or two

214
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:15,180
megs up,

215
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,509
you should be fine to stream.

216
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,509
I mean, you guys have been here before when I've had problems

217
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:22,509
streaming. I mean, I have 10 up connection.

218
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:25,700
Oh my god.

219
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:31,950
Somebody run over that. There we go.

220
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,950
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. That's what I wanted.

221
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,049
Run. But you guys have been to streams before

222
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:40,049
where it's been unwatchable from lag.

223
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:42,049
And I have a 10 up connection.

224
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:44,609
It's just weird.

225
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:52,420
The internet is a weird place.

226
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,420
And also I'd also say you need a pretty good processor

227
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,589
and video card because essentially your computer's

228
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:58,960
doing kind of like double work.

229
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:09,549
Oh, no, I got crit rocket.

230
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:13,579
Oh, I got two cats, man. I love cats.

231
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:16,339
I love any animal.

232
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,339
The only animal that I could probably say I don't like

233
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:21,839
is, I don't know,

234
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,460
maybe like, this is a hard

235
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,019
question. The only animal that I don't think

236
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,019
I would like to... Oh my god, another Uber.

237
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:31,019
This is ridiculous. I'd like

238
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:33,519
the Uber machine tonight.

239
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,230
Oh,

240
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,900
that was crazy.

241
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,140
Anyways, probably an animal

242
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,140
big enough that will like literally kill me

243
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,150
if I go near it. So

244
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,720
probably something like that. Oh, yeah, four up

245
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,470
is fine. You'll be fine with four up.

246
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:08,130
Here we go. Oh, boy.

247
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,130
God, I feel like the other team's

248
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,009
getting neglected. Spread the Ubers around.

249
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:15,440
I don't need them all. No, I'm just kidding.

250
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,460
We're going up top here. Or I could

251
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,460
just apparently not detonate the

252
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,779
mine. What's going on here? What's going on

253
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,519
here? So many people. So

254
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:33,789
many people to spam. This is

255
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:37,950
chaos. Oh, this is absolute chaos.

256
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:44,160
Oh my god. This is

257
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
ridiculous. 32 player servers

258
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,690
are insanity. Yeah, this...

259
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,059
Oh my god. Yeah, there's a

260
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,059
full group in here, man.

261
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,259
Yeah, right after this round ends, I'm

262
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:03,140
gonna hop on a new server. Oh,

263
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:10,180
fly. Oh, that's a double.

264
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:17,460
That's a double. Let's go up here.

265
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,000
Hey. Hey, you. Oh, you're real.

266
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,819
I was going to high five

267
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:32,220
him.

268
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Oh, you want to high five? Oh, sure, I'll

269
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,220
high five you and then just explode

270
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,299
myself. Wow,

271
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,980
that was pretty

272
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,980
unintelligent of me. But yeah,

273
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,680
that's what I do.

274
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
All right, new server. I'm gonna say new

275
00:20:49,680 --> 00:21:01,569
server. Oh, you want to high...

276
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:04,190
See, my brain. A lot of you guys already know

277
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,329
this. Sometimes I just don't think.

278
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:09,890
It happens quite often, actually.

279
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:15,759
All right, let's see. Let's see

280
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:23,819
here. Hmm. I would say

281
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:25,819
let's play a randomizer server, but

282
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,819
for my streams, I like to

283
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,819
get a lot of people into the games.

284
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:31,819
As many people as I possibly can that are

285
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:34,259
watching. So, I don't

286
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,259
want to just, you know, because most of the randomizer

287
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:38,259
and arena mod type servers, they're

288
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:40,259
always full. They always have, you know,

289
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,259
23 out of 24, so I would be the only

290
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,880
one that would be able to get in. So, I

291
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
like to have people from the stream get priority

292
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
and come and play and stuff like that. So,

293
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,529
let's find another server. This

294
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:54,769
one was 32. All right, oh my god,

295
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:59,630
there's so many loading. Looking for

296
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,190
32. High tower, got a bunch of bots,

297
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:07,309
eh. Will I ever do a workout

298
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:10,319
video? I've

299
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,319
thrown it around. I was gonna do it a long time

300
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,259
ago, but it's just, I

301
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,259
don't know if people would even watch it.

302
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:19,259
I know that there would be a very small

303
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:21,890
group of people that would probably watch it,

304
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,130
but I don't know if, like, how

305
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,130
it would be received. I think a lot of people

306
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,130
would be like, what the hell are you doing?

307
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,269
Why are you, like, lifting weights?

308
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,509
24, 25, 32.

309
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:38,140
Uh, okay.

310
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,140
Well, here we go. Good old fashioned dust ball.

311
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,029
Here is the IP.

312
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:50,109
Oh, and everyone's always asking about

313
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:52,609
Enlighten, the new Enlighten.

314
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:54,609
I'm working on it right now. So,

315
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:57,039
there will be a new Enlighten in the next couple

316
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:04,509
of days. Working on it right now.

317
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,750
Yeah, I'll probably do

318
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,750
another one of those videos where I give advice,

319
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,750
and I'll probably do, like, maybe a one or two minute

320
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,750
a vlog type thing where I show you

321
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,440
some stuff, but I'm not sure I would do, like,

322
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
a 20 minute workout video.

323
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,680
Like, okay, then up, then down,

324
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
then up, then left. I think that would

325
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,680
just be odd. I mean, I think that would be very

326
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,819
weird. Let's go blue. I was red last time.

327
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:34,880
Let's go blue. Boom. Boom. Boom.

328
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,450
What do I want to use? Oh, the new PDA.

329
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,950
What's gonna be? Oh my god!

330
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,509
And up,

331
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,509
and down, and left, and

332
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:50,509
egg.

333
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:55,549
And egg.

334
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:57,549
Alright, let me say this.

335
00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:59,549
Would you guys watch an egg workout

336
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:05,819
video? Like, if it was the egg.

337
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:10,180
What do I want to even play with?

338
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,250
I'll stay with this. I'll stick with this. Why not?

339
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:19,700
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

340
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,829
This server's like...

341
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,829
Does this server look weird?

342
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:27,390
I'm like, lagging. Oh, I'm trying. I tried to high-five them.

343
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:33,730
Oh wait, you can just hold your hand like that?

344
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,099
Oh yeah. High five,

345
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:39,549
baby. Alright, and I don't know

346
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:41,549
if it's the server or not, but is everybody

347
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:43,549
all jumpy? Because they are on my screen.

348
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:46,799
Like, lookit. Does anybody else see that?

349
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,779
We'll go... I don't wanna...

350
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:53,819
We'll go for one or two rounds like this.

351
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:55,220
Oh, high five! Here we go!

352
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,940
Swooping!

353
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,759
Yeah, I mean...

354
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:08,609
Oh god, everyone's like jumping all over the place for me.

355
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:10,690
Oh!

356
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,019
Sentra, damn!

357
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:13,980
Hey! Hey!

358
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,900
Hey!

359
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:20,049
What do you think you're doing?

360
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:21,970
Oh, I forgot I was gonna answer that question.

361
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,250
The reason why I don't do auto-reload is cause it...

362
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,329
Is somebody in here?

363
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:28,779
Like, the ghost of the pyro is just in that room with me.

364
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:29,859
Oh no!

365
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:33,329
Oh god, what do I do?

366
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:37,460
Alright, well here we are!

367
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,940
Oh, I'll block your way out.

368
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,740
You can't get out!

369
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,619
You're a dead ringer!

370
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:43,059
I got you blocked in!

371
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:44,589
Hey!

372
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,480
There's a tip right there.

373
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,240
If you shoot a dead ringer and you know he's a dead ringer,

374
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,299
just stand in the middle of the hallway.

375
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:58,009
And he can't get by you.

376
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:01,940
At least... At least sometimes.

377
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,380
Oh.

378
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,380
Dispatch are going up.

379
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:03,980
Up here.

380
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,180
I don't know why I decided to put them here.

381
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,549
This is a bad idea.

382
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:10,460
Oh jeez!

383
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,700
Where is my mini Sentra?

384
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,220
Why is it still alive?

385
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,579
Oh my god.

386
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:19,339
Getting distracted.

387
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:19,819
I get distracted.

388
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,680
I have ADD, man.

389
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,430
Wow, we already won?

390
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,150
My goodness.

391
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:30,460
Oh my goodness.

392
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,099
FG Spidey.

393
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:34,200
Betcha I can say your name.

394
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,109
I betcha a dollar I can say your name.

395
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:43,460
32-man Dustbowl is chaos.

396
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,710
I'm gonna go Huntsman Sniper.

397
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,970
If you want to throw me a duel, I'll absolutely do you.

398
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,900
Ah!

399
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,660
Oh, now I got a...

400
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,220
Oh, let me say it.

401
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,869
I got a Cyanagosa.

402
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:03,319
I think that's how you say it.

403
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:06,859
Cyanagosa.

404
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,660
And oh, by the way, if you're watching this on YouTube,

405
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,140
because I'm gonna upload this to YouTube afterwards,

406
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,900
yes, I am responding to people in the chat,

407
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,859
so don't just think I have some kind of weird disorder

408
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:19,559
where I just say random words.

409
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:24,019
Like I said that last time, too.

410
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,220
Oh, come on, this guy's gonna get headshot.

411
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,009
Right now.

412
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:30,180
Right now, here we go, ready?

413
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,859
I don't think you know, I don't think you understand.

414
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:36,059
I don't think you understand, here it comes.

415
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:39,029
Oh my god, he killed me.

416
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:42,660
Oh no, a different guy did.

417
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,950
Eggs.

418
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:51,619
Look at this egg.

419
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:53,500
Man, this server is lagging for me.

420
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,339
I'll tell you right now.

421
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:59,730
Oh, look at this double spy collateral.

422
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:07,230
Oh no, run away.

423
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,660
Oh, attack!

424
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,220
I can't even aim at people.

425
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,099
My screen is like, take a jellyfish.

426
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:18,940
Oh, he got me.

427
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:32,099
Oh, look at this server.

428
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:33,299
I don't think this server was designed

429
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:36,210
to have this many people in it.

430
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,779
Oh, what, you wanna get covered in Jirardi?

431
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:39,619
Is that what you're saying?

432
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:40,779
You want me to come smash you?

433
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:41,619
Is that what you just said?

434
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,700
You want me to come smash your face in?

435
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,980
I got him.

436
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,309
Fan of Kid Icarus, I never played it.

437
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:52,509
Not even the original, and I'm an old bastard,

438
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:57,779
and I didn't even play the original.

439
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,859
Oh, that would've been sick.

440
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:08,019
I hurt somebody.

441
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:13,539
God, I love to kill somebody, finally.

442
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:14,700
I got my first kill ever.

443
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,299
Whoa, did you see where I shot?

444
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,299
If you're watching this on YouTube,

445
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:22,500
please rewind that and look at where I shot.

446
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,819
I shot like five feet over that guy's head,

447
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:27,390
and I still killed him.

448
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:34,079
No, oh God.

449
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,549
Let's just, all right, let's do it.

450
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:48,259
Oh, there was no way I was gonna get out of there.

451
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:51,630
A good, affordable graphics card.

452
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,240
That's a good one.

453
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,609
I'd say probably the GTX 550 or the 560.

454
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:03,720
I think those are both under 200 bucks, I think.

455
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,519
I don't know, under 100.

456
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,119
I think the 550 is, I don't know, the 550 Ti,

457
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:07,960
I think it's called.

458
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,519
I don't even remember.

459
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,599
Boom.

460
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,450
Oh, I missed him.

461
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:16,150
Oh God.

462
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:21,019
I think eggs should be a weapon.

463
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,500
I don't know how well they'd work.

464
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,960
Oh, SimSass, you got the 550?

465
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,470
Is the, how much is the 550?

466
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:37,490
And follow-up, is it a good graphics card?

467
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,930
Did you, did you, did you, did you, did you?

468
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,640
Oh my God.

469
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,920
Hey, what's going on?

470
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:48,210
Just hiding over here, away from you.

471
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:56,960
No, no, please don't kill me, please.

472
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,809
Did you buy the 550 or did it come with your computer?

473
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:07,839
I'm still like thinking.

474
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,680
Medic, cover me.

475
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,440
Oh, I didn't get him.

476
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,279
Okay, yeah.

477
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,450
So the 550 is only like 130 bucks.

478
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,009
I'd say that's a good graphics card

479
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:22,130
to be able to save a little bit of money.

480
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,289
Because the 580 is, geez, what, like $500?

481
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:28,869
Something like that.

482
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:31,210
I know it's up there.

483
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,329
And they're already working on the 600, aren't they?

484
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:39,819
The 600 series.

485
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:41,089
Is that?

486
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:41,930
Okay, you're real.

487
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:42,750
You're the real deal.

488
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:48,500
I got you.

489
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,319
Oh, I'll cover them all.

490
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,160
Okay, okay.

491
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,940
Did I even get, no.

492
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:58,809
Get this one guy, come on.

493
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:00,210
The 680 is out now?

494
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,569
Oh dear Lord, what is that?

495
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:06,680
Like $900?

496
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,960
Can only imagine.

497
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:17,859
Woo!

498
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:22,539
I don't think we're going to win this.

499
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:29,700
Oh God, there's people over there too.

500
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,279
All right, I'm going this way.

501
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,599
Nobody up here?

502
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:37,579
We almost just got it.

503
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:40,289
Oh, he's still alive, he's still alive.

504
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:42,039
Hey, he's turned around, he's behind you.

505
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:45,140
Oh my God.

506
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:50,519
Dude, you just like crushed that guy.

507
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,839
Geez.

508
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:57,430
Oh, forget that, I'm going this way.

509
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,269
Oh my God.

510
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,589
What's my favorite movie?

511
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:10,140
Hmm, I don't know.

512
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,099
Probably Ghostbusters, or Memento, or The Dark Knight,

513
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:16,630
or one of the Muppet movies,

514
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,369
or there's a lot of movies I've watched that I like.

515
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:21,410
I'm not a big movie watcher though.

516
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,789
I'm not even a big TV watcher either.

517
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:34,799
Oh my God, I just missed his head.

518
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,440
Oh, this guy could be toast.

519
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,500
Oh my God.

520
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:44,150
They're all here for me.

521
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,619
Oh, this guy doesn't even know I'm here.

522
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:54,660
Damn it.

523
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,099
Fight Club is also a good one, Ari.

524
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:59,779
Fight Club is a good one.

525
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:02,609
I remember the first time I watched Fight Club.

526
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:03,569
I was so confused.

527
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:07,680
I think I was like 16, or like 17.

528
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,920
When did that movie come out?

529
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,639
Somebody do a quick research and find out

530
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,880
when did Fight Club release it?

531
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,869
When did it come out in theaters?

532
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:16,349
Get somebody right in the foot, ready?

533
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:17,190
Right in the toe.

534
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,679
Aw.

535
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,679
Oh my God, hide.

536
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,690
Hey, you wanna see if like grandpa can beat box?

537
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,690
I don't think he can.

538
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,570
I would assume grandpa could not beat box.

539
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,519
1999, okay.

540
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,300
Oh, so that means I was.

541
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,329
So 10 years ago was 2009, so 10, 11, 12.

542
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:46,400
So that was 13 years ago.

543
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,639
I was, hmm.

544
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,099
So I'm 26, 16, 15, 14, 13.

545
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,980
I definitely didn't watch it when I was 13.

546
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:04,750
I don't think my parents would have let me do that.

547
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,670
I mean, once I watched it,

548
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,949
I think the first time I watched it

549
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:12,289
when I was like 15 or 16, something like that,

550
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:14,340
and I was confused.

551
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,559
I was absolutely confused.

552
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,719
Office Space is a good movie, too.

553
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,199
The thing is, I've seen a lot of movies,

554
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,719
but I don't watch a lot of movies.

555
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,719
If that makes any sense to anybody,

556
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:31,570
then oh my God, I just accidentally got that guy.

557
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,409
Greetings from Chile.

558
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:37,110
Greetings from East Coast, USA, dude.

559
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,949
It's either very early or very late for you.

560
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:39,789
I'm not sure.

561
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:41,690
Actually, no, I think we're in the same time zone.

562
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,679
We're close, the same time zone.

563
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,800
Oh my God.

564
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,940
All right, time to play Scout.

565
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,630
My real name is Jeremy.

566
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:59,559
It's Jeremy, J-E-R-E-M-Y.

567
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,800
Look at all these people he's blowing out.

568
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,179
Look at this good pyro right here.

569
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:06,659
Just running around blowing all the teammates out.

570
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:10,139
You get a gold star.

571
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:11,739
No, it's not Jeremiah.

572
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:14,869
It's just Jeremy.

573
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:21,949
Oh, there's a lot of people right there.

574
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:29,260
Hmm, watch it, watch it, watch it.

575
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,820
All right, Scout's not gonna work.

576
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,320
I'll go medic.

577
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,440
Do I like Irish people?

578
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,019
I do, I am Irish.

579
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:46,579
I am Irish, so.

580
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,780
Look at this server.

581
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:52,050
All right, I'm gonna change servers after I die next

582
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,539
just because this server is very laggy.

583
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:55,380
Look at this guy.

584
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,289
It looks like he's part of a claymation.

585
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:05,659
Look at this claymation server we're on.

586
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:11,579
No, no, no, no, no, no.

587
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:12,820
Oh, this is why I like the quick fix

588
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,980
because you can just do this and it makes sense.

589
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:20,079
Oh my God, that was the guy I just healed.

590
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,269
New server.

591
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:29,110
That new server, what's this?

592
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:34,179
Oh yeah, he defeated me.

593
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:36,539
Probably hop on one more server

594
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:39,130
and try some Tribes of Sen

595
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,440
because that game is really cool.

596
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,519
Let's go zero out of 24 this time

597
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:51,670
just to keep the lag factor down a little.

598
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,590
King of the Hill Sawmill, no.

599
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:57,230
King of the Hill Nucleus, that could be good.

600
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,840
Mm-mm, no.

601
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,199
King of the Hill, no.

602
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,420
High tower, eh.

603
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,730
I'm torn, guys, I don't know where to go.

604
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,170
You are garbage, Jerva, why?

605
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:20,230
What did I do?

606
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:29,699
Badwater Mountain Lab, a day in the life of Jerva.

607
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:36,460
Where I just eat like Cheetos and take a bath.

608
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,199
All right, we're gonna go here.

609
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,920
We're gonna go to Viaduct.

610
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:53,380
Coth Viaduct, there's the IP.

611
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,550
I put the IP right in the chat.

612
00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:01,719
Should say a little camera next to my name.

613
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:10,420
Oh, let's go.

614
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,190
Let's go spy.

615
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,269
This is a very weird load-up.

616
00:39:16,269 --> 00:39:24,460
I'm not sure what I was trying to do here.

617
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:31,659
Oh, I got the strange dead ringer.

618
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:33,219
The server's full, the server's full.

619
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:43,789
Sermer, what am I talking about?

620
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:46,760
If you can't get in or you're trying to get in,

621
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:53,460
I do apologize.

622
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,420
I think I do have a strange, oh, death.

623
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,980
Thanks for pointing that out.

624
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,260
Well, it's gonna belong to somebody else pretty soon,

625
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:11,579
so might as well rack up as many kills on it as I can, right?

626
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,139
Hey, look, I'm an engineer walking at you

627
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:14,460
from the other side.

628
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,800
Oh, you got me.

629
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:30,730
Damn, how dare you kill me like that.

630
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:35,300
If I could go pro at any sport, baseball.

631
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,659
I've always wanted to be a baseball player.

632
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:42,130
Not exactly sure why, but I just have.

633
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,269
Used to play baseball when I was younger.

634
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:52,739
Into high school, then I stopped in high school.

635
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:53,900
Oh, my death.

636
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,179
So that way, now they're gonna all know

637
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:56,420
that I just dead rung.

638
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:04,090
Dead rung, is that even like a word?

639
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,690
Oh, let's protect this point.

640
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:09,409
I'm a pyro, I do that the best.

641
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:18,710
That was just a scared chaos stab right there.

642
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,989
Now, what are you wearing?

643
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:25,150
Oh, the team is still trickling in.

644
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,219
Well, look, I'm just coming out of spawn myself.

645
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:30,579
Hey, look, so let's get out of spawn together.

646
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:35,079
What did, what?

647
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,199
Oh, Jerma, I'm cheating.

648
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:42,090
I'm watching your stream.

649
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:45,550
Is my name even Jerma right now yet?

650
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:52,340
Oh, Scrumpadump, Harvey Hamburger, George Bumberson.

651
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,789
I go by a lot of different titles.

652
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:57,869
I won't get out of my way.

653
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,800
Oh, you son of a B.

654
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,000
Well, that's like five million deaths in a row.

655
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:12,190
Is a spy, time to change something else.

656
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:16,070
Low FPS.

657
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,980
Oh, what am I even using?

658
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,300
Okay, I'll rock with this.

659
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:25,079
I'll roll with this, I'm cool with that.

660
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:33,179
Thought there was a spy.

661
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:37,780
Oh, what just happened?

662
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,119
Oh, my brain.

663
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:41,199
There was a soldier right there?

664
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:42,239
Oh, I just killed that medic.

665
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:48,380
I'm sorry, dude.

666
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:55,559
I don't think I've ever had a embarrassing name.

667
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:57,519
Oh, my preferred breakfast food?

668
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:59,489
Oh, are you kidding me?

669
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:03,980
Eggs, I had to say.

670
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,139
What do we got here?

671
00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:06,980
No more fooling around.

672
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:10,659
Let's get some kills.

673
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:12,980
Let's kill some bastards.

674
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,469
Get on this point.

675
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:17,789
Boys and girls.

676
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:22,599
Oh, where is he?

677
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:25,360
You are a spy.

678
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:31,940
Yep, because you're invisible now.

679
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,929
Well, that was a total not good idea.

680
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:38,949
Oh, what was, what?

681
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:43,079
Did I jump in the air?

682
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:50,019
Did I, what just happened to me?

683
00:43:50,019 --> 00:43:53,460
I don't even understand how that happened.

684
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,690
Maybe I did jump.

685
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:00,489
That's a buzz veered.

686
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:09,059
Kill Jerma, nice name.

687
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:11,550
Well, at least I got one kill.

688
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:15,630
Tad around.

689
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:21,329
Boink, boink, boink.

690
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:22,289
How do you open console?

691
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:33,710
It's the tilde key, the thing under escape.

692
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:37,440
Oh, I gotta do some expert rocket jumping, guys.

693
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,099
Here we go.

694
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:42,210
Expert rocket jumper.

695
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,050
Check me out.

696
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:51,090
I'll be on, I don't even know what the name of the site is.

697
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:54,519
So wait, why would I give up TF2?

698
00:44:54,519 --> 00:45:01,809
I thought I made this explicitly clear that I never was.

699
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:11,489
TF2 is a huge part of my existence.

700
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:14,179
Otto, Otto.

701
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:15,889
Where is Otto?

702
00:45:15,889 --> 00:45:18,000
That's a good question.

703
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,559
That's a sniper and he's gonna, no, he's not.

704
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:24,099
What is that?

705
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:27,860
God, that was awful.

706
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:32,829
Here we go.

707
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:43,960
Can I get like a string of two and three in a row here?

708
00:45:51,829 --> 00:46:03,170
And you, at least I'm killing people now.

709
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:14,679
Oh, my Liberty Launcher is now a new rank.

710
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:17,519
Yeah, I understand that phenomenal.

711
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:19,940
But to be honest, the items that I have

712
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,210
in my backpack right now, I mean,

713
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,210
I know I can understand like,

714
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,250
oh, he's giving away his whole backpack, he's gonna quit.

715
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,929
I understand that, but I mean,

716
00:46:28,929 --> 00:46:32,059
I have a lot of friends in Team Fortress

717
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:35,340
and a lot of people that, oh God, hold on.

718
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,949
Oh God, I just totally ruined that bush.

719
00:46:38,989 --> 00:46:41,110
Oh my God.

720
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,190
But I got a lot of friends in Team Fortress

721
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:46,610
and I have a lot of people that support me with this channel.

722
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:49,929
So any item that I ever wanna use, I can just get it back.

723
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:52,090
It might not be strange, it might not be genuine,

724
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,380
but that's, I don't care.

725
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,179
I figured because, like I said in the video,

726
00:46:57,179 --> 00:46:59,659
I started with Team Fortress 2

727
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:03,760
and I got all the support from you guys from Team Fortress,

728
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,369
a lot of you guys are Team Fortress guys,

729
00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:10,380
and that was a decent, decent shot.

730
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,820
And that's why I felt like doing it,

731
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,760
you know, just something I felt like doing.

732
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,820
And mine's made up, there's no going back now,

733
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,019
so it's gonna happen.

734
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:29,199
And let's see if I can, no, there's a mini sentry.

735
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:34,150
All right, after this round, go to one more server

736
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:42,440
and then I'm gonna hop and drive to send.

737
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,280
Boing, boing.

738
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,280
No, that was laggy.

739
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,739
Oh, I didn't wanna do that.

740
00:47:54,739 --> 00:48:01,619
Oh my God, what is going on with that guy?

741
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:06,039
That guy was just skydiving right there.

742
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:15,929
Oh, I'm dead, I am so dead.

743
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:17,570
Diddy, diddy, diddy, diddy, diddy.

744
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:23,090
Oh, you lagged out, yeah.

745
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:36,179
Boom, mission ends in 60 seconds.

746
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:38,400
Oh, how did I not hit him?

747
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,150
Mini sentry, get out of here.

748
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:51,139
Oh, there's a sniper, good to know.

749
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:56,780
Oh, this is where we get in trouble.

750
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:02,079
Somebody snip us, he's still alive.

751
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:09,590
Watch the spawn, Optimus Prime is on the loose.

752
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:17,679
No, you're real, where could he be?

753
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:23,829
Gotta get on that point, get on it, there we go.

754
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:35,929
Everyone just stop on here right now, there we go.

755
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:46,659
All right, one minute 40 seconds, we got this.

756
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:50,340
Hmm, you gotta back up.

757
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,780
Damn, every time I shoot a crit rocket,

758
00:49:51,780 --> 00:50:00,380
it just goes right by everybody.

759
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:09,420
Oh, boom, oh, no, no, no.

760
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:17,179
No, I just ruined this again.

761
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:19,500
Oh, I'm sorry medic, I'm an idiot.

762
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:35,309
Aw, yeah, Tribes is a free-to-play game right now.

763
00:50:35,309 --> 00:50:37,929
I would suggest everyone to go get it.

764
00:50:37,929 --> 00:50:41,889
If you play Team Fortress, you'll probably like Tribes.

765
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:45,880
It's just another one of those kind of fast-paced,

766
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,019
you know, projectile-based, crazy fun games.

767
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:51,550
FPS, it's first person shooter.

768
00:50:52,389 --> 00:50:58,429
All right, so let's add a new server, new server.

769
00:50:58,429 --> 00:51:00,190
All right, we'll do one more server here,

770
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,550
then I'm gonna hop into Tribes

771
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:14,099
for probably like a half an hour or so.

772
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:18,940
So we have 32, okay, let's go to,

773
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:23,239
we got, this one is open and it's Dustbowl.

774
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:27,659
Huh, we just did, we already did Dustbowl.

775
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:32,690
Busytown, what the hell is Busytown?

776
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:36,500
This one's well, we can do well.

777
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,369
Actually, no, no, no, no, that server might not be able to.

778
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:44,380
All right, we'll go to this one, CTF well.

779
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:56,940
And there you are, everyone join it.

780
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,469
Empty randomizer?

781
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:09,460
Um, I mean, eh, I mean, randomizer, is it really empty?

782
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:19,639
So those servers are like legit empty right now?

783
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:26,699
No, okay, next week we'll do randomizer.

784
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:33,380
We'll do some randomizer next week.

785
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:37,960
I'm gonna use the shortstop.

786
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,320
And I'm gonna put on the whole set.

787
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,519
Why not, right?

788
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:51,820
Why not?

789
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:56,420
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

790
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,460
Oh, the round's not even started, I'm gonna get a kill.

791
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:06,860
No, I'm not, too bad, woohoo.

792
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,139
Oh, I'm gonna sneeze, I gotta sneeze

793
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:10,280
and there's nothing I can do about it.

794
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,320
Oh, I'm gonna sneeze, here it comes.

795
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,340
No, no, false alarm.

796
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:20,059
No, oh man, sorry.

797
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:23,489
There's no button I can press to mute me.

798
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:24,730
Are we getting spawn trapped?

799
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:27,789
What's going on?

800
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:32,329
Thank you.

801
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:44,820
Mark, get me in here.

802
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:49,010
Oh god, they're gonna get crits.

803
00:53:49,010 --> 00:54:00,730
Damn, itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout.

804
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:08,130
Down came the rain and wiped out that god damn spider.

805
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:12,719
I just bumped into a spy, but I don't care.

806
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:18,389
Oh, get away from me, oh man.

807
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:25,550
No, you are not, you are real.

808
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:34,940
Well, is, he's still alive.

809
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,989
No, he's not, wait, what?

810
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:40,030
How is that, unless I actually really just killed him,

811
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:43,400
I don't think I did though.

812
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:49,360
Go up top, there's the health, that's what I wanted.

813
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:57,429
Oh god, no, this just bounced off the door

814
00:54:57,429 --> 00:55:04,460
and came back at me in the face.

815
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:12,929
Oh, come on away, give me my milk, give me my milk.

816
00:55:12,929 --> 00:55:23,099
Oh, all right, seven level, thanks for coming, man.

817
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:25,019
Will they ever do more duel commentaries?

818
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:29,420
Oh, hell yeah, I just did one the other night

819
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:40,710
on CSGO with MLC stealth.

820
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,309
Oh, just jump over everybody,

821
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:43,780
try and get around.

822
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:48,900
Oh, I was gonna get hit by the train.

823
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,260
Get me out of here, get me away from me.

824
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:57,860
Come on, just give me the stupid intelligence.

825
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,420
D-A-M-M, damn, damn.

826
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:16,019
Oh, what just, oh, I got backstabbed.

827
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:29,300
Dang it, do do do, do do do, special delivery.

828
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:36,369
All right, do do do, was this in the lower right?

829
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:40,360
Jerma sucks at TF2.

830
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:49,119
Oh, we got a troll, we got a troll.

831
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,639
All right, one more round of this.

832
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:57,590
I'm gonna go pyro this time.

833
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:09,199
Hmm, I always do not, I don't put on, let's go, yeah.

834
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:10,039
All right, last round,

835
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:26,780
then I'm gonna hop over to tribes, ascend, damn, ah.

836
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:30,579
All right, I gotta appear offline.

837
00:57:30,579 --> 00:57:32,820
We can't have any spam coming at me,

838
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:39,789
especially when it has bad, bad things.

839
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:47,739
Do do do do do do, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

840
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:48,659
Is somebody behind us still?

841
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:51,400
Oh, there he is.

842
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:57,340
No, God, I turned and saw the goddamn train.

843
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:02,019
Oh, I don't think I even have the hat,

844
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:05,480
but the degreaser said, to be honest.

845
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,380
Nah, I don't have the hat.

846
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,219
You know, I saw, I thought I could get by,

847
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:20,090
and then I turned and scared the crap out of myself.

848
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:22,769
Oh my God, they have crits, shoot at me.

849
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:28,380
Come on, all right, don't get hit by the train again.

850
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:40,960
Oh, oh, I almost got hit by the train again.

851
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,480
No, I'm gonna whack you.

852
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:56,219
Oh, damn it, where is Burger Boy?

853
00:58:56,219 --> 00:59:02,590
Where is Burger Boy?

854
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:08,449
How am I not letting him on fire?

855
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:10,090
Oh, does that mean we're gonna play

856
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:12,079
tribes, ascend with Burger Boy?

857
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:21,199
Special guest appearance from Burger Boy?

858
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:25,789
God damn it, Burger Boy, reveal yourself.

859
00:59:25,789 --> 00:59:28,579
He has?

860
00:59:28,579 --> 00:59:33,250
Burger Boy, Burger Boy's been in videos.

861
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:41,170
Oh, I'm out of ammo, oh, oh God.

862
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:46,610
Oh, my power jack, would I get one kill with it?

863
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,980
All right, train, me versus you.

864
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,820
What do you say, buddy, let's do this.

865
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:59,139
I lost.

866
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:08,710
Oh, we got crits.

867
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:14,619
Yes, I just wanna crit fire somebody.

868
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:23,909
Yeah, feels good to crit fire.

869
01:00:23,909 --> 01:00:26,420
It feels good to crit fire.

870
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:30,179
All right, we're going sniper.

871
01:00:30,179 --> 01:00:36,030
No, we're not, I'm going heavy.

872
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:39,719
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

873
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:44,610
Get away, oh, come on, right when I get out of spawn.

874
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:48,929
B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T,

875
01:00:48,929 --> 01:00:55,849
with six exclamation points after that.

876
01:00:55,849 --> 01:00:59,590
Wait, why do I have the Natasha equipped?

877
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:07,590
Okay, whatever, I'm so scared.

878
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:11,619
All right, I killed the spy from like 5,000 feet away.

879
01:01:11,619 --> 01:01:12,460
Where is this guy?

880
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,369
Oh, my God, he's on the roof.

881
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:18,760
I thought he was to the right.

882
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,679
All right, take this stupid thing off.

883
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:31,539
Give me the regular minigun.

884
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:39,039
All right, I gotta like really watch my back now.

885
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:41,079
Playing heavy, like probably the worst idea

886
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:45,619
I could have ever done.

887
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:49,380
I'm gonna be on fire, die, die, die, die, get away, get away.

888
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,539
Oh, thank you so much.

889
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:57,840
Oh, no, here comes another dude.

890
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,280
How are you still alive?

891
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,119
What?

892
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,360
I get hit by the train again.

893
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:11,940
Of course I get hit by the train again.

894
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:14,710
That would absolutely happen.

895
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:16,150
Oh, for the love of God.

896
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:22,539
Hey, we're gonna get crits, I think.

897
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:25,699
I hope we get crits right now.

898
01:02:25,699 --> 01:02:27,900
Oh, my God, of course.

899
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:36,539
We get crits and I die and I'm dead.

900
01:02:36,539 --> 01:02:39,989
Ugh.

901
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:50,260
Take that, take this, take that.

902
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,619
How are you still alive?

903
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:57,190
I knew it, I knew there was a guy behind me.

904
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,349
You got 32 person servers that are just like ridiculous.

905
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:05,940
They are like insane, insanity.

906
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,699
It's like you walk out the door and it's just like,

907
01:03:07,699 --> 01:03:16,260
oh, where is this guy?

908
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,099
I'm so scared of the spy just backstabbing me.

909
01:03:18,099 --> 01:03:24,780
It's definitely gonna happen, like right now.

910
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:31,659
Yo, I'll get hit by the train again.

911
01:03:31,659 --> 01:03:32,500
Oh, we won?

912
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,340
How did we win?

913
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:37,150
How am I in the number two right now?

914
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,840
All right, well, good night if you're leaving, man.

915
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,619
Thanks for coming.

916
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:50,300
So now I'm gonna head on to tribes.

917
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:58,559
Send time dudes and dudettes.

918
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,880
Thanks for playing, everybody.

919
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:08,820
All right, so I think I might invite a few people

920
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:12,789
into the call that have tribes.

921
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:18,150
Let's see how that goes.

922
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,469
I gotta change this to say,

923
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:21,780
I might actually do that in a minute.

924
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:22,619
Let me open up tribes.

925
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:25,570
The screen might go black for a second, guys.

926
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:30,090
So I apologize.

927
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:34,980
Screen is going to go black.

928
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,340
So bear with me for one second.

929
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:42,760
While I load up tribes, send.

930
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:46,260
Oh, I have ADHD, crazy bad.

931
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:50,659
I have really bad ADHD.

932
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:52,210
Jerma is dead.

933
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:55,019
I'm still here.

934
01:04:55,019 --> 01:05:03,030
Darkness, it's all I see.

935
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:05,539
I already did a setup video, Hannibal.

936
01:05:05,539 --> 01:05:07,900
Go to my 4,000 subscriber video.

937
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:11,960
It should be there.

938
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,440
Don't go into the light.

939
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,929
Now, my children, let me tell you something.

940
01:05:16,929 --> 01:05:21,420
I am God coming to you from the black screen.

941
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,099
Let me tell you, all you need to do

942
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:25,900
to have a good, fun, interesting life

943
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:33,289
is to crash, because that's what I think I just did.

944
01:05:33,289 --> 01:05:34,409
Oh, no, no, I'm just, I'm here.

945
01:05:34,409 --> 01:05:36,800
Okay, okay, hold on.

946
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,559
I really thought I just hard crashed right there.

947
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,289
That would have been bad.

948
01:05:42,289 --> 01:05:45,559
All right, let me get into the game.

949
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:52,849
Screen should come back in about 10 seconds, guys.

950
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:57,719
Settings, audio, yeah, that's fine.

951
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:02,699
Video, window, come on, let's go window, windowed.

952
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:08,000
All right, now I'm coming back.

953
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,860
Change the resolution.

954
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:17,510
All righty, let me just add this game

955
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:24,849
as a source into XSplit, and we should be good to go.

956
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:28,619
Game, hello.

957
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:29,980
Is that gonna fit?

958
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,820
Does that work?

959
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:41,610
Let's see, I think that fits, pretty sure at least.

960
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:43,659
Get that out of the way.

961
01:06:43,659 --> 01:06:45,260
What's with the double screen?

962
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:50,139
That's weird.

963
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:56,059
Hmm, hold on a second, guys.

964
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:57,340
I'm gonna change this.

965
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:58,780
This is a little glitchy.

966
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:04,940
I'm just gonna add the screen region.

967
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:07,659
That should be better.

968
01:07:07,659 --> 01:07:10,710
Okay, yeah, there we go.

969
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:18,179
All right, so that should be better.

970
01:07:18,179 --> 01:07:23,340
All right, so I think we're gonna get some people in here

971
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:28,980
talk while we play.

972
01:07:29,019 --> 01:07:31,849
Those of you that have never played this game,

973
01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:35,480
please, my goodness, please go download it.

974
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:39,420
It is an unbelievable game, and it's free.

975
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:42,619
What other reason do you need?

976
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:50,840
Move this, it's not in the way.

977
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:55,190
To the left, to the left, to the right, to the right.

978
01:07:55,190 --> 01:08:05,630
It needs to be moved a little bit.

979
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:09,630
All right, looks like it's centered,

980
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:15,289
at least on my screen.

981
01:08:15,289 --> 01:08:20,369
So are we gonna get anybody in this call?

982
01:08:20,369 --> 01:08:27,090
Maybe, what happened to the audio?

983
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:28,859
Audio's still here?

984
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:31,890
Yeah, it's here, I can hear it.

985
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:34,609
All right, somebody call me on Skype

986
01:08:34,609 --> 01:08:36,489
so we can start a call.

987
01:08:36,489 --> 01:08:39,520
Boo, or Stealth, or Burger Boy,

988
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,289
whichever one of you guys wants to do this thing,

989
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:45,250
and then just join off being home.

990
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,810
They might have already been calling.

991
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:50,060
Yeah, they are.

992
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:50,899
What up?

993
01:08:50,899 --> 01:08:53,119
Oh, what's up, Burger Boy?

994
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,720
Oh, Burger Boy, now Burger Boy's calling me.

995
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,720
Get outta here.

996
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,560
Oh, I'm inviting them this one.

997
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,680
Is Boo around?

998
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,880
I was first.

999
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,199
What about, where's Italics?

1000
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:05,199
Maybe Italics will play.

1001
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:06,039
Boo's offline.

1002
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:07,520
He might be doing a band thing right now.

1003
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,939
Oh, hey, everyone.

1004
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:13,649
Oh, what's up, Burger Boy?

1005
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:14,489
Make sure you guys are turning up.

1006
01:09:14,489 --> 01:09:18,409
Oh, I was trying to stream off the game.

1007
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:20,329
If somebody else wants to join,

1008
01:09:20,329 --> 01:09:22,449
can you guys monitor, or Stealth, can you monitor,

1009
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:24,859
just in case I'm in the game?

1010
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:25,699
Yeah, do it.

1011
01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:26,779
What's happening?

1012
01:09:26,779 --> 01:09:29,619
I'm just saying, when I alt tab in a window,

1013
01:09:29,619 --> 01:09:32,250
it just like explodes,

1014
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:37,409
so I can't really alt tab anymore.

1015
01:09:37,409 --> 01:09:39,010
But I wanna play the game.

1016
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:40,050
I mean, you could play the game,

1017
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,609
just every 10 seconds, just check this.

1018
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:48,069
So if you want, it's gonna be difficult

1019
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:49,710
to join the game off me right now,

1020
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:53,060
because the way this game works is you have to have,

1021
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,380
I don't know how many friends you can have

1022
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:57,079
to be honest, I really don't know.

1023
01:09:57,079 --> 01:10:01,029
But I'm gonna go Pathfinder.

1024
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:02,520
I'm gonna turn this up.

1025
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,430
Stream is under control.

1026
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:06,159
No one's spamming you.

1027
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:09,369
Stream is under control, and I gotta turn this up.

1028
01:10:09,369 --> 01:10:12,050
Turn this up.

1029
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:13,010
Can't hear it.

1030
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:13,850
All right, I think we're good.

1031
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:16,130
Boo's still with sound on the stream?

1032
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:17,460
Should be.

1033
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,300
Hey, Burger Boy, do you have frogs in the sun?

1034
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,979
Oh, he's got it.

1035
01:10:21,979 --> 01:10:23,739
He's absolutely got it.

1036
01:10:23,739 --> 01:10:25,619
So this game, if you don't know what this is,

1037
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:29,000
if you're like, what the hell are you doing right now?

1038
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,560
This game is pretty much,

1039
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,520
think of Team Fortress meets Quake meets skiing

1040
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,100
meets ski free meets Windows 95 meets Windows 98.

1041
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,260
I'm not sure if that made any sense,

1042
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:44,479
but this game is just, look at this, it's just chaos.

1043
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:46,840
Pretty much think of this game as you play as a soldier,

1044
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,279
like a Liberty Launcher soldier,

1045
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:51,069
and that's pretty much what everyone is using.

1046
01:10:51,069 --> 01:10:52,989
Then you ski around like 100 miles per hour,

1047
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:54,779
it's all about momentum,

1048
01:10:54,779 --> 01:10:58,340
and we just apparently won the game.

1049
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:59,300
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

1050
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,100
This game is Halo with speed hacks

1051
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:07,539
and cooler mechanics, in my opinion.

1052
01:11:07,539 --> 01:11:14,899
The music is cool.

1053
01:11:14,899 --> 01:11:17,880
I agree with what Jarvis said.

1054
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,659
All right, let's change.

1055
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:24,449
You go to a new map, but it's not really Halo.

1056
01:11:24,449 --> 01:11:28,710
It's like a, it's cooler than Halo, in my opinion,

1057
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
just because I never really played Halo, so.

1058
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:33,989
Because you never had an Xbox, you never could play.

1059
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:36,979
I had an Xbox, I had a 360.

1060
01:11:36,979 --> 01:11:38,829
When?

1061
01:11:42,529 --> 01:11:45,859
Two or three years ago was the last time I had one.

1062
01:11:45,859 --> 01:11:46,699
Oh, what's going on?

1063
01:11:46,699 --> 01:11:49,640
Why am I like stuck here?

1064
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:53,539
I'm like stuck in this like lobby area.

1065
01:11:53,539 --> 01:11:57,760
There we go.

1066
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,640
So it was lagging right there, screen was lagging.

1067
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:08,100
You kidding me?

1068
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,149
Let me know if it keeps happening, guys.

1069
01:12:10,149 --> 01:12:13,659
Try this again.

1070
01:12:13,739 --> 01:12:17,600
Because if it keeps happening, I might restart it.

1071
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:24,119
Just change a couple settings.

1072
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:25,479
But yeah, once you get like, on a,

1073
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:26,720
this game is so satisfying.

1074
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,939
I'm going Blood Eagle, by the way.

1075
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:33,109
You can get some real satisfying kills within this game.

1076
01:12:33,109 --> 01:12:34,869
Especially because it's all about long range,

1077
01:12:34,869 --> 01:12:37,180
just long ranging people, it's awesome.

1078
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,859
Oh, did you quit and join a different game?

1079
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:42,359
I did, just join off me.

1080
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:44,630
Oh, come on.

1081
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:47,550
Yeah, it like, kicks me out.

1082
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:51,939
Oh, sure it did.

1083
01:12:51,939 --> 01:12:52,779
No!

1084
01:12:52,779 --> 01:12:54,989
It took so long to key up.

1085
01:12:54,989 --> 01:12:58,329
Because Burger Boy is like, not allowed to play.

1086
01:12:58,329 --> 01:12:59,489
How do I not kill that guy?

1087
01:12:59,489 --> 01:13:01,340
Here we go.

1088
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:08,970
This is a beta, this is a beta.

1089
01:13:10,729 --> 01:13:12,699
Here's another kill.

1090
01:13:12,699 --> 01:13:13,819
It's free though, it's open.

1091
01:13:13,819 --> 01:13:15,159
Open beta.

1092
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:16,000
Oh, he was in the air.

1093
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,079
Why didn't you probably order a zerg shooter

1094
01:13:17,079 --> 01:13:23,140
and get that free crit?

1095
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,300
You get three shots.

1096
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,460
Pretty much, the path finders like the scout,

1097
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,579
you move around really fast,

1098
01:13:27,579 --> 01:13:33,560
and soldiers like the soldier, I guess.

1099
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,399
There's like, I think, nine classes in this game.

1100
01:13:35,399 --> 01:13:37,000
I'm pretty sure there is.

1101
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,600
This is just team deathmatch.

1102
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:43,689
And essentially, what the, why do we, what the hell?

1103
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:48,449
I keep joining a game, we keep just winning.

1104
01:13:48,449 --> 01:13:49,289
Don't go home.

1105
01:13:49,289 --> 01:13:50,130
Don't quit.

1106
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:51,130
All right, do not quit this one.

1107
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:56,869
Keep staying, stay in this one.

1108
01:13:56,909 --> 01:14:02,130
Down, down.

1109
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:07,600
But you see this up here, this 2700 XP.

1110
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,270
Pretty much, if you don't wanna buy the game,

1111
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:11,729
the game doesn't cost any money,

1112
01:14:11,729 --> 01:14:12,970
but it's kinda like in Team Fortress

1113
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:16,489
where there's an economy where you can buy items

1114
01:14:16,489 --> 01:14:18,210
if you don't wanna wait and unlock them.

1115
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:19,779
It's kinda like that.

1116
01:14:19,779 --> 01:14:21,800
So if you wanna spend money, you can,

1117
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,899
but if you don't, it takes a long time

1118
01:14:23,899 --> 01:14:27,420
to get all the items and all the classes and everything, so.

1119
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:31,100
And it's like an exaggerated long time.

1120
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,140
Yeah.

1121
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:37,510
Like 90 hours of game time to unlock a new class.

1122
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:39,550
Yeah, you start with three classes

1123
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:42,359
when you just get the game free.

1124
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:46,600
You can spend 10, 20 bucks and you'll unlock everything,

1125
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,439
pretty much.

1126
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:48,260
What's gonna go in German?

1127
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:53,829
I'm gonna go Blood Eagle, Pathfinder again.

1128
01:14:53,829 --> 01:14:55,470
I'm gonna turn the graphics down a tiny bit

1129
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:57,409
just because I think people were saying it was lagging.

1130
01:14:57,409 --> 01:14:59,859
Burger Boy, you went on the other team.

1131
01:14:59,859 --> 01:15:00,699
Oh, Burger Boy.

1132
01:15:00,699 --> 01:15:04,789
What?

1133
01:15:04,789 --> 01:15:07,430
Oh, how do I switch teams in this game?

1134
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:08,550
Did you just press escape?

1135
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:12,899
Yeah, you're gonna escape and then switch teams?

1136
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:14,979
Oh, this guy's toast down here.

1137
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,060
This guy's toast, guys.

1138
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:24,270
Oh, get him!

1139
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,539
Right shot.

1140
01:15:25,539 --> 01:15:30,750
And let's just do it off.

1141
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:31,590
There it is.

1142
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:35,930
All right, so as you can see, I got a shotgun.

1143
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:37,010
You pretty much only have two weapons.

1144
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:38,970
I have grenades, too, but I don't really use them.

1145
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:43,229
I mean, I know I should, but.

1146
01:15:43,229 --> 01:15:47,189
And see the top, the middle top, 97, 92?

1147
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:49,149
This is team deathmatch, and essentially how this works

1148
01:15:49,149 --> 01:15:51,390
is when you die, one point gets taken off

1149
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:54,949
your side of the team, but if your team has the flag,

1150
01:15:54,949 --> 01:15:57,770
or if their team has the flag, kills count as two.

1151
01:15:57,770 --> 01:16:00,250
So we have the flag right now, so any time we kill somebody

1152
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:01,970
on their team, it's gonna count as two points

1153
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,390
taken down from their score.

1154
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:09,579
Oh, I just got nailed.

1155
01:16:09,579 --> 01:16:11,470
So it's lagging, huh?

1156
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,590
No, let me see what the hell's going on here.

1157
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:15,270
Wasn't doing this on Team Fortress, was it?

1158
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,479
No, it wasn't.

1159
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:18,520
Let's find out what the hell is going on.

1160
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,310
It's too graphic with a management string.

1161
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:22,930
No, that's my flag.

1162
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:26,180
Shouldn't be.

1163
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:27,020
I'm watching.

1164
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,859
By the way, are you still on the terrorist thing?

1165
01:16:28,859 --> 01:16:29,699
Yeah.

1166
01:16:29,699 --> 01:16:30,859
Oh, you're still on CT?

1167
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:33,420
Oh yeah, I got the flag, come get me.

1168
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:34,840
Okay.

1169
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,880
Oh, you're on the enemy team, huh?

1170
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,000
Come get me, okay.

1171
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:44,260
Destroyed.

1172
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:50,760
Oh, come on, let's go 1v1, baby.

1173
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:55,069
Oh, I got me, damn, got me.

1174
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:56,430
It looks okay on my end.

1175
01:16:56,430 --> 01:17:00,039
When I'm watching the stream right now, it looks okay.

1176
01:17:00,039 --> 01:17:02,199
Maybe it was just like a little issue, I don't know,

1177
01:17:02,199 --> 01:17:13,140
not sure, but yeah.

1178
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:15,140
Look at all those people in that.

1179
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:21,829
Oh, I could play a sniper rifle.

1180
01:17:21,829 --> 01:17:22,750
Yeah, but see, when you go down,

1181
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:24,350
look at the left and right of my screen.

1182
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:26,010
See how I have that like power meter,

1183
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:28,470
that's how fast I'm going when I ski.

1184
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:30,869
The entire time you're gonna be holding down space,

1185
01:17:30,869 --> 01:17:31,829
essentially, in this game.

1186
01:17:31,829 --> 01:17:33,350
There's the flag.

1187
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:34,189
All right.

1188
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:37,829
Time to pull off something.

1189
01:17:37,829 --> 01:17:45,960
Oh, get him with an air shot, come on now.

1190
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:50,539
I didn't get that guy.

1191
01:17:50,539 --> 01:17:53,539
Oh, killed people, go with people going for the flag.

1192
01:17:53,539 --> 01:17:56,470
You gotta get rid of these people, there we go.

1193
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:58,029
All right, pick up the flag, pick up the flag.

1194
01:17:58,029 --> 01:18:00,369
I got it, I got it.

1195
01:18:00,369 --> 01:18:02,819
Oh, protect me.

1196
01:18:02,819 --> 01:18:04,920
Oh, Italics is in this game.

1197
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,239
Drag him in the call.

1198
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:07,079
Requisite?

1199
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:09,949
Yeah.

1200
01:18:09,949 --> 01:18:10,789
Idiot drama.

1201
01:18:10,789 --> 01:18:11,630
Drag Italics in here.

1202
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:12,470
Oh!

1203
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:14,630
That was you?

1204
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:15,710
I'm not impressed with him.

1205
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:18,439
Oh, well, why aren't you not impressed with him?

1206
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:22,939
Italics just blew me to hell, and I blew him to hell.

1207
01:18:23,939 --> 01:18:29,239
There we go.

1208
01:18:29,239 --> 01:18:32,619
Look at all these people right here.

1209
01:18:32,619 --> 01:18:34,260
Grenade, grenade.

1210
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:40,899
Grenades are whack in this game.

1211
01:18:40,899 --> 01:18:41,739
Oh, there's a flag.

1212
01:18:41,739 --> 01:18:42,699
Give me the flag, where am I?

1213
01:18:42,699 --> 01:18:45,220
No, that was a snipe flag right there.

1214
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,649
I just totally sniped that flag.

1215
01:18:47,649 --> 01:18:49,380
Oh, I'm losing momentum.

1216
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:55,699
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.

1217
01:18:55,699 --> 01:18:59,819
I tried to Sentinel before, but I'm not very good at it.

1218
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:06,539
God, I'm being chased by like a mob of people.

1219
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:11,289
Well, press Z and all the people will start following you.

1220
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:12,989
What?

1221
01:19:12,989 --> 01:19:13,829
I promise.

1222
01:19:13,829 --> 01:19:14,949
Yeah, because I'm gonna drop the flag.

1223
01:19:14,949 --> 01:19:19,479
Still got it.

1224
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,760
Oh, maybe not anymore.

1225
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:22,800
Protect me, stealth.

1226
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:26,399
Oh, they got me.

1227
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,279
Let me drag its Alex under here.

1228
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:39,359
All right, he's coming.

1229
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:40,439
There it is.

1230
01:19:40,439 --> 01:19:41,279
One more of those.

1231
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:42,359
Yeah, baby.

1232
01:19:42,359 --> 01:19:43,199
You can get that flag.

1233
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:44,789
One more of those.

1234
01:19:44,789 --> 01:19:47,930
Oh, one more of those, baby.

1235
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:50,180
Hey, guys, what is going on?

1236
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:51,189
What's up, man?

1237
01:19:51,189 --> 01:19:52,029
What's up, Alex?

1238
01:19:52,029 --> 01:19:53,670
Playing the flag, man, like I do.

1239
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,760
Yeah, we got some good flag control.

1240
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,640
Too bad, like, Burger Boy's terrible at this game.

1241
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,960
He could really do something right now.

1242
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:07,920
Can't even figure out how to switch teams.

1243
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,960
It hit a scheme.

1244
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,279
It did, and then what?

1245
01:20:12,279 --> 01:20:15,159
And then go to change...

1246
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:16,000
And then you press,

1247
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,430
I don't wanna be on this team anymore.

1248
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:21,390
Oh, I think the MLC stealth just lied to you.

1249
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:23,029
Yeah.

1250
01:20:23,029 --> 01:20:24,229
No, that's absolutely true.

1251
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:25,270
I just did it.

1252
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:27,130
Oh, wait, you pressed P.

1253
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:27,970
Awesome.

1254
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:28,810
That's what I meant to say.

1255
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:31,090
Okay, good.

1256
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:35,760
Oh, I can't, there's not enough people on that team.

1257
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,920
Oh, this guy is so toast right now.

1258
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:38,840
Oh, here we go.

1259
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,760
Well, I can't switch.

1260
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:48,119
Come on, get him with those shots.

1261
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:53,140
Oh, fine, whatever, I'll go with this thing.

1262
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:56,260
There's just a swarm of red upside down triangles

1263
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:57,579
around that flag.

1264
01:20:57,579 --> 01:20:58,979
Oh, stealth, you got the flag, all right.

1265
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,140
I sure do.

1266
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:06,880
All right, let's do a little bit of teamwork here.

1267
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,600
I'm a pro skier, watch how I go.

1268
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,399
Yeah, if we're still playing already,

1269
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:13,220
definitely, I'll get you in here.

1270
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:14,579
Oh, there's Burger Boy.

1271
01:21:14,579 --> 01:21:17,220
Oh, Burger Boy.

1272
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,380
Where are you?

1273
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:19,859
Oh, right there, huh?

1274
01:21:19,859 --> 01:21:26,109
Oh, Burger Boy.

1275
01:21:26,109 --> 01:21:27,750
I'll switch here.

1276
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,390
I think the teams are even.

1277
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:32,699
Oh, no, no, yeah, you're, no, you didn't, not yet.

1278
01:21:32,699 --> 01:21:35,100
It depends on the auto balance moves, I guess.

1279
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:38,579
Yeah, well, this game's almost over.

1280
01:21:38,579 --> 01:21:40,220
We're almost going to lose.

1281
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:42,979
Oh, but I have a flag, that's good.

1282
01:21:42,979 --> 01:21:43,819
That means we're gonna win.

1283
01:21:43,819 --> 01:21:44,779
All right, so do not die.

1284
01:21:44,779 --> 01:21:47,619
Nobody die and we might win.

1285
01:21:47,619 --> 01:21:48,579
No, we won't.

1286
01:21:48,579 --> 01:21:53,220
That's gonna be a long range.

1287
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:56,149
I'm gonna get rid of this guy.

1288
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:58,710
Then I'll see, you were flying around the map right now.

1289
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:00,590
I've been chasing you for so long.

1290
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:02,270
I'm dead.

1291
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:03,789
Like shooting Burger Boy from behind,

1292
01:22:03,789 --> 01:22:05,510
he's just like right behind me.

1293
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:09,659
Oh, watch out, Burger Boy's gonna take us all on.

1294
01:22:09,659 --> 01:22:11,220
Somebody took him out, I don't know who.

1295
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,159
Got an assist.

1296
01:22:13,159 --> 01:22:15,600
Burger Boy.

1297
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,399
I can't even catch up with stealth.

1298
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:18,239
And I'm on his team.

1299
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,569
I know, really, right?

1300
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:23,399
Spams, rocket spams.

1301
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:24,479
Oh, we lost.

1302
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:25,840
All right, try and get on his team.

1303
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,329
I'm out looking for phone.

1304
01:22:28,329 --> 01:22:31,489
Try and get on his team, Burger Boy, the insensitive one.

1305
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:35,159
All right, let's see if any of us

1306
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:36,800
made it into the MVP statistics.

1307
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,260
No, we sure didn't.

1308
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:42,380
Yeah, you got the MLC stealth flag held top accolade.

1309
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:48,270
You got like a top medal, you didn't get a MVP.

1310
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:53,270
Actually, you got two, you got two medals.

1311
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:55,069
Flag held and flag killer.

1312
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:57,270
Top accolades.

1313
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:58,689
This thing is.

1314
01:22:58,689 --> 01:23:01,300
My most flag held medals is 41.

1315
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:02,500
And that's because I got the flag

1316
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,460
right when the game started

1317
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,619
and I skied around for 10 minutes and didn't get hit.

1318
01:23:05,619 --> 01:23:06,460
Why am I?

1319
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:07,300
I didn't kill anybody either.

1320
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:10,180
Why am I not logged into my own stream right now?

1321
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:13,390
I just typed something, how's that possible?

1322
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:18,199
So it says, oh, playing Team Fortress 2

1323
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:22,279
when I'm absolutely not.

1324
01:23:22,279 --> 01:23:24,039
People might believe you.

1325
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:28,119
What are you doing, Blood Eagle?

1326
01:23:28,119 --> 01:23:31,479
Yeah, go right when you can.

1327
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:33,880
Is that Burger Boy just like click spamming?

1328
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:37,579
Yeah, I'm trying to get in that Blood Eagle.

1329
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:39,060
Now's your best chance.

1330
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:40,779
Oh no.

1331
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:44,329
Are we gonna get split up here?

1332
01:23:44,329 --> 01:23:45,170
Click faster.

1333
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:47,529
I think we might get split up here.

1334
01:23:47,529 --> 01:23:49,529
Whatever, I'll catch you guys.

1335
01:23:49,529 --> 01:23:51,409
Oh, I just made it.

1336
01:23:51,409 --> 01:23:55,600
Oh, Burger Boy.

1337
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,760
You could have still got nine.

1338
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:57,600
Oh, he does, yeah.

1339
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,439
He just waited.

1340
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,439
You made it?

1341
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:02,569
Oh, you made it.

1342
01:24:02,569 --> 01:24:03,529
Yeah, enemy has a flag.

1343
01:24:03,529 --> 01:24:04,649
No, I gotta change this.

1344
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:09,060
It's just to say I'm playing tribes.

1345
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:14,329
Tribes descend, here we go.

1346
01:24:14,329 --> 01:24:17,930
Broadcast updated successfully.

1347
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:20,630
Uh-oh, got the flag.

1348
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:22,260
Probably not for long.

1349
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:27,109
No, I'm gonna go soldier this time.

1350
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:29,699
I think that's the best idea.

1351
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:33,020
Wow, there is no one on my team over here at all.

1352
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:35,579
Try and italics, they're all behind you though.

1353
01:24:35,579 --> 01:24:37,420
Oh man, nice air shot.

1354
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,020
Oh, Burger Boy made it on my team.

1355
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:39,899
Oh yeah.

1356
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:42,159
Oh, Burger Boy made it, that's good.

1357
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,439
All right, let's keep going.

1358
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:49,409
I got killed by an arx buster, whatever that is.

1359
01:24:49,409 --> 01:24:52,539
It's probably stupid.

1360
01:24:52,539 --> 01:24:55,159
Oh, you bastard, what are you doing?

1361
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:59,340
Oh, that was a sweep under the bridge flight right there.

1362
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:03,199
Oh, you wanna go assault rifle on assault rifle or something?

1363
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:04,829
Oh yeah.

1364
01:25:04,829 --> 01:25:09,140
Oh, this guy needs one hit and he's dead.

1365
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:11,720
Oh, come on, fine, thump up.

1366
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:16,800
There we go, there we go.

1367
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,199
All right, who's got the flag gun?

1368
01:25:18,199 --> 01:25:19,920
Uh-oh, uh-oh, they're gonna catch me now.

1369
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,520
I ran into the border of the edge of the map over here.

1370
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,500
Do we get the flogged estimator flag?

1371
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,340
Yeah, we do.

1372
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:28,579
And italics has two evil men chasing him.

1373
01:25:28,579 --> 01:25:30,260
All right, let's get over there.

1374
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:31,779
Got some ninjas flying around behind me

1375
01:25:31,779 --> 01:25:32,619
trying to kill me.

1376
01:25:32,619 --> 01:25:33,859
I feel one dude chasing it.

1377
01:25:33,859 --> 01:25:35,739
Oh, italics' voice is smooth.

1378
01:25:35,739 --> 01:25:37,310
It is.

1379
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:38,270
Somebody just said that.

1380
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:39,750
Smooth like an erection.

1381
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,579
Hey, this is a PG-13 stream.

1382
01:25:44,579 --> 01:25:47,819
I was like, I don't even know what that meant.

1383
01:25:47,819 --> 01:25:51,180
I was about to ask.

1384
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:54,579
Oh, air shot, no, that guy just got me.

1385
01:25:54,579 --> 01:25:57,300
This thing doesn't go very far, I forget that sometimes.

1386
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:59,539
I'm just kind of doing my best on the map right now.

1387
01:25:59,539 --> 01:26:01,500
I'm doing a lapse right behind you.

1388
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:02,699
John Lance, where is he?

1389
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:03,539
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

1390
01:26:03,539 --> 01:26:04,380
Trying to go faster than this.

1391
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:05,460
Oh, God.

1392
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:10,060
Not enough jet pack.

1393
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,159
I'm trying to prove I'm a better skier.

1394
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:14,560
Well, the classes have a lot of impact on that as well.

1395
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,399
We'll pass you.

1396
01:26:15,399 --> 01:26:16,439
I'm back on you.

1397
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:18,279
Yeah, if you're like the fastest class.

1398
01:26:18,279 --> 01:26:19,119
What are you?

1399
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:19,939
Oh, damn.

1400
01:26:19,939 --> 01:26:20,779
I am a raider.

1401
01:26:20,779 --> 01:26:21,619
Yeah, this is tribe system.

1402
01:26:21,619 --> 01:26:22,460
You've got somebody behind you,

1403
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:25,220
so I'll slow down a little bit until I'm done.

1404
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:27,380
That should, this game is the person that just asked.

1405
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:30,449
This game is free, and it's in open beta.

1406
01:26:30,449 --> 01:26:31,739
You can just play it.

1407
01:26:31,739 --> 01:26:36,829
You can play it as much as you want, whenever you want,

1408
01:26:36,829 --> 01:26:40,409
and it's a game about skiing, momentum, and fun.

1409
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:42,409
It's a ski simulation game.

1410
01:26:42,409 --> 01:26:43,550
Yes.

1411
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:44,829
Oh, this guy's smart.

1412
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:46,069
What do I do with a smart guy?

1413
01:26:46,069 --> 01:26:50,050
Wait till he lands.

1414
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:51,449
I can't believe I've been carrying

1415
01:26:51,449 --> 01:26:52,850
the flag this entire time.

1416
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:53,890
I really can't.

1417
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,729
We're taking care of our team here.

1418
01:26:57,729 --> 01:26:59,760
Wow, son of a.

1419
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,520
Uh-oh, are we gonna get to see

1420
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:07,340
some real raw Burger Boy rage?

1421
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:08,899
Remember, Burger Boy, you can't say any

1422
01:27:08,899 --> 01:27:11,020
like wicked, horrible swears.

1423
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:19,020
Oh, I'm about to run into a wall.

1424
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:20,060
Oh, I ran into a wall.

1425
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:20,899
It's over.

1426
01:27:21,859 --> 01:27:23,739
I see you, John.

1427
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,770
Up deck here.

1428
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:27,250
This is the zombie's deck.

1429
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:28,729
Oh, you wanna go with this?

1430
01:27:28,729 --> 01:27:29,729
Boom.

1431
01:27:29,729 --> 01:27:31,609
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

1432
01:27:31,609 --> 01:27:34,720
It was a good run.

1433
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:37,210
Very nice, very nice.

1434
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:39,060
Burger Boy's in first place.

1435
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:40,659
Burger Boy, there you go.

1436
01:27:40,659 --> 01:27:41,500
Oh, yeah.

1437
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,319
Somebody get that flag.

1438
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:48,659
All right, one of our guys got the flag.

1439
01:27:48,659 --> 01:27:50,060
Gotta get better aim.

1440
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:51,510
Come on, land.

1441
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:52,510
Oh, I got no ammo on this thing.

1442
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:56,340
What am I doing?

1443
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:02,079
I gotta get to an ammo supply.

1444
01:28:02,119 --> 01:28:04,659
Not doing so well right this second.

1445
01:28:04,659 --> 01:28:08,380
No, that's not, not doing so hot right there.

1446
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:10,229
I just granated myself.

1447
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:13,649
I'm like, as fast as you move in this game,

1448
01:28:13,649 --> 01:28:16,350
that is nearly impossible.

1449
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:17,189
Yeah, I know, right?

1450
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:19,279
That's crazy.

1451
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:20,920
I got that guy on the couple of shots.

1452
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:26,439
All right, Zephack, give me some speed.

1453
01:28:26,439 --> 01:28:28,069
I'll get this guy.

1454
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:28,909
I'll thump this guy.

1455
01:28:28,909 --> 01:28:30,590
Oh, Tumblr's better than Thumpus.

1456
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:34,029
Tumblr's better than Thumpus.

1457
01:28:34,029 --> 01:28:35,189
No, not high enough.

1458
01:28:35,189 --> 01:28:36,189
Wait, the flag has dropped.

1459
01:28:36,189 --> 01:28:37,590
I had the flag on my back.

1460
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:38,430
Get out of the tower.

1461
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:39,250
I got it, I got it.

1462
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:40,789
I blew that guy away from you guys, nice.

1463
01:28:41,029 --> 01:28:44,239
Protect the Taleks.

1464
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,640
Or I could just like sit down here alone

1465
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:50,270
by myself like an idiot.

1466
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:53,510
Awesome, what are you doing?

1467
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:56,560
Oh, I just got air shot.

1468
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,560
Damn.

1469
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:02,859
Oh, losing momentum here.

1470
01:29:02,859 --> 01:29:06,140
Just got mad air shot.

1471
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:08,479
I'm dead.

1472
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:10,869
I don't know how I dropped these.

1473
01:29:10,869 --> 01:29:12,390
I see a flag, it's mine.

1474
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:14,460
Well, we're doing.

1475
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:16,140
I believe there are some grenades

1476
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:18,859
that can make you drop stuff, like the flag.

1477
01:29:18,859 --> 01:29:20,770
Well, that's lame.

1478
01:29:20,770 --> 01:29:21,649
Actually, that's pretty cool.

1479
01:29:21,649 --> 01:29:24,060
Land on that.

1480
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:25,140
I gotta get more, I gotta.

1481
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:28,829
Oh, this guy's done.

1482
01:29:29,909 --> 01:29:32,479
Get out of town.

1483
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,520
Just got killed by a blue fatty.

1484
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:44,710
Somebody just said.

1485
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:49,489
Juggernaut, yeah, that's a juggernaut probably.

1486
01:29:49,489 --> 01:29:51,210
I might wanna pull out the.

1487
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:52,130
No, I might kill him.

1488
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:53,050
One more shot, come on.

1489
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:55,380
This is the one, this is the one right here.

1490
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:56,619
Oh, no, he's not dead.

1491
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:00,020
There we go.

1492
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:04,369
I need to go to resupply big time.

1493
01:30:04,369 --> 01:30:05,489
Oh, Shibby's got a new video.

1494
01:30:05,489 --> 01:30:06,920
Reserve shooter.

1495
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:07,760
Sick.

1496
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:12,250
It's like a challenge based on your video.

1497
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:14,170
Oh yeah, flag down baby.

1498
01:30:14,170 --> 01:30:20,399
Shibay.

1499
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:21,920
All right, we're beating them by like,

1500
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,899
we have like a 100% lead on them right now.

1501
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,800
This guy off.

1502
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:35,340
Trying to get like hit markers on him.

1503
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:41,380
But man, I tell you right now, this game is a lot of fun.

1504
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:43,020
I probably wouldn't have even started playing this game

1505
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,090
if it was not for italics.

1506
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:46,409
Thank you, sir, thank you.

1507
01:30:46,409 --> 01:30:48,369
I was like, you've got to play this game.

1508
01:30:48,369 --> 01:30:50,319
You're like, eh, whatever.

1509
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:52,079
I was like, I'll give it a try, whatever.

1510
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:54,079
It probably sucks, no.

1511
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:57,579
This game is very, very good.

1512
01:30:57,579 --> 01:30:59,060
I saw it before a long time ago,

1513
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,579
like months ago when people were first

1514
01:31:00,579 --> 01:31:02,109
starting talking about it.

1515
01:31:02,109 --> 01:31:03,750
And I was like, eh, it looks okay,

1516
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:07,380
but this game is very addicting and very fun.

1517
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:09,819
Somebody's behind me, but I don't care to turn around.

1518
01:31:09,819 --> 01:31:10,739
And it's free.

1519
01:31:10,739 --> 01:31:12,529
Yeah.

1520
01:31:12,529 --> 01:31:14,529
That's a huge plus right there.

1521
01:31:14,529 --> 01:31:17,329
I usually don't buy games that are like 10 bucks, so.

1522
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:21,420
Yeah, Burger Boy doesn't buy video games

1523
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:23,659
until they are $10.

1524
01:31:23,659 --> 01:31:25,340
And we're talking like Skyrim,

1525
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:27,180
but it's like Sky, dude, you're never gonna get that game.

1526
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:28,779
Oh, I'm not gonna get Skyrim three years from now.

1527
01:31:28,779 --> 01:31:31,319
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna get Skyrim

1528
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:33,579
when you're like 35.

1529
01:31:33,579 --> 01:31:36,210
10 bucks yet?

1530
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:38,619
Is it 10 bucks yet?

1531
01:31:38,619 --> 01:31:40,539
That's always, that's the Burger Boy quote.

1532
01:31:40,539 --> 01:31:41,659
I'll be like, oh, hey dude, you know,

1533
01:31:41,739 --> 01:31:43,560
Diablo 3 just came out.

1534
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:44,819
10 bucks yet?

1535
01:31:44,819 --> 01:31:46,659
Like, no, it's not.

1536
01:31:46,659 --> 01:31:48,380
It's like 60.

1537
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:53,060
Oh, well, I'm not blind until it's like 10 bucks.

1538
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:55,479
I'm gonna try and help you with this dude.

1539
01:31:55,479 --> 01:31:56,680
Nice. Yep.

1540
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,319
He was getting on you pretty good.

1541
01:31:58,319 --> 01:31:59,979
Yeah.

1542
01:31:59,979 --> 01:32:03,449
Agent 13, I thought.

1543
01:32:03,449 --> 01:32:04,930
Yeah, all right, let me know when...

1544
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:07,329
All right, that was a joke, nobody was saved.

1545
01:32:07,329 --> 01:32:09,529
Wait, what did you just say?

1546
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:12,220
I really just didn't even pay attention to a word you said.

1547
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:13,680
Oh, I need to get up here.

1548
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:14,520
I'm dead.

1549
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,340
I'm so dead.

1550
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:17,960
Yeah, absolutely.

1551
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,300
Oh, top-fragging like a vile.

1552
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:20,380
Got the guy for ya.

1553
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:22,140
Got the guy for ya.

1554
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:22,979
Nice.

1555
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,239
Let's see if I can get a spike area with this airstrike.

1556
01:32:27,239 --> 01:32:29,130
Let's see if he walks right into it.

1557
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:30,930
Oh, no, you almost got him.

1558
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:32,050
He was in the air.

1559
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:33,090
He was in the air.

1560
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:37,920
At least it looked close from over here.

1561
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,949
I'm trying to get him in the air.

1562
01:32:41,949 --> 01:32:44,859
Not shooting far enough ahead of him.

1563
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:48,100
Nope, still not shooting far enough ahead of him.

1564
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:49,420
Oh, that could have been an air shot.

1565
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:51,439
Come on now.

1566
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:53,229
Mother may I.

1567
01:32:58,380 --> 01:32:59,220
All right, I need to wait.

1568
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,350
I gotta recharge my stuff here.

1569
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:03,500
Oh, God.

1570
01:33:03,539 --> 01:33:07,460
Eat that, Margo.

1571
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:08,739
Eat that, Vlad.

1572
01:33:08,739 --> 01:33:10,720
Here we go.

1573
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:11,560
Victory.

1574
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,859
Victory.

1575
01:33:13,859 --> 01:33:18,279
All right, let's get Ahri in here.

1576
01:33:18,279 --> 01:33:19,399
First one of the day.

1577
01:33:19,399 --> 01:33:20,239
Oh, no.

1578
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:22,279
There he is.

1579
01:33:22,279 --> 01:33:25,039
Oh, Burger Boy with 12 kills, holy crap.

1580
01:33:25,039 --> 01:33:28,140
Did Burger Boy, nice.

1581
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:30,380
I would not buy Team Fortress Classic.

1582
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:34,539
The only reason why I say that is because it's just,

1583
01:33:34,539 --> 01:33:37,060
it's very, and now it's just so difficult to play.

1584
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:40,609
This grenade spam is, it's,

1585
01:33:40,609 --> 01:33:42,850
unless it's like $5, don't buy it.

1586
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:47,899
I'll put it that way.

1587
01:33:47,899 --> 01:33:49,630
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

1588
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:52,350
I think this is the first time I've ever gotten first place

1589
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:54,470
in anything in tribes.

1590
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:55,310
Oh, really?

1591
01:33:55,310 --> 01:33:58,260
In tribes.

1592
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:00,819
That is an achievement in and of itself for me.

1593
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:06,579
Not even first in the whole game.

1594
01:34:06,579 --> 01:34:07,659
Just first in my team.

1595
01:34:07,659 --> 01:34:08,500
That's good enough.

1596
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,180
All right, quick, blood eagle.

1597
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:11,020
Blood eagle.

1598
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:12,060
Everybody click.

1599
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:12,899
Click it.

1600
01:34:13,859 --> 01:34:15,260
Yes.

1601
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:19,829
Go back to Pathfinder.

1602
01:34:19,829 --> 01:34:22,590
Oh, there's a guy right here.

1603
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:23,939
Air shot, nope.

1604
01:34:23,939 --> 01:34:24,779
Get the first kill.

1605
01:34:24,779 --> 01:34:27,359
That gives you that flag, yeah.

1606
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:28,569
It does?

1607
01:34:28,569 --> 01:34:29,409
Yep.

1608
01:34:29,449 --> 01:34:30,890
Oh, it's like Team Defender on Call of Duty?

1609
01:34:30,890 --> 01:34:32,829
You've never played Team Defender on Call of Duty?

1610
01:34:32,829 --> 01:34:37,119
Hey, watch it.

1611
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:38,560
I can't believe that, oh, he's gonna kill me.

1612
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,680
No, Germany, you have to get the first kill,

1613
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:40,520
not first death.

1614
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:43,479
I'm gonna be the first death if I don't get Lord Chaos.

1615
01:34:43,479 --> 01:34:45,819
I'm the first damn death.

1616
01:34:45,819 --> 01:34:48,609
Wow, that was the luckiest kill I've ever had.

1617
01:34:48,609 --> 01:34:50,859
Yeah, I'll probably do videos for tribes.

1618
01:34:50,859 --> 01:34:54,789
Eventually, I gotta get familiar with it, get good at it,

1619
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:59,340
but I'll probably do a few videos, at least,

1620
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:03,119
because this game is really awesome.

1621
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:04,779
Boom.

1622
01:35:04,779 --> 01:35:05,899
The otter, boom, the otter.

1623
01:35:05,899 --> 01:35:06,739
Where am I?

1624
01:35:06,739 --> 01:35:10,659
I'm going the absolute wrong direction.

1625
01:35:10,659 --> 01:35:13,210
Gonna get some speed here.

1626
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:16,180
Pickin' up speed, pickin' up speed.

1627
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:18,789
Got him, and then someone got me.

1628
01:35:18,789 --> 01:35:20,430
Oh, we gotta get that flag.

1629
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:22,789
You got it, somebody on our team got it.

1630
01:35:22,789 --> 01:35:24,390
MLC stealth is gonna die.

1631
01:35:29,409 --> 01:35:33,060
Look at that chaos, grenade into the chaos.

1632
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,819
Oh, I thought I got that guy.

1633
01:35:34,819 --> 01:35:38,460
We're good, bye.

1634
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:40,100
My game is just updating,

1635
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:43,789
it's doing some really weird stuff right now.

1636
01:35:43,789 --> 01:35:45,869
Hey, when we installed it on Burger Boy's computer,

1637
01:35:45,869 --> 01:35:48,029
it was like all his fans turned on.

1638
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:51,029
His computer almost like broke.

1639
01:35:51,109 --> 01:35:53,310
Explode, just randomly, I would be surprised.

1640
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,840
That is like awesome computer I have.

1641
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:57,680
Nice shot.

1642
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,600
That guy got a really good shot.

1643
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,880
We've had issues with Borderlands, Burger Boy.

1644
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,220
We've had issues.

1645
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:07,770
Burger Boy, Borderlands.

1646
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:09,810
So Ari, how many times have you heard Burger Boy

1647
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:12,609
swear and say horrible things in Borderlands?

1648
01:36:12,609 --> 01:36:14,449
Oh, oh God.

1649
01:36:14,449 --> 01:36:17,890
Basically, he did remap his keys for his special ability,

1650
01:36:17,890 --> 01:36:19,569
and every time he wanted to pick up an item,

1651
01:36:19,569 --> 01:36:21,770
he decided to activate his special ability.

1652
01:36:23,569 --> 01:36:24,689
And playing his break,

1653
01:36:24,689 --> 01:36:26,449
he was just screaming constantly

1654
01:36:26,449 --> 01:36:29,210
for the entire three hours that we played at a time.

1655
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:32,539
Worst tank ever.

1656
01:36:32,539 --> 01:36:34,619
Oh, Burger Boy, come on.

1657
01:36:34,619 --> 01:36:40,850
You can like do better than that.

1658
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:41,689
Oh, let's go, Shottie.

1659
01:36:41,689 --> 01:36:44,439
I don't have any momentum.

1660
01:36:44,439 --> 01:36:49,289
I'm like walking around the map.

1661
01:36:49,289 --> 01:36:50,130
Oh, I still have.

1662
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:52,699
Hey, you.

1663
01:36:52,699 --> 01:36:55,060
I'm gonna waste this grenade.

1664
01:36:55,060 --> 01:37:00,189
Let's get this guy, double team.

1665
01:37:00,189 --> 01:37:04,310
Oh, I missed, there we go.

1666
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:08,760
Another guy right there.

1667
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:14,739
Two guys, 770, that's a direct shot.

1668
01:37:14,779 --> 01:37:16,539
Oh, that guy fell in the lava.

1669
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,939
Oh, this guy, oh, he knew it.

1670
01:37:18,939 --> 01:37:22,130
Wow, that was awesome.

1671
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:23,529
Come here, flag boy.

1672
01:37:23,529 --> 01:37:25,689
Holy crap, that was awesome.

1673
01:37:25,689 --> 01:37:26,770
Yes.

1674
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:28,369
I just tried to get a resupply,

1675
01:37:28,369 --> 01:37:30,489
and a guy threw a grenade right into my feet

1676
01:37:30,489 --> 01:37:33,520
when I went over there and got me.

1677
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:47,220
Touche, my friend, that was great, woo.

1678
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:49,970
So Jerma, what classes do you have unlocked so far?

1679
01:37:49,970 --> 01:37:52,710
Just the sniper sentinel.

1680
01:37:52,710 --> 01:37:53,550
That's it.

1681
01:37:53,550 --> 01:37:54,909
The nice thing about, like yesterday,

1682
01:37:54,909 --> 01:37:56,989
we were talking about the ones

1683
01:37:56,989 --> 01:37:58,789
that don't detonate on impact.

1684
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:00,829
They bounce around.

1685
01:38:00,829 --> 01:38:02,229
I have the grenade launcher right now,

1686
01:38:02,229 --> 01:38:03,670
and I've noticed that if you get a direct hit,

1687
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:04,710
it's like the demo man, you know,

1688
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:06,430
it'll just explode, it'll just pop.

1689
01:38:06,430 --> 01:38:07,270
Oh, really?

1690
01:38:07,270 --> 01:38:08,930
Immediately.

1691
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:09,770
Wow.

1692
01:38:09,770 --> 01:38:11,609
And the nice thing about them also

1693
01:38:11,609 --> 01:38:13,529
is that they usually do a lot more damage

1694
01:38:13,529 --> 01:38:17,310
and have a bigger radius than like the spin fuses.

1695
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:19,710
Yeah, I've noticed the explosion's huge.

1696
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:23,619
You just get a massive damage spike right there.

1697
01:38:23,619 --> 01:38:25,100
Going in the lava, I keep falling in the lava

1698
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:28,859
like an idiot.

1699
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:31,220
Hey, stop it.

1700
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:33,710
I can't help it.

1701
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:36,930
Does anybody else feel like they're playing Star Wars?

1702
01:38:37,010 --> 01:38:38,970
Or we are on like that map.

1703
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:39,810
Yeah.

1704
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:40,649
What's that map called?

1705
01:38:40,649 --> 01:38:41,489
I don't know.

1706
01:38:41,489 --> 01:38:43,680
I mean, even the noise is like the,

1707
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:44,520
I feel like the,

1708
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:49,140
it sounds like Star Wars.

1709
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:50,699
Oh, dang it.

1710
01:38:50,699 --> 01:38:52,500
So what are you guys' favorite classes

1711
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,340
with the game so far?

1712
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:54,180
Pathfinder.

1713
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:56,170
I like moving fast and having zero health.

1714
01:38:56,170 --> 01:38:57,529
Pathfinder.

1715
01:38:57,529 --> 01:39:01,859
Yeah, I'd probably say the Pathfinder too.

1716
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:03,699
Just get the shock on a solid key.

1717
01:39:03,699 --> 01:39:05,579
Break the trend, break the trend.

1718
01:39:05,579 --> 01:39:08,539
I would say Raider or Infiltrator.

1719
01:39:08,539 --> 01:39:12,079
See, I don't even, I gotta get those guys.

1720
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:13,479
I'm not very good with the Infiltrator yet.

1721
01:39:13,479 --> 01:39:18,659
Never been good with stealthy classes in any game.

1722
01:39:18,659 --> 01:39:20,460
But it's still fun.

1723
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:22,680
Yeah, so you can cloak?

1724
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:24,640
Oh yeah, you can cloak.

1725
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:25,479
That's crazy.

1726
01:39:25,479 --> 01:39:27,600
And instead of using your energy for your jet pack,

1727
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,000
it'll use it for your stealth.

1728
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,039
Oh, okay, that's a good trade-off.

1729
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:32,279
That's not like overpowered or anything.

1730
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:33,619
That's cool.

1731
01:39:33,619 --> 01:39:35,539
And there's a few items and like perks.

1732
01:39:35,539 --> 01:39:36,380
Maybe not perks,

1733
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:38,180
but I know there's at least one or two items

1734
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:42,229
that can like detect stealth people.

1735
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:43,069
Oh, really?

1736
01:39:43,069 --> 01:39:44,640
I don't have any of those yet.

1737
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:45,680
There's a lot of people here.

1738
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:46,520
I'm so dead.

1739
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:53,619
Yeah, there's like 10 people around me.

1740
01:39:53,619 --> 01:39:55,380
Skate down here.

1741
01:39:55,380 --> 01:40:00,289
Oh, Tony Hawk presents Tribes Ascent.

1742
01:40:00,289 --> 01:40:03,319
Do a kickflip.

1743
01:40:03,319 --> 01:40:04,600
All right, I'm gonna do like a shaky 200,

1744
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:08,180
oh, that's like 25 points.

1745
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:10,489
All right, I gotta get some speed.

1746
01:40:10,489 --> 01:40:13,880
Yeah, I cannot catch up to the flag carrier.

1747
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,600
Oh, shut down his screen.

1748
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,590
I'll try and cut him off.

1749
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:19,819
Hey, Burger Boy, your phone.

1750
01:40:19,819 --> 01:40:21,689
How did you know it was him?

1751
01:40:21,689 --> 01:40:24,979
How did you know he was right there?

1752
01:40:24,979 --> 01:40:28,279
Hey, call you right back, I'm gonna make a stream.

1753
01:40:28,279 --> 01:40:29,520
I know Jerma's ringtone,

1754
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,600
and I'm pretty sure Burger Boy's the only one

1755
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:34,800
who is gonna have his phone on him right now.

1756
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,710
What if Vitalik's has his phone on him?

1757
01:40:36,710 --> 01:40:38,199
I don't think he would.

1758
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,159
I thought that was more of a Burger Boy thing,

1759
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,199
to have his phone on him.

1760
01:40:42,199 --> 01:40:43,800
What that means about you, I don't know.

1761
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,079
Give me that, give me that.

1762
01:40:45,079 --> 01:40:48,189
Oh yeah, I got the flag.

1763
01:40:48,189 --> 01:40:49,640
Hey, we're losing.

1764
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,899
Yeah, I got the flag, just protect me.

1765
01:40:51,899 --> 01:40:53,500
All right, I'll lay you off.

1766
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,060
I'll do what I want, what I want.

1767
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:56,340
Oh, I'm gonna lose speed right now.

1768
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:58,140
I'm gonna be sitting ducking two seconds.

1769
01:40:58,140 --> 01:40:59,819
I'm gonna be your body shield.

1770
01:41:02,149 --> 01:41:05,470
Oh my God, there's a whole crew just following you.

1771
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:07,079
Did I kill that guy?

1772
01:41:07,079 --> 01:41:10,909
Ah, finally, jeez.

1773
01:41:10,909 --> 01:41:12,029
Oh my God.

1774
01:41:12,029 --> 01:41:13,590
Oh yeah, I got one of them for you.

1775
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:19,100
Oh, I'm dead, I gotta kill though.

1776
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:23,060
I got another kill?

1777
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:24,739
I think another planet died.

1778
01:41:24,739 --> 01:41:25,979
Oh, I'm gonna land right on top

1779
01:41:25,979 --> 01:41:28,399
of everybody that's right there.

1780
01:41:28,399 --> 01:41:30,609
Oh no, give me that flag.

1781
01:41:30,609 --> 01:41:33,229
Oh, I ran right by it.

1782
01:41:33,229 --> 01:41:36,029
Oh no, oh, that bastard got it.

1783
01:41:36,029 --> 01:41:41,319
No, no, give the shotgun up.

1784
01:41:41,319 --> 01:41:44,310
Oh, damn.

1785
01:41:44,310 --> 01:41:46,310
Shotgun, best weapon in this game.

1786
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:47,630
Yeah, I didn't pull it out early enough.

1787
01:41:47,630 --> 01:41:50,020
I should have pulled it out way earlier.

1788
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:51,460
Oh, Vitalik's don't die.

1789
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:53,220
I got him, I got him, man.

1790
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:54,439
Almost died.

1791
01:41:54,439 --> 01:41:57,899
I have 13 health.

1792
01:41:57,899 --> 01:42:00,260
My streak.

1793
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:07,180
I don't see you destroying 16 kills, man.

1794
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:08,739
I think I just blew that guy's grenade up

1795
01:42:08,739 --> 01:42:10,579
in midair in front of him.

1796
01:42:10,579 --> 01:42:13,420
I think that's actually what just happened.

1797
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:14,539
Where is the flag?

1798
01:42:14,539 --> 01:42:16,149
I don't know, we don't have it though.

1799
01:42:16,149 --> 01:42:18,590
It's a pretty much, it's a pretty close game right now.

1800
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:19,989
We can't lose this.

1801
01:42:19,989 --> 01:42:21,069
Melee kill.

1802
01:42:21,069 --> 01:42:24,109
Oh, I just totally stole that from you, Burger Boy.

1803
01:42:24,109 --> 01:42:29,100
Melee is so tough, but so satisfying when you get it.

1804
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:33,060
I only do it like on AFK people, or like snipers.

1805
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:33,899
Someone just asked.

1806
01:42:33,899 --> 01:42:34,739
Especially when you're an infiltrator.

1807
01:42:34,739 --> 01:42:37,819
Someone asked me, are there hats in this game?

1808
01:42:38,859 --> 01:42:40,020
I don't think so.

1809
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:42,180
I wouldn't, don't put it past him, man.

1810
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:47,189
This game could have a lot of items in the coming future.

1811
01:42:47,189 --> 01:42:48,909
He's got it with a freaking crossbow.

1812
01:42:48,909 --> 01:42:50,189
I got the flag guy.

1813
01:42:50,189 --> 01:42:52,229
All right, you got the flag?

1814
01:42:52,229 --> 01:42:53,310
We're gonna lose.

1815
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:56,619
We're absolutely gonna lose.

1816
01:42:56,619 --> 01:42:58,380
Try and cut this flag guy off.

1817
01:42:58,380 --> 01:42:59,619
Yeah, we're gonna lose.

1818
01:42:59,619 --> 01:43:00,460
Oh, cut him off.

1819
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:01,300
It's a done deal.

1820
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:02,899
Cut him off.

1821
01:43:02,899 --> 01:43:05,260
It's not over yet, guys.

1822
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:07,659
That guy's out of speed, that guy's out of speed.

1823
01:43:07,659 --> 01:43:09,899
Seven to 24, I think it's over.

1824
01:43:09,899 --> 01:43:10,739
Five.

1825
01:43:11,899 --> 01:43:13,369
Oh yeah.

1826
01:43:14,010 --> 01:43:15,489
Oh yeah, it's absolutely over.

1827
01:43:15,489 --> 01:43:17,130
Somebody call in the nuke.

1828
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:19,210
Oh.

1829
01:43:19,210 --> 01:43:20,930
Wait, no, I had 10,000 credits,

1830
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:22,810
but I called in an inventory station instead.

1831
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:25,369
MLC has killed me 15 times in a row,

1832
01:43:25,369 --> 01:43:27,619
that's how many he's said.

1833
01:43:27,619 --> 01:43:30,590
Well, I feel like a retard.

1834
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:31,789
I was supposed to call in an orbital strike,

1835
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:32,989
but I called in the inventory station.

1836
01:43:32,989 --> 01:43:34,659
Sorry, does nobody die?

1837
01:43:34,659 --> 01:43:35,899
Give me that flag.

1838
01:43:41,869 --> 01:43:46,100
Oh, all right, I think probably one more round, maybe.

1839
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:48,859
You guys wanna play CTF, or just keep doing this?

1840
01:43:50,729 --> 01:43:52,970
I don't know, CTF can be very, very long,

1841
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:56,579
so I'm just supposed to do one more of this.

1842
01:43:56,579 --> 01:44:00,020
Are you in here yet, or are you game-loaded?

1843
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:02,220
45 seconds, apparently.

1844
01:44:03,579 --> 01:44:05,140
He says 20 minutes ago.

1845
01:44:07,579 --> 01:44:08,619
Well, no worries, I mean.

1846
01:44:08,619 --> 01:44:11,539
I got this game when Beta first was announced for this.

1847
01:44:11,539 --> 01:44:13,180
I signed up for this, like this,

1848
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:16,100
and Firefall I signed up for like years ago.

1849
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:16,939
Yeah.

1850
01:44:16,939 --> 01:44:19,859
And Firefall is incredible.

1851
01:44:19,859 --> 01:44:21,300
I got the Beta for that as well.

1852
01:44:21,859 --> 01:44:22,939
I'm so jealous.

1853
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:25,979
It's only two times a week, though.

1854
01:44:25,979 --> 01:44:27,779
You can only delve on in those two periods,

1855
01:44:27,779 --> 01:44:31,340
one for Europe and one for US, but it is insane.

1856
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:33,380
It's looking like an incredible game

1857
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:34,539
if you get a chance to get it.

1858
01:44:34,539 --> 01:44:37,409
What is Firefall, what is it?

1859
01:44:37,409 --> 01:44:39,850
It's another free-to-play game coming out,

1860
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:42,170
and it was like the highlight,

1861
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:44,649
one of the highlights of E3 the past year.

1862
01:44:44,649 --> 01:44:47,520
It's, how can you describe it?

1863
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,420
How can you describe it, Alex?

1864
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:50,680
What is it called?

1865
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:51,520
Firefall.

1866
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,439
Well, I thought someone said 5-4.

1867
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:56,760
That's what I did just say.

1868
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:57,600
Oh, okay.

1869
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,800
Oh, when are you gonna get it?

1870
01:44:58,800 --> 01:44:59,640
5-4-3-2-1.

1871
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,039
He's saying Fire as in it burns you,

1872
01:45:01,039 --> 01:45:04,399
and then Fall as in falling.

1873
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:05,560
Sorry, the English accent,

1874
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:07,560
but he's gonna come across great.

1875
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,770
Well, no, I'm just an idiot, so.

1876
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:11,449
Firefall is like, okay, imagine.

1877
01:45:11,449 --> 01:45:12,649
Oh, oh, Firefall.

1878
01:45:12,649 --> 01:45:15,810
We played that at Tax East last year.

1879
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:18,210
Yeah, that's the one, yeah.

1880
01:45:18,210 --> 01:45:19,729
5-4-3-2-1.

1881
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:24,909
It looks like Borderlands with an MMO,

1882
01:45:24,909 --> 01:45:29,069
and then open world, and then awesome art style.

1883
01:45:29,069 --> 01:45:31,829
It is, the art style is absolutely beautiful.

1884
01:45:31,829 --> 01:45:34,670
It's one of the most stunning games I've seen in beta.

1885
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:37,289
Like, it looks good as it is.

1886
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:40,000
Yeah, right, now that's cool.

1887
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,479
Oh, this guy's gonna land on that.

1888
01:45:41,479 --> 01:45:43,329
No, he's not.

1889
01:45:43,329 --> 01:45:49,930
Oh, I'm getting blasted, come on.

1890
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:52,060
Oh, yeah.

1891
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:52,899
Oh, I'm actually a shooter.

1892
01:45:52,899 --> 01:45:54,739
Anybody else over here with me and the flag guy?

1893
01:45:54,739 --> 01:45:57,840
I'm going after this dude down here.

1894
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,479
Flag, come on, do you need help?

1895
01:46:00,279 --> 01:46:04,260
I'm playing Juggernaut, I'm not good with Juggernaut.

1896
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:12,590
I'm okay, I gotta get better with him.

1897
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:15,420
Oh, come on, walk into that.

1898
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:16,979
This guy is standing still.

1899
01:46:16,979 --> 01:46:21,819
Oh, I just got that guy mid-air with a grenade in his back.

1900
01:46:21,819 --> 01:46:23,140
Did anyone else do that?

1901
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:25,579
Yeah, I did, I was watching him come out.

1902
01:46:25,579 --> 01:46:27,779
I was like 15 feet above the guy.

1903
01:46:27,779 --> 01:46:29,539
I just like looked in front of him

1904
01:46:29,539 --> 01:46:33,260
and just like popped the grenade right on his back,

1905
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:34,800
and he dropped the flag.

1906
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,609
That was amazing.

1907
01:46:37,609 --> 01:46:38,890
You gotta chase him right behind you, Tellix.

1908
01:46:38,890 --> 01:46:39,970
Oh, he's dead now.

1909
01:46:39,970 --> 01:46:42,819
Somebody behind me now, I think.

1910
01:46:43,659 --> 01:46:45,060
Is AFK guy?

1911
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:45,899
Get him?

1912
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:47,560
Oh, he's not AFK anymore, is he?

1913
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:48,399
Oh, no, he's AFK.

1914
01:46:48,399 --> 01:46:49,239
Haley.

1915
01:46:51,229 --> 01:46:55,460
Oh boy, come on, land, land.

1916
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:57,670
Oh, nice shot, dude.

1917
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:03,060
It's like a ballet of death right there, Juggernaut.

1918
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:04,850
Juggernaut, I'm being chased.

1919
01:47:04,850 --> 01:47:06,729
I'm dead, nothing I can do about it.

1920
01:47:06,729 --> 01:47:08,090
You're right next to me.

1921
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:09,300
What?

1922
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:11,140
Oh, well, where is he?

1923
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:11,979
Oh, okay.

1924
01:47:11,979 --> 01:47:12,819
I need to add you guys to my friends list

1925
01:47:12,819 --> 01:47:13,659
so I can see you.

1926
01:47:13,659 --> 01:47:14,500
So we can see like names, I know.

1927
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:17,180
Yeah.

1928
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:20,380
I'm trying to get him to walk into this grenade.

1929
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:23,079
Oh, he's going too fast.

1930
01:47:23,159 --> 01:47:24,000
Where'd he go?

1931
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,460
I just launched him somewhere.

1932
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:27,180
Great, where the hell is he?

1933
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:28,020
Oh, of course.

1934
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:28,859
He's right next to me.

1935
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:30,949
You got like two people behind you, Juggernaut.

1936
01:47:30,949 --> 01:47:34,350
Yeah, I'm trying to go for the suppressing.

1937
01:47:34,350 --> 01:47:35,310
Oh, I'm stuck.

1938
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:36,149
I'm stuck, I'm gonna die.

1939
01:47:36,149 --> 01:47:36,989
I'm so dead.

1940
01:47:36,989 --> 01:47:39,289
I'm like on the ground.

1941
01:47:39,289 --> 01:47:42,220
Nope, nope, you've still got it, you've still got it.

1942
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:43,619
Oh, my God.

1943
01:47:43,619 --> 01:47:47,170
Oh, you just saved my life right there.

1944
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:48,689
What's my graphics card?

1945
01:47:48,689 --> 01:47:54,680
I use a GTX 470 in video.

1946
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:55,520
It's good.

1947
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,359
I wouldn't really recommend,

1948
01:47:56,359 --> 01:47:57,520
if you're gonna get a new graphics card,

1949
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:59,340
don't get the 400 series.

1950
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:02,449
There's the 400 series, at least the 470 and the 480.

1951
01:48:02,449 --> 01:48:05,779
They heat up way too much.

1952
01:48:05,779 --> 01:48:07,140
They are not recommended.

1953
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:09,520
They're very, they're good cards,

1954
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:13,899
but they can get to be like 80, 90 degrees Celsius,

1955
01:48:13,899 --> 01:48:16,939
and it's not really that good for your computer.

1956
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:24,819
York, I did play Global Agenda.

1957
01:48:24,819 --> 01:48:28,340
I have something like 700 hours,

1958
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:30,020
I think, clocked in on that game.

1959
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:31,579
On Global Agenda?

1960
01:48:31,579 --> 01:48:32,579
Yeah, oh God.

1961
01:48:32,579 --> 01:48:35,460
I used to play, both me and Zeus used to play

1962
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:38,140
like seriously, like two years ago.

1963
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:39,739
Global Agenda is a different path.

1964
01:48:39,739 --> 01:48:41,420
I thought you meant Global Offensive.

1965
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:43,300
No, no, Global Agenda.

1966
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:44,659
That was before it was free.

1967
01:48:44,659 --> 01:48:46,819
Like we bought it and we played it,

1968
01:48:46,819 --> 01:48:50,260
and oh God, like we put in hours into that game,

1969
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:52,979
and then it all kind of went downhill after a while

1970
01:48:52,979 --> 01:48:53,819
when they went free,

1971
01:48:53,819 --> 01:48:55,939
and they built Tribes Ascent instead.

1972
01:48:55,939 --> 01:48:58,100
They took all their money out of Global Agenda

1973
01:48:58,100 --> 01:48:59,779
and put it into Tribes instead.

1974
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:03,840
That's pretty, and that's cool.

1975
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:04,680
What was Global Agenda?

1976
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:06,439
Was it like a similar game?

1977
01:49:07,829 --> 01:49:09,510
Yeah, it was third person,

1978
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:11,109
then you could also get into first person

1979
01:49:11,109 --> 01:49:13,390
when you aimed down sight and things like that.

1980
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:14,989
It was a really good concept,

1981
01:49:14,989 --> 01:49:18,069
just it needed to be made by a bigger company,

1982
01:49:18,069 --> 01:49:19,149
if that makes sense.

1983
01:49:19,149 --> 01:49:21,640
Yeah, it does.

1984
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:22,800
Like APB, I guess.

1985
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:23,640
APB could have been.

1986
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,609
Auto Balance, don't die.

1987
01:49:25,609 --> 01:49:27,170
Or I don't know how to treat it.

1988
01:49:27,170 --> 01:49:31,439
APB went into the crapper, didn't it?

1989
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:33,399
Cause like they ran out of money or something?

1990
01:49:33,399 --> 01:49:35,640
Oh yeah, they were in so much debt in the end.

1991
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:38,319
EA was just like, oh, free game, we'll buy you.

1992
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
They just made it free for everybody.

1993
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,760
It just went downhill from then on in.

1994
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:45,460
Yeah, there is no health kit, by the way.

1995
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:51,770
There is no health kits in this game.

1996
01:49:51,770 --> 01:49:58,250
Oh, shit, so.

1997
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:00,449
I think we're gonna win, absolutely, by the way.

1998
01:50:00,449 --> 01:50:01,850
I've had the flag the entire game.

1999
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:11,939
That guy's just been stumbling me with this fucking air shot.

2000
01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:12,779
That's a sniper coming at me.

2001
01:50:12,779 --> 01:50:16,590
Oh, that was beautiful.

2002
01:50:16,590 --> 01:50:19,579
Air walking shot, gorgeous.

2003
01:50:19,579 --> 01:50:23,819
Gorgeous, yeah, this guy's, let's get him.

2004
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:24,659
There we go.

2005
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:27,260
Nice, yeah buddy.

2006
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:28,630
Oh, I got it.

2007
01:50:28,630 --> 01:50:30,420
If I don't need it, I just.

2008
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:33,149
Oh, that was an air shot.

2009
01:50:33,149 --> 01:50:34,470
That was a pretty close air shot, though.

2010
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:39,579
I don't know if I would really count that.

2011
01:50:39,579 --> 01:50:42,100
I have to get some more ammo and come back to fight.

2012
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:44,689
Oh, I'll blow up.

2013
01:50:44,689 --> 01:50:46,579
I got a four core quad core.

2014
01:50:46,579 --> 01:50:54,109
Four cores.

2015
01:50:57,420 --> 01:51:04,510
Oh, that was interesting, I guess, what I just did.

2016
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:06,329
The spin fuser.

2017
01:51:06,329 --> 01:51:08,930
Are you still carrying the flag, MLC?

2018
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:10,210
Yeah, this guy just walked right,

2019
01:51:10,210 --> 01:51:11,609
he just like flew right by you.

2020
01:51:11,609 --> 01:51:12,449
He's like, eh, whatever.

2021
01:51:12,449 --> 01:51:14,369
I'm gonna, I'm gonna chase you.

2022
01:51:14,369 --> 01:51:17,300
Actually, I'm gonna come back to you.

2023
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:18,140
Are you all right?

2024
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:20,020
Are you dead or what are you doing still?

2025
01:51:20,859 --> 01:51:21,699
Just floating around the map.

2026
01:51:21,699 --> 01:51:24,300
Yeah, I've, probably my fourth map around the map.

2027
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:28,819
Oh, you gotta do, oh, you got people on you now.

2028
01:51:28,819 --> 01:51:32,010
Oh, did they finally figure out how this game was played?

2029
01:51:32,010 --> 01:51:36,680
If I could not be such a slog, I would come over there.

2030
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:38,399
Sorry, they're not gonna be able to catch me.

2031
01:51:38,399 --> 01:51:42,840
Juggernaut, why do you forsake me?

2032
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:43,680
Oh, you're a juggernaut?

2033
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:47,449
No wonder you can't keep up.

2034
01:51:47,449 --> 01:51:54,539
I'm pretty much like in molasses right now.

2035
01:51:54,539 --> 01:51:57,869
No, he's dead.

2036
01:51:57,869 --> 01:51:59,720
Oh, they're trying to snipe me.

2037
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:03,109
Yeah, they got a couple of snipers, actually, to be honest.

2038
01:52:03,149 --> 01:52:05,770
All right, let's get some effing speed here.

2039
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:11,659
Whoa, we're alive.

2040
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:15,380
Oh, look at that slug.

2041
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:18,050
Ah, I missed him.

2042
01:52:18,050 --> 01:52:20,180
I can't even go chase him either.

2043
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:23,630
I'm like the heavy weapons guy.

2044
01:52:23,630 --> 01:52:25,579
No, that's your character in Sword War.

2045
01:52:25,579 --> 01:52:26,579
No, that's right.

2046
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:29,300
Oh, I finally died.

2047
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:30,939
Oh, am I actually gonna move more

2048
01:52:30,939 --> 01:52:34,140
than like two miles per hour now?

2049
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:35,779
Oh, somebody else picked up the flag.

2050
01:52:35,779 --> 01:52:37,699
Oh, great, I'm going in the opposite direction

2051
01:52:37,699 --> 01:52:40,579
that everybody is.

2052
01:52:40,579 --> 01:52:42,340
All right, that's enough.

2053
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:44,579
I'm changing the pathfinder.

2054
01:52:45,539 --> 01:52:48,590
Time to commit suicide.

2055
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:51,840
That didn't even kill me.

2056
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:52,680
Oh, what's that?

2057
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:55,340
It's a big bouncing blue-green ball.

2058
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:59,119
Oh, Burger Boy, is that you in the flying?

2059
01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:00,989
No, that's the quay.

2060
01:53:00,989 --> 01:53:02,350
Oh, so beautiful.

2061
01:53:02,350 --> 01:53:04,260
I'm going this way.

2062
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:06,899
MLG Grandpa is on an off season right now.

2063
01:53:06,899 --> 01:53:12,850
He'll be back in probably a couple weeks, I'm assuming.

2064
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:20,380
I'm gonna go help protect the flag carrier.

2065
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:21,220
Woo-hoo!

2066
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:26,750
Hey, if you hit one of those water guys

2067
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:27,590
who's when they're going off,

2068
01:53:27,590 --> 01:53:30,140
it'll actually give you like a ton of air.

2069
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:31,140
Really?

2070
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:31,979
Yeah, I just got going.

2071
01:53:31,979 --> 01:53:32,800
I don't know if you see them,

2072
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,319
they're going off on the mountains.

2073
01:53:35,319 --> 01:53:36,520
The best two maps are this one

2074
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,760
and the one we're gonna play next.

2075
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:39,800
And the worst one's that lava one

2076
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:41,590
that we just got done playing.

2077
01:53:41,590 --> 01:53:45,649
That's my opinion.

2078
01:53:45,649 --> 01:53:51,829
I like the castle on the best.

2079
01:53:51,829 --> 01:53:57,819
What did you, what just hit me?

2080
01:53:57,819 --> 01:54:08,960
That guy just got a, ugh, that's on top.

2081
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:22,279
Yeah, sweet, sweet grenade bliss.

2082
01:54:22,279 --> 01:54:24,119
Germo, you have 10,000 credits.

2083
01:54:24,119 --> 01:54:27,279
Use your super duper.

2084
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:28,119
Okay.

2085
01:54:28,119 --> 01:54:31,079
How do you use that thing?

2086
01:54:31,079 --> 01:54:32,239
Three, four, five.

2087
01:54:32,239 --> 01:54:33,939
Yeah, three, four, five.

2088
01:54:33,939 --> 01:54:36,500
I'm just gonna shoot it randomly over here.

2089
01:54:36,539 --> 01:54:39,050
Let's see if I end the game.

2090
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:40,729
I don't even, how big is the orbital strike?

2091
01:54:40,729 --> 01:54:41,770
Oh, yeah.

2092
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:44,659
I think I ended it with my strike.

2093
01:54:44,659 --> 01:54:45,779
Orbital strike's huge.

2094
01:54:45,779 --> 01:54:46,619
Yeah, it's huge.

2095
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:48,939
When I use it, I got like four or five kills of them.

2096
01:54:48,939 --> 01:54:52,159
Hey, 31 fly tailed medals.

2097
01:54:52,159 --> 01:54:53,359
Sick.

2098
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:56,680
Simpsons 999, yes, italics is on that server.

2099
01:54:56,680 --> 01:55:02,310
Yeah.

2100
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:07,039
Oh, all right though, I think that's,

2101
01:55:07,039 --> 01:55:09,569
that's gonna be it for the stream.

2102
01:55:09,569 --> 01:55:12,689
First place, second place, third place, fifth place.

2103
01:55:12,689 --> 01:55:14,199
Cool.

2104
01:55:14,199 --> 01:55:15,680
That's pretty legit.

2105
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:18,500
Yeah, it's almost too legit, I'm gonna say.

2106
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:19,979
Almost.

2107
01:55:20,939 --> 01:55:26,270
Yeah, sorry, Ari, if you didn't get it in time.

2108
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:27,470
Sorry, I didn't get it in time, Ari.

2109
01:55:27,470 --> 01:55:29,720
Let's do it for next time.

2110
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:32,569
Yeah, I know, I'm getting it for next time.

2111
01:55:32,569 --> 01:55:36,470
Yeah, thanks everybody for coming, appreciate it.

2112
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:40,510
Are you gonna play QWOP to end the stream by yourself?

2113
01:55:40,510 --> 01:55:44,510
To end the stream by myself, I am.

2114
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:46,430
I'm probably gonna go get some butter toast

2115
01:55:46,430 --> 01:55:50,329
because I just woke up and it's like 5 p.m.

2116
01:55:50,329 --> 01:55:51,609
All right, well, for bandwidth purposes,

2117
01:55:51,609 --> 01:55:53,649
I'm gonna just end the call.

2118
01:55:53,649 --> 01:55:55,529
No, I'm gonna end the call because I'm the host.

2119
01:55:55,529 --> 01:55:57,899
All right, well, thanks for coming to the stream, guys.

2120
01:55:57,899 --> 01:56:01,239
All right, see you next time.

2121
01:56:01,239 --> 01:56:02,079
Take care.

2122
01:56:02,079 --> 01:56:05,149
That is.

2123
01:56:05,149 --> 01:56:07,130
All right, let's play a little QWOP.

2124
01:56:07,130 --> 01:56:08,609
If you missed it, I'm gonna upload this whole thing

2125
01:56:08,609 --> 01:56:11,739
to YouTube, by the way.

2126
01:56:11,739 --> 01:56:13,510
So the whole thing will be on YouTube

2127
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:19,409
if you missed the beginning.

2128
01:56:19,409 --> 01:56:22,170
Make sure this is even lined up.

2129
01:56:22,170 --> 01:56:24,409
Oh, what's this big annoying ad over here?

2130
01:56:24,409 --> 01:56:26,449
Oh my God, I'm refreshing this.

2131
01:56:26,449 --> 01:56:28,640
That's gonna give me a seizure.

2132
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:36,260
Here we go, let's do it.

2133
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:41,149
All right, I'm gonna really take my time with this.

2134
01:56:41,149 --> 01:56:44,260
See if I can get into slug mode again.

2135
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:45,539
Yeah, thank you if you guys are taking off.

2136
01:56:45,539 --> 01:56:46,539
Thank you so much for coming.

2137
01:56:46,539 --> 01:56:47,979
If you missed the beginning of the stream,

2138
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:50,960
it's gonna be on YouTube in the next probably couple hours.

2139
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,880
Whenever YouTube decides to process it,

2140
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:55,010
who knows how long that's gonna take.

2141
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:58,239
But yeah, it's ended on this one last one.

2142
01:56:58,239 --> 01:57:01,000
Come on, now I'm going backwards.

2143
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:05,279
Going backwards, that's not what I wanna do.

2144
01:57:05,279 --> 01:57:12,180
Uh, uh, dang.

2145
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:13,539
If I get 10 meters, I'll be happy.

2146
01:57:13,539 --> 01:57:17,180
That's all I care about.

2147
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:21,119
Oh yeah, I feel like I'm doing a dance move.

2148
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:25,560
Like stick your left leg out, pull your left leg down.

2149
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:29,510
That's gonna be the, oh my God.

2150
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:32,840
I can't go forward.

2151
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:35,399
My right leg is always the leg that I can never use.

2152
01:57:35,399 --> 01:57:36,399
I don't know why.

2153
01:57:36,399 --> 01:57:40,060
It just always ends up like that.

2154
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:43,090
And that's when we fall backwards.

2155
01:57:43,090 --> 01:57:48,960
Ah, but yeah, thank you so much guys.

2156
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,380
I'm gonna end it with that.

2157
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:55,579
I am tired.

2158
01:57:55,579 --> 01:57:58,470
But yeah, I'll catch you guys later.

2159
01:57:58,470 --> 01:57:59,310
Thanks again for coming.

2160
01:57:59,310 --> 01:58:01,680
This will be on YouTube again, like I said.

2161
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:03,479
So peace guys.

2162
01:58:03,479 --> 01:58:06,880
Oh, I'm getting some acid reflux.

2163
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:07,800
But yeah, peace guys.

2164
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,529
Thank you so much for coming.

2165
01:58:09,529 --> 01:58:11,630
Take care guys.

2166
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:12,470
Bye.
