1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,080
Oh, you know, you could be this guy with the book too. This like, Monopoly man. You're the fucking Monopoly man.

2
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:14,769
Nope, it wasn't me.

3
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:16,199
What?

4
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,350
I'm pretty good at these things, I think.

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,350
Well, you know, I'm going to know what they are.

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,350
Yeah, I know.

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,039
That's fine.

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,039
I'm picking my spy.

9
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,439
Alright, I'm ready.

10
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:43,460
Are you?

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,460
Because you're going to pick the Monopoly guy now. I'm going to see the Monopoly guy.

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,460
Why would I be that stupid?

13
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:56,130
Oh yeah, let me pick the guy that you would just... Yeah, that's a great idea.

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,130
I'm looking, I'm looking.

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,899
It's so scary. It's so scary because I can see the laser.

16
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:02,899
Is it on your head?

17
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:06,269
No, I can just see it. I can see the laser.

18
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:09,269
I know. Well, if you see the laser on your head, the Monopoly guy.

19
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:22,340
I can see the laser pointing into the room. That's all I'm telling you right now.

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,340
I'm so scared.

21
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:27,349
No, don't shoot me. Don't shoot me.

22
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,319
Playing the psychology role.

23
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,319
Oh yeah. Well, I'm going to get you. I think I've already got this figured out.

24
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,159
You should be scared right now.

25
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,159
Oh yeah?

26
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,159
You should be whimpering.

27
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,299
Fuck!

28
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:46,299
If that's the indicate. These guys are all suspected double agents, okay?

29
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,760
So that means you're over here somewhere. You're in this crowd somewhere.

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,579
Of course I'm in. This whole room is a crowd.

31
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:58,579
No, no, no. You're in this crowd like over on the right.

32
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:03,120
Because these guys were suspected. They were suspected criminals.

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,319
And you're over here. You're one of these four people.

34
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,319
How could I possibly be one of these four people?

35
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,710
Because I think you're the guy in the mustard jacket.

36
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,550
I think you're the guy in the mustard jacket.

37
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,550
Who wears mustard?

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,860
I got my eye on you.

39
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,860
I got my eye on the mustard jacket.

40
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,180
Okay, now you said I'm out of here.

41
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,180
Which means you have to be one of these people.

42
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,180
Because how would you have known he even walked away?

43
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,620
Oh, that's right. I just figured it out.

44
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,819
You're one of the guys in the mustard colored jacket.

45
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,500
Okay.

46
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
I don't know which one of them you are, but I know.

47
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Or you're the lady.

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
All right, great. Everybody else out.

49
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
I know which one of these guys you are.

50
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,770
Yeah, you're that guy. You're definitely that guy.

51
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,520
Say your prayers.

52
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,300
No!

53
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,300
You're not good at this.

54
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,300
You were the lady. I knew you were one of those guys or you were the lady.

55
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Oh, no.

56
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,009
You're going to be the freaking monopoly guy again.

57
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:15,169
You're just going to play with the monopoly guy every single time.

58
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,370
This is a poker game. I'm not going to give you any tells.

59
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,270
Are there even 16 different party goers?

60
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,270
I don't know. It looks like there are.

61
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,770
I'm taking the shot.

62
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,129
I was the monopoly guy.

63
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,129
I should have shot the monopoly guy.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
I should have shot the monopoly guy.

65
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Yeah, you really should have because it would have been like the monopoly guy.

66
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,099
Like it is every single time.

67
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,180
Seriously, better not pick him again. It's not going to work.

68
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,550
Hmm. This is tricky.

69
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,550
I don't want to get it wrong.

70
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,449
I have my suspicions.

71
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,330
Screw your suspicions.

72
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:17,240
My suspicions are squabbling.

73
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,779
You don't have very much time.

74
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:25,470
You haven't completed your missions. There's no way you have.

75
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,639
Okay. Okay.

76
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,939
Screw you, monopoly guy. I don't think it's you, but screw you.

77
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:38,939
Are you kidding?

78
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:46,149
Oh, you made him the double agent.

79
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:51,480
This is a weird stage. I'm in the middle. I can't move.

80
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Really?

81
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:57,699
Someone's already in...

82
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,699
That can't be you.

83
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,100
Because that's the double agent as well.

84
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,300
You can think whatever you want, bro.

85
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,300
You can think whatever you want, bro.

86
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,300
You want to know what I think?

87
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
What do you think? Let's see it.

88
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,300
I think there's a lot of statues here.

89
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,300
There are a lot of statues here, I guess.

90
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
You know what, Terma?

91
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,060
Safety is off.

92
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,060
What do you mean the safety is off?

93
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,959
Safety is off.

94
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,649
Oh, you're going to shoot that guy?

95
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:31,649
Do it. Shoot that guy right now.

96
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:33,649
Shoot him.

97
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,490
Shoot him. Shoot him right now.

98
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,790
Shoot that guy right now.

99
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,790
Shoot him in the head.

100
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
No.

101
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,040
I'm taking my time.

102
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Blow that guy's fucking head clean off his shoulders.

103
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Who's this lady?

104
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Pay attention to the other guy.

105
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Pay attention to that guy.

106
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
No, that lady didn't do anything.

107
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
That lady's going the other way.

108
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
See? I'm telling you this lady's going this way.

109
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:09,339
Man.

110
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,339
That guy's just like, I'm just staring at you.

111
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:28,620
Why don't you shoot me?

112
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,540
What is about to happen?

113
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,839
Everything.

114
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:44,610
Everything is about to happen.

115
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
You ready?

116
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm ready.

117
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
You have to hit accept. Hit accept.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,709
I was stretching.

119
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:04,829
He was looking at me right from the start.

120
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:06,829
He was staring right at me.

121
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:08,829
I was like, no.

122
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:10,829
I'm not having this guy show up to no more parties.

123
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,550
No, dude.

124
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:25,459
Are you sure it's not him?

125
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:27,459
Look, I'm not...

126
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:30,269
Okay.

127
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,269
Okay.

128
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,269
You're picking him this time though.

129
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:36,269
I know you can't resist.

130
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:38,269
Can we please play around?

131
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:40,269
Yes.

132
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:44,269
Where you do not instantly kill the Monopoly Man.

133
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
You could just watch my laser.

134
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:52,019
That's fine.

135
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:56,689
That's perfectly fine.

136
00:07:57,689 --> 00:07:58,689
Fucking Monopoly Man every time.

137
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,519
What's he doing?

138
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,870
Just standing over there.

139
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,870
He's not doing anything.

140
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,870
Too suspicious.

141
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:19,579
All right.

142
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:21,579
I'm not shooting the Monopoly Guy.

143
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:25,939
I'm not going to shoot the fucking Monopoly Guy.

144
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,939
Instantly.

145
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,670
What?

146
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,669
You missed.

147
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,340
You missed.

148
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,340
You're so bad.

149
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,340
You took like a turn too quickly.

150
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,340
You had one knob.

151
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,340
Was to kill the Monopoly.
