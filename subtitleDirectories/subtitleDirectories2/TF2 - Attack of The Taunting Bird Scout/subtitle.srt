1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:10,619
Be very careful here. Be very, very careful here. Be very careful here.

2
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:38,439
There he is. Okay, if I don't get this guy right now, then I don't know. Zoom in. Dude,

3
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:44,520
the other team's over there. Scope in. Scope in, dude. Scope in. What are you, what are you doing?

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,310
What are you checking for? Landmines? Let's go. Does nobody know I'm standing right here?

5
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:11,849
Hi. Oh, this is so much fun, dude. This item is so much fun. Forget about the mini crits,

6
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:16,810
man. This thing is just a blast. Just jumping around is like the funnest damn thing ever.

7
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,299
This is so much fun. Watch this, this sniper right here. I think this is my, yeah, there's a sniper

8
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:34,819
right here. Wow, here comes a pyro. Where'd he go? What? Oh, he's got this too. We, this

9
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:48,099
two bird scouts. All right, I'm feeling it. I'm feeling the double bird scout. Um, Sir, I just

10
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:56,599
shot you like three times. Sir, I'm standing in front of you. Sir. Sir. Excuse me, sir.

11
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:09,580
See that roost up there? You see this roost? I'm going to roast their turkeys in a second.

12
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,539
You're going to get your fucking turkeys roasted, snipers. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

13
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:22,520
Thought I had more ammo. I thought I had more ammo. You want to get your turkey roasted? Open

14
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,280
the door. You want to get your turkey roasted? Go ahead and open the door.

15
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:37,539
Roasted turkey, oven roasted with some ham and some onion. What about this guy? You want to get

16
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:46,979
your fucking turkey roasted. Are they still up there? Oh yeah, they are. Oh, you better believe

17
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:55,689
it. Please don't shoot me in the face already. Make sure I equip the nice bird jump. Is anybody

18
00:02:55,689 --> 00:03:07,770
up there? Whoa. See you. See you later. No, come on. Get up there. That's so dumb.

19
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:15,639
I'm out of here. See, I left. I'm not here. You don't have to worry about a thing. I'm not here.

20
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,229
All right. I'm not here. See, I'm gone. See, I'm gone. I'm gone. Don't even worry about it.

21
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:29,159
It's, there's no reason to be that concerned about this. Just walk into just my God. Can I

22
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:36,039
please get this? Is it not going to even happen? I'm swear to God, dude, please just walk in.

23
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:47,639
Don't, please. Earthquake. Don't mind me. I'm just going to chill out right here.

24
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,599
I'm going to get seen. There's no way no one's going to see me do this. Some soldier is going

25
00:03:52,599 --> 00:04:05,110
to turn the corner. Wait, I spy in the window. I think he's AFK. Oh my fucking God. Oh my God.

26
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:14,520
Oh, that only, only two. I don't have any words for that. I don't have words for that. I just

27
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:26,980
got so destroyed right there. That was horrible. I'm on his head. He didn't even know. He doesn't

28
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:37,300
know. He didn't even know. He didn't even know. Give me that health pack. Can I have that health

29
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:44,310
pack please? You want to jump scare me medic? Is that what you want to do? You want to jump

30
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,790
scare me? Huh? I ain't going to get jump scared twice. That's a spy. You want to go? You want to

31
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:58,259
activate the bird scout? Come on. Bird scout. Ooh, see you later. You think you're going to get away.

32
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:12,629
You can never defeat the bird scout. Come on dudes. Where's the? Oh, hello. Oh, hello.

33
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:29,800
The confusion. Confusion sets in. I actually get a kill, but that's not what I wanted.

34
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,300
God, that's going to be such a pain in the ass to deal with. A scout jumping around all of you

35
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,819
is annoying. A scout jumping around all around you 20, 30 feet in the air has got to be even

36
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:45,480
more annoying. There's a lot of people stuffed in that room. Here we go. This is what I want to do.

37
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:58,620
I can't. Hi everybody. How are you? What? You. How did he hit me with a melee?

38
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:08,550
That didn't make any sense. I was like 40 feet above everybody. Holy hell. What the hell was that?

39
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:13,449
Oh, watch this. This heavy, this heavy, this heavy. Here we go. What? What's going on?

40
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:27,019
What happened? What just happened?
