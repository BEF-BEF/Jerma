1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,539
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Theme Hospital.

2
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:18,239
Now, this is kind of going to be in the Enlightened series, I guess you could say.

3
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,539
Even though it's been a million years since you've last seen Enlightened.

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,469
But can you even read this text? I don't think, whatever, you can't read it.

5
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:30,969
I know how to play. This used to be one of my favorite games on the PlayStation 1, if you could believe it.

6
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:34,770
And you run your own hospital. It's one of the first, I can't really say first,

7
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,770
but it's one of the original hospital sims. It might even be the only hospital sim.

8
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,810
I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about. But we're going to get right into this here.

9
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,109
I'm just going to play until I don't care anymore. Maybe like 10, 15 minutes.

10
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:52,810
If you want to see more of Theme Hospital, then let me know.

11
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,710
But I should probably get going because the hospital opens in like 35 seconds.

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,539
So let's go. I know I need a GP's office.

13
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:07,519
And it works just like the sims, where you kind of build rooms, you build individual walls.

14
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,640
I don't want the GP's office that huge. That looks good.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,920
That's not a valid blueprint? Well, screw you. Now it is. Check.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,849
Got to put the door on. Couple of windows. Alright.

17
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,549
So this is where people come into the hospital. The whole point of this...

18
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:28,969
Oh, damn it. Hold on. I didn't mean to do that. Pick that up.

19
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:34,540
Pick up the... Whatever. My doctor doesn't even need to face his patients. I really don't care.

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,269
This guy's going to give me tips and tricks as we go, but whatever.

21
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:43,969
So when people walk in the door with an illness, let's say that I have a cough, my like chest hurts.

22
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:50,430
Then they go to the receptionist who is not currently here yet, but I'm going to make her.

23
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:58,239
Where is facilities? Clinics? Treatment? Diagnostics? Where the hell is the reception?

24
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,260
Oh, there it is. Reception desk. And that's the build button.

25
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,760
So people come right... Should we make it like right here so they don't have to wait in line at all?

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,979
Yeah, we will. Got to hire a receptionist.

27
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:15,080
Alright, who can we hire?

28
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,740
K Kingsmith. She seems like a bitch. I don't think we want her.

29
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,169
F Petcliff. Enjoys river widening. Poorly trained and...

30
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:29,949
I thought that said reckless. Feckless.

31
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:37,539
What? Is that an F? Am I crazy? Why is that an F? Poorly trained and feckless.

32
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:40,469
Alright, well anyways, she's reckless. I don't want her.

33
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:44,969
Drinks wine dedicated to helping people with a smile. You know, she might be drunk,

34
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:50,009
but she's going to take the job seriously. Except she's like walking the wrong way.

35
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:55,199
Honey. Honey, you're the recep... Oh no, that's a nurse! Shit!

36
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,719
It's okay, we'll need her later. Here's the receptionist. Here we go.

37
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,719
Very friendly. Very friendly. There.

38
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,520
I accidentally made a stupid nurse that's not going to do anything until we need her later.

39
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,620
Okay, well whatever. I need a doctor. This hospital is going to open soon.

40
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,469
Got to get a doctor to in the doctor's office.

41
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:16,620
Alright, we could do this guy. An expert at DIY. Rude and abrasive.

42
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,180
Gets people's backs up. Gets people's backs up? What? What?

43
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,669
It's kind of an explanation. Tickles trout. No, stop it.

44
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:31,479
Enjoys French art house films? Alright, well this guy's alright. He likes like films.

45
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,919
Go work there, you son of a bitch.

46
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,419
Alright, we got our doctor that sees the patients. We got our nurse wandering aimlessly.

47
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,419
And we have our reception right at the front door.

48
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:47,419
So, we need general diagnostics. We'll put that right next to...

49
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,620
You are so loud, lady. I wish you didn't just scream in my ear.

50
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,870
We're going to put a couple benches over here. Don't worry, this is where people get diagnosed.

51
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:05,500
The changing screen will go right next to the window. I want people to get like seen naked.

52
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,389
This like weird machine can go over here. And there we go.

53
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:17,139
I believe we need a doctor to actually be in here to like take care of people.

54
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,639
And this guy's going to have to like do two things at once. Do we have any patients yet?

55
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,639
No, the door to the hospital's not even open.

56
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:27,819
Wandering the nurse is okay for the time being. I need a janitor, I know that.

57
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:33,250
Alright, grandpa collects World War II shrapnel and go back.

58
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,120
Well, you already got fired.

59
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,920
Smuggles fake watchers. Superb stamina. You know, he just keeps going.

60
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,920
You know, it's grandpa. Alright, well just go over there. Screw you.

61
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,879
Hospital's open. The hospital is officially open.

62
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,810
We're going to get some people with some weird diseases to walk up this weird like Tetris hallway.

63
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,490
Look at this guy. He's freaking out.

64
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,670
Hey, dude, somebody gave like grandpa too much coffee.

65
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,670
I gotta go. I gotta go. Where's the trash?

66
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,399
What a psycho. Somebody needs to slow him down.

67
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,079
Do we have any patients yet? Uh oh. Ladies and gentlemen, we got a live one.

68
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,699
Okay, he's going to go over here. Actually, I want benches. I want benches.

69
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:24,839
A bench to go right here. Come in. I'm taking a dump.

70
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,839
See, this guy diagnoses the problem. He sends them over to the other doctor that does not exist yet, but he will very shortly.

71
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:35,290
Doctor? I'm working on it. I'm working on it.

72
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,290
Whatever. You can do it. It doesn't matter.

73
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,040
Hey, I just got this job five seconds ago.

74
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
You've satisfied the financial criteria for this level.

75
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Now keep your balance above a thousand while making sure your hospital is running efficiently.

76
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,480
Where are people going?

77
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,939
Alright, just diagnose this guy. Grandpa's still on crack. That's fine.

78
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:05,560
We got diagnosis. We could go for a psychiatric ward, I think, in case any people come in that need to get their mental health in check.

79
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,920
I know I need a pharmacy, and that gives a place for the nurse to go who's wandering around the pharmacy.

80
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:17,129
Yeah, he's going. Don't worry. Pharmacy will be over here. A little bit bigger.

81
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:22,100
Gonna put you to work, nurse, because you're kind of just doing nothing.

82
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,529
You're just wasting like $100 an hour for me.

83
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:33,240
Alright, get in there. You. Get. Get in there. I just put her in.

84
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,680
British lady, that's yelling at me. I understand.

85
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Okay, we got another one. Where'd that patient go? Where'd that first patient go?

86
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,620
Oh, he's gonna go get like a drink.

87
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,620
Alright, let's see if we can cure our first patient.

88
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:52,899
How do you feel? You paid me $400. Sick.

89
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,899
Thank you for coming to the hospital, sir. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.

90
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,899
Hopefully you don't go home and insta-puke.

91
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:00,899
Well, thanks for the high rating, too. I appreciate that. Thank you.

92
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:04,290
Oh, shit. Where is he?

93
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,720
Yeah, get over there, you chump.

94
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,089
Yeah, he's knocking on the door. He's standing in front of him.

95
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:14,800
Okay, I gotta make another... Facilities.

96
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,170
Need some... I need some bathrooms.

97
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,000
Bathrooms can go up here. Yeah.

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,439
That's a pretty huge bathroom.

99
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:29,060
Yeah, there's one... Oh, man. This bathroom's way too big.

100
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,060
And you know, just because I'm a cynical dick,

101
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,060
I'm gonna put the staff room next to the toilets,

102
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,360
because I'm just a jerk. I'm a bad boss.

103
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
And you should feel bad working for me.

104
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,759
Grandpa, get out of the way. I can't build this if you're standing on it.

105
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,709
He hasn't done any work.

106
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:51,709
He's just been running a marathon around this whole damn place.

107
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:56,240
There's the sofa. That's okay.

108
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Got the staff room now in case somebody wants to chill out.

109
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,509
No, there's no trash. Where's this guy going?

110
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:05,509
He's going to get a potion, I think, to the pharmacy.

111
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:09,579
Yeah, pay me my money. I'm the goddamn hospital owner.

112
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:11,579
I'll inject you with this syringe I got.

113
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:19,480
We gonna cure our second patient? Oh, yeah.

114
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,120
How we doing? How we doing? We got a consistency...

115
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,199
What is this guy? Oh, my God.

116
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,269
Who let, like, Uncle Fester in here?

117
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,129
He's a baby. It's a baby.

118
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
This guy has a baby face. That's his disease.

119
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,379
Uh, yeah, doctor, you know, I'm not sure if you can realize this or not,

120
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,379
but I have a friggin' baby face.

121
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:53,200
How do you cure this? This guy needs to go into, like, surgery.

122
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,570
Apparently, the baby face disease is an epidemic in this city.

123
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,389
Look at this guy, except he's, like, blonde.

124
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:03,389
Oh, wait. No, I remember. I gotta make an inflation station.

125
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:08,019
That rhymed. Uh, clinics. Inflation. There it is.

126
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:12,049
This'll go down here. There's no space over here.

127
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:15,929
But, yeah, you can get this game right now on good old games.

128
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:22,360
It's a doozy. It's a doozy.

129
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,360
I believe... I don't want to say an incorrect amount of money. I forget.

130
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
It's, like, less than ten bucks. It's, like...

131
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,360
I think it's, like, six or seven dollars for this game on GOG.com.

132
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,600
Theme Hospital is the name again. You probably saw the title.

133
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
So, I mean, whatever. Do we need another nurse? I think we do.

134
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,820
Or does the doctor have to do this? I'm not sure.

135
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
I'm sure the lady will yell at me once I find out what...

136
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,210
No, we got the invisible man. He's, like, the invisible disease.

137
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,450
All right, now I need another doctor. Gotta hire another doctor.

138
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,450
How are my resources doing? Pretty good.

139
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,230
All right, I'm gonna find a good doctor.

140
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,850
Ex-Quiz Show host, rash and easily distracted.

141
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,350
Sings in a rock and roll band? Absolutely.

142
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,350
You are the new hiree.

143
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,350
Now, let's, like, take some of that air out of your face.

144
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:16,240
Oh! Oh, my...

145
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Keep in mind, guys, that guy just paid me $850

146
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,240
to stick a needle in his face and blow his head up.

147
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
That probably was very painful.

148
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,200
Okay, okay, okay.

149
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,049
This guy...

150
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,480
That 72% is pretty high.

151
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm gonna go ahead and say go for it. Go for it.

152
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,110
This is the guy, right? Let's see if it works.

153
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,120
I got one of the best nurses in the city working for me.

154
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Dude, you'll be fine.

155
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,899
There you go. Good as new. Good as new.

156
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:17,600
And...hey, it worked.

157
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,039
For the money. VIP.

158
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,639
The mayor of Crater...

159
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,879
What? He's dead. You just killed your first patient.

160
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,879
No, it said there was a 72% chance I was...

161
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,879
Wait, he's alive.

162
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,470
Oh, no, never mind. See you later, death.

163
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,769
That was a 72% chance that it was gonna work.

164
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,009
I don't want to do that again.

165
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:47,789
This is an even less chance. What the...what?

166
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:51,120
All right, hold on. Let me get another diagnostic room.

167
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,320
Let's see if we can make this right.

168
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,309
Ward, pharmacy,

169
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:59,309
inflation, diagnostic, psychiatric...

170
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:02,679
Maybe it's all in their head.

171
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,860
We're gonna get a ward up here.

172
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,509
Because maybe we gotta send these guys to the ward?

173
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:10,509
That was ridiculous. I can't believe that guy died.

174
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:13,320
No, I can't go there. I can't go there.

175
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,820
Where am I gonna put this goddamn...

176
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,149
I did pretty poor planning.

177
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:22,139
I'm just gonna have to go over here.

178
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:24,139
Damn it. No, that's a terrible spot.

179
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,759
What about right here? It'll be next to the reception desk.

180
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,919
Holy hell, that's a terrible spot for this.

181
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,289
Hey, welcome to the hospital.

182
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:38,730
Place more benches? People are...

183
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,100
being forced to stand up.

184
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,169
What is Maya McCheese doing?

185
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:47,120
Is he like gonna...

186
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,919
Oh, shut up. Shut up.

187
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,990
We're good. Send the invisible guy over here.

188
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,059
Let's go...no, no, no. I don't want to do that.

189
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,960
I need another nurse, right?

190
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,700
I do. Oh, there she is.

191
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,590
But that means the nurse from over here just left.

192
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,590
Where's the nurse now? I'll pay for it.

193
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,240
I got the money. Why not?

194
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,309
Oh, benches, that's what she said?

195
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:17,610
Need a drink machine, too. Dr. Pepper.

196
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,610
Gotta have like a Dr. Pepper machine, like right next to the doctor's office.

197
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,240
Look at how popular this thing are.

198
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,480
$20?!

199
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,840
Did you just see how much money that was?

200
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
That was $20

201
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,159
for a Coke. $20.

202
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,159
I don't know what kind of weird, screwed-up

203
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,159
dimension these people are living in

204
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,159
where soda is $20.

205
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,360
I'm a bad man for running this kind of

206
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,100
organization. Get out of here.

207
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,340
Okay. Hall of Shame?

208
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,820
Did I just lose the game?

209
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,759
Did I lose the game?

210
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:06,080
What?

211
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Dear Jerma, marvelous, you have handled the

212
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
running of this hospital superbly.

213
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Us bigwigs at the Ministry

214
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
of Health would like to know if you'd be interested

215
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,080
in taking on a larger project.

216
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
This is a job we think would be perfect for you.

217
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
The salary would be $16,000.

218
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
I would absolutely

219
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
take that. Thank you so much.

220
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,320
I did it. I beat the level.

221
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,679
What do you know about that?

222
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,679
Anyways, guys, that's probably going to wrap up this episode.

223
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,679
If you want to see more Theme Hospital,

224
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,679
I mean, I'm not sure how much of a series

225
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,679
I'm going to do with this because it's pretty self-explanatory,

226
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,679
but it's a very, very fun game, Live

227
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,679
Enlighten, today, if you enjoyed it.

228
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,679
Then let me know, and I'll see you guys all next time.

229
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,679
Take care, everybody. See you all

230
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,679
soon. Inject the needle in his face.
