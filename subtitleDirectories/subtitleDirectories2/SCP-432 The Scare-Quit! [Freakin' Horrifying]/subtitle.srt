1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:17,699
And I'm not ready for this. I don't I it's been a while since I've done a scare Saturday, but hey, what's going on everybody?

2
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:26,460
German here with SCP 432. I've been sitting here. Can I just tell you before the before we get going?

3
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,820
I've been sitting here for like

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:36,509
15 minutes just sitting here going I do I want to do this and the answer is yes

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,149
Let's go. So this is kind of like the other SCP games

6
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:49,549
It is very very dark kind of like the other SCP games where you would go investigate

7
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,429
things and stuff

8
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:57,710
That's a light. Okay

9
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,149
Apparently I got to pick up artifacts or something

10
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:10,140
the worst part is just the fact that it's just the same texture over and over again in this maze of a building and

11
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,290
There's a monster in here

12
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:25,180
Somewhere is a valve. Don't think I need to do anything with that. Okay, what's this?

13
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,780
You found an artifact the artifact. Okay. So what do I do with it?

14
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:41,540
I think I just have to pick them up and then escape just got to escape

15
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:49,849
Just got to pick up the artifacts and just get the hell out of here crying out loud. It's a goddamn maze

16
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:57,549
These pipes keep scaring the shit out of me. What was that?

17
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:08,330
I kind of don't want to go over to this light, but I kind of feel like I have to all right F is flashlight

18
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:18,479
All right, that's just the light bulb. Okay. Why am I shaking? Why is why is the world shaking?

19
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:30,080
Can hear noises that I don't like to hear. Yeah

20
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:42,259
What's that? What's this like fairy dust on the ground? Oh, this is roller skates sick

21
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:46,379
I got like the roller skates I can compete in like the roller derby

22
00:02:46,379 --> 00:03:02,750
I got two not exactly sure what that means, but there's nothing over here. I wish there was like a map

23
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:17,129
Turn it turn the flashlight off turn the flash light off hold

24
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:32,300
What is that on the wall it's gone what is what is that it's not there anymore

25
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:43,400
My whole body just tensed up. I feel like I just lifted two hundred pounds of weight

26
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:52,569
I just did all my reps for like the week cuz like the thing with like the the flaming

27
00:03:53,099 --> 00:04:03,840
Dr. Doom skull was looking at me. There's just no I just don't know where I'm going

28
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:20,029
There's just no indication of where you're ever supposed to go in these games. Good evening. My name is Jerma

29
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:29,509
I would like to sell you some land what it's

30
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:40,430
Oh

31
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:10,410
How long has it been I've only been recording for five minutes well

32
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:19,629
Okay, the tight corridors make it so much worse, but a quick little scare Saturdays guys

33
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:26,089
I'm a baby. I know but that thing was too scary and I almost died

34
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:32,209
Playing it. So thank you all so much for watching really do appreciate it. I've got a pretty good suntan today

35
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:39,449

36
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:47,769
