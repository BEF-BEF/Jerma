1
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:32,130
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Testing out stuff. Testing out the stream. Testing out the stream. Testing out stuff. Testing out the stream. Testing out the stream.

2
00:00:32,130 --> 00:01:08,840
Oh, test it. Test it. Alright. Good enough.

3
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:32,519
Noto!

4
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:53,640
Oh yeah. Somebody gotta stop that bomb.

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,290
Alright, let me get out of here. Let me just get out. Oh, I got a new item. Sick.

6
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:13,860
Okay. Are we live? I hope so.

7
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:24,740
Pop this out.

8
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:49,699
Alright. Okay. Looks like we're live.

9
00:02:49,699 --> 00:03:02,139
Should be. Oh, we are. There we are. Hey guys.

10
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,139
Pop that out.

11
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:10,139
Okay. There we go.

12
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:24,840
Let's lower this. Alrighty.

13
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:33,349
Okay. Hello. Oh, I gotta tell people I'm streaming.

14
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:42,759
Gonna play some CSGO tonight. Along with some TF2.

15
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:50,180
Oh, happy St. Patrick's Day everybody. I didn't even say that.

16
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:59,740
This is a second livestream on YouTube.

17
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,740
Hopefully it goes well. Hopefully nothing explodes.

18
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:12,759
But yeah, happy St. Patrick's Day. May the luck of the Irish shine upon you.

19
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:26,709
I'm gonna find a better server than that. I do live in Boston.

20
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:34,839
One, two, three. I'm reading it. Alright, let's get this going.

21
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:42,069
Alright, hold on. I gotta tell my Steam group what's going on.

22
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:49,000
Because I'm trying to do the transition from Twitch to YouTube.

23
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So we'll see how it goes. I got a lot of

24
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
mixed responses. A lot of people are like, no, go to Twitch. And then people say, no,

25
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
YouTube is much better. It's torn between two different places.

26
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But eventually I'm gonna be able to stream in HD on here.

27
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,620
So that should be pretty cool. And why can't I go to my Steam group?

28
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:19,800
Oh, right. I'm not even online. Whoops!

29
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:26,920
Let's get to an event. Saturday YouTube

30
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:41,000
stream. Oh, potty.

31
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:59,740
And play. Woohoo!

32
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:14,259
Alright, let's get a server here. It has nobody in it. Alright, zero out of

33
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:19,720
28. Arena Lumberyard? I don't know if I wanna go there.

34
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:27,220
One, two, three. Let's get zero out of 32. Here we go. Here we go.

35
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:34,069
Zero out of 32. That's what I'm looking for. Warmfront.

36
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:43,420
Casbah. King of the Hill Nucleus. Let's go to Nucleus.

37
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,779
Alright, guys. This is the server I'm playing on right now.

38
00:06:47,779 --> 00:07:07,350
And here it comes. We'll let everybody go. Yo!

39
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:13,259
My stream's broken. My stream isn't broken, is it?

40
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:35,129
Try and refresh it. Give it a good ol' refresh. Alright,

41
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:39,560
join that. I just put an IP into the chat and that's where I'm gonna be playing.

42
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:52,680
Oh, using the Floggestinator. I'm not gonna play with that.

43
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:02,790
Play Soldier. Anybody even in here? Alright, Weston.

44
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,420
If some of you guys could repost the IP, I'd be very grateful.

45
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:21,740
Give him hell. What's going on, chicken?

46
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:28,019
So I have a new mouse. We're gonna see how well this goes. How did I not hit that guy?

47
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,259
I got a Razor Deathadder. Ow!

48
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:40,090
Yeah, Razor Deathadder. It's the blue one. The one that lights up blue.

49
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:49,559
Never gonna give. Never gonna give. So, a lot of

50
00:08:49,559 --> 00:09:03,269
people can't load the stream. I wonder why. Everything should

51
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:12,500
be the same as it was last time. Is more than one person having stream problems?

52
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:20,440
Or is it just one or two people? Error, huh?

53
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:32,980
Hold on a second. That's weird. The people that are having problems,

54
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,679
what country are you from?

55
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:42,679
It might be because you're from a country that doesn't support it or something.

56
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:52,740
YouTube is still in kind of like the beta streaming stages.

57
00:09:52,740 --> 00:10:02,730
Oh my God. I can't believe I...

58
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,570
How? Yeah, I guess if you're having stream problems,

59
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,570
just close out your browser and then come back or clear out

60
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,059
some of your cookies or something like that. I don't know. I wish I knew what was going on.

61
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:21,059
If everybody was having that problem, I would be like, Darn! I'd have to fix it right away.

62
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:32,779
Oh, that was so lucky. Oh, you're under the spy?

63
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:37,399
Oh my God.

64
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:44,120
Yeah.

65
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:54,299
Let me just look at my own stream and see what happens.

66
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:58,299
Gonna pull it up for a second here. Just wanna see what it looks like for me.

67
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:04,120
Expedia. Let's see.

68
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,820
Why did I just get a double add?

69
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:19,690
I got a double add on my own stream.

70
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,690
Offer a sacrifice to YouTube. I mean, it looks... Yeah, I'll show you guys. We'll do streamception.

71
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:29,190
It looks alright on my end. I don't know.

72
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,190
I'm not sure, guys. I apologize if it doesn't look like that

73
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,070
on your screen. Oh my God, look at all these people.

74
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,269
High five, baby. Oh, we're gonna get spawn trapped. Everyone's

75
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:55,820
just in here hanging out. Oh, crit screen. Oh no.

76
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:02,409
Put a lot of pressure on me here. That's not a spy.

77
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:10,230
Oh my God. It's lagging so bad.

78
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,879
Oh God. I just hit like a lag patch right there. That wasn't good.

79
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:21,590
Oh yeah, I'll show my loadouts. Good call. Good call, Luke.

80
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:26,539
Oh, I just missed your name. Good call, Phoenix. So right now

81
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:31,220
I'm using the black box, the reserve shooter, and the equalizer. And

82
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:51,190
I got this stuff on, too. There we go. Let's do it.

83
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:59,019
Alright, so I'm getting a couple more messages saying the

84
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:07,350
stream is all screwed up. Now we're gonna do this, right? We'll do this.

85
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:13,049
I'm not sure if I can even restart it, to be honest. It might like

86
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:34,870
screw a bunch of stuff up. Yes. We'll go scout.

87
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,299
I got the mad milk. The stock.

88
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:43,740
Stock. Oh crap. No, die.

89
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:50,659
Well, the only thing I can say is if people are still having

90
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:54,659
problems, then this should be uploaded

91
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:59,159
to YouTube within the next hour or two. You should be able to watch it on

92
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:10,250
YouTube. I don't know. Maybe I'll try restarting it, because it looks like

93
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:18,840
more people are having problems. Control point enabled. Get going.

94
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:26,919
Yeah, it's a razor death adder. I like it. It's good.

95
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:30,919
I'm not a big fan of big bulky mice, but this is

96
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:37,500
this fits comfortably. Oh, damn.

97
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:50,679
Oh my god, they're right outside the door.

98
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:56,440
That just like scared the crap out of me. No, I'm going this way.

99
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:03,299
Let's get out of here. Come on, spy. Let's get the hell out of here.

100
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:08,889
I'm lagging so bad. Look at how bad I'm lagging

101
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:20,870
right now. Everyone's like a freaking slideshow. Streamception.

102
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:30,039
Did I kill that guy? I just confused myself.

103
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:36,889
I can't believe I made it.

104
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:43,799
Logitech all day.

105
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:53,860
Yeah, actually, you know what? If some of you guys will notice,

106
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,100
I have quick switch on now. I am not using the regular

107
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,340
non-quick switch anymore, because I can do stuff like this. See how I switch

108
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:09,529
that? Because I got a button on my thumb now. I can use the button on my thumb

109
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:14,259
to switch to the melee slot.

110
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:18,259
Cool, huh? No more slow switch for Jerma.

111
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:25,769
Those are the days of the past. Oh my god, so many people

112
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:31,210
up there. Chris Krieg, oh my god.

113
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:36,789
Hold on, I'm gonna go... I'm going Soldier.

114
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:41,460
No, no, no, no. Somebody said go Combat Engie. I will.

115
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:47,429
I will go Combat Engie. Oh my god, they got us like

116
00:16:47,429 --> 00:17:03,240
spawn-trapped. We are spawn-trapped.

117
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,920
Anybody up here? Sentry down. Sentry down?

118
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:17,400
How am I... It's giving me a break. I got one

119
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,960
hit on that guy. Oh my god, I just realized something.

120
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,029
I don't have the gunslinger on.

121
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:31,029
Are you serious? Alright, well, whatever. This works.

122
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:43,240
Nice. Big sentry, baby. Oh no.

123
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,779
Oh no. Oh no, I have no metal. That's fine, take it out.

124
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:54,730
I don't care. What just even happened to me right there?

125
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,730
What is going on? There's so much lag on this server.

126
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:04,119
Jerma, the girl I have is... Do you have any dating advice?

127
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:09,690
Do I have any dating advice? The only

128
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,990
dating advice I could give is... I don't know.

129
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:19,259
I'm not really the best at... I gotta take this off.

130
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:24,579
I'm not really the best at dating advice, to be honest. If I had any, I would definitely give it to you.

131
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:30,359
The only thing I can really say is, don't pretend to be somebody

132
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,430
and not. Because after a while, people find out.

133
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:40,380
That's pretty much the only advice I can really give. Oh, stair stab.

134
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:52,150
Where did my sentry even go? What just happened? What even just happened to me?

135
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:57,220
No, I am not stoned. I am not.

136
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,220
I don't do that. Drug free up in here.

137
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:15,220
Dating advice. It's a trap.

138
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,220
We gotta get him away from the spawn. I'm going the other way. My god.

139
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:27,740
Get in the face. Wait, how did I not... No, I'm gonna die.

140
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:35,180
And that's a spy. Oh yeah, I got like a dozen extra eggs

141
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,990
here. I have two dozen eggs. No, I'm just kidding.

142
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,990
No more eggs for me. Not unless I make a stupid bet with myself.

143
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:50,390
Oh, did I make it? I made it. Alright, I made it.

144
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:57,319
Made it out of the spawn door. I'll probably stream for an hour or two.

145
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:07,180
Oh my god, that just scared the crap out of me.

146
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:15,819
Yes, I am playing in a window.

147
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:28,809
I am in a window. Get him off the port.

148
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:37,779
Punch him in the face. Eggs. No, I'm not from New Jersey.

149
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:44,009
I'm from Boston. I'm from the bean town. And if you're just joining the stream,

150
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:48,009
happy St. Patrick's Day. If you happen to be of Irish descent.

151
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:52,569
I am of Irish descent, so. Later on, after this stream,

152
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:56,569
I'm going with my family. We're gonna go get some corned beef and cabbage

153
00:20:56,569 --> 00:21:01,319
at a restaurant. Should be a good time. Get to see some

154
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:06,839
aunts and uncles I haven't seen in a little while, so. Should be cool.

155
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,079
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I can't, oh my god.

156
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:15,079
How did I survive that? Holy crap.

157
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:20,539
I need like health. I can't believe I survived that.

158
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:29,180
Come on, come on, come on. Just at least give me like, oh,

159
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,349
what am I doing? My brain just like exploded right there.

160
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:37,980
I'm trying to like, will I build something and just die with crit?

161
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:46,039
I idiot. I just ran into a spy. At least I think I did.

162
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:50,789
Oh, we really, we're doing this well? Overtime?

163
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:56,940
I'll take that. Oh, jump over the

164
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,519
rocket. I just rocket jumped with his rocket. Right now it is 6pm.

165
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:09,369
Eastern time. Do I like streaming on Twitch or

166
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:15,460
YouTube? I think they both have their own little perks. For instance, I think more

167
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,460
people can watch a Twitch livestream because Twitch is available in

168
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,839
more areas. Yeah, Twitch is available

169
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:28,839
in more places. I think that the reason why people are having problems with this stream

170
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:32,839
is YouTube streams are not available all over the

171
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,839
place in the world. I'm pretty sure that's the problem people are having.

172
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:44,579
Is there no damage spread on this server? How did I not hit him?

173
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:53,480
Don't get yourself killed. Run away. Oh, come on.

174
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,509
No, get that scout.

175
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:05,140
Oh, what? What is...

176
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:13,400
Oh, I thought I died from the flamethrower. Arby's

177
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,400
corned beef. You know what? There is no Arby's around here. I wish there was

178
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,019
an Arby's around here. I'd go there every day. Those of you that have Arby's

179
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:26,019
near you, is it any good? I always see the commercials and I'm like, God, I want one of those

180
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:34,730
roast beef sandwiches. Spy...

181
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:42,039
Sure, why not. Mission begins in ten seconds.

182
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:47,940
Oh, that's fine. That's fine with me. I'll just bump into you.

183
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:53,319
I'll just bump into you. Look, I am heavy.

184
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:57,319
Oh my God, that's such baloney. That is

185
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:02,259
baloney. Slow mo that back. I backstabbed him.

186
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:10,759
Did we lose? What? How did it...

187
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:14,759
Hold on, did you guys hear that? It just said, you fail victory. What was that?

188
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:23,539
You fail victory.

189
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:29,049
I actually hit him. Hit me with that crit rocket.

190
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:36,470
Oh, get out of my way. Oh no, get out of my way.

191
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:42,740
Look, I'm a heavy. A sick minigun.

192
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:51,769
Oh, boink. Oh, come on, get me behind all

193
00:24:51,769 --> 00:25:00,920
these bastards. My gloves are running

194
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,920
urgently and I'm running wicked slow. That's not like a total giveaway.

195
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:11,140
You too. No, no, no more heavy disguise.

196
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:21,339
Oh, this guy's eating a sandwich.

197
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:27,349
Oh boy. Damn it. So Arby's really is terrible.

198
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:33,640
My processor, how many gigahertz is your processor? It is 3.6

199
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,940
gigahertz, I believe. It's overclocked. It is an overclocked

200
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:59,980
Intel i7950.

201
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:04,470
I'm a real engineer, don't worry. Oh, chaos stab.

202
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:18,250
Give me a chaos stab. Yeah, I do apologize if you're getting errors on here.

203
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,250
There's not a whole lot I can really do about it besides just not stream.

204
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:31,460
Come on, back up a little bit.

205
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:38,890
Damn. I got a GTX 470

206
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,619
NVIDIA. EVGA edition. I think that's also

207
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:48,250
clocked too. That's overclocked as well. I got a lot of overclocked

208
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:55,619
stuff. Not going to be good up here.

209
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:12,630
Get away, get away, get away, get away. Talking about like face

210
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,630
stabs, I still have not gotten a stair stab. Not once

211
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,630
in the entire time I've ever played Team Fortress 2. Never gotten a

212
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:25,259
Oh my god. A stair stab. Oh, now I did. Nope.

213
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:29,259
There's like 12 people in this hallway. How did I get killed?

214
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:43,900
Get that scalp, bastard. Oh, you're not

215
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:53,049
going to get away. Not going to get away. Let's go

216
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:59,579
I'm going to go sniper costume. Let's go sniper costume, baby.

217
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:04,650
Oh, I'm just sniping. Just sniping. Hold on, we got to like be careful

218
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,650
here. Like let me in the spawn. Let me in like the spawn door.

219
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:19,660
Damn it.

220
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:30,089
Run away, run away.

221
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:34,089
Oh no. That would have been my first stair stab ever.

222
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:39,609
Hey buddy. Damn it. That would have been my first stair stab ever.

223
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:47,859
I will get one of those damn things.

224
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:51,859
Damn. How did I not get that? I'm just going to

225
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:55,859
I'm going to get a stair stab. It's going to happen.

226
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:06,549
Today we're going to go stair stabbing.

227
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:11,990
I'll go heavy. We need a heavy. I'll go

228
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:16,230
Tommy Slav heavy. I got on the

229
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,230
Tommy Slav. What else do I got?

230
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,740
Crit Rocket. Damn. After this round

231
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,740
we're going to go to a new server. Get to a new empty server.

232
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:37,539
This is my heavy setup. Oh god, five seconds

233
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:43,900
left. Are we like losing or winning? I don't even remember. Oh, looks like we're winning.

234
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:54,329
Where's that guy coming from? We did it. Hooray.

235
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:59,130
I'll follow you to the depths of hell. Alright, new server.

236
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:11,740
The next server is going to be refresh. Oh,

237
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:19,589
stair stab with a heavy.

238
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:28,230
Let's go to

239
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,230
32. Here we go. Stop refresh. Gold Rush.

240
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,180
Control Point Kings. Looks like we're going to go here.

241
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:46,839
New server for stream.

242
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:56,170
Here you go. Putting it in the chat right now.

243
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:03,079
There it is. Everybody go there if you can make it.

244
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:08,410
I have not played Tribes of San Tony. I'm thinking about getting into it. Thinking about trying to get

245
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,220
into the open beta. I just really haven't had time to be honest.

246
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,529
I've been doing a whole lot of TV watching lately.

247
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:22,599
Plus I got that new dog and I've been kind of busy lately.

248
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:28,380
It's been tough to get into new games. At least the last week or so.

249
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:43,750
Let's go red. How can I keep getting defaulted

250
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:57,500
to the Pyro spray?

251
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:08,259
I love that. I want to do that too. Quick! No! Too late.

252
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:12,259
I'm going to play engineer. I'm going to play real engineer.

253
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:16,259
I'm going to be a weird engineer. Weird bastard.

254
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:20,890
Let's put it down. What's my pink?

255
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:29,720
I can see your comment. Help me build this Pyro. Thanks dude.

256
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:36,390
My opinion on the very controversial subject of bread.

257
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:40,390
Well, obviously bread is an incredibly, incredibly controversial

258
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,390
subject. I think that the best kind of bread

259
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:48,390
is wheat bread. But then of course the white bread will get really irritated

260
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,390
with that. And the rye bread might rise up and take over the wheat

261
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:56,390
country of Dylstalu. So I like to stay pretty neutral.

262
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:09,380
Bam! My brain just exploded right there.

263
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:17,529
What am I doing? I thought I was on offense for a second. Where the hell is

264
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:21,529
Shibby? Where is Shibby2142? Oh, he's probably working right now.

265
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:26,920
He's a real working man now.

266
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,099
Do we have six NGs? Oh my god.

267
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:35,980
Okay. Let's do it.

268
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,779
I'll help you with this at least. It's the least I can do.

269
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:44,950
Oh my god. Well, it looks like we crashed the server.

270
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:48,950
Don't worry everybody. We have every entrance secure.

271
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,950
All we need is one pointing down the stairs. And you're talking about hystericalness.

272
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:59,990
Oh my god. This server is laggy as hell.

273
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,990
Oh my god. Alright, I'm moving. I'm going down here.

274
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:09,190
I'm going right here. They don't even know I'm here either.

275
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:15,219
Excuse me, they have revenge crits. That's all I'm caring about right now. I'll change classes

276
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:20,789
after this. Oh, that's a spy. What?

277
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:26,380
What? What? What? Oh, it's cause every...

278
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,380
Oh my god. Look at these pinks.

279
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:36,139
Look at these pinks. Holy crap.

280
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:43,449
Oh, well it looks like we just broke this guy's server.

281
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:49,480
Hey, Mr. WLF. Sorry, but we

282
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:59,340
broke your server. Yeah, new server.

283
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,820
New server. Oh god.

284
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,820
Alright, time just to shoot people with a pistol until I die again and then I'm changing.

285
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:15,110
Oh, I'm going to go on a tirade. Yeah, new server. This place

286
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:20,820
is ridiculous. How about...

287
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:36,099
What is Casbah? Do another refresh. Yeah, somebody

288
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:40,099
in there had like 900 ping. Oh my god.

289
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:53,480
Forget that. There we go. We might have to go

290
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,480
into a 24 or a 30. Let's see, this one's 29.

291
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:04,460
We'll go to capture the flag well. Why not? More spots.

292
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:11,510
Alright, this is where we're going. This new server.

293
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:24,250
Here we are. Everyone head there. Hopefully this place doesn't

294
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:32,650
crash. Yeah, if you're getting the stream error, try closing

295
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,650
out your browser and clearing out your browser history

296
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,650
like your cache and all that and then try coming back in. That seems to have been

297
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:58,889
working for some people. Hot time!

298
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:10,980
I just wrote the IP. Oh, let me write

299
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:31,019
this. I don't think people can... Hold on. Let's try it.

300
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:36,280
I'm going to write this in the chat just because some people... There we go.

301
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:52,969
There we go. That didn't go through?

302
00:37:52,969 --> 00:38:05,460
Oh god, this server is like no better.

303
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:17,690
Yeah, I posted the IP earlier. That's a spy. I like the black box better

304
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:21,690
personally in my opinion. Oh my word!

305
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:26,760
I just think the black box is just... I don't know. Oh my god, by the damn

306
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,429
drain!

307
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:38,860
That was heinous.

308
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,860
Oh man, I've never done so many cartwheels in my life.

309
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:53,019
Geez. Give me that elf.

310
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:58,090
Oh, bird of prey mode. I'm going to drill here.

311
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:05,659
Damn. Mini-saturn.

312
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:16,070
The enemy has dropped our intelligence. Whoa, what was that?

313
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:20,820
I just heard a bunch of noise going on over there. You can't use your flames in

314
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:30,940
here. Whoa. Nice dispenser.

315
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:36,969
Yeah, screw that train. Now I'm not getting hit by the train again.

316
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:40,969
That would have been two in a row. That would have been two train travesties

317
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:51,079
in a row. I don't want to kill that medic.

318
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,900
I'm on fire now. Good for that water. Gotta get in the water.

319
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:02,630
Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Oh my god. Chaos.

320
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:10,309
Oh, I'm so dead.

321
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:18,070
Oh, I'm going to drown. I'm making a run for it. Let's go all the way

322
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:23,139
to the back of their base. Now they got a big sentry over here.

323
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:27,139
Oh, not that I can take it out. Oh! No! God! Why did I

324
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:32,280
crouch? Why did I crouch? Oh my god.

325
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,550
Oh, what the hell?

326
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:43,219
That was B-U.

327
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:48,300
You know the rest. L-L. Could have taken that thing out.

328
00:40:48,300 --> 00:41:00,380
Would I like to see TF3? I would love to see a TF3.

329
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,380
I don't think it'll ever happen though. I think they're kind of

330
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,380
going to stick with the community idea thing and let the community run with it and

331
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:14,969
I'm going to die. I'll play sniper. I'll play sniper with

332
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:20,679
the cozy camper. I got the coat. Let's see what it looks like. Yeah, see there it is.

333
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:31,449
Cozy camper. Are there really slot reservations here?

334
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:35,449
Oh, what am I doing? Why am I running in there like that? Oh, I got the cozy camper.

335
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:42,099
It doesn't even matter. I'm not going to flinch.

336
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:51,579
How am I missing this guy? Oh, how are they just

337
00:41:51,579 --> 00:42:00,920
running by us all? Come here, you bastard!

338
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,099
What new items would I like to see in TF? A...

339
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:11,320
What? Run! Run! No! My friend! Oh, come on.

340
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:21,050
Come over here. Oh, come on! That would have been sick.

341
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:26,309
No, get that! A weapon I like to see in TF is a

342
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:31,510
new engineer primary that's not a shotgun.

343
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:36,199
I guess they kind of already did that with the Pomsom.

344
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:40,199
But it's still technically a shotgun. I'd like to see a total

345
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:53,179
replacement for the shotgun. Damn.

346
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:58,760
We'll protect that medic. Damn. I got to put all the... I got to put the...

347
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,940
So is it true that this works? The cozy camper works with the huntsman?

348
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:14,139
Yeah, there's probably some bug in the YouTube streaming right now, to be honest.

349
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:18,139
Because there should not be double ads playing. That just should not

350
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:27,500
be happening. Hold on. Are you stuck in an infinite

351
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:46,489
ad? Infinite ad. Watch it. Ow.

352
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:54,059
So is the stream... Was it in your sub boxes, guys?

353
00:43:54,059 --> 00:44:07,750
I'm just wondering. Oh, that was sick.

354
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:17,820
Oh, lag. Because maybe that's another part of the problem.

355
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:23,980
I've had a couple people say that it's not. It wasn't in their subscription box.

356
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:30,650
Or it should have been. Oh, too many people attacking.

357
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:35,139
Oh, no. I don't know. I don't know what to do. Hold on. It is infinite

358
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:43,860
ads? Are you serious? Oh my god.

359
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:49,000
This is just a bug in the YouTube streaming. Definitely.

360
00:44:49,000 --> 00:45:01,289
Infinite ads. Give me a break.

361
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:09,670
Just reload the stream. I have to reload the

362
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:19,800
stream. Yeah, if you're getting infinite ads, if you get stuck in

363
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,420
an infinite ad, just reload the stream. YouTube.com.

364
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:40,099
The best website in the world.

365
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:45,539
Anybody get by the train? Damn it.

366
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:49,539
I can't see him. He's the flames are blocking him.

367
00:45:49,539 --> 00:46:06,820
Yeah, if you're getting infinite ads, definitely

368
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:10,820
just reload the stream. Or just come back. Because that's

369
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:15,000
stupid. That should absolutely not be happening.

370
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,010
Oh, add. Then add. Then add.

371
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:36,659
That's so dumb.

372
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:43,000
Oh, that medic is standing still.

373
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I didn't kill the medic? What did I kill? That was weird.

374
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:56,809
Oh, god. Oh, god. No. Why?

375
00:46:56,809 --> 00:47:12,360
Why? A wee by any car.

376
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,599
Who did I just kill? Can somebody in the

377
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:20,599
stream, right, that if you're getting like

378
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:24,599
just reload the browser, if you're getting an infinite ad, like two or three of you say it

379
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:28,599
because the chat is quite fast.

380
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:33,539
Because I wouldn't want someone just to sit there and be like, what is going on?

381
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:45,500
I got crits. Get that health.

382
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:57,539
No, no, no, no. Get out of the range. After this round I'm going to hop into some CSGO

383
00:47:57,539 --> 00:48:08,420
for a little bit. Should be interesting.

384
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:14,460
All the things you're seeing are

385
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,630
YouTube streaming bugs apparently. None of this happened last time.

386
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:29,190
Those of you that were here last time, I don't think I can

387
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:33,190
restart the stream. That's the problem. The thing with YouTube is once you start

388
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:37,190
you have to either stop and like remake an event or

389
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:41,190
I think it's weird like that. I've got a critscreek right now.

390
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:57,380
Oh, my god. I killed one person.

391
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,380
Infinite ads. Oh, my god. Well, I guess the one

392
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,380
possibly good thing is this thing will be watchable on YouTube.

393
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:14,619
Hopefully, unless there's more bugs. When do I predict

394
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:18,619
Oh, he's going to fish kill me. No, he's going to fish kill me. He's going to fish kill me.

395
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:23,800
He fish killed me.

396
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:37,059
Alright, we'll go with three more deaths and I'm going to hop on CSGO.

397
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:41,429
I'll see if there's something I can do on my end. I don't think there is unless

398
00:49:41,429 --> 00:49:45,429
I turn off the stream and then redo another live event.

399
00:49:45,429 --> 00:49:49,670
It takes a little while to set these up on YouTube.

400
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:59,099
YouTube bugs for the win. Damn, if I only lowered that a little bit.

401
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:07,619
Where are they getting these crits?

402
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:15,750
No, that wasn't the medic. What was that? You're going to be

403
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,750
rolling that bacon, buddy. I don't think so. Maybe I'll get like banned.

404
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,750
They're probably going to be like, oh, we saw that you loaded 25,000

405
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,750
bats. You cheated. When in reality, it's just like a bug

406
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:36,150
on this site. Yeah, CSGO is the new

407
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,650
Counter Strike. It's in beta. Alright, this is my last life.

408
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:49,480
Last life and I'm going to hop on CSGO. Where am I going? Where is this guy going?

409
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:56,460
Oh, another one. Oh no, that didn't count. One more life.

410
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:00,460
YouTube premium. Only $30 a day.

411
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:05,400
$30 a day.

412
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,340
That's more money than my data plan for my phone is in a

413
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:21,219
whole month. Oh, I got him to kill himself.

414
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:25,909
First infinite ad, second...wow. YouTube.

415
00:51:25,909 --> 00:51:30,539
Thank God for YouTube. And then not buggy site at all.

416
00:51:30,539 --> 00:51:35,860
It works perfectly every single time you want to use it.

417
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:45,909
How did I not hit him? Oh, alright. CSGO time.

418
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:49,909
Alright, I'm going to disconnect from here. Hold on a

419
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:54,090
second. Let's figure this out. What the hell is going on? I'm going to...I'm playing my

420
00:51:54,090 --> 00:52:01,900
own stream. Here we go. See what happens.

421
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:07,539
I'm watching...okay, here's an ad. Let's see what happens after this ad.

422
00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:15,880
Alright, what do you got for me? You're going to give me like another ad? What do you

423
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:22,300
got? Oh, look! Another ad! Are you serious?

424
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:28,380
Wow. Alright.

425
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:35,429
Yeah, this is stupid. Oh my God, YouTube.

426
00:52:35,429 --> 00:52:42,789
Oh, wait! It worked! Okay. I got two.

427
00:52:42,789 --> 00:52:47,929
Oh, thank God for YouTube. Alright.

428
00:52:47,929 --> 00:52:53,059
Can I like...hold on. Let me go to my video manager for a second.

429
00:52:53,059 --> 00:52:59,989
I'm just going to turn off all the ads now. See if I can even do that.

430
00:52:59,989 --> 00:53:05,769
Event dashboard. No, the stream is in good health.

431
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:15,690
Sure it is. Oh, sure it is. I don't understand.

432
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:19,690
See, there's like nothing...I have to turn off the stream.

433
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:29,739
Dumb. Alright, well, your stream is in good health.

434
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:39,460
Apparently not. Yeah, if you're still having the ad problem

435
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,460
or if you're just barely getting back from it, I apologize. That is not what was supposed

436
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:49,239
to be happening. Hold on a second. Yeah, see like the only thing I can do

437
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:53,239
is just like stop broadcasting. Which will turn off everything.

438
00:53:53,239 --> 00:54:00,489
And then I have to like reset up a new event. Well, it should go

439
00:54:00,489 --> 00:54:04,659
right to YouTube. This should be uploaded to YouTube without any BS.

440
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:15,739
So, I do apologize though. Let's go to

441
00:54:15,739 --> 00:54:24,809
Counter-Strike Go. Oh, right.

442
00:54:24,809 --> 00:54:32,420
The screen is going to go black while I load up Counter-Strike Go.

443
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:38,139
Counter-Strike Global Offensive. Hold on. Bear with me for

444
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:44,730
a second. Remove. Add. CS Go.

445
00:54:44,730 --> 00:55:00,579
Okay. So, Counter-Strike

446
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:07,380
Go is all of a sudden 2,000 people quit the stream.

447
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:11,380
I wouldn't blame them, man. That's stupid. That's annoying. If I was just sitting there

448
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:15,380
wanting to watch a livestream and it was like, oh, here you go. Here's like 15 ads

449
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:19,880
right next to each other in a row. I'd be pissed off too. That's stupid.

450
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:26,099
How did I get a beta key? From a really

451
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:30,280
cool dude. His name, he just wants to, he wants to go by Anonymous.

452
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:34,280
If he's in the stream, if you're in the stream, Anonymous, then thank you so much. You are

453
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:43,179
amazing. Alright. It looks like we're on, what map are we even on?

454
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:49,059
I gotta buy stuff. Pistols, let's go with the

455
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:56,219
Deagle. Do I have enough money for that? I do.

456
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:06,980
Alright, let's do it. How much is CS Go? It's not out yet. I gotta turn,

457
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:13,340
my sensitivity is way too high on this. Gotta change that.

458
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:17,940
Oh, god. Oh, unsensitivity. Keyboard and mouse.

459
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:26,260
Mouse sensitivity, come down. There we go. Audio.

460
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:30,820
Bring the audio down. Resume.

461
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:40,869
Alright, we lost. Alright, that's much better. Dual Berettas, baby.

462
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:50,619
I need to start saving money. What am I doing?

463
00:56:50,619 --> 00:57:01,300
Click, click. D-Dust is dustier.

464
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:05,300
It's alright, I just unloaded a clip on you. Whoa, they take a long time

465
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:14,780
to reload. These things take a long time to reload. Bang.

466
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:22,309
Bang. I actually like these. I'm gonna keep

467
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:27,579
these. Let's get a, how much money do I have? Kevlar and helmet.

468
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:55,800
I'm gonna stick with these. I'm good with these.

469
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:05,849
Long range pistol attack. Let's get up there. Oh, god.

470
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:10,599
What am I doing? What did I just pick up? I didn't want that. What was up with that?

471
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:18,659
I didn't want to pick up that weapon. That was BS.

472
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:23,289
Is that the P90? Or the PPM, whatever it is? Let's watch this guy.

473
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:27,289
Let's see how good this guy is. Oh, you just got smashed.

474
00:58:27,289 --> 00:58:37,849
You just got smashed. I think this is coming out in

475
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:42,150
a couple months maybe? I don't know. There's no release date for it yet. It's in beta.

476
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:52,760
Let's go PP. Check the PP out.

477
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,760
If I get one car for free, I would want the most expensive car you could ever bake.

478
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,760
I would want like a Lamborghini or like a Bentley. Give me like the

479
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,760
absolute most expensive car you can buy and then like, then I'll just resell it.

480
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:10,150
Oh, drop zone. Damn. I got one guy. I got

481
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:17,019
one guy.

482
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:24,500
Abyss Lord.

483
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:30,789
Am I like, what's going on? Why is this guy just like sitting here? Is this guy camping with a

484
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:38,659
deagle? How you get a copy of this isn't it?

485
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:42,659
You have to go to, you have to take Valve's survey.

486
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:49,139
They have like a CSGO survey. Oh, the FAMAS and

487
00:59:49,139 --> 00:59:55,369
Kevlar and Hellman. I've been invited to join the group. Kills free gaming.

488
00:59:55,369 --> 01:00:01,400
So is this a burst? This is a lot different than it is in Call of Duty, I'm assuming.

489
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:13,699
Where is this guy? He's down there. Oh, no.

490
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:22,519
No, no, no, no. Run away. Ah, I almost got that guy.

491
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:27,780
He's right there. Ah, damn it.

492
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:32,730
Boston's good. Boston is good. I like it.

493
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:39,900
It's kind of cold out here now though. The survey is

494
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:43,900
if you just type into Google, type in like Conner Strike

495
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,900
Go Beta Survey. I'm sure it'll come up. It'll be on a Valve website or Conner Strike

496
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:53,670
website. I think you can do it through Steam as well.

497
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:57,909
Maybe they aren't even doing it anymore. I'm not sure if anybody knows.

498
01:00:57,909 --> 01:01:04,440
Where is the, is it the MP7? The one from

499
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,440
Conner Strike, the original, that I like? I think it might be. I forget.

500
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:20,869
Oh yeah, they're not even close. Two totally different games. I'm gonna go this way.

501
01:01:20,869 --> 01:01:28,809
I had more luck going this way before. Oh lord.

502
01:01:28,809 --> 01:01:39,110
I'm gonna get flashed. I am gonna get flashed.

503
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:46,679
Damn, how did I not get that guy? Come on, that's ridiculous.

504
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:50,679
That is redonkulous. I'm gonna turn my

505
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:54,679
heat seeking missile thing up, or black screen for a second.

506
01:01:54,679 --> 01:02:02,420
Resume game. The beta ends probably when the game comes out.

507
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:09,980
A scout asks for a dispenser. Will you give him one?

508
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,980
Actually the questions were kind of weird. It was like,

509
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:18,219
let me ask you something. What does more damage in a round? The M4A1

510
01:02:18,219 --> 01:02:22,219
or the AK-47? Which one do you think is more powerful?

511
01:02:22,219 --> 01:02:26,219
They ask you like actual real questions about it, so. That's not how

512
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:31,860
I got into it though. I got, somebody gave me a beta key. I'm gonna go, let's go Terracid.

513
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:39,179
Would I buy a Ferrari? If I had the money

514
01:02:39,179 --> 01:02:44,380
like to just throw away, I absolutely would. Go to

515
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:55,769
Berettas. Oh! Yeah, I need to buy a frag.

516
01:02:55,769 --> 01:03:05,690
What am I doing? I'm like not buying anything. Oh, they're behind us too.

517
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:10,699
Yikes! I'm gonna go around this way. I'm gonna surprise this bastard.

518
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:15,940
Can I even go around this way? I don't think so. I would love

519
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:29,719
to hear a joke. Who the hell is everybody? There's only two guys left on the team. There's one.

520
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:35,300
Oh! I just totally gave myself away.

521
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:41,139
Oh my god, what an idiot I am. I'm so

522
01:03:41,139 --> 01:03:49,349
stupid. Firing around in the air with dual pistols equals

523
01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:54,360
MLG Pro. Yeah, I wanna buy, I wanna get a rifleman.

524
01:03:54,360 --> 01:04:00,809
Oh, that guy. That guy's unloaded. Oh, you're taking

525
01:04:00,809 --> 01:04:06,969
the survey now? Good, good. I love potatoes. They are unbelievable.

526
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:13,880
Alright, let me get a, what do we got for heavy?

527
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:20,730
Lenovo. This thing is 5200 bucks, oh my god.

528
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:24,900
The Galil, okay. We'll take out the Galil. Nah, I want a grenade.

529
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,079
I want a Molotov. We're doing Molotov right now. How do I

530
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:33,079
switch to it? Is it, what is it, three? Oh, it's four. Okay, four.

531
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:41,460
I'm gonna throw it down the hall. Let's throw this down here.

532
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:46,260
Molotov out!

533
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:52,019
Whoops. Hey, oh, sorry, I just like totally ruined everything, teammate.

534
01:04:52,019 --> 01:04:58,059
I apologize for that. I thought there was a guy right there next to him. Oh my

535
01:04:58,059 --> 01:05:05,929
god. Oh my god, no. Ah, huh.

536
01:05:05,929 --> 01:05:15,099
Mr. Cammie, I'll say your name. Counter-terrorists win.

537
01:05:15,099 --> 01:05:24,440
I lost all my money. Hmm. I want something with

538
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:29,130
like a, this thing's got the highest fire rate, huh? None of these are that accurate.

539
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:35,139
This thing, oh, it's a sniper. Oh, the AWP is

540
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:45,079
back. I'll go with the Galil. I like the Galil.

541
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:50,539
I need some more money. I gotta start killing people. Not like running around like an idiot.

542
01:05:50,539 --> 01:05:58,679
Alright, this is where the action is. Oh my,

543
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:04,260
oh, I knew it. Why did I go around so carelessly?

544
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:08,260
If I had a frag grenade or if I had a Molotov, that would have been game over.

545
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:18,570
Super Taco, well, I'm glad to be your hero. If there's

546
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:22,570
anything I can do to protect this country and this world, I will do it.

547
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:32,619
This guy is, this guy is so dead.

548
01:06:32,619 --> 01:06:37,179
He had the right idea right there.

549
01:06:37,179 --> 01:06:43,320
Leprechauns. Oh, come on, pull it off. Oh!

550
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:50,340
Oh, damn. Look at that.

551
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:56,820
He ended up, he pulled it off. I bet you I will see that comment, TheAwesome.

552
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:04,250
I bet you I will. Alright, I want to go, I don't want the

553
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:12,420
shotgun. Let's go with the 5.7. Kelvlar

554
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:18,139
and I want high explosive grenade.

555
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:26,579
Alright, I'm not messing around anymore here. Read the word

556
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:31,400
in Arabic? What word are you talking about? Alright, this is the

557
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:37,179
magic, magic area. Boom, get blown.

558
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:49,239
Damn, don't breathe in. Damn.

559
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:53,239
Reflex just like a cat, baby. I'll take your, I'll take your

560
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:59,320
PM290, whatever it is. Ah! Every time I start

561
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:04,139
talking, I'm like, I just get annihilated.

562
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:08,699
Alright, I'm definitely buying that again. Cause that's like, I did good with that.

563
01:08:08,699 --> 01:08:16,699
And I want, I'll take a flashbang. You can buy more than

564
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:22,729
one grenade, I think. I don't know why I'm only buying one or two. Be

565
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:27,220
prepared. What's that from? 15 German

566
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:31,220
points, what's that from? Be prepared.

567
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:39,029
Get flashed. I just flashed myself.

568
01:08:39,029 --> 01:08:43,029
Oh,

569
01:08:43,029 --> 01:08:49,260
what an imbecile. I'll take you down too, where are you at, buddy?

570
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:54,890
Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.

571
01:08:54,890 --> 01:09:01,100
MLG Glock. I like this gun.

572
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:07,899
I need to start to stop being a turd and like, do well.

573
01:09:07,899 --> 01:09:13,479
And grenades. I'm gonna go with another Molotov and a high explosive

574
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:18,039
grenade. I'm gonna have two different grenades. We'll go with the Molotov

575
01:09:18,039 --> 01:09:24,329
first. That's right, Lion King. Lion King, you all get it.

576
01:09:24,329 --> 01:09:29,899
Molotov, baby, what do you say? Let's light it up.

577
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:33,899
Light it up, baby. What just happened? Oh god, oh my god, no.

578
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:37,899
No. Oh god, this guy's so mad.

579
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:41,899
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

580
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:45,899
I'm so sorry. I just killed all my teammates. Oh my god.

581
01:09:55,859 --> 01:10:03,670
Damn it. Damn it, damn it, damn it.

582
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:08,039
This guy is so mad. I have my voice turned off.

583
01:10:08,039 --> 01:10:12,039
But that guy was definitely screaming at me.

584
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:21,079
I can guarantee you that. Is this a scope?

585
01:10:21,079 --> 01:10:29,590
It is. Ooh, I think I might like this thing.

586
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:36,899
Alright, this time I'm not gonna flashbang myself.

587
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:46,619
Oh, for the love of god. Damn.

588
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:51,500
Be prepared. Jerma, why was there fruit punch on the floor?

589
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:55,500
I don't know. People need to stop eating so much fruit punch.

590
01:10:55,500 --> 01:11:00,310
Well, that guy just totally, this guy Killroy just killed the entire team.

591
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:07,289
He legit just killed every single person. I gotta start using

592
01:11:07,289 --> 01:11:11,289
the SMGs. I am absolutely not one of those guys that can sit

593
01:11:11,289 --> 01:11:15,289
back and do well by aiming. I just need to go like this.

594
01:11:19,289 --> 01:11:23,289
Oh, shit. This guy is so, oh, he's a bot.

595
01:11:23,289 --> 01:11:29,050
Okay, nevermind, he's a bot. And these are all bots?

596
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:37,960
How come my team has the bots? Alright, let's go. Spray and pray, baby.

597
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:52,739
Oh my god, how much does it take to kill the guy? What just happened?

598
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:59,140
Where was that guy? What in the name of god?

599
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:07,319
I can, can I really? That's pretty cool.

600
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:11,750
Alright, I'm just, I'm going with just straight up, I want money. Should I? I got money.

601
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:18,010
What about the shotgun? I'm gonna use the shotgun. Just because

602
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:22,949
I feel like it. I did play CS Source. I played 1.6.

603
01:12:22,949 --> 01:12:28,090
I wasn't really that good at it though. My brother was really good.

604
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:32,090
My older brother was really good at Counter-Strike.

605
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:39,850
Me, not so much. Let me get somebody to just play.

606
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:44,520
I was trolling for a headshot.

607
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:51,109
Damn it. That guy's good.

608
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:57,449
It's not fair. That guy's like too good at this game. I was using the shotgun.

609
01:12:57,449 --> 01:13:05,770
That guy killed Roy. I want to get on his team.

610
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:09,770
I'm 4 and 9 right now. How, wow, I'm doing the best

611
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:14,569
on this team? No way. I want to, what's the most expensive

612
01:13:14,569 --> 01:13:19,689
one? MP7. And grenades.

613
01:13:19,689 --> 01:13:24,949
High explosive grenade. And I want a Molotov. Can you put a silencer

614
01:13:24,949 --> 01:13:30,859
on stuff too? Isn't that possible? Alright, this time I'm not going to light

615
01:13:30,859 --> 01:13:38,489
the entire team on fire. I promise. I have played some MMOs. I played

616
01:13:38,489 --> 01:13:43,500
World of Warcraft for so long.

617
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:47,500
How am I, I can't believe I didn't kill that guy. That headshot of me.

618
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:51,500
How did I not land one shot on him? That is

619
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:56,630
ridiculous in my opinion. Ridiculous.

620
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:02,020
Unless he's like aimbotting. No, he's definitely not.

621
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:12,460
He's just really good. I'm 4 and 10. Oh, if you die

622
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,819
one more time, you need to eat an egg.

623
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:20,819
I had the most success, to be totally honest, with the

624
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:26,090
5.7. Kevlar. Forget about the stupid

625
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:31,539
grenades. One Molotov. Let's go. I've

626
01:14:31,539 --> 01:14:42,439
only killed people with this weapon. Alright, let's get some area denial down there.

627
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:51,340
I didn't want this. I didn't want this. I didn't want

628
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:55,340
that weapon. Dude, this guy Kilroy, seriously, is just like

629
01:14:55,340 --> 01:15:03,220
destroying everybody. Kilroy.

630
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:08,810
Look at my team and look at their team. Look at how many pros

631
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:12,810
are on their team. Look at how many scrubs are on my team, including me.

632
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:19,659
You've got the ultimate scrub, which is me. And then like two of those guys

633
01:15:19,659 --> 01:15:23,659
are like 8 and 2 KDR.

634
01:15:23,659 --> 01:15:33,079
Alright, I'll definitely do that next time, CN. I'll take control

635
01:15:33,079 --> 01:15:38,859
of one of these bot bastards. Oh god.

636
01:15:38,859 --> 01:15:49,819
Hey, white screen. Watch out, watch out. Get out of my way.

637
01:15:49,819 --> 01:15:55,960
I'm so dead. I'm going this way.

638
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:05,289
Wow, we won. Cool. I shot like five people.

639
01:16:05,289 --> 01:16:11,640
An awesome pro 360 controller user.

640
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:18,229
I already got the Glock. No, the

641
01:16:18,229 --> 01:16:23,430
R7, sorry. Let's do it. Oh, max

642
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:36,489
out the pistol ammo. Okay, let's go.

643
01:16:36,489 --> 01:16:43,739
There's going to be somebody right here and I'm going to get frigging headshotted.

644
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:48,420
And right here. That Kilroy, god damn it, headshot.

645
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:52,659
Range quit. I'm going in a different lobby.

646
01:16:52,659 --> 01:16:58,060
I'm going somewhere else. Watch me get put right into the same game.

647
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:03,640
Oh, let's go right into the same game with freaking

648
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,640
Kilroy, the guy with 40 kills and like three deaths.

649
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:17,050
Yeah, I'm going to get my first Moab in this game.

650
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:25,699
Why am I not making commentaries about CS? I just got it.

651
01:17:25,699 --> 01:17:32,180
I just got it. I got CS go

652
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:37,000
probably three or four days ago. Alright, good. Good. This is a

653
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,300
new lobby. Oh, new map too. Very cool.

654
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:54,039
New map. No, this is Italy, right? This is CS Italy.

655
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:58,340
Hi, Mexican Koala. How are you? Good to see you.

656
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:10,550
Need backup. I'm going this way. There we go.

657
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:16,199
Let's clear this place out, gentlemen. Well, that's how you

658
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:22,409
win. That's how you win. Alright, I got one.

659
01:18:22,409 --> 01:18:32,470
That's 24 away from a Moab.

660
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:36,470
Yeah, I don't know when the TF2 update is going to come out, to be honest. I'm not sure.

661
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:40,970
They've already started rolling out some changes, so probably in the

662
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:45,460
near future. I'd say in the next, probably in the next couple weeks

663
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:50,600
you'll probably see some more stuff in TF2. Hopefully, at least.

664
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,600
There's going to be a bunch of people around this corner. Oh, right there. This guy.

665
01:18:54,600 --> 01:19:00,630
If only my reactions were better and I didn't think

666
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:06,649
that was a teammate. I use a Razor Death Adder.

667
01:19:06,649 --> 01:19:11,590
That's the mouse I use. Oh, take control of the bot. Oh, hey,

668
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:19,979
what's up, hostages? Oh, no.

669
01:19:19,979 --> 01:19:27,420
I got the hostages. What do we do?

670
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:33,189
Those poor hostages. Oh, apparently my stream is

671
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:40,890
just starting. That makes perfect sense. Oh, get away from me.

672
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:48,250
I got one. Oh, my God. Look at all this fruit punch.

673
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:53,180
Something happened here. He's right there. He's right

674
01:19:53,180 --> 01:20:03,720
there. Oh, Wayne.

675
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:08,659
We lost. Oh, that's right. I got my kills when I took control of

676
01:20:08,659 --> 01:20:14,420
bots. Whoops. Oh, we're going to do some sniping.

677
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:21,029
We're going to do some straight up legit sniping. Oh, yeah, this is going to be

678
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:30,380
sick. Hell, yeah. Why did the chicken cross the road?

679
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:34,739
To go meet his family for supper.

680
01:20:34,739 --> 01:20:52,899
Oh, bastard. How am I not hitting you?

681
01:20:52,899 --> 01:20:59,899
Oh, quick scope. What? What? I was going to say,

682
01:20:59,899 --> 01:21:06,310
how did I miss that? That was going to be like, oh, I just die.

683
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:10,310
I go walk up five feet away from you. Actually, this guy over here.

684
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:22,220
Where is he? Oh, get

685
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:27,670
get dominated. Anybody else? There's two more

686
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:32,859
guys. No, no,

687
01:21:32,859 --> 01:21:41,300
no, no, no. Shoot. Come on, come around the corner.

688
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:49,300
Where's he going? That scares me. Where'd he go? Where is

689
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:57,239
that dude? Where the hell is he? Oh, it's what?

690
01:21:57,239 --> 01:22:04,220
What the hell was going on? He was just sitting there?

691
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:13,300
You bot. All right, we'll do another two or three

692
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:21,619
rounds. I want to buy... Let's go with

693
01:22:21,619 --> 01:22:26,680
the PP. And I didn't buy the Kevlar. What am I thinking?

694
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:37,819
Kevlar best. Oh, look at that fire rate.

695
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:41,819
To get a MOAB, I got to kill more than like one person in a row.

696
01:22:41,819 --> 01:22:51,539
Two of them. Two of them. That's ridiculous.

697
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:55,909
I can't believe I didn't kill him. That's ridiculous.

698
01:22:55,909 --> 01:23:00,279
I got a GTX 470 from a video. That's the video card I got.

699
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:08,390
Desert Eagle. Kevlar and helmet.

700
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:14,739
And a high explosive. Oh, yeah. All right, this

701
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:18,739
probably would be the last round before I end the stream, because I want to go back and look and see

702
01:23:18,739 --> 01:23:22,920
what was going on. See what kind of errors were happening. This will be

703
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,920
on YouTube if you just came, if you missed the beginning.

704
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:33,829
Oh, give me the whole line of people.

705
01:23:33,829 --> 01:23:37,829
Oh my god. I didn't kill the whole line. I just killed like four people right there.

706
01:23:37,829 --> 01:23:45,380
Oh, look at that. Ammo conservation. I was just

707
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:49,380
aiming down there, aiming near heads, and I just killed everybody. But yeah, this is going to be

708
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:53,380
uploaded to YouTube, so if you missed it, or if you couldn't watch

709
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:57,380
it or something like that, this will be in your sub box as a watchable

710
01:23:57,380 --> 01:24:09,029
just straight through video. At least I hope it will. Have I

711
01:24:09,029 --> 01:24:15,699
used this gun yet? I don't know. I'm going to go up here. I'm going to go up the log

712
01:24:15,699 --> 01:24:27,180
cabin. Oh, never mind. No, I'm not. It's too much work to do.

713
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:31,180
This guy stopped talking? Listen to me. He's like, got another flare,

714
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:35,180
hostages situation. Got it. Yep. Roger.

715
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:42,600
Oh my. I don't even know how that, I don't even know how

716
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:47,659
that happened. I don't even know how that happened. I want to watch

717
01:24:47,659 --> 01:24:52,279
that again, because I had a Kevlar...

718
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:59,260
I don't understand. I don't get it. I'll take control of you,

719
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:03,859
buddy. Alright. Alright, hostages.

720
01:25:03,859 --> 01:25:07,859
Let's talk business. What do you know about the operation?

721
01:25:07,859 --> 01:25:11,859
Too late, you didn't answer fast enough. What about you?

722
01:25:11,859 --> 01:25:15,859
You like seeing your friend get shot like that? What do you know about the organization X?

723
01:25:15,859 --> 01:25:19,859
Oh, I don't know. I'm so scared, please just let me get... That's not the

724
01:25:19,859 --> 01:25:27,369
right answer. Oh, they rescued them.

725
01:25:27,369 --> 01:25:32,250
It's alright.

726
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:37,560
Don't ask me

727
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:45,369
how that happened. I don't understand. I don't understand.

728
01:25:45,369 --> 01:25:49,369
Oh, this is the Og. I didn't even see this. I used to love

729
01:25:49,369 --> 01:25:58,659
the Og. The Og. A-U-G.

730
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:16,460
The Oggy. Come on, show yourself. Another here.

731
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:22,810
Get out of my way. Get out of here.

732
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:27,239
What am I doing? What are you doing? You're a bot. You listen to me.

733
01:26:27,239 --> 01:26:34,420
I can't kill him.

734
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:41,859
Oh, look. I'm going to be the only one left. What's going on, random vids?

735
01:26:41,859 --> 01:26:48,659
I was going to shoot the chicken. I was going to shoot the chicken.

736
01:26:48,659 --> 01:26:56,420
How come these are all just bots? I just went to quick

737
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:01,819
match. It's not like I said, please play with bots only.

738
01:27:01,819 --> 01:27:10,710
I just went into quick match. I don't understand.

739
01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:15,380
I kind of want to just die. Ready? Oh, this is going to be funny.

740
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:21,220
Do any of those guys have grenades?

741
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:25,850
I hope they do. I just went so high.

742
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:31,239
Alright, let's see. I want this guy. Where are the hostages?

743
01:27:31,239 --> 01:27:42,180
Where are the hostages? Oh my god, the entire team is right

744
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:48,020
there.

745
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:52,020
Come on. Ah, damn it. Alright, guys.

746
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:56,899
That's enough for me. See, watch. Ready? Exit to main menu. I went to

747
01:27:56,899 --> 01:28:00,899
quick match. Did I do quick match or create a game? I think I just did quick match.

748
01:28:00,899 --> 01:28:05,899
I don't know. But yeah.

749
01:28:05,899 --> 01:28:10,390
Thanks everybody for coming. If you missed it or if you

750
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:14,390
were having problems with the stream earlier, this should all be uploaded to

751
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:18,390
YouTube so you can watch the whole stream if you want from beginning to end.

752
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:22,760
Thank you guys for watching. And I do apologize. I'm sorry for

753
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:27,130
the shenanigans that happened earlier.

754
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:31,130
I don't even know what was happening. Everyone was getting like 50 ads in a row.

755
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:35,130
That's not how it was set up. I apologize if you were having

756
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:39,130
problems. But yeah, thank you guys so much. I'll talk to you guys soon.

757
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:43,430
And take care everybody. Next stream is going to be next

758
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:47,800
Saturday probably. Or, you know, I might do one during the week. I'm not sure yet.

759
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:52,470
I don't know. I'm not sure. I assume

760
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:56,470
that I'll probably do one, if not this coming Saturday at six,

761
01:28:56,470 --> 01:29:01,100
then probably like Thursday

762
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:09,560
or Wednesday, something like that, if I end up doing a midweek one. But I will check you

763
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:13,560
guys soon. Thank you everybody. Goodbye. See ya.

764
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:19,000
Actually, how do I turn it off? I don't even know how to

765
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,460
turn off my YouTube stream. Hold on.

766
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:29,340
I can't stop streaming.

767
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:34,409
Oh, let me just go to YouTube.com. What if it was just locked forever?

768
01:29:34,409 --> 01:29:38,409
Like, oh sorry, you're stuck on YouTube for the rest of your life.

769
01:29:38,409 --> 01:29:44,229
What is going on? Why can't I? Oh, I gotta open up a new tab.

770
01:29:44,229 --> 01:29:52,600
Here we go. Okay. Here we go. There it is.

771
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:56,600
Alright, yep. Thank you guys. See you soon. Take care everybody.
