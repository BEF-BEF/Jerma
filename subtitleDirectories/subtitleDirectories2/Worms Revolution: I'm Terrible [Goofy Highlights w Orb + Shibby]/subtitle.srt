1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,189
Is that mine? Nah, that's Shibby's.

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:05,190
Oh, he's dropping it on Phat.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,500
Oh, 3, 2, 1.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,570
How do you see damage?

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,570
Hopefully Phat doesn't die first.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,660
Wait, where am I?

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,660
Who did I even select? What? I didn't want this guy.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,660
You don't get to pick. It's random.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,660
Oh, it's random.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,020
Alright, well you want a dynamite?

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,020
You see what happens right now.

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,259
5 seconds, Jerome.

13
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:40,259
Make him poop, bro.

14
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,439
I didn't even know what was happening.

15
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,439
Oh, the panic.

16
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,439
The 20 seconds isn't long enough.

17
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,439
It needs to be like 30.

18
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:58,649
Charlize Theron.

19
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,649
Charlize Theron, if I may.

20
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,650
I just butchered that name.

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,650
Charlize Theron.

22
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,650
Hey, don't shoot the wall.

23
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,719
Why are you shooting just me?

24
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,900
Chew up, son.

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,900
Oh my, you're dead.

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,260
Jerome is dead.

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,260
That was a bunch of BS right there.

28
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,260
Charlize Theron.

29
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,260
Fucking Jerome.

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,260
I'm so done.

31
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,060
Oh, by the way, for those of you wondering,

32
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,060
Orb is yellow, Shibby is blue,

33
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,060
and I'm red. If anyone is confused

34
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,060
right now.

35
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,060
I'm confused too.

36
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,430
You only have 3 seconds. Look at all...

37
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:57,959
No!

38
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,140
What the hell?

39
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,140
Come on, son.

40
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,700
Get some.

41
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:13,210
No!

42
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,210
What the hell?

43
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,509
Come on, son.

44
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:19,509
Get some.

45
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,750
No, you gotta get the crates.

46
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,750
Where's Puke? Oh, that crate is mine.

47
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,990
What is it?

48
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,990
10 coins? Oh, great. Thanks.

49
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,990
I only have 10 seconds.

50
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,229
How do you jump?

51
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,050
Get me out of here.

52
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,050
I don't know how to jump.

53
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,050
Worst player, NA.

54
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,800
How do you jump?

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,349
Oh, shit.

56
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:02,729
8, 7...

57
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:04,729
Dragon Ball.

58
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,159
Get Dragon Balled.

59
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,159
That was the...

60
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:12,039
Oh, great. That sucked.

61
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:14,039
Did I just do like 10 damage to you?

62
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,039
That was weird.

63
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,039
Oh, am I gonna spawn down there?

64
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,039
Oh, this is gonna be perfect.

65
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,039
I just have to figure out what do we have.

66
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,039
Dude, baseball bat me like a boss.

67
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,560
Who has the girl voice pack?

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,819
I'm using the Australian person.

69
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,879
What is this? I don't like what I see.

70
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,879
Oh, nice.

71
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,949
Nice job.

72
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:42,949
That was perfect.

73
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:44,949
GG.

74
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:46,949
Why?

75
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:48,949
Why are you getting all this free stuff up there?

76
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:50,949
This is the DLC bullshit that I talked about.

77
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:52,949
This is what he gets for the DLC.

78
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,949
MLG grandpa up in the top right.

79
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,949
Oh, what's this? Oh, what's this turret?

80
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:58,949
What's going on here?

81
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,949
What?

82
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,949
What the fuck?

83
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,949
My turret.

84
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,949
That is the best shit I've ever seen.

85
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:10,860
That's not gonna be good.

86
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,860
I don't know what all my options are.

87
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,860
You're gonna kill yourself.

88
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,860
Oh, shit.

89
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,860
The sheep, that's gonna kill you.

90
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
Oh, my God.

91
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,860
I don't know what's going on here.

92
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,860
You have to detonate it.

93
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,899
I think you have to detonate that.

94
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:32,899
Oh, shit.

95
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:34,899
Oh, shit.

96
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,899
Why did I tell him that?

97
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,860
I should have left him in the dock.

98
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,860
Well, I'm going to lose this match.

99
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,860
I think I'm going to win.

100
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,860
I think it's going against Orbeez here.

101
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,220
I'm sorry, Jerome.

102
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,779
You know who to shoot out here, Jerome.

103
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:53,779
Yeah, I know.

104
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,779
I know what I'm doing.

105
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,779
I know exactly what I'm doing right now.

106
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:59,779
What is this?

107
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,779
No, what are you doing?

108
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,779
Oh, shit.

109
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,779
Good choice.

110
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,779
Oh, shit.

111
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:10,089
No.

112
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:12,089
Oh, shit.

113
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:14,649
What?

114
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,649
I just killed myself.

115
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,649
Was that a cluster bomb?

116
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,649
It was a cluster bomb, but I'm an idiot and I threw it incorrectly.

117
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:23,639
I will get to you eventually, Chibi.

118
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,779
No.

119
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,779
Nice nosc, brah.

120
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:31,399
Oh, wow.

121
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,399
Wow, that was a perfect shot.

122
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,399
That aim, though.

123
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,399
That aim.

124
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,399
How did you get that right?

125
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,399
I don't know how you did that.

126
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,470
That is FPS aim right there, fellas.

127
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,470
Can I call upon the power of the rats in the background to come eat your faces?

128
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,350
No.

129
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,350
That would have been so funny if you had fell down.

130
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,350
Funny because you would have died.

131
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,350
That would have been so funny because you would have died.

132
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,350
It sounds so horrible.

133
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,350
Jump rope.

134
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,620
Oh, only a minute and 46 seconds.

135
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,620
Oh, you fall.

136
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,069
Hey.

137
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,069
Orb is going to win by default.

138
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,069
Only a minute and 15 seconds left.

139
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,069
You gotta do more damage to him, Jerem.

140
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,069
I can't.

141
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:18,069
Oh, no.

142
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:20,069
Yes, yes.

143
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:22,069
Get it, get it, get it.

144
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,569
Yes.

145
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:26,740
All right, here we go.

146
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,740
We got a game.

147
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,740
Get out.

148
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,740
It was worth it.

149
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,740
We are never playing this again.

150
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,740
It raises the water level, I forgot.

151
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,740
Oh, all right, so it keeps going.

152
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,740
I didn't mess up that cluster.

153
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,740
Go, go, go, go, go.

154
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
This is going to be it right here.

155
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,879
Oh, it screws it up.

156
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,529
Hold on, I got this.

157
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,529
Oh, yes.

158
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:56,410
Yes, yes.

159
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,410
Oh, you're so boned.

160
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,410
Oh, you're so boned.

161
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,410
Oh, dude.

162
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,410
If you draw, no.

163
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,410
Seriously, seriously.

164
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,410
That's no way. The game is glitched.

165
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,410
Rick, tweet somebody.

166
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,709
Tweet somebody.

167
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:15,269
No way.

168
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,899
No way.

169
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,899
Where's my cursor?

170
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,899
I cannot lose this.

171
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,899
Where's my cursor?

172
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:25,899
I'm waiting for players right now.

173
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:30,170
Where's my move?

174
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,170
This is going to be it.

175
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,170
I think you're going to both bounce back into the water.

176
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,170
It might not, though. The explosion is not that powerful.

177
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,170
Oh, my God.

178
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,170
Oh, that's it.

179
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,170
That's it.

180
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,170
Oh, my God.

181
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,540
Yes, thank you.

182
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,540
I can't believe it.
