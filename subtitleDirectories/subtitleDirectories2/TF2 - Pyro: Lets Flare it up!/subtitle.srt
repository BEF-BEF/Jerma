00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:08,060
Hey, what is happening guys? Jerma here with the gameplay commentary. Spy, I don't think so.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:14,460
Playing as the Pyro on Gold Rush, defense on Gold Rush, I'm using the strange flamethrower,

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,500
the strange flare gun, and the power jack. I don't use melee that often, so if you're wondering,

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,420
Jerma, why don't you use the extinguisher? Cause I'm an idiot and I can't use it.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,339
Also, we started right in the beginning, because I was checking my steam messages

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,259
and standing completely still. And when I watched the demo back, I was like,

7
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:37,420
what the hell was I doing? Why am I just standing here? And I was like, all right,

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,990
I was just checking my messages. That's why we started right off the bat, right when the

9
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:47,030
card is coming out the door. No setup time, none of that malarkey. Let's get right into it here.

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,390
Let's do it, Jerma, let's do a shoutcast in the beginning. Why not? Let's go for it.

11
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,670
Walking up the stairs, Jerma sees a soldier, turns around, shoots him with a flare gun,

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,909
but he dies before Jerma can get any shots on him. Two teleporters up, and that's a very,

13
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:01,590
very fantastic thing for the engineers, because everybody can get out here as fast as they can.

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,109
Give him a couple of spritz here, trying to find a spy, does not see one. He gets a wrangled

15
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:08,950
sentry up, comes down nosy as the cover, gets the health pack, comes down here, sees a spy,

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,349
and a pyro, and an engineer, and I made up those names, gets the flare gun shot on that medic,

17
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:17,189
absolutely fantastic. He gets another shot on the flare gun with that sniper, and here comes a spy,

18
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,390
Jerma gets him, pops him in the air, misses with the shot, shoots him again, he's gonna get the

19
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,189
shot, he does not get the shot, but he kills him with the flame anyways. Oh my God, those are hard

20
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:33,140
to do. So, up here just protecting the sentry nest, and just really quickly I want to talk about

21
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,040
something that happened to me in the last couple days. Very, very scary stuff, I was terrified,

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,540
I was freaking out. So my computer, my big, expensive, crazy computer, crapped the bed on,

23
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,819
I think it was Friday or Thursday, one or two days ago. So I was getting blue screens and black

24
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:56,620
screens every time I turned on the computer, and I lost everything, guys. I had to reformat

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,980
everything, reinstall windows, reformat the hard drive, everything you could think of I had to do.

26
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,260
So now I'm starting from complete and total scratch, I had to reinstall Team Fortress.

27
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,270
Not like that fixed the crash problems, because they're still happening. I'm back in business,

28
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,430
nothing happened from it, I was really scared that I was gonna have to go rush out and buy

29
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,469
new computer parts so I could get some more videos out, because I want to make videos,

30
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:23,430
because I love doing it. Thank goodness I did not have to do that, though. So there is no concern,

31
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,430
I am back in business, even though I didn't go anywhere in the first place, just figured you

32
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,150
guys might want to know that. So let's get back into the gameplay. I've been practicing my flare

33
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,629
gun shots, guys. I've gotten a hell of a lot better than I was a couple months ago, or even a

34
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:43,449
few weeks ago, because I came to the realization that the flare gun is just the huntsman that

35
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:47,530
lights people on fire. And I'm pretty good with the huntsman, I'm decent with the huntsman, enough

36
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,849
where I'm confident on using it. I never wanted to use the flare gun, I was never good with it.

37
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:58,520
Demo right in my face. That was great. But anyways, if you can use the huntsman, you can use the flare

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,800
gun, they're both the exact same mechanic, they both almost have the same projectile speed,

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,360
and the same projectile movement. The flare gun I think has a little bit more drop-off than the

40
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,800
huntsman, but I've started playing with the flare gun as if I was using the huntsman, or the crossbow

41
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,680
for the medic. So start thinking like a huntsman when you're playing as the flare gun pyro.

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,270
If you are not good with the huntsman, and you're not good with the crossbow with the medic,

43
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,870
there's not a whole lot of advice I can give you right now, other than just try to get good

44
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,110
with your timing, and try to get good at leading your targets. It's a little easier with the flare

45
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,669
gun, because most of the time, you're going to be lighting somebody on fire, like you'll see me do,

46
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:40,310
pop them in the air, and shoot them with the flare gun and kill them. That's a little easier to me

47
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,150
than trying to get a headshot with the huntsman. Here's a good example right here, this scout light

48
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,710
him on fire, instantly shoot him with the flare gun, he is dead instantly, almost within two seconds

49
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,629
of him coming out of the spawn. That's what you want to try and do, you want to try and just get

50
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:57,349
somebody lit, don't really have to try and hold the mouse button on him, just get them on fire,

51
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:02,150
move them around a little bit, try and time it, get the flare gun shot. You will kill most classes

52
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,110
in the game with one shot, maybe two, if you're dealing with a heavy, or a soldier, or something

53
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:13,030
like that. Now this part is lucky crit fire activation right now, kill four people in like

54
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,230
two seconds, pop that sniper in the air, shoot him with the flare gun, get the kill, we're not done

55
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:23,430
yet, coming over to the spawn, see that heavy, blast him back into the spawn door, light all these

56
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:31,189
people on fire, it's just absolute chaos, get the shot, more flare fire, oh my god, I killed seven

57
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:38,889
people right there, that was unbelievable, I was like wow, pyro for the win. Coming back around

58
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:44,089
here on the side again, get the flare gun kill on the sniper again, see the entire team coming out

59
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:48,310
there, I was like no way I'm running into that. Backing up here shooting the flare gun a couple

60
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,470
more times, trying to get some shots, get it on that heavy, coming up here guys, make sure you do

61
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,629
this too, spray around just once or twice when you come up to a sentry nest, only because your

62
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:01,769
engineers would really appreciate it, a spy that comes back here could really damper the team,

63
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:05,529
here comes an uber soldier, it doesn't matter, he doesn't really go that far, those engineers had

64
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:09,930
that sentry pretty much on lockdown, trying to dance around right here, me and him having a

65
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,329
dancing competition, I end up winning the contest, I got first prize, they gave me a blue ribbon and

66
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:18,500
everything. Coming back to the spawn again, they don't want me up here, I'm not going to do it

67
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,420
either, I'm going to run backwards, here comes a heavy with the, I think that's the brass beast,

68
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,519
who knows what he's got, I'm just getting the hell out of there. I want to bring this up right now

69
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,480
because I feel like somebody else might agree with me, does anybody else get motion sickness

70
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,839
from the Gerardi on their screen? I get physically sick whenever the Gerardi's on my screen with

71
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,279
like the wavy yellow bubbly kind of feel to it, every time that happens I kind of look down for

72
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:48,680
a second because I know that I'm going to be like, oh I'm going to like puke if I see it for any

73
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,170
longer, so if you get that too let me know, I'm pretty curious. So for the first time in the entire

74
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,569
match the blue team is finally getting onto the cart with less than a minute and a half to go,

75
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:02,889
I get a nice reflect right here, they get covered in Gerardi, the rest of the team goes down, this

76
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:07,449
push was nullified, come up here up in the top left here you'll see this is a great direct hit

77
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:12,649
reflect, right there I get a kill, don't end up getting the victory on the soldier though because

78
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:17,610
you'll see I get absolutely humiliated, go for the melee kill and then I'm a little too quick to pull

79
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:23,610
it out again and he smashes me in the face, skipping all of the respawn times on this particular

80
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,769
gameplay because the respawn time on this server was like 17 seconds and that's a little too long

81
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:34,009
for me especially in a gameplay, you got to cut that out because it's kind of boring, coming around

82
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:38,569
to the side here 30 seconds left trying to stop them from coming, I missed this I thought I was

83
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:42,170
going to get it that would have been awesome but I get the kill anyways and I get another kill from

84
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,529
the afterburn on that scout I believe, any of a century here I did not see it before but I get

85
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:52,329
smoked by it and that is going to be the end of the gameplay for the rest of the time I'm just

86
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:57,300
sitting out because look at the respawn time 17 seconds, thank you all so much for watching I

87
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,100
really do appreciate it, I'll see you guys all next time and take care everybody.
