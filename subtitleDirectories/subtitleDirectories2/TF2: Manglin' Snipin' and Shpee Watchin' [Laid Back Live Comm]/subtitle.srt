00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,259
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with kind of a different video today.

2
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,679
Oh, not really different, but a little bit different than what you've been used to the last few months of the content of my

3
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,179
Channel. What is going on with this? What is going on with this guy?

4
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:32,469
And what I mean by that, sorry, I was interrupted there, is this is gonna be just a laid-back live commentary.

5
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:36,229
I haven't done one of these in a long time, and I feel like it's kind of overdue.

6
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,270
A lot of the stuff on my channel lately has been, hold on, see if I can get this off, I'll pull this off.

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,979
Dammit, almost, that was close, oh well.

8
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:49,100
But a lot of the content on my channel lately has been like wacky and crazy, and that's like, that's who I am.

9
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,859
But I also want to do more stuff like this, where I just kind of hang out, talk to you guys about anything really, and

10
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,820
play some video games. And today we're playing TF2, playing as the cow mangler, as you can see.

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,380
And I'm going to get that sentry gun. I'm gonna get it.

12
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,650
I'm gonna use the strategy where you shoot it, you right-click it, and then you kill it with a shotgun.

13
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:10,390
Or this guy will just uber it, we'll see.

14
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,349
There's a-

15
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:14,269
Ooh, ooh.

16
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:15,870
Gotta kill the engineer.

17
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,670
There we go. Okay, good, good, good. So, what?

18
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,390
What? Looks like there could be one or two. Let's shoot that over there, get rid of this.

19
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,299
Bang. Yep. All right, we're gonna try the shotgun strategy.

20
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:37,090
I'm gonna try the shotgun strategy again, the cow mangler, and then shotgun. Sentry's right around this corner.

21
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,540
Let's see if I can do this. Where is it? I need to know where it is. There it is. Okay, here we go.

22
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:50,739
Ready? Shotgun strat. Three, four. There it is.

23
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:55,540
Oh, at least I got the sentry gun. So it works. It does work.

24
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:59,939
It's fun to do as well. Sometimes if you're running straight at a sentry like that,

25
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:05,060
and you charge up the cow mangler and you sprint at it, it's pretty intense, especially if there's an engineer nearby.

26
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,740
It's really fun. What? That didn't even hit him with anything.

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:24,400
Knew he was low on health because he wouldn't have ran away. Hi. Oh, he got me.

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:34,930
Which one am I gonna use? Should I use knife? Should I use gun? Should I use knife? Should I use gun? Knife? Gun? Knife?

29
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,490
Gun? Knife? I don't know. Gun? Knife?

30
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:47,849
Oh boy. This is what I'm talking about here. This is what I'm talking about. That's what I want. Come on, spy.

31
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:53,650
Do you do your work? Oh, yeah, that's what we call teamwork. That was teamwork for sure.

32
00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:01,740
I wouldn't have gotten there in time, and that spy did a hell of a lot of good things, and this spy

33
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:12,599
is being a real son of a bitch. Be careful. Get full health. Let me get full health and full mana.

34
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:22,729
You know, a lot of people forget this is a window. I always forget that.

35
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:26,219
I always think it's like, oh, they can only that I can only see them in one place.

36
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:27,819
That means they're gonna come from one place.

37
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:35,909
It's a window right there that you can shoot through. People are like hiding. Damn.

38
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:50,580
Oh boy. There they go. Keep it rolling, boys. Keep it rolling. That's what I like to see. We're gonna win.

39
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:58,259
I think we're actually gonna do it. I missed it. It's okay.

40
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:15,389
Distracted. Distraction. Nice job. Need some help here.

41
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:25,050
There's a sniper up there. I know he's there. What? What?

42
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:33,939
What? What just happened?

43
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,660
He was like on an invisible platform.

44
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:45,790
You guys saw that? That was that just like ultra lag for that guy? And what is this guy doing?

45
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:56,019
There's a spy. I need to see that spy. Hold on. I don't even care if I'm burning. That's spy. Where'd he go?

46
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,899
He's over here somewhere. No, no, don't kill him.

47
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:09,779
Dude, that was... somebody play the Benny Hill theme song.

48
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:21,939
That was amazing. I loved every single second of that. There's another sniper on this team. That's really good.

49
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,420
I'm trying to find him because I know he's gonna kill me over and over again.

50
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:30,649
Get... please.

51
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:38,120
Thank you. Is that him? That's him. He's good. This guy's good. This guy knows what he's doing.

52
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,560
Ooh.

53
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:51,660
Refill. Get a little bit of a refill. That guy was standing in the same spot again. And his buddy. Got you both.

54
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:59,379
Be careful next time. Watch yourself. Missed that headshot. Don't know how. That guy burned.

55
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:04,199
I could probably take out this sentry gun. I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

56
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,379
Ah, shit!

57
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:20,529
We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. We have seven snipers.

58
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:28,459
That's a little ridiculous. That is just a little bit ridiculous.

59
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:36,860
You know, I always thought that when a Spie became an adult spy, they, uh...

60
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,610
they kind of grew up a little bit and stopped acting kind of like crazy.

61
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:53,300
I don't think that's true anymore. I was like disguising as an engineer. Not entirely sure why. Oh, that's uh...

62
00:06:54,259 --> 00:07:04,790
Another one? What the hell is going on? What does he do? What is this guy doing?

63
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,779
He was just like crouching in the middle.

64
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,199
This guy is great.

65
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:28,889
That was a good like strat. Just like crouch in the middle. Oh dear. Oh, it's your toast. I'm gonna get you now.

66
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:34,139
Oh, I'm not. That just scared the hell out of me. That whole group of people,

67
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:45,939
I got like stage fright. Get on the cart. Get on the cart. Get on the cart.

68
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:53,600
We need to get on the cart. So badly. They have so many defenses, like we have to get on here.

69
00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:03,389
There's like a thousand different defenses. And he's dead. Nice job. All right. Well, that's probably gonna wrap it up here guys.

70
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:10,699
Um, but this is the last life. This'll be the last life. Shit. I didn't time that right. Wee!

71
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:20,579
Oh, get me away from you guys. Nudist guys. All right. Well, sorry.

72
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:23,779
I was like just like talking and I lost my train of thought because like that nonsense.

73
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:29,620
But I'll see you guys all next time. Thank you so much for watching. Take care everybody, of course. And I'll see you all

74
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,080
next time.

75
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,460
I don't know like when to go for the stab. How did I get that? That was a chaos stab if I've ever seen one.
