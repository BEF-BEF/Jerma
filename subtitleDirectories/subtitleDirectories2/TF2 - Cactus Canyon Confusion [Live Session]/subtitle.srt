1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:14,929
Everybody run. Run, run as fast as you can. Something about the gingerbread man. There's some line there.

2
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:22,320
Hey, but hi, welcome everybody. This is Cactus Canyon. This is the, uh, I guess improved Cactus Canyon.

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,559
If you remember the last time we played on this map, the, that is a spy, and he exploded, so we're okay.

4
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:38,229
But if you remember on Cactus Canyon last time, my last video, there was no way to conceivably, like, get through this choke point

5
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:44,229
unless, of course, you went straight through the choke point. So now they added a little thing to the top left here.

6
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:47,659
If I could, I don't want to pull, no, pull the shotgun out, you dipshit.

7
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:58,240
No! No! They added a little thing here. I can't even speak. Speak words, Jerma, speak words. Use your words.

8
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,170
Uh, they added a thing in the top left. There we go. That wasn't so hard, was it?

9
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,920
So now it's not just ridiculous people going through the choke. And there's a spy there. Who's on this cart? Oh, nobody, of course.

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:21,040
Nobody. Nobody. But I need to run. I need to get back in the water. Maybe get this medic to heal me. That would be fantastic.

11
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,469
You might be, yes, you are, in fact, a spy. No, you're not. I need my glasses checked.

12
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:33,340
You know, go see my local ophthalmologist. Go get a new prescription.

13
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,219
Sometimes your eyes aren't that good. My eyes are pretty bad, but that's a different story.

14
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:48,920
Hello, scout. Oh, medic, medic, medic, please. There we go. Surprise. That was a double.

15
00:01:49,920 --> 00:02:00,340
Whoo. Whoo. More medic help. I love you. Be careful. Don't let them push.

16
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,769
We only, we only got eight and a half more minutes. Might sound like a lot, but watch out behind you.

17
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:11,460
Don't let them. Please, please let me get that shot. I almost messed that all up.

18
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:23,189
And yes, this is, hey, hey, just everybody chill. I got a pretty good streak going here.

19
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:28,750
I don't want to mess it up with any stupid moves, but we're going to get this demo man that went around this way.

20
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,759
And he doesn't even know we're chasing him. Oh, there's plenty of people over here.

21
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:43,509
Please, please. I just got that medic killed. That's a dead ringer for sure.

22
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:50,389
People are just everywhere. I'm in trouble. This is the end. This is the end for me. That's the end for me.

23
00:02:50,389 --> 00:03:00,819
I died. Set up three seconds. What the fuck is going on here? Three sec. What?

24
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:13,180
Okay. I, there's a train. There's a train here now. What? And they just get to sit on the point.

25
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:21,710
All right. I'm pretty confused. Was there always a train here? I don't, was there?

26
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:30,219
This is cool if there wasn't. I don't remember a train. Damn it. Damn it.

27
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:36,620
They're going to cap the second point already. They're already going to get this second point.

28
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:45,819
And I, for one, am just all over the place with my shots. It's not going good right this second.

29
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:53,509
But at least we have that going for us. That is crazy. There's a, there's a legit train that comes down here.

30
00:03:53,509 --> 00:04:04,340
Cool. Cool. I like it. And where am I even going? Yeah. Okay. So they come from over here.

31
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,409
I'm, for some reason, I am just totally confused at everything. I'm like a toddler right now.

32
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:17,250
I'm just seeing shapes and colors and going like, oh, look at those. They're cool.

33
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,250
Whoa. Crit Scree. That's a Crit Scree that I wasn't prepared for. That's a Crit Scree that I wasn't prepared for.

34
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:29,110
But it's okay. We'll get some money. We'll get some money out of it. We'll get the money's worth somehow.

35
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:35,569
And where are they spawning? Over here? Okay. I knew you were going to reflect that.

36
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:42,180
That's why I prepared for it. I trained for it. Don't notice me. Do not. How did you know I was here?

37
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:50,009
Everybody just move out of the way. Damn. I wonder what else they're going to add to this.

38
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:56,410
There must be a couple of other things that they're going to add. I'm not sure. Who knows?

39
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:02,170
Who knows what Valve has up their sleeve? They probably got like an ace or two.

40
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:10,800
When was the last time Valve used an ace? You know, I mean, we've seen some, we've seen some queens, we've seen some kings.

41
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,860
But when's, when's the next TF2 ace? I wonder. Please tell me you don't have a whole lot of health. You didn't.

42
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:26,449
There's like spies just like running around back here. Don't let, don't let him trick you.

43
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,449
He absolutely is not dead.

44
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:34,360
Man, we're going to hold this for a long time.

45
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:44,970
He said, damn man. Can we just, can we? Please. I knew you were going in that room, huh?

46
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:56,819
Just quit jumping around. It's not like time for cardio right now. Get, I'm making quite a few like exercise references here for some reason.

47
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,860
He just launched that back. He did, didn't he?

48
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,930
All right. Nobody, nobody do anything crazy. I need to refill myself.

49
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,939
I need to fill myself up with some delicious red beams.

50
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:16,399
There we go. Let's go. And let me get an overheal too.

51
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,829
Let me get an overheal. Just did damage to myself. Fantastic.

52
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:31,490
Well, you're real miraculously. You know what? I don't know what's over there.

53
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:38,620
I feel like there's a sentry right there, but you know, I don't know. I've been wrong many, many times before.

54
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,759
They're all up here. Okay. I got you.

55
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,639
Sorry. I'm being like silent right now. I just don't want to get smashed by something.

56
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,199
Can we open this? No, that's the train.

57
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,319
Hey, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

58
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,649
Oh, don't shoot that back. You know what? I'm going to be safe here.

59
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:10,339
Let's be safe here. Anybody else? Come on.

60
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:16,230
Somebody walk into that. Ah, somebody could have walked into that.

61
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,980
I'm sorry. I'm like never prepared for this guy's crit screes.

62
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,740
I'm always like in the middle of like a reload animation.

63
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,579
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

64
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,709
Damn it. He didn't die from the fall damage.

65
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:36,709
And now I'm going to die from this pyro unless I can somehow keep myself healed with this.

66
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:39,709
And you are a lifesaver and you died for me.

67
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,589
And we both died, but at least I got the pyro.

68
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:51,740
We just cannot have that right in his face.

69
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,740
Stand back. Stand back. Stand back.

70
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,879
Come on. Come on. Come on.

71
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,819
Uh, well, I did, I did get a couple of them.

72
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,379
I did do some work there. It wasn't all for nothing.

73
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:22,949
Maybe somebody's going to hear. I, I, can I just say I love maps with crazy hazards like this.

74
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:27,189
Because somebody always gets smashed by it. It's just like the saws in Sawmill.

75
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,860
It's just like the train that is in that train map.

76
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,620
I forget the name of it. I want to say freight, but I don't want to be like totally wrong.

77
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,059
Did I just, no, I thought I got a double kill there, but no, it was just a domination.

78
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,860
Get the health. You're safe.

79
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,860
There is a big sentry up there and that just is not going to happen.

80
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,730
We just cannot have that. We cannot have that right now, but what is that guy doing?

81
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,940
Come on. This is pyro. It's pyro mania.

82
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,940
It's pyro mania all over again.

83
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:13,539
They're going to call it. That cut is like landed on a pane of glass.

84
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:17,990
Oh, they're going to get it. I think we're going to lose.

85
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,990
I think we are going to lose this.

86
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,809
As much as I don't want to say it, I think it's possible.

87
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:25,809
It's like four people. Three people just get hit by the train.

88
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:27,809
How many people were on blue?

89
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:31,559
Hopefully more people on blue get hit by the train. I'm not even going to deal with you.

90
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,559
Get on top of the, I don't even know where I am right now.

91
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:41,730
I can't let you do that. I got backstabbed.

92
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,730
Swear.

93
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,730
I'm just going to scream a swear word right now.

94
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,570
Poop.

95
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,899
Watch out.

96
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,580
There's that. Where is this? Where does it go now?

97
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,720
Why do I not know this?

98
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,149
What is it doing?

99
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:04,669
I really can't believe I don't know what this is, what's happening right now.

100
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:08,669
Have I only played on one part of this game, of this mode or something?

101
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:10,669
Am I just crazy?

102
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:13,490
I wish that critscreek was here right now.

103
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,490
I'll tell you that.

104
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,490
I'll tell you that.

105
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,139
It's no secret.

106
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:22,139
Oh, they're going to get it.

107
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,139
I didn't realize it was that close.

108
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:26,139
Didn't realize it was that close. Somebody, please.

109
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:28,309
We're going to lose. Game over.

110
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,309
He pushed him off.

111
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:31,309
What a hero.

112
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:33,309
Don't let this medic get it.

113
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:34,309
Come on.

114
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:36,490
Come on.

115
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,490
Heroes.

116
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,240
You guys are heroes.

117
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,539
I love it.

118
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:42,539
I got to whip somebody. Let's go.

119
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:47,370
Quick, quick, quick, quick. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.

120
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,370
Oh, there's no possible way.

121
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,370
We're going to keep this going for another six, seven minutes.

122
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,500
What is going on?

123
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Is it going backwards?

124
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Oh, what? It was going backwards, right?

125
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,220
What does a sentry up there?

126
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220
Okay, that is...

127
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,490
I'm...

128
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,490
I don't have any words.

129
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,730
Words can't be expressed. Where does it cap?

130
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,730
Where's the actual cap point here?

131
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,659
Because like, seriously, I am...

132
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:27,529
Is it goes around a circle?

133
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,529
Okay. No, it stops right there.

134
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,649
And it just falls off.

135
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:36,019
Okay.

136
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:39,019
This whole video, I think I'm going to like... No, no, no.

137
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:41,460
Oh, it gets hit by the train.

138
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,820
It has to get hit by the train?

139
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,450
That's awesome.

140
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,690
Okay, now my confusion is over.

141
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,690
But that's really, really cool.

142
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,309
And yeah, that might be the end of the video.

143
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:56,000
I think it is.

144
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Thanks everybody so much for watching. Really do appreciate it.

145
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This has been Jerma is Confused at Everything

146
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
in the updated Cactus Canyon map.

147
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Take care everybody. Have a nice day.

148
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Goodbye.
