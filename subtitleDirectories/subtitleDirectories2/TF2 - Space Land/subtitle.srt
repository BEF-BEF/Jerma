1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:29,890
So, this is RID Asteroid, and as you can see here, we've got plenty of different classes

2
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,890
to choose from. We've got plenty of demo men, we've got a lot of soldiers, we've got a lot of heavies.

3
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,890
There's not just scouts and engineers, there's way more.

4
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,740
What are we doing? We need to be killing the robots.

5
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,789
Don't pan the engineer. That's not what we should be doing.

6
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:58,159
Look, we have to go get the... Oh, there's an engineer over here.

7
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:05,340
Oh, great. Okay. These two centuries are so close to each other, I'm surprised that they're not going to be shooting at each other.

8
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,030
I got auto-balanced.

9
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,379
Hopefully, we will soon see the outcome.

10
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:41,599
Don't forget your bonk. Don't forget your bonk. Don't forget your bonk.

11
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:47,719
Oh, it's closing. The door is closing. No!

12
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,719
I wanted to get in there.

13
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,159
Don't you laugh at me.

14
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:01,219
Oh, shit. Oh, God. This guy. No.

15
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:11,800
Oh, what? How am I dominating somebody?

16
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,419
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. One second.

17
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,729
Give one second here.

18
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:21,729
What the flying fuck is going on right here?

19
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:28,090
What is this?

20
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,090
This guy's behind the glass.

21
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,099
Too many centuries versus a big... All right, here we go.

22
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:38,340
This is the real test of what's a better century.

23
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,340
Who's like the better engineer?

24
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:49,139
Two big centuries versus two minis blocked by glass.

25
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,409
Oh, my God.

26
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:04,490
Oh, boy.

27
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,110
What have we got? What have we got? What have we got?

28
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,860
Oh, look, a spy. I'm going to go steal your R2-D2.

29
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,229
You can try.

30
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,229
Stealth, are you on the other team?

31
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:18,610
I'm on blue.

32
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,610
Oh, well, I'm just making my way through.

33
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,550
Okay, I'm joining red. I'm on red.

34
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,500
Just sneak by here. Go by the hole. Anybody?

35
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Oh, look, a soldier. You might be AFK. Oh, no, you're not.

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,259
He was an AFK when I shot him.

37
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:36,879
Oh, now I'm at their R2-D2s.

38
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,120
I can't do it. I can't.

39
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
I just can't shoot R2-D2.

40
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,259
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

41
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:46,259
I'm going to get the intelligence.

42
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,819
Come on. Come on.

43
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:51,500
Oh, my God.

44
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Tom Hanks. I mean, Tom Cruise.

45
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,199
What are we going to do? We need to play his bets here.

46
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,199
Who is going to, like, actually not make it through this, do you think?

47
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,699
Oh, this thing is simple.

48
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:14,259
Oh, this thing is simple, huh?

49
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,259
Okay, now can you accept this?

50
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,389
What am I doing?

51
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:22,589
Can you accept that backflip?

52
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:24,589
I need to step back a little bit.

53
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:28,019
It would be really funny if you could get killed by that.

54
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:31,029
Whoa, that's going to be close.

55
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:36,009
All right, right here.

56
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,009
What the fuck just happened?

57
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:41,009
I definitely got killed by the laser.

58
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,290
Oh, this is so stupid.

59
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,470
I hope everybody makes it through.

60
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:11,790
So come to where, like, everybody is on a...

61
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,220
For, like, blue?

62
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,399
On, like, where we are.

63
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,899
Okay, on red?

64
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,860
All right, let me come to the front door.

65
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:31,120
I'm going to make this guy do a backflip.

66
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,420
And once, after, right when he's done...

67
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:45,959
Why did it take that guy that long to decide to do that?

68
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,139
Everyone's just kind of standing around.

69
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,980
There's, like, no objective for us to do right now.

70
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,290
Besides just, like, standing around.

71
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,290
There's one, two, three, four, five.

72
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,720
There's six people on our team, seven people.

73
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,939
Just chilling out right here.

74
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:10,310
Maybe we'll steal more points.

75
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,310
You got it. Congratulations.

76
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,519
Oh, shit, a player.

77
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,949
A guy on blue team. Look out.

78
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:20,949
Don't worry, there was only one of them.

79
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,949
There's ten people on their team.

80
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,769
We did it.
