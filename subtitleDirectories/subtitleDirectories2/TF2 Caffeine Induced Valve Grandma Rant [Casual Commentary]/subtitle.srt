1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,820
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jirba here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,820
And tonight, gonna be playing as the YAY!

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,190
So, uh, what I wanna talk about in this video is a couple of important things.

4
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,190
The first one is gonna talk about Team Fortress 2.

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,500
And the second thing is gonna talk about a new computer I'm getting.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
And I'm wicked excited because I'm building a new computer.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
We're gonna talk about the patch, we're gonna talk about, like, the service,

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,500
we're gonna talk about how much I get inside of it, and if you can't tell I've already had a few cups of coffee.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,500
And this is gonna kinda be like a coffee commentary in a little bit of a sense.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Where, you know, I'm just talking about nothing, talking about not, you know, whatever.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Well, we're gonna talk about this.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,859
So, the first thing, TF2, is...

13
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:50,859
We're gonna slow it down a little bit and get kinda serious.

14
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:54,299
TF2 hasn't really had anything going on in a long time.

15
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:59,299
And I really, truly hope, I have incredibly high hopes,

16
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:04,469
for not only the Halloween update coming out soon here, but the Christmas update.

17
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,709
Because if the Christmas update comes along, or the Halloween update comes along,

18
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:13,079
and nothing really is added to the game, that's gonna be pretty sad.

19
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,079
That's gonna be a sad day for the core community in Team Fortress 2.

20
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,079
But I highly doubt that's gonna happen.

21
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,079
I really don't think we're gonna get that overlooked by Valve.

22
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,579
But the thing is, Valve, at the moment, has so many things they're working on,

23
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,579
so many projects, so many secret things they don't want anybody to know about,

24
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:38,579
potential new games, they're getting into the hardware market with the Steam Machine,

25
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,579
SteamOS, they're doing a ton of stuff right now.

26
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:47,439
And I guess the question at hand is, is Team Fortress 2,

27
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,439
just like an afterthought for them at this point,

28
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:56,060
is Team Fortress 2 Valve's grandmother that they only see every so often?

29
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,060
All of us have grandparents that we see every so often.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,060
We love them, we respect them.

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,060
But we have our things that we're doing on a day-to-day basis.

32
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,060
We don't go see Grandma every day.

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,060
But when we do see her, she's gonna plant this big wet kiss on our face,

34
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,060
and we're gonna be like,

35
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,060
Hi Grandma, good to see you, I love you.

36
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,060
And she's always like,

37
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,060
Oh, it's such a great thing to see you, how's your school going?

38
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,300
How are you dear, please tell me everything.

39
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,610
Are we Valve's overzealous grandmother?

40
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,610
Is that what we're turning into?

41
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,610
Because Valve loves the TF2 community,

42
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,610
but I feel like they're just like, Hi TF2, how you doing?

43
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,610
Here's a few hats.

44
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,610
Okay, we gotta go now.

45
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,610
We gotta go back to work.

46
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,610
We'll talk to you later, Grandma.

47
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,780
And Grandma always gets really sad when you leave.

48
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,780
When you leave your grandparents' house,

49
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,780
they always get really sad that you leave.

50
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,780
And when Valve gives us something,

51
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,780
and then they just leave, we get really sad.

52
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,780
Please come back and visit me soon, Valve, I love you.

53
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,780
I'm your grandmother.

54
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm your grandmother, for Christ's sake.

55
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,780
And I feel like that's the road we're going down.

56
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,780
And Valve doesn't really give a shit.

57
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,780
And they're just like, you know what, just deal with it.

58
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,780
Open up the fucking community workshop

59
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,780
and have them make items for themselves.

60
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,780
And I really, I said this a long time ago,

61
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,780
and I hope it does happen,

62
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,780
that Valve turns this game over to the community

63
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,780
so we can make our own shit.

64
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
We can decide what goes in.

65
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,780
We can decide what doesn't go in.

66
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,780
We can take it over.

67
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,090
I want that to happen because when you're an old grandmother,

68
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,090
there's tons of other old grandmothers just like you

69
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,090
that'll come over your house and play bridge

70
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,090
or play cards or something.

71
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,090
Like, we can do that.

72
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,460
So if all y'all ever want to play bridge as an old grandmother,

73
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,460
like, you know, I'm down.

74
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,460
You know that now.

75
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,460
But regardless of that, I really, truly do have high hopes.

76
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,460
Like I said in the beginning,

77
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,460
I have high hopes that they'll give us some cool stuff

78
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,460
for Halloween and for Christmas.

79
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,699
I really don't want to be the old grandma

80
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,699
that's nagging them all the time,

81
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,699
but we really do need some new content in TF2.

82
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:57,699
It's been long overdue.

83
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:01,699
And I'm not talking about content that has already been here

84
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,699
and Valve just decided to release it.

85
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,699
Like the CP process map and the other stand-in,

86
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,699
those already existed for a long time.

87
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,699
And Valve just was like, you know what?

88
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,699
Stamp, this is now a map.

89
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:16,129
And this is by no means an attack on Valve.

90
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:18,129
Valve is my favorite gaming company.

91
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:20,129
I love everything they ever do.

92
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,129
They've been so good to us.

93
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:24,300
They've supported this game for free for so long.

94
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,300
And that's truly something that a game company never does.

95
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,300
But it's very evident that TF2 is not their top priority right now.

96
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,300
It's not even in the top three for priority lists.

97
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,300
They're working on so many things right now as a company.

98
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,300
TF2 is kind of on the back burner,

99
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,300
and that's completely understandable.

100
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,300
And I guess we'll just see what happens in the coming months

101
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,300
and the coming years.

102
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
We'll see where this game goes.

103
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,500
Nobody knows.

104
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
We'll move away from that.

105
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,500
We're going to talk now about my new computer that I'm working on.

106
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
It's going to be a beast.

107
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
For those of you that are computer junkies like me,

108
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,500
this thing is going to be an absolute mammoth machine.

109
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Chrono trigger reference.

110
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
It's going to be insane.

111
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
I'm going to make it an i7.

112
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm going to get the 7-core i7.

113
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,500
They don't even make those, but I'm going to make them make it for me.

114
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,500
No, I'm getting the i7-4930K,

115
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,680
which is their new 6-core processor for video rendering, video editing.

116
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,680
It should make things a lot more smoother than it is now.

117
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Also going to be getting a GTX 780.

118
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
I was going to get a Titan,

119
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,680
but looking at the benchmarks between the Titan and the 780,

120
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,680
it seems like it's not really that huge of a deal to spend an extra $600 or whatever it is.

121
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
A Titan's like $1,000, isn't it?

122
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
That's a little too much for me.

123
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
I can't spend that much money.

124
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
But it's also going to have all solid state.

125
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,680
I'm going to make sure I don't have any moving parts in there.

126
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,680
I want all solid state drives for keeping video footage, for editing video footage.

127
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,680
It's going to be a machine worth talking about.

128
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,860
And I promise the day this thing comes in,

129
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,860
the day that I get it all custom built and it's all here on the shelf,

130
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,860
I will make a vlog showcasing it, go over the specs again,

131
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,860
and that sort of thing.

132
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,160
But that's going to wrap up the video.

133
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
That's just all I really wanted to talk about.

134
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,160
I want to go off on like kind of a coffee, caffeine-induced rant

135
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,339
about the Team Fortress 2 state of the game.

136
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:16,339
And please let me know your thoughts, guys.

137
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,339
Let me know what you have to say about this.

138
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,339
Let me know how you feel.

139
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:21,339
I always like to hear about what you guys have to say.

140
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,339
Keep it simple. Keep it respectful.

141
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,339
And keep it clean.

142
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,339
Like a boxer's fight.

143
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:28,339
Anyways, guys, thank you so much for watching.

144
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,339
I really do appreciate it.

145
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:30,339
And I'll see you guys all next time.

146
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,939
And of course, you know what to do.

147
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:33,939
Take care, everybody.
