00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,379
Hey, what is going on, everybody? I am the Cactus. Welcome to another Timed Chaos build.

2
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,809
And I'm like stuck down here like this. Hey, do not close me in. This is...

3
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:30,239
No, I'm stuck. Okay. This is a Timed Chaos build, like I said, with MLC Stealth and Italics.

4
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,390
Hello, gentlemen. Hi. How's it going, German viewers?

5
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:41,130
Hi. So this week's episode, we are going to build a praying mantis.

6
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,130
This could be the toughest one yet, considering it's a praying mantis and it's incredibly difficult.

7
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,859
So we're going to have eight minutes, just like last time, to build this thing.

8
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:55,490
And... are you guys ready? Wait, where are we doing this? Like, right here?

9
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:01,859
In the shadow of the giant back here, I guess. I don't know. Let me change it back to daytime.

10
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:09,859
The cheese guy? The guy that's like a block of American cheese?

11
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:13,859
We've got plenty of area to work with here. Hey, we need that space.

12
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:22,019
He's building a grass trophy. Alright, he's building something that's really, like, not allowed.

13
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:26,840
Are you ready? I don't know what this is. I'm going to start the timer and then we're going to be in a lot of trouble.

14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,810
So are you ready? Nope, because I've got to delete this thing. Alright, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete.

15
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:41,980
Alright, and in three... Wait, what are we building again? Hold on. A praying mantis. We went over this.

16
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,980
Alright, praying mantis in three, two, one, go.

17
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,540
Alright, where's the front? Where's the back? I don't know.

18
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:55,540
I don't know what a praying mantis looks like. Alright, start with the legs. There's like four finely little legs.

19
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,540
Alright, so he's got four... No, he only has two legs, doesn't he?

20
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,709
You guys just get started. I'm Googling praying mantis. I think he's got four.

21
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:09,590
No, I think a praying mantis has... I don't know. No, he has two. He crawls on his hands and knees, doesn't he?

22
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,590
Why didn't we look up what a praying mantis looks like?

23
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,830
I'm pretty sure he's only got... I think he's got four legs. Wait, I don't have the color green wool.

24
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,009
He has four legs. That's Google Images here.

25
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:24,439
He has four legs? Now where are they? Oh my god, what are you doing?

26
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:27,439
I'm building a big spiny leg. Looks like a vulture.

27
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,870
We didn't put the green on the same color.

28
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,870
Well, we're using dark green, or whatever the darker one is.

29
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,870
Alright, like, why can't I put a block down here?

30
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,870
See, here's his legs. So that's... Okay. He's gonna be like a grasshopper.

31
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,060
He's gonna come out this way.

32
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,060
Or delete all of my blocks if you want to.

33
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,060
Wait, how do you place a block? Oh, right click.

34
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,060
How do you place a block?

35
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,060
How do you place a block?

36
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,060
I was left clicking and I was like, why is it destroying everything?

37
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,680
So wait, are his four legs bad? I gotta look up what he looks like.

38
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,479
No, he's got a really long body.

39
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,780
Yeah, he's got like two in the front and then two on the side, like right next to him.

40
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,780
And then a really long body in the back with wings on top.

41
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,780
This looks like a goose.

42
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,370
Okay, so let's...

43
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,370
Like a little sphere body. You know what I'm saying?

44
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,120
See, like three blocks wide.

45
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,120
Four blocks.

46
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Alright, so...

47
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
So, don't make it any wider than this.

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,120
And just make his body come out to touch the blocks. You know what I'm saying?

49
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Alright, good thing we're making like a goose grasshopper. This is perfect.

50
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,490
Yeah, currently we're making... I don't know what this is.

51
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,430
It looks like some kind of jungle gem is what it looks like.

52
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,430
I don't know.

53
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,669
Let's make the slide.

54
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:47,669
Oh look, we're making another horse.

55
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,669
It's the same thing as the horse.

56
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,669
It's a green horse.

57
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:54,669
His body's gonna be so much longer than this, like way longer.

58
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,669
Like, hold on.

59
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,669
Yeah, it's gotta go out past the legs.

60
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:59,669
I was building like his chest now.

61
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:02,669
Alright, I'll start building his neck, I guess.

62
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:05,669
Wait, I thought that's what I was doing just now.

63
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:07,669
Oh, is that the front or is this the front?

64
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:12,229
He's not like a giraffe. It has to come out long like this.

65
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:16,230
Yeah, the neck goes out pretty far.

66
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,230
And he's got his like scissor hands.

67
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,230
Wait, shouldn't he be looking up right now?

68
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,230
Start going up.

69
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,230
Yeah, why is he going so far like left?

70
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,230
What is this, Jerma, what is this?

71
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,660
Dude, he's like looking at something.

72
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,660
Like, he looks up.

73
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,660
Alright, well then stop going up right now, from here.

74
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,980
Alright, I'm building.

75
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,980
Because his legs start where he starts going up.

76
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:47,149
Hold on, we gotta redo the legs then.

77
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:51,149
I'm working on the tail or something back here.

78
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:53,149
Alright, three minutes have gone by.

79
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:57,399
Oh, good.

80
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,399
Three minutes already.

81
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,399
Alright, this just looks like...

82
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,089
Seriously, I just made a giant like man's arm.

83
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:06,970
Like, this is like not even...

84
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,399
This might actually come together pretty well.

85
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,399
I don't know, I'm not convinced yet.

86
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,399
Wait, what's going on with his leg?

87
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,579
This is his leg.

88
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:18,139
Why is this here then?

89
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:19,569
Why is what where?

90
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,569
Oh wait, are these the T-Rex arms?

91
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:24,060
One of the things I'm making out, these are...

92
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,060
He has four legs.

93
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,370
What have we made here?

94
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,370
Alright, I'll make his face.

95
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,540
This will be his face then.

96
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,540
What happened?

97
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,910
What have you done to Gumby?

98
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,910
Looks like somebody put Gumby on the torture rack and then like stretched him out.

99
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,540
What have you done to Gumby?

100
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,800
This looks like some sort of dinosaur.

101
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Oh, good thing we brought Gumby to the medieval times and put him on like the stretcher.

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,129
The breastplate stretcher.

103
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,129
Alright, I'm making some wings.

104
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:59,009
Alright, time to make his arms.

105
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:04,180
Alright, I'm gonna work on his head.

106
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,180
Four minutes and twenty seconds of Gumby.

107
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,420
If I cover up his body with the wings...

108
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,579
Wait, this thing has wings?

109
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,819
Yeah, dude.

110
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,819
Wait, wait.

111
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:18,819
Prey mantises have wings.

112
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,949
Dude, this thing...

113
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:26,319
We're making like a centaur.

114
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,319
This is not a preying mantis.

115
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,319
This is a centaur.

116
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,319
I did the arms like so wrong.

117
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,319
He's like...

118
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,319
He's got the same arms as the dude behind him.

119
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,319
Come over here where I am, right here behind you.

120
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,319
Alright, I'm redoing this.

121
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,319
It looks like alien, okay?

122
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,319
It looks like alien from the movie Alien, except he's green.

123
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,319
Well, I guess Prey Mantis kinda looks like an alien, doesn't he?

124
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,709
No, like the alien.

125
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:58,459
Oh.

126
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,860
God, this is so awful.

127
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,500
Five minutes have gone by.

128
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,709
Alright, I got...

129
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,709
I'm getting pretty good on the wings right here.

130
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:13,709
We're doing pretty good.

131
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,709
Alright, there's his head.

132
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,709
Oh my god.

133
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,709
Hi, I'm preying mantis.

134
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,949
Are you guys making Squidward over there?

135
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,949
Yes.

136
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,949
He looks like...

137
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,949
Oh my god.

138
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,949
This is the worst preying mantis.

139
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,949
We don't have no time.

140
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:36,129
You have to look at it where it blocks out the rest of his body.

141
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,129
And it just looks hilarious.

142
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,300
Come over here where I am.

143
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
Where it blocks out the back of his body.

144
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,800
You can't even tell.

145
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,420
It looks like a stick figure, like a green alien.

146
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,420
Oh, he really does just look like an alien.

147
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,180
He looks like the self-proc alien.

148
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,180
Okay, his body needs to be not a complete atrocity.

149
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,680
This needs to be a little bit bigger or wider.

150
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,939
A little more thick.

151
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:06,939
Alright, six minutes have gone by.

152
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,939
Six minutes? Good grief, man.

153
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:11,250
It's good, we got him.

154
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,250
I made some wings, so that's cool.

155
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,860
I think.

156
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,860
Where are you going?

157
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,350
Oh no!

158
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,660
He's got the tiniest little legs.

159
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,660
These hands have to be like knives.

160
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,470
Okay, make them knives.

161
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,470
My Minecraft is so bad at...

162
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,669
My Minecraft is so bad at...

163
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,669
Now he has machine guns apparently.

164
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:39,039
What's the different colors?

165
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,039
You said he had to have knives.

166
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,039
So I made knives.

167
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,039
Alright, let's give this other one a knife too.

168
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,470
Oh yeah.

169
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,470
Don't mess with him, he's got like two Tommy guns.

170
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,970
Oh, okay, good idea.

171
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,340
Good, good, good.

172
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,340
Dude, these legs are too small.

173
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,639
Less than one minute.

174
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,940
When he was born.

175
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,080
We have less than one minute.

176
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,220
Look at his freaking head.

177
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,029
It really just looks like an alien.

178
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,779
Alright, wait 30 seconds.

179
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,019
30 seconds.

180
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:17,649
He can fly more with these wings.

181
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:22,259
Hold on, let's make him bigger.

182
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,259
Okay, here we go. His legs are a little bit more thick now.

183
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:27,259
He's so wise.

184
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,629
You guys are kind of...

185
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:31,629
He's a little lopsided.

186
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:33,629
15 seconds.

187
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:35,629
And one hand is like

188
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:37,629
extremely larger and thicker than the other.

189
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:39,629
10 seconds.

190
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:41,629
And then we combined two different things in the middle.

191
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,629
It doesn't even look like they're connected.

192
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:45,629
Three seconds, two, one.

193
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:48,059
That's it.

194
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:50,059
I put a torch on his face

195
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:52,059
to make it look like he was smoking something.

196
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,559
I don't know why.

197
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,559
A good thing we combined two things in the middle.

198
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,559
We made like an airplane

199
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,559
and then we combined it with this thing right here

200
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,929
and then an alien.

201
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:04,929
Somebody totally deleted my wings.

202
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:06,929
I added more wings.

203
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:08,929
Alright, can somebody come explain to me

204
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:11,870
what's going on over here?

205
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,870
What is going on? Why does he have like one hand

206
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,870
that's like...

207
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,179
This is most certainly not a praying mantis.

208
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,179
One hand has a darker colored knife

209
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,179
and has seen more battle

210
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,179
than the other apparently.

211
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:27,179
This is like, oh my god.

212
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,000
Come look at it from far away.

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It is so bad from far away.

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,299
Up close, it's not that bad.

215
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,929
This is not a praying mantis.

216
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,929
It's like a dragon who just didn't make it.

217
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,929
Just like, I don't know.

218
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:43,360
The wings are like on his butt.

219
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
Oh man.

220
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Yeah, we didn't like do enough.

221
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
This is like too long or we didn't like fill it in enough

222
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
like right here.

223
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,600
It's just like a lot of nothing.

224
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Oh my god. Alright, well

225
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,029
thanks for watching guys

226
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:02,029
and we'll catch you guys all next time

227
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,029
and of course rate the thing

228
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:06,029
and give it a name if you want to give it a name

229
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:08,029
and we'll see you all next time. Take care everybody.

230
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:14,929
Boo!

231
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,409
What? What just happened there?
