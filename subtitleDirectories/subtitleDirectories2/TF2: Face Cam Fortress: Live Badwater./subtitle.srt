00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,320
So what is going on everybody? Welcome to FaceCamp Fortress Team, Face Fortress Camp 2.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,929
This is something I did a while back and I want to do it again just because I feel like it.

3
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:27,370
So let's see, let's see, what do I got right now? Default loadout. I'm just going to run with whatever I got.

4
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:35,490
We got the back burner, the flare gun, and the default axe. What? Why is that on?

5
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,990
Oh, where you going? On blue, this is on bad water as well.

6
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:49,200
But yeah, I just felt like doing this again because it's been quite a while since I've done this.

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,200
I think it was like Thanksgiving. Yeah, it was like Thanksgiving since I did this last.

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:01,719
FaceCamp Fortress 2. Oh, this guy's got no idea. Back burner, back burner.

9
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:10,500
Let's go this way. Get that crate, get that, get that crate. Oh, no!

10
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:20,599
Oh my god, I'm still alive. They have two sentries like stuffed in one little area down there. That's ballsnip.

11
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:28,829
You know what? F the pyro. We're going Demoman. I'm going to take that stuff out right now.

12
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:36,870
Hey, ready? If I don't take this out right now, if for some reason I don't kill all those sentries, I will...

13
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:43,540
That's a spy. No, it's not. I will swallow a whole egg.

14
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,540
A whole egg I will eat if I don't take those out like right now.

15
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:57,310
Like I'll crack the egg and then crack it into my mouth. What? What?

16
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:08,349
No, I don't want to eat an egg. I do not want to eat an egg. I got to eat an egg. I got to eat an egg on camera now.

17
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:18,740
I don't have any eggs here with me, so we'll have to do that in a different subscriber video.

18
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:26,169
I shot five stickies down right on that sentry. Oh, it was a glitch. It doesn't count. It was a glitch.

19
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:31,469
No, I'm just kidding. I still haven't gotten that haircut I was supposed to get a long time ago in my last vlog.

20
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:38,979
That just didn't happen. Get out of town, buddy. Get out of town, buster. That's a spy up there.

21
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:51,099
Alright, seriously. Come on now. Okay, it goes down then. I shoot five stickies down there and it doesn't go down.

22
00:02:51,099 --> 00:03:00,319
Come on. Oh, he's trying to build another one, huh? Nope. Oh god, they're spamming up here right now.

23
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:07,830
Is there another one down? Aww. Come on, let's cap that cock. Cap it, baby. Cap it.

24
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:16,819
So let me just hold on. Break. You know, I'm going to medic. Let's go medic with the...

25
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:23,250
What do I got? Syringe gun, critscreek, and the ubersaw. Take the damn critscreek off. Let's go with the medigun, baby.

26
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:30,500
I think we're going to cap it. I want the medigun. What the hell is going on? There we go.

27
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,879
I don't even think this is necessary. I think we're going to win. Maybe not.

28
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:49,379
Excuse me, sir. We got a cock to push over there. Mr. Jokester. Oh, we did it. We won.

29
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:58,199
Oh my god. Hey, we won. Maybe I'll do like another round.

30
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,199
So I have something to talk about in my next commentary. My next real sit-down commentary.

31
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:11,020
It's about something very, very important. Well, not really important. I just want to get your guys' viewpoints on it.

32
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:20,269
I'll save the topic for... I'll probably do it in two days. So what's today? Wednesday? Tuesday?

33
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:25,069
So yeah, it'll probably be up by like Friday or Saturday. But it's a very important topic.

34
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:32,250
And it's something that really made me very, very sad in the last couple days. And we'll discuss it when that comes up.

35
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,870
But in the meantime, I'm going to uber this pyro. And we're going to do absolutely nothing, probably.

36
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:47,329
Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Flame thrower. Flame. Flame thrower. Oh yeah. Denied. Denied. Denied.

37
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:56,959
Oh god. Woohoo. Run into that. Run into it. You bastard.

38
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,649
What do we got back here? Spencer? Sentry? Good. I can build it up on you, dude.

39
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:11,220
Come on, come on, come on. Only a minute and 47 seconds and we win this damn game. I refuse to lose. Come here. I got you.

40
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:19,259
You know what? For the remainder of the time, I'm just going to go battle medic. See if I can't do something fun.

41
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:26,860
Get out of town. Where is he? I'm bumping into him. There he is. Come here, you bastard.

42
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,300
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'm being a terrible medic. I know. I'm sorry. I apologize.

43
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:40,300
You don't have to eat that sandwich. You got me, buddy. I'm your friendly neighborhood pocket medic.

44
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,670
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. All right. Fine. You want to do that? I'll just smash you.

45
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:56,870
Oh, now I got a crits. Now I got a crits. All right. Drop it like it's hot, man. Down here. Here we go.

46
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:04,819
Shavoink. Get him. Ah, damn it. Oh, it's over. No, no. Do your right.

47
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:12,750
I can't talk over chat because if I do that, my game crashes because I have like three things going.

48
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,750
I got the webcam going. I got my microphone going and I have wraps going.

49
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:24,680
So like my entire world just takes like a dump on itself if I hit V. It happens all the time. It's not cool.

50
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:32,230
I think we got this in the bag, though. I think we do. I think this is all she wrote.

51
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:42,189
But yeah, thanks everybody for watching. I think this is going to be it. I will see you guys all next time.

52
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:46,189
Hold on. I actually can't say that yet because they just got two people on the car. Oh my god.

53
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:54,589
I'm here to save the day as a doctor. Get back out there. Over time. This is not good.

54
00:06:54,589 --> 00:07:01,970
I was about to say my outro. We did it. I didn't get on the scoreboard. That's a bunch of baloney.

55
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,660
But yeah, guys, thank you so much for watching. We really do appreciate it. I will see you all next time.

56
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,660
So peace and take care, everybody.
