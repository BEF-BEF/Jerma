00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,619
Hey, what is going on everybody? It's Jerma here with a vlog, and this is a kind of a

2
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:20,379
special vlog because, oh, spoiler, spoiler alert, there he is. That's my new dog. His

3
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:25,699
name is Otto, and I just got him last night. Me and my mother drove to Rhode Island to

4
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:30,989
pick him up. Hey, come here. Say hello to people. Come here. Can you see him? Look at

5
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,070
how, my God, my room is the messiest room I've ever seen in my life. Come here, you.

6
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:43,920
Come here. He's a little shy. So here he is. And why don't you look in the camera. Say

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,869
hello to the viewers. Look, see, he's a Dachshund, Doberman, Beagle. We don't even know what the

8
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:55,649
hell he is, but he's a rescue dog. And he's one years old, I think, one and a half, something

9
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,509
like that. We're not exactly sure how old he is exactly, but he's from Tennessee. That's

10
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:07,959
all I remember. But yeah, those of you that do know, I had a dog that passed away two

11
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:16,120
or three weeks ago. So this is kind of the, not really the replacement, but it's the continuation

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,760
of the dog lineage, because we used to have a Dachshund. He died and wanted to get another

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,480
dog, wanted to fill the shoes of the old one, so to speak. And he's doing a great job. He's

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,060
a fantastic dog. Look at him. Look at how shy he is. He's just burying his nose into

15
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,150
my arm. What's wrong with you? Huh? Okay, you can get down. So really the second order

16
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:43,819
of business of the video is, I just, I'm about to pass 20,000 subscribers. And guys, that is

17
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:51,670
unbelievable. That is insane. I just passed 15,000 like last month or something. You guys are

18
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:57,030
unbelievable. I have no words to really describe how amazing all you guys are for subscribing to

19
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,549
this channel and for keeping up with the content and for supporting and all the support, everything

20
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:07,829
you guys do. It's phenomenal. So huge, huge thank you so much for 20,000 subscribers. I can't

21
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:14,680
believe I'm actually saying that, but thank you. And to kind of add to that, I got another one of

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,960
those ridiculous videos planned. Probably not till 25,000 subscribers, but it's coming. So

23
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:25,819
be ready for that. We're going to do something wacky as usual. So Otto, you want to say goodbye?

24
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:32,729
His name's Otto. Did I say that? I hope I did. So Otto, say goodbye. See you later. Nice to meet

25
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:35,370
everybody. I hope you all have a good day.
