1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,080
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first ever German Rumble.

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,079
The rules are simple. If you are thrown over the top rope, you are eliminated from the game.

3
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:24,079
There are 20 competitors, each one will come out every 60 seconds.

4
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,079
And it's the German universe, so you could see anything.

5
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,079
Sit back, relax, and hold on to your seats, because here come the first two competitors.

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,960
And with that introduction, we are going to get right into this, get started here.

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,960
The first competitor, competitor number one, is going to be the Egg.

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,960
Now, a lot of you might not know who the Egg is, because he's been in one video.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,960
And the video only has like 15,000 views, so not very many people know who he is, but he's number one.

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,960
And number two, the second of two starting in the ring, is going to be Gabe Newell.

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,959
So this should be quite interesting, Gabe Newell versus the Egg in the initial couple minutes here in the initial round.

12
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:13,019
And we're going to let this play out, guys, going to get this started. I hope you enjoy.

13
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:18,019
And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, the bell is rung. The official first ever German Rumble is now underway.

14
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:21,019
Gabe Newell and the Egg are your first two competitors.

15
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:29,019
If you don't know how the Rumble works, essentially being the first two is very difficult to win the Rumble,

16
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:33,019
because you have to stay in here the entire time. And Gabe Newell looks like he could be getting pushed out.

17
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:35,019
No, takes a right hand to the Egg's face.

18
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:41,189
And hopefully both these competitors realize that if they want to have any, any dream of making it to the final five,

19
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,189
or even the final ten in this Rumble, they need to conserve their energy right now.

20
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:51,189
The Egg on the defensive getting his cranium pushed in by Gabe Newell, ducks under that punch, finds a way into the gut of the leader of Valve.

21
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:57,189
And we have our first introduction to do of the evening coming down the aisle right now.

22
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:06,189
There he is, the infamous blue spy from Team Fortress 2 in the number three spot, kind of making his way casually down the aisle.

23
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:11,189
He is on the offensive team, as you see, taking a break from his usual shenanigans in Team Fortress 2

24
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:15,189
to possibly come down here and help out Gabe Newell, who is in a little bit of trouble.

25
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:20,370
And you've got to be crazy to think that these two will not be working together. Of course they will be.

26
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,370
Gabe Newell going to take him up, setting him up for the double knee smash. That is a beautiful move.

27
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:30,370
Of course they'll be working together. Did anybody think differently? The Egg is in a ton of trouble, but wait a second!

28
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,370
The spy, I think, accidentally just hit Gabe Newell, maybe not going for a swinging neckbreaker on Gabe Newell. He turned!

29
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,849
You thought, I, this is unbelievable. Well, he is a backstabbing son of a bitch, so people, how would you not expect that?

30
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:46,849
But they still, Gabe Newell, that's your boss. He owns the company that you work for.

31
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:51,849
How could you do something like that and Gabe is not happy? Double teaming, working with the Egg now!

32
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:57,849
The times have turned, the tables have turned for the spy. This is outrageous and another competitor is on the way!

33
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:05,539
Pulling up the number four spot is coming down the ring aisle right now. There he is, and that's none other ladies and gentlemen than a

34
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:06,539
Yeah.

35
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,539
If you don't know who the

36
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:08,539
Yes.

37
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:13,539
There's plenty of them. There's thousands of them potentially. And it seems like one of them found their way into the arena.

38
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:18,539
Let's see how he fares against the people that are in the ring right now. We've got Gabe Newell and the Egg.

39
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:23,539
The spy seems to have let up a little bit on Gabe Newell. I think he's too afraid to go near those two,

40
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:29,539
considering that they were just double teaming. But there's no real answer to who is on whose side.

41
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:35,539
It's really every man for himself in the Royal Rumble. You can never expect any teammate to be a teammate for long.

42
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:40,539
They're going to turn eventually. It's just really a matter of time when. You could have your best friend, your worst enemy,

43
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:46,539
your girlfriend, your boyfriend, no matter who is in that ring with you, it no longer matters.

44
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:53,539
Everyone's trying to win and only one can. So we got five seconds or so left until another competitor comes down

45
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:56,539
and the ring is going to start to get a little bit crowded here.

46
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:00,539
More than five people in the ring at the same time is a little ridiculous.

47
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:05,719
And let's see who the next competitor is going to go down. It's another beer.

48
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:11,719
OK, I was actually not aware that there was more than one beer in this competition, but that's beer number 284.

49
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,899
Seems like he may have had a couple of drinks. He seems a little shitfaced right now, but that's OK.

50
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,899
We've got action in the ring right now. We've got the spy pushing the beer. We've got Gabe Newell tosses out the egg.

51
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,199
The first person to be eliminated is the egg in the German Rumble.

52
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,199
And don't sweat it, egg. Maybe you'll get to be in another video in like another three years.

53
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,199
Anyways, guys, we're going to move back to the action here. This is going to be very interesting.

54
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,199
You've got two beers who are from the same game. They're both from Grand Theft Auto IV.

55
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,379
And then you have Valve's Gabe Newell and the spy.

56
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:50,550
This is kind of turning into a tag team almost tournament rather than a Royal Rumble, which you don't get to really see that often.

57
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,550
And regardless, there's going to be a variable added to this equation in less than five seconds anyways.

58
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,550
So whatever was going to be here is pretty short lived. And Gabe Newell lining up a kick on the beer and kicks him right out.

59
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,550
The beer has been eliminated, one of the beers at least. And the spy has been eliminated too.

60
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,550
We didn't even get to see that. All the while another competitor coming down the aisle.

61
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:16,220
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Batboy. And I'm fairly certain we can all agree on this.

62
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:24,399
That Batboy could be the shittiest character so far. And it would be a real shame if Batboy were to win this Royal Rumble.

63
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,399
I can just say that, but that's personally, you might be rooting for Batboy, but I don't think anybody is.

64
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:35,399
Let's be completely honest here. But Batboy doing a little bit of work, trying to throw what initially was Gabe Newell out of the ring.

65
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,399
But he has since turned his attention to this beer that's lying on the ground.

66
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,399
And Gabe Newell sitting there while Batboy just eliminated somebody.

67
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,399
Can we be clear on this? Batboy just got an elimination and he's like the worst character that was created.

68
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,399
Hopefully Gabe Newell throws him out right now. That's what's on everybody's mind. It looks like he's going to do it.

69
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:59,639
No! Batboy with the resilience of 20 bats fends off Gabe Newell and stays in the match.

70
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,639
And just like that, in what seems to be no time at all, we have somebody else coming down the ring.

71
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,250
I wonder who it could be. Could it be somebody that you all know and love?

72
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:19,660
Could it be Boo from YouTube? BooMan61 wearing the cape, which was crafted this afternoon, this very afternoon by his seamstress.

73
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:25,660
Boo has two live-in seamstresses for his various cape needs. But he's getting real fired up right now.

74
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,660
Going to run into the ring. Not going to waste any time. Going for a punch on Gabe Newell gets the block.

75
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:37,660
And an armbar and a kick right in his penis by the low-blowing bastard that is Batboy.

76
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,660
Those of you that want a little bit of a backstory on Batboy.

77
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,660
He was a bat and a boy and then was put into a test tube and then put under radiation.

78
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,220
And they were trying to make a Spider-Man type superhero, but it actually turned out to be Batboy.

79
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:57,220
It was just really, really annoying and he just pissed off all the people in the laboratory, so they made him leave.

80
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,220
They gave him a suitcase and they told him, hey, here's $4,000. Take the next train to Philadelphia.

81
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,220
And he showed up here somehow. I don't even know how he got into this competition, to be honest.

82
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,589
But who really cares about Batboy? We have more important things to discuss.

83
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:14,589
Like we are almost nearing the halfway point of the first ever Jerma Rumble.

84
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:18,589
And what a good opportunity to introduce this man, Captain Humphreys.

85
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:23,589
No one has ever seen his face, but he promised us some gold this afternoon and we're going to get it.

86
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:27,589
And there it is. Each one of those gold pieces is worth about 30 United States dollars.

87
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,589
So, audience, I'd start grabbing.

88
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:34,829
And it seems like Batboy is on his way out and Boo is staring off into space.

89
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,829
I think someone's giving him the middle finger in the audience.

90
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:39,829
Batboy has been eliminated! Batboy is gone!

91
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:43,829
Scratch him off your list if you're keeping track. That's the final time he'll be here.

92
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,829
I promise you won't see Batboy in any other video ever.

93
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:49,829
So, Batboy, get the fuck out of here.

94
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:54,829
Anyways, we got Captain Old Bones Humphreys versus Gabe Newell versus Boo Man 61.

95
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:58,829
And again, we have three contestants, three people in the ring.

96
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:03,829
You know, you like to see Royal Rumbles get really, really hectic with a bunch of people.

97
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:06,829
But right now, Captain Old Bones is fighting for his life.

98
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:10,829
He punches Gabe Newell. He punches Boo. It's not his time yet.

99
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:14,829
But it is time. It is time to introduce another person.

100
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:18,829
It happens every minute on the dot, so keep your eyes peeled for Sonic the Hedgehog.

101
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:22,009
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen. Made his way to the first time in the arena.

102
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,009
He's riling the crowd up. His latest game was a piece of shit.

103
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:30,009
But he doesn't care. He's here to redeem himself, to redeem the qualities of Sonic the Hedgehog in old style.

104
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,009
He's coming in old school to take on everybody.

105
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:36,250
And we will see how he fares against these fellow fighters.

106
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,250
But let's talk about Gabe Newell for a second.

107
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,250
If you've noticed, Gabe is still in this.

108
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,250
He was the first person. He was one of two. It was Gabe Newell and the Egg, if you remember.

109
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,250
And Gabe Newell is still in this. You never see this.

110
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:55,250
It's so rare to see somebody that was one of the first people stay in for this long.

111
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,250
And maybe we're going to see Captain Old Bones take his spill here.

112
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,250
Boo is really pushing him on that right tarbuckle.

113
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,250
He's going backwards. He's going to...

114
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,250
Oh, he goes over. No, he doesn't. He just barely doesn't go over the edge.

115
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,250
And we see a scope slam by Gabe Newell onto Sonic the Hedgehog.

116
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,250
And my goodness gracious, things are really heating up here with another competitor coming in in a second here.

117
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:20,250
Not sure who it could be, but we're going to see Gabe Newell here setting up a powerbomb over the top turnbuckle to Sonic the Hedgehog.

118
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:26,250
Sonic is eliminated as we move to our next person, our next opponent coming in.

119
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,419
It is none other than Cognitive Gaming's MLC Stealth.

120
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,419
Lighten up this arena with the fireworks.

121
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:36,419
He got those from Costco at about 4 a.m. last night, and he just barely set them up in time.

122
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:40,419
And does Costco sell fireworks? I don't even think they do, so forget about anything I just said.

123
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:46,419
Comes in and takes Gabe Newell out by the knee, and Sonic the Hedgehog is still sticking around right now.

124
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:54,419
He has choice words for Gabe Newell after that embarrassing powerbomb over the top turnbuckle and only being in for less than about 40 seconds.

125
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:59,419
Sonic was eliminated, so choice words, they're not exactly sure what was said, but I'm sure it was rotten.

126
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:02,370
By the way, will we have a second here?

127
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,169
What the hell was that? Did he just cartwheel for no reason?

128
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:10,659
I can't, I have no idea, but Old Bones nearly getting pushed out by Boo.

129
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:16,659
That's the second time that Boo has not been able to capitalize on Old Bones on the outside of the apron.

130
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:21,840
But we're at zero, which means another fighter is on their way down to ringside.

131
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Fresh out of his time machine from the 1700s.

132
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Please give a warm welcome to Benjamin Franklin.

133
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
It's a real honor to have him here.

134
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,840
It's a real pleasure to be hosting Ben Franklin on his first ever time travel trip.

135
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,840
He said when we interviewed him, I had to come to the Jerma Arena.

136
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,840
I was preparing for this day because I want to kick Jerma's ass.

137
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,080
That's a direct quote from Benjamin Franklin.

138
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Look it up in one of your textbooks.

139
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,379
So there are five people in here now, coming on six if nobody is eliminated.

140
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:57,559
And people are just watching Ben Franklin punch Old Bones in the face.

141
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,559
Okay, that's fine.

142
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,559
And why are people letting him do this?

143
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,559
He just walked all over him without any contention.

144
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,559
What the hell was that?

145
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,559
I actually didn't see that.

146
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,559
That was, I did not know that happened.

147
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,559
I'm a little taken off guard by that.

148
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,559
But anyways, Ben Franklin pushing MLC stealth.

149
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,559
We got a couple of scuffles going on.

150
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,559
Nice belly to belly suplex by Boo.

151
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,799
And there's gonna be six people in here.

152
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,799
There's gonna be a sixth person coming in right now.

153
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,799
And it is Burger Boy.

154
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,299
Seems to have forgotten his pants.

155
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:30,539
He didn't forget his Ronald McDonald colored knee pads and armbands.

156
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:34,539
But he forgot to wear pants, which I wouldn't want to be near that guy.

157
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:36,539
I don't want to touch his balls or something.

158
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:37,539
That's really messed up.

159
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:38,539
But Boo, Boo has been eliminated.

160
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:39,539
Just like that.

161
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:40,539
Just that quickly.

162
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,539
Right when Burger Boy gets in the ring.

163
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:45,539
We almost had six people in here, but it turns out to be five.

164
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:50,539
And one of the top seeded players is no longer in this fight.

165
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:53,539
And we just saw a double choke slam by the likes of Burger Boy.

166
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:55,539
And throwing him against the ropes.

167
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:57,539
He's got a little bit of things to say to Ben Franklin.

168
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:00,539
Ben Franklin now throwing him alongside the ring.

169
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:03,539
Old Bones is kind of in the way there, but it's no match for Ben Franklin.

170
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:05,539
Ben Franklin with Ben Franklin with a lariat.

171
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:07,710
And Burger Boy is gone.

172
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,710
Burger Boy has been pushed out of this tournament in less than 20 seconds.

173
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,710
With a crushing lariat by Benjamin Franklin.

174
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,889
He has been training.

175
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:18,889
But is it going to be enough to withstand a kick from MLC Stealth?

176
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:19,889
It is not.

177
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:27,889
And Ben Franklin now is joining the members of people that have been thrown out of the ring in less than a minute's time.

178
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:28,889
That's unfortunate.

179
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,889
That is real unfortunate.

180
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:33,889
Ben Franklin traveled 400 years to get here.

181
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,889
And Gabe Newell almost gets thrown over too.

182
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,889
But time and time again holds on for dear life.

183
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:41,889
And he stays.

184
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:43,889
We're going to the second half of this rumble.

185
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,889
We're already in the second half.

186
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:47,889
And Gabe is still a contender.

187
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:50,639
Speaking of contenders.

188
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,639
We're going to see who lucky number 13 is or unlucky number 13.

189
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,639
Depending on how you look at superstitions.

190
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,639
There he is coming down here.

191
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,639
Nice and confident.

192
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,639
Nice and cocky.

193
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,639
It's Star.

194
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,639
Ladies and gentlemen.

195
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,639
Welcome Star to the arena.

196
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,639
He's coming in quite late.

197
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,639
So he does have a good chance to conserve energy and to be on top of his game.

198
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,639
We're going to see what happens.

199
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,639
He does not like old bones right off the bat.

200
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,639
Given a couple of punches to him.

201
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,639
Gives him a headbutt right to the back of his head.

202
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,639
Usually you see a headbutt to the front of the head.

203
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,639
But he was going for a different approach.

204
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,639
Going for the medulla oblongata it seems like.

205
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,639
And showing the strength.

206
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,639
Just power slamming the old bones down to the ground.

207
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,639
Rattling him to the core.

208
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,639
And really you like to see competitors stay a little bit chill at this point.

209
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,639
Especially if you're a character like Gabe.

210
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,639
Or if you're MLC stealth.

211
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,639
And you've been in here for a while.

212
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,639
Especially old bones.

213
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,639
We might see a double elimination here.

214
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,820
Two people rocking on the edge.

215
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,820
Star ends up getting out of his MLC stealth not so fortunate.

216
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
And he does a nice little backflip to keep himself in check.

217
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,820
And to keep himself there.

218
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,179
We have another entrance here.

219
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,179
Is that who I think it is?

220
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:02,620
That wouldn't happen to be MLG Grandpa would it?

221
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,980
It is!

222
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,980
It's Grandpa!

223
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,980
Coming down in his pajamas and socks.

224
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,220
Obviously does not care at all about the correct attire you would bring to a wrestling ring.

225
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,220
Him and Burger Boy have at least something in common.

226
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,220
Burger Boy was almost nude.

227
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,220
And Grandpa is in white socks.

228
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,220
He just got out of bed it seems.

229
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,220
Well that's not going to stop him from attacking MLC stealth.

230
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,220
And going for Gabe Newell.

231
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,220
You know I think Gabe Newell is really tired right now.

232
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,220
And Grandpa is taking that to his advantage.

233
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,220
Really trying to push him up on the turnbuckle here.

234
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,220
He's got Gabe in a really bad spot.

235
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,220
Looking down to the ground below.

236
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,220
He's trying to hold on.

237
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,220
Does not want to fall.

238
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,220
Star is not in time.

239
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
Gabe Newell is eliminated from the competition.

240
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,220
Star came over to what seemed like was trying to help out Gabe Newell.

241
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,220
And old bones!

242
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,220
Captain Humphreys is now gone as well.

243
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,220
That's two that are eliminated.

244
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,220
And another competitor is coming in.

245
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,529
God you just hate to see that.

246
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,529
Gabe was going to make it to the final forward scene.

247
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,529
But no he just was too tired.

248
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:03,529
And too much stress on his body.

249
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,529
And here comes Obama.

250
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,960
Rounding out number 15 is the current President of the United States.

251
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
He is riling the crowd up.

252
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
And he's pretty pumped himself.

253
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
He's starting to go into a little bit of a sprint here.

254
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Where it seems like a jog.

255
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Sliding right into the bottom of the ring.

256
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,960
And not going to do anything really crazy.

257
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
Kind of trying to grab for MLC.

258
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Holy shit!

259
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,259
Star just did the big boot to MLC stealth.

260
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,259
And he is now gone.

261
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,440
That was a heinous boot.

262
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,679
And we got the President currently.

263
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,679
Obama taking a little bit of a knee there.

264
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,679
Going oh and Star gives him the bulldog.

265
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,110
Seems to be getting his bearings.

266
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,110
But Star and Grandpa both not relentlessly letting up.

267
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,110
And here comes a double DDT.

268
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,419
Obama is a top seed.

269
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:47,419
So it makes perfect sense.

270
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:48,419
Just like we saw with Boo.

271
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:49,419
And what a block by the President.

272
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:51,419
What a counter block by Grandpa.

273
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:53,590
Gets tossed right into the hands of Star.

274
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,590
Trying to throw him over the top rope.

275
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,590
But he is going to catch a breather here.

276
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,590
A much needed breather may I add.

277
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,590
And we're going to see another yet another person.

278
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,590
Coming down that wonderful aisle.

279
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,960
It's Danny DeVito.

280
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,389
Funny story about Danny DeVito.

281
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:10,389
This was actually supposed to be Italics.

282
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:13,389
But Burger Boy when we were creating characters.

283
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,759
Wrote over Italics with Danny DeVito.

284
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:20,759
And I didn't know this until I started recording my footage.

285
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,759
So Italics is now Danny DeVito.

286
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,759
That's the story.

287
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,259
So back to the action now.

288
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:29,259
Danny DeVito is in the ring for rusing around.

289
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:30,259
Looking for his first target.

290
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:32,259
It's going to be Star.

291
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,259
Belly to back suplex seems to be quite effective.

292
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,259
Blocked by the President.

293
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,259
And what a punch that was by Obama.

294
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,259
Knocked Grandpa clean on his ass.

295
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,259
That was a hard, boisterous punch if I've ever seen one.

296
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,259
Trying to toss him out of the ring.

297
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:46,259
Grandpa going for it again.

298
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:47,259
Spinning around.

299
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:48,259
Throwing Obama around the side.

300
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,259
I'm just shocked to see him standing frankly.

301
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:52,259
After taking a blow like that.

302
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,259
And Obama is now gone.

303
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:56,259
Obama is now out of the competition.

304
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,259
He is riled up about that.

305
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,259
He is upset about that.

306
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:01,259
He had a good chance and he knew it.

307
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,259
To get to the final four.

308
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:03,259
At least in this competition.

309
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,259
But not right now.

310
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,259
He's going to get back to his presidential duties.

311
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,259
But now we got another person coming down and it...

312
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:11,009
Who the fuck is this?

313
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:15,019
What the hell is this thing?

314
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:16,019
Is this a giant chicken?

315
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:18,160
I guess so.

316
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,460
All right.

317
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
Well, ladies and gentlemen.

318
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,460
This is our new competitor.

319
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,460
Number 16 or 17 I believe.

320
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,460
I didn't check it out.

321
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,460
But it is the chicken.

322
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,410
Okay.

323
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,970
Here he comes.

324
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,269
Grandpa, Danny DeVito, the chicken and Star.

325
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:37,269
Are the remaining competitors with just a few more people.

326
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:39,269
That have not shown up yet.

327
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:41,269
And what a knee by Danny DeVito to the chicken.

328
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,269
Almost killing him.

329
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,269
I wish the chicken really did just like die right there.

330
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:46,269
Because the chicken like sucks.

331
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:48,829
But we'll treat him like a competitor regardless.

332
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:50,829
He has Star currently in a neck wrenching.

333
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:53,829
No, Star is going to pick him up and drop him on his back.

334
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:55,829
If you can even call that a back or his wings or...

335
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:57,829
And how tall is this guy?

336
00:17:57,829 --> 00:18:01,250
The chickens like nine feet tall with that head.

337
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,250
And is that a person in a chicken suit or is that a chicken in a person suit?

338
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,250
I have absolutely no idea.

339
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,549
And I'm not going to ask that question again.

340
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:11,549
And it's scary to think that the chicken really could win this.

341
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,549
Because we're down to the last like six or seven people in the rumble.

342
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:19,549
One of these people has a very high probability that they're going to win.

343
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:23,240
And speaking of really dumb characters and stupid entrances.

344
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,480
Here comes glue man.

345
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
So let's check in with our Twitter poll.

346
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,480
That's been running since the very beginning of this Royal Rumble.

347
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Who is the worst character that has been created?

348
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,480
And in the last 10 seconds, glue man has received 97,000 votes.

349
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,170
Anywho, let's talk about the rumble in general.

350
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,170
There are only two people left that have not come down into the ring.

351
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:49,170
Everybody in here and those remaining two are the only competitors left.

352
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,339
So who are those remaining two people?

353
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,579
I can maybe guess one of them.

354
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:56,140
But the other one, I just really don't know.

355
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,140
And I can promise you one thing.

356
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,140
There are no more chickens and no more bat boys and glue men.

357
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,140
So keep that in mind while you're thinking of the final two people.

358
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,960
Currently there is a situation over on the left side.

359
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,960
Star is about to be eliminated by Danny DeVito and he is.

360
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Star is not going to win this time, not this competition.

361
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,960
And we have our second to last competitor coming down the aisle right now.

362
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Who do you think it is?

363
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
He looks really great right now.

364
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Looks like he's been in the gym too.

365
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
It's Jerma, Jerma985.

366
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
He looks fantastic.

367
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
What a real great guy he looks like.

368
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Anyways, he's coming in right now to try and rough up these people.

369
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,960
It's coming to me right now just how ridiculous I made this character.

370
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Anyways, Grandpa taking a couple of swings on him, snaps the neck down.

371
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,960
And the chicken, the chicken could be eliminated right now.

372
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,960
We could see the end of the chicken and we are going to see Danny DeVito Italics eliminates the chicken.

373
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,960
That's another stupid character that has no chance of winning this rumble.

374
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,960
He's not. Did you see that face?

375
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
That was a really, really messed up face.

376
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
But Jerma getting thrown over the ropes.

377
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,960
It's these four and one other.

378
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Danny DeVito could be going out now.

379
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Three people, three people have been eliminated in the last one minute.

380
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
It's down to three now.

381
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,960
And this one final person.

382
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Who could this person be?

383
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,960
And is Grandpa going to get eliminated right now?

384
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Yes, he is.

385
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,200
The last three people.

386
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,579
Three people, Jerma, Glueman and another Bière.

387
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:30,579
A spectacular entrance for the final entry to this competition.

388
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:32,579
And what a competition it has been.

389
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,579
What a roller coaster ride this has been.

390
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:37,579
We are down to the final three.

391
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:44,289
Bière 419, Glueman and Jerma 985.

392
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:46,289
That sums it up perfectly for me, folks.

393
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:48,460
That sums it up for me.

394
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,460
And just before we get out of here, before this video ends in the next few minutes,

395
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,460
I just want to thank everybody for watching.

396
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,460
Thank you for sticking around to watch the first ever Jerma Rumble.

397
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
It's been a lot of fun.

398
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,460
It's been a lot of great times.

399
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,460
And here we go with the final three.

400
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Hope you enjoy.

401
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,460
Ladies and gentlemen, let's get started.

402
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,460
The Bière going in for a headlock.

403
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,460
Jerma breaks it up, throwing him into the turnbuckle.

404
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,700
Glueman kind of just looking on.

405
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,700
And Jerma is dipping over.

406
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,700
Jerma dips him over the side.

407
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
We are down to two competitors.

408
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,700
It's Glueman or Jerma.

409
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,700
That was quick.

410
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
That was fast.

411
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
That is how we like to see it.

412
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,940
And you can feel the intensity between these two.

413
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,940
One of them is going to be crowned champion of the first Jerma Rumble.

414
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,940
Could it be Glueman, the shittiest character voted on Twitter, or will it be Jerma?

415
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,940
No one is sure.

416
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,940
All we know is it's intense.

417
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,940
And speaking of intensity, here comes a push.

418
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,940
Here comes, could be the final push of the night.

419
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,940
Glueman is holding for dear life.

420
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,940
Jerma is trying to dip him.

421
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
Jerma gets him over the side.

422
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
Is he going to get it?

423
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,940
Jerma dips him over the side.

424
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,940
Jerma is your winner of the first ever Jerma Rumble.

425
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:58,359
And you can see just how good it is to come into a rumble in the final four or the final five.

426
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:03,359
If you get in in the final five, you have such a huge advantage over everybody else.

427
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,359
And Jerma or me proved that here today.

428
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,359
So thank you everybody so much for watching.

429
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,359
I really do appreciate it.

430
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,359
If you want to see more Jerma Rumbles, please let me know.

431
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,359
I'm not against doing another one of these.

432
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,359
And this is a lot of fun to make.

433
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,359
So I'll see you guys all next time.

434
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,359
Thank you so much for watching the Jerma Rumble.
