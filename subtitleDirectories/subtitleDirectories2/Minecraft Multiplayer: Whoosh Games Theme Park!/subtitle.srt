1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:19,399
What? What? The lone cow and the endless plains. What are you doing out here, man? Don't look at me like that.

2
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:28,899
I'm gonna mess you up, cow. Eat the raw meat. Eat the raw meat. Alright, let's go. I got leather.

3
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:37,719
And jump with joy because we're going to a crazy awesome theme park. We're going to the carnival.

4
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,719
Going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. I can't contain my excitement for the carnival.

5
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,259
Okay, that's enough. Oh my god, I'm so excited. We're gonna go play carnival games.

6
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:56,259
Welcome to Woosh Games theme park. At the entrance of every game, you'll find descriptions.

7
00:00:56,259 --> 00:01:01,259
What am I doing? Why am I like, I'm like looking, I can't, how do I get back to first person?

8
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:06,569
It's F, it's like F5 twice. Oh, okay, because I was like looking at myself like a bird.

9
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:18,260
Alright, so what's the rules? Alright, each, ow. Why you do that, man? I don't know. Read the rules, man.

10
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:26,959
Alright, you read the rules. I'll look. Did you, are you making the piano chirp? No. Do you hear that?

11
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:33,140
There's a bird in here. Is this like the clerk? Oh, he's the one doing it.

12
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:40,000
Like, can I order a double cheeseburger? Alright, cooked chicken, steak, or cake?

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,909
Uh, no double cheeseburgers. Goodbye. Goodbye, McCrafty's.

14
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:51,409
I'm taking a cake. So do you just want to start, start and go down the row?

15
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:53,409
Let's just go down the row, man. Let's do it.

16
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:59,650
Alright, ride your pig, make it step on the plates so your opponent will be shot. If you kill his pig, you win.

17
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,650
Red and blue lines are for the players to spectate, follow the orange line.

18
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,889
Alright, you're blue. You take the blue line, you just follow that line. Egg.

19
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:15,080
Okay, so we can hit the pigs, just don't kill your pig, man.

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,080
So the goal is we're trying to kill each other's pigs, right? Right, the first person whose pig dies loses.

21
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,009
Well, I hope you're ready to get destroyed. Oh, he's right here. Ride the pig and press I am ready to start.

22
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:35,550
There's like, how come there's more, there's like three pigs down here? Man, you are cheating hardcore.

23
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,979
How many pigs? I don't have any pigs down there.

24
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:41,979
Kill that pig that's in that pen.

25
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:45,979
Oh, now I've got another pig. Okay, now it's even.

26
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:50,539
So how do you put the saddle on the pig? You just right click the pig with the saddle.

27
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:56,900
I can't do it. He's like, he won't let me. I'm on my pig.

28
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
He's like, this is not, oh, there we go. Okay, I'm on it.

29
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,900
And push the button. Ready? I am ready. Go.

30
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,259
Uh oh, my pig, my stealthy pig jumped up on top of the mop, so did yours.

31
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:12,699
Wait, let's go pig. Oh, there we go. I'm down. I'm down. I punched him.

32
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:16,699
Oh, I punched my two. Okay, we got to make him step on the pressure plates.

33
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,699
Come on pig, me and you. Me and you pig.

34
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,580
Kill him. Kill his pig. Yeah, come on pig.

35
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,580
Get out of the corner. My pig is hiding in the corner.

36
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,759
Did you kill your pig?

37
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,759
Hey, looks like you won. Oh, it looks like I did win.

38
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,379
Well, I still have this pig. Not for long.

39
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:45,340
The next one. Next game on the menu is piston boxy. Boxy.

40
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,340
Why not? I got to throw some trash away.

41
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,340
I got some like raw meat to throw away.

42
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,340
Yeah, I got like a ton of arrows to throw away.

43
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,270
It's just like fire. Lava trash cans.

44
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:03,340
What a practical. Oh, here's your trash cans. It's just actually a lava pit.

45
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,520
We need some more recycling cans around here.

46
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,520
Make sure like your kid doesn't crawl in there.

47
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
All right. Okay, two players need it.

48
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Avoid punches. Knock your opponent down.

49
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,269
Red boxer, brown boxer.

50
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,449
It doesn't really matter to me. I'll go brown.

51
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,449
Take your pick. So we're supposed to box each other?

52
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:29,449
We're going to be pushing some kind of buttons to box.

53
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:32,449
So it's like rock-em-sock-em robots, except not.

54
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:35,620
All right, so I think I understand. Rock-em-sock-em robots.

55
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,620
Okay, fight. Fall into the white blocks is what it says. Okay.

56
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,300
I'm in some sort of arena now. So I see you over there.

57
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,300
All right. So I think we have to punch each other.

58
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
Whoever wins, wins, right?

59
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,300
Apparently by pushing these buttons on the left and right.

60
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,600
You ready? Ready? Go.

61
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,610
Oh, I'm going to dodge him.

62
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:01,870
Oh, no, that was coming. No, no. Oh, damn it.

63
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,870
I don't know. I think you went off first.

64
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,870
Oh, I did go off first. God darn it.

65
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,670
All right. Game number three is a PvP game.

66
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,180
Players needed at least two dodge arrows.

67
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,180
Shoot your opponent. You want to read the rules?

68
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,120
Welcome to dodge ball.

69
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,300
It's like playing dodge ball, but instead of a ball,

70
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,300
you shoot flaming arrows that will push the opponent against lava.

71
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
How terrible.

72
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,300
The player who dies loses the game by pressing the pressure plate.

73
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
You get bonus items. Okay.

74
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,920
So the yellow line is for people to watch.

75
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,990
All right. Don't leave your side.

76
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,990
I don't want to see cheating from you.

77
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,990
Oh, hey now.

78
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,870
I resent that slap on my face.

79
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,870
All right. Have fun.

80
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,180
Are you ready? Do it.

81
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,180
Okay. Here we go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

82
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,209
Are we still taking the armor?

83
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,209
I'm still taking the armor.

84
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:03,110
All right. All right. All right. I feel you.

85
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,110
Okay. I got this.

86
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,110
I got to like hide from you because I don't know what you're doing.

87
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,660
Yeah, I see you. I see you.

88
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
Oh, damn. I don't think so.

89
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,660
No. Peek around that corner.

90
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
Don't hide. Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.

91
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,389
See? Oh, give me this.

92
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,389
Oh, golden apples.

93
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:23,389
What? What is going on?

94
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:25,389
No. Eat the apple. Eat the apple.

95
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:26,389
No. Eat the apple.

96
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:28,389
Don't. Quit right clicking, you idiot.

97
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,389
I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

98
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,019
See, I was trying to save.

99
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:33,019
I can see your feet.

100
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,019
That's the French part.

101
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,019
Hold on. I was trying to save.

102
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,019
Oh, God. Eat the apple. Eat the apple.

103
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:42,579
Oh, shit.

104
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:47,269
You see, I was trying to save time by just shooting at you.

105
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:50,639
I didn't put any armor on.

106
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,139
So I was trying to sneak attack and shoot you before you put on all your armor.

107
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,139
That was so funny.

108
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,139
Didn't work out so well, though.

109
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,379
As you can see.
