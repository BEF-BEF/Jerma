1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,099
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Pit Fighter.

2
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:19,539
This is gonna be one of those games that's old, it's in that same category of, like, the Pac-Man games I played,

3
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:23,640
and the other weird, like, what-the-hell-is-this-game type of series.

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,539
And I can't, I can't even explain this game. It's atrocious, it's so stupid, it's a fighting game.

5
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:33,640
It's supposed to be, in quotes, a fighting game, but it's one of the worst games, like, ever made.

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,340
And you're gonna see why very shortly. I hope you guys enjoy it, live commentary's gonna kick in right now.

7
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,439
Just wanna do a brief introduction to it, and I'll see you guys all next time.

8
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,340
And of course, take care, everybody, even though I think I say that again in the end of the video.

9
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,600
But anyways, we'll say it twice, take care, everybody, see you soon, bye!

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, so here we go. We have the choice of being Buzz, the ex-pro wrestler, he's 6'2", 226.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,500
Bonnie Slim, headbutt, pile driver, he's got a couple of moves there.

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:08,099
Ty, the kickboxing champion, 5'11", weighed 186 pounds, agility-based fighter, spin kick, flying kick, and roundhouse kick.

13
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,299
Or we can be Kato, the third-degree black belt from the five-foot nine-

14
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,810
You know, none of this matters, none of this- there's only three people you can choose from.

15
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:22,609
It doesn't matter who you pick. You could pick any of these guys, and the exact same thing's gonna happen. You ready?

16
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:30,950
You see, the best part about this game is it has some of the most beautifully rendered animations I've ever seen in my life.

17
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,950
Take a look at how, like, the one or two sprites that were used to create the fantastic punching and kicking-

18
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:47,230
What? I've never done that before! What the hell was that? I just, like, pancaked him.

19
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:53,159
I'm gonna lose. It's very simple, there's, like, two buttons to this game. There's a punch, and there's a kick.

20
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,560
And apparently there's a jump, yeah, there is. That's just beautiful-looking, by the way.

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:09,039
Come here, you fat fuck- NO! Look, your health's in the top left. I gotta beat this guy! I got five, he's got five.

22
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,419
It's over, I lost. That was the game, by the way.

23
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:22,659
Another really stupid thing that you're probably going to realize is each one of these guys has the same stupid sound.

24
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:25,860
When you pick anyone- I just picked this guy. Ready, listen to this.

25
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,689
Look at how much the crowd just looks like utter shit, by the way.

26
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:38,629
I don't remember any crowd being, like, sepia tone in my life.

27
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:43,520
Alright, hold on, I might be able to pull this out. I might be able to pull this through.

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:52,840
Ooh, did you see that little spin kick? This is, like, the tutorial.

29
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,340
Oh, jam it. Jam it. Damn it! I got it! I got it!

30
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,979
Alright, that's the first time I've, like, ever beat that guy, so that's a good thing.

31
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:08,490
Gradually- why am I on a forklift? Alright, match two, you guys ready? Match two.

32
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:18,210
Look at my health! Why did I start with that little health?

33
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,009
I go-

34
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:34,639
Okay, I have 65 health. I'm gonna start the next fight with 65 health.

35
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,669
That's- that's fucking bullshit. That is absolute, complete, utter crap.

36
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:45,870
Look at- this guy has 260 health. This game is not possible to complete.

37
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,810
You can't complete this! How would you ever be able to do this?

38
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:58,319
It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't- it doesn't make any sense why that would ever be a thing.

39
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:05,219
Every fighting game I've ever played in my whole life, this is Street Fighter 1, this is Clay Fighter,

40
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:11,919
that's, like, a staple of all fighters. Why would you ever remove that? Why would you ever not do that?

41
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,620
Everybody starts with the same health when there's a new round.

42
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,920
Why would you remove that from this game? That's what I don't get. I don't understand that.

43
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:30,680
This game is so fucking stupid.

44
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,610
I just wanna- I wanna get past the first two guys. Is that so much to ask?

45
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,509
Who made this game? I don't even know who made this game.

46
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:46,279
All I remember is playing it for Super Nintendo and the arcade. This was in the arcades.

47
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:50,889
How much money do you think people wasted on this game in the arcade?

48
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:58,120
You probably had to throw, like, 30 bucks in the machine to be able to go past the first two guys.

49
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,100
It doesn't matter what you do. It really doesn't.

50
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,500
The guy with the cheap Halloween costume on is gonna beat you every time.

51
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:12,600
Unless you get lucky and you get him, like, in, like, a stun lock, you'll never beat this guy.

52
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,699
I wonder if there are, like, actual strategies. Did they make, like, a strategy guide for this game?

53
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,500
I wonder what the hell is in, like, the- you open it up and what does it say?

54
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,769
Press all buttons! That's- oh, yeah, that thing, and then the book closes.

55
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:31,269
Copyright 1991 THQ incorporated. Toy Headquarters.

56
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:39,439
What the hell- what does that mean? Toy Headquarters? Toy- like, toys?

57
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,189
I don't have any idea what that's supposed to mean.

58
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:47,689
What- welcome- oh, yeah, this game is made by THQ. The Toy Headquarters.

59
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:53,620
This is where Santa gets all his, like, fucking toys for Christmas.

60
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,550
I'm- it's over. I'm dead.

61
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,829
I'm using the controller, too. Can I, like, hack? Can I cheat to win?

62
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:02,490
I wonder if I can use, like, cheats.

63
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,230
What's, like, the code I have to put in? Like, up, up, down, down, B, B, B, T, T, T, T, T, Y, Y, T, T.

64
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:13,899
T? There's never been a controller with a T on it.

65
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:20,810
This is the type of game that you really- I really can't even imagine how this was even developed.

66
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,310
This game is so broken and so awful, I don't even know how this game was even developed.

67
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,009
What did they use? Did they use, like, a cereal box and a pen and paper to make this game?

68
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:35,750
Like, honest to God. Honest to God, how did they make this game?

69
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,350
They had some guy, like, take a couple pictures with his shirt off,

70
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,149
and then they put, like, a couple Halloween costumes on,

71
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:46,050
and then some guy took a fucking cereal box and started, like, drawing on it,

72
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:53,029
and then they, like, jammed it in a computer and, like, mashed on Enter until the game was, like, until, like, this popped out.

73
00:06:53,029 --> 00:07:02,240
They stuffed it in the CD drive.

74
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,579
The elbow's working. The elbow!

75
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:08,170
Oh my God, did I just find, like, the strategy?

76
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,819
Okay, I got 144 health.

77
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:15,519
Okay, come on. I gotta beat the second guy with the elbow strat.

78
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,019
Yeah, you made it. Let's go. I don't care.

79
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:24,370
Elbow strat. Elbow strat's gonna kick this guy's ass.

80
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,300
Yes. Yes! Yes!

81
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,000
You can't fuck with the elbow strat.

82
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,699
It's working. I'm gonna beat this guy. I'm gonna beat this guy. I'm gonna beat this guy.

83
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:44,829
Oh, no. Come on. Come on.

84
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:47,800
Yes! Yes! I did it.

85
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,779
That's the second guy. That's the second guy.

86
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:57,560
Alright. 89 health. Bring it on.

87
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:05,459
Grudge match? What? What?

88
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:11,240
What?

89
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,550
Alright, well, apparently I hit you more times than you hit me.

90
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,439
I've no... What the hell is this?

91
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,139
Alright, here we go. Let's go, man.

92
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,769
What? It's something like Lady.

93
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,800
Just stick to the elbow strat. That's the only thing that matters.

94
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,500
As long as you do the elbow strat with the kickboxer, you're gonna win.

95
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,330
Or you're gonna get stun-locked and, like, instantly... It's over. I lost.

96
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,429
Nah, it's over.

97
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,629
If you think I'm gonna start over again and do this all again,

98
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:45,649
get out of your mind.

99
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,450
And what's with the money?

100
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,950
What is with the money in the top left? I don't understand. Like, I have $12,000.

101
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:57,159
There's no upgrade system. There's no... There's nothing. It's just, like, points.

102
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,990
That's points, and they put a dollar symbol behind it.

103
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,990
Whatever. This is... I'm done.

104
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,070
I'm done playing this game.

105
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,169
That's Pit Fighter, guys.

106
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:13,070
One of the dumbest, worst games I've ever played in my life.

107
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,269
But I'll see you guys all next time. Thanks so much for watching.

108
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:17,269
Take care, everybody. See you all soon.
