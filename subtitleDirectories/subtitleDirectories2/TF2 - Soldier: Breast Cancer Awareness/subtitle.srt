00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:15,039
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary like you know it.

2
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:22,039
Using the Soldier in this gameplay with the default rocket launcher, the equalizer, and the strange shotgun.

3
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,539
And I think for the remainder of this gameplay, I'm going to speak like this.

4
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,020
Casey Casem. If any of you know who Casey Casem is, that's kind of how we used to talk.

5
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,320
I'm Casey Casem. He was real weirdo.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:42,500
But anyways, yeah, this is a gameplay commentary on Nucleus. King of the Hill Nucleus, even though there is not another type of Nucleus.

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,670
I wish there was though. Imagine if there was like five control point Nucleus.

8
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,039
Alright, let's get right into this here.

9
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,579
Rocket jump over to the middle point here. What was I doing? Can anybody tell me why I did that?

10
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,890
I'm one of those people that when they rocket jump, they do it at completely inappropriate times.

11
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:11,060
And when you really shouldn't be doing it at all. I never rocket jump when I'm supposed to.

12
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,060
I only rocket jump when I'm just being like an idiot.

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,239
Oh hey, I can just like jump over to the middle point.

14
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:20,239
Yahoo! Woohoo! Yeah!

15
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,239
I'll never do that again, I promise.

16
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:28,239
So I'm spamming over at the middle point here. No one's even gotten onto the point. Three minutes, three minutes.

17
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,420
This was also on a 32-person server.

18
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:38,420
And if you're aware, 32-player servers and Nucleus, or any King of the Hill map for that matter,

19
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,420
is pretty much complete and total insanity.

20
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,590
It's just crazy. 16 on 16, especially when they're full, it gets out of hand so quickly,

21
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,010
where you'll be walking out of the spawn and just... everything just kills you.

22
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:59,010
Ridiculous. I hate playing on King of the Hill maps with 16 on 16.

23
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,180
But you know, you're given a take. It can be fun sometimes, especially if you're playing a spam class.

24
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:11,810
Because once like 15 people get on the point, you can just lob four stickies over and kill a million people.

25
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,810
So we now have the point captured. 2.35 minutes left to go.

26
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,810
And I gotta commend this engineer that's behind us.

27
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,810
You'll see where the dispenser is. Absolutely fantastic.

28
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,810
I've never done this, but this is a great idea. It's level three.

29
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,300
And it's just healing everyone that comes over here. It's awesome.

30
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:37,300
This is one of the reasons why we're continuing to win, because this engineer has a fantastic dispenser.

31
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,479
Really guys, try that out. I'm excited to do that the next time I'm on this map.

32
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,479
You should be too, because it looks really fun.

33
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,979
And engineer's the best class in the entire game. Let's keep going, huh?

34
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:53,979
So as you know, some of you don't, but a lot of you do, this month is breast cancer awareness month.

35
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:58,979
And I really want to do something besides getting pain trained in the face, like just happened right there.

36
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,979
I want to do something interesting. I want to do something to kind of support the cause.

37
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:07,340
And it's not going to cost anybody any money. Just something really interesting I wanted to try and do.

38
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,650
So what I want to do, guys, is at some point in the next, probably the next few days or the next week or something,

39
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,949
I want to get a full server in my server, line up everybody, both blue team and red team,

40
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:26,189
somewhere maybe in bad water, a big, big open map, and have 32, actually I have a 24 person server,

41
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:31,189
so 24 people standing kind of in a group, all with a painted pink hat on.

42
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:35,189
And I want to just take a picture, put it somewhere, post it online somewhere just to say,

43
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:38,189
hey, look at Team Fortress 2, the community, we're all for this.

44
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:42,189
And I think it would be really interesting, because pink is in the game, you can paint your hat.

45
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:46,189
So if you don't have a pink hat or if you don't have pink paint,

46
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:51,189
maybe we could set up some type of donation system where if you have pink paint, you can send it over my way.

47
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:56,189
Or, guys, I'm willing just to buy 24 pink paints from the store.

48
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:00,189
It really doesn't matter to me. I think it just would be something really fun and interesting.

49
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:03,189
So yeah, we'll figure that out as time goes, but that's just something I wanted to throw out there,

50
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:06,189
something I wanted to do. We'll see how that goes.

51
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:12,189
And also, I'm going to be upping my upload schedule. It used to be about three or four times a week.

52
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:17,189
Now, guys, I'm going to try and really, really push for four or five uploads a week.

53
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,189
I know you guys want me to do more content. You guys ask me.

54
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:25,800
I get PMs all the time saying, hey, Germa, you should really upload more than three times a week.

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
And I can totally understand that, guys. I completely understand.

56
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,040
I'm going to try my best to keep this channel inspired, to keep the quality bar, the content bar,

57
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,410
as high as it can be and pump out five videos a week.

58
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,410
Maybe I'll take a break here and there one day or something like that,

59
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,410
but I want to do at least one video every other day.

60
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:51,410
I never wanted to get to a point where the channel is just me pumping out videos just to make them.

61
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,410
When I sit down, guys, to make a video, I want to make sure I'm really inspired to do it,

62
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,410
because this is a whole lot of fun to me.

63
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,410
And I would never want this fun to get dragged down into hell.

64
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,709
So don't expect any quality degradation.

65
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:10,079
This is just me telling you, be on the lookout for more content, baby.

66
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,079
Go watch the 4,000 subscriber video.

67
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,079
It's probably not in your sub box anymore, because I'm an idiot,

68
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,079
and I uploaded it at like one in the morning.

69
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,259
So it'll probably be knocked out of your sub box by now,

70
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:29,779
especially if you like Burger Boy, because Burger Boy makes his triumphant return as the egg.

71
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,779
So what are you guys doing for Halloween?

72
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:34,949
That video was kind of made in the spirit of Halloween.

73
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:37,949
What is your costume going to be, and do you have any ideas?

74
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:42,949
Because me, Burger Boy, an exoskeleton bug body who you've never seen or met before,

75
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:45,949
we're trying to figure out our costumes.

76
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:48,949
It's getting kind of late, so let me know what you're doing and your ideas.

77
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,189
That is going to be the end of this video, guys.

78
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:55,189
Thank you so much for watching. I really appreciate it.

79
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,189
I will see you all next time, and take care, everybody.
