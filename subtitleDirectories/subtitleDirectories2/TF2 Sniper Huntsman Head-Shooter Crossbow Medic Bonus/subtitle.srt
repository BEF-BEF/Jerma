00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,470
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:19,030
This is gonna be a Huntsman sniper and a bonus clip at the very end of a Crusader's crossbow medic.

3
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,589
I got a lot of requests to do that after I mentioned it in my previous video,

4
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:26,429
so there will be a little bonus clip at the end here.

5
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,329
And it has to be mentioned that this is all being recorded on my laptop right now.

6
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,950
I brought a pretty nice microphone with me.

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,429
I'll give you the quick story. If you were not at my live stream, my fail stream last night.

8
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:45,429
So what happened was I had to drive nine and a half hours from Boston to North Carolina

9
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:47,829
because I had to bring my sister's dogs home.

10
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:52,829
My sister has two dogs, two fairly large dogs, not huge or anything by anybody's standards,

11
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,729
but they're pretty big, pretty wild.

12
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:58,829
So we had to drive them. Me and my mother had to drive them down to North Carolina

13
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,329
because you can't really put a dog on a plane anymore.

14
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,810
It's not like considered a good thing to do.

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:09,010
So we just drove them and I ended up being like 25 minutes late from my own live stream.

16
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,439
And if you did come to that live stream, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,739
I'm sorry that it really turned out pretty poorly.

18
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:20,040
I didn't really realize this laptop wasn't powerful enough to do anything.

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,540
We ended up playing Super Meat Boy for a little while.

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,709
So at least that's good. At least we played Meat Boy, right?

21
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,650
Couldn't play Team Fortress at all. It was like two frames a second.

22
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,950
But don't worry though. The good news out of this is I'm leaving here in like two days.

23
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,250
Good to see your family though. Good to visit my sister and her husband.

24
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,450
They have a really nice place in North Carolina. Really beautiful down here.

25
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,650
So it's all good. This video should go up today. I hope it does.

26
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,870
We'll see if the crap laptop can handle it or not.

27
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,969
So playing as the huntsman right now on King of the Hill Badlands,

28
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:55,569
I chose this gameplay because, well, as you can see, I get quite a few headshots in a row.

29
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:58,870
I only get like two or three body shots in the entire gameplay

30
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,469
and I kill like 16 or 17 people. I jumped into this session late.

31
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:07,469
I think there was like two minutes left on the other team or something like that or two minutes on our side.

32
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,280
So it's a fairly short gameplay, but it's very good.

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,580
So talking about the huntsman for just a second here,

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,379
I've been trying to get a good huntsman gameplay for at least like a week or two.

35
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:20,580
And I feel like the huntsman is very, very hit or miss sometimes.

36
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,180
Sometimes you'll jump in a game and you'll destroy with it.

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,080
And other times you'll jump in and you won't be able to hit the broad side of a bond.

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,259
It's a really, really interesting weapon.

39
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:33,860
But if you can really bear down and get in the zone, turn on the zen,

40
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,460
you can do a lot of damage with this thing because the hitboxes are very, very large.

41
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,960
Some people don't know this, but the hitboxes for the huntsman,

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,860
it's a giant square around your enemy target.

43
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,860
So if you shoot and hit somebody like a foot to the left of their leg,

44
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,159
you're going to hit them in the leg.

45
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,960
The boxes are enormous, especially for the head.

46
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,860
If you shoot somebody in the head with this item

47
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,759
and you happen to go maybe like four or five inches off of their ear

48
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,259
or four or five inches above their forehead,

49
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:04,960
you are going to headshot when you should have missed.

50
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,560
But I can totally understand why this is implemented,

51
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,159
because if it was not implemented, if it was totally 100% accurate,

52
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,930
this weapon would probably be impossible to use.

53
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,530
I also have on the Darwin's Danger Shield and not on the Jurati.

54
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,530
That is because specifically I want to be able to fight people one-on-one a little bit better

55
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,629
because King of the Hill is very chaotic and that extra health helps a lot as well.

56
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,129
Because look at my health right now.

57
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:30,629
I should be dead right now.

58
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:31,629
I should not be alive.

59
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,639
If I had 22 health, I would have been dead.

60
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,039
But so anyways, that's going to be the end of this particular gameplay.

61
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,340
Very, very nice little run as the Huntsman sniper.

62
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,539
So we're going to transition now.

63
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:42,139
I got a lot of requests to do this,

64
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,740
and this is an interesting gameplay coming up here.

65
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,340
I figured because I'm using the Crusader's Crossbow,

66
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,740
it makes complete sense to put it in a Huntsman gameplay.

67
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm not really sure if I'll do a full round like this, but I might.

68
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,340
Who knows?

69
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,939
So this is a stipulation match.

70
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,539
I could turn this into a new series.

71
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:03,680
I actually may do that, but stipulation match, what does that mean?

72
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,479
It means I'm only allowed to use the Crusader's Crossbow and the Amputator.

73
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,680
I am not allowed to use that Kritzkrieg,

74
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,479
so I have to heal everybody and do any damage

75
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,279
only with the Crossbow and the Amputator.

76
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,779
And it actually turns out pretty well.

77
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,579
If you are unfamiliar with this item,

78
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,480
I'll give you a little bit of backstory on it.

79
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,959
I guess this item can be really described as the Team Fortress Classic item.

80
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,060
If none of you guys played Team Fortress Classic,

81
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,600
this is the only Medic item that really kind of comes from Team Fortress Classic.

82
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
So what you could do as a Medic in the original game

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
is you could go around and heal people

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and you could damage your enemies with the same item.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,600
Those mechanics from Team Fortress Classic came through over to this weapon

86
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,779
and I've got to say this is one of the worst loadout options for the Medic

87
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:54,379
and it can be okay though.

88
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,480
I will tell you why it's okay to equip this

89
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,480
because if you put the Amputator on as well,

90
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:03,079
you are going to see a plus one bonus to your health regeneration,

91
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,980
which can really help sometimes.

92
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,980
I've been in a lot of situations where I have the Blutsauger on

93
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,980
and I'm losing minus two health every second

94
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,779
and a lot of people don't even realize that's happening.

95
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:15,279
But it can be a pretty big deal.

96
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,680
If you just want to play straight up healing Medic,

97
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,579
I would say put these two things on.

98
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:22,579
If you're not the type of person that's going to run around with the Blutsauger out

99
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:25,879
or try and smash people in the face with the Ubersaw,

100
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,579
definitely put these two things on.

101
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:30,149
It will help you a lot when it comes to healing.

102
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:32,250
So talking about the gameplay for just a second here,

103
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,350
I get this Soldier killed because I couldn't get him with an arrow.

104
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,050
He was probably really mad about that

105
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,949
and if that was you, I am sorry, I do apologize for that,

106
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,850
but I get a crit right in that Scout's face

107
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,949
and this is kind of weird right here.

108
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,649
This Pyro gets on the point.

109
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,449
This is the end of the gameplay by the way

110
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:51,149
and a Pyro gets on here and I think he HL2.exe crashes

111
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:52,829
because look at him, he's just standing here.

112
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,629
I guarantee you something happened.

113
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:57,230
Either he lagged out or his mum was calling him for dinner or something.

114
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,339
I have no idea, but that's going to wrap it up.

115
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,740
Like I said, thank you guys so much for watching.

116
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,839
I really do appreciate it and I will see you all next time.

117
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,240
So take care everybody.
