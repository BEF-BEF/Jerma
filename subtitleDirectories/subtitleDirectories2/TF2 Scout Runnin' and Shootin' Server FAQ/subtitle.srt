00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,779
Hey, what's up everybody. Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary. And

2
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:21,300
tonight, gonna be playing as the Scout with the Default Scattergun, the Criticola, and

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,920
the Candy Cane. Yeah, the Candy Cane. And in this gameplay, it's on King of the Hill Harvest.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,660
This is on my new server. The IP of which will be in the description. Go check it out.

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,619
Go play on it. There's no reserve slots or no admins really there yet. Except for me,

6
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:41,539
I think Boo, Stealth, and Burger Boy are the admins at this point right now. But there

7
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:45,060
will be more. I don't know how I'm gonna do this, guys. I'm trying to figure out a way

8
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,140
to get people reserve slots without giving out a million of them. Because what I don't

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,700
want to have happen is this. I don't want to give out 50 reserve slots and have the

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,939
same 50 people, the only ones I can play in the server. I don't want that to happen. So

11
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:02,619
I might not even do reserve slots. I'm still going back and forth in my brain trying to

12
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:06,739
figure it out. But there will be admins. You can get admin. I don't know how that's

13
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:11,510
going to work though. I will make that very clear in a future video. So don't worry.

14
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,239
If you're trying to figure that out, do not worry.

15
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,040
So another thing, a really important thing about the server. I want to answer a couple

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,319
of frequently asked questions about this server. And I'll start right now right off the bat

17
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:27,780
while this game plays in the background. So it is a 24-7 server. It is not 8 to 8 in the

18
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,069
morning or something. It is all 24-7 dedicated. It's not like sitting right here in my backyard

19
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,870
It is in New York City. I think it also says New Jersey on it too. I'm not exactly sure

20
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,549
where the town is. But if you live in New York City or around there, you're probably

21
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:49,760
going to have like two ping. So that's pretty cool. Second thing I get all the time is what

22
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,379
are the custom mods and the plugins you're going to add and all that stuff eventually.

23
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:58,379
So let me start with my favorite one. Eventually on that server, there is going to be the friendly

24
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:03,500
fire spawn kill mod. I have no idea what it's called. All I know is I want it. There's something

25
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,780
about just the pure chaos in the setup time of a game. People just destroying each other

26
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,319
in the spawns. I think that will be there at some point. Another thing that's going

27
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,680
to be there at some point is probably something like HL stats or game stats. One of those

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,319
stat tracking programs. Because I used to love when I had a favorite server in Team

29
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,360
Fortress, I would always do slash rank, wanted to see where I was compared to everybody else.

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,199
And I think that's an innate thing that we all love to do as Team Fortress players. And

31
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,240
even just FPS players in general, you always love to see where you are in regards to other

32
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,639
people. So that will be there soon. Probably HL stats X, only because that's the one I'm

33
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,479
the most familiar with. And when all these things get installed, once I do all these

34
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,919
mods and once I do all these different plugins and stuff like that, we're going to have to

35
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:53,800
really experiment because I have no idea if they're ever going to work. I might turn the

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,000
server on one day, install one of these plugins and it's like, Oh, German, the server exploded.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,599
Whoops. So I don't want that to happen. I want to slowly, gradually get these things

38
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:09,719
installed to have the least amount of headaches and the least amount of downtime that I could

39
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,939
possibly have. So one of the last things that people asked me and people wanted to make

40
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:19,819
sure was theirs, there are no random criticals on that server. I turned them off tonight.

41
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:25,419
Well, tonight, oh my goodness, it's like three in the morning. So earlier tonight, I turned

42
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:30,500
them off. We tested it. It worked. So there are no more random crits on that server. There

43
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,620
is still damage spread though. I'm not going to turn off damage spread. I'm also not going

44
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,659
to turn off pellet spread. I'm going to keep it all as the defaults, all as out of the

45
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:44,780
box TF2, except for the no crits. And the reason why I'm doing that is I just feel like new

46
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,460
players when you're in a no crit server and no spread, everything, it's very hard to do

47
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,180
well if you're new. So I just wanted to keep it as default as I can. And I guess you could

48
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,819
say that those are my reasons. So that is the end of the server talk. And one thing

49
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,860
I wanted to bring up before that this video is over is I tried to get a stipulation match

50
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,139
tonight, and I couldn't do it. I think the item servers are down for Team Fortress, or

51
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:11,740
at least they were for like a good long two or three, four hour period when I was trying

52
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,560
to play. So if those item servers come back, that's probably the next video you're going

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,180
to see is a stipulation match. I'm not going to tell you which class and what stipulation

54
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,720
it is, because I know a lot of you guys like to be surprised by that. So I will keep my

55
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,240
lips sealed. I'll keep that a secret. And one last thing before I got forgot this. Oh

56
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,639
my goodness, I forgot Diablo three comes out in like three days. I already have the thing

57
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,120
pre purchased. It's going to own my life. And you're going to see a lot of content on

58
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Diablo three. And my question for this video to you guys, please let me know in the comment

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,439
section. What type of videos do you think you would like to watch? If you were to watch

60
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:53,199
Diablo three? Do you want to see class breakdowns? Do you want to see kind of like more of a let's

61
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,879
play like highlights, boss kills? What do you think you guys would like to see in Diablo

62
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,319
three for videos? That is my question of the video guys. Thank you all so much for watching.

63
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,879
I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys all soon. So take care, everybody.
