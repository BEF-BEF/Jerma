Okay, so

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,960
Apparently this house may or may not be haunted. I

8
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:48,000
Highly doubt that it's not haunted. So we're gonna do some investigating pot throw it on the ground

00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:55,389
Okay, bugs on the ground squash them. All right. So now is it gonna let me leave? Let's hope so

00:02:55,389 --> 00:03:04,120
Get me out of here. Got the lamp. I still can't get out of this friggin room

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,090
How did I miss this door? I'm an idiot

28
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:44,740
Mmm-hmm. I think there's a cat in my room and it's freaking me out cuz I think I don't know what the noises are
