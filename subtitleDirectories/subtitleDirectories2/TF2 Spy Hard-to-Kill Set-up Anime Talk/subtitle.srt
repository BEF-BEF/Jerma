00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,789
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,

2
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:20,230
Otto in the background again, making all kinds of weird noises. But anyways, gonna be playing

3
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:27,190
as the spy tonight, using the strange dead ringer, the Letronger and the Big Earner.

4
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:32,469
And in the title somewhere, it probably says, the live forever setup or something like that.

5
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:36,950
Let me just briefly explain what I mean by that. So the Big Earner, if you don't know,

6
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,829
when you backstab somebody, you get cloak. Same thing with the Letronger, if you shoot

7
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,210
somebody you get cloak, and the dead ringer lets you fake your death. So what happens,

8
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,509
what ends up happening in most of the gameplays you use this with, you will get a backstab,

9
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,710
fill up your cloak, be able to pull the dead ringer out, you're alive. You get out of

10
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,630
the dead ringer, somebody sees you, you can't backstab them, shoot them two or three times,

11
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:03,509
let the dead ringer rinse and repeat. Now this may or may not be total overkill, but

12
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:07,269
I like to use weird setups sometimes, like to mess around with the loadouts. And this

13
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:11,560
actually does work pretty well, because as a spy, I used to be a really good spy back

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,280
in the old days, back in like 2007. And then once all the loadout options came out, all

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,719
the variables came out, I started to lose my spy deal, I started to not really do as

16
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,959
well as I used to. So stuff like this, any way that I can help myself play spy better,

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,549
I'm going to try it out. I guess the real downside to using this setup is of course

18
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,189
if you have full cloak and you backstab somebody, you're not going to get any cloak added to

19
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:43,579
your bar there because there's no over cloak. Oh my god, I just thought of like a new item.

20
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:47,640
What if there was an item that gave you over cloak, like an over heel, like if you got

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,519
over heeled, you got over cloaked. Oh, maybe I'm just going off on a weird tangent there.

22
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:57,680
But anyways, playing on King of the Hill Harvest right now, and I got to tell you, playing

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,359
on King of the Hill maps, they're like really the only places I can play spy anymore. I

24
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:07,120
can't play on payload anymore, I can't play on control point, I seem to die instantly.

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,599
Right when I kill somebody, I always just die. I'll get one backstab die, get one backstab

26
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,330
die. But back in the day, back when this game was in its real infancy stages, I was really,

27
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,590
really good at the spy. And I think I know what's happening. What's happened is a lot

28
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,949
of the players that have played this game for a long time, and even some of the free

29
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:32,270
new players, everybody's just getting better at this game. So it is definitely, definitely

30
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:37,430
getting harder to fool people. Because it's the whole adage, fool me once, shame on me.

31
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,280
Fool me twice, shame on you. I said that wrong. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice,

32
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,639
shame on me. There we go. I got it. But it's that old adage. It's, you know, you fool somebody

33
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,960
enough times, they're not going to get fooled anymore. And I think that's what's happening

34
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,439
in Team Fortress is, at least when I play spy, I feel like everybody knows exactly where

35
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,599
I am, where I'm going, and that sort of thing. And like I said, this can be totally attributed

36
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,400
to people just getting better at the game. And I love to see that, guys. I love to see

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,759
people getting really good at Team Fortress, because that means people are playing it.

38
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,800
You got to remember, to be able to be good at something, you have to really put time

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,240
into it. So to see these people all doing very, very well in a lot of the servers I

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,689
play on, it's great because it means Team Fortress is still alive and still running

41
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,370
And then they're going to tell their friends, once they're good enough, and once they know

42
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,289
how awesome the game is, they're going to tell their friends, their friends are going

43
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:35,960
to tell their friends, and Team Fortress hopefully will stay strong forever. And it's actually

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,500
getting a lot more attention than you'd think. A lot of the big YouTubers now, a lot of the

45
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,860
big commentators are starting to play Team Fortress. They're starting to get into it,

46
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,620
and they're starting to say, holy crap, this game is really fun. And they're going to start

47
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,860
making content on that. So stay tuned, but you're probably going to see a lot more Team

48
00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:00,780
Fortress pop up in the YouTube scene in the very near future. That's my German prediction.

49
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,539
So I got to tell you one more thing before this video. There's only like another minute

50
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:09,610
or two in this video. Can I tell you my addiction lately? I mean, really, I've been so addicted

51
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,990
to a television show, the last week or so, I've watched every single episode and I can't

52
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:20,389
wait to see the movie now. In my Q&A a long time ago, I talked about Fullmetal Alchemist

53
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:25,430
and how I watched it. Not really a big anime person, but I did get into it and I did love

54
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:31,470
it. So I found out recently that they made a new one. They made a new Fullmetal Alchemist

55
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,829
Brotherhood. And I couldn't believe it. I was like, oh my God. And I actually remember

56
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:41,149
reading some comments on that Q&A video of people saying, you should watch the new FMA.

57
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:44,629
You should watch the new FMA. And I was like, what are you talking about? I remember looking

58
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:48,649
up stuff on it. And it looked like it was the same thing. I was like, did they just

59
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:55,649
remake this? But no, no, my God, it's a totally different story. It totally follows the comments

60
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,170
or the manga, I think is what it's called. And it is amazing. I got to tell you, if you

61
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,129
are an anime fan or you like anime at all, go watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.

62
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:11,670
It is really, really good. And when I say I, I mean we, me and Burger Boy have watched

63
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:17,269
every single episode. And we've also trying to get tickets to go to the movie in Boston.

64
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:21,269
I think it opens April 12th or something like that. So that should be fun. And that's just

65
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,790
I've been totally addicted to lately. The characters, the story, everything is so good.

66
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,709
I think it's better than the first one. If you were a fan of the first one, watch the

67
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:34,660
second one and then tell me you don't like the second one more. And I guess a follow

68
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,819
up to this would be in the comment section, if you know any other animes that are really

69
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,300
good that I would enjoy, if I like Fullmetal Alchemist, leave me a comment of a different

70
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,800
anime I would like. And I'll tell you to preface that, to preface that, I'm not big into anime

71
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,800
and I don't really like the goofy type anime where everyone's always like screaming and

72
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,120
yelling and like laughing and stuff like that. I like the serious type of anime where, you know,

73
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,720
there's like blood and fight scenes and characters and stuff. I'm not a big fan of the, let's just

74
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,939
say like the Sailor Moon type anime. But yeah, that's going to wrap up this video guys. Thank

75
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:15,180
you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And I will check you guys all next time.

76
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,980
So take care, everybody.
