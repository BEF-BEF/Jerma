1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:17,379
Oh, oh god, this is the best item they've ever put in the game. I need this. I need it.

2
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:28,129
Yeah, this is a pretty good spot on the beach. Just being like a fat motherfuckers sitting here drinking my beer.

3
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,020
Oh my god, I don't have to do anything.

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:41,299
Look at this soldier down here. He's like, what is going on up there? Oh, oh no, oh shit. Hey.

5
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,189
This looks like a pretty good spot.

6
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,939
Come on, somebody come up the stairs.

7
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,990
Somebody on red team come check this area. Because like what could possibly be going on up here besides

8
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,799
He just like turned.

9
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,120
This guy is just like, oh.

10
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:25,780
I love this game so much. Valve, seriously? Seriously, you guys have like outdone yourselves.

11
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,890
Please come back and kill me. I'm so useless.

12
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:40,060
How many kills can I get? We're just sitting down in a chair. There's one.

13
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:47,939
I moved it down here, set up the chair. Let's see. If I get more than two or three kills, then this is just like absurd.

14
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:57,859
Spice up in my shaw, damn it. I gotta get up off my seat now. Oh, that's a bunch of bullshit.

15
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:03,180
You know building centuries is sure is tough work.

16
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,340
A lot of people don't realize the amount of craftsmanship that goes into making one of these things.

17
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,659
Where you need the right kind of aluminum alloy metal. That takes a while to get and it's very stressful.

18
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:17,099
You got all kinds of scouts fucking with you. Can't you see how busy I am right now?

19
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,819
That's a spy. That's a spy.

20
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,180
Did I really just do something? I just blocked a spy from walking through.

21
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:33,370
Why didn't he attack me? I feel like I'm watching a movie.

22
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:36,729
Don't you feel like he's at a movie theater and he's seeing the projector in front of him?

23
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:45,509
Yes, it's a pretty good show. I think I've seen better though.
