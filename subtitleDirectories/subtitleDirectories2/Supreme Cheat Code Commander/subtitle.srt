1
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:13,550
The question will be answered, tonight, who in fact is the supreme commander of the armies at hand?

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,980
What the hell, what the fuck was that?

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,980
I said I'm not ready.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,480
Why are you not ready?

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
I got a cat.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
You don't have a cat.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,920
It's getting everywhere, there's hair in my mic.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
You don't have...

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,609
You take your little guy, and you generate the power by putting the nodes on the things,

10
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:37,609
and you build buildings to build units, and then I just fucking stomp you.

11
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,109
I think this is going to take too long.

12
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:41,109
I don't think it's going to take too long.

13
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,109
I'm just going to kill you right now.

14
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:45,109
What did you just do?

15
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:46,109
What the fuck is this?

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,950
Gig.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,829
Oh, oh, look at, look at what's going on on the bottom there.

18
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:58,829
Oh, Ster is cheating, and fucking like, it's just blinking.

19
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,899
It's just blinking on the bottom of my screen.

20
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,400
You could blink in StarCraft, that wasn't considered cheating, it was an ability.

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,900
I'm playing Protoss.

22
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,519
How do you cheat?

23
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,019
Cheat, activate.

24
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,150
How do you do that?

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,150
You open up the console, and you type the cheat.

26
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,150
I don't know what that is, I'm trying to like, make my units, I'm trying to like, feed my like,

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,150
soldiers and shit, and you overhear, cheat.

28
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:30,329
You teleported in here.

29
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:34,769
What is happening?

30
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:36,840
What is happening?

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
What is happening?

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
I don't know what this is.

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,840
This is like, my game is...

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,049
This is going to break the game.

35
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:50,870
I thought my game just broke, but I accidentally clicked out of it.

36
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,370
Alright, so gentlemen's rules.

37
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,370
No attacking.

38
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:59,370
Do not attack me, I'm not going to attack you, until we both have a thousand units.

39
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,370
Okay?

40
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,370
Yeah, okay.

41
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,079
Are those all air guys?

42
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,079
What the heck are those?

43
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,079
Yeah, these are all planes.

44
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,319
And there's so many units, dude, they have nowhere to go.

45
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,289
They're all turning into this one like, blob in the middle.

46
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:18,289
It's like sucking up, it's sucking up the planes into like, one giant plane.

47
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,460
Do you see this?

48
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,460
No, I'm busy making my own suck up planes.

49
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,460
It's like...

50
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,460
This is turning into like, just a...

51
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,460
Oh dear god.

52
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,460
I don't even want to know what's going to happen with this.

53
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,169
The game's going to start to freak out.

54
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:35,169
And not know what the hell is going on.

55
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:37,990
I almost have a thousand units.

56
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,990
Whoa, whoa, where are they going?

57
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,990
Where are you guys going?

58
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,990
I don't know, they're coming to attack me.

59
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,990
No, no, no, no, no, no!

60
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,990
Pull back!

61
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,990
What are they doing?

62
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,990
I'm trying, I'm trying to pull back!

63
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,990
I'm trying!

64
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,990
They won't listen!

65
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,990
They have a mind of their own, I can't...

66
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,990
They won't listen to me!

67
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,990
I guess that's just what happens when you have a thousand units.

68
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,990
Get out of here!

69
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,180
I'm trying to pull it back!

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,180
Holy shit!

71
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,180
No, you fucking idiot!

72
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,180
I'm trying!

73
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,180
Don't engage!

74
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,180
What are you doing?

75
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,180
You're not supposed to engage!

76
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,180
Now it's just a mess!

77
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,180
Just pull back!

78
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,180
Look what you've done!

79
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,180
You've brought everybody!

80
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,180
I have!

81
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,180
You've brought everybody!

82
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,180
No!

83
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,180
You attacked one person in all of this!

84
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,180
It just looks like a firework exploded!

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,180
My game's running very slowly, by the way.

86
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,180
I can't even...

87
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,180
You did this.

88
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,180
You shouldn't have attacked.

89
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,680
No, you attacked!

90
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
All your guys were coming at me!

91
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
And you didn't pull any of them back!

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
You select and you right-click!

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Select and then right-click!

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
I did!

95
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,770
Look at the gravity!

96
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,610
What is happening?

97
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,039
I don't know!

98
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,039
Where did those guys go?

99
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:53,370
What are they still shooting at?

100
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,830
I hope you're happy.

101
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:02,400
You're gonna build a bunch of turrets.

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
And I'm coming after you with GS Rats.

103
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
So you build as many turrets as you possibly can.

104
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,460
If you change your mind later, there's air turrets and there's ground turrets.

105
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,460
Don't be like, okay, now it's the air units.

106
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,460
Let's see how this goes.

107
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,459
Like, it's not gonna happen.

108
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,459
No, I'm coming at you with GS Rats.

109
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,459
I'm gonna build a thousand rats and you're gonna build towers.

110
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,459
You ready?

111
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,399
We'll start typing bling-bling!

112
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,399
If you select them all too and do the alt-T,

113
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,399
you can keep them in a tiny, a small area.

114
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,399
Wait, wait, wait.

115
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,399
If I select everybody...

116
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,399
Select them all and do alt-T where your cursor is pointing.

117
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,769
Alt-T.

118
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:35,769
Alt-T.

119
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:40,259
Didn't do anything.

120
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,259
Oh dear, dude!

121
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,759
My FPS!

122
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,060
Oh man!

123
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,060
Why did you tell me to do that?

124
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,060
I don't know.

125
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,060
It looks like you got a little planet there.

126
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,360
Oh, don't zoom in and look at them.

127
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
I cannot zoom in, no.

128
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
Yeah, zoom out and just...

129
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Oh dear, why did you have me do that?

130
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,500
Why did you make me do that?

131
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,000
I can't even look over there.

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No, I need to spread them out.

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I need to, like, pull them out.

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Because I can't even go over there.

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Wait, I heard a launch.

136
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What do you mean?

137
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
No, no, no, no.

138
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
We spent so much time.

139
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
We spent so much time doing this.

140
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
We didn't spend that much time.

141
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,500
No, dude, please don't tell me you just dropped a fucking bomb.

142
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
I mean, you teleported them all there.

143
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
What a waste of fucking time.

144
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
No, that's so good.

145
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
You broke the whole rat colony.

146
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,079
Uh, here they come.

147
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,079
Okay, well...

148
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,089
Come on, rats.

149
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:37,089
I've got a good view angle of this.

150
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:39,089
Break through the defenses!

151
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:43,089
Let's see if they get even close to me.

152
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:44,089
Where are they going?

153
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,589
They're, like, wrapping around here.

154
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:48,829
Oh my god, I have so many, like, pop-ups

155
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:50,829
that's telling me, like, your game's broken.

156
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:54,579
No, they're not getting anywhere near it.

157
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:56,579
Come on, stop, like, bunching up, like, traffic

158
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:58,579
and push in.

159
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:01,139
They haven't even breached the wall yet.

160
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,139
Like, half of them aren't moving.

161
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:05,379
Yeah, what are they doing?

162
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:07,379
You idiots!

163
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:09,379
Some of them are just standing completely still.

164
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, wow, this is fucking awful.

165
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
They're all going up the mountain and instantly dying.

166
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,740
It's because of the wall, I think.

167
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,740
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

168
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,740
Dude, they're just walking into the wall!

169
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,740
They're making themselves a choke point

170
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,740
and just getting shot to death

171
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,740
when they walk through it.

172
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,740
Like, over here by this stupid, like, fucking underpass.

173
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,740
They really are like ants.
