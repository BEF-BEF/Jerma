00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,570
Hey, what is happening guys? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,570
Let's get right into this here. I'm playing as the Eternal Reward Spy.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,570
If you are noticing, you're probably saying to yourself,

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,870
Jerma, Eternal Reward? Holy sheep crap, that's insane. I thought you were terrible with this knife.

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,870
And I would reply to that, yes I am actually very bad with this knife,

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,870
but I happen to get a couple of gameplays in a row on Viaduct.

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,870
This is not the Halloween event Viaduct. This is normal Viaduct.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,869
And it's actually been a while since I've done my last Spy gameplay.

9
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,869
Kind of crazy seeing as how last month I think is my last Spy gameplay.

10
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:43,869
And I've never done an Eternal Reward gameplay. I did one.

11
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:48,420
I did one Eternal Reward gameplay and it was like,

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,420
it was just me yelling about how I hate the weapon and how I was pissed about it or something.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,490
So here is a proper Eternal Reward gameplay.

14
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,490
Two of them in a row, both of them on Viaduct.

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,490
And there's something in the middle, something you guys might think is funny.

16
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,489
Something I just decided to do because I'm an idiot sometimes.

17
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,730
The loadout I'm going to be using is the Eternal Reward obviously.

18
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,730
The Cloak and Dagger and the Default Spy Revolver.

19
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,969
Gonna tell you what I'm doing right here, just waiting for someone to come out of spawn.

20
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:20,969
Someone I can get behind because right now I'm disguised as an enemy Heavy.

21
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:23,969
And they move very slowly so I want to get a different disguise.

22
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:25,969
Don't want to keep the one I have right now.

23
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:30,969
Swinging the knife to get the extra movement speed and I end up catching up to this Medic.

24
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:35,969
That's a quick tip for you, if you are currently disguised as a slow class, do this.

25
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:40,209
Swing the knife when you get close to somebody and make sure nobody's behind you when you do it.

26
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:45,209
Because this is your only means of disguising so you don't want to give yourself away too quickly.

27
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,209
Here comes a face stab right there, that's happened to me, happens to you too.

28
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,209
It sucks for all of us.

29
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:54,510
Currently as a Soldier right now and there's nothing I can do about this.

30
00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:01,510
That's my biggest complaint about this knife, is the fact that I have to stay a Soldier and I have to be a slow bastard.

31
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,510
And there's nothing I can do about it besides cloak and run away.

32
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,689
So that's why I'm terrible with this knife, I never got good with it.

33
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,689
Could never really get the mechanic down.

34
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:14,689
I know a lot of people are really good with this knife and I give them props.

35
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:18,060
I commend you for being able to play with this knife.

36
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,060
Spy standing still disguised as me is always going to die.

37
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,060
Trying to help these engineers, I thought he might have been a dead ringer but it's not the case.

38
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,060
We have a flawless victory going right now, they don't stand a chance at all.

39
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,060
3 minutes on our side, less than 15 seconds to go on theirs.

40
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,229
I top frag in this gameplay and I top frag in the second one.

41
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:43,229
So I'm going to do a little transition here, I want to show you this absolutely ridiculous thing that I did.

42
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,229
I am so ashamed of it.

43
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:47,229
So we're going to play a game, it's a game show I made up.

44
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:48,659
And it's called...

45
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,439
Absolutely fantastic! John, tell him what he's won!

46
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,680
You've won a free subscription to this diagram.

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,680
It's only one issue and it tells you why you're so stupid.

48
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,250
Here we are on the second gameplay guys.

49
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,250
I can't believe I did that.

50
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,250
I really don't believe it.

51
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,250
When I do things like that, I really surprise myself at how just stupid I can really be.

52
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,250
Why would you jump off the... I don't even know, I'm not even going to begin to explain why I did that.

53
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,680
So you're probably wondering why this is starting so late.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:44,680
It's because the other team was being spawn camped and I was literally just sitting there with the cloak and dagger doing absolutely nothing.

55
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,919
So I figured why not just skip that part, you don't want to see it anyways, it's pretty boring.

56
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,919
I managed to get behind everybody here and I get a couple of stabs.

57
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,919
Want the extra speed so I go after the soldier, what is with the soldiers for me in this gameplay?

58
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,919
I seem to only have soldier disguises.

59
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,159
Well we changed that right here, turned into a sniper.

60
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,159
Really quickly want to talk about the knife mechanics.

61
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,159
How they're interesting, how they're cool and why they can work in some situations.

62
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:17,339
Especially when you get yourself into a crowd of people and you have a disguise already.

63
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,339
Sometimes people don't even know what's going on.

64
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:28,339
I've had situations where I've seen an internal reward spy, backstab somebody, see them backstab the person and just my brain explodes.

65
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,339
I go wait, what happened, who's that?

66
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:33,639
Because your brain is trying to piece together what it's actually seeing.

67
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,639
Oh that's a soldier that just instantly turned into a medic.

68
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:45,879
It's crazy and it really works sometimes and some people can put this knife to such good use where they'll turn a corner, backstab the engineer that's next to you.

69
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,879
You turn around, see the engineer that's already been there, that's always been there.

70
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,879
And then you turn back around and get backstabbed by the same spy.

71
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,879
It's a great way to play spy.

72
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,879
I, like I said, just am not very good at it.

73
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,180
Kind of screwed up right there, but I deceived this sniper enough where I can get the backstab on him.

74
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,180
Come up here, I see a scout and I believe a pyro.

75
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,180
I get the backstabs on both of them.

76
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,180
Then I get killed, there's the one on the scout, there's the one on the pyro.

77
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,360
Turn around and a heavy medic peer is right behind me, get killed by them, can't get away in time.

78
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
And that is going to wrap it up here.

79
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
That's the end of the gameplay.

80
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
They get overtime, but it doesn't really matter.

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
We still win.

82
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Thank you so much guys.

83
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
If you like this video, throw me a like.

84
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
I'll see you all next time.

85
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Take care everybody.
