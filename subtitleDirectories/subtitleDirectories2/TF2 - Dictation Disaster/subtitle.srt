Dear Tom, new paragraph. Can you please send me the images we talked about yesterday?

2
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:30,820
Question mark. I would appreciate it. Period. New paragraph. Thanks, new line.

3
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:40,829
Germa. Tosh Meston. That's close enough. It's time to control Team Fortress 2, only by talking.

4
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:59,359
Walk. Walk. Left. Right. Walk. Strafe right. Back. Strafe right. Strafe right. No, left.

5
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:17,920
Left. Left. Straight. Walk. Walk. Left. Right. Right. Shoot. Shoot. Back. Back. Back. Shoot. Back.

6
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:33,099
Strafe right. Turn left. Left. Shoot. Back. Shoot. Hopefully I reload. Okay, good.

7
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:38,780
I'm gonna have to just stand here. I'm not gonna be able to kill any person, by the way, doing this.

8
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:51,579
Right. Right. Walk. Strafe left. Shoot. Shoot. Strafe left. Strafe left. God damn it.

9
00:01:51,579 --> 00:02:10,120
Walk. Shoot. Up. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Left. Shoot. Left. Shoot.

10
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:26,280
Shoot. Back. Back. Up. Back. Back. Detonate.

11
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,520
I'm pretty much a bot on easy at this point. No, I'm doing worse. I'm doing worse than a bot would do on easy in this game.

12
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,759
I'm essentially the kitty cone of Team Fortress 2 right now. You wouldn't even sell me to an adult.

13
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:56,349
This is gonna be the one. Cloak. Walk. Stab. Right. Left. Walk. Stab. Yes! I got two people.

14
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:59,419
And all it took was to be a cloak and dagger in the corner.

15
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:22,639
Walk. Up. Fire. Fire. Back. Left. Shoot. Right. Right. Strafe left. Strafe left. God damn it. Listen to me.

16
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:28,210
Don't crit-screak me. Do not crit-screak me. That's a big mistake.

17
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,210
If you crit-screak me, you're gonna be real damn sad, I'll tell you that.

18
00:03:31,210 --> 00:04:01,289
Strafe right. Left. Strafe right. Walk. Right. Walk. Fire. Left. Left. Left. Right. Fire. Up. Shoot. Right. Right. Fire. Down. Shoot.

19
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:08,740
God, that happened so much later. I'm gonna have to do that as if I'm shooting a Huntsman bow at somebody.

20
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:26,110
Shoot. Oh, come on. Shoot. Right. Right. Zoom in. Right click. Why did I- I'm forgetting my commands. Right click. Right click. Left. Shoot.

21
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:46,750
Fuck. Right. Left. This is a fucking da- Stop. This is really dangerous. Right. Right. Right. I'm gonna fall off. Bugs. Stop. Duh. Walk. Stop.

22
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:52,509
Stop. I knew it. I knew I was gonna fall. There's no way I could have made it past that.

23
00:04:52,509 --> 00:05:07,040
Because the delay is long enough where it doesn't matter what I say. Stop. Back. Tree. Shoot. Good job. Good job. You shot the fucking stairwell.

24
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:40,670
Down. Oh, fuck. Walk. Stop. Fire. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. He's dead. He's already dead. Left. Left. Cloak. Walk. Stab. Got ya. I got him.

25
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:48,449
I'm so excited about that. Oh, yes. I got that one person. Awesome. We're about to lose the game.

26
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:07,769
...to make sure you know that I tried to make a fun video. Unfortunately, comma, unfortunately, that didn't turn out so well.

27
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:18,939
My hypothesis and my experimentations were not happening as well as I planned. And I'm really sorry it'll never happen again, Tom. Please don't fire me. I hope we can still be best friends.

28
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:34,160
Your...your...thank you again. Comma. Period. New paragraph. Cherma. 900-800-500. Your favorite employee.
