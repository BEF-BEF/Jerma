1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,210
You know, before we play a game like this, I think it's safe to say I should take a little swig of whiskey.

2
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,730
This is free-for-all? Is that how this works?

3
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,589
Oh, you use a kick too? I think it's just free-for-all.

4
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:29,589
Dude, I just blew that guy's head open.

5
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:33,149
Wanna go? Wanna go a shit-shooter, McGee?

6
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,149
This guy over here. Don't worry, don't worry.

7
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,149
Oh! Bang! Shit!

8
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:41,990
Oh, I got fists. I got a knife too, right?

9
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, I got a knife. Oh, you can throw knives!

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,270
There's an explosion over here.

11
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,579
Shit! I'm gonna get...

12
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:56,219
What? Oh, he's still alive!

13
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,780
Not anymore!

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,780
Oh, dude, you can have two things at the same time?

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,780
This is just like the old West!

16
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,280
Where is somebody? I need to kill someone.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,549
Come here, you bastard!

18
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:13,180
Wee-hoo! Wee-hoo!

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,180
Somebody behind me, right?

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,000
Uh, don't kill me.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,159
This one has six shots? Yeah, six shooter.

22
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,560
Somebody behind me too! Shit! No!

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
Oh! Oh!

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,060
Oh!

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,620
That was a pretty good arcing knife throw.

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,430
That's fun. That's cool. I really like that.

27
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,719
That's a really cool feature.

28
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,370
Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Don't block me, bro!

29
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,060
Where is he? Where are you? Where'd you go?

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:01,140
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Let me out of here!

31
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,140
I'm gonna throw this and turn around and just blast this dude.

32
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,140
Come on! Yes! Nice.

33
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,060
Gotta keep the streak going. Gotta keep the streak going.

34
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,199
It's all about those streaks.

35
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,439
Guys on my team. That guy ain't.

36
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,810
Whatever. Screw this.

37
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,810
Death from above. You don't even know him right here.

38
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,810
You have no idea. You have no clue what's about to happen to you.

39
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:28,770
Yeah, you did. It's a team deathmatch, right?

40
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,770
Yeah, I'm on your team.

41
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,770
Don't go to shoot. Don't shoot. Hold your fire.

42
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,569
There you go. Nice teamwork. Nice teamwork.

43
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:39,569
We got another bastard coming in here.

44
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,090
I only got two shots left.

45
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,090
I didn't get him.

46
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,090
And now I got a long ass reload here.

47
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,090
Good save.

48
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,780
Good save, dude.

49
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,780
It didn't even matter. It was for nothing.

50
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,219
So I heard you wanted to fuck with the guy with dynamite in his hand.

51
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:02,219
Is that true?

52
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,229
You gotta be kidding me. I did not really mean to do that.

53
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:07,229
You can hold it for a long time.

54
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,659
I can hold this for a long time.

55
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,659
Come on. Walk down these stairs.

56
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:17,539
Yes!

57
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:24,560
Yes!

58
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
I can hold this dynamite for a long ass time.

59
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,590
Oh, that's a doof-er.

60
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,590
That's a doof-er.

61
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,219
Special. $2.99.

62
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,500
See you in the checkout lane.

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Never turn your back on a spy.

64
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,349
We're gonna go for a Hail Mary here.

65
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:48,349
I'm gonna try just to destroy this guy when he comes through.

66
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:54,159
Hail Mary!

67
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,229
Got him. You like that Hail Mary?

68
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:00,240
That knife throw is one of the funnest things. I love it.

69
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,180
Damn.

70
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,319
Crouch. He can't hit you.

71
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,219
That guy's on my team. Why is he shooting me?

72
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:13,810
I don't think I have any more knives left.

73
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,810
This single shot shooter thing is awesome.

74
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,139
This game's pretty fun.

75
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,019
This trajectory is very odd.

76
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:29,019
Come on up the stairs.

77
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,019
Where is he? Yeah, up there.

78
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:33,019
Watch your head. You're a little too tall for this ride.

79
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:35,329
I took his hat flew off.

80
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:38,779
Did you see that?

81
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,779
This thing goes so fast.

82
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,779
It is such a fast moving projectile.

83
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:46,750
It's crazy.

84
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,750
Bites going on. I can hear dynamite.

85
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,189
I can hear all kinds of stuff.

86
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:54,370
That was too unkillable. Good.

87
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,370
Dynamite! Jesus!

88
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,699
This hatchet is scary business, man.

89
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,699
Nobody even understands.

90
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,879
The hatchet wielder is coming.

91
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,000
What? Okay.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He's dead. It's alright. We're good.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,180
I hit him in the nuts.

94
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,180
I hit that guy right in the balls with the hatchet.

95
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,569
And I don't have a weapon now. I gotta go recover that.

96
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:25,660
Kick his side right through the fucking window.

97
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,660
I'll take his weapon.

98
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,470
I wanna get a little minigun.

99
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,860
I want to use my little cute guns.

100
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,860
I feel like I have two little toys in my hand.

101
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,420
I wonder how dangerous they are.

102
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,050
I wonder if they shoot BBs.

103
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,420
I'm gonna shoot you with my little BB gun.

104
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,300
Where is anybody? They're pretty dangerous.

105
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,370
That's pretty dangerous.

106
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,370
This guy's in a lot of trouble now.

107
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,670
That's how you hatchet.

108
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,670
That's how you horror movie somebody.

109
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,300
Can we horror movie anybody else?

110
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,290
Yeah, this guy.

111
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,459
Get horror movie'd. We both have the exact same idea.

112
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:08,459
He's gonna get his and I'm gonna get mine.

113
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:10,459
We're gonna do it all over again.

114
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:13,149
Shit.

115
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:15,149
No. Please.

116
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:17,149
I just wanna play the horror movie game.

117
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:20,220
That's the end of the movie.

118
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
Horror movie villain died.

119
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,220
Movie's over.
