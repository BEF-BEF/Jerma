00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:19,570
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerba here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and today I'm going to be playing as the Soldier, and I don't know what the loadout is, forgive me.

2
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:27,570
I'm probably just going to show it on the screen right now for you to check it out, but this video is not going to be about much of the gameplay.

3
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,570
I'm going to talk about a very, very, very specific topic, and it does have to do with Team Fortress 2.

4
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,570
There are some things you could say about this topic that will fall into Team Fortress, and we'll talk about them.

5
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:46,570
So first of all, the title of the video is probably like, what is game balance or how difficult is game balance, and I will explain this title.

6
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:53,939
And pretty much what I mean by this is, how hard is it really to balance a video game?

7
00:00:53,939 --> 00:01:00,939
And this is going to be one of those discussion videos where I open it up to the comments, I want to hear what you guys have to say, get something going, get some type of fight going.

8
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:02,939
Actually, don't start a fight, please don't do that.

9
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,939
You know, can we just talk about this for a second?

10
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:12,239
I hate when fights break out in my comment section, because I always feel like I can't pick a side.

11
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:22,239
You can never pick a side in these heated fights that happen in comment sections, because you'll piss off half the people that potentially agreed or disagreed with that particular person.

12
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,239
So I always like to play a referee when stuff like that happens, but I never remove comments.

13
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:38,239
One of the big things about this channel and about how I feel as a person is if somebody has an opinion, whether it be good or bad, if somebody hates my guts and wants to say Jerma, you're ugly.

14
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:48,540
I'm not going to remove that comment only because at that point you start to censor what you deem as worthy for your comment section, and it starts to get a hold of you.

15
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,540
You start to remove more comments, you don't like what that guy says, you don't, shut up, I don't like what you said.

16
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:59,780
I like to keep my comment section completely open, except for blatantly offensive things.

17
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,780
Like if somebody just starts slinging around incredibly offensive language, then I will probably remove it.

18
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,090
But regardless of that, we're going to move on, we're going to start talking about the actual topic of this video.

19
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,389
So first of all, the reason why I'm making this video is because I was hanging out in a Skype call, like I typically do with friends.

20
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:21,389
I do it pretty much every day, and we were talking specifically about one particular game.

21
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:27,389
I'm not going to throw the game under the bus, I'm not going to say, oh, it's Doom 3, it's not Doom 3.

22
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:33,949
But we were talking about a game, and we were saying, man, this is not how I would do this.

23
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:38,949
This game has a lot of broken stuff in it, as fun and as good as it is.

24
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:40,949
There's some things that are really wrong with this game.

25
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:50,949
And unfortunately, here's the real predicament when you start talking that type of language with people, is we don't know as gamers what happens behind the scenes.

26
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:57,949
None of us have any type of crystal ball that can show us what happens in these development studios on a typical workday.

27
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,949
We just don't know that.

28
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:03,949
But what we do know is passion, and a lot of us are core gamers.

29
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:09,949
I consider myself a pretty core gamer, and we get very invested in the games that we are currently playing,

30
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:18,949
enough so that we start to see problems that developers might not even see because they are just working on these games

31
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,949
and sort of going through the motions when they go to work.

32
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:29,379
Now, I am not saying that all these development studios that could have potentially unbalanced or imbalanced things in their game,

33
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:34,379
they don't just go to work and like, I'm done, let's go get shit-faced.

34
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:41,379
No, obviously, if you work in the gaming industry and you work in the art field, you work in the balance field, you are passionate.

35
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:47,379
You don't go into gaming, you don't go to work for a gaming company not caring about the games that you make.

36
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:52,379
But I really do feel like there is a disconnect between development companies and communities.

37
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,379
And I've talked about communities in a video before where the more invested in the community

38
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:04,379
and what the community has to say that a game company is, the game will turn out 10,000 times better,

39
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,379
and people are more willing to throw money at it.

40
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,379
That's why Team Fortress 2 has done so well and why people support it so much.

41
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:18,379
Sure, I could probably name you like a couple things in Team Fortress 2 that I think are just dumb.

42
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:23,379
But really though, if you look at the big picture and how much support that Valve has shown the community

43
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:26,379
and how much they've actually listened over the years,

44
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:35,379
and Valve's motto, Valve's motto over the last at least few three or four or five years has been games as a service, in quotes.

45
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:40,379
And what that means is instead of just releasing a video game and saying,

46
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,379
it's done, it sucks, you know what?

47
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:47,379
Screw it. If you don't like it, then we'll try better next time.

48
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:54,379
We already got you $60. I don't care. I'm the CEO of this big company and I have like two jets.

49
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,379
That's the disconnect I'm talking about.

50
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:03,060
But how hard is it, how difficult is in reality is it to balance a video game?

51
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,060
Because when we were talking in the Skype call that I mentioned,

52
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,060
we were mentioning things that seemed like they were very basic mathematical changes

53
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,060
that you could do to completely fix the game.

54
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,230
And it really got me thinking. It's like there has to be a reason why some of these things do not get changed.

55
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,230
There has to be a reason behind it, even with community outcry,

56
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,230
even with people saying, man, there's something really wrong with that, dude.

57
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,230
Are you going to do anything about that?

58
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,230
And it happens across the board in a lot of different games.

59
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,230
And who is ultimately responsible for the final decision of a game change?

60
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,230
Is it a one dude? Is it a team of people that come together and they say,

61
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,230
okay, we're going to do this, we're going to change X, Y, and Z.

62
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:50,230
And then they hand that off to some guy and he can like veto it if he really wants to.

63
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,230
Anybody in the comments that has any type of game development experience

64
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,230
or if you know something about this or if you actually have real world experience with this,

65
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,230
please let me know because that's a question I've been asking myself for a very long time.

66
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:10,230
All the way back to my like Diablo days when I would see something that just really in my mind didn't make sense.

67
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,410
Why don't things get changed when they very evidently should?

68
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,410
And I guess I'm going to end the video there. That's going to wrap it up here, guys.

69
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,410
Keep the discussion going in the comments. I'll be chiming in a little bit as well.

70
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,410
And thank you so much for watching. I'll see you guys all next time.

71
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,410
And of course, take care, everybody.
