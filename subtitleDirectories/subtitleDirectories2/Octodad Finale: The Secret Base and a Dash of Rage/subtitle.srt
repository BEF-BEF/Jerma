1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,539
Now what, build the mannequin? Build the mannequin.

2
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:21,309
Alright, well the head, the octopus head definitely goes on the head.

3
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:24,679
That's very painfully obvious. Okay.

4
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:27,929
So what is the banana, is the banana my like dick?

5
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,559
What's the banana for?

6
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:37,299
Alright, the suit goes on here. Suit obviously, okay.

7
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:42,020
So what's the banana? Get out of the way, chair.

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,600
Get out of my, get out of my way, my god.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,939
Here, take it. Oh. Okay, I was wrong.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,759
I did it, mannequin complete.

11
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,789
I am the victor of the game.

12
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:06,310
Well now what, did I beat it? Did I beat octopus father?

13
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:11,310
Oh my god.

14
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,019
Why is my house on fire?

15
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:19,780
What is going on? Did this guy burn my house down?

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,780
Oh my god, what about my family?

17
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,969
What about my like kids and my wife?

18
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:33,560
I am not concerned about climbing this ladder as much as my like sleeping daughter that's like burning in a fire right now.

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,780
Yeah, see, I climbed your stupid ladder.

20
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,060
Get over here. I did it.

21
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,060
Now can I go save my family? That's in, whoa.

22
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,620
Gotta secure a grip on my face.

23
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,620
I don't know.

24
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,120
I got away, I'm good. I'm good like that.

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,420
You will be dead from sushi. I said that completely wrong. That was embarrassing.

26
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,920
Oh damn.

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,099
No, no, no, no, no, no.

28
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,099
It's the mannequin.

29
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:07,129
Isn't the house on fire still?

30
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:13,639
I don't understand. What happened to the house burning?

31
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:21,139
The house was legitimately just on fire and it's just not anymore. Okay, whatever.

32
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:23,919
So now what?

33
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,330
I don't understand what I'm supposed to do.

34
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,639
I don't understand.

35
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,639
I don't understand.

36
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,639
I don't understand.

37
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,639
Just gonna climb up this place.

38
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,580
Something tells me this is not supposed to be happening right now.

39
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,819
I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this.

40
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,819
I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to be glitched into the wall.

41
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,319
And like sliding up.

42
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,159
I'm like one of those chairs that climbs down.

43
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,159
I can't even make the joke. This is too weird.

44
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,159
Get me. What's happening to me?

45
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,849
Seriously, what the f...

46
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,229
Get up the stairs.

47
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,229
I'm gonna have to restart the game.

48
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:13,680
Where's my left leg?

49
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,120
Oh, whoa.

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Oh, hold on.

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
You can see my left leg.

52
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
I can see my right leg.

53
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,639
I can see my right leg.

54
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,639
Whoa. Whoa.

55
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,389
Oh, hold on.

56
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:32,560
So you can actually slip on the banana peels?

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,759
Oh, whoops-a-daisy.

58
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,759
Oh, let's take a joke from like an 80s cartoon.

59
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,759
Whoa, look out. Is that a banana peel right there?

60
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,759
Whoa.

61
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,580
What the hell do I even do now?

62
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,580
Did I beat the game?

63
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,580
It didn't say like I beat the game.

64
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,580
It was like, oh, hooray.

65
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,879
You saved us from burning.

66
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,439
Bye.

67
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,000
Can I play pool?

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,560
I thought I think I can actually play pool.

69
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Oh, hell yeah.

70
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,930
Let's go.

71
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,930
Let's play this pool game.

72
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,919
Come on, you...

73
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,919
No.

74
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,919
No, I'm gonna get a scratch.

75
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,220
I just scratched.

76
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,220
I'm really good at pool.

77
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,220
Yeah.

78
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,220
Well, I didn't want to do that.

79
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,220
I wanted to throw it.

80
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,839
That's why I said yeah.

81
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,790
Yeah.

82
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,279
Are you kidding me right now?

83
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,279
I'm knocking these things over.

84
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,850
This is how we play pool.

85
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,310
As a real man.

86
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,310
I'm like stomping grapes.

87
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,310
Anyone want some pool wine?

88
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,930
Wait a second.

89
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,680
Wait just one second.

90
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,839
This is a shovel.

91
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,839
Why would there just be a shovel right here?

92
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,620
Hold on.

93
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,620
Am I about to dig up this dead body that's down here?

94
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,620
It works.

95
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,620
It works.

96
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,879
It works.

97
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,879
Hold on.

98
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:00,879
Oh, my God.

99
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,879
This guy's dead corpse is gonna be down here, I think.

100
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,879
The real father.

101
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,250
Oh, that would be so crazy.

102
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,670
There's bananas.

103
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:13,189
Is this octodad or octodog?

104
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:16,000
Because who buries this many things?

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Like, what the hell?

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Half octopus, half dog.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,689
Oh, I want to bury my toys.

108
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,689
Wait a second.

109
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,149
Get that out of here.

110
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:26,579
Get the fuck out of here.

111
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:27,579
That's a key.

112
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,839
That's a key.

113
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,720
Give me that.

114
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
What?

115
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,959
Is this like a giant like prop key or is that like a real key?

116
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,959
Pick it up.

117
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:39,639
What?

118
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,639
Pick the fucking key up.

119
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,639
Yes.

120
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,259
You found a key.

121
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:48,259
The key can be used to open doors of various lengths.

122
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,199
Okay, I've got to say this right now.

123
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,199
I've been walking around aimlessly with this key in my fucking hand.

124
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,639
In my fucking hand for like 30 minutes.

125
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,939
And you're telling me I'm looking at a keyhole right over there.

126
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,939
You see that?

127
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:04,939
You guys see this right here?

128
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:08,160
This is going to open this door.

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,939
Please come on.

130
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:11,939
Please tell me I was right.

131
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,939
Please tell me I...

132
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:16,589
What is this?

133
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:17,589
What is this?

134
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:18,589
Open.

135
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:21,339
Open with your legs.

136
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:25,139
Does that not do anything?

137
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,139
Come on.

138
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:29,490
Open.

139
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,629
Open.

140
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:34,850
Yes.

141
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,089
What the...

142
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,839
Where the hell am I?

143
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,389
I'm in like an underground facility.

144
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,399
What is this?

145
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:48,399
And why is the chef back?

146
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,680
I am so confused right now.

147
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
It's not even funny.

148
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,139
I saw a panel over here.

149
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,139
Can I like open the panel?

150
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,209
I have to be able to open this panel.

151
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:04,029
It's the only thing I can do.

152
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:12,139
That was very easy.

153
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,139
Okay.

154
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,720
So what is it?

155
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Is this like my like secret superhuman lair?

156
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,269
Well, I see big red button.

157
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:23,269
That usually means press.

158
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:25,600
Press the big red button.

159
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,279
Okay.

160
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,100
No.

161
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Yes.

162
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
To the moon.

163
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,279
We are going to the stars.

164
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,279
Look at that.

165
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,639
Okay.

166
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,519
I got to beat this.

167
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,959
Push it open.

168
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,959
Push it.

169
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,199
Push the button open.

170
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,199
Push the button.

171
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,199
Go.

172
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,199
Go.

173
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,639
Come on.

174
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a race.

175
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,009
I made it.

176
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,009
Okay.

177
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,009
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

178
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:55,889
Don't get electrocuted.

179
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:56,889
What is going on?

180
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:58,069
What the...

181
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,069
All right.

182
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,310
I can beat this.

183
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,569
I can do this.

184
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:03,569
I can do this.

185
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,839
Go.

186
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,839
No.

187
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,839
Go.

188
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,199
Come on.

189
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,699
These don't turn off.

190
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,259
I have to step over these?

191
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,259
Are you serious?

192
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:16,949
Nice and easy.

193
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:21,560
Nice and easy.

194
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,800
Nice and easy.

195
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,040
Look at my bar on the top left.

196
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Holy shit.

197
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,410
This is going to be so difficult to do this.

198
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,980
I got to get really close.

199
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,149
Fuck.

200
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:44,149
I just thought of a brilliant idea.

201
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:52,600
Let's see if it works.

202
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,860
It worked, but I'm so tired.

203
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,860
Oh, I'm dead.

204
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,860
You got me with your lasers.

205
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Oh, I'm doing that on purpose.

206
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,419
All right.

207
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:09,419
So guys, remember, if you're looking for a technique to beat that really difficult part,

208
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,419
just like screw through it.

209
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,429
Who cares?

210
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:15,429
Oh, there's a zip line.

211
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,429
Oh, this is going to be so dumb.

212
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:22,190
Are you guys ready for how dumb this is really going to be?

213
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,190
Here we go.

214
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,620
Yay.

215
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Yay.

216
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
That was fun.

217
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,250
Oh, God.

218
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,259
I would play a game where you just did that.

219
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:37,259
That was like the funnest part of this whole game.

220
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:40,360
Oh, what?

221
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Another laser room?

222
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,759
Oh, another laser room of, you know, fucking whole room.

223
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,759
Go.

224
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,759
Go.

225
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,399
Yes.

226
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,399
Yes.

227
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,899
I am the laser room master.

228
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,289
Can I pick up one of these rocks?

229
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:03,289
No, no, those aren't rocks.

230
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:04,289
Those are like whistles.

231
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:05,659
Give me one of the whistles.

232
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:08,220
I got to coach my little league team.

233
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,759
I've got to be pretty close to being at the end here.

234
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,960
Okay.

235
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
There we are.

236
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,159
Elevator.

237
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,159
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

238
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,159
Hey, whoa, dude.

239
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,159
What the fuck is going on?

240
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,490
I...

241
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,240
What the...

242
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:35,350
Well, the technique always works.

243
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:43,500
Fuck.

244
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:51,720
Fucking God damn it.

245
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
I don't want to...

246
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,809
I had this beat, dude.

247
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:59,809
I had this beat and the game like fucked up.

248
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,179
Great.

249
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,899
Why did it work the first time?

250
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,899
And I can't get it to work again.

251
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:16,200
You got to be kidding me.

252
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,570
All right.

253
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,879
There's that.

254
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,879
I actually have to like do it the right way.

255
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,649
How do I crouch?

256
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,000
Crouch, huh?

257
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There's no way I can crouch.

258
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,269
Oh my God.

259
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:32,269
Just go through it, you stupid prick.

260
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:38,820
God.

261
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
All right.

262
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,340
Can I not like glitch into the wall this time?

263
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,340
It took me long enough to get back here again.

264
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,279
Thank you.

265
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,649
My God.

266
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,720
There's a present.

267
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,799
All right.

268
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,799
What do I touch?

269
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,360
How about the present?

270
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,529
Present looks promising.

271
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,639
If I could put...

272
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,639
Why am I backwards?

273
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,370
Why can I not pick up the present?

274
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,070
Oh.

275
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,070
I get it.

276
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,720
Okay.

277
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,500
I did it.

278
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
All right.

279
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
So that's beating Octodad.

280
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Oh, I beat Octodad.

281
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,740
Thanks for playing.

282
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,740
All right.

283
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,740
What about the roses?

284
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,490
I can do anything with the roses?

285
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,440
Kind of.

286
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,799
All right.

287
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,799
Well, thank you guys for watching this Octodad playthrough.

288
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:38,110
Beginning to end sort of with edits in between.

289
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,350
Here's a flower for you because I love you.

290
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,519
Let me bring it to you.

291
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:45,659
Everybody watching right now.

292
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:47,659
Here's a flower for you.
