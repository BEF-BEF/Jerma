1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:13,359
Thank you for allowing me to hit people in the face with a pickaxe.

2
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,559
Probably recording right now, casual.

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,559
Indeed I was recording, indeed I was.

4
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,559
Hey hey, what is up guys, it's Jerma again with a gameplay commentary.

5
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,559
This time I am on Gold Rush defense on Gold Rush playing as the poly count pyro.

6
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,560
A lot of people ask for poly count and a lot of people ask me to do pyro gameplays,

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,560
especially when I did that video asking what you guys wanted to see.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,560
A lot of the response was do pyro and do poly count.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,560
So I figured, hey, why not kill two birds with one stone and do the poly count pyro.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,560
So anyways, this is from the event that I had earlier today.

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,560
We were on a guy's, I think his name was Dispenser, that was his name.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,560
It was his server. He was really concerned because I think there was only like two or three people in the server when we all flooded it.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,560
And he was just like, uh, I don't know if my server can handle this.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,859
But it did, it did. We had a good time.

15
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:09,859
I got a couple of gameplays from this particular event, but I'm going to just do one commentary today.

16
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:13,859
I'll probably get the other ones done either tomorrow or the next day, something like that.

17
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:16,859
But anyways, let's get into the gameplay.

18
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:23,859
The loadout for this match is going to be the Degreaser, the Flare Gun, and the Power Jack.

19
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:28,859
And watch this Jamps, Jamps is trying to come at me here and he's trying to taunt me with the melee kill.

20
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:31,859
So I say, you know what, whip out the Power Jack and shaboom!

21
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,040
Had a little bit of fraps lag there, but you saw what happened.

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,040
So anyways, he tries that the whole entire time, by the way.

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,040
It was his goal to try and melee kill me the entire time.

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,040
And I don't think he did it once, so we'll find out though.

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,540
I have only watched this gameplay once or twice, so I forget.

26
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,540
And I rage switch middle of the match to the shotgun because I can't get used to the Flare Gun.

27
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,540
Something about the arc and the drop off and the range and everything like that, I can't get used to.

28
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,540
I'm used to just whipping the shotgun out and pumping people full of lead.

29
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,540
Right here I'm just trying to massively spray back these rockets and try and get a lucky kill, but I don't.

30
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,539
And this is actually really cool.

31
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,539
I get this heavy lid on fire and I thought for sure that this was going to be a kill.

32
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,539
Boom, launch him in the air and boom, a crit!

33
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:17,539
But no, it doesn't kill him and I die.

34
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:24,539
But I do get an assist from the psycho crazy, not overpowered at all item called the Cow Mangler 5000.

35
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,349
And for just a second I would like to talk about the Cow Mangler 5000.

36
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:36,349
I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on it, but I'm going to explain to you why I am very upset about Valve, what they did and why they did it.

37
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,039
Nobody else got any other items.

38
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,039
I know that on the forums and all over the place, all over the servers, people were saying,

39
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,039
no, no, no, no, no, the Engineer and the Pyro are definitely going to get items.

40
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,039
Is somebody else?

41
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,039
Why did they just give the Soldier more stuff?

42
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,280
The Soldier just got like a million items in the Uber update.

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Why did they do this?

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
I am so annoyed.

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,280
And right there, sorry, I had to stop for a second.

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,460
Jamps was trying to come at me again and somebody just smoked him with the weapon I'm actually talking about.

47
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,889
So I don't know, I don't get it.

48
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:13,060
I don't understand why you add into a game something like that when you just gave him something.

49
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,060
They must be specifically trying to annoy people.

50
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:25,060
Either that or somebody gave me the idea, they said the Soldier is the most balanced class in the game, that it's really, really easy to give him items.

51
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,060
But I don't know.

52
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,060
I'm not going to talk about it anymore.

53
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,060
You guys already know how I feel about it.

54
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,060
But that's stupid that they didn't give anyone else anything, just the Soldier.

55
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,060
So now let's get back to the gameplay.

56
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,300
Peeking out around this corner, just trying to pick somebody off with one of the flare gun shots.

57
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,300
That's a Spy.

58
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,300
He gets destroyed by a Demoman's direct shot.

59
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,539
Just trying to get a flare gun into the spawn and this Soldier rocket jumps over here.

60
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:49,539
I get him lit on fire.

61
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:50,539
I don't get the kill though.

62
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:52,539
Trying to do that thing like I was doing before to that Heavy.

63
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,539
Launch somebody in the air and get him with the crit.

64
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:58,539
It's something I really want to learn how to do, but I just can't.

65
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:03,719
So I try to run away from this Heavy and he gets one little pellet on me before I go in the door.

66
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,719
And we're getting pretty close to when I rage switch over to the shotgun.

67
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,719
And you'll see how astronomically better I do when I use the shotgun.

68
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:20,089
So that Uber Heavy was a big, big advantage for them because now instead of it being one minute left and they're scrambling to get out of their spawn, they're now pushing to the second point.

69
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:24,089
And here is a great tip as a Pyro at these little choke point areas like this.

70
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:26,089
Look how many people are right here.

71
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:34,389
If I had reflected that rocket, if it didn't hit that Heavy in the back and I reflected it, I could have potentially killed like four people right there.

72
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,569
It's a great thing to do as a Pyro is just to suicide, run around a corner and just reflect.

73
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:43,569
And if you get lucky, you will kill everybody that's on the cart.

74
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:45,939
So just trying to get some flares up here.

75
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:46,939
I know there's a Sniper up there.

76
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,939
I'm trying just to get him with a little shot here.

77
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:50,939
And here comes Jamps again.

78
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:53,939
When I come around this corner, I kill a Soldier and you'll see.

79
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:54,939
So I get this Soldier.

80
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:55,939
I think it's an Assist.

81
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:56,939
Yeah, it's an Assist.

82
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,939
And then, oh, oh, oh, I thought he really was going to get me that time, but he didn't.

83
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:01,939
And I just died.

84
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:02,939
He was pissed about it.

85
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,939
He was yelling in the chat about it.

86
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:05,939
So he didn't get me.

87
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,939
You didn't get me, Jamps.

88
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,620
Not yet.

89
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,620
So you saw me just switch over to the shotgun.

90
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,800
At this point, I was like not messing around anymore.

91
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,800
It was time for me to start to do my duty and get like 10 kills in a row.

92
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
And it actually works out pretty well.

93
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
I love this setup.

94
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
The Degreaser and the Shotgun work well for me.

95
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Most of my kills, believe it or not, are not with the Extinguisher.

96
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I don't use the Extinguisher really that much.

97
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Most of my kills are with the Shotgun.

98
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,300
My basic default setup for the Pyro is the Degreaser, the Shotgun,

99
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,300
and the Homewrecker, if you would believe.

100
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,300
That's my default Pyro setup, even on offense.

101
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,730
Offense.

102
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,730
I don't like using the Extinguisher.

103
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,730
If you've been around since I have my first videos, my first few videos,

104
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,730
you saw me try to use the Extinguisher and you probably laughed

105
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,899
because I can't use it that good.

106
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,899
So I turn this corner and shoot this scout in the face

107
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,899
and I know there's a teleporter up there and even though it doesn't really matter,

108
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,899
I'm so gung-ho on getting rid of it.

109
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:03,899
It really doesn't matter.

110
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,899
I could have killed so many people right here.

111
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,899
But no, I'm like, I have to get rid of this teleporter or we're going to lose.

112
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:12,899
But it's only like a 20-foot walk anyways.

113
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:14,899
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

114
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:16,899
So this is where things get really good.

115
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:20,899
This is where I actually stop being a scrub and I start actually smoking people.

116
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,899
So I promise, oh, Spy, how are you?

117
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:24,899
How was your day?

118
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:25,899
Thank you for coming.

119
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:29,899
I promise now you'll get to see some shotgun kills, some good shotgun kills.

120
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:34,209
So me and this medic take a trip down memory lane over here.

121
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,209
We go across here.

122
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:36,209
There's a scout that comes down.

123
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:39,509
I pump him full of lead right here.

124
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:40,509
Here he is.

125
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:41,689
Flow him in the air.

126
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:42,689
Bang, you get killed with a shotgun shot.

127
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:43,689
That's one.

128
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,310
I got a little pocket medic here, pocket pyro medic, which is kind of funny.

129
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,310
We come back down to the same area.

130
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,310
I like this guy on fire.

131
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,310
He had low health anyways.

132
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,310
Don't even need to shoot him with a shotgun.

133
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,310
I get Ubered come out here.

134
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,310
I'm trying to get this guy over the corner with a few shots.

135
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,310
Boom, that's another shotgun kill.

136
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,310
And what do you know, reflect a dead, a dead ringer Spy.

137
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,310
I think that's what he was, but it doesn't matter.

138
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,310
Another shotgun kill right here.

139
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,310
That was Jamps again.

140
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,310
Come out here.

141
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,310
Hey, what's going on, sniper shotgun kill?

142
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,310
How you doing?

143
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,620
I don't know how I was not lighting this guy on fire.

144
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,620
Don't ask me how that was not happening.

145
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,620
Runaway time.

146
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,620
Here's their whole team.

147
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,620
And that's what I'm talking about.

148
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,620
That's my normal setup right there.

149
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,620
Bada bing, bada boom.

150
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,620
I'm not Italian, so don't even ask.

151
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,620
I just like saying that.

152
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,500
So this pyro just jumps down from heaven.

153
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
I thought he had no health because he's running away.

154
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Turns out he had plenty of health and he gets me one more shot.

155
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Would have done it too bad.

156
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
But you know what?

157
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,500
2020 hindsight, the modest Spy can't see health or a medic with a solemn bow.

158
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Maybe one day they'll add something for the Pyro.

159
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
No, I'm not even going to pretend like that's a funny joke.

160
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,490
So it's under three minutes and they're getting on the cart here.

161
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,490
Just trying to cause a little bit of chaos.

162
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,490
I am no match for this heavy, so I jump away.

163
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,490
I go around the corner looking for a medic or something like that,

164
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,490
but there was not one around.

165
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,490
Now I'm covered in Girardi.

166
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,490
So just chilling out for a minute, trying to get some health back.

167
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,490
And look at that shot by Zack34.

168
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,490
I jumped in the air and he got a headshot.

169
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,490
It was awesome.

170
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,490
Nice job, Zack.

171
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,259
So here's another quick Pyro tip for those of you that are new.

172
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:19,740
The Pyro, as a class, is about causing chaos.

173
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,740
As I'm right here, watch this, ready?

174
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,740
Look at all these people I light on fire.

175
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,740
I don't necessarily kill any of them.

176
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,740
I get a couple assist kills, but I don't really kill any of them.

177
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,050
Don't be misled.

178
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,899
Your flamethrower is not meant to kill anyone.

179
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,899
The only time you should be concerned about killing somebody with a flamethrower

180
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,139
is if you have the backburner.

181
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:44,139
The regular default flamethrower and the degreaser are all about causing chaos

182
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:48,309
and then using your secondary or your melee to finish people off.

183
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:51,309
In that situation, see how I just ran in and kind of just got myself killed?

184
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:55,309
That's what's going to happen to you every single time you try to kill somebody

185
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:58,309
by spraying them or by trying to spray a group.

186
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:00,309
Always pull out your secondary after lighting them on fire,

187
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:02,309
especially if you're using the flare gun.

188
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,309
The flare gun crits people.

189
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,309
It does 90 damage to anyone that's on fire.

190
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:09,379
Here's another good example of being a good Pyro.

191
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:11,379
Watch what this guy's doing to me.

192
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:13,379
Right mouse button is your friend.

193
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:14,379
Look at this.

194
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,379
I can't do anything right now.

195
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:19,379
If you compression blast people, you can send them back flying

196
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:23,379
and they just get so disoriented that they can't do a damn thing.

197
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:24,620
See what I'm doing to this guy?

198
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,620
I was just confusing him so much by launching him in the air

199
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,620
and taking out my shotgun, shooting him, launching him in the air,

200
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,620
and he eventually dies.

201
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,620
This is a great kill right here.

202
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,620
I pull out the power jack.

203
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,620
This is like the second or third power jack kill I get.

204
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,620
The power jack, if you kill somebody with it, you just get 75 health.

205
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,620
You just instantly will get 75 health.

206
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,620
The downside is you take 20% more damage from melee when it's active.

207
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,620
Nice shotgun kill there.

208
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,799
This heavy medic pair I am no match for, so I go down instantly.

209
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,799
And one more little tip I can give you for the Pyro

210
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,980
before this gameplay ends is always spy check.

211
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,980
Always just spray every now.

212
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,980
You don't have to hold the mouse button down and run around in circles,

213
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,980
but you'll see what I do.

214
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
There's a sniper up here that I thought was a spy.

215
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,980
Just give us spritz here or there.

216
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,980
You'll see.

217
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,279
Ready?

218
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,279
Just like a whoop.

219
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,279
He's not a spy.

220
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,279
That's all it takes.

221
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,279
See, just little spritzes here and there.

222
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,279
You want to make sure that no one's going to get backstabbed

223
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,279
because people getting backstabbed is bad,

224
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,279
especially if this heavy medic pair got backstabbed.

225
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,279
We would not have been able to stuff these guys

226
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,279
into their little spawn area back here.

227
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,279
And I get Uber to end this gameplay.

228
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,279
It's actually pretty funny.

229
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,279
Get this heavy.

230
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,279
It takes forever.

231
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,279
See how long it just took me to kill him with the flamethrower?

232
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,279
That's what I was talking about before.

233
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,580
So Jamps is trying to get one more.

234
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,580
He's trying to get his revenge on me.

235
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,580
He's screaming over the mic.

236
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,580
And I end up killing him.

237
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,580
So sorry, Jamps.

238
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,580
You didn't get your revenge.

239
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,019
Thank you, everybody, for watching

240
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,019
and everybody for participating in the event.

241
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,019
They'll be more like these, so keep your eyes open.

242
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,019
And top frugen like a boost.

243
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:53,019
It's going to show up here any second here.

244
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,190
Top frugen like a boost.

245
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,370
And thanks for watching, guys.

246
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,370
I really appreciate it.

247
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,370
And I'll see you guys next time.

248
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,610
Take care.
