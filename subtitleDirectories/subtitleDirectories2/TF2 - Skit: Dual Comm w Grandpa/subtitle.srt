1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:14,570
What is going on everybody? Jerma here again. This time I am gonna be doing a

2
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,449
duel commentary. It's somebody very special in my life. Gonna be doing a

3
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:24,010
duel com with my grandfather. Yes he is. So grandpa, if you'd like to introduce

4
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,530
yourself right now is a pretty good time. Okay. Go ahead. Hi, I'm Jerma's

5
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,850
grandfather. This is Milford Dougal. He is my grandpa of 87 years. That's right. He's

6
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,390
been here a long time and he loves to game which is ridiculous. I love it. It's

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,990
my favorite thing. It's my... video games are the best thing in the world, especially

8
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:48,030
Super Mario 3. Naturally, yeah. Yes, that's the best game I've ever played, probably

9
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,490
in my life. And today I'm gonna play some... Steve, Team Fortress... what are we

10
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,390
playing today? We are playing Team Fortress 2, grandpa. This is the game I was

11
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,189
telling you about. The one I'm doing online and stuff like that, you know, I

12
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:04,590
was telling you about it earlier. Yep, I remember. So anyways, you're gonna be

13
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,670
playing what? What? As what class? I mean, sorry. I'm playing as the

14
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,909
soldier with the rocket launcher. It's a fucking huge... I told you you couldn't swear. Oh shit.

15
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,909
Okay. It's okay. You can't swear. I'm sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to talk like

16
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,150
that. I'm not a sailor. It's alright. I'm not a sailor by any means. Let me get into the game here.

17
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,469
What is this? You gotta click on join. Yeah, okay. He's got it. Give him a second.

18
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:35,430
He's got it. It might take me a second or two, but once I figure it out... I almost

19
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,950
swore right there again for like the fourth time. Almost. But it takes me a

20
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,829
second. But once I get in the zone, I really start to kill people. And if you

21
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:49,709
saw my last video, I used to do videos for Insane Aquarium on my old

22
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:55,829
channel. The channel was youtube.com slash grandpa dickhead, but I can't use

23
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,689
that name anymore because I'm not allowed to use that name. I told you easy. But now

24
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,730
I'm on Jerma's channel for good now. I'm gonna do commentaries with him every

25
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:10,770
single day. So hopefully... I don't know about that. Maybe soon. Well, when we can, when we can

26
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,969
do commentaries together, I'll make sure to bring my A game. Well good. Hopefully

27
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,889
you brought your A game today because you're gonna need it. Because this game's

28
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:21,490
not that easy when you first start out. You've seen me play before. You

29
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,849
know what I'm talking about. You're talking to somebody that beat Donkey Kong

30
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:31,530
in five minutes, okay? Don't even try and tell me that I'm some kind of noob at this game.

31
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,409
You're noob. I bet you I can beat you in a duel, one on one. I know what duels are. I

32
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:38,770
looked up. I did my research. You did. You were on the computer for like three hours.

33
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:44,090
Come out of the spawn here. And this guy... What is this guy doing? That's a heavy.

34
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,849
I want to be that guy. I'm gonna be that guy, right? I changed my mind. I want to be

35
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,050
this guy. Okay, well go in the spawn and there you go. Okay, this guy looks like

36
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,729
he's the biggest guy on the game, the game. So I'm gonna play with him. He's

37
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:00,770
slow though. He's pretty slow. So tell me what should I play? How do I play this

38
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,490
guy? Should I be like a superhero and just jump at people and attack them? Yeah,

39
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:13,289
that's the heavy. I'm gonna go this way. No, don't. Listen. This is a tactical way. I'm telling you. This is the way you go if you want to be tactical.

40
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:18,330
Listen, grandpa. If you go that, that's the wrong way. You have to turn around. If you

41
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,250
stand still any longer, you're gonna get back to that by spy. I'm just telling you.

42
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:26,490
What the fuck is a spy? There's a spy. Okay, I have to explain to you the game

43
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,449
before you do anything stupid. Well, do it. You're playing under my name right now. I

44
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:33,889
don't want you to... I don't want people to think that this is some idiot like

45
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:37,449
who took over Jerma's account or something. Listen. If you listen to me,

46
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:40,729
you'll be fine. Oh, listen. Tell me what you want me to tell me, you know. I'm

47
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:44,810
sitting here. Okay, all right. So this is Dust Bowl. Okay. This is probably like the

48
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,810
easiest map to learn because there's only like one way people can go. Turn

49
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,770
around, walk straight, and you got to follow your teammates. Just follow where

50
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,490
they're going. This guy. You'll get to the enemy team. You're on red. Okay, don't

51
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,129
shoot him. Don't shoot at people on red. You're on red. I'm gonna shoot this guy. So get out

52
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:06,409
here. There you go. All right, fine. And then just, yeah. Okay, yeah. Oh, it's the blue team.

53
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:15,180
Oh my god. Oh, get old, you motherfucker. You're dead. You are dead, you shithead. I

54
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:22,519
No, no, no, no, no. Don't go up the stairs. I'll go up these stairs if I want to. I'm gonna punch this

55
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:28,399
fucking guy. All right, stop swearing, please. You're gonna get me in trouble. I'm sorry. I can't

56
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,680
help it. I grew up in LA. All right, well, just come down the stairs. There you go.

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,600
Who's that guy? Get that guy. Get him. I'm trying to shoot him. He's running away. Get him.

58
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,480
Yeah. He's dead. I did that. You didn't do it. Okay. So should I walk to this, well,

59
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,800
platformer. Take out your sandwich and eat it. If you go hit two. I'm gonna die. Two is your

60
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,160
secondary and that's, okay. Right now it's, there's a bunch of different items, but I'm not even

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,839
gonna pretend I'm, like, I can explain that to you. So just hit two and then eat the sandwich. What's the best

62
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:03,639
item in the game? Yeah, make sure you're in a spot that's, like, safe, though. Don't just stand still. Yeah,

63
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,279
but what's the best item in the game? I kind of want to know, because maybe I want it. All right,

64
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:15,439
fine. I'll eat it. As you guys can tell, it's really hard to play with him. Oh, yeah. Yeah,

65
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,519
okay. Says you, the hardest person to play with. No, it's hard to play with you. Any game. No,

66
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,879
it's not. I mean, it's easy. Especially a game like this, like, especially. Well, no matter why

67
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:31,000
am I playing then, maybe I should just quit and go back to writing my book. No. The title is not

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,680
written yet, so don't even ask. Okay. But I, oh, watch out for this guy right here. He looks like

69
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,600
he's pretty mad. You're good. You're good. You're good. So what's the best, I want to talk about what

70
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,160
the best item in the entire game is. What is it? Well, what do you think the best item in the game

71
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:51,720
is? There is none, to be honest. I think it's the Razorback. That thing looks really cool. No. All

72
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,279
right. Well, you couldn't be any more wrong. I don't think so. It really does. All the items are

73
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:01,899
good. I mean, I say the Razorback is not, but no, whatever. If you like the item, use it. It's all

74
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:04,779
about preference. You say a lot of dumb things. Well, I don't even have to, you're not going to

75
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:09,259
play this game ever again. So it doesn't, I don't have to tell you any of this. So just keep playing

76
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:12,620
and just, I don't have to explain this to you because you're going to forget in like five

77
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:19,100
minutes. I am not going to forget this in five minutes. I already forgot what you told me five

78
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,980
minutes ago, but it doesn't mean I'm going to forget what you just said five minutes from now.

79
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,980
What do you think this is? Some kind of game, even though we are playing a game. I'm telling

80
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:32,939
you right now, I won't forget any of this. I'm going to come on Team Fortress tomorrow and I'm

81
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:38,139
going to play and I'm going to be the best damn sorcerer anyone's ever seen. And if you don't

82
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,439
think that's true, then you can, you can stuff it brother. Oh, all right. That's fine. Yeah.

83
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,040
Just, you know, you can play on your own now. I'll let you play on your own since you don't

84
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,959
need my help and you don't think anything I say is worthwhile anyways. So I don't need your help.

85
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,360
I'm going to leave and hopefully you can figure it out on your own because I'm not going to sit

86
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,800
here and baby you anymore. Cause obviously you don't need that, right? You're a baby, not me.

87
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,759
So anyways, uh, take care guys. I'll see you at the live stream Saturday. Big birthday party.

88
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,480
Hell yeah. Let's do it. I'm going to be there. No, you're not going to be there.

89
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,899
What? No, why would you be there? Because it's you're going to be at grandma's anyways. You're

90
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:18,459
going to be at, at, at Jones. Oh, okay. Yeah. So, but dinner sucks over there. You're doing family

91
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:23,500
dinner there. Yeah, but dinner sucks over there. I want to eat with you tomorrow. I don't want to

92
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,779
be over there. That place sucks. Well, I mean, if, if you want to come to the live stream for like

94
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:38,069
Cause why, why the hell not? You just can't be over. You can't hang out all night. That's it.

95
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:43,910
All right. Fine. So bye guys. I'll see you all tomorrow at the live stream. Peace. Okay. See

97
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,329
Shut the computer down when you're done. Cause I'm not going to come back in here. What?

98
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:00,569
Shut the computer down when you're done. Oh, okay. I'll shut the computer off. All right.

See you later. I love you son or grandson. Oh God, I'm going to puke. So anyways,

102
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,189
