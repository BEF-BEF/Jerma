00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,070
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:19,070
In the background of this video is going to be some Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction expansion,

3
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,000
playing with Boo or Shpoo in the game Shpee, or Boo is a Shpee.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But we're not going to really touch upon the gameplay at all, but we're going to talk about Diablo, kind of,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,679
in a topic of discussion that I was thinking of the other day.

6
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:39,850
And the answer, well, not the answer, the question is, why do we go back and play games like this,

7
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,850
that we've beaten a hundred times, when we were like 13, 14, 15?

8
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,850
Like, why am I playing Diablo 2 right now? What is nostalgia?

9
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,850
And why does it get ahold of us so much? Like, how come every time I get the urge to play Diablo 2,

10
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,850
or to play like Mario RPG, or to play like Quake, or any of these old games

11
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,850
that not very many people really care about anymore.

12
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,849
Well, I guess Quake still has, you know, obviously Quake is a big thing still,

13
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:12,349
but something like Diablo 2, it scratches this itch for me that no other game can,

14
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:16,349
when I really get the urge to play it, and I don't know why.

15
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:22,349
There are so many games out there right now, guys, that are very good, and I'm not playing them.

16
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:27,909
I'm playing Diablo 2 instead, and I honestly think it has something to do with the fact that

17
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,909
when you are a kid, or not even a kid, when you're a teenager, and you're growing up a little bit.

18
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,909
Now, a lot of you guys are in this mode right now.

19
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,909
A lot of you guys watching these videos are like 12 to 17, like 12 to 18.

20
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,909
There are a lot of you guys that are older, like me, but the games that you're playing right now,

21
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,079
and in 10 years you can come back to me and say,

22
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,079
Jerma, are you a right or are you a wrong?

23
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,260
But whatever you're playing right now that you really, really love,

24
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:02,260
if you are in that age bracket, it is going to be that game that you will go back to all the freaking time.

25
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,260
Because right now, Diablo 2 is that game for me, because that's what I was playing when I was 13, 14, 15,

26
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,439
and I'm still playing it.

27
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:16,189
And I guess Diablo 2 fits into this category of infinite replayability,

28
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:20,189
and we'll talk about that a little bit here, because TF2 is in this as well.

29
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:25,189
And even some of the other popular multiplayer shooters and multiplayer games fit in this category.

30
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:30,430
And that category is games that are completely random.

31
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,969
No matter how many times you play the game, you will never have the exact same experience.

32
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:39,150
And it's games like that that will never die.

33
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,150
They will never die because of that.

34
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,150
If I load up Diablo 2 and I play a session like I'm playing with Boo,

35
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,150
we're going to have a different experience, because different stuff's going to drop.

36
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,150
The dungeon, it could be different than the last time I saw it.

37
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,150
The enemies could be randomly generated.

38
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,150
I don't know where they're going to come from.

39
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,150
It's a different experience every time.

40
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,150
Team Fortress 2 is the same way.

41
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,150
I brought up TF2.

42
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,150
When you go into TF2 on Monday, and then you go into TF2 on Thursday,

43
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,150
you're going to have a totally different experience, because the game is just so goddamn wacky

44
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,150
and has so many variables to it that it's never really the same experience.

45
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,150
You'll always get something new and have so much fun,

46
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,150
because it's not the same stuff over and over again.

47
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,150
Now, the maps could be the same.

48
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,389
The items can be the same.

49
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:29,560
For instance, Diablo 2's item system hasn't really changed in like 10 years or something like that.

50
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,560
But it's not about getting new content in just the same way I brought up Team Fortress 2.

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,560
It's the random encounters of the experience.

52
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
When you play TF2, we've all been in situations like this,

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
where you pull out the halves of Toichi like you saw the video a couple days ago,

54
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,560
and I killed like seven people in eight seconds.

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,560
That will never happen again unless the planets align correctly for me.

56
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,560
So it's situations like that, what I'm talking about.

57
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Another one, for instance, for example, is GTA.

58
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,560
How many times have you been in GTA and seen something and gone,

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,560
oh my god, that was ridiculous.

60
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
That'll never happen ever again.

61
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,240
And when a game has those moments happen so often, you can never get sick of them.

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,240
You will never get sick of that game because you're always looking forward

63
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,240
to the next ridiculous thing that's going to happen.

64
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,730
And I opened on nostalgia, and I guess I'll close on nostalgia as well.

65
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:29,040
The whole purpose of this video has been me explaining why I think nostalgia exists for me at least,

66
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
and it's because of replayability.

67
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
But sometimes it's not.

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Sometimes it's really not the case.

69
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,209
Sometimes you just have an emotional connection to a game,

70
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:41,209
and a lot of you guys know that one for me is The Neverhood,

71
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:42,209
and we all have that game.

72
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:45,209
We all have that thing that we love that we all pay that much attention to.

73
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:48,209
And it's awesome because ArmaKrog, the spiritual successor,

74
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:52,209
the Kickstarter thing I talked about, just got funded successfully by,

75
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:56,209
I think it got like an extra $100,000 on top of what they wanted for their goal.

76
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,709
So that's really, really awesome to hear that.

77
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:03,709
I'm so glad I'm going to get to play the spiritual sequel in quotes to The Neverhood.

78
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:05,709
It's going to be a blast.

79
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,709
But ending this video, I'm going to wrap it up here, guys.

80
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:08,709
Thank you all so much for watching.

81
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:16,430
If you have anything to add, then by all means put it in the comments section, guys.

82
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,430
I'd love to hear what you guys have to say.

83
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,430
Talking about nostalgia, talking about replayability,

84
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,430
talking about why you can play the same game over and over again.

85
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,430
Your reasons, they might not be other people's reasons, but whatever.

86
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,430
We all have our own reasons for everything.

87
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,430
So thank you guys so much for watching.

88
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,430
I really do appreciate it, and I'll see you guys all next time.

89
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,430
And of course, take care, everybody.
