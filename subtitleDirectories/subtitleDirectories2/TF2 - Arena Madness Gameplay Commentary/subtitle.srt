1
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,810
Hey everybody, what's going on? It's Jerma again with a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,089
More like multiple gameplay commentaries, because this is a new series I'm doing called Arena Madness,

3
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:22,969
which is where I play three or four classes in a row on two or three different maps on Arena.

4
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:27,210
Arena only, so if you don't like Arena, if you're not an Arena fan, I'm sorry,

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,620
but this is about 15 or 16 minutes long, so grab the popcorn for this one, guys.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,820
Playing as the Demoman on Arena Badlands for the first of these four gameplays, I believe it is.

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,579
Get that scout with a nice shot from the splendid screen and the Persian Persuader,

8
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:44,259
so that's half the loadout of the match. The other half is the grenade launcher,

9
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:47,060
as you'll see here, kill that sniper with a nice couple of shots.

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,380
And this is great, this setup is unbelievable if you're going to play on an Arena match,

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,100
especially because you can get healed like that from anything on the ground.

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,939
It doesn't matter if it's a health pack, ammo, if it's somebody's gun,

13
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,219
that's the best part about doing this, because as you know, Arena matches,

14
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:08,260
your health is so important. Barrel into that scout, and I'm trying to get him to run over

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,739
one of the grenades, but he doesn't end up doing it. Instead, he just starts to taunt,

16
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,180
and I don't know if he was a bot or not, I don't think he was, but regardless,

17
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:21,700
it's a nice direct shot anyways. Top bee-hiving like a bee's nest, as you can see there.

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,219
We're going to move on to the next one now, this is still a Demoman. The next two,

19
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:29,459
I believe, are going to be Demoman gameplays. After that, it's a Pyro, and then after that,

20
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,939
I believe it's Sniper, and then Engineer. So you've got plenty of stuff to look forward to

21
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:39,609
if you're a fan of any of the classes. Stay tuned, alright, because there's a lot of stuff here.

22
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:44,969
Starting this one out, just absolutely spamming into this little corridor over there. I get a

23
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,769
random kill, and you heard the ding-a-lings, I got a ton of damage on so many other people that were

24
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,849
there, which is huge because there's no health packs to pick up, unless, of course, you're a

25
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:59,209
Demoman using this setup, or you're being healed by a medic or a dispenser, but that's the only

26
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:03,370
way to get health in an arena match. A lot of people don't know that, that health is not

27
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,389
available, and they go, where are the health packs when they come into a game? So I shoot my last

28
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:13,189
three shots over the cliff here, trying to get some random hit, and now we're just straight up

29
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:17,189
Demo Knight, and there's nothing I can do about it because with this setup, you cannot replenish

30
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:21,430
your ammo at all, but that's fine because arena matches don't really last that long anyways.

31
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,870
So I'd be a real Demo Spy, as you'll see. I'll try to explain this, look at this. See, I come around

32
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,189
the back and I'm being a real Demo Spy. I thought somebody saw me because somebody detonated a

33
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:35,830
sticky. I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second, but watch this super lag mode. Oh,

34
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,990
I was so pissed about that, but it doesn't end up mattering at all because I end up smashing this

35
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,699
guy, picking up his health, which would be his ammo. Uber Heavy on the point. Now it's three to

36
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:51,300
three. This Heavy didn't even see me, so it's his demise. I take his head off with his head.

37
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:56,650
Final person is a Scout right here. I crush him with the shield, and then my teammates

38
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,449
get the final kill on the other Scout that was down there. So we are the winners. I didn't top

39
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:06,330
Gordy Smith like a gourd, so that's too bad, but anyways, let's move on to the next one. This is

40
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,770
the final Demoman gameplay of the series. This one starts off okay, but as you'll see, I really,

41
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,889
really blow the first blood buff. I was so pissed about it, you guys don't even know. I was freaking

42
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:21,050
out because it would have been so awesome. You'll see, I get under the bridge, smash this Pyro.

43
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,090
I have the buff now, and here we go. Oh, I don't do anything with it. I didn't even have grenades

44
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,620
loaded into the chamber. If I had turned up here with that first blood buff, I could have killed

45
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,629
five people with those grenades. It would have been insane. So now I'm just trying to help my

46
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,949
teammates right here. There's a Heavy medic pair going into their spawn area, just trying to get

47
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,509
a couple grenades in there. I get somebody with a random one, direct shot this guy, see the Spy,

48
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:50,629
and that's three kills in a row. And now I'm just trying to patrol the area to see if anyone else

49
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:54,710
is around. There's one person that's floating around somewhere. I don't know where he is. I'm

50
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,509
sure he's back by the spawn. So it doesn't end up mattering at all because I got the place guarded,

51
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:03,270
and the Heavy medic pair down there gets the kill, I believe. Or I think it's actually a scout. It

52
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,550
is a scout. We win the match, and I get five kills out of 10 people, which is pretty good if you ask

53
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:13,430
me, especially on Arena. So let's move on to the Pyro. The Pyro loadout for the first match is

54
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,790
going to be the degreaser, the shotgun, and the power jack. I didn't want to use the power jack,

55
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:24,470
but Steam was having all kinds of issues the last couple of days with item loadouts. So I

56
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,889
don't even equip it. I don't even take it out one time, so don't worry. It doesn't matter.

57
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,129
Coming around the back here, trying to be a good Pyro. See this scout? Light him on fire,

58
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:36,410
and he tries to run away, and I end up getting the kill on him. Not with the shotgun, but the

59
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,850
afterburn, which is kind of odd because we were both shooting at him with the shotgun.

60
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,850
This Heavy is not paying attention. He goes down. I thought I was screwed, but I do end up killing

61
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,740
him with the shotgun. Me and this soldier down here trying to be a little cautious because we

62
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,339
were down by about three people. Now it's tied, and now we are ahead. A Heavy just completely

63
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:57,339
dominated three or four people right there. There's a sniper here. He's not really paying

64
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:01,500
attention to his left, so I take him out just with the flamethrower. I think he's a spy,

65
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,339
but no, that's just my soldier buddy. Get an assist with the shotgun on that scout,

66
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:10,300
and now it's four to two, and when it just a second ago was nine to six in their favor.

67
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,660
Coming around the back here, this Heavy does not know that I'm going to do this for some reason.

68
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,139
I get him with a shotgun kill, and now it's four to one. We have this pretty much in the bag. We

69
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,620
came back from a pretty high deficit. I get killed by the needle gun, and he kills two people with

70
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,290
that needle gun. He came pretty close to the amount of health. Look at that health. He came

71
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:33,750
pretty damn close to taking that whole thing back, so good try for that medic. This next pyro gameplay

72
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,790
is going to replace the shotgun with the detonator, the new uber update item for the pyro. This is the

73
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:46,329
same thing as the flare gun except you can detonate him in midair like this, and watch what happens.

74
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:50,410
Detonate at the right time, and I got somebody. I have no idea how. I thought that was really

75
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,449
cool, though. Just a long-range blind detonation, and I got somebody. I get an assist for that,

76
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:00,459
too, by the way. Come down here just to try and do a couple more random detonations, and let me talk

77
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:05,180
about the detonator for just one second. I don't care that it has less crit damage. I know that's

78
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,819
a big problem for some people, and hold on just a second. I almost get myself killed here. I almost

79
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,819
just run into my own death. I got to blow this scout out, too, because he's on fire, and I'm

80
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:17,459
looking for him. I thought he ran behind me, but he's right there. I get him. Don't worry.

81
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,939
So it's 6 to 4 now. We have a pretty good advantage now. I come up here. There's a sniper

82
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:25,779
that I picked off. Nice shot. He doesn't think I'm going to go this way. He tries to go the

83
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:30,819
other direction. I get him with a crit. 40 damage is okay. That's fine for me, like I was saying

84
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:34,899
before. I get a nice shot. This is a good example right here of why the detonator is great. End the

85
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:39,220
game. I didn't even come close to hitting him, but I detonated it at the right time, and we win.

86
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:47,459
Time to move on to the sniper, and the map changes as well. We move on to granary. I'm a sniper. Like

87
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:55,379
I said before, using the sniper rifle, of course, the Shahanshah, and the Darwin shield, I believe.

88
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:00,420
Yep, the Darwin's danger shield. So I have been practicing with the sniper rifle. I wanted to get

89
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:07,220
good with it, and I found, as you'll see, bang, quickscoping is all I can do, and I do very,

90
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:13,379
very well with quickscoping. I can't sit there and camp and get a headshot. I over-aim. I under-aim.

91
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:18,660
I'm terrible when I hold the thing down and wait for it to get a charge, and you will see,

92
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,100
I don't think there is one time in either of these two sniper gameplays that I wait for it to get

93
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,910
even halfway of a charge. There's another quickscope headshot. I don't know. I have such

94
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:36,089
ADD and such like ADHD that I can't stand to have to sit there and wait, and some of these

95
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:40,649
headshots should have definitely registered, but they didn't. Like right there, I thought for sure

96
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:45,670
that I got that guy right in the side of the face, but I guess not. So five to three. This is

97
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:51,110
looking grim for our team. It actually has a pretty cool ending, even though it's a complete failure.

98
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,069
Five to two now. I'm trying to find a place where I can sneak in. Look, it's five to one.

99
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:00,389
I get a nice little body shot on that soldier. I'm trying to hide. They know I'm here. I'm trying

100
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:05,990
to jump around all over the place. Nice headshot. Quickscope on his face. Four to one now. I thought

101
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,250
I could get a headshot, or I thought I could pick them off from above like a bird of prey.

102
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:13,610
Don't get a headshot right there. And now I'm just like, you know what? Screw it. They're

103
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,490
going to get the point. I'm just going to go up there and kamikaze. And he ends up killing himself

104
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,370
on me. So I ended up killing like three people right there. So take it for what it is, I guess.

105
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:29,079
So this is the second sniper gameplay, and you'll see the same scout does the same path, but I miss

106
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:34,360
him this time. Or do I? That's what you'll see in the end. Result, bang, right in his face.

107
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,879
Coming around the corner, another scout I tried to pick off with a headshot. That would have been

108
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,759
sick if I got both of those scouts. Because we all know that scouts on arena maps are incredibly

109
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:48,200
powerful. They're like the main artery of arena maps. They're the ones that get all the stuff

110
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,279
done. They're the ones that are running around killing people, capping points. So getting rid

111
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:57,799
of scouts is incredibly important. Nice headshot there. It doesn't matter. He was overhealed,

112
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,399
and he was a heavy anyways. He wouldn't have died. I get an assist on him, though, which is

113
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:07,399
pretty cool. So this is one of the only times I charge to about full, and I miss. See? I'm awful

114
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,720
when I have to wait, even though I've missed like half of the quickscope shots anyways. But you get

115
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,659
the idea. Coming up this little area here, I want to make sure I can get a nice spot. I end up getting

116
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:21,220
a nice quick little headshot on this Demoman right here. Spank, but didn't kill him, but I get the

117
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,230
assist. I saw that there was a medic down there, and I figured that the heavy medic pair would be

118
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,710
right here, which they are. I come down here, get a quickscope headshot. Probably could have saved

119
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:35,029
the day, potentially, but there was an uber down there anyways. And then the final person is a

120
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:41,429
medic. Where is he? Nobody knows. There he is. Headshot to end the game. And now we are going

121
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:47,429
to move on to the engineer. This is the final one. It is the most devastating I kill. Well,

122
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:53,929
you'll see. I do very, very well. So playing as the combat engineer using the Mini-Sentry,

123
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:58,730
the Frontier Justice, and the pistol, starting it up trying to get this dispenser built because

124
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,690
this is the only way people can heal themselves without a medic. It's very, very important. If

125
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:10,090
you play engineer, make sure the first thing you do before doing anything is building a dispenser.

126
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:15,210
And as you can see, we had 10 people on the team, and we just got demolished right there. Nice

127
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,809
shotgun kill on that scout, and here comes another scout. I thought for sure I was going to be able

128
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:24,409
to kill this guy. Pull out the pistol, and nope, not enough. I get a lot of people with stray bullets,

129
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:28,570
though. I don't want to get too overzealous over there because I am only an engineer. And watch,

130
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,690
what is this other engineer even doing? He's just switching his weapons out over and over again.

131
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:38,250
I have no idea. It could be a bot. I don't know. Because arena matches, they're very,

132
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,649
very synonymous with not having people play in them. So at least two or three people on each

133
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:46,809
team will probably be a bot, at least in my opinion. Get a nice shot with that shotgun,

134
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:51,769
get another shotgun kill, and my Mini-Sentry killed somebody before that. So that's pure

135
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:56,809
awesomeness right there. This sentry gets placed in a very sneaky spot, and it kills two people

136
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:02,889
right off the bat. And you'll see the numbers. Check it out, what happens. Three to two, two to

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,850
one now is what it ends up being after that last sentry kill. It's me versus these last two people.

138
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,809
So let's see what happens. I have some crits. I'm ready to rock and roll. Place the sentry down.

139
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:18,250
Do I get the kill? Yes, I do. And what happens one on one? Who is going to win this battle?

140
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:25,370
It's going to be me with my Mini-Sentry. Seven kills and one assist. I ended up killing like

141
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,409
almost the entire team right there. So that was pretty awesome. And thank you guys all for

142
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:35,110
watching. Again, I appreciate it. I'll see you all next time. Take care, everybody.
