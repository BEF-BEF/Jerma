00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,339
Hey, what's happening, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,

2
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:17,780
and tonight, gonna be playing as the Chain Uber Medic tonight.

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,160
Haven't done a Medic video in quite a long time, so I figured why not just come out with

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,359
a fun video if you don't know what this is.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,839
Essentially, it's infinite invincibility. It's having an Uber charge for more than

6
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,320
15 seconds, sometimes even as long as two minutes with an Uber.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,079
It's definitely a whole lot of fun, but I recommend you don't do this all the time,

8
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,399
because it totally is just trolling. You're pretty much just trolling the other team hardcore.

9
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,399
And as you will see later on in this video, it's actually pretty easy to break up. You

10
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,520
just need a pretty good Pyro to kind of blast you around, but you'll see that later on.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,060
So how do you actually pull this off? You need two Medics, obviously. Both of you need

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,859
to be in some type of chat program, at least in direct communication with each other. You

13
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:08,219
both need the Uber saw, and you both need the regular default Medigun.

14
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:13,219
So what you end up doing is hitting somebody on the enemy team four times with an Uber

15
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:17,379
saw, because that's all it takes. Then you Uber your friend. Your friend is gonna get

16
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:22,319
four hits, transfer it back to you, you're gonna get four hits, transfer it back to him,

17
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,799
so on and so forth, and you just keep going until you can't go anymore. And it's actually

18
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,359
quite surprising that Valve hasn't done anything about this. You would think that they would

19
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,359
do some type of patch or something like that that didn't allow more than four or five

20
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,400
Ubers to go in a row from the same Medic within a minute or so. I have no idea. There's probably

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,879
some way to fix this. So as you can tell on the screen, we are absolutely

22
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,439
spawn trapping them right now, which I felt kind of bad about. You always feel bad about

23
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,840
this type of thing, but it's pretty funny at the same time. So I'm playing with MLC

24
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,280
Stealth right now. MLC Stealth is a big Call of Duty guy, good friend of mine. We were

25
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,359
just messing around in the chat, we decided to do this, and the next clip is actually

26
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:07,459
very, very funny. Me and Stealth end up going as Medic Spies. That doesn't make any sense

27
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:13,560
right now, but it will in a few minutes, I promise. So I get myself killed right here.

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,400
Probably shouldn't be doing this. I had like 70% Uber, I could have just ran backwards,

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,719
found Stealth, and we could have done it all over again, but I didn't do that, got myself

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,919
killed. But here is the second clip. This is actually pretty funny. They Uber at the

31
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:31,319
same time, so we go, oh, okay, let's just keep going. We make our way through the tunnel

32
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,280
here, see an Engineer on the left, I start smashing him in the face. I always feel bad

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,759
about stuff like this, because I think he might have been free to play, and he probably

34
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,759
had no idea what was going on right there. Just like, oh, let me drop my sentry. What

35
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,240
the hell is this? What is that? And then he's just dead, and it's like, I'm sorry, there

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,030
was some crazy guy in blue goo attacking you. So this is where it gets a little interesting,

37
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:57,289
I say over chat, I'm going, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, sit right here for a second. Let's

38
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:03,340
be medic spies, and watch this, backstab, backstab, backstab. We end up killing two

39
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,699
people being medic spies, and we still stick around, and we're still alive. Get this sniper

40
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:13,039
as well, and then it's time to start the chain again. Probably shouldn't have done

41
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,639
that right there, because it was just one sniper, and now look, Stealth is just smacking

42
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,300
at the gate. So remember in the beginning when I said a good Pyro can really ruin this

43
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,300
for you, take a look right here, I get the charge, and every time I go for it, I just

44
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,939
keep getting compressed backwards. This is what you have to do to stop this from happening.

45
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:34,419
And it works out pretty well for him, because we have to retreat back into the tunnel, and

46
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,979
I end up getting the kill on him with the Blutsauger, because that tunnel is really

47
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,960
small, you can't really dodge or weave or anything like that. So it works out pretty

48
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,080
well in our favor that time, and we end up staying alive. Kill that engineer, that was

49
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,270
pretty gruesome. We were just both sticking on knives into his face. So now we're back

50
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,270
at square one, playing as Medic Spies again. And take a look, that same Pyro comes out

51
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,030
and it's like, nope, not going to go for him, I'm not going to go after that guy. Just

52
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,870
chilling out here waiting for someone that's not a Pyro to open that door, and eventually

53
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,669
a Medic comes out, and I get him with the Medic Backstab. One, two, three backstabs

54
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:14,969
is all it takes. So we just barely get the charge off on that Heavy, get the kill on

55
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:18,569
him, and now we're looking for somebody else. No one else is really around, so he runs down

56
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:23,569
this way towards the cart. And look who shows up to ruin the fun, the Pyro again. He does

57
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:27,250
his job, but we had some miraculous rescue from another Pyro. I don't even know how

58
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,779
that guy got back here. But he ends up saving the day nonetheless. So anyways, this is going

59
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:36,819
to be the end of the video. We end up getting ourselves killed by a Pyro. Thank you all

60
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,620
so much for watching, I really do appreciate it. Just wanted to put this video together,

61
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,300
showing some quick, goofy little shenanigans as the Chain Uber Medic. But yeah, thanks

62
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,819
guys, I will see you all next time, and take care everybody.
