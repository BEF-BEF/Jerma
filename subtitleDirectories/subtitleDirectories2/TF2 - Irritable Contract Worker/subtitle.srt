00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,890
I think we're like 20% of the way through this contract. I apologize. I was gonna start the video a while ago and it was gonna be a- I only play as the classic!

2
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:24,320
But I ended up like killing two people and then like didn't record and then like started recording.

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,750
So now we're really recording and there's a guy in the water. I gotta get this guy. He's fucking dead. Guy's dead.

4
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:39,929
Alright, well, welcome to the video, guys, where we shoot fucking people in the water that have been dead for like 20 minutes.

5
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:47,609
Can I kill this guy? I know it wasn't a headshot, but this is going a lot faster than I initially thought it was going to go.

6
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:55,920
See if I can get a no scope here. There we go. If I do that a few more times, the contract will be finished.

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,920
I was under the impression that it was gonna be like, oh man, it's gonna take like fucking two hours.

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:08,560
I missed that one. This is a good place to sit though. No, it's not because there's spies that come behind you.

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,060
What an irritated beginning to this video. I sound really irritated. Do I sound really irritated right now?

10
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:22,060
Well, let's get rid of that. Let's like shake off the irritation. Hold on. Still irritated.

11
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,129
As you can tell, I was still a little irritated. I gotta cast off the spell that is the irritation.

12
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:35,430
And how we do that is I no scope the first guy that I see and then all of a sudden like I'm gonna be fine, you know?

13
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:43,939
First person I see literally that comes in this doorway is going to wipe my slate clean. This guy, right? This guy. Ready? Ready? Ready? Ready?

14
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:56,489
Still irritated. No, that wasn't a headshot. Still slightly irritated. No, I'm not allowed to do that.

15
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:06,569
Uh, I'll get him. I'll get him. I like didn't even let go. I'll get him. Come here.

16
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:14,409
I was hoping I was gonna like luckily shoot him right in the face. I'm being so useless right now. Please. Please.

17
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:23,729
I know I'm still a little upset. I can't get it off. I got a headshot this guy. I've got to get this guy right now.

18
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:33,740
Come on. I'm in the right spot for this. And he's pistoling me. This guy's pistoling me and I can't even shoot him.

19
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:49,659
Oh, how irritating. What just happened? Oh, right.

20
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:59,770
I'm so focused on the top stairs. I just have total tunnel vision. I had tunnel vision on sniper without being zoomed in.

21
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:07,340
Wait for it. Wait for it. It's the releasing the button on the finger is what's giving me the finger. Get away from me.

22
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:22,189
I don't know. I promise I'm not a spy. Come on down here. Show me. Show me your face. I'd love to see it.

23
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:28,270
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. He went to the point. He went to the point. He went to the point. How?

24
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:46,680
I don't know what happened today. Did I like, did somebody spit in my coffee today? Like, why am I this like irritable? I shouldn't be.

25
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:55,250
Maybe I like woke up on the wrong side of the bed. That's pop. Oh, guys, I feel like a new man.

26
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:02,250
Hey, you know that you feel like a new man. Well, that I feel, you know, I feel like a new man right now. Let's play some Team Fortress 2.

27
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,250
My coffee was like my coffee was really good this morning. Nobody's spitting.

28
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:18,250
Nobody definitely spit in my coffee this morning. This weapon is fucking impossible to use.

29
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:27,649
This weapon is so hard to use. Holy fuck. If this weapon wasn't the worst weapon in the whole game, I would have killed that guy.

30
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:33,850
No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get irritated again. This is going to be a good place to finish this up.

31
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:45,980
That is a spy that you are a spy. Perfect opportunity. Fuck me, man. He's going to get backstabbed.

32
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:54,879
There's nothing and I could have prevented that. Don't don't do it. Do you see how long that took?

33
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:03,279
That took so long to be able to headshot that guy. That guy did a little dance and ducked out of the corner.

34
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:10,300
And then by the time he came back, I was ready to shoot him. It's a long charge up time.

35
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,300
I lowered my sensitivity a shitload to try to compensate for my mom, my fucking lord.

36
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:21,620
I have to concentrate so much while I do this. I feel like I'm taking a math test.

37
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:29,689
Did I get a good grade on my ultra concentrate math exam? Fucking Algebra 2, whatever the hell it is.

38
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:38,750
This is this is the opportunity where this gun is supposed to shine around a corner like that.

39
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,139
Only got to do that a couple more times. You know, we got a good opportunity right here.

40
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:51,180
Come on, bring it on. I'll shoot you through the fucking laundry chute.

41
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:58,939
No spies, no spies. I can almost be done with this contract. I thought the flowers, I thought those were stickies on the red team.

42
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:06,160
Freaks me out for a second. That's me. That's me. I almost didn't understand what was going on.

43
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
I just had an out of body experience.

44
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:24,189
Screw it. I'll hit you with the ham.

45
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,350
Going underneath that thing. I got like bumped my head.

46
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:36,040
That's it. We're done. We're done. We are done. We're done. We're done.

47
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,300
I got it. We're done. Contract over.

48
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,300
For good measure, we're just gonna sit in the fucking water. Why am I still on fire? Come on, please submerge.

49
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,110
We're done. Give me my box. Give me my box.

50
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:57,639
What do I got? I want to see what I get. Come on. Have it be something good. Something good.

51
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,639
Congratulations. You have just been given the opportunity to spend $2.50.

52
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,019
Fuck it. We're doing it.

53
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:11,639
Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure. Let's see. Was this worth it? Was it worth it? What's inside?

54
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:30,829
Holy shit. Holy shit. Okay. That's worth it. That's factory new purple ranges. That's... Oh my fucking lord.

55
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:38,350
And it's a sniper. My mood just went from irritated and upset and annoyed into...

56
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:46,899
Alright. Okay. I got factory new purple range. I'm not even close to being irritated anymore.
