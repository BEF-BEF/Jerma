00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,030
Happy Halloween, you ghouls and ghosts. It's me, Jerma, from the past or the future.

2
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:22,030
Does anybody remember when I did that intro, like a year or two ago, whenever the last Halloween update was? I don't remember.

3
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,030
But hey, what's going on everybody? Welcome to the Halloween update for Team Fortress 2. My name is Jerma.

4
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,530
This is gonna be a live commentary to show you some of the stuff that's going on, in case you can't download it,

5
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,530
or in case you just want to watch it, you know, play out. Man versus man.

6
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,030
Gray man, blue man, red man, green man.

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,969
Oh my god, that looks really, really cool.

8
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,350
This is the blue guy's grave. Oh no, that's Redman.

9
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,159
Ah, okay, we gotta push Redman. They gotta push Bloomin'.

10
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,590
I want to pick up a spell. That's the number one thing I want to do.

11
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:02,229
And then you use your action slot to cast that said spell.

12
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:10,739
And this is on Hightower, which as we all know, Hightower is like impossible to cap anything.

13
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:22,379
I want a spell. I want a goddamn spell. Not now. No. Come here, you.

14
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,120
Okay, there's a spell book right there. You see that book right there, guys?

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,549
If I pick this up and I have that magazine equipped.

16
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:40,109
All right, I got a spell. I'm gonna get it. Look in the lower left.

17
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,609
I have no idea what this is, but I'm about to cast it on somebody.

18
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:51,430
What? What is this? What is this like?

19
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:58,769
I can't cast my missiles or whatever the hell. Oh, I was hitting the wrong damn button.

20
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:02,269
All right, so that was a fail, but I rebound my key.

21
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:06,769
And I think this is like a fireball or something. We'll see if we can smash somebody with this.

22
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:11,379
You are a spy.

23
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:16,389
Did you see that? I just threw a fireball at that son of a bitch.

24
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:21,340
All right, good. There's another book right there. Let's try to get this book, too.

25
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,030
We're gonna win. And I think it's whoever wins the round, you actually go to hell.

26
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,460
And then I don't know what the hell happens there, but I don't know what this does.

27
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,139
Whoa. Whoa. All right, I'm shooting like bats.

28
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,639
Look at all these books. Look at all these spell books.

29
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:45,240
There's spell books everywhere. What? What the hell is going on?

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,740
Oh, it was a teleport. That was a teleport. All right, I get it.

31
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,569
This is like the stupidest thing.

32
00:02:52,569 --> 00:03:02,409
All right, we're in hell. So now what? Is there a blue team?

33
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:06,909
But because we won, see how we won that round, we now get to go. Yeah, there is a blue team.

34
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:15,860
Screw you. I'm invisible. Oh, there's an actual invisibility one.

35
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,909
No, get away from me. No, I'm a ghost.

36
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,909
You turn into a ghost when you die in hell. That's so stupid. I love it.

37
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:27,909
Boo. Boo. You can fly, I think, too. Yeah, you can.

38
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:33,099
If you tap space, you can fly around.

39
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:38,460
I want to cast fireball at somebody. Come here.

40
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,659
Gotcha. Oh, God. I don't know what this means.

41
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,789
What's with the skeleton? What's with the skeletons?

42
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:52,120
Dude, what does this do? Did I make it to the super book?

43
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,550
What's going on? I don't even know what just happened.

44
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,180
What spell is this? I think I got the super book.

45
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,180
I don't know what that means, but these skeletons are freaking me out.

46
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:10,449
Looks like I got overhealed. Whoa. What the?

47
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:15,840
What the hell is going on? I'm like a baby skeleton.

48
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,000
With like a big head. Wow, dude, are you serious?

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is outrageous. I can't even hurt anybody.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,610
I'm like third person. I've got hacks on. Those are some pretty good hacks.

51
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,920
This is so wacky. This is so wacky. I love it.

52
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,129
I love this wacky, wacky crap, man. Come on.

53
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:52,430
What am I going to light? I'm going to light a pyro on fire? That's not going to happen.

54
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:59,199
You get it. I'm good. You get it. I'll be alright, man.

55
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:07,389
I feel like Gandalf. Holy hell. What I'm more shocked of

56
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:11,389
of anything else, really, to be honest with you guys, is people playing the objective

57
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,560
on Hightower. This update gave us people

58
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,740
playing the objectives on Hightower. That's a shock to me.

59
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,699
And I fell off, but I think we're still going to get it. This guy's just casting fireball.

60
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:38,269
Oh yeah, we got it. But how crazy is that? Alright, here we go. Let's go to hell.

61
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,639
I don't want to die. I just want to run up here. That's all I want.

62
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,939
Don't hurt me, please. Come on. I'm the scout. I've got to be the first one there.

63
00:05:54,939 --> 00:06:01,470
This is electrified. Don't hit me. We're supposed to all go up there

64
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:07,740
and be friends, right? Because we're all like Halloween buddies. When do the gates

65
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,560
open? The gates are open. Go.

66
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:21,089
Ghosts. So what do you get for this? Like some kind of hat? Or achievement or something?

67
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:29,779
Give me the book. Yeah. Hat out of hell.

68
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:34,910
Alright, so for doing this, we get something. Whoa.

69
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,970
Is that? Wow, you can spawn him? Didn't me and Star

70
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,970
like do this already? Oh my god.

71
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,339
Kill this guy. Kill this guy for me.

72
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:52,829
These are both ours. I'm just going to stand right here and be completely

73
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:58,529
protected. Holy crap. That's insane. Alright, well

74
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:03,819
as you can see, it's pretty fun. Pretty amazing.

75
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:07,819
But that's going to wrap it up here, guys. See you all soon. Thanks so much for watching. Go enjoy the update. Go play it.

76
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sure we'll all find out more stuff over the next few days. And I'll see you guys all next time.

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,240
And of course, take care, everybody.
