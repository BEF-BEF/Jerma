00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,900
Hey, what's happening everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,339
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier with the Liberty Launcher, or the Liberty

3
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:28,019
Launcher, the Strange Shotgun, and of course the Equalizer. And this is probably my first

4
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:34,460
Liberty Launcher gameplay, since the thing came out back in June of last year. So it's

5
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,960
been about four or five months, so I figured I'd give this thing a go. I also plan on

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,659
doing a calm angler video as well soon, so be on the lookout for that video. At some

7
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:49,740
point in the future, I just don't know when it's gonna come. Probably in the next few

8
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,520
weeks. So what I want to talk about, specifically in this video, I want to bring up a couple

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,380
of things. The first thing I want to bring up is the rocket speed on this thing, and

10
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:05,819
how after playing with it for a long time, you can really screw up your Soldier gameplay.

11
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,260
Now let me just brief, before I tell any of this, before I get into the story at all,

12
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,780
I want to say that no, this is not like the worst rocket launcher, this is a great rocket

13
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,310
launcher, I love this thing. But what I would say to anyone that wants to use this rocket

14
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:25,129
launcher, and use it well, and continue to use it, I would say get your hands on this

15
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:31,250
thing as early as possible, and stick with it. Because if you transition from the normal

16
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,329
rocket launcher to the Liberty launcher, or if you go back, oh I've played for a couple

17
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,569
weeks, I'm really into this weapon, and you go back to the normal rocket launcher, you're

18
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:45,890
gonna see a pretty weird problem where you can't really hit people with your rockets,

19
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,469
because you're so used to the different speeds. Now I would say the same thing about the direct

20
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:55,329
hit, but the direct hit has a totally different mechanic, they're not really in the same ballpark,

21
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,209
because obviously the Liberty launcher and the default are the exact same thing, the

22
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:06,870
only difference is the rocket speed and the lower clip size. There's no other difference.

23
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,169
So I'd say going back and forth between the direct hit and the default is fine, because

24
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:16,289
the direct hit has that other mechanic, that straight on fast hit them in the stomach,

25
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:21,159
get them right in the gut mechanic, that you can get used to and go back to the default.

26
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:26,840
Now this is not a boycott the Liberty launcher video, that's not what this is, I'm just giving

27
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,000
you guys my experience with this thing, and fair warning that if you're new or if you're

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,159
thinking about trying to play with the Liberty launcher a lot, then be weary of your default

29
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,639
rocket launcher going back to it, because it happens all the time to me, I get so screwed

30
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:48,479
up. So the second thing I want to talk about in this video is specifically the new update

31
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,199
that is looming over all of our heads. I'm sure a lot of you guys know that the Dr.GroardBot's

32
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:59,280
people, they have a Scout pack and they have a Medic pack that's kind of just sitting in

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,560
the wings, and I think we're going to get it soon. I hope we get it soon, I hope we

34
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,080
get a ton of stuff soon, but one of the things I was thinking about, and I was talking to

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,310
somebody about this the other day, is the Scout. So the Scout is supposed to get one

36
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,590
of these Dr.GroardBot packs, and I was really really trying to figure out, I was really

37
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:24,469
trying to piece together in my brain, how a Scout GroardBot pack, that's a hard word

38
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:31,159
to say, GroardBot, how that pack would work. Because the Scout with a laser beam, because

39
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:36,770
all the GroardBot stuff is laser beams and alien stuff, how would they put that in the

40
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:42,349
game? I can't imagine a Scout running around with the Phlogistinator or something. If any

41
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:46,509
of you guys have any ideas, if you think you know what they're going to do, definitely

42
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:50,469
shoot me a comment or shoot me a PM or something, because I like hearing your ideas, you guys

43
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:55,789
know that, but it's just blowing my mind. I cannot imagine a Scout with some kind of

44
00:03:55,789 --> 00:04:02,819
crazy laser beam, because that, it scares me. And also the Medic, the Medic has a new

45
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:08,020
Medigun apparently you could use, a laser beam Medigun, I just, I'm so, I love this,

46
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,620
I love this time period. Once we get into this period before a huge update, there's

47
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,019
so much speculation, there's so much stuff, everyone's making up these crazy item ideas,

48
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:22,300
everyone's throwing stats around, everyone's throwing ideas around, I love it. I love going

49
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,339
on the Steam forums, let me know if you guys do this as well, I go on the Steam forums,

50
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:32,620
the Team Fortress 2 sub-Steam forums, and I just read all the crazy ideas people have,

51
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,240
and I read all the interesting things people have to say. It really does get you hyped

52
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,600
up and it puts you in the update mindset, where you're just waiting, is it going to

53
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,800
happen this week? No. Is it going to happen next week? No. When is this goddamn update

54
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,399
going to happen? And you really start to get so hyped and when it launches, I log on to

55
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,600
Team Fortress, I see the blog post, I see the new update, and then of course you have

56
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,920
to deal with the downloading, where you don't download the whole, it takes like 12 hours

57
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,000
to download the update, but once you get that update, it is the most fun ever and it's like

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,800
Christmas Day. I also, I want to bring up something about the gameplay, if you noticed

59
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,759
in the background here in the gameplay, I, they had a teleporter up on the second floor

60
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,439
over there, and I could, I went up there twice, I went up there the first time as you saw

61
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,879
with the shotgun, I put five shotgun shots into that thing, and the engineer was repairing

62
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,839
it, and I came back and I put three rockets into it and it was still up. Now I don't know

63
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,319
if that engineer, it was just a coincidence, and he was just back there that whole time

64
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,360
just whacking at it, or if that's some kind of glitch or something, I have no idea, but

65
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:44,480
I was really mad about that. I couldn't believe it, because I sacrificed my life pretty much

66
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,730
two times to try and get rid of that thing, and it didn't work. So I have no idea what

67
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:55,470
was happening there, that's either a good engineer or I'm just crazy. So this is going

68
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,629
to be the end of the video guys, thank you all so, so much for watching, I really do

69
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:03,990
appreciate it, and I'll see you guys all soon, and let's get this update rolling out here

70
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,879
Valve, huh? Take care everybody, I'll see you all soon.
