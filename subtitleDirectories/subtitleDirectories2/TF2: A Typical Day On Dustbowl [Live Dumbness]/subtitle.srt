1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,250
Oh, there's a typical day in Team Fortress 2. Let's go outside.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,809
Oh, there's a sentry right there. Oh, that's pretty cool.

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:09,289
I have another sentry. Oh, pretty sick.

4
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,449
Oh, wait, we got a third sentry over there.

5
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:14,710
Let's just keep going. I mean, there can't be more than that.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,870
There can't be like a fourth sentry over here.

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,469
I mean, it is like a dispenser.

8
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:22,309
I mean, there's another sentry going up over here right now.

9
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:25,190
We have seven engineers.

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,600
Seriously, like Dust Bowl in a nutshell.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,200
Oh my god. No one's gonna be able to even get over here.

12
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:42,380
You know, they don't even need me.

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,600
I don't even have to be here right now.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,979
There's seven engineers on this team.

15
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:50,579
All I have to do is just stand over here.

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,119
Just stand in between the dispensers and just watch.

17
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,200
Yay. Come on. Come on.

18
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,099
Oh, they got a sentry.

19
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:11,290
Oh, the spy.

20
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,760
That's not fair. I hit him right in his face.

21
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,019
I don't know how I didn't hit that spy.

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:33,129
This guy's just healing me.

23
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:35,769
He wants me to get this taunt kill. So bad.

24
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,790
Did you guys just see that spy?

25
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,469
Dude, that guy missed like four backstab attempts in a row.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,700
Oh my. I just killed the whole team.

27
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,560
Oh my god. I just killed like the whole team.

28
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,360
Look at the chat.

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,080
Wow. That was so dumb.

30
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,819
I just killed the entire team.

31
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, this whole team is really mad about that.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,039
I would probably be too.

33
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,919
I would be livid about that one.

34
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,349
All right, guys.

35
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,469
We're going to be playing the frog pyro.

36
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:33,349
Let's go. Let's do it.

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,240
Okay, guys.

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,120
We're going to play the frog pyro.

39
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,840
Let's go. Let's go.

40
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,699
It's to die.

41
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,300
Blow yourself up on me.

42
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,460
I didn't even need to do that.

43
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,090
Now they're pushed back.

44
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,669
There's one.

45
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,189
There's two.

46
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:05,800
Let's try it.

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,439
Come on. Don't.

48
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:06,919
Don't.

49
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,229
Ladies and gentlemen, here comes the spy.

50
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,530
Here comes the spy.

51
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,729
My name is spy.

52
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:27,610
Your name is spy.

53
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,599
You got me.

54
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,699
But you didn't.

55
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:34,939
No.

56
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,659
Well, well.

57
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:55,819
Oh, geez.

58
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:56,939
Oh, Jesus.

59
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:57,979
You just shot me.

60
00:03:59,180 --> 00:03:59,979
You fucker.

61
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:06,699
We only got 10 seconds.

62
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,020
What?

63
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,139
What?

64
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,419
What is this guy doing?

65
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:15,530
We just did it.

66
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,170
We just did it.

67
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:16,730
We just did it.

68
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,370
We just did it.

69
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,410
We just did it good.

70
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,720
That's how we do a little bit of zhuzh.

71
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,060
That's how we zhuzh it up.

72
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:31,660
Want to see some zhuzh?

73
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,540
You want to see some zhuzh?

74
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,100
You ready?

75
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,579
Here we go.

76
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,180
Zhuzh.

77
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,259
I'm going to zhuzh this guy up.

78
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:39,899
Got him.

79
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:41,769
This guy needs a zhuzh.

80
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,899
This demo man around this corner is getting zhuzh'd.

81
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,379
I zhuzh'd him, but the medic saved his life.

82
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:51,800
All right.

83
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,439
I got to zhuzh somebody before this is over.

84
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,800
Somebody's got to get zhuzh'd.

85
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,990
You got to zhuzh him up.

86
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,220
Here we go.

87
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,730
Zhuzh him up right here.

88
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:09,939
I could have zhuzh'd.

89
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,779
How did I miss that headshot?

90
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,399
Somebody explain it to me.

91
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,639
I want to get a calculated mathematician

92
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,860
to explain to me why you're being a real dick right now.

93
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,610
That was funny.

94
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,730
That was funny.

95
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,129
What the?

96
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:35,610
I just can't stop eating these.

97
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,860
What are you eating?

98
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,819
Fiber one bars.

99
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,899
Stop eating fiber one bars.

100
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:43,019
Why are you doing that?

101
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,759
I've only had two.

102
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,040
I had one last night though.

103
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,360
You were going to get such a compacted shit.

104
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,639
It's not going to even be funny.

105
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,639
They're so good.

106
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,839
You are going to crap out like a cement block.

107
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,519
I need to get these but not as fiber bars.

108
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,439
I know they make them.

109
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,029
It's okay.

110
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,389
We're getting spawn camped right now.

111
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,300
It's okay.

112
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,019
Don't worry, Star.

113
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,620
We're getting spawn camped.

114
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,019
And you're not even here to help.

115
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,220
I'm not worried.

116
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,220
So those of you guys that are watching right now,

117
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,379
we're on Dust Bowl.

118
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,980
You're not even going to use this clip.

119
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:21,449
Why not?

120
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,920
Because I'm not in the video.

121
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,480
So I could just like cut you out.

122
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,879
I might even be talking to nobody right now, guys.

123
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,519
So Star was never fucking even here.

124
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,810
Psycho.
