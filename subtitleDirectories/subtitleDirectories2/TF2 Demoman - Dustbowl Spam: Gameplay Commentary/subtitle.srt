00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:13,669
What is going on, everybody? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:19,670
This time we are the Demoman, the default stock Demoman. There's no unlockables here, folks.

3
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:26,670
Only the default vanilla 2007 Team Fortress 2 setup, sticky bomb launcher, grenade launcher, and the bottle.

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,670
I kind of just felt like doing a gameplay where I just did the default stock, because a lot of you guys don't really have any of the new items.

5
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,170
And I figured why not just do a complete stock gameplay, playing on Dust Bowl.

6
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,670
And I gotta tell you guys, this is a very, very, very good gameplay.

7
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:48,469
I think I only died two times and I killed like 700 people. That's a lie, but you get the idea. I do very well.

8
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:53,600
So here are some Demoman tips, especially on this part of Dust Bowl, the first part of Dust Bowl.

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,600
You want to stick around up top on this little building up here.

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Heavy Medic comes around the corner, but I get lucky crit right there and I just barely get the kill.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,099
This little house is fantastic, because look at underneath inside. There is two full health packs and ammo.

12
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,099
You do not even need a Medic to hang out with you up here. You don't need a Dispenser, nothing.

13
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:18,599
If you get hit, just drop down the little middle there and get yourself some more health and ammo. It's a fantastic place to stay.

14
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:24,099
I would say same thing for Soldier too. If you're Soldier or Demoman, I would suggest sitting in this spot right here.

15
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:29,459
Prime example right here. Take a look, I get lit on fire, but it's as if it didn't even happen at all.

16
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:36,459
Full health, full ammo. Let's keep going. Sir, spam a lot now. Accidentally kill a disguised Cloak Spy.

17
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:40,459
I hate when that happens, but you know how this game is. You give and you take, right?

18
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,459
Anyways, here's a good tip for you guys with the Sticky Launcher. Watch what happens.

19
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:50,459
My Medic gets lit on fire and you have to place your Sticky Bombs five to ten feet in front of somebody when they're running after you.

20
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:53,459
Otherwise, they're just not going to get hit by any of the blast radius.

21
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:59,459
This is especially important for Pyros because as a Demoman, you don't really have any close-range combat abilities.

22
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:05,459
Except for, of course, your melee weapon, but who wants to bring out a melee weapon for a Pyro? That's pretty much a death sentence.

23
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,639
Get Ubered by the Quick Fix and as you saw, took out pretty much the entire left-hand side right there.

24
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,639
Big deal because if they had gotten up there, they probably would have gotten on the point and capped it.

25
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,639
I'm glad I could get over there. Good Quick Fix Uber by that Medic.

26
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:24,639
And now I'm back up on my Dragon Perch, just shooting and spamming into their spawn area.

27
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,639
A nice little pop-up right here on this Demoman. I get the kill.

28
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,639
Back on my house, hanging out in my little shack over here.

29
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,639
Got to move away from it now though because it looks like they're coming out the right-hand side.

30
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,939
And I get sniped by Sitting Duck, who gets me with a nice body shot coming around the side there.

31
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:45,250
That's pretty much what you want to do, especially on this map on Dust Bowl.

32
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,250
Demoman at this point is an incredibly powerful class.

33
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,250
Spy I saw out of the corner of my eye and there he is. Boom, he gets blown up.

34
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,250
Now kind of on the right side over here, trying to do some work, just putting pills out everywhere.

35
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,250
Century Gun now is going up on the point and look at where I end up.

36
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,250
Take a look at where I am right now. Back on the Perch with this Soldier.

37
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,250
This is incredibly dominating now because if you have more than one Power Class up here

38
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,250
shooting into the spawn area, it's very difficult for anyone to get out.

39
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,250
And even an Ubert Heavy is going to have trouble killing anyone

40
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,250
because we can just jump backwards behind the house and kind of ring around the Rosie with him.

41
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,250
So I kind of get embarrassed right here, guys.

42
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,250
I jump down here, see this sniper, try and kill him, and then a Demo Knight comes over here.

43
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,250
And rather than just pulling out my bottle and going toe-to-toe,

44
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,250
I didn't really have enough brain power to do that, so I just get murdered by him.

45
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,490
That's the only other time I die. I think I actually...

46
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:48,490
I'll take that back because you'll see, this is a pretty crazy gameplay, how this ends.

47
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,490
It's one of the most ridiculous things ever, so I'm not going to spoil it for you what happens,

48
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,490
but you'll see, it's pretty insane what happens at the end of this gameplay.

49
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,919
And let me take this time just briefly to talk about my livestream

50
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:03,919
and how thankful I am for all the people that showed up to it.

51
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,919
It was a success, an absolute success. I think I peaked out around 150 viewers at one time

52
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,919
for maybe 45 minutes there was 150 people watching or something like that.

53
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,920
Really, really cool, really awesome. I'm really sorry that I couldn't get Deus Ex to work,

54
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,920
but apparently you have to go through like a dog and pony show to get the thing to load into windowed mode,

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,100
and obviously I can't do it in full screen mode because you can't really stream anything in full screen,

56
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:35,339
but my plan, guys, is for every Monday and Friday, or maybe every Tuesday and Friday,

57
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:37,339
is to do a livestream twice a week.

58
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:40,339
Hopefully I see a lot of you guys there, a lot of new people.

59
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:44,339
I'll put it in the description, the link to my Twitch account, so hopefully you guys show up.

60
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:47,339
It should be a great time. Probably going to do one tonight too.

61
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,339
Tuesday and Friday probably is when I'm going to do it.

62
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,339
So let's get back into the gameplay now. No more talking about my dumb livestream.

63
00:04:54,339 --> 00:05:01,769
So as you can probably tell, it's becoming painfully obvious that this team can't even get out of the spawn doors.

64
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,769
They're getting up here instantly dying. They can't even get close.

65
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:07,769
They can't even get remotely close to the point.

66
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:12,769
So I'm just kind of hanging back here thinking to myself, should I do something about this?

67
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:15,769
Should I switch teams or something and make something happen?

68
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:19,769
And you'll see my conscience really takes hold of me after about another minute or so.

69
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:24,769
You'll see what happens. And ultimately you'll see how this ends.

70
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:29,009
So anyways, shooting more spam, getting more random kills, going to fill my ammo up.

71
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:33,009
I get Ubered right here in about two or three seconds. I think it's right here.

72
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:38,009
Yep, I get Ubered. We come down to the spawn, start spawn camping, just being real jerks.

73
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:43,009
I hate when people do this and every time I find myself doing this I always go,

74
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,180
Okay, let's turn around. I don't want to do this anymore. This is not fun.

75
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,420
Because it's dumb. It really is dumb doing this.

76
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:57,970
So you'll see after about another five or ten seconds we get back down into their spawn area and I just kill myself.

77
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,459
I just go right in front of their spawn door. I drop three stickies.

78
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:05,459
I kill myself and then I switch teams.

79
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,699
And after the team switch you'll see what happens. It's insane.

80
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:13,699
I can't even begin to describe how insane this is after I kill myself.

81
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:18,009
So let's just turn around here, spam a few more times, maybe get one more kill.

82
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:21,009
I think I get one more kill here. Yep, it's one. Here it is.

83
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:26,009
One last kill. Here we go. Going back down to their spawn there's a heavy and a sniper.

84
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:29,009
I get the kill on the heavy and then here we go.

85
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,009
Boom, see you later heavy.

86
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,180
Okay, time to kill the spawn, right?

87
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,180
Let's load this door up with stickies and then walk into it and kill myself.

88
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,899
So now I'm on blue team. I just switched to blue team.

89
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:48,250
Take a look at the time. Three minutes and 47 seconds.

90
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,250
Come out here just spamming like crazy. Get a couple kills.

91
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:57,250
I want to make something happen. It was a goal of mine, guys, to be able to win this game now.

92
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,550
Medic Pyro coming up towards the spawn.

93
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,550
Get the kill on me, but my teammates are so fed up at this point, I believe,

94
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,550
that they just started to push really, really hard.

95
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,550
This Medic-Soldier pair really do a lot of work and they really help the team out a lot.

96
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,790
Too much suppression, too much domination.

97
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,790
Kill the Sentry and the Engineer making it and now we're...

98
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,790
Look at the movement. Look at how fast everyone is just jumping up here to get on the point.

99
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,790
Now this wasn't all me, guys.

100
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,790
It's kind of coincidental that I switched and now all of a sudden we're winning,

101
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,790
but really I think this team was just getting sick of being in the spawn

102
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,029
and they really started to make a push.

103
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,029
Now look at the time. I want you to take a look at the time.

104
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:39,029
Seven minutes and 28 seconds.

105
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:43,029
Let's count down to see when the game ends, okay?

106
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,029
Watch this. Get out here. There's nobody really here, by the way.

107
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:50,209
There's one Soldier who kind of gets dominated by that group that was right there.

108
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:54,209
Engineer is trying to build a Sentry on the point and I think I distracted him enough

109
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,209
that he decided I was going to be his top priority and not build up a Sentry

110
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:01,209
and it ends up being the downfall of the team.

111
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:04,209
Take a look now. Everybody is starting to get on the point.

112
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:09,209
We're going to cap it now. We win the game in less than two minutes

113
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:12,209
after switching to the blue team. We won.

114
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:15,209
Unbelievable. I can't believe it. I was speechless when it happened.

115
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:19,449
I said, holy crap. Talk about a gameplay that's a keeper right there.

116
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,449
Anyways, thank you all so much for watching. I really appreciate it.

117
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:27,449
Show up at my livestream Fridays and Tuesdays probably around 7 to 8 o'clock Eastern Standard Time

118
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:29,620
is when I'm going to do them.

119
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,620
Take care, everybody. I'll see you all soon.
