00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,759
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm not gonna be honest, I have absolutely no idea what's gonna be in the background.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,940
And I have to apologize because my voice probably sounds like shit.

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,940
And there's a reason for that, I actually just got back from PAX.

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,429
I slept an entire day. I haven't done that.

6
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:41,149
Let me tell you, I have not slept an entire day, like a full 16-hour period since I got diagnosed with Crohn's disease.

7
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:45,149
This has not happened in a long time. I was really tired.

8
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:52,149
For good measure, I had a fantastic time at PAX at a blast all four days in Seattle.

9
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:54,149
And I want to tell you guys my thoughts on some things.

10
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,579
First of all, this is gonna be pretty casual. My last video was a casual commentary as well.

11
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:04,579
But as you can imagine, I've been away for almost a full work week.

12
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:10,579
I've been almost gone for five days. So I haven't had a whole lot of time to make any content or do any real videos.

13
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,579
I had some things go up over the weekend.

14
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:17,760
And I do apologize for that because I like to get like three, four, five videos uploaded every week.

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,760
And I'm gonna get back into it today. I actually have a lot of things planned.

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,760
So stay tuned. And before I forget about it, while I was at PAX, I passed 150,000 subscribers.

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:35,189
So huge thank you, everybody. It seems like just yesterday I was at 100,000 subscribers.

18
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,189
And I just woke up one day, looked at the thing, and I was like, wow, we're at 150,000 subscribers right now.

19
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:45,430
That's unbelievable. And it's happening faster. My channel's growing.

20
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:51,609
It's crazy, guys. It really is. I can't thank you all enough for everything you do for this channel.

21
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:57,609
Every day when I wake up and I look at how many views or how many likes or how much my channel's grown,

22
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:03,299
it's one of the most humbling experiences of my entire life is doing this YouTube thing.

23
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,599
It's one of the reasons why I like meeting you guys so much.

24
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,599
Like the guys at PAX Prime, there was a couple dozen of you guys that ended up flagging me down.

25
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:16,599
We did a couple little meetups. It's awesome to see you guys face to face and what you guys look like,

26
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,599
how you guys act, what you guys think about games and where you're from and how you got there, how you're going home.

27
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:30,599
I love that shit so much. So if you ever see me at an event or on the street, just come say hello.

28
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,599
I will talk to you for as long as I can. And that means a lot to me.

29
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:38,599
So we're going to move on from that, though, guys. Thank you all so much again for 150k.

30
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,599
And we're going to talk about PAX. We're going to talk about the things at PAX that I really liked

31
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,599
and the things at PAX that I really didn't like. And we'll start with the good news and the bad news.

32
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,210
We'll start with the bad news first. Mugenics was not playable.

33
00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:00,210
Mugenics had a very, very stuffed in the corner, like pretend we're not here booth at PAX Prime.

34
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:05,210
And that was one of the most saddening things of the entire weekend for me because a lot of you guys know

35
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,210
I was so excited for Mugenics. I was so happy to see that they were going to bring it out there.

36
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,210
Maybe they were going to show some stuff. It was going to be like playable or it was going to be cool.

37
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:20,580
No. The only thing they really had there was T-shirts and Super Meat Boy on two or three computers

38
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,580
in the back of their booth. That was really it. They showed a little teaser trailer, like a little cinematic

39
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,580
for Mugenics, and they had a big cutout post thing where you could put your face in a cat's ass.

40
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,580
And that's funny and all, but I wanted to really play it. I wanted to talk to them about the development of the game.

41
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,580
I wanted to really put myself in their shoes, and I really wanted to play the game, but I couldn't play it

42
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,389
because I wasn't playable. You get the idea.

43
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:50,270
For the good, I will say my top few things at PAX are definitely in the top three, at least WildStar.

44
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:57,270
WildStar looks like it's going to be fantastic. I didn't get a chance to play it because the problem with MMOs

45
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:04,580
at a big gaming event like a PAX or like an E3 or something like that, it's really difficult to get on one of those machines

46
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,580
because people get really invested. They get sucked into it. They want to play more. They want to get more into it,

47
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,580
and they don't leave the machine for like 20 or 30 minutes when there's people behind them wanting to play.

48
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,579
So here's my advice. What I suggest to any developers or anybody, it doesn't matter if it's an MO or an action game,

49
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:27,819
FPS, doesn't matter. Bring back the, it's-a-me, Mario. Thank you for playing. Goodbye.

50
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:31,990
Do you remember that screen? How many of you guys remember going to GameStop or going to Blockbuster

51
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,990
and sitting and playing one of the consoles they had set up, and after you played for like five or 10 minutes,

52
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,990
the game would turn off and you'd get that screen with Mario telling you to get the fuck out of the line.

53
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:48,990
Like that thing has to come back for all these events. And you could kind of include this into things I didn't like about PAX

54
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:55,990
because that type of screen, that like Mario get out of line screen, should be on all these machines at PAX.

55
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:03,490
It really should be. But regardless of that, I highly suggest you keep an eye on WildStar and sign up for that beta.

56
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:09,490
If you're into MMOs, it's very action-oriented. No more of this just like stand still and auto-attack people.

57
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,490
No, that's not the combat of this game. It's a lot more fluid, a lot more skillshots.

58
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,490
It seems like a lot more fun than really anything on the market right now.

59
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,490
So keep an eye on it. Go sign up for the beta because it's hard to frigging get into that beta.

60
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,490
And you want to be on that list early. So when they include a lot of people, you'll be on it.

61
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:34,110
Other than WildStar though, I'd probably tell you to keep your eye on Titanfall.

62
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:42,110
You've probably heard plenty of people talk about this game already, but I was so misinformed about this game, it's not even funny.

63
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:47,110
First of all, I thought it was only on Xbox One. Eh, that's wrong. It's on PC as well.

64
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,110
Second of all, I thought it was a single-player game with like a multiplayer afterthought. Eh, that's also wrong.

65
00:05:53,110 --> 00:06:00,110
It's multiplayer only, kind of like a Team Fortress 2 where the whole game from the ground up is only for multiplayer.

66
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,110
It's cool, it's crazy, it's mech suits. It's a lot different than what you're used to.

67
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:13,930
This is not like Call of Duty 7 Black Ops Ghosts vs. the Ghosts and 2 Train Warfare.

68
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,930
No, this is completely different and I can't wait for more information about this game.

69
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:27,300
I wish I got a chance to play it, but I didn't and I'm very, very unfortunately mad that I did not get a chance to sit in line and wait for...

70
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,300
And I didn't get to do it. But what is cool about that game is...

71
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,730
Yay! Okay, what? Okay, let's move on. So, we're going to talk about one more thing.

72
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,160
Well, actually two more things that I thought were really interesting in packs.

73
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,160
And they're both indie games. If you're into indie games, then put the cone up to your ear like an old person back in like the 1800s.

74
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:56,339
And listen to this. So, Octodad 2. Well, not really Octodad 2, but Octodad Deadliest Catch.

75
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,339
Looks like a great game. It's got a brand new revamped graphics engine.

76
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:03,339
Got a bunch of new things to do as the Octopus Father.

77
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:08,339
And I've played almost that whole game on this channel. So when that game actually releases, I'm going to be playing a lot of it.

78
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:13,509
So keep your eye on that one. Also for indie stuff, Wasteland Kings.

79
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,509
Not sure if you guys have heard of this, but it's by the Vlambeer guys.

80
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:22,509
I did a couple of Vlambeer games on this channel. I did Radical Fishing. Well, Ridiculous Fishing and Super Crate Box.

81
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:29,689
It's the same guys. It's this crazy like top-down rogue-like shooter where you have like a ton of different weapons and upgrades.

82
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:35,689
It looks... That's actually a prototype. I'm going to put in the description a link to the prototype of the game.

83
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,689
It's free. And you can check it out for yourself and see what you think about that.

84
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:41,689
But other than that, I kind of want to wrap this video up. I don't want to get too long.

85
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:47,689
I do want to say a very, very heartfelt thank you for 150,000 subscribers, guys.

86
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:54,689
And I'm very tired. You could probably already tell this right now. I'm living on caffeine this last couple of days.

87
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:57,689
So I'm probably going to go back and lie down after recording this video.

88
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:00,860
But stay tuned for more stuff. I've got like a frog in my throat right now.

89
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,860
But I'm not going to redo this video, so I'm going to get progressively worse.

90
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,860
But anyways, guys, thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

91
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,860
And I'll see you all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
