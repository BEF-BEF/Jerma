1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,710
Um, yeah, I have one. Oh, did you just die?

2
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,500
What just happened did you just fall off the bridge

3
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,839
Seriously, I fell through one of the holes in the damn bridge. I'm like

4
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,399
Were you recording yeah, I

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,520
Say we just give you all this stuff back I had the enchanted it's all gone down there man. Oh

6
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:48,659
Jeez, I

7
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:51,729
Don't think I took a backup of this map. Oh

8
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,770
last time okay, I

9
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,250
Guess that's all we need hopefully

10
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:04,680
There's I there's a creeper out here though. All right, we'll take care of them. We got three doors

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,879
We got two creepers actually, that's that's the way to the creepers

12
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,879
Alright, so let's go the back door. I

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Don't see anything

14
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,920
Okay, okay, we're good we're good got that one got that one we didn't shut the door though

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,359
All right, we'll shut the door after we kill this bastard

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,530
You're gonna blow up. What are you doing? I'm pushing him back. I'm doing like the sprint attack

17
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,670
He's like honest. He's chilling on top of the tree. Now. He's like he's like I'm pretty cool up here

18
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,730
He's like a tree frog. What is he doing? I?

19
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,250
Think with the

20
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,489
One point with one point two. It's like they're more scared to jump down. It seems like they are

21
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,849
Already, I'm gonna try and wow what he really isn't coming down. Oh

22
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:53,859
There he goes watch out

23
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:02,060
There we go. Nice got a nice little crit hit on him close that door close the door and onwards we go. All right, so I

24
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,780
For those of you that don't know I just ruined everything essentially. I

25
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:14,219
I broke a bunch of stuff because I fell in the lava with the enchanted bow and pretty much

26
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:17,340
I'm just a terrible person. So that's uh, that's that story

27
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,539
Hold shift from now on that's what we got to do. He's kind of like cross the bridge. Oh, I

28
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:25,909
Totally forgot about that

29
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:29,050
While holding shift if you hold shift that you won't fall through

30
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:35,319
And also for those of you wondering Leptor is away on vacation

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,319
So we had to continue on briefly without him

32
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:48,639
Yep, and he should be back pretty soon man though with the one block wide stuffs really scary

33
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:57,550
Yeah, I I couldn't believe I fell through that. I couldn't believe it. I don't know how to really destroy spiderwebs

34
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:05,129
Maybe a pickaxe is faster. They seem like they take a long time to break sword sword. Okay

35
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,810
You sir win

36
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:15,020
All right, you I guess whoa, they're awesome traps apparently laid

37
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,460
And we've got a mob spawner right here

38
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,960
So all I have to do is destroy it with the wooden pick before it spawns any any pesky spiders

39
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,270
And there's a chest in here, too. You shouldn't attempt this if you are not yet ready. I'm feeling it's going to explode

40
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:37,479
That's what I feel. So you so I should open it then look down here. Look down here. Oh wow

41
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,520
Frozen waterfall, that's pretty crazy. So all right, you know, you don't think you want me to open this

42
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
Here's what we should do

43
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,500
Okay, if one of us needs to stand like way back here where it's safe like as far back as possible

44
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,699
I have the most stuff so go ahead and open it and if it starts hissing run for your life

45
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:03,169
Okay, here we go. Oh my god. There's a lot of stuff in here. Is it hissing? No, but it's I'm scared

46
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:06,129
There's a ton of leather. There's a ton. I don't know. How do I take things really fast? There we go

47
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,340
Something's gonna explode with

48
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,819
Out of the chest, okay

49
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
What's going on? You're stuck in the you're stuck

50
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:24,379
Okay, that was yeah, if you shouldn't attempt this yeah, right, I think maybe they mean the drop down here

51
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,360
Alright, I got a bunch of leather

52
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,120
Alright, let's go back over here where it's kind of safe and like craft that leather into armor for you real quick

53
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,509
Yeah, make sure I don't waste it this time. I want to say the raw fish is just like one

54
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:44,939
So I think I'm gonna go ahead and eat one of those. Yeah, we got company. There's a there's a skeleton coming down here

55
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,339
Well with the with the update they're gonna stay in the shadow

56
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,800
So they're not gonna follow you too far while the Sun is shining bright in the sky. There's another one up there

57
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,819
I'll get him. I'll get this rat bastard. So do you want to go up? Oh, wow watch out behind you

58
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,100
Well, they just pulled out it's alright we're good. Oh, there's like a cup

59
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,680
There's like a bunch of spawners in here

60
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,120
Do we want to do this first or do we want to do like the waterfall thing first down there? Oh, well

61
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,740
I guess we're already in here might as well destroy the spawner. Okay. Oh watch out hit that guy

62
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,480
Yeah, leave him alone. He's my friend

63
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,759
Yeah, one of us has to like distract while the other one which has like destroys and if you want to destroy one

64
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,230
It's with your pickaxe. I don't have a pickaxe. Oh, yeah. Whoa. Yeah

65
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:40,560
That guy yeah, I'm getting close to being dead close. Okay

66
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,709
How's your hunger doing? I got 70%

67
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,350
All right here take take this bread and once your hungers full you'll start healing automatically

68
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:55,310
Bunch of a bunch of coal bunch of arrows in this chest bones

69
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:02,910
Do you still have a bow? I do. I guess you took the arrows already. Yeah

70
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:08,269
What we should do is like all these bones are gonna be really valuable

71
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:11,750
So I'm thinking just put them in a chest. Yeah, like make a chest over here

72
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,870
Do you still have the crafting table down here? It's still down there

73
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,600
It's down. Also, um, oh never mind. We got this heel pad out here

74
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,279
So if we start running out of food, we can like retreat and like heal up. All right

75
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,819
Hey, you want me to throw these bones down to you? Oh, sure

76
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,170
All right, where should I? Oh, it's creeper behind you creeper creeper coming up behind you

77
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:42,009
What where did they just fall? I just like throw it down then like the water. I think I see them

78
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:46,250
Gotta watch out for this guy though. Oh, wait, can I like shoot him with the oh, you got up

79
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,209
We got a zombie here, too. Don't don't waste the arrows unless you have to okay. He's in the water

80
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:57,290
So I'm just oh now he's up man. They're crafty. They're cunning. Yeah, watch yourself. Okay. I'm safe

81
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:05,019
I'm gonna throw all the bones down at you. There's a zombie coming for one of us and now a thunderstorm

82
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:14,060
What was that? It was like it was just thunder. Oh, oh, I gotta turn my volume down again. Get that son of a B

83
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:21,910
Right. Well, what does it mean? There's just a thing of fire just sitting here burning on obsidian. Where are we at?

84
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,170
This is um, there's like see I think that's just netherrack

85
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,209
Bunch, but I put all the redstone torches around it kind of freaked me out

86
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:35,420
I got a bunch of arrows. No, here's uh, here's seven more. Oh

87
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,459
All right. Here's what we're gonna have to do. See how the floor is made out of obsidian. Yeah

88
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:49,579
That's scary because there could be explosions here obsidian is resistant to explosions. So like, you know, I'm saying like the floor won't crumble

89
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:56,459
Okay, there's something explodes. So be careful when you're removing these redstone torches because they could set off

90
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,300
explosion

91
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:06,129
Yeah, so we gotta listen. All right, we're good. And that's that netherrack

92
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:11,370
So is this just that's it. There's nothing else here. I don't I hope we don't just randomly explode

93
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,129
I feel like there should be like another

94
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,579
Area or something. Well, what's with like the broken edges on these walls? You know what I mean?

95
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:23,500
See how like the walls are kind of cracked over here. Um, I

96
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:32,100
What's that mean? Yeah, that's I don't know that. Oh, there's another area good fine. Gerber fine. Watch out. That's lava

97
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,139
Can you get that chest without ooh

98
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,340
Golden sword, which is not the greatest thing in the world, but there's another one over here. Okay

99
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,019
Do you have a pickaxe? Did I already ask you that? I do not have a pickaxe

100
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:50,480
It take mine. I've got a lot more stuff than you so break break the other side

101
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,679
I'm really scared. Someone's gonna explode in here

102
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,299
Here we go. I'm like trying to stay as far back as I can. All right

103
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:04,899
It's a very long hallway and a sign you can have that back

104
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:11,610
You want me to go first? I guess man obsidian hall

105
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:18,090
Well, nothing can get through us in this hallway shivering sands one record. So there's a this is a whole nother area

106
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,090
It sounds like well

107
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,700
Apparently you drop down. That looks kind of sketchy. I don't know about that
