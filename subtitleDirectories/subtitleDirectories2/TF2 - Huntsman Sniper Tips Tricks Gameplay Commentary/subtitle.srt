00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,700
Yo, what's up guys, it's Jerma again. I'm bringing you a quick gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,939
This time I am the Huntsman Sniper on Gold Rush. I made this video specifically to give

3
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:15,500
you guys some real tips and strategies to use with the Huntsman. A lot of people don't

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,219
know how to aim with it, a lot of people have trouble with it, so I figured I'd make this

5
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:22,980
video giving you real tips and strategies. The first kill is a Spy covered in Girardi

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,440
in the back. He goes down, which brings me to the first point I want to make about the

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,140
is timing. You want to make sure that before you shoot an arrow that you hold your mouse

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,979
button down for at least two seconds. This is incredibly important when trying to get

9
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:44,259
timing down because if you do not have an arrow prepared, you're going to be freaking

10
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:49,280
out and going, oh, I've got to hold it down now. You have to make sure that you have an

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,700
arrow ready to go before you even think about shooting. It's very, very, very important.

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,859
The best way to do it really, in my opinion, is to have an arrow ready to go before you

13
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,060
even turn a corner. You'll see what happens right here. Watch. Here it comes. See? You

14
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,379
have an arrow primed, it's ready to go, there's one in the chamber, and you can just release

15
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:13,200
it when you are comfortable. Being comfortable is the most important thing when using this

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
weapon. Mostly because if you're uncomfortable using the Huntsman, you are not going to make

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,760
any shots, you're going to miss everybody, and you're going to freak out. You're going

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,400
to think you're going to have a shot ready to go, you're going to be prepared for it,

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,079
you're going to see somebody coming, and you're just going to miss because you're not

20
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,180
comfortable. Loosen up a little bit, lighten up, get familiar with the weapon before you

21
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,459
even try to go into a server. Go into a private server and just take shots at random things,

22
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:43,700
at signs, at bots, make a bot, appear a bot. It's a good way to get yourself comfortable

23
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:50,230
with the weapon. Now, let's talk about arrow placement. Arrow placement fully relies on

24
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:57,239
your ability to predict the path of enemy players. What does that mean? That means that

25
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,599
if you can tell where somebody's going to run, not where they're currently running,

26
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:07,099
but where they are going to run, you will succeed immensely with the Huntsman. A good

27
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:12,500
example is up here. See, I just tried to predict the movement of that Demoman. I was wrong,

28
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,979
but I still tried. Stationary targets are pretty easy, like this engineer up there,

29
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:20,699
I killed his sentry. But here we go, right here, this is a great example of what I'm

30
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:25,460
talking about. I will freeze it for you, shoot this Heavy, and then watch. Check out where

31
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,539
my cursor is in regards to the Heavy. I'm at least four feet in front of him, release

32
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:35,659
the arrow at the right time, and boom, slow motion headshot on the Heavy, and I'm very,

33
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:39,979
very far away. That's what you want to do with the Huntsman. You want to make sure that

34
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:45,000
you lead your targets on, rather than shoot where they are, shoot where they're going

35
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,439
to be. A lot of these same techniques can be put into place for the other projectile

36
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,240
weapons. These do not work for hitscan weapons, so if you're using the scatter gun or the

37
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,360
shotgun, don't, you know, aim five feet in front of somebody. It's only for the projectile

38
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,000
weapons, like the rocket launcher, the grenade launcher, the lock and load actually is a

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,439
good example, too, of leading a target. The syringe gun, too, also is a good example

40
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,930
of leading your targets. The final thing I want to talk about in regards to the Huntsman

41
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:21,289
is the spam aspect of this weapon. This, just like the rocket launcher, the grenade launcher,

42
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:27,650
all those spammy spam weapons, this tops them all, because you can get an instant kill if

43
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,930
you just spam. That's a nice headshot on that spy, by the way. You can get instant kills

44
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,210
by spamming this weapon. See how I'm just shooting into towards their spawn? You will

45
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:42,110
get a lucky headshot. One out of ten times that happens. That's why this weapon has the

46
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:47,789
synonymously named Luxman, is what it's called by a lot of people. A couple of quick kills

47
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:51,669
here, and then I realize we're all going to get in the cart. This engineer gets backstabbed,

48
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:55,430
even though it made the sound like I hit him. That was kind of weird. So we get on the cart,

49
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,189
and this is what I'm talking about in regards to spam. This demo man goes down from the

50
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:03,509
Girardia thrown up, and here we go. Spam this arrow over here. I get a headshot on that

51
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:08,469
disguised spy. Another spam headshot right here, and that is a perfectly good example

52
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:14,729
of just murdering people accidentally. And we win the game. Everyone's on the cart. Thank

53
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:19,069
you everybody for watching again. I appreciate it. I hope you got something out of this video

54
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:23,930
because it's how I learned. So hopefully you can learn too, because it's a lot of fun once

55
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,089
you know how to use this item. So take care guys. I'll see you next time.
