00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,949
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jirba here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:21,949
And tonight, gonna be playing as a class in the game. It's a 9 class game. The 10th class is the Swedish Chef.

3
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:29,949
That was confirmed by Grape Newell. Anyways, this video is gonna be kind of a rant video, and it's not gonna talk about Team Fortress 2.

4
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:33,950
Team Fortress 2, get it out of your head. It's just some gameplay I had lying around for the background.

5
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:44,950
And it's gonna talk about betas, and how some games are in sort of an everlasting beta, and it's to the detriment of the game and the company.

6
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,640
It's gonna be a discussion video slash casual commentary. You know the idea.

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,820
So this theory of the everlasting beta has only really been a theory for like, maybe 5 years.

8
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,990
Before that, if you go maybe 10 years ago in the gaming industry, betas and alphas were never really a thing.

9
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:10,489
Companies wanted to keep their projects and their ideas closed because they were an unfinished product.

10
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:14,489
You don't want to make a sandwich for somebody and give them just the bread and the cheese.

11
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:17,489
You know, where's the bologna? Where's the ham? Where's the onion? Where's the mustard?

12
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:20,489
You know, where's all the stuff that makes the sandwich the sandwich?

13
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:26,859
Companies didn't like doing that. But now, companies do it like as if it's a standard practice.

14
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:36,859
You know, you got the steam green light, the steam early access, where you pretty much pay to get into the alpha of a game, an unfinished game, and we're expected to be okay with that.

15
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:42,859
And we are. I am okay with getting into alphas and getting into betas and supporting companies.

16
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:50,859
But I think this is kind of the conundrum that happens when you open up your game to an alpha or a beta, and it's in that state for a very long time.

17
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:56,349
Think about it like this. You have a product that you want a lot of people to be excited for.

18
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,349
You have this great thing, this great idea, this new thing you're trying to work on.

19
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:02,530
It's a new game, and you tell everybody about it.

20
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,530
You tell your friends, your family, everybody. You yell it on the bus. You scream it on.

21
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,530
You tell everybody to come and check out this game.

22
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,530
That's not quite done yet. It could be broken. There could be massive technical problems.

23
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:24,139
The game could have unfinished content, and your peak of excitement trying to get people involved in a project ends up being a bad thing,

24
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:33,310
because two or three years down the line, when the game actually releases, with all the bugs fixed, with all the stuff, all the new content, all the classes finished or whatever,

25
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:41,110
people don't really care anymore. They cared back when they really weren't supposed to, if that makes any sense.

26
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,110
And I think the game that really set this all in motion, and the game that started this whole,

27
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:53,719
check us out in alpha and be a part of the alpha through the beta until we actually, quote, release the game, is Minecraft.

28
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:57,719
Minecraft went on to be a massive success, a huge game.

29
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:05,900
One of the most popular games really ever made is Minecraft over the course of the last three or four years when it first came out in, what, 2009?

30
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:17,199
That game, Minecraft was a thing in 2009, and it took them almost three years, two and a half years, I think, to actually say the game is out.

31
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,199
And I feel like companies are trying to follow suit with that.

32
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:25,199
They saw that success and saw how cool that was, and they were like, hey, we got a game that's in alpha.

33
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,439
Why don't we just release that and we'll be millionaires by next Tuesday?

34
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,439
That is a detriment to some of these companies because they have this great idea. They have this cool thing.

35
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:41,439
Minecraft was Minecraft. It's almost impossible to replicate the success that that game had in alpha.

36
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:47,439
It was word of mouth. It was the first time anyone had really ever done something like that, opening the game up to alpha.

37
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:54,620
Now, there are some games that were opened up as alphas and betas, but this was the first one that was really pushed by a lot of people in the community.

38
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,620
And trying to follow that, trying to say, hey, well, come check out our game in alpha, too.

39
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,979
It's like a technical broken mess, but come on, we're Minecraft, right?

40
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:17,980
I think that needs to stop because I've played at least, at least, two or three games that were in early access alpha or early betas, closed, closed betas,

41
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,980
that I got really into and I thought were really interesting ideas.

42
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:29,980
And then a year or two down the line when it's still in that testing quote phase, I'm not really into the game anymore.

43
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:37,980
And I can't pull myself back to want to be in that game anymore because I already got my fill of it when it wasn't really a complete game.

44
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:44,420
And then fast forward another few months or another six months, 12 months, another year.

45
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:54,420
Am I really going to be that excited when game XYZ comes out, when I already heard about it, already played it, when it was an open access beta, open beta like two years ago?

46
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:01,779
Probably not. And I think companies need to still have that mindset where keeping stuff up your sleeve,

47
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:07,779
keep that magician's trick up your sleeve and tell people about it when it really should be told.

48
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:19,649
Now, this is absolutely not me making a video saying, never be into an open access or early beta game because you will be disappointed, Harry.

49
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:24,649
Don't take this video like that. Professor Snape asks you nicely.

50
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:31,949
All I'm saying is before you put all your eggs into a basket, into an alpha or a beta, think about the future.

51
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:38,949
Think about if you're actually going to care if you put hundreds or even thousands of hours into an unfinished game,

52
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:44,129
that when the everlasting beta ends and you get your hands on it again, you're kind of underwhelmed.

53
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:47,300
Don't let that happen to you because it's happened to me.

54
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,860
But anyways, guys, that's going to wrap up this video. Thank you all so much for watching.

55
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,860
I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys all next time.

56
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:06,029
And of course, take care, everybody, especially you, Harry Potter, because you are disappointing all of your fellow students.
