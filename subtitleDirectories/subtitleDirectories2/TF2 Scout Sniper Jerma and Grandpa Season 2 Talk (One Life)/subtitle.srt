1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,500
Hey, what is going on everybody? Chirrma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,500
And tonight's gonna have two one-life gameplays back-to-back here. I'm in a one-life mood.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,500
I really don't know why, but the last couple of days it's been all about the streaks, less about the full gameplays.

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:34,679
But today, I have a very, very special guest. And it is, of course, you probably guessed it by the title,

5
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:42,920
Grandpa. Because, of course, Grandpa is an MLG pro, is returning to Machinima Respawn tonight.

6
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:49,920
That is right. Well, actually, let me rephrase that. There's gonna be a trailer tonight for the second season of Grandpa.

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,920
And it's pretty crazy. I had a lot of fun doing it, a lot of fun making it.

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,920
So, 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time tonight. I'm not sure when this video is gonna go up today,

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,920
but 8 p.m. Eastern Time is when the Grandpa MLG Season 2 trailer is gonna be on Machinima Respawn.

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,099
So, check that out. Please everybody go support it. Like you always do, you guys are incredible.

11
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:18,099
But, let's break down the gameplays for a second before Grandpa makes his appearance.

12
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:21,099
So, the gameplays, of course, are gonna be Scout and Sniper.

13
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:27,099
Using mostly the defaults, because, of course, my final 33% of my backpack was given away.

14
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:31,099
So, all I got is a bunch of strangers and a couple of untradeable hats and stuff.

15
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:35,510
So, I'm working my way back. Let's just put it that way.

16
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:41,510
So, it's gonna be the regular Scattergun, the Mad Milk, which apparently I still had, and the default Bat.

17
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,510
And for the Sniper, gonna be default Sniper Rifle, the Jurati, I think. Yeah, the Jurati.

18
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:53,120
And the Shiv, the Travelman Shiv. That was a nice derp moment right there.

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,120
But yeah, anyways, I hope you guys enjoy those. They're gonna be in the background.

20
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,120
But I am bringing on Grandpa right now. Yes?

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
It's time for me to come on.

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Yes, you are coming on right now.

23
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Yes.

24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,120
So, we want to talk about Season 2. We want to talk about some frequently asked questions to Grandpa.

25
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,120
These are all for me, right?

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Yes.

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
They're all for me.

28
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,120
None of these are gonna be for me. These are questions all for you.

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
They better be.

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,300
Okay.

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,300
I'm not gonna sit down here if they're not all for me.

32
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,300
These questions are frequently asked, and I gotta tell you guys.

33
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,300
To you guys for all the support you give me in my video game shit.

34
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,300
It's very, very awesome.

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,300
And let's start with the questions, Jeremy.

36
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,300
Okay, all right.

37
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,539
So, question number one is, what is your favorite Team Fortress 2 class?

38
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,780
The Heavy. It's the Heavy. There's no doubt in my mind it's the Heavy.

39
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,780
Because you just hold the right mouse button down, and you just annihilate people.

40
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,780
Why would you ever play as any other class?

41
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,780
Why is it not just all Heavies versus all Heavies?

42
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,780
I don't see a reason for anything else.

43
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,780
I mean, why wouldn't you? You're the most powerful thing in the game.

44
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,780
It wouldn't work. Team Fortress 2, it says it right in the title.

45
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,780
It's all balanced around the certain classes.

46
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,780
If everyone went Heavy on one team, there would be two snipers that would just have a field day.

47
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,780
No, that wouldn't really work.

48
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,780
Spies, too. You'd get one spy on the team. It would kill nine people.

49
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,780
No, but you're wrong.

50
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,780
Because if you have two Heavies, one standing in front of you and one standing behind you,

51
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,780
you're not going to be in the fucking sandwich. Oh, I forgot. I can't swear on your channel.

52
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,080
That's okay, but keep it to a minimum.

53
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,449
So, anyways, okay, so Heavy's your favorite class.

54
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:35,800
So the second question is, what is Grandpa's favorite video game?

55
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,800
It can be from ten years ago or yesterday, whatever came out. I don't know.

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
No, that's an easy one. That's Call of Duty 4.

57
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,800
It's Modern Warfare 4. It was called something like that.

58
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,800
That's a good rest of the best game I've ever played. It was perfect balance, perfect kill streaks.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,800
That's my favorite game. College 4 is my favorite.

60
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,979
You got a second favorite? Because, I mean, mine probably goes Team Fortress, Diablo.

61
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,979
I mean, I got a lot, so I got like probably four or five favorite games.

62
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:11,280
Well, it would probably be College 4 and then Leisure Suit Larry, the first one.

63
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
What? No.

64
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,279
Yeah, that was a fun game. It was a point-and-click adventure game, but it was really screwed up.

65
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:24,279
There was all kinds of adult stuff going on. That was my favorite game, I tell you. I had a lot of fun playing that.

66
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:32,709
All right, so Call of Duty 4 and Leisure Suit Larry. That makes perfect sense, apparently.

67
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:39,129
So one more question before the video is over. This question gets asked all the time, Grandpa.

68
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:42,129
This is asked the most out of any of these questions.

69
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:43,129
Let's hear it.

70
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:52,060
When are we going to see your face? When are we going to get a Grandpa face cam video?

71
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:59,230
Oh, you want to see my face, huh? You want to see my face? Okay. Put a date and time on it.

72
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:06,230
We are going to see Grandpa's face on December 22, 2012.

73
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,230
Because if the goddamn world doesn't end, then I swear to God I'll do it.

74
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:16,230
So be sure to be ready to say that. December 22, after the world collapses.

75
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,230
So that's a good thing to look forward to.

76
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,230
I would probably also say that, too.

77
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,230
Thank you for showing up here, Grandpa. The video is over.

78
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,230
So guys, make sure to check...

79
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:34,230
Make sure you check out my Machinima Respond series on Saturdays at 8 p.m. Eastern Time.

80
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,230
And that's Grandpa's and MLG Pro Season 2.

81
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,230
It started May 12th. So get your ass over there and go watch the trailer.

82
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,230
Okay, bye.

83
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,230
Alright, see you later.

84
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,230
See you later, bye, asshole.

85
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,540
Okay. Thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

86
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,019
And I will see you guys all next time. So take care, everybody.
