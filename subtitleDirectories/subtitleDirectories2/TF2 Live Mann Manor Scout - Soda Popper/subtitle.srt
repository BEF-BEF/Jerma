1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:10,619
Hey, what is going on, you ghouls and ghosts? It's me, Jerma, from the past or the future.

2
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:16,460
No, I'm kind of just here in the present. But we're on Man Manor tonight for a live commentary,

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,940
getting in the Halloween spirit more and more every day.

4
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:25,100
Seems like everybody is playing this map, by the way. Everybody's playing Man Manor to get themselves

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,179
pumped for the Halloween update, and to get themselves pumped in general for Halloween,

6
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:35,500
which is awesome. If you are unfamiliar, this map is the Halloween update map from last year.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,899
It's got like, you know, pieces of pie, pumpkin pie, like candy and stuff like that. It's all

8
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,109
over the place. And where is everybody? Kind of weird. Getting on the point right now.

9
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:51,659
All right, there's plenty of people on each team. Uh-oh, Angie. Oh, I'm done. I'm dead. Maybe I'm

10
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,700
dead. So this is the update map, like I said, everyone's playing it. This is the map where

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,920
this huge boss comes out. If you haven't played this map, play it at least in the next couple

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,840
days or the next week or something like that, because it's very, very fun. See, look at everything.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,280
It's like candy and stuff. Mm, delicious candy. Whoa, I'm being an idiot. Not paying any attention.

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,329
Let's go. Bring it on, Pierrot. Let's go, Mr. Pierrot. Oh, you're going to get away, are you?

15
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:24,260
No, you are not. Give me that help. Oh, we got crits, baby. Oh, don't you jump in here

16
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,269
Oh, God. Speaking of crits, he has... Oh, God. All right, we got it. We got it. Let's get on it.

17
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:37,290
So yeah, a giant boss will appear. He's the headless, haunted headless horseman. Hold on,

18
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,739
let me get this right. He is the horseless headless horseman. There we go. He appears and he

19
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:48,760
just melee one hit kills every single person. It's awesome. It can get really, really annoying,

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,079
though. I will say that it can get fairly obnoxious if you're trying to play. Let's say you're like

21
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,239
a great round. It's like, oh, I just killed 12 people. Oh, here comes the frigging monster

22
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:07,530
that's going to kill us all. It's like, great. That's exactly what I needed. Oh, God. Here we go.

23
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,770
We're doing all right. Let's keep moving. Let's keep moving. Oh, crit bomb. Crit bomb. Oh, come on

24
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:23,289
now. Oh, he got away. I'm actually going to... I'm at the last point. Oh, they got a teleporter.

25
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:33,139
I'm going to sneak on them. And there it goes. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Get that candy.

26
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:40,310
So if you guys were wondering what I was being for Halloween, me and a couple of other buddies

27
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:47,189
are going to die. We're going to be the ninja turtles for Halloween. So it should be very,

28
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:53,349
very fun. We have like a whole huge getup already made. It's going to be crazy. Oh, he got the candy.

29
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,349
Oh, damn. It's going to be pretty crazy. We're being the ninja turtles, all four ninja turtles,

30
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:04,900
and one of our other friends is going to be Splinter. So we're going to go out into the town,

31
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,099
probably go into downtown Boston. Be crazy. Have some fun. Just like how you should on Halloween.

32
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,060
Don't get too crazy though. You know, don't let go egg in somebody's house or something,

33
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,460
because that's not cool. Where am I going? I keep on going way past the point.

34
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:26,379
And I keep on forgetting to not switch this. Oh, there he is. Oh, my God. There he is.

35
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,610
There he is. See, if you've never seen him before, there he is. He's running around

36
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,990
chasing somebody. I want to get a good look at him. Where is he? Oh, there he is.

37
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,879
And if you kill him with a melee kill, you get this. Oh, God, I'm it. He's coming after me now.

38
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:50,039
Let's see if I can just start smashing him. Oh, God. Pretty much this is where they got the idea

39
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:56,039
for the Saxton Hale mod. So if you're a fan of the Saxton Hale mod, this is pretty much its roots,

40
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,439
because people said, wow, that's pretty funny. And that's pretty fun. What if that person was

41
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:06,300
player controlled? And that's, I guess, where Saxton Hale was kind of born, the mod. So let's

42
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:13,849
get on. Can we even cap this point before I end this gameplay? Apparently not. Oh, lag. Lag.

43
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,639
So yeah, what are you guys doing for Halloween? Have you guys figured out what you were doing yet?

44
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,819
I'm kind of wondering, because I know some of you guys gave me your ideas, and some of them

45
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:35,910
were actually pretty good. Some, oh, God. Oh, what? What the hell? Did he just rage DC? What was that?

46
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:46,069
Oh, I got to get him. He doesn't even know where I am. He doesn't even know where I am.

47
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:57,990
All right, we got the point. We got it. Let's go. Oh, boy. Oh, can I get it? Can I get it?

48
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:05,610
Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Give me those crits. Give me those mini crits. All right.

49
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:14,459
We're good to go. Oh, my God. Out of nowhere. Oh, you want to go melee up in here? You want to

50
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:21,180
go melee up in here? Oh, boy. Somebody's spamming from somewhere. That soldier. Come on. Keep me

51
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,500
alive. Where's the candy? Where's the candy? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Come on, Captain. Come on.

52
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:35,370
Come on. I don't have much time. Not much time. Oh, give me that. Give me that thing. We got it.

53
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:47,259
We got this. Haunted gift. There we go. Blow up that stuff. Oh, my God. Sentry and a spy.

54
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:55,560
I got an achievement. Nice. A taco lantern. I think we're about to win this game. But yeah,

55
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,600
the Halloween update is supposed to come out, I think, either tomorrow or the next day. Today is

56
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,939
Tuesday. So yeah, it should be exciting. I saw the pyro face thing with the horns and the wings.

57
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,350
That's going to be pretty ridiculous. Hopefully, hopefully, they add some of that crazy stuff and

58
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,089
we get some... Oh, hey, what's going on, sniper? Hopefully, they add some crazy stuff. I want new

59
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:23,610
weapons. Like I said, I want new weapons. New weapons. Oh, let's do some dancing. Let's do

60
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,660
some dancing. Oh, give me that. It's over. If I can get... If I pick this up, it's pretty much over.

61
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:36,180
Oh, it's over. It's over. Oh, might as well taunt. Oh, my God. Get it. No.

62
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:44,470
Oh, you got to be kidding. We got it. Nice. And top frag. Cool. But yeah, hopefully,

63
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,509
you guys have a good safe Halloween. I got a very special video going up in the next couple days. So

64
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,829
I'll see you guys all next time. Take care, everybody.
