00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,500
Hey, what is happening everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and guys, I'm in a great mood today.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,500
It is beautiful outside. You know those days where you just look outside and you say,

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,500
my god, it is a great world we live in. It's one of those days today, guys.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Hopefully you're having a good day too, but this is going to be an Engineer Widowmaker only stipulation match.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,500
And I know it's been kind of a long time. It's been maybe a month since that last spy stipulation.

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,500
And I do apologize, but I've been trying to work on other projects, trying to get a new Enlighten done.

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,500
And expect that Enlighten in the next probably three or four days. I'm still working on it, trying to get it as good as I can possibly make it.

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:01:00,500
So expect that soon. Now this video, this particular video, as I said, Engineer Widowmaker only, that means no buildings, no pistol, no sentries, no nothing.

9
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:08,739
It's only point and shoot with the Widowmaker. Now that on paper might sound kind of bad, but think about it like this.

10
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:12,739
When you build buildings, you're using metal. When you upgrade buildings, you're using metal.

11
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,739
When you do anything with any of your buildings, you're using a substantial amount of metal.

12
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:24,739
This setup allows you to use 100% of your metal and ammo, whatever you want to call it, for shooting people.

13
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:31,239
Now this is not totally recommended that you do this all the time, because obviously this is just a stipulation match.

14
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:37,239
This is not something you should be doing every time you play Engineer, because you would really irritate your team.

15
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:42,239
Your team would just be like, where's the dispensers and the teleporters? What the hell?

16
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:49,480
And you kind of have to defend yourself by going, I don't know. But every now and then it is totally worth doing this.

17
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,659
And like I was going to say before, it takes you out of the Engineer mindset. There's no nest you have to protect.

18
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,659
There's no dispenser that your teammates are going to need at level 3. You're just a powerhouse Engi.

19
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:04,659
And that can be a problem when you face a couple of different classes, like the Scout or the Heavy.

20
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:10,659
And I say those two things for very good reasons. The Heavy, of course, if you run at a Heavy with a shotgun,

21
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:13,659
I'm going to get you just dead. You're instantly going to die.

22
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:19,659
There's no way a Heavy won't kill you with this setup unless you get behind them or you catch them somehow off guard.

23
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:21,659
That's the only real way that's going to happen.

24
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,830
And I say Scout for the second reason, because they're jumping around all over the place,

25
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,830
and it can be tough to get those shots on a Scout, especially with the shotgun.

26
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,830
And it makes it even worse when you don't have a Mini Sentry backing you up shooting them.

27
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:40,389
So now I want to briefly talk about the stipulation series in general and what I plan on doing with it,

28
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:47,389
where I plan on going, because before this, I tried to get a Sniper, No Scope only, and Jurati,

29
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:52,389
which means I could throw the Jurati on somebody and obviously get the Mini Crits with the No Scope.

30
00:02:52,389 --> 00:03:00,189
I tried doing that in so many places. I tried so many times to do that, and it really just wasn't happening.

31
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:06,370
I'm still going to try and get it. I am determined to get that stipulation, because I think it's a really good idea,

32
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:12,610
a really funny idea. And another one somebody sent me a long time ago, Soda Popper and Pistol with the Scout.

33
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,610
And I can only use the Pistol to shoot, and I can use the Mini Crits.

34
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,610
So bring up the Soda Popper, run around a little bit, get the Mini Crits, switch to the Pistol.

35
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,610
I think that's a great idea.

36
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,610
But the reason why I'm talking about this right now is because these things are kind of difficult to get good gameplays on.

37
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:34,780
So expect the stipulation series to be maybe once a month now rather than once every week or once every couple weeks,

38
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,150
because it is pretty difficult to get some of these gameplays.

39
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:44,460
Speaking of the gameplay, it's coming to a close right now. I think, pretty sure I second frag or top frag.

40
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,699
I'm actually not sure. I don't remember, but I know I'm there.

41
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,699
So in the title of this video, you're probably looking at it and going,

42
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:55,699
wait, wait, wait, he's revealing something? What's he revealing? He's got an item? He's going to show us the stuff?

43
00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:00,939
That is absolutely right. I'm going to finally... I've been talking about it for so long now,

44
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:06,669
but here are the prototype items for the Heavy.

45
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:12,370
As you can see, it is a baby Heavy.

46
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,370
So we got the bonnet. We have the diaper.

47
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,370
And there's going to be a secret item that this guy, DJ Thed, he's going to be working on.

48
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,370
That's the guy who's been doing it. He'll be in the description, his link.

49
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,370
He's a really talented guy, really nice guy. And he's actually really young, too.

50
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,370
For the talent he shows and for the stuff he's doing, he's a pretty young guy.

51
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,370
So it's interesting to see that. Really cool to see that.

52
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,370
But here you go. This is the baby diaper heavy thing that I've been talking about for like four months.

53
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,370
And so this is my call to you guys.

54
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,850
What do you think this set should be called?

55
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,220
Should this be called the Big Baby?

56
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,220
Should it be called the Fat Heavy Diaper Bastard?

57
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,220
I'm leaving it up to you guys.

58
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,220
I want to pick the coolest name for this set.

59
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,649
So drop that into the comments section of this video and I will pick the best one.

60
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:04,649
And that's what's going to be the name of this set.

61
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:07,819
So it's not on the workshop right now. I really want to state that.

62
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:11,819
This is not on the Steam Workshop right now. These are prototype items.

63
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,819
They are not final.

64
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:18,819
So I will give you guys the link so you can finally see the finished versions sometime at a later date.

65
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,819
But I had to show you. I couldn't hold it anymore.

66
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:24,829
So this is going to be the end of the video, guys.

67
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:27,829
Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

68
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:31,250
And I'll see you all soon. Take care, everybody.
