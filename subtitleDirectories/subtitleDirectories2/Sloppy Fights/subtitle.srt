1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:34,259
I'm getting my ass kicked. This guy's beating the shit out of me.

2
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:38,259
How you gonna learn if you keep getting hit in the head all the time?

3
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:58,299
Dude, this is what happens when you drink like a shitload of vodka and you get in a fight with somebody.

4
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:04,299
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. See this hand up here? You see this hand? Yeah, you just got clubbed.

5
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:09,299
You just got fucking clubbed by this shit-faced vodka salesman. You wanna fucking go?

6
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:19,590
You like this one? You like this technique? You like this technique? You like this one?

7
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,769
You know what I got for you? You like this? What do you got? You wanna go fucking with me?

8
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,769
What's that? Tell your mother. Tell your father. You ain't got nothing on me.

9
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:32,769
You motherfucker. I'll take you down. One more punch. Up a cut.

10
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:40,950
What the fuck? Go down. Will this guy seriously go down? Look at his health. This is bullshit. This is bullshit.

11
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,709
Look at this guy's health. Will you seriously go down?

12
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:55,930
I got one for you. I've got a punch for you right here.

13
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,930
You wanna go? I've got you.

14
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,340
Fuck you. I just took your ass out.

15
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,060
Keep your damn feet in place. You'll break the game if you keep running around.

16
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,060
Any other body part you wanna move is okay. But not your feet. Not unless I tell you. You got that?

17
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,490
It's all about the blocking. You gotta stay true.

18
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,729
Give him a couple of gut punches. Here we go. Looking good. Looking good.

19
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:41,250
I didn't do any damage to him right there. What the fuck was that? What the fuck was that?

20
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,879
No, really? What? Why did he just do the shimmy in front of me? Is that his taunt?

21
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:57,180
How am I supposed to beat this guy? This is the second round. I'm like trying to move.

22
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,349
I guess I can like duck around a little bit but it doesn't matter.

23
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,449
I gotta think of some like secret technique. I gotta do something about this.

24
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:15,639
Here we go. Give him the wrist punch. He can't handle it. He can't take it.

25
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:22,349
This guy's having a lot of trouble with my like pat on the back you did a good job at graduation son move.

26
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:27,719
He can't do it. He can't handle it. Yeah, he can. No, no. It actually might be working a little bit.

27
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,719
Then I gotta change this into something else. Here we go. We're gonna change this into a punch in the face.

28
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:42,189
Like that. Damn it, it didn't work. Get over here. I gotta rethink my strategy.

29
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:49,939
I gotta rethink my strategy. We're going double punches. I'm gonna go two haymakers in his face.

30
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,490
God damn it. Can I please just fucking hit this guy?

31
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,610
And if you crouch down, you get a good angle for hitting the body.

32
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:15,849
Hey, you want some free hits? Come on. Is that all you got? You piece of shit. Is that all you got? I'm the man.

33
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:23,240
Do you know who I am? Look at me flex. Yeah. That's working.

34
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:35,589
We're doing good. We just gotta keep this going. Just pretend like you're in a marching band.

35
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:40,790
Go forward and back. I'm not even gonna attempt to do anything else. I'm gonna just do this.

36
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:49,790
I'm just gonna like wash his face. What a terrible fight.

37
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Imagine if you were some of these guys that came here and paid for this fight and you saw this dumbass.

38
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,860
You'd be very disappointed. In fact, I would expect for this guy to get like beat up in the parking lot after this.

39
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:10,480
You maybe paid 20 bucks. I bet 20 bucks on you and you did like the dancing marching band move. You're a fucking idiot.

40
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,740
You know what? We gotta do some more. There we go. Right in the chin. Gotta get him right in his chin.

41
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:25,339
I gotta swing that up right in his chin. Quick ones. Quick ones. Quick ones.

42
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:30,899
Just fucking hammer his head. God damn it.

43
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:38,649
You don't fuck this. Now I'm fucking pissed off. You thought you were gonna fucking beat me in this fucking game?

44
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:45,649
Now you got me fucking angry. Because I've been trying to fight this same fucking guy for the last like 10 straight minutes

45
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:49,649
and I cannot beat him and I'm fucking gonna win no matter what.

46
00:05:50,649 --> 00:06:01,230
I'm gonna fucking die. No. Don't lose. I don't want to do this again. Use all your power. Use everything.

47
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,230
No.

48
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,540
If you mess up, get back in the guard post and press the circle button. Quick.

49
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:21,399
I'm gonna give him the ear punches. This is actually working. This is working.

50
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:31,300
This shit's gonna work. Come here. Just pretend like you're dragging a brick across his face. That's all you gotta do.

51
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:40,220
Just strangle him with the piano wire. Take him out Hitman style. I'll fucking strangle you.

52
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:51,699
What the fuck am I doing dude? What?
