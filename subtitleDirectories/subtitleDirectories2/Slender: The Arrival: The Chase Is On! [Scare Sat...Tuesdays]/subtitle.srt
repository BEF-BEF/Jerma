00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,250
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerba here with Scare Saturday. It's Tuesday. It's Tuesday. I'm sorry everybody.

2
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:22,250
I know you've been waiting for the last couple weeks since I went to PAX for a Scare Saturdays video, and I have not been able to deliver that.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:31,250
And I could give you a bunch of excuses, but I'm not going to do that right now. We're just going to transition into the actual video of me playing Slender the Arrival.

4
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:38,490
If you don't know what this game is, it's sort of a graphical reworking of the original Slender game, the indie game.

5
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:45,490
And this one is not free though. This one is actually 10 bucks for the digital download. Link will be in the description if you want to go play it.

6
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,490
It's pretty scary. It's pretty ridiculous, as you'll see in this video. So take care everybody. I'll see you all soon.

7
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,490
I think I say that at the end of the video, but it's okay. Here comes Scare Saturdays, Scare Tuesdays, whatever it's called. Here we go!

8
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:06,459
Dr. Pepper. Wait a minute. This is a sprite. This is not a Dr. Pepper. That means we're already in trouble. Oh my God.

9
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:12,810
That actually just scared the shit out of me. Okay, let's get started. Slender the Arrival.

10
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:25,569
There's like a little intro here too. I love how I'm just like skipping. Like, it's cool how it has a counter in the top right too.

11
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:35,980
Tells you how long you've been playing for. Little pretty woods. Alright, this is daytime. This is nothing, man.

12
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,980
If I see Slender, I'll kick him in the nuts right now. I got plenty of daylight.

13
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:50,689
I'm gonna follow the path because it's the only thing here. I'm gonna skip down the path.

14
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:56,989
Alright, I've just been like skipping down this road for a couple minutes, and we're getting darker and darker and darker.

15
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:09,099
Apparently in this universe, we go from day to night in like 15 seconds. It's like super sunset. What the hell is going on?

16
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:21,340
Kind of looks like my house. Not gonna lie. That's even creepier. You flip-flop the garage and you have my house.

17
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:38,379
Chairs. Pen. Paper. Open. Another table. Some type of pamphlet.

18
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:44,699
Honoring the life of Beth Hayes. Dad, your scrapbook can be viewed later. Okay.

19
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:54,300
Ooh, the flashlight. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, baby. Blinding light. You don't really need that right now.

20
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:05,259
It looks like a bed of some sort. A couple of vases, vases. Vases, vases. You can open the windows.

21
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:19,780
Let's get some air in here. I just fought it. Is this a room down here? Unlock the door. Can you see it?

22
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:31,800
Escape. So I have to make it to like the thing. This room is really freaky, by the way. It's all the notes.

23
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:44,379
Alright, so I have to escape. So there he is. There's Mr. Slender. There's like the Finn Man, whatever his name is.

24
00:03:44,379 --> 00:04:04,139
Alright, get me out of this room. To the woods. To the woods. We go. You don't have to scream, man. Go to the woods.

25
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:15,479
And now there's drawings all over the wall. Let's go. Tent down here.

26
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:21,740
Hopefully you're not sleeping because I'm gonna come like open your tent. Don't look or it takes you.

27
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:45,420
And it begins. And it begins. And it begins. Page one of eight. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

28
00:04:45,420 --> 00:05:06,050
Abandoned house, it looks like. Let's get in there. I hate being in these enclosed off areas, though, because this son of a bitch will disappear around a corner and snatch me up.

29
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:33,040
Anybody on the dumper? Come on. There's got to be a note in here somewhere. No, no. Where's the note? Where's the note?

30
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:43,850
Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? He's behind me right now. We'll come back to this. I can't turn around right now.

31
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:52,980
Wait a minute. Where is he? What's going on? Hello, sir. Hello, ma'am. Where is he?

32
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,750
Where the hell is he? I can't even. I don't know. I can't see anything. I don't know where he is.

33
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:10,339
Son of a bitch. You really screwed up my game here. Dickhead slender man.

34
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:16,339
There's another note right here. I only have one note right now, and he's legitimately right behind my ass.

35
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:20,339
Help me. Yep. Help me is the real one. You should be saying me.

36
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:34,660
Oh, my God. Don't turn around. Just don't turn around. If I turn around, I die.

37
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:46,860
Holy. He must be right up my ass. Whoa. No, he's right there.

38
00:06:46,860 --> 00:07:16,560
Oh, no. I don't even know what direction I'm going. I'm stuck in a tree.

39
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,339
No, go back. Keep going this way. Keep going this way. I do not want to run into that son of a bitch again.

40
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:30,730
Man, they made like the noises and like the screen shaking and stuff so much worse.

41
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:43,060
There is that him right there. I wish I could just see my face right there.

42
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:54,360
Oh, shit. Is there more than one? Is there more than one slender man?

43
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:02,829
What is that? A light is a light right here. He found something new, found something new.

44
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:07,199
This is a car. Is there a note? It's got to be a note.

45
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:23,199
Oh, he's huge. He's enormous in this game. He's like 15 feet tall. He's like a giant.

46
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:33,059
I'm stuck. I'm stuck right here, right here. This is that.

47
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:41,750
Oh, this is that stupid lighthouse that I'm shaking around in my chair.

48
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:54,509
Didn't even have a chance to look down here. There has to be a note. There it is.

49
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:03,080
Four pages, baby. Let's do it. Come on. Keep it up. Keep it up. Keep it up. Keep it up. Keep it up.

50
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:11,029
Head down this way. I probably missed a note on like a couple of the things I ran into already because I'm a little baby.

51
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:25,929
Nice waterfront. It's very pretty. Where? There's a note. There's a note. There's a note. Give it to me.

52
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:33,200
Five out of eight. Stuck. Stuck. I'm stuck. He's right next to me right now.

53
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:42,470
Help me. Help me.

54
00:09:50,600 --> 00:10:00,580
I needed to take that drink. My throat was so dry. I don't know where to go. My whole life is in a daze right now.

55
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,759
There has to be a note in this room. I don't know how I've missed it that many times.

56
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:20,379
That many times.

57
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:36,029
Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you liked Slender, Slender the Arrival is like a better version of Slender.

58
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:43,029
It's more ridiculous, better graphics. I don't even know. I probably, the campaign, I probably am like stuck on the campaign right here.

59
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:49,029
This might not even be the campaign. I don't know. But I'm scared. I'm dying right now and I need a drink.

60
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:55,320
Take care, everybody. That's all I can do.
