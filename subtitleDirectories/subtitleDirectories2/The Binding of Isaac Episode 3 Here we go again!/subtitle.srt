00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,699
Hey, what's going on everybody? Welcome to episode 3 of The Binding of Isaac, German Let's Play.

2
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:25,129
Not really a Let's Play in parentheses. So, I took a lot of you guys' advice, and I'm not using the mouse anymore, as you can probably tell.

3
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:30,129
I'm using the keys, and it is actually a little easier to move around, so thank you for that.

4
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:35,130
And I'm also not going to miss any secret rooms, or I'm going to try not to miss any secret rooms.

5
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,670
So, I died, as you just saw in the last episode. So, let's start it, huh?

6
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:50,100
Alright, that's fine. Coins, I can't get you. Maybe later. Bug bitches.

7
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,619
So yeah, a lot of you guys were like, oh my god, you're missing so many secrets. And I am sorry.

8
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:04,049
I did kind of just jump into this game without really thinking about it a whole lot. So I'll try to keep that to a minimum now.

9
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:14,269
Can't get those right now. Let's go up. Okay. Oh, there it is. See, there's the blue tinted rock.

10
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:19,269
A lot of you guys said, look for the blue tinted rock, so there's one right there. I'll remember this room.

11
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:27,590
Let's go to the right. I've never seen these enemies before. Like jumping jack freak shows.

12
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:37,519
Oh my, it is so much easier to aim with the arrow keys. Oh, and you also said to hit the chocolate syrup, because there could be items in there.

13
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:47,030
So I will. Item boss? Really? This is it? That's not very many rooms.

14
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:56,780
First item. Mr. Boom. Mr. Boom. So that's not a bomb. That's... it is.

15
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:04,450
Should I blow up the thing to get the thing? I don't know. I'm gonna do it. Whatever.

16
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:15,370
Small rock has appeared in the basement. Ooh, damage up. There you go. Oh, that's morbid.

17
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:21,490
Oh my god. There's a rock sticking out of my head. So that's awesome. That's awesome.

18
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,490
So when you blow up the tinted rocks, items can go up. I'm cool with that.

19
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,819
So that's it. There's nothing else. Wow. Okay. Isaac versus Monstro.

20
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:39,250
I've already beat this guy. I know what he does. Let's go. Yeah, go ahead. Come on. Come on. What you got?

21
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,490
You ain't got nothing, you friggin' goofy-toothed bastard. Keep puking.

22
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:52,460
Keep puking. All right. The damage up is... I can tell it's doing more damage. Oh god, I'm getting hit.

23
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,900
Wow. So definitely they'll spirit... Oh, I hit a spirit heart. That's cool.

24
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,419
What do you got, Mastro? Oh, it is. This is so much better.

25
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:10,389
Using the mouse was just so counterintuitive. I got you. Nothing.

26
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:15,759
I am gonna beat this stupid level. Not level, I mean this series of levels.

27
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:21,469
And you are dead. What do I get? What do I get? What do I get?

28
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:27,930
Underwear. Mom's underwear. Oh my god. I look ridiculous.

29
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,659
Oh, let's keep going. The basement. Level two.

30
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:41,090
Let me take a sip of my delicious soda pop.

31
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:47,219
All right, I'm ready to go. Up or down? All right, I'll go up. I heard you.

32
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:50,219
I heard you through the computer screen. You said to go up.

33
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:57,259
You guys, what do you got? Were these... Okay, somebody in the comments want to let me know.

34
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:02,259
These characters, these guys that look like the fluffy cauliflowers.

35
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:05,259
Were they in another game? Or in another series or something?

36
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:11,259
I feel like, cause Edward McMillan, or McMullin, is the guy that is the artistic brains behind all this.

37
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:15,740
And, oh my god. Should I go in?

38
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:21,430
I'm going to the item room. I have a key. I'm going in here. Hell yeah.

39
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,060
Bobby bomb. Homing bombs? What the hell does that mean?

40
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,060
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna knock this out of the park.

41
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,060
I can't even... I need a key. Damn it.

42
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,300
It's all right. But yeah, Edward McMullin is the guy responsible for this game.

43
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,540
So I figured a lot of these guys must be from a lot of his other works.

44
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,540
And I just opened up the floodgates right there. I don't know if that was a good idea.

45
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,040
I got it. Come on. Oh, the green one.

46
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Somebody told me the green ones are like worth more. Ooh.

47
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,250
They were. They totally were. Doing good so far. So far so good.

48
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,750
Oh, damn it. Die already.

49
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,379
Geez Louise with a piece of cheese. Nice.

50
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:12,379
Nothing in the chocolate syrup. I'm going to go open that chest.

51
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:16,939
I am absolutely going to go open that chest right now and probably get my ass kicked.

52
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:19,939
What is it? A bunch of... Oh, that was...

53
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:25,199
I don't know if I like that. I also read somebody said to not use the bombs

54
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,199
just to kill random enemies. You need them later or something somebody mentioned.

55
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
So I will heed by that advice and I will not do it.

56
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,660
Look at these crying babies. Oh, no. Did I really get hit by that?

57
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,660
Bilarki. Oh, man.

58
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,899
I'm going to cook you on an open fire, baby. And another chest.

59
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:53,790
And I don't need any of it. I'm going to go down.

60
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,209
I'm not going to go right. I'm going to go down.

61
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:02,470
I'm not sure if that was a great idea or not. Not sure.

62
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,470
But yeah, I swear to God, I've seen these guys from something else.

63
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,740
So in the comments, let me know what I'm talking about.

64
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,040
If I'm crazy, I'm crazy. If not, then I've seen them somewhere.

65
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,699
I think I'm going to go down. Oh, well, you get over here.

66
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,259
You rat bastard. Get over here.

67
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,079
Good to go. Getting stuck on these rocks.

68
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:32,930
These things remind me of fleas. Oh, a chest. Cool.

69
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,829
Coins, coins, coins.

70
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:40,779
See, okay, this is crazy.

71
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:47,019
The last level that I did was like less than like five rooms.

72
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:49,019
Ooh, pills. All right.

73
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,959
Somebody also said don't take the pills because it could be bad.

74
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,709
What? What? What is going on?

75
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,949
This is a boss? This is not a boss room.

76
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,949
What is going on here?

77
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:03,949
Oh, my God.

78
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:05,949
This game is just trolling me right now.

79
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:11,100
It is a troll. It's a troll face.

80
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,259
I'm going to die. Oh, boy.

81
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,069
So what? This is like a mini boss room?

82
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:21,069
Get the hell out of here. No.

83
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:24,069
Damn it. I'm going to die. No, God.

84
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:29,089
Geez. Oh, Q the fool.

85
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:32,220
Which one of these should I take?

86
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,410
I need heart. I have no idea what this does.

87
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,709
Somebody's probably screaming at the video right now.

88
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,709
Pick the pills back up.

89
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,269
I'm not going to. I'm keeping this thing.

90
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:48,699
I need life. Oh, if I die right now, I'm going to I'm going to throw up blood.

91
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:50,699
Blood is going to puke out of my mouth.

92
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,699
I'm going to hit Q. I'm doing it.

93
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,209
What? What just happened?
