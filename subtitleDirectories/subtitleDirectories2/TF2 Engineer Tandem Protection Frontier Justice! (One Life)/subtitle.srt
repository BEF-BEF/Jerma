00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,440
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerba here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm going to be playing as the Engineer.

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,440
And this is going to be a big Sentry Engineer, no mini-Sentry. I want to show you guys a couple of things.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,440
Well actually, show you one thing, because I kind of stand in the same spot the entire gameplay.

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,439
But that is beside the point, because obviously when you are playing as a big Sentry Engineer, you got to stand in the same spot.

5
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,439
And if you don't, your stuff is going to get destroyed.

6
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,740
Also playing on the map Upward on Defense, which is a very good Engineer map.

7
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,740
It's a very big map, but it's great for Engineer, because there's so many different spots you can put a Sentry gun here.

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:53,740
As you'll see, there are like three or four Engineers on this team, which is why near the end of the gameplay...

9
00:00:53,740 --> 00:01:00,979
By the way, the end of the gameplay, I kill almost the entire team without my Sentry.

10
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:08,420
So I won't tell you what happens, but it's very, very cool. The last two minutes of this gameplay are very, very cool.

11
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,420
So keep that in mind while you're watching the slug gameplay, I guess.

12
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,420
Well, it's not a slug gameplay. No one's going to chant slug at this.

13
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,420
It is kind of slow near the beginning, but I wanted to tell you guys why my Sentry gun is here.

14
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,420
And instead of using the last two minutes in a clip...

15
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,420
No, but this is all a one-life gameplay, by the way. I forgot to mention that.

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,719
This is all a one-life gameplay, so I figured it's been a little while since my last one-life gameplay.

17
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,719
So I have the whole thing here for you to enjoy.

18
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,900
And my Sentry, now I'm getting off track here, my Sentry gun.

19
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,140
The reason why it's right here is because there was already a Sentry up on the top little nest area.

20
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:54,310
Right here, the last point on upward, it's very, very obvious to put your Sentry gun up in that little loft back behind me, sort of, to the left.

21
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,310
That is the best place for a Sentry gun here.

22
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,310
But if it's already taken, you see, here's the bad part about that spot.

23
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,310
If that spot is already taken, it is very vulnerable to people at these windows.

24
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,620
See these two windows up straight ahead here in the top area? Right up to my top right.

25
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:17,620
If a Soldier gets in that window, he will just harass the crap out of anybody that has a Sentry in that loft.

26
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,620
Now, if you have a Sentry right here, that prevents that from happening.

27
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,620
Because if they pick their nose up, if they pick their nose and eat it...

28
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,919
What? If they pick their...

29
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:31,919
If they poke their nose out here, they're gonna get shot by my Sentry instantly.

30
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:40,159
And vice versa, if somebody comes around this corner here, whether that be a Demoman or a Heavy, they will take this Sentry out in one second.

31
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,159
My Sentry, where it is right now, will not stand a chance.

32
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:47,159
Unless, of course, it is being protected by another Sentry.

33
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,159
See, here's the thing about Team Fort, look straight ahead.

34
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:55,159
If you see this guy that has the Sentry Gun right here, he is gonna take all the brunt of the guys coming around the corner,

35
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,159
and I'm gonna take care of the guys that come through the top windows.

36
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:04,460
And the guy up top, I'm actually not sure if he's there anymore, he is totally protected to do whatever he wants.

37
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:10,460
He is kind of the anchor of the team right now, because if my Sentry goes down, or if this guy's Sentry goes down,

38
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,460
we have another line of defense, and it's a great Sentry placement.

39
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:19,770
So that's the thing I'm trying to talk about right now, is tandem Sentry Gun protection.

40
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,120
If you have two or three Sentry Guns on one team, and they're all facing...

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,120
because in Team Fortress, what I was gonna say before, before I cut myself off right there,

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,419
in Team Fortress, there are probably three or four ways to come at an enemy team.

43
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:42,419
Whether it's a left tunnel or a right walkway or straight on, if you can block all three or four of those places with Sentry Guns,

44
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,659
it's gonna be very difficult for the enemy team to do anything, because even if they come through with an Uber,

45
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:53,659
let's say an Uber Demoman comes over and takes out one of the Sentry nests that's over on Dustball,

46
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:55,659
right on the right side, he destroys the Sentry.

47
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:58,659
They walk 20 more feet, and there's another Sentry.

48
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:01,659
And then after that, there's gonna be another Sentry up top somewhere,

49
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,659
so you can see where it can get really, really difficult.

50
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,969
And Engineers, while I play out this last minute of the gameplay here,

51
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,969
this is where I kill almost the entire team with Revenge Crits.

52
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:13,969
I didn't want to ruin it in the beginning, but it's very, very interesting.

53
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:18,970
So what I was gonna say before this video ends is, Engineer, this is the reason why I love Engineer.

54
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,209
This is the reason why it is my favorite class.

55
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:27,209
Yes, it is my favorite class. If you're new to the channel, this is my favorite class, Engineer.

56
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:32,379
And I want to say, if the Medic is the quarterback, then the Engineer is the linebacker,

57
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:39,379
or the offensive lineman, or one of those big, bulky, surly guys that protects everybody else.

58
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,379
And that's why I like this class so, so much.

59
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:46,379
You feel like you are the protector. You are the defender.

60
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:50,379
And you really are. And it makes you feel good when you have a point really, really secure.

61
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:54,379
And you got your dispenser up and you're healing people, replenishing people.

62
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:58,379
I just like classes like that. When I played World of Warcraft, I played a priest.

63
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:03,379
I played the support healers and stuff. So that is why I love the Engineer.

64
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:08,379
I also love the Medic too, but I'd say the Engineer definitely trumps the Medic in my favorite class.

65
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:13,560
But yeah, this video is already over. I'm like talking on black screen right now.

66
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,560
So thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

67
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,149
And I will catch you guys all next time. So take care, everybody.
