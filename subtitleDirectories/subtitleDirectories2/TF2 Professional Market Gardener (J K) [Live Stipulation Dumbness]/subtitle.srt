00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:17,809
Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here with a market garden rocket jumper gameplay. Now this is going to have some fantastic jumps and fantastic kills.

2
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:22,960
No, no guys, no.

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,140
Ooh, you ready to see me do some sick market garden skills?

4
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,440
Dude, I'm ready to see you go across the map in the sky and duck down with a shovel.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,340
This is it. That didn't work.

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,740
I landed on his head. What? You get penned.

7
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,520
How the fuck do you do this?

8
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,950
Some timing. Are you kidding me?

9
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:58,979
Oh my God. I would have had that guy. That guy in the sky. You nearly met him.

10
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,659
Oh, are you going?

11
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,659
Nobody can hit me. Oh shit.

12
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,379
I actually did get someone.

13
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:19,200
All right. So one time I saw Star jump from the very beginning of this point all the way to like the other end of spawn.

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,200
So I'm going to try to do it right now. You guys ready? Here we go.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,200
You ready, boo? First attempt. Yeah, I'm ready.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,200
I'm waiting at the other end for you. I got it.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:38,340
I'm going. I got this. I'm doing all right. I'm doing good. I've got it. I'm almost there.

18
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,390
Let's aim for 13. Oh, does that count? Does that count as a market garden kill?

19
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,530
Does it count if I didn't jump in the air? Check this out motherfucker.

20
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,469
Here we go, baby. Star underscore niche.

21
00:01:53,469 --> 00:02:04,950
It's me. You're sick, dude. Boo, help. I'm stuck.

22
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,950
Well, you can get up there. That's not a spy. I just didn't bump into him.

23
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,949
We're going to go all the way around. We're going to try to get shot in the back.

24
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:16,319
There's a scout with a pen. No, I'm scared.

25
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,590
No, Jimmy. I'm all by myself.

26
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,539
What am I doing? I was trying to like rocket jump across the ledge and I like missed the lip.

27
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:35,710
If there's one thing that does be an uber, it's definitely enhanced gravity at a bottomless pit.

28
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:42,419
They can definitely kill an uber. Come on, push it down that little cliff.

29
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,430
Push it down. Come on, use all your strength and get it down.

30
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:55,110
Here we go. Here we go. Spy.

31
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,050
It's not working in here.

32
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,050
I can't. Joan, stay right there. Don't move.

33
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:15,780
Dude, this guy has no idea and I can't even like...

34
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,139
Here we go.

35
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:24,139
What? Would you? Would you? Huh?

36
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:28,969
What? What happened to me?

37
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:35,090
Oh, fall damage. Oh.

38
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:41,830
Oh, oh, oh.

39
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,830
I didn't even... I forgot to shoot the rocket.

40
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,780
I'll distract him.

41
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,780
What the hell is this guy doing?

42
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,780
Don't kill him. Don't kill him. No.

43
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,090
I wanted to crit him for a tickle.

44
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,090
I wanted to crit him and he would be like a still target.

45
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,520
Like standing still for me.

46
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,139
I just did like a full moonsault.

47
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:09,539
Have you ever seen... you know like WWF, the moonsault?

48
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,539
Oh, you mean like a full on like Jeff Hardy.

49
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,990
Yeah, I just Jeff Hardy moonsaulted off the top turnbuckle onto somebody.

50
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:22,449
I want to get this guy to peek his head over and me to get him.

51
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:25,709
I keep forgetting to shoot the rocket.

52
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,779
This guy doesn't know. This guy doesn't know. Let's see if I can do it.

53
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:35,029
What the fuck, man?

54
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:39,779
If I landed, if I registered a hit, I would have killed that engineer.

55
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,430
But I'm just awful.

56
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,430
Oh, I think I got him.

57
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,800
Yeah, you did. There's still a teleporter though.

58
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Okay. No, I died.

59
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,100
There we go. It's done.

60
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,100
I got it.

61
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,100
I thought it was like a lot of action in there.

62
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
You're just like in there with like a shovel.

63
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,379
Come on, get back over here.

64
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:02,379
Oh, Gemma, you're in a tight spot.

65
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:03,680
I know, I'm out.

66
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,750
Jump away.

67
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,540
It could happen here though.

68
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:19,689
I'm going to try to go back to the spawn area.

69
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,689
Oh, yes.

70
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,250
Yeah, attaboy.

71
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,220
Oh, let's do it again.

72
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,220
I did it. Three.

73
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,220
Three rocket jumping, rocket garden kills.

74
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,220
Thank you. Thank you so much.

75
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,220
It only took me like an hour and 15 minutes.

76
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,220
It's the magic of editing.

77
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,220
It's only been like five minutes, whatever it's been, you know?

78
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,800
Sup, Spy?

79
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
You're not going to get away with this one.

80
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,980
And it didn't register.

81
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,050
And it didn't register.

82
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,050
I'm being such a piece of dog crap right now.

83
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,050
Like I cannot kill this Spy.

84
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,860
And he's like killing people on our team too.

85
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,410
Heavy?

86
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,540
Dude, I'm bumping into Spies everywhere.

87
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,600
Heavy?

88
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
These guys are snipers all over the map.

89
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
How am I nervous?

90
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,610
That guy was so confused.
