00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,009
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,

2
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:22,269
and tonight, playing as the Demoman on Thunder Mountain. I can't do the noise with my mouth,

3
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:26,350
but you understand, on Thunder Mountain right now is the Demoman with a very, very, very

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,949
weird setup. Before I get really into this commentary at all, I want to talk about the

5
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:37,469
So I'm using the Alibaba's Wii booties, the Sticky Launcher, and the Frying Pan. Now,

6
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,109
the reason why I did this, I'm kind of sick of doing the whole regular Demoman setup,

7
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:48,869
because the Demoman doesn't have really any options. He only has two real primaries and

8
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:54,890
two real secondaries. I mean, I don't really even count the shields. I mean, they are weapons,

9
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,030
but they're not technically weapons. They just add a mechanic. They add a charge mechanic

10
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,420
into the game. So what I'm talking about, I'm talking about real weapons. I really do wish

11
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,719
Valve would stop making all these melee unlockables for the Demoman and actually focus on some

12
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,700
new primaries and some new secondaries, because we need them, because there's nothing else

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,420
you can really do. And personally, I really don't like the Scottish Resistance. I think

14
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,980
the Scottish Resistance is too weird to use. I can't really get used to it. So somebody

15
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,939
like me that doesn't ever use the Scottish Resistance, I just have the default Sticky

16
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,159
Launcher and I have a shield I can put on. So what I'm doing right now is I'm doing

17
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,120
a weird kind of different setup that not very many people do, and it's the Alibaba's Wii

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,920
booties, like I said, and the Sticky Launcher, specifically to get the extra health. So I'm

19
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,810
really just a sticky bomb tank. It's really what I am. Because I've been looking back

20
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,810
at my Demoman videos and even playing as the Demoman, whenever I play as the damn Demoman,

21
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,420
I always just use the default stuff. And unless I'm doing a demo night, and I've got to get

22
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,290
away from that, this is kind of my way to change it up a little bit and stop using the

23
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,610
same damn items over and over and over again. And this is a very odd setup. And it is, even

24
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,580
though it is odd, it is a lot of fun and it's actually pretty useful. It's pretty much

25
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,610
just putting on the Darwin's Danger Shield for the Sniper. And yes, you do lose your

26
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:28,289
grenade launcher, but honestly, for the most part, most of us use the grenade launcher

27
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:32,009
for spam anyways. And a lot of, some of us are okay though. Some of us can get those

28
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:36,770
great Demoman direct shots. And for that, you guys, I commend you. I give you a clap.

29
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,449
I give you applause. Because sometimes it's difficult for me to do that, unless I'm using

30
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:45,650
the lock and load. But it takes the spam factor away from you and makes you really have to

31
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:51,639
focus with your sticky launchers and you get extra health. So until Valve adds some new

32
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,599
primaries and secondaries, some new innovative primaries and secondaries for the Demoman,

33
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,340
I'll probably be rolling around with this for a little while. So for the next half of

34
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,719
the commentary, I want to talk about, I want to get away from the game and the gameplay

35
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:11,240
for a little bit. And I want to discuss exercise, exercising and the gym. Because I remember

36
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,039
in my last, my Q&A video, I told you guys that I was getting a little sloppy. I hadn't

37
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:20,080
been to the gym in a long time. It's been like three months and I finally just went

38
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,479
back yesterday. I went with burger boy and we got destroyed. We did a chest and triceps

39
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,680
workout and I felt like I hadn't worked out ever before in my entire life. Like I was

40
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,360
so tired and my muscles are so sore right now. But forget about all that. I want to

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,939
talk about, I want to talk to you guys specifically about my workout routine and my workout story.

42
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:48,020
And maybe after listening to this commentary, if you were on the fence before, maybe you'll

43
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,219
start doing it too. Cause I mean, I do get asked this quite often, at least in PMs.

44
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:56,659
I mean, not, it's not like every single day somebody's like, how do you do workouts? But

45
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,180
I have been asked a couple of times. So I do want to get this video out so people can

46
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:08,680
understand that here's my story. I was a little, little dude back when I was in high school.

47
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:17,290
I probably was 115 pounds. I was like five, two, and I was 115 pounds. And after I got

48
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,250
out of high school, I went to college. I gained a little bit of weight in college. I went

49
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:28,250
to probably 135 or like 138 in college. And after college, that's kind of when I said

50
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:34,970
okay, I am getting really sick and tired of being the smallest person in the room. I would

51
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,850
look around and see everybody was bigger than me. Everyone was stronger than me. And I got

52
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,740
sick of that. And even in talking about women and relationship stuff, I wanted to be more

53
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:50,220
desirable. I wanted to be a guy that girls would point to and say, wow, he's look at

54
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,819
that. Look at those arms. And plus I wanted to get healthier too, because I have always

55
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:59,759
been kind of like a health nut. I've always wanted to be the healthiest I can be. And

56
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,160
I mean, it's not like I didn't try this before. I never really worked out that much, but I

57
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,269
did try to put on weight and oh my God, I could not put on one pound to save my life.

58
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:17,300
I could eat 25 double cheeseburgers from McDonald's and I wouldn't gain one pound.

59
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,779
And I was always so naive. I really did think that eating garbage fatty foods was going

60
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:28,300
to make me bigger and make me gain weight. But that's not really what that stuff does.

61
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,180
You'll gain weight if you eat cheeseburgers or if you eat something really bad for you.

62
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,459
You'll gain weight, but it's not the type of weight that you want to gain. Yeah, I mean,

63
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:41,819
maybe you'll gain four or five pounds, but it'll all be in your butt cheeks. Like you

64
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,980
won't get like biceps by eating McDonald's. I'll tell you that right now. And to sort

65
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,699
of end this video, I want to talk about what it's really done for me and what it can really

66
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:56,220
do for you too. If you start working out, if you really get into it, I've seen such

67
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,550
massive results guys. I've gained probably at least 40 or 50 pounds since I started a

68
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,189
couple of years ago. And even though I have slowed down a little bit, I'm trying to get

69
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:11,589
back into it now. But I've just seen such amazing results over the last couple of years.

70
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:16,910
I got as strong as an ox too. And I'm not the smallest guy in the room anymore. I'm

71
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,189
one of the bigger guys in the room. And that alone is so insane for your confidence. If

72
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:27,889
you can get to a point where you look in the mirror and you go, who's that guy? Oh my God,

73
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:32,370
you will feel so much better about yourself. And it's done so many good things for me.

74
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,810
So maybe in the future, I'll make another video like this describing my actual routine

75
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,009
and some of the things I do on a daily basis to stay healthy and to gain weight and to

76
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,889
get bigger. But for now, I just wanted to give you that little story. So I will see

77
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,730
you guys all soon. Take care, everybody.
