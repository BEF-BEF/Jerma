Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerema here with a Shoot Mania Storm gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:19,449
If you don't know what Shoot Mania Storm is, this is going to be sort of an introduction to this game.

3
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:24,129
I'm not going to break this game down to a science, really.

4
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:30,129
I'm just gonna tell you why it's fun, why I'm having fun with it, why you should potentially check it out, and that sort of thing.

5
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:38,869
There's a lot to this game, even though it has sort of a disguise of being a very, very simple game, which it is.

6
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:47,869
This game is one of the easiest games I've probably played in the last couple years, where you just get in, you pick up, you play it, and you know pretty much exactly what's going on.

7
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:57,869
We'll dive into that, and we'll talk about some other things, but first, I want to apologize if you guys can hear any loud noises in the background during the course of this commentary,

8
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:03,869
because I'm having tree work done in the right side of my yard, and literally it's happening like right there.

9
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:11,370
So if you hear like a chainsaw, it's not like Jason coming to get me. It's just like we're having tree work done, and I apologize.

10
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:17,489
So what is Shoot Mania Storm? Well, first of all, it is a first-person shooter, as you can probably tell.

11
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:24,989
No view models, though. This game does not have any view models, which is kind of a jarring thing when you first get into it.

12
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:33,170
I don't know about you guys, but when I play a game, a first-person shooter, having the view model there adds to the realism for me,

13
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,170
able to see the gun animations moving, the traction of the bullets coming out.

14
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:44,170
I like to have view models, but they are not really required for me to have a good time playing a game.

15
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:51,730
And I mentioned that this game is incredibly easy to pick up and play, and that's because there's only three weapons in this entire game.

16
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:59,730
The one you're going to be using the most is sort of this flare gun plasma cannon thing that has four shots and recharges over time.

17
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,730
That's your main weapon you're going to be using. So everybody's on the same playing field.

18
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,730
Not one person has, oh my god, what gun does he have? What weapon does he have?

19
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,729
Does he have like the super strong one that's quick and does more damage, or does he have this like unlockable?

20
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:18,729
It's none of that. It's just very, very simple, very basic. I shoot you, or you shoot me.

21
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:24,159
And this very simplistic design philosophy works really, really well.

22
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:31,590
And it has this Tron-type futuristic laser tag experience, not like any other game I've ever played.

23
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:39,590
And probably the coolest thing about Shoot Mania is not the different game types, it's not the gameplay, although those things are very cool in itself.

24
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,590
It's the map-making tools. What Nadeo, I think it's Nadeo how it's pronounced, the guys that developed this game,

25
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:51,590
they're the ones that made Track Mania, and they really want to focus on community involvement in this game.

26
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,590
So all the map-making, all the mod-making tools are built into the engine.

27
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,590
So you can play around and make your own maps and your own mods and stuff very, very easily,

28
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,590
which is a huge two thumbs up to the guys at Nadeo and Ubisoft that are responsible for this game.

29
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:14,150
One more interesting thing to note about Shoot Mania Storm is the fact that they're trying really, really hard to make this an e-sport.

30
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:20,150
It's built from the ground up to utilize e-sports, to utilize casting, to have a great spectator mode.

31
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,150
They really want this game to go places in the FPS e-sport community.

32
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,150
And I think it has all the right formula there. I think it's ready to do that,

33
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,150
but it just needs the right amount of people playing and the right support from the community.

34
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,650
Is that going to happen? I don't know.

35
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,650
I don't know if the community is going to take this game in and really want to see it flourish,

36
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,650
or if it's just going to be kind of the flavor of the month for a while.

37
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,650
But hopefully not, because like I've said previously, this game is very fun.

38
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,650
It's an awesome game just to jump in and play with your friends.

39
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,650
Try to cap some flags, try to do the various game modes.

40
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,650
There's the real competitive one.

41
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,650
I'm sure a lot of you guys saw me play the competitive mode.

42
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,650
It's called Elite. At E3, me, Star, and MLC Stealth,

43
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,650
we essentially got in second place to go to E3 and play this game when it was back in Alpha.

44
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:13,020
And that will go down in history for me as one of the coolest experiences of my entire life.

45
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,020
And that was all thanks to the guys at Nadeo in Ubisoft.

46
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,019
So they get two thumbs up from me. This game is really fun.

47
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:22,019
If you have the extra cash lying around, it's $20 on the Steam store,

48
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,019
and I highly recommend you check it out.

49
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:26,379
And if you guys want to see more Shoot Mania content,

50
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,379
whether it be live commentaries of me and friends,

51
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,379
or just another post-com talking about how I'm playing a certain thing,

52
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:36,379
then please let me know, because I am not against making this a series to play this game.

53
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,379
It just really depends on how you guys judge this content.

54
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,379
Let me know in a comment or a like or whatever you guys want to let me know,

55
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,379
and I'll see you guys all next time.

56
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:46,379
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

57
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:48,379
Shoot Mania Storm, guys. Go check it out.

58
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:50,379
Take care, everybody.
