00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:12,679
Hey what is happening guys, Jerma here with a gameplay commentary. This is a

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,839
one-life gameplay with one class. Not with two classes, this is the same class.

3
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:25,539
Two gameplays, one class, one life. In both lives. If that makes absolutely no

4
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:29,059
sense to you, you'll get it in a second. First headshot is on that heavy, this is

5
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:33,420
the Huntsman sniper on Hightower. The first one is gonna be on Hightower. The

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,780
second one is going to be on Gold Rush, it is, with the default sniper rifle. So

7
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,380
two different ends of the spectrum. Huntsman sniper and default sniper, so you

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,219
get to see both ends of the world. You get to see China and you get to see...

9
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,179
what's on the other end of China? America, right? America! You get to see China and

10
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:57,460
America. What a terrible analogy that was. Anyways, payload race Hightower is the

11
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,420
map we're playing on right now. And real quickly, I want to give you guys a tip on

12
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,340
how to deal with a Huntsman. Never get that close. See how he got right up in my

13
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,579
face? When you do that, you are increasing your head's hitbox by a

14
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:14,859
astronomical amount. You never want to get that close to a Huntsman. How to deal

15
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:19,099
with a Huntsman? Stay as far away from them as you can, because you will get

16
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:23,780
luckily headshot in your face. If you get within five to ten feet of a Huntsman,

17
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,260
you're pretty much dead. Sneaking around those boxes, luckily get the headshot on

18
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,579
that heavy. Good thing, because these dispensers would have gone down, and the

19
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:34,739
engineers, and they would have had to build it all over again, and that just

20
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:40,060
sucks. So I'm glad I could protect those engineers. Long-range headshot on that

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,620
soldier right there. I love when that happens. There's one thing in this game

22
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,219
that I think is the most satisfying thing. It's either an engineer crit from

23
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,579
the Frontier Justice, or a long-range across the entire map headshot from the

24
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:55,260
Huntsman. Hands down, I can't think of anything else that's more awesome than

25
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,200
that. Trying to time when that scout was going to come out of the door. I didn't

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,359
time it right, but it's okay. I ended up getting away. He's coming after me guys,

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,159
and here we go again. The same thing I said before. Watch what happens here. I'm

28
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,280
gonna die, right? I get in this little corridor, and look at how close he gets.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,639
Now he's dead, and I am completely fine. That could have been the end of my life.

30
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:20,939
Can't stress it enough. Never get close to a Huntsman. Pick off that Pyro right

31
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:27,219
there. A soldier coming around the corner. I miss. He misses. I miss. He misses. This

32
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:31,060
is where it gets a little funny. He gets too close. Get him right in his face, and

33
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,150
now it's time for round three with that scout. Dun dun dun dun. Here he is. Jumps

34
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,270
over the arrow. Misses me with the ball, and I wonder, you can probably guess on

35
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,830
who wins this round. Probably he was getting a little sick of getting shot in

36
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,909
the face from two feet away. I think he learned his lesson. Good job scout. You did a

37
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:52,349
fine job. Now before we get on to the next gameplay, I want to show you this. I

38
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:56,789
was pooping my pants because of this by the way. Think I'm gonna headshot him? No. I

39
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:10,409
go for the taunt kill. I get it. I can't believe it. I'm so sad. Oh well, get over it. Time to get

40
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,889
on to the next gameplay. This is the default sniper rifle now, and the Darwin's

41
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:20,289
Danger Shield, and the Tribalman Shiv. I do very, very well here. Very, very well.

42
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,250
Unfortunately, something else ridiculous happens at the end of this gameplay. Not

43
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,009
gonna spoil it, but I wanted to, again, poo my pants and then shoot myself in the

44
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:33,090
face because of what happens. So I saw that spy coming around the corner there.

45
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,569
I didn't end up going after him. I really wanted to get the headshot on that pyro,

46
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:41,610
and now me and this huntsman sniper going toe-to-toe. We can't seem to kill

47
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,000
either of each other. It's really, really funny, and that's it. Dude, what are you

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,479
doing spy? Why did you do that? So me and that sniper just say, forget it. I'm not

49
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,360
gonna deal with you. You're not gonna deal with me, and we go our separate ways.

50
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,240
Headshot on the engineer, and his sentry goes down. Looking good. Sitting pretty.

51
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,560
Headshot on that medic, and a headshot on the heavy, but it doesn't kill him. Turn

52
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,039
around running away. Don't get yourself killed in these situations. Try to get

53
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,039
the upper hand. Try to get the advantage. He sees me again. I turn around. I get the

54
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,780
headshot just in time to protect that other sniper. Now I start doing a whole

55
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,420
lot of missing in a row. Miss that soldier with the headshot. Miss that

56
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,699
engineer with the headshot. Miss his sentry. Doesn't matter. It got destroyed.

57
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,779
Anyways, this pyro's doing the smart thing, which is if you didn't know, he

58
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:30,660
stood up. That was the mistake he made. If you don't know, ducking behind the

59
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,740
cart is a very, very good way to protect your head of getting headshot, as long as

60
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,600
you are right behind it. Specifically the part with the huge bubble, because I can

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,800
still get you sometimes if you're right behind the cart, right to the side. But

62
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,600
he had the right idea. That sniper was coming after me, I could tell, because he

63
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,040
was scoped in, looking straight ahead. Get the headshot on him. Get the headshot on

64
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,600
that pyro. Bang, bang, bang. We're doing pretty well here. Looking out for that

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,680
demo spam. Trying to find a situation where I can shoot somebody in their skull

66
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,300
cap. A spy tries to backstab me right here. I just barely get out of the way.

67
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,939
Now I look in the obvious spy places and that's where he was. Get the kill on him.

68
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,459
Coming over here just to resupply my health and my ammo. This is something you

69
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:17,779
never want to let slip your mind, guys, because as a sniper I have 150 health.

70
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:22,899
Usually you have 125 if you're using the, not using the Darwin's Danger Shield. And

71
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,300
the big problem is a lot of people forget about going to resupply their health and

72
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,259
you can get killed by a sniper that's counter sniping you in potentially one

73
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,300
body shot. So you always want to make sure that you have full health, or at

74
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,980
least very close to full health, anytime you are sniping. Otherwise, like I said,

75
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,459
you could potentially just get one shot by some dude that just goes counter

76
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:48,300
sniper and just murders you. Not having very much luck with the front end of the

77
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,139
gate here, so I turn around and go to the right side. Ends up being a good idea

78
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,459
because I end up getting three or four headshots in a row. There's one. Here

79
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,339
comes two on this heavy. Doesn't kill him, but it's okay. Watch what he does.

80
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:04,019
He's like, no! He jumps in the air trying to avoid me. I get it. Soldier coming

81
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:07,300
around here. I get the headshot on him as well, which makes it three headshot

82
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,019
kills in a row. Just briefly now I want to talk about one thing really quickly

83
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:15,100
before the end of the gameplay. Coming up to a close here in the next minute or

84
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,139
so, I just want to let you guys know how to play with sniper. If you guys go back

85
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,660
a couple of months, go back to my Uber update video. If you watch my Uber update

86
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:29,819
video, you will see I was an atrocious sniper. I said in that gameplay, I'm a

87
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,459
terrible sniper. I'll never be good at sniper. I'm awful. And I kind of swore

88
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:38,699
off the class for a while. Just recently, the last maybe month or so, I started to

89
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,220
really practice sniper and get much better at it. And that's really what it

90
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,379
takes, guys. It's all about the muscle memory. It's all about keeping your arm

91
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,980
and wrist in check and not flying all over the place just relaxing. Go to a

92
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,740
couple of orange maps or go to a sniper specific map. You will get better. You

93
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,660
just have to practice. It takes a little bit of time, takes some effort. That's

94
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,180
all I have to say about that. The gameplay is coming to a close here in the

95
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,220
next 30 seconds, but the most important part of this gameplay is coming up right

96
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,220
now in the next 15 seconds. Get ready for this so you see the spy right here,

97
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,699
right? Okay, I'm aware of him. I know he's there. So I come back around here

98
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,779
going up to the top of this corridor up here, and I figure if he's going to come

99
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:24,699
up there, I'll see him and I'll probably bump into him. There he is.

100
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:37,910
Oh my God. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. I

101
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,870
will see you all next time. Take care.
