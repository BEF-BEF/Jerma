00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,630
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a new Little Gem.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,870
This week's Little Gem is going to be one of my absolute favorite Flash games of all time.

3
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:25,300
The name of the game is Tentacle Wars. It is sort of a hybrid between a strategy puzzle type game.

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,300
I guess you could say that. It fits in the same category if you guys have ever played the game Risk.

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:35,299
It's got that hostile takeover vibe to it, where the point of the game is you have to take over the entire board.

6
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:39,299
Well, not really the whole board, but we will get into the basics of the game right now.

7
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,609
Also, really, really quickly, I'm going to leave a couple of links in the description.

8
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:49,609
Not only to the iTunes store where you can download the game, but also to the original Flash versions.

9
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:55,609
Because essentially, this iPad and iPhone Tentacle Wars is a reworking of the first two games.

10
00:00:55,609 --> 00:01:01,420
Tentacle Wars 1 and Tentacle Wars The Purple Menace. So they will be there in the description.

11
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,420
So the basic premise of Tentacle Wars is to try and infect and overtake the other enemy pods.

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,420
You do this by shooting out your limbs, I guess you could call them,

13
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,420
which, when they're attached, will start slowly draining the enemy's health.

14
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,420
It's a war of attrition, and the strategy really lies in knowing when and where to attack.

15
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,420
And the enemies can fight back, too. It's not just you don't just destroy people by attacking them.

16
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,420
It results in a tug of war, and whoever can last the longest and keep their point count higher is going to win the fight.

17
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,109
You can also cut off your tentacles, and it causes this immediate burst damage, and it's incredibly effective.

18
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,109
And it's a great strategy, especially knowing if the enemy's almost out of health,

19
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:46,109
and you slice that cord, and it just sucks all into their pod, effectively destroying them.

20
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:50,109
So that's a big part of the game. That's something that you should be doing more often than not.

21
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:55,799
So let's talk about the numbers that are on the pods. It might be a little bit confusing,

22
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,799
and I don't blame you if you are confused by this game, because it is quite weird.

23
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:05,799
It's unlike anything I've ever played before. But once you get it, and you understand the mechanics and the mathematics of it all,

24
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,800
it is incredibly addicting. But before I go off on a tangent about how awesome the game is,

25
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,800
let's talk about, like I said, the numbers and the health.

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,419
So all these pods are going to regenerate if they're untouched, or if they're being reinforced by a friendly pod.

27
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:23,419
You can put your tentacle on a friendly target. It does not have to be an enemy.

28
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:28,419
This is an integral, insanely important part of this game, because keeping your cells fed

29
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:35,419
by creating these chains to increase the regeneration, you're essentially sacrificing the health of one pod

30
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:42,419
to feed another, if that makes any sense. And remember, all tentacles can be cut to make this process faster.

31
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:48,419
So it's all about this overtime healing and knowing when to put your tentacle on an enemy and make a chain,

32
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,419
and it's just so strategic, and especially because there are neutral pods in the game.

33
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:57,419
You're not just going to be always fighting the red team, or the blue team, or the purple team.

34
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:03,419
There are empty gray pods that when you infect them, they don't do any bite back. They don't fight you back.

35
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:08,419
You just have to infect them. You get a large amount of cells in the pod.

36
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:14,419
So knowing when to go after the neutral ones or how to reinforce them, I've had so much fun with this game, guys.

37
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:19,419
I have three-starred almost all the levels. I think there's only one or two that I have not.

38
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:26,659
But the point still remains here that this is my favorite Flash game ever of all time, and I'm so glad to see it on the iPad.

39
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:34,659
The only issue I have with the iPad port is that it's a little bit on the expensive side for the content that you get,

40
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,659
seeing as how you can play this game completely for free online.

41
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:45,900
The game is $2.99 for the HD version and $0.99 for the regular, just standard version.

42
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,900
Also, really, really important, you cannot play the HD version if you have an iPhone currently.

43
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:59,400
So hopefully the developers will work on that and get us an HD version for iPhone, but you can still get the standard DEF.

44
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,400
With all that said, you're going to get 40 levels of content, and the developers have promised that they were going to give more level packs

45
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,400
and included support for more devices and all that great stuff. So hopefully we get to see that.

46
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,399
So I am going to highly recommend you download this game. If you've never seen it before, you've never played it before,

47
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:23,399
you're going to get at least three or four hours of content because there is an online multiplayer through the Game Center,

48
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,399
I believe it is on the iPad. So there is a lot of stuff to do.

49
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,399
Now this is not one of those games that you're going to have to come back to 25 times,

50
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,399
but it is a great experience that I think you really should have.

51
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,399
So with that, thank you so much for watching this little review, little gem of the game Tentacle Wars,

52
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,399
and I will see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
