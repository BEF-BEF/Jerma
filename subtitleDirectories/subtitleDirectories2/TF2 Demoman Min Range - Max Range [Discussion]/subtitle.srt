00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:26,079
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing with the Demoman, with the half-demonite setup, gonna be using the Persian Persuader as the melee, the splendid screen, and the lock and load.

2
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:38,079
Now, this video is gonna talk about not only the setup I'm using right now, but also the thought process, I guess, of using a minimum range, maximum range weapon set.

3
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:47,509
And maximum range as in the class's maximum range, not, for instance, the sniper rifle or something like the ambassador headshot or something like that.

4
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:51,820
I'm just talking about minimum range, maximum range for that particular class.

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:59,820
Going into more detail here, I'll talk about two classes in particular that have this sort of setup that you can play with, but I'll talk about the Demoman first.

6
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,819
The lock and load is, for primary, the Demoman's longest shooting weapon.

7
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:16,819
I know that the sticky bomb launcher fits into the category of shooting things across the entire map if you hold the button down, but just for this particular slot, the primary slot, lock and load shoots the farthest, farther than the grenade launcher.

8
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:20,180
And the second part of this equation is my melee item.

9
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,359
Playing as a Demo Knight, that's how you get a lot of kills. You get the guaranteed crit if you charge fast enough.

10
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,359
But for the purpose of this video, let's think about the minimum maximum here.

11
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:37,359
So at any given time, I can pull out that lock and load and shoot as far as the Demoman's primary can possibly reach.

12
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:45,359
At the same time, I can pull out the Persian Persuader and kill somebody almost guaranteed with my melee item if I catch them off guard.

13
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:56,599
So you have this perfect world of range, damage, and accuracy that not very many classes can really say they have with a particular setup.

14
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:02,599
And the reason why I brought up two classes in the beginning of the video is because the pyro fits here as well.

15
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:10,599
If you're using the flamethrower and the flare gun and even the extinguisher, you have all the bases covered that the half Demo Knight has.

16
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:15,599
And I guess you can argue that, hey, well, the sniper kind of has that too.

17
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,599
You can shoot people from across the entire map and kill them instantly.

18
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,599
But you can also throw Jurati on them and Bushwhacka them close range.

19
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:28,599
That's true. But you've got to remember, the sniper has a lot less health than these other two classes.

20
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,599
So it's not really a guaranteed kill if you go in there with your Bushwhacka as a sniper.

21
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,599
You could actually get yourself smashed in the process.

22
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:45,210
And after making this video and after trying to think about this topic, I really started to think, who else potentially has a min range, max range combo?

23
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:51,210
And what I mean by this are classes who have core mechanics based around minimum range and maximum range.

24
00:02:51,210 --> 00:03:00,210
We already talked about the pyro and the Demoman, how the half Demo Knight, you are incredibly guaranteed deadly up close, but you're also pretty deadly far away with the lock and load.

25
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,210
The lock and load can kill a lot of people in one or two hits with that lock and load.

26
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,210
So that's what I'm talking about here.

27
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,210
And I can really only think of maybe one or two other options where this is even possible.

28
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,580
But that's where you guys come in as well, because I like to get your thoughts on these types of things.

29
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,580
You guys all know that.

30
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:21,580
So in the comments section of this video, please leave me a comment telling me a potential and minimum range, maximum range combo.

31
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:29,580
There's a lot of items in this game, and I have only thought of maybe three or four different options, but I'm sure there are a lot of others as well.

32
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,139
So leave me a comment, guys, and we'll keep this discussion going.

33
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:37,139
And before this video comes to a close, I do want to bring up a very, very important PSA.

34
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:42,139
I've only really touched upon this in Twitter and on Facebook, and I think in my Steam group as well.

35
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,139
But I want to make a video about it.

36
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,139
We'll add it into a video, because I do find it to be very, very important.

37
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:59,139
I've heard that there are some imposters around of me and using my name on Steam, trying to get items from you guys, trying to say, oh, hey, I need two unusual hats for this video I'm doing next week.

38
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,139
I got to be very, very clear on this, guys.

39
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:07,139
I will never ask you for any items, ever for any reason.

40
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,139
I'm never going to ask you guys for hats.

41
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,139
I will never ask you guys for anything.

42
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,139
So keep that in mind.

43
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:17,139
If there's a guy named Jerma that talks to you and says, oh, hey, you got a nice unusual hat there.

44
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,139
Can I have it?

45
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,139
Yeah, I'm doing a video tomorrow.

46
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,139
Do not listen to them, because that is absolutely not true.

47
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,139
So I wanted to get that out of the way.

48
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,139
I want to make sure you guys are aware of that.

49
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:28,139
And that's going to wrap up the video.

50
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,139
So thank you guys so much for watching.

51
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,139
I really do appreciate it.

52
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,139
And I'll see you guys all next time.

53
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,139
And of course, take care, everybody.
