00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:15,820
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:25,059
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Heavy with the Tomislav the Sandvich and the Killing Gloves of Boxing.

3
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:34,240
And guys, I've done something I haven't done in a very long time. I've stayed up for over 24 hours for a gaming session.

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,670
I'm a little bit delirious right now. I haven't done this since I was in college.

5
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,909
And it's kind of hard to talk into the mic to be very, very honest with you. It's hard for me to form words.

6
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:46,909
I feel like I've been hit in the head by a sausage or something.

7
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:51,090
But I want to make this video because I want to talk about this very important topic.

8
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,579
And it is being excited for a game again.

9
00:00:54,579 --> 00:01:04,579
Now, in the comments section before I get into this video, I want you to leave me a comment about the last game that you were this excited for where you were to stay up for over 24 hours.

10
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:07,579
This game for me, that game for me is Diablo III.

11
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:15,819
So Diablo III came out and me, Shibby, Star, MLC Stealth, Burger Boy, and Boo's been in the calls with us.

12
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:19,819
But we have all been playing this game pretty much nonstop since its release.

13
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:23,819
And maybe this is the endorphins talking right now because I haven't slept or anything.

14
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:25,819
But yeah, I feel like a million bucks.

15
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:29,189
Something about those long gaming sessions where you get with a group of friends.

16
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,189
You all are having a great time, all on a call, all or even if you're at somebody's house.

17
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:39,370
Back in the day when I was in college, I would be in a dormitory with seven or six or seven other guys.

18
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,370
And we'd all be playing a game and we could all yell at each other.

19
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,370
We could all, you know, trash talk, have fun because that's what it's all about.

20
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:51,989
So these videos that I've been recording off and on, I figured out a potential series to do with Diablo III.

21
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:54,989
But I'm not going to really tell you yet because it's kind of in the works.

22
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,989
But it's going to be very, very interesting if it goes through.

23
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,170
You might see a video tomorrow or the next day about some of our travels in Diablo III.

24
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,170
Me, Shibby, Star, and Brett, MLC Stealth.

25
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,030
So keep on the eye out. Keep your eye out for that.

26
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,030
And I have got a couple of PMs of people wondering if I'm going to do certain things with the server and stuff like that.

27
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,210
But Team Fortress 2 has kind of been on the back burner at least the last 48 hours

28
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,900
because I've just been having a grand old time in Diablo III.

29
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,900
And just touching back again on long sessions and being really psyched for a game that finally comes out.

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,900
You've been waiting for so long when it finally launches.

31
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,900
The midnight release of a game is a really awesome event.

32
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,199
If you have never been to one of those before, please go.

33
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,199
Try and get yourself to one of them.

34
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,199
If you're not old enough, if you're kind of young, you might have to wait a few years to be allowed to go to those

35
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,199
or to get some more freedom so you can stay up a little later.

36
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,199
But they are so cool because you just walk into the front door,

37
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,199
whether it's, you know, you go to your GameStop or Walmart or wherever is having this midnight release.

38
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,379
And it's just everybody collectively there for the same reason.

39
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,620
It's the same thing. It's almost like going to a mini gaming convention.

40
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,620
It's very, very odd. You walk in the front door and there's people that are just like,

41
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,620
Oh my God, everyone's talking about the game.

42
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,620
Everyone's talking about what the story is going to happen.

43
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,620
Who's going to do this? What's going to do that?

44
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,620
And it really is interesting. It's really a lot of fun.

45
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,789
And it gets you right into the zone, makes you go right into game mode.

46
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:21,789
And I've been in that mode for, like I said, exactly 48 hours.

47
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:24,610
And I want to touch upon the gameplay.

48
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,610
Did you see what was just going on right there? I thought that was hysterical.

49
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,610
I was just unloading my minigun on that sentry and it wouldn't go down.

50
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,610
And I was hoping that at some point that engineer was going to run out of metal.

51
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,610
And somebody came up behind me. We were like crossing the streams,

52
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,610
Ghostbuster style, trying to take out that sentry.

53
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,610
And finally he picked it up, which was a move that was going to end in his demise.

54
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,610
And it actually did. But I thought that was hysterical.

55
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,610
I'm just holding the mouse button down, going like, how much metal does this dude have?

56
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,810
But the next game that I plan on doing something like this for,

57
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,979
I don't even know if it's going to happen.

58
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,979
You can never plan these out. You can never plan out these long gaming sessions

59
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:02,979
that end in tireless nights where you stay up all night.

60
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:06,479
But probably, probably Grand Theft Auto V.

61
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,479
That might be the next 24 to 48 hour game session where I inhale coffee for three days.

62
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,479
But that's probably the only one I can think of that would be next.

63
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,100
Other than that, nothing I can really think of off the top of my head.

64
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,100
But there will always be another one.

65
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
There's always going to be that new game coming out.

66
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,279
There's always going to be that new amazing title that you're waiting for.

67
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,279
But to be totally honest, Diablo III and the Diablo franchise

68
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,279
has a very, very big stake in my heart because it's my childhood.

69
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:40,579
When I heard that Diablo III was going to have a sequel, I almost estabricated.

70
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,579
You know, it was ridiculous. I freaked out.

71
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:45,579
And it's because Diablo I and II I played when I was a young teenager.

72
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:48,579
And it's like seeing your childhood come back to life.

73
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,579
And it's amazing with these things.

74
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,759
And I say the same thing about the Neverhood with the Doug to Naples game.

75
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,939
I just wish they would be something else.

76
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,939
And you always reach for something. You always reach for more.

77
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:02,180
And you hope, God, maybe one day they'll bring that series back to life.

78
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,540
And I'm sure a lot of you guys share the same passion that I do

79
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,540
for gaming and video game culture in general.

80
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,540
So it can be a real amazing day when you finally sit down with that game.

81
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,540
And Diablo is that game for me.

82
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,300
This video is very, very ranty.

83
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
And I do apologize for that.

84
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,300
But like I said, my brain is like scrambled eggs right now.

85
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,980
But before this video ends, just the final thought here is,

86
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,980
like I said in the very beginning,

87
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,220
shoot me some comments and give me some of your experiences

88
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,220
with your longtime franchises you want to see revived

89
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,220
or some of your crazy gaming sessions.

90
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,220
Because we are in this all together as a community.

91
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,220
And Otto is about to...

92
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Get away from those wires.

93
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,220
He's like biting the wires from my computer.

94
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,550
I'm going to break this computer. Get out of here.

95
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,550
So that is going to wrap up this particular video, guys.

96
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,550
Thank you all so much for watching.

97
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,730
I really do appreciate it.

98
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,730
And I'll catch you guys all next time.

99
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,290
I've got to get some sleep.

100
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,589
So take care, everybody.
