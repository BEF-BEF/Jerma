1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,490
Hey, what's going on, everybody? How you guys doing?

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,230
Jerma here with a update little video.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,330
I know this is like the second update video in the last three or four months.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,529
And, you know, some things need to be said. There's a lot to talk about.

5
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:17,230
About the channel. About me.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,929
And in the background of this video, it's not gonna be Spider-Man.

7
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:23,329
I promise, it's not gonna be Spider-Man 2 this time.

8
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,030
It's gonna be Spider-Man 3.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,429
Shatter Dimensions.

10
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:29,530
Let's get started. These neighborhoods aren't gonna friendly themselves.

11
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,630
First of all, I want to say thank you to everybody for all the support,

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,000
all the kind words, and everybody that watched JermaRumble live action.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,100
It's been live for a few weeks. It's had a chance to soak in and settle.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,340
And I feel like now is a good enough time for me to, after that video being uploaded,

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:51,140
can talk about not just that video, but the direction of this channel

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:58,000
and the philosophy going forward that I want to use for the rest of the time I really use YouTube.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,600
Because I've been doing this for a long time.

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,700
I've been doing YouTube for about five years now.

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,200
I think my fifth year anniversary, I believe, was in July.

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,599
I'm an old man. I've aged. I've gotten older.

21
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,400
I look like shit, by the way. I look like I'm gonna show you a pretty recent picture.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,140
That's a picture of my face.

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,000
What the fuck happened?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,200
But I've learned stuff. I've learned about myself.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,079
I've learned about what I like to do, what I don't like to do.

26
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,120
I've gotten to a point where I think I've figured it all out, at least for myself, internally.

27
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,920
And it's as follows.

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,319
This channel from now on is gonna be videos that I really wanted to make,

29
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,359
that I wanted to spend time on, that I actually really wanted to care about.

30
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,760
And that might not be a video every couple days.

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,159
That might not be a video every couple weeks.

32
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,799
Whenever I get the urge to, you know what?

33
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,200
I want to make that, and I'm gonna make it, and I'm gonna put a bunch of time into it.

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,799
I'm gonna put a bunch of effort into it.

35
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,000
More than a couple weeks, more than a couple months.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,870
Higher production value videos is what I want the main focus of this channel to be.

37
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,569
Now, that doesn't mean that every video from now on is gonna be a wrestling video.

38
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,569
Okay, he's gonna make like 40-minute live-action wrestling movies for the rest of the time he uses YouTube.

39
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:08,569
No, I mean, there will be more wrestling videos.

40
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,770
I guarantee you that, absolutely.

41
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,469
There's already ideas flying around of the next Jerma wrestling video.

42
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,569
But that's not gonna come out like next week.

43
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,669
That's not gonna be for a little while.

44
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:23,069
You're gonna have to give me a little while on that one, you know what I'm saying?

45
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,569
I don't want to throw any hopes up for people that it's gonna be coming out soon,

46
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,710
but we're working on it already, and other stuff already.

47
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,949
There's a lot of things that already are coming down the pipeline over the next couple months.

48
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,449
And some people might be saying to themselves right now and out loud,

49
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:42,870
maybe, maybe you're pointing at the monitor and talking at me.

50
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,870
Where, what about gaming? What about the gaming videos?

51
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,539
Are you just gonna be a live-action sketch comedy channel?

52
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:54,819
No, it doesn't, the subject matter doesn't matter anymore at this point for me.

53
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:57,620
Like, I think that's really the point I'm trying to get at with this whole,

54
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:03,479
with three minutes into this now, is I want to snip the line on the balloons that are tied to my wrist.

55
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,360
And just watch them fly.

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,360
You know, some balloons are gonna get stuck in a tree.

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Some of those balloons are gonna keep flying.

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,960
Maybe some of those balloons are gonna reach outer space and get in contact with aliens.

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,360
Who knows? I just want to see the balloons fly.

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,460
I want to cover a lot of different bases. I want to do a lot of different stuff.

61
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,159
I already have a lot of things that I want to spend time on.

62
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:29,560
Like I said, it's one of those situations where game, non-game, it doesn't matter to me right now.

63
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,560
It completely is, that's out of the question for my brain.

64
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,840
It's what do I care about right now, and what do I want to spend time on.

65
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,740
But, here's the second part of this video.

66
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:46,629
And this is, you know, people that might be upset about the fact that I'm not making as many videos as I used to.

67
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:48,520
I have a second channel now.

68
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,919
And it's already up, it's already live, there's already like six videos on it.

69
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,419
You can go right now, the whole screen is a link.

70
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:00,120
This, right now, the annotation on the screen will take you to the channel.

71
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,620
There's a link in the description.

72
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,520
Go subscribe to that channel if you want to see a bunch of videos all the time.

73
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,129
Because what the second channel is going to be is a stream highlight channel from my Twitch stream.

74
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,530
And anything else that I want to put up there.

75
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,529
It could be random videos anytime I deem it necessary.

76
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,829
Just stuff that I don't want to put on this channel.

77
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,230
Because like I said, this channel I want to be reserved only for stuff like German Rumble live action.

78
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,600
And, you know, the high production, I just, we just talked about it for five minutes.

79
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,480
But second channel stream highlights, and we're going to have a schedule now.

80
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,449
We're going to have a schedule. Before I go into the second channel anymore,

81
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:41,680
my Twitch.tv stream is going to have a legit three day a week schedule.

82
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,980
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, we're going to be live at seven o'clock Eastern time.

83
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,660
Seven p.m. Eastern time. That's my stream schedule.

84
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,860
I ain't doing this anymore.

85
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,060
I talked about this in the past how I don't like to have schedules because I never can adhere to them.

86
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,959
But sometimes it gets like to a point where it's like, what time is it?

87
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,360
Or it's like seven forty five. I wasn't like two in the morning.

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,959
Yeah, I'll stream for like six hours or whatever.

89
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,459
No, no, no. Two weeks go by.

90
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,759
What is this? A fucking thing of orange juice.

91
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,459
I'll chug that and then stream for like 20 minutes.

92
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:15,360
I got I got to have a schedule and that's what's going to happen.

93
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,560
Every Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, Twitch.tv slash German nine eight five.

94
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,660
I'll be live. I'll be playing anything.

95
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,660
It doesn't matter what it is. I'm going to just stream it and have fun.

96
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:31,180
Like I did like a month or two ago when I was streaming all the time and it's going to get edited.

97
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,379
The streams that I think are funny that I think are good are going to get put together

98
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:37,959
and get uploaded to that second channel.

99
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,759
They're going to be condensed. It's going to be high quality.

100
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,860
They're not going to be just thrown up for our live streams.

101
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,160
It's actually going to be videos like ones that you probably were used to seeing a couple of years ago

102
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,660
are going up on the channel.

103
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,959
I have a lot of them. I have a lot of videos to upload to that channel that is going to take me a while.

104
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,329
But you can expect at least a few videos a week uploaded to this channel.

105
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:03,829
Second channel links in the description in the screen.

106
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:07,930
Go there if you want to see a bunch of stream highlights and a bunch of other random videos

107
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,930
who knows what the hell I'm going to upload there.

108
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,930
I don't even know. You might see me eating breakfast.

109
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,930
It could happen. It could go up on that channel.

110
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,389
That's the second channel. You know what I'm saying?

111
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:19,290
That's pretty much it.

112
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,089
So let's go over it. Here we go again.

113
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,490
We're going to go over this one more time.

114
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,689
And I'm going to go over very A, B, C.

115
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:25,930
Okay. A.

116
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,029
Jerma985.

117
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,060
The channel you're on right now.

118
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,040
Infrequent, higher quality videos.

119
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,639
Videos that I cared about that I wanted to spend time on.

120
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,970
Infrequent.

121
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,370
Jerma.

122
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,470
I don't have a name for the channel yet.

123
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,040
It's just second Jerma channel.

124
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,620
Stream highlights.

125
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,620
Other videos.

126
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,819
Very frequent upload schedule.

127
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:46,620
All the time.

128
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,980
Content.

129
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,980
Twitch.tv.

130
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,079
C.

131
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,879
Tuesday.

132
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,079
Thursday and Friday.

133
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,959
7pm Eastern time.

134
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,600
Every single time.

135
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,800
No exceptions.

136
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,399
Unless I get like sick.

137
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,600
Then I won't stream.

138
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,569
But Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.

139
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:04,170
Twitch.tv slash Jerma985.

140
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,170
And that's all I got to say.

141
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:05,769
That's it.

142
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:09,970
I hope I could make it clear enough that these things are happening.

143
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,610
That this is kind of the direction the channel is taking now.

144
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,009
And yeah.

145
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,079
Go subscribe to Jerma2.

146
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,420
And I'll see you guys soon.

147
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,620
Have a good night guys.

148
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,720
See you later.

149
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,920
Have a good rest of your summer.

150
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,420
It's not even summer.

151
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,490
It's like, it's like September 26th.

152
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,029
Oh my god.

153
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:34,129
Yeah, the last time I made like a hey what's up guys video was in like fucking June.

154
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,699
Or like May.

155
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,899
It's been, have a good rest of your summer.
