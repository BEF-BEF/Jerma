00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,339
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:21,339
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Engineer on Man vs. Machine mode. This is Man Up mode.

3
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:25,339
The map is Man Works. It's not the Endurance mode, it's the other one.

4
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:30,339
They all have such crazy names in this Man vs. Machine update that it's hard to remember them sometimes.

5
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:34,340
But anyways, this is a very special video because this is where I complete my Tour of Duty,

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,340
and I get my strange Bot Killer item. I'm not going to tell you what it is, I don't want to spoil the surprise for you.

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,340
But I will change over to live commentary here in the end, just so you can hear my reaction to getting it,

8
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,700
because I was very, very, very happy about it.

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,700
But what this video is going to be about, it's not going to be anything about the Man vs. Machine update,

10
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,700
or any of the cool things that it brought with it. It's actually going to talk about the Saxie Awards.

11
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,700
And nope, I don't want to get your hopes up here. I don't plan on having an entry to the Saxie Awards this year.

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,700
I don't plan on making something crazy, collaboration or anything like that, and loading it up and having people vote for it.

13
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,700
I plan on watching, and that's pretty much the basis of this entire video.

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,700
And let me rewind for a second here.

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,879
So last year, guys, you remember the Saxie Awards last year, this was going on before I had a YouTube channel.

16
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:27,120
The Saxie Awards, the voting and all that stuff all happened before I even had a YouTube account.

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,120
German985 did not exist.

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,120
And I really do feel like it was the Saxies that helped inspire my YouTube channel,

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,120
helped to make me create videos and get involved in the community and all that good stuff.

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:47,120
And it brings me to 50,000 subscribers and how I just passed it and how eternally grateful I am that all you guys are here.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,120
It's mind-blowing, everybody, and I love every single one of you guys. You all know that.

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,120
And I never thought this was ever going to happen, but this is why I made this video.

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,489
Inspiration is going to come from some very, very weird places.

24
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:03,489
Places you were never going to even imagine they're going to come from.

25
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:07,659
A lot of you guys know I wanted to be a film director. I've talked about that before.

26
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:12,659
But nothing was ever there. I never had the inspiration to do anything, ever.

27
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:19,659
And I would always talk about it, you know, tomorrow we're going to do some videos, and it never happened.

28
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:24,840
And it's right when I started watching these Saxie videos, I just went, yes, that is what I want to do.

29
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,840
I want to have fun, I want to make these videos, and I want to do this right now.

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,840
And actually, less than three weeks after the Saxies, I had a YouTube channel.

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,080
And I had it running, and I was making TF2 videos, and I was doing...I actually did an Insane Aquarium video, too, as grandpa.

32
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:48,080
But regardless of all of this, keep an open mind, guys, because you never know when something's going to strike you like lightning and just go for something.

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,080
And this really is in a totally different spectrum than what I wanted to do.

34
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,080
And that's what I'm trying to talk about here.

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,080
Imagine you drop your cell phone on the ground, and it breaks.

36
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,080
And you say, oh my God, my cell phone is broken for the last goddamn time.

37
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,080
So you make a device, it's a cell phone case, but the difference is it has a string on it.

38
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,080
So if you drop it or if you hold it, it's always going to be attached to you by a little fine string, and it can go right in your pocket.

39
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,080
And people say, wow, that's a really great idea. Can you make me one of those?

40
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,080
And you say, yeah, sure. And you make five of them. Then you make ten of them.

41
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,080
And then you open up your own company that's a cell phone case company.

42
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,080
All the while, during your day job, during your career, you've been an accountant.

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,080
And it's just that's how things happen. Life is very unpredictable.

44
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:44,080
So you need to take these unpredictable aspects of life and just run with them and just see what happens and see how much fun you have and see, you know, try everything.

45
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,080
I'm one of those people that if there's 10 ice cream flavors in front of me and they're all weird, I'm going to try every single one of them.

46
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Because you know what? I might love the one that's over all the way to the right.

47
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
You never know. You just never know what's going to happen, guys.

48
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,319
So with that, I want to say thank you again so much for 50,000.

49
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,319
There's going to be a pretty crazy video coming out this weekend.

50
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,319
So keep your eyes on that.

51
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,319
And I'm going to transition over to the live commentary for this man versus machine mode.

52
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,319
So you get to see my live reaction as to getting this strange bot killer weapon.

53
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,319
So thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

54
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:25,319
And if you're going to do the sexies this year, if you're planning on having an entry, let me know because I would love to watch it because I'm going to sit there and watch every single one this year as well.

55
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,319
So, yeah, I'll see you guys all soon.

56
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:30,319
And of course, take care everybody.

57
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,319
Give it to him. I don't buy it.

58
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,319
Bye, Don.

59
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,939
One more spy.

60
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:36,939
There's only one spy left.

61
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,569
Watch your backs.

62
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:43,620
There is a spy.

63
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,620
I'm running out of ammo.

64
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,509
All right.

65
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:48,509
Oh, this guy's done.

66
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,509
Oh, last spy is down to give me a real.

67
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:51,509
He's dead.

68
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:52,509
Who's heavy?

69
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:53,509
Who's heavy got ammo?

70
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:54,509
I don't.

71
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:55,509
I don't have ammo.

72
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:56,509
I don't need ammo.

73
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:57,509
I got ammo.

74
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:58,509
Where are you?

75
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,509
I'm here.

76
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:00,509
This thing's done.

77
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,509
It's over.

78
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,509
We got it.

79
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:03,509
Nice job, guys.

80
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:04,509
Nice.

81
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:05,509
Yeah.

82
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,009
Oh, my God.

83
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,009
I got the wrench.

84
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,009
I got the wrench.

85
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,009
Did you?

86
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,310
Yes.

87
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,310
I got the pyrobotnix pack.

88
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,310
Oh, yes.

89
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,310
I got the wrench.

90
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,310
Sick germ.

91
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,310
Yes.

92
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,310
Oh, man.

93
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,310
Good job, buddy.

94
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,490
Oh, wow.

95
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,490
That's awesome.

96
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,490
Nice.

97
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,490
Oh, somebody else got the pyrobotnix.

98
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,490
Yeah, where's the pyrobotnix pack?

99
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,490
It's a miscellaneous.

100
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,490
Ari got you a hat.

101
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,490
It's like a hat.

102
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,490
It's a miscellaneous hat.

103
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,490
Oh, yeah.

104
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,490
Oh, and I'm so glad I got that wrench.

105
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,490
Shibby, you called it.

106
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,490
Oh, you got the neon allot and annihilator, too.

107
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,490
Nice.

108
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,490
Yeah.

109
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,490
What's up, babyface blaster?

110
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,490
Shibby.

111
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,490
You're going to switch blasters and equipment.

112
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,490
I want to see it.

113
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,490
Yeah, Shibby.

114
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,490
Nice.

115
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,490
Nice call there.

116
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,490
You said that at the very beginning.

117
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,240
Awesome.

118
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,540
Oh, and stealth, you got the backpack.

119
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,540
Oh, man, that sucks.

120
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
Oh, we can't change items right now.

121
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,540
And Burger got a backpack, too.

122
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,540
Nice.

123
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,540
Yeah.

124
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,540
Can you see it?

125
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,540
Yeah.

126
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,540
Everyone got something cool, but me ends pain.

127
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,540
Yeah, this thing is so goofy looking.

128
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,540
It's like a big skull head.

129
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,540
Oh, yeah.

130
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,540
Oh, yeah.

131
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,540
Oh, yeah.

132
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,540
Oh, yeah.

133
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,540
Oh, yeah.

134
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,540
Oh, yeah.

135
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,540
Oh, yeah.

136
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,540
Oh, yeah.

137
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,540
Oh, yeah.

138
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,540
Oh, yeah.

139
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,540
Oh, yeah.

140
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,540
Oh, yeah.

141
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,540
Oh, yeah.

142
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,540
Oh, yeah.

143
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,540
Oh, yeah.
