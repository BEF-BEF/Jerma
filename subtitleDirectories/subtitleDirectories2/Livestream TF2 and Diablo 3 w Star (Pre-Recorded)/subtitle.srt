16
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:19,289

Oh god, this might be bad. I

46
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,430
Might have to kick a couple people only because my reserve slot doesn't work right now

47
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,009
Kick well, let me see. Let me see. I'm just gonna ask if anyone's cuz I'm not gonna kick anyone unless they're willing

48
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,550
See if I can get maybe one or two people

49
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,970

50
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:12,029

57
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,629
Really, you don't like gold rush

58
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,670
It's all right sometimes I don't know it seems like it's come up a lot every time I look at you on the server

00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,230
It's up. Hey, let's play gold rush. Oh, I love going to rush

60
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:08,949
Gold rush is like my favorite map

00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,949
No, I I I gotta there's a lot of things that have to happen with this server

00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:33,549
Are you leaving your server? No, I'm gonna restart it

65
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:41,279
Yes, that's the fairest way to do it. This is I guess this is the this is the really only way the fair way

66
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,840
No one's leaving

67
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
You're all getting out. It's closed

68
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,330
This is my server, but we're trying to get star in the game and my reserve slot isn't really set up correctly

69
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,769
So it doesn't work

70
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,769

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:57,690
We've got special guest star here. I am going to bottom frag every time. I

112
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:03,090

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,139
Like jump it or all I gonna do

114
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:10,500
We jump this way that way oh

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,039
God why is it doing this? Okay, it didn't crash. It didn't crash. It's all good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good

116
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,059
All right. I'm getting shot at from somewhere. Oh

117
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:28,100
I'm too crazy

118
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,100
He punched me. He actually punched me

119
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,840
See I changed my setup a little bit

120
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,360
See I'm playing obviously in a window and I move the window to like the right part of my screen

121
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,159
So I'm just like look it's it's really I gotta get used to this

122
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,120
Because I have the chat on the left and I have the window I know I need two monitors so bad it

123
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,639
I can't believe I waited as long as I did the end

124
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,519
Just for streaming

125
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:01,299
You know, I just need I need a I need about a computer, you know

126
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,419
The problem it's the problem is my computer is just it's good

127
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:09,779
I have a really good computer, but it's just not good enough to do two things at the same time

128
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:21,049
I'm gonna go scout. We'll go and scout. What's what somebody's asking the IP. It's just in my server

129
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:23,929
Oh, and I got smashed right there. That's not good

130
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:27,289
many centuries I

131
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:32,779
Shouldn't even mention it with nothing. What what am I complaining about? Nothing? Nobody heard it

132
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:41,700
No one heard. Oh

133
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:48,659
Get him. I can't believe I got up and get away. Also another problem harvest event is really dark

134
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,139
So it's like hard to see anyways

135
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:58,379
This map is I should play it more often because I play way too much harvest, but this is like it's totally different

136
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,500
Yeah, it's like it's like a whole new world

137
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:08,470
Playing crit scout. Yeah

138
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:14,460
Can't even go over there

139
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:18,730
with rocket jumps

140
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,179
Rocket job. Oh

141
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:27,500
No, I render the damn ghost. I hate this ghost. Why is this map in my rotation? I don't know why I

142
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,429
Missed actually, it's good every now and then yeah

143
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:40,500
Kind of like uh, I really hate I a ducked for the fact that has pumpkins laying everywhere

144
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,460
Mm-hmm killed by a pumpkin you feel like an idiot, but I had a look amazing

145
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,980
compared to the other viaducts

146
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:51,360
Yeah, I I ducked is fun. Yeah, I just got killed by a pumpkin

147
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,789
Crit scout crit scout. Oh, come on. He wasn't even there before

148
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,659
That's malarkey

149
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,789
Malarkey malarkey

150
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:16,419
Somebody's behind me, but I want to kill the soldier. He's dead. Anyways, no, this guy's got me. This guy's got me

151
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:26,649
Oh, this guy's got me. Oh, no, I got him. I'm not going in there pumpkin

152
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:36,960
Pumpkin, I shouldn't have shot him from that far away

153
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,789
too bad

154
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:48,379
Actually not doing too bad right now

155
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,610
Well, I'm doing terrible because I have a market garden anyone yet

Quite literally the most amazing market gardeners probably ever happened ever

159
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,900
What'd you do?

160
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:18,549
It's I don't know. I don't know how to describe it, but it was for rocket jumps

161
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:24,309
I was surfing up a ramp so I was technically on the ground except it doesn't count. He was on the ground. Mm-hmm

162
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,740
That you know, I know man, is it the same type of thing when you when you

163
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,980
You know when you air blast somebody that's on an incline and they don't go anywhere but it technically they're still in the air

164
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,299
Yeah, it's like if anything is slanted and you rocket jump fast enough

165
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:43,579
You'll slide up it and sort of launches you off. It was the middle of sliding up something. I hit somebody

166
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,180
Yeah, when I use the uh

167
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,460
The reserve shooter I'll air blast somebody that's on an incline. They don't go anywhere, but I still get the mini crits on him

168
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,660
It's weird

169
00:17:52,660 --> 00:18:01,480
Is the server full I believe it is I believe it is have to imagine so

170
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,970
This is your first stream ever

171
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:07,089
Welcome. Thanks for coming

172
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:12,539
whole chaos

173
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:18,619
Absolute chaos. I need health. I'm not going after that demo man with that health

174
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:22,420
What a bad I did. Why am I drinking this right here? That was a terrible idea

175
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,230
Pumpkin, yeah crap. Oh

176
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:35,700
That is star that is star your ears are not deceiving you

177
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,150
I think I just rocket jumped off a pumpkin and it was it was glorious

178
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:51,099
Is that like possible can you actually do that either that or a rocket hit me as I jumped I don't know Wow oh

179
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,289
I was pulling on

180
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:08,369
That was just one of those moments my whole body just shake shook shaked because I like was pulling up my melee and he

181
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:10,369
Shot me

182
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:14,210
Nearly 11 p.m.

183
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:18,039
What do you only Q bandit where you from in that's that's a long?

184
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:26,559
That's a huge difference. Yeah pumpkin

185
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:35,190
Yes, this is being recorded and will be uploaded in a few hours whenever I finish

186
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
14 days you got to wait for it

187
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,740
It's two weeks for processing

188
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:53,220
Actually, you know the the 720 streams on YouTube they do take quite a long time to process really

189
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,720
Melbourne, Australia

190
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:05,140
That is across the whole world. Well. Thanks for coming dude. It's a long ways away go in

191
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:09,099
immaculate crits

192
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:21,150
No, I can't go over there that certain death get out of here go go go. Oh, it's the ghost

193
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:37,349
Now I am so dead. Nice shot, dude. Nice shot. Do I have any scout tips? Um

194
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:40,549
Star do you have any scout tips?

195
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:43,509
Shoot things I guess

196
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,470
Shoot things and run

197
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:55,539
Yeah, I will tell you those scouts for me at least used to be one of my worst classes I was awful

198
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,799
And I just played it's just the more you play with it. The better you're gonna get I know I had like a

199
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,119
Die a lot. I had pretty much

200
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:13,140
It was my least play class behind pyro. Now. It's one of my most played classes. Oh

201
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:21,779
God you need to die a lot to start realizing you're gonna dial on this

202
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:27,640
Stop dying. No, I think we've got a robot star here. I'm sorry

203
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:35,859
No, no, not anymore. Not anymore. Okay, I am getting random blanks like so maybe every once in a while. I'll be a robot

204
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:46,650
That's okay. We we forgive you. We all still love you. I think that's spy. No. Yeah, it is

205
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:52,740
Oh, yeah, it is. I could smell you getting off the elevator

206
00:21:53,579 --> 00:22:03,799
There's no elevator on this map. You wish here last night to wasn't you come on. What's that? What's that from stuff?

207
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:08,099
I don't know. Oh, come on. I'm sorry. I'm not cool. Oh

208
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,240
home alone, too

209
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:15,559
I'm the one that's not cool and you're here quoting

210
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Nevermind

211
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,349
Did you I spoke to it? I've got I love that movie

212
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:30,579
beep-boop shot beep-boop. Oh

213
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,119
So I went to Dunkin Donuts. Don't do it. Oh, you know, it's so good

214
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,329
You got Dunkin Donuts in New Jersey. That's a case. I love the place. Isn't it? Yeah

215
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:51,730
Actually a one train ride home from Boston. There's Dunkin Donuts. There's like three Dunkin Donuts in South Station. Yeah

216
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,769
So I bought a dozen chocolate frosted doughnuts for myself

217
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:02,450
The person getting them for me just the entire time. They're picking out doughnuts giving me this awkward. Look

218
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,009
What could you possibly be using these for?

219
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,559
That's a lot for one person I

220
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,460
Need two slots

221
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:18,819
You need two reserve slots

222
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:28,259
Please reply what server is it? It's my server

223
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,539
my server

224
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:38,589
German's East Coast sir. No put it down. I

225
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:43,670
Hate when that happens when I you go too far. He's like just miss with the mini century

226
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,269
That's too far man

227
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:51,750
You miss with the mini century. I don't know some some reason it happens though. Oh

228
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,240
God, this is the ghost again. You know what? I'm just gonna taunt because oh when you taunt

229
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,059
I'm just like dancing. Oh wait, that's because I have that I thought I had the

230
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,940
thought I had the

231
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:10,079
Gunslinger out, but I didn't where is he? I heard a spy

232
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,960
Now that was a dumb thing

233
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:23,509
Someone said doughnuts are amazing, especially crispy crispy creams. You've had a crispy cream doughnut. Um, I think so

234
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,190
No, maybe oh, they're so good

235
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:31,460
Crispy cream doughnuts are incredible. I don't know don't have names

236
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:35,069
Well, it's it's like it's like a company it's like kind of like a Dunkin Donuts

237
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,680
crispy creams

238
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:46,619
Pretty much a crispy cream doughnut is just a glazed doughnut and it literally melts inside of your mouth. It is just on it's unreal

239
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:50,910
You can't there's only like a few of them around around the Northeast though

240
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,529
unfortunate thing you've ever had

241
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,170
ice cream

242
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:01,690
Um ice cream. What it what's ice cream? Is that like something to do with like milk?

243
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:04,859
What am I doing? Why am I doing this?

244
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:12,019
Am I ever gonna put a ping limit on my server to be honest?

245
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,180
Probably 20

246
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,380
Probably not

247
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,059
The only reason why I say that is because I haven't had one in the last like

248
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,380
Two or three weeks since the service been online and hasn't really been any problems

249
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:31,779
So probably not and if there ever was one it would probably be something very very high something like ridiculously high like

250
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,700
480 or something

251
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,140
That's pretty low

252
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:39,140
I wish I had 480 thing. Oh

253
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,259
This heavy. Oh my god. I ran out of bullets. Oh, no. Oh

254
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:52,029
You're dead. Oh, why'd I do that?

255
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:59,500
Mr. Foreman Gary the Foreman Gary

256
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,960
Okay, I think this is guy's name

257
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,700
Okay, he told me uh, I

258
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:11,339
To say his name

259
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,859
And I just did it cuz I felt like

260
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:21,250
Don't worry. We'll get this thing built up baby. Let's do it baby. There was a ghost

261
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:28,859
I'll name him Gary. Oh what I didn't get it off in time. Oh, I'm so mad at myself

262
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,539
Let's go for a punch ready. Oh

263
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,859
Get over here you son of a

264
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:41,859
We're going punch only engineer right now, it's gonna work cuz every time I scream

265
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:47,500
I'm telling you dude every time I stream and I just go for melee only it for some reason it works

266
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
I don't know why I don't know. I

267
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,380
Wish I knew the answer

268
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,660
But for instance like oh my god, this guy just crits cringed me. No, I have no oh

269
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,980
It was a nice attempt with the

270
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,140
ng fist only crits cringed

271
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,470
It's super effective

272
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:18,880
That's her Pokemon. I

273
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:23,880
Hate this door glitch on harvest. I just want to leave. Are you stuck somewhere? Oh

274
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,650
Punch in the center. I'm gonna punch the crap out of it

275
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:40,430
All right, so I'm gonna ask you this first before I

276
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,230
Before I answer it, but do you like the Vikings?

277
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,950
Vikings huh?

278
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,099
like

279
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:56,859
Like real Vikings or are we talking about fictional Vikings right now? I don't know. That was the question

280
00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:00,140
No, I actually I meant to hit J. I hate how J and K are right next to each other. I mean

281
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,700
Thor was okay

282
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:06,950
so

283
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,500
Yeah, Thor was okay, I I enjoy bike

284
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:17,059
But if you're having stream issues try to refresh the stream refresh the page

285
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:20,099
Oh, you're gonna say grabbing stream issues then Vikings aren't that good

286
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:32,720
Yeah, if you're especially if you're on 720 then a good refresh the stream will probably help you out probably

287
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,279
And Vikings are even worse

288
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,869
How does it look by the way for anyone watching how because this is only the second time I've ever streamed in 720

289
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:43,829
Is it we good?

290
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:45,829
We sound good. We look good. We smell good

291
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,349
And your internets fine with that?

292
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,730
Apparently it wasn't last night. That's for sure. I

293
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,710
Not tried to stream 720 a long time

294
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:59,829
My internet just seems that it doesn't enjoy

295
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:02,509
Yeah, I'd rather lay back

296
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:09,470
Hey, if if all goes well, then that's I mean last time I did 720 it seemed to work. Okay?

297
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,529
But last night I was trying to set it up because I usually stream on Saturday nights

298
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,650
And it was just like no I could I could barely stream in 360 last night

299
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,650
I was like testing it by myself on listed

300
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:24,329
Or private whatever and it was not happening

301
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:35,819
If you haven't stream problems, I feel bad for you, son. I got nine and a half problems motor stream ain't one. No

302
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,180
Joby

303
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,619
Joby, I love your quote

304
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:46,970
Hey, look at what I tell you just punching. Oh, you're not getting away

305
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,650
That was the shotgun

306
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:57,750
No, it wasn't knock. Okay. Yeah, that was a I punched my fist and it looked like a shotgun. Oh

307
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,019
my god

308
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:06,690
chaos

309
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:12,400
There's like a line of soldiers waiting to market garden me

310
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:23,819
I'll go. Don't wait you go. What class is star star?

311
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:27,509
Spies bond

312
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,829
What class is a

313
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,029
What

314
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:36,349
What class is star? He's a soldier. Sorry when that's by backstab me

315
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:38,789
I had like like an aneurysm or something. That was weird

316
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:41,509
Don't do that. It's not good for you

317
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:55,299
Many century fight. Well, we got two many centuries and we got a spa. I am almost there

318
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,119
No, I don't want kills on my market gardener

319
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:07,509
81 81 nice nice nice nice nice nice

320
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:13,579
Somebody asked am I gonna do another scary game facecam?

321
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,180
Yeah, dude that game was horrible

322
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:23,900
Horrible in the terms of I completely I'm with you. I'm good with scary like just watch me. Oh god, please

323
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,900
Why are you still going down?

324
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,259
We've agreed. This is a bad idea

325
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:34,500
It's you know what? It's because I started I'll give you guys I'll give you the backstory about that video

326
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:37,019
so I started recording and

327
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:40,500
I figured because I got a bunch of people asked me to do that

328
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:45,140
Somebody was like, oh do amnesia do SCP do this or that so I just was like, you know

329
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,619
I'm gonna do it

330
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:49,460
I feel like doing it and I got to a point where I was gonna turn it off

331
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,339
I was like, you know what?

332
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:54,220
I'm not gonna make this video like I'll just do something else like I'm not gonna make this video

333
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:00,099
Because I sat down with it and notice how the video started when I was like kind of down with two

334
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:08,509
Yeah, like I I just I pretty much get oh god, I'm lagging why oh

335
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,549
No, that's the order. That's the door glitch. I think you were talking about before

336
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,950
What's I the video starts and I'm like already down two floors

337
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:21,349
That's because I stopped recording and I just sit in there going. I don't I can't do this

338
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:27,750
I really I really didn't think I could do it and then halfway through when I was actually recording

339
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:33,369
You can you can see like in my face during the video. Oh my god over time over time. This is a pretty ridiculous fight

340
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,369
I'll get back to that story in a second. We lost no

341
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:39,009
Oh

342
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:43,450
Round ends as I'm midair. That's market going someone. That's all that matters

343
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:46,799
It's all matters

344
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,440
nothing else matters

345
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:56,059
But yes, I mean I I started to get to that point where I got the first spooked the first like big jumping scare

346
00:32:56,819 --> 00:33:02,019
For a second. I was like, you know what? I'm about to hit I'm not I'm gonna hit escape f9 and I'm not doing it

347
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:05,619
But that's what I said, like, you know what? I can't give up like I have

348
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:09,299
I'm already like halfway done with like this thing. I might as well finish it

349
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,809
When that guy comes out that stuff, I'm not gonna ruin it really if you ever do

350
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:19,019
It's it is it is terrifying

351
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,940
Rage quits the game for you, too

352
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,500
That's why like at the end of the video I look like somebody hit me in the face with a wrench after that

353
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,740
I watched more videos of the game because like I wanted to figure out like how it ended or there was more

354
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,950
yeah, I freaked out because

355
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,339
seriously like

356
00:33:37,339 --> 00:33:41,900
What you saw at the end of that video was like a 100% genuine like my face

357
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:47,299
I thought I didn't even know what was going on. I freaked out and then I was just like wait what happened?

358
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:57,579
Why am I did me? I was genuinely befuddled. Oh, that's not live stream it. Oh

359
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:01,369
Yeah, keep playing

360
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:12,719
Become known as the stair simulator guy the stairs the new stair simulator you're on it

361
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:20,550
Somebody was telling me to do a containment breach, and I looked up a couple things on it and my god that kid oh

362
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:23,230
my god

363
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:29,260
That it just looks it looks it looks ten times worse than scp. Oh eight seven the regular one

364
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:34,280
Wow nice shot

365
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,340
No, I'm gonna go

366
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:44,969
Bye like that one is like actually 3d make creatures and weird like stuff. We're not really 3d, but it's I

367
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,269
Was scared playing Quake 4 so

368
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,469
There's a game. You should not be scared playing

369
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,429
Quake 4

370
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:58,340
Yeah, there's this one room where there's like a giant beating heart in it

371
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,619
It's really dark and it took me like 20 minutes to get there

372
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,340
But all you have to do is walk up some stairs and like the missions over I

373
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,099
Was like just crouched walking the whole time like nope nope

374
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:12,519
doing this oh

375
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,920
We're gonna get up. I knew that was gonna happen. I knew that was gonna happen

376
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:25,780
What class do I play the most probably engineer you get actually we'll take a look you know

377
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,820
I do from here

378
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,980
Stats there you go. I've actually don't think I've ever shown this excited in a Q&A one time

379
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,300
But these are my team fortress 2 stats

380
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,559
And the reason why spy is so high this goes back in like 2007

381
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:43,079
Like that's all I played

382
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,840
Got a spy. I was looking at my set the other day, and I was disappointed with how much spy I played

383
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,239
Mm-hmm like 35 hours. When did I do that? When did I waste that much time?

384
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:56,119
Yeah, I have 138 hours to do that. That's nothing though

385
00:35:56,199 --> 00:36:04,199
And also this is um I think my stats got reset at some point like very early on in the game

386
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:06,400
Oh, yeah, I reset mine a while. Yeah, oh

387
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:13,789
God there was one day where I was playing with bots and no one was playing with bots

388
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:17,030
I was like oh, I have to do this. I have to reset this

389
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,840
Bye

390
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,960
Spy on spy on spy

391
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:28,969
Whoa whoa no I didn't want to hit end

392
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:35,139
All right team, what do you say we do this come on? Let's go, baby

393
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:40,659
Did the dirt did it did the dirt? We're all hitting this together Jake

394
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:44,219
I'll play spy

395
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:45,909
spy

396
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:54,039
Spy I want to be the cool kind of person who plays spy. I want to be the coolest on this play

397
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:59,559
Oh come on. I was trying to did I actually get away with that like I did no I didn't oh

398
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:09,010
God, I just keep getting people like right when they have no health

399
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:18,130
That's how you do it. Oh, I knew I was gonna screw that up

400
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:24,849
Knew I was gonna screw that up. It's a bad attitude

401
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:35,300
No, I did a dead space to video well technically by I technically did grandpa has one on respawn

402
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:41,719
It's a hole in this straw, and I can't drink the rest of my iced tea

403
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,250
You're supposed to be a hole in it. That's how straws work. No

404
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,130
Aren't you so glad I'm here?

405
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,090
I am I it's

406
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,969
Hold on let me fix this

407
00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:06,289
There we go. I did that. I did the best thing I flipped the straw upside down and put it back in genius

408
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:09,369
I know I am a genius already. I have no idea where we're going

409
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:12,449
I should have just changed the map to begin with but I was too busy like not paying attention

410
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,730
Hopefully, it's gold rush stars favorite map

411
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:19,420
like nowhere to jump I

412
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:22,389
Love gold rush so much

413
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,820
Actually, I did see one person who can do a jump on

414
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:33,059
Second point second map of gold rush from like start to finish all the way through with one jump

415
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,940
I'd probably just spend the entire round trying to do that

416
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:42,619
And if I did it our team would win just instantly. It's like getting a nuke

417
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:45,869
Getting a nuke

418
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:50,500
Somebody asked do I like yeah?

419
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:56,940
I'm using the diamond back because I like it and plus it's it's strange to so got to use it if it's strange I

420
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:00,610
Think that the diamond back has a bad rap

421
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:03,880
It's

422
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
Okay, I mean it's not it's

423
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,199
When you're fighting like 40 gunslinger and cheese. It's yeah

424
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:15,730
Well, let's put it this way right so the the ambassador and the diamond back had to do the same damage, right?

425
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:18,349
The ambassador shoots slower

426
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:22,030
The ambassador shoots 20% slower than the diamond back

427
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,469
But you get crits on the headshots

428
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:29,389
I mean you get crits on this if Doug you said if there are many centuries around I would say they're both good a

429
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:36,789
Lot of people really bash on the the diamond back well the best part about the diamond back is the sound oh yeah

430
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:40,510
So I mean technically it's it's like a better. It's a

431
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:47,590
Default if you're not going for headshots. It's better than the ambassador if you can't get headshots. It's better than the ambassador for sure

432
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:53,550
The ambassador is still though. It's it's so good. It's so good. Oh

433
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,559
Yeah playing that guitar. Oh

434
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:12,219
Are you why am I wearing that like Christmas item? I gotta put my ring on and somebody gave me

435
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:21,630
I have like the Christmas heart thing on you're just I don't know you're

436
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:23,230
hearty

437

I'm a cold so I could think of I totally forgot the frying pan

438
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,179
frying pan is

439
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:39,320
There's a mini century

440
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:44,809
I'm gonna take that out

441
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,650
Do rank oh

442
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,090

450
00:41:55,739 --> 00:42:01,820
Yeah, I'm disguised as you. I know that I know the deal. Oh, I tried a side stab and it never works cuz I'm too terrible

451
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,900
It's fine

452
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,380

It's gonna be awesome get fear three fear three

454
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:24,909
You're three being scary. I don't think so hmm. I heard it's pretty I heard it's got its moments

455
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,389
My roommate in college played he was like a big fan of fear one and two he like praised the game all the time

456
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:32,389
I just never had time to play it be honest a

457
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:40,119
Lion cast I got a I got to talk about that. I will talk about that

458
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:44,280
I think I want to do it in a proper video though. Not like really in a live stream and wait. That's you

459
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,099
Yeah, I just I shoot you. I'm sorry

But it's okay pretty much for the just about 400 people watching right now. I will I will give you a sneak peek of what's going on

461
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,599
I'm playing in a tournament if those of you that know incredible orb

464
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,800
It's like in not even in pre-alpha

465
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,519
But this this next weekend

00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:20,119
We're gonna be playing a tournament

00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:53,789
It's kind of like a quake type game. It's kind of like a quake mod type game

476
00:43:54,789 --> 00:44:00,460
But yeah, it is uh, it is a oh you're gonna get crit right here, baby

But I'm gonna make I'll make a proper video explaining

479
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,639
Explaining what it actually is in like a vlog or something in the next couple days, but it's exciting. It's really exciting

480
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:17,360
I haven't been able to talk about it. So my lips had had to be sealed the last couple weeks

481
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,500
But yeah, maybe we'll get to go to e3. I need to do more secret things

482
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:27,940
It's like really. Hey, I'm doing something I can't talk about. I

483
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:31,400
Need to do more secret stuff

484
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:35,440
Please don't shoot me. Wow, that was an amazing shot

485
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:42,460
Too bad. He didn't kill me. Yeah total biscuit

486
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:47,539
Yeah, I forget their names. There's three like super super famous guys that are gonna be casting it on twitch

487
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:53,300
I don't know their names though. I know total biscuit. That's it. Well, it doesn't matter. I just did a good rocket show

488
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:55,699
That's all that matters

489
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:58,480
here

490
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,480
What what why am I on fire?

491
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,199
What look at this what's going on? I can't look at this. Why am I on fire right now?

492
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:08,760
What is that? I'm in a booth. I

493
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,079
Pulled up the dead ringer and I oh

494
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:19,429
that was I think I just had like a brain fought right there cuz I pulled the dead ring around when he lit me and

495
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:22,789
It worked and then it instantly why did I come out of it? Do you hear the noise?

496
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:24,789
It was like oh I came out of the dead ringer

497
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,949
But I didn't I was still in it

498
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:30,539
It is not Renaissance heroes

499
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,659
Is orb even online? I'm just gonna like ask him if I can like talk about it

500
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,360
Can I be like, hey, can I tell people what I'm doing?

501
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,860
Where's it illegal?

502
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:52,150
Yeah, we're very cool for us to

503
00:45:52,909 --> 00:45:57,840
Hey, I'm gonna go off spy. I'm too stupid right now to go to play anything else

504
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:07,030
Say hello to your Spaniard viewers. Hello everybody in Spain. Hope you guys are spending good in that Spaniard land

505
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:13,889
The cool part is I want to go to you three. That's like the main thing

506
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:18,610
Is it me? I could really care less about like winning the whole thing. How is you I?

507
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,949
Could care less about winning like the whole thing

508
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:28,750
but I do it would be awesome to go to e3 because then I could make videos and stuff about going to e3 and

509
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:34,769
It'd be so much fun. Well, that was a Wow

510
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:47,599
I am sorry to every single person here that just got covered in that Girardi. That was my fault. Well, I'm got quick fixed

511
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:52,099
What am I doing? I gotta get up here. What are you doing? Oh

512
00:46:54,619 --> 00:47:01,460
Dang and

513
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:08,489
Oh, I hear the Christmas bells

514
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,570
Need ammo, I probably will do more morning streams

515
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:27,389
We're not really morning streams, but early afternoon streams on Sunday

516
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:32,969
Just because I know that Saturday night can a lot of people can't watch it

517
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,690
And I am sorry about that

518
00:47:37,409 --> 00:47:43,650
Oh

519
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:50,219
Every time I see somebody in the air. I always think it's you and I get scared

520
00:47:52,929 --> 00:47:55,550
Every time every time somebody's

521
00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:02,429
Oh, it's any time you're in a anyone's in the air I keep thinking it's you and it freaks me out

522
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:13,400
It's perfect

523
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:21,159
Spawn to spawn belly to belly the bum for jumbo

524
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:29,719
Spawn to spawn belly to belly. You know what that's from back to back belly to belly. I think it's from where

525
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:35,179
Where in the world is Carmen San Diego? I really think it is the game show the old game show

526
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,719
Somebody please look that up. Somebody find that out for me right now. I

Not anymore though. You sound fine now. Okay, good

536
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:31,880
Now have I killed one person this like entire time, how do I have 18 points?

537
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:39,320
What what did I do? Did I kill anybody? I guess so. I don't even like remember killing anyone. I

538
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:47,679
Did a jump I did Joe my mommy was proud

539
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:57,079
Well, I got up my cat is like scratching the door. I probably have

540
00:49:57,639 --> 00:50:00,960
One of if not the most annoying cats in the world

541
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:09,090
See he knows my window when it's open, he knows he can come over and annoy me by just going like

542
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:15,329
Until I come let him in and if I don't let him in he will sit there

543
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:20,329
He probably wouldn't even eat or sleep until I let him in like through like the window

544
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:27,409
Yeah, you kidding and it's like, you know, there's another way you can go right that you can't get in my window

545
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:29,809
He just knows I'll let him in

546
00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:32,699
Always leave it open

547
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:34,699
Hmm. So what time is right now?

548
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:43,010
That's the real question. I don't know probably another round or two on

549
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:47,650
TF and I think I'm gonna transition to some Diablo free

550
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:56,090
Diablo some Diablo cuz I gotta get my witch doctor up in

551
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,250
You know, I think we're still the same

552
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:09,619
45 I did level up a bit. Hold on a second. Are there there's not random crits on right now, is there? No

553
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:17,760
Was that it cuz that guy that guy was uber charged. He wasn't crits create. That was weird. I got killed by a crit

554
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,960
Yeah, you know, no, no, no, no, you know, it probably was like a fuck banner. That peepee probably was the peepee banner

555
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:26,579
Keep banner that I'm gonna get headshot. Oh

556
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:31,980
My god, you both just like came in at the same time and I missed

557
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:38,650
Let's go. Yeah

558
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,289
Let's go

559
00:51:41,289 --> 00:51:48,280
No, no, no, no with that thing what Tommy's left? Yeah. How do you aim?

560
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:56,849
I love the Thomas love. It's my favorite. It's too hard

561
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:05,019
Aiming is hard. Yeah star does make rocket jumping look so much fun

562
00:52:05,019 --> 00:52:08,059
He also makes it look really easy too, and it is absolutely not

563
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:19,900
One of the best videos I've ever seen of Team Fortress 2 is that video where you jumped to do

564
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:26,880
Where you jumped across like the whole thing a high tower and man-treaded some pyro it was unbelievable

565
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,000
I wasn't even that good. Oh, it was the don't even know

566
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,300
When I finally put all these park gardener kills together

567
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:40,420
Well, when you finally put this bark garden thing together, I I it's probably gonna get like 700 million views. It's gonna be that good

568
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:51,280
The bomb is mirroring a checkpoint. All right. Oh

569
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:54,619
Man, hey you did

570
00:52:55,139 --> 00:53:00,579
Somebody wrote I can't believe I'm watching a YouTube stream. That's working

571
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:02,480
Yeah

572
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:09,679
There yeah, YouTube streams are well, they're in beta. So there is always gonna be a lot of problems

573
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:18,110
But you know, whatever it's all good. And who's the other guy that is star? I'm a guy

574
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:23,199
That is STA our star. Thank you for spelling it

575
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,000
I

576
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:42,159
Somebody write stars channel in the in the in the comment section just so the people that don't know will know

577
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:49,079
It's youtube.com slash niched

578
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,269
ni

579
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,389
I see HTS, right? Yes

580
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,789
Usually I'm pretty bad

581
00:53:57,789 --> 00:54:04,179
So I know you're gonna win this tournament because I'm guaranteeing it's a spelling bee. That's why I don't want to talk about it. Oh

582
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:07,610
My god get out of it

583
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:12,159
Just on your head. Oh, it's so scary. I

584
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:19,559
Like don't know like what to do it. There's like spies this rocket garden ring stars and

585
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:26,570
This other guy that's like another star. It's doing it. I'm like a heavy. I don't have any points

586
00:54:27,489 --> 00:54:29,489
Just saw that guy get smoked. Oh

587
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:34,199
Here's a pro like a pro tip pro tip as heavy on car

588
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:38,679
If you're being a cart heavy do it do the crouch dance. You got to go like do do do do do

589
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,679
Do you do you do you gotta like crouch grouch grout grout?

590
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:47,400
You gotta be gonna win because I I think I've convinced my team not to try it all off

591
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,400
You see like the pyro walking out there

592
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:52,119
We're taking it easy

593
00:54:57,469 --> 00:55:10,679
Cart heavy is fun. Yeah, okay. It is cart heavy spot how to jump is cart heavy

594
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,179
You got to get the new rocket launcher for the heavy. Yeah

595
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,820
the best you could do is like

596
00:55:17,179 --> 00:55:19,179
Yeah gloves of running urgently jumps

597
00:55:19,659 --> 00:55:22,780
Here we go ready. That's I'll show you how to rocket jump as a heavy

598
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,860
See look at how far I just went. Oh

599
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,480
No, I'm almost out of my lodge

600
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,159
Dunkin Donuts fresh-brewed iced tea. That's not a good thing

601
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:44,929
Get another I have to drive to Dunkin Donuts. I wish I'd said the Dunkin Donuts in my house. Yes

602
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:51,199
Get a Dunkin Donuts just buy a franchise just own it just so you can live in it. I

603
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,449
Would I would if that there if I had a house

604
00:55:56,170 --> 00:56:01,989
Think I'm not even really a big coffee drinker as I'd love iced tea and their iced tea is really really really good. Oh

605
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,320
Dear God chaos

606
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:22,159
Maybe I should shoot some things. I think I'm gonna shoot some things. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got I got a ghost recon

607
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,199
They gave me hats

608
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:30,760
Ghost recon. Yes. So now the classes I'm allowed to play insist of rocket jumping soldier or one of the classes that got a hat

609
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:39,530
Is that game any good he played it's not out yet. It's out in like a week. Oh, it's looking really good

610
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:41,969
Yeah, I heard it's supposed to be pretty

611
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:46,329
Your hints they're going a different like direction, aren't they? Whoa

612
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:51,610
It's kind of funny that a ghost recon is I love the first one

613
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:57,929
Mm-hmm, and they have dumbed down the series a lot since then and usually that would like piss me off to no end

614
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:01,050
But for some reason this time I'm glad ghost recon is dumber

615
00:57:01,929 --> 00:57:08,119
Because what was the one game? I'm happy about that. It's dumber. It wasn't wasn't the ghost recon series very very strategic

616
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,679
Like I had a very stuff or planning groups and this one

617
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:16,719
I mean it has all of that but for the most part, you know, it's not gonna happen, right, right

618
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:19,940
It's kind of like TF2

619
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:30,050
Hmm. So when I watch like trailers over those things reminds me of Gears of War a little bit like that kind of it's like third person

620
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,969
Yeah, it's not that third person vibe to it

621
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:35,329
It's definitely it has like all the wall hugging mechanics that gears would have

622
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:40,869
But I don't know. I actually wanted this game since they first started showing single-player trailers of it

623
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:46,039
But multiplayer looks pretty fun. I love fun things

624
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,059
Yeah, definitely

625
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:52,719
Fun stuff. I throw to peepee

626
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:04,690
Alright, we'll do I cannot get on that car. What am I doing? Why did I just pull that out? I'm gonna die

627
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:11,250
Why what about what do I have this awful not fists of steel? I need to put

628
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:17,380
Dermot you keep running in a circle. I know

629
00:58:19,059 --> 00:58:21,059
That's what happens when I live stream

630
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:28,179
My two centers of my brain fight for dominance and like I then I just like walk about in circle what happened

631
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,210
Now we get a wrangled

632
00:58:32,769 --> 00:58:34,769
Century that is yikes

633
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:38,650
Like that's a spy. Oh

634
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:40,190
I

635
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,750
Missed my melee swing because I was in his body

636
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:48,679
Where's this other guy? Wait sandwich take it eat it. Yeah

637
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:55,309
Come this way. Come this way. I'm gonna go up. We're gonna go up top and

638
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,239
Oh

639
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,980
Get on the car

640
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:09,659
And come on somebody touch it. Oh, I should have stayed behind it

641
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:15,280
Yeah, but you didn't you know, I'm stupid

642
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:22,539
It's a one more round after this and then we'll move on to some do I have below three? Okay

643
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:31,039
Take that

644
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:41,960
I should have ready. That's it. No, it's not. Oh my I should have given a sandwich my poor medic friend

645
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,599
No

646
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:54,030
That was essentially a warning new rank

647
00:59:57,349 --> 01:00:03,440
I'm sufficient kind of lethal. It's good. Oh

648
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:09,960
God spy a

649
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:12,469
spa

650
01:00:12,469 --> 01:00:14,469
yes, this will be on YouTube in

651
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:20,429
When I finish the stream, it'll probably be up there after maybe an hour to a processing. So

652
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:23,809
We assume what time is it right now?

653
01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:28,969
It is nine thirty a.m. For me probably stream for another couple hours or so at least another hour

654
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,090
and

655
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:34,199
It should be up by maybe noon ish. Maybe

656
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,679
That's what it says about I talked to some people and they said that apparently that's not true. That's not the case

657
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,280
Yeah, I guess there's a lie to you

658
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:50,119
It's like oh you can't you can't upload a automatic stream longer than two hours and then people do it

659
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:55,320
So I don't know. I guess they would want to discourage everyone. I don't know. Yeah, it's weird

660
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:59,480
It's very weird

661
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:05,170
Someone said since when is her blur go a warning her blur

662
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:11,619
It is yeah, I could be seen as a warning. Well, what else do you think I'm gonna do if I'm screaming that?

663
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:19,000
I'm either on the toilet or about to kill you. Oh man. They have too many things going on in there. Watch out buddy

664
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:28,139
Yeah, you take the sandwich. You need it you eat sandwich. I'm we gotta go. I gotta go around

665
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:35,690
It's all about is it they only have a mini century man

666
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:41,090
We're getting pushed back by a mini century and like a bunch of devil man. Oh god. I'm so dead. Oh god

667
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:46,989
Why do I not have these out somebody asked? All right, here we go. Here we go

668
01:01:47,630 --> 01:02:01,519
There we go. Come on. Come on. Somebody help me. I shot you with my gun

669
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:09,070
It was a bomb gun a bomb gun. Is that new? Yeah, I hope I get it

670
01:02:11,909 --> 01:02:14,929
I am really believe all don't know

671
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:19,789
I'm probably not gonna switch servers for some of you guys asking only because stars in here and

672
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,510
I wouldn't want it to be like oh, we both can't get into the same server and plus I'm on my server

673
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:29,360
So I like playing on my server because I like playing with the dudes on my server because they're cool

674
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:35,960
So one more we say let's go to

675
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:43,619
No, no, no, no, no, let's go to good old gold rush. Oh, please. No

676
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,469
All right, fine. We find out

677
01:02:47,949 --> 01:02:55,610
Well, I'm trying to like figure out how to like do something fun. Ah

678
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:03,510
No, I slapped you I got you. You need to rapid-fire that. Oh you can do that

679
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:07,849
Yeah, if you just keep mashing the button you can get slapped so much it like pops you up in the air

680
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:15,940
You there. All right, let's go. Oh, you're gonna be mad, but I kind of want to play on Turbine

681
01:03:18,219 --> 01:03:23,420
No, it's not as long as I don't know. I just want to jump in turbine. I

682
01:03:24,019 --> 01:03:27,150
guess

683
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:29,519
Turbine has stairs. I

684
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:36,119
Just love Turbine. I love a lot of things. Don't I should have played two for two for it?

685
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,730
But turbines like the good two for it, isn't it? No two for it is the best two for it

686
01:03:47,199 --> 01:04:01,710
No, a two for it is the best two for it. I'll stick with demo night. Oh, it's my spray. Ah

687
01:04:02,429 --> 01:04:05,150
German oh

688
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:14,070
Everyone now hates you Gary monster. Look what you did what I do what I do what happened what I do

689
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,989
You picked this map. So

690
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:21,400
There's a ceiling on this map

691
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:27,599
There's nowhere that does not have a ceiling. Yeah, but you could do like an off-the-wall kind of like move. Okay?

692
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,510
Yeah

693
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:40,000
Yeah, I don't know I'll ask him star you're gonna play Diablo 3 as well. Yeah sure. Yeah, sure

694
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:41,980
Yeah, sure

695
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,300
T Milan

696
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,480
Okay. Oh, I hear a dog. I think that might be my dog

697
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:58,550
My dog. Oh my god a sentry

698
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:02,590
Strategy to turbine hold mid win game. Oh

699
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:11,670
How are you still here to overheal makes sense? Oh, okay. Damn it. I I

700
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:16,130
Was trying I was gonna go for a top kill and I'm gonna walk into corner

701
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:23,820
Why is this response so long I changed that

702
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:29,800
It's respawner way. It's respawn time right change the respawn on turbine. You can't

703
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,969
It's to turbine. Come on

704
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:40,070
You could change the respawn easy cat. I don't know. I have my respawn wave time at 2

705
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,989
And that's supposed to be god crits

706
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:49,639
I thought I was gonna bite my ankles in a second. He's probably gonna run here

707
01:05:55,619 --> 01:06:05,940
Oh, come on, I want my crits. Oh my crits let grandpa play Diablo. I don't think he would get it

708
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:07,940
I think he'd be too confused

709
01:06:08,659 --> 01:06:12,360
Because there's too many numbers to deal with in Diablo. You don't just like shoot people

710
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:16,679
Well, that's why they made numbers off by default and no advanced tooltips

711
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:20,179
People like him what just happened?

712
01:06:20,699 --> 01:06:26,710
All right, so I charged with the charge and charge and right when I clicked right click

713
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:31,309
I got backstabbed and my body just like baseball slid across like the whole map. I

714
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:36,570
Love getting backstabbed or right as you rocket jump and your body just poof

715
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:52,800
Okay, what do you say let me find some dude to run into here there's a mini sentry

716
01:06:54,449 --> 01:06:58,119
Mmm help me. I'm real I swear

717
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,820
That's a sticky

718
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:06,610
Mm-hmm. That's me getting shot hide right here. Shh. I know a secret

719
01:07:09,579 --> 01:07:19,460
And then you just what what I I was gonna work on my secret technique and 20 seconds. Hold on a minute. Oh

720
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:24,070
Actually, I was about to type in the server password

721
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:29,190
Like hold on. Let me just like type my Archon password right now in front of like 400 people

722
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:31,750
Okay, that would be a bad idea

723
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:39,630
20 that's too long 20 seconds. It's supposed to be like 9

724
01:07:40,429 --> 01:07:49,780
Come here. There's turbine. Oh

725
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,940
Why how did knock back?

726
01:07:52,099 --> 01:07:59,599
Get over here. It is morning. It is 9 just about 10 a.m. Here in the East Coast

727
01:08:00,219 --> 01:08:12,900
United States. Oh, I've got I thought it. Oh, yeah, we had like 2% health left 10% 20, whatever

728
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:24,399
I killed a guy. This is why we can't have nice things

729
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:30,340
Please German just please one two for it. I

730
01:08:31,699 --> 01:08:34,579
Think two Ford is is maybe I took it out of the rotation

731
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:39,859
Alright, how about this before I leave? I will switch the map to two for it. How does that sound?

732
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,819
That does not sound good. Yeah, but this guy does. Oh

733
01:08:47,449 --> 01:08:49,449
Okay, I did not know that was coming

734
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:52,590
Yeah, he was too busy hitting me

735
01:08:52,630 --> 01:09:00,130
Remember if you crouch and just stand still when you're in a melee fight one-on-one

736
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:08,079
Probably gonna win because people freak out too much they run around they go. What is this and hey open that door? Whoa?

737
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,739
I'm going to get the intelligence. You know what screw this. Oh

738
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:15,479
Never mind. He already got it. Good job scout

739
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,920
Good job, dude

740
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,310
You type 25 comments and haven't gotten a cheeseburger yet

741
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:29,590
So I think there's a YouTube bug you should have already gotten at least three cheeseburgers dispensed from your laptop reading or just

742
01:09:29,949 --> 01:09:32,750
Chat the stream. How do you do that?

743
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:36,590
It's an uh

744
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:42,390
It's just you make it. Oh, I'm sorry. I can't speak too much stuff going on

745
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,430
You uh, you just do

746
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:49,829
Update comments automatically and they'll come in as they come in. I

747
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:55,159
Think there's still like a minute or so behind though. That's the thing with YouTube

748
01:09:55,819 --> 01:09:57,819
This isn't even pro turbine

749
01:09:57,939 --> 01:09:59,859
There's no banana

750
01:09:59,859 --> 01:10:01,579
pro turbine

751
01:10:01,579 --> 01:10:05,319
Yeah, I'm pro turbine. There's a banana

752
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,199
Is it really?

753
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:12,850
Well, they call it banana, but it's like a different path on the side. It's shaped like a banana

754
01:10:13,529 --> 01:10:18,180
Yeah, you should you should get a double cheeseburger should come out of your

755
01:10:18,819 --> 01:10:21,819
out of your CD tray

756
01:10:21,819 --> 01:10:28,829
Every 25 comments that you make on the stream a double cheeseburger from your favorite

757
01:10:29,289 --> 01:10:34,369
Restaurant comes out of your CD tray. I don't have a CD tray. That's probably why it's not working

758
01:10:34,369 --> 01:10:38,569
Yeah, if you don't have a CD tray or a zip drive to you have to have like a zip drive. Oh

759
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,600
God

760
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,199
Why am I still equipped? Why is it still out? Why do I still have this out? What am I doing?

761
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,079
Can't believe I got away with that. Oh my god. I can't believe we got away with that either. Oh

762
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:01,000
That was a brigade oh

763
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:03,199
I'm at the end of my drink. You know what that means

764
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:11,399
It's time to this thing is like floating. What the hell your cheeseburger had blue cheese

765
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,819
Sounds pretty dang good

766
01:11:13,819 --> 01:11:21,979
All right star you ready I got a question for you. Oh god, what is

767
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,100
One more round we'll do one more

768
01:11:26,539 --> 01:11:28,539
Please please

769
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:37,260
All right, fine. We'll switch. All right. We'll go to start a star. What map do you want to play them jump tricks?

770
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:42,409
You want to play the jump map? I don't even think I have it installed

771
01:11:44,779 --> 01:11:55,539
All right, it needs to be like in like the team fortress database thinking like frontier

772
01:11:56,689 --> 01:11:58,689
Frontier and

773
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:00,729
Here we go

774
01:12:00,729 --> 01:12:07,239
Your cheeseburger had a green bun. Well, that's definitely if you're gonna ask me a thing

775
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:10,399
Oh, yeah, I forgot the thing. I was gonna ask you

776
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:20,619
Probably was really really important. Yeah one round of frontier and that'll end the team fortress for the day

777
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,140
Then it will bond Diablo 3 for a little while

778
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:32,460
I was trying to think of good stock payload maps that aren't upward and my mind just blanked and I said frontier

779
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:44,039
All right, what do you mean red or red or blue better? Let's go. Let's go blue go blue

780
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:46,199
I'm gonna play medic

781
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:52,239
Because I kind of feel like it. I like this setup. I'm gonna stick with it

782
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:59,850
Except I don't want the crits create a gadget. I want the default Medigun. There we go

783
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:05,819
You gotta keep control of your TVs. You have snipers hump in the door

784
01:13:08,659 --> 01:13:11,189
Spray

785
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:18,739
mission begins in

786
01:13:18,979 --> 01:13:22,899
500 seconds that would be nice

787
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:27,899
There's a sign out here that says speed limit 15

788
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,760
speed limit 15

789
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:41,699
Five

790
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:50,659
Thirty so have you guys been able to hear the in-game audio like the explosions and stuff

791
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:56,180
Or is that been too low? I'm always so afraid to turn that up because I feel like it's gonna overpower everything I said

792
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:06,760
I think I'm gonna get crits, which is perfect because then how could I possibly miss a market card?

793
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:17,050
All right, who am I gonna give this to? I don't even know we'll go with the

Come on. Give me another uber. Oh god two spies. That's not gonna work

810
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:55,399

01:15:55,439 --> 01:16:00,819

No, stay alive this guy. Oh my god. You were about to die. Oh

814
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,619
I'd use it. I didn't want that was really early

815
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:23,810
I'm ashamed to say I know you this guy. Oh, yeah. Well, look what we just did

816
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:26,449
We just came like that

817
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:28,409
We did a good job

818
01:16:28,409 --> 01:16:33,109
Well, I saw this guy only had like 1% health and if I didn't use it

819
01:16:33,109 --> 01:16:35,229
He would have died and it was only me and a sniper behind him. So

820
01:16:35,949 --> 01:16:40,390
When will the next grandpa video be uploaded? It was uploaded last night

821
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:44,229
Machinima respawn. It's on the featured video list. Go check it out

822
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:52,500
Actually to be honest, I'm sorry. I didn't even I didn't even let anybody know that was there

823
01:16:52,659 --> 01:16:55,140
I'll do that today after this is over. Oh

824
01:17:01,789 --> 01:17:07,670
This is bad the tension

825
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:15,449
I guess I do have two kills. No, come here mark. Let me hear you. Oh

826
01:17:19,579 --> 01:17:21,460
backed up into a knife

827
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:28,119
somebody wants me to say a

828
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:36,489
Dirty word hidden do it. It's hidden in like a regular sentence. I know that I know that trick

829
01:17:36,649 --> 01:17:38,489
That's a dirty trick

830
01:17:38,489 --> 01:17:46,500
If your chat is frozen try and re refresh the page

831
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,300
reexec

832
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,300
Really? What do you say? Really? What?

833
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:54,869
reexec the config

834
01:17:55,270 --> 01:18:02,100
I need help. I need you to heal me, please. Oh

835
01:18:06,539 --> 01:18:08,539
This thing is so good. I love this thing

836
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:13,439
Doesn't seem like much what the overdose doesn't seem like much but it is

837
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:24,130
It really helps in situations a lot of situations at all. It's not that much it is though, but you need

838
01:18:24,729 --> 01:18:26,600
boot solider

839
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,520
Yeah, but then you start to take damage like you you don't get the full plus three. Yeah

840
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,520
Well, you just have to make sure you hit every needle

841
01:18:33,079 --> 01:18:36,000
But that's too hard and you are gonna land right on my face

842
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,239
Now if you're gonna back up like a punk not gonna

843
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:42,380
Like what you don't want to die

844
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:53,970
See look, I'm running fast. I'm gonna back up like a punk. All right. I'm going for a team over right there

845
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:57,850
We're looking at we gotta push up. It's not it's not gonna be a single man effort right now. Oh

846
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:02,500
No, oh did I just totally block you from that? I

847
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:11,189
Actually apologize if I did I probably missed anyway, I'm missing like every swing

848
01:19:11,869 --> 01:19:13,869
giving you per sauce

849
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:23,369
No, I don't want him to die that's a spy that's a spy that's a spy it definitely is no it's not

850
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:41,439
You know this thing be careful. I thought that was I know not that anything but the little full caver

851
01:19:43,939 --> 01:19:48,130
Anything with the evil caper miss out. Come here. Don't run away. Oh

852
01:19:53,609 --> 01:19:55,609
Everybody needs help and there's nothing like oh

853
01:19:56,529 --> 01:20:03,699
Don't die. There's a guy behind you. I'll push that up

854
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:06,489
Oh, yeah

855
01:20:06,489 --> 01:20:12,250
Get on this. How is this mini century? Oh, I'm dead. Goodbye. Goodbye cruel world

856
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:19,729
You got chicken out of the tray. That's that's not supposed to happen

857
01:20:20,289 --> 01:20:26,600
There's only supposed to be cheeseburgers meat and cheese the ketchup onion mustard

858
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:37,550
Relish why am I going this way? I always do that on upward. I always go the wrong way upward support the little guy

859
01:20:37,949 --> 01:20:40,960
hashtag that's my

860
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:43,659
philosophy and

861
01:20:43,659 --> 01:20:47,909
Apparently grandpa you sentry set up and you guys have a lot of stuff over there

862
01:20:48,029 --> 01:20:51,779
You don't even know yet because it's set up like four miles away

863
01:20:52,260 --> 01:21:02,979
You need a time to prepare and put it in a really really lame century spot. So name for that lame

864
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,510
name

865
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:07,510
Everything's name. I

866
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:29,199
Backed up into another knife backed up back it up. That's the way

867
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:34,800
You are up top there and I'm gonna die

868
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,439
Man, these spies are really making me paranoid

869
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:44,220
There's like forty hundred of them. I mean to

870
01:21:44,899 --> 01:21:49,640
This one back here somewhere. Oh, there is

871
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:57,390
Well, I was gonna heal that guy too. My god. I

872
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:05,050
Am NOT turning my back. I'm gonna face this way the whole time. See I knew it get out of that

873
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:07,689
Oh overdose you are my friend

874
01:22:08,409 --> 01:22:10,210
It's all in your mind

875
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:14,029
Yeah, but even if it is on my mind, it's still still makes me get that extra mile

876
01:22:14,609 --> 01:22:17,729
In your mind. Oh

877
01:22:19,909 --> 01:22:25,789
My god, I can't heal y'all Ryan. All right, let's push this thing

878
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:44,369
Somebody get up there. Somebody get up there. There we go. There we go. There we go

879
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:47,010
push little wagon

880
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:56,069
Prepared for lame century. Are you mentally ready for this?

881
01:22:58,489 --> 01:23:00,489
Is there like a bunch of there?

882
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:04,369
That's all right. It's all right spy. I got you. I got you

883
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:08,050
I'll make sure you have a nice thick overheal

884
01:23:08,569 --> 01:23:13,170
By the time you get out of here and by the time I'm not afraid to leave which is right now

885
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:21,369
There's a lot of people there. Oh

886
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:33,550
No, no, no, heal me. Heal me, please. Oh damn it bomb gun. Ah

887
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:50,600
That was pretty nice run though. I I'm proud of that little run proud people say you should try to pan me

888
01:23:52,029 --> 01:23:58,850
I am missing every single market garden. Oh, that was a glitch

889
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:15,770
That's why that's not why it looks like he's running slower. That was weird. We got you

890
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:21,359
I gotta get up move up move up. No, come here

891
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:26,420
That gear up. Oh, is our century gun?

892
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:37,029
Damn leave it is we got three medics to we should be pushing this car like crazy. You need 14 heavies

893
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:42,109
We only have one and there was there's a spy right there that pyro. I'm waiting for him to come over here

894
01:24:42,729 --> 01:24:45,170
My yeah, here's no head either. Where's this head?

895
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:49,449
Where's this guy's head? Yeah, I've been noticing that a lot lately. Is that just on spies?

896
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:54,930
Yeah, if a spy disguises as a pyro when they're wearing a certain hat, it can't display the hat. Oh

897
01:24:55,569 --> 01:24:59,569
Or something like that. Oh god. I that guy just ubered at the same time as me

898
01:25:00,609 --> 01:25:04,289
We just both over the same guy at the same time

899
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:10,819
Yeah, I'm going I'm going for it. I'm going for some not so stuff right here

900
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,859
What I'm sniper because we had none. No, we have three

901
01:25:14,539 --> 01:25:21,239
Now this is a higher number that guy only needed one hit and I didn't get it

902
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:30,340
What movies were films my planet on scene?

903
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:36,600
Probably I still haven't seen the Avengers. I have to see the Avengers

904
01:25:37,119 --> 01:25:40,930
Have you seen that star? Yep. Is it was it good?

905
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:46,430
Yes, I know it's good because there's explosions

906
01:25:46,869 --> 01:25:51,270
But I had like a two hour long conversation with someone about why it's terrible really

907
01:25:52,069 --> 01:25:57,479
Just nothing makes sense if you watch it you need to question everything that happens and say why is this happening?

908
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,119
And you will realize you don't know

909
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:08,479
Nobody knows the Avengers. I don't really watch a whole lot of movies to be honest

910
01:26:09,529 --> 01:26:14,180
Dark night. Yeah, that's definitely one. I mean yeah hat you have to see that though

911
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:21,250
That's pretty much. They beat you. It's pretty much a moral obligation for every human being to watch the Christopher Nolan Batman movies

912
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,250
like please

913
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,739
You know, you're bring a spy yeah, hey I know I

914
01:26:30,859 --> 01:26:32,859
Am aware of that. I realized that like about

915
01:26:33,579 --> 01:26:36,899
Two or three seconds into that over. I just thought I'd let you know

916
01:26:36,899 --> 01:26:37,260
Yeah

917
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:41,840
I realized because I realized especially when he ran the other direction when I ubered him and he turned left

918
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:45,899
And they went backwards. I was like wait a dip fights that way. What are you doing?

919
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:50,340
You could just have uber phobia

920
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:59,520
Good. Do I read any books? I do not don't really actually I take that back. I

921
01:27:00,279 --> 01:27:05,319
Read some time. I read like graphic novels does that count? Oh?

922
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:09,189
That does not count, but there's words in there. Let's just look ones

923
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:12,310
Duck to Naples that makes good ones. Oh

924
01:27:14,569 --> 01:27:27,039
Dog to Naples makes great great graphic novels the earthworm Jim guy. Oh, I didn't know he did that

925
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:41,100
Yeah, they're pretty good. At least like the art is very very interesting really awesome. I got you. I got you ballin Colin

926
01:27:41,539 --> 01:27:51,550
You need help more than anybody. I'll make sure to get you. Oh my god

927
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:57,220
All right, you know what no more medic. It is pyro time want to see my backpack

928
01:27:57,859 --> 01:28:03,930
Here you go. It's kind of all over the place right now ever since I gave everything away

929
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:11,369
I don't have any more like cool hats okay. I should stop stop doing this and actually shoot bullets

930
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:23,640
Why I gotta take that teleporter am I doing spies

931
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:35,260
Spies have no match for the pyro and except sometimes

932
01:28:35,779 --> 01:28:39,130
No, don't don't don't don't don't don't oh

933
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:47,539
Come on. What did he even come from I have zero unusuals?

934
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,920
bad player

935
01:28:59,579 --> 01:29:01,579
Yeah, I don't know how you guys

936
01:29:01,819 --> 01:29:09,680
Aren't winning more well. We only have one minute. That's pretty much the end right there. Do I still like the gorillas?

937
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:14,619
Oh my god. Yes

938
01:29:14,619 --> 01:29:19,710
Gorillas are the best band like ever. We're not gonna win this

939
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:25,590
Too much too much good stuff happening on it as a center. We lost it's over

940
01:29:26,189 --> 01:29:31,649
It is over so in that in that case. You know you always got to do this. You're always gonna go spy

941
01:29:32,369 --> 01:29:34,140
the skies as

942
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:38,680
An enemy heavy or something. Well, you know I'm gonna play I'm gonna go scout just so I can run away

943
01:29:39,079 --> 01:29:48,170
I'm gonna take the coward way out. Why am I taking the teleporters? Let's go. So this is where we transition

944
01:29:48,409 --> 01:29:51,529
What oh wait, can we maybe you

945
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:01,819
Yeah, it's over it's over

946
01:30:02,699 --> 01:30:09,260
I'm gonna move on to some Diablo 3. Oh my god. Are we gonna find items or gold?

947
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:16,109
Hopefully gold cuz I need more. No, we've lost. Please. I hope I don't find any items

948
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:18,310
Oh

949
01:30:20,590 --> 01:30:22,590
Well, thanks guys for playing if you got in thank you

950
01:30:23,029 --> 01:30:27,949
And time to transition to Diablo 3 if you just came if you're wondering all but it's over though

951
01:30:27,949 --> 01:30:32,119
It's this is all gonna be on YouTube later on today. So yeah

952
01:30:33,079 --> 01:30:38,350
Thanks for playing dudes. Let's go on to Diablo 3. This is where we go

953
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:41,989
disconnect

954
01:30:41,989 --> 01:30:43,189
quit

955
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:49,039
Yes, we're all do you sure? I don't know. I have replays. I don't want to lose. It's now

956
01:30:50,649 --> 01:30:52,170
Diablo flee

957
01:30:52,170 --> 01:31:00,579
Super Monday night combat. I've it's I

958
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:05,300
Can't I can't get into it. It's I don't know what it is. I'm not sure

959
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:10,140
I have a couple of friends now that are really starting to enjoy it, but I just can't I don't know why

960
01:31:10,579 --> 01:31:15,420
They did just add a new game mode, which is weird. It's kind of like realism

961
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:18,579
I guess where everybody dies quicker

962
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:26,420
Really? Yeah, I just I need to get into it at some point. Maybe I'm not sure yet

963
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:30,579
But is this even in the right spot? I think it is not quite. Hold on

964
01:31:30,579 --> 01:31:35,520
I'm gonna screens gotta go black for him second dudes

965
01:31:36,119 --> 01:31:40,159
You can even rocket jump in that game and I still don't like it that much

966
01:31:41,489 --> 01:31:47,069
So, I don't know what else there could be to encourage me to play

967
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:51,550
Maybe hats. Oh

968
01:31:52,109 --> 01:31:59,039
There are hats then. Yeah, that's a good way to play screen region. Yeah, three

969
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:04,539
That

970
01:32:04,539 --> 01:32:13,770
You know, you can stream with DX story and it's better in screen region. Really? Yeah. Whoa stream section. Oh my god

971
01:32:16,109 --> 01:32:20,659
Do you use the x-tory? Oh, yeah. Yeah you do. Yeah, I do. I don't stream with it though

972
01:32:20,819 --> 01:32:27,199
You should oh my good God every time I try to bring a stupid window right now. It'll be magic

973
01:32:27,399 --> 01:32:30,699
All right. I'm gonna try this in one more time because this is being ridiculous

974
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:35,340
Okay

975
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:41,760
Streamception mania that was just like I felt like I was looking through a tunnel right there that might like I'm gonna like puke

976
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:53,689
Okay, love of everything that is sacred. Can we get this in the right spot? Yes, DX story telling you but DX story is

977
01:32:54,840 --> 01:33:07,460
Expensive. No, okay. That's good enough. Good enough. Good enough. All right. Nobody likes steal my password

978
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:22,560
Stolen hacked nobody steal my stuff because I have like I have like really good stuff. No, I don't. All right

979
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,359
I'm on nightmare. Oh, you like my my like witch doctor name

980
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:36,869
Burglar he's the burglar and you and I in a game. I'm not in a game. I'm on axe 3 nightmare

981
01:33:38,039 --> 01:33:44,739
No, that's I'm further than that. Well, you have to come help me. Okay, you have to

982
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:47,380
Okay

983
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:51,539
Are you sure you don't want to just kill asthma and 4,000 times? That's what I think

984
01:33:52,619 --> 01:33:57,739
We're gonna make this game where you don't have to run the same bosses over and over again

985
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:04,270
Then we're gonna make asthma and give you all the experience every single cent of experience

986
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:10,420
I want in my bank account. So for hold on I gotta get over like the Diablo 3 lag for the first two minutes

987
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:14,619
I'm just like doing random moves. I wonder I you know, there's got to be a reason why that happens

988
01:34:14,859 --> 01:34:21,760
It has to be because it's syncing you up with like the DRM or something like that has to be I don't know

989
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,960
But you need to invite me. That's right

990
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:33,020
Invite to the party. Yeah, and now I'm gonna reject it

991
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:36,859
But please be my friend

992
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:48,300
The turd burglar I made his name burglar because of like burger boy

993
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,140
Yeah

994
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:59,479
Yeah, you gotta get rid of it. You gotta get rid of the initial lag of Diablo 3

995
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:04,960
Whoo-hoo. Hooray

996
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,060
All right. I think we can do it

997
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:16,340
Well, it's the the reason why it lags even when I'm not streaming when I'm just playing just by myself

998
01:35:16,579 --> 01:35:21,619
The first like two or three minutes every time you play Diablo 3 for some reason it just does

999
01:35:21,619 --> 01:35:26,380
It's do a new move and it's like wait. What is this? Yeah, you have to like what it load Diablo 3 or anything

1000
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:27,979
It's so it's sort of like Minecraft

1001
01:35:27,979 --> 01:35:32,560
That's like the only way I can really make an assumption to what it's kind of like, you know

1002
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,819
Minecraft is like when you first start playing it's like loading every single thing in the world. See like

1003
01:35:36,819 --> 01:35:38,819
No, I have to load all this stuff

1004
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:41,390
It'll even out in a minute. I promise

1005
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:53,260
You know, what's a good game

1006
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:57,020
Medium pizza medium a large cheese pizza. Yes

1007
01:35:59,739 --> 01:36:02,739
Let's go let's go with the lag

1008
01:36:07,739 --> 01:36:10,460
Alright, I want to get some Reyes and some uniques

1009
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:15,970
Well, people still people people are still seeing streamception. No, they're not in this

1010
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:28,449
Or is that just an old comment from somebody from a while back? I don't shoot arrows anymore. I'm taking what's going on people's thing

1011
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:29,850
They're seeing

1012
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:31,659
Shouldn't be

1013
01:36:31,659 --> 01:36:38,539
Let me watch my own stream make sure like nothing's happening. You should stream with your story

1014
01:36:38,539 --> 01:36:42,420
I gave the recommendation and I should stream the cops added

1015
01:36:42,979 --> 01:36:48,260
Teach you in two seconds every time I stream when I did the x-split game stream thing

1016
01:36:48,899 --> 01:36:56,500
For some reason I don't know why it like it lags. It lags really really terribly. Oh, no, we're not getting streamception

1017
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:06,699
Looks okay. What about 720? That looks okay, too. Okay, just making sure nothing was happening

1018
01:37:06,819 --> 01:37:10,970
It's probably the YouTube comment system like all slow and dumb

1019
01:37:11,489 --> 01:37:13,489
That's where it is probs

1020
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:24,779
So I I'm playing which doctor which doctor is very fun

1021
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:27,710
Very good. Very cool. I

1022
01:37:30,579 --> 01:37:32,579
Am shooting bombs

1023
01:37:32,859 --> 01:37:35,029
bombs

1024
01:37:35,029 --> 01:37:40,789
There's actually pretty cool build with demon hunter. I found out that we just regenerate hatred like ridiculous amounts of it

1025
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:43,390
You could use cluster our non-stop

1026
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:46,109
Really our is amazing

1027
01:37:46,149 --> 01:37:48,229
That's pretty cool. Pretty damn cool

1028
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:50,550
pretty snazzy

1029
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:52,229
pretty snazzy

1030
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:55,430
This guy's an elite in these

1031
01:37:55,789 --> 01:38:05,369
Did he killed my little buddy? Oh, he's back. Don't worry. I have a feeling maybe I shouldn't even be helping you. Why I

1032
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:07,489
Don't know. I've got

1033
01:38:07,489 --> 01:38:09,489
5300 damage it feels

1034
01:38:09,489 --> 01:38:10,609
wrong

1035
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:16,989
But I need the help get out of here

1036
01:38:18,189 --> 01:38:24,329
Already a rare really didn't think this one happened. I thought it was just gonna be the sea of blue, but I want one

1037
01:38:24,869 --> 01:38:27,699
What do I think of the spider-man reboot? I?

1038
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,460
think it's um

1039
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:36,819
It's not out. Well, I mean, I don't know I thought it was gonna be like a Christopher Nolan type reboot

1040
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:39,840
But it's kind of everything's like all CGI and stuff

1041
01:38:41,979 --> 01:38:44,409
I want to see it

1042
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:56,600
I'll probably watch it to be honest. I was a big spider-man fan. I loved the first movie second one was good, too

1043
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:59,710
I

1044
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:01,149
Don't get away

1045
01:39:01,149 --> 01:39:06,989
Hopefully this time they do anything with venom even later on hopefully he's not like a total d-bag

1046
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:10,409
anything like that

1047
01:39:10,409 --> 01:39:16,609
Venom I have a cool face and giant teeth, but I pull my mask back to talk

1048
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:21,850
Thanks. Yeah, I didn't really like the way they handled venom either. It was kind of lackluster

1049
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:28,130
I'm mad at you because you took my girlfriend or something. I don't remember what his deal was wasn't he also in

1050
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:34,409
The only in the movie for like 25 minutes the actual that I'm like symbiotic monster thing

1051
01:39:37,699 --> 01:39:41,619
And the way he beats him he's like oh you got a humiliating guy like that

1052
01:39:42,939 --> 01:39:47,729
Why are you gonna be like don't you are a good guy spider-man?

1053
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:58,449
You guys want to see my ruins. I'll give you a little look see

1054
01:39:59,170 --> 01:40:00,890
looksy-doo

1055
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:07,390
So this is poise. I'm using poison dart and fire bats and I have it so it's just pretty much pure damage

1056
01:40:07,869 --> 01:40:13,029
So take a look poison dart. I have it so it's and the the fire one

1057
01:40:13,029 --> 01:40:17,510
So just doesn't more just straight-up damage every time you hit somebody that is leveled up apparently oh

1058
01:40:18,189 --> 01:40:20,430
I'm sorry

1059
01:40:21,149 --> 01:40:27,239
Then fire bats. I have the poison ones actually I got a new one. I have ferrets hmm

1060
01:40:27,239 --> 01:40:29,399
I'll stick with the poison ones for now. I think

1061
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:36,159
Ferrets yeah, I got the gargantuan the one that goes crazy when there's more than a few people around

1062
01:40:37,079 --> 01:40:38,520
Yeah, I

1063
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,520
Got oh yeah

1064
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:46,199
Soul harvest because it is just too good to not have intelligence. Is it giving you now?

1065
01:40:47,399 --> 01:40:53,359
102 for every enemy affected so I get I can get a fire like 550 in intelligence if I get five people oh

1066
01:40:55,359 --> 01:41:01,600
It's a that's a lot mass confusion and then spirit walk mass confusion makes every than everyone hit themselves pretty much and

1067
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:08,760
Spirit walk is just amazing because it makes you pretty much unkillable. You just go like this you go whew and you run around

1068
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:10,960
Very very awesome

1069
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:16,399
So do you have ferrets? I don't know I don't have ferrets on let me turn on my

1070
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,909
There it's like this a little my GPU

1071
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:22,350
fan a little higher

1072
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:25,020
Yeah, okay

1073
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:27,399
Just to make sure

1074
01:41:27,399 --> 01:41:35,250
All right, we're gonna go we're gonna find this. This is the spider lady isn't it oh?

1075
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,420
Yeah

1076
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:49,340
She's down away still we missed her we missed her all right if you were just here for the TF2 then take it easy man

1077
01:41:49,539 --> 01:41:50,699
Thanks for coming

1078
01:41:50,699 --> 01:42:03,220
me this gold my ferrets they pick up gold for me do they really the most yeah the most important skill in the

1079
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:04,939
Game is pick up gold

1080
01:42:04,939 --> 01:42:10,840
That is a really important skill because you have to like go move over and run over and they increase gold fine

1081
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,600
Just for being ferrets

1082
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:14,600
Like I didn't know ferrets did that

1083
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,560
But they're rolling in it

1084
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:24,409
Rolling in those ferrets, so we went the wrong way

1085
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:30,779
Diablo 3 that's the name of the game in d3 going the wrong way

1086
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:33,060
It almost feels sometimes like

1087
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:38,859
It generates the map as you go somewhere they go people he went this way. Let's generate it

1088
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:42,800
So many little spider freaks oh god

1089
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,520
Come on go ahead go get him gargantuan

1090
01:42:47,199 --> 01:42:51,539
So though we were talking about the gargantuan that this little buddy that I have for a pet

1091
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:57,989
And we can't at the conclusion that this is what he's doing so I'll try and do the voice

1092
01:42:58,789 --> 01:43:01,479
I'll definitely get it through this fight

1093
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:07,149
They're ready, so this is look at how like cutie is

1094
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:10,710
So where are you just like right where's that?

1095
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:17,989
That's the noise he's making when he runs

1096
01:43:19,590 --> 01:43:22,750
To be actually right I hit this guy. I help you

1097
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:26,350
Out it hurts

1098
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:34,270
I just feel like he's just a big dumb cute, but I'm gonna die there's an elite right here. It's okay

1099
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:37,369
I'll hold you

1100
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:43,949
Confusion

1101
01:43:43,949 --> 01:43:46,340
Let's get a rare

1102
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:47,020
So yeah

1103
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:53,739
I thought I had a really cool skill that what could rival your mass confusion because it knocks everything back for like 10 seconds

1104
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:56,180
Really it doesn't work on rares

1105
01:43:56,899 --> 01:44:01,220
Really like all rares are immune to knock back. That's kind of BS

1106
01:44:01,779 --> 01:44:08,340
Yeah, I was kind of gonna. Go like all knock back demon hunter. There's Diablo 2 mm-hmm

1107
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:12,699
I probably still am but it's just kind of sucks that rares are gonna be like there

1108
01:44:12,939 --> 01:44:15,300
Okay, you might you might get one

1109
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:19,399
Back up a little bit

1110
01:44:19,399 --> 01:44:31,979
German can you make a shout out to edgyl like in the stream just say your name? What's up edgyl?

1111
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:37,810
Eggle

1112
01:44:37,810 --> 01:44:39,569
And go waffles

1113
01:44:39,569 --> 01:44:43,220
Yes, oh

1114
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:48,739
God, yes, please actually don't like waffles. I go. I know that's blasphemous. I know

1115
01:44:49,859 --> 01:44:52,300
Like Elgin waffles are better naturally I mean

1116
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:54,899
I

1117
01:44:54,899 --> 01:45:03,579
You know waffles are just too um it's almost like too much. It's too doughy ready for me same thing with pancakes

1118
01:45:03,579 --> 01:45:05,340
I'm not a big pancake person either

1119
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:11,439
Wow, I did not need to know that about you

1120
01:45:11,439 --> 01:45:17,649
I don't think anyone you just know that about you like everyone is leaving the stream right now

1121
01:45:18,369 --> 01:45:20,369
Because I said that

1122
01:45:20,569 --> 01:45:24,609
Well, what's the point of watching this if this guy doesn't even like pancakes I?

1123
01:45:25,609 --> 01:45:30,170
Thought we could like bond on some sort of human level, but apparently not

1124
01:45:31,449 --> 01:45:35,420
Thought we were gonna be friends

1125
01:45:35,659 --> 01:45:40,960
Why would I want to be friends with you now? I need help do I have any potions that I'm not using I?

1126
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:43,739
Gotta run back to town real quick

1127
01:45:43,739 --> 01:45:46,810
You don't like pancakes unsubbed

1128
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:51,460
No, I love pancakes come back. I resolved me joking

1129
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:54,380
You know I the only pancakes I like are

1130
01:45:55,899 --> 01:45:58,140
Chocolate chip pancakes, that's it

1131
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:05,619
Everything else I'm not a big fan of are you just like trying to run your name into the ground what chocolate chip pancakes are really good

1132
01:46:05,939 --> 01:46:07,739
What's wrong with that?

1133
01:46:07,739 --> 01:46:13,399
Chocolate chip pancakes this is a breakfast food. We were talking you want to put chocolate chips

1134
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:17,460
Would you put like chocolate chips and scrambled eggs and be like ah good idea?

1135
01:46:18,659 --> 01:46:22,760
Yeah, but scrimp eggs are like eggs. They're not like

1136
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:25,239
Pancakes are sweet

1137
01:46:25,239 --> 01:46:33,069
You know let me give you a rebuttal would you put cheese on your pancakes? I'm sure that wouldn't be that bad

1138
01:46:33,069 --> 01:46:35,390
I don't think so. I don't know about that

1139
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:38,310
What does cheese go badly with?

1140
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:43,909
Besides chocolate chips like a glass of chocolate milk if you like put easy cheese in it

1141
01:46:44,510 --> 01:46:46,750
Well besides anything chocolate

1142
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:54,039
Well when does chocolate go bad you just made my point for me

1143
01:46:54,720 --> 01:47:03,100
I'm trying to say chocolate doesn't go with anything. What is he just eat chocolate chocolate?

1144
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:09,520
Chocolate ice cream chocolate milkshake chocolate strawberries. Yeah, those are all but

1145
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:12,640
the point is

1146
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:18,989
I'm right. I just said I just had to go back to town again because I forgot I went here to buy potions and I didn't

1147
01:47:23,529 --> 01:47:25,489
chocolate chip pancakes

1148
01:47:25,489 --> 01:47:28,180
That's the best part about Diablo 3

1149
01:47:28,420 --> 01:47:31,560
Is what you time to consider the important parts of life

1150
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:36,079
There we weren't talking about this from playing tf2, but now we're down to the root

1151
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:40,720
Now we have a little it's a little more laid-back. We get some time to discuss things laid back

1152
01:47:41,319 --> 01:47:44,359
It's a little more laid-back. I would consider this more serious

1153
01:47:45,239 --> 01:47:53,960
This is so serious. It's Diablo here. I am clicking on things and you're in town clicking on things

1154
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:58,420
This is the most serious thing I've ever done in my life. Well snake. Oh, well, whatever. I'm just gonna come meet you

1155
01:47:58,939 --> 01:48:05,909
Yeah, this is act 3 nightmare if you guys are wondering this is the car I don't have this character in hell

1156
01:48:05,909 --> 01:48:07,909
He's only 46. He's little

1157
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:13,029
And you are I had I need to come up and find you. Yeah, I figured you'd spawn on me

1158
01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:16,350
Well, I don't assume that I'm that intelligent

1159
01:48:17,909 --> 01:48:19,909
Okay, sorry

1160
01:48:20,189 --> 01:48:28,000
I've never been to comic-con. I can't I want to go. It'd be really fun. Oh, there's an elite right there not cool

1161
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:30,520
Yeah, that guy

1162
01:48:31,479 --> 01:48:38,659
Comic-con is really interesting because it's isn't comic-con not just like comics. It's like pretty much about everything isn't it?

1163
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:49,239
Kind of a little bit everything they have a lot of movie stuff there too, and I don't know I could have gone once but I

1164
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,420
Might go to

1165
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:59,970
This one on in New York, right? New York and in Chicago. I probably go to the New York one

1166
01:48:59,970 --> 01:49:01,970
I can have the chance if I had like the money

1167
01:49:02,289 --> 01:49:07,649
That's the most important thing go into all these events. It costs money and that's just money that I don't have

1168
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:20,989
My gargantuan I need more health. I only have like 11,000 or so

1169
01:49:23,779 --> 01:49:25,779
Somebody wants to know

1170
01:49:25,899 --> 01:49:30,159
If you're gonna, oh god treasure goblin really get him get him buy some blues

1171
01:49:30,739 --> 01:49:32,899
No, no, no, this is not good at all

1172
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:36,939
Mass confusion get him there. Oh god. This is just chaos

1173
01:49:37,539 --> 01:49:40,460
He's dead. Oh, and he dropped a rare

1174
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:43,670
gay nightmare rare

1175
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:47,430
Oh run away run away run away

1176
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:55,670
Totally there. I'm gonna jail you and then order you so what I was gonna say is

1177
01:49:56,510 --> 01:50:01,810
Somebody wants to know if you're gonna continue your let's play they want to know there because they want to see the whole story

1178
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:05,850
They said oh of Diablo 3. Yeah, I was gonna upload one last night

1179
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:11,010
Actually, I did upload one but apparently never finished rendering. So it was like a fourth of a video

1180
01:50:12,569 --> 01:50:16,529
That's the worst thing see this video the one that right when this is the stream is done

1181
01:50:17,250 --> 01:50:22,369
Once it gets uploaded to YouTube it is gonna take like two hours to process. It's just like yeah

1182
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:25,850
Yeah, I wish there was a way. I did a full circle

1183
01:50:26,649 --> 01:50:32,609
We did but that's we need XP and we need items. Well, I want I didn't even identify that but well, this is a one-hander

1184
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:36,739
ooh

1185
01:50:36,739 --> 01:50:39,340
There's no dexterity on it though, but this is actually pretty good

1186
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:44,890
You know, hey, I have this thing that I found. It's a blue. So, you know, it's good

1187
01:50:45,409 --> 01:50:48,909
Go over here. Do you want to look at this? Is this thing better than what you have?

1188
01:50:49,489 --> 01:50:52,819
I know. I mean you could maybe use that. Let me see. Oh

1189
01:50:53,699 --> 01:50:59,840
Geez, it's not better. That thing is not better. I will sell it. Um

1190
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:05,279
I'm gonna be losing

1191
01:51:05,399 --> 01:51:10,859
2,000 life if I put this on but I'm gonna gain a ton of damage damage always need damage

1192
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:20,649
That's 2,000 health I'm gonna lose but you know what it's worth it to do almost a thousand more damage. Yeah, it's all blue

1193
01:51:21,409 --> 01:51:25,609
We'll do it. Yeah, we'll do it and temporarily. I'm just gonna put a

1194
01:51:27,359 --> 01:51:31,090
This gem into it. All right

1195
01:51:31,609 --> 01:51:38,989
Lost a bunch of health. So I'm gonna be an absolute wuss. I have pants too. Maybe you want pants pants

1196
01:51:38,989 --> 01:51:47,569
I don't need pants. What do I? Oh god way better than what I have again. I'm gonna be losing health. Oh

1197
01:51:49,550 --> 01:52:00,100
Well, I'm losing health who cares put this in there for now just to have it in there for now

1198
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:02,699
Alright

1199
01:52:02,699 --> 01:52:04,140
What's that?

1200
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:06,420
What's all this? What's what are you dropping? I want to look

1201
01:52:07,579 --> 01:52:12,939
Imagine if this is what Diablo 3 was where you just stand in place and items fall. What's this? We're not what's that?

1202
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:17,500
What's this? What's this this magic in the air? What's this? What's this?

1203
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:22,640
All right, 20 German points to whoever figures out what that song is from

1204
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:27,039
You remember what you can buy

1205
01:52:27,079 --> 01:52:34,140
German points. I don't think anything to be honest, but you can still buy a salad

1206
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:44,260
You can buy a German salad for 15 German don't sell a German. Give it to me. There's probably chocolate chips in the German salad

1207
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:49,979
I don't know if people want it, you know, I can't believe that you uh, but you don't like chocolate chip pancakes

1208
01:52:49,979 --> 01:52:55,420
That's that's some that's unbelievable. I've never actually had them just because the thought of that is absolutely rare

1209
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:57,819
this

1210
01:52:57,819 --> 01:52:59,500
disgusting

1211
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:01,979
Chocolate, oh, it's an offhand. Hold on. I'm oh

1212
01:53:02,939 --> 01:53:04,939
man, oh man

1213
01:53:04,979 --> 01:53:09,060
Gosh gee golly, I can't I don't have time to look at that, but I think it's better

1214
01:53:09,739 --> 01:53:13,159
I'm a witch doctor. I am a witch doctor

1215
01:53:14,039 --> 01:53:21,779
Star is a demon hunter. We're two best friends in Diablo 3. I hunt demons except sometimes they help me

1216
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:26,340
Make sense make sense

1217
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:36,819
the bones I carry a bow and

1218
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:40,180
Confusion mass confusion. Everyone start fighting each other. Oh

1219
01:53:42,319 --> 01:53:44,319
My god too much

1220
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:52,569
Good thing you don't have that health. Good thing. I need it. I could need it. I could use it

1221
01:53:53,210 --> 01:54:00,350
I'll get the lead watch out. We got an elite and he's got that pole move and he slows you down. That's just fantastic

1222
01:54:01,109 --> 01:54:02,750
He did

1223
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:10,420
He has all the things you drop any

1224
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:17,430
Yeah, those of you that said nightmare before Christmas you are you are a winner you get my right?

1225
01:54:17,430 --> 01:54:20,789
I'm gonna I'm gonna put my hand up to the screen right now and it's a high five. Hey, come here

1226
01:54:20,989 --> 01:54:22,510
Hey punk

1227
01:54:22,510 --> 01:54:23,909
Where you go?

1228
01:54:23,909 --> 01:54:26,529
What's that?

1229
01:54:26,529 --> 01:54:33,960
Wait, where do you keep finding these things? I don't floor. How come I'm not finding these in

1230
01:54:34,979 --> 01:54:36,979
It's way better than what I have. Thank you

1231
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:41,720
That didn't I just find so many items. I don't know what to do

1232
01:54:43,859 --> 01:54:45,859
No, where the there it is

1233
01:54:46,739 --> 01:54:49,659
23

1234
01:54:49,659 --> 01:54:54,880
1947 intellect it's way better. It is way a critical hit chance though

1235
01:54:56,369 --> 01:55:01,210
It's got two point five percent crit on it. This does not have it. But oh, hey, what's your amulet?

1236
01:55:01,890 --> 01:55:04,729
I'll inspect you. I'll inspect you this time. I'm gonna put this on

1237
01:55:05,449 --> 01:55:07,500
I'm gonna put a

1238
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:11,460
Vitality gem in that cuz I can't I'm under 10k health right now. This is awful

1239
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:14,140
Check out this amulet and tell me if you're like interested

1240
01:55:14,699 --> 01:55:16,939
And you could just have it anyway

1241
01:55:16,939 --> 01:55:23,699
All right, like say seriously you have just replaced like six pieces of my gear

1242
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:26,300
Okay

1243
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:28,979
The critical hit damage this this I have a rare on 30

1244
01:55:28,979 --> 01:55:33,500
What do you think 30% more crit damage or extra health and a little bit more damage?

1245
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:36,260
How much are you creating with mass confusion?

1246
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:42,300
Ten million. I think I'm gonna leave it on because I do pretty big crits with a poison dart

1247
01:55:42,859 --> 01:55:54,500
It's a treasure Google

1248
01:55:55,779 --> 01:56:02,899
What I recommend getting d3 compared to d2

1249
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:07,260
I probably not there is this really good game

1250
01:56:07,819 --> 01:56:12,560
Called you know, I think this is a treasure goblin. Where is he? Why is all his money over here?

1251
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:16,680
Why was that money right there? Where's this goblin? That was the goblin like

1252
01:56:17,399 --> 01:56:19,859
you go

1253
01:56:19,859 --> 01:56:21,500
Diablo 2 is

1254
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:26,579
One of my favorite games ever made so I'm very very biased when it comes to comparing Diablo 2 and Diablo 3

1255
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:31,529
But Diablo 2 I mean this game is awesome. Yeah, I'm playing it right now

1256
01:56:31,529 --> 01:56:35,470
I've dumped a ton of time into it. But if you were a huge fan of Diablo 2

1257
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:40,069
Then it's if you saw I did a review on this game already it's on the channel, but

1258
01:56:40,789 --> 01:56:44,229
It's it's kind of a letdown in the item department at least as of right now

1259
01:56:44,229 --> 01:56:52,590
They're gonna apparently they're gonna maybe potentially look at legendaries because where it stands right now a legendary item can be potentially worse than a blue

1260
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:55,569
Which is that's that just shouldn't be happening

1261
01:56:56,069 --> 01:56:59,939
But for the most part, I mean if you've never played a Diablo game

1262
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:04,800
This is a perfect time to get into it because this game is just it's very streamlined. It's very fun

1263
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:10,920
Addicting I say yes, go buy it go buy it if you've never if you've never played Diablo before and you want to then

1264
01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:13,199
Check it out for sure. It's awesome

1265
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:21,329
Star oh god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god too many balloons

1266
01:57:22,369 --> 01:57:25,750
Oh my god, my friend my my gargantuan

1267
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:28,079
He died

1268
01:57:28,079 --> 01:57:30,600
No, he almost did he grew

1269
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:32,479
stabilizers

1270
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:37,199
You need to have like when you go home with your witch doctor on the wall

1271
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:42,800
You need to put notches on the wall for how higher gargantuan grows. Oh, I want to look at something real quick

1272
01:57:43,319 --> 01:57:48,640
Give me one second. Okay, I'll hide in corner with you. How far behind is the stream?

1273
01:57:49,239 --> 01:57:53,300
Like the street like I think this I think my 720 stream is like seven years behind

1274
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:56,100
that happens

1275
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:58,060
Let me take a look at this

1276
01:57:58,060 --> 01:58:06,340
Because that's like so people are still like just answering that nightmare before Christmas and that was like five minutes ago

1277
01:58:06,899 --> 01:58:10,140
So I want to see I want to see just how far back it is

1278
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:14,520
Somebody said 15 seconds

1279
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:21,020
Actually, you know the YouTube comment system is probably just bugged like it always is. I probably said that before

1280
01:58:21,819 --> 01:58:23,260
Yeah

1281
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:25,260
Why am I why I'm watching an ad?

1282
01:58:31,449 --> 01:58:36,079
Adception right there ads on top of ads on top of ads

1283
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,600
They're advertising an ad go watch this ad

1284
01:58:41,079 --> 01:58:46,500
Please go watch this ad on top of this ad on top of this ad go watch this ad

1285
01:58:47,859 --> 01:58:52,369
Let me see. Let me see. Go watch this ad on top of there's a goblin and you're

1286
01:58:52,970 --> 01:58:56,289
Go watch this ad my entrance too low for this

1287
01:58:57,289 --> 01:59:04,079
Yeah, I guess if you're behind on 720 then oh my darling. What am I dead from?

1288
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:07,159
If you're behind on 720 then

1289
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:11,890
I died. Oh

1290
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:14,920
Is that my fault?

1291
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:16,079
No, it's my fault

1292
01:59:16,079 --> 01:59:20,199
If you're behind on 720 refresh the page because that'll put that I'll kick that'll get you back in check

1293
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:23,319
Because some people are like five to ten minutes behind

1294
01:59:24,039 --> 01:59:34,760
Why don't I have ad block on? Um, because I mean at least for YouTube. I like to support youtubers

1295
01:59:35,399 --> 01:59:41,180
Like at least people that run ads on their videos. So if like if I have a friend or something that has ads

1296
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:42,539
I usually keep it on

1297
01:59:42,539 --> 01:59:46,060
Just because I like to be nice to them. I don't

1298
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:55,350
Very good guy plus can't add block block other stuff. It's that kind of not supposed to I don't think so

1299
01:59:55,989 --> 01:59:57,470
What's the not supposed to block?

1300
01:59:57,470 --> 02:00:03,430
I don't know like I remember like hearing that some it's some places like it might think something is an ad when it's not

1301
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:13,210
I don't think I've seen anything like that. Do you have that block? I do I turn it off sometimes though

1302
02:00:13,210 --> 02:00:15,569
Usually when I watch streams or whatever. Yeah, I

1303
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:18,689
Assume that's what a lot of people do cuz man

1304
02:00:18,689 --> 02:00:24,489
I guess it can get really annoying like if you're just browsing websites and it's like oh take over your entire screen with an ad

1305
02:00:24,489 --> 02:00:26,489
I hate those

1306
02:00:26,649 --> 02:00:32,810
Like four pages to tell you that this is an ad yeah, the worst thing is open and tell you to watch the other page

1307
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:34,210
Oh

1308
02:00:34,210 --> 02:00:36,829
that

1309
02:00:36,829 --> 02:00:41,270
Did I have for a second? I thought we just beat her but I was looking at the chat

1310
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:51,869
Kill the daughters of pain

1311
02:00:53,180 --> 02:00:54,779
destroyed

1312
02:00:54,779 --> 02:01:03,100
Wait, did she really did die? Didn't she? No, no, that's that's like her like introduced myself thing, isn't it?

1313
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:05,060
Oh, yeah, this is the one where she doesn't even fight you

1314
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:10,659
She just like shows up and like hey and then you shoot her once and she says no she just introduces herself

1315
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:12,779
Hi, I'm a spider

1316
02:01:12,779 --> 02:01:16,460
Yeah, somebody said ad blockers can mess up some for honestly for this part

1317
02:01:16,460 --> 02:01:19,979
I was playing through when I was doing with this character and I was thinking to myself that

1318
02:01:20,619 --> 02:01:22,939
you probably were supposed to beat her there and

1319
02:01:23,579 --> 02:01:26,500
There was probably supposed to be a different boss later and they just are like

1320
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:31,380
No, yeah, baby. No, I will just let it blittered run away

1321
02:01:32,579 --> 02:01:34,340
Really feels like that

1322
02:01:34,380 --> 02:01:36,380
Feels like that with a lot of stuff in this game

1323
02:01:36,819 --> 02:01:40,710
But there are they're patching it. There's apparently a big patch

1324
02:01:40,710 --> 02:01:43,750
they're working on for this game and I don't they haven't said anything about it, but

1325
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:47,590
Let's let's wait and see what it is. I hope it's $15

1326
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:51,430
Dollars it was $15

1327
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:57,430
I would literally a dump a brick like a brick would I would I would have to run to the bathroom because a brick would

1328
02:01:57,430 --> 02:02:03,310
Be coming out. I just imagined you taking a very long drive to a nearby dump taking a brick out of your car

1329
02:02:03,710 --> 02:02:05,710
Just flopping it somewhere

1330
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:10,149
That is how mad you are going that far out of your way

1331
02:02:11,989 --> 02:02:14,739
So close now

1332
02:02:14,859 --> 02:02:16,859
children of the corn

1333
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:21,399
No, you destroyed the heart. I'm so mad, but I'll keep haunting you

1334
02:02:22,119 --> 02:02:24,119
like my body their implications

1335
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:28,539
Anyone would want to bang his spider

1336
02:02:32,439 --> 02:02:40,289
Spider so seductive good job confusing those two bugs

1337
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:46,399
oh

1338
02:02:47,939 --> 02:02:50,659
Hey, I did my part

1339
02:02:50,659 --> 02:02:54,619
It's not like these things are giving me they like died before it even came out. I

1340
02:02:55,420 --> 02:03:02,779
Did my part say I should have used it right now, but it's not cool down because I'm stupid

1341
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:09,609
No, yeah, and this would be a great time to use it because there's like a bunch of blue people. Oh, I see a yellow

1342
02:03:09,609 --> 02:03:13,729
I see yellow. I'm not gonna pick it up now cuz I want to kill stuff first

1343
02:03:14,770 --> 02:03:21,060
Then the server shut down. Oh, that would be terrible if it did. I'm already overburdened

1344
02:03:21,899 --> 02:03:26,119
Really you were just in town legs. Okay legs

1345
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:29,970
these are

1346
02:03:29,970 --> 02:03:36,369
Very good for someone else. That is not me. Oh, I will hold on to them. Oh

1347
02:03:40,949 --> 02:03:48,310
Gotta make a town run. It's all about that money all about the paper. It's all about that

1348
02:03:49,210 --> 02:03:58,670
Diablo 3 money once I get a million gold. I'll be happy slowly getting open floors

1349
02:03:58,670 --> 02:04:05,949
I have five hundred seventy one thousand going to get in there look at some of this stuff

1350
02:04:05,949 --> 02:04:12,659
I got a lot of just crappy rares that I just need to sell it's gonna take too long in the auction house

1351
02:04:14,479 --> 02:04:17,739
Mmm, I'll save these for later. Maybe I will try and sell them

1352
02:04:18,359 --> 02:04:25,199
Yeah, I think my auction house actually like cleared and all of the items that were in the completed section are gone

1353
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:27,640
No, the items that I was something are gone

1354
02:04:28,079 --> 02:04:30,079
Weird that shouldn't do that

1355
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:32,680
Yeah, I shouldn't but

1356
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:40,829
Mmm, I mean just I got a stash a lot of this stuff. I I need after we kill

1357
02:04:41,550 --> 02:04:46,229
Asmodan I need like a million minutes to like sip sort through all this stuff that I have

1358
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:54,779
Okay, I hope people are ready for like the most exciting part of this stream

1359
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:58,359
Jerma going through his items and figuring out what he's gonna sell. I

1360
02:04:59,039 --> 02:05:13,420
Would decide him. Okay now I got room in my backpack. I'm just gonna sell these I don't need them

1361
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:22,829
Whatever I'll hold on for now just because you destroyed the sin heart

1362
02:05:26,890 --> 02:05:28,890
Potions are expensive in this game

1363
02:05:29,329 --> 02:05:31,569
Yes, I concur

1364
02:05:32,289 --> 02:05:39,199
Potions are very expensive. That's why I got ferrets

1365
02:05:41,609 --> 02:05:42,649
ferrets

1366
02:05:42,649 --> 02:05:50,869
My buddy's here

1367
02:05:50,869 --> 02:05:57,289
You know, I'm gonna check out that other ruin for fire bats

1368
02:05:58,130 --> 02:06:07,739
Check it out money money money. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get the money. All right

1369
02:06:08,579 --> 02:06:14,500
Get a good a good a good a good rapidly summoned bats that seek out nearby enemies for 280% weapon damage as fire

1370
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:16,500
Oh my god, I'll try that right now

1371
02:06:16,739 --> 02:06:22,319
Don't even know there's a lot of damage. I would recommend that to anyone

1372
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:27,800
Who likes damage? I'll stick with blow dart just cuz I love blow dart. Let me check this out. Let's see. Oh

1373
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:31,159
It's okay. Cool

1374
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:34,960
It's a lot less group. Not really a crowd move anymore

1375
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:40,859
It's kind of a single-target move. No, I should go to whimsy shire. I

1376
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:48,359
I'm not at that stage. I'm a noob. I'm not ready for the ponies. I'm not ready for it yet

1377
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:52,819
What is Hodor?

1378
02:06:52,979 --> 02:06:54,979
Holdor? What's that?

1379
02:06:55,539 --> 02:06:59,899
I guess I can just kind of stand back and do this. It does a lot of damage

1380
02:07:00,779 --> 02:07:07,899
Blows through mana like crazy though. I don't know if I like it. I'll try it for a little while

1381
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:16,779
I'm not picking up pages of jewel crafting only because I'm it's not something I plan on doing at least right now

1382
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:22,220
Once I have a ton of money. Well, then even then you would use tomes. Yeah, I mean it's I'm in nightmare right now

1383
02:07:22,220 --> 02:07:24,220
So the pages of jewel crafting

1384
02:07:24,899 --> 02:07:27,899
Aren't gonna get me really anything. Why is my dude dead?

1385
02:07:28,699 --> 02:07:35,159
run away

1386
02:07:35,159 --> 02:07:37,310
Go get him back

1387
02:07:37,310 --> 02:07:46,590
The reason why I didn't stream yesterday is because I was having internet problems for some reason. I couldn't I couldn't get 720 to

1388
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:51,789
To go go through and even 360 was being really really slow and choppy. So

1389
02:07:52,470 --> 02:07:54,550
Something was going on with the internet. I don't know why but

1390
02:07:55,310 --> 02:07:58,270
Doing an extra long one tonight today this morning

1391
02:08:00,239 --> 02:08:02,739
extra extra extra

1392
02:08:02,939 --> 02:08:08,579
Re-extree read all about it. You can help me if you like it. I

1393
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:17,369
Felt like it then if you're just joining us if you just you just kind of jumped in this is stars here

1394
02:08:19,239 --> 02:08:21,729
The star

1395
02:08:22,529 --> 02:08:30,439
47 there we go. Level it up. Ooh new runes. What are they?

1396
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:34,800
Spirit walk rune. I'm gonna check that out

1397
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:37,359
Yep, this would be on the channel later

1398
02:08:37,359 --> 02:08:39,359
for show for sure

1399
02:08:39,479 --> 02:08:42,300
for sure

1400
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:46,960
Find the time is it?

1401
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:49,880
20 of 11 a.m. Oh

1402
02:08:51,170 --> 02:08:56,689
Yeah, it tells you the time in Diablo. Yeah, remember we were talking about that. It's like, oh how much time have we lost?

1403
02:08:56,689 --> 02:09:00,689
Oh, there it is. And my DX story always covered it, but actually it's on the left now

1404
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:15,039
The sin hot get that waypoint bats bats everywhere

1405
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:25,149
That money give me that money yo money you should

1406
02:09:25,869 --> 02:09:30,479
See I used it a good time that time didn't are you proud of it? I am there was

1407
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,880
There was a lot of reasons to do that. I

1408
02:09:33,399 --> 02:09:40,279
Might have to take off that passive skill what makes all my mana stuff cost more money

1409
02:09:40,279 --> 02:09:43,520
I mean more mana. I'll make sure my mana cost more money

1410
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:48,350
I don't know why that cost more mana for what it's

1411
02:09:49,310 --> 02:09:50,909
It's

1412
02:09:50,909 --> 02:09:56,760
All of your damage is increased by 20% but every spell cost 30% more mana

1413
02:09:57,239 --> 02:10:00,840
But that's so good. That's it's so much more damage than I wouldn't be doing

1414
02:10:04,689 --> 02:10:18,479
Squeaky chair wait wait, I'll probably be playing Diablo 3. I mean today you mean today

1415
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:23,340
Probably after we kill

1416
02:10:23,899 --> 02:10:25,899
Aspidan once we get to the last part of this act

1417
02:10:25,899 --> 02:10:32,899
I might take a break, but if you meant long term I'll be playing this game for probably a very long time

1418
02:10:32,899 --> 02:10:38,380
I would say if it turns out after all the patches and all the bug fixes and

1419
02:10:38,939 --> 02:10:43,420
After the initial launch period then if it all stays well, and it's all good

1420
02:10:43,420 --> 02:10:45,619
I'll be playing this game for a very very very long time

1421
02:10:46,100 --> 02:10:49,500
Yeah, okay, you're here this game. I'm excel

1422
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:51,899
That we still need to play

1423
02:10:51,899 --> 02:10:56,739
Most mxd most extreme elimination channel. Yes. Did you actually install a t2? I?

1424
02:10:57,619 --> 02:10:59,619
actually did not

1425
02:10:59,619 --> 02:11:05,340
But I could that'll take two seconds. It's only like a one gig file to be honest. Oh, did you download it? I?

1426
02:11:05,939 --> 02:11:12,420
Think I have it downloaded so it shouldn't take that long to do when you download it and install it. Don't open it

1427
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:20,840
Oh do that okay? I think actually I think I still have I think I downloaded it on this computer a long time ago

1428
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:24,680
I think it's just still sitting like the installation file is just still sitting on the computer somewhere

1429
02:11:27,569 --> 02:11:32,170
I'd like to ask you a very serious question right now, okay? What is with the dudes in the background?

1430
02:11:32,569 --> 02:11:35,689
What is your theory on why you can never see their feet?

1431
02:11:37,569 --> 02:11:40,409
They're having a party and

1432
02:11:41,550 --> 02:11:46,100
They're the pinatas these poor guys

1433
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:51,960
I mean as man would certainly have a much higher chance of winning this whole war if you just like

1434
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:55,680
If it is unchanged yeah, you know watch out for the disco ball one of them

1435
02:11:56,279 --> 02:12:02,479
You unchain one of those guys. He will take out an entire city. Yeah, I don't know maybe they they're not that good at fighting

1436
02:12:04,659 --> 02:12:11,039
So they're big good at what are they doing? Why are they here? Well? I mean look think of it this way

1437
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:16,640
These guys are probably not that strong at this point. They've been kind of chained up with like stuff in their heads

1438
02:12:17,359 --> 02:12:22,359
Why I don't think they'd be that tough anymore if you released them. They probably just fall over and go all right

1439
02:12:23,359 --> 02:12:27,539
We even if they just fell over that'd be a pretty big fall

1440
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:30,260
Take a fall in the right spot

1441
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:34,210
Maybe all around and be like change my diaper

1442
02:12:35,949 --> 02:12:42,229
You don't want that in her I get there wherever you're so close now so close oh

1443
02:12:43,649 --> 02:12:45,170
Yeah

1444
02:12:45,170 --> 02:12:49,930
You destroyed the sin heart. I can't believe you how dare you?

1445
02:12:51,369 --> 02:12:54,170
Second important question. Yeah, why is there no elevator here?

1446
02:12:54,890 --> 02:13:00,310
Yeah, and you know what follow-up important question. How did asthma Dan get down here?

1447
02:13:00,829 --> 02:13:04,119
Like did he didn't come down these stairs?

1448
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:06,560
He's too big

1449
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:11,159
Was he just like born in the bottom, and it just never goes anywhere. He doesn't ever go out I

1450
02:13:12,189 --> 02:13:16,510
Guess like oh, let me like here's my house my big asthma Dan house. I'm like a

1451
02:13:17,189 --> 02:13:20,069
75 foot tall like 9 million pound monster

1452
02:13:20,229 --> 02:13:25,510
Let me walk down my spiral staircase when you can like astral project images of your heads

1453
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:27,510
You can talk shit to people

1454
02:13:28,310 --> 02:13:34,000
Like when that's your thing. I don't imagine you're going out. Yeah, I probably just sit there and like call ex-girlfriend

1455
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:38,880
You have no hope put the foot dive

1456
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:46,569
Eat it bats eat bats

1457
02:13:46,970 --> 02:13:53,369
More bats stand in the middle. Oh

1458
02:13:54,050 --> 02:14:00,220
God oh god. Oh god. Yeah, I need I need a more crowd move. This is this big very single target

1459
02:14:00,779 --> 02:14:04,859
It's not sure I'm gonna stick with it, or I'm gonna change boys in dark something else

1460
02:14:05,619 --> 02:14:12,000
Maybe he uses teleportation. That is a good theory. That is a good theory

1461
02:14:12,680 --> 02:14:14,479
Maybe I mean

1462
02:14:14,479 --> 02:14:16,850
He is the lord of

1463
02:14:17,449 --> 02:14:22,529
Sin here. I was saying be here. Did you say beer? I said beer

1464
02:14:24,850 --> 02:14:27,569
Yeah, as my dad like he owns a micro brewery a

1465
02:14:28,210 --> 02:14:30,090
lord of beer

1466
02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:33,789
How dare you do oh god? I'm dead. I'm gonna die right now

1467
02:14:34,510 --> 02:14:37,529
How dare you insult the lord of beer?

1468
02:14:38,409 --> 02:14:43,220
well, oh and the fear of my delicious hops and

1469
02:14:43,859 --> 02:14:49,380
Yeast no, I thought he was fearing. That's why he was always

1470
02:14:51,060 --> 02:14:54,340
The world here be lord of sin getting off on that

1471
02:14:54,939 --> 02:14:57,340
He is a weird one

1472
02:14:57,340 --> 02:15:03,439
He does live with a spider lady. That's hell-bent on making us like love her but hate her at the same time

1473
02:15:04,079 --> 02:15:09,520
Why won't you bang me? This is his roommate by the way, you know that that's as you that's what you got to live with

1474
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:12,920
I would go for like his wife or something

1475
02:15:14,119 --> 02:15:20,279
Maybe he just got drunk one night and woke up down there is what someone said she just won't leave like oh, yeah

1476
02:15:20,279 --> 02:15:26,399
Where am I? I'm so shit face right now. What is this place? I own it now. Oh

1477
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:29,670
This is mine. Oh

1478
02:15:33,250 --> 02:15:42,340
This is mine

1479
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:47,779
Why these giant tall guys are here, all right, this definitely gets comment of the stream

1480
02:15:48,659 --> 02:15:54,380
Damn it. I want to take a dump. Well, you guys talk louder so I can hear you from the crap. Oh

1481
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:57,920
my god, oh

1482
02:15:59,239 --> 02:16:07,750
My goodness get her yeah, I can't even stun that that move only works on like actual enemies

1483
02:16:08,529 --> 02:16:11,210
unfortunate

1484
02:16:11,210 --> 02:16:13,770
All right, kill it before the teleport kill it before the teleport

1485
02:16:13,770 --> 02:16:16,199
Oh

1486
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:23,600
No, I don't I don't I unless you're like a normal and one-shot or maybe we're getting it

1487
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:32,360
Now blow up at one of asthma dance like four hearts, is he a cow or something?

1488
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:37,170
He must be a cow don't know cows. Oh my god, I'm an idiot

1489
02:16:38,930 --> 02:16:45,780
Cows have multiple stomachs not multiple hearts. Oh, is he like a cow? He has like four hearts

1490
02:16:46,420 --> 02:16:53,370
Derp, oh look. Oh, come on. It's starting to make sense. What's what is it? This is one of those big guys chests

1491
02:16:53,690 --> 02:16:56,770
It's ripped open and the heart is placed over here

1492
02:16:57,290 --> 02:17:04,170
What what you see? That's why would they do such a thing and then the heart powers?

1493
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:08,280
Duracell I

1494
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:14,079
Don't get how the hearts power is well, how come then look at this guy?

1495
02:17:14,079 --> 02:17:17,360
How come this guy isn't like has a sin heart? Maybe he's not cool enough

1496
02:17:17,399 --> 02:17:22,200
I guess they're I guess they're like harvesting them. Okay, seriously seriously. Look at this

1497
02:17:22,399 --> 02:17:26,799
There is no way asthma Dan can fit down this staircase. Look at this. There's no way

1498
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:31,260
Look at this. Look at look at up. Look at the height. I'm pointing at the screen right now, by the way

1499
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:35,020
I don't know why the height of this ceiling look at this

1500
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:38,180
Oh, I'm gonna go in my door like he wouldn't even be able to get in here

1501
02:17:38,180 --> 02:17:42,659
He just jumps down like he doesn't use the stairs. He just wrong bat and he rolls off the edge

1502
02:17:44,420 --> 02:17:48,579
Somebody asked how is this early morning?

1503
02:17:48,819 --> 02:17:54,500
I started this anymore. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I started the straight. I've been going for a couple hours at least a few hours

1504
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:57,260
It was it was early morning

1505
02:17:57,459 --> 02:18:04,059
When I started I am here. So after this I'm probably gonna

1506
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:08,420
Close the stream out for a little while. I might come back. I'm not sure though

1507
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:14,139
Probably not because I want to get some food and my way I might go to the gym but get the way point

1508
02:18:14,540 --> 02:18:16,540
We're about to kill asthma then

1509
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:18,700
This is on nightmare. So he might be a little tough

1510
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:21,709
Yeah, okay, he might be super tough

1511
02:18:24,659 --> 02:18:27,270
Everyone's gonna be very disappointed when he dies

1512
02:18:29,549 --> 02:18:33,319
That's that's that's that's that's

1513
02:18:38,409 --> 02:18:43,930
I started to oh, let me use mass confusion ready. I'll do it. I'll use it. I started at

1514
02:18:46,229 --> 02:18:49,229
7 38 a.m. My time so it's been about three hours

1515
02:18:50,030 --> 02:18:56,500
Going on like three and a half. Maybe I never I never know until I'm done and I look at the file that goes up

1516
02:18:56,500 --> 02:18:57,420
to YouTube

1517
02:18:57,459 --> 02:19:05,049
But it'd probably be about three and a half four hours the whole thing I would assume. Oh

1518
02:19:06,469 --> 02:19:13,920
God, oh you live in Hong Kong. So what is like nighttime or something for you?

1519
02:19:14,479 --> 02:19:18,440
Well, you wait now you're behind. I don't even know time zones how you work

1520
02:19:22,610 --> 02:19:27,450
If you didn't get to see the TF 2 or you do well

1521
02:19:27,450 --> 02:19:29,250
You didn't get to see the beginning of the Diablo 3 stuff

1522
02:19:29,250 --> 02:19:32,850
It's all gonna be up in probably a couple hours. The whole thing will be on YouTube

1523
02:19:33,489 --> 02:19:37,729
mass confusion

1524
02:19:37,770 --> 02:19:47,129
Didn't even oh there we go. All right, I got that thing with charms kill him. You're on my team now

1525
02:19:47,129 --> 02:19:56,790
Oh, okay. Oh, I wasn't talking to you. Hey kill him. No, I'm not that much of a jerk. I just got a rare

1526
02:19:57,229 --> 02:19:59,229
Come on. Give me a good roll. Give me a good roll

1527
02:20:02,110 --> 02:20:07,700
No, I'll actually put the gem in there. No, I don't think so

1528
02:20:09,139 --> 02:20:11,139
Do I look good in this?

1529
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:13,780
Does this make me look fat?

1530
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:16,440
Oh

1531
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:22,079
Where's my buddy? There he is. He always dies and I never like realize it. Yeah

1532
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:27,979
if you just made like a compilation of

1533
02:20:28,899 --> 02:20:32,459
The noises I've made in this stream and just made a video of it

1534
02:20:32,459 --> 02:20:35,180
Like it would be like you probably pretty funny like yeah, what?

1535
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:39,420
I make a whole lot of noises

1536
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:48,079
Someone said go star. I love you. I'm going here. We are. All right, so this is it. So after this I'm gonna

1537
02:20:48,799 --> 02:20:54,370
Close out the stream and we will go from there and this will all be uploaded to YouTube

1538
02:20:55,170 --> 02:21:00,399
If we if we don't wipe like five times, which we will not star is a pro

1539
02:21:02,670 --> 02:21:08,069
Well, there is there's a guy that like lives in his like down here and that's it he can't move wiggles around jiggles

1540
02:21:10,750 --> 02:21:21,920
There he comes go get him gargantuan, you know what I want to do this and that bats

1541
02:21:22,760 --> 02:21:26,790
He's going down

1542
02:21:26,950 --> 02:21:28,469
very very easily

1543
02:21:28,469 --> 02:21:30,510
What does that bomb move you're doing? Oh my god

1544
02:21:30,510 --> 02:21:34,469
I almost got one shot what bomb moves the way it kind of looks like that looks like the assassin skill

1545
02:21:34,469 --> 02:21:40,190
Remember the first assassin skill you really got is do oh, yeah fire bombs. Yeah, kind of like that

1546
02:21:40,190 --> 02:21:45,950
I can't even like I really only use it to build hatred. I'm gonna die. Oh, you're dead. I'm dead

1547
02:21:47,389 --> 02:21:51,629
Stay alive star. Um, I'm okay. I got ferrets

1548
02:21:52,350 --> 02:21:54,350
Use those ferrets to kill this

1549
02:21:54,389 --> 02:22:00,510
Bat sloppy bastard. They're trying to keep up with me and they're like spazzing out so hard

1550
02:22:00,510 --> 02:22:02,870
There is no way you're gonna be able to come get me by the way

1551
02:22:02,870 --> 02:22:07,309
I'm like in this pool of not like this darkness pool. You're gonna die of even trying to revive me. I

1552
02:22:08,389 --> 02:22:12,149
Got you. Trust me. I could do it. I gotta do it just because you said I couldn't oh

1553
02:22:14,670 --> 02:22:16,829
