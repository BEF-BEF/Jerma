00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,900
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,960
and tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier with the strange rocket launcher, the buff

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,960
banner, and the escape plan, probably my default setup as the Soldier. And before I get into

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,159
really anything in this video, I want to talk about something very, very important. It seems

5
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,840
like YouTube hates my channel in recent weeks. Half of my videos are not publishing to you

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,560
guys. I put a tweet out last night asking, hey, are you guys even getting my videos in

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,679
your sub boxes? And at least 15 people were like, nope. So I guess the only real solution

8
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:53,799
to this, because it's totally out of my hands, guys, I really wish there was something I

9
00:00:53,799 --> 00:01:00,240
could do, is if you are not getting my videos in your sub box, I'm just gonna put my recent

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,079
videos in the description of pretty much all my videos, just so if you happen to catch

11
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:09,239
one of them, you'll be able to go to the description and go and see the ones that you may have

12
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,689
missed. Now, that's obviously not the ideal solution. I'd like my channel just to work

13
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:19,590
as intended. But if it's not going to, then that's the only thing I can really think of

14
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,549
for a solution. So in the description of this video, there's gonna be a list of three or

15
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,629
four videos that you may have missed. And if you already saw them, you don't have to

16
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,950
go back and watch them again. It's just these that's just there for the people that may

17
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,069
have missed something. So if you go through that list and you say, wait a second, I didn't

18
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:39,030
see this face cam fortress video, what the hell, then go ahead and click on it. And you

19
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,390
can go ahead and watch it from there. So again, I am really sorry about this. I wish there

20
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:49,590
was something I could do, but there just there just isn't. I'm at the mercy of YouTube. But

21
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,430
enough of that, that that's enough depressing talk for one day. Let's get into the video.

22
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,230
Let's talk about the soldier on gorge. I want to give you a couple tips on gorge as

23
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,000
soldier. So the first thing I want to talk about is this right balcony. And most of these

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,040
things are going to be on defense, not very many offensive tips for you right now, because

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,240
obviously I'm playing on defense. But if you saw right there, when I jumped up on this

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,680
right side, I totally negated the rocket jump because there was a small health pack sitting

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,879
right here. Now, anytime you jump up here, you're never gonna have to worry about losing

28
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,039
health on your rocket jump. And oh, I'm gonna have like 40 50 less health. Oh, that's not

29
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,080
good. You don't have to worry about that, because you will get that every single time.

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,520
Unless this is a big unless unless there is a teleporter sitting right here, and there's

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,500
nine people up here all pushing the point, then this is not the best route to go. But

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,460
if you see in this gameplay, there's very few people up here, there's only one sniper or

33
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,139
one pyro will be up here at any given time. So this is a fantastic way to wrap around.

34
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,580
And that's what you want to try and do here. When you get up here, when you finally go

35
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,419
around and you kill a couple people, you are going to have a bird's eye view perfect for

36
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:59,219
soldier, you're going to be on high ground over everybody, which allows you to jump down

37
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,219
if you want, try and do some crazy tactics, try and do a super shot. I don't even know

38
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:07,780
what a super shot is. But it gives you a lot of options to play around as the soldier.

39
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,539
And speaking of just gorge in general, there's a lot of these little balconies, there's a

40
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:16,699
lot of these little side balconies, even on the first point, the second point, all in

41
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:21,030
between, there's a lot of places for you to jump. And I don't mean jump around like

42
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:25,750
star, where star jumps around like crazy and gets like 90 kills by jumping off walls and

43
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,909
going around. I'm talking just regular, here's a balcony and dares to jump, I jumped up

44
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:35,310
to the balcony. That's my type of rocket jump. That's my, I can't really do that crazy,

45
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,509
awesome stuff. But there's a lot of these on gorge, a lot of these small balconies,

46
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:43,629
small cubbies. And it kind of reminds me of a place like gravel pit, where gravel pit

47
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:48,150
has a couple of small jumps that take you to really, really important places. But only

48
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,870
a couple classes can even get there. People like the scout, the pyro, the soldier and

49
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,509
the demo man are the only ones, well, I guess the medic now has an opportunity if he uses

50
00:03:56,509 --> 00:04:01,110
the quick fix. But they're the only ones with the opportunities to move higher than a normal

51
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,409
jump at any given second. And I really love maps in this game that allow certain opportunities

52
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:10,349
for different classes. I'm not a big fan of maps where you just kind of pit one team

53
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,310
against the other team. And you just smash together in the middle and that's it. It's

54
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,629
just like a big mess of people in one spot. I like when there's multiple options. I like

55
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:23,430
when there's a lot of strategy involved. Strategy on a very basic level, not strategy like,

56
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,709
okay, we got to have two scouts over that way. We got to have four medics go that way,

57
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:29,750
four medic, that's a lot of people. But you know what I mean? I like when things have just

58
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,620
general diversity. I like when things are allowed to be done a million different ways. And that's

59
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,899
why I love Team Fortress. There's a million different ways to play this game. You could

60
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,660
come on and play this game tonight and then play it tomorrow and do something completely

61
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,139
different and you might even learn something. I'm still learning things in this game and

62
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,660
I've been playing since the beta. That's how ridiculous this game really is. But enough

63
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,540
about my love for Team Fortress, let's get back to the Soldier and talk about another

64
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:02,060
chip that you could do on Gravel Pit. I mean Gorge. So on Gravel, I almost just did it

65
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,980
again. On Gorge, G-O-R-G-E on defense, you're going to notice that the blue team after capping

66
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,819
the first point only has one spawn door to come out of. And look where it is. It's up

67
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:18,139
on a high rise. So if you can wrap around as the Soldier here, get around, kill a couple

68
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:24,300
people, you will cause so much fear and so much chaos because you can jump up here in

69
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,860
front of their spawn door. Now I do it once and I jump right back down, but look at all

70
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,939
these people that are like, just running away from me because they are so scared. That's

71
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:36,060
what you want to try and do. I mean, you don't want to try and do this, make this kind of

72
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,740
a little side mission if you end up doing it. But once you do get back here, just look

73
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,860
at all these people that are in a freak out mode right now. All of them are just thinking,

74
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,620
get this guy out of here. Can we get somebody to kill this Soldier? Can we get him out of

75
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,199
here? Throw him in the dungeon for crying out loud. That will be going through my head.

76
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,899
So it's good to cause some chaos every now and then. Good to freak the other team out.

77
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:01,100
So then they're looking for you again. Because if you get away, that's the number one thing.

78
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,339
If you can get away after doing this, you are going to make so many people coming out

79
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:08,220
of the spawn. Just look left, look, where is that? Is that Soldier here? Kind of the

80
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,129
same theory if you were a spy, I guess. But that is going to wrap up the video, guys.

81
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:17,490
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And again, there's going

82
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,329
to be a list of three or four videos in the description that you may have missed because

83
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:26,069
sub boxes are being really messed up and crazy. So if you want to go check those videos out,

84
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:30,170
they will be there. And every single video I make from now on is going to have the last

85
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:35,529
three or four videos in the description. I'm going to do this for as long as... Until this

86
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:39,449
is all fixed, I'm going to be doing it for that long. So thank you guys again for watching

87
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,930
so much. I'll see you guys all soon. And take care, everybody.
