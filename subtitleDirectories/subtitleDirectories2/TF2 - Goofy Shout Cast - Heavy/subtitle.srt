00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:15,580
Hello ladies and gentlemen, this is Anthony Wimbleton coming at you with a first shoutcast on German 95's channel.

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,579
Never done a shoutcast before, but that's okay, we're gonna change that right now.

3
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:25,579
Coming at you with a heavy gameplay. Rocket at new school with the gloves of running urgently, the family business, and the Tommy Slav.

4
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:30,579
Germa is in a really, really crazy mood right now. He's gonna try and do a shoutcast for the first time. He's gonna do it right now as a heavy...

5
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:31,579
Here we go!

6
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:36,579
Spy coming around the corner trying to get a backstab on somebody, maybe snap the sentry as well, but Germa does not let that happen.

7
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:41,579
Jumps around the corner with the Tommy Slav and starts unloading a massive amount of damage on everybody that's coming up to the side here.

8
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,579
A lot of things going on right now, a lot of chaos, a lot of damage going on.

9
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,579
Sentry looks like it might be going down, but that's not a concern to Germa because he's not an engineer.

10
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,579
Pyro kinda hides around the corner trying to find a way to get somebody with a spray.

11
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:55,579
Germa backs off for a second with his Chinese or Japanese friend that's a medic.

12
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,579
Not really sure too much about that right now, but I'll get back to that in a minute.

13
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:03,579
Germa right now hogging the cart like it's one of his favorite toys when he was five years old, trying to find a way to stop this team from pushing all the way to the middle here.

14
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:09,579
Spy gets back out here, tries to get the sap on the engineer, but he gets the stab actually, and he does not get the sap.

15
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:14,879
Unfortunately though, these two dispensers are going to go down, which is going to stop our team from healing a lot.

16
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,879
Look at this Pyro spraying into nowhere, and here comes the first Uber of the game.

17
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,879
Germa comes around the corner here, loses the medic for the first time, but he finds a way to get to the medic again.

18
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:25,879
Absolute perfect push here, got a Spy on the side here, trying to get a backstab on one of our teammates.

19
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,879
He does not get the stab, instead he goes down, down to Chinatown, whipping off the gloves of running urgently,

20
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,879
and he sees an opportunity to get this engineer in his building, but now he's kind of hiding on the right side of the bridge,

21
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,879
and he gets this engineer and this Pyro and that Demoman.

22
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,879
I did not say engineer, I meant to say Demoman, I'm sorry about that.

23
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,879
Red Engineer now has the teleporter built up to level two, I believe, so now our team can come right back into the front lines when they die.

24
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,879
Medic goes down, I believe he had about 25% Uber, which is a good thing, because now he cannot charge that on a teammate.

25
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:56,879
Soldier gets around, and Germa realizes this, so he swiftly and methodically goes over into the courtyard area and towards this house into the building.

26
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,879
He finds that there is a Soldier and a Demoman and a Pyro here, ready to be shot, but he doesn't want to get himself killed,

27
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,879
so he walks out of the back door trying to find his Medic friend.

28
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,879
Turns around and sees that the Medic is obviously preoccupied with something else, so instead of saying over voice chat,

29
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,879
hey can you heal me? He just turns around and goes the other way like an idiot.

30
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,879
Picks up this health pack on the ground here, and he knows that there's another health pack over on this side as well, near the engineer.

31
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,879
Doesn't want to take the ammo, because he doesn't want to be a jerk and take the metal from the engineer,

32
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,879
so he comes out here with a shotgun, shooting a few times into this Demoman's face.

33
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,879
Gets the final kill right there on that Demoman, and now they're trying to back up,

34
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,879
trying not to get themselves killed, because Jerma knows that this could be very, very detrimental to his health.

35
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,879
So he turns the corner, Crit Rocket gets him right in the body, and he tries to find a way backwards,

36
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,879
because he doesn't want to get himself killed. That Crit Rocket really shook him.

37
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:37,120
Nerves are high right now, nerves are skyrocketing.

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Blue Team is inches from the cart being capped. Inches, I mean absolute inches.

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,120
Jerma coming around the corner, this Soldier is still on the cart, they need to find a way to do this.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Another Heavy coming around to support Jerma and his Medic.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,120
The cart is getting closer to completion, Demoman is right here,

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Demoman is going to try and cap the point, Soldier is on the point, Pyro coming around the side here,

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Jerma just gets barely the kill on him, Medic goes down.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Now the cart is simply inches away from being capped, Jerma trying to think of a solution.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,120
There just is none at this point, he's going to come around here trying to get this done himself.

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Here comes the Cavalry, Jerma comes around here, Uber is right at the right particular moment,

47
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,120
he gets a great Uber charge, absolute fantastic placement.

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Turns out to be quite a bad idea though, because as you will see, he gets quite a few kills,

49
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,120
but that doesn't matter because take a look at the bottom of your screen,

50
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,120
the cart is inches away from being capped, the dreaded Soldier is now getting onto the cart,

51
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,120
take a look down at the bottom, it's going to be a close one guys, here it comes,

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,120
here comes the Soldier, what's going to happen, is he going to cap the cart?

53
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,120
He caps the cart, oh my goodness gracious, what an absolutely insane turn of events right there for the Red Team.

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Absolutely depressing, crushing defeat right there,

55
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Jerma is probably going to go listen to one of his favorite emo songs and cry himself to sleep tonight,

56
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,120
but we've got more important things to talk about like the cart coming through the corner.

57
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,919
This is the part where they, this is where they charge an Uber for a second, I guess.

58
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,800
Anyways, coming around here, Jerma sees a Soldier on the top right,

59
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,800
two medics healing him at this point right now, two medics count him, one and two.

60
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Focusing right now on complete and total area denial, this is a great strategy,

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,800
especially a double-heeled Heavy that's impossible to get by, no chance in hell or in heaven to get by him.

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Uber charge is almost at 95%, pretty much getting close to completion,

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,800
he's going to try and do something, try to make something happen, pulls out the gloves and running urgently,

64
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
here we go, pop the Uber baby!

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Jerma comes around here, gets the first Demoman with a shot in his mouth,

66
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,800
second Demoman has no chance in hell, third Demoman is right around the corner here,

67
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Jerma lights him up full of lead and then there's a Spy too, what's going to happen?

68
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Is this Spy going to be able to backstab any of these people?

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Potentially yes, because he got away, unfortunately.

70
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Jerma and his medic are now in very dire straits right now, behind the cart,

71
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,800
no teammates to back them up, no one to secure their position,

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
and now the Spy is getting away again.

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Here comes a Soldier, oh my goodness gracious, is the medic going to go down?

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Can he get the final shots on that Soldier? He cannot!

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,800
The Soldier is still spamming another Soldier now, the medic is going to go down,

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Jerma has nowhere to go, the medic is now down and now Jerma comes out here, kills both the Soldiers!

77
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Unbelievable performance, I can't believe it, and he just barely gets to hell too, unprecedented.

78
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,560
I hope you guys enjoyed this video, it took a little while to do this,

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,930
so thank you so much for watching, I get backstabbed right here in a second,

80
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,170
so I come around this corner, I get around to the side here,

81
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,170
but thank you so much for watching and I will see you next time,

82
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,170
and I hope you enjoyed this, take care everybody.
