1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
What is going on guys, it is Jerma bringing you a couple of gameplay commentaries.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,160
This is going to be a little different though. It's a new series I want to try and do

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,519
maybe like once or twice every month. I'm not going to do this all the time.

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,400
But it's a fun little change of pace, fun little different thing to do.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,960
Not, you know, do the same gameplay commentaries over and over again.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,559
This is called one life is the tentative term I'm going to, you know, use.

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,879
Basically, I'm only going to show you one life from maybe two classes in each one

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,579
because I don't want to go too long.

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,140
So this is going to be a demo man and a sniper gameplay huntsman sniper gameplay.

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,659
And I'm only going to show you the first life that I have the one life that I'm going to show you.

11
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,539
So without further ado, let's get started with the demo man.

12
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:45,840
I'm using the default sticky launcher, the lock and load and the Persian Persuader.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,759
I really like this setup. This has become my default demo man setup.

14
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,960
I used to hate the lock and load because I thought it was real counterintuitive

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,399
to the demo man's play style. You're losing that ability to launch

16
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,159
grenades across corners and hit people you didn't even know were there.

17
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,600
And I hate losing that.

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,599
But the precise direct hit style gameplay that you have with the lock and load

19
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,959
makes things a little more interesting.

20
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,879
So you're not this robot that's just shooting out bombs and grenades

21
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,530
everywhere without even thinking like a lot of demo man do.

22
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,890
So if you're one of those demo men that just shoot stickies and grenades

23
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,129
in random places, then watch this gameplay and pretend to know

24
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:24,370
that I think I know what I pretend that I know what I'm doing.

25
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,810
So anyways, make that medic pop over with a couple of stickies.

26
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,890
Long range boom on that sniper, which is the cool part about the lock and load

27
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,530
because you can kill half the classes in the game with one or two shots directly.

28
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,290
Make all these guys have to run back into spawn because it's spread out

29
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,730
among two or three of them.

30
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,450
This pyro runs right over one of my sticky crits.

31
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,569
Turn around, shoot the demo man in the face and a sniper headshots him.

32
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,090
So good job, sniper.

33
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,409
So I collect some health and come up the stairs.

34
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,609
Soldier gets taken up by the team and in comes an uber charge.

35
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:57,810
So I don't go head on.

36
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,329
I'm going to come from the side, collect a little bit of health and ammo,

37
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,760
turn around, shoot this demo man on the cart, get him with a nice direct shot.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,120
And now let's talk about the Persian Persuader and why I only have like three shots left.

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,199
But Jerma, didn't you just collect some ammo?

40
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,439
No, I did not because the Persian Persuader does not allow you to collect ammo.

41
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,979
The only way you can get it is from this, a dispenser.

42
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:26,500
But the huge upside to this weapon is the fact that all ammo collected on the ground

43
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,099
just becomes health.

44
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,699
So how many times have you been in a situation where there's a health pack somewhere

45
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,939
and somebody takes it and you're just sitting there like, oh shit,

46
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:35,219
now I got to sit here and wait for it.

47
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:36,819
I have like 40 health.

48
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:41,219
That is down the drain because you can just pick up the ammo box that's right next to it.

49
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,120
I whip out the lock and load here and I thought there was at least one shot in it,

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,639
but apparently not.

51
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,319
So I get myself killed and that's the one life as the demo man.

52
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,879
So now let's move on to the sniper.

53
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,520
I'm using a Huntsman, the Girardi and the Shashahashasha.

54
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,280
I will never know how to pronounce that.

55
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,120
I probably could just look at it and say the Shahenshah, but whatever.

56
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,169
I like the Shashahashasha.

57
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:07,889
So this is also on Badwater as you can see.

58
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:11,039
Using the Girardi on that group coming at the cart.

59
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,560
Take a shot at the heavy, completely miss and hit the medic behind him.

60
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,879
So I'm totally cool with that.

61
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,259
Somebody else comes up the cart here and I just shoot him right in the face.

62
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:25,199
Talking about the Huntsman now, the Huntsman, if you want to get better with the Huntsman,

63
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,199
if you say, Jerma, I don't know how to use the Huntsman.

64
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,319
How do you, how do you get so good?

65
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:28,879
What do you do?

66
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,120
Go play a game called Space Invaders.

67
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,800
The Huntsman is just Space Invaders in 3D.

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,039
That's pretty much all I need to say.

69
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,919
Just go play Space Invaders and you'll get better with the Huntsman.

70
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,580
I promise you that.

71
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,930
While we're on the subject, here's a little bit of TF2 trivia for you.

72
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,849
Robin Walker, who is the lead developer for TF2 and Valve, stated in an interview one time

73
00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:00,159
that his favorite item they ever made in TF2 was the Huntsman.

74
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,599
And to be honest, I think I completely agree with him.

75
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,979
Because I really can't think of another item that they've made

76
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:11,360
that's as interesting, as fun, as funny as the Huntsman.

77
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,520
And I don't even play Huntsman Sniper that often.

78
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,740
It's just, that's true.

79
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,620
Now a lot of you guys are going to debate the fact that I just said that.

80
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,980
That's fine, that's cool.

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,019
I'm just giving you a little bit of trivia about the game.

82
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:27,939
So let's get back to the gameplay so we don't start talking about like Flame Wars.

83
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,779
And no, Natasha's better.

84
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,339
No, the freaking Gordie Bomb's better.

85
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,860
No, that item isn't even in the game.

86
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,339
I don't even know what item I just tried to make up right there.

87
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:40,139
But anyways, they're trying to push the last point here.

88
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,699
Coming back to get some health because I don't think we have a medic on the team.

89
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,500
So I have to go back to this dispenser every time.

90
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,060
I peek around the corner, I get the timing right.

91
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,670
I get that soldier with a nice shot.

92
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,509
So just filling up my health.

93
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,110
Gonna turn this corner in a second here.

94
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,949
And I thought this scout was a spy.

95
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:58,110
I thought he was running slower than he really was.

96
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,870
But that's Pwanda.

97
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,430
And Pwanda, you made it into a gameplay.

98
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,709
You were asking me about this.

99
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:06,509
If you ever made it into a gameplay, if you were ever gonna be in one.

100
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:07,629
There you are.

101
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:11,069
So congratulations, Pwanda, you're in a gameplay.

102
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:12,370
Sick.

103
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,250
So anyways, I don't wanna go that way because I figured there was just too many people there.

104
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,810
So I'm gonna try and pick somebody off coming around this corner.

105
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,170
Or somebody that just is not paying attention and not looking into this room.

106
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,689
Just blind firing right now.

107
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,329
Trying to get somebody off guard.

108
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:30,689
I get this heavy but I don't headshot him so he doesn't die.

109
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:32,529
Even if I did headshot him, he was overhealed.

110
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:34,209
It probably wouldn't have killed him.

111
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,410
So I get this demo man.

112
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,779
He comes around the corner here and I boo right in his face.

113
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,699
And now I get a little greedy.

114
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:44,779
I'm trying a little too hard to get down into this little corridor.

115
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,620
Probably should have just stayed where I was.

116
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,779
But you know me, I'm an idiot.

117
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:50,459
So I end up hitting this demo man once.

118
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,459
But it's a body shot, no headshot.

119
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,180
This Pyro comes for me with Herp Derp Mega Man.

120
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,220
And I just get murdered.

121
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,699
And that's the one life as the sniper.

122
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,620
That is the end of the video, guys.

123
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,819
I hope you enjoyed it.

124
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,170
Like I said, this is just a small experiment I'm trying.

125
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,290
Try to change it up a little.

126
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,970
Try to give you guys new things.

127
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,410
If you liked it, please let me know.

128
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,170
I love to hear from you guys.

129
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,610
And by the way, thank you for over a thousand subscribers.

130
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,889
Never in my wildest dreams, guys, did I ever think that I would have

131
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,329
over a thousand people care about what I had to say.

132
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:22,850
So thank you so much.

133
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,050
See you soon.

134
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,610
Take care.
