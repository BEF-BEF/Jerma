00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:13,300
Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here with a live commentary. Just want to go

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,260
over a couple of things. I want to talk about the new changes to the existing

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,500
items and how they change them and what I think about it. I am really really

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,379
excited. I'm so happy about some of these two new changes guys. As you see there

5
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,579
I'm using the Widowmaker which is the new... I don't want to say new because

6
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:35,189
that's not really true. It's the new-ish shotgun and they find... oh my god I'm

7
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:37,950
going to... look at what I just did... going on an absolute tangent... oh my god

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,899
this is a century. I just killed three people... well two people with an assist

9
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:47,079
and I didn't have to reload and I had a million shots. It was amazing. This new

10
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,079
gun... what they did... let me tell you... if you're unaware they made the Widowmaker...

11
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,840
I'll show you... one, two, three, four, five, six. You can now shoot this gun six times

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,519
with 200 metal and even if you miss... if you miss once or twice it's okay. You're

13
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,159
probably going to be able to get seven or eight shots with this thing if you

14
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,920
miss a couple times. It's a great, great change. Oh my god I'm gonna get killed.

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,819
See this... three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... I just shot the gun nine

16
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,620
times without any reloads. That's more than the... what's the heavy one called?

17
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,900
The heavy shotgun... the family business. That's more shots than the family

18
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,310
business. The family business has eight and you have to reload it. Unbelievable

19
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,950
change. Hopefully I'm gonna try and go on a... some kind of tangent here. I'm not

20
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,069
even putting my sentry gun down. I'm being a real idiot. Oh it's on... this is

21
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:50,629
awesome. I'm so glad they did this. Oh what a backstab. So let me try this one

22
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:54,750
more time before I go into the other items. This is awesome. I'm so excited

23
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,590
that they did this because now I can unequip the Frontier Justice for a while

24
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,549
and use this. I'm not gonna say completely goodbye to the Frontier

25
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:07,659
Justice but at least for a while because they added this. This is so awesome. Okay

26
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:13,930
we're... there's a sentry over there. Oh my word. Let's see if I can pull this off.

27
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,219
There we go. Now notice how I have more metal than when I started with. What just

28
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,689
even happened? So I shot... I put down a mini sentry. I shot that Demoman two or

29
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:31,030
three times and I got back 40 metal. I'm pretty sure that it still gives you back

30
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,669
60 metal. So you shoot for 30 and you get back 60 if you land all the pellets on

31
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:40,830
somebody. So instead of before where you kind of was one for one, one for one. Let's

32
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,659
see here. Oh maybe not. It's 30 for 30. Okay. That's... that's still fine. That's

33
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,389
still awesome. I'm cool with that. So that's... I'm just so happy about this. Oh

34
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:55,310
they still have a teleporter up. Nice. Oh let's not... let's not reload one time and

35
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:01,139
just keep shooting this guy. Are you kidding me? Why is he not dying? What the

36
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:08,159
hell is going on? Are you serious? I haven't reloaded once. I haven't reloaded one time. Are you

37
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,759
kidding me? Why is this not being destroyed? Are you serious? What the hell just happened?

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,759
Why could I not destroy that teleporter? What the hell was that? Okay I want to

39
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:27,759
count after I'm done with this. I'm going to count. I think I shot like 30 rounds

40
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:34,759
in a row. Okay but don't ask me why that teleporter didn't go down. The engineer

41
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,439
must have been on the other side repairing it because that was pretty

42
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,539
ridiculous. I'm not gonna lie. That was pretty ridiculous. I think that's a spy

43
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:51,530
and maybe not. No it's not. I think there's a sentry over there. Nope. So you

44
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,650
guys get the idea. I'm gonna move on to the other items. Maybe see if I can get one

45
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,729
more kill. Nope. I'm gonna move on to the pyro and see if we can get something to

46
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:03,379
happen with the pyro. Oh nice black screen. So now please take a look at this.

47
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:09,000
The reserve shooter. You can now use it on the pyro. Very very cool. So let's see.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,099
I'm gonna use the degreaser to get the fast switch. So essentially what you want

49
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,699
to try and do is you want to blast somebody in the air, switch over real

50
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,540
quick and get the mini crits. I am gonna love this guys because if you know how I

51
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,860
play pyro I play only pretty much with the shotgun. Where did that spy go?

52
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,420
Because he's around here. I could test it out on him. Oh well. Well I could test it

53
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,730
out on this dude over here. Heavy right here. Let's see if I can get behind him

54
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:42,620
or screw around with him. See if this works. Oh it worked but just not enough

55
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,629
damage. Oh this is ridiculous. So I'm gonna I'm gonna really like this. I

56
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:50,589
probably shouldn't have gone after that heavy. Actually what do I do? Why do they

57
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:55,209
light them on fire? They don't have to be on fire. They just have to be in the

58
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:58,930
air. Okay I don't know. I'm kind of freaking out about that right now. I

59
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,250
shouldn't have lit them on fire. Should have just blown them in the air just to

60
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,839
confuse them. Because yeah it's just when they're in the air when you switch over.

61
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,540
Now I wish they added the engineer. I mean they obviously they changed the

62
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:20,209
engineer a little bit but oh my god. Oh boy. Can I? Oh my god. Come on. Come on.

63
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:30,920
Nothing up here right? Did I get him? Sort of. Sort of. You do only get the three

64
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,800
shots up but I'm not concerned about that. I should be fine with that. Oh that

65
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:46,019
was awesome. Oh I could have just crit it. Oh come on. Oh damn it. I'm getting too

66
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,699
I'm freaking out too much about trying to get people in the air. I need to just

67
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,879
play pyro. Obviously I don't play pyro that often but when I do play pyro I use

68
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,139
the shotgun. So this should be really interesting setup. I'm gonna try one more

69
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,660
time because I don't want this to really drag on. So I'm gonna try this one more

70
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,660
time and see what happens. But yeah very very exciting. And one of the other

71
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,540
changes I'm gonna show you guys. One of the new changes they added but they

72
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,540
didn't really talk about it. And not very many people are talking about it is they

73
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:18,459
nerfed into the ground. Okay here we go. There we go. It's not doing a whole lot

74
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:23,180
of not doing a whole lot of damage. Usually a point-blank shot like that.

75
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,860
Mini crit. That should have killed them. Try this one more time. Actually no.

76
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,959
Not gonna be able to. I'm gonna try it one more time. But something that nobody really

77
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,000
talks about is they nerfed the shortstop. They made it 50% slower for reload.

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,720
And we might be even changing maps. And if we do yeah I'll see you guys in two

79
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,189
seconds. Okay we are back and we are on upward now. I actually changed service

80
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:54,060
because that one was going to a weird map that I didn't really know. So I'm

81
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,459
gonna show you guys. I'm gonna try and get a kill with this to try and

82
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,259
demonstrate it. Obviously if you've seen my previous live commentaries you know

83
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,019
that I'm pretty much a monkey in a box when it comes to trying to play in live

84
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:09,459
com at the same time. Don't know what that analogy even really means but I

85
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:15,399
just kind of made it up. Oh come on do that again. Do it again. Oh boink. Oh my

86
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,420
god I'm gonna die. So yeah yeah like I said before if you know my live comms

87
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,339
you know that I pretty much cannot play and talk at the same time because my

88
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:28,990
brain, at least in first-person shooters, it's hard for me to do that. Oh my god.

89
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:38,759
There we go. Nice. And this guy I'm gonna die. Oh don't you jump in the air. Don't

90
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,180
jump in the air. I got the reserve shooter. That was pretty cool. All right

91
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:50,399
let's get another kill and then I'll move on. Oh damn damn damn. I need heals. I

92
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,720
need to be healed. So this is very very cool. I'm so glad that they still care

93
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,519
about balancing the game even if it takes them a long time. Sometimes it

94
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,279
takes Valve a fairly long time to balance things and yikes. All right let's

95
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,319
see if I can get behind these guys and really mess up their day. Oh health I'll

96
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,680
take you and ammo. Thank you very much. What am I doing? I was like oh let me get

97
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,399
behind him or just pretend to get behind them and oh jump in the air. Jump in the

98
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:28,300
air. Okay looks like he's building a sentry. Ah damn it. I'm in a lot of

99
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,139
trouble because he's just got a sentry over there now. Maybe oh come on let's

100
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:41,779
cause a little bit of confusion. Oh my god he's back. No I'm so dead. I'm so

101
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:49,159
dead. I need that health. There we go. God I'm just like the oh my god. It's over

102
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:54,809
for me. Come on health spawn. I'm gonna have to go around the other side. Oh god.

103
00:08:54,809 --> 00:09:02,019
Um can I reflect one of these rockets? No god. All right this is it. I'm gonna

104
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:07,460
change to the Scout just because this is kind of dragon. Oh goodbye. The question

105
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,159
is can I? No I'm screwed. Now it's over. All right I'm gonna change to the Scout

106
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,840
and show you guys the new change to the Scout. My god I have to put this on.

107
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:25,450
These don't really matter. Okay so the shortstop now as you can see. Let's see

108
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:32,500
one two three four. Oh man yeah the reload speed is 50% slower. It's a nerf

109
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,740
that nobody talked about. I'm gonna see if it really really affects gameplay.

110
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:42,049
Let's see this again. Yeah that's a lot slower. It used to be just pretty much

111
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:51,299
instant. Now it's about another couple seconds. Oh that yeah it's slow. That's

112
00:09:51,299 --> 00:10:01,899
pretty damn slow. No I'm gonna get killed. Oh god. I want to kill that engineer.

113
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:09,700
Yeah there's a there's a pretty obvious difference. I don't think it's I don't

114
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,289
think it's really game changing or anything but I just got critzed and I

115
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:25,039
didn't do anything. I gotta get rid of that sentry. There we go. I didn't even do

116
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:38,039
it. Oh no no. Oh you are done. Oh reload time you are so slow. There we go.

117
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:44,309
I guess it's not too bad. A lot of it's not as fast as it used to be of course

118
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:49,830
but it's not terrible or anything. No boy I need to get healed or find a medic.

119
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:59,299
I got milk. I got the milk. I'm fine and give me that health. Give me that health.

120
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:07,980
Give me that health. What? Oh alright so it's not that big of a deal. I thought it

121
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,970
was gonna be terrible. It's okay. What else did they change? Obviously besides

122
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:18,009
I have to show you this just because I have to. So here's a look at my heavy.

123
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:25,919
Look at how ridiculous he is. Look at how stupid he looks now. I'm so glad. Look at

124
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,200
this because they made the the mask a miscellaneous item. So I can look like a

125
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,980
scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz now. Alright I'm gonna just I'm gonna end it

126
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,899
here. Just wanted to get a video out showcasing the new stuff the new changes.

127
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,980
Obviously I can't go over all the hats because I mean hats. Hats are hats. You

128
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,860
guys know the deal about hats. So let's just end this by going on like a tirade

129
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,509
as a heavy as the scarecrow heavy. Yeah!

130
00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:02,149
Oh see you later sentry. I need a medic. I need a medic. Why I don't even know why

131
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:09,100
I have the shotgun equipped. I should have the sandwich equipped. Hmm hmm.

132
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:16,259
Oooh I can get rid of you. I can get rid of you. No I can't. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap.

133
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:22,769
Crap crap crap come on, and I'll get this one over here, and that engineer is

134
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:27,950
Next time hey next time he goes to get metal. It's all over for this century. Oh

135
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:38,730
Come on go get metal go get some metal. Oh, yeah, there's nothing you can do now

136
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:44,019
Except that soldier can kill me for sure. Oh, it's gone

137
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,940
ooh

138
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:53,379
Before he kills me gimme gimme all right. Maybe we can actually win this now here. We go time to drop down

139
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
Let's get on that cut

140
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,000
How did I not that was weird?

141
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:06,090
There we go there. We go got to get rid of you got to get rid of you

142
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:20,879
What what's going on? No? It's up there. No spy you bastard. Give me on the cart. Give me on the cart. Oh

143
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,620
Jumper's gonna cap it as heavy and now we got okay. Come on over here. Come on over. Oh

144
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,059
