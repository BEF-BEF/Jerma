1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:18,489
All right, throttle, handbrake, jump jets, grab rider. All right, so let's go, all right?

2
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:33,840
I guess so. I did not expect that to happen immediately once starting this video. What

3
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,479
is happening? Hi, everybody. My name is Jerma. Welcome to Road Redemption. This is a game

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:50,820
beat. My game is crashing. Jesus. Okay, hold on a minute. I need a second. I need to like

5
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:59,340
prepare for this. Well, I got like a gun. How do you shoot the gun? How do I shoot this

6
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:07,019
gun at this guy? Oh, well, I took a fucking beam in the face. I want to shoot this guy.

7
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:21,180
Oh dear god. What? What? How does? I thought. Oh, I did. Did I not die? I must not have died

8
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:28,859
from that. Okay. How do you shoot the weapon? I need to figure this out. Is it? There we go.

9
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:34,280
That's how you do it. All right, I figured it out. If I could only hit somebody with it,

10
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,819
that would be fantastic. But apparently that's not as easy as it looks. Especially when I'm

11
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:47,189
playing with a controller, which I probably shouldn't be doing. But I am going right here,

12
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:58,299
right here, right here. I'm going to get this guy. No, I got him. I won. I did it. Get out of my face.

13
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:12,490
Can I make, can I like jump over this? I got you. I got you. You let him fuck up. Let's go for a ride.

14
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:28,580
What is happening? How are we still driving? We're not on the course, isn't this?

15
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,669
My chest is going to cave in.

16
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:05,780
Oh, I only have 25. Put this down for a second.

17
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:15,289
All right, let's actually try to like win rather than just like throw up from laughing,

18
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,819
which is kind of hard to do. All right, I got this. I'm going to actually try to win,

19
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:34,120
not instantly die. This game is hilarious though. Without question. Get out of here.

20
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:46,039
Oh shit. I'll get him. Road rash. Road rage. Hey, what's up buddy? You want to get road raged?

21
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:54,069
You want to get, no shit. I was trying to hit you. I'm trying to hit this guy

22
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:57,909
and then I'm going to hit this guy too. Screw you buddy.

23
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:12,280
How much money have I made? I've made $150. That's good. That's a good amount of money to make for

24
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:23,740
just ramming into this shit. You know, it's a good day to make $150. What the fuck was that?

25
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:27,660
Did you see that? Hold on. I don't even care. I need to go watch it. No.

26
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,160
I want to go see the guy riding the car. Please tell me I can get back up.

27
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:42,389
I need to get back up there. Come on. Punch it. Punch it. There we go. That's what I'm talking

28
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:47,689
about. All right, there's no way I'm going to find that guy again. So I might as well just turn.

29
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:59,079
Okay, that was very loud. Apparently. I can drive up here, huh? Can I really drive up here?

30
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:10,420
Okay, I guess so. All right. We're going down the mountain. There's all the crash sounds.

31
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,939
Am I even driving the right way? See? There it was again. There it was again.

32
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,889
Somebody is riding a car. I need to figure out how to do that. That's really important.

33
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:48,360
If I can figure out how to do that. Okay, can I drive? Shit. Nitro. Nitro is kind of crazy.

34
00:05:51,860 --> 00:06:01,800
Just nitro again. Nitro. It's okay. I'm still alive. I can still do this.

35
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:14,439
Let's go, you son of a bitches. Total carnage. Oh, boy. Did you see how much stuff just got

36
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:29,399
crashed? Did you just see? Oh, my God. Seriously. This is like tactical intervention. I'm having

37
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:45,829
more flashbacks. Drive. Drive. So I have to attract cops? I already have like. Oh.
