00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:11,449
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight

2
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:15,529
I'm gonna be playing as the Soldier and a couple other things. It's just random clips of TF2 in the

3
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:21,050
background. Playing TF2 again. Yep, it's been a couple months, and then before that it was a

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,769
couple months, and then before that it was a couple months, but I got back into the game recently

5
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,850
because of this most recent update, the Gunmetal update, and that's what we're going to talk about

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,149
in this video. We're also going to talk about some other stuff too in the end, so this might be a

7
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:38,869
little bit longer of a commentary than I typically do, but let's talk about Gunmetal. It just came

8
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:43,020
out, brand new update yesterday. I think it's really awesome. There's a lot of great things

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,299
about it. I do have like one or two little reserves. Well, not reserves, but there are

10
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,840
just some things I wish they did differently. First of all, four new maps. That is something

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,689
we are not used to, especially one map that Valve made that's not in a beta. Why is this map not in

12
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:05,769
beta? And why are the other two maps still in beta? You know what I mean? Like the Cactus Canyon

13
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:11,000
still in beta. Who made this? Something's going on there. I don't know. I'm not going to pretend

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,120
to know the inside and outside of it, but it's a finished done Valve made map. It's called Power

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,439
House, and it's three control points. The first time they've ever really done that, so that's pretty

16
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:26,519
cool, and also there's a new map for each popular game mode, right? You've got a new King of the

17
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:32,280
Hill map, a new payload map, and a new control point map. Snowplow? They came up with Snowplow

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,120
too, out of left field. They just decided to release this? That's so odd. Like I thought they

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,079
didn't want to put Snowplow in this game. There's a lot of questions. There's a lot of questions

20
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,079
to ask about this update and why they did certain things, because if Snowplow is now an official

21
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,280
supported Valve map, why didn't they just make end of the line the Smithsmas update? Why didn't they

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,439
make those two coincide? If they were just going to put it in the game anyways, they probably could

23
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,319
have saved a lot of face by doing that, and I don't know what the reasoning behind putting it in the

24
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:09,319
game now is. It just seems like, oh, by the way, I guess it's not so complicated after all. You can

25
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:16,039
play it. Okay. Thanks. Whatever, though. It's in the game now, and it's fun. Snowplow is fun.

26
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:21,400
It might be different. It might be totally weird, but it's fun. It's a gigantic map. It's a huge open

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,080
playing field. Whatever. You might hate it. You might love it. It's in the game now, and it's

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,080
official. So there we go. We can move on from the maps. We can talk about the items. Well, not the

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,979
items per se, the item skins and how I feel about the contracts. I really like the contracts. The

30
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:39,979
contracts are probably the coolest part of this entire update. Really. I love the contracts. One

31
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:45,539
problem, though, after you do your two contracts, there's not a whole lot left to do for the update

32
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:52,099
because we only get two contracts a week, and each one of these contracts takes like 25 minutes

33
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:56,419
to do each one. So you end up doing all your contracts. Oh, I can't wait. Gonna play Spy.

34
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:03,289
Contract. Let's let it take. I just did it. It's over. I got my item. Okay. See you in seven days.

35
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:10,409
Now you contrast that to when Man vs. Machine came out. Imagine if Valve only let us do one tour a

36
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:15,349
week. I would have lost my fucking mind because when Man vs. Machine first came out, that's like

37
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:20,789
all I wanted to do. I just wanted to do tour after tour after tour. Good. Valve, take my fucking money.

38
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:24,310
Take my one dollar ticket. I don't give a shit. I want to play. I want to do the update. I want

39
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:30,090
to get involved and I want to do it. You can't really do that in this update. You spend six bucks

40
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,219
and it's just dragged out over the next three months, which that's cool. But in my personal

41
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:40,969
opinion, if you're going to have two contracts a week, those contracts should probably take a

42
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:45,780
little bit more time to complete. And even if they don't want you to keep getting items, maybe they

43
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,740
want to limit the amount of items people can get, then at least let us still be able to do contracts

44
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:56,419
and level up that coin after we get our first two items. I don't know. We'll see. This is very early.

45
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:00,900
It's a pretty interesting concept. I just really want to see more of it. That's I was starving to

46
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,449
do more, not less. And we're going to move on. They did a bunch of balance changes in this update,

47
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:11,289
a ton of them, and they're getting ready for competitive. It's pretty obvious based around

48
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:15,129
some of the changes they have. And there are a bunch, there are a million changes. So I really

49
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,410
don't want to go over them all because that would take another like 15 straight minutes for me to

50
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,009
talk about it. But I will bring up two things in particular. One, the big earner change. There are

51
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:28,170
now spy scouts that are going to be all over the place. I don't even want to know what some of you

52
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:33,290
comp level guys that play spy are going to do with that item now. And the other thing is what they

53
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:39,689
did to heavy. They made the Natasha and the brass beast have a 20% damage mitigation while you have

54
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:46,009
the gun spun down. So you can no longer insta kill headshot a heavy that's overhealed anymore. You

55
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:50,250
can't, you're gonna have to shoot the dude twice. That's a huge deal that change that I used to

56
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,689
hate playing heavy, because you turn the corner and be a fucking sandbag and insta die. Now,

57
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:59,930
as long as you have the overheal, you can at least react when you get that crit in the face,

58
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,889
you can try to move or get into cover or something. You're not just going to be

59
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,819
target practice for every sniper on the other team. But besides those two things,

60
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:13,019
I mean, everything else is really awesome and cool. I just it's so overwhelming when they do

61
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:18,790
valve likes to do this thing, right? Where instead of giving one or two balance changes every couple

62
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,110
weeks or something like that, or every week, they do like a tweak, they give us this giant

63
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:30,230
dump list of fucking like 500 changes. And it's like, all right, here you go. Here's every change

64
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,269
we've wanted to make to Team Fortress two over the last like three years. Okay, guys, take it and go

65
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,990
tell us what you think. It's a little overwhelming sometimes. So I'm doing it. I'm taking it as much

66
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,149
as everybody else is. And I'm trying to get as much information as I can to myself. So when

67
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:49,430
competitive rolls around, maybe I'll start playing competitive matchmaking. Of course I will. I've

68
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,699
been looking for reasons to get back into this game. And with competitive looming, and the recent

69
00:05:54,699 --> 00:06:00,699
contract stuff, I have reasons to play. That's been the big deal for me in Team Fortress two.

70
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:05,560
I haven't had reasons to want to play. I don't know how they're going to flesh out. We'll just

71
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,199
have to wait and see. But that's going to wrap up the update portion of the video and my thoughts

72
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,800
and all that jazz. Now we're going to talk about a life update. So the next like two or three minutes

73
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,970
is going to be me talking about a life update. How exciting. So what's this big life update?

74
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,649
What's happening here? What do you mean? Oh, there's a life update. Would you stub your toe again?

75
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:30,470
No, I bought a place and I'm moving. In the last couple of months, at least the last like two or

76
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:36,230
three months has been extremely hectic. Trying to juggle everything that's going on, getting

77
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:42,310
financing for this place, finding it in the first place, and moving everything in because it's empty.

78
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,269
And it's been taking a wreck on my brain. It hasn't been all that smooth of an experience,

79
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:53,189
but it really never is, is it? Anytime you move out of a place, you buy something new. It's just

80
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:57,189
all the shit you have in your old house, all the stuff you have to bring to the new one. Are you

81
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:00,790
going to get new furniture? Are you going to buy a new fridge? Are you tearing up a couple floors?

82
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:08,410
Are you painting walls? Is the place on fire right now? Is the place on fire right now? I don't know.

83
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:14,649
I'm not there. There is no discernible way for me to say or not say the place is or is not on fire

84
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:20,870
right now. These are the things that go through my head when I'm sitting here, not at the place

85
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,269
because I obviously haven't moved in yet, but you just stress out over random shit that you don't

86
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:29,430
need to stress out over. You just got to take it slow. Everybody I've talked to said anytime

87
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:35,430
you buy a place, do one thing at a time. You don't got to go bring a cot in and live there

88
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:42,500
immediately. You just get things situated, get ready, and then live, baby. Live. And we transition

89
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:49,860
talking about how I'm moving into the fact that now I want to stream pretty much every single day.

90
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,600
Once I actually get all moved in somewhere in the middle of August, I want to stream at least four

91
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,420
or five times a week. This is something that I've wanted to do for a long time, but I've never been

92
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,699
able to get my ducks in a row in my brain and my body in the right position to be able to do this

93
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:11,980
thing. I love the idea of streaming. I love just hanging out and playing games with whoever shows

94
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,899
up, whatever game I happen to be playing. It's something that I really want to do, and I'm going

95
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:22,779
to try it at my fullest ability the second that I moved into this place and everything's ready to go.

96
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:28,649
So this is like update video and hey I'm moving and stream announcement video all in one. So

97
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:33,049
that's going to wrap it up. Take care everybody. See you all soon. Enjoy the new Team Fortress 2

98
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:36,409
update. It's going to be so much fun. I can't wait. Now here this is this is the part of the video

99
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,450
where it goes BOO!
