00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,630
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a new Little Gems.

2
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,629
Now, this has been a long time since the last Little Gems, and I do apologize for that.

3
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:23,629
But, I finally got the hardware necessary to be able to record off my iPad.

4
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:30,629
If you followed this series, you'll know I had a lot of problems with trying to get games off the iPad, off the iPhone, and Android.

5
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:33,939
It was a real journey, we'll just say that.

6
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:38,939
And if you're wondering what I'm using, what capture device I'm using, I'm using a Game Capture HD.

7
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,939
It's from Elgato. Very easy to set up, very easy to use, and it works like a charm.

8
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:49,939
As you're seeing on the screen, you can actually see this iPad footage, and the sound is included, so two big thumbs up to Elgato.

9
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:53,939
And with that, we are going to move on here and talk about Spellsword.

10
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,750
So what Spellsword is, it is an action adventure platforming RPG death arena game.

11
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,750
That is a mouthful, but let me just compare this to a game that already exists.

12
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,750
Super Crate Box. If you like Super Crate Box, you will absolutely love this game.

13
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,750
Now, replace the gun mechanic in Super Crate Box and use these card mechanics and a sword in Spellsword.

14
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,250
So the game breaks down like this. There are four maps to choose from.

15
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,250
Each one of these maps is going to have 20 levels to play on, and an endless mode.

16
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:33,739
Now, obviously, you cannot complete endless mode. Endless mode is just for you to play on and last as long as you can,

17
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:36,739
defending yourself from waves and waves and waves of these enemies.

18
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,739
And you get money as well, but we'll talk about money later.

19
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:45,049
But when you load up a regular level, 1 through 20, it's going to give you a certain specific task.

20
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:51,049
Whether that be kill a certain amount of enemies to complete the zone, or collect a certain amount of these cards,

21
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:56,049
or last a certain amount of seconds, anything like that is going to be your objective.

22
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:01,420
When you load up one of these missions. So how do you kill enemies? What do you do? What's the actual point?

23
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,420
Why is the game called Spellsword? Well, let's get into the card mechanics.

24
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:12,419
In each level, there's going to be random spawns of these cards. All you have as a weapon is just a sword.

25
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:18,419
You can slash enemies, it does damage, but the real way to kill these enemies and the real way to progress in the missions

26
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,419
is to collect these cards and to upgrade these cards.

27
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:26,849
There's no activation button, you just simply touch them and they will do their ability.

28
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:32,849
And the abilities range from ice shields and ice lances, to fireballs that cover the whole screen,

29
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,849
to invisibility and invulnerability, there's a lot here.

30
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:39,849
And it just happens to randomly pop up on the screen.

31
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:44,849
You cannot decipher what card is going to come up, it just is going to come up and you have to grab it.

32
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:50,150
Now this makes for some really, really good chaotic gameplay, where you are constantly jumping around,

33
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,150
double jumping, grabbing this card, grabbing that card, oh fire bomb, oh my god, poison cloud.

34
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,150
It gets really, really hectic, which is the best part about the game.

35
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,150
It's just so much fun in its little chaotic atmosphere.

36
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:08,150
And on top of all of this, there is an entire upgrade system and item system in this game.

37
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,150
There are hats in this game, you heard it here, there are hats in this game.

38
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,150
So that should be enough for you to go download it.

39
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,150
Anyways, there is an entire upgrade tree, where you spend money that you get from doing missions,

40
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,150
from killing enemies, they're little rupees they land on the ground, you've probably seen them in the video.

41
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,650
And you use that money to buy upgrades to your various things, and it's so addicting.

42
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,650
I have spent a lot of time in this game so far, and I still, there's a lot of things I have not upgraded.

43
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,650
It takes a lot of money in the later levels to upgrade some of these cards to their fullest.

44
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,949
But you are going to need it though, if you plan on doing any endless mode stuff,

45
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:47,949
there are three different difficulties on the endless mode, it's easy, normal, and hard.

46
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:52,949
And if you want to do hard, and you want to last a long time, you're going to want these upgrades.

47
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:55,189
It's going to help you immensely.

48
00:03:55,189 --> 00:04:00,189
But now let's talk about the price point of this game, and is it worth it, should you go download it right now?

49
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:05,189
The answer is yes, because just recently, this game went free to play.

50
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:13,189
This game is a free download right now for iPad and iPhone, it's on the iTunes store right now, and it is an absolute steal.

51
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:18,189
I highly recommend this game, if you like these quirky little action RPG type games,

52
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:22,189
where you kill a lot of things, you upgrade a lot of stuff, then this is the game for you.

53
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:27,560
Also, because the game just recently went free to play, they introduced a monetized system,

54
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,560
so there's now an in-game store where you can buy rupees, you can buy these things called dragon coins.

55
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,740
They added a lot of stuff in this 1.1 update they did not too long ago.

56
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,740
But that's going to wrap up the video guys, thank you so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.

57
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,740
And go have fun with this game, it's free baby!

58
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,740
And I'll see you guys all next time, and of course, take care everybody.
