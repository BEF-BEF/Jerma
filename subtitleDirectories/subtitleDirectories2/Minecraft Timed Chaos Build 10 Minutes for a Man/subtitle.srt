1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,690
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here, and...

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,990
MLC stuff! Hey guys!

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,300
Woohoo! Today, we're going to do something a little bit different.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,300
We're going to do a Minecraft timed build.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:22,600
And I know we're not the best Minecraft players in the world, but that's why we think it might be actually pretty interesting.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,839
So, how is this going to work?

7
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,839
We're going to give ourselves 10 minutes timed. It'll be on the screen.

8
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,839
And whatever we build in 10 minutes, we're going to try and build a person.

9
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,020
That's today's episode.

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,250
So, whatever we come up with... What are you doing? Hello?

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,250
Whatever we come up with is what we're going to end with, so let's see what happens, okay?

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,490
So, I have the timer ready right here.

13
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:51,799
And in a few seconds, we're going to start building a person.

14
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:57,799
So, in the comments section, before we get started, in the comments section, let us know how well we did and something else for us to build.

15
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,799
I want to try and make this a weekly thing. So, are you ready?

16
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,980
Yeah, I've never played Minecraft before.

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,980
Like, in browser Minecraft.

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,659
Let's see how bad I am.

19
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,659
Okay. And we're starting now. Go.

20
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,969
You build the leg. I'm building the right leg.

21
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:19,969
Okay. Let's make sure... I have the worst creative mind.

22
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:21,969
I'm the worst at drawing things.

23
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:23,969
Build... We only got 10 minutes here.

24
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:28,269
Build four squares. Four squares going up.

25
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:30,269
You absolutely can't tell me how to build my leg.

26
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:32,269
It's going to be, like, symmetrical.

27
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:34,579
Okay, hold on. Let me see this here.

28
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:38,819
Yeah, he needs a red shoe. Hold on. We need to put that on him.

29
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:43,060
Hey, details come later. We got to get, like, the structure down first.

30
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,510
Dude.

31
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,510
All right. How high is yours?

32
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,750
Dude, already, like, one minute is almost gone by.

33
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,750
We don't even have his, like, legs.

34
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,930
Okay, hold on. Match it up. Match it up. Okay.

35
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,930
So, that's your legs.

36
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,930
He's going to be like...

37
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,930
Go one higher. Now we connect the legs.

38
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,300
No. Connect them now.

39
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,300
Yeah.

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,300
Just...

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,300
Oh, my God. This is the worst person ever.

42
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,300
He's not doing the splits. Look how far away his legs are.

43
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:26,860
We don't have enough time to, like, do this now, so...

44
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,860
All right. Now we need, like, the pants end, and it has to come, like...

45
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,860
Look at how skinny this guy is.

46
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,860
Hold on. It needs to be... Oh, God.

47
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,860
No, this is, like, his belt buckle right here.

48
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,860
Hold on. Okay, you build the belt.

49
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,860
I'm going to try and build, like, to make it so he's not, like, a freaking stop sign.

50
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,740
This guy is, like, as wide as a stop sign.

51
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,740
All right. I'm building his belt buckle.

52
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,050
Looks like he's wearing a diaper. Hold on.

53
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,050
We got, like, Tommy Pickle here.

54
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,490
Oh, man. This is so stupid. Oh, God.

55
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,490
What is... Why are you building...

56
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,490
That's his belt.

57
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,490
Okay, cool. Cool. Cool.

58
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,490
All right. Two minutes have gone by.

59
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,110
Oh, dear.

60
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,610
We got... I keep on, like, falling.

61
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,610
All right. While you do that...

62
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,610
Well, okay. I'm going to build his other shoe.

63
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,849
What did you do? Red?

64
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,849
Or red blocks.

65
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:20,849
Most simple shoe ever.

66
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,750
Drop down. How many blocks did you do?

67
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,759
That's a... Oh, God.

68
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,939
All right. So he's got his shoes.

69
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:36,310
He's got... He look... What does he look like?

70
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, my God. He looks like a Dig Dug character.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
All right. We need... Okay, we got his belt.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Now we need his shirt.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Orange blocks. Orange blocks.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,240
Yep.

75
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Orange blocks. Okay.

76
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Why is he, like, so...

77
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,240
What's with that thing at, like, back here?

78
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Did I not, like, make his belt long enough?

79
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
No. I... Because he was, like...

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
I told you he was, like, a thin bastard.

81
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
He had to be, like, a little bit bigger.

82
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
All right.

83
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
All right. We're good. We're good.

84
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,669
We got this. We got this.

85
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:04,669
Time. What's the time?

86
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:08,699
Three minutes. We're good.

87
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:12,419
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,300
Oh, God.

89
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,300
He, like, pooped in his pants.

90
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,300
Why is his pants so low?

91
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,470
I know. I know.

92
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,470
He really, like, pooed his pants.

93
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,779
His body needs to be way bigger than this.

94
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,779
Ugh.

95
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:29,779
Watch out. Get out of the way.

96
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,779
I'm sorry. Oh, I dropped my blocks on the ground.

97
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:34,779
Go on. Go on.

98
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:38,410
Go, go, go, go, go.

99
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,410
Why did he poop his pants?

100
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,410
That's something we can fix later.

101
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,410
His body needs to be at least twice the size of his, like...

102
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,410
He's gonna be, like, a weird freak.

103
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,410
His legs and his, like, butt are bigger than his body.

104
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,410
Like, are you kidding me?

105
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,579
Well, he could, like, make a perfect character,

106
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:55,579
like, on Hey Arnold or something,

107
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,579
where they always, like, already have screwed up proportions.

108
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:58,579
All right. All right.

109
00:04:58,579 --> 00:04:59,579
Dude, we gotta get it.

110
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:00,579
We gotta get away from the body.

111
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:01,579
Four minutes have gone by.

112
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:03,579
We have, like, a lot of detail work to do.

113
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,889
Should we start the arms?

114
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,259
Finish what you're doing. I'm gonna start the arms.

115
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:11,259
He's just wearing a sweatshirt, right?

116
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,500
The arms are gonna come out, like, two or three blocks,

117
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
and then they're gonna go forward.

118
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Wait, didn't we decide his skin was gonna be orange

119
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
and he was gonna have green pants?

120
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
He's shirtless. He's shirtless.

121
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,670
He's shirtless.

122
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,670
It's like summertime. He's, like, in his bathing suit.

123
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,670
All right, so come out. Let's see.

124
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,360
One, two...

125
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,300
All right.

126
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,300
One, two, three, four.

127
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,300
Come out four blocks.

128
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,610
And then go forward.

129
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,410
Go forward two.

130
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,410
What if I give someone a hug?

131
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,410
Yeah, he's trying to give someone a hug.

132
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,029
What is that, like, vanilla wafer?

133
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:53,029
Hey.

134
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,269
Let's, uh...

135
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:57,769
It's so hard to, like, stay afloat.

136
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:59,769
Oh, so I did my arm proportion wrong.

137
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:02,579
All right, whatever. Just go.

138
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,459
Okay, I'm trying to look and see what we got here so far.

139
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:08,829
What did you do here?

140
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:10,829
That's his poop.

141
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,829
Wait, he's fa...

142
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:15,329
That's the front of his pants?

143
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:17,329
That doesn't make any sense.

144
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:19,329
Why are you fixing it?

145
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,329
Because this is his forward. That's his, like...

146
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:23,329
When you poop in your pants, I'm sure it covers the front of your pants, too.

147
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:27,360
Okay, I'm gonna start on his head.

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,240
No, he needs to be wearing, like, a necktie or something stupid

149
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
to make it, like, so we can see where his head is.

150
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,180
All right, he's wearing...

151
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,360
This is, like, necktie.

152
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,620
Oh, Spongebob Squarepants, like, tie?

153
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,620
That's just that big?

154
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,620
There, that's good.

155
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,620
No, no, no. It's gotta be, like...

156
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,620
That's where, like, it looks like a tie.

157
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,620
I just broke his belly.

158
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,620
All right, good.

159
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,620
Now he's wearing a scarf, apparently.

160
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,620
Building a snowman, hold on.

161
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,620
We gotta add, like, the three...

162
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,620
Almost six minutes, dude.

163
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,399
We gotta, like, clean this up.

164
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,300
Oh, wrong button.

165
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,300
That's as good as...

166
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Look at his, like, cocked to the side neck.

167
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,300
We need his eyes.

168
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,800
Okay, okay.

169
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Did you give him, like, obsidian...

170
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Those are nipples.

171
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,360
It looks like armpit hair.

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Armpit hair, like, on his chest.

173
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Okay, we're gonna give him these for eyes.

174
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
I don't even know what this is, but this is his eyes.

175
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,180
This is, like... Hold on.

176
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,490
All right, all right.

177
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,490
No, we need more... What is that?

178
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,730
What's that?

179
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,730
Oh, all right, all right. I see where you're going here.

180
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,420
Or I was just thinking mouth.

181
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,420
He needs fingers.

182
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,420
He can't just have these, like, sticks coming out for hands.

183
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:57,779
There's one finger.

184
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,459
There's two fingers.

185
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:02,829
There's another one.

186
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:07,060
There's another one.

187
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,060
Oh, great, like, alien claw fingers you made him.

188
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,060
Is he, like, the machine you get the toys out of?

189
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
What is he doing over here?

190
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,490
It looks like he's in the middle of a dance move.

191
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,490
He's like,

192
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,490
Yeah, let's do this.

193
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,490
All right, keep it going.

194
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,490
He needs... What else does he need? He needs hair.

195
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,049
Over seven minutes now.

196
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,419
All right, cool.

197
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,419
What color is his hair? How about...

198
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,779
Do we have, like, brown or something?

199
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,779
Brown wool. There we go.

200
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:43,279
Oh, it's going like nighttime.

201
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,279
I know.

202
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,279
We don't have any light here.

203
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,100
Whoops.

204
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
I'm giving him, like, a chef's hat

205
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
of brown hair.

206
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,399
What else can we do to him?

207
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
He looks like a total dumbass.

208
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:11,379
It's like

209
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:13,379
Chef Boy ID, the Pringles guy,

210
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:15,379
and, like, Spongebob Squarepants

211
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:17,379
had a baby.

212
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:19,379
And, like, this is him.

213
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:21,379
I was thinking Mr. Krabs a little bit.

214
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:24,379
All right, we only got, like,

215
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:26,379
a minute and a half left.

216
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:28,379
Let's clean him up a little bit.

217
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:30,940
We gotta give him a name, too.

218
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,500
Fix his hand.

219
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
This hand is such an atrocity.

220
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Both hands are.

221
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
My, like, Minecraft is starting to lag.

222
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:43,809
I don't even know how hands work.

223
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:45,809
I'm opening my hand

224
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:47,809
right now, looking at it,

225
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:49,809
to try and, like, see what it looks like.

226
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:51,809
Okay, so this has to come out, like...

227
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:54,370
No, crap. I'm just standing here.

228
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,370
What am I doing? I'm giving him, like, a cane.

229
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,370
I'm looking at my hand again.

230
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,500
We're almost at nine minutes now.

231
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Oh, great, great, like, bedpan hand

232
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
I gave him. Like, yeah, that's, like, fantastic.

233
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Nice, like, skillet hand I gave him.

234
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,580
Oh, my God.

235
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,580
All right, feet. I forgot. We, like, have to come back to these

236
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,580
to make these better.

237
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,580
No. Dude, do your, like,

238
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,580
pants turn into your feet?

239
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,580
No, the boot has to come out like this.

240
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Like, here we go, here we go.

241
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Nice, like, Yoshi we made.

242
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,570
Super Mario Brothers.

243
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,570
And crab cakes.

244
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,139
Make it a little bit higher up here.

245
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,139
All right, crunch time. We've got about 30 seconds.

246
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,820
30 seconds to make this the best Minecraft

247
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,190
build ever.

248
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,190
This shoe is way too long.

249
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,899
We got, like, goofy.

250
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,899
An extremely goofy movie here.

251
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,590
Actually, I kind of like this character.

252
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,279
All right, what else? Make the tie,

253
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,279
short the tie a little bit. This is casual

254
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,029
Fridays. Make this, like,

255
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,210
that. No, that looks

256
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,580
like a tongue. And we're

257
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,580
coming down to, like, the final few seconds.

258
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,580
Three, two,

259
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
one, it's over.

260
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,820
There it is. Ten minutes.

261
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,000
And here he is, the

262
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
freak show.

263
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,429
So we've got to give him a name now. What's his name?

264
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:25,169
I don't know. How about, like,

265
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:28,940
Greg? Oh, hold

266
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,940
my line. He just, like, left the game.

267
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,940
Hey, you crashed at the perfect

268
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,940
time. I didn't want you to name our creation.

269
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,250
But in the comments section for anybody watching

270
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,250
this video, go ahead and give this guy a name.

271
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,250
As well as a rating.

272
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,250
Like, as to how well we did.

273
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,379
Like, one out of ten. So, still a one to ten.

274
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:48,379
How well did we do with this guy?

275
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:51,070
And I think that's going to be it, guys. So,

276
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,070
again, leave in the comments what you think we should do

277
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,070
for the next build. And, yeah.

278
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,629
Take care, everybody. And, Stealth, you got

279
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:59,629
anything to say? Yeah, just

280
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,629
take care, everybody.
