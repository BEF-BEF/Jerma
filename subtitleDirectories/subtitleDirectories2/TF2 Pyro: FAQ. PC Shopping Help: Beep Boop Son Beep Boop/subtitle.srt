00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:16,100
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary and tonight.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,100
Gonna be playing as the Pyro with the Degreaser. I think this is a strange Degreaser.

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:27,100
The Who... Extinguisher? No, it's the Postal Pummeler. It is the reskin of the Extinguisher.

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,410
And the Vintage Flare Gun.

5
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,409
So this video, what I want to talk about is something that's gonna be really important to a lot of you guys.

6
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,409
And it's a question I get very often in PMs and comments.

7
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:41,409
And I want to answer it in a little bit more detail because I feel like when I answer these things in comments.

8
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:44,409
I'm just like, you need a good graphics card.

9
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:49,409
But I want to get into more detail if you are new to PC gaming.

10
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,969
Or you just don't know what to do if you don't have a good computer.

11
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,969
Now this little video is not going to cover how to make every single game run on your computer.

12
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:03,969
Because PCs and PC gaming in general is very, very weird.

13
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:09,969
There's a very large spectrum of what's going to work and what's not going to work on your computer.

14
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:14,969
So I guess this is going to be more of a general just buyer's guide when you go buy and shop for a computer.

15
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:18,340
Because there's a lot of companies that are trying to rip you off.

16
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,340
Now I'm not going to mention any specific brands or specific companies.

17
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,340
Mostly because I don't want to get myself in any trouble if it happens to be like,

18
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,340
Whoa, why did you make that video about my company? I'm going to kill you.

19
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,700
Hopefully they don't do that. But you get the idea.

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,700
And it's this, by the way, when you're done with this.

21
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,700
Let's say you go, you follow this advice and you go get a computer from Best Buy or something.

22
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,700
And you come back and you try and load up Battlefield 3 with every single setting on Ultra.

23
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,700
And you have like nine different programs running in the background and you're not getting 195,000 frames per second in Battlefield 3.

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,069
That is not what this is made for.

25
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:55,069
All right, now that's out of the way. Let's talk about what I'm actually going to talk about in this video.

26
00:01:55,069 --> 00:02:02,069
And it's going to be how to buy a computer, how to go shop for a computer, what to get, how to know what you want to get, et cetera, et cetera.

27
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:08,310
One thing, the first thing I want to tell you guys about buying a new computer is money does not equal better.

28
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,310
That's a huge thing you need to remember. Money does not equal better.

29
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,310
So what I mean by that is when you go to a computer store, if you go to Best Buy, you go to Walmart, you go to the Micro Center,

30
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,310
anywhere that sells computers, whether it be laptops or desktops, if you see a price tag,

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,310
if let's say there's two computers sitting right next to each other, one of them is $1,200 and the other one is $950.

32
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,310
Don't automatically assume that the one that is more expensive is going to be better than the one that is less expensive.

33
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:42,310
A lot of times you're going to be paying for brand names or you're going to be paying for markups that these companies do.

34
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,310
I really don't know what reason. If I could give you a reason, I would give it to you.

35
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:54,310
But a lot of these companies have much more expensive computers with literally the exact same product inside the case.

36
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:00,310
Now this, I could tell you a million different examples, but there are so many because there are so many computer companies.

37
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,310
There's a lot of custom builders. There's a lot of different variables in this.

38
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:11,810
So I'm going to just keep it pretty vague and say if it's a lot of money, don't automatically assume that it's the best computer you could ever have.

39
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,810
So with all of that in mind, let's talk about the three things.

40
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,810
That's right. There's only three things you need to look for when you're buying a gaming computer.

41
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:26,810
That is the CPU, the memory, and the graphics card. Everything else is pretty much useless to you.

42
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:34,810
If you want a gaming computer and you don't really care about anything else, those are really the only three important things you got to look for when you're buying a computer.

43
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,050
And the first one is going to be the CPU. So let's talk about that for a second.

44
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,050
CPUs. You don't really need a crazy CPU to run most modern games.

45
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:58,050
Now, I would probably say in the last five years, if you have a CPU that's either a dual core or a quad core that was made in the last four or five years, you can run any game at pretty much medium to high quality.

46
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:03,050
You don't need a six core processor to run Team Fortress 2. It's just unnecessary.

47
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:12,349
I would probably recommend getting something like an Intel i5 over an i7, only because the reason why I say this is if you're just getting a computer to game on,

48
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:17,350
if it's going to be your console that's not a console, you don't really need an i7.

49
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,350
i7s are more designed for heavy rendering and heavy video editing and photo editing and stuff like that.

50
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,350
But if you have that in mind, if you're going to do that, then by all means, I would start looking at some i7s.

51
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:35,660
So the second thing on the list is really not that important when it comes to gaming, but it is in some ways, and that is RAM.

52
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:41,660
So RAM, I can spend less than 10 seconds on RAM. As long as you have somewhere around four to eight gigs of RAM,

53
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,660
you have more than enough for any game that is out right now and any game that's probably going to be out in the next couple years.

54
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:55,829
And for a frame of reference for you, I only had six gigs of RAM up until about four or five weeks ago when I did my recent computer upgrades.

55
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:01,829
So it's really not that important. As long as you're hovering somewhere around six, you will be totally fine.

56
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:07,519
So finally, the last thing which is going to take the most amount of time in this video is the graphics card.

57
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,079
Now, this is where companies like to really screw people.

58
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:17,079
So graphics cards in general, if you don't know, you don't need a graphics card in your computer to run your computer.

59
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:25,319
You can have something called integrated graphics, which is what 85% of every computer that is ever built or ever sold has.

60
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,319
And integrated graphics have come a long way in the last five or six years or so,

61
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,620
but they cannot even hold a candle to a dedicated graphics card.

62
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,620
And this is kind of where I have a problem with some of these stores that sell computers and really computer selling outlets in general.

63
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,620
Nobody ever tells you this. Nobody ever cares to let you know that, oh, by the way,

64
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,620
if you plan on doing anything multimedia related, that's intense.

65
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,860
It's not going to happen because this computer is not going to be able to handle it.

66
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,860
Nobody likes to put that sign there or that tag on the machine.

67
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,860
They just want you to buy the computer.

68
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,860
And let's face it, a mainstream audience that's not gaming related doesn't really care about graphics cards.

69
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,860
And they're willing to spend the seven to eight hundred dollars on a computer that's much worse than one they could potentially have

70
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,860
if they either built it themselves or did a little bit of research.

71
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,100
And that's what this video is all about. This is my PSA to you guys.

72
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,100
It's really the whole reason why I made the video.

73
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Do a little bit of research before you buy any computer, even if you're going to buy it online or you're going to do a custom builder or something.

74
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Just look around. Don't just walk into a store and ask the guy behind the counter.

75
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Hey, give me a good computer. I have a thousand dollars.

76
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:38,100
It's you really need to do research because a lot of these people are going to try and sell you either a bunch of crap you don't need

77
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,100
or a bunch of crap you did need, but you didn't get it.

78
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,100
And that's really the whole point of this whole thing is make sure you are educated.

79
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,100
Make sure you find out. Does this computer have a graphics card?

80
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Let's say somebody's trying to sell you something. You get a salesman.

81
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,100
He's like, oh, yeah, this computer is top of the line. It's got an i7. It's got a bunch of memory.

82
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,100
It's fantastic. And the first question you ask this guy is this.

83
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,100
Does this computer have a dedicated graphics card?

84
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,339
And he's going to go, no, but, um, you know, yeah.

85
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:09,339
And you can catch him off guard right there because a lot of people don't expect that question.

86
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,339
They don't expect you to ask them that.

87
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:18,339
So make sure you keep in mind that you don't want to spend a ton of money on something that you're not going to get the full potential of.

88
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:21,029
So that is going to wrap up this video, guys.

89
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,029
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

90
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:27,029
And hopefully some of this information could help you guys be better computer buyers

91
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:31,029
or better shoppers in your destination of your computer greatness.

92
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:33,209
So, yeah, I'll see you guys all soon.

93
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:36,209
And, of course, take care, everybody.
