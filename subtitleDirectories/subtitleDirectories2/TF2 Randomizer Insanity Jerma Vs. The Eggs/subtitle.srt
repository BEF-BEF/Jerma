00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,160
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,160
And what is going on on the screen right now?

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,339
This is Randomizer. If you don't know what Randomizer is, this is a crazy mod for Team Fortress 2.

4
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:28,339
And what it does is it makes you spawn with a random class and a random loadout.

5
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:33,340
And I don't mean a random loadout like as in you spawn as the heavy and you get a random heavy loadout.

6
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,340
No, no, no, no, no, no. You spawn as the heavy with a flamethrower and like the Jarate.

7
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,340
It's crazy. I suggest you try and find a server. Sometimes it's hard to find a Randomizer server.

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,340
But if you can get in one, my god, this is like the funniest goddamn thing I've ever done in this game.

9
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,770
And the reason why it's so funny is because everything just gets so broken.

10
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,770
You'll see coming up later, I play as the soldier with a Tomislav.

11
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,770
And whenever you shoot the thing, your Tomislav goes up and down a hundred miles per hour.

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,769
It is insane. It almost made me want to, I had, I got a headache.

13
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:09,769
I had to stop doing it. I was like, okay, I want to die with this class.

14
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:13,939
Screw this. And really this last, I'd say last three or four days,

15
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:17,939
I've just been going into Team Fortress and playing these crazy mods.

16
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,939
One of the mods, one of the favorite ones, my goodness, Balloon Race.

17
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,939
I've only found one or two servers that actually play Balloon Race.

18
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:29,939
And I want to play them all day now. I got to get some more guys into there.

19
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,939
Got to get more awareness to Balloon Race because it is so much fun.

20
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:35,939
And also all crit servers, I've been doing that too.

21
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,939
So I've been being a real weirdo on Team Fortress lately.

22
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,939
Expect some videos on some of these crazy mods.

23
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,939
I'll probably do a Saxton Hale mod, probably do Prop Hunt.

24
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,939
So expect those at some point in the future.

25
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,939
It's just something I've been having a lot of fun doing.

26
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,700
So now I want to go on a different track.

27
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,700
And I want to talk about a certain bet that I made with you guys.

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,700
Probably a week or two ago when I did the face cam video.

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,700
All I've been seeing is comments telling me I got to eat the egg.

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,700
Where's the egg? I got to eat that damn egg.

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,000
So if you missed the video or to refresh your memory, this is what I said.

32
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:34,949
So judging by what happened in the video, I have to eat an egg.

33
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:37,949
And I did say in that video, I did say to eat a raw egg.

34
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,949
I was going to eat a raw egg.

35
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:42,949
But guys, you can't eat raw eggs.

36
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:45,949
If you eat a raw egg, I mean, it's not terrible.

37
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:48,949
But there's a chance you can contract Salmonella.

38
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:52,949
And I don't want to have that looming over my head when I eat it.

39
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:54,949
So this is what I'm proposing to you guys.

40
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:59,949
This is what I'm going to do this weekend, this Saturday during my live stream.

41
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,949
It's going to be the egg stream.

42
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,949
And what do I mean by egg stream?

43
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:08,129
I'm going to cook up 12 or 24 hard-boiled eggs.

44
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:13,560
And every time I'm going to play Team Fortress 2, every single time I die,

45
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,560
I'm going to eat one of the hard-boiled eggs until they're all gone.

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,560
So if I'm having a really bad night on TF2,

47
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
I'm going to eat a dozen eggs or even more than that.

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,560
Maybe two dozen eggs if I'm doing really bad.

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,860
So I suggest you try and show up to that.

50
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,860
It's going to be pretty entertaining for you.

51
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,860
Awful for me potentially.

52
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,860
I like eggs. I mean, don't get me wrong. I like eggs.

53
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,860
I just don't like eating 50 eggs.

54
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,860
You know, it's going to be interesting.

55
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,419
So now that that is out of the way, I'll talk about Randomizer for a little bit

56
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:45,419
and what's going on right now.

57
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,419
I happened to bonk that heavy, but he ended up getting the kill on me.

58
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:51,419
Actually, somebody shot me with... I don't even know what the hell...

59
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,419
What gun is that? I've never seen that before.

60
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:57,419
Well, anyways, this is the part what I was talking about before with the...

61
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:03,819
I feel like I'm in a blender when I watch this. Oh my God.

62
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:08,819
This is exactly what I was talking about when I said things just become broken.

63
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,819
As you can see, that's not normal. That is not normal.

64
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,819
You are absolutely not supposed to get electrocuted when you shoot the Tommy Slop.

65
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:20,209
That's not supposed to happen.

66
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,209
And I found from playing this for a little bit,

67
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:27,209
the best thing you could possibly get is probably the scout with the minigun.

68
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:31,209
Or second best would probably be heavy with the medigun.

69
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:35,209
So you can be a healer with 300 health. It's just mind-boggling.

70
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:40,639
And the worst loadout you can get is anything to do with a soldier banner.

71
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,639
Because I don't think they even work.

72
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,639
I tried to blow the horn. I had the buff banner at one point when I was playing earlier.

73
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,639
And I got like 9 million damage and it didn't even matter.

74
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,639
I tried to blow the horn. Nothing happened. It just kind of was broken in my hand.

75
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,819
And I'm pretty sure there's a lot of other stuff that's broken as well.

76
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:59,819
I can't really think on the top of my head right now, but I'm pretty sure engineer buildings.

77
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,819
I don't think you can do them as other classes.

78
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:05,819
Or the spy disguises or the spy watches.

79
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,060
I'm pretty sure they don't work.

80
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,060
And how funny would that be though?

81
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,060
How hysterical would that be if you could see a heavy kind of crouching in the corner with the disguise mask on his face?

82
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,060
Just sitting there with like the cloak and dagger or something.

83
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,490
Now that would be so awesome.

84
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,490
But this is going to be the end of the gameplay guys.

85
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,490
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

86
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,490
And come to that livestream this weekend.

87
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,490
6 p.m. Eastern time if you don't know, if you've never been there before.

88
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,490
If you are a long time stream goer, should be a great time, should be crazy.

89
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,490
I wonder how many eggs I'm going to be able to eat.

90
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,980
That's the real question.

91
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,980
Question of the video. Here it goes. Ready?

92
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,980
Here's the question.

93
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,220
How many eggs do you think I'm going to eat in that livestream?

94
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,220
So I look forward to your responses and I'll see you guys all soon.

95
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,220
Take care everybody.
