00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,779
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:19,579
And tonight, I'm gonna be playing as the Scout. And this is gonna be a kind of a special Scout video.

3
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:22,579
And not so much special in the sense, I mean, the gameplay is pretty good.

4
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:29,579
But it's my first really tip video for the Scout. I've done one or two of these before, but I never really went into that much detail.

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,780
So this is gonna be a detailed look at how I play Scout and why I do the things that I do.

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:43,340
So really before we get into this at all, I gotta preface this by saying I am not the most fantastic Scout player in the world.

7
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:51,340
I am not like a competitive Scout player. I can only give you the advice that I've learned by experimenting and by just playing in pubs.

8
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:58,509
So I guess take this video with a grain of salt, I guess, because like I said, I'm not a comp player. I never plan on being one.

9
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,710
But this is just for the new guys, some of the people that are trying to improve their Scout game.

10
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,189
And I'll start off by saying this. Sensitivity does not really matter.

11
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,430
A lot of people will ask, Jerma, what is the sensitivity plate to play on on Scout? Do I need a certain sensitivity?

12
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,430
And in general, the answer to that question is always gonna be no.

13
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,430
You don't have to have some secret magic sensitivity to play any of the classes or to play Scout more specifically.

14
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:35,000
So instead of asking what a sensitivity you should play on, you should find a sensitivity that you're comfortable using and stick with it and never change it.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's the number one thing. I see people do that all the time.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They change their sensitivity from 4.2 to 3.1 all the way up to 5.8.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And when you do that, you're just kind of relearning the game again because you have to read your muscle memory from your brain to your hand.

18
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,200
It has to reconfigure everything it's already learned.

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,629
So just grab a sensitivity that you like that you can play with all the classes and just stick with it.

20
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:11,259
So now I want to talk about aiming as the Scout and how to improve it and how to make your game a little more cleaner and not so crazy and, you know, ripping the mouse all over the place.

21
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:15,259
This is what I do as the Scout as you'll see on the screen here.

22
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:20,500
You want to do as little mouse movement as humanly possible when you shoot someone.

23
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:26,699
The reason for that is you can shoot somebody with the scatter gun simply by strafing and running around.

24
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:31,699
As you'll see, I don't really move the mouse, especially when I get close to somebody.

25
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:35,699
I don't rip the mouse around and try and aim right at their face or aim at their chest.

26
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:40,699
I sort of let them pass through my vision and I strafe around and I shoot them.

27
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:44,000
That's what you want to start to do as the Scout.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You want to stop aiming at people and start strafing around to get them into your crosshair.

29
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:56,629
Now, this is not a 100% you cannot move the mouse, never move the mouse as the Scout.

30
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,629
That's not exactly what I'm trying to say.

31
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:05,629
What I'm trying to say is when you get close to somebody, because as the Scout, of course, you have to get really, really close to do any significant damage.

32
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:11,629
You want to try and stop moving around so much with your hand and actually start moving around with your body.

33
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:15,939
Because as we all know, it doesn't matter where you shoot somebody in this game.

34
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:21,139
You could shoot them in their bottom of their stomach, right up to the top of their torso, right in their face.

35
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:25,139
And as long as you get the pellets on them, it's going to do the same amount of damage.

36
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:30,550
So the moral of this story, I guess, is glide, don't jerk.

37
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,550
There you go, that's the tagline for the aiming as the Scout.

38
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,180
Glide your hand, don't jerk your hand.

39
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,180
So next up, I want to talk about a certain technique.

40
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,180
I'm not exactly sure what you would call this, but it's the jump over, I guess you could call it.

41
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,060
So essentially what's going to happen is when you see a class that will probably kill you in one second.

42
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:56,060
Those classes include the Soldier, the Heavy, and even the Demoman, and sometimes in some cases the Pyro as well.

43
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:04,419
How you want to deal with these people is you want to do your double jump completely over them, turn around and try and get behind them.

44
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:08,419
And a lot of times people will be so confused, they won't even turn around.

45
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:13,419
And if they do turn around, you can get two or three planted shots on them that should kill them.

46
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,620
And sometimes there's a lot of cases where you'll jump over somebody that was shooting at you and they just totally forget about you.

47
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,620
It's happened to me before as well, I've been a Heavy or a Soldier and a Scout does this technique where he jumps over you.

48
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,620
And I'm just like, where the hell did he just go? And you turn around and by that time you're shot in the face.

49
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,240
It's a great technique and I suggest you try doing more of it because it can really confuse people.

50
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,670
So the last thing that I want to talk about before this video is over is as a Scout, never stop moving.

51
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:49,870
Try and memorize where all the health packs and where the dispensers will be and where all the people will be.

52
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:58,870
Because if you don't stop moving as a Scout, you're going to get in this flow where you can just keep running around in circles killing people over and over again.

53
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,870
And when you stop, once you stop moving as a Scout, you start to really think about what you're doing and you get out of the zone.

54
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,500
So stay as focused as you can when you play and just don't stop moving.

55
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,870
Before I go, I just want to say one more thing. It all takes practice guys and it all takes patience.

56
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,870
I was an awful Scout. Like Scout was one of my least played classes when the game first came out.

57
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,870
I couldn't do it. I couldn't understand. I have such low health. How am I supposed to do this? This is ridiculous.

58
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,050
You just have to play. You just have to play. You just have to get comfortable.

59
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,050
And once you do those two things, you will get good no matter what you do.

60
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,220
Even if you don't do any of these techniques, you will get good.

61
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,420
So just practice and play and just have fun. That's what it's all about guys.

62
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,600
So I will see you guys all soon. Hopefully some of you guys could get some information out of this video.

63
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
And even if you didn't, you just watch for the fun of it.

64
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Then thanks for watching. I'll see you all soon.

65
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
And take care everybody.
