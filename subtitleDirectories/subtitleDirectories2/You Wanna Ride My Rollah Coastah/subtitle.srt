00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:20,600
So this is Coaster Crazy. This is a game that was made by Frontier. If you don't know who Frontier is, they're the guys that are responsible for the Rollercoaster Tycoon franchise.

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:33,460
And this is their, like, new game. And I have to make this coaster sick. And I'm gonna try to do that as best as I possibly can.

3
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:40,609
I really, really hope nobody pukes. Let's do a different camera angle. How about this one?

4
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:47,109
Yay! Woohoo! This is so much fun!

5
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:51,659
Ooh, I love candy! Yay!

6
00:00:51,659 --> 00:01:01,390
Oh my god! He just, like, threw up in his mouth! He's doing it again!

7
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:11,370
This coaster sucks! How's that? I kind of want to make something like this. There we go.

8
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:17,370
That's a little more ridiculous. I want my fear rating on this coaster to be through the roof, because you'll see that there's gonna be meters down here.

9
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:24,370
I'll show you in a second. So you see the E, F, and the N? You gotta keep those in the green, or else the coaster sucks, alright?

10
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:29,370
That's, like, the rule of thumb. If the coaster's not in the green, then it's a piece of crap. That's all I really know.

11
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,370
Oh my god!

12
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,370
Somebody-

13
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:40,549
No, are you okay? I'm sorry!

14
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:50,579
Here we go. We got some excitement here. We got some excitement here. Lost somebody.

15
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,200
What? We went through? Look at this guy!

16
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,079
What? What just happened?

17
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:13,659
Wait a second! Why is this intertwining like that? I didn't do that! I didn't want that to happen!

18
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:17,219
Oh, damn! I gotta move that!

19
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:19,219
How many people have to die?

20
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:22,930
Here we go!

21
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,860
I hope this is exciting!

22
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,289
His, like, girlfriend just got launched off, and he doesn't even care.

23
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:38,520
Alright, I have added so much dumb shit to this track.

24
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,949
Look at this. This is almost a 90 degree- I'm gonna kill someone. Someone's gonna die from this drop.

25
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:50,389
This is just- You don't wanna ride this ride.

26
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:56,210
If you're at Six Flags or whatever and you see this, you turn to your buddy and you go,

27
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:01,210
Look, we aren't fucking going on that thing. I don't care how much of a daredevil you wanna be.

28
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,330
It ain't happening.

29
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,939
I think, I'm pretty sure every single person throws up on this ride.

30
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:15,110
From what I've done, every single person is gonna throw up.

31
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,539
And that was the goal, I'm not gonna lie, that was the goal from the very beginning.

32
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:22,539
Was to make everybody throw up and, like, kill everybody.

33
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:24,539
So let's just see how many-

34
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:48,300
Who has that much stomach acid?

35
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,300
Did that guy just get back on the- Did you see that?

36
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,939
That guy flew off and went right back into the cab.

37
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,180
That guy- I'm so confused right now, I hope I got that.

38
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:07,370
Some guy flew out and got put back in the seat.

39
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,800
I wanna zoom in, I wanna close up on that and do a slo-mo. I really think that just happened.

40
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,180
That was unbelievable.

41
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,910
Just having this view and all the horrified reactions to things.

42
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,910
See, he landed again and he got puked on.

43
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,910
He landed again.

44
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,910
This king, this guy in the front is seriously a trooper.

45
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:37,259
He's the only one that ever succeeds to-

46
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,259
No, the king.

47
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,259
The king is dead.

48
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,850
I don't even know what's gonna happen. It's gonna be a horrible crash.

49
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,620
And you know what? It's okay.

50
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,620
Because this game- Look at that bump right there.

51
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,449
Alright, here we go. I have no idea what's about to happen.

52
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,449
All I know is that I wanna keep it at that.

53
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,170
Coaster Crazy, guys.

54
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,170
Coaster Crazy on the iOS app store.

55
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,540
Go get it.

56
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,540
If you like games like this, go get this goddamn game.

57
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,779
What you just saw is reason enough to fucking pick up this game. It really is.

58
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,779
Let's-

59
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:20,779
Instantly.

60
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:28,649
Hmm, something ain't right here.

61
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:31,649
Something isn't supposed to be there. I wonder what it is.
