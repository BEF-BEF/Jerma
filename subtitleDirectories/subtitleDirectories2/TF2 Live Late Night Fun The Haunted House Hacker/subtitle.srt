1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,260
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma and MLC Stealth here with a late night live commentary.

2
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:26,260
Nice. You gotta be cool. You're even like in the call. Oh god, I forgot I equipped this.

3
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:33,140
I'm already trying so hard, I become silent. Why did I go after him with that? That was a mistake.

4
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:46,939
This is a spy. Get out of my face. No, he's not there. But anyway, this is a late night live commentary.

5
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:53,109
Haven't done a commentary like this in a long time.

6
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:58,670
He was so WM1 that he didn't even know what to do when the edge came about him.

7
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:06,040
When was the last time I did do a live commentary besides the live streaming stuff? I can't even remember.

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:16,840
But here it is. Oh, well, you are a spy. I think he's still alive. Maybe.

9
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:26,739
And get... Yeah, I got you. What just happened? Did that guy just blow himself up?

10
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:33,650
There seems to be a lot of people who are doing that this game. Come on, take another one of those.

11
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:41,459
I can't hit this guy. Oh my god, I just barely missed him. What is...

12
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:47,890
You know, it's been so long since I've used the flare gun. I equipped it to like change things up and I haven't even... Yeah, that's a spy.

13
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:55,140
What are you playing as? Pyro. I gotta get my flare gun shots down.

14
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,450
We've been playing Shoe Mania Storm for years. Come on. For years.

15
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:12,460
Oh, that's gonna make people angry. I just shot a rocket into the spawn.

16
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:18,780
Oh look, it's Wheatley. Here we go. Here's Dean Pelton. What's he got? He's got the knife, the ambassador.

17
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:26,479
Oh, you're watching me? I'll watch this like spawn kill. Are you really just like spawn killing people?

18
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,479
Kinda. It's not like on purpose though. And I did face stab a heavy just now.

19
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,680
Yeah, I'm spawning. Oh my god. Yeah, right.

20
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:43,569
Oh, I just got a crit-rocketed in the face. I was gonna reflect it too, I just got too close to him.

21
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:52,509
Where am I on this scoreboard? It's pretty awful right now. I'm doing pretty good.

22
00:02:52,509 --> 00:03:04,629
I just heard somebody scream. What? How did this guy get back here? My goodness.

23
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:14,400
And scout! Get hit. No. Why did I do that? Man, Blue Team is just not doing this right now.

24
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:23,969
I think maybe we should switch to the other team. Let's tell Black Wholesun and ReverseCowgirl133 to go on...

25
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:32,150
Oh my god, so many people just came up here. The entire Blue Team just came up the stairs.

26
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:42,620
So many people were just right there. It's almost like all of them were talking over Skype to come and get me.

27
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,620
I dare you, get that Pyro.

28
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:03,599
That guy's emblem is the community flag for the school of the TV show. He's my new favorite person.

29
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,659
I was just about to hate him for killing me, but you can't hate that. He deserves it.

30
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,659
And my name is Dean Pelton! How great is that?

31
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,659
He probably likes you right now. He loves the references.

32
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:21,370
I'm not sure what to do. I think we got it. Oh god, Sniper.

33
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,740
Let's go Blue. Can you get on Blue?

34
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,509
I'm not sure what to do. Love your emblem, says Dean Pelton.

35
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,750
Oh, it's too late. Can't. We're going to have to be against each other now.

36
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,750
I'm going to destroy you and burp at the same time.

37
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:41,939
Not even high enough. Rain needles down!

38
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:52,410
Are those even making it across? I think so. Maybe not.

39
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,410
Oh buddy, you have no idea what's in store for you!

40
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:05,310
I really need to put on the crit screen if I'm going to do this. I will put that on after.

41
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,639
Oh, come on now, you damn woman.

42
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,569
Kill me. Thanks, ma'am.

43
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:17,870
Come on, how does nobody die from that? How does nobody die from that?

44
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:25,019
Barrage of needles that went in his face.

45
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:30,540
I'm doing it again. Oh, he's building a sentry. Is that you building that sentry?

46
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,810
I am on spy. So nope.

47
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,620
One more hit, this guy's dead. He knows it too.

48
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,779
Oh, that was lucky.

49
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:49,709
Alright, I gotta turn the crit screen on. I gotta put the crit screen on.

50
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:52,399
Let's push this up.

51
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,639
Stay on this point, boys. Heals for everybody, heals for all.

52
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,680
And that's when I make my exit. Stay on there. Nice.

53
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,500
Is he going to get it? I hope so.

54
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,120
It's probably a bad idea that we're facing each other.

55
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,639
I'm going battle medic, man. What? What the hell was that?

56
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,730
Oh man. My god, a lot of chaos here.

57
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,420
Oh, that was lucky and close. I need the health that's up here.

58
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,620
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

59
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,300
Alright, is that guy's name Andariel?

60
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,860
Oh, what? Oh, random crits. Those confuse me right now.

61
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,860
Let's go down here. Let's go down here, buddy.

62
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,180
Oh, look out. Kill that heavy. Kill that heavy?

63
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:56,699
I gotta keep this thing on him. Now he needs it.

64
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:02,649
Alright, so I see a spy in my team. He's just crouch walking around with his thing.

65
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:08,860
I wish you could have seen what just happened here.

66
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,350
I wish you could have seen what just happened here.

67
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:18,009
He's going to know I'm right here. See if I can't.

68
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:20,009
Oh, I thought I could have killed him. How much health?

69
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:27,240
Oh, no way.

70
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Oh my gosh, that guy's lagging. Geez.

71
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,180
I hear a roar across the whole stadium right now. What's happening?

72
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,100
I don't hear anything.

73
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,769
It sounds like I'm in a haunted mansion right now.

74
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:44,769
Wait, what? Oh my god, it's a speed hacker.

75
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:46,199
What?

76
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:54,139
It's a hacker. It's a speed hacker. It's a speed hacker.

77
00:07:54,139 --> 00:08:01,360
It's a guy with scream hacks, speed hacks.

78
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:13,009
Oh my god. That scared me so much.

79
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:16,009
Dude, what's with the screaming?

80
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:19,009
I thought I was in a haunted mansion.

81
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:21,009
No, don't open the door.

82
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:23,009
I just thought everyone was dying.

83
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:27,500
Oh, you bastards. Don't open that door.

84
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,680
Dude, he is going. Look at him. Where is he?

85
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,679
Oh my god, dude.

86
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,289
I'm just going to go. I'm holding the dead ringer out.

87
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,289
I'm so afraid of that noise.

88
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,539
Where is he?

89
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:48,710
Psycho.

90
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,980
Oh my god. Oh my god. Holy crap.

91
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,409
Oh, that's terrifying. Can you hear this?

92
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:01,580
Is he gone? Yeah, I can hear it.

93
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,580
Oh, man. Well, so much for the live commentary.

94
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,759
What are you talking about? We got it.

95
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,259
I know. Look at this.

96
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,259
Oh my gosh. I'm going to have a nightmare of this sound.

97
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:21,159
He's just following me around.

98
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,159
Oh, I'm dizzy right now.

99
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,659
Hold on a second. I need to go spectate. I need to watch this guy.

100
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:31,659
Why does it say everyone's changing their name to Dean Pilton?

101
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:33,659
They clearly are not.

102
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:35,659
That's him. Where is he? Here he is.

103
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:39,899
Look at this guy. Look at this guy's totally legit game he's doing right now.

104
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,389
Anyone he runs into, he changes his name to them.

105
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:48,980
This is ridiculous.

106
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,470
I'm spectating him right now, and it seriously is one of the oddest things I've ever seen.

107
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,120
Yep, here I come.

108
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,120
What's his name?

109
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,120
His name changes every two seconds.

110
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,490
This is hurting my head.

111
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,730
I know. I have to... I disconnected.

112
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,730
I couldn't take the screams in my head anymore.

113
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,539
That's scary. That's a scary sound.

114
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:17,779
That really is.

115
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:21,750
Oh my gosh.

116
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,629
Well...

117
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:28,190
Alright, so apparently I wasn't going crazy when I said,

118
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,190
Hey, why am I afraid right now in a haunted house?

119
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,460
What are you talking about? Oh my gosh.

120
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,700
Thanks everybody for watching.

121
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,320
I do appreciate it.

122
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,929
Yeah, hacks are not cool.

123
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:51,059
So I guess we'll talk to you guys soon.

124
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:53,059
Take it easy everybody.

125
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:56,059
I just said take it easy everybody.

126
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:59,059
Take care everybody. See you all soon.
