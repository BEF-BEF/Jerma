00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,890
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,890
And tonight, gonna be playing as the sniper using the...what sniper rifle is this?

3
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,890
Oh, it's the heat machine bedmaker.

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,890
Alright, got the heat machine bedmaker on the...Darwin's? No, the Cozy Camper for the first half of this video.

5
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,890
And then I take it off for...because there were a lot of spies on the other team.

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,890
I think I put on the Razorback, actually. And the ham. The genuine ham.

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:42,890
So today, or tonight, whenever you happen to be watching this video, I want to talk about sniping.

8
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:49,060
Not necessarily the mechanics of sniping, not necessarily the, you know, how to snipe,

9
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,060
but an important role that you kind of sometimes have to play.

10
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,689
And I've never really talked about this topic before. I've touched upon sniping.

11
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:03,689
I've gave, like, advice and tips on how to be a better sniper, like, almost years ago, it seems.

12
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,689
But this video's gonna focus on counter-sniping.

13
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,689
And why, when you counter-snipe, you actually do so much good for your team,

14
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,689
even if you are getting friggin' destroyed.

15
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:19,689
Even if the other snipers on the team are using you for target practice,

16
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:23,689
you still add a good layer of protection to the rest of your team.

17
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:27,689
We're gonna go over why, and we're gonna go...yes.

18
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,689
So, counter-sniping, the first thing you wanna know, the first thing we're gonna talk about is,

19
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:33,689
when should you do it?

20
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,859
When should you be the guy that finally says,

21
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:40,859
okay, I'm gonna cave, and I'm gonna play sniper right now to try to counter-snipe?

22
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,859
So the situations are as follows.

23
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:46,859
Number one, if there are more than one or two snipers on the enemy team,

24
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,859
if there's even more than one sniper on the enemy team with a scope,

25
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:53,859
I'm not talking about Huntsman here,

26
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:58,859
because Huntsman is a sort of medium-range class that can be dealt with by other classes,

27
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,859
but if there is more than one scope sniper on the other team,

28
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:06,099
you gotta hold down Tab and see if you are matching that.

29
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:10,099
If you are not matching the same amount of snipers the other team has,

30
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:12,099
scope, again, we're talking about scope here,

31
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,099
then somebody has to do it.

32
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,099
And the reason why I say this,

33
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,099
and there are gonna be people that probably disagree with this theory,

34
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:24,099
but when there is an imbalance of snipers against snipers on various maps,

35
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:26,280
it can cause a lot of problems.

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,280
If there are, like, four snipers on the enemy team just destroying everyone at long range,

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,280
and there's maybe one on your side trying to deal with it,

38
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,280
it can be a real chaotic environment,

39
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,280
because there's no way, there's no other really class that can deal with snipers that have scopes

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
unless you are a spy.

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,280
It's very hard to deal with unless you have a very good spy or another couple very good snipers.

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,840
Now, there are a lot of exceptions to this guideline.

43
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm not gonna call it a rule, because it is technically a guideline.

44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,840
But point number two, a follow-up to point number one,

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,840
when you have matching snipers, they become targets for each other,

46
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,840
rather than just going rampant on the other people on the team.

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,840
When there's another sniper that you know is shooting at you, you're standing still.

48
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,840
You know he can kill you in one shot, so you are always shooting at each other.

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,020
And I think in this gameplay, I only die from another sniper.

50
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,020
It's the same sniper that kills me every single time.

51
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,580
So having that ample threat on either side,

52
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,580
I'm not gonna be trying to shoot at the heavies that are coming around the corner as slugs.

53
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,580
I'm not gonna do that, because I know the guy back behind the fucking rock over there

54
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,580
has his laser beam on my head.

55
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,580
So it's this parallel between the two sides that causes counter sniping to be very effective,

56
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,580
because then you allow your team to do the things that they are supposed to do,

57
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,580
rather than walking around corners and instantly dying.

58
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,009
And the third point I want to make about counter sniping and how to kind of effectively do it,

59
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,009
is you need to know the maps.

60
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:04,009
You need to know where all the sniping posts are, at least the most typical ones.

61
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:09,009
Because you're gonna be watching, I scan all the sniper areas over and over again,

62
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:12,009
looking for these guys to show up as they are doing to me.

63
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:16,009
So if you don't know where all the really default snipers,

64
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:20,009
if you don't know where the default sniper posts are,

65
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,009
it's gonna be hard for you to really counter snipe effectively,

66
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,009
because you always have to be scanning those areas.

67
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:27,439
And like I said in the beginning of this video,

68
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,439
even if you are a bullet sponge sniper,

69
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,439
even if you just turn the corner scope in and you get shot instantly,

70
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,439
like at least you're doing that, at least you're having to give that good sniper something else to do,

71
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,439
rather than hold his scope down on the cart completely uncontested

72
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,939
while he gets like 90 kills in one life.

73
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:50,939
And before the video wraps up, I do want to talk about this,

74
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,939
because it is a pretty major change to Team Fortress 2.

75
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:57,939
It has nothing to do with the previous large update that happened,

76
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,939
but it is about idling.

77
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:04,939
Apparently you can no longer idle anymore in this game,

78
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,939
unless you are physically in the game.

79
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:12,939
Like you can't load up a text idler, you have to be like actively in quotes playing the game.

80
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:15,300
And I'm gonna give you a reason why.

81
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,300
This could be a very, very, very good change to this game.

82
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
And it's a very big if.

83
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,660
If Valve introduces a way to get more drops for being in the game longer,

84
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,660
if they're gonna introduce higher drop rates or change the drop system a little bit,

85
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,660
I know the blog hinted at this.

86
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,660
The blog post on TF2.com sort of hinted that they are going to be tweaking the item system.

87
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,660
So if they go in the direction where, hey, if you're actively playing the game,

88
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,660
we want to reward you for playing.

89
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,660
So maybe we're gonna give you more drops.

90
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,660
Maybe we'll give you a higher percentage to get certain things.

91
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
Maybe we'll give you a different recipe.

92
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,660
Anything like that could be really awesome.

93
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,220
And I think Valve is starting to do a process here,

94
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,220
where they want to move people completely away from idling,

95
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,220
because with all these new updates and with all this work that Valve has put into this game,

96
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,220
they want you to actually play.

97
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,220
And I would really like to know what the percentage of people that are concurrently playing TF2,

98
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,220
how many of them are actually idling?

99
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,220
How many of them are actually in a game playing on like upward or something?

100
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,220
I bet you the percentage difference is astonishing.

101
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,220
I would be shocked if it were like, oh, no, there's only like 1% of the people that play TF2 are idling right now.

102
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,220
No way. I bet you it's way higher than that.

103
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,220
But if somebody has that statistic, then please go ahead and share it in the comments.

104
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,220
And speaking of comments, if you want to add to the discussion, please, by all means,

105
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,220
leave what you think about this idle change in the comment section,

106
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,220
or about counter sniping in general, or about sniping,

107
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,389
or about how your grandmother's doing, is she how's she doing, how like your family's doing,

108
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,389
did you go to a picnic this weekend? I want to hear about it.

109
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,389
But just put something in the comment section, guys, and that's going to wrap up the video.

110
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,389
And I'll see you guys all next time.

111
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,389
And of course, take care, everybody.
