1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,830
Yo, yo, yo, what's up everybody? Jerma here with another Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,439
Like you know it everybody.

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,740
Today I'm gonna be playing as the Tomislav Heavy.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,539
Something I haven't done in a long time. I haven't played Heavy in a very long time.

5
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:20,710
But Tomislav Heavy is very fun, very interesting.

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,410
They didn't nerf it. It was supposed to get nerfed.

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,320
Minus 50 health, I think it was, if you equip this item.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,519
If you guys are in the beta, if somebody's in the beta, let me know if they're still testing this.

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,219
Because that's a pretty huge deal. So if they're still testing it like that, I would like to know.

10
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:41,990
For my secondary, I'm using the Sandvich, which is pretty standard among most Heavies.

11
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,890
And for my melee, I'm using the Killing Gloves of Boxing.

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,189
Not the Gloves of Running Urgently, because guys, everybody uses the Gru.

13
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,390
Everybody and their grandmother uses the damn thing.

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,289
And here is a good reason why you should switch sometimes.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,289
Oh, a Shabow got the crits now on the Tomislav.

16
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:03,490
Coming out here and just wreck house on a bunch of people.

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,390
Which is a great tip if you're going to use the Killing Gloves of Boxing.

18
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,390
Make sure you use the Tomislav.

19
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,790
Because guys, if you equip the Shotgun or the Tomislav, it's a much quicker slap down time.

20
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,489
You don't have to wait for a spin up.

21
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:21,030
You can just switch over and absolutely mow people down in seconds.

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,030
Playing on King of the Hill Viaduct right now.

23
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,439
And Viaduct is an awesome Heavy map.

24
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,140
I came to the realization about this like a week ago.

25
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,140
When I played Heavy on here for like the first time.

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,040
I never play Heavy like I said first of all.

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,180
And I play Heavy on here once in a blue moon.

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,980
But take a look at this little choke point they come out of.

29
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,280
When they turn this corner, it's too late.

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,250
If you're already here with your gun spun down, it's too late.

31
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,750
They're just going to get killed.

32
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,049
And especially if there's a Medic healing you too.

33
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:52,150
It just makes it that much better.

34
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,019
So I guess you learn something every day.

35
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:57,219
Get killed by that Pyro right there.

36
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:59,719
And that Uber charge, they had to pop it early.

37
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,319
Which is actually a good thing.

38
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,299
I will accept that death.

39
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,500
Because that Uber charge had to come all the way up the stairs.

40
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,700
All the way around the corner.

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,300
Their Uber was gone by the time they even got up here.

42
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,800
So I'm okay with that.

43
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,099
Even though they capped the point, it's okay.

44
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,699
At least we tried, right?

45
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,659
That's the name of the game.

46
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:22,860
So here comes Jerma embarrassing moment number 7,955.

47
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,759
Just embarrassing.

48
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,860
I'm sorry about this.

49
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,560
I really do apologize.

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,659
So I come up here, there's a Heavy.

51
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:30,360
We're going to do a one-on-one Heavy fight, you'd think, right?

52
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,659
I'm afraid he has full health.

53
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,560
So I run around the corner and just go,

54
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,759
well, I'm just going to switch to my sandwich and I'll be fine.

55
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,860
No, I missed it.

56
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,250
Dead.

57
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,050
And the real kicker of this is look at the health.

58
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,289
He had like 20 health.

59
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:49,090
Oh, if I had just stayed up there and shot him for like two seconds,

60
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,590
that would not have happened.

61
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,490
But it did.

62
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,289
Have to move on, have to deal with it.

63
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,789
Here is a tip for you guys right now.

64
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:58,590
Kill the Medic first before you kill the Heavy.

65
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,389
If you're in a Heavy-Medic fight, chances are if you're close enough,

66
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,889
you can kill the Medic first.

67
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:04,990
Definitely do that.

68
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,490
Don't just shoot the Heavy if you're that close,

69
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,990
especially because I'm using the Tomislav.

70
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,289
As we all know, the Tomislav is the weakest next to Natasha.

71
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:16,389
It's the weakest minigun in the game.

72
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,289
So if you're going up against a regular minigun Heavy or a Brass Beast Heavy,

73
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:22,090
you are not going to kill them one-on-one.

74
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,590
You're going to take health off of him,

75
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,990
but you're guaranteed not going to kill him,

76
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,169
unless of course he has lower health.

77
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:32,569
But seeing that he had a Medic with him and that he was using the regular minigun,

78
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:34,969
I had to make the decision to go for the Medic.

79
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:37,169
That's really important because if I didn't do that,

80
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:40,199
we would have both died, me and my Medic.

81
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,500
So for the next minute or so,

82
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,000
I want to talk about something that has nothing to do with Team Fortress 2.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,330
I want to talk about Grandpa's upload to Machinima Respawn.

84
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,830
So if you're watching this in the future, I apologize,

85
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,830
but if you're watching this in the present, like a lot of you are,

86
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,330
Grandpa's first video is going to be on Machinima Respawn tomorrow.

87
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,430
I'm not sure if it's going to be tomorrow afternoon, tomorrow night,

88
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,530
but a lot of you wanted me to tell you when it was going to be up there,

89
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,229
and now I found out it's going to be every Friday.

90
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:10,530
It's going to be the same video.

91
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,030
It's going to be edited a little bit to make sense on Respawn,

92
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,029
but it's going to stay similar to the one you've already seen.

93
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,430
If you guys could please go support that video,

94
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,329
if you liked the original one,

95
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,430
I would totally, totally appreciate that.

96
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,930
And so would Grandpa.

97
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,730
Yes, I would.

98
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,730
Yeah, he would.

99
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,629
So let's get back to the gameplay here.

100
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,139
I just wanted to let you guys know about that.

101
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,740
With less than 20 seconds to go now, we look like we have this in the bag.

102
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,610
Unfortunately, though, they get on the point and they cap it.

103
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,009
So it looks like a big, big deal, but it's not.

104
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,110
Do not worry.

105
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,110
I am back here and I kill about five or six people in a row.

106
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,810
So what that means naturally is they cannot even get out to the point.

107
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,110
So once I get a couple of friends on my team to get onto that point,

108
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,410
we're going to cap it and we are going to win.

109
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,410
Come up on this left side.

110
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,910
They don't even know I'm here.

111
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,009
This medic and soldier pair don't even know I'm here.

112
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,410
I end up getting the soldier.

113
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,410
Medic goes down as well on his own, Will.

114
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,009
Don't even know how that happened.

115
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,709
Spy gets on the point, but it's not a big deal.

116
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:08,310
We cap it.

117
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,709
Five seconds left.

118
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,709
One Pyro gets on the point and almost gets it to overtime again,

119
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,709
but he doesn't succeed.

120
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,810
This is the end of the gameplay, guys.

121
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,610
Thank you so much for watching.

122
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,290
I really do appreciate it.

123
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,689
Shoot me a like if you enjoyed this video and make sure you be on the

124
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:26,889
lookout tomorrow for Grandpa on Respawn.

125
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,189
Hell yeah.

126
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:29,290
See you guys next time.

127
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,490
Take care, everybody.
