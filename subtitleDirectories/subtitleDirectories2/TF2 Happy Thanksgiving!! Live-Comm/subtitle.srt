00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,639
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a pre-thanksgiving live commentary.

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,439
I just want to say from the bottom of my heart, if you celebrate Thanksgiving, if you live in the

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:17,079
United States, or if you are overseas somewhere but you still happen to celebrate Thanksgiving,

4
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:20,440
then happy Thanksgiving. I hope you have a nice safe holiday everybody.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,739
Gonna do a quick live commentary like I'm saying. Oh goodness.

6
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:29,589
I thought I was gonna kill him. But yeah, happy Thanksgiving.

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,030
And I got some crazy crazy things planned for the holiday season. Not gonna tell you

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,149
what I'm doing yet. It's involving a lot of insanity. I'll get into that in a later video,

9
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:45,770
but expect a crazy Christmas video at some point in the very near future.

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:53,979
So what do you say? Let's get C. Let's get C. Playing as the pyro with the reserve shooter

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:01,240
and the degreaser along with the power jack. Pretty much default setup for me.

12
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,359
Except the reserve shooter. I don't really use it a whole lot. Oh, I was trying to sneak

13
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:10,150
behind everybody. What the hell was I doing? I like ran. I was talking and just ran around

14
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:18,549
everybody like an idiot. But yeah, I'm gonna fill up on so much turkey. I'm gonna eat a

15
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:24,599
ton of turkey sandwiches the next day. Should be a hell of a good time. Me and my family,

16
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:30,170
we go up to New Hampshire. And when we go there, we get a big hall rented out, like a big hall is

17
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:35,609
rented out for us. A ton of our family goes there every year. It's pretty cool. Pretty interesting.

18
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:41,370
I got a big family, guys. So we can't really have Christmas and like Thanksgiving at one little

19
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:47,819
place just because the family is so enormous. I want to get Oh, man. Oh, this could be epic

20
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,900
right here. This could be epic. Get out of here. I don't want you up here. Oh, there's a tree up

21
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:02,459
here. Oh, I should have known. I should have known. That's what I get. You know, I'm going

22
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:10,580
to change to demo man because that's just not going to happen as a pyro. Give me my... There we

23
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,580
go. All right. I'll do this right here. Ready? You guys ready? If I don't do this right here,

24
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:25,050
then something's wrong. Okay. I got to go the other way. Oh, no, no, no. Got to go around the

25
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:35,509
other direction. Here we go. Who'd I get? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I mean, they're all like pouring

26
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:51,050
in here. Oh, come on now. Come on now. How did that not hit him? I was going to say, Jesus.

27
00:02:52,199 --> 00:03:09,289
Jesus, criminy. I need a medic. Oh, Chris Krieg, look out. I'm dead. I'm so dead. Where did these

28
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:16,680
guys all come from? They're all just pouring into this one area. No, we have two medics. What's

29
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:26,840
going on here? What is the deal? This is gravel pit if you did not know. If you were unaware

30
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:37,900
of where we were playing. Where we were playing, not where we were playing. Oh, come on. At least

31
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:48,710
I got the teleporter. That's one thing. That's one good thing. All right. If I can get even close to

32
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:59,449
that and I could, I could probably get something done. I just need to overheal. Big time. Oh, no.

33
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:10,550
Demoman. Got him. All right. This is just, we have two medics. Where are they?

34
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:15,020
Where are these two mysterious medics that just are nowhere to be found?

35
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:27,259
Somebody's on the point. Oh, we might win. Come on. I'm just going to jump up there.

36
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:53,019
No. Oh, that was great. I just launched like 10,000 feet in the air. God. Jeez. Spy. No,

37
00:04:53,019 --> 00:05:06,519
we can't lose. Oh, get him. Nice shot. What? Oh, where is this medic? I haven't seen the

38
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:19,220
medic one time. Where is this guy? I'm going this way. I'm not going that way. I'm going to get

39
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:34,019
myself killed. Oh, did I make it? I did, but not really. I was just completely silent right there.

40
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:39,459
That was just try hard mode. Wicked bad. Too bad it didn't work. We're definitely going to lose.

41
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:47,110
This is it. That's all she wrote. So yeah, thank you guys. So look at this. What?

42
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:56,600
What is going on here? Anyways, we lose, but thanks everybody so much for watching.

43
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,160
I wanted to make this quick video just to get it out here and wish you guys a happy Thanksgiving.

44
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,439
And I wish you the best and stay safe, guys. Take care, everybody.
