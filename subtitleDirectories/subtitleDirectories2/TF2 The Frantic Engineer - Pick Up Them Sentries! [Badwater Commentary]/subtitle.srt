00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:20,949
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here, with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Engineer with this stuff that's on the screen, that stuff right there.

2
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:29,949
Pretty self-explanatory, pretty default setup for the Engineer, except for the Southern hospitality. I usually have either the Jag or my strange bot killer baby.

3
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:38,950
But anyways, this video is gonna talk about the gameplay, and I haven't done that in a long time, an actual serious gameplay talk, and it's gonna discuss a certain style of Engineer.

4
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:47,259
And I wouldn't even really call this a style of Engineer as much as it is almost a necessity nowadays when you're playing Team Fortress 2.

5
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:52,259
And I'll get into this, I'll talk about what I mean here, but it's called the Frantic Engineer.

6
00:00:53,259 --> 00:01:06,260
Now, a lot of us, when we first start playing the game, or even when playing the game for a couple of years, we will pick up the Engineer, and we think it's, oh yeah, just like, put down the Sentry, and just like, King, King, I got you, is that leveled up yet?

7
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:19,260
Okay, it is. Let me like, walk slowly over it. That's what we do. The Engineer is a weird class where a lot of people are afraid to play it, because they don't want to put a Sentry in the wrong spot, or they think it's boring,

8
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:28,260
and I don't want to screw something up because it's a very big part of the defense, but in actuality, the Engineer can be a very high adrenaline class.

9
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:39,260
When I play Engineer, as you're watching on the screen, just the carnage and the chaos that's happening around me, and trying to keep things under control, I have the same adrenaline rush when I play Engineer,

10
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:48,430
then I have when I play Scout, like when I'm running around Scout, like getting good shots, meat shot, meat shot, I've got like two or three kills in a row, that same mentality I go through as the Engineer.

11
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:56,430
So if you play the Engineer with the same type of veracity that you play the Scout, you will do a lot better, and you'll have a lot more fun.

12
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:07,060
And you probably noticed maybe 15 or 20 seconds ago, I picked up the Sentry during a very, very heated situation, and I feel like I don't see a lot of Engineers do this,

13
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:17,060
and it's very, very important as follows. We all know that a moving target in this game is a lot more difficult to hit than a standing still target.

14
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,060
I mean, it makes complete sense, right? Things that stand still die quicker than things that are moving around, and people have to aim at them.

15
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,060
So when you pick up that Sentry, what you're effectively doing is saying,

16
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:34,060
Demoman, you've got to kill me now, and not the Sentry. You would have killed the Sentry anyways, and I would have had to rebuild it,

17
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,060
but I'm willing to go down with the damn ship if you can manage to kill me, and I do it a couple times in this video.

18
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:48,060
And where the Sentry would have died, it just doesn't, and it works especially well when you're in a tight corner like this,

19
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,060
because somebody has to come down here to take this Sentry out.

20
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:59,060
Now, some Demoman is going to be lobbing stickies across the whole map, which, I mean, effectively, he could probably do that,

21
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:05,060
but a good rule of thumb is, if you see one sticky land next to your Sentry gun, pick it up immediately,

22
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,060
and just start kind of backing up and just, you know, surveying the situation.

23
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,060
If an Uber Demoman comes in, you're dead anyways, and so is the Sentry, almost guaranteed.

24
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:21,060
So to give yourself any sort of chance to have that potentially not happen is in your best interest as an Engineer.

25
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,060
And if you notice, another thing I want to talk about, I don't stop moving almost this entire gameplay.

26
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,060
I'm whipping around, I'm checking, I'm hitting, I'm checking, I'm hitting, I'm checking.

27
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:39,060
You always want to be moving as an Engineer, because the more you stand still, the easier you are for a Sniper to kill you and a Spy.

28
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,060
Those are your two, like, biggest threats, I guess you could say, besides a Demoman that's Ubered.

29
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,060
But, Snipers, I can't tell you how many times I've seen an Engineer building his Sentry gun, standing completely still,

30
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,060
and he just gets smoked by a Sniper, and then his Sentry goes down because he's not there repairing it.

31
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:02,360
Another good rule of thumb for this particular tip, I guess, is if it's been more than five seconds and you haven't looked behind you,

32
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,599
look behind you. There you go. If you can count to five and you've been facing the same direction, you're dead.

33
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,599
Like, turn around and look behind you, because there's probably a Spy.

34
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,600
Look, did you see how many Spies have come down here during this one video?

35
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Is evidence enough to always be checking behind you or to your side if you're in a good spot like I am in the corner here?

36
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:32,029
And to kind of wrap this up, I mentioned in the beginning of this video why this is a necessity now to play Engineer like this in any class.

37
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:40,029
People have gotten a lot better at this game than they were back in, like, 2007, 2008, 2009.

38
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:45,029
There's a lot more players because of the free-to-play update, and people are just really good now.

39
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:49,029
That's something that I was talking to, I think it was Star the other day, and I was saying,

40
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,339
man, there are so many people that are just really good at this game now.

41
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:55,339
It's like people know what they're doing now.

42
00:04:55,339 --> 00:05:00,339
You don't run into as many Spies that are just backstabbing the spawn door anymore.

43
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:05,339
Like, that's not as big of a thing as it was back, like, 12 months ago.

44
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:11,699
So you really got to be on your toes in this stage of the TF2 game, because no matter what server you play on,

45
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,699
they will always be that guy that's on the other team that's really good as sniper,

46
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:22,699
and he's just sitting there tracking your bald-ass cue ball heavy head, and you die every single time.

47
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,699
So you really have to start to adapt to the circumstances, adapt to the game,

48
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,699
and I think that's what a lot of people have been doing over the years.

49
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,699
And as the game's been out for so long, years and years and years go by, people just are getting better,

50
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,699
and people are just good. That's the way it really is.

51
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,939
But that is going to wrap up this video, guys.

52
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,939
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

53
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:45,939
And if you have anything to add in the comments section, I'd love to read it.

54
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:49,939
Please, by all means, type away, but I'll see you guys all next time.

55
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:53,889
And of course, take care, everybody.
