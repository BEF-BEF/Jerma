00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,939
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,

2
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:18,579
and tonight I'm going to be playing as the Huntsman Sniper with the Huntsman, the Crush

3
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:24,899
the Spy in the Face Baby, the Huntsman, the Darwin's Danger Shield, and the Bushwhacka.

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,820
Now I take the Bushwhacka off because honestly it's there for no reason. Pretty sure I swap

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,020
it out with the default Kukri in a minute here after my second or third death. And speaking

6
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,439
of deaths, this gameplay is crazy. Take a look at the number right now on the top of

7
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,600
the screen. After, of course, you take a look at me shooting that scout right in his teeth

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,039
with an arrow, but there's a minute and 25 seconds left. I was in a Skype call. Me, Boo,

9
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,520
and Stealth were all in a Skype call. We were just raging at each other this whole time.

10
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,840
You don't even understand. They had us spawn camped the entire time. And the round before

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,759
this, they were absolutely rolling us and dominating us. So we were just in the Skype

12
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,799
call going, like, this is bullshit. I'm so, oh, this is ridiculous. Oh, Spy, look out

13
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,159
for the, and it was just crazy. And then watch what happens here. The mood in the Skype call

14
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:21,400
went from, oh my God, we're going to hang ourselves depressed to the most joyous, amazing

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,980
occasion. Like, really? Because we've all been in this situation before. I know I don't

16
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,099
speak for myself. When you get on Team Fortress 2, you want to play, you want to have fun

17
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:35,420
with your friends, and every single round you get into, you happen to get on the team

18
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,909
that is the unbalanced team, and you lose every single match. That is exactly what was

19
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:45,670
happening to us in this string of games we played. I think we did maybe three or four

20
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,329
in a row where we were on the unbalanced team and we got rolled within two minutes of the

21
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:55,280
game starting. Also, right there, does that happen to anybody else? My mouse, my optical

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,340
mouse will sometimes just freak out and just move around in random directions. I want to

23
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,540
know if anybody else has that problem. But take a look at what just happened over time

24
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,139
right now. Getting on the cart as the Huntsman sniper, I got a heavy with me now. We actually

25
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:17,080
capped this point. And from here on out, it is a total roll. We absolutely destroy them

26
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,889
in a way that I can't even really comprehend. And I think I die only one more time after

27
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:26,990
this right here. And it really was just crazy. Nobody really expected this to happen. We

28
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,909
were in the Skype call, like I said, just in shock. I kept on landing these shots, you'll

29
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:37,270
see I get some really, really amazing Huntsman shots coming up here. And we were just stunned.

30
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,830
It's like, wait, wait, wait, this team was just totally dominating us. They were destroying

31
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,699
us the whole time. What just happened? Why are we winning now? I guess it's just the

32
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:52,580
nature of the Team Fortress 2 beast in parentheses quotations right there or whatever you want

33
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,740
to call them. I think because this game is just so ridiculous, there's so many variables,

34
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,699
anything can happen. So as you saw with one second to go being spawn camp the whole time,

35
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:09,400
we managed to still cap the point and we're still going. I believe this is the only time

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,300
the cart stands still for more than one second without moving. After we get it through the

37
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,840
middle of this tunnel here, the next time it stops is at the last point. And while I

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,199
have a minute or so here while we roll the cart, I want to talk about an update for you

39
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,879
guys on the model search, the search for a CGI model maker or something, however you

40
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,560
want to phrase it. But before I get into any of that, I want to say thank you so much to

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,960
all of you guys. Everybody that sent me a PM or that sent me a comment telling me a

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,340
certain modeler or even if you offered up to do the service yourself, I really appreciate it

43
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,259
guys. I got a great response. Thank you all so, so, so much. But I think I've narrowed it down

44
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:57,439
now. I think I've got the guy I'm going to try and contact. Hopefully I can make some kind of

45
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,960
arrangement with this person because I don't want it to be like, oh, hey you, yeah, hey, go do a

46
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:07,080
bunch of work for me. Like I wanted to benefit them as much as it would benefit me as well.

47
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:13,879
So just wanted to make the update that I no longer need any modeler names or any community names

48
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,519
or anything like that because I think I got the guy. But thank you everybody regardless, like I

49
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:25,060
said, if I ever need anybody in the future, I will definitely make another video asking for it.

50
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,100
So let's talk about the gameplay again here. Look at this pyro. This pyro was so laggy I couldn't

51
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,019
even hit him point blank. The amount of lag that was being generated from that guy's bloodstream

52
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:39,620
was off the charts. And look at that guy. You see that guy fall off the edge?

53
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:46,100
I always love when that happens. And let's talk about upward now. Speaking of like falling off

54
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,819
the edges and upward being a crazy map, this is a pretty difficult map to get a gameplay on.

55
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:57,660
As you've probably noticed by now, there's only maybe two or three upward gameplays, including

56
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:04,300
this one on my channel. And that's really just because it's so long. If you do not roll on upward

57
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,980
or even bad water, to be honest, if you don't absolutely can lootly roll the other team,

58
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,779
or when you're on defense, if you don't defend the point really well, you're going to end up

59
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:21,339
with like a 45 minute round. And this happens quite frequently. I spend at least 20 minutes,

60
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:27,259
25 minutes at least in most of my bad water or upward rounds. So it can be quite tricky

61
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,259
sometimes to get an actual gameplay that is watchable. Because like you guys know,

62
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:38,139
I don't like uploading like 27 minute long videos only because it kills my internet and my computer

63
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:43,980
will just explode if I try and render out like a 30 minute video. I did that one time before,

64
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:50,459
and it was for a Q&A video and my computer like exploded. So I don't want to do that again.

65
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:54,860
So coming up to the end of the gameplay here, a demo man takes out the sentry that's at the top

66
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,740
left. I get critscrigged for I think one second and I end up getting a critscrigged kill with

67
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,970
the huntsman. And it was just pure luck. One second he had it on me and I got the kill with it.

68
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:10,410
And I still can't believe we came back from such a huge deficit. Because I mean, we were down to

69
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,610
one second at the first point and less than five or six minutes later we win the game.

70
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,250
That is just unbelievable to me. And I give a huge standing ovation to my teammates.

71
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,930
We were in Skype saying, Oh my God, this is great. What an awesome comeback. And it really was. So

72
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,170
thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And I will see you guys all

73
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,370
next time. So take care, everybody.
