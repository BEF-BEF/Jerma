00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,759
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Germa here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:23,760
And tonight, I'm gonna be playing as the Demoman with the lock and load, the shield that protects you from flames,

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,760
and the eye-lander and the half-satoichi. I take off the eye-lander like halfway through this video,

4
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,759
because it just wasn't helping me at all. It was actually making things worse for me because I was getting killed.

5
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:41,759
Anyways, we've got some stuff to talk about today. We've got something very important, very, very huge announcement from Valve.

6
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,759
And it's ongoing. It is concurrently happening. There is three announcements they are doing.

7
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:50,759
And it's all gonna be about this new Steam operating system.

8
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,000
Now, this is something that I was talking about with friends for a long time. I really, truly...

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,299
Well, first of all, before I get into that, Valve has announced that they are making their own operating system,

10
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:12,299
just like Windows and OS X or Macintosh. They're trying to get into the hardware market with their own operating system.

11
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:20,540
And what a lot of people assume is going to be their own console, the Steam console with their Steam operating system based on Linux.

12
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:26,540
That's why they've been pushing the whole Linux thing for a while now. They've ported a lot of their games to Linux.

13
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,540
They've been working closely with Linux. It's gonna be their own console.

14
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,280
Now, the reason why this is a big deal is mainly because of one very, very important thing.

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,780
PC gaming is in the minority right now.

16
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:51,189
Not very many people have capable PCs that they can run powerful games on and get 60 frames per second, sick graphics, smooth gameplay.

17
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:56,370
It's an expensive thing, right? But it's the best platform.

18
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:02,370
Like, PC games, if you run your computer and you play a game on PC and then you go and do the same thing on a console,

19
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:10,539
it is drastically different. It is so different sometimes that it hurts your head to go back and play it on a console.

20
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:18,539
Most console games run at like 25 to 30 frames per second, which if you're a PC gamer and you have a high-end machine

21
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,539
and you're used to running games at over 60 frames per second, it's a very noticeable difference.

22
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:30,539
It's very noticeable, especially when you're trying to do sharp turns in a car or whip around really fast in an FPS.

23
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,539
It's very like blindingly different when you play on the different platforms.

24
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:44,780
So Valve wants to try to get this minority that, oh, if you don't have a $1,500 machine and a giant space on the wall of one of your rooms,

25
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,780
you can't play PC games. I think they're trying to get rid of that.

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,960
I think they're trying to make it so they can build an affordable living room console steam machine

27
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,960
to be able to run all these games at the best like settings that they possibly can run at.

28
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:10,500
And on top of that, it's been clearly stated by Valve's different executives, by Gabe Newell, by a lot of people,

29
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:17,810
that they don't like Windows 8. Gabe Newell actually said in an interview a while ago that he thinks Windows 8 is a catastrophe.

30
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,810
That's a direct quote. So I can kind of agree with that to an extent.

31
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,810
I'm not a big fan of Windows 8. I don't like the tiles, the touchscreen metro system that they're trying to go towards.

32
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:36,539
I'm not a big fan of it. So with that being said, why wouldn't Valve make their own gaming enthusiast centered operating system?

33
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:41,539
If all these operating systems that they're typically used to are kind of going in the wrong directions in their opinion,

34
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:49,909
why wouldn't they do this? And it's a great idea. And I'm so glad to see this because I foresee in the next five to ten years,

35
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:54,909
people won't be playing PC games on Windows 10 like or Windows 11.

36
00:03:54,909 --> 00:04:00,909
If Microsoft's going to take their direction that they're going to take and they're going to move towards the tablet-based computer

37
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:05,909
and the touch screens, if they're going to abandon sort of the keyboard and mouse, which I don't think they ever will,

38
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:11,219
but if they ever do decide to do that, Valve's Linux operating system is going to be there.

39
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,219
It's going to be there for us to enjoy. It's going to be here for a long time.

40
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:21,220
And this is really just a prototype. This Steam box, you know, Steam OS, bring Steam to your living room.

41
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,220
This is very much a beta and they're testing out a lot of things. They're doing a lot of experiments.

42
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,459
And it's incredibly exciting to see this because we could be witnessing a change in the paradigm.

43
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:38,459
We could be witnessing, I almost want to say a split in what the personal computer is designed to do.

44
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:45,629
The personal computer back in the day was never designed for all this, was never designed for you to be playing video games on it.

45
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:51,629
It was only until the last decade really, this past millennium, when people started to see it was possible

46
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:55,629
and started to really put a lot of effort into punching into PC gaming.

47
00:04:55,629 --> 00:05:01,629
So I think right now you're going to see a split. The PC, the personal computer, is going to split off into two different ways.

48
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:08,629
It used to be one entity. Now it's splitting off like a fucking jellyfish that just got cut in half.

49
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:15,629
You know what I mean? There's going to be the PC gaming technology enthusiast side that I think is going to gravitate towards Steam

50
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:20,629
and towards Linux and towards all that stuff. And then you got the other side, which is gravitating towards the tablets

51
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:26,629
and the touch screens and the Microsoft Word and the personal computer. It's becoming a split.

52
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:34,129
And it makes perfect sense because for the longest time, people were so afraid to get a PC and do PC gaming.

53
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:42,129
The keyboard and mouse, what folder am I installing this in? Where is it? Where's the CD key? I don't know how to turn it on.

54
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:49,129
People were always afraid because it wasn't a box that sat in your living room that you put a disc in and then hit play.

55
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:53,129
It's very easy to play on a console. It's not really that difficult at all.

56
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,500
But it's really exciting news nonetheless, and that's really going to wrap up the video, guys.

57
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,500
If you don't know what the hell I'm talking about, then just check the link in the description.

58
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,500
There's going to be some info there on the Steam OS.

59
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Still a couple of announcements. They have still like two announcements to make.

60
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,500
I don't know what they're going to be, but they're going to be related to the Steam in your living room quote project.

61
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,740
And I'm going to leave it there. So exciting stuff. Let me know what you think in the comments section, guys.

62
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,740
And I'll see you guys all next time. Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

63
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,550
And of course, take care, everybody.
