00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,019
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with chapter 3 of Nightmare House 2.

2
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:21,839
Before we get started, crack open a fresh Dr. Pepper. Cherry Dr. Pepper. I actually haven't had this.

3
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:31,539
So let's see how good this is. Ah, smooth cherry Dr. Pepper. It's been too long, doctor.

4
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:40,670
Alright, so let's just go here. There's my bed. Pretty disheveled. Looks like a rotten corpse was lying on that.

5
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:51,939
Chair, get out of my face. Nothing in... No, let's just go. Time to go. Hello!

6
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:57,179
I remember that guy. I remember that guy from the end of the last chapter. God!

7
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:03,409
Don't want to have to deal with that guy.

8
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,590
Okay, so if I go into the maintenance room, I'm going to light on fire. Sweet!

9
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:23,500
Anything in here? Where's my flashlight? My flashlight wasn't even turned on.

10
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,769
Um, I don't think there's anything in here. I'm taking the gun out, though, because that thing...

11
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:36,060
Oh, I hate this chapter already, and I haven't even started playing.

12
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:46,459
Oh, can I open this door? No, but... Can I break this?

13
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:51,219
So what is this for? Well, how come I can... Oh, I can blow a hole in the wall, can't I?

14
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:56,859
Oh, what? No, I can't. Oh, yeah, I can. Cool.

15
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:09,870
So what the hell was in here? Oh, storage. Okay. I didn't mean to shoot the gun.

16
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:18,500
Ooh, a revolver. No, I didn't die. That's not that long.

17
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:32,699
Yeah, the little girl. She's a freak. Yeah, easier said than done.

18
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:44,349
By the way, where is this guy? How come he's not, like, chased by monsters?

19
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:51,169
Okay. Will do. So that guy's just not being attacked or anything. He's just kind of...

20
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:53,169
I thought the fire was a monster.

21
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:59,650
Ah! What the hell's going on? Oh, it was the fire again!

22
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,949
Man, I'm losing my mind here, guys.

23
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:11,180
Oh, that's nothing. Yeah. Nice, nice. Why? Why? Why? Why is it saying that?

24
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,580
Why does it keep saying that? Don't look behind you. Don't look behind you.

25
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:22,680
Dude, there's no vent here. Unless I can, like, blow this up.

26
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:32,099
Oh, okay, here it is. I would call this the first washing machine and not the third washing machine.

27
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:45,080
Another vent. Fantastic. Where's my gun? Ah! Is this thing you wear in a bikini?

28
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
Oh, no, that's just, like, charred flesh.

29
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,219
I'm just going to pre... Oh, I lost all my bullets in my revolver. Good job, Jerma.

30
00:03:53,219 --> 00:04:11,240
That wasn't totally stupid. What? Hi. Oh, no! I hate these vents so much. Come on!

31
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:18,000
All right, home free. Home free. Ooh. Okay, we're good.

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,069
God, those things are so nerve-wracking. Charge the flashlight.

33
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:30,980
Can I go in? Okay. Somebody's in the bathroom. Nope.

34
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:40,209
Anything of interest in here? I don't think so. Nope. Let's go.

35
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:48,569
Flashlight. Thank you. This looks very bad. No bullets. Bullets. Bullets. Good.

36
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:55,220
What just laughed at me? That just sounded like somebody went...

37
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:08,420
Okay. What? Red. Everything's red. No flashlight works. No flashlight works.

38
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:15,790
Hey, lady. That's the lady. Come here. I want to question you.

39
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:23,019
I have some things to ask you, lady. Why are you such a creep?

40
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:32,980
I know that weird thing that was walking on four legs is going to appear and then puke on me.

41
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:44,730
I want this thing. This thing is dead. Flares? Turn that on. Does that do anything?

42
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:51,300
These look like flares. Okay, they are flares. What do I do with them? What do I do with the flares?

43
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,480
Oh. I need... I need four of these? Oh, it must be in here. Has to be. Yep, there it is.

44
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,730
Final power supply. Thank you very much. I'll turn the power back on in just one second, folks.

45
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:11,100
Pick it up! Pick it up, you bastard! Oh, my God. Get these stupid boxes out of my face.

46
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:19,860
Here we are. Just one moment, folks. Power be okay. There we are. Thank you. Turn it on.

47
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:32,939
And that is one big machine. Hey, there's the power. I'll take a sip of my Dr. Pepper now.

48
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:43,990
I'll take that as a reward. So now that that's turned on, can I just get out of the room now?

49
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:52,459
Yeah, yeah, I can. Fantastic. Cool. Here's the light for this room. Bullets, I'll take them.

50
00:06:52,459 --> 00:07:01,670
And this... Hey, how are you? Eat lead. This guy's taking way too many hits. Come...

51
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:17,720
Get out of my face! Eat this! That's not working. Yeah, I'll take like 19 bullets in my face. That's fine.

52
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:29,500
That lady just appeared and I didn't like it. Come on. I'm going to turn around and these things are going to get up off the ground.

53
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:38,129
Guarantee it. Ready? One, two, three. No, not quite. I thought that was what was going to happen, but I was wrong.

54
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:51,250
What the hell? What the... Come on, man. This is ridiculous. You're going to get me like seasickness.

55
00:07:51,250 --> 00:08:00,329
What the hell is that? What the hell is going on? Stop flickering. When you stop flickering, you're going to give me a migraine.

56
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:07,699
Get me out of here. Get me out of here. Climb the ladder. I don't even know where I am.

57
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:25,980
Somebody just said, Psst. Oh, I hate you. Can I drop down? Am I going to die if I drop down?

58
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:33,360
Yes. No, I'm not. Okay, cool. Okay, guys. Literally, I can't even see where I'm going. I'm just walking.

59
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:43,360
I'm just literally walking wherever I can go and falling in places. Up the pipe. We are now up out of the pipe.

60
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:57,990
Let's get out of here. Sweet. Sweet deal. And we have made it out of that. Hopefully we got out of that place with all the BS.

61
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:05,539
I seriously almost puked. Now where the hell am I? Can I go down here, it looks like?

62
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:14,730
All right. Thank God I'm out of that place. You're talking about just me throwing up.

63
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:25,980
What? Why are these things just coming out of nowhere? That thing just jumped at me and died.

64
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:35,840
What kind of a monster is that? I jump at you and die in midair. Get out of here. Recharge the batteries.

65
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:44,740
You're not dead. These things... Ready? Here we go. I knew it. Wrong one.

66
00:09:52,230 --> 00:10:05,759
Let's go. Oh, now I'm talking about brightness. That was the brightest damn thing I've ever seen.

67
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:14,309
Can't do anything in here, it looks like. I can take my protein powder. Let's get out of here.

68
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:20,740
Check this door for any creeps. This thing just closed on its own, which means I bet you there's somebody in here having fun, hanging out.

69
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:32,740
Yep, this guy. How you doing, sir? Nothing. Which means... God! I got no light now.

70
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:42,600
How am I supposed to see where I'm going? How am I supposed to do this? Oh, there we go.

71
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:52,059
Everything's slow motion. Everything is slow mo. I don't like when things are slow mo. Get me out of here.

72
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:57,990
Get... God, that hurts every time. Get me out of here.

73
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:04,320
Alright, when she does that again, I'm not going to scream. Promise you. I'm just going to go like this.

74
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:20,019
Can't get in there. What the hell is going on? What is going on? Whoa.

75
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:30,769
Alright, listen. I don't like this. What is that? What the hell is going on? What the hell? Stop it.

76
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:47,580
Those are perfectly good beds. Can I at least take my protein powder? I gotta go in here, I think. Right? Yeah.

77
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,340
I can't even see where I'm going. I need this for the light.

78
00:11:52,340 --> 00:12:00,779
There has been... I've jumped more times in this video than I think in all the Nightmare House videos combined.

79
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:06,779
And it's not even things that are scary. It's just like dumb things. Like falling off a ledge or being touched by fire.

80
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:11,580
Nothing like really that terrifying has happened. I'm just freaking out.

81
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:25,059
Um, okay. I'm missing something. What is it I'm missing? I'm not entirely sure. Man, this is so dark.

82
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:30,700
I need to like cheat and turn up the brightness. Wasn't that just a door here?

83
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:36,090
Okay, there was legitimately just a door, a thing right here. Where the hell did it go?

84
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:52,289
What? What's going on? What the hell is happening? What? What is going on here? Why am I like trapped in this room?

85
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:04,740
Um, are these walls getting smaller or something? Or am I just stupid and like not knowing how to go out of here?

86
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:10,539
Is there like a ladder? There has to be like a ladder. What is going on?

87
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:18,710
Dude, these walls are like closing in on me. I knew it. So what am I supposed to do? I'm gonna get crushed. I'm gonna get squished.

88
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:24,720
I'm gonna get squished. I'm gonna get squished. Where do I go? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.

89
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:53,529
Ah! What the hell? Dr. Peppa, let's drink it, baby. Oh my god. Okay. Is that the end of that chapter? It is.

90
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:59,899
It is. Goodness gracious. Well, thank you guys all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

91
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:07,269
And I'll catch you guys all soon. See you next week for Scare Saturdays. Woohoo!

92
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,490
I did not think that was gonna happen. I just thought there was gonna be computers.

93
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,840
Alright, guys. See you all soon. Oh, and I almost forgot. Take care, everybody.
