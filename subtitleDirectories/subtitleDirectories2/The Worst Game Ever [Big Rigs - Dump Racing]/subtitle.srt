1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,380
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerva here with big rigs over the road racing.

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:25,949
This video, I got a request to do this because I've been doing some weird games and some old like shitty games like you've probably seen.

3
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:33,500
And this is supposed to be like the coup de grace of bad games. This is supposed to be the worst game ever made.

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,799
Like this game, when they sold this game initially, it was a slap in the face to any consumer that bought this game.

5
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:50,799
If you're one of those people, if you're old now and you're in your 60s and you bought this game for your son or something like that, I'm real fucking sorry because this game is awful.

6
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,979
And I don't know how I'm going to make this video because nothing matters.

7
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:06,719
Forgotten Road 1. Why? Why do these all have numbers? Devil's Passage 2? Forgotten Road 1? What the hell, man?

8
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:13,540
All right, let's just go. Something you probably already have noticed is this game does not have any audio.

9
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:20,260
There's no sound. There is no sound to this game at all. I don't even know what's supposed to be happening.

10
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:26,260
This guy to my left is supposed to be racing me. Big rigs over the road racing. He won't even leave the start.

11
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:32,129
Whatever. No audio. So I'll make my own like sound effects, I guess.

12
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:43,379
What the fuck? I can't even make a video on this game. I can't do it.

13
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:50,620
There's nothing to say about this game. I would normally would be making some kind of joke or talking. It's crashed.

14
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,620
Game over. No, it's not. It just froze.

15
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,620
Let me back up and then maybe there'll be like some kinetic motion.

16
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:05,319
Wow. Unbelievable. The wheels aren't even like spinning. This is horrible.

17
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,879
We're going to drive up this mountain because I hear you can do that.

18
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,569
I hear you can just drive up mountains in this game and have absolutely no issue doing that.

19
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:24,599
All right, let's go camping, honey. Oh, yay. What the hell is this? What is this color scheme?

20
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,159
Look at how out of place this is. Who painted this?

21
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,159
Some like vandal came over here and like graffitied this thing.

22
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,719
Why is it blue and bright neon purple and blue?

23
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,659
That's it. There's no other lamp. What does that lamp achieve?

24
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:43,969
There's no other lamps on this whole entire level.

25
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:45,969
Well, let's go over the bridge again.

26
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:50,719
I know where I'm going, sweetie. This is a different way.

27
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,719
We're going camping. We're going to meet your family up this way.

28
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,719
And you need to shut the fuck up about it, okay?

29
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:03,719
Because I know exactly what I'm doing. I know exactly where I'm going.

30
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:24,050
No. No, that's not the right way.

31
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,439
That's not the right way. Am I playing GTA?

32
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,939
Is this like the truck punch line from GTA?

33
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:35,430
Oh, my God. This is freaking out.

34
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,169
Oh, we made it back. It's okay. Don't worry.

35
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:45,750
I hope you guys are enjoying this new game. It's brand new. It's really cool.

36
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,750
It's called Magnet Car, the game.

37
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,750
Where somebody is holding a magnet underneath a table and dragging it around.

38
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,750
Because that's the exact mechanics of this game.

39
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,750
Somebody is dragging a fucking magnet underneath a table.

40
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,060
And I'm a magnet. That's the only way I can describe this game.

41
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:08,909
Why was this made? Who made this game?

42
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:12,500
I'm going to actually try to complete this level.

43
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
I'm seriously going to try to complete this.

44
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,759
Just going to go through each checkpoint.

45
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,199
I'm not going to drive up a wall because that's just like dumb.

46
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,980
Oh, look at how much fun this is.

47
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,540
Hold on. I know I got to do it.

48
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,540
It's almost a 90 degree angle. I got to do it.

49
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Sick Tony Hawk ramp.

50
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,480
I'm playing on a half pipe right now.

51
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,490
Let me do like a 720. It's Tony Hawk Pro Skater.

52
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,300
All right. Hold on. Hold on. All right. Fun's over. Go through.

53
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,860
Go through. This is awful.

54
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,060
This game is fucking awful.

55
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,259
Truly, truly a disgraceful game.

56
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:08,850
I can't think of anything worse. I really can't think of a game that's worse than this.

57
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,860
This isn't even a video game.

58
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,500
This is not even a video game.

59
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Oh, here's a bridge. Oh, good bridge.

60
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,740
That was fun.

61
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,069
It was fun going over something with no detection on it.

62
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,829
Can you? I don't know, man.

63
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:31,829
If somebody can tell me in the comment section a game that's worse than this,

64
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:34,839
it's going to be pretty tough.

65
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,339
I can't. I can't think of anything.

66
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,899
Not not. Oh, no, it's OK.

67
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:43,069
Oh, look, there's my buddy.

68
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:45,069
There's my friend. Hey.

69
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,500
Hey, remember when you.

70
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
You are a winner.

71
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,740
Oh, hey, don't worry, guys. You are winner.

72
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,019
We'll do random race.

73
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,019
Random race sounds like fun.

74
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:05,589
All right. We're looking.

75
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:11,379
What? What?

76
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:12,379
I didn't do anything.

77
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,879
Why did I just win the game?

78
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,660
It didn't. I didn't even have a chance to move.

79
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,660
What? Do it again.

80
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,730
That was stupid.

81
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,730
All right. Thanks for the win.

82
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,730
I'll take the victory.

83
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,730
I'll have my KD go up or my win loss go up.

84
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,060
What the fuck?

85
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,360
Stop doing this.

86
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,430
Random race.

87
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,610
Third time's a charm.

88
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,610
Stop giving me the victory automatically.

89
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,610
This game is trying to tell me to stop playing.

90
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,360
Ready?

91
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,540
You are winner.

92
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,660
All right.

93
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:57,420
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

94
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
What if we do?

95
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,420
What if we pick it?

96
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,420
What if we forced the game to pick a level?

97
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,860
Small town road.

98
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,160
Game crash.

99
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,850
Oh, great.

100
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,850
The game crashed.
