1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:08,669
So here he is, the man of the hour, the medic. If you haven't seen Meet the Medic already, go see it right now. It's amazing.

2
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:16,670
The new needle gun is the overdose. 10% less damage done, but your movement speed increases based on the amount of ubercharge you have.

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:23,910
The new medigun is the quick fix. Everyone already knew what this was. It was in beta, just like the detonator.

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,910
Faster heal rate, faster ubercharge rate, but you can't overheal anybody.

5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,409
And your ubercharge is a 300% faster heal and immunity to movement impairing effects.

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:37,409
And this thing, I had to buy this. It just lets you see enemy health.

7
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:42,899
By the way, sets do absolutely nothing. As you can see, I have the full set of this.

8
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:51,899
So, the quick fix is kind of an odd duck. I think it's weird because it takes everything you've known about the medic and it flips it upside down.

9
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,899
See, right here I'm healing a bunch of people over and over again and running around, trying to overheal people.

10
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:05,400
It's just kind of a habit that you have as a medic. You have to lose that when you have the quick fix because you don't have to do this.

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,400
The only reason why you do this in the beginning, of course, is to build up an uber.

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,400
But it's completely unnecessary in any other situation.

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,400
I think the actual ubercharge on this thing, it's just kind of odd. It's trying to be like three or four different things.

14
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,900
You know, with the knockback immunity, the extra heal rate, and I don't know, I just feel like it's trying to be too many things.

15
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:36,900
If they just got rid of the uber completely and made it, instead of 40%, like 60% better heal, I bet you people would still use it and still love it.

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,900
So, speaking of the uber of this gun, why don't we take a look and see what it does?

17
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,900
I actually kind of freak out here. I don't really do it so well. I get kind of lost in what I'm doing.

18
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,400
I keep thinking it's going to be like an ubercharge, but like I said, it's just not.

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,400
The heal rate is great, though. As you can tell, I just popped it. It's hard to tell if you popped it or not.

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,400
It looks kind of like the Amputator taunt.

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:06,400
And that was it. You just saw it. It was faster heal rate for 10 seconds.

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
I don't know.

23
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,400
The actual heal rate on this thing is amazing.

24
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,900
As you can see, that scout was at zero health and I brought him all the way up to full in less than pretty much a second.

25
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,900
So the actual heal rate is great. Like I said, the uber is just nothing to me. I'm not a big fan of it.

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,900
I probably have to give it some more time. That's probably the problem that I'm having.

27
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,900
But, see right here, the soldier just had no health and now he's at full.

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,400
It's just, it's an incredible, it's a good, I want to say raid healer, if anyone knows what I'm talking about when I say raid healer.

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,400
That'll throw back to some World of Warcraft players or some LoTRO players or whoever you are.

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
It's a raid healing gun. Let's put it that way.

31
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:57,770
Where this thing actually excels is in situations like this, where you have to outheal damage.

32
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,770
See, this soldier probably would have just died right here if it wasn't for the quick fix.

33
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:07,270
The crit screak and the regular medic gun would have definitely failed in that situation.

34
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:14,270
So, the other items. First of all, I thought the new melee unlockable for the medic was a hat.

35
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:21,270
And I was psyched about it. I was like, oh my god, that's an awesome, I hope that's a miscellaneous, that would be so funny.

36
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:28,270
But it turns out it's a melee weapon and with identical stats as the default bone saw.

37
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,770
But you get to see player's health, enemy's health, and that's a huge bonus.

38
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:40,770
But I don't know if I'm willing to give up some of the other saws, like the uber saw or the amputator, they're just so good.

39
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,770
It's going to take a little more time using them to find that out.

40
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:51,949
The sniper got a couple of items in this update. Most notably the Bazar Bargain, the new sniper rifle.

41
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:59,449
Base charge rate is decreased by 20%. Each scoped headshot decreases the weapon's charge time by I think it's 10%.

42
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:05,449
A scoped body shot or a missed shot wipes the charge. No new secondary for the sniper this time.

43
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:14,449
But a new knife, the shashahashashashasha, which essentially is just the equalizer without the speed increase.

44
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,689
So this is what it looks like just at base level. I haven't shot anybody yet.

45
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:22,189
And see there's a little indicator on the lower right that says heads.

46
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:26,189
Sort of like the Demoman's Eyelander or the Clyde & Moore.

47
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:30,189
But here's one headshot here and there's another one I believe right here.

48
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:35,189
So this is what it looks like with two and it looks pretty normal, maybe a little bit higher.

49
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:39,189
It looks about the same as it would be with the regular sniper rifle.

50
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:46,189
To consistently do well with this sniper rifle you have to know what you're doing as a sniper.

51
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:51,689
They came out with a Sydney Sleeper for the people that couldn't really aim too well.

52
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,689
And then they came out with this which was the pro sniper rifle.

53
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:01,689
So I'm a very bad sniper so I think I only get a maximum, I think I get three.

54
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:09,689
So yeah, I can't really demonstrate this too well because I only get three headshots so we'll see what it looks like after three.

55
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:16,189
I'm pretty sure the max is probably seven or eight. I'm wondering what the max is for the Eyelander.

56
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:23,189
So as you can see it is pretty much, right there it looks like it's the same as the Sydney Sleeper is now after the buff.

57
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:29,189
So I'm guessing after four or five headshots in a row you will really start to see this thing shine.

58
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:32,189
These are just a couple of kills with the new knife.

59
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:38,189
The new knife like I said is the equalizer which means that you do more damage when you take more damage.

60
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:42,689
I think it's when you get to half health you do like 25% more damage or something like that.

61
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:47,689
And we end with the Spy. The Spy got two new items in this update.

62
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:51,689
The first that he got is a new revolver, it's called the Enforcer.

63
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:59,689
20% damage done over the regular revolver and a half a second increase in cloak time which we'll talk about in a second.

64
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:05,689
He got a new knife, the Big Earner, plus 30 cloak on kill, I'm not sure if that means backstab or not.

65
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:10,189
And 25 less health on wear so you have 100 health as the Spy.

66
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:13,490
So let's go over the Enforcer, it is the new revolver.

67
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:22,490
It's 20% more damage and it is a straight upgrade, that's right it's a straight upgrade to the regular revolver if you use the Dead Ringer.

68
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,490
I say that because the Dead Ringer is not affected by the decrease in cloak time.

69
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,990
Only the regular invisibility watch and the cloak and dagger are affected by the decrease in cloak time.

70
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,990
So let's talk about the knife now.

71
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,990
Take a look at my cloak in the lower right and watch this, bang.

72
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,990
This knife is also another one of those straight upgrades over the original.

73
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,990
Mainly because the downside is really not that bad.

74
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:57,990
You only are taking a 25 health hit, I mean the Kunai is a 65 health hit so you're not losing that much health at all.

75
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:03,990
So for the purposes of showing you the downside of the revolver I'm going to use the regular cloak.

76
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,990
So you'll see here, I come out here and I get a kill, watch my cloak bar, it's going to fill right up.

77
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:17,990
And then watch this, that right there, that little half second right there is going to throw you off so bad.

78
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,990
I highly recommend using the Dead Ringer with this set.

79
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,990
Not really the knife but definitely, definitely the revolver portion of the set.

80
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:33,420
And that is all I have for you guys. I'm sorry that I had to split it up into two videos.

81
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,420
But you don't know how horrible this was to make.

82
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,420
It took a long time. I hope you guys appreciate it.

83
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,420
I hope somebody gets something out of it because I did.

84
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:54,420
I did. I learned how to tear my hair out of my skull because item servers weren't working and oh my god, I don't even get me started.

85
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,420
But yeah, like, comment, subscribe, do whatever you guys want to do.

86
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:06,420
I hope you guys enjoy the new items and I'm glad I could bring at least some information to somebody who is on the fence about something.

87
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,420
So thanks again, take care guys, I'll see you next time.
