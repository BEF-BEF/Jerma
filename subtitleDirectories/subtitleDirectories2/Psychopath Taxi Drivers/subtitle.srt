Press enter to select Sexy Layla, Tough John, or Sleazy Estelle.

2
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:27,800
There you are, hurry up, we have a passenger to pick up. He's waiting for us at the El Banana Bar.

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,729
Alright, fine. He's waiting for us at the Banana Bar.

4
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,289
So you're the new guy, I'm Hank. I'll show you around and teach you how to drive.

5
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:40,909
Thanks a lot, Hank. I appreciate that.

6
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:46,299
Get there as fast as possible. If you're too late, the competition will have your passengers.

7
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:50,299
So, we're fighting over taxi passengers? Is that what's going on?

8
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,890
Take shortcuts whenever you can.

9
00:00:53,890 --> 00:01:00,890
Wait, what? The faster and safer you jump just driving into stuff.

10
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,829
That wasn't safe at all.

11
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,420
So these are the passengers.

12
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,980
Alright, hey, where are they going? No, it's a setup. Ah, we have to get out of here.

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,540
What's a setup?

14
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,969
What is a setup?

15
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:17,969
What is a setup?

16
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,500
What do you mean it's a setup?

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,629
Wait, how do I drive the car?

18
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:31,629
I don't understand. Why would a taxi company set you up?

19
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:33,629
Is there a reason for this?

20
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:36,629
A rival taxi company? What?

21
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,579
I just, I just don't get it.

22
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,140
I just don't get it.

23
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,140
Why do these guys want to have a taxi battle?

24
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,140
You know what I mean? What the, what?

25
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,140
Where did that car even go?

26
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,579
I'll show you a taxi battle.

27
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,579
See you later, Frank.

28
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:57,579
This is my pickup.

29
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,659
Get in the car.

30
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,659
Ow, my, my head.

31
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:10,659
Oh my god, guys, I'm gonna die.

32
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,539
Oh, hold on.

33
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,099
How do I steal the passenger back?

34
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:20,400
How do I steal this guy back?

35
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,819
150 bucks? That's easy, buddy.

36
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,819
Come on in, honey. Let's move.

37
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:35,979
So, that's never gonna get old.

38
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:40,979
The car boogers coming out of the giant's sneezing nose is never gonna get old, ever.

39
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:42,979
That's what that is.

40
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:46,979
What kind of force is that? Like, seriously, why would that ever happen to a car?

41
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:49,979
Unless it was coming out of a giant's nose during a sneeze.

42
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:51,979
Watch this, ready?

43
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:57,210
Out of the way. Out of the way.

44
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,770
This passenger's mine.

45
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,259
Sorry, Jerry.

46
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:04,949
Maybe next time, Jerry.

47
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:08,409
Maybe next time, Jerry.

48
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:11,219
Maybe next time, Jerry.

49
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:15,300
Thank you very much.

50
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,620
No, get away. Get away from me.

51
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,030
Please, get away from me, Jerry.

52
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,229
Here it is, around this corner.

53
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:33,050
Just be careful.

54
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,050
Don't get knocked off the edge.

55
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,349
Okay, secret. I found the secret.

56
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:40,349
This is no secret.

57
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:42,979
Bad driver.

58
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:46,539
It seriously took you that fucking long to figure that out?

59
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:50,250
He's right behind me.

60
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,250
Can I lure him off the side of the road here?

61
00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:01,719
Nope. He's too quick.

62
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,719
Where the hell did I just go?

63
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,020
Oh, great. Oh, great.

64
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:15,039
I'm going to bait you into this gas station and you're going to explode.

65
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,220
Whether you want to or not, it's gonna happen.

66
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,480
Here you come.

67
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,480
Yeah, good for you.

68
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,779
Good for you.

69
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,779
Come this way. Drive straight into this.

70
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:34,060
Now he's stuck.

71
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,060
I got him. I got him right where I want him.

72
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,639
Yeah, that was not the correct thing to do.

73
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,639
I'm not sure you know this, but that was really stupid for you to do that.

74
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,069
And your head is coming through the top.

75
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:50,069
I don't think you're alive anymore, but to tell you the truth,

76
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:52,069
I don't think you ever were to begin with.

77
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:56,040
So we're just going to keep going.

78
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Man, that's not a good place to be standing.

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,660
If you want a taxi ride, I understand.

80
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,850
But you're going to have to be safer, buddy. You're going to have to get...

81
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,850
Would this person really be doing this for like an extra 15 bucks?

82
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,970
No, he wouldn't.

83
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,970
I win the taxi battle.

84
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,170
Jesus, Harry.

85
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,410
Let me just drop the passenger off.

86
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:32,730
Well, I lost the game.

87
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,290
Game's over.

88
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,550
I have no more taxi.

89
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,550
We're raining taxis from the sky now.

90
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,550
That's what we're doing now?

91
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,550
That's where we're going with this game?

92
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,500
You got to be fucking kidding me.
