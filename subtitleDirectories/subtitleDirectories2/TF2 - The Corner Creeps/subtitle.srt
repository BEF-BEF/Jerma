1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,849
No, you see, I pocket medic you all the time. It's time for you to pocket medic me.

2
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:15,980
Have you ever been pocket medic by like a god?

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:23,980
Can't say that I have.

4
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,850
So we're going up here?

5
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,560
And then where to? Where to, Master?

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,560
No, you're the soldier, you're the leader.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,560
Alright, but that's not what you said last time.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,570
So I'm just gonna have you lead us to doors that don't open. Oh my god.

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,829
I was gonna say something before you got there too, but I just wanted to make sure you're like, don't know what you're doing.

10
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,829
Hold on, hold on. Okay, we have to go up here.

11
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,829
Come on up here.

12
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:54,289
Don't pop it. Don't pop it.

13
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:56,590
Don't pop it.

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,590
Hold on to it. Don't pop it.

15
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,590
Not only is there gonna need to be a scenario where there's a lot of people, but I'm also gonna have to believe you can kill them, which might not happen.

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,980
Don't pop it.

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,980
I'm not. Kill the sniper before he shoots me in the head.

18
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,980
He's not gonna. I got him.

19
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,609
Don't pop it.

20
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,609
Alright, what I need to do here is I need you to pop it.

21
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,579
There it is.

22
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:22,579
Oh, I got him.

23
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:24,579
Don't worry. I'll take care of my medic friend.

24
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:26,579
Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,579
Oh, damn. What's that? More crits.

26
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:33,359
Look out for the sticky.

27
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,900
I'm trying to like help you.

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,900
I shot.

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,900
Wow. Good miss.

30
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,790
Alright, pop it.

31
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,739
Pop it. Come on.

32
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:55,549
You didn't even see him.

33
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,730
I was waiting for him to backstab you and you accidentally kill a dude.

34
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,819
I can't believe I accidentally just killed that guy.

35
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:07,819
He's up top.

36
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,819
Come over here.

37
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:15,250
I don't want you to die.

38
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,870
You think I'm gonna die?

39
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,870
That's cute.

40
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,620
Alright, you ready?

41
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,759
Oh, shit.

42
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,000
I like that first rocket straight into the ground.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,500
What about that rocket? You like that one?

44
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,930
Now we do this.

45
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,409
Come here, cupcake.

46
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,479
No one ever goes out of that door, you know.

47
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,979
What happened? Look at the kill feed.

48
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:46,180
Did you kill what?

49
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,659
What happened? Who killed me?

50
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:52,659
He's fucking messy here, by the way.

51
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:55,090
Get a fucking comb.

52
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,090
Would you comb me here with a Snickers bar today, medic?

53
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,090
Fine, I'm going back to spawn and change.

54
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,090
No, no, no, no. Come back.

55
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,090
I'm sorry. That was mean.

56
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,090
No, changing it.

57
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,330
No, don't. It looks nice.

58
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,300
Doesn't look all messy. It looks fine.

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,110
Oh, he died.

60
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,110
Aim indoor and fire crit rockets indoor.

61
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,110
Stand in front of the door.

62
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,110
Here comes a guy. Use it.

63
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,259
Kill him. No, just kill him.

64
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:26,259
Face to the door. Not him.

65
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:31,300
Wait, don't shoot.

66
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,300
Next time it opens.

67
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,560
No, they're going to open it again.

68
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:43,539
This is a suck.

69
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:45,539
Let's go build it again. Let's go.

70
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,539
Don't kill him.

71
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:50,539
What do you mean don't kill him?

72
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:52,539
I mean, because I can ubersaw and I would have got it.

73
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,539
I'm going to die.

74
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,539
Are you going to die?

75
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,539
No, boy, they know, they know, they know.

76
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,810
They're like pushing down here now.

77
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:07,870
Run, run.

78
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,870
You have to commit to the joke, Star. Don't you know how that works?

79
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,689
Hide down here.

80
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,689
Do you have a shotgun?

81
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,689
How come you never use it?

82
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,689
I do. What are you talking about?

83
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:20,689
I've never seen you use it.

84
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:22,689
Oh yeah, you killed that spy, but that was like a joke too.

85
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:24,689
No.

86
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:26,689
Wait, they're right there.

87
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:28,689
Nobody ever comes through here though.

88
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:30,689
Oh my god, you're such an idiot.

89
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,689
That's what I was warning you about.

90
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,500
You were looking down that hallway.

91
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Favorite movie. What would you say?

92
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Favorite movie. I saw Amelie recently.

93
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
It was really good. But my favorite movie is probably Coraline.

94
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Have you seen The Life of Pi?

95
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,899
Isn't it P?

96
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:49,069
No, it's Pi. It's pretty good.

97
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:51,069
You'd probably like it.

98
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:53,069
It's an interesting story.

99
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:56,399
Wait, after they cap it.

100
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,399
See, no, they got denied.

101
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,399
Okay, okay, you know what?

102
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,399
Yeah, after they cap it, because then they'll all sort of group up there and start pushing it.

103
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,399
That's sort of what happens.

104
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,300
He did not want that.

106
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,300
Oh, that was great.

107
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,399
Can they please push the fucking cart?

108
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,899
Did you just say did the tiger fart?

109
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:28,899
Yeah, I don't know.

110
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,899
Like, there's a part in the movie where it's a serious movie the whole way.

111
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,899
And then they're on the boat and the tiger just...

112
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,899
And like, PiPi looks over at him and is just like...

113
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,899
You're really going to do that?

114
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:38,899
You think they're going to fart on my boat?

115
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:40,899
You ever think they're going to fart on the boat?

116
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,899
Wouldn't it be funny if Burger Boy farted on your boat?

117
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,899
Wouldn't it be funny if Burger Boy farted on the boat?

118
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,899
I'm just taking a peek.

119
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,899
That would be funny.

120
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,899
No, if you take one peek, I would have laughed my ass off if you got headshot or something.

121
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:52,899
Just for no reason.

122
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,899
You turn the corner and immediately get dropped.

123
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:56,899
Are you trying to tell me that that medic that came in here didn't go tell all his friends that we were in here?

124
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,899
This guy.

125
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,899
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

126
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,899
I got him, I got him.

127
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,899
I just freaked out and killed that guy.

128
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,899
There's a medic with Uber around this corner.

129
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,899
No, he's dead.

130
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:10,899
I freaked out, dude.

131
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:12,899
This guy has given us away.

132
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:14,899
Get the hell out of here, guy.

133
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:16,899
Fine, I'll high five you.

134
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:18,899
I didn't even work.

135
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:20,899
I can't even high five him.

136
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,839
He's stuck on the hill.

137
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,839
We agreed, we're waiting until they get the coffee part.

138
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,839
And we're going with this crits.

139
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,839
Because we're corner creeps.

140
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,839
Do you know how to corner creep?

141
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,839
Have you ever corner creeped before in your life?

142
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,139
I got arrested.

143
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:39,540
Okay, this is really boring.

144
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,540
No, I'm committed to this now.

145
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,540
I am committed.

146
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,540
I'm not going to leave.

147
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,540
When you go to do something, you do it to completion.

148
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,540
I'm hiding, I'm crouching.

149
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,540
You're looking around, I'm twitching.

150
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,480
And there's this one same person.

151
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Here comes the Pyro.

152
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Well, he's dead.

153
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
If you die to him, I will never forgive you.

154
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,480
I'm not going to die to him.

155
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Let's just freak somebody out.

156
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
When their spawn door opens, we just pop.

157
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
How about that?

158
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,129
You're so bad.

159
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:14,129
Behind you, I'm going to die.

160
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:16,129
That's not behind you.

161
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:18,129
Oh my god.

162
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:20,129
Did you not get a kill?
