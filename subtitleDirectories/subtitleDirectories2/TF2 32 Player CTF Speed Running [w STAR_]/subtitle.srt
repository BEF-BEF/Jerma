1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,679
We're gonna need either old-fashioned Uber charge for this one. Where are you?

2
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,679
As soon as you start healing me and we leave the door, we got ten minutes to do this.

3
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,859
Alright, wait, so the second I start healing you, we have ten minutes?

4
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:25,859
Yes. Start like the split.

5
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:29,859
Ten minutes.

6
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:31,859
We're not gonna make it across the field here.

7
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:35,859
We're on the right team. Don't get backstabbed.

8
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:37,859
I won't, I won't. I think that's real.

9
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,859
Wow, we're actually making some progress here. We're gonna go up into the vents and see if we can get in here.

10
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:44,859
Oh my god!

11
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:47,859
I think there were 32 people in there.

12
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:50,859
This heavy's gonna burn. Hold on, hold on, be careful.

13
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,859
Okay, I'm in. No, no, forget everyone else.

14
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,859
I'm gonna die.

15
00:00:54,859 --> 00:01:00,270
I love your name, CTF Chaloge.

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,700
Let's go.

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,010
This heavy is so pissed.

18
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,010
Okay, the heavy's going first.

19
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,629
He is so pissed at me too. He's like spamming E. I feel like bad.

20
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:14,829
I almost got an Uber. Don't die yet.

21
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:15,829
Time check.

22
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:17,829
We're just gonna wait for someone to come to this corner because they're going to.

23
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,200
Time check.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,200
I don't have the time. I don't actually have a timer right now.

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
I thought you said you were running splits.

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,200
I'll edit it in after. Oh my god.

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,890
Oh god, tell me when you want it.

28
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,599
Oh, we have it. Let's go, go, go.

29
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,599
Oh my god.

30
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,599
There is so much.

31
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,599
How do you do this?

32
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,030
How do you do this?

33
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,549
You don't, you don't. Okay, we've got them like locked in.

34
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,549
There's like 12 people up here.

35
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:54,549
I don't have ammo. I don't have enough ammo. We're gonna get this.

36
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,549
Watch out for this crit pile. This crit pile is gonna kill everybody.

37
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:02,709
Okay, okay, okay.

38
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,709
We gotta get back in the vent. Back in the vent.

39
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:05,709
This is tense.

40
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,709
They're gonna follow us back here.

41
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,710
Oh no, it's fine. It's fine. I'll lay some stickies.

42
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,710
Oh, you're gonna lay some shit?

43
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,710
There's gotta be a sentry down here.

44
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,710
We need to just build Uber and then go down and we can get this.

45
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,710
Okay.

46
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,020
So I'm gonna lay like a hundred stickies here.

47
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,020
A hundred? You mean, you mean eight?

48
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,020
It's five. Shut up.

49
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,020
One, two, three, four.

50
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,259
Four, five. Build your Uber.

51
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:34,259
When is Valve gonna fix like the fucking Medibeam bug?

52
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:36,259
My Medibeam is going like into the wall.

53
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:39,909
I can't even tell if I'm healing you or not.

54
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,599
Um, well, deal with it.

55
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,599
I got you. Look, now it looks like I'm healing you.

56
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,599
I just have to like move it in a weird direction.

57
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,539
Okay, okay.

58
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,719
Where are we going? Are we going down?

59
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,719
We're going straight down. There's definitely a sentry here.

60
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,719
Alright, you ready?

61
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,719
Go, go, go.

62
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,689
Look at this mess of a room.

63
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:06,689
We're so dead. We're so dead. Get it.

64
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:11,689
There's no way. There's no way. Look how many people there are.

65
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,099
And at that moment, I think the reality dawned on me that no, this isn't possible.

66
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:25,099
I thought, okay, no, maybe with this Uber, we've got Uber, we could do this.

67
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,099
Let's go. Two eggs scrambled.

68
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,099
At least we're on the red team, who's like the one who's up there.

69
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,919
I really don't know if this is...

70
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,099
Someone has it. There's a medic running back with it.

71
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,099
What a champion.

72
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:42,099
Wait, I have to make sure I hear these.

73
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,099
Mountain Dew, boy.

74
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,099
Well, I mean, I did destroy every sentry, so I'm going to take a little bit of credit.

75
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,099
Alright, well, let's get the third one.

76
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,590
We only got to get one more. Oh, we got crits.

77
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,860
We got crits.

78
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,219
Don't die. Don't die, Chalonge.

79
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:06,620
Anything in there? Anything in there?

80
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,620
Can we clean this up now?

81
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,620
Oh, there's a sentry.

82
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,620
I'm dead.

83
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,620
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I can do this.

84
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,620
No.

85
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,980
Would you get Huntsman?

86
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,980
Yes.

87
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,980
Why didn't you shoot the heavy that was right there?

88
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,670
I would have. I would have, but I'm playing Migi.

89
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,670
Dude, I don't want to get outplayed by Mountain Dew, boy, right now.

90
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,670
Dude, Mountain Dew, boy, seriously, like, is the reason why we're going to win this.

91
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,300
Okay, I'm here behind you.

92
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,300
Scout's getting in and getting it.

93
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,300
That's it. We're going to win.

94
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,540
Is it three? Yeah, it's playing three.

95
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,540
Yeah, we got this.

96
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,540
Has it been ten minutes? Have we, like, do our initial challenge?

97
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,540
It's got to have been, like, five minutes. That's my estimation.

98
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,120
Well, we did come in here and there was one tapped.

99
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
We didn't actually get it.

100
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,620
No, we didn't actually do anything.

101
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,620
I don't feel satisfactory about this. That's not even a word.

102
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,620
No, he hasn't actually gotten the thing.

103
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,620
Did he get killed?

104
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,620
We've got to go back and get it.

105
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,620
I'm bumping into a Spy. I don't know where the hell he is.

106
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,620
We've got to come back to the mid.

107
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,079
Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. He's going for me.

108
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,079
He's going for me. He's trying. He's trying his hot. He's trying his hot.

109
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,750
Jeez! I'm so screwed.

110
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,040
Uh, I think Mountain Dewboy has it.

111
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Mountain Dewboy.

112
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,040
If I'm going to be completely honest with you, I think Mountain Dewboy is about to capture this.

113
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Yes, he is. Mountain Dewboy just want to...

114
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,300
How could one person be that good?

115
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
And he's a medic.

116
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,480
Like, why is no one shooting him?

117
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,480
Mountain Dewboy. That's your answer.

118
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:55,180
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. What the fuck?

119
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,180
I feel like that's not going in a video.

120
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:10,110
Watch out. We've got to... Never mind. He's dead.

121
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,110
He instantly exploded.

122
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,110
Because of the two centuries that...

123
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,110
What are these doing here?

124
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,740
There's two door centuries.

125
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,740
Have you ever seen a door century before? Like, work?

126
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
A door century? Oh my god.

127
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,740
There are door centuries here.

128
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Can they even reach the corner?

129
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,740
I don't know.

130
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,740
Well, they just killed somebody.

131
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,740
Look at them.

132
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,740
Why is this working?

133
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,740
There's laser beams coming right out.

134
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,740
Why is this strategy working? This should not be working.

135
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,750
And look, you can see through here, there's another heavy with the brass bees just revved up forever.

136
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,990
Oh, yeah.

137
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,990
Come on, move up that door century. We need that hallway century pointing down this hallway.

138
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,990
I know, we're creeping it. This is called the slow push.

139
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:07,560
I'm barely aiming too.

140
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,560
If I shoot in this hallway, something is going to die.

141
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
I think four heavies.

142
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,560
I think all 16 people are standing in this hall.

143
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,889
I know, no one's going the other way. Maybe we should do a rotate, do a flanking maneuver.

144
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:25,860
A rotate?

145
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,860
I'm feeling confident about the flanking maneuver.

146
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,860
Well, I got 72%.

147
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,589
This guy's trying to cheeseball this century.

148
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,620
Do these heavies like not...

149
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,620
Okay, let's go the other way, other way.

150
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,019
There are too many, there are so many people in that hall.

151
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:51,279
It's like disgusting how many people are in there.

152
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,279
Again, you'll have double uber again.

153
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,279
Use it.

154
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,279
God, I died right when you said it.

155
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,279
You're so good.

156
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,279
It just spammed down that hallway.

157
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,279
Sorry, I can only handle so many fucking grenades coming down a fucking hallway.

158
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,870
Jeremy's mad about two free backstabs.

159
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,870
Are you still alive?

160
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,870
I'm at the hallway where the endless fight is happening.

161
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,870
You're at the endless hallway, okay.

162
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,870
And I'm ubered, apparently.

163
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,870
So you're at the hallway in Mario 64 where you go up the stairs.

164
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,870
But the stairs never end.

165
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,870
I never played that game, top comment.

166
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,870
Star never, what?

167
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,870
Wow, Star never played Mario 64?

168
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,250
What a...

169
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,879
Yes, yes, yes.

170
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:50,409
We could really have like five ubers coming through here.

171
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:53,409
There's still the sentries, there's still the sentries to deal with.

172
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,779
How many other?

173
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,779
Maybe just two.

174
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,139
We have two or three medics in this hallway.

175
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,139
I think we might get it here.

176
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:04,139
Heavy to the right, heavy to the right.

177
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,789
Overheal me, overheal me.

178
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:10,159
Is the heavy dead?

179
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,159
I can get this right now.

180
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,159
I can't, there's so many people, they're just not, back up, back up.

181
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,159
This is just going to jump in, jump out, do that kind of thing.

182
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,159
But they're already building sentries.

183
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,159
Like there's three people trying to build a sentry again.

184
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,159
Does this guy have an uber or does he have crits?

185
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,159
Heavy is dead, he has uber, we're ready to go in.

186
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,159
Alright, I got crits. Let's do it.

187
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,159
You got crits and uber.

188
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,529
Make it happen.

189
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,409
Make it happen.

190
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,649
I'm getting the domination sound once a second.

191
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,649
You're still alive, how are you still?

192
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,649
I can't, there's...

193
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:49,240
Get that pyro.

194
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,539
Make that pyro wish he was never born.

195
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:57,539
I just killed him, I don't know if that's what we're looking for.

196
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:03,539
Well no, because now he's dead so he can't even know he was born because his brain is gone.

197
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:07,539
I wanted you to make him wish he was never born, not like make him kill him.

198
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,539
Okay, well we need to go up top.

199
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:17,059
You didn't follow my instructions.

200
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:20,940
Oh, that guy has an uber.

201
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go.

202
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,649
Is that what we're doing?

203
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:29,649
Is that what we're doing?

204
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:32,769
What?

205
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,100
Take it off me, take it off me.

206
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,809
What?

207
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:41,809
Insult to injury.

208
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,110
Oh, it's over here.

209
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,110
That's interesting.

210
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,110
No, kill it, kill it.

211
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,110
No, crit.

212
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,259
I think we got it, yeah the pyro has it.

213
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,259
That made no sense.

214
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:58,259
No, see it's a flawless strategy.

215
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,070
When you go down the drop down it works every time.

216
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,070
There was nothing down there.

217
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:10,740
How would that many people that were just in that room, was there nobody there, is what I want to know.

218
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,659
That's what I want to know.

219
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:18,659
We are done once we get this last cap.

220
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:23,960
And then once we get the last cap is when we do some celebration.

221
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:32,679
We can celebrate the victory.

222
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,860
Look, everybody jump.

223
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,860
We did it, we did it, we did it.

224
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,860
Oh shit, we didn't do it.

225
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,940
Oh yeah, we did.

226
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,940
I got it, don't worry.

227
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,179
We have to think about celebration first.

228
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:50,179
Celebration, what do we do?

229
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:53,179
Look how dusty I am.

230
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,179
Oh, look at how dusty he is.

231
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,179
You're so dusty.

232
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,179
No, you exploded.

233
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,490
Watch out.

234
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,629
We did it.

235
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:10,629
Congratulations, I can't do this anymore.

236
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,940
We stayed here way longer than we should have.

237
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,940
Yeah, we did.
