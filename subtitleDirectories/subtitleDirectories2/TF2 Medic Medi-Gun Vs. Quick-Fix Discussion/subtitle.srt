00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,710
Hey, what is happening everybody? Hope you're having a fantastic day so far. My name is

2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,510
Germa if you didn't already know that. We're gonna be playing some Team Fortress 2 gameplay

3
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,030
commentary. What a different intro. Usually I have the same intro the whole day. That

4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,500
was a weird intro. Anyways, gonna be playing as the medic tonight and we're gonna specifically

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,700
be talking about a couple of points, mainly the big debate between should I throw the

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,780
quick fix into the toilet and hit the flush button? And the answer to that question is

7
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,460
no, because the quick fix won't fit in the toilet. So if you try and flush it, it won't

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,369
go anywhere. And because it's actually worth something. A lot of people like to trash this

9
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:53,909
weapon or this item, whatever you want to call it. People like to really call this the

10
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:59,630
worst medigun. It's not even worth equipping, et cetera, et cetera. And I don't necessarily

11
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,189
agree with that. There's a ton of situations, and I'm gonna really detail one of them in

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:09,549
this video, where you really do need the quick fix. And it's a big deal. And a lot of people

13
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:14,500
really overlook this fact. And it's something you really have to take into consideration.

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,420
So when you're on a team of, let's say just Valve's default, Valve says 12 on 12 is what

15
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,420
we want Team Fortress to be. That's what it's gonna be. So 12 on 12, if there's one medic

16
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,579
on the team, even if there's one medic on the, let me rephrase that, if there is even

17
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:33,799
one person healing on the team, it's a lot to deal with. Especially when you're in a

18
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,439
game where there's a lot of damage going around. As you'll see in this gameplay, there's

19
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,480
a lot of people taking damage. A lot of people are getting killed. A lot of people are flying

20
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,400
back and forth. Especially, this is like a very small, dense map. King of the Hill maps

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,480
are the same way. This is Capture the Flag, by the way. I didn't even tell you the map.

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,120
Capture the Flag Turbine. And it's a very condensed map. So there's people all over

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,620
the place. And with the default medigun or the Kritzkrieg, you're talking about a slower

24
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,920
heal rate and you're talking about overheal. So you have to put the medigun on somebody

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,219
for a lot longer than you would with the quick fix. And let's just say for the sake of argument,

26
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:14,060
the one medic on that team, if he wasn't there, you wouldn't be getting any overheal anyways.

27
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,060
So the overheal argument is true. I totally agree with the fact that overheal is incredibly

28
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,780
necessary. It's a really big part of the game. But if there's a medic on the team healing

29
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:30,300
people, he's still doing work. He's still doing his job. It's not like he's sitting AFK in

30
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,659
the spawn or something like that. He's still healing. And it's really, really much easier

31
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:40,060
when you play with the quick fix if you are one person on a team to keep everybody healed.

32
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,419
It's very difficult. I can't tell you how many situations I've been in when I have not

33
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:48,740
been using the quick fix and we're turning a corner and there's five people that need

34
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,219
to be healed and I have the regular medigun and I'm just like, I'm sorry, three or four

35
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:58,569
you are going to die. There's nothing I can do about that. So what you're really watching

36
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,050
on the screen right now is you're watching me play with the quick fix and then you're

37
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,009
watching me play with the default medigun and they're both in very, very similar situations

38
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:10,930
and I'm going to freeze it here coming up in a second. I'm going to show you that exact

39
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,490
situation I'm talking about where you get into trouble with the regular medigun and

40
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,650
you get yourself killed. Okay, so let's transition to the regular medigun here and take a look.

41
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,729
I'm going to freeze it. There are one, two, three, four, four people here that need to

42
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:27,930
be healed, all of them which are on fire or at least the two that can be on fire and

43
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,810
I can't heal them. I can try and put it on them for a second but they're still taking

44
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,210
so much damage and if I had had the quick fix, say, take a look at this pyro, I probably

45
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,129
could have filled him up by now but no, a pyro comes from behind us, gets me lit on

46
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:45,250
fire and this scout I pull out the needle gun probably should have switched to the medigun.

47
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,270
I thought I had the blutsauger for a second but I did not. But as you can see, this situation

48
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:55,300
turns out very, very badly and I run for the hell that I do not make it. So that's

49
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,439
exactly what I'm talking about. Those group situations where you need to really spread

50
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:04,219
the heals around when a ton of people are taking damage and there's really nothing

51
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:10,300
you can do about it. That's where the quick fix is definitely a huge plus and a huge definitely

52
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,199
one up on the other two mediguns. Now, there's a century around this corner and I'm going

53
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,209
to show you a reason why you need to switch sometimes. There is nothing that is more power

54
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:27,009
full than an ubered class. So obviously, you can't really take out a big sentry nest with

55
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:31,129
the quick fix. Sometimes you can. Sometimes there's a few situations where you can uber

56
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:36,540
a heavy or quick fix a heavy and you can get the job done with the quick fix. But with

57
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,939
any other situation, you really do need an uber to push into a room like this and that's

58
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:44,980
what I suggest. Once you get to the point where you go, okay, there's a sentry in that

59
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,920
room, we have to do something about it. That's when you take out the regular medigun, leave

60
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:55,560
the critskrieg in its closet for now because as we all know, crits do no extra damage to

61
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,240
buildings. So if you get critskrieg, if you're a soldier, you're still going to do normal

62
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,089
soldier rocket damage to those buildings. But the quick fix is for, let me try and put

63
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:09,240
this this way. If you are one medic on a team, like I said, the quick fix is the medigun

64
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,560
to use when you're having trouble, when you're trying to keep people alive, they won't stay

65
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,759
alive. The quick fix is the medigun to use in those situations. It's very situational,

66
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,920
yes, but it's not bad. It is not terrible and if there's a medic on your team using

67
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,639
it, try not to bash him and tell him, hey, twitch to a better medigun because really

68
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,810
he might be just trying to solve that situational problem. So just have fun with whatever item

69
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,769
you want to play with, whether that be medic or whether that be pyro, demo man, anything.

70
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:42,649
There really is no perfect loadout. That's why they add so many of these items into the

71
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:49,279
game. So just have fun, I guess is my real point of this whole spiel. Spiel, I love that

72
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,300
word. So anyways, guys, this is going to be the end of the video. Thank you so much for

73
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,560
watching. I really do appreciate it and I'll see you guys all soon. So take care, everybody.
