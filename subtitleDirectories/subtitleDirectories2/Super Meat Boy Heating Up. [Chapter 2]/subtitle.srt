1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,259
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with chapter 2 of Sea of Her Meat Boy.

2
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:17,260
Gonna tackle the hospital.

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:23,260
Now welcome back if you just watched the first episode where I took on chapter 1, which proceeds chapter 2.

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,500
So here we go, the hospital.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,500
A place that I don't like to go, cause that means you're hurt, or have some type of injury or illness.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,649
Alright, where's my boy Commander Video? There he is.

7
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:39,149
All his glorious rainbows intact.

8
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,030
So I hope you're having a fantastic day.

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,030
I know Commander Video is cause he's gonna speedrun this whole level.

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,229
Woo!

11
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:51,229
Let's get A pluses on every level.

12
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:53,850
I forget these levels.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,030
It's been a while.

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,030
Not long enough where I can't absolutely ace them though.

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,159
And that's how you do it right there folks.

16
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,400
No A plus, but that's okay.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,159
Oh, I was also told to turn the music up a little bit, so I did.

18
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,159
Turn it up if you can hear it.

19
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,159
This is gonna be tough.

20
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,969
You might need Meat Boy for this one.

21
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:20,450
Maybe not.

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,450
Ooh, that's slick. Ooh, that is slick.

23
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,599
Slick. No, no!

24
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,599
I gotta stop trying to be like a slick Rick.

25
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,599
Just play the damn game.

26
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,750
Here we are.

27
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,180
It's all about moving fast. Just forget about everything, just go.

28
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,180
Here we are.

29
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,060
A plus.

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,840
And this is one of the things where you fly in the air.

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,230
Let's do it again.

32
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,170
Oh, I didn't hold down jump.

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,859
So that's the thing with Commander Video.

34
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,099
You gotta make sure.

35
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:05,099
In situations like this, you don't hold down jump for too long.

36
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:07,099
Stuff like that will happen.

37
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,879
Let's take this slow right now.

38
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,650
Ah!

39
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,650
This might be...I don't know if I can do this with Commander Video.

40
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,349
Don't!

41
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,349
But I wanna stay with Commander Video. I love him.

42
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,969
No, you know what? I can get this.

43
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:27,400
Ready? Here we go.

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,539
One, two, three.

45
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:32,539
Oh, you bastard! Last try, come on.

46
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:36,810
Ugh!

47
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,810
I'm gonna have to switch.

48
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,310
Sorry, Commander Video. I wanted to do the whole thing with you.

49
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,310
Do I give up that easily? I don't.

50
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,069
So let's try it again.

51
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,319
Let's try it again.

52
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,750
Alright, meat boy.

53
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,009
Didn't want to have to resort to using you, but I have to.

54
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,210
God, I'm so not used to him.

55
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,219
Let's clean this up.

56
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,229
Come on, just do it.

57
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:08,490
Oh, god!

58
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,240
Okay.

59
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,000
Alright, we're good.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,620
That almost just not gonna work.

61
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,620
I'm gonna have to do this again with Super Meat Boy.

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,650
Because he moves faster.

63
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,650
I'm gonna have to...I don't know about this one.

64
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,960
Oh, Band-Aid.

65
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,650
Give me that Band-Aid!

66
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,719
I said...

67
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,719
Oh, here come the swears.

68
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:40,120
Forget the Band-Aid, let's go.

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,879
Alright, come on.

70
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,930
Oh, that's how you skip that whole part.

71
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,930
Alright, now I can probably switch to Commander Video and be okay with it.

72
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,879
The question is, do I want to skip this?

73
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,310
What's going on here?

74
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,310
Why am I losing this?

75
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,150
I didn't even jump and I made it over that.

76
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,560
Get out of my face!

77
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,159
Alright, going back to Commander Video.

78
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,159
Because he's my baby.

79
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,909
Oh, this might not even work.

80
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:17,519
I run into Fan over and over again.

81
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,519
I can't do this.

82
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,009
Oh, god.

83
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:25,470
Never mind.

84
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:33,069
Let's go.

85
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,069
Be careful here.

86
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:39,610
Oh, yeah.

87
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,240
Oh, man.

88
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
See, I gotta start paying attention.

89
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,040
I'm being like a real stupid bastard.

90
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Land that, land this, and jump up.

91
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
There we go.

92
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Just stay with me, boy. I'm having no luck here.

93
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,790
Ah!

94
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,350
Boop, boop.

95
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,910
I want to go back up that way.

96
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,910
No, I don't.

97
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,910
If I had Commander Video right here, I could float across this stupid thing.

98
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,470
Come on, you slug.

99
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,470
You know, I always say slug, but these really are slugs.

100
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,540
Didn't even realize that.

101
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,540
Oh, look, it's a slug, slug, slug.

102
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,540
Go, yes.

103
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,930
Just go.

104
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,930
You know, we're gonna do that again, but this time I'm just gonna go right off the bat.

105
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,069
Speed it up a little bit here, come on.

106
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,870
Speed it up.

107
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,870
That's what I like to see.

108
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,560
I can't go that fast, no.

109
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,050
No, I can.

110
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,680
God.

111
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,319
Oh, dear God.

112
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:55,000
Come on, no.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You gotta succeed on the first couple tries.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's when you gotta really start to think about what you're doing.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,629
Which is what I'm doing right now.

116
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,800
I forgot about this part.

117
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,360
You gotta jump up here.

118
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,990
Through there.

119
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,160
Over the slugs.

120
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,160
And that's the one. There she is.

121
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,750
She's the one for me.

122
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,439
Get out of the way, you giant slug.

123
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,029
Yeah.

124
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:29,720
Johnny's cage.

125
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,279
Give me the bandaid. How am I supposed to...

126
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:36,060
Oh, wow. Okay.

127
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,060
You know, this has got your name written all over it.

128
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,560
If I didn't...

129
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,629
Just hang out right here.

130
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, crap.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,879
There we go. Got the bandaid.

132
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,399
Commander video, to the rescue.

133
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,399
Take the key, drop down, nice and easy.

134
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,089
And that's how you get a Thanksgiving turkey.

135
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:02,569
Oh, I'm too slow for this with commander video.

136
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,769
You can still try.

137
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:07,769
I can do it. I can do it.

138
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:10,009
Who am I kidding? I can do this.

139
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,920
Like that, and then you jump.

140
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,720
Float!

141
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
People want to see the deaths.

142
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
If I die a ton of times in a level, I will show the deaths.

143
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,480
Oh!

144
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go. Faster.

145
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,399
Go!

146
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,639
Oh, I didn't get the key.

147
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,639
I tried to get that key, that was fine.

148
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,850
I didn't get it. Dammit.

149
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,610
Get out of the way.

150
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,610
A+.

151
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,540
Oh, what just happened?

152
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,540
Okay.

153
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,060
I'll accept it, I guess.

154
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,449
Up with this one.

155
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,449
And then float, and then yeah.

156
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:09,100
Get the key.

157
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
Get the second key. Oh, you know what?

158
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,040
Screw the second. I'm in a lot of trouble here.

159
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,329
I'm gonna have to try and make my way over this.

160
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:20,329
Commander video.

161
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:24,490
Supposed to be my go-to guy. Let's try this again.

162
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,990
Up, slow, and then up.

163
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,699
Okay.

164
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:33,200
Don't screw this up. Straight in the air.

165
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,889
Get this guy out of the way. There it is.

166
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,889
And my queen.

167
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:40,889
I've come to you. Let's see some of those deaths.

168
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,889
I died like seven great times.

169
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,889
Or four.

170
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:46,889
Yeah, one, two, three, four.

171
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:48,889
There goes one, there goes the other, and it's down to these two.

172
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:50,889
Who's gonna win? Who's gonna pull ahead?

173
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,889
It's gonna be Sally, it's gonna be Jeffrey.

174
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,409
No, it's not gonna be either of them, because I'm skipping it.

175
00:08:56,409 --> 00:09:01,789
And let's go.

176
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,690
Warp Zone. Warp Zone, give me.

177
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:13,000
Give me the Warp Zone. I forget which one this is.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,440
Super Meat Boy.

179
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,240
This one.

180
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,539
Probably not gonna do this, I'm not gonna lie.

181
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,610
Actually, maybe I will.

182
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,779
Maybe not. Went too fast.

183
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:30,779
Up. Now take your time with this.

184
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,750
Don't have to freak out here.

185
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,399
Unlock her cage.

186
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,399
Go visit her family for Thanksgiving dinner.

187
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,110
Like you promised. Like that.

188
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,820
Oh, oh, oh fuck!

189
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,700
You know, I had that. You all know I had that.

190
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,220
I'm gonna do it again.

191
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,399
You know, okay, I can't screw this up.

192
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,399
I cannot mess this up.

193
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,889
If you're gonna go fast, you gotta slow down up here.

194
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:11,639
Like that.

195
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,080
I almost just jumped over the damn thing.

196
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,039
And I would've freaked out.

197
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,909
Simple enough. Simple enough.

198
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:27,389
Simple enough. Oh my god!

199
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:30,190
Sorry, Meat Boy.

200
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,190
But the green stick figure told you

201
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,190
that she's in another castle, which means she's there.

202
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:40,759
Floaty. Floaty McFloat.

203
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:47,019
Get out of... Thank you.

204
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,019
Thank you very much.

205
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,230
Whoa. Commander video.

206
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,230
Ugh. I'm trying to like sing to this beat.

207
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,230
Hold on, I'll do it.

208
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:03,789
Oh, come on. I gotta think some lyrics.

209
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,539
Commander video

210
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,539
is the best character in the game.

211
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,539
He's gonna beat the whole thing.

212
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,539
Then he's gonna have some cake.

213
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,539
Commander video

214
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,539
just land on her head. Please don't squash her.

215
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:20,539
She's the one you're looking for

216
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:23,230
in another castle.

217
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,519
Oh, I didn't even mean to jump over that.

218
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,519
I love the noise he makes when he lands on things.

219
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
Bunk. Bunk. Bunk. Bunk. Bunk. Bunk. Bunk.

220
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,279
Hey, yo. Blee.

221
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,279
Coolest part about him is I will definitely make this

222
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,970
because I can just do this. Ha ha ha.

223
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,490
Almost didn't make that. Getting close here.

224
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,730
Getting close. Oh boy.

225
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,320
Might need Meat Boy for this.

226
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,399
No! Go.

227
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,399
No, just hide in the stupid thing.

228
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,850
Oh my god. I am so dumb.

229
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,269
Oh my god.

230
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:06,269
What is the matter with me?

231
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,639
Oh my god.

232
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,029
I'm losing my mind.

233
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:16,460
I'm starting to lose my mind.

234
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,340
No.

235
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,340
Oh my god. It's begun.

236
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,090
The freak out period is about to begin.

237
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,330
Okay.

238
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,330
I have to slow down here. Meat Boy.

239
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:34,009
Let's go.

240
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:39,710
No. I'm not going yet.

241
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,159
That's what I should have done in the very beginning.

242
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,519
There we go. Finally.

243
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,120
Don't die here. You'll never make it back.

244
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,240
I'm going to stick with Meat Boy for this one.

245
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Oh, that is so loud in my head right now.

246
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,149
It hurts.

247
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,759
I'll be waiting.

248
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:16,000
Six feet.

249
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,899
Whoa.

250
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,679
Get out of my way. I'll take that key.

251
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,919
Open the door of

252
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,090
victory.

253
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,000
No. I'm not.

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Just wait. Just wait.

255
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,889
Slow this down and I got this in the bag.

256
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:44,990
No.

257
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,440
Just wait.

258
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,879
I don't have to be too speedy.

259
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,879
It's all about just getting there.

260
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,500
And we got it.

261
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,279
Day breakup.

262
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:04,559
Jump.

263
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,590
That was close.

264
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,220
Was I going to just get out

265
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:20,600
of the way?

266
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
And this is a...

267
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,159
You know, I'm going to go down here.

268
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,159
Drop down. Jump up.

269
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,919
God. I'm so mad at that.

270
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,919
I can't believe I messed that up.

271
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,559
It was just...

272
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,340
Oh, my God.

273
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,340
This is the last level before the boss.

274
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,580
I know that. At least I think it is.

275
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,580
Maybe I'm wrong. I've been wrong before.

276
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,929
Get out of the way.

277
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:56,539
Jump up.

278
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:58,539
Around and down.

279
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:03,070
Now we got it.

280
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,759
No, not so fast.

281
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,809
No, no, no.

282
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,759
It's all right. We're good.

283
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,320
Oh, my God.

284
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,350
I got to stop doing that.

285
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,350
Okay, just jump.

286
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,350
Well, you just do it the way you're supposed to.

287
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,360
No, like, stupid tricks.

288
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,169
Let's see. Look at all these fools.

289
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:31,820
Oh, it's down to the two.

290
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
It's down to these two. Who's going to make it?

291
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,000
I go? I fall down?

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,559
Oh, don't worry. I'll come back.

293
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,559
Look, I'm right here with you again.

294
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,860
Oh, I'm so glad. Yes, we're friends forever.

295
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,860
We're both going to share the girl. We both love her forever.

296
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,230
Oh, that's so nice of you.

297
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,230
Oh, thank you.

298
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,230
Oh, and there he's gone. Oh, he's not.

299
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,230
When did I die with that guy?

300
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,429
Oh, right there.

301
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:59,799
And he makes it.

302
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,240
Time to close up chapter two.

303
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
Going against Chad.

304
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Chad, if those of you do not know,

305
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
Chad is actually

306
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
in, well, he's actually the name of another

307
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
boss in Binding of Isaac.

308
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,600
Not, I guess, yeah, he is.

309
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,740
Press that button, I dare you.

310
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,740
I think it's a different look, though.

311
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
I totally forget if it's the same Chad.

312
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,970
I think it is.

313
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,970
Here he comes.

314
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,759
Yeah, he's in Binding of Isaac.

315
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,759
And the whole point of this is you're supposed to

316
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:41,129
outrun him and die

317
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:44,009
from the very beginning.

318
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:46,009
I can't even, like, talk. I'm just so, this music

319
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,009
in my ear is just making me so scared.

320
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:51,789
Alright, let's just wait for him.

321
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:53,789
Wait for him, wait for him. Okay, now I'll go.

322
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:55,789
Can I get out of, like, the first part of the boss, please?

323
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:58,860
Don't want him to hit me.

324
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,860
So just stay above everything.

325
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,059
That's electric, that's electricity.

326
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,059
Where's the, oh, the key's down there?

327
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,059
I forgot about this. Oh, it's over.

328
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,299
I can't even get over there.

329
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:13,240
Just kill me.

330
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Alright, so it's on the right, it's on the right.

331
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,079
Both at times, it's on the right. I got you.

332
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,839
Let's move. Can't even go over there.

333
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,609
I just tried to jump over there, my god!

334
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,609
Alright, Chad, got about enough of this.

335
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:32,670
Oh my god!

336
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,190
Why am I so bad?

337
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,990
Okay, let's do it.

338
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,210
I, what?

339
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,349
What? How am I, how

340
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:50,349
How do I get up there?

341
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:52,349
I forget, like, what you do in this, in this part.

342
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:57,339
Um, hold on.

343
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:59,339
No, there's a way to drop down right here. I'm an idiot.

344
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:02,599
How do you do it?

345
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,380
Don't worry, I got it.

346
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,539
Don't worry, guys, I got this.

347
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:14,119
I got this taken care of, don't worry.

348
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:16,119
Super Meat Boy's in the house.

349
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:18,119
He's got this taken care of out of control here.

350
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,119
Oh my

351
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,119
god!

352
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,119
I'm starting to really get annoyed.

353
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,049
Let's see, I wonder how many die at times I'm gonna die.

354
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,049
I'm gonna guess, like, 30.

355
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,049
Because after this, there's some more stuff to do.

356
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:35,359
It's all about just dodging.

357
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,359
No!

358
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,880
I'm gonna land on him!

359
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
No!

360
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,079
Yeah, go ahead, do your dumb thing.

361
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,980
Oh my god!

362
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,980
He keeps, I hate when he

363
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,279
Just do your

364
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:56,279
stupid thing, you big, fat,

365
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:58,279
ugly bastard. Get out of my way.

366
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,680
I'm gonna punch you in the, I can't even go up now.

367
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Oh, you

368
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,680
You ripe, red tomato.

369
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,160
Okay.

370
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
This time, I'm not gonna just

371
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
jump down there, because he's gonna be there.

372
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
See? Told you. And I didn't even get the key.

373
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Good thing I didn't, because there he is.

374
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Oh!

375
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,869
I wish I could use command video,

376
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:29,119
but I can't!

377
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,119
Okay, if I don't do this this time,

378
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,119
I'm gonna put a hole through my

379
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,470
computer monitor. Take it easy.

380
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,349
Oh my

381
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,349
god! Oh my

382
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,349
god, I can't believe I did that.

383
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,349
I cannot believe, I'm

384
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:48,349
not even like halfway through this.

385
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:51,289
Son of a

386
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,289
See, once you start getting mad, that's when

387
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:55,289
things start to go downhill.

388
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:57,289
Collected, gotta get collected here.

389
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:00,619
You know, the screen is shaking too, that's why

390
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:03,500
it causes more problems.

391
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Get me! Get me! Get the

392
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,529
Ugh!

393
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:13,180
Oh my

394
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,059
god. I wonder how many

395
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:18,059
times I've said oh my god, or oh my word.

396
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:26,359
Here we go again.

397
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,359
Alright, I'm in an okay spot

398
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:34,119
right here. Alright, we're done. We're done.

399
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,119
I just gotta get this key. If I, just get the

400
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:38,119
damn key, and just get it!

401
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,730
Just get the key! No!

402
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,740
Get out of my face! Get the key.

403
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,619
Get the other key. Don't even

404
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,619
worry about it. Just, just, it's okay.

405
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,619
It's okay. Get the

406
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:52,619
Oh my god, I did it! Oh!

407
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:56,119
Oh my god.

408
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,430
Whew!

409
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,180
That was the ragiest I've

410
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,180
been so far, and it's only gonna get worse.

411
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,609
So thank you guys so much for watching.

412
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,609
Chapter two. Chapter three

413
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:09,609
will be next coming Monday.

414
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:11,849
Every Monday is Super Meat Boy Monday!

415
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:14,349
Meat Boy Mondays! He still has my

416
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:17,480
girlfriend though. What's that?

417
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,279
Oh, it's little Chad! Hi!

418
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,890
Uh, hold on, let me look over

419
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,890
here for a second. We're going to go off!

420
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,890
No, I gotta, what are you doing, man?

421
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,200
I just, I wanna give you a kiss.

422
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,559
Uh, okay. Can you just like

423
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,559
back up for a second? Get out of here.

424
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,559
Oh, you killed me!

425
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,559
Dude, I'm wicked sorry.

426
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,559
Are you alright? No, I'm not alright.

427
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:43,069
Oh my god.

428
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:45,950
Whatever. Where is he?

429
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,380
Still over there? Oh, you threw my girlfriend!

430
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,619
Off with me! I'll get

431
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:54,380
that bastard! Let's go!

432
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,390
Chad? I still want that kiss,

433
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,390
please!

434
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,559
Okay, time to get out of here. This is

435
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,559
getting a little weird. I'm gonna have to just

436
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,559
put him out of his misery, and I just

437
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,559
why did I do that?

438
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,930
I just, like, voice acted that whole thing

439
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,930
as if it was actually, whatever.

440
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,680
So yeah, take care everybody. Thanks for

441
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
watching, I'll see you all on Chapter 3.

442
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,680
See you later, guys.
