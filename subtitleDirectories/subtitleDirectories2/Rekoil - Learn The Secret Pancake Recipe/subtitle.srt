1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:11,820
Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with Recoil.

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
I just was spectating. I was trying to spectate a guy that knew what he was doing.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
Looks like Artman's gonna go in. We're gonna see here.

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,820
Going for the double shotgun shot. Gets the shot. Gets two shots on him.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
Right there we got Artman gonna be going in for the kill.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
They're gonna see on the top left staircase. Gets the pistol out.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,820
Is he gonna get in on time?

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
He's dancing. I'm not going with the night kills.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
Is he gonna get in?

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:37,509
This is so unexpected.

11
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:40,509
So I guess now is a good time to do a player profile on Chizzy Boy.

12
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:43,509
I guess now it's time to do a player profile on Clidio.

13
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:46,509
Clidio is one of those players you just love to watch, guys.

14
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:47,509
He has a lot of things in his arsenal.

15
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:50,509
He's one of the best AK-74 players in the world.

16
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:55,509
And he also plays the piano, so a good little bit of information on the player that I like to see it.

17
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:58,509
Now I'm gonna do a player profile on V2FXXX.

18
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:01,509
He is one of the best SMG players in the world.

19
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:07,510
As you can probably imagine, having an SMG is a lot better for movement and to be able to get the speed that you need.

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,510
Now we're gonna do a player profile on Cat.

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,510
Now we're gonna do a player profile on Chizzy Boy.

22
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,510
Chizzy Boy is another one of those characters you love to see.

23
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,510
Now we're gonna do a player profile on Zeyosio.

24
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,120
Just like that, we get a two-piece.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,819
Just like...

26
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:30,150
Oh, yeah. Stop him. Stop him.

27
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,579
Me and my teammates.

28
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,579
Me and my teammates recoiling all over the place.

29
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:37,780
Look at that.

30
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,780
I'll teach you how to recoil, guys.

31
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,780
What you want to do first, you want to turn a corner with a fucking grenade in your hand.

32
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,090
And you just want to throw it into their spawn.

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,090
I don't even know if that's their spawn.

34
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,390
I got a couple hits.

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,700
Tango down.

36
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Charlie down.

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,129
And...

38
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:54,010
Guy in the window.

39
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,810
Down.

40
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,430
I gotta get...

41
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,430
I gotta string something.

42
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,250
What the hell is that guy?

43
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,250
What the hell?

44
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,769
This guy got like face paint on?

45
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:07,769
I want to like see his broken ass neck.

46
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,770
Yeah, he's got like face paint on.

47
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,770
This guy looks like a WWF wrestler.

48
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,900
I want to be like a WCWNWO wrestler.

49
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,129
There it is.

50
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:21,129
Killing machine.

51
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,069
Oh!

52
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,069
That's two!

53
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:25,069
That...

54
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:27,250
Fucking WCW guy killed me.

55
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:34,349
The fuck happened to you?

56
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:39,469
I definitely want to be a WCW guy.

57
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,469
We got this WCW guy.

58
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,900
This guy is just kind of crazy looking.

59
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,900
He's kind of creepy.

60
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,900
And then we got tattoo guy.

61
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,340
Why is tattoo guy the guy with the face paint?

62
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
And then this should be tattoo guy.

63
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,009
Something I've noticed in every video game that has this gun.

64
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:01,819
The Draugnov always sucks.

65
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:08,409
Has there ever been a game made where the Draugnov like wasn't a fucking piece of shit?

66
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:11,610
Has that ever happened?

67
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,610
I just got three kills in a row.

68
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,610
So let's just pretend like I didn't say that.

69
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,650
Ooh.

70
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,400
Ooh.

71
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,090
Ooh.

72
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,500
Somebody's...

73
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Somebody learned how to play.

74
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:39,180
It be a part of war.

75
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,919
I'm going to teach you guys how to make pancakes.

76
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,919
All right?

77
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,919
It's going to be pretty easy.

78
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,099
There's the first ingredient.

79
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,099
That's two eggs.

80
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,590
Around this corner we got some butter.

81
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,960
And then of course you cannot forget.

82
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Fucking God.

83
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,580
This is the secret recipe for pancakes.

84
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,580
Two eggs.

85
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,039
Then you got to also put in the butter.

86
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:04,539
But I can't find the butter.

87
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:05,539
The butter ran down here.

88
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:06,780
There's the butter.

89
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,020
I missed the bowl with the butter.

90
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,020
Fucking God damn it.

91
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,259
Hey, what's going on everybody?

92
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,259
Jerma here.

93
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:14,259
Welcome to Cooking with Jerma.

94
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,259
This is a new series I'm doing.

95
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,259
Where I show you how to make a very healthy, very nice breakfast.

96
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,430
And what you want is you want a bowl.

97
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,430
Bowl large enough to put a bunch of stuff in obviously.

98
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,430
Because we're going to give you my secret recipe for pancakes.

99
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,800
So what you want to do is of course you want to put in, you know, what we got here.

100
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Two eggs.

101
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,230
A little bit of butter.

102
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,230
The butter ran away.

103
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,230
Hold on.

104
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,730
The butter fell on the floor.

105
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,730
I got to pick up the butter.

106
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,730
There's the butter.

107
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,480
There's the butter.

108
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Butter's in the bowl now.

109
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Then of course you got to add the flour.

110
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
Flour is shooting at me.

111
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,779
Flour's shooting at me.

112
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:49,779
It's okay.

113
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:50,779
It's okay.

114
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:53,430
Flour killed me.

115
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,379
Welcome to Cooking with Jerma guys.

116
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,379
In this episode I'm going to teach you how to make pancakes.

117
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:02,379
Those of you that think you know how to make pancakes.

118
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:03,379
You got it all wrong.

119
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,379
You see, first you got to get a bowl.

120
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:09,180
Then once you get that bowl you throw in two eggs.

121
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,350
Once the eggs are in there you put in the flour.

122
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,660
Once the flour's in there you roll your sleeves up.

123
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,660
Get your hands a little bit dirty.

124
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,660
And you add a little bit more butter.

125
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,660
Fucking god damn it.

126
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,339
Do you understand how hard you're trying to make one of the worst jokes I have ever heard?

127
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,250
I'm getting behind them.

128
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,420
I'm getting in their spawn.

129
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:37,389
And it's going to be a big fucking surprise when I get in there.

130
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:44,009
Speaking of big surprise.

131
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,009
What is this?

132
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:49,009
What is this fucking Gumby?

133
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:50,759
What is this?

134
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,759
What is that like fucking?

135
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:58,220
Stretch Armstrong in like a fucking taffy factory.

136
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,220
And we're coming out of the wire here guys.

137
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,220
This is the final moment in the 2016 Recoil Tournament.

138
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,220
Welcome. I'm very glad to do it with you.

139
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,220
We're very glad to cast you.

140
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,220
Very glad to do it.
