00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,779
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 Gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:22,210
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Cow Mangler Soldier. And I gotta apologize right off the

3
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,410
bat because I did say a long time ago I was gonna get this gameplay, and it never happened.

4
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,369
And I've done I think every single rocket launcher besides the Cow Mangler. And I am

5
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,969
sorry about this. But here it is, it's finally here. We have it, it's done, it's ready,

6
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:42,880
it's ready to watch, it's right here in front of us. So anyways, what do I think about the

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,619
Cow Mangler? I do have very, very conflicting opinions on this thing. And there are some

8
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:53,679
pros and of course there are cons to go along with it. And the biggest pro out of anything

9
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,600
with this weapon is obviously the fact that you can turn off buildings. If you don't know,

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,880
right clicking with this weapon allows you to do like a super charge like Super Saiyan

11
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,840
Kamehameha. And you take out a sentry gun or dispenser or a teleporter. Makes it totally

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,040
disabled, it cannot function, cannot do anything for four seconds. Now that's amazing. Especially

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,760
if you're playing with a group of people and you all happen to be on Skype or Mumble or

14
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,159
any of those voice chat programs. Because if you can call out when you're doing it,

15
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,239
and you say over the microphone, you say something like, hey, I'm gonna take that sentry down,

16
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:36,079
I'm about to do the right click, go after it, you have no fear of being shot at. It's

17
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,239
just fantastic. The person can turn the corner. Let's say it's a demo man or a heavy. That

18
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,700
sentry goes down in two seconds. So it is a very good item if you are in direct communication

19
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,719
with your teammates. Other than that though, the cons and the biggest con in my opinion

20
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,799
is the slower reload time. I cannot get over it. If you're like me, if you're an impatient

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,920
like me, it is very hard to get over the fact that it takes another like quarter second,

22
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,400
like point two or three seconds to get that other rocket into the chamber. It's actually

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,960
another reason why it's taken me so long to get this gameplay. It's cause I just, I get

24
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,800
in one-on-one fights with somebody. I burn through all my rockets and then it's like

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,919
ch-chunk, ch-chunk. And by the time I get one or two back, I'm just instantly dead.

26
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,039
But if you can handle that, if you can handle the little bit lower damage and you can handle

27
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:31,979
the reload time, it is definitely a rocket launcher you should look into. And you could

28
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,900
say that this weapon does not need ammo, but to be totally honest with you guys, I don't

29
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,379
think that's an issue anyways. Cause how many times have you had zero rockets in your rocket

30
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:45,620
launcher? Cause running over any weapon or picking up ammo, it's really not that difficult

31
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,830
to stay above like eight or nine rockets in the chamber. So I don't see that as a big

32
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:58,340
issue. So now while the second gameplay plays in the gameplay plays, that's a great word.

33
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,900
So while the second gameplay is in the background, there's two gameplays, both of them on King

34
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,240
of the Hill Harvest. I want to talk about something insane that I'm going to do. And

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,639
I've been alluding to this a little bit. I did, I talked about it in my live stream last

36
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,180
week, but live stream, here we go. Here, here comes the announcement. I have no idea how

37
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,099
I'm going to explain this. I'm going to try as best as I can to explain this thing I'm

38
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:27,030
doing. But anyways, this weekend, this coming Saturday, I am going to be doing a live stream

39
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,729
and it's going to be like unlike anything you have ever seen ever in your entire life

40
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:37,870
for any team Fortress 2, anything. What I plan on doing guys, I plan on doing a game

41
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,560
show. Now what does that even mean? Like a game, what do you mean game show? What I want

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,719
to do is I want to set up sort of like if you've, if you've ever seen deal or no deal,

43
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:53,949
that's really the only small piece of explanation I can give. Here's what I'm going to do. So

44
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:59,129
this weekend, I'm going to have 50 pieces of gift wrap. I'm going to have an entire

45
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:05,889
piece of my backpack, 50 slots as gift wrap. And what we're going to do is get everybody

46
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:11,610
into the live stream, do a trivia night and have that be up on the screen the whole time.

47
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,849
So all you're going to see is you're going to see 50 gift wrapped items, which could

48
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:20,449
be anything. And I mean literally anything. I've been working with this for so long, trying

49
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:25,129
to get items. There will be unusual hats, there will be strangers, there will be regular

50
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:29,670
hats, there will be strange parts. I am going to go all out with this. And what's going

51
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:36,089
to happen is I'm going to ask a trivia question into the stream. And the first person to answer

52
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:41,800
that question correctly is going to get a chance to pick one of the random gift wrapped

53
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:47,139
items. And whatever they open, they get to keep it. Now, if that happens to be an unusual

54
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:54,139
hat or a normal flare gun, that is theirs to keep forever. And that is what I'm doing

55
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:59,110
this weekend. Everything is going to be live. Everything's going to be uncut. It's going

56
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,089
to be just crazy. And I'm really hoping to get a really big turnout there. And to be

57
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:09,170
honest, the only thing you'd be missing out on is free, cool, crazy game show items. So

58
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:16,649
this weekend, Saturday, May 5th is going to be the huge game show live stream. It's all

59
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:22,930
going to be taking place on Twitch, twitch.tv slash jerma985. I want to do it on Twitch

60
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:29,050
because I don't want ads. I don't have a partnership. I want it to be totally uncut where everyone

61
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:36,050
can see everything. So come on over to Twitch this Saturday, 6pm Eastern time. Tell all

62
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,959
your friends, tell all your family members. But no, it's going to happen this weekend,

63
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,720
guys. I hope we have a lot of fun. And those of you saying, oh, Jeremy, don't, you don't

64
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,839
have to do this. You don't have to give away unusuals. That's not what this is about. It's

65
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,920
just about having fun as a community because that is what this is. So if you're concerned

66
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,279
about me losing more items, do not worry about it at all, guys. You guys know that it's not

67
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,300
a big deal to me. We can take care of this. I have a lot of friends, a lot of people helping

68
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:07,779
me with this as well. So do not worry. Just come, enjoy yourselves. We're going to have

69
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:14,779
a great time. So come on down this weekend, Saturday, May 5th to the Jerma Game Show extraordinaire.

70
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,519
Nice game show voice. But yeah, this is how I'm going to wrap the video up, guys. So thank

71
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,339
you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys all next time. So

72
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,899
take care, everybody.
