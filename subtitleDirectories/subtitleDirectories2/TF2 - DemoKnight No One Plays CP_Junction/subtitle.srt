00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:14,339
Hey, what is going on guys? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:19,379
This time we're on CP Junction, a map that not one person plays and oh my god a pyro!

3
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:25,109
He's dead. I got him. Don't worry. So anyways, this is on Junction with the demo night setup

4
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,469
using the Persian Persuader, the Splendid Screen, and the Alibaba's Wii booties.

5
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:34,149
I love saying that, by the way. That's my favorite item in the game to say.

6
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:41,000
Anyways, if you are unfamiliar with this particular game type, A and B are open to capture.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,560
Red Team has to stop us from capturing these points. The only way for us to win the game is

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,079
if we capture A and B. That's the only time that C is going to open. So watch right here,

9
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,520
B is going to get captured and I'm going to club this guy in his mouth. So we cut B, A is now open.

10
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,079
Notice how C is still locked. You have to capture A and B before C even opens. Junction is also a

11
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,680
very close quarters map. All the action happens pretty much in these connecting hallways. It's

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,760
pretty chaotic. It can get really ridiculous, especially when more than five or six people

13
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,069
on each team are fighting in these hallways. Regardless of all of this, though, this is still

14
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:23,750
a very, very fun map. One that I highly recommend that you try at least once, maybe twice if you

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,140
have the wherewithal. But unfortunately, you're not going to find it in any server browser or any

16
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,939
popular server because nobody really plays this map on a rotation. So try and find it, though.

17
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,640
It's fun. Anyways, watch what happens here. I turn around, this scout is trying to kill me.

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,480
I'm doing some dodging and weaving and so is he, so it's very, very difficult, especially playing

19
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,920
Demo Knight. Second scout comes behind me, get out of my way, buddy. I get shot right in the face.

20
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,719
But that's what you want to do as a Demo Knight. Don't run yourself into trouble. If you noticed,

21
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,599
I was going into that room, trying to get a little bit of shielding there from the walls in the room,

22
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,760
coming out, trying to go to the side that he's not on, waiting for my charge and recharge.

23
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,359
Because remember, you can only melee somebody when you have this set on, so it's very difficult

24
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,639
to do anything. Once you have your charge depleted, you're a sitting duck and you have to hide or you

25
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,580
have to try and outmaneuver people to get a kill. Charging out here into nowhere, just trying to

26
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,219
find someone to kill, and this soldier blows himself up on me. I always think that's funny

27
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:26,340
when that happens because the shield blocks you from blast damage, it blocks you from pyro damage,

28
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:30,259
pyro damage, it blocks you from fire. What the hell am I talking about? So anyways,

29
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:34,500
get a couple of kills right there. I get on the point. Demo Man is securing this place

30
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:41,719
like a, not a boss, something else, something else that's not as cliche, like a porcupine.

31
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:46,039
So A is now captured, almost to completion. We have pretty much the entire team on it.

32
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:52,460
This is where stuff gets real. This is where it hits the fan for our team, I guess you could say.

33
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,509
You'll see what happens. They get a couple of sentry guns up on C, and as you know, as a demo

34
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:04,539
knight, there's nothing I can do about that, and the entire team just gets suppressed. You'll see,

35
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:08,460
we come around the corner over here, get the kill on the soldier, and then, okay, there's some

36
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:14,539
sentries over there, and then watch this. It really is just like the entire cavalry just came

37
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:20,659
around that side. So anyways, I get myself killed right here. I get shot by another scout,

38
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:26,099
which is pretty much the bane of the demo knight is a scout. A good scout will always kill you,

39
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,659
in my opinion. They can just cover so much more ground than you can, the movement speed increase

40
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:35,060
and all that. They are just very, very difficult to deal with. I've killed a few scouts in this

41
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,780
gameplay, and I'm about to kill another one, but the point still stands that they are very,

42
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,860
very hard to deal with as a demo knight. I jump down here, you'll see I get him. He's not really

43
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,340
paying attention to me, so that's kind of why I get the kill. He got a little too close trying

44
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,419
to run around me. I end up turning at the right time and getting the kill, and this is now the

45
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:57,219
point where we are totally screwed, and it's very evident that we can't do a damn thing.

46
00:03:57,219 --> 00:04:02,340
Sentry right here on this side, and there's a sentry pointed down at this side too. So as a

47
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,539
demo knight, I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, there's nothing I can do. I can't do anything.

48
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:13,139
The only thing I can do is protect this area and spy check or protect the medics or something.

49
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,220
There's really nothing I can do, and as you see here, I don't really do a good job protecting

50
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,649
anybody. So when you get in a situation like this, it's a good idea to change loadouts or

51
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:26,250
just change your class completely, because there's really nothing you can do at this point,

52
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,089
especially on a map like this when there's a lot of sentries. Sentries, you can't do anything

53
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:34,089
against a sentry. If you're a demo knight, you might as well just go make a sandwich and eat it

54
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:38,839
or something, because you're not going to kill a sentry as a demo knight. Uber Pyro comes up here,

55
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,519
and I'm going to be okay, because like I said before, the shield protects you. I think it's

56
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,319
30 or 40% fire damage reduction, so I knew I was going to be okay from that, but that heavy medic

57
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:52,970
Pyro got not so much of a good outcome as I did. So at this point, I'm really considering,

58
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,529
okay, it's time to do something. I'm just going to kill myself. So I just run down here, try to

59
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:02,490
get one more kill, get myself killed. Time to change loadouts. I equipped the sticky launcher,

60
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:08,600
and the beauty of doing this, guys, is you still have the wee booties and the sword equipped. Now,

61
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,360
you don't get the benefits of being able to charge at people, and you don't really become

62
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,720
a melee-oriented class anymore, but the wee booties give you plus 25 extra health, so now

63
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,240
I'm at 200 health, and the Persian Persuader allows you to collect health as ammo, so if I

64
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,040
run over ammo, I'm going to heal myself. So you're pretty much a more stocky demo man,

65
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,519
and the only real thing you're losing is the grenade launcher. Most of your kills, most of

66
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,779
the damage, most of your buildings destroyed, they're going to be with the sticky launcher.

67
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,579
Now, some people are ridiculously good with the lock and load or with the regular grenade launcher,

68
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:46,790
but most of your kills as a demo man are going to happen with the sticky launcher.

69
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,029
Left side is now secure, as you saw. I killed every single building that was there in about

70
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:55,910
two seconds. Coming out here around the corner, I get ubered, and that second century is now

71
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,430
toast as well, and I kill about four people along with it. So here we go, bang, bang, bang.

72
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,589
Everyone's now going to come to the point. Medic goes down, pull out the sword just for funs and

73
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,990
giggles. Everybody now gets on the point. This scout does not pose much of a threat at all,

74
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,550
because I have a medic with me and I'm a demo man. So anyways, here comes the entire team.

75
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,189
Everyone's on the point. We win the game. Top fragging, probably because I just killed

76
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:23,589
six or seven buildings in 15 seconds. So thanks, everybody, so much for watching.

77
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:27,110
I really do appreciate it. Take care, everyone, and I'll see you all next time.
