1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,949
Hey, whoa, what's going on? Why are you so much faster than me? Oh, you said run like double tap W. Oh, I was gonna say this doesn't make any sense.

2
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,949
Hey, what's going on everybody? It's Jerma here and MLC Stealth. Hey guys.

3
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:27,879
Today, timed chaos build like you know it. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

4
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:34,179
We are going to be building something very, very, very special today. Going to be building a burger meal.

5
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:38,679
And what that consists of is what MLC Stealth, explain to the audience.

6
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:44,679
Well, you know, if you go to McDonald's order number one, you get yourself a cheeseburger, yourself a Coke, you get yourself some fries.

7
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:50,679
That's what we're going to be building today. Those three items. Hell yeah. Burger fries and Coca-Cola classic.

8
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:55,670
Oh, you know what? Dr. Pepper. How about that? So we got six.

9
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,670
Do you not like Dr. Pepper? Are we about to be really mad at you? I don't want to get hate.

10
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:10,359
All right, let's let's get started. Got six minutes to build a burger, fries and a soda.

11
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,840
So here we go. Ready? Are you ready? I'm ready.

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,859
Three, two, one. Burgers. Let's do it. All right. So I'll start with the soda.

13
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:27,200
Oh, we're going to be doing we're doing separate things. OK. Well, we don't have to.

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,400
No, that's all right. No, that's a good that's a good plan.

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,400
OK, I just tried making a circle. I don't know. Hold on. What on earth is this?

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,400
That's like a that's like a space invader.

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,769
A nice cup.

18
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,420
I don't know. How do you make rounded edges in Minecraft?

19
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:55,310
I don't know. Like this. All right. This burger is way too long.

20
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,730
Bring it up. Bring it up. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

21
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,730
This is going to take probably longer than like six minutes to build this.

22
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,730
Just like a red tower. All right. Oh, I'm building this upside down.

23
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,729
What? OK, we need the meat, the meat. All right. Big cheeseburger.

24
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:13,729
There's no way I can make a drink big enough.

25
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,729
You have to make it. You have to make it. Oh, nice.

26
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:19,930
Like burnt meat we're using, by the way.

27
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,930
Mike, that's like a pancake. That's not a cheeseburger.

28
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,930
No, it isn't. Just wait. It will be. Look how big that is.

29
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,930
Hey, they left it on the grill for way too long. All right.

30
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,979
It's not their fault. Yeah, they did. Not only that.

31
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:35,979
This is like leaving the burger on all day.

32
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:37,979
Somebody went to like take a poop.

33
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:40,979
He realized he was still making a cheeseburger and like, oh, jeez.

34
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:46,289
Oh, yeah. This is what happens when you leave a burger on the grill for an hour and 45 minutes.

35
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:49,979
Oh, it's like the time. Oh, it's getting dark.

36
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:52,599
No, it's not the command.

37
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,599
I forget the I forget the command already.

38
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,900
All right. Hold on. Let's see. Cheese.

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,900
She's got to go. She's got to like overlap a little bit.

40
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,900
It'll be like melting over the sides. Two minutes.

41
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,069
Oh, we got to hurry up, man.

42
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,819
Go, go, go. This cheese is way too big.

43
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,819
Help me with the burger. Forget the fries.

44
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,819
If someone was lactose intolerant, they would die.

45
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,060
No, this is no. Hold on. This is way too big.

46
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,479
What is this?

47
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,550
Dude, this is the worst trick.

48
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,979
What?

49
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,979
It needs to be tower with a straw in it. That's like what I was supposed to do.

50
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:41,979
It looks I don't even know what this looks like.

51
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:45,159
This looks like a juice box.

52
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,159
All right. Let's go. Go, go.

53
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,330
Here it is. Finish it.

54
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,330
Oh, you're making the fry box. Good for you. Good for you.

55
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,080
We're making like awkward team hunger force here.

56
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,080
We really are. Fry lock. Come on.

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,639
I got this. I don't think you're even going to be able to see the meat on this thing.

58
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,629
Yeah. This much cheese on a burger.

59
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:13,810
I would I would spit it out.

60
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,240
Oh, man. That is way too much cheese.

61
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,480
All right. Three minutes have gone by.

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Three pieces of cheese.

63
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Just like grab one piece and he just like grabbed whatever.

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,480
He took like he took like three quarters of the stack.

65
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,779
All right. Tomato. Tomato slice.

66
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:39,829
Tomato slice doesn't have to be that big.

67
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:43,329
All right. That's a good tomato slice. No, it needs to be a little higher.

68
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:47,740
It's going to be like a stacked up burger.

69
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,180
I keep on like miss clicking.

70
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,350
It's still not day, by the way.

71
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,680
Oh, I didn't do slash. That's why it's slash time.

72
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,069
No time for that.

73
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,079
All right. There's a lettuce.

74
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,540
Lettuce is going to go right here.

75
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,540
Lettuce is going to come out a little bit.

76
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,100
Nice fries. Nice golden fries.

77
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,029
These are like the fries that you get at a buffet.

78
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:19,029
You can see like the wrinkles. OK.

79
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:23,029
This this does not look anything like a burger at all.

80
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:26,029
Why in the world is everything like so lopsided?

81
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,029
Because the guy threw it together.

82
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:31,029
Did you hear? Oh, man.

83
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:35,829
The guy was drunk when he made this.

84
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:38,970
There's going to be more fries than that fry.

85
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,970
They're deeper inside. What are you talking about?

86
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,959
I'm not going to be able to finish this.

87
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,959
Get over here and finish this with me.

88
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,959
Oh, my God.

89
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,959
This is like a maze. This isn't even a burger.

90
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,389
This is a maze. This is a labyrinth.

91
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,389
Help me. Help me. We only have like one minute.

92
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:03,389
We have like a minute and 20 seconds.

93
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:05,389
All right. I'm coming.

94
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:06,389
What is this?

95
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:08,389
Help me finish the lettuce.

96
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:13,019
Oh, no. I'm freaking out.

97
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:16,019
You're just throwing rain into a can.

98
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:18,829
Oh, no.

99
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,829
This is a piece of lettuce. This is the whole cabbage.

100
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,829
Dude, it's only one minute.

101
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,829
I can't get up there. I'm stuck.

102
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:28,350
Oh, we got to finish this.

103
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,470
I made it way too big.

104
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,029
This is the least bun sandwich I've ever seen.

105
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,029
Look how tiny that bun is.

106
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,029
Compared to everything else that is this huge.

107
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:42,029
The guy that made this was shit-faced.

108
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:45,029
He just grabbed every ingredient he could find

109
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,029
and just threw it together.

110
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:49,029
This isn't even a hamburger.

111
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,029
This is like the ingredients of a hamburger.

112
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:53,029
30 seconds. We need the bun.

113
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:57,259
20 seconds.

114
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,259
Just build a tiny little bun.

115
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,670
That's good. Now finish it.

116
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,939
No. All right.

117
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,939
10 seconds.

118
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:11,689
Oh, no. This is bad.

119
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:13,689
This is really bad.

120
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:17,689
Five, four, three, two, one.

121
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,689
That's it.

122
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:26,589
This is the worst one we've ever done.

123
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:28,829
You're not even going to be able to hold on?

124
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:31,829
Do you know how you take a bite and you get bun?

125
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:34,829
You're going to have one bite of bun in that.

126
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,829
Oh, hey. Nice electrical socket you built over here.

127
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:41,579
Oh, man.

128
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:44,079
Oh, man. This is bad.

129
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,660
Well, anyways, that's a great burger.

130
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,350
Way too much lettuce.

131
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,910
We don't have any rounded edges.

132
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,910
That's because I don't know how to do round.

133
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,660
Actually, the drink does look like a juice box,

134
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,660
but I think it's the best thing out of all three items,

135
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,660
to be honest.

136
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,839
The easiest to do. A rectangle.

137
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,839
All right, so out of these three things,

138
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,839
I would probably want to drink the drink

139
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,529
and throw this in the trash.

140
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,959
Let me like...

141
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,959
Okay, it's time. Set the day. Here we go.

142
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,079
Now we can see. Nice.

143
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,470
Nice sandcastle we have.

144
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,470
My goodness.

145
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,470
Okay, so for those of you watching,

146
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,159
this is the cheese right here.

147
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,159
Oops, oops, oops. This is the cheese.

148
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,399
This is the burger right here.

149
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,399
Look at how un-proportional this is.

150
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,399
Is that a tomato?

151
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,980
That tomato has been...

152
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,980
Somebody just took the whole tomato

153
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,980
and just put it in between the buns.

154
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,980
Imagine taking a bite of that burger.

155
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,980
Yeah, like I said, you would spit it out.

156
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
So juicy.

157
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
With the whole tomato in there.

158
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,980
Wow, that is bad.

159
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,980
This is real bad. So anyways, give this a rating.

160
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,980
And let us know. Name this meal.

161
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,480
And yeah, it's a burger meal, guys.

162
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Thank you so much for watching.

163
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Really do appreciate it.

164
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
And hopefully somebody eats this.

165
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,039
But take care, everybody.

166
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,039
See you soon.

167
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,789
And goodbye.
