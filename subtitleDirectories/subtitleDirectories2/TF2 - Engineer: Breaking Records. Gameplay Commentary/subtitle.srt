00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:13,740
Hey, what is going on guys? It's Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,739
This time I'm playing as the Engineer with the Strange Wrench, the Strange Pistol, and the Strange Frontier.

3
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:27,739
Justice, I am a weird bastard today. Strange everything. Break a lot of records in this gameplay.

4
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:35,350
I actually, let me think, I break my buildings built record, my kills record, and I think that's it.

5
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,350
But I break a couple records in this gameplay, and you're probably wondering, Jerma, these records seem like they're kind of low.

6
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:47,350
Well, they are kind of low. You've got to remember, when I play Team Fortress, I go all out balls to the wall.

7
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:53,350
I flip out, I go crazy, I go aggressive. I'm not one of those people that tries to save their own life.

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:59,350
I do really well in Team Fortress 2, but usually it's in spurts of two or three lives in a row.

9
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:07,349
My one life records are kind of atrocious, so if you're wondering, oh, Jerma, you only killed like 27 people in this gameplay.

10
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:13,349
I mean, that's really good, but that's not incredible because I'm a freak show and I go and shoot people with a shotgun

11
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:16,349
when I'm supposed to be at a sentry gun 10 feet behind me.

12
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:22,090
So this is going to be a couple of tips right here. I'm going to give you guys some dust ball tips, at least some dust ball tips.

13
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:28,090
Take a look at where the teleporter is right now. You want to stuff that teleporter in the corner as far back as it's going to go

14
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,090
because spam coming around this corner, demo men, soldiers launching all their projectiles.

15
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,090
There's a chance that it's going to blow anything up over here.

16
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,090
So be careful. Make sure the teleporter is all the way back stuffed in the corner.

17
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:47,260
The sentry and the dispenser, you don't really have to worry about too much because obviously you want the sentry gun to be pointed out,

18
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:54,260
shooting at people that are walking past it, and the dispenser needs to be in a place where you can get right to it right next to the sentry.

19
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:01,260
So don't really worry about that. As long as these two are kind of tucked behind the wall here, you should be okay because you're right here to repair it.

20
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:08,259
I know a lot of people like to go inside the building on the first point on defense. That's fine. I just don't like to deal with all the spam.

21
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:13,259
I think it's easier to stand out here and not have to worry about all the explosions and all the chaos

22
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:19,569
because if an Uber comes in, that sentry in the building is probably going to go down. It's just in such close quarters.

23
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,569
You come into the building and right next to you, two feet away from you is the sentry, you're going to get rid of it.

24
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:30,569
Spy came in and I just barely got every single thing saved, but they capped the first point, and let me tell you guys right now,

25
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:37,569
don't go down with the ship. I abandon it right here, I run away. Do this if you know you're going to die.

26
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:43,569
Don't glue yourself to the sentry. Just walk away, get back to your teammates, and get some secure position

27
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,569
because look at how many revenge crits I have right now. I have 20 revenge crits.

28
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:52,569
If I had stayed there and just kept whacking the sentry to try and stay, no, no, no, I can keep it up, I can do it.

29
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:57,569
You're not going to do it. I got news for you. It's not going to work. So just abandon the sentry.

30
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:01,740
If they already have the first point anyways, what's the point of you sticking around anyway? You know what I mean?

31
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,740
Just abandon. Control-alt-delete.

32
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,050
So now I just want to briefly talk about one thing to do with the revenge crits and the engineer in general.

33
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,050
Guys, especially medics. Medic, listen up. This is important.

34
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,289
So an engineer with the revenge crits, I have 19. Up close with one shot, it does 180 damage.

35
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:24,770
Pretty much you can kill any class in the game besides a soldier or a heavy in one shot.

36
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,379
Maybe two. See, I didn't land all the pellets right there, but I do right there. 180 damage.

37
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:33,379
That'll kill any class in one hit. It's unbelievable.

38
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:38,550
Heal your engineers. If you see the glowing bright shotgun, put the heal beam on him and walk around with him.

39
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:44,550
You will kill like five people guaranteed if he has more than a few shots. And he can land them.

40
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:51,860
Far too often I'll see engineers standing by their sentry guns with the glowing bright shotgun just doing nothing.

41
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,860
And I feel like if you start to heal those people and tell them over mic,

42
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,860
Hey, how many revenge crits do you have?

43
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,400
Oh, I got 17.

44
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,699
Hey, you want to go kill the whole team right now? It's like, it's a no brainer.

45
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:09,879
So I just skipped that part right there. That was me building the sentry gun and it took about 30 seconds maybe.

46
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,879
It's nothing happened. I didn't die. It was just really boring. So I didn't want to have you guys have to sit through that.

47
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,879
But killing that sniper right there, people freak out.

48
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,879
I've said this before in other gameplay commentaries that when you get hit by a crit, when you get shot in the stomach by a crit,

49
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,879
whether it's a rocket, whether it's a shotgun, doesn't matter.

50
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,879
You freak out a little bit and you go, Okay, there's crits. I got to run by.

51
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,879
Oh, by the way, one shot kill right there.

52
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,879
But you guys know what I mean, right?

53
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,879
When you see a crit screen, when a medic pops a crit screen on somebody and their weapons are glowing,

54
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,060
you immediately go, Here comes crits. I'm gonna die.

55
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,360
The same thing can be said about somebody that has a frontier justice that's glowing.

56
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Even when I'm not playing engineer, I could be playing soldier or I could be playing spy.

57
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,360
And if I see the glowing shotgun, I go, Oh, shit.

58
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,730
And I either back up or I go for another target.

59
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,730
That's what goes through everybody's mind.

60
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,160
So this is the second sentry that's built to completion now.

61
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Get a few kills. That spy was definitely a dead ringer.

62
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
You can always tell when a spy's a dead ringer when you shoot them one time from far away

63
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,160
and it does two damage, but it magically kills them.

64
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,160
So dead ringer spies, I do that too, though. Everybody does that.

65
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Doesn't really matter.

66
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,399
So I got four kills on this sentry and I kind of do something really, really outrageous

67
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:32,399
and not recommended to most people that are playing engineer because we have this one point.

68
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,399
We only have three minutes to go.

69
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,399
And I destroy this sentry to get the crits.

70
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,399
I'm such a greedy bastard right here. You'll see. Ready?

71
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,399
Oh, this is a good idea. Yeah, let me just destroy the sentry.

72
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,399
But if you're quick enough, you can get a sentry built back to completion pretty quickly,

73
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,399
especially when I have that dispenser right there, a full level three dispenser.

74
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,399
I'm not worried about it at all.

75
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,399
Right now, I'm just curious. I want to try and look around, try and get some more kills.

76
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:02,399
Soldier right in his face, 180 damage. Remember how I said that before, 180.

77
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,699
Looking around, perusing, seeing if I can get a shot on somebody, get a kill.

78
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,699
I miss a few times, but I get the kill on him anyways from long range crit.

79
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,699
Guys, don't be afraid to do this.

80
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,699
If you're afraid to do this, if you think you need to stand by your sentry at all times

81
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:19,699
and guard it with your life, I mean, that's true.

82
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,699
But it's not true enough where you can't go have a little bit of fun.

83
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:27,699
Remember, a spy is going to try and backstab you and take out your sentry and all your buildings.

84
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,699
So what happens if a spy just saps all that stuff right now?

85
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,879
The map is small enough where I'm going to be able to get back to at least one or two of my buildings.

86
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,879
Preferably the dispenser or maybe even the sentry.

87
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:44,120
It's really not a big deal. If I'm standing here the whole time and I get backstabbed by a spy, it's all gone.

88
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Everything is going to be gone.

89
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,300
So why not utilize your crits and be able to kill some people?

90
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,470
And if the stuff gets sapped, you can just turn around and deal with it.

91
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:59,709
Now, I would not advise this strategy on a large map like upward or bad water

92
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:03,709
or any situation where there's a lot of pressure on the point.

93
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:08,709
If there's a lot of pressure, you really do need to stand back at your sentry and make sure it stays up.

94
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,709
Make sure there's a guard for the team.

95
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:14,209
But in a situation like this, it's totally okay.

96
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:18,209
As you saw right there, I let that soldier kill the sentry.

97
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:21,209
I'm not trolling this team, don't worry. I'm not like a troll or anything like that.

98
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:26,209
I did that on purpose because I wanted the crits and I was 100% confident that I could get a level 2 up

99
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:30,209
at least within 10 or 12 seconds, which is what happened.

100
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,209
The sentry is now level 2.

101
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:35,209
I'm in a different spot right now because we only have one minute left

102
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:39,379
and they haven't even come close to getting onto the point, not even one time.

103
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:44,379
So just hanging out, shooting people with the shotgun, chilling out here, trying to get some more kills with the sentry.

104
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:47,379
Nothing I can really do right now besides kind of hang out with the team.

105
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:51,379
But in my mind, I've been alive for a long time, about 7 or 8 minutes now.

106
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,379
I haven't died yet. So I'm considering, okay, I have a lot of kills.

107
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,379
I'm trying to break these records. I knew I already broke at least one record.

108
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,379
So I come out here just trying to kill some more people.

109
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,379
I know we only have 30 seconds left for me to keep padding my record.

110
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,379
Spy comes over here and knows he's a dead ringer.

111
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:10,379
So I turn around when I hit the sentry and I get him right in his face.

112
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:13,379
Counting down now, 20 seconds left in the game.

113
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:15,379
We have this in the bag. They're not going to win.

114
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,379
So I want to get some more kills.

115
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:21,379
Foolishly come around the corner with just the regular shots and the frontier justice.

116
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,379
And I get plowed by that soldier.

117
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,379
So, didn't turn out so well, but I broke a bunch of records.

118
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,379
I thought that was really cool gameplay.

119
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,379
Three seconds left. We win the game.

120
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,379
Thanks everybody so much for watching and so much for supporting the channel.

121
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,379
I really do appreciate it.

122
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:39,379
I will see you all next time and take care everybody.
