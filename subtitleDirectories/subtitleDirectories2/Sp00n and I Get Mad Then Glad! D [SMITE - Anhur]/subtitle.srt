1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,849
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Smite.

2
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:24,850
This is supposed to be the Ares breakdown video, but the reason why it's not here right now is because Ares just got a major change in the most recent patch for Smite.

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,850
And all the footage I had recorded was before the massive change.

4
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,850
So before I, of course, do a breakdown video on Ares and all of his moves and how I play him,

5
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,850
it would probably be better to record some new footage with the big changes.

6
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,850
So that's why you're not going to see that. It'll probably be there next week, next Sunday.

7
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,850
But in the meantime, I'm going to bring you a live commentary.

8
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,850
This is just going to be some stupid goofy highlights of me and Spoonerism playing the game.

9
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,850
And I'll let it speak for itself. Hopefully you enjoy the clips I've thrown together here, guys.

10
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,049
And I'll see you all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.

11
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:10,159
F3. Oh, I'm low on health.

12
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,239
Once I get this ultimate. Oh, Neath is shooting me with her freaking ultimate.

13
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:24,879
Ah, what the fuck? Oh, it interrupted my ultimate.

14
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:32,709
Are you OK? Neath shot an ulti over here. Is that why I died?

15
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:38,890
Yeah, she shot. Did she shoot me or you? I think she shot you. I think she shot me. Yeah, I think she shot you.

16
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:53,670
Go ahead. Where are they? Use it right now. Get this Q open. Bang. Oh, I'm crippled. Good. Good, good, good.

17
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,670
Damn it. I didn't have enough mana. Oh, this Kali is chasing you. This Kali is going nuts.

18
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:07,670
Shit, no. You'll be OK. Oh, I missed. Ah, shit. I didn't buy Aegis. Oh, man. I just got ultied by Neath in the mid.

19
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:19,629
Oh, Neath, bitch. Oh, what? Neath. Yeah, if I didn't miss that too, I probably would have killed that Kali as well.

20
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:24,870
But then I got ultied by freaking Neath. If I had mana, I would have killed Kali.

21
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:41,990
Ah, sorry. We're good. Yeah, she's a bitch. No, no, I didn't want to say that.

22
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:50,139

23
00:02:50,139 --> 00:03:01,930

24
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:16,629
Yeah. I thought I got him. Careful. Fall back. Oh, no, I almost got Kali. Come on, Kali, I'm almost dead.
