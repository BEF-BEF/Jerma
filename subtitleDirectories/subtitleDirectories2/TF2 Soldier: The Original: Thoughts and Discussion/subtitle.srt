00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,259
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:20,260
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier, and a little different tonight. This is the first time I've ever,

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:28,760
and this actually was the first game I ever equipped the original. And don't ask me why, it took me this long to make a video on it,

4
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,130
or this long to even put it on and use it. Probably because in games like this, I'm afraid of change, I really am.

5
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:43,530
Not having it on the right shoulder like the default, because it's the exact same thing as the default, except of course everything comes out of the middle of the screen.

6
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:53,399
And, I'm sure you've heard it a million times before, I'm not gonna say it, but we all know what this looks like, and it's pretty ridiculous.

7
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,640
So, anyways, a lot of people are gonna ask, do I think this setup is better than the default?

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Or the original? This is gonna get tough, this is gonna be a difficult commentary.

9
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
I'm gonna be like, oh yeah, what do I think about the original rocket launcher? I meant the default.

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:17,209
You know what I mean. So, the original, what it does, when it's in the middle of your screen, it allows you to see more of the right side of your screen.

11
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:24,450
It's almost like playing with no view models. Now, a lot of Team Fortress 2 pros out there probably will tell you,

12
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,450
they don't play with view models only because they want to see everything in its entirety.

13
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,450
And that makes total sense, especially when you want to see everything and not have anything blocking your way,

14
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:37,849
not caring about the animations, you really just want to play the game.

15
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:41,849
But besides that, I think the original, it throws me off.

16
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:47,159
Not in the sense of where it's placed, I mean, being in the middle it's a little awkward, but that's not what I mean.

17
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,159
What I mean is where the rockets come from.

18
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,159
The rockets are gonna come straight out of the middle of your screen, and I think I'd rather have them come out of the right side.

19
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,159
I've been trained with the trajectory of it coming out of the right, my brain thinks it comes out of the right,

20
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,560
so changing it to coming out of the middle, it's almost like drinking milk upside down.

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,560
You can do it, your body can do it, but it's just a little strange.

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,560
One thing I will say though, is it does make aiming a little bit easier because you can kind of lead people easier,

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,560
you can tell where people are going a little easier, so it's better, but at the same time it's worse.

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,560
And I think that really is just all about changing over and getting used to it and staying with it.

25
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Because if I go back, I think I talked about this in the Liberty Launcher video,

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,960
if you stick with something for long enough and then you go back to something else,

27
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,960
it's gonna take you a little time to recuperate and get your bearings.

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,710
And honestly, I think I might start using this,

29
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,710
not because of, oh, I want to get used to the mechanics so I want to try and do this,

30
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,710
no, the noise, the sound, I love the sound of this rocket launcher.

31
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:57,710
It is so beautiful, that like boom, boom, boom, it just makes me happy every single time I hear it.

32
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,599
And the backstory, this item has a really cool backstory.

33
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,159
If you are unfamiliar with Quake, Quake was one of the first real competitive first person shooters,

34
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,159
long time ago, I'm not gonna even predict when that was.

35
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,340
And the really interesting thing about Quake was it was very, very mod friendly.

36
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,520
And a couple of guys got together, they were pretty good friends I think,

37
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,520
they decided to make a mod for Quake, and it was Team Fortress.

38
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,919
And those two guys, I think it was Robin Walker and,

39
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,159
I can't think of the other guy's name, I think there was quite a few people that worked on it,

40
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,159
but Robin Walker was pretty much the head of the whole thing.

41
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,159
And to think, some guy that made a Quake mod,

42
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,330
like almost 15, 20 years ago,

43
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,639
is running Team Fortress 2 and is the brains behind this huge successful franchise.

44
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,639
That is so cool to me, and the fact that they went back to their roots,

45
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:52,639
and they picked out the original Quake rocket launcher and they said,

46
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,039
this is what made us what we are today, let's put this in the game for the Soldier.

47
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,039
That's just really cool.

48
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,039
And that's kind of the brief history of this item.

49
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,659
It is definitely a whole lot more to that story,

50
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:07,659
but I don't have the resources or really the time,

51
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:10,659
let me look at my watch, there's only about a minute left in this video.

52
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:13,659
So let's talk about the gameplay now, let's find out what's going on,

53
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,659
what am I doing?

54
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:18,160
Cool transition right there, actually it was just a cross dissolve,

55
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,459
nothing really cool about that.

56
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,459
So this is the last point right here, they're pushing the cart down,

57
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,860
and unfortunately, they are all over the place,

58
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,860
I think there was two teleporters,

59
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860
I'm pretty sure the enemy had two teleporters,

60
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,860
but they could come in and out from,

61
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,860
and they were just trashing on us so bad.

62
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,860
So I get on the cart here, I'm trying to defend this with my life,

63
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,860
I do pretty well, I get maybe two or three kills,

64
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,040
they don't really get me,

65
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
and there was no medic on the team at this point,

66
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
so we all really had to conserve our health,

67
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,040
and make sure nobody died,

68
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,040
and in situations like this, you gotta run away.

69
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,040
If there's no medic with you, and nothing you can do about that,

70
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,439
turn around and run.

71
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,439
Had the equalizer, I was pretty confident I could get away from that.

72
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,439
So pulling out the buff banner now,

73
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,439
I actually do a pretty good deed right here,

74
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,439
I jump down on the cart,

75
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,610
get rid of the heavy medic that's there,

76
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,610
but it is for naught,

77
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,610
because I end up getting gibbed by an enemy soldier,

78
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,610
and then a second soldier gets on the cart as well,

79
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,920
and we lose the game.

80
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
I guess you could call that a,

81
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,920
it was kind of a one life gameplay,

82
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,920
because it really was only 40 seconds or so of that last part there.

83
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,089
So that is going to wrap it up guys,

84
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,490
thank you so much for watching, I really do appreciate it,

85
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,490
and I will see you all next time.

86
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,490
So take care everybody.
