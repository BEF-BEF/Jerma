1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,580
It's just it's just showing us the scenery. Yeah, why is it? It's just okay. Here we go. Oh god

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,300
It's so loud. Why is it so loud? I know why did it like real out and no you're wicked loud again

3
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,320
You are so loud. I guess I'm ready

4
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,939
Let me try and change my volume again

5
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:42,020
This is the loudest game ever. Oh my god. I'm driving. Are you driving? I'm in the common your car. Are you behind me? Yeah

What's going on?

8
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,100
Let's go

9
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,100
We're taking the secret highway route

10
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,100
But everything is so loud

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,100
You are so loud

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,100
You are so loud right now

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,100
I'm sorry

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,100

17
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,099
You can't control this

18
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:10,099
What is the objective?

19
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:12,099

20
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:15,239

30
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,359
We're the team player both of us got the team player away

31
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,920
What the fuck is this game?

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,099
Hold on I'm not ready

33
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:05,099
I'm not ready I need to fix this audio

34
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,830
My mic says it's back down to like 20

35
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,830
Options

36
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,830
Audio, jeez

37
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,830
Bring the mast of all down

38
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,830
I'm driving

39
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,830
Watch out there's guys behind us

40
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,830
How do I drive this car

41
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,830
Drives like a piece of shit

42
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,830
Yeah it does a little bit

43
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,830
Why do you get arrows pointing?

44
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,830
Why do I get the GPS?

45
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,830
I'm getting out

46
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,900
This is the hardest I've laughed in a long time

47
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,789
Oh my god

48
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:10,229
I'm just watching some guy drive his car

49
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,560
This is the best thing ever

50
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
How's this guy doing? He looks like he's well in the life

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,560
He's just like looking at me just beeping

52
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,120
What just happened?

53
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:51,930
He had a blue light expression

54
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,740
I'm just getting out

55
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,740
It has to be VIP

56
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,330
He's alive

57
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,759
VIP's alive

58
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,759
That makes no sense

59
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,960
Come here Jerma

60
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,139
What's with his foot?

61
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,139
He's squashed in there

62
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,139
Oh my god

63
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,139
Watch out

64
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,269
This game

65
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:25,269
I can't take it anymore I gotta get out of here

66
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:27,269
Wait what the hell what's your name in here Jerma

67
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,269
You stole his car

68
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,660
Like five people just

69
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,660
Gunned him down like surrounded him

70
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,660
And just started firing

71
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,660
Alright I'm driving I'm going fast

72
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,660
I got the need for speed

73
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,660
Get out of the car

74
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,660
Get out of the car

75
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,660
There's two of the same guy holding their feet on the car

76
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,660
On the dash I'm stuck in this

77
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,660
Get me the

78
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,660
Behind you

79
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,660
There's two of the same guy with the feet

80
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,660
On the dash

81
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,660
Same guy

82
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,660
I seriously am passing out

83
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,660
You see the spoiler on the back of that car

84
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,660
I'm too busy blacking out

85
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,899
It just threw us into this game

86
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:15,459
Seriously we were at the ready screen

87
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,459
It got wicked loud

88
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,730
That was just too much

89
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,730
Too much stimulation

90
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,730
Of the brain
