00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,759
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jermah here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,760
And today, tonight, tonight, whatever time it is whenever you're watching this video.

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,760
I know I say tonight a lot in these commentaries, but that's just because I happen to be making these at nighttime.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,760
So anyways, let's get out of there and let's talk about what I want to discuss in this video.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,759
First of all, I'm playing as the Demoman with the lock and load, the strange lock and load.

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,759
The sticky bomb launcher, I believe that is strange as well, and the half satoshi.

7
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,759
I think everything is strange, my goodness gracious. How many things do I have that are strange?

8
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,000
But anyways, let's move on to the commentary. This is not going to talk about the gameplay really at all.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But it has to do with gameplay or gaming in general.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,179
And it's going to be, if you've seen from the title of this video, how to get better at online gaming.

11
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,179
Now this is not just Team Fortress 2. This could be any of these competitive online games.

12
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,180
It could be any game where you're playing against somebody else, where there's somebody on the other team.

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,739
You're fighting against another actual human being in a competitive atmosphere.

14
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,739
So whenever I get asked this question, or I'm sure whenever you guys get asked this question as well,

15
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:19,739
some of you guys that have been playing games for a very long time, your response probably goes something like this.

16
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,739
When somebody says, oh hey, how do you get better at that game? How do you get better at Team Fortress?

17
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:27,739
How do you get better at Smite? I'm bad at Battlefield. What do I do?

18
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:29,739
Usually the answer goes something like this.

19
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:33,909
Well, if you want to get better, you have to practice and you have to play the game.

20
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:40,150
Which is true, but that's not entirely 100% all you have to do.

21
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,150
If it were that easy, if all you had to do was turn the game on and play it for a long time,

22
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,329
I would be really good at a lot of games that I'm not that good at.

23
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:52,329
But what you have to do, guys, this is the best advice I can give to getting better at an online game,

24
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:56,500
you have to know what everybody can do.

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
And I'm talking about not players.

26
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,680
I'm talking about generally what classes can do, what types of abilities they have,

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,680
how to get out of those abilities, how to find yourself in a better situation, et cetera, et cetera.

28
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Now let me be perfectly clear here. Let me try and make this as easy as I can.

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,919
If you start playing Team Fortress and you jump on as the scout, you need to play not only as the scout,

30
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:24,919
but you need to put equal time into the soldier, the spy, the engineer.

31
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,919
You need to play as everybody to know what everybody can do.

32
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,919
And you need to know all the situations, all the weapons.

33
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,919
Like you're talking about a game like Battlefield.

34
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,919
Get familiar with all the guns. Find out everything about the game.

35
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:44,919
Because then you'll know in every single situation what you would have done and ways to avoid yourself,

36
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,219
if that makes any sense.

37
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,219
Because there's a limited amount of things that you can really do in these games.

38
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:55,219
And once you find out, once you play as these classes or these heroes or use these abilities,

39
00:02:55,219 --> 00:03:01,219
you're going to know exactly how they work and ways that you would be able to get around them.

40
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:05,219
For instance, if you're playing against a scout that has the Force of Nature,

41
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,219
you know if you play with it and you use it, you know exactly the ups and downs of that weapon.

42
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:14,219
So you'll be able to kill the person using it because you know exactly what they're going to do.

43
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,219
And to follow that up a little bit, head on over to some of these games' wiki pages.

44
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:21,219
They are very, very helpful.

45
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,219
I have read so many articles on the Team Fortress wiki.

46
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,219
Same thing as the Smite wiki. Same thing.

47
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:31,530
When I used to play World of Warcraft, I would always be at wowhead.com.

48
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,530
Just to get myself educated on certain things, finding out drop rates, finding out this and that.

49
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,530
Wiki pages are an absolute blessing when it comes to learning games and getting better at them.

50
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:48,330
So before this video is over, I want to bring up the last point I want to make on online gaming and getting better at it.

51
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,330
You are going to get frustrated.

52
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,330
It is going to happen, especially if you're going to play one of these competitive online games.

53
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,330
You are going to get mad.

54
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,330
It's going to happen because you're getting thrown into an environment you've never been in before.

55
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,330
You're going to get killed by guys that have been playing the game for years, potentially months, years, whatever it ends up being.

56
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,330
And you're going to get mad.

57
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,330
And that's growing, period, guys, because every time you die in one of these games,

58
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,330
you're going to kind of analyze how you died.

59
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,329
You go over it in your head a little bit and you say, you know, I'm not going to let that happen again.

60
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:22,329
And eventually when that happens a ton of times and you know all these situations that you've died in,

61
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:28,629
you're going to start to see yourself creep higher and higher and higher up the scoreboard because it's just learning.

62
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:30,629
It's all just a learning process.

63
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,629
It's all just going up in your brain and your noggin up there.

64
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,629
Every time you lose, every time you fail, you're learning something else.

65
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,629
So it's OK to fail.

66
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,629
It's OK to die in these games.

67
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:43,629
Don't get too frustrated because it's going to happen to everybody.

68
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:48,000
It's very, very rare for someone to turn a game on that they've never played before

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and just start top-fragging and being an absolute pro.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It doesn't really happen.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And if it does happen and for some reason you've played a game that you never played before

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and you're really, really good at it, then that's really awesome.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Good for you because it takes usually a lot of time before you get to that level.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,620
So to bring this all full circle, let's just do a little recap here.

75
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,620
40% practice, 40% knowing all the information in all the situations,

76
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,620
and 20% failure.

77
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,620
That is my personal formula to get better at online gaming.

78
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,860
And also, real quickly, make sure you're having fun during this whole process

79
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
because if you're not having fun while you're playing a game,

80
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,860
then the game isn't really doing its job.

81
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,860
You really need to have as much fun as you possibly can with these games

82
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,860
because that's what they're there for.

83
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,490
They're there for you to play, to enjoy, and not to lose your mind over.

84
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,490
So that is going to wrap up the video, guys.

85
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,490
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

86
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,490
And I'll catch you guys all next time.

87
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,490
And of course, take care, everybody.
