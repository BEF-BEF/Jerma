00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:27,170
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a live TF2 gameplay commentary, but before the live commentary kicks in, as you see by the title of this video, 25,000 subscribers. Thank you all so, so much. You guys all rock and freaking roll, dude.

2
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:44,579
So what does that mean? That means now I have to pick three people from my Twitter to get 33% of my entire backpack. I have just done that. So please, please go check your Twitter mentions right now, because I just mentioned three people.

3
00:00:44,579 --> 00:01:03,890
And if that's you, if you're one of those people, please direct message me on Twitter, not on Facebook, not on YouTube. Only send me a direct message on Twitter. And in that message, please include your Steam ID. I need that. That's like the most important thing in this whole thing.

4
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:28,560
But yeah, congratulations to the winners, guys. And my other announcement for 25,000 subs is guys, I'm finally going to get a TF2 server and it's going to actually work. There's going to be people behind it that know what they're doing. So look forward to that. Hopefully we can have some good times on there because I know I had the last server I had was a real, a real mess. And hopefully this time around that will not happen.

5
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:41,560
But yeah, thank you so much, everybody. You guys are all amazing. I love every single one of you guys. Thank you for subscribing. Thank you for supporting the channel. And yeah, those of you that won, enjoy my goddamn backpack.

6
00:01:41,560 --> 00:02:04,189
So here comes a live commentary, guys. I had some fun with Italics, Boo Man 61, and of course, MLC Stealth. So I hope you enjoy the video, guys. And as data trickles in on this new TF2 server I'm getting, I will absolutely let you guys know the second I get new info. So yeah, I'll see you guys all next time and take care, everybody.

7
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:43,580
No, you meant to say boo. Oh, that's what man 61. I hear he's much cooler. Oh, what'd you hear that? I'm on blue. Yeah. Are you really? Oh, no, I don't know what everyone's special steam name is on here. I'm German. Yeah, that's gonna confuse so many people.

8
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:52,080
Like, wait, why is this guy? What's this? So wait, okay, which one am I? That's like the real mine's already highlighted. Nevermind.

9
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:58,219
Who's demo night war interrupted by a scout?

10
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:08,039
So boo, who are you on blue? Oh, I'm flat 2012. Feel like I'm making a Dr. Seuss poem right there.

11
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:18,219
Boo, who are you on blue? Oh, I'm Flump. See that to me that sounds like like a like a Disney movie. Like see Flump and his friends.

12
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:30,610
The new Disney Pixar. Flump 2012. Coming soon to HD DVD. Oh God. I'm just kidding. Oh, that was you.

13
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:40,780
Pixar presents Flump and Cole. Can I just tell you, it just said Jerma and Bungo killed somebody, but it was lit up right on my screen.

14
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,780
So I really just thought that's confusing the hell out of me. Oh, look, there I am.

15
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,780
Oh, jeez, that's so funny. God.

16
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:11,530
Let's just switch all of our names around. Oh, there we go. Or maybe demo night, not the best.

17
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:20,779
I'm doing horrible too. Oh, don't let him get the help. Hey, Jerma, don't let him get the help.

18
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:29,019
Wait, what team is there? Like what team is there? Jerma, are you on my team? Me and you are on the same team.

19
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:35,019
And then me and me and Boo. We're both, we're both demo, demo men. Oh God, I have no idea.

20
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:43,019
You guys have like four sentries and we need to blow them the fuck up. Hey, I think we're all demo men.

21
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:47,019
We're just different forms of demo men.

22
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:55,209
What is this guy doing? Oh God. Oh, get destroyed.

23
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:03,839
I'm so scared of that Huntsman sniper. I really am. Whoa. There goes the teleporter. Hi Bungo.

24
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:10,449
Oh, hey Jerma. Oh, jeez. I just charged right into it. And there goes the sentry gun.

25
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:17,939
Don't worry, there's only like another two. Yeah. Oh my God. We really do have so many sentry guns. It's a joke.

26
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:23,699
It's a joke. Even worse news is that I've managed to switch team to red.

27
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,699
Really? Come on. Everyone versus Alex.

28
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:35,939
Hey, I found another crate. Oh, oh God. Oh, I need to open mine live on television.

29
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,939
Okay, here we go. Oh, that scout is dead.

30
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:47,870
Come on. Yes, I do have 20 crates now for anyone interested. Hell yeah. I'm going to open mine though.

31
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,870
I'm going to open mine though. Hey, will you stop talking in the chat as me?

32
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,939
All right, fine. I'm jumping on the bandwagon.

33
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:06,250
What is this heavy doing? Oh my gosh, hold on. I'm lagging super duper good right now.

34
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,490
I'm about to critscreeing both of you snipers over here. Oh my God, you got the ubered.

35
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,660
Oh wait, this is a regular one. I thought I had critscreeing out. Oh my God, I have the Huntsman right now.

36
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,660
You pretty much just ubered like a stack of hay.

37
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,660
There was a heavy back there, but he was just standing around not doing anything.

38
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,660
So I was like, forget them. I'm going to uber this sniper out here. Watch out for the scout.

39
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,899
No, you scout bastard.

40
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:44,050
There's like a floating tank. What is this? Oh, come on, push the cart, Jerma.

41
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:51,050
Oh, Peepa's helping push the cart. Oh, look who's on our team, Shibby2012.

42
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,050
Shibby, if you're watching, I'm so sorry about this.

43
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:02,050
Shibby2012. I can't even say it. My brain doesn't work.

44
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,569
Oh, I just hit the cart. Maybe we can make a roll out of this, huh?

45
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,569
Oh yeah. Maybe. Watch out for spies.

46
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:14,569
Watch out for spies. We got two heavies out here and two medics.

47
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,000
Jerma and Shibby just got a kill plus assist.

48
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Watch out. Watch out on the right. Watch out on the right.

49
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I can't even hit this guy. Oh, he's dead.

50
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,750
Sentry. Oh no, I missed. No.

51
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,019
Oh, I didn't kill that sentry. Come on, heavies, take them down.

52
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,019
Oh my God, look how many people we have on this sentry.

53
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:39,019
There's a lot.

54
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:43,319
Oh my God, I'm killing everyone. Good Lord.

55
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,620
And we managed to take them down steamrolling the competition.

56
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,620
That was unbelievable, dude.

57
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,620
Did you guys do something amazing?

58
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,620
Good job, Shibs.

59
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,620
Oh, you're going to get smashed. Oh, he's got the, never mind.

60
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,310
Spencer. No. Oh, Jerma stole the kill.

61
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,310
Jerma. I stole everything.

62
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,310
I'm trying to give you guys like healing prep rolls, but I can't keep track of who's who.

63
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:12,939
How did I miss him?

64
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:14,939
Wait, heal Jerma right now.

65
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:19,750
There we go. Oh, crit rocket. Come on.

66
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,230
Come on. Oh no, like six heads.

67
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,230
Oh, and spied in the back.

68
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,230
Oh, he's trying to spy me too.

69
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,230
Spied, spied.

70
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,230
I got switched.

71
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,230
Oh no.

72
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,230
Shibs on the other team.

73
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,230
Auto balance servers for the loss.

74
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:46,230
In the title of this video, it should be like, oh, like TF2 with MLC stealth, italics, boo man, and Shibby 2012.

75
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,230
Oh, can I just tell you right now, dude, I keep thinking you're a spy.

76
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,230
I keep checking you and oh my God.

77
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,230
Like every time I see you, I'm guaranteeing myself that you are a spy.

78
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,230
Oh wait, that's not me. Oh wait.

79
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,230
Oh no.

80
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,230
So funny.

81
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:07,789
I think we're going to win.

82
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:09,789
Are we going to win? Oh no.

83
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:11,789
Is this going to happen?

84
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:13,789
Jumping around like a prof.

85
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:15,789
Flying out of nowhere.

86
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,799
All right.

87
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,799
Shibby.

88
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Yeah, I'm on blue.

89
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Are you going to get it?

90
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,409
Coming down the stairs.

91
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:28,409
Coming down the stairs.

92
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:30,409
Shibby.

93
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,409
No.

94
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:34,409
Push it.

95
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,159
Oh no.

96
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,159
I don't want to be here when it blows up.

97
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,159
I fell down the pipe.

98
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,159
Oh yeah.

99
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,159
That should not even count as a kill for you, boo.

100
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,159
You didn't kill me.

101
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,159
You brought me on me and I committed suicide.

102
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,159
At least I made it onto the top of the scoreboard twice.

103
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,159
As two different accounts.
