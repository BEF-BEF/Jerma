00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Rayman Jungle Run, a little gem of a game.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Welcome to Little Gems, guys. My name is Jerma. Nice to see you, nice to meet you.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,179
If you don't know what this series is, this is probably episode 5 or 6 so far, where I cover a iOS and Android capable game.

4
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:38,539
This week is going to be, like I said, Rayman Jungle Run, which is a free-running, parkour, Sonic the Hedgehog, Bit Trip Runner combination game.

5
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:43,539
And I will get into more detail, obviously, on that, so do not worry. I'm not just going to throw that out there and go,

6
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,539
yeah, that's the whole game, alright, we'll see you next time.

7
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,539
That is not going to happen, so let's get right into this here, talk about the basics.

8
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:55,539
This is, first of all, not a canon Rayman game. It's not canonical...canon...canon?

9
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:02,539
I have no idea how you say that, but this is not a canon Rayman game. It's not like Rayman 1, 2, 3, and then oh, Rayman Jungle Run.

10
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:06,540
This is a side game, a sort of spin-off game of the series.

11
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,170
So what do you do in this game? What do you have to do? What is the point of Rayman Jungle Run?

12
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:18,170
Well, according to the title of the game, you're going to be doing a whole lot of moving and shaking, mostly the first one.

13
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,170
So it's a game about running really, really fast and picking up these golden bugs.

14
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,340
There are 100 of them on each level. Trying to beat your old scores is your number one priority here.

15
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:35,340
There is no storyline, so you don't go from level 1 to level 2 and try to figure out some kind of murder mystery or something.

16
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,650
You're just going for high scores and for the smallest amount of time completed.

17
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,650
And just like Super Meat Boy and games like Bit Trip Runner that require a lot of memorization and repetition of levels,

18
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,650
you are going to become so addicted to this game that you have to repeat the level.

19
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,650
You want to get every single bug because it's not impossible.

20
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,650
It's incredibly challenging, a lot of levels in this game, but they are not impossible.

21
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,650
You just have to get the memorization down and the repetition down, and you will flow through these levels like butter,

22
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,949
which is quite the sight to see sometimes.

23
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,949
You will step back after a session of this game and say to yourself,

24
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:17,949
Oh my word, I was in a real rhythm right there. I was just flowing through these levels. That was awesome.

25
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:23,259
The one complaint that I have about this game, and it's a complaint that I have with other runner type games,

26
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,259
is you can really get into this thing that I call Blendovision,

27
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:31,259
where you kind of lose control of your mind and you just forget what you're doing and where you're going,

28
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:36,259
and you just end up losing because you're blending every single one of your thoughts together in the game.

29
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:41,199
I don't know if that makes any sense, but let me know if you understand what I'm talking about.

30
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,199
But with all that said though, you're going to get a fantastic game.

31
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,199
It's a universal app, by the way. You can get this for Android, iPhone, iPad.

32
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,199
It doesn't matter which one. The links will be in the description.

33
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,199
But you're getting a beautiful game.

34
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,199
This is probably one of the best looking games I've ever seen on the iPad,

35
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:59,199
and it's not because of some amazing 3D graphics engine or something like that.

36
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,199
It's the art style and how the colors just pop out at you,

37
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:07,199
and how it looks like every character is just created from this crazy imagination of somebody.

38
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,199
I love that so much.

39
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,759
And talking about a little bit more of the gameplay,

40
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,759
you start out just being able to jump just by tapping the screen,

41
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,759
and it evolves into being able to hand glide with your head,

42
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:23,759
being able to run up walls, being able to punch through walls and stuff like that.

43
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,759
And eventually, you have to put all these together.

44
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,759
You have to combine all of these abilities into the same level,

45
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,759
which makes for some very interesting gameplay,

46
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,759
knowing when and where to use your various abilities,

47
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,759
which is the real challenge of the game.

48
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,759
And I also forgot to mention this. There's nine levels in each one of these sets.

49
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:47,759
Jump is a set, Fly is a set, Wall Run and Punch are both sets as well,

50
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,759
and they all have nine levels.

51
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,759
There is a tenth level in each one of these sets,

52
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:57,759
but the only way you can unlock it is if you complete five levels in one of these sets.

53
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,759
Let's say you complete five levels in Wall Run at 100%,

54
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,759
you will unlock the tenth level, which is the hardest.

55
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,379
But final closing thoughts on this game is you're going to get a lot of content.

56
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,379
It might take you less than an hour to blow through all the levels,

57
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:19,379
but, but, but, but, to actually complete them all and unlock the hardest level sets,

58
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:21,379
it's going to take you a lot longer than that,

59
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:25,379
because at the end, in the Wall Run and the Punch levels, very specifically,

60
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,379
it's a lot harder to 100% those levels.

61
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,379
And even when you do 100% them,

62
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:34,379
you're going to want to go back and try to beat your old times as well.

63
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:37,009
So there's a lot to do in this game.

64
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:40,009
It's currently priced at $2.99.

65
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,009
I think it's a great pickup for how beautiful the game is

66
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,009
and how much fun you're going to have with it.

67
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:46,379
I suggest it absolutely.

68
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:48,379
And that is going to wrap up the video, guys,

69
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:50,379
so thank you so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.

70
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:53,379
And go have fun with this little gem, baby.

71
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:56,379
I'll see you guys all soon, and of course, take care, everybody.
