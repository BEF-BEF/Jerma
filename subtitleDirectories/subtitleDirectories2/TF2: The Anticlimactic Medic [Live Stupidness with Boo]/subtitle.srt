1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,859
Once we turn this corner, you're probably gonna kill a lot of people.

2
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,320
This should be fun.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,620
Alright, you ready?

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,620
Where'd the sniper come from?

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,690
Right when you come out here.

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,440
Oh, come on!

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,440
That would've been so epic.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,940
If you had just jumped out here and there was like a dozen people.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,380
That was anticlimactic.

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,020
Yeah, just a little bit.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,020
Look at this big, handsome Russian.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,960
Ha ha!

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,990
What was he a spy?

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,990
Oh no, he changed him. Shit.

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,750
That was the stupidest thing ever.

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,060
He looks conspicuous. Oh, ready to give him a sandwich.

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,060
Oh, I got him.

18
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,359
Oh, I think I gave it to the sniper by accident.

19
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,359
Dude, you just walked up and just like, yeah, like punched that guy.

20
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,359
He just like, groaned. That was great.

21
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,359
He changed him.

22
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,359
That was great.

23
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,359
You guys could not have planned that.

24
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,659
That was fantastic.

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,349
I'm so glad I'm recording that right now because I'm probably gonna put it somewhere.

26
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:22,670
Yeah, definitely. That was funny.

27
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,480
Uh-oh. Oh, here we go.

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
Oh, nope.

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,659
Damn it.

30
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:29,659
They're just rolling it.

31
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,900
I feel like every time we get up here, it's like, just the most...

32
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,900
I feel like we're in like a movie and there's nothing ever happening.

33
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,900
We're gonna win, right?

34
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,230
You know what? Here, just...

35
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:45,719
Yeah, I'm done.

36
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,719
Oh, where did you come from?

37
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,469
There was a scout behind me.

38
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:50,469
A lot of stuff going on.

39
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:53,469
Oh, I can't go up there with you, man. I'm gonna get destroyed.

40
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:55,469
And there's a spy right here. Get hit with a guy with a beard.

41
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:56,769
Shit.

42
00:01:56,769 --> 00:02:01,560
Oh, he actually got the point. Shit.

43
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,060
That's... What?

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,230
Wait a second.

45
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,230
Oh, he's real.

46
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,230
Hold on a second. He's real?

47
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,230
He is real.

48
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,469
I shot him. He walked through me.

49
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:10,530
Oh, wow.

50
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:20,340
All right, let's do the pyro behind.

51
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,340
Sandwiches.

52
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,340
I got you. Come here, brah.

53
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,340
Come here, brah.

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,949
Oh, okay.

55
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:29,770
Why are we all still just like standing here?

56
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,770
Is this not the right capture point?

57
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,770
I feel like this guy's a spy, man. Every time.

58
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,259
He's just holding the syringe gun.

59
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:41,979
Boy Who Cried Wolf. One of these times, someone's gonna come behind us and it's gonna actually be a spy.

60
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:45,969
Oh, come here.

61
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:48,340
Oh, this guy needs it more.

62
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,530
Yeah, I'll grab a health kit.

63
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,530
All right, I got crits.

64
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,229
Here we go.

65
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:00,199
Here we go.

66
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,610
Let's overheal the hell out of everybody.

67
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,560
This pyro.

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
And...

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Let me know when you want it.

70
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,199
Wait till we see a bunch.

71
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,080
Oh, come here.

72
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,370
Yikes.

73
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,370
Is the healing beam even on you?

74
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,370
Why is it going the...

75
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,370
What's going on here?

76
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,370
Why is it going the other direction?

77
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,370
Did you get a headshot?

78
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,680
Yeah.

79
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
Oh, dear.

80
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,849
Are you a spy?

81
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:32,849
No, you're not.

82
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,599
I'm gonna use this crits, man.

83
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,740
It's holding on to this.

84
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,919
Yeah, it's popping on anybody.

85
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,180
All right, Ryan.

86
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,479
I hope you're ready.

87
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:45,539
They're gonna come from over there.

88
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,490
And we're gonna need you.

89
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,490
Oh, baby.

90
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,860
One more.

91
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,060
Yes.

92
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,419
And we're gonna...

93
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:59,520
Oh, good thing we killed that one heavy...

94
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,590
This is so, like...

95
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,300
That's a pretty awesome arrow.

96
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,060
This guy looks like he's literally just standing here guarding the door like a bouncer.

97
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,150
Hey, quote on the cop.

98
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,449
What's up, buddy?

99
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,740
Come here, Mr. Green Acid Face.

100
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
Now, let's see how many people liking beard in a row.

101
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,110
Here we go.

102
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,110
I'm gonna go for some beards.

103
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,819
You wanna get bearded?

104
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,500
You wanna get hit with a beard?

105
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,060
Come on.

106
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,300
Come on out.

107
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,540
This guy is afraid of me.

108
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,540
And I literally am holding the beard as a medic.

109
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,540
I'm holding the do-no-harm thing.

110
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,839
Let's go.

111
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,839
Here we go.

112
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,839
Going in.

113
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,019
Oh, you wanna go?

114
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,639
Going in hot.

115
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,639
Going in hot.

116
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,819
Come on, man.

117
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,189
Really?

118
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:55,189
What?

119
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:56,189
You're not gonna do it?

120
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:57,189
I'm following you.

121
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:58,189
I'm gonna follow you all the way to where...

122
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:59,810
Oh, you prick.

123
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,810
I'm still gonna get him.

124
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,370
I'm still gonna get him.

125
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:08,089
Oh!

126
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:09,089
I got crits.

127
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:10,089
I don't know who the hell...

128
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,459
There's only two snipers here.

129
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:12,459
Crits behind you.

130
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,959
Turn around, please.

131
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:17,310
Turn around.

132
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:24,060
Well, he died.

133
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,060
They got a sentry.

134
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,060
Oh, this is gonna be hard.

135
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,230
Yeah, that sentry's looking at me funny.

136
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,350
I'm just sitting here with this guy.

137
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,550
Get, like, a nice hefty over-heel.

138
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,430
Thank you.

139
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,430
Ah, it's a demo, man.

140
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,430
And he missed.

141
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,660
I'm just sitting here.

142
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
This guy is so ridiculous.

143
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,660
This guy's insane.

144
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,220
This guy's just getting, like, headshots over and over again.

145
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,220
I'm just, like, protecting him.

146
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,500
Pocket sniper.

147
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,639
I don't know.

148
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,819
That's not such a good idea anymore.

149
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,379
Come to me.

150
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,879
Oh, thanks.

151
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,879
So, this is a very unsafe door.

152
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,120
Oh, boy.

153
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Yeah, this is not...

154
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Almost hit me in the head.

155
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,980
It's not a good place to be.

156
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,160
Sentry.

157
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
Is the sentry still there?

158
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
No.

159
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,720
Dead with a spy, I think.

160
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
I got a charge.

161
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Are there any, like, power classes around here?

162
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
Oh, the sentry's at the back.

163
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Oh, no!

164
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Oh, no!

165
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,019
Oh, no!

166
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,449
Get away from me!

167
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:28,449
Eat beard!

168
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:29,449
I just lagged, but please let...

169
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:30,449
What the hell is going on?

170
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:36,480
I was about to make fun of myself.

171
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,040
And this guy, when he makes the step over here, is dead.

172
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,040
Heavy, when you come out, I'm waiting for the heavy.

173
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Specifically.

174
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,540
Just to make, like, a point.

175
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,959
Where is he?

176
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,459
If this is not the most obvious spy in the world, I really don't know what it is.

177
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,459
I'm standing here.

178
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:59,189
Fuck you, Jared.

179
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:01,250
Go back to Subway.

180
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,750
Please just roll us right now.

181
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,680
Oh, my God!

182
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,009
What did I just do?

183
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,439
Dude, I just...

184
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:23,259
Oh, my...

185
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,889
All right, dude.

186
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:25,889
Okay, so I just...

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:28,389
You know, when you use the huntsman, you just, like, come out and, like, block...

188
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:30,389
By the way, I'm so glad this is over.

189
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,129
We just, like, lost.

190
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,629
All right, so, you know, you ever just use the huntsman, and you just blind fire randomly, just, like, knock an arrow for fun?

191
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:41,629
I just did that out of the spawn door, and I headshot a guy on our own team who was a spy, and he had him in the face.

192
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,129
He was, like, all the way down.

193
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,129
That was ridiculous.

194
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,750
That guy's probably so pissed.
