00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,140
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,140
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier with items equipped.

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,379
If I didn't have items equipped, I'd be running around punching people.

4
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:24,379
I'd be the Heavy, but I'm not the Heavy, I'm the Soldier.

5
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:28,379
Anyways, we're gonna be talking about something in this video, not the gameplay. It's gonna kinda sit in the background.

6
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,379
We're gonna bring up something that I was thinking of the other night.

7
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,380
I was lying in bed, and I was watching TV.

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:42,799
And when you watch TV late at night, you get to be introduced to the wacky, wonderful wizard world of infomercials.

9
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:52,229
If you don't know what an infomercial is, an infomercial is a commercial that is an entire block of television length, right?

10
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:58,469
It's a 30 minute long commercial, where they just keep playing the same thing over and over again.

11
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,840
And usually, it's a joke. It's never something I ever take seriously.

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,840
And I think a lot of people are in the same boat, where you're just sitting there watching the TV, and you go,

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,640
What the hell am I watching right now? Can I change the channel?

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,640
The problem with an infomercial is you have some weird sorcery spell on you.

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,640
You can't change the channel. You reach for the remote, but it's so dumb and so enticing,

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,640
and there's so many stupid cliches, like the black and white screen of people doing something really stupid,

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,640
like their house exploding because they used the wrong onion peeler.

18
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,640
You've got to keep watching, and you can't grab the remote. You have to sit there and watch it.

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,140
I've done that before, and I've seen so many infomercials, I think, over the course of my life,

20
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,140
that I've become so accustomed to these things that it's like a game of Jeopardy.

21
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,140
You ever watch Jeopardy, and you see something, and you yell out the answer,

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,140
and you're like, God damn it, Jake, why couldn't you get that? It was George Washington.

23
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:59,379
I do that with infomercials, because they become so predictable with all the dumb shit that they pull

24
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:05,379
that I treat it like it's a game, like the buy one, get one free thing they do in these infomercials.

25
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:10,379
Here's one example, right? Buy one, get one free. Oh, the super blender.

26
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,379
If you buy one, you get the second one absolutely free.

27
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:18,379
No, no, no, no, no, they're including the second blender in the price of the first one.

28
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:21,379
You're paying for two blenders. They're just telling you one is free.

29
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:27,870
And sometimes, the thing that they're giving you two of is something you would never actually even want two of.

30
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,870
They're just forcing you to take the second one, right?

31
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,870
Well, you have a blender. It's in your house. It does the blending.

32
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,240
You don't need two of them. What, are you going to give it to your friend?

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,240
You're going to give it to your mother or something? Your mother's going to look at you and go,

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Honey, I have a fucking blender. Like, I don't need to get this out of here.

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,419
And someone's going to throw it away. Or you give it to like a bum, and he makes like bum smoothies.

36
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:55,780
A bum smoothie is pretty simple, pretty basic. It's one pack of cigarettes with one broken up cigarette in it.

37
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,780
A banana peel, an apple core, and piss. And then you blend it up in a bum smoothie.

38
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:09,219
Like, no, but seriously though, can you possibly imagine a world where all the dumb infomercial crap

39
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:14,460
that we have been used to for like the last 20, 30, 40 years, it was brought over to gaming?

40
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,210
I actually kind of wish there was an infomercial for a video game.

41
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:26,210
I can picture in my head just how outrageous and how stupid and unbearably dumb

42
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,580
a video game infomercial would be. What would it even be? What would you do?

43
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,580
I can't really think of that many options for any of these directors or marketing people.

44
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,879
But then again, there are countless infomercials on mops and like dustpans.

45
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,879
If they can do that, if they can do dustpan and mop infomercials,

46
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,879
I'm pretty sure they could come up with something for Call of Duty.

47
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,419
I mean, they've done infomercials on books. How do you do an infomercial on a book

48
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,419
that people just sit there and they talk about the book?

49
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:01,099
And an infomercial for a game could be pretty damn funny.

50
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:05,099
I mean, I could just picture like the black and white screen like we talked about before.

51
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:10,099
It's some lady sitting there and she's playing Battlefield and it's really, really dumpy looking.

52
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,099
It's like 2D old NES graphics on the screen.

53
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,100
And there's a voiceover that comes on and says, has this ever happened to you?

54
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,100
And the lady's like teeth just start falling out and she's like, I don't have my fucking teeth.

55
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,100
And then it cuts immediately to a bright, nice, colorful screen with big 3D graphics.

56
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,100
And she's sitting there so happy, she smiles right in the camera.

57
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,100
She's playing Call of Duty and it's like, ding, her teeth are like nice and shiny.

58
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:43,100
And a voiceover comes back on and just says, if you play Call of Duty, you'll never see this problem again.

59
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,850
That would be so stupid. What am I talking about? This would suck.

60
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,540
And I want to mention this because I know that's going to start a fight in my comment section.

61
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,540
I don't mean COD is better than Battlefield, Battlefield is better than COD.

62
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,540
That was just a strict example because I know that'll start like an enormous fight in my comment section.

63
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,540
So please don't do that. It was just an example.

64
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:10,290
Back on topic, infomercials don't really work on our generation.

65
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:16,459
My generation and younger, like the 20 to 30 crowd and younger, we don't care about infomercials.

66
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:20,459
We never probably will because they're not really targeted to us.

67
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,459
Infomercials are targeted to people usually from a much older generation.

68
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:32,459
People that will take into consideration when buying a product how many marbles were sucked up into the vacuum during the demonstration.

69
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:38,829
Like, oh, did you see that, honey? He picked up 12 marbles. I wonder if my vacuum can do that.

70
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:45,829
We don't need that. We don't need some magic magician TV box man to show us the same demonstration

71
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:52,829
we've essentially been seeing now on TV and infomercials for the last at least 30 to 40 years.

72
00:05:52,829 --> 00:06:00,259
At the click of a button, you can compare prices and compare features and efficiency on anything

73
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,259
you could possibly imagine in the world for a product.

74
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,949
But just wanted to get that off my mind. It was on my chest and I had to get it out there.

75
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:12,949
If you guys have anything to say, of course, leave it in the comment section.

76
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:17,129
Keep the discussion going and that's going to wrap up the video.

77
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:19,129
So thank you all so much for watching. Really do appreciate it.

78
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:25,930
And of course, take... Whoa! Whoa! Who's on the phone? Who's calling me right now? Hello?
