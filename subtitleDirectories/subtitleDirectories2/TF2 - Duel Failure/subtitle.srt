00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:11,029
Look, that IP is for Upward. I hope you- welcome to Upward. You're on your way to Upward!

2
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:13,419
And when you get on Upward, join Red.

3
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:17,699
Please be Upward. I have my fingers- no!

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,260
It's Asteroid!

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:26,699
I knew that was the joke, but deep down, I wanted to believe that this wasn't gonna happen.

6
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,170
You wanna do a 1v1 like the good old times?

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,449
You wanna 1v1 me?

8
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:35,829
Yeah, I do. I wanna 1v1 you as Demo Knight.

9
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,829
And this will decide who is the true reign supreme pizza.

10
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:42,869
This decides who eats the most pizza, okay?

11
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:48,420
Whoever wins this 1v1 duel eats the most pizza and we can finally settle it, okay?

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,619
Okay, because we haven't been able to figure that out since, I don't know.

13
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:55,780
We've been in massive arguments about who eats more pizza and I think it's me.

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,850
Did that not even hit you?

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,140
Did I say you could use- did I- did I- did- are you breaking the rules already?

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,579
I said Demo Knight.

17
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:09,140
I'm breaking-

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,780
Just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I didn't even mean to pick that health up.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,859
Just hold- oh, it's so funny!

20
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,510
All right, you ready?

21
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,969
Yeah.

22
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:23,219
So, I challenge you to a duel.

23
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:26,150
Challenge you to a duel. Demo Knight only.

24
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,709
No, like an actual duel. Like, you should accept.

25
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:31,269
I don't- I don't have notifications turned on.

26
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:32,790
So press like J or I or something.

27
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,069
That wasn't even you. I didn't even kill you. I like just-

28
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:37,909
See, that's why I was trying to-

29
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:41,269
It just hit J. Did it work? Oh, yeah, yeah, it worked. See ya.

30
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:44,310
Did I- did I win?

31
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,819
All right, I see you. All right, all right, you know- you know the drill.

32
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,340
Come, uh, not over there. Come over where I am.

33
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:55,859
Okay, I'm coming at you.

34
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,659
Follow- follow your teammates. Watch out for this guy.

35
00:01:59,219 --> 00:01:59,939
Go up here.

36
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,379
Up- okay, perfect spot. There's a Demoman up here, but it's okay.

37
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,699
Hey. All right, so in the meat-

38
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,409
Why are we doing this?

39
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:16,909
Yes.

40
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:18,870
It's gonna-

41
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,069
All right, where are we going? Where are we going instead?

42
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:25,590
Did you get it? Are you out here? Are you coming?

43
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,870
It's that simple, buddy.

44
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,479
All right. There is a, uh-

45
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,080
Okay, your whole team is coming out at the moment. We need to-

46
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,479
Go over to the right.

47
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:38,759
You know, like the right where you can go down and drop to where the health pack is?

48
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,319
Yeah.

49
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:42,520
Go down there. That's where we're gonna do our duel.

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
That's where we're gonna do our back-to-back duel.

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,240
Ten paces, just like-

52
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:57,020
Nice. Nice. You come over here as a soldier?

53
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,500
Yeah. I thought it would be a nice duel to show the duality of man.

54
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,300
Why are you using the- Why are you doing-

55
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,979
The War Update? Remember the War Update?

56
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:07,180
No, no. This- No.

57
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,300
And whoever wins this duel gets the gunboats.

58
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,189
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second. What did you just say?

59
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,509
Whoever wins this gets the gunboats.

60
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:17,669
Whoever wins this gets the item, the gunboats.

61
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:18,069
Yes.

62
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,229
Get me out there quick. Are you serious?

63
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,069
I get gunboats. I gotta get them.

64
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,280
Okay. Please go demo.

65
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,560
I am.

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,819
You haven't changed. You have not changed yet.

67
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:38,580
Come here. I think you can-

68
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,259
Yo, I'm not gonna change. Yeah, I'll show you.

69
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:43,139
I'm getting those gunboats. I want them and I'm getting the pizza.

70
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,740
I'm- Hold on. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

71
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,180
Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.

72
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,330
Do not screw this up.

73
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,969
I'm winning the duel.

74
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,500
You want to see what we do? He thinks he's so funny.

75
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Oh yeah. Laugh it up. Laugh it up.

76
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:04,840
I'll show you how funny it is.

77
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,360
He thinks he's so goddamn funny.

78
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,199
You think you're such a comedian, don't you?

79
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,639
You think you're so funny, don't you?

80
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,199
Rage heavy, rage heavy, rage heavy, rage heavy.

81
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,879
So it's like an old school duel.

82
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,800
Like back in the old times, like get a vintage ambi.

83
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,079
Okay. Where are we doing this?

84
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,680
Where are we going to have like a minute over?

85
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,199
You know what? It's probably over here by like the-

86
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,399
Way, way far behind the spawn.

87
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,560
I'm just going to cloak through and die because I have the kunai.

88
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,000
So just cloak and dagger through.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,459
We're going to go all the way back to this gray gravel door.

90
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:43,100
Gray gravel?

91
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,620
It says old geezer, draft beer.

92
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,379
Oh, that sounds pretty good.

93
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:51,660
And you're not going to do an MLC stealth and shoot me as I walk there.

94
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,699
No, no, no, no, no.

95
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,939
If only you could aim, you would have completed the joke.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,920
It's time for the duel.

97
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,800
Don't do it. I made the stupid mistake.

98
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,839
You don't have to make it again.

99
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:19,540
Okay. So we're going to go back to George Washington times.

100
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:29,480
Okay. That's what happened to George Washington.

101
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,120
Back to back.

102
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,920
We're going to do 10 paces. Okay.

103
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,360
Okay. So right here.

104
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,759
So I would start like right here and you just hit W one, two, three.

105
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,279
So turn, turn, turn around, make sure you're turned.

106
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,069
And now we're going to do 10 paces.

107
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:44,870
Are you ready? Okay.

108
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,550
Yes. Ready.

109
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,129
Yeah. One, two, three.

110
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,829
You can't bullshit a bullshitter, buddy.

111
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,110
I knew you were going to do it.

112
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,430
I just wasn't prepared.

113
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:02,949
You turned around on two or three.

114
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:04,870
We both were at fault on that one.

115
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,879
Were you just waiting the whole time for me to turn?

116
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,379
Yes.

117
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,720
You weren't even honorable at all.

118
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,040
I didn't even do the first turn.

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,360
Can we do a real one?

120
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,920
Yeah. We're going to do.

121
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,199
We're going to do a real one.

122
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,040
Turn. I want to see you turn.

123
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,720
I look, I want to turn.

124
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,560
We're going to turn at the same time.

125
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,500
Okay. I'm going to turn and you're going to shoot me.

126
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,699
We all. Okay. We only have 30 seconds.

127
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,300
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.

128
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,899
I'm going to trust that you're turned as well as I am.

129
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,259
So you're ready? 10 paces.

130
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,860
Hit W 10 times. Ready?

131
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:42,100
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

132
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,939
That was very stressful.

133
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,660
I got to say.

134
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,379
I hit a wall.

135
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,009
Here. You, you go on that side.

136
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:52,970
I'm going to go this way.

137
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,329
Yes. You go that way.

138
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:57,500
So turn. Okay.

139
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,779
I, I'm not turned right now.

140
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,220
I just want to make that very clear.

141
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,060
So you don't think that I'm trying to screw you up.

142
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,420
I just wanted to make sure that.

143
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,620
Okay. Turn, turn.

144
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,259
Okay. We're both turned.

145
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:05,980
Ready? Yeah.

146
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:13,509
Five paces. One, two, three, four, five, son of a bitch.

147
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,199
Son of a bitch.

148
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,579
New dual. No, no, no.

149
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:19,779
New dual, new dual.

150
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,500
Okay. Are you now turned?

151
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,620
I'm, I'm trying to bump into you.

152
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,740
I'm making sure you're there.

153
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,300
Yes.

154
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,939
Okay. You're there.

155
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:26,740
Okay. Yeah.

156
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,100
Okay. Make sure we're like, boom.

157
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:30,420
Count to five, turn.

158
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,779
We're having a real duel.

159
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:32,819
Okay. Count to five.

160
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,259
We're having a real duel this time.

161
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:34,740
Count to five.

162
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,620
Are you ready?

163
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,120
Yes.

164
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,810
Ready? Go.

165
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,209
Yes.

166
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,209
One, two, three, four, five.

167
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,540
Are you shitting me right now?

168
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,540
Are you fucking serious right now?

169
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,660
You put on Uber.

170
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:54,709
Out of all the things you could have done.
