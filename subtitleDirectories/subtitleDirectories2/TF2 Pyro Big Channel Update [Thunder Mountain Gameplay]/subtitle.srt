00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,439
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:22,440
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Pyro with the default flamethrower, the flare gun, and the axe extinguisher.

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,739
None of it's strange, and none of it's vintage. This is a pretty good run, at least in the beginning as the Pyro.

4
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:31,739
I get a lot of good flare gun shots, kill a lot of people, a lot of people are covered in Jarate.

5
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,740
So thank you to the sniper that kept on throwing that on people, because it got me a lot of kills.

6
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,740
But this is not gonna be about really the gameplay, it's a big update video.

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,740
If you saw my Twitter last night, I made this announcement.

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,740
Here comes a big update, I got a huge thing to talk about in this next video.

9
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,979
And I do. What I want to talk about is I want to talk about my upload schedule, and how it's going to change dramatically in the next five days.

10
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:03,159
So if you've been around the channel for a while, you've probably realized I do anywhere from three to five videos a week.

11
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:09,159
Now that depends, it could be Team Fortress, it could be Grand Theft Auto, Binding of Isaac, I do a lot of different stuff.

12
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,159
But what I'm going to do now is I'm going to do ten videos a week.

13
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,159
And the reason why I decided to do this is not only from you guys, I get a lot of PMs, I get a lot of comments telling me,

14
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,159
Jerma, can we get more videos? Can we get longer videos? This is great, you know, four uploads, three uploads is cool,

15
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,159
but it would be awesome if you could upload every day.

16
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:36,159
And I do take that to heart, because I do want to upload every day, and I do want to get content out as best as I can, as fast as I can for you guys.

17
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,590
And I'm going to start to do that. It's the summer, I got a lot of free time, I had free time before,

18
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:48,590
but the days are longer in summer and everyone seems to be around longer, so I'm going to start to do this next week.

19
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,769
And what's going to happen is you're going to see a lot of content.

20
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:56,769
There'll be one video in the morning or mid-afternoon, somewhere around 12 or noon Eastern Time,

21
00:01:56,769 --> 00:02:00,769
and another one out around 7 or 8 PM Eastern Time.

22
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:06,939
So I'm going to try and do two uploads a day, at least Monday and Tuesday, because of course I'm going to try and get for ten.

23
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:14,939
If I did two videos every single day, that would be two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, fourteen videos a week, and that's not what I'm going to do.

24
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:21,939
Oh, and also the livestream. The livestream is not going anywhere, it's still going to be every week, it's going to be Sundays now.

25
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:26,939
No longer is it going to be Saturdays, it's going to be Sundays at 1 PM Eastern Time.

26
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,939
So don't worry, it's not like I'm throwing away the livestream, that'll still be there.

27
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:37,939
And if you were at the last livestream I tried to do, where Team Fortress wouldn't work, I actually can't stream any 3D games right now,

28
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:40,939
because there's a bug between the 670 and XSplit.

29
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:47,939
So until they come out with a new driver update, or until I can figure out a solution, I'm going to have to stream lower end games for a couple weeks,

30
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,939
maybe less, I'm not sure when Nvidia is going to do their update, we will see.

31
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:58,439
So what kind of content can you expect to see in the coming weeks, in the coming future of this channel?

32
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:04,620
Well, I'll tell you. Pretty much I'm going to start doing a lot more live stuff, so everything that you already see on this channel is going to stay.

33
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,789
There's just going to be a hell of a lot more of it.

34
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:14,789
You'll get a live com pretty much every night, depending if it's Team Fortress, Binding of Isaac, GTA, there'll always be a live com on the channel.

35
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:19,789
And of course there'll be my normal post-com stuff as well, I'm not going to change any of that.

36
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:29,349
So the only thing that's actually changing on the channel is more videos will be uploaded on top of what already is uploaded, if that makes any sense.

37
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:35,349
So that's the plan of action, that's my schedule I'm going to try and stick to.

38
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,780
So 10 uploads a week, starting this coming Monday.

39
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,780
I've been toying with the idea for a while to do more uploads and longer videos and stuff like that,

40
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,780
but now it seems like I finally have a plan where I can flesh it all out and actually do it.

41
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,780
So look forward to that, starting on Monday, like I said, and we'll see where it goes, right?

42
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:05,759
So the next thing I want to talk about is the Pyro meet the Dust Lint Goldfish Woodplank thing that's going on in the latest update in Team Fortress.

43
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,759
I don't know what the hell is going on. I read on the forums that if you put on a certain set,

44
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:15,759
I forget what the name of the set is, but if you put a full set on, you can see some more cryptic text,

45
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,759
or you can look at the images a different way or something like that.

46
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:27,000
All I know is this, whenever Valve decides to do these in-game puzzle kind of adventure type things,

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
where you have to figure things out and it's all cryptic and all that, it always means an update is right around the corner.

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Do you guys remember the dove situation in Meet the Medic?

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Remember all the doves that were flying around and all the weird stuff with that?

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And also the rockets, the Groddborz rockets that were landing?

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, you go to the skybox and there's this and that, and it's always about an update.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So I'm smelling the update bug. It's inside of my nostrils right now.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That did not sound good or really nice at all.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,180
But anyways, that's going to wrap up this video, guys.

55
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,180
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

56
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,180
And if you have any more information on this crazy new update, then definitely let us all know.

57
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,180
I'm sure a lot of people in the comments would like to know, and of course I do too.

58
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,180
So yeah, I'll see you guys all next time, and take care everybody.
