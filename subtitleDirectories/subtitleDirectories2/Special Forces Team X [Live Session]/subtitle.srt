1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,500
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some Special Forces Team X.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Kind of a weird name, I know, but bear with me here, just in the first minute or so.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,500
I'm gonna do an introduction. This is a live commentary with my buddy Ari.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Just got this game last week. It just came out last week, actually, just about seven or eight days ago.

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,500
And there's not a whole lot of press on this game, which is very odd,

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,500
because it's made by the same people, Zombie Studios, that created Blacklight.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
If you play Blacklight Retribution, a lot of this is gonna be very familiar to you.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,500
A lot of the gun sounds, a lot of the menu screens are pretty much identical to Blacklight.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
But anyway, this is not a free-to-play game. This is a $15 game on Steam right now.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
And I highly suggest you play it, because it's a third-person shooter, mash-up,

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,500
kind of like TF2 and Gears of War had a baby, and they brought the dogs over from Black Ops.

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Like, that's what you're going to get when you play this game, as weird as that sounds.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,500
But just wanted to give a quick introduction. The live commentary is going to kick in here now.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
So I'll see you guys all next time, and of course, take care, everybody.

15
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:40,469
Alright, I'm gonna sneak up.

16
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,469
I think he's up top.

17
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,469
I don't know where he is.

18
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:44,469
Got him.

19
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:45,469
Nice job.

20
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,420
Can't go down.

21
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,219
Let's get this cap.

22
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,219
Nice.

23
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,390
Beautiful.

24
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,400
Perfect.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,459
Oh, shit.

26
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,459
Yeah, my hard drive failed last week.

27
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:02,459
Really?

28
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,459
My main 1TB hard drive. I lost absolutely everything.

29
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,460
Couldn't recover a single thing from it.

30
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,460
Oh my god!

31
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,360
I lost a shit ton of music.

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
That's the worst.

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
Yeah.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Doggy!

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
Doggy!

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
I love dogs.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,360
The weird thing is, it kind of looks like Otto.

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
I know.

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
You know what?

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
I'll say this right here, right now.

42
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,599
I don't like games where you like...

43
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,599
For instance, if I don't shoot the hell out of that dog, I'm gonna die.

44
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,599
I don't know.

45
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,840
I hate shooting animals in games.

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Oh, airstrike inbound.

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,259
Shit.

48
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,259
What the hell?

49
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,259
That guy's not dead?

50
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:48,259
He got assassinated.

51
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:49,259
He's now.

52
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:50,750
Give me a sec.

53
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,530
It's alright.

54
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,530
Changing mags.

55
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,530
What do we need?

56
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,530
A, getting captured?

57
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,259
Oh, we got all three, huh?

58
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,590
Oh, B.

59
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,729
Let's B it up.

60
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,930
Sorry.

61
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,930
Sorry.

62
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,229
That hard drive just came back from...

63
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:12,229
I had it under warranty, thankfully.

64
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:15,370
That's a good thing, at least.

65
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,669
Oh, beautiful teamwork.

66
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:18,669
Beautiful.

67
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:19,669
That was beautiful.

68
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,669
Can you tell the difference?

69
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,669
You can't tell we're halfway across the world from each other?

70
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,669
I don't know, really.

71
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:27,669
It's like we're in the same room.

72
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:29,669
Yeah, there's a guy right here.

73
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,669
I think he's wrapping around.

74
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,669
Nice job.

75
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:34,620
Beautiful.

76
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,620
One guy at the back as well, behind the truck.

77
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,050
Oh, little dogs.

78
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,219
Oh, I'd have gotten murdered.

79
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,849
How did he...

80
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:42,849
Wow.

81
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:43,849
How the hell did he kill me from back there?

82
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:48,840
That guy just annihilated me.

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,360
Oh, he's dead.

84
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,969
Oh, it's alright.

85
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,969
I'm right here with you.

86
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:59,960
Can I climb over that?

87
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Oh, there's a guy coming over here.

88
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,860
I'll gas him around the side.

89
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,340
He's gonna blow...

90
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,340
Oh, no.

91
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,340
Did I...

92
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,340
No, you need health.

93
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,340
Did I just...

94
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,340
No, I didn't kill him.

95
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,340
Dude, I just blew my own teammate up.

96
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,839
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

97
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,910
I just blew my own teammate straight to hell.

98
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,910
Killed the guy with the minigun.

99
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,910
What?

100
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,180
What?

101
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,930
What the hell was that?

102
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,939
That guy teleport-slided.

103
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:35,060
What a bastard.

104
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,379
A bunch at A.

105
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,379
There's a ton of them at A.

106
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,379
Oh, you're in trouble.

107
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,689
Is that you right there?

108
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:43,689
Oh, I'm coming.

109
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:44,689
I'm coming.

110
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,569
I'm coming.

111
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,110
Oh, lord.

112
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,110
Wow.

113
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,889
I tried to get on you, but...

114
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:54,889
There's a...

115
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:55,889
There's a lot over here.

116
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:57,769
...because you're in action.

117
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:58,769
Oh, give me that headshot.

118
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:00,649
Come on.

119
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:02,649
Oh, what are you using, by the way, guns-wise?

120
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:03,649
Just, I think, the default.

121
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:05,720
Whatever the default was.

122
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,410
Are they still at A?

123
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,410
I see one guy.

124
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,170
Ace.

125
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,519
Boink.

126
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,550
I'm gonna win this one, I think.

127
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,550
Oh, too easy.

128
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,860
Oh, yeah.

129
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,860
Guy on the roof.

130
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,819
Yeah.

131
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:26,819
Yeah.

132
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:27,819
He's over here.

133
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:28,819
Oh, he's got a face.

134
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:29,819
Samuel.

135
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:30,819
There he is.

136
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:33,319
Come on, show yourself again.

137
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,500
Show yourself again.

138
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,930
Come on.

139
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,930
No.

140
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,930
You know you want to pop out of there.

141
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,230
I double dare you.

142
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,230
Oh, this guy.

143
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,230
Oh, a bunch coming.

144
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,230
Bunch coming.

145
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,139
Whoa.

146
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:46,139
I'm, like, doing flips.

147
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,139
Yikes.

148
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,139
There are a couple of A.

149
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,379
There's a couple coming to C.

150
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:50,379
There's a lot coming to C.

151
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:54,660
See, I was too busy, like, aiming at the guy across the map, and two guys came, like,

152
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,430
underneath the stairs today.

153
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,430
It's a pretty open situation.

154
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,430
Like, I quite...

155
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,670
Yeah.

156
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,670
I like how the maps are designed.

157
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,850
There are multiple entry points.

158
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,860
No one can complain about getting camped.

159
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
Yeah, it's definitely fun.

160
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,860
A lot of fun.

161
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
You can get a team of, like...

162
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Anything between, like, two and, like, five people is incredible.

163
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,410
What's the cap?

164
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,410
What's the cap of people playing?

165
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,779
What do you mean?

166
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:19,779
Like, how many people per...

167
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,779
Can you have in each game?

168
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:21,779
Like, 10 out of 10?

169
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:22,779
I think 16.

170
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:23,779
I think 16.

171
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:24,779
Seven.

172
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:25,779
Ah, 16.

173
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:26,779
Okay.

174
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:27,779
Eight.

175
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:28,779
Yeah, eight on each.

176
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,339
God.

177
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,339
Maths.

178
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:32,339
I don't want to go over here.

179
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:35,110
I gave that up a while ago.

180
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,110
Oh, boy.

181
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,250
Dog.

182
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,250
Dog.

183
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,509
Oh, sit down.

184
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:42,509
Oh, no.

185
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:43,509
Oh, shit.

186
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,930
Dude, I just threw that behind my head.

187
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,930
Nice, like, nice toss, bro.

188
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,930
Guy right across.

189
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,930
Right in the corner.

190
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,259
Two of them.

191
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,259
Nice.

192
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:55,500
Careful.

193
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
I think there's still one over there.

194
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Did we win?

195
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Yep.

196
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Hey, look at that.

197
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
The big victory sign will probably be an indication of that.

198
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,589
Nice.

199
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,790
Keep fueling.

200
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,220
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

201
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,220
Rank seven.
