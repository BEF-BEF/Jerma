1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,250
I feel like our team is going to lose, so I'm just going to spend all my time coming after you.

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,250
That's okay.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,250
Oh, I can see you. I just saw you.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,250
I don't see you.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,250
Hey, what is going on, everybody?

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,250
Jerma here with a Tribes Ascent gameplay commentary, and this is going to be a live commentary.

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,250
This was taken from Ster's livestream last night.

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,619
We did this at like, God, maybe 3 or 4 in the morning is when this all actually ended.

9
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,619
So it went pretty late. It was very fun.

10
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:45,920
And I wanted to cut up the last maybe 15, 20 minutes of the stream, and that is what you're watching right now.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,420
And again, playing with Ster.

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:56,420
His link will be in the description as well as MLC Stealth, but you guys already know Stealth, so I don't have to do an introduction for Stealth.

13
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,420
You probably know who Ster is too. What am I talking about?

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,420
But yeah, they will be in the description. Go check them out. They are really cool dudes.

15
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:09,420
But this video, this is a not so much a gameplay video as it is a me running from my life video,

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,420
because Ster is really good at this game and I'm not so good.

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,420
So it's me pretty much just running away from Ster and him trying to melee me to death.

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,420
So it's pretty entertaining.

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,420
But I'll let the live commentary kick in, guys, now.

20
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,420
So I will see you all next time.

21
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,420
Take care, everybody.

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,719
I'll do the double team.

23
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,019
I'll just smash you in the face.

24
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:35,780
Where are you?

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,530
I gotta shoot you. You have a YouTube channel.

26
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:46,659
Oh, I keep missing this guy.

27
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:49,659
Now he's dead.

28
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,659
Where are you at, Shazbot?

29
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,030
Shazbot?

30
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,620
Shazbot, Shazbot, Shazbot.

31
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,620
No, I just heard noise. It was this guy.

32
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,069
It was this slippery snake.

33
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:06,640
Oh.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,639
I missed so much with this gun tonight. Oh my god.

35
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,520
I keep getting scared that you are right here somewhere.

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,699
For one of these times, I will be.

37
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:19,319
Help that this guy is teleporting.

38
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,930
Mike, go over there. I dare you. You're gonna get hit by that grenade.

39
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,490
Go over there.

40
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,490
Like where I just threw a grenade.

41
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,370
There's a lot of over-there's. I don't know where you guys are going.

42
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,669
I'm very, very, very confused.

43
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,550
Undo it.

44
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,500
Unconfuse yourself.

45
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,889
Whoa, whoa, what was that?

46
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:48,020
Die!

47
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,020
Were you just having a sniper rifle at me?

48
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,020
Oh, get blue plate mailed. Whatever it's called.

49
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,330
Oh, a knife.

50
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,330
Is this like medieval times?

51
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,330
Plate mail.

52
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,330
Blue plate special mail.

53
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,949
It's very special. My blacksmith made it this morning.

54
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:13,500
Oh, come on.

55
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,389
Oh yeah, eat grenade.

56
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:22,389
Maybe if I'm like really unpredictable.

57
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,389
I can't like be predicted.

58
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:26,389
Oh, is that the definition of that?

59
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:28,389
I'm over here.

60
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,389
If I'm like really unpredictable, I can't be predicted.

61
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:34,280
Come on. Come here.

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,280
No, god damn it.

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,620
Oh.

64
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,289
Humiliation.

65
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:47,289
Oh, you are so lucky that

66
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:49,289
things didn't go my way.

67
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:51,289
This guy.

68
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:53,289
You're gonna walk right into that man and it's gonna be your...

69
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:55,979
your demise.

70
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:57,979
How did that hit me? I don't understand.

71
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,979
So is there an item in this game that when you hit somebody

72
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,979
it plays like music?

73
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,979
What?

74
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,979
Seriously, I just got hit by a grenade and it was like

75
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:09,979
I swear.

76
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:11,979
I promise.

77
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:17,110
No, I refuse.

78
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,420
No. No, this cannot happen again.

79
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,740
Not a second time.

80
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,069
Grenade.

81
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:28,069
Fine. Fine. You die a normal death.

82
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,819
Oh god.

83
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,819
I got an assist.

84
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:39,689
I got destroyed.

85
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:42,060
I got the assist. What do you know?

86
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,060
There is a blacksmith. See, there's the anvil right there.

87
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,560
See it?

88
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
What's this like a rhino? Oh, it's a tank.

89
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,509
I thought that was an animal.

90
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,230
What is this guy doing?

91
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,009
I want to ride the rhino.

92
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:08,300
It'll be fun.

93
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,459
I want a vehicle.

94
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,459
Then I'll be the coolest guy in school.

95
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,459
There's like circles on the ground.

96
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,459
And on the thing on the circle.

97
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:25,370
Hey, vehicle.

98
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,370
Alright, I'm going to go look for it right now.

99
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,019
Hope you weren't lying to me.

100
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:40,040
I have to kill that guy.

101
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,410
Oh no.

102
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,139
It's MLC.

103
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,509
How do you pronounce that?

104
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,509
MLC. What are you talking about?

105
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:54,899
They're just letters.

106
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:56,899
They're just letters.

107
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,899
No, it's actually milk.

108
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,779
Germa, why do you have so many people like AFK back here?

109
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,779
Because this team is fun.

110
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,250
So, where's that Germa guy?

111
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,250
I see him. He's way on the other side of the map though.

112
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,250
He is going to get punched.

113
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,250
Wall hacks.

114
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,129
Let's see where I am.

115
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:23,129
Moto crossing for extra points.

116
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,129
Is that true? Alright.

117
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:27,129
That's not a thing, is it?

118
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:29,819
We're going to catch you.

119
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,819
Oh, I got you.

120
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:33,819
I got you.

121
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,819
Your teammate just walked by and was like

122
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,819
He wanted nothing to do with that.

123
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,819
Yeah, why? That was weird.

124
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,819
Like, oh, you two can have your fun. Bye.

125
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,819
Yeah, you're just punching each other.

126
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:46,569
They really need a weapon in this game.

127
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:48,569
That's like the sandwich for Heavy.

128
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:50,569
Where you can just walk around and everyone will understand you're stupid.

129
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:54,569
Wait, what?

130
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:57,129
He just walked...

131
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:05,129
Oh no, there he is again.

132
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:07,129
I'm shooting behind me.

133
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:10,139
I can't believe I missed.

134
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,139
Some brute killed me.

135
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,139
Some brutish guy killed me.

136
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:16,139
Oh, hi.

137
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,139
Okay, so where's your Germa?

138
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,139
Here's some more like

139
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,139
noise grenades.

140
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,139
I just ranked up.

141
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:26,139
You're doing good, right?

142
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:28,139
Seriously, listen.

143
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,139
I'm like, listen, you guys can't even hear it.

144
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,139
I threw two grenades at you, Germa.

145
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,139
See, I'm going to make a video

146
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,139
of this and I'm going to turn that up

147
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,139
so everyone can hear it.

148
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:40,139
I want people to know that that's music plays.

149
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,139
It's like elevator music.

150
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,139
When you do what?

151
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:46,139
But by that noise grenade.

152
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,139
Impact Nitron?

153
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,139
It's like an ear ringing noise.

154
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,139
Every time I...

155
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,139
Or maybe you're talking about fractals because that's

156
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:57,339
totally a disco party.

157
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,339
Fractals.

158
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:02,089
So this one doesn't go to 300.

159
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:04,089
It depends on the amount of points there actually are.

160
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,089
Sorry.

161
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:08,089
How many times am I going to have to hit you?

162
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,089
What is no joy?

163
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,259
When you killed someone who was on a streak.

164
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,259
Oh, cool.

165
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,399
I don't know.

166
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,819
Wait, where'd you just go?

167
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,819
No, I'm not falling for this one.

168
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,819
Who are you talking to?

169
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:29,139
You're a freaking infiltrator.

170
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:31,899
Where's your health?

171
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:33,899
How'd you get the health back?

172
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,759
I don't know.

173
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,759
I'm running. I'm getting out of here.

174
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,759
The slide.

175
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,450
You're joking. You can't run.

176
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,450
Over here.

177
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,259
Get away from me.

178
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:50,259
Grenades.

179
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:53,460
I'm coming in from the top.

180
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,019
Oh my god.

181
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:58,019
It said I suicided.

182
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,899
Hold on.

183
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,899
Did I throw the grenade at you and then walk over

184
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:04,899
on my own grenade? I think that's really what happened.

185
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:07,080
What a smart person I am.

186
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,429
Hey.

187
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:13,429
We did it.

188
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:15,860
Hey, good game. Shazbot, everyone.

189
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,870
No, I was 12 and 14.

190
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,870
My goodness.

191
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,460
I'm 18 and 11.

192
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,629
Unlock's available.

193
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:30,789
What am I unlocking?

194
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:33,460
Should I unlock

195
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,220
the doombringer or the

196
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,289
infiltrator?

197
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,460
You should get a weapon for a class you already have.

198
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,700
Oh, but it's so...

199
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Don't get doombringer. Don't do it.

200
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,940
Oh, okay. Fine.

201
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,940
Unless you like standing around doing

202
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,940
nothing.

203
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,940
Well, I am pretty much a slug in this game.

204
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,940
You should probably go doombringer then.

205
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,500
You get like a minigun.
