1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,400
No, please!

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:16,039
Why did I do like a spin? Why did I just like spin around like a ballerina? Dude, that was ridiculous.

3
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:33,100
Do the way to travel around and not get killed at least by I mean, how many scouts do they have? One, two, three,

4
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:35,500
get electrocuted.

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Please let me kill somebody with the electrocution.

6
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,770
That was so dumb.

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:04,379
You want to get zapped? You want to get zapped? You want to get, you want to get zapped?

8
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,840
Come on, get over here.

9
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:24,659
I still haven't even described the whole point of this video and I can't unless, unless I can do it.

10
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:36,129
Zap. Come on. Come on. Come on. Somebody, come on. Walk in this door. Come on. Yes!

11
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:43,760
I did it. I did it. I've never done that before. I've never done that before.

12
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,159
That's the first time I've ever taunt killed in my life.

13
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,340
So the point of this video is the guitar smasher. Zap.

14
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,019
So did they change, if I hit a player, does it take the, I was supposed to say money.

15
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:04,269
Does it take the money if you zap somebody? Or does it not take the money?

16
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:10,180
I mean it take, I mean it does make some sense. It takes money to use electricity, electricity costs a lot of money.

17
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:19,530
And why is there always people in here? Go, go away. I'm trying to like taunt kill people. Oh, no. Oh, no.

18
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:26,340
No, look at his tiny legs. Why does he have like abnormally small legs?

19
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,150
He's got like chicken legs. Are you doing the same thing I'm doing, sir?

20
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:39,580
What, are we both trying to do the same thing here? With your bubblegum beard and your

21
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:46,710
candy cane head? All right, me and Mr. Bubblegum are gonna try to taunt kill somebody. I'm just gonna go for it.

22
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:52,069
My god, no, no, no, that's mine. That's my taunt kill. No, let me have it.

23
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:59,939
If you don't move in 115 seconds, you will be moved to spectate. Oh my god.

24
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:07,300
It's like yelling at me for like camping. Well, all right, I'll just zap the next person that comes up here.

25
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:14,580
I'm gonna zap the shit out of the person that walks around this corner. Whoever it is, your hair is gonna stand on end.

26
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,430
I don't want to get like banned from this server because I'm not moving.

27
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:31,430
Who wants to get zaped? Does somebody on this other team want to get zaped? Who wants to get friggin' zaped?

28
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:34,389
Oh, doing some zapping here.

29
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:42,969
He's running. No, I don't want to shoot him. Hi, my name is Sherba. I have a guitar. Do you like guitars?

30
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,240
Only allowed to zap people or taunt kill them like this guy.

31
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,439
How, what?

32
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,770
How did, man, I could have killed him and you had to just shoot him with a direct hit.

33
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:09,639
Not cool, man. That is what we call not cool. Zap. Get zapped.

34
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:20,389
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Where is he? Where is he? Where? Wow. Wow, I almost had him.

35
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,389
He almost stood on top of that. No.

36
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,790
What? Seriously, guys?

37
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:35,779
You're a bastard, Jon Snow. You're a bastard. I'm not a bastard. Don't call me a bastard.

38
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:42,050
I'll call you a bastard and I'll rip out your guts. Am I even playing the game anymore?

39
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,060
You lost your century too. That sucks. That really sucks.

40
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,360
There's a, the sniper knows exactly where I am right now. This is gonna be really difficult.

41
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,420
Hello?

42
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,420
80, 80, 80, 80.

43
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,259
Remember guys, when in doubt, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, and you'll be okay. At least like five out of ten times

44
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,459
it works. You know what? I need to build, I'm building a dispenser up here.

45
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:23,699
Dispenser going up. What? Easy. I know I'm breaking the stipulation rules right now,

46
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:30,980
but you know what? I don't give a shit. I can't do anything right now, so I might as well do something.

47
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,730
So I'm gonna build a level three dispenser. This is gonna be my base of operations, okay?

48
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,040
I'm always gonna fall back to here because no one's gonna, no one's gonna come up here on blue team.

49
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,439
Why would they ever come up here to look over here? The only way they'll ever know is if I'm like

50
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:52,930
glowing with the thing behind me, the cord. Okay, that sniper across, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

51
00:05:52,930 --> 00:06:00,850
wait, wait. He knows. That same sniper knows there's a dispenser up here now. Yeah, he knows I'm in

52
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:06,290
here. Did you see him? He's up. Yeah, screw you. You're not getting any points. I'll keep preparing

53
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:28,829
it. Yeah, cool. Come on, shoot it again. Shoot it again. He's just wasting his time. That sniper's

54
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:40,100
dead. That sniper is dead. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna, hey, hey, what's, oh my fucking god. Yeah, I left,

55
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:47,100
you know, whatever. You say what you want. I left. Couldn't take it anymore, but what I can take

56
00:06:47,100 --> 00:07:02,699
is this guy. Hello? Hello? We have the same hat. Oh my god, that was so close. Oh, that was like two

57
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:10,850
pixels off. How is a boy supposed to get a taunt kill like this? You're just gonna get yourself

58
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:18,500
killed. See, you got headshot. Spy, come on. Just lock him in. He's locked in. He's locked in. He's

59
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:28,850
locked in. He's locked in. Yes. He couldn't move. He was locked in there. Two. That makes two taunt

60
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:37,490
kills. Let's go. Yikes. Crit. I just saved your life, Spy. I just saved your life. Holy shit.

61
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:56,449
No. Aha. Protecting the teleporter. I am the protector. You will never get this teleporter,

62
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:03,300
for I, I just want to, I just want to turn somebody into a fucking turkey. I just want to,

63
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:10,990
I want to turkey somebody. You know what? You're on this corner. Hold on. I can get this entry.

64
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:18,959
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He just picked it up. What? What the fuck was that? What the,

65
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:31,980
just, just. So I just realized something. The short circuit does not have a taunt.

66
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:38,059
Why is that? Not even like the default just pistol taunt? Like that's weird. Is that one of the only

67
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,250
items in this whole game that does not have a taunt? That's pretty crazy if that's true.

68
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:52,179
Demoman, come around the corner. Here we go. Here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, here's the third

69
00:08:52,179 --> 00:09:01,629
taunt kill. Fuck you, man. Come on. That is just so, that is just everything wrong with that.
