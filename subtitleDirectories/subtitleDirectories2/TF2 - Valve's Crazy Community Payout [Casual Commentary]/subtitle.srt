00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,719
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as that.

2
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:24,140
So, in this video I want to talk about a couple of things, as we usually do in these casual commentaries.

3
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:32,439
Sometimes I do stuff like that and I lose track of what time I'm in and what is the area of the world I'm in, so that would just happen right there.

4
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:44,759
Anyways, fucking let's go, get it together. This video is gonna talk about my server. First of all, I'll give you a little story about my server.

5
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,759
Those of you that have been trying to play on it the last few days, the last week, it's actually been like two weeks. I don't know, who am I kidding?

6
00:00:50,759 --> 00:01:03,130
Here's a story. So, I forgot to pay the bill on my TF2 server. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, I had a TF2 Team Fortress 2 server that I had there was no crit.

7
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:09,129
There were no ads or anything on it. It was just there for you guys to play on if you wanted to play some games on it, make a few friends.

8
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:13,129
I know there was a community behind it, and that's awesome that I would go there from time to time.

9
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:20,129
You've seen a lot of videos on this channel of me in the server doing weird, crazy shit, and that's how I like it. That's how I want to keep it.

10
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:26,129
I didn't pay the bill on time, and they deleted the server because I didn't pay it, which, whatever, that's fine.

11
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:34,129
I have now a new server. It's a brand new IP. The IP that you currently had, get it out of your memory, delete it from your brain.

12
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:38,129
I'm going to change it in all the places where it says where my IP is for the server.

13
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:45,299
It's currently getting up and running right now by my server administrator, so I don't know if it's going to be there right now.

14
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,299
In the description of this video, there's going to be the IP.

15
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:58,480
If you try it, it might not be up and running at this particular moment right now, but that's going to be the IP.

16
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,480
If you can't find it in the server browser or if it just doesn't work, you can't connect to it, then just give it a couple days.

17
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:11,479
There's probably going to be some lag issues because on new servers, there's always lag for the first couple of weeks when the server kind of gets its bearings.

18
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,479
So bear with me for a little bit while I get that back up and running.

19
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,479
And if you had no idea that I had a TF2 server, and you do now, so we're going to move on from that.

20
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,479
I just wanted to give you guys a little update on how that was coming if you were curious.

21
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:27,479
And the next thing I want to talk about is about the Team Fortress community.

22
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:33,479
It's about the Valve community, something ridiculous that was just reported on this last week on money.

23
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:44,479
If you don't know, Valve just recently in the first week of January paid out $400,000 to its various content creators.

24
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,479
I'm not talking about Valve employees.

25
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,479
We're not talking about like Bob from accounting.

26
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,479
We're talking about people that make maps, that make custom weapons for the Steam Workshop.

27
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:02,659
Really anybody that has made anything that's been implemented into either Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2 just got a pretty big paycheck.

28
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:04,659
And this is incredibly encouraging to me.

29
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:11,659
This is like the best, awesome, most unbelievable news because it shows that you can actually make a couple bucks on the side.

30
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:19,830
I mean, we've talked about this before in previous videos where I've said I love when Valve does this community-driven stuff.

31
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,830
People can get involved in their favorite games.

32
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,830
If they're an artist or if they're a map maker or if they're a designer, they can actually do this on the side.

33
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,830
They don't have to work for some company.

34
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,830
They can actually put time and effort into their favorite thing, the thing that they're passionate about, and make some money.

35
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:40,330
And not just some money, $400,000 in a week, the first week of January of 2014.

36
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,939
Are you shitting me? That's ridiculous.

37
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:49,370
Almost half a million dollars has been paid out to these people in one week.

38
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,370
This is not over 10 years.

39
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,370
This is not since the Steam Workshop has been implemented.

40
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,370
This is in the first goddamn week of 2014, 400 grand.

41
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,539
Can you imagine? Imagine this, guys.

42
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:05,849
Imagine in a few months what that number potentially will be.

43
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,849
Imagine in a few more months after that what that number potentially will be.

44
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:17,279
I can't even make the math. I can't even do the calculations in my brain because, oh my God, it's probably going to be millions of fucking dollars.

45
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:25,709
And I really, truly hope, guys, that these numbers that came up from Valve will show the companies that don't want to open up their games from modding.

46
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,709
Don't want to open up their games to their communities.

47
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:32,709
Don't want to show, hey, there's actually talented people in our community.

48
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:39,949
There's actually people that play our games that are incredibly imaginative and can create things and know what they're doing when it comes to design.

49
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:50,319
Like, I hope it opens up because we just keep getting proven time and time again that modders and community members are what push a game into a longer lifespan.

50
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:59,800
And rewarding those people, rewarding those that do these things, is just great for the overall life essence of the game.

51
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
It just is.

52
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:09,980
And these companies that close their doors to this type of stuff, you know, the two CEOs, the three guys that know the secret recipe to Coca-Cola,

53
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,600
who gives a shit?

54
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Like, who doesn't know how to make Coca-Cola?

55
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Pepsi does.

56
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Sam's Choice does.

57
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
The dollar store does.

58
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Do you really have to keep Coca-Cola as a secret?

59
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Open up your fucking business to people and people will like you more.

60
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:35,399
The more that you put yourself out there and the more that you tell people and you show people that you're willing to accept what they're willing to do for you, the better you're going to be.

61
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,829
So give me the fucking secret recipe for Coca-Cola.

62
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:40,579
That's the end of the video.

63
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:42,819
I want the secret recipe for Coca-Cola.

64
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:44,259
Give me it!

65
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:45,560
Give me the secret recipe!
