00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:11,449
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here. Welcome to Cactus Canyon. This is the second of the two

2
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:16,410
new maps. I just made myself very well known to the snipers over here, so I might as well try to

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,460
just debate out a headshot. And he's using the Sydney Sleeper. I could have seen that by looking

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,780
down at the left of my screen, but you know, sometimes you just don't pay attention, and that's

5
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,060
exactly what happened. But anyways, I'll give you my thoughts on the map. I like this map a lot,

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,000
because it reminds me of Frontier, and I don't know why, but I like Frontier a lot. I like, like,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,380
the inclines and the declines. It adds for some cool dynamics, but hopefully I don't get killed

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,299
again here. Let's get behind this medic, and then this guy too. He doesn't know. He doesn't know. He

9
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,320
doesn't know. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy. Don't throw those

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,049
in here. There's somebody in here. I'm trying to use the bathroom. What is going on with that door?

11
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:05,099
That door is going, like, insane right now. I'm also using this thing.

12
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:16,019
Pyro. Pyro. What do I go for here first? This guy, and then this guy, and then this guy too.

13
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:26,730
No. No. Yes. No. Yes. No. Absolutely no. Make my way back around. Let's disguise as a spy.

14
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,349
Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. See if we can get that sentry

15
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:38,920
before he gets it built to level three, and I will be able to. It's okay. It's okay. One hit.

16
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:50,069
Nice shot. Excellent job. Excellent job, team. You deserve every reward. Hmm. They're really far. I

17
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:59,000
don't know. How are we at their spawn right now? This doesn't make any sense. Come here. The card

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,420
is all the way up here, and somehow we're at their spawn. That's odd. Um, okay. Well, just get. Watch

19
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:15,479
out. Watch out for the Pyro. Uh, this is not good. I'm gonna go. I'm going on blue. We're gonna do the

20
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,300
switch right now. I can't. I can't make the switch. I'm dead here for sure.

21
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:36,620
Hello, everyone. It's me, the Spy. Today I'm going to be using the Kunai, the Le ChargÃ©,

22
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:44,439
and of course my Sapper that I undoubtedly love to use. As you see here, I get covered in Gerate.

23
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:50,520
It's too bad because the Sniper is an asshole. He won't kill me, though. I will bait him into

24
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,280
this room where I will keep baiting him around the corner. He will fall down, and I will shoot

25
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:09,060
him. Just watch. Keep your eyes peeled. Keep your eyes peeled. Hold on. Oh, there he is. I found him.

26
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,659
I told you he would come down eventually, and I would kill him, but I didn't. That was part of

27
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:18,629
the plan, too. This next part of the plan is to follow the Sniper up the stairs and step him in

28
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:34,659
his bed. See? Watch this. Shit. Whoa. Too much going on there. Too much going on there. I wonder

29
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:41,780
if I'm being healed by this guy. How obvious of a spy am I? Hi, I'm just being healed by my medic.

30
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:50,699
Hope nobody heard that. Hope nobody heard that. Hope nobody heard that. Whoa.

31
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,919
Thanks, man. Really just saved my ass right there, Pyro. Whoever knocked me in the air.

32
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:15,289
I thought I was dead, but I just wasn't. Hey, Scout. Oh, just out of reach. Still might be able

33
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:23,699
to get him. Come on. I gotta land that. I gotta start landing those with the medic. What am I

34
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:32,379
doing? What's happening? What happened? I got him. Okay. A very weird chain of events is happening

35
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:43,500
right now and allowing me to be a moron and play spy correctly somehow, some way. Come here. I knew

36
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:56,279
you were gonna do that. I knew you were gonna do that. And the series of unfortunate things

37
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,660
ends up getting me knocked into the... If that's not like a... That was like scripted,

38
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:10,620
what just happened right there. You are... Oh, no. Look out. Look out. Look out.

39
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:18,139
Look at me. I'm standing on your stickies. I'm a spy. You might as well blow it up,

40
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:27,110
but blow up the stickies. Hey, look. Hey, I'm... There you go. This fall is gonna kill me.

41
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:36,779
In this next clip, I'm going to show you how to properly take out a sentry. A lot of spies

42
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:43,129
don't know exactly how to do it, and it gets them in a lot of trouble. As you see, I used my dead

43
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:49,500
ringer to make that soldier think I was dead. But in actuality, I'm actually still alive.

44
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,980
Come up around these stairs. There should be a health pack up here in this room. If you see

45
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:01,339
another spy, give him a nod and go on your way. So taking out your sapper, move to the sentry in

46
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:12,819
question and stab it. No, wait, that's not right. This choke right here seriously rivals some of

47
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:17,860
the craziest chokes in the game. There's only one spot that people can come through, and it's right

48
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:26,949
here. I just bumped into a spy, I think, somewhere. But man, this choke is insane. They have to come

49
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:35,720
through this door. How do we do that? I'm gonna have to just barrel my way through everybody.

50
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:42,899
I can't even do that. I seriously can't do that. I need to wait till they push out a little more

51
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:49,930
and just use the revolver. I wonder if I can, like... See, this is a good time to put on the...

52
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:57,750
This guy just, like, dancing over in the corner by himself. Well, we're gonna go for it. Hopefully

53
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:10,709
this pyro doesn't light me. And I'm coming in P. Nope, that ain't happening. Make our way back again.

54
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:21,129
And... Rinse, repeat. Can we do it? And here we go. Nobody pay attention to me. Oh, I'm doing...

55
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay, there's a lot going on here. This is gonna be tough. Oh, you bumped him right into me. Oh,

56
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:47,209
come on. Oh god, no! He got in the way! Get him out of here. You give me that uber? You give me

57
00:07:47,209 --> 00:08:05,610
that uber and things are gonna change. Oh, jeez! Oh, random crits. Oh, boy. Oh, dear. Oh, that was

58
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:11,670
a... That was a lot of other teammates, team members, or whatever that didn't make it out.

59
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:24,360
There's a... Where's this... Oh, it's all over here. That guy got telepracked. Oh, dear.

60
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:34,360
Let's get the little trap. That's not a very good trap. That was a great trap, Jerma. Very good.

61
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,100
That was a good trap. Did I do good? Mommy, look at my, like, finger painting I just made.

62
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:50,330
Oh, I'm so bad at putting traps down in the same spot. 30 seconds. 30 seconds. We can do this.

63
00:08:52,120 --> 00:09:03,700
Dear, that's a lot of people. This map. This map. Oh, I need heals. Oh, dear.

64
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:15,539
All right, where's my weapon? Five seconds. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not much longer. Not

65
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:23,559
much longer. We did it. No, it's over time. We didn't do it yet. Now we did it, right? Yeah,

66
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:33,610
we did. You can't escape me, Scout. You can't escape me. Well, that might wrap it up, but I do

67
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,679
want to say, if you do want to see more just general kind of live comms, like lightly edited

68
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:44,100
live comms, I have five dominations, right? That's impossible. That is literally it. Look at all our

69
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,620
dominations. My God.
