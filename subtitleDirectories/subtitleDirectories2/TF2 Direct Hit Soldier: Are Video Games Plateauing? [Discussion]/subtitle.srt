00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,810
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with kind of a different commentary today. This is gonna be over

2
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,890
I'm not really sure what gameplay is gonna be in the background. I'm actually talking into a black screen right now

3
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,269
So I'm not really sure what's gonna be there, but there will be a gameplay there whatever loadout

4
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:26,629
I'm using whatever game it happens to be that's what I'm doing

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,129
But this video is gonna talk about something that I've been thinking about lately and it's a discussion video

6
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:35,030
So please chime in in the comment section if you have anything to add to this

7
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:37,189
And it's about the gaming industry

8
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,390
Plateauing and how graphics engines and gaming in general is kind of at that area

9
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:46,189
Where there's not a whole lot else left to do

10
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:53,170
There's not a whole lot else left to innovate on and we're gonna talk about some points some counterpoints as well to argue this fact

11
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,670
I'm gonna play devil's advocate to myself in a small regard

12
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,229
But first of all, let's let's bring up the fact that gaming let's talk about graphics engines first

13
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:08,670
So the graphics engines of yesteryear going back to like the Super Nintendo and regular Nintendo or even if you keep going back to

14
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,989
Atari we'll say I guess we'll start at Atari Atari. So you had Atari very very basic graphics engine

15
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:16,790
I don't know if you can even call it that either

16
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,670
There's like two blips on a screen for most of the Atari games and then you went from Atari to regular Nintendo

17
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,750
Regular Nintendo had 8-bit graphics and the change from the Atari to the NES was huge

18
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,829
It was astronomical people have never seen anything like that before ever in their entire lives

19
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,189
And the same can be said from the NES to the Super Nintendo

20
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,159
the Super Nintendo was miles ahead in technology same thing for the Sega Genesis and

21
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,239
It seems that we can keep going from generation to generation here

22
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:52,239
You move on to the Nintendo 64 you move on to like Sega CD and you got the Dreamcast

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,280
PlayStation 1 PlayStation 2 and then ps3 everything every generational jump has been an

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
astronomical change until

25
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,280
you got to the ps3 and the

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,090
360 when these two systems were being talked about when the 360 of 360 came out first when the 360 showed its first

27
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:16,169
Screenshots and showed its first gameplay demos and stuff. I I was kind of let down

28
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,210
Maybe that's because I'm a child of the 80s and I saw this whole revolution of video games

29
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:27,409
But the Xbox to the Xbox 360 there was a it was a jump, but it was such a tiny jump

30
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:32,490
It was like a little dude jumping over like a friggin candlestick. What's the guy's name? Come on?

31
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:32,930
Come on

32
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,969
What's the guy's name? Jack be meant Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack jumped over the Xbox to the Xbox 360

33
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,520
That's how I felt textures looked kind of the same modeling looked kind of the same

34
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,840
It was in the same realm of graphics quality as the regular Xbox now that they're talking about the

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Xbox 720 and the ps4

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,120
Are we gonna see a huge jump because guys you got to remember it's been like 10 years

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,560
Since we've seen anything really really innovatively huge like graphics engine wise in the last 10 years

38
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:14,840
That's a long time especially considering the fact that from the Atari to the Nintendo 64

39
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,159
Was like holy crap

40
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:24,939
You're like blowing up a nuclear bomb in changes to graphics quality and moving on to the next point here about not just the graphics

41
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:31,020
Quality games in general are starting to plateau. We're starting to see the same storylines rehash themselves

42
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,340
We're starting to see way too huge sequel numbers

43
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,620
What are we on Final Fantasy 75 now?

44
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:43,780
Like how far things gonna go before we see a really big innovation change in this industry, and I think it's happening

45
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,659
I really think it's happening guys at a much smaller level

46
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:52,860
I think it's happening at the indie level at the independent level because all these huge studios

47
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,460
They don't need to innovate anymore. They have all their franchises

48
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,539
They have all their ideas and they have all their things locked down

49
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:06,340
But it's the little developers the little independent developers that have to strive to create amazing content

50
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,620
Otherwise, they're gonna die. They're gonna die off

51
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:11,560
I mean how is Joe Schmoe gonna be able to make a

52
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,519
Indie platformer or an indie shooting game in his living room and be able to compete with Call of Duty or Battlefield

53
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,759
It's just impossible unless what you're making is a crazy cool new idea

54
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:30,600
And that's one of the reasons why I love Edmund McMillan so much is because he's an independent developer that just does such wacky stuff

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,079
He's always creating these new crazy things

56
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,879
We got the binding of Isaac from him Super Meat Boy Gish and he's working on a new title right now called

57
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,120
Mugenics which I cannot friggin wait for that game to come out guys because it's gonna be so cool

58
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,879
It's gonna be insane. I can't wait to play it but enough of smoking this guy's ass smoke what smoking this guy's ass

59
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,399
What am I gonna roll up his ass and smoke it? What am I talking about?

60
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,360
Tooting his horn is what I meant to say

61
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,060
Anyways

62
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
Without stuff like that without people like

63
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,379
Independent developers like Edmund McMillan the industry really might plateau it really might start to stagnant

64
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:14,470
But that's where you guys come in I'd love to hear what you have to say about this topic put it in the comment

65
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:22,310
Section below get a discussion going let's talk about the industry plateauing and if indie games can save us all I guess

66
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,990
That's that's the real meat potatoes point of this entire video. So thank you everybody so much for watching

67
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,910
That's gonna wrap it up here whatever game. I happen to be playing. I hope I won

68
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,069
I don't know who I the gameplay is not recorded yet

69
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:39,670
But I wanted to get this down and wanted to get this commentary done because I wanted to talk about it really badly

70
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:45,189
So well, thank you again everyone for watching. I'll see you all soon. And of course, take care everybody
