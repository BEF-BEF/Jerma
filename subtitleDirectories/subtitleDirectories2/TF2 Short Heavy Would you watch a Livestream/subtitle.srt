00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:13,300
Hey, what's going on everybody? It's Jerma here with a quick quick video. I just want to go over a couple of things.

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,300
This is a very very small gameplay of a heavy domination on Yukon, I believe this map is.

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,300
I get double ubered from a critscreek and an uber charge and I kill like 15 people.

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,300
It's pretty destructive and I thought you guys might want to see it. Here we go.

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:56,299
Grgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgr

6
00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:10,859
the

7
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:13,260
and just vote, it says only three or four questions.

8
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,819
So just please, if you guys could do that,

9
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:15,980
it would be awesome.

10
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,599
And hopefully, in the next couple weeks here,

11
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,060
I start to figure out how to livestream

12
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,739
and I'm hoping I can do it.

13
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:23,560
I'm hoping it'll really work out.

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,700
I don't really care if like 15 people watch it,

15
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,859
but as long as I know that some people will watch it,

16
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,180
I will do it.

17
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,659
So here's to hoping in the next few weeks

18
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,099
I get that to work.

19
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:35,500
The end of this gameplay, this very, very quick gameplay,

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,140
is actually kind of funny because I've run right

21
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,560
into an Uber while I have the crit screen on

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,920
and I kind of freak out and I just jump off the cliff

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,340
and get myself killed.

24
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,359
So I'm sure you guys will think it's pretty funny.

25
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,400
We probably could have done another crazy, insane domination

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,239
if we had just not had to run into that Uber.

27
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,640
But whatever, you know, stuff happens as they say.

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,560
Anyways, second little announcement I wanna make

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,120
is I'm gonna be on Pixel Enemy in the next couple of days,

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,900
probably either tomorrow or Tuesday.

31
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,159
I'm not really sure when they're gonna put my video up.

32
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,760
It's a Milkman Scout gameplay on Badlands,

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,039
King of the Hill Badlands.

34
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,199
So hopefully you guys check that out.

35
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,080
I'll make a Bolton when it comes out.

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,740
That's about it for today, guys.

37
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,800
Just wanted to put this out there to make sure you guys

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,719
knew about some of the things I'm working on,

39
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,199
some of the things I'm doing.

40
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,919
Thank you all so much for watching

41
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,460
and I'll see you all next time.

42
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,520
Take care, everybody.
