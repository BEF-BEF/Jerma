00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,500
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,579
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Demoman, using the Sticky Bomb Launcher, of course,

3
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:27,300
the half Zatoichi and the lock and load, which has become my default Demoman setup ever since

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,780
I got the strange lock and load a few days ago. Now this video, I want to really bring

5
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,780
up something very, very important about the Demoman. I want to give you a couple of tips,

6
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,859
couple of strategies to use, because I've never done a Demoman tip video. I think I

7
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:46,939
said one or two things, maybe a long time ago about it. But I want to give you some

8
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:52,200
real strategies, at least with the Sticky Launcher. Because with the lock and load and

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,219
with the default grenade launcher, it's kind of spam. You get lucky sometimes with air

10
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:01,219
shots. You have to time it, you have to lead your targets, that type of thing. But the

11
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:06,780
Sticky Launcher can be a real pain in the butt for a lot of people. And I'm here to

12
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,819
save the day. Jerma saves the day. Hold on just one second. Excuse me, hold on, what?

13
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,900
You think you're going to be teaching anyone something without me here? Who the hell are

14
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:24,250
you? I'm the principal of the local school. Oh, okay. I mean, this is a Team Fortress

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,090
2 video. I don't think you really, I mean, I don't think you need to be here. It's not

16
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:39,090
Oh, dear you. I am the school principal. That means what I say goes. And if you don't like

17
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,209
that, then I'm going to give you a math problem to screw with your brain. Stop. 2 plus 2 is

18
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:47,209
4. 4 plus 4 is 8. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Okay, I understand. You're the

19
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:51,689
school principal. And if there's one thing I know about principals, they don't like this

20
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,890
chant. You better not do it. Homework sucks. No, stop. Homework sucks. Stop it. Homework

21
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:05,099
sucks. Homework sucks. Homework sucks. Homework sucks. He did it. He's gone. Oh, for now.

22
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,780
He's gone for now. And is this even a Team Fortress video anymore? This turned into like

23
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,340
outer space adventures with Jerma. What the hell is going on? Anyways, so demo man sticky

24
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,909
bomb tips. Without that guy here anymore, we can get into this. So the sticky launcher.

25
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:25,949
So what you want to do with this thing, the most important thing about the sticky launcher

26
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:32,639
is setting traps for people. And that does not necessarily mean hiding behind a corner

27
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:39,270
with five stickies on a doorway. When I say sticky trap, I mean real time sticky traps.

28
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,490
Think of a land mine system where you're dropping land mines where you know people are going

29
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,550
to walk. And if somebody's chasing you, especially if it is a pyro, you are going to see this

30
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,610
at least two or three times in this video, a pyro will be chasing me or any close quarters

31
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:59,930
scout or something like that. Drop the stickies where they are running, kind of like a bread

32
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:05,169
crumb trail to you. So pretend you're Hansel and Gretel and the person chasing you is the

33
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:09,289
witch and you're dropping these stickies down. So when they walk over the trail, you can

34
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,689
detonate it and it might not kill them for the first sticky or even the second sticky,

35
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:17,889
but a lot of times it only takes two or three. And for the most part, people will still chase

36
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:23,289
you. So definitely check out the bread crumb trail in in quotes. I guess that could be

37
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:28,280
what it is. But the second technique I want to talk about is one that a lot of people

38
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,599
do anyways, but I want to cover it just because some people still don't do it. It is the blind

39
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,780
fire technique. And that is where if you know there are people around a corner, don't try

40
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,819
and make a trap on the right side or wait for them to come around. Just shoot in a space

41
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,280
across the corner or around the corner where you know people are going to be. Because think

42
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,349
about every single choke point in Team Fortress. There's always going to be a ton of people

43
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:57,689
around certain corners, especially on payload and especially on control point. So once you

44
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:02,250
get the knowledge of the maps, definitely use this blind fire technique and that follows

45
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,849
up with another technique. And it's not even really a technique, but still there are people

46
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,610
that don't have this. And I was one of those people that originally I did not have this

47
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:15,770
enabled. Turn on hit sounds. You go to advanced options. This is also by the way how to turn

48
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,449
on the numbers, the damage numbers. So go to advanced options, turn on play a sound

49
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:24,569
when an enemy is hit. It's something like that. And the damage numbers as text. You

50
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:29,889
want both of those, especially the first one. Because what this allows you to do is blind

51
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:33,810
fire around corners and get the ding sound and know, okay, there's people there. Let

52
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,300
me shoot more and kill four people. And it did take me a long time to turn those on and

53
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,660
I really don't know why. I think I just didn't like change. But this is going to wrap up

54
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,139
the video guys. Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. Hopefully you got

55
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,100
something out of this. I know there's a bunch more tips I can give, but these are just the

56
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,500
ones that I like to use. These are the ones that help me the most. So yeah, I'll catch

57
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,819
you guys all next time and take care everybody.
