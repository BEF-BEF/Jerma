1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:14,000
What is going on guys, Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This time I'm continuing the One Life series that I started a while back.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Like you know you've seen it before.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,239
Gonna be playing as the scout on the first one and a spy on the second one.

5
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,239
Two One Life gameplays and somebody asked me, they said,

6
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,479
Jerma, if you call it One Life, you probably should only do one class in One Life.

7
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,479
A real One Life gameplay.

8
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:40,479
And while that may be true, I don't really like to upload very much content that's less than 3 or 4 minutes.

9
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,479
I mean my vlogs and my video logs and stuff like that, those can be under 2 minutes.

10
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:51,479
But a gameplay, a real gameplay like this, I want it to be at least 5 or 6 minutes.

11
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,479
I hate uploading 2 minute gameplays unless it's a short or I'm announcing something.

12
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:57,479
But I don't have an announcement for you right now.

13
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,479
I just want to talk about the gameplay, talk about some strategies.

14
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,479
So let's get right to it.

15
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,299
King of the Hill Harvest is the map we're playing on and I gotta tell you something guys.

16
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:09,469
This setup, this shortstop, Mad Milk, and the Candy Cane setup,

17
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:13,709
Oh my god, it's my new favorite scout setup by far.

18
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,709
I love this setup.

19
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,079
This was the first time I really played with this setup.

20
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:24,079
Sure I've played Mad Milk, Shortstop before, but I've never done Mad Milk, Shortstop, and the Candy Cane.

21
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,079
Because the Candy Cane, if you don't know, when you take damage from explosive damage,

22
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:34,079
Well that's kind of redundant, but if you take explosive damage, it hurts you for 25% more.

23
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,079
So it's kind of scary. You could potentially get one shot by a rocket or one shot by a grenade.

24
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,079
It's very possible when you have the Candy Cane equipped.

25
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,079
But the really cool part about the Candy Cane is when you kill somebody, anyone with any of your weapons,

26
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,079
you get to pick up a little small health pack.

27
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,079
It just drops right onto the ground.

28
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,079
But you gotta remember, you're not the only person going after it.

29
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,079
Your teammates and your enemies can both pick it up.

30
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,079
Which can get kind of annoying, because you'll kill somebody, and one of your teammates will just be waltzing over it

31
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,079
and not even see it, and just grab it like,

32
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,079
D'uh, sorry, I...

33
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,580
And it can be really, really annoying sometimes, because you'll have 10 health,

34
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,750
and the person running over it will have 195 as a soldier, and it's just like,

35
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,750
Yeah, come on.

36
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,930
It's a really good setup though, I suggest you try it out.

37
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,930
If you've never tried it before, it's really fun.

38
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,930
And also, in this gameplay, I break my kills record.

39
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,930
Now, don't get all excited for that, because it's not a really big achievement.

40
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,930
Scout is my least...

41
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,419
I do the worst with the Scout, let's put it that way.

42
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:42,419
So, my kills record was 13 in one life before this, and now it's 15.

43
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,860
So, I guess that's okay, but I see people do a lot better.

44
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,860
So this Engineer looks like he was having lag issues, or he ran out of ammo with the Widowmaker.

45
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,860
Not really sure, but speaking of ammo, I ran out of mine,

46
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,860
so I'm running around with the Candy Cane, swinging around like a jerk,

47
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,860
and I got nowhere to go.

48
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,030
Come around here, I pick up the ammo, and now let me give you guys some Scout tips.

49
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,030
This is a very, very important tip for the Scout.

50
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,030
How to effectively double jump, and when to use it, and where to use it.

51
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,030
Watch right here, I kind of go this way, and then I double jump, juke over to the right,

52
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,030
and shoot the Heavy.

53
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,030
He was probably expecting me to be at ground level at that point,

54
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,030
so you really, really need to mess around with people,

55
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,030
and get them to think that you're going one direction,

56
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,030
and then jump a completely opposite direction.

57
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,030
It really, really throws people off.

58
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,030
You know why I know that? Because it really throws me off.

59
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,030
And that's the end of the Scout gameplay right there.

60
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,030
One life, 15 kills.

61
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,210
Try to practice your double jumping, because it can really screw people around.

62
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,210
That's where you get most of your kills, by deception.

63
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,379
Moving on now, this is the second one life gameplay.

64
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,379
It's the Spy on Gold Rush.

65
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:51,620
It's really interesting.

66
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,620
I don't really kill a whole lot of people in this one, guys,

67
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,620
but oh my god, do I destroy a lot of buildings.

68
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,620
I destroy three full level three sentry guns by myself,

69
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,860
and it's within about two and a half minutes.

70
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,860
So let's watch and see how this goes down.

71
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,860
First one, I believe, was a level two, actually, now that I watch it again.

72
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,860
So I get two level threes, and one level two, bang, Engineer goes down,

73
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,860
and I just single-handedly took out all their defenses in about 40 seconds.

74
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
So I thought that was a really, really interesting achievement.

75
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,860
I wonder why they don't have anything like that in the game right now.

76
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,100
I would really like to have seen a Spy achievement,

77
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,100
where if you destroy two or three buildings in a row,

78
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,100
or four or five buildings in a row within 30 seconds or something,

79
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,279
I think that would be actually pretty cool.

80
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,519
Forgot to tell you the loadout for the match.

81
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:44,519
The loadout for this gameplay is the Kunai vs. Kunai, or the Stinga, not E-R-A-H.

82
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,519
I renamed it the Stinga.

83
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,519
So it's the Stinga, the Ambassador, and the Dead Ringer.

84
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,699
I actually wanted to use the Diamond back in this gameplay,

85
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,699
but I didn't think there was going to be any Sentries,

86
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,699
because the gameplay before this, there wasn't very many Sentries,

87
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,699
and I don't even think there was an Engineer on the other team.

88
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,699
So look at what happens in this gameplay, though.

89
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,699
I destroy a ton of buildings, and there's like four Engineers.

90
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,699
So that would happen to me, obviously, right?

91
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:12,699
Refilling my cloak on that Dispenser.

92
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:14,699
A lot of Spies don't know that you can do that.

93
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,699
So guys, if you were unaware, if you didn't know,

94
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,699
if you stand next to a Dispenser as a Spy,

95
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,699
whether it's an enemy one or it's a friendly one,

96
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,699
you will refill your cloak.

97
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,939
So right here, I just say hello to this Engineer.

98
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:28,939
How's your family? How's your wife and kids?

99
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:32,939
Sentry goes down, and right here, I thought this was the end of the game for me.

100
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:35,939
I kind of crouched to sort of accept my fate,

101
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,939
but I ended up getting the shots on that Sniper,

102
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,939
and I ended up getting away.

103
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,180
So I was really happy about that.

104
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,670
So still being alive, I decide to pretend to be on the other team,

105
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,670
whip around, see the Medic, and completely miss the Side Stab.

106
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,670
I'm not even sure I was going for a Side Stab.

107
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,670
I think I was going for a Chaos Stab.

108
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,040
I think I'm going to coin that term right now.

109
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,279
A Chaos Stab is when absolute nonsense is going on,

110
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,279
and you're just swinging around violently,

111
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,279
and you happen to get a Back Stab on someone.

112
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,459
So that was me trying to go for a Chaos Stab,

113
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,459
just stabbing the guy in the face,

114
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:14,459
and hopefully maybe getting some lag compensation or something.

115
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,459
So now I just want to give you guys a quick little tip

116
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,459
on how to deal with a Dead Ringer spy.

117
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:23,459
As you saw right there, I just got air blasted across the map,

118
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,459
and that's something you really don't want to do.

119
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:28,459
You really don't want to air blast Dead Ringer spies,

120
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,459
because number one, it's going to make your teammates

121
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:33,459
a lot less accurate when trying to shoot them.

122
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,459
Because you know that when you take damage as a Dead Ringer,

123
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,459
it's 10% of the normal damage you would normally be taking,

124
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:43,459
so you really want people to be able to focus fire on the Dead Ringer spy.

125
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,459
Rather than launching them around all over the place,

126
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:48,459
you really want to be able to have focus on that one target.

127
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:51,459
So don't air blast a Dead Ringer spy.

128
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,459
Just try to do as much damage as you possibly can.

129
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,819
Coming up the left staircase here,

130
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,819
I was going to go for a Jumping Stab on this Heavy.

131
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,819
Decide to just go for the Sure Thing,

132
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,819
because I am really, really bad when it comes to Stair Stabs

133
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:06,819
and Trick Stabs and Jump Stabs.

134
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:07,819
So I just went for the Sure Thing,

135
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:09,819
got my Dead Ringer to activate.

136
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,819
Coming up the same staircase,

137
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,819
and I see that there is a Sniper now on the right side.

138
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,060
Kind of just wanted to shoot him in his face,

139
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,060
and that's what I end up doing.

140
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,060
One in the face, one in the body.

141
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,060
That is going to be the end of the gameplay, guys.

142
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,060
Thank you so much for watching.

143
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,060
I really do appreciate it.

144
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,060
Take care, everybody.

145
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,060
I'll see you all next time.
