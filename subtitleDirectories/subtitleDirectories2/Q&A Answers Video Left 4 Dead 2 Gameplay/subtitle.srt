1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,179
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with the Q&A answers video. Gonna be playing some Left 4 Dead 2 in the background.

2
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,179
I was playing with BooMan61. A lot of you guys might know who that is. He has the voice of gold, in my opinion.

3
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,859
Just wanted to have something in the background that you could watch or you could pay attention to while you hear these answers.

4
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:34,659
And just like my last Q&A video, gonna pick out maybe 7 or 8 good questions. Really answer them as in-depth as I possibly can.

5
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:41,039
Maybe pick out a couple funny ones too. But thank you everybody for your questions. I really appreciate it. So let's get this rolling, huh?

6
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:50,000
So the first question is going to be from Carnardo BBQ. And it was one of the top comments, so I'm gonna have to answer it.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,780
It is, who is your favorite porn star? That's how we're gonna open this one up, guys.

8
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:03,990
Well, to be completely honest with you, I don't really have one. I don't really care too much about it that I'm like, that's my favorite one.

9
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:13,510
I love her so much. But yeah, I guess I don't really have one. I don't really pay a whole lot of attention to that type of thing, so I don't have one.

10
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:25,129
Secondly, the next question is gonna come from Aether777, which was also a top comment. He asks, have you ever met any of your fans in real life?

11
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:34,480
And the answer is no. I don't really actually ever plan to. And the reason why I say that is only because I'm not really that famous.

12
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:44,109
There's only, I think, 14, yeah, just over 14,000 people that are subscribed to this channel, so I think it would be pretty much impossible to ever run into one of my fans.

13
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:51,510
But if I ever did, if I ever ran into any of you guys in real life, I would shake your hand, give you a salute, and say, hey, what is up, dude?

14
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,680
And we would go get lunch, dinner, coffee, I don't know.

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:04,969
But if I ever met anybody in real life that was a fan of my channel, I would definitely treat them with respect. I would say hello, and we would talk about video games.

16
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:10,169
Next up, we have AdamsWeeFull, who asks, and he was not the only one who asked this question.

17
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:16,479
I get this question all the time, so I figured why not answer it so you guys all know the truth.

18
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:26,509
It's, do you have a girlfriend? And the answer is no. I do not currently have a girlfriend. I don't plan on having a girlfriend anytime soon.

19
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:28,909
I am single and loving it.

20
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:36,639
No, but I've had girlfriends in the past. I had one in college, I had one before that, I had one in high school.

21
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:44,240
Lately, I've kind of just stepped away from the dating game for a while, focusing on other more important things in my life.

22
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,400
So currently, no, I do not have a girlfriend.

23
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,400
So ThunderShadow991 asks, what is the stupidest thing you have ever done?

24
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,199
And I got that a lot in the comments this time, and I will answer that.

25
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:05,580
The stupidest thing I have ever done is probably playing the Karate Kid with my older brother downstairs on the pull-out couch.

26
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,080
Now hold on, bear with me for a second.

27
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:15,860
So we had a pull-out couch back when I was like probably 11 or 12 years old, and we used to play this game called the Karate Kid,

28
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:23,060
because obviously the Karate Kid, the old movie, not the one with Jaden Smith, the old original one, had recently come out,

29
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,460
and we loved it, we wanted to be the Karate Kid, we always were messing around,

30
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,699
but we would always do it on the pull-out couch, and we would always pretend to fly off the couch.

31
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:38,680
So one day, we were playing this game, and my brother got a little too close with a roundhouse kick,

32
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:47,080
forcing me to fly really off of the back of the couch, smashing the back of my head into our fireplace.

33
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:55,520
So I stood up, grabbed the back of my head, crying, and I looked at my hand, and all of a sudden I started screaming because it was covered in blood.

34
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,319
And from that point on, it was just mayhem.

35
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:05,919
I was screaming, blood was pouring out of my head, my parents woke up, I had to get rushed to the hospital,

36
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:12,280
and I had to get six staples in the back of my head, and there's still a scar there from where the staples were.

37
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,279
So that probably takes the cake for dumbest thing I've ever done.

38
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:23,350
So next up, I want to talk about my Team Fortress 2 server that no longer exists.

39
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:30,920
Now this wasn't really a question, but I get this a lot, people really want to know what the hell happened to the Team Fortress 2 server.

40
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,759
Now let me back up for a second, I want to fill in some of the new guys that probably have no idea what I'm talking about.

41
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,600
I used to have a Team Fortress 2 server, that it was open to the public, anybody could play on it,

42
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,509
I wanted to go in there, do events all the time, and for a little while it worked out okay.

43
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:48,509
But it had a lot of lag issues.

44
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:54,110
People would join the game, and then randomly, everybody would just like crash out, everyone would lag out,

45
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,910
and I didn't know what the solution was.

46
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,509
I sent in support tickets, I sent in different queries on how to fix it, and I got back a response saying,

47
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:07,110
oh well, we're just going to change you to a new IP, and just give the new IP to everybody else.

48
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:14,110
And I said, well, I just recently gave everyone this old IP, and I just didn't want to confuse everybody by being like,

49
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,709
oh yeah, remember the server I just told you to join and favorite?

50
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:19,939
Well, you know, erase that and then join this one.

51
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:21,939
Plus, it was also really, really expensive.

52
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:26,740
I just, I don't have the money right now to support that, so I do apologize,

53
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,540
but in the future, when I can be more sustainable with it, I will try to bring that back.

54
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,040
But as of right now, the server is closed for good.

55
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,009
So I apologize about that.

56
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:41,810
Following up with some more questions, this one is from Dogeese Seagawd24.

57
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,009
He asks, do you follow any sports?

58
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:46,209
And the answer is I do.

59
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:49,610
Very, very, very diehard sports fan here.

60
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,410
Big Boston Red Sox fan, big Patriots fan.

61
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,389
Funny you mention sports because the Patriots, they're in the Super Bowl.

62
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,790
They made it to the Super Bowl actually like two nights ago.

63
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,790
So that's really exciting.

64
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,790
And they're playing the New York Giants in the Super Bowl.

65
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,389
And if any of you guys are football fans, American football fans, let me rephrase that.

66
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,790
You will know that these two teams, the Patriots and the Giants,

67
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,990
this is a rematch.

68
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,790
This is a Super Bowl rematch from a few years ago, like five years ago or something like that.

69
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,790
But yeah, and we lost last time.

70
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,990
They whooped our butts in like the last two minutes of the game and I was pissed.

71
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,290
No, but yeah, this is a good rematch.

72
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,189
Should be an awesome game.

73
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,730
I cannot wait.

74
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,329
But besides football and baseball, I don't really follow any other sport.

75
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:36,029
It's kind of unfortunate because our hockey team, the Boston Bruins,

76
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,730
they just won the Stanley Cup this past year.

77
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,730
And I was just like, wait, what happened?

78
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,629
Who won Stanley, what, huh?

79
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:44,230
But yeah, I need to get back into hockey.

80
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,360
I need to find a way to make it interesting for me because we have a good team.

81
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,860
Next is a question by Kuzka.

82
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,259
I think I'm saying that right.

83
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,860
And they ask, hello, Germa, do you draw at all?

84
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,360
If so, what artists inspire you?

85
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,860
If not, do you have any favorite artists in general?

86
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,560
Now, I'll answer this.

87
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,860
I do not draw.

88
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,360
I am terrible at drawing.

89
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,759
My minor in college, believe it or not, is art.

90
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,360
But I don't know how to draw at all.

91
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,060
I'm terrible at it.

92
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,860
I can barely draw stick figures.

93
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,959
The reason why I answered this question is because do you have any favorite artists in general?

94
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,959
I do.

95
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,639
Doug Tenapel.

96
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:25,040
If you watched my first enlightened video, you will know that Doug Tenapel is the guy that made The Neverhood.

97
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,639
He made Earthworm Jim.

98
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,240
And he also is a very, very talented graphic novelist.

99
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,439
He makes some of the most awesome graphic novels ever.

100
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,639
He's got like, I think, maybe 15 or 20 graphic novels now.

101
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,339
And they're all really, really good.

102
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,240
So I suggest if you're into graphic novels and if you're into art in general,

103
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,439
he has an unbelievable style and you've got to check him out.

104
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,740
The next one, this one, I get this all the time as well.

105
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,740
What headset do you use?

106
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,720
I use a Turtle Beach X11 headset.

107
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Gonna start answering these now a little faster,

108
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,819
try to get through another three or four before the video ends.

109
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,720
So, rapid fire mode, here we go.

110
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,560
What video game have you had the most emotional response to?

111
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,860
Chrono Trigger by far.

112
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,360
Chrono Trigger definitely got me really, really worked up at some of the parts in that game.

113
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,220
Definitely Chrono Trigger.

114
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,019
Can you lend me some of your sexiness?

115
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:19,069
Yeah, sure, here you go.

116
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:20,569
Sexiness acquired.

117
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,269
There you go, you should be good now.

118
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,269
What was your major in college?

119
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:25,269
Communication.

120
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,750
Communication is film, TV, and radio.

121
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,850
Somebody asked, mana mana?

122
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,019
And my answer is, do do do do do.

123
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:34,759
There you go.

124
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,860
And lastly, somebody asked, are you ever going to do a serious Let's Play?

125
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,960
The answer is absolutely yes.

126
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,360
When Diablo 3 comes out, I am going to do a ton of content on that game.

127
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,799
So expect a really more comprehensive Let's Play when Diablo 3 launches, who knows when.

128
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,000
But yeah, thank you guys so much for all your questions.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,500
We will do another one of these in probably another couple weeks.

130
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,100
Not sure, I'll let you guys know when I want some more questions.

131
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,799
I can even pull some from here and the last video.

132
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,799
So thank you so much for watching, guys.

133
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,200
I really do appreciate it.

134
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,899
And I will see you all next time.

135
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,200
Take care, everybody.
