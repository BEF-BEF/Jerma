00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:07,820
Yo, what's happening guys? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary!

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,000
Playing as the sniper tonight with the Machina.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Never done a Machina gameplay, a lot of you guys asked me for this, and I finally have done it.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So it's the Machina, the Darwin's Danger Shield, and the Tribalman's Shiv, I believe.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I die once or twice in the beginning here, and after that, I just start mowing people down like crazy, headshot after headshot, it's pretty awesome.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,240
So why I never use the Machina and why I've never done a Machina gameplay?

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Everybody always tells me, Jerma, the Machina is the best sniper rifle in the game.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,420
Hands down, why wouldn't you use it? Just equip it for crying out loud.

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,420
And the reason why I never use it, guys, is because I can't handle the line that comes out of the gun.

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,780
That might sound weird, but it has nothing to do with giving away my position.

11
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,020
What bothers me about it is the fact that I can't really see that well.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:10,200
It sort of messes with my aim, because I'll shoot somebody, and if I miss, this big bright line comes right in my face, and my ADHD kicks in, and I just focus on that, and then I get shot, I just can't recuperate.

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,200
So I can't use this gun mainly because of that line.

14
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,200
The second reason why I can't use this weapon is the no hip fire.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:27,439
I can't take it, because I'm one of those people that if a spy is around, I'm much more satisfied and much safer shooting him from the hip rather than going in and getting face stabbed.

16
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,620
So not being able to hip fire really, really sucks.

17
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,790
And I know a lot of you guys are going to tell me, well, Jerma, equip the machine gun, the SMG, that's the perfect combination.

18
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,030
It's just the SMG has such weird hit detection.

19
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:47,030
It seems like when you use the SMG and you shoot somebody, half the time the bullets don't even register landing on the person.

20
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,030
It's just really odd. I don't like the hit detection on that weapon, so I don't like to use it.

21
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,400
But all in all, this gun is very, very good for killing people who are over-healed.

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,879
This is the over-healer killer. Kind of a mouthful, I know.

23
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:07,060
You can kill people that are over-healed with a body shot with this gun.

24
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:18,060
Any of the smaller classes, a scout, a sniper, spy, even a medic, you can still body shot them and potentially kill them with a fully charged body shot, which that was not the case with the older sniper rifle.

25
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:25,360
So one of the only tips I can really give you with this gun, because honestly I don't really use it that often, is you have to be patient.

26
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,360
This is the patient man's sniper rifle. You can't just go shooting like a Texas Longhorn.

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,360
I don't even know what that is. But you can't just shoot all over the place.

28
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,360
You need to really time your shots, because guys, you're giving away your position every time you shoot the gun.

29
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,360
And to touch upon that for a second, if you stay in the same position for long enough, you are going to get found out.

30
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,360
People are going to start to shoot at you. People are going to start coming after you.

31
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,360
So move around a lot, guys. Don't stand in the same position for more than 20 or 30 seconds.

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,360
And I know I don't do that at all in this gameplay. I'm standing in the same spot, but that's because this is on Gold Rush.

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,360
And Gold Rush really only has like two or three places a sniper can even stand in the first place.

34
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,360
But on a big map like Upward or Badwater or something like that, you really need to move around.

35
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,360
So there you go. There's my rant on the Makina.

36
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,360
I'm going to talk about the gameplay, what's going on on the screen now, while there's still time.

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,729
So I just walk out the back door here, go pick up this health. I love this health pack.

38
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:31,729
This is the best health pack in the game. Just because it's a full health pack, it's right there, right around that choke point.

39
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:35,900
I love it so much. Coming back to this window here, bad idea.

40
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,900
Almost get myself killed for a second time. And you would think I learned my lesson right here, but I do not.

41
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,900
Get some health, come back over to that same window. I want to get that Demoman, whether it kills me or not.

42
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,080
I don't care. I want to get him. There he is right there. I don't get the shot on him.

43
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,080
He's too well protected by that wall. Sniper just dies. I don't know whether he had a heart attack, I think.

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,080
So look at this. Nobody's coming out. The heavy medic pair is up there doing work.

45
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,080
There they are. I figured time to get out of this window.

46
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,259
Jumping down, I get right next to the car because nobody's on it right now.

47
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:12,259
This is a great opportunity to push the cart and nobody's on it.

48
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:18,430
The plan is to stand next to the cart while you're zoomed in so you still get the cap points.

49
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:24,430
Gets a little too dangerous to continue to do that, so I sit back here, try to get some spawn trap headshots.

50
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,430
I think I get maybe one or two and I end up going around the left side because action kind of dies down right here.

51
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,430
Don't see anybody really coming out. I'm missing a lot of shots.

52
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,430
So I take a left-handed turn over here, go around the left side, try to flank him a little bit.

53
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,670
Ends up working out much, much better than this is right now.

54
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,670
I take the turn in about five seconds here, go around the left side. I get a bunch of headshots after this.

55
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,670
I get one shot in particular that I just couldn't believe I got it.

56
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,670
I was like, wow, how the hell did I get that?

57
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,670
It's an engineer coming up right here. Get this soldier. I believe I get this pyro as well. There he is.

58
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,670
So it's an engineer that I end up getting. I missed this scout right here, but watch this.

59
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,670
When I get this engineer, I like perfectly track his head, almost like I'm hacking or something,

60
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,670
but I promise you I'm not hacking. I end up just getting it somehow.

61
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,910
There it is right there, perfectly tracked headshot on an engineer jumping around a corner.

62
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,910
Germa hack version 1.6. That is going to be the end of the gameplay.

63
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,910
I get this last heavy. He's kind of just standing here.

64
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,910
I missed the headshot right there, but I get him twice, one and two right there.

65
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,910
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

66
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,910
I top frag in this gameplay, which is always fun, always cool.

67
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,910
So if you like this video, go ahead and throw me a like, and I will see you guys all next time.

68
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,910
Take care, everybody.
