00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,500
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here and Boo. Hello. Playing some smite.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:23,480
Gonna be a live commentary. Gonna showcase Apollo, the god of music. Now don't ask me why.

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,480
Apollo is the god of way more things than just like music. But they kind of have to put that there.

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:37,509
Because there's way too many things he could be. Let's go. Where are we going? Right. Okay.

5
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:47,140
Oh, but bro. Oh, come on, Cupid. Don't do this to us. Did they want to go right?

6
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:56,539
Well, Aokwong is mid. What? Are we gonna have like a party over here? What did he say?

7
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:01,539
I think he's going left. What the hell is he talking about? I don't even know.

8
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:05,540
I think he wanted to go with this Aokwong. Like I think they might be premade. Yeah.

9
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:11,409
Or maybe not. I don't even know. I just want to get a piece of cake from the cake slug.

10
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:28,420
Who's getting this? You take this. Okay. I hope this tornado doesn't just kill him.

11
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:37,090
Alright. Thank you. Let's do it. You know the speed buff now gives you attack speed as well.

12
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:43,079
Oh yeah, it does. 10%. Which is why it's better for the physical guys to take it.

13
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,510
Especially for ranged because you can just pop the minions easier. Yeah, they did that a little while ago, right?

14
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,510
Yeah, it was last month or something like that.

15
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,510
So for those of you that have no idea who Apollo is, he's the newest god.

16
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,939
If you're watching... Oh, watch out, Ragney. If you're watching this...

17
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:09,280
Jeez. What the... Okay. Ragney's scary, level one. Yeah, she is. She's aggressive.

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,280
She also doesn't got a whole lot of health now, does she?

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,280
She'll probably regenerate back. Does she have any potions? I don't know.

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Yeah, she has two health potions.

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,280
So what I was saying before, Ragney just tried to smoke me.

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Apollo is the newest god. If you're watching this right now and like six other gods have been out by then,

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,819
then I apologize, but he's ranged. He's pretty powerful. He's got a lot of utility.

24
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:36,729
I'll try and give you some speed. It should be okay. I got Creeping Cursed.

25
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:47,800
Okay. Yeah, he's probably my favorite god at this point. I just love the sounds.

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:56,840
Get out of here. This guy. These guys are super aggressive. They are very aggressive, yes.

27
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,300
She's probably going to take our cooldown, right? Yeah, most probably.

28
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:14,110
That's our cooldown, Ragney. What the hell? Oh crap. I'm not a man in here.

29
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:24,370
So I guess try not to stand on our minions because Hades will want to dash you and that'll sting a bit.

30
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:34,740
It really will. She's going to have her pulse soon. We can do one more anyway before she gets it.

31
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:44,979
Should have got Hand. I should have got Hand of the Gods. Take those away.

32
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:51,039
She's looking. Yeah, she's right here. She's right here. She's literally right here.

33
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,860
I don't have my dash yet, but Hades is coming. We might build it.

34
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,310
We can fight Hades. No, she's here. She's here. She's here.

35
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,740
I still don't have my dash yet. I don't know why I got my fear first. I was very stupid over here.

36
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:09,830
Do you think Ragney's going to come back? Yes, she is. She's ahead of us.

37
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:19,529
So those of you wondering, when I hit 10 auto attacks, I get to shoot five that are really, really fast.

38
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,769
Just like this. Oh boy, there she is. And I'm silenced.

39
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:32,680
They're diving. No, they're diving. I'm going to go down.

40
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,680
No, you're good. You're good. Just kill that spider. There you go.

41
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,300
Hades did not ult you. No, he's not five yet. Okay.

42
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:48,939
Ragney's out of mana. Ooh, you going in? Careful. Oh boy, here she goes.

43
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:54,769
Oh no, no, no, no. We got a Ragney.

44
00:04:54,769 --> 00:05:00,769
I threw an auto attack on her. Oh no, I tried to hit F4 and I hit F3.

45
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:06,269
Is that your... Oh, you didn't get back up your ult. God damn it.

46
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:15,029
One thing about this keyboard I don't like is if I hit any of the F keys, I feel like I'm pressing all of them at the same time.

47
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:22,970
It's quite annoying. But yeah, I threw an auto attack at her and she just jumped right on top of you right when it happened.

48
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,730
I'm not going to do it yet though. Let me know when you want to go in because I'll pop girdle.

49
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:37,040
Stay away from the minions. Hades is a piece of crap. Oh, well, you're Hades too. Whoops.

50
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:45,759
Yeah, but I'm a cool looking Hades. He's just a jump default skin Hades.

51
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,370
That's in the middle. That's only Archon. I'm not too scared of Archon.

52
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,180
What's he going in? What's he doing? Well, he's taking a lot of minion damage for this.

53
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:02,589
Yeah, he sure is. Ragney's right behind. Nice job. Oh, now she knocked her up.

54
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:07,220
I'll fear her. Let's kill her. Let's kill her. Yeah, she's not going to get away.

55
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,540
Oh, so much damage. I had to Aegis otherwise she was going to kill me.

56
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,540
I was about five mana away from smacking the ground with my three and I would have killed her.

57
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,600
I just didn't have enough. I was unlucky. Good exchange.

58
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,350
Hades, when he dashed, he went to just go slam on minions, but my fear was ranked up and he couldn't do it.

59
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:39,300
He just took a bunch of archer damage for it and his dash was down so I might as well ult him.

60
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:50,290
That's true. God, there's so many minions. So many minions.

61
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,589
How's everyone else doing? Oh, they're doing pretty good. Nine and four.

62
00:06:53,589 --> 00:07:00,459
Alcong's holding up mid. He's two and one. Left lane. Cupid's three now. Yep, it's looking good.

63
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:03,459
Yeah, it's going to be good. I think cooldown buff is back up if you want to grab that.

64
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:07,139
Hades isn't really going to... Oh, wait, Ragney. Ragney is on your side.

65
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:13,459
I'll be fine. I'll dash through her. She must have pulled me out. Yeah, she missed. She missed her pull.

66
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:21,540
Silly girl. Get out of here. Oh, man, her basic attacks do so much damage.

67
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:27,839
I've got to get Voidblade. Voidblade is next, for sure.

68
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:37,850
I don't know if she wants it. I'm ulting as well. Yep, just hanging out, shooting autos.

69
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:47,459
Got one. Oh, she does so much damage. Oh, no. Oh, she webbed it.

70
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:56,810
Oh, damn, she's strong. Yeah. Son of a bitch. It's that dark, man.

71
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:03,379
What is she building? A little bit of life still. She hasn't got three yet, though.

72
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,779
She's probably in the jungle. I bet she's over here somewhere.

73
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:16,430
Yeah, I just hear her put eggs down. She's at Manor, actually. This is risky, isn't it?

74
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,430
Yeah, this is... Well, here she comes. Oh, she just got it.

75
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:29,199
Just get away from here. I'm going to... Oh, damn, I'm so dead. I'm so dead.

76
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,500
She's almost dead. My last hope. My last... No, boop. No, no, no.

77
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,720
She's one shot. Yep, she sure is. Hey, Ragney.

78
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,149
Oh, you got... Oh, stupid bugs. They're nearly dead. They're easy to kill.

79
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:49,149
Hades is coming your way, but he's really low. Yeah. Yeah, shoot him, shoot him.

80
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:51,330
I think you can kill him. You think I can get him? Yeah.

81
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,940
He can't do much damage to you. Yep. No. He's out of Manor as well.

82
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,889
Just shoot him. Oh, as I say... Oh, damn. He meditated.

83
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:05,889
Did he really use it? Yeah, at least he blew his meditation.

84
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:09,889
Yeah, I didn't know he was that low. I thought he was at at least more than half.

85
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:13,059
I don't know why he chased you. He's never going to out DPS here

86
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:17,429
if he's got no minions to smash, so I don't know what he was trying to do.

87
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:19,429
I thought he had way more health than that. Oh, well, that's good.

88
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:22,610
That's a good exchange. I'll take it. I'll take that, yeah.

89
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:29,940
I don't mind dying for the killing of the Arachne, at least, let alone the Hades two.

90
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,940
Left lane's still doing really solid 5-0 cupid. Oh, wow, yeah.

91
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,909
It's a long case 2-1. It's looking like a GG, but...

92
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:42,470
So, Paul's ultimate for people that are like, what the hell was that?

93
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,649
If you know Thor, Thor's ultimate is he goes in the air and you can pick a spot to jump down

94
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:48,649
and it stuns everybody, right?

95
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:52,950
Apollo's, you can just ride around in the air forever.

96
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,950
Well, not forever. It drains, what, 50 mana per second?

97
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,580
So, you can stay up in the air for as long as your mana can hold

98
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,580
and then you just land right on top of everybody.

99
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,879
It doesn't stun anyone, though. That's the thing, it does not stun anybody.

100
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,419
It just does like, I think it does a dot, right? If I'm not mistaken.

101
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:14,539
What, no? Apollo, his dot.

102
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:18,539
Yeah, his ultimate's kind of weird. It's like taking damage, his ultimate.

103
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:23,620
Oh, my God, every single person is in mid.

104
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,620
Yeah, that was really unlucky. I was about to smash everyone

105
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,620
and as I went to do it, Arachne silenced me. I couldn't.

106
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,210
Oh, they're not in mid anymore.

107
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:41,230
Yeah, they're building a Doom Orb.

108
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,230
So, he's got a lot of magic power. He hasn't died yet, either.

109
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,600
Arachne's up by Goldfury.

110
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Is she gonna attack Goldfury? I'll jump on top of her if she is.

111
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,470
I think her, I don't know. I think her spider's hatched.

112
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,840
I think we have wards there, I think.

113
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,080
Yeah, I was gonna say. Oh, she's in lane.

114
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,580
I might. Oh, boy, never mind.

115
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,779
I was gonna say, I might be able to go jump on top of her right now.

116
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:09,710
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe we could.

117
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,850
Hades ult is done. Mine's up. Yep, let's do it.

118
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,470
Alright, I'm going in the air.

119
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:23,769
I thought she was gonna come backwards.

120
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:33,840
Oh, she exploded. She blew up.

121
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,429
Nice one. Yeah, I timed my ultimate.

122
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:41,429
I thought she was gonna go backwards. I never landed on nobody.

123
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:44,440
That's okay. At least we got them both.

124
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,440
Yeah, she was really far up with no mana.

125
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
And, like, not even have health.

126
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,049
I don't know what she was thinking.

127
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:54,049
We could grab mana. I think it might be up.

128
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,909
Maybe, maybe not. Let's check.

129
00:11:56,909 --> 00:12:00,610
Nah, okay. No.

130
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,169
I don't think it'll be long.

131
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,169
I reckon she's talking about three minutes ago.

132
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:10,779
Let's just try to get the tower.

133
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:22,419
Right. Get that little doily. Little doily.

134
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:26,419
How are you doing? Oh, wow, you're 6 and 2. Nice.

135
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:29,110
Got a bunch of kills.

136
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,830
Put a bit of her in the tower, but fear that guy.

137
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,309
Fear me.

138
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:39,309
Let's just not get pulled by her.

139
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah, she's looking for a pull on me.

140
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Nah, she got me, but it's okay.

141
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, shit, okay.

142
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,460
My bad.

143
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:55,409
Oh, boy, I'm going down here, for sure.

144
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:57,409
Oh, get out, boo.

145
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,409
She's just so much damage.

146
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:02,100
I don't think she actually went back to spawn.

147
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,230
I think she just life drained something.

148
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,230
But, yeah, let's not get pulled in.

149
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,139
Hades will have his ult now.

150
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:13,139
Arachne, I don't get her.

151
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,139
Loki, Loki, Loki.

152
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:17,379
Loki right here.

153
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,379
Oh, boy. Oh, my God.

154
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:24,289
Oh, boy.

155
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:27,679
Trying to get that hit on that Loki.

156
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,679
Oh, one more hit. Come on.

157
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,679
Oh, bitch, I'm going to die from the bleed.

158
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,679
No, you're not.

159
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,679
I feared her while she was hitting you.

160
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,679
That was very close.

161
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,679
I just get back to spawn before Hades

162
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,679
dashes out the jungle on you.

163
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,679
That was so close.

164
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,820
I'm lucky I had that last shot on

165
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,590
my one. My one's what killed her.

166
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:55,389
Yeah, well, lucky Hades was in there as well.

167
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:57,389
Loki kind of just, I don't know,

168
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:59,389
I thought he would have killed you, to be honest.

169
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,389
I know, so really, what does he build?

170
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:03,389
What does he get for items? Oh, he's only level 13, that's why.

171
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:05,389
He's just not, he's just been kind of

172
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:07,389
underleveled all game.

173
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,529
Left lane kind of sorted him out for us.

174
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:12,529
He definitely would have killed me.

175
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:14,529
If he was 15 or 16, oh, man,

176
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:16,529
I would have died in two hits.

177
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:18,830
I was just lucky.

178
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,830
I'm going to get physical protection for that Arachne.

179
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,830
I don't get Arachne. She's

180
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,830
super strong and scary.

181
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,830
I am terrified of her, but

182
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,029
she's considered one of the worst gods.

183
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:32,029
Yeah, that's very odd. Oh, right here, right here. Freya.

184
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:34,980
Freya's right here. Freya's literally right here.

185
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,919
She's on four. She's not too much of a threat.

186
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,990
She can still do big damage.

187
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,990
I might go in here and try to find her. She was just literally

188
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,679
right here. No, I'd say save it.

189
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,519
Save it for them. We all going to jump on this

190
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,519
Loki? Is that the plan? I think we're about to

191
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,519
show this Loki that he's in the wrong

192
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,700
lane. Alright, here we go.

193
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
You're in the wrong part of town, son.

194
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,389
Let's see if I can time this. I was going to say

195
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:03,389
he's right here. He's in the jungle.

196
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:09,009
Hello. I see Freya

197
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,009
as well. Oh, he's

198
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,009
over here. He's trying to... What, you don't think we can see

199
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:15,759
you over here?

200
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,759
Was he going to try and pull it through?

201
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,190
I don't know. That was weird. That was very odd.

202
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,559
This got gold. Arachne

203
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,379
probably just soloed that, to be honest.

204
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,899
As long as we... I got the tower.

205
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,519
I found a dragon.

206
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,370
Geez, you really did. Come on!

207
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,370
It was kind of unnecessary.

208
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,370
Alright, I'm going to get out of here. Oh, boy.

209
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,370
Arachne's right here. Arachne's right here. She's right here.

210
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,370
Yep, they're both right here.

211
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,370
Run.

212
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,669
Get out. Get out. Get out.

213
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:51,669
Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.

214
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:53,669
Get out of here. Get out of here. See if a long guy leaves.

215
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:55,669
Retreat. I don't know. They might be able to get that.

216
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,669
Oh, no.

217
00:15:57,669 --> 00:15:59,669
He's screwed. He's out of manners.

218
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:01,669
Oh, look at his health going down.

219
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,039
Yeah.

220
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:08,259
He's doing an attack buff. Oh, of course you got that.

221
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,769
Get him. Get him.

222
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:17,019
Oh, good dragon.

223
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,019
Right when he does his ult. Beautiful.

224
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,019
Oh, no.

225
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:26,710
She's not going to get away. Oh, no.

226
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,830
Freya.

227
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,830
No, I didn't. She's life stealing it.

228
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,289
One more hit.

229
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:39,909
One more hit.

230
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:42,220
I missed so many auto attacks.

231
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,220
So many auto attacks were missed right there.

232
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,899
My goodness.

233
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:48,899
Thank god I could hit my one.

234
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,899
Seriously.

235
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:52,899
There was a Freya. She could ult you.

236
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,460
Oh, my god. You're right. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run.

237
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
That actually makes me run faster, doesn't it?

238
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,639
You dashed and the circle hit me.

239
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,639
So I move faster. It's cool.

240
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,639
Yeah.

241
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,640
It's a good buff.

242
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,670
I really need a void stone, but I can't afford one yet.

243
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,809
Let's go with some.

244
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:14,809
I want some crit and I want some spree.

245
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:18,200
And I want some more coffee.

246
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,200
I'm kind of glad the Arachne is doing well, otherwise this would just be a steam roll and the game would have been over a long time ago.

247
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
At least I'm making a game of it.

248
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,980
Because his left lane just stumped.

249
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,500
Are you building stacks or anything?

250
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,059
Nope.

251
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,059
I never do. I never do.

252
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,059
Well, Devara's Gloves is pretty amazing.

253
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,230
I don't buy it very often.

254
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,230
It's really cheap.

255
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,230
I only found out the other day.

256
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,230
The one thing I don't like about stack items is

257
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,230
you have to get the stacks.

258
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,230
I like the items that just give you the shit.

259
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,230
You get it.

260
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,980
Are you taking this?

261
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,980
You take it. I've already got max cooldown reduction.

262
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,059
Oh, let's go help.

263
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,109
I'm going up.

264
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:05,109
One of them's down. Loki's dead.

265
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:07,109
I'm going after Freya right now.

266
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:09,109
Oh, my prediction was wrong.

267
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:13,720
It's alright.

268
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
They're so dead.

269
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,019
Goodbye.

270
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:22,809
Nice.

271
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,809
Yeah, we can do Jhin.

272
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:27,180
There's Arachne.

273
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,180
In fact, if you get Jhin, I'll knock down midtown and make sure Arachne doesn't come.

274
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,859
Sounds like a plan.

275
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:35,180
Who's tanking this?

276
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,180
I actually think they're waiting for you.

277
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,119
No, they're not.

278
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,619
Arachne's missing now.

279
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,619
She's next to me, actually.

280
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:49,289
We should kill this before she gets here.

281
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:51,460
He's almost dead.

282
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,460
He is almost dead.

283
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,019
I'm going to need help with this Arachne.

284
00:18:56,019 --> 00:19:04,200
That's the one.

285
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Thank you very much.

286
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
I was just kind of dueling with it, like dancing while you were doing giant,

287
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
then you all just popped out on it.

288
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,720
There it is.

289
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
GG.

290
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,410
How'd you do?

291
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,410
Pretty good.

292
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,839
Probably wouldn't have had at least

293
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,839
three or four of those kills if not for your ultimate, but

294
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:27,589
that's how you do it, right?

295
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:29,960
Thanks for watching, guys.

296
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
That's Apollo, the god of music,

297
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
the sun, rain, the stars,

298
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
and every other thing in Greek and

299
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Roman mythology. He's Greek, right?

300
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Greek, yeah.

301
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
I think he's called Apollo in Greek and Roman.

302
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,140
I'm not sure.

303
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,140
Thanks for watching.

304
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,140
My pleasure.

305
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,140
And see you next time. Take care, everybody.

306
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,140
Goodbye, Smite!
