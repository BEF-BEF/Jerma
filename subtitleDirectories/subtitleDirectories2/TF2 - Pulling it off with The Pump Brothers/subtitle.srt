1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:10,140
Are you playing on a server now?

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,830
Yeah. I told you I was fucking pumped up for like duty shit.

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,829
Yo, I'm pumped up right now. We're both pumped. Call us the Pump Brothers.

4
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:17,829
You wanna be the Pump Brothers?

5
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:19,140
No.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,140
Yo, you don't wanna be the Pump Brothers?

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,140
I really don't actually.

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,140
You don't want me to pump you up? You don't want me to pump you?

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,739
I don't want you to pump me.

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,740
I think I'm just gonna spectate you.

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,740
I'm gonna teach you how to pull it off, Star. Are you ready for this?

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,740
I wanna see how to pull it off. Luigi, hee hee. Show me how to pull it off.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,740
First of all, you wanna jump. No, this is important. You wanna jump up on this rail.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,179
Jump up on these big spindydoodles.

15
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,179
Once you get on the top spindydoodle, then it's really important that you wait here.

16
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:50,179
My carcass is everywhere.

17
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:52,179
That door. You don't wanna go in that door.

18
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,420
Oh, yeah?

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:00,539
Go to the spindydoodle. Go. Just go. This is...

20
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:01,539
Hit something.

21
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,539
Don't worry. I'll pull this off. You wanna see how you pull it off?

22
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,849
Time to turn it on.

23
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,939
Turn it on.

24
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:08,939
That's how you pull it off, this one.

25
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,939
Oh my god. What a hip shot.

26
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:11,939
Hey!

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:12,939
Wasn't even aiming for him.

28
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,939
Wasn't even aiming for that guy.

29
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:18,269
Oh, there's a sentry over here.

30
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,269
Sentry. Spy, you gotta do your work. Get in there and get that sentry.

31
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:21,269
Get the health kit. Get the health kit.

32
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:23,269
I can't. There's a sentry right there. Are you stupid?

33
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:24,269
No.

34
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:29,180
Not as in the type of dream that you have that you didn't like,

35
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,180
but as in the Soul Calibur II character,

36
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,180
as in the 3-3-B is a very good launcher.

37
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,180
There's a lot of damage. I think 72 damage.

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,180
Okay, we're gonna watch you pull it off, man.

39
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,420
I'm gonna pull it off.

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,420
There's just mini sentry.

41
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,420
It doesn't count because there was a mini sentry.

42
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,420
Didn't pull it off.

43
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,420
No. Redo.

44
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,420
All right, fine. Redo.

45
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,420
You get one more shot to pull it off.

46
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,189
I'm gonna pull it off.

47
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,709
Ready?

48
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,709
This time the mini sentry won't get me.

49
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:58,709
All right.

50
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,709
Looks like he's gonna see a demo man around the corner.

51
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,709
No, no. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go...

52
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,709
It didn't pull it off again.

53
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:05,709
That doesn't count either

54
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,710
because he's the guy who builds mini sentries.

55
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:14,370
This is your final chance to pull it off.

56
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,370
Dude, I am just not pulling it off right now.

57
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,370
You have a chance, right? No.

58
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,370
Wow. You are just not pulling it off.

59
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,370
No, it does. It does.

60
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,370
That was three pulls.

61
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,370
No, it's my turn to pull it off.

62
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,370
No, it's three strikes. You're out.

63
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,370
Yeah, you're on strike four right now.

64
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,370
I'm pulling it off.

65
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,370
The first one didn't count because it was a mini sentry.

66
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,370
That's fine. I'm pulling it off.

67
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,370
I don't care. I'm not watching you because I'm about to pull it off.

68
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,370
No, that's fine. I'm pulling it off before you pull it off.

69
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,370
There's no way you're gonna be able to pull it off.

70
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,370
Oh, really? You think so?

71
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,370
I think so. Go for it. I'm going for the sentries.

72
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,370
If you pull it off before I pull it off...

73
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,370
If you pull it off before I pull it off before you pull it off,

74
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,659
then there's gonna be a big problem here.

75
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,659
No, no, no, no. Don't let up. Yeah, shoot him, Heavy.

76
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:58,659
There's two... I didn't pull it off.

77
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:01,659
This is like the worst I've played in my life.

78
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:03,659
I didn't pull it off either.

79
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:05,659
It's 13 seconds left to pull it off.

80
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,659
I mean, come on. One of us is gonna pull it off.

81
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,659
Somebody... Okay, I'm going demo.

82
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,659
Somebody has to really pull this off.

83
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,219
There's no time to get over here to pull it off.

84
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,219
Come on. You gotta pull it off.

85
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,219
I could pull it off if I had another minute.

86
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,219
This is a lot...

87
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:23,860
Okay, what's the lineup here? What are we looking at?

88
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
Punch heavies.

89
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,830
Both of us? Yes.

90
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,830
You know we're gonna meet? We have a specific meeting point.

91
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,139
No bullshit.

92
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,379
No trickery. No tomfoolery.

93
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:39,189
Okay, no attacking each other.

94
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:41,500
No bullshit.

95
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
No tomfoolery.

96
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
We just want a straight punch heavy fight.

97
00:03:45,500 --> 00:04:03,610
No bullshit.

98
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:09,620
I think I found a way.

99
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,800
Oh, are you typing to someone?

100
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,039
I'm talking to MLC stuff.

101
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:26,379
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

102
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,379
Are you working with him?

103
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,060
Yeah, I've been typing to this sniper.

104
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,430
Just wait, he's gonna come.

105
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,430
Have you?

106
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,209
Yes.

107
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:41,209
He was sitting here just waiting, aiming down here.

108
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:43,209
This whole fucking time I've been typing.

109
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:48,709
Can you pull it off?

110
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,019
Yeah, I can pull it off. Just let me get the health.

111
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:53,319
And we'll have our battle royale.

112
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,500
Okay, you ready?

113
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,670
Wait, wait, wait. I'm not ready.

114
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,670
Okay, I'm ready.

115
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,670
Are you ready to have the actual battle royale?

116
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,089
Okay, battle royale.

117
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,389
Get that health.

118
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:13,000
Shit!

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,610
It's the same sniper.

120
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,610
That sniper almost got me again.

121
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,810
He was waiting in a corner to Dorati.

122
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,810
Are you instructing him on everything?

123
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,810
No, seriously, have you heard me type?

124
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,540
Alright, wait.

125
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,540
Kill him.

126
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Oh my fucking god.

127
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,540
He just gunned you down.

128
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,680
He thought about it until you saw him think about it.

129
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,750
Invisible potty.

130
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,060
Have you ever read Invisible Weekly today?

131
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,060
I did.

132
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,300
I didn't like the part where it said we were a bunch of chumps.

133
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,300
That part was not good.

134
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,300
Invisible Weekly has been really going downhill.

135
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,300
It used to be about articles, but now it's just about the naked ladies.

136
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,470
I know.

137
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,470
Always the invisible naked ladies now.

138
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,120
Yeah, I know. You can't even see them. It doesn't make any sense.

139
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,620
Stand over here.

140
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,620
And I'm going to decloak and shoot this sniper in the back.

141
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,620
And we're both going to cloak at the same...

142
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,620
To make it so we're just permanently invisible.

143
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,920
So they have no idea where they're getting shot from.

144
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
I'm going to keep annoying people.

145
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
See where the pyro is right now?

146
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Shoot him and then we're both invisible forever.

147
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm going to go to the other side of the map.

148
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
So it's both angles.

149
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,949
I'm going to climb up this rock.

150
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,949
I'm going to shoot this soldier.

151
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:34,470
God damn.

152
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,470
I'm going to shoot the pyro.

153
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,990
I hit that pyro.

154
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,990
He's coming back.

155
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,170
Are you invisible?

156
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,560
He has no idea what's going on.

157
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
He's coming up here.

158
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,740
See the sniper?

159
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,740
He's shooting at me.

160
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,740
I shot him.

161
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,740
I'm going to shoot him.

162
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,420
You shoot him now.

163
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,660
I shot him.

164
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
He's going to be right back in spawn.

165
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,819
I pulled it off.
