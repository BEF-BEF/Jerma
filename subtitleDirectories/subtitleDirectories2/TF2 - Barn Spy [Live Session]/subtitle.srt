00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:14,250
Hey what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a live spy gameplay commentary currently on Barnblitz.

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:22,489
So welcome. Just gonna jump in play some TF2 and I'll show you how to deal with a bunch of blue

3
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:31,239
metanaries. Oh all right let's play let's play let's play let's play come on come on just don't even

4
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:39,030
realize that there's a spy waiting for this heavy to turn the corner and get him oh oh oh oh oh oh

5
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:43,429
change change god i feel like it's been like a million years since i played spy especially

6
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:49,030
like live and being recorded so let's see how this goes pattern opportunity it's okay i still got it

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,630
and i had another opportunity it's okay i got that one too it's okay just chill out everyone

8
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,929
chill just chill out back here so that sniper is going for you he knows the changed disguise go

9
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:08,760
to a scout hide in the in the bush uh i should probably move here damn it this is bad this is

10
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:17,640
real bad actually not really i'm in a not terrible position because there's a i say that as a spy

11
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:26,280
okay i haven't really had an opportunity to say any words but yes the word i will say is yes at

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:34,969
the moment apparently you again where are you please don't tell me i'm not going to get that

13
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:44,579
where is he here i feel like he's dead ringering is that another one all i'm doing is reacting

14
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:51,799
i might be able to get this pyro and in fact we'll hopefully get couple here

15
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:58,549
there's spy checking which is a good opportunity for some kills

16
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:09,770
ah no no no no no no no get me out of there the shield spy never dies he always finds

17
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:16,759
your way does something spawn here i forget well it doesn't really matter because i'm in full

18
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:23,270
health anyways but something to talk about something to talk about i'll talk about something

19
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:32,580
in this video what the fuck is that is that what is that could i just see that shadow of the of a

20
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:43,400
spy i did yeah i could he had the same hat on that was really weird uh anyways halloween's coming up

21
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:51,770
and i have a halloween video that hopefully is going to get done and hopefully people think is

22
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:59,460
interesting and i'm not going to give you i'll give you one hint it has to do with iconic video

23
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:06,020
game characters as there's your hint what the fuck am i doing why did i just do that i just

24
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,680
jumped right down to everybody's face that was stupid i should get off of this why am i still

25
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:21,580
sniper that's very obvious oh shit hopefully he doesn't know he didn't good very very good

26
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:30,039
still alive too which is somewhat remarkable don't that yeah yeah yeah yeah you all know

27
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:35,159
yeah or do you okay well now you obviously know because i picked up the health

28
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:44,789
on the ammo i got like all this stuff hi hello he's gonna get killed by this

29
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,780

30
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,919
i need a plan of action here that plan of action is going to be just run straight at them

31
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,770
that's a pretty good idea right yeah apparently it was a really good idea

32
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,419
because i made it out of that no i didn't no i didn't actually thanks for the help you just

33

35
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:38,660

36
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:49,180
please don't hear that thank you for not hearing that what do you got that's a crit that's great

37
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:56,470
don't want to die from a crit still alive dude this is that i remember when i mentioned in the

38
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,120
beginning that i haven't played spy in a while like live don't ask me why i'm doing fairly

39
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:12,699
decently i haven't died this is just must be some type of fluke no where is he no don't shoot me

40
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:16,180
i will get you with this headshot when you turn when you come around this corner there to see

41
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:22,149
that do you see that i got him i got him on my head damn it somebody will finish him off no they

42
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:31,670
won't i will i will i don't even care i do care what am i talking about this is where we die

43
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:37,060
because i'm standing and totally still like a fucking idiot with the man melted the guy

44
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:46,500
man melted me and i died don't let him get it don't let him get it do not let them get this

45
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:54,339
under any circumstances get out of my way get out of my i don't want you to see me can i still get

46
00:05:54,339 --> 00:06:06,569
it okay hold back hold back here hold back hold back i'm just a pyro just a pyro all right we're

47
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:11,449
okay that guy's gonna get backstabbed no he's he's gonna freak out and he's gonna turn to kill that

48
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:18,949
spy thinking that i'm not a spy i will end up getting the kill oh that's really really annoying

49
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:28,680
he thought he got the kill on the spy but the spy there's two of us and you know he just don't get

50
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,470
spotted that's bad because now i just did like the i'm definitely a guaranteed spy move where i

51
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,459
looked at him and i went no i don't i spun around real fast but it's not gonna get me killed i don't

52
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:50,980
think not yet at least let's change speaking of spy let's disguise as a spy i'm okay with this and

53
00:06:50,980 --> 00:07:03,420
drop down get you and this guy too oh can we do this for another seven minutes i don't know but

54
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:15,259
i'm gonna go this way i want to wrap around to potentially don't don't don't holy shit why did

55
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:24,870
that not work i was like cut off by the door you are a spy who would win you cannot defeat me he's

56
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:34,139
where you're running where you're running man that was a spy v spy fight i liked i don't know why i

57
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,980
like to do that i like to activate the dead ringer jumping down but is the most obvious thing you

58
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:48,389
could like ever do just feels fun i'll get around him oh what am i god i'm breaking the rule here

59
00:07:48,389 --> 00:08:05,160
what just what what what what that hit him i refuse to believe that i should have just walked up and

60
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,189
stabbed him but i wanted to get the double ambassador headshot that was a stupid move

61
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:16,730
i was trying to get on like the highlight reel and i should have just like killed the damn guy

62
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:22,259
koda walked up and just stabbed him right in his like fucking butt cheeks but no i gotta get like

63
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:34,549
boom like no just get the sure thing germa there i go again come on

64
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:50,740
come on gibs what do you say drop down on somebody we held him for a long time but it's coming down

65
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,259
to like the last second here it's going to be the last minute they're going to get it to like right

66
00:08:54,259 --> 00:09:00,570
there and it's going to be either team's game i really don't know who at this point hey hey hey

67
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:09,720
well he pushed it pretty far for being one person on it for the remaining 60 seconds i really just

68
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,220
kind of want to protect this area i don't want anyone to jump down from here or something i think

69
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:25,539
we're going to be golden though i really do there is a scout look i'm pretending to push it with you

70
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:37,850
i for some reason thought that was over i don't know why holy shit you are a heavy they focused

71
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:46,809
on him 30 seconds now damn it it's all right though i think we got it as long as this guy

72
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:51,320
sticks around as long as these two guys stick around here i don't think they're going to get

73
00:09:51,320 --> 00:10:02,090
it and we win the game nice nice use of the charge shot 10 seconds i thought that was by

74
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:13,019
final push let's see if they can do anything with it otherwise we win the game hey overtime

75
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:22,009
three two one 62 points when the fuck did that happen
