00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,750
Hey what is going on guys, Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,349
Tonight by popular demand, I'm going to be playing as the medic class, showing you some things maybe

3
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:16,550
you didn't know before, some advanced techniques maybe I guess you could call it, how to do certain

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,429
things, why to do certain things in certain situations, playing on gold rush right now as

5
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:27,589
the regular Medigun medic with the crusaders crossbow and the amputator. You may be asking

6
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:32,710
Jerma why you're using those two items and if you do not know, when you put those two items on the

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:39,350
crossbow and the amputator, you get plus one extra health added per second on top of what you normally

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,670
get as a medic. So if you just want to play strict heal bot medic, which is what I'm doing right now,

9
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,869
you want to put those two items on because it just benefits you. If you want to play battle medic,

10
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:55,450
then yeah you might want to take these off, but this will just help you stay alive. So the first

11
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,409
medic tip I'm going to give you guys is probably the most important one. A lot of people still have

12
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:04,569
trouble with this and even though it seems kind of like a no-brainer, I'm just going to say it

13
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:12,599
anyways, make sure you heal everybody. Heal the spies, heal the snipers, make sure you don't neglect

14
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:17,879
anyone because I've seen it a lot. I've seen medics that just avoid all the spies, all the snipers,

15
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,560
ah you don't need it, you're a sniper, I'm not going to give it to you, but you really do. You

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,680
really have to give it to them because remember guys, this is Team Fortress 2. This isn't heavy

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,799
medic, heavy demo man 2. You want to make sure you spread the heals out as much as you can,

18
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:39,000
especially other medics. Insanely important guys, overheal your medics that are on your team because

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,359
they are the only thing that can heal anyone, unless of course it's an engineer's dispenser,

20
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,239
which you can't heal a dispenser with your beam, so the only other option is to heal the engineer,

21
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:55,159
which is still very, very important, going back to not neglecting anyone. You want everybody to

22
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,700
be overhealed. You want your brother, your sister, your neighbor, your neighbor's cat,

23
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,900
your neighbor's cat's boyfriend, your boyfriend's sister's brother-in-law. You want every single

24
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,340
person on your team to be as high health as they possibly can, and just go ahead and freeze it right

25
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,620
there for a second. Thanks buddy. So right now I want to talk about a few different Uber situations,

26
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,979
when to use your Uber, why to use it, what type of Ubers these are. So let's start with the first

27
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:32,580
one here. This is going to be called my medics cooler than your medic buddy Uber. So what this

28
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:39,180
entails is take a look at this heavy medic pair right here, right here. They are both on fire.

29
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,939
They are both hanging out together, but they don't pop their Uber because they don't have one. This

30
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:51,939
is a great situation to be in because if you can tell, if you know the other medic does not have an

31
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:57,379
Uber and you have one, you have a strict advantage and you can determine the outcome of the fight

32
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:03,159
because we can pop our Uber and they will just get smoked. So the way to tell this is like I said,

33
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,280
they were both on fire. They're both taking heavy amounts of damage. Usually in this situation,

34
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,879
a medic will pop the Uber to protect himself and to protect obviously the person he's healing.

35
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,280
So us knowing that I popped the Uber to protect both of us from any incoming fire,

36
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,370
they both get exploded by the stickies. Victory for the blue team. So the next one I'm going to

37
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,909
cover is something I like to call the team Uber and it's pretty self-explanatory, the title in

38
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:39,210
itself. You're going to be Ubering the entire team at the same time. Why would you ever do this and

39
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:44,409
why would you ever need to do this? Here is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.

40
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:48,330
We're all trying to get out of the spawn. We're being spawn camped. We're being crushed by the

41
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:55,050
enemy team and a pyro comes up behind us and starts to spray everybody. I have my Uber.

42
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:02,650
I pop it and here we go. Watch what I do. I turn around and just start right clicking on everyone.

43
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,569
So at the same time, there's about five or six people that have an Uber, which allows us to push

44
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:13,539
out of the spawn and get the hell out of there. So the mechanics behind this and the reasoning

45
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:21,779
behind this is because guys, one second in Team Fortress is a very long time. One full two seconds,

46
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:30,139
one second, one, two of taking absolute zero damage is a huge deal in this game. If you can

47
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:35,100
protect your teammates for a couple seconds just getting out of that spawn door and getting out of

48
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:41,819
the spawn area, you'll have way more potential than you ever did if you didn't use this technique.

49
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,339
The next Uber technique I want to talk about is something I like to call the transition Uber.

50
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:51,740
How this one works is this is pretty similar to the last one. The only difference is you're going

51
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,540
to be doing it to less people. So instead of Ubering five or six people, you're going to be

52
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:02,420
doing it to two people and you're not going to be doing it at the same time. This is the century

53
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,060
killer guys. This is a great way to take out a pesky century. If you can communicate with your

54
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,540
teammates, if they know what's going on, these guys didn't. I did this pretty much on my own,

55
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,319
but if you can communicate with people, you can get double fire on a century and pretty much

56
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:23,430
guaranteeing its destruction. Coming back to reality here now, just wanted to give you guys

57
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,149
some of my techniques, some of the ways that I play medic. Hopefully you can see some information

58
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:32,709
in those. If you don't end up doing them, that's fine. Just as long as you take something out of

59
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:39,000
it. That's all I care about. Troll Uber right here. I went to Uber that spy just for a joke

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,500
because I knew we were going to win. We were rolling this entire time. So I get second place

61
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,579
on the scoreboard as a medic, which always feels good. It always feels good to be number one or

62
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:52,519
number two as a medic. Makes you feel nice. So thank you everybody so much for watching. You

63
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:57,240
know, I really do appreciate it. If you liked this video or if it helped you, please by all means,

64
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,959
shoot me a like and I will see you all next time. Take care everybody.
