00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,019
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Enlighten.

2
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:22,019
This week's Enlighten is going to be a live Enlighten. I'm going to make a park in RollerCoaster Tycoon 3.

3
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,019
Now you're probably wondering, Jerma, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is not that old of a game.

4
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,019
So why are you doing Enlighten on this?

5
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:37,189
Well, with the recent disaster of the SimCity launch, I figured a lot of people are trying to find different city simulators,

6
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:45,189
trying to find different ways to get their fix for micromanagement god simulators, and this one is my all-time favorite.

7
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:51,369
It's going to be a lot of fun to reminisce during the gameplay while I'm making my park, while I'm making my people happy,

8
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:54,369
getting them burgers, getting them fries, getting them cokes and soft drinks.

9
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:59,369
If you've never played RCT, go get it right now. It's on good old games, it's on Steam.

10
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:05,370
RollerCoaster this one's on Steam, I believe for 30 bucks right now. It probably will go on sale at some point.

11
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,370
But it is a filling of the void for a lot of you SimCity guys.

12
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,370
So, let's get started here. I'm going to clap into the microphone accidentally, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,370
I'm going to do just a live playthrough of me making a park.

14
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,370
If you guys like it, please let me know, show some support if you want to see more of this,

15
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,370
and I'll see you guys all next time.

16
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,370
And of course, take care everybody.

17
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:09,319
Alright, well anyways, let's get these freeloaders out of here.

18
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,319
Nevermind, you can stay.

19
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,879
Let's start building this thing.

20
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,569
Park is closed, yeah. See you later people.

21
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:22,310
Let's go straight up here.

22
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,319
I don't want to go too far out because look at how huge this is.

23
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,560
So I made a custom scenario just to play.

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,800
I made just like, you know, no BS here in the beginning, just my own park. I can do whatever I want.

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
I think I made it a little too big.

26
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,360
But whatever, we're going to make this the best huge park ever.

27
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,360
So I want a ride to be here, here.

28
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,979
Let's just give some markers here.

29
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,699
I want more people to come in, I want there to be concession stands over this way.

30
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:59,300
So I want this to be...

31
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,569
So this is going to be the food court, right here.

32
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:05,810
This is where everybody's going to have to go to get food.

33
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,810
Whether you want burgers, fries, like I said in the beginning, this is where you're going to have to go.

34
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,810
So let's go ahead and make some of that stuff.

35
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,569
Food. Bison burgers.

36
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,319
Burgers. I don't want any weird, weird stuff.

37
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,159
Let's just get regular burgers.

38
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,159
So go right here.

39
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,229
We need some drinks to go with that.

40
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:29,139
Where are all the drinks?

41
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:31,500
Oh, actually fries, too.

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,620
Fries.

43
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,789
There's a lot of options here.

44
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:40,789
Oh, it's because I have all the expansion packs.

45
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,789
If you're wondering where like all this, like some of the stuff is coming from,

46
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:45,789
you can see I have like the wild expansion pack.

47
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:47,789
I have the soaked expansion pack.

48
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:50,669
Wait, is this like chocolate milkshakes?

49
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:54,300
Hell yeah, we're putting chocolate milkshakes in my pack.

50
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,419
Okay.

51
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,419
So that's all. You get burgers, fries, and a chocolate milkshake.

52
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,139
That's all you get.

53
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,659
I want shops over there, too.

54
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:08,659
Oh, here's the drinks. Here we go.

55
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:11,539
Oh, coffee. Definitely coffee.

56
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:12,539
If you want some coffee.

57
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,159
There it is.

58
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,979
That's a very odd looking place, by the way.

59
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:16,980
Look at this.

60
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,899
Is that where they get the beans?

61
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,910
That's kind of gross. What happens when it rains?

62
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,910
Floundering Ferry.

63
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,910
Merry-go-round.

64
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,910
Got to have a merry-go-round.

65
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,910
Oh, my goodness.

66
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,910
It's so dark in this park.

67
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,910
I don't have any lights.

68
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,220
Oh, no.

69
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,899
Nobody's going to be able to see.

70
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:38,980
There's the entrance and the exit.

71
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,790
Hey, welcome to the park.

72
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,790
Hope you like pitch blackness.

73
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,250
I need some lights.

74
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,250
Hold on. Where do I go to the lights?

75
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,050
Germaland.

76
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:59,610
Germaland is officially open to the public for eight bucks.

77
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,610
You get to come in.

78
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,610
You get to take a right, eat food, and then go on a merry-go-round.

79
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,610
And then you get the fuck out of here.

80
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:12,279
How disappointed.

81
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,279
How disappointed would you be if you came to this park?

82
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,420
This park sucks.

83
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,360
Come on, let's go.

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Germaland's officially open.

85
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,360
We're like the thousands of people I want to get in here.

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,069
All right, now that that's open.

87
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:27,069
Wait, I need to make these.

88
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,069
I need to open these.

89
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:30,379
These are just all closed.

90
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:34,500
All right, there we go.

91
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,699
How much money?

92
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:37,699
How much money?

93
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:38,699
I want this to be...

94
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,920
No, you can just do default for now.

95
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,160
Standard coffee is $1.

96
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Roast coffee is $1.50.

97
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Okay, I'll keep the default prices for now.

98
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,339
If they become really popular,

99
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:52,339
that's when I'll start to really jack up the prices.

100
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,339
And suck everybody dry.

101
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:58,750
I still don't have any guests,

102
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,939
except for this dude right here.

103
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,939
Are you about to go ride this ride?

104
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:11,259
Look, Grandpa's going to go ride the merry-go-round by himself.

105
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:13,889
He's not really going to do that, is he?

106
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:16,220
He really is.

107
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,569
What?

108
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:20,569
This is the park inspector.

109
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:23,569
You are wasting electricity right now.

110
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:26,060
Did he pay for this?

111
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,259
He had to have paid for it, right?

112
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:34,660
No, he didn't even pay for it.

113
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,660
This guy didn't even pay for it.

114
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Look, $0.00.

115
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,029
You scumbag.

116
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:41,029
Hold on a second.

117
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,779
Let's see.

118
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,300
Oh, here they come.

119
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,800
Here come the people.

120
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,230
Here come the people.

121
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,230
Here comes the one guy.

122
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:56,189
Nothing really for you to do down that way, dude.

123
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:57,189
He's going to get lost.

124
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:01,519
Come on, come on, to the concession stand

125
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:08,519
where we sell coffee, burgers, fries, milkshakes, coffee, milkshakes, burgers, fries, milkshakes, coffee, fries.

126
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,519
Oh, yeah, you know you want to go in there.

127
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:13,519
Take your little shit kids in there with you.

128
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,910
Dude, this lady's more excited than the kids.

129
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,910
She's like leaving her children behind.

130
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,600
What a psycho.

131
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,209
Let's get some more stuff built here.

132
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:30,500
Right there.

133
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,220
And regular path, asphalt.

134
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,899
There we go.

135
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:39,910
This ride is going to be $2.00.

136
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,910
Here we go.

137
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,819
Open it up.

138
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,579
Chair swing.

139
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:50,199
Oh, one of the really cool features about Rollercoaster Tycoon 3,

140
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,199
you can ride your rides.

141
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,199
You can get in your rollercoaster that you built,

142
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,199
or like this.

143
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,199
Ready?

144
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,439
Let's see if I can do it on the stupid friggin' Ferris wheel.

145
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,649
Let's see if I can ride it.

146
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:10,709
Oh, yay.

147
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,420
I'm having so much fun, mummy.

148
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,100
Why is the ride not starting?

149
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,360
I want to ride the ride, mummy.

150
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,970
The ride isn't starting.

151
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:33,179
Ah.

152
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:39,179
Okay, that's enough of that.

153
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,179
Oh, wait, wait.

154
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,350
I just heard, I just heard a money.

155
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,620
Who's going to ride the ride with me?

156
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,860
Oh, hey, let's go.

157
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,419
Which one are you going to get on?

158
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:50,419
Are you going to get on that?

159
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:51,419
Oh, here we go.

160
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:53,940
Here we go.

161
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,940
Here we go.

162
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,110
Here we go.

163
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,110
So excited, guys.

164
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:04,419
I'm about to ride the merry-go-round.

165
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,419
Why is nobody riding this ride?

166
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:09,230
This is one of the only things you can do in this whole park,

167
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,230
and nobody wants to ride it.

168
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,299
You guys are assholes.

169
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:14,299
Is it because there's too much money?

170
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:15,299
That's it?

171
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:17,860
That's the whole ride?

172
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,860
That was 10 seconds.

173
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,450
Look at this guy again.

174
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,450
The same dude.

175
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,450
The same, the same guy that's supposed to be, like,

176
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,450
inspecting my park is riding the merry-go-round again.

177
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,750
He's on the merry-go-round again by himself.

178
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,759
This guy is a freak show.

179
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,759
What's wrong with this guy?

180
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,830
I need to make some more stuff.

181
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,830
What are people saying about this park?

182
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,830
Do they hate this place?

183
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,200
Let's see.

184
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,950
Is someone watching me?

185
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,950
I hope it isn't too scary.

186
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,509
Talking about the merry-go-round, I guess.

187
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:50,070
I'm not hungry.

188
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,070
I'm not hungry.

189
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,070
I want to go on more rides.

190
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,070
I want to go on something more thrilling

191
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,070
than the merry-go-round.

192
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,950
What about you?

193
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,750
Where are all the rides?

194
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,750
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,700
I'm working on it.

196
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
We'll do another ride.

197
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,789
Here we go.

198
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:09,789
Thrill rides.

199
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:10,789
All right, you want a thrill ride?

200
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:11,970
I'll give you the disco.

201
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,100
I'm going to put the disco right here.

202
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,789
Yeah, right next to the merry-go-round.

203
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:22,570
That's not too bad.

204
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:28,440
That's not a bad place for that.

205
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Wink, wink, wink.

206
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,029
And then what's with the flickering screen?

207
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:37,230
I don't think this game was meant to be recorded.

208
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,049
It's going, like, every few minutes.

209
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,049
Open this up.

210
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:43,610
Are we closed right now?

211
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,610
Yeah, the park is closed.

212
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,220
Admission.

213
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,220
I think these rides are too expensive.

214
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
I really think that's the problem.

215
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,220
People, like, don't want to ride a merry-go-round

216
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,220
for, like, three bucks.

217
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,220
How much did I make this?

218
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,799
Don't even have a bathroom.

219
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,809
Should I make these toilets, like, pay toilets?

220
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:04,620
How much of an ass would I be

221
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,620
to make these $0.10 to use the bathroom?

222
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,759
People would have to do it

223
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,759
and force people to have to spend $0.10

224
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,759
to go to the bathroom.

225
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,059
We're doing it.

226
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:17,389
Hey, if you want to go to the bathroom,

227
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,389
you don't want to spend $0.10?

228
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:20,389
There's, like, a Dunkin' Donuts

229
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,389
three miles down the street.

230
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,389
Yeah, good luck.

231
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,980
Not one person has bought anything

232
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
from any of these stalls.

233
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,980
Why?

234
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,860
What the hell did I do wrong?

235
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,019
What?

236
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,019
Are they too expensive?

237
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:44,789
Maybe there's not enough pickles.

238
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:48,850
All right, we'll drop the price.

239
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,850
Standard burger's gonna...

240
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,850
We'll drop it all by, like, $0.30.

241
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,460
I'm probably gonna lose money on this,

242
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,460
but you know what?

243
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,590
It's gotta happen.

244
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,590
People aren't buying anything.

245
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,049
Who comes to a theme park

246
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:04,049
and doesn't buy, like, a cheeseburger?

247
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:06,220
All right, that's right, everybody,

248
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,220
because it's always too expensive.

249
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,360
The only thing I ever buy at a theme park

250
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
is probably fried dough.

251
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,649
Small bag...

252
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,649
For $0.40, nobody is buying Hershey Kisses.

253
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:19,080
You guys, seriously,

254
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
that's like a stick of friggin' gum,

255
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
and you're not even gonna buy it?

256
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,730
All right, all right,

257
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,730
we got a pretty good audience right here.

258
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,730
Look at these people,

259
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,730
like, all ready to roll.

260
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,029
We got birds over here.

261
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:30,029
Look at these birds.

262
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:33,549
No one's riding this ride.

263
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:35,429
Do you people know this ride exists?

264
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:38,629
Maybe my pathing sucks.

265
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,789
With drastic, drastic measures,

266
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:43,789
we're gonna build a roller coaster.

267
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:48,549
The facelift or the fear slinger?

268
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:49,549
Let's do the facelift.

269
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:50,549
Look at this thing.

270
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:53,500
62 mile-per-hour speeds?

271
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,799
You better believe it.

272
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,299
Where are we putting this thing?

273
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:59,470
Holy shit, this thing is huge!

274
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,299
Uh, it's going right here.

275
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,470
It's gonna go over the swing ride.

276
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,100
Wait, where's the, uh...

277
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,659
Let me see where the entrance is.

278
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:10,659
It's over there, I think.

279
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:12,600
Bang, there we go.

280
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,419
There's...

281
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,419
Wow, look at those shadows!

282
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:17,720
Oh!

283
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,179
Those shadows are so ugly!

284
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:24,210
Entrance is over here.

285
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,580
Let's go with...

286
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,679
Let's do the exit first.

287
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,370
Just because...

288
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,370
Just because...

289
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:40,750
People are gonna have to walk a mile

290
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,750
to get to this damn thing.

291
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,659
You don't have enough funds?

292
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:46,659
I don't have enough money?

293
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,919
I can't even open this thing!

294
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:49,919
How much was this?

295
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,139
Was this roller coaster, like, all of my money?

296
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,139
Oh, my goodness.

297
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,139
Oh, good thing...

298
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,139
Good thing Venom from Spider-Man

299
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,139
has taken over my park.

300
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,450
Look at this symbiotes suit

301
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,450
that's literally taking over my entire park.

302
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,710
Are you guys ready?

303
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,710
We're gonna do testing.

304
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,889
We're gonna ride my roller coaster, baby.

305
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,889
It's an inverted coaster.

306
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:13,889
Oh!

307
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,960
Whoa!

308
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,289
Look at this.

309
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:19,289
This is the coolest part,

310
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:20,289
because you can build your own coaster.

311
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:23,289
You can build your own coaster from scratch

312
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:25,289
with all these cool things,

313
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,289
and you can ride it.

314
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:28,980
You can look down at your park over there.

315
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,980
I know mine sucks,

316
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,980
but you know what?

317
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,980
Here we go.

318
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,600
Oh, my God!

319
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,970
Whoa!

320
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,399
Whoa!

321
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,149
The twist!

322
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,149
You're in the twist!

323
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
This is so cool.
