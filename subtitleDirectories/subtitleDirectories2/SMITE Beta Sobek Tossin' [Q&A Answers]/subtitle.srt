1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,630
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Smite gameplay.

2
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:22,629
Well, not really a Smite commentary, but it's a Smite gameplay and my Q&A answers portion of my Q&A video week.

3
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:28,629
I'm not even sure what you would call it. I know that saying Q&A answers is kind of like just saying questions and answers answers.

4
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:33,869
However you want to say it, this is where I answer your questions from my previous video.

5
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,869
So I'll get started right off the bat, but first I want to talk about Smite for one second, less than one minute.

6
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:44,869
This game is a hell of a lot of fun. If you are not into like League of Legends or you're not into Han or anything like that,

7
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:54,179
I'm not that guy. I am very bad at games like that. I cannot wrap my head around all the strategy and all the tactics that are involved in a MOBA game.

8
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:59,179
But something about this one in particular, it's just so much action. There's so much stuff to do.

9
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:05,180
You move with WASD, you click to attack. It's all skill shots. It's just, it doesn't feel like a MOBA.

10
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,180
It feels like a death match. It's very one-on-one, very, very intimate, very...

11
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,180
Now what am I saying here? Like it's very intimate.

12
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,930
But seriously, I've never been into games like this, but I absolutely adore this and I'm going to play it for a while probably.

13
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,930
You'll probably see a lot more content of this as well as I get better.

14
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,930
This is also in Closed Beta and I'm playing as Sobek, one of the unlockable characters.

15
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,930
And you unlock characters by getting favor. It's kind of like experience and you use experience to buy things.

16
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,930
But I will get into that a totally different time. Just enjoy that in the background while I do the Q&A.

17
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:44,299
So question number one was arguably the most asked question. There's not one person in particular that asked this question.

18
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:51,299
But it is, do you have a girlfriend or are you married? Do you have a wife or anything like that?

19
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,299
And I've answered this in previous Q&As, but there's a lot more new people since some of these old Q&As.

20
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:01,299
So the answer is no. I do not currently have a girlfriend. I have not had a girlfriend in quite a while.

21
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,299
It's been at least a couple years since I've been in a relationship.

22
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:11,300
But it's not like I'm not actively looking. Let's be really totally honest with ourselves here.

23
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,300
Nobody really actively goes to pursue a boyfriend or a girlfriend.

24
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,300
It just kind of happens, at least in the most part.

25
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Every prior experience I've had with a relationship with the opposite sex, it's always been,

26
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,300
Well, I'm in the room and you're in the room and we both looked at each other and I like you and you like me. Let's date.

27
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,300
I mean, there's never like a situation where you're going actively looking for somebody.

28
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Like, hmm, I wonder if there's going to be a girlfriend in this movie theater. Let's go find her.

29
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,469
Like, it doesn't really happen that way. But I mean, sometimes it can.

30
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:46,469
But I'll just get back to what I was saying. The answer is no, I do not currently have a girlfriend.

31
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:51,099
Second question comes from a bunch of people as well. No person in particular that said this.

32
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,099
What is the mic that you use?

33
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:58,099
So I've used a lot of different mics in the course of this last year I've been on YouTube.

34
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:04,099
I started with a Samson CO1U USB, which is great. It's a really good microphone. I really highly recommend it.

35
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:10,639
I then moved on to a Yeti Pro, which actually broke and I didn't do anything.

36
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,639
I don't know what happened to it, but I was, I don't know. I'm not going to really...

37
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,639
That's a no comment for me when it comes to Yetis and Yeti Pros.

38
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,639
But right now I'm using an MXL USB006.

39
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,639
And it's been pretty flawless ever since I took it out of the box, so I highly recommend this microphone.

40
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,639
I think it's only 90 bucks on Amazon, or maybe less than that. It's like the 80 to 120 dollar range.

41
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:40,639
The thing is amazing. So if you're looking for a good microphone, I would suggest the CO1U or the MXL USB006.

42
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,069
So the next question comes from Supercow376.

43
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:51,069
And he or she asks, did you ever play Super Smash Brothers?

44
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:55,069
And I could go off on a five hour tangent on this game.

45
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,069
But Super Smash Brothers is probably my favorite fighting game ever made.

46
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:03,310
It is one of my favorite games really of all time in regards to fun factor and multiplayer.

47
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:10,310
I played that game in college. Super Smash Brothers Melee, Super Smash Brothers 64, and Brawl.

48
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,550
That was my college. I used to sit with all my dorm mates, all my roommates.

49
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,550
We would sit and just do tournaments for like six hours every night.

50
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,550
It was so much fun.

51
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:26,550
And speaking of Super Smash Brothers, I cannot wait until they finally come out with Super Smash Brothers 4,

52
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,550
which is going to be what for the Wii U I think it is.

53
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:36,550
I am anxiously awaiting the SmashDojo.com to come back up and we can speculate on all the new characters.

54
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,550
And that's pretty much why I'm going to be getting a Wii U at launch, is for Super Smash Brothers 4.

55
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,550
So to answer your question, yes, I absolutely adore that series. I love that game. Super Smash Brothers.

56
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,300
So the next question is from MattTheWing525.

57
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,300
If I'm mispronouncing your names, guys, I'm really sorry about that.

58
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,300
But his question is actually a pretty funny one.

59
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,910
I heard a rumor that Star is related to you. Is that true?

60
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,910
The quick answer is no, but the long answer is who told you that?

61
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,910
Where did you get that information?

62
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,910
I mean, I guess Star comes down to Boston all the time.

63
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,910
Every couple of months he'll make a trip down here.

64
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,910
But no, he is not my cousin or my brother or something like that.

65
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,910
I just found that really funny.

66
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,910
But in the comment section of this video, Matt, paste where you got that source, where you got that info.

67
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,910
I'm very curious to know.

68
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,600
So the next question is from Lazerick.

69
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,600
And he or she asks, would you ever want to have kids?

70
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,839
Now, this is kind of a tough question, not because I don't think I can answer it, but because I really just don't know.

71
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,019
I'm getting to that point now, guys, where I'm almost 27 years old.

72
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:49,019
And I'm almost expected to start to get married and start having kids and start a family.

73
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:52,019
But I'm just not ready for that. I'm afraid to grow up.

74
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,019
I don't want to be some guy with kids.

75
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:59,019
I want to be like a young man and be a strong young man.

76
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:02,019
I don't know what that means, but I don't really want them right now.

77
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,019
I don't really have a plan to have any children.

78
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:11,019
If I ever do have kids, it'll probably be when I'm in my mid-30s, or I don't even know.

79
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:15,019
I can't really make an assessment on that because I'm just not sure.

80
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:17,019
But do I want them? Sure.

81
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:19,019
Do I know when I want them? No.

82
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:21,019
I guess that's the real answer.

83
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:24,699
Next up is a question from The Purplefish12.

84
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,699
And he or she asks, what kind of car, if any, do you drive?

85
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:31,699
And nobody's really ever asked this question before.

86
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:37,699
I drive a Chevy Malibu, a 2003, I think, a 2002 maybe.

87
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:40,699
It is pure gold, Midas Gold, baby.

88
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,699
It's a nice car. It's just a regular town kind of economy car.

89
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:45,699
And I really wouldn't have it any other way.

90
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,699
I'm not the type of guy that wants to drive around in a Ferrari or like a Lamborghini or something like that,

91
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,699
because I'm afraid to drive those cars.

92
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:57,699
I've seen those cars driven, and I've seen the condition that a lot of those cars are in.

93
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:00,699
They are pristine. I wouldn't be able to handle it.

94
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:06,879
I would keep that car in my garage, and I would probably never drive it for any circumstance whatsoever,

95
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,879
mainly because of the fear of it getting a scratch or something, and they're just so expensive.

96
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,879
I'll stick with my little economy car. That's good for me.

97
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:22,699
So next up is Faze7963, and he or she asks, how did you meet Burger Boy?

98
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,939
So Burger Boy, if you don't know who Burger Boy is, he's like my best friend of the whole world.

99
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:30,939
And he's in a lot of videos. He's been in a couple of the milestone videos.

100
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:34,939
He was Santa Claus for the Christmas video, and he's just a really good buddy of mine.

101
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:36,939
Where did I meet him?

102
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:40,110
Well, that's a pretty simple answer. He lives right down the street from me.

103
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,110
We grew up together. I've known him for more than 20 years.

104
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,110
Went to the same kindergarten, same middle school, same high school, same everything.

105
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:52,110
And he's just been that guy that's been down the street where I can just walk to his house if I really wanted to.

106
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,110
It's less than a mile away.

107
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,110
And I mean, it was just easy to get to his house. We shared the same interests.

108
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,110
He loves video games. I love video games. We both played baseball together.

109
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,110
So it was just easy. We were perfect fit. Perfect fit, baby.

110
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,290
So the next question is from Dollory.

111
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:11,290
And Dollory asks, what is your most played game of all time?

112
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,459
Now, I like this question because this is not what is your favorite game of all time.

113
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,459
What is your least favorite game of all time?

114
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,459
It's just what is your most played game?

115
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,459
And that is probably going to be World of Warcraft.

116
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:26,459
I put, if I were to do the math right now, it would probably make me puke.

117
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:31,829
But I have probably put at least three or four thousand hours into that game.

118
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:34,009
At least, at the very least.

119
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:38,009
Coming in at a close second, though, is Team Fortress 2, I would have to assume.

120
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:42,009
Because I've been playing this game since God the Beta, and it's been a long time.

121
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:47,009
At least a couple thousand hours into the series of Team Fortress, including Team Fortress Classic.

122
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:53,009
So I'd say Team Fortress as a series and World of Warcraft are my most played games.

123
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:57,500
Next up is from Incantare Fox, and they ask,

124
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,500
how do you feel your commentary style has changed since the start?

125
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,289
And that can be answered in one word, and one word only, comfortable.

126
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:10,289
That's really, you have to get comfortable, and you have to really get confident.

127
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:11,289
You've got to sit down.

128
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:15,289
And that's the best advice I can give to any aspiring YouTube commentator,

129
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:18,289
is just be as comfortable and as confident as you can.

130
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:21,289
And whatever ways you can do that, whatever techniques you can find,

131
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:25,289
or relaxing things you can do to yourself to make it so when you sit in front of this microphone,

132
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:28,289
you can just go and talk about anything and everything.

133
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:30,289
That is what you have to do.

134
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:33,289
And it's very, very difficult. It can be hard to find that thing.

135
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:37,289
But once you find it, it'll just make you that much more comfortable.

136
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:42,460
So I could go on with that for a long time, but I'm going to bring up the next question,

137
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,899
which might be the last one of this video.

138
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,899
And that is, where do you see yourself in one year, five years, ten years?

139
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,899
I got a lot of these different, like, oh, what do you think will happen on YouTube next year?

140
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,899
Or where do you see yourself in five years?

141
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,899
And it's really hard to answer those questions.

142
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:00,899
And what I really hope is in the next five years, the next ten years, one year,

143
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,899
whatever it happens, the future of my life, I just hope I'm happy.

144
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:11,070
You know, that's really all I really ask is that I'm happy and my friends are happy, my family's happy,

145
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,070
all you guys are all happy.

146
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,070
It's hard to predict what's going to happen.

147
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,070
Nobody can really have a magic crystal ball and say, well, in five years, Jerma,

148
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,070
you're going to have two hundred billion dollars in your bank account

149
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,500
and you're going to own Ben and Jerry's ice cream factory.

150
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
I mean, nobody really can predict that.

151
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,500
But I just hope that I can get to a position where I'm happy with my life

152
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,500
and I'm just here and I'm still here and I live a healthy life, as healthy as I can.

153
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,500
And that's really all I could ask for.

154
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,940
But that is going to wrap up the video, guys.

155
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,940
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

156
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,940
I'll probably do another one of these in a week or two.

157
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,110
Probably change this time slot, not going to be on Friday night,

158
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,110
but I will get that done soon.

159
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,110
Again, thank you so much for your questions.

160
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,110
I really appreciate it, guys. There were a lot of good ones.

161
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,110
And I will see you guys all next time.

162
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,110
And of course, take care, everybody.
