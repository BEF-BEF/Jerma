00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:12,500
Hey, what's happening everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,699
I'm gonna be playing as the soldier with the black box, but who cares? Because there's something way

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,420
more important to discuss and talk about, and that's the fact that over the last couple of days we

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:29,269
have heard some news trickled down from the competitive community that TF2 eventually here

5
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:35,289
is going to be getting a matchmaking system put into the game. And my reaction to this is,

6
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:42,570
I'm sure a lot of your reactions to the same exact news, it's about damn time. It's taken Valve,

7
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,990
what, like eight years or something to figure out that there is a whole community around competitive

8
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,789
that want this, that have wanted this for a long time, and even the people like me that aren't

9
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:57,909
into competitive really at all are excited for this update as well because it allows everybody

10
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:03,159
to play the game that they want to play. Because as it stands right now, Team Fortress 2 has a lot

11
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:07,239
of servers, right? Some of them are geared towards more serious, some of them are Valve

12
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,959
servers. A lot of the Valve servers that people play on are just extremely reliable, and they're

13
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,079
always there, and it's just easy to fall into a Valve server. It just is. But whatever server

14
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:24,569
you happen to play on, 90% of your Team Fortress 2 in-game time will be on an open public game

15
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:31,500
server, and TF2 is an incredibly unique game where in any of these given places, in any of these given

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,420
servers, there's like four or five different types of people playing the game. Maybe you've got like

17
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,780
two pyros that just installed the game 10 minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're walking

18
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,859
around spraying shit, and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might

19
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,579
be going backwards to the other point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a

20
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:57,500
scout that has a hail zone scatter gun. He's on his 18th kill of a 17 kill streak. He just got 18.

21
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,180
He's going, oh, I just got 18. Sick. He runs up the stairs. He's trying his ass off. He's dodging

22
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,019
like, oh, the sentry almost got me. He looks to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge,

23
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,819
and there's two sandwich heavies having a fucking picnic. So he stops for a second. He goes,

24
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,500
two, and he walks forward and gets blown up out of the next door by a soldier's rocket, and he

25
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,469
rages in the chat, or he sits and sulks in his chair and goes, what the fuck is going on? The

26
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:26,710
two sandwich heavies then decide it's time to move their picnic. There's ants. There's ants here,

27
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,990
honey. I want to get out of here. So they get up. They pack up their sandwiches. They pack up

28
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,789
their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the fuck they're eating. They get up and they

29
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,710
walk out the door to go towards red because they think that's spot near like the A point for red.

30
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,750
It's pretty good. They walk out the door and they see four level three sentry guns pointing at them.

31
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,349
They get shot a million times and blow up. There's like nine engineers running around swinging their

32
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:49,189
wrenches in random directions, and then they get mad, and they just say, we're just trying to have

33
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:53,349
a fucking picnic here. What the hell's going on? The blue scout at this point respawns,

34
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,270
and he walks by the at least three or four statues because we all know there's at least

35
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,830
four people AFK in spawn when you play this game. You go by the museum of people standing still.

36
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,669
So he walks out the door and he readies his weapon. He's ready. I'm going to get another

37
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:10,310
20 kill streak. Just you watch, Gavin. I'm going to praise Gavin. And he goes forward, he runs,

38
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,949
and he starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a spy that's been sitting with a cloak and dagger

39
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:22,090
in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds. So there's like four separate video games being

40
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:29,080
played in the same server at the same time there. And I've been all those people. I have been every

41
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,419
single person I listed there and I talked about. I've been them. I've wanted to play and try really

42
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,620
hard and get a good score. I've been the dipshit throwing sandwiches around or like being a spy

43
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,219
and like cloak and daggering and just messing around. We've all done weird shit like that.

44
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:46,389
We all think this game is amazing. That's why there's so many ways to play it. And there's so

45
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:52,780
many different people that play that the variety there makes it so you could be in the same place

46
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,300
and be wanting to do completely different things than somebody else that's on the other team or

47
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:02,599
even on your own team. So having a matchmaking system will split up these entities. The new

48
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,639
players can play in a random server and not have to worry about some guy that has 10,000 hours in

49
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,639
the game killing him every two seconds. The people that want to throw sandwiches at each other can

50
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,040
throw sandwiches at each other. They won't queue up for the matchmaking to play sandwich heavy.

51
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,220
It's just going to be good for everybody, especially if the process to join a queue for

52
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,220
matchmaking is as painless as possible. It could be a button you press and it'll put you in a queue.

53
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,180
And if it doesn't take like more than five to ten minutes to get in a game, so many more people will

54
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:38,540
be inclined to use it. And competitive can grow. And wanting to be good at TF2 will grow a little

55
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:45,220
bit. It would be crazy to see that because it's been like almost 10 years for a community like

56
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,420
this. It blows my mind every day guys. It seriously does. That TF2 is like people are still this

57
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:57,639
dedicated and they still... This would be a fucking one for the history books. If 10 years later TF2

58
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,819
will have a resurgence in competitive, like 10 fucking years later, it would just be cool to see

59
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:09,589
it happen. As long as the system in place was any good. Which is the last thing we're going to talk

60
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:16,019
about here in this video. Will it be good? Not necessarily will it be good. I hope it's good.

61
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:21,379
Because there is a huge potential here for this to go in one of two different ways.

62
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:30,040
And the first way is Man vs Machine 2.0. You just get into gigantic dump queue and maybe you're

63
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,740
gonna get into a Man vs Machine game with a bunch of random people. I don't want that. I really don't

64
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,300
want that. If that's what it is, at least it's a step in the right direction. But I really hope

65
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:46,180
it's a realized thing. With a ranking system, actual stats you can see, potentially leaderboards,

66
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:54,500
top players, separate queues for Highlander, 6v6, 1v1, ulti duo. Imagine the possibilities.

67
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,259
And imagine the shot in the arm this could give this game if it's done right. And if it isn't

68
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:06,920
done right, if it is done in this sort of gigantic Man vs Machine dump queue, then I'm just not so

69
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,920
sure I'm gonna care that much about it. But we're gonna have to see. We're gonna have to wait and

70
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,399
see. I know as much as you guys do at this point. And over the next couple of days, over the next

71
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,680
couple of weeks, I'm sure we'll hear a lot more about it. And I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm a

72
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,579
pessimistic excited. Because I don't want to get my hopes up for this. But anyways, that's gonna

73
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:31,189
wrap it up, guys. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. We'll see

74
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:34,310
what happens. Take care, everybody. And goodbye.
