is that oh yeah he's getting down I have never seen that before it's just

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,960

9
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,670
uber oh hell yeah I've never done that before it looks very difficult it can

10
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,430
get pretty crazy because I mean you can you can end up having an uber for a full

11
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,079
two or three minutes on each side it's pretty insane all right grab that health

12
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:25,109

double X Frank was not having any of that one all right double X Frank that's

17
00:01:52,079 --> 00:02:03,760
a perfect name yeah nice good girl why would a pyro just be sitting there yeah

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,439
true they should be herping and derping

19
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:14,960
somewhere this looks like it might just be a GG right here yeah it's kind of

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:24,389
rolling through let's go take that last point slowly but surely got two medics

21
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:36,319
on you now oh we got a heavy I'm backing up yeah back off for a little bit I got

to heal this guy oh I got you oh oh watch out spy turn on guys oh man another

23
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:56,310
century in here somewhere oh god don't know from where damn all up top two

24
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:05,169
centuries up top is that medic still you guys still alive we both died or if you

27
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:18,900
here too oh god Gabe Newell I don't know he played with the fans of the game I

28
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:26,330
think his fingers would be too fat to use the keyboard he's kind of a big boy

29
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:37,560
oh he is very nice guy though apparently that's good when's episode 3 ever coming

30
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,250
out yeah I know you hear about the those protesters that were sitting on the

31
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,889
valve headquarters apparently there was protesters sitting on the front lawn of

32
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:53,169
valve like maybe like a week or two ago saying like where's episode 3 there was

33
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:56,969
only like three or four of them so Gabe Newell went out there and ordered him a

34
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:01,250
pizza so they could like eat and hang out there yeah and eventually I guess

35
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,930
somebody called the police and the police officer was a huge team fortress

36
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:11,789
2 fan so he like joined in on the protest nice I just thought where is

37
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:17,810
their headquarters located oh I think it's in Seattle no we just want to sit

38
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:26,279
in the rain all day oh stereotyping a city oh damn oh I got multiple this guy

I've ever had the double crits pocket that's oh man that would have been

42
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:49,279
pretty ridiculous yeah damn engineers with their centuries turtling up all

43
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,759
right I wanted I'm one to talk engineers like my favorite class yeah I love my

44
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,079
combat energy that's probably my second favorite class oh yeah it's just fun like

45
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,649
you just I don't know I don't know what's about it it's very satisfying I

46
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:09,009
will it is absolutely to work with a non-living object to complete an

47
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:16,560
objective of getting those wins I got like 50% where you at a second floor

48
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:24,120
still working on DJ set up mr. battlefield legend plans fortress yeah

64
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,800
always go over saw nine times out of ten just because there's so many

65
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,620
opportunities to just hit somebody and get 25 free percent uber if I'm not

66
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,660
using the uber saw that I'm using the what is it called the one where you taunt
