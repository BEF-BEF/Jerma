1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:09,949
Do you trade carnival?

2
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:13,509
Do you trade carnival? It's my favorite map.

3
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:15,509
You can just turn on the weird, don't you?

4
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:22,460
No, I have to be in the mood, don't you know? I have to be in the mood to make videos. Do you understand that?

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,410
I have to be in the mood. For you.

6
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,410
Hey, did you see that top comment?

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,409
German wants to be in the mood for starting well.

8
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:41,170
Look at all these snipers, dude. Oh, baby. This is how we do a little bit of shlob.

9
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,179
Wow, did you just kill a sniper who was standing still?

10
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,670
Shut the fuck up. I didn't see you kill him.

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,229
Yeah, because I wasn't in the game.

12
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:57,229
Look, I don't need to take advice from you, okay? You give terrible advice. Your advice is for the fucking birds, okay?

13
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:59,729
What do you mean my advice is for the birds?

14
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:05,730
If I was a bird, I would take advice from you. That's what I'm saying.

15
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,730
What kind of advice do you give to a bird, is what I'm saying.

16
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:15,730
I've never heard birds in your background before, and you just got all these birds going...

17
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,730
I've got this window open.

18
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,730
Do you want some advice for the birds? Shut your fucking window.

19
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,849
The plan is to be lob shlobs inside of their vent.

20
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:29,849
Do you know what that means?

21
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:31,849
I don't know what that means. No one knows what that means.

22
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:34,849
Don't get headshot.

23
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:35,849
Yeah, I don't know how to do that.

24
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:37,849
So stand right here.

25
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:38,849
Right here?

26
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:39,849
Right here.

27
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,849
Okay.

28
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:44,849
Oh my god, you have the worst plan.

29
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:50,500
There's no way they could get behind us, because we're blocking off the only entrance.

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Yeah, we're blocking the entrance.

31
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,870
Where a lot of people are actively playing the game.

32
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,870
Welcome to the lob shlob den.

33
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,180
I can just...

34
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,500
You know that spy. That spy is going to come around for sure.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,500
But there is something to be said, though. Whoever comes down this hall...

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,500
You're supposed to be...

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
I almost died because you didn't follow the technique.

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,129
Well, let's go get you a health kit.

39
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:19,129
Oh my god.

40
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:21,500
You better get him.

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
He's got a lock and load. He's not lob shlobbing like you.

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,830
Nice.

43
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,830
Have you heard of any good movies that came out recently?

44
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,490
Look at this. Look behind you.

45
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,490
We have an entire brigade of people just sitting in this vent.

46
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,490
Oh, before it was me and you, it was a duo, but now it's a brigade.

47
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,490
We had two people with brigade status.

48
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,490
Look at this.

49
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,300
Are we for real right now?

50
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,539
We got the one guy on red just sitting back there.

51
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:58,860
So what I'm going to do... You know what? I'm going to better...

52
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,860
I'm just going to go spectate after.

53
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,860
We're going to do this once or twice, and then I'm going to spectate.

54
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,860
Hey, quit headshotting people.

55
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,860
Hey. Hey, stop it.

56
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,360
This guy's just getting like free kills.

57
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,159
All right, so ready. Everyone on red, stuff back here.

58
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,159
We all have to be stuffed in the corner.

59
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,129
This is not going to happen, man.

60
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:25,129
All right, you guys ready?

61
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:29,139
Everyone with the default grenade launcher on the count of three.

62
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:32,139
On the count of three, start lobbing.

63
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:41,819
One, two, three.

64
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:42,819
Hold on, hold on.

65
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:43,819
Yeah, there we go.

66
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:44,819
There we go. There we go.

67
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:45,819
Good, good, good, good, good.

68
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:47,439
You ready?

69
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,439
So in three seconds, I'm going to count down, start doing the lob-slob.

70
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,939
You guys ready?

71
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,610
Three, two, one.

72
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:04,069
Go for it.

73
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,379
It's like two people just kind of came in afterwards.

74
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,620
Whoever holds this wins.

75
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,620
I'm going to do my own timer.

76
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,620
Whoever holds this, whoever has the most people in here on red team or blue team wins.

77
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,839
And you can only use the grenade launcher.

78
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,839
This is like, this is just, this is ridiculous.

79
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,839
Nobody can even do anything.

80
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:34,339
You might as well just stand at the very back and just lob into the side.

81
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:37,579
This one guy.

82
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:40,579
I wish you guys could see what this looks like.

83
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:43,579
This is just not even cool.

84
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:48,459
This is just so stupid.

85
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:53,829
Okay, let's all be spies.

86
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:56,829
Yeah, who brings a pyro to a bar fight, to a knife fight?

87
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:03,220
Come on, man.

88
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,220
Yeah, he wants to kick, he wants to get kicked.

89
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,220
He said he wants to get kicked.

90
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,220
I'm not going to do it.

91
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,220
I'm not going to.

92
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,350
Nice.

93
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,189
Three, two, one.

94
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:25,189
Knife fight.

95
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:28,579
This is going to last forever.

96
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:32,100
Why has nobody died?

97
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,670
Oh, I got taunt killed.

98
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:44,430
Did anybody on blue die?

99
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,430
Did you see that taunt kill?

100
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,439
Did you see that taunt kill?

101
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,439
I'm really surprised this actually really works.

102
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,439
Okay, you guys ready?

103
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,439
Here I am.

104
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,129
I'm going to go for it.

105
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:57,129
Let's see how many people, if I can get you guys.

106
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:01,649
Oh my God.

107
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:08,180
I can't believe that that works.

108
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,540
Wow.

109
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,939
That's, I got at least five or six people.

110
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:19,269
Yeah, that's so cool.

111
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:21,269
I'm just farming my strange.

112
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:22,269
Sorry, guys.
