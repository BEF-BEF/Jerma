00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,439
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.

2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:16,440
This Scare Saturday is going to be a little different than you're used to.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,440
I'm actually going to be doing two games tonight.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,440
And the reason for this is the first one that I do starts off really creepy and kind of scary,

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,440
and then just gets kind of gets comical. It gets like funny.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,439
So instead of having just one short video where it's like four or five minutes long,

7
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,439
I'm going to do a second video as well. So this is like a double video.

8
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:42,439
It's two games in one. The first one is Lumber Island, and the second one is The Room.

9
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,439
Respective links will be in the description.

10
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,439
Let me know what you think about these two games.

11
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:52,439
The second one is pretty scary. It's a very, very, very, very bare bones independent project.

12
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,439
But we'll see how you guys enjoy them.

13
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:58,679
I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody. See you there.

14
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:07,950
Apparently I'm looking at a rock. Oh, well, whatever. That was weird.

15
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:19,689
Created by Dean Forge. I don't like how I can't see anything. Can I sprint? Not really.

16
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:26,340
Chapter one, the letter. I feel like I'm playing Slender right now.

17
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:44,780
What's up, bird? Oh, a campfire. I'm going to go toast some marshmallows.

18
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:57,709
A little teddy. OK, should I pick it up? What can I do here? Oh, I got it. OK.

19
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:02,459
What the hell? That's pretty eerie. It's just like a teddy rockspin.

20
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,430
Can I do anything else? I don't think I can even do anything else.

21
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:20,580
All right. Well, I got my teddy bear. What do I do now? What's that say?

22
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,580
Welcome to the Lumber Island, a place you will never forget.

23
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,009
And the brawny paper towel man is like here to welcome you.

24
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:34,270
Remember, use brawny when you got those big messes to clean up.

25
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:42,090
They came again. Now with the threats. I don't know how much longer I hold up, but I'll never sell my land.

26
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:52,340
OK, go back to close. Oh, right. That's the camera.

27
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,729
What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah. Yes. What's with the music?

28
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:15,259
What is with this music? Oh, my God. I don't think he has a head.

29
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:24,469
Oh, my God. He doesn't have a head. What do I do? What do I do?

30
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:30,210
What do I do? Just run away from this dude.

31
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:39,590
The headless brawny paper towel man. Don't get stuck on a rock. Go.

32
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:51,330
What do I do? Is this going to be something like can I get like a gun?

33
00:03:51,330 --> 00:04:04,550
Can I shoot this guy? Oh, it's like Michael Myers.

34
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:10,520
Oh, I put the I put the teddy bear down. What's why? What's with the mist?

35
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:22,779
Get away from me, bro. I'm going to I'm going to try and find his boots

36
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:32,639
because he's pissed off. That's why he's going. He's kind of slow.

37
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:47,040
He's not the fastest. He's not the fastest man, but he is big and he's got an axe.

38
00:04:47,040 --> 00:05:02,139
Let's get a good look at this guy. He's really slow.

39
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:07,379
I kind of feel bad for this guy right now. Like he wants to catch me,

40
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:10,379
but he just he just ain't going to catch me. He's just not going to catch me.

41
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:21,350
What if I can I get back in the boat? Will he come like into the boat?

42
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,350
I don't think he realizes he can like come over here. Let's see.

43
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:32,709
Let's see what happens. Does he does he come in the boat?

44
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:51,040
Ladies and gentlemen, the slug monster. Don't kill me.

45
00:05:51,040 --> 00:06:02,019
Sir, excuse me. So new game. Let's go.

46
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:07,860
I like the rain. The rain can clear everything.

47
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,860
Wash the dirty things from me. Dirty things like sand, mud, blood or sin.

48
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,170
This is like a bad teleprompter. Can I make this like go faster?

49
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:27,430
What I do. What can you see in this picture? A sad face, praying or a rose?

50
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,629
Um, I think I see if I'm not going to lie. I see a face. That's a sad face.

51
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:35,870
I see. And what do what do you think about this one?

52
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,750
What is this like a psychology test? A crown, castle or horns?

53
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:47,339
I kind of looks like I'm going to say castle. I would say castle.

54
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,899
Great stronghold. That's surprising.

55
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:54,899
Once again, it's a fairies screaming or a puppy.

56
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:59,019
I see a puppy. That looks like a cute little note there.

57
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:07,209
You can. Okay. So what the hell? What was that all about?

58
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:14,699
Simple metal table with some stuff on it. My bed. I'm not tired yet.

59
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,699
This is the guy's house. This is like a wicked screwed up house.

60
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,870
If you ask me. Get out of the way.

61
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:29,980
I have a giant poster of internal organs. What's that?

62
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,980
What's that? Oh, it's my daughter. Hello, daughter.

63
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:39,589
What the hell do I do? Can I like leave this room?

64
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:44,959
It is called the room probably for a reason. I don't like the FOV, man.

65
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:53,139
Closed. All right. I get it. It's closed.

66
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:59,639
Really? What? I really like the rain. Please. Someone can hear me.

67
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,639
It was just using, you know, that sound that was like the AOL instant messenger.

68
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:11,980
Somebody just signed off noise to move these boxes.

69
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,980
Simple wooden crates. I don't know why. What did that say? Why they're here.

70
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:21,360
A vent. You can always go in the vent. I know this from experience.

71
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:30,370
Move out of the way. I feel like I'm looking through. Yeah, the rain did stop.

72
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:36,639
Why? Did the rain stop? I don't like this.

73
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:58,620
I don't know what to do. This is not cool.

74
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,980
Picture of a little girl. I don't remember who it is. Who is she? I don't know.

75
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:12,340
This is your house. I can't move. Wait, one of the pictures looks different.

76
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:23,509
My memory isn't good. What? Hi. Over the window? What? What do you mean over the window?

77
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,509
Over the window? What does that mean? What's that mean? What's that mean? What's that mean?

78
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:44,620
I feel like the whole world's closing in. Can I jump? Shut up.

79
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,649
Can I go in the vent? Wind coming from here. If I can open it, maybe I can escape.

80
00:09:50,649 --> 00:10:00,980
I can't even tell what's happening, let alone like there's like a crowbar I can grab.

81
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,299
Anyone's out there, please. No answer. Fucking bulletproof glass. No one can hear me.

82
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:15,299
So am I going like crazy inside my own head or something?

83
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:27,679
Crow. I'll go to sleep. Oh, I'm supposed to go to sleep. Go to sleep.

84
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,690
It's late. Bad day. Really need to... Okay, so I went to sleep, I think.

85
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:46,200
Geez. What? I'm like a murderer? Is this like my prison cell?

86
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,960
Who are you? Where are you? Answer me, you son of a bitch.

87
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,820
You want to play? Show yourself. It's written in blood. Are you kidding me? Yeah.

88
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:07,389
Stop with this. Stop. With. Your. Bullshit.

89
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:28,289
I wish I could... Huh? Yes? What is in there? What is in here?

90
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:34,129
It looks like a corpse? What the hell happened? Who made this? Where am I? I must escape.

91
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:39,330
A corp... Ah! Gina! Gina! Hi! Gina! Hi! Lady!

92
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:49,080
Lady? It's like my friend... My friend got smashed and she got hurt.

93
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:56,350
Go to bed. Go back to bed. Go back to bed. Go back to bed. It's just a dream.

94
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:10,240
This is a stupid dream. Small coin. I can take it.

95
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:19,269
Did I pick it up? Did I just pick up the coin? Shut up, baby!

96
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:23,340
I don't have time for you. Can I like... Can I now... Can I open this?

97
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:31,789
Maybe this will work. Okay, I think I opened it.

98
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:40,649
Oh! Yes! I can't go any further. Here lies a rat. Disgusting. But eat them?

99
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:47,620
Do I want to eat the rat? I don't think I want to eat a rat. No, I'm not eating a rat.

100
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,909
I have to eat this rat to go further? Okay, eat the rat.

101
00:12:52,909 --> 00:13:11,159
Go! Go! Go! Go! What the hell? I can't do anything there?

102
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:16,299
Please tell me I can leave now. Whoa! That's puke. That's my vomit.

103
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:21,070
It's still closed. Can I go to bed now, please?

104
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:34,500
I'm not tired yet. Can I open these things with the coin, too?

105
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:43,289
No, it's locked. No, it's locked. What does this like throw up do for me?

106
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:51,460
What's this? Small bobby pin. I can open the locker. I can open the locker.

107
00:13:51,460 --> 00:14:00,590
Guarantee it. What? What? Can I open the door with this?

108
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:09,960
I can leave this cursed room. Finally, I'm out. I can leave this strange place.

109
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:20,440
But what the? No one's here. Hello? Someone can hear me?

110
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,440
So there you have it, guys. That's a dual Scare Saturday today because the games are pretty short.

111
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,440
So we'll see how that works out. If you guys want to see more, please let me know.

112
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,440
Links will be in the description for both of these games.

113
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,440
And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
