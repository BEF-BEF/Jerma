00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:09,689
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:14,689
And tonight, I'm gonna be playing as the Sniper with the new Sniper Rifle.

3
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:17,690
The classic, classic, the classic Sniper Rifle.

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,929
And I'm gonna give my thoughts on it. I'll tell you what I think about the item.

5
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:25,929
Do I think it's any good? Do I think it's any bad? Do I think you should craft it? Should you buy it? Should you sell it?

6
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,929
Sell it! Sell it! Sell it!

7
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,550
Okay, we'll get the weird out for now.

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:38,109
So, the Sniper Rifle in question, the classic, is a new rifle for the Sniper in the primary slot.

9
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:41,109
If you don't know how it works, I'm gonna give you a brief explanation of it.

10
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:48,350
This rifle is directly from Team Fortress Classic. If you don't know what that game is, it's essentially Team Fortress 1.

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,350
Although they were like a couple of different iterations of it, but Team Fortress Classic came before TF2.

12
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,350
And it was the standard, the regular Sniper Rifle in TFC was this item.

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,350
It was not the one you're used to in TF2. It was this one.

14
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,590
And how does it transition to TF2?

15
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:10,769
Well, it's hard to answer that question, because it's a very awkward item.

16
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:14,769
If you have never used the TF Classic weapon, if you've never played Team Fortress Classic,

17
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:19,939
this is a very strange and upside down, totally reversed way to play Sniper

18
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:23,939
out of the seven and a half years that this game has been out.

19
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,939
And I can understand that. I can understand how awkward and strange and messy this is when you first get it in your hands,

20
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,939
because it changes the entire world of Sniper.

21
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,939
You have to hold the button down. You have to hold fire down to charge.

22
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,939
You can't headshot somebody unless it's a fully charged shot.

23
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,939
And you have to let go of the button to shoot.

24
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:49,379
And this whole, what ends up happening is, you hold down left click to start the charge.

25
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,379
And then if you want to zoom in, you have to like hit right click while you're holding left click,

26
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,379
let go of left click.

27
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,379
I feel like I'm knitting a sweater when I play with this item. I really do.

28
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,379
I feel like I'm like about to when I look down at my mouse, it's going to be like a crocheted blanket.

29
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:05,680
And I'm going to go, oh, that's nice. I'm going to give that to my niece.

30
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,680
As goofy as that sounds, I really feel like my hands are being knitted together.

31
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,680
And it's something that you need to get used to.

32
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,680
Like I said, it reverses everything you know about the Sniper.

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,680
And you move really slowly when you actually hold the charge down.

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,680
I don't know if it's the same speed as the regular Sniper being zoomed in,

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,680
but I think it just feels slower because you can see more of what's going on around you.

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
And watch this demo man right here. I was laughing so hard at this.

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,819
Like why were you doing that?

38
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,120
Like he just got destroyed.

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,300
Anyways, we're going to move on from that. I lost my train of thought.

40
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,300
Oh yeah. We talked about the bad. I want to talk about the good.

41
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,300
There is something very specific here that this rifle has that none of the other ones do.

42
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,300
And I'm referring to the fact, like I just said, you can see the whole battlefield,

43
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,300
regardless if you have zero or a hundred percent charge.

44
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,300
I know everything that's happening around me before I even need to scope in.

45
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,300
On top of that, yeah, you can do no scopes.

46
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,300
You can do a lot of damage with the no scope.

47
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,300
But I think this adds the level of when you're playing with the Huntsman

48
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,300
and you have your peripheral vision still around, you don't have to worry.

49
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,300
If somebody's coming from my side right now, see right here, I'm shooting at the soldier.

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,300
If somebody's coming up to my left or right, I can see them.

51
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
You can't do that with any of the other rifles.

52
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,300
You have to scope in to be able to get the damage you need to get the kill, right?

53
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,300
And it gives you this sense of security.

54
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,300
You feel more safe while you're using this weapon.

55
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,300
Because even when you have to hard scope, you can still pull it down.

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,300
You can pull down the scope with still having the charge going.

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,300
So even if you think somebody might be behind you, might be behind you,

58
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,300
even if you think somebody might be behind you, you can still turn around,

59
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,300
whip around, take a look, and still have your charge going.

60
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,539
That's pretty huge.

61
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:50,539
And if you want me to give you a verdict here, if you want me to give you a,

62
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:53,539
what do you really think? Give it to us real.

63
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,539
Tell us the real story.

64
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:58,840
Well, I would probably say this is not the best sniper rifle in the game.

65
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Is it fun to use? I think so.

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,840
And when I play Team Fortress 2, that's what matters to me.

67
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
Can I jump in? Am I going to have a good time?

68
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Can I just mess around with this rifle?

69
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,840
Is it the best? No. Is it fun? Yeah.

70
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
So it's hard to give a letter grade to this.

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
It's messy. Yes, it's clumsy.

72
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,839
But getting that no-scope 450 on somebody is pretty satisfying,

73
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,839
and it's pretty interesting, and it's all in good fun.

74
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,839
And I'm glad to see that they're bringing stuff over from Team Fortress Classic.

75
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,839
I don't know if they're going to keep bringing stuff over.

76
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,839
I don't have any insider information on this.

77
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,839
It's just I like to see them paying homage to their Team Fortress Classic.

78
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,839
I think that's really interesting. I'm happy to see it here.

79
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,839
As much as you might not like it or as much as you might think it's great,

80
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,839
it's still cool nonetheless to see it in the game.

81
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,839
And that's my thoughts. That's my theory.

82
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,839
And that's what I got to say.

83
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,839
So that's going to wrap up the video, guys.

84
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,839
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

85
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,839
Let me know what you think in the comments.

86
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,839
And I'll see you all next time.

87
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,399
And of course, take care, everybody.
