1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:11,619
Hey, what's happening everybody? How you doing? Hope your day is good. Hope your day has been great good

2
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:15,980
It better be great. My name is German. Nice to see you. Nice to meet you. Gonna be hanging out

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,579
Gonna be talking about this new game that's been around. I'm sure you've heard of it. Sure. You've seen it

4
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,600
Maybe it's overwatch. I got into the closed beta. This is closed beta footage

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,679
I'm sorry. There hasn't been very much content on the channel this last couple of weeks

6
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,820
But if you can't tell I've been kind of sick and it's been one of those sicknesses

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,179
That's a relapsing sickness where you get better and then you get worse and you get better than you get worse

8
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,179
I don't know

9
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,219
I don't know what like mad scientist gave me like a poison potion

10
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:46,179
But I don't know what the fuck happened with that being said let's go on and get started here

11
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,140
So this is Lucio

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,340
This is one of the support characters and he's probably my favorite character to play as it stands right now in the beta

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,939
And that's because of how Blizzard has handled support in this game

14
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,520
every time I ever play a game that has support characters, whether it be a

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,520
MOBA or

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,159
First-person action game or something multiplayer anytime support is an available option

17
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:12,329
Nobody really wants to play it right like you get those people that like love to play support

18
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:16,730
I love playing support right like engineer is my favorite class in TF2. I love playing the healers

19
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,890
I love playing the support characters when I played World of Warcraft all of my characters were pretty much tank or healer

20
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,609
I didn't have very many damage-dealing mains or alternative like that

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,329
But in the grand scheme of things people shy away from support mostly because of why?

22
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:35,540
Because it's boring because you only do one thing and it's not that fun

23
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,819
You kind of somebody has to do it

24
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,019
it's just a question of who's gonna do it right and you get to that point where like four people have something picked and

25
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:47,219
There's no support or there's no tank and you just pick it because god damn it

26
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,469
Somebody's got to do it. So it might as well be me. That's not really how it worked in overwatch

27
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,969
I think Blizzard if they one thing could be said about Blizzard right now

28
00:01:54,969 --> 00:02:01,049
They've done a fantastic job of making sure that the support characters are fun to play and do more than one thing

29
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:08,120
Because how it usually works is you're the stand behind you guy or hey, I'm in a corner looking at health bars

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,430
Does anybody need a buff every now and then that's what happens in most games now

31
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,050
There is mercy mercy is that kind of character in this game. She has a heal beam

32
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:23,930
She has a damage boost beam, but she's still fun to play and the other three quote support characters play

33
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:31,099
Wildly different than that. This is Lucio Lucio is a healer support character, but as you've been watching I'm skiing around

34
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:36,580
I'm skating around putting up the speed boost getting some kills jumping around wrapping around back to my teammates

35
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,979
You're not glued to somebody there is no standardized

36
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,639
Obligation to a certain character when you're playing somebody like Lucio. I have to move around

37
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,340
It's just how active you get to be like look at this. It's like a big fat guy down

38
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,419
I just punched this fat guy right in his stomach. See how active that was

39
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:57,139
See how active I just got to be and the best part about playing Lucio is all of his support stuff is AoE

40
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:04,860
I can switch between heal or speed so right now anybody that's standing even remotely near me gets a heal over time

41
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,020
I can boost it up with one of the abilities or I can switch over and make everybody run faster right now

42
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,580
Everybody's running fast and I just fucking compression blast that dude off the cliff

43
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,759
You got a compression blast too, but I got a long way to go. There's a lot more playing

44
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,199
There's a lot more testing to do. I've got a lot of shit that I want to be playing in this game

45
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,800
I did so awesome. It's been a long time guys

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,939
It's been a really long time since I've cared about the numbers the damage numbers in a certain video game or what?

47
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:35,860
How fast am I moving as this particular character like it?

48
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,680
It's been a long time and it's really cool to see that

49
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,460
I'm actually enjoying myself and any complaints that I have so far about the game are

50
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:51,750
Very aesthetic if I could check a box to lower the amount of the giant explosions and it muzzle

51
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,389
Flashes and stuff because they are kind of ridiculous

52
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,789
Especially if there's like three people doing their ultimate at the same time

53
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,949
You kind of have no idea what the hell is going on and maybe a couple of things in the UI that I'd like to

54
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:07,550
See change some of the indicators are way too big

55
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,550
I wish you could scale them down

56
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:16,470
Especially if you're a healer some of that stuff could be shrunken by it like 30% and I would be totally okay with it

57
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,529
But besides that it's very very good

58
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,089
I don't have very much to say that's bad about the game besides that so far and look I only have

59
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:29,930
15 or so 16 hours in the game and I'm sure there'll be plenty of amazing things

60
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,209
I'd love to talk about and I'm sure there'll be plenty of things

61
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:36,170
I'd like to talk about that aren't so amazing, but that's what a beta is for that's a closed beta

62
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:41,980
I mean, that's how you figure that stuff out, and I'm sure they will but that's gonna wrap it up here guys

63
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,899
Just a quick video

64
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:48,300
Number one just saying that the game's great. I've been playing overwatch and number two that I've been sick

65
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,500
And I'm sorry that hasn't been very much content on this channel

66
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,180
I've been working on like three videos that I just have not been able to finish

67
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,759
But anyways, I'm probably streaming right now if you go to my twitch

68
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,240
I'm gonna be streaming this game a lot so come to the stream go to star stream

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,120
I'll put both of our stream links in the description at any given moment this next at least couple of weeks

70
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,889
You'll probably see us streaming this game so come say hello come hang out and yeah, take care everybody

71
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,889
Thanks for watching. I'll see you all soon good
