1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:10,250
Exit so you get it right, nice and tight.

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,869
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jermuck here with a vlog.

3
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:18,690
It's been a while since I've done one of these face to face one on one.

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,690
Me and you are the only people in this conversation.

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,859
So see your way out of it, buddy.

6
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,230
There's nobody else here.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,230
Anyways guys, hi, welcome to the vlog. I haven't done one of these in a while.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,859
But I thought I would do one tonight because pretty important reason.

9
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:36,030
I'm an uncle. You probably saw the title.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,030
The baby was born not tonight.

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,030
It didn't like just happen like, oh, did it just happen?

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,030
Okay, I'll get off the phone. Hey, it's a video.

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,030
I just spilled that everywhere.

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,030
But that's not what this is.

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,030
This is it. Hold on. I have to clean that up.

16
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,030
But no, my my niece was born exactly two days ago.

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:01,030
It was at 11 a.m. on the calendar on Wednesday, July 31st.

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,659
Got a bunch of pictures.

19
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:08,709
There's probably going to be one like right here in this area right here.

20
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:11,709
My hands are probably disappearing behind a little baby.

21
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:13,709
Hello. Yes, baby.

22
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:14,709
So what's the baby's name?

23
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,709
I talked to my sister to make sure this was all OK.

24
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:22,709
So I'm not just like uploading pictures of her newborn infant baby on the Internet.

25
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,709
But no, the baby's name is Harper.

26
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,709
It is a girl. Harper Eve is the baby's name.

27
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:30,709
Very pretty name for a little one different baby right there.

28
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:33,709
But Harper Eve is the name of the baby.

29
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:37,709
I'm not going to tell you the last name because I don't want you to go like find her or something.

30
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:40,709
And she was already scared enough for me to do this video.

31
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,709
She's like, make sure like nobody like harasses me.

32
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:44,709
I'm like, no one's going to listen.

33
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,709
No one's going to harass you. You're going to be fine.

34
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,709
Just chill out. You just had a goddamn baby for Christ's sake.

35
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,890
Just like go sip on some sangria or whatever.

36
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,260
What do you what do you do when you're not when you're not pregnant?

37
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,260
If you're watching this video and you were pregnant at one point in your life,

38
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,500
What's like the first thing you did?

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
What's like the first thing you did after you were pregnant?

40
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
I'm kind of curious because I mean, I'm a boy.

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,439
I'm a man and I can't have babies come out of my body.

42
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,439
So I'd like to know.

43
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:17,439
And if you're not able to talk, but as you can tell, I'm in a very crazy mood right now.

44
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,810
I just got home from a family reunion where everybody was interested.

45
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,810
We got to do this like iPhone FaceTime thing where it was like I had the iPad set up and she was on the iPhone.

46
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,810
She showed pictures of the baby in real time and it was crazy.

47
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,810
It was amazing.

48
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:44,180
And it's a really it's really cool feeling if those of you that have not been able to be alive to see a sibling or a niece or a nephew born.

49
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,120
I feel great right now, man.

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:56,599
Like I feel awesome because knowing that like somebody in my family is like continuing the human chain just feels good.

51
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,599
You get to see life.

52
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,900
You get to see death in this crazy world that we live in and you get to see it all.

53
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,900
And I'm glad that I was able to share this with you guys.

54
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,900
I just want to do a quick little thing to tell you where I've been the last couple of days.

55
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:24,750
I've been freaking out with family just with the family conversing about little babies and how cute they are and how I'm going to like do lots of snuggles and lots of nose nuzzles to this little adorable thing that's in my life now.

56
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,750
But yeah, that's about we're going to wrap it up here.

57
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,750
I just want to do a quick now.

58
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,750
I'll see myself out.

59
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,060
I'll see myself now.

60
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,060
I'll see myself out.

61
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,060
You know, don't don't don't get up.

62
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,789
Has there ever been has there ever ever been a full body German shot ever recorded?

63
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,789
I don't think that has.

64
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:44,349
I'm pretty sure this is the first ever like full body German shot.

65
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,939
This is my baby.

66
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,580
Well, I already have a baby.

67
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,580
His name is Otto.

68
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,020
Hello.

69
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,280
Hi.

70
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
You fucking stink.

71
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
Get out of here.

72
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,210
You smell like fucking piss and dog food.

73
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,210
But that wraps it up here, guys.

74
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:10,210
Just want to throw together this quick little vlog, probably a very chaotic vlog because I'm very excited, as you can probably tell that by now.

75
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,210
So I'll see you guys all next time.

76
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,210
Take care, everybody.

77
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,639
And the meaning of life, guys.
