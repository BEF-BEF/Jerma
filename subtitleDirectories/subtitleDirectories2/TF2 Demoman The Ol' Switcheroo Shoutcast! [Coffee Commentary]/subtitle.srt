00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:22,550
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the demo man with the Hef Zitoichi, the default sticky bomb launcher and the default grenade launcher.

2
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:34,549
Also, this is gonna be a coffee commentary of Justice in Doom, if you don't know what that is, it's a series I do on this channel where I drink a bunch of coffee and do a crazy shoutcast into the microphone for the game, this game happen to be Dead to Team Fortress 2.

3
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:47,549
Also, the title of this video is probably gonna be something like the old switcheroo, the old switcheroo, because I switch teams halfway through here. On my own merit, I don't get auto-balanced, I do it on my own terms, I just switch over because I felt like it.

4
00:00:47,549 --> 00:01:01,549
I'm not gonna spoil the video, I don't want to ruin that for you, we'll just say it as it comes, because this, of course, is a coffee commentary, we're gonna do a shoutcast here, gonna talk about everything that's happening on the screen, gonna go really fast and really really intense, because I know you guys enjoy that type of commentary.

5
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:15,549
So anyways, let's get started here, three people ubercharged right now on the payload cart, I wait to the final moment and kaboom, there they all go, three people on the kill feed by Jerma, or whatever my name happens to be, it is Jerma, because I change my name on Steam every 45 minutes.

6
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:22,549
This soldier on the top left, he gets boom-shakalaka'd by that Demoman sticky bomb launcher, it is a fantastic weapon, I suggest you use it sometimes.

7
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:29,549
Anyways, got a medic with the vaccinator doing a fantastic job, getting everybody healed and over-healed, even though it over-heals a lot more slowly.

8
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:40,549
Jerma is a little bit concerned here, because he doesn't have enough health to go out and look at the ball bag on that medic's face, the bag, the Saxon hail bag, oh god, I said ball bag.

9
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:51,549
Anyways, oh, we got two engineers now building sentry guns, defending this little point here, another Evie Evie comes in with the medic on his back, but it's okay, I'm gonna get a kill here, do I actually, I don't think I get a kill here, I lied, I'm sorry.

10
00:01:51,549 --> 00:02:04,549
But I actually do get a kill, I remember right here I kill a sniper in two shots, he's up here on this little roost, let's see, one, two, and three and four apparently, I shoot three, four shots up there when I only really needed two.

11
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:17,550
But it's okay, I make up for it right here, I actually almost kill my whole team by getting a reflected shot back, watch right here, I'm so sorry, please don't be mad at me team, I almost killed us all, and that would have been very very upsetting.

12
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,550
That's a transition you're gonna move on to when I come out of spawn, because who wants to watch this guy, actually, let's sit here, let's see how good he does.

13
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,919
He's like annihilating everybody, you have issues, want tissues, well you are destroying the other team.

14
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:39,919
Let's come out now, coming out, Evie on the right hand side and a sentry on the left hand side, doing a fantastic job engineer, I'm so glad you have your sentries here, otherwise we'd be in a little bit of trouble.

15
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:52,919
But now this is starting to get a little bit outrageous here, we're starting to push them way, way far back, and this is pretty much the point after I kill a couple more people and we get into their spawn when I do the old switcheroo, and what's the old switcheroo you ask?

16
00:02:52,919 --> 00:03:08,919
When a team is losing by a lot of points or they're pushed back very very far, you switch teams and you try to win the game from the other side, this one being of course the blue team, and Medic I do apologize but your ass is way too fat to fit in that window, maybe you should stop eating so many deviled eggs and change that up with a salad.

17
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,919
Does the Medic even eat deviled eggs? I don't know.

18
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:21,919
But a good indication of if you are dominating the other team or you're pushing out really far, right here, if you see the no smoking sign, that means that you should probably switch sides and help the other team.

19
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:34,919
I really don't know how this happened because they were pushing very very hard, the cart was up so so far, I don't know how this even happened, but we ended up getting dominated, well me now as in the blue team we were getting dominated, but let's switch and see if we can do anything here.

20
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:42,919
Now on the blue team, got a Medic in front of me, got a Pyro in front of me, and if you remember my engineer friends from earlier, I play sort of a Benedict Arnold role right here.

21
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:51,919
Both sentries around the corner I take one out with the lock and load, then I turn the corner again, take out the sticky bomb launcher and thank you to the Pyro in the top left for being the distraction right there.

22
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:59,919
And then I send this scout right into orbit, right into outer space, hopefully your trip was a success, hopefully you found some alien life and maybe even some rocks to study, I don't know.

23
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:05,919
But you know what, I killed this Pyro, get up on the cart, let's push this god damn thing and win this god damn game.

24
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:12,349
Crit sticky, and now I'm going after this Medic and let me get the kill with this Toichi man.

25
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:15,349
Now I'm stuck out with this thing, I hate when this happens.

26
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:23,350
You pull out the halfs of Toichi thinking you're gonna get a kill with it, and the person dies in front of you and you're just stuck like this and he really can't do anything, I'm just seriously completely useless.

27
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,350
I was thinking about going back to the spawn, but then I saw a Pyro make his face appear right here.

28
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,350
Thought I could get the kill, get one hit, get dismissed, come here you son of a bitch.

29
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,350
Now I can finally put the damn thing away.

30
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:47,350
Pro tip for everybody out there, if you see a halfs of Toichi demo man running around and there's like a dude with like two health in front of him, just try to let him get that kill because it really does suck ass when you're running around with that thing like a chicken with your head cut off.

31
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,350
Let's push this god damn cart.

32
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,350
Going for a long range shot, I actually get the...

33
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,850
And the Spy backstabs me.

34
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,850
Spy, why did you backstab me?

35
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,850
How could you do such a thing?

36
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,850
I was so upset that I could not be...

37
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,850
Well that got a little weird.

38
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,850
And we're back, we're revived, now we're respawned.

39
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,850
And two Pyros coming at me, put a trail of death in front of them, one of them explodes.

40
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,850
And the other one runs away, but guess what?

41
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,850
You can't run away.

42
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,850
Because I'm going to hold the button down, you son of a bitch.

43
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,850
And now we're going to get to the final part of this video, which is the best part of this entire video.

44
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,850
Seriously, most epic try ever.

45
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,850
And it's not even by me.

46
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,850
See, we're pushing the cart here, thinking the ten seconds left, going to get the cart moving, come on.

47
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,850
But we had a ton of people here, at least four or five people on the cart.

48
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,850
I explode, Heavy explodes on the left.

49
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,850
Let's see what happens here.

50
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,850
Scout's going to push on the chair, he's going to get it.

51
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,850
Come on Scout!

52
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,850
No, look who gets on top of this right now.

53
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,850
Medic, oh my god, epic Medic try.

54
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,850
Does he get the...

55
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,850
No, he does not.

56
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,850
And the sticky jump is a complete failure.

57
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,850
By the way, that's the hat, that is the unusual hat that I'm giving away.

58
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,850
Probably tomorrow afternoon, so check your YouTube PMs, make sure you're checking that out.

59
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,850
And I'll see you guys all next time.

60
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,850
Thank you for watching, see you all soon.

61
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,850
Take care, everybody.

62
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,410
Bye.
