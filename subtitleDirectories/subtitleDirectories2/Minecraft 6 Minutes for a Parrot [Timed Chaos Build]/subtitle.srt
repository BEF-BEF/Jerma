00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,839
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here and MLC Stealth.

2
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:21,750
Hello. Hello. We are going to be reviving an old series we used to do called Timed Chaos Build.

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,250
If you don't know what this is, it's where we give ourselves a certain amount of time

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,510
to build an object or animal, and we have to stop when we get to the end of that time.

5
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:36,149
So, what are we building today, MLC Stealth? Jerma, today we are going to be building a parrot.

6
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:45,420
A parrot? One of those old pirate-style parrots. So, if you are ready. Oh, dude, I forgot about that.

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,659
It doesn't even match. Well, match it. I did. All right, well, we're going to try and build a parrot in

8
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,939
six minutes, and whatever we end up with, with is what we end up with. So, are you ready?

9
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:08,500
Yeah, I think so. In three, two, one. Wait, hold on. My timer messed up. Three, two, one, go.

10
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:15,780
Okay, parrot. How does it start? It needs feet, right? Why does he have like coal for feet?

11
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,719
Why do you have that color? Because that's the, like, it's toes. Oh, I don't have that color.

12
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:30,439
Oh, I got it. He's going to be huge. All right, fine. All right.

13
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:39,400
It has to be. And then we have to do it to the side, too. Whoops. Wait, what are you doing?

14
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,239
I'm trying to, like, continue it. Let me undo everything. All right. All right, you do the feet.

15
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:48,760
I'll do, I'll do the... All right, so let's do this here. Listen now. Oh, crap. I didn't do that.

16
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,260
Right. That's his leg. All right. Almost a minute has gone by. We didn't hurry this up. Oh, yeah.

17
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:01,060
We haven't, like, even started yet, huh? There we go. Hey, his butt's got to come out kind of far

18
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,439
because don't, like, parrots have, like, big butts with tails? I don't know. Yeah, they do.

19
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,900
So, there's going to be a green... I thought we were doing, like, a yellow parrot.

20
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,050
We are. Now, change this to red. Wait, he's green, though. Yeah, but he's green just until

21
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,430
this part. So, complete this. Wait, he's a different color? Yeah, parrots are, like, a ton

22
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,069
of different colors. Aren't they, like, tropical colored, kind of? I don't know. Yeah, they are.

23
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:32,569
I probably should have Googled parrot before this part. All right. No, no, no, no. Now, we have to

24
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:38,599
go, um, to red. This is already looking like our horse that we did first. No, it's not going to be.

25
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:44,949
It'll be better. Oh, no. Get it. How many... They only have two legs. Like, you need to make this

26
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:56,889
even. Like, it's all right. This way, too. Because here's his tail. Tail? Yeah. All right. We're

27
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:03,449
making Qbert right now. So, let's... All right, yellow. He's got to have a yellow, like, belly.

28
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:08,280
Oh, it's getting, like, dark in this area. Don't worry. I could change the time if we need it.

29
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:18,490
Two minutes are gone by. Oh, good. All right. Already, he's looking like a

30
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:26,860
pancake. Why? Gold plated. He's like... This parrot's, like, doing very well, apparently.

31
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,419
Oh, these gold plates don't mesh together very well. It doesn't make one, like, solid chunk,

32
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:40,569
does it? No, it doesn't. But you know what? It's too late. I think it's coming along okay.

33
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:48,360
This just looks like corn. Like, corn on top. He really is made out of corn.

34
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:00,060
No, this is going to look like an owl. Just keep building. Just keep building. We'll deal with it.

35
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:08,620
All right. I'll come up this way. Three minutes have almost gone by. We're halfway there.

36
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:13,189
We need to make his body a little bit more fat. All right. I'll deal with that. You deal with the

37
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:24,360
body. He's way too big. He's... What is he? He's not even anything. He's a block on top of a block.

38
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,509
We're just putting shapes together and calling it a parrot.

39
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:36,040
He looks... He looks like the road runner. If the road runner had, like,

40
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,600
ran... It looks like the road runner ran into a wall and, like, squished his face.

41
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:44,220
All right. Now that's enough of that. Now we need to stop making the head.

42
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,680
Yeah, they have heads. What is that, like, corn on the cob body?

43
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,620
We need a beak. We need to be... We need his head first.

44
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,300
It looks like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.

45
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,680
It looks like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle coming out of a corn on the cob,

46
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,240
sitting on top of a table. This is the worst thing ever. Oh, whoa. What's going on? Saving?

47
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:20,220
No, we need a beak. We need a beak first. The beak has to be red.

48
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,149
Beak comes out like this, and this comes out too.

49
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:26,550
It's like platypus. This looks like a duck.

50
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,889
No, because we're going to give him, like, a big feathered head back here.

51
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,339
Oh, good. Glad we're doing that.

52
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:40,379
Four minutes and 28 seconds. Look, this is looking good. Look at that.

53
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:45,269
He only looks like somebody, like, threw up on their screen.

54
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,589
This is not a parrot. This is some, like, cartoon network.

55
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:55,430
This is a character from, like, Foster's Home for Imaginary Kids.

56
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,790
He really is a character from, like, Cartoon Network.

57
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,149
And apparently he's super saiyan right now.

58
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:08,360
All right, one minute left.

59
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,699
Oh, got to finish the body.

60
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:16,620
All right, what happened on this side of his head?

61
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,740
I got to fix up his mouth. His mouth is awful.

62
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:24,600
Everything about this is awful. He's not a parrot.

63
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:31,300
No, yes, he is. Yes, he is. He doesn't have wings. He doesn't have wings.

64
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,290
He doesn't have wings. We got to give him, like, wings. Oh, God.

65
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,810
I thought his wings are, like, a part of his body. Like, they combine.

66
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:43,579
He, like, retracts them so they're invisible.

67
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:48,040
No, not anymore. He has wings now. 30 seconds.

68
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,839
Oh, look at that, like, beautiful parakeet.

69
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,420
15 seconds. Clean it up.

70
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,670
This guy looks like he's in pain.

71
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,110
This guy is in severe physical pain.

72
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,189
Five, four, three, two, one, and there it is.

73
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,980
You touched his wings to his, like...

74
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,980
Doesn't he look like he's screaming?

75
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:21,829
He's just got, like, run over by a bus and he's waiting to die.

76
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:24,310
He seriously looks like he is screaming, like...

77
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,470
Like this hurts.

78
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,430
Look at his staircase for a back.

79
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,709
Oh, yeah, good. Awesome. Let's, like, walk up the staircase

80
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:39,420
that's supposed to be the parrot's back onto the creamed corn body.

81
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:43,769
Oh, that's so funny. Look at these eyes.

82
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,769
Okay, he's just like a normal green parrot,

83
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,889
but he's wearing, like, a yellow towel and the, like,

84
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,689
yellow woman's shower gown that they wrap around their hair.

85
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:55,850
Like, he just got out of the shower and he wrapped two towels,

86
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,529
one around his body, one around his hair.

87
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:58,970
Yeah, he just got out of the shower.

88
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,810
Oh, that's so funny. All right, so you guys are gonna give this guy a name

89
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,370
and a rating. One to ten.

90
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,339
I think the rating's gonna be pretty low for this one.

91
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:14,819
Lost his home for imaginary friends.

92
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,769
Oh, that's so funny.

93
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,850
All right, guys, well, thanks so much for watching

94
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,050
and we'll see you all next time.

95
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,769
And, of course, take care, everybody.
