1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:12,089
Let's go ahead and refresh it all and just see what, you know, what servers are available right now to me to play in Team Fortress 2.

2
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:26,570
300, 400, 500, keep coming, come on, come on, big money, come on, 700, come on, big money here, we got big money, 800, 900, we're up to over a thousand servers, you know, just stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, listen, listen, stop.

3
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:47,369
How many people are playing on TC Hydro right now? In over 1200 servers, there's only six human beings, but that just ain't gonna cut it. All right, Charlie, boot it up, turn it on, boot up the time machine, we're going back, there it is, we're going back to 2007. Star, are you coming with me? Let's go.

4
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:51,380
Oh, don't throw up, oh, don't throw up.

5
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,549
Did we just go back in time?

6
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:55,549
We did. Are you okay? You feeling all right?

7
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,549
I didn't think that was gonna work. Yeah, no, that was great.

8
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:02,859
Watch your step out of the time machine, it's really important that you do that, so do you have any idea where we are right now?

9
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,859
I don't know when we are.

10
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,859
We could have gone back in any point in history, we came back to TC Hydro, Team Fortress 2.

11
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:12,859
I'm going back to see the dinosaurs, this is stupid.

12
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:16,859
No, what do you mean, you can't go, no, no, no, no, no, that's my time machine!

13
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:19,359
Hey!

14
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,359
He actually used it.

15
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:23,109
I'm stuck on Hydro forever.

16
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:29,170
I don't even know if this is a good spot for this or not.

17
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:36,469
I'm sure we'll find out in the 7 minutes and 35 seconds that we're not going to be playing on this map.

18
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:42,469
Or this part of this map, or this round, or this mode, whatever you want to call it, this quadrant of Hydro.

19
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:49,409
Spy capping, I remember spy caps on Hydro were insane.

20
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,290
If a spy was back here right now and I didn't have this, he could just stand on this and he probably would win.

21
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,290
But that ain't gonna happen, because I have a big sentry.

22
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,040
See? Bang.

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,409
Orick XL, you got it.

24
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,409
Now you could be, no, you're not a spy.

25
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,270
I remember people go through this choke here, and that's all I remember.

26
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,770
I don't remember much.

27
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,770
It's been so long since the time machine was destroyed.

28
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,770
I've been on it probably for 20 years.

29
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,069
It's all becoming a blur.

30
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:23,460
Do they have an engineer too?

31
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,340
I don't know, actually, you know what?

32
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,900
I remember this, I remember, it's all coming back to me.

33
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,900
It's all coming back to me.

34
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,659
I'm gonna have a sentry gun right here, and it's gonna make everybody's lives better.

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,330
That would be heavy, that would be a lot of people.

36
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,569
I just, please, just, I don't know where to go.

37
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,569
I'm not sure, just repair it and just stand here.

38
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,569
I have one revenge crit, I gotta make this one count.

39
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,689
You know what, I could probably build a dispenser, which I will right here.

40
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:58,500
Get out of here, get.

41
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Yeah, I could have sworn you were a spy, but you're not.

42
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,639
I don't like the way this place looks either.

43
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,639
I feel like I'm in a cave.

44
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,460
I mean, technically we are in a cave, but look at this.

45
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,759
I don't know, I don't like it.

46
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,939
It hurts my eyes.

47
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,710
Wow.

48
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,710
That's one way to do it.

49
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,719
Okay.

50
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,409
I guess we're doing okay.

51
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,099
Watch the stairs, watch the stairs.

52
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:27,590
I've got six kills of this thing right now.

53
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,590
I'm like on a total, total tear.

54
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,250
I can't believe this is still going.

55
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,379
Hydro is not supposed to last this long.

56
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:40,560
Oh, oh, oh, we're gonna win, we're gonna win.

57
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
You know what, let's do it.

58
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
With all my crits.

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,629
Let's make this happen.

60
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:48,629
Come on, come on, cap it, cap it.

61
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,629
Yeah.

62
00:03:51,770 --> 00:04:00,199
Hydro, where you get 13 points, six points, and three points, and you win the game.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,520
Did I just really get somebody?

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,520
Look at this room.

65
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,520
This hallway is just stuffed full of people.

66
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,270
I didn't kill him.

67
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,410
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

68
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,980
Get off this point.

69
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,180
Geez.

70
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,060
All right, well, I'm sticking around here.

71
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,060
I don't want just some random dude to walk right in and just instantly win the game.

72
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,449
That does not bode well.

73
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,449
We got, there's an engineer over here now.

74
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,069
I think we should be okay.

75
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:47,639
The question is, can we, hey, hey, come here.

76
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,199
What?

77
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,500
Where did he go?

78
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,810
Did he drop down?

79
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,750
I'm confused.

80
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,699
I'm dropping down, screw it.

81
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,899
What just happened?

82
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:06,060
165, that did 165 damage?

83
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,620
I jumped off.

84
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,620
That was like a 10-foot drop.

85
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,930
That's bullshit.

86
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,699
For this experiment to work, we've got to win three times.

87
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,839
Did once and do it again.

88
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,230
Ooh, gotcha.

89
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,920
Ooh, gotcha.

90
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,290
This is going to be a second win.

91
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,290
This is going to be a second win.

92
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,850
All right, this is win number two.

93
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,389
And I don't even need to make an edit, I don't think, because that was like two seconds.

94
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:40,079
So we can just keep talking about, like, I don't know, the weather.

95
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,449
So it's kind of sunny out right now, overcast right now.

96
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:44,620
It ain't bad.

97
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,180
It ain't very good either.

98
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,810
Well, I know how to play territory control.

99
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,810
Don't worry.

100
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,810
I've played it before, Valve.

101
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,620
Let's do it again.

102
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,930
In the same, like, two minutes, let's get the third victory on Hydro.

103
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,879
And then I can go eat, like, a banana because I had just bought a bunch of bananas.

104
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,250
So, like, why not, right?

105
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,250
Why wouldn't you eat a bunch of bananas if you bought?

106
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,250
Why there's this many people in this one tunnel?

107
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,620
This is like, we're going to win.

108
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,120
This is it.

109
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,870
Yeah, this is a game where I didn't do anything.

110
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,870
I didn't do anything.

111
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,870
I didn't do anything.

112
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,870
Game over.

113
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,870
Game over four points.

114
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,269
Dude, what?

115
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:35,990
Let's do it again.

116
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,360
Third time's a charm.

117
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Let's go.

118
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,430
No, no edits.

119
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,430
We're not doing any editing right now.

120
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:48,430
I want to see for myself if it's possible to get the trifecta on Hydro in less than,

121
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,430
like, four or five minutes.

122
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,500
Because if it is, wait a minute, no, don't let this guy get by.

123
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,740
He can't break up the trifecta.

124
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Oh, he really is.

125
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,370
What is he?

126
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,370
What?

127
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,370
What is happening?

128
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,269
Where is this point?

129
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:06,269
How did we just win the game?

130
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:10,920
It's just chaos.

131
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Hydro.

132
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,100
Look at this whole team.

133
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,149
There's no rhyme or reason to anything that's happening right now.

134
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:24,149
Things are just happening.

135
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,899
And we're going to win.

136
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:28,139
Yeah.

137
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,139
Congratulations, Red Team.

138
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,139
You did it.

139
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,639
You won.
