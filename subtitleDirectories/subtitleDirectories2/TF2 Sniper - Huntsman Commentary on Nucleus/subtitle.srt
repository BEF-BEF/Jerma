1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:13,410
Hey, what is happening guys? It's Jerma here again with another gameplay commentary for Team Fortress 2.

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,910
This time I'm playing as the Huntsman Sniper on King of the Hill Nucleus.

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,410
This is not the gameplay. This is kind of the beginning. I jumped in a little late.

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,589
I'm gonna show you the gameplay after this. This is kind of just a few headshots and stuff like that, kind of,

5
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:31,260
because I didn't want a two minute gameplay, so after this is when the actual gameplay starts.

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,259
But I go on a pretty good run here, get a few headshots, get some good nice long shots. You know the deal.

7
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:42,259
Huntsman is fun. This is the Huntsman, the Vintage Jurati, and the Shahenshah.

8
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:46,439
And this spy, I knew he was a spy, come around the corner, I just smash him.

9
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,439
Don't know why he just was standing there, but you know, probably just caught off guard coming around the corner.

10
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:55,679
If you're looking for Huntsman tips and strategies and stuff like that, this is not gonna be the video for it.

11
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:02,179
I have a video up on my channel using the Huntsman, showing you real strategies how to use it, how to get better with it.

12
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:07,180
So I suggest you go, I think it was a month or so back, just go search in my channel page.

13
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:12,180
I believe it's called Huntsman tips and tricks. So if you're looking for that video, that's what it's called.

14
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,180
Now very, very briefly, I want to talk about my livestream schedule.

15
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:22,180
I know that a lot of you guys are going back to school or are already in school right now.

16
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,180
So I gotta change my livestream schedule so I don't have to be like,

17
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,680
oh, I gotta stay up till four in the morning to watch Jerma, then I have to wake up in two hours to go to school.

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,680
I don't want that to happen, so I'm gonna change my livestreaming to Saturdays only.

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm not gonna do it two times a week anymore, guys.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,680
Only Saturday nights, Saturday evenings at around six o'clock Eastern Standard Time.

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,680
I'm sorry if that screws up your schedule that you had when you originally were watching me,

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,980
but that's gonna be the way it is because I know a lot of you guys are in school,

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,980
so you're not gonna be able to do it on the weekdays anyways.

24
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,980
So that means that today is Saturday, so there will be a livestream tonight.

25
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,219
Check your local listings because I'm not gonna be able to tell you what time it is in Germany

26
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:06,219
when it ends up being six or seven o'clock Eastern Time in the United States.

27
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:08,400
So that's gonna happen tonight.

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Stay alert on my Steam group because that's the only place I'm gonna ever tell you.

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Maybe on my YouTube, but that's about it.

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
So let's start talking about the gameplay now.

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Fresh start, three minutes, three minutes, King of the Hill Nucleus,

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
using the Huntsman, the Girardi, and the Shahansha, like I said.

33
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Standing still, Demoman gets shot right in his face,

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,400
and looks like we're gonna cap the point. I think we get it, actually. We do.

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
This part is actually kind of funny.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Scout comes after me with the candy cane, and I think I'm gonna get him.

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Oh, what's this? Another Scout coming after me and a Spy.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
This is fantastic. Nothing bad's gonna happen here.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Get the kill on the Scout, but I get shot in the face by the other Scout.

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,770
Got our death out of the way right there.

41
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,770
That's the only time I die during this particular gameplay.

42
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,770
Let's keep going here. Roll out of the spawn.

43
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,770
I was thinking about spamming the point, but it looks like our team has it pretty well secured.

44
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,770
Heavy Engineer on the point.

45
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,770
I don't think I have to stick around here and get myself killed.

46
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,770
That's a Spy. I know it.

47
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,770
You can always tell if a Scout is a Spy, because he's running slower than a Scout.

48
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,069
And watch this! God, he just, like, breaks his neck on the wall right there.

49
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:12,069
I thought that was ridiculous.

50
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:14,069
We only have an Engineer sitting on the point right now,

51
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,069
so I figured I have to get over here at some point.

52
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:20,069
This Scout tracking a Scout is the most difficult thing in the world.

53
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:23,069
I end up getting him, though, with a nice little track shot.

54
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,069
You'll see I turn around, he's coming up the stairs,

55
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:28,379
and I just barely get the shot correct.

56
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:32,379
And there we go. Me and this Engineer got this point pretty much on lockdown.

57
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,379
Minute and 47 seconds now.

58
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,379
They still have three minutes left.

59
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:39,379
They haven't capped the point one time, which is huge,

60
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:41,379
because we're more than halfway there now.

61
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:45,379
Probably securing a victory, unless they can pull off something really, really crazy.

62
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:49,379
Coming around here just to check the perimeter, and I see a flaming Heavy.

63
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,379
Guys, your teammates really appreciate it,

64
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:55,379
and you get points for putting them out with a compression or a Girardi,

65
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,379
so if you don't already do this, please start doing it.

66
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:59,379
People really appreciate it.

67
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,379
This Spy right here comes up behind this Heavy.

68
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,379
I'm going to slow it down for you. Watch what happens.

69
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:07,379
He backstabs the Heavy and gets headshot at the exact same time,

70
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,379
and both of their reactions, I thought, were so funny.

71
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,379
I was dying laughing at that one.

72
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,620
So I come down here, shooting near their spawn area,

73
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,620
I get a couple of kills.

74
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,620
This is a great thing to do on Nucleus,

75
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,620
because so many people are just pouring out of this doorway.

76
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,620
It's such a small little corridor that you're pretty much guaranteed

77
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,620
to kill at least one person coming out of here.

78
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,620
Throw the Girardi.

79
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,620
Don't get anybody covered with it, but it's all right.

80
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,620
I end up making this Pyro free Willy off the edge here.

81
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,620
He falls way down to the depths.

82
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,620
So I get on the point, turn around, I see a Sniper,

83
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,620
and I know for a fact he's going to go to the little spot right there,

84
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,620
and I end up timing it right, get the kill.

85
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,620
That's what's going to happen.

86
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,620
There's a Sniper on this map.

87
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,620
They're either right in that corner,

88
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,620
or they're going to be at the top right on one of the balconies.

89
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,620
That's pretty much every single Sniper spot.

90
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,620
Get another kill for a Soldier that was coming for the point,

91
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,620
and I get another kill on a Pyro coming for the point.

92
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,620
So now there's less than 30 seconds.

93
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,620
Everybody's here.

94
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,800
The whole family is here on the point just hanging out.

95
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Dead Ringer Spy activates his cloak,

96
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
but he's not going to be able to do a whole lot,

97
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
because there's so many people squashed on the point.

98
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
He's going to have to bury his way into people,

99
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
and he probably will end up just falling off the edge,

100
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,170
so I'm not concerned about that.

101
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,170
So slowly we are all creeping up to their spawn door

102
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,170
with less than 10 seconds now,

103
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,170
less than 5 seconds.

104
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,170
The game is over with a flawless victory.

105
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,170
Thanks everybody so much for watching.

106
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,170
I really appreciate it.

107
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,170
Hopefully you show up tonight to the livestream.

108
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,170
If you don't, that's cool too.

109
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,170
I'm glad you watch the videos on YouTube wherever you watch them.

110
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,170
Thank you so much.

111
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,170
Take care everybody. I'll see you all next time.
