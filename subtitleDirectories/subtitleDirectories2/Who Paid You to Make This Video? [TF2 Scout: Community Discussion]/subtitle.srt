00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,820
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Excel for Microsoft Windows.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,820
It's a gameplay commentary. As you can see, the background is going to be me using Microsoft Excel,

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,820
which is probably one of the best releases gaming-wise this year.

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,820
And yes, I gotta get this out of the way. Yes, this is a paid upload.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,820
I was paid $27,000 to make this video from Microsoft from actually the CEO Bill Gates.

6
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,000
He handed me actually two briefcases full of $100 bills,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and they all were kissed individually by Bill Gates, so I take it as you want it.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But anyways, we're going to talk about Microsoft Excel again. This is the best game to come out this year.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And now we're going to drop this little facade and talk about why I'm bringing this up.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,820
First of all, let's transition to some actual gameplay here. We're going to transition to...

11
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,820
I don't know what it is. It's going to be some random game. It could be TF2. It could be SMITE.

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,820
I don't know what the gameplay is, but I do need to bring this up,

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:08,819
because it seems like every time I upload a video that's not TF2 or that's not like a big AAA title,

14
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,819
there's always at least a few people that ask me,

15
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:13,819
did you get paid to upload this video?

16
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:20,120
And some people get quite upset over this notion that there could be a video on this channel that somebody paid me for,

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:27,120
or any YouTuber, that you got paid to play a game or to talk about a certain game or to upload a certain game.

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,730
And to firstly bring this up to start off talking about this, I have never been paid to play a game.

19
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:39,730
That's never happened. All the videos on this channel are games that I really enjoy playing,

20
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,730
that I've spent a lot of time with, that I actually enjoy the experiences of.

21
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:49,730
You're never going to see an upload on this channel of a game that I didn't generally enjoy.

22
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,730
A game that I didn't... Or let's rephrase that a little bit.

23
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,900
But games that just came out can fit in this category too.

24
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,900
Like if a game just released, I'm doing a review or a breakdown or first impressions.

25
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,900
That's the same thing. So I would say those are the two categories of video content on this channel.

26
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,900
If it's not a skit, if it's not me doing a vlog or just kind of like a general podcast type video where I bring up a topic.

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,900
The gameplay on this channel will always fit into one of those categories.

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,900
I'm never going to just accept from Satan.

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,080
He comes up to me with a contract and he says,

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,379
Jeremy, I want you to sign on the dotted line. I'm going to pay you $5,000 for you to upload my shitty game.

31
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:38,379
That's not going to happen. The only time I've declined, guys, this is what a lot of people don't realize,

32
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,379
and a lot of YouTubers can vouch for this as well.

33
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:46,379
I've declined a lot of offers from people that I just didn't see as making sense to put on my channel.

34
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,620
The notion of paid videos irks me. It really does.

35
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:58,620
It really kind of gets under my skin unless it's something that I'm already a big fan of or something that I'm really excited for.

36
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:07,180
But the flip side of the coin here, an argument for something like a paid video or a paid playtime or a stream or something like that,

37
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,180
is a lot of YouTubers do this for a living.

38
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,180
A lot of guys wake up in the morning, myself included.

39
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,180
We get up in the morning, we come up with these ideas, we try to make new content.

40
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,419
We're always trying to innovate on things, make better videos, try to make the highest quality videos we possibly can.

41
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:27,419
And maybe it is okay for somebody to take a couple of paid videos because it's just more money in their pocket,

42
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:32,419
more money they can use to spend on improving the channel, buying more games, buying more stuff.

43
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:39,419
Now, I'm not saying that all these deals should be done because there are some of these deals that are just, let's just face it, downright stupid.

44
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,419
Like really, really stupid, and they are completely meaningless videos, completely meaningless things.

45
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,419
But there are some things that are worthwhile.

46
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:54,419
And the reason why I started this video out as the Microsoft Excel type thing is because that's the type of thing that I see as stupid, I see as dumb.

47
00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:00,419
But if it's an actual gaming video and it's something that the person, the YouTuber happens to be involved in,

48
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:08,419
then I find that to be okay, especially because of the state of YouTube right now, how, you know, monetizing views is so difficult at the moment.

49
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:12,599
And it really just comes down to, I guess, channel integrity.

50
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,599
Do you want to be known as the guy that has a paid video every two weeks?

51
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,600
Or do you want to be known as somebody that is supporting good companies or that's supporting their own channel

52
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
and not taking every single handout from companies that they ever receive?

53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,100
But I guess this is the part of the video where I open it up to you guys.

54
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
I want to get a discussion going in the comments.

55
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Let me know how you feel about this because, like I said in the beginning, it is a very touchy subject to a lot of people.

56
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:47,100
The notion of even ad revenue on YouTube just by people running ads, it's, you get into a really weird set of waters here

57
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:54,100
because once you bring money really into anything, you can cause a lot of problems and a lot of conflict can arise.

58
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,100
And in reality, that happens everywhere, not just on YouTube.

59
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,100
You're talking about every business, every friendship.

60
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,100
There's so many cases where money can really destroy things.

61
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,269
And I want to get your opinions on that, so please let me hear them.

62
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,269
Anyways, that's going to wrap up the video, guys, so thank you so much for watching.

63
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:17,269
I really do appreciate it, and I'll see you guys all next time.

64
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:19,269
And of course, take care, everybody.
