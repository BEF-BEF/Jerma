00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:13,169
Hey what is happening guys, it's Germa again with a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:17,170
This time we are on Payload Race Pipeline, which is one of the better maps in Team Fortress 2.

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,170
Unfortunately nobody plays it, so if you ever are in your server browser and you see Pipeline,

4
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,170
double click it because I promise you it is one of the funner maps in Team Fortress 2.

5
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:33,600
And for those of you new players, Payload Race Pipeline is essentially the same exact thing as a Gold Rush or a Badwater.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,600
The only difference is the first person to push their cart to the very end of the track wins the game.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
And you'll see there is just absolute chaos. Once the two carts reach the middle,

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,600
once one cart is right next to the other cart, it gets absolutely insane.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,600
And it's a whole lot of fun, so I highly recommend it. Play it if you see it, it's a lot of fun.

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,600
And real quickly I want to thank everybody, not only from my YouTube channel, but all the guys on the Respawn Army app.

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,599
You guys have been so, so supportive and so helpful. Really thank you so much.

12
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:10,599
There's nothing else I could say besides thank you so much for all your support. It really means a lot to me guys.

13
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:17,599
So let's get this gameplay started. Playing as the Engineer with the default sentry gun, the Frontier Justice and the pistol.

14
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,599
Just trying to get this dispenser up on the front line so people, if they need to, can run back and get healed.

15
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,599
I'm very, very aggressive when I play Engineer on these types of maps.

16
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,599
So if you're looking at it and you're saying, Jerma, what are you doing? Don't move your sentry. Just keep it there.

17
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,599
Oh my god. I like to move very, very quickly, so I'm sorry if that upsets anybody.

18
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,599
Anyways, our team has a real commanding lead at this point. We have an uber heavy on the cart.

19
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,599
I know now it's safe enough to be able to move my sentry and my dispenser up to that point up here.

20
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:50,599
This is a great place. If you're going to play Engineer on this map, put your sentry right here.

21
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:53,599
There's no better place in the world because this is the crossroads.

22
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,599
This is the point where everybody has to come by at some point.

23
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:02,599
The only people that aren't going to come by this point on the other team is somebody that's a spy or a scout that ran the other direction.

24
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:08,599
Everybody has to push this cart at some point, and me and this other Engineer have this place on total lockdown.

25
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:12,840
Kills a couple of people right off the bat, and I want to bring up something really important.

26
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,840
You probably shouldn't build this close to another Engineer.

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
See how I had my sentry when this guy kind of came over and dropped his sentry right near mine?

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,840
It's not a good idea. You want to build your sentries at least 15 feet apart from each other

29
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,840
only because if a Demoman were to show up right now, like an uber Demoman or an uber Pyro,

30
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,840
things would get really, really ugly, and we potentially could lose both of the sentries.

31
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,840
So make sure you stay as spread out as you possibly can.

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,139
I saw this spy backstab the Medic, so I knew he was a spy.

33
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:47,139
He's using the Eternal Reward, which if you don't know, when you backstab somebody with that particular knife,

34
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:50,139
it makes you disguise instantly as that person.

35
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:56,139
And now you are going to see the Super Engineer and one of the biggest feats of strength ever.

36
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:58,139
Well, not ever, but it's really cool.

37
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,139
I turn this corner, I see there's an uber there, I have my revenge crits.

38
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,379
They don't kill the Teleporter.

39
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,379
Take a look at the top left part of the screen.

40
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,379
They didn't kill the Teleporter, and they're making a huge push right now.

41
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:13,620
Watch what Super German Engineer ends up doing right here.

42
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,620
This isn't even built yet. It finally ends up getting built, and I sneak onto it.

43
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,620
They don't even know it's here, and look at this.

44
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,620
Bang, you're dead. Hey, what's going on, Demoman?

45
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,620
You're dead, and then you are dead as well, Heavy.

46
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,620
And that was a complete and total screw up on their part,

47
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,620
because if they had just seen that Teleporter, that definitely would not have happened.

48
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,620
And now we are back where we were, and this Teleporter is getting upgraded.

49
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,620
They destroy the sentry, it's okay, I don't care.

50
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,620
I actually turn this, this is definitely a spy, how you doing?

51
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,620
Nice lucky crit I get on them, but I get this Teleporter to level 3,

52
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,620
which means that my teammates don't even have to walk an inch.

53
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,620
They can come right to the front lines instantly.

54
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,620
And I turn this corner, it's actually kind of funny, there's an AFK Medic.

55
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,620
That's just kind of, I don't even know if he was AFKing on it,

56
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,620
maybe he was like typing to somebody.

57
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,620
But I end up coming out around the corner, you'll see, here he is.

58
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,620
Just, one, two, three, and you're dead.

59
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,800
Coming back here just to make sure all my stuff is in order,

60
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,800
I saw that my Teleporter needed to be repaired.

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Sentry gets an assist, and I come over to repair my Teleporter,

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,800
and now listen guys, you really have to think about this,

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,800
I can't stress this enough, if that Teleporter was destroyed,

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,339
back two minutes ago, this would have never happened,

65
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,339
and we potentially could have lost.

66
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:27,339
I'm going to stress this right now, if you see a Teleporter,

67
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:30,339
even if it's not built, if it's not swirling around,

68
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,649
if it's just kind of sitting there not built all the way up,

69
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,649
get rid of it, destroy it.

70
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,649
Make sure it's your number one priority to get rid of it,

71
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:39,649
because situations like this are going to happen,

72
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:42,649
where all the team is now up on the front lines,

73
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,649
we're all here, we're all pushing,

74
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:46,649
and then I do something crazy again,

75
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:48,649
people are going to rage about this, but I don't care,

76
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:50,649
at this point I knew we had it in the bag,

77
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:53,649
so I bring my Sentry out to the front of their spawn,

78
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:56,649
and this actually is one of the reasons why we win the game,

79
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:58,649
so before you hate on me and say this is a bad idea,

80
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:01,649
just watch, there's an Uber on the cart,

81
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,649
and they're so distracted by it that I can get it built in time,

82
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:06,649
and then here we go, deaths all around,

83
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,649
people that come out of the spawn are instantly killed,

84
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:10,649
they can't even do anything,

85
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,649
it kills about four, maybe three, four, five people,

86
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,649
I don't even remember it was so much,

87
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,649
and anyways we win the game,

88
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,649
I was on the top of the scoreboard,

89
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:21,649
awesome, awesome time, awesome game, awesome map too,

90
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:22,649
thank you all for watching,

91
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:24,649
thank you for your continued support,

92
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:26,649
and I appreciate everything guys,

93
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:28,649
thank you, take care.
