1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:14,130
I'm already just so exhausted from even trying to put this together. There hasn't

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,410
been an ounce of enthusiasm in my voice since we started talking about this, but

3
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,530
now we're ready. I sent you the info. Let's do this. You like do not want to do this at

4
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:30,170
all. I almost like threw up. Did you hear that? A little bit, yeah. So here's

5
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,770
what the deal is, right? So here's Ster. He's a soldier right here. He's on

6
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,890
red team. I'm on blue team. This is upward. We are going to both have a team

7
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:44,170
of easy mode bots. That means our bots are at the lowest difficulty they could

8
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:54,409
possibly be at. And why is there a tank? This feels familiar. So no, no, don't

9
00:00:54,409 --> 00:01:04,019
break your own fucking server. Can you give me one second to explain what's

10
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:04,659
happening?

11
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:20,200
I can't believe you made like a trail to yourself. Okay. Yeah, I really didn't

12
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,260
think you were ever going to be able to do this. You brought the truck punch

13
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:31,299
line over into Team Fortress 2 and your server is going to crash. There's no way

14
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:37,780
we're making out of this one. This place is shutting down. Shit's like flying by

15
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:44,239
my screen. Oh, no, we invested our money poorly. We didn't put it into a 401k.

16
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,359
It's disappearing. All of our money is disappearing. You wanted to invest in a

17
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:57,209
lollipop company. It's all gone. All right, come on out. Um, they're they are

18
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,530
not leaving. Oh, yeah, they have one person. It seems two of them has left.

19
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,650
They're a little bit delayed. They're making some progress. Don't worry. We

20
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,810
have a we have our sentry set up in a very optimal situation with a scout not

21
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,930
moving standing next to it. Oh, I think I think my guys are pushing in. We got

22
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,050
it. We got a heavy medic combination coming in through the front control

23
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,770
point here. Pyro coming out here. Looks like you see your spy. No, I'm watching

24
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:32,849
the action. There is no, what are they doing? What is he still doing? He's out

25
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:40,030
of bullets, I think. Oh, okay. I'm going to, I'm going to pay attention to

26
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,270
something else. Why is they doing a melee fight? Are you kidding me right

27
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:53,300
now? What the fuck? Did you seriously make every single person a spy? Yes. Oh,

28
00:02:53,300 --> 00:03:00,939
my God. What are they doing? What is your team doing? What? Why are they

29
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:05,180
freaking out in the corner over here? That's just what spies do. This is what

30
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,210
you should be aiming for. Oh, make sure you're disguised. Make sure he doesn't

31
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:17,300
see you. I just heard like 10 seconds. I wonder if one. Why are they trying to

32
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,539
jump through the boards? That doesn't work like that. You're not like made out

33
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:34,580
of taffy. Here we go. Um, here they go. I'm unstoppable. Don't even tell it.

34
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,280
Please don't tell me they're all gonna keep coming out of this door. Where else

35
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,879
would they go? I don't know. One option. I just, I go out this door. Oh, you're

36
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:49,479
spies. I think you like broke them. Hold on. Let me see where they are. Are they

37
00:03:49,479 --> 00:04:04,680
done? No, they're all going out the front door. This is stupid. No, they're

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:17,420
going after each other. There was one too many of them. No one's gonna go

39
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,180
for the point. This is gonna last exactly three minutes and 32 seconds

40
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,389
because there's absolutely no way any of these brainless son of a bitches are

41
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:32,629
gonna go for that point. Okay, this one engineer is really just going for gold.

42
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:37,579
We actually capped it. Really? How the hell did that happen? I don't know. Maybe

43
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:40,100
had something to do with the tank.

44
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:53,089
It's just going through. They're all gonna get stuck on it. They're all just shooting it like what the hell is this block of the door?

45
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:57,930
This guy's freaking out. I'm about to get trick stabbed. No, no, no. Is it actually making its way in?

46
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:11,329
No, it's not. Is it? Please crush them. Please crush. You go for like crushing them. No, it didn't kill them. They got it in. They got it in.

47
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:41,029
I'm gonna die. This should not be happening. Drive up. They're actually doing enough damage to it.

48
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:57,490
Engineers on the back of the tank? Yes. Oh my god. Oh, you didn't think this could get even dumber. It's genetic. They just keep getting right over.

49
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:13,000
Alright, redo. Retake. I need like a second before I throw up. Why are they all taunting?

50
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:22,569
They don't even know where to shoot yet. Why are they not shooting you? Because the round doesn't start. I'm not supposed to be out here.

51
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:30,959
Oh, they're that confused about the round not being started yet. That they refuse to shoot you. What are they?

52
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,389
This doesn't make any... Wait, I want to see what happens in one second.

53
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:45,560
How is anybody on blue team gonna get anything done? You have such a huge advantage.

54
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,959
Because you're allowed to build your sentries first. My guys are being like dumbasses trying to do like leapfrog in the spawn.

55
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:59,259
Hey, you could be a little bit more respectful. Just wait. Wait till this 12 seconds counts down.

56
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:02,259
I bet you every single one of these guys just walks out and just gets eaten alive.

57
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:08,339
Eaten alive by what? We barely have a defense. The sentry mosquitoes.

58
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:13,279
Alright, here we go. You need a catchphrase for everything. Here we go. Let's see what happens.

59
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,279
Oh, this is gonna work. This is gonna work. They all backed up instantly.

60
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,279
Nah, let's just build them back here. Let's start getting these teleporters up.

61
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,279
They're so confused. You're still prioritizing the teleporters over sentries.

62
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,279
Yeah, they'd rather build teleporters than sentries.

63
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,279
No, seriously, this was done. The joke was over.

64
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,279
That joke ended so long ago.

65
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:44,269
Why do you have to fucking ruin everything?
