00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,380
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,550
And tonight, we got a lot to talk about in this video. A ton of stuff is going to be in this video.

3
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,550
Not only am I going to go over all of the Pyromania update items,

4
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:31,550
I'm also going to go over all the insane changes they did to all the existing items already in play.

5
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,729
So let's not waste any time, going to get this started right now, talking about the Scout first.

6
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,729
The Scout got two brand new items in this update.

7
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:44,729
The first of which is called Baby Faces Blaster, all part of, by the way, the public enemy set.

8
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:52,729
Baby Faces Blaster, 40% more accurate shots, on hit builds boost, run it up to double speed at maximum boost,

9
00:00:52,729 --> 00:01:00,729
minus 30% damage done, and 35% slower movement speed on wearer, and if you jump, it resets the boost.

10
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:04,900
Now how this weapon works, it's actually pretty cool.

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,900
As you shoot people, it takes about three or four good meat shots on somebody to fill the whole boost meter.

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,900
The meter doesn't start draining, it's not a thing you have to fill like a rage meter, and it goes down.

13
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,900
As you build the boost meter, you're going to run a little bit faster.

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,900
And when you get to about half boost, that's about the default speed of a normal Scout.

15
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,900
When you get to over that, you start running like you have speed hacks.

16
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,900
It is ridiculous. As you can see on the screen here, you go a thousand miles per hour.

17
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:41,900
You're going so fast, and it's so accurate, that planning meat shots on somebody when you're going 180, 190% movement speed is very hard.

18
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:48,079
And of course, jumping, you're going to bring that back all the way to minus 35% movement speed.

19
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,079
No matter if you jump once, if you jump twice, anytime you're in the air, it is going to bring that down to minus 35%.

20
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,079
And that is a spy buff, by the way. This item is a spy buff.

21
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:05,079
Because now you can never know if a spy Scout is actually a spy, because he might be using this weapon.

22
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,319
All in all, though, this weapon is going to be amazing on five CP maps.

23
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,319
You're going to be able to run from one end of the map to the other in five seconds.

24
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,009
So moving on to the second Scout unlockable, the Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol.

25
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:25,009
It is, of course, a pistol, secondary, plus 15% max health on wearer.

26
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:33,009
Wearer never takes falling damage, and minus 25% slower firing speed, and you take 50% more fire damage.

27
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:36,310
So this weapon, as of right now, is pretty difficult to use.

28
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,310
Of course, because the Meet the Pyro and all the Pyro stuff that just came out, everybody's a damn Pyro.

29
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,310
Wearing this right now is not really recommended.

30
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,620
But in the long run, I could see this thing being very, very useful.

31
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,860
Now, you're not going to get as much health as putting on the Milkman set, but it's only 10 less.

32
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,860
And plus, you're not going to take any falling damage.

33
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,860
So I think this is the answer to, if you want the Milkman set health bonus,

34
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,860
but you don't want to put on the short stomp or you don't want to put on the Mad Milk or the fish or something like that,

35
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,289
I think this is the alternative.

36
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,289
So sticking with the Scout, we're going to talk about some of the current item changes.

37
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:21,289
The Criticola now has a 25% increased movement speed while active, and instead of 6 seconds, it is now 8 seconds.

38
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:26,289
The Bonk Atomic Punch is now 8 seconds rather than 6 seconds.

39
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,289
Both of those items got a massive buff in this update.

40
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,719
So let's move right down the line here.

41
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:37,719
Moving on to the Soldier, we're going to talk about his item changes and his brand new toy, the Beggar's Bazooka.

42
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,960
This is my favorite item in this update.

43
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
I love this rocket launcher.

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Here is what it does.

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,139
First of all, it starts with zero rockets in the clip.

46
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:53,139
And as you hold the fire button down, it can load up to three rockets to shoot.

47
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:58,139
When you release it, no matter if there's one rocket in there, two rockets, or three rockets,

48
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,139
they are all going to come out at the same time.

49
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,139
Now the big downside with this weapon is, of course, the projectile deviation,

50
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:09,139
and you can't collect ammo from dispensers.

51
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,139
I'll talk about the overloading the chamber thing in a second.

52
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:15,139
But the three degrees deviation actually can be a pain in the butt,

53
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:19,310
especially when you overload it and you launch out three rockets at the same time.

54
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,310
They kind of go in different directions and it's hard to aim them.

55
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,310
But if you turn a corner, you're going to see a couple of different times in this little Soldier gameplay I got,

56
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:34,310
I turn a corner and unleash three rockets and slaughter everybody that's in that hallway,

57
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,310
especially if you have crits or you have the buff banner.

58
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,490
Another downside of this thing, though, is if you load up more than three rockets,

59
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:48,490
if you go one, two, three, it's going to explode and you're going to take a lot of damage.

60
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,490
So as long as you have a little bit of self-control and you don't allow that to happen,

61
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,490
this thing is very, very deadly.

62
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:00,240
Moving right along here, we're going to talk about these Soldiers' old items and some of the buffs they gave them.

63
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
First of all, the equalizer.

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,800
The equalizer is no longer one entity. They split it up into two.

65
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
There is now the equalizer and the escape plan.

66
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,100
One of them is just movement speed and the other one is just damage increase.

67
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
You have to actually pick now.

68
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,100
I'm so glad they made this change because nobody ever took the equalizer off for really any reason.

69
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Another huge change they made for the Soldier is the Conqueror.

70
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Remember the Conqueror, the shell? When was the last time you equipped that thing?

71
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Well, now you're going to put it on because they buffed it.

72
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,100
So now, instead of doing damage and taking damage to fill it,

73
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,100
now you only have to do damage just like the buff banner.

74
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,100
And they increase the rate at which you charge this thing by 25%.

75
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,100
And that makes me happy because now I'm probably going to put this thing on and give it a go every now and then.

76
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,600
So that's going to wrap up the Soldier.

77
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Let's talk about the Pyro now.

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,600
The Pyromania update, which was named for the Pyro, and of course, Meet the Pyro, which was hysterical.

79
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,600
And if you've seen Meet the Pyro, then you know where this next set of items comes from.

80
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,029
None of these things have stats.

81
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:14,029
None of these things are increased damage or do a certain thing to your character or something.

82
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:16,029
They are just reskins.

83
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:21,029
All of these new rainbow items are just reskins, which is a little disappointing.

84
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:25,029
But at the same time, it's all for this Pyro land mode.

85
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:27,029
Now, Pyro land. What is Pyro land?

86
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:34,029
Essentially, whenever you equip one of these new goofy weird items, it's going to change the way Team Fortress looks for you.

87
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:36,029
You want to talk about an art style change?

88
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,029
It throws up rainbows into your face.

89
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:42,029
I can't even look at this for more than five minutes.

90
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,029
It's like ridiculous to me.

91
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:50,029
The only way you can see this and the only way you're going to be able to use these items is if you are in Pyro land.

92
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:52,029
And again, how you get into Pyro land?

93
00:06:52,029 --> 00:07:01,029
You just equip one of these items or you put on the free goggles that are going to be given to anybody that logs into Team Fortress before July 5th.

94
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,029
So that's how you see this.

95
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:04,029
And like I said, kind of disappointing.

96
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,029
I wish they did a little more with these items.

97
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:16,029
Maybe give the Pyro some more stuff, some more things to play with, because he only really got this one real item that unfortunately is probably the worst in the update.

98
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:23,029
It's actually ironic that the Pyro, the Pyro update, he gets one item and it's pretty underpowered.

99
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:25,209
So the Scorch Shot, what it does.

100
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:30,209
Flare knocks back target on hit and ignites enemies in a small radius.

101
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,209
You can shoot the ground with this thing.

102
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:33,209
I need to clearly explain that.

103
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:39,209
If you shoot the ground just like a rocket, it will light anybody that's on fire near where you shot it.

104
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:45,209
The major downside, of course, is the minus 50% damage penalty on this thing.

105
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:48,209
And it cannot crit.

106
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,209
It doesn't mini-crit.

107
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,209
It doesn't full-crit.

108
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:55,209
It's just going to do 15 damage and afterburn to anybody that's in that area.

109
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,509
That's really unfortunate.

110
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:01,509
If this mini-crit or this crit, it would have been a great item.

111
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:09,509
But as of right now, the Detonator essentially does the exact same thing as this minus the knockback and it can mini-crit.

112
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:13,509
So until they potentially buff this item, it's very underpowered.

113
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,509
I mean, it has its uses, though.

114
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:16,509
You can knock people off a cart.

115
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:18,689
You can shoot somebody off a point.

116
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:28,180
But not being able to ignite somebody and then mini-crit them or crit them, especially with the amount of damage this thing does, it's, like I said, very underpowered.

117
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,179
Transitioning now to talk about the old Pyro flamethrowers and what they have done in this update.

118
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:40,490
The number one thing you got to know, they increased all flamethrowers' base damage by 10%.

119
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,490
All of them across the board.

120
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,490
And then they went ahead and did this.

121
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,490
They removed the plus 10% damage on the backburner.

122
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,490
So now it's just base plus 10%, not plus 20%, because that's what it would have been.

123
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,490
And they did minus 10% on the degreaser.

124
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:02,730
So they kind of leveled the playing field across all the flamethrowers, which is great because the stock flamethrower was a little underwhelming.

125
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,730
And it's good to see that they decided to do this.

126
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,730
And now it doesn't matter if you use the degreaser or the backburner or the Flogistinator.

127
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,899
And speaking of the Flogistinator, they nerfed the Flogistinator again.

128
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:22,899
So what they did is they took the defense taunt damage reduction down from 90% to 75%.

129
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:27,399
It kind of stops them from being invincible when they do that taunt.

130
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,399
Now I want to go to some heavy news and some heavy changes that they did.

131
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,399
And no, the heavy did not get any new items in this update, but they did change a lot of stuff for him.

132
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,399
And they did a massive change to not only the Gloves of Running Urgently, but the Tommy Slav.

133
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,399
So first, let's talk about the Gloves of Running Urgently.

134
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,399
It is completely reworked.

135
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
There is no more self-damage penalty.

136
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,399
So when you take them out, you don't take six, six, six.

137
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,399
They took that, it's gone.

138
00:09:52,399 --> 00:10:02,399
Now what happens is when you pull out the Gloves of Running Urgently, you're going to take mini crits while they're active and for three seconds after switching them.

139
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,580
They also took the 50% damage penalty down to 25%.

140
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,820
That's a massive change.

141
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,820
They really reworked that entire item.

142
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:19,059
So talking about more changes to the heavy, the Tommy Slav used to have plus 40% faster spin up time on that minigun.

143
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,059
Now it's only plus 10%.

144
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:26,059
So the difference between this and the default now really isn't that much.

145
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:32,299
I guess the only difference now is the silent spin down and the 20% less bullets that come out of the Tommy Slav.

146
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,539
Pretty balanced across the board with miniguns at this point.

147
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:39,539
I would say the Brass Beast needs a buff, but that's just my opinion.

148
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:44,659
So moving on to the Demoman and the Engineer and they didn't get anything.

149
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:48,659
And they didn't get anything changed either, which makes me really sad because I love the Engineer.

150
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:50,659
It's my favorite class.

151
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:52,659
Anyways, moving on to the Medic.

152
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:56,960
All you Quick Fix users are going to be really happy about this one.

153
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
The Quick Fix has been changed.

154
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
No, they didn't add any healing.

155
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,960
No, they didn't add any overheal or uber charge or anything like that.

156
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,960
You can now rocket jump with the Quick Fix.

157
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
That's right.

158
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,960
The Quick Fix now allows you to rocket jump or sticky jump with whoever you are healing with the beam.

159
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
It is insane.

160
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,960
And that is the best thing they possibly could have done to the Quick Fix.

161
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
I'm going to use that so much more often now.

162
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Just jumping around maps with my Soldier and Demoman buddies.

163
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
It's going to be so much fun.

164
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,960
And speaking of things the Medic has that have deserved buffs for a million years,

165
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,960
the Crusader's Crossbow has finally received a buff.

166
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,139
I know, am I dreaming? I can't believe I'm actually saying this.

167
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:44,139
The reload speed time has been reduced by 40%.

168
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:46,379
Instead of pulling it out and going,

169
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:50,379
now it's going to actually be like, bang, ready to shoot.

170
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,379
Bang, ready to shoot.

171
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,379
And I wish it happened off screen just like the Flare Gun,

172
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:58,379
but I'm not going to complain because any buff to the Crusader's Crossbow is a good buff.

173
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,740
So finally closing it out with the Sniper.

174
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,740
The Spy did not get any new items and he did not get any changes.

175
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
So this is going to end the video here with the Sniper.

176
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,919
The Hitman's Heatmaker, the new Sniper rifle.

177
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:16,159
And to stop from confusing anybody, the text is actually pretty weird and misleading,

178
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,159
so I'm not going to read it out loud.

179
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:19,159
I'm going to just tell you exactly how this thing works.

180
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:22,340
On the lower right, you're going to see something called Focus.

181
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,340
Every time you kill somebody or get an assist, you're going to fill that meter by a little bit.

182
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,690
Once that meter is full, when you shoot your Sniper rifle,

183
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,690
it doesn't matter if it's a no-scope or if it is zoomed in,

184
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,690
you are going to activate the Focus.

185
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,690
And what this does is actually really, really awesome.

186
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,690
It allows you to stay zoomed in without having to click, click,

187
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,690
pull back and reload your Sniper rifle after every shot.

188
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:54,690
You're also going to get 25% faster charging time for the whole duration of the Focus.

189
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,690
Now the reason why the text is a little misleading is you can unscope from this if you want.

190
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,690
You don't have to stay scoped in.

191
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,690
If you feel like taking the scope off, you can right-click and get right out of it.

192
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,690
See, I didn't think that at first.

193
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,690
I didn't know that at first, so I didn't even try it.

194
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,929
But no, you are not forced to stay scoped in while you are in Focus.

195
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,360
So moving on to the Cleaner's Carbine.

196
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
This is the new SMG, which is exciting enough

197
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,360
because we haven't seen a new SMG since 2007.

198
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Talking about the default stock one, of course.

199
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,360
So this on kill, 3 seconds of 100% critical chance,

200
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,360
minus 20% clip size and a 35% slower firing speed.

201
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,360
And no random critical hits because you can get them by killing people.

202
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,539
This is just like the killing gloves of boxing for the Sniper.

203
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:43,539
And it's awesome because you can use these crits for any of your weapons.

204
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:46,539
So if you pick somebody off with this thing, turn around,

205
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:50,539
whip out the Kukri and crit smash somebody in the face,

206
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,539
it is incredibly satisfying and it is fantastic.

207
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:58,029
And just like the killing gloves of boxing, you can loop the crits.

208
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:01,029
So if I keep killing people over and over again with this SMG,

209
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:04,590
I'm never going to get out of crit mode. It's amazing.

210
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:08,899
So now that we talked about the new stuff, let's bring up the old stuff.

211
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,899
There's only one thing they changed in this update for the Sniper,

212
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:12,899
and that is the Cozy Camper.

213
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:17,899
The Cozy Camper now regenerates one health every second while you wear it,

214
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,899
and they took the speed decrease down from 90% to 80%.

215
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,899
Effectively, they made the Sniper the only other self-healing class besides the Medic,

216
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:28,899
which is crazy.

217
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:33,200
And all these changes, all the things they did, it's just mind-blowing.

218
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,200
When I read these notes, when I saw these things in action,

219
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
I couldn't even believe it, guys.

220
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,200
I was like, well, they changed more items than they added new ones in this update.

221
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Really? So I had to talk about it. I had to cover this.

222
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,200
And this is a 15-minute video, and I apologize.

223
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
I wanted to get this all framed into one video.

224
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,200
And the Doomsday game mode, I'll probably be doing a separate video to talk about that.

225
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,200
And it should be here in the next couple of days, within the next day or two.

226
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,500
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

227
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
And of course, I'll see you guys all next time.

228
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Go have fun with this update. There's a lot of crazy stuff to try.

229
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
So I'll see you guys all soon, and take care, everybody.

230
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Thanks for watching.
