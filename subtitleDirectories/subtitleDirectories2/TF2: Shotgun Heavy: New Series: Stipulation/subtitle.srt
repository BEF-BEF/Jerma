00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,250
Hey, what's up, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,730
tonight, I got a very special Team Fortress 2 upload tonight, because this is the start

3
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,390
of a new series I want to do. But let's back up for just a second here. I want to give

4
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,789
you guys the origin, I guess, of this series. So a long time ago, I did a video, well not

5
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,859
really a long time ago, more like maybe a month or so ago. I uploaded a Crusaders cross

6
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,820
bow medic bonus clip on top. I think it was a Huntsman sniper gameplay. But if you remember

7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,979
that, I called it a stipulation match, where I was only allowed to use one item or two

8
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,579
items and it was a very strange way of doing things. And I believe in that one, it was

9
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:57,820
I could only use the crossbow to heal people or damage people. I could not use the medigun.

10
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,520
It was definitely a whole lot of fun. So I decided to turn it into a series. And this

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,599
is episode one of stipulation, where just like in that crossbow video, I'm only allowed

12
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:16,069
a certain set of rules or guidelines or item sets, and I have to stick to those rules.

13
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:19,909
So I'm going to start the series off with the heavy. And I really do first right off

14
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:25,230
the bat apologize for this, because it's been at least a month or two, at least that, since

15
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,769
my last heavy gameplay. And the reason why that is, is I just honestly don't really

16
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:33,730
play heavy that much anymore. I play them every now and then just kind of joking around

17
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,430
messing around. But I haven't really sat down to play heavy in a long time. But I did

18
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,599
it this time. So let's start talking about the stipulation you probably know what it

19
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:48,319
is by now by watching the screen. Only allowed to use the fists of steel and the family business

20
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:54,719
shotgun. I am not allowed to use that minigun. Minigun off limits. That is the stipulation.

21
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,329
And you'd actually be quite surprised that this setup does work very, very well. As you're

22
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,989
seeing in this gameplay, I'm killing quite a few people. And I've only died one time.

23
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:08,669
So if you guys are liking what you're seeing here, and you want to try this out on your

24
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,879
own sometime, this is the strategy I was using. You want to walk around with the fists of

25
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:19,520
steel up pretty much at all times. The only times you want to drop the fists of steel

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,939
is if you get close enough to shoot someone with your shotgun. And you can also duke people

27
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,479
out and fake people out. You'll see coming up here, me and this pyro get into it. And

28
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:31,759
so often I'll bring up the fists of steel. Because if you don't know, the fists of steel

29
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,919
absorb 40% of the damage you take. When you have them up, that is. So this setup really,

30
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,819
it's not that bad. If you can time when people are going to shoot at you, and then after

31
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,500
they're out of ammo or they're running out of ammo, like a soldier for instance, let's

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,340
say he shoots two or three rockets at you while you have these things active. And you

33
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,680
absorb a lot of that damage. You only have one rocket to worry about now. So you can

34
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,080
just put these things down, whip up the shotgun, put the guy full of lead and he might miss

35
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,479
you, or he might hit you and it might not kill you. So definitely, definitely give this

36
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,759
a try. It is a whole lot of fun. It takes you out of that typical heavy gameplay where

37
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:12,550
you pull down the minigun and just brrrrr. It takes you out of that. It's also going

38
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,949
to give you a reason to put on that shotgun. Because let's face it guys, let's be totally

39
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:22,810
honest, not very many people use the shotgun as the heavy. Nobody, especially the family

40
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,009
business, my goodness. This thing pretty much collects dust in everybody's cabinets. So

41
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:33,099
definitely give it a try. Take the sandwich off for once and just go out and have fun.

42
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:37,219
You probably just saw the top frag in that last gameplay right there. I really didn't

43
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:41,780
top frag. I was playing as a different class earlier in that round and the round was going

44
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,180
on forever and I just decided, okay, let's just do this now. I'm going to do the heavy

45
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,659
with the shotgun and the fist of steel. I think I was actually playing as a sniper earlier.

46
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:57,449
So just disregard that. So let's talk about the gameplay for a second here. I'm currently

47
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:02,370
stuck inside of this building right now because there's a heavy outside and I think MLC Stealth

48
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,090
just got the backstab on and we were in Skype and he's like, oh, I got that heavy and I

49
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,610
went, oh, thank God, because as the stipulation goes, I would have just got my ass totally

50
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:17,519
handed to me right there. So thank you MLC Stealth for saving my life. I get behind these

51
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,839
two guys right here, kill the soldier with my fists of steel and then I put the Pyro

52
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,600
six feet under as well, kill him with the shotgun, jump around here to the corner. I

53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,279
go down in that building again, just trying to get some more health and some more ammo,

54
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,240
even though I don't really need the ammo. So at this point I'm thinking maybe I should

55
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,300
get on that cart. I don't know why I thought this was a good idea. Maybe I just forgot

56
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,300
that I couldn't use my minigun because I see this Pyro and then watch, I get air blasted

57
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,019
almost off the cliff. Oh my God, it almost happens twice. I don't know how I ended up

58
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:52,620
surviving that. I should have gone right off of that goddamn cliff, but the gods of Hightower

59
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,009
were on my side at that point. So coming up to the end of the gameplay here, I'm checking

60
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:00,569
this spy over and over again. I don't know why I could have just bumped into him. Like

61
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:05,300
are you a spy? No, are you a spy? No, he's not. I get a lucky crit on this Pyro, pull

62
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,620
up the fist of steel and shab-bam right in his face and then I get the karma because

63
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,230
I get crit right in my face. So that is going to be the end of this gameplay, guys. Thank

64
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,649
you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. Just wanted to showcase another

65
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:25,209
small clip, I guess, of using this setup. And if you have any suggestions, if you guys

66
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:30,850
want to see a certain stipulation, then definitely, definitely drop me a comment and we'll go

67
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,259
from there. So thanks guys again. I'll see you all soon and take care everybody.
