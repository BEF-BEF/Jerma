1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,199
Meltdown. Battle of Chistan Cliffs, Pakistan. One in the chamber.

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,199
Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here with One in the Chamber, just said the name of the game mode.

3
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,699
This is going to be a live commentary of me messing around on One in the Chamber, which if you don't know what this is,

4
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:32,740
well this is Call of Duty Black Ops 2, where you only get one bullet, kind of like the golden gun in 007.

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,740
One shot kill. If you kill somebody, you get your bullet back. And you get three lives.

6
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:44,700
So, let's...come here you son of a bitch!

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,700
You can also knife people as well. As you just...

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Damn it!

9
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:55,369
Alright, I gotta be careful here. I only got one life. I'm on my final life.

10
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:01,880
I'm gonna get smoked. I'm gonna get smoked.

11
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,079
There's a guy right here. Get out of my face!

12
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,079
Come on, I got this guy right here. There's a dude right here. A dude right here in this door.

13
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:11,819
Come here you. Come here you.

14
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:12,819
What?!

15
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:13,819
Oh, he...

16
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:14,819
Yeah!

17
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:16,819
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

18
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:21,430
Where they at? Where are they?

19
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,670
He's right here.

20
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,670
I'm scared!

21
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,670
Oh, get...

22
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,670
No! No!

23
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,670
Oh, that guy just scared the absolute crap out of me. He just like jumped in the air like...

24
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,670
And I missed. Ah, I should have aimed down sights.

25
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,670
Damn it!

26
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,379
Carrier. Location classified.

27
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:40,379
One in the Chamber.

28
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:41,379
Let's do it again.

29
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,200
Got my golden gun.

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,340
Four, three, two, one, go!

31
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,680
Who...

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,859
Who wants it? Who wants it? There's a guy right here.

33
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,989
It's this guy.

34
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:00,989
Oh!

35
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,489
What?! No!

36
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,489
There's a guy behind me!

37
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:05,500
What?!

38
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,930
What?!

39
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,930
Yeah!

40
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,620
Alright, gotta get my bearings here.

41
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,620
Get out of my face!

42
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,379
Excuse me, sir.

43
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,560
I'm gonna get you.

44
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
I got you!

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
I got you! I told you I was gonna get you!

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,819
Watch that UAV. Watch that UAV.

47
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,949
Behind me.

48
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:30,949
Yeah!

49
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:33,210
Oh, this guy.

50
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,210
You wanna play a knife fight?

51
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,210
You wanna play?

52
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,729
You wanna go for a knife?

53
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:38,729
No!

54
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,729
Oh, I saw that guy.

55
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,039
If I was a split second earlier.

56
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,039
It's alright.

57
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,039
That's only one death.

58
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,110
That's only one death.

59
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,110
I'm good.

60
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,729
It's so nerve-racking.

61
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:55,069
This guy up here.

62
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,240
Be careful.

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Don't make any noise.

64
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,479
What?

65
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,479
Oh!

66
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,479
Get it!

67
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,479
Where's he?

68
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,479
Come here.

69
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:06,979
He's right here.

70
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:11,900
Where's the son of a bitch?

71
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
Why is this guy?

72
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,389
Did he die?

73
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:15,389
Oh, now I really am scared.

74
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:17,210
No!

75
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,210
No!

76
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,210
No!

77
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,979
No!

78
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:22,979
No!

79
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:23,979
Freak out!

80
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:27,889
That guy got behind me.

81
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:28,889
Damn it!

82
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:29,889
Alright, I'm in like the...

83
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:31,889
I think I'm in like the leaderboard here.

84
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:33,889
If I can just stay alive.

85
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:36,580
Yeah, there's only one or two guys left.

86
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,580
Come on.

87
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,580
Let me pull this win out.

88
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,759
Where's this guy?

89
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,759
Where's this asshole?

90
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,379
Oh, there he is.

91
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:46,379
There he is.

92
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,379
He doesn't have a shot.

93
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,120
Can I end it right here?

94
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Oh!

95
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Can I end it right here?

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
That's a question.

97
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
That's a real question at hand.

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,599
He's coming around.

99
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,599
He's coming around.

100
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,599
Oh, no.

101
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,599
He's coming back.

102
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,419
He's coming back.

103
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,419
Oh, this is so scary.

104
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:05,069
No!

105
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:06,069
He missed.

106
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,069
Yeah!

107
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:08,500
Oh!

108
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Murder...

109
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,680
Oh, I forgot my name was Murder She Wrote.

110
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,680
If anybody knows what that is, Murder She Wrote was an old TV show in the 80s.

111
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,170
My grandmother used to watch it.

112
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,800
Oh, look at this knife right here.

113
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Look at this.

114
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Oh, side step!

115
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,350
Apparently, I knifed his back.

116
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,850
Or...

117
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,850
I don't even know what I just knifed.

118
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,540
That was weird.

119
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,540
All right.

120
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,540
One more.

121
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,350
One more run.

122
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,350
Let's do it.

123
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,350
One more time.

124
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,350
All right.

125
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,350
Let's do a repeat last time.

126
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,300
Let me get top frag like a boss.

127
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,300
Five.

128
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Four.

129
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,300
Three.

130
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,470
Two.

131
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,629
One.

132
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:49,540
Go.

133
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,540
Let's go up top.

134
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,800
Get in here.

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,360
Anybody?

136
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
Anybody?

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
Anybody?

138
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
What does that noise even mean?

139
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
That thing scares the...

140
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,980
What?

141
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
What?

142
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,980
That didn't make any sense at all.

143
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,480
I knifed that guy right in his teeth.

144
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,300
Oh, we got a guy coming up right here.

145
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,300
What?

146
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
No!

147
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,300
That's not fair.

148
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,300
It's not fair.

149
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,300
It's not fair.

150
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:23,319
I shot that guy in his wrist.

151
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,519
Boink!

152
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,019
I got him.

153
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,019
How did I get that guy?

154
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,019
Holy God.

155
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:30,019
I didn't even hit that guy.

156
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:33,019
I shot like 10 feet to that guy's right.

157
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:34,019
Behind me.

158
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:36,839
I'm on my last life here.

159
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,720
I've got to be real careful.

160
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,410
I can't screw around.

161
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,420
Up top this way.

162
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Watch that UAV.

163
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
There's a guy right here.

164
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,550
See ya.

165
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,889
Anybody else?

166
00:05:58,889 --> 00:05:59,889
Check that UAV.

167
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,980
Yo!

168
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,250
Oh, I air knifed him.

169
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,000
One guy over here as well.

170
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,310
Come here, you.

171
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,899
He doesn't know where I am.

172
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:22,139
What?

173
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,139
Ready?

174
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,149
Watch this.

175
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,149
Super knife!

176
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:27,149
Oh, it's all about the knife.

177
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:28,149
It's all about the knife.

178
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,149
Oh, I would've won it.

179
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,149
I would've won it right there.

180
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,149
Damn.

181
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:35,529
Oh well, well.

182
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,899
This mode is a lot of fun.

183
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,899
If you don't know how to do this if you have Black Ops 2, you go to party games.

184
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,899
And that was me that died right there, by the way.

185
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:46,899
You go to party games and it's one in the chamber.

186
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:47,899
So thank you guys so much for watching.

187
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:48,899
I really do appreciate it.

188
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,899
And I'll see you guys all soon.

189
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:52,899
And of course, take care everybody.
