1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,759
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some more...what the hell was that?

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,760
Some more Call of Duty Black Ops 2 party games. This one is actually called Sticks and Stones.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,940
Where you only get to use ballistic knives, knives, and the crossbow. This thing.

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:36,640
Oh, get stuck. This is on that boat map again. For a second I thought that was an actual plate.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,500
Get stuck. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Guy right here. Come here.

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:52,869
Just double tap him. Whoa. Whoa. Those things explode. Yikes.

7
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:58,299
I'm going up there. I'm coming up there, man. I'm going to give you a Christmas card that you're going to want to send back.

8
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:06,920
Iron explosion. Yeah, melee kill. Can I jump down there?

9
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,129
Oh, you also get the tomahawk too with a throwing knife. I'm going to throw this guy right in the back.

10
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:21,939
Or in the front. Or in his face. That works too. Pull this back out. This thing.

11
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:37,090
Oh, I don't know where to go. Shoot down. Let's just shoot down that hallway just to scare him.

12
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:43,159
Oh man. Did I get a double? Oh, I thought it went through the guy. Wow. Oh my.

13
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:50,659
Dude, my face. I just planted my face into the wall. That was ridiculous.

14
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:56,219
Holy crap. That was insanity. Get tomahawked. Nobody was even there.

15
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:06,700
There's a dude in there. He's sitting right here.

16
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:17,300
Screw this. No. That thing is terrifying. I'm just going to use the ballistic knives, man. These things are deadly.

17
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:24,539
Oh, come on. No, please don't kill me. No. Stab him. Reload.

18
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:40,039
What's this? Oh, you got smashed. I'm going to take this out.

19
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:45,710
I don't like that thing. That thing's... I'm not good with that thing.

20
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:51,550
Skewered. I don't have any more bullets with it though. Or ammo.

21
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:57,219
Oh, with the knives. Not this thing. Now I've got to use this thing. I don't even want to use this thing.

22
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:09,590
Got him. Oh, bang. Hello. Oh boy. Screw it. I got one of them.

23
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:18,300
At least I got my ballistics back. These things are where it's at. Oh, someone's going to get it.

24
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,139
I'm just going to throw it over the whole map and see what happens.

25
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:27,960
If I get a kill for that, that would be so hilarious.

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,710
Dammit. Whoa. Whoa. Easy. Easy, buddy. Easy. Easy.

27
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:40,620
What? That guy was running...

28
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,789
When does this end? How long are the rounds? These things are pretty damn long.

29
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:51,080
You're wrapping back around. Are you? Oh, get bankrupted.

30
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,979
This guy's got that explosive scary thing.

31
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:07,520
What on earth is happening right now? Oh, get blown up. Get blown up.

32
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,520
You son of a bitch. It was... people surrounded me.

33
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:18,579
Get tomahawked. I don't even know if I'm winning or not. Am I? Apparently I'm winning.

34
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:33,420
Geez. There's a lot of human beings over here. I would have had that kill too. Bastard.

35
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:42,529
Dammit. Should have paid more attention. Come on. Come on. Come on.

36
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:53,560
Oh, hit him with that. You're just going to get stabbed. What? What?

37
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:01,170
All right. That works too. Seven seconds. Six, five, four, three, two, one.

38
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:07,610
Oh, is that it? Hey, I won. Fruit snacks, baby. That was crazy.

39
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:13,620
That was absolutely crazy. But let's do one more. Let's do another one.

40
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:28,480
Let's get off this boat level. Connection interrupted. What the hell? Bang.

41
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,480
I have some delivery for you. Extra special package.

42
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,089
I don't want to run into these... I love these things, man. I don't want to run out of them.

43
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:48,569
Bankrupt. Bankrupt. I'll just run around with these damn things.

44
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:56,120
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. He's still behind me.

45
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:06,589
Holy crap. Just... Oh. What are these? Shoot me in the face?

46
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:12,990
What the hell was that? It's all good. Let's come out here and do it again.

47
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:26,519
I'm going to stab you in your face. You're going to get stabbed right in your face.

48
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:34,579
I'm going to stab. I'm going to stab. You're going to get freaking...

49
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:41,839
Where is this guy? Oh, he's over here. Get him.

50
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,589
No. No. Watch it. Please don't hurt me. Please don't kill me.

51
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:52,540
Geez Louise with a piece of cheese. Oh, that guy's alive. That guy's dead, I mean.

52
00:06:52,540 --> 00:07:00,660
Chaos. There's another guy. Did I get him? Oh my God. Run.

53
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,279
Oh, did I get... I didn't get anybody. Damn it.

54
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:14,879
At least I got the tomahawk. Wow. Somebody behind me trying to kill me.

55
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:23,459
How did that not work? Who did I just kill?

56
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:34,680
Apparently one of them got killed. Keep running. Keep moving. Keep moving.

57
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:43,040
Keep moving. What? No. No. What do we got? I'm winning?

58
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:57,610
I was winning. Skewered. I'm so scared.

59
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:05,480
Try using this thing again. At least for a minute or two or three or four.

60
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:12,660
Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me.

61
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,990
What? Some dude was just like up my ass. Maybe not. Where the hell was that guy?

62
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:30,939
That was weird. Sticks and stones. Sticks and stones.

63
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:38,820
Damn. Right here. This guy. Right here.

64
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,789
Ow. I'm losing. I gotta pull this together here. Come on.

65
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:56,000
Come on. Pull it together. You laggy son of a bitch. Come here.

66
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,299
Come on. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep it going. Keep it going.

67
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:11,129
Still losing. Still losing. But can I pull it through?

68
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:15,129
How in the name of Jehoshaphat did I not kill that guy?

69
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:21,590
I was sticking the knife in the back of his head. Nothing happened.

70
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:31,639
You know what? Screw it Tomahawk. Explosions. Anybody over here?

71
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:38,919
Yeah there is. Take down that guy. No idea where I am.

72
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,919
I'm like freaking Superman. It's tied. It's tied. I gotta pull ahead.

73
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:52,139
No. No. No. No. I gotta pull ahead. I only have a few seconds.

74
00:09:52,139 --> 00:10:02,659
No. I gotta get this guy. Gotta get him. What? What? What was that?

75
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:08,279
The guy just like... Really bro? You're gonna drop shot in sticks and stones?

76
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:18,490
Oh my god. I won. I actually won. Well there you go. Nice.

77
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,440
I didn't get the last kill though. But yeah that's gonna wrap it up I guess guys.

78
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,440
So thank you so much for watching. Really do appreciate it. Sticks and stones baby.

79
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,620
And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care everybody.
