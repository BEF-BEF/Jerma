1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,140
Mummy vs Kruger. Are you ready to get thrown into the flames of Kruger?

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:21,140
Do you even know a single button to this game? I don't want to do strategy games because people will expect some level of skill.

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,070
Just hold on a second. We need to make sure we...hold on. I gotta get my buttons in check.

4
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:37,420
So before we get started, we need to do a button check. So okay, button check. That's that. That's that. Okay. Button check. I'm just button checking.

5
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,420
I'm okay with this.

6
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:43,659
Alright, button check is still going on. Alright, my button check's good. Good, play.

7
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:47,820
You wanna mess with the Kruger?

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,820
You wanna mess with the Kruger?

9
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:56,759
You wanna mess with Freddy Kruger? You wanna mess with me? You ready to go?

10
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:04,689
I wasn't expecting this, to be honest with you.

11
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:13,420
It's cause Freddy Kruger is like broken. What the hell are you doing? You're like sucking out my soul.

12
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,599
You wanna play this game?

13
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:24,359
Oh, how do you do like the X-Factor? How do I like sing on UK television? The X-Factor.

14
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,359
I don't care.

15
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,030
No, no, no, no, no.

16
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,700
Fuck. Get crushed.

17
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,379
This game is brutal. Are you not gonna do anything?

18
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,700
I did it wrong. I did it wrong.

19
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,069
Dude, that was horrible. You just jumped up and like you broke my neck and then you shattered my spine.

20
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:02,659
You know who I honestly thought would have, Jerma would have picked immediately?

21
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:03,659
Who?

22
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,109
Look at his face.

23
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,110
But that's Baraka though. Baraka is like Baraka.

24
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,110
Barack Obama is like, we talk about him all the time.

25
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,110
I don't wanna play as Barack Obama. I wanna play as the God of War Kratos.

26
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,110
Okay.

27
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,479
Either God of War Kratos or like this beady-eyed motherfucker.

28
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,479
Because this is Mortal Kombat. This is the storyline.

29
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,479
Oh, actually no, I have seen this. This is where Stryker is, right?

30
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,479
Uh, Kill Cool, we were playing. We were like actually playing and not like looking at something.

31
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,129
Oh my fucking God.

32
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:38,069
Are you gonna seriously just combo the shit out of me while we're like looking at like stuff in the background?

33
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:40,889
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

34
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:42,889
Alright, if that's how it's gonna be.

35
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,889
Can you get it by the car?

36
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:47,639
There's stage specific fatalities.

37
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,639
Oh, cool.

38
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,969
If you flawless me right now, this control is going through the fucking wall.

39
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:56,969
Well, that's some motivation.

40
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:02,810
You seriously cannot flawless me right now. Do anything, desperation.

41
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,259
No.

42
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:06,259
Yes.

43
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:07,259
No.

44
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:10,259
Oh, with this. With this. I spam it in my own face.

45
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:12,259
It would just break your neck. Oh, yeah, sure. Okay.

46
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,819
Cyrax.

47
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,199
Oh, teleportation.

48
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,199
I'm a robot.

49
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,439
Where is Star? Star is going to be exterminated.

50
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,680
I am the robot character. Star will be exterminated.

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,069
Are you a Dalek?

52
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,819
Star will be exterminated.

53
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,449
Oh, it's water. It's water.

54
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,449
Get her off me.

55
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:42,580
It's water. Oh, God.

56
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,580
Oh, fuck.

57
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,620
That went on for way too long.

58
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,620
That went on for way too long.

59
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,659
Alright, what's the funny thing you wanted to show me?

60
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,659
The water is what I wanted to show you.

61
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,659
Oh, that was the funny thing? Oh, okay.

62
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:16,730
That's pretty funny.

63
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,730
If you kill me with the water, I...

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,730
Here comes the water.

65
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:35,149
Alright, here we go. John Cena versus the mummy again.

66
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,160
Here it comes. Here comes the paint.

67
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
You know, this is like a title of a pretty good movie.

68
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
John Cena versus the mummy.

69
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Coming soon to Disney DVD.

70
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
Yeah, coming soon.

71
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Wait, let me guess what Jerm is going to do. Is he going to jump and press buttons?

72
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Coming soon to Disney DVD.

73
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,040
John Cena versus the mummy.

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,459
Okay, now you're playing the character you know how to play.

75
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:01,459
That's cheating.

76
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:03,459
Oh, he has a gun?

77
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:05,759
Oh, it's okay. I'll just shoot you.

78
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,050
Oh, it's okay. I'll just shoot you.

79
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,050
I'll give you a chance to kind of do it again.

80
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,050
Oh, yeah? Oh, the flashlight!

81
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,050
You just shined a flashlight on me!

82
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,050
You just shined a flashlight on me!

83
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,060
Again?

84
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
Oh, man!

85
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,060
Haven't I had enough?

86
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,060
And now I shoot you.

87
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,879
That flashlight was sick.

88
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,879
I'm going to defeat the mortal human being.

89
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,050
Ooh!

90
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,250
Yeah.

91
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,250
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

92
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,250
He's going to combo the absolute hell out of me.

93
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,790
Ooh, surprise!

94
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,100
Yes! Yes!

95
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
I was blocking the bullets.

96
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
That doesn't make any sense.

97
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,810
Hey, did you know

98
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,810
that noob cyborgs

99
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,810
backwards is Boon Tobias,

100
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,810
the guy that made the game?

101
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,810
Isn't that good?

102
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,810
That's a good technological

103
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,810
information. Yeah.

104
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,240
Ow. What?

105
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,040
You noobed me.

106
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah. Right hook, left hook, left hook.

107
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Yeah. Turn it for the box and turn it.

108
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
This is the turn that I'm going to be practicing for.

109
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,040
Yeah. Get the fuck out of it.

110
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Fuck you, motherfucker. Get the fuck. Fuck you, motherfucker.

111
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:41,550
Yes! No!

112
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,550
God damn it! That was the whole plan the whole time

113
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,550
and it didn't even fucking work.

114
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:52,639
Yeah, yeah.

115
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,639
Go ahead and get fucking X-Facted.

116
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,639
What? I was hitting you. You have hit

117
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,639
damn. Ow.

118
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,639
Dude, some of these are so... This is a

119
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
1v1 game.

120
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,639
Oh, he's puking. He's puking.

121
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,639
Noob Subbot's my favorite character because he makes people puke.

122
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,639
Confirmed favorite character

123
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,199
in the game. Because people throw up

124
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,199
when they get kicked in the balls.

125
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:22,370
No, okay. This is tied up.

126
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,370
I'm going to stop messing around here and do some

127
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:36,189
moves. Whoa!

128
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,930
What? What's going on?

129
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,930
Okay, well the game decided you don't want to have a video.

130
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,500
What? No videos.

131
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
The game desynchronized?
