00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,130
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a fistful of frags gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:16,250
It's been a while since you've seen fistful of frags on this channel, and there's no real

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,980
reason in particular for that. Sometimes you put a game away and you come back to it months later.

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,699
Sometimes you put a game away for potentially years, which I did with TF2. I stopped playing

5
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:34,469
TF2 back in like 2008 for like 12 months. You take breaks, point is, you take breaks,

6
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,070
you come back to games, and you go, well, you know, I forgot about this game. This game's

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,390
fucking sick. Yeah, well, that's what happened. I'm playing Fistful of Frags again. Here's a new

8
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,829
map, I believe. It's one of the new maps that's currently in circulation. It's a train. This is

9
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:51,670
all about the trains in Fistful of Frags, apparently. A lot of these maps, the newer

10
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,310
ones seem to have trains on them, but that's regardless of the point. You probably saw the

11
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,740
title and you're wondering what the hell this title means. Were you writing a book now? You

12
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,579
wanted to make a game company first. Now you want to write a book and then what you would do. Next

13
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:08,219
thing I'm going to want to be like an astronaut. I'm going to be like, gosh, hey, you know what?

14
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:11,900
Today's video, we're going to talk about how I want to be a fucking astronaut. And I'm going

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,299
to go up in the airplane. We're going to go flying up into outer space and I'm going to meet some

16
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:21,739
Martians and I'm going to start a family up there on Mars. No, but this is something I'm actually

17
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:26,379
doing right now. I'm in the process of doing, I'm writing a book. Yes, I'm writing a book. I'm an

18
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:31,819
ebook. Let's make that really clear. This is not going to be a published book by anybody.

19
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:36,060
You're not going to see this on store shelves at Barnes and Noble. There's not going to be an image

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,299
of me on the cover in a three-piece suit with my arm resting on a desk, smiling a giant white toothy

21
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,379
smile. And it's saying like, how to manage your finances with German nine eight five. It's just,

22
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:54,700
it's going to be something I'm doing for fun. And it's a choose your own adventure book.

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,980
I got really inspired recently by playing that game sorcery. That was a choose your own adventure

24
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,219
book. I'm sure a lot of you guys remember me talking how into what I was and how cool it was,

25
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:09,900
how I wished more people would be porting over game books. And then Inkle, the company that made

26
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:15,020
that game sorcery. Oh, well, they ported that game sorcery over to iOS and Android and shit.

27
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,219
They came up with this engine. There is an engine that they came up with for you to write your own

28
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,810
choose your own adventure books. So I saw that and I said, holy shit, are you kidding me? This is

29
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,849
awesome. I got to give this a try. I've got to at least try to do this. And yes, I know that there

30
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,930
are other resources and other places where you can write, choose your own adventure novels and

31
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,689
stuff. But this, I just knew the company Inkle. I played all their games and it looked really easy

32
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:45,289
to use. There's a, the tutorial was very, very simple. And I just started, I started writing

33
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:51,930
and I already have like probably like at least a few hundred words written so far. I don't know

34
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:58,090
what the timeframe will be on this. I can't just be telling you, oh yeah, well guys in three months,

35
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,770
I'm going to be having 5,000 pages done. I don't know the length. I don't even know the subject

36
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:09,449
matter. All I know is it's going to be an absurd adventure where you can go branching in a million

37
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:14,650
different directions. I'm going to make all kinds of just strange references to things and I'm not

38
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,610
going to take it that seriously. So if you're expecting out of this whole Germans writing a

39
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,490
book thing that you're going to get like George RR Martin presents like a song of ice and fire.

40
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:31,210
No, this is going to be just me writing my thoughts down and having some crazy adventure game

41
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,180
that you can just go on and mess around with and have a couple of laughs at maybe.

42
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,060
With that being said though, I do want it to be a coherent experience. I don't want to just write

43
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:47,659
like a third grader just like once upon a time, the princess was rescued from the alligator.

44
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:54,150
No, it's going to be a coherent story and I'm pulling trigger on it. So in the somewhat near

45
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,389
future, you might get a glimpse into some type of adventure free ebook that I'm going to write

46
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:06,599
and talking about free, talking about charging money for it and stuff. I don't know. I don't

47
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:13,240
think so. The only reason why I would ever charge money for this thing is if I literally like legit

48
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:20,019
put like 5,000 hours into writing it and it was like a really big fleshed out whole thing and

49
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,540
we'll just see how that goes. I have no idea what I'm doing. I have no clue what's going on,

50
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,339
which is why this is not a get rich quick scheme for me. I'm not just going to say,

51
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:34,980
Hey, wow, you know, I could just write a shit book that nobody's going to like.

52
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:42,500
And I'll just put like a $30 price tag on it. It's just an experiment that I'm doing.

53
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,779
And that's all I really have to say. I just wanted to mention that that's something I'm

54
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,060
working on right now. On top of all the other things that I'm doing in my life,

55
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,699
it's just kind of a life update. What are you doing video? And that's going to wrap it up. So

56
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,860
thanks everybody so much for watching. Really appreciate it. And I want to close this out by

57
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,899
saying this, right? If you want to try something like, look, I don't think I'm a writer. I don't

58
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:06,740
think so at all. I'm not one of those people that like I didn't go to school for it. I didn't learn.

59
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,899
I don't, I'm not a good like writer. Who gives a shit, right? Just, just try it. Just do it.

60
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:16,540
Even if you look at something and you go, you know, I can't do it. I would suck at that.

61
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,980
Try it. Just see, see if you do. Cause guess what? You might do it and go, holy shit, I'm the next

62
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,620
Edgar Allan Poe. And it would have said wandering weak and weary as a carpeting on my own

63
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,990
rainbow chamber door. You could be like really good at it is what I'm saying. And you never know.

64
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,990
Just try it. Even if it's anything, whatever it is, I would say, just go for it. You know me,

65
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,120
just fucking go for it and just bang. You know what I'm saying? Boom. And with that,

66
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,240
that's going to wrap it up. I'll see you all next time. Thank you all so much for watching.

67
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,279
I really do appreciate it and goodbye everybody. Take care and have a wonderful evening. Have a

68
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,639
wonderful night. Have a wonderful morning when you wake up. I hope you get a delicious breakfast.
