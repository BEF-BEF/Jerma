1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,949
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Super Meat Boy.

2
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,629
Gonna be playing on Chapter 4 tonight, Hell.

3
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,800
Which is scary.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,800
I don't want to go to Hell. Nobody wants to go to Hell. Why do we have to go to Hell?

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,239
I am just gonna skip this cutscene. Just kidding.

6
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:34,670
Let's see what happens here. Meat Boy and Dr. Fetus are running at each other with crazy anime backgrounds all over the place.

7
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:40,710
Oh, a clash of the titans indeed.

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,450
Meat Boy is down. He's gonna get thrown. Oh no, Meat Boy is down for the count.

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,880
Oh, he's dead.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,380
I don't think that's actually true. I think he's alive and well in Hell.

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,380
That was a rhyme. Don't know why I'm rhyming. I'm kind of crazy right now. I'm drinking a bunch of coffee.

12
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:04,640
So let's just go. Chapter 1. Well, yeah, Chapter 4, Episode 1. I don't even know what you'd call this, but let's just go. Boom!

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,379
Now, this is notoriously hard, Chapter... That's not where I'm supposed to go.

14
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:12,560
Chapter 4 is very difficult, so I'm hoping... Oh God.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,560
I'm hoping I can just smoke through a lot of this.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,120
But you know, Super Meat Boy, it is not an easy game.

17
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,819
Just by the skin of my teeth.

18
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:32,760
Just by the skin of my teeth, I'm gonna jump, jump, jump, jump.

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,900
Gotta be careful, gotta be careful.

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,400
I tried to jump off of it.

21
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,420
What the hell?

22
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,420
I didn't want to grab onto the damn edge there.

23
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,420
What just killed me?

24
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,170
I sandwiched myself against that wall.

25
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,760
That's fine.

26
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,450
Just barely. Holy crap.

27
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,140
Oh my God, my life.

28
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,269
This is where it's gonna get really hard.

29
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:11,750
This might be a freaking 50 minute episode.

30
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,590
I hope not. My sanity will be lost by then.

31
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,469
Just go!

32
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:22,349
Wait for it, wait for it.

33
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:30,469
It's right here! Oh, he took me!

34
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:33,539
I wanted my bacon.

35
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:40,969
Oh, I'm good here.

36
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:42,210
Maybe not.

37
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,319
The worst part...

38
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,120
The worst part about hell is the fact that a lot of these levels take patience.

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,120
You can't just speed through them, because sometimes you have to wait for stuff like these fireballs of doom.

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,490
And of course, these things.

41
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:10,110
Sweet.

42
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,110
But I'm not a patient guy, as I'm sure a lot of you are aware of by now.

43
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,110
Oh, hi!

44
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,990
A lot of you guys are probably aware of that.

45
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,990
That I am not a patient one.

46
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,810
I need to just go, and if I lose, I lose.

47
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,620
Alright, gotta be smart here.

48
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,620
Jump at the same time.

49
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,050
Hello, Suzy.

50
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,210
Leviathan.

51
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,449
I could have guessed that was gonna happen.

52
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:38,879
Wait for it.

53
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,889
Go!

54
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,389
Oh, I just overjumped it.

55
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,060
I overshot that by a lot.

56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,139
Go! Just go!

57
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,409
Do I dare get this damn bandaid?

58
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:55,900
No, there's no way I'll get it.

59
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
I'm going for it anyways.

60
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Stupid! No, stupid!

61
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,580
Go, get it. I'm gonna get it.

62
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,439
Get it!

63
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,439
Don't get it! Just forget it, go!

64
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,740
Oh, god damn it!

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,589
Jeez Louise.

66
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,089
It's so addicting to try and get these things.

67
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,769
I got it!

68
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,079
Just go!

69
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,290
I'm gonna get it. I have to get it.

70
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,240
I refuse to not get this bandaid.

71
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Oh my dear god!

72
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,240
I'm going to shoot myself with a BB gun in my bum.

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,110
That's not very pleasant.

74
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,939
Time to end the level.

75
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,439
I'm getting to that point where the heat's turning up in my brain.

76
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,040
I'm gonna start to scream.

77
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Just go. I'm not gonna do this anymore.

78
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,980
Let's just end the damn thing.

79
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,670
Rickets.

80
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,980
Oh, this place really, really sucks.

81
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:04,040
No!

82
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,290
You have to go like this.

83
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,550
Like that.

84
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,389
No!

85
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,199
Come on.

86
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,860
I don't got all day here.

87
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,860
Here we are.

88
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,600
Slide down.

89
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,600
I almost just jumped over her.

90
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,100
How did I get an A plus right there?

91
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,379
That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

92
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:31,379
Just move it.

93
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,379
And shake it.

94
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:33,379
And move it.

95
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:34,379
And move it.

96
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:35,379
And...

97
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,980
Not cool, Meat Boy.

98
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
Not cool.

99
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,980
I thought that was gonna move up higher.

100
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,480
Jump.

101
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Wait.

102
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,699
I'm gonna burp in Meat Boy's face right now.

103
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,730
Crap.

104
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,730
Slow down. Slow down here.

105
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,730
What do these things do?

106
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,000
Just go.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,500
Speed. It's all about the speed.

108
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
It's all about moving as fast as you freaking can.

109
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,189
What am I doing wrong here?

110
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:18,379
I need to get out there quick.

111
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:23,949
How am I supposed to...

112
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,449
I think you have to go like that.

113
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:26,949
Yeah, okay. I get it. I get it.

114
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,509
I'm just being a real stupid idiot.

115
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:34,370
No. No! No! No!

116
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,709
I'm gonna scream.

117
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:39,209
I'm going to scream.

118
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:42,740
I didn't do it fast enough.

119
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,300
Oh my god.

120
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,800
Can't wait to watch this one back.

121
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Holy crap.

122
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,009
There we go.

123
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:54,120
Get. Me. Out of here.

124
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
No!

125
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:04,060
This is where the tears start flowing.

126
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,220
Oh my god. I'm going to throw up.

127
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,209
This is gonna be the one right here.

128
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:12,209
I'm just gonna go over it.

129
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:12,709
Wait.

130
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:13,209
Jump.

131
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:13,709
Wait.

132
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:14,709
Jump.

133
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:15,709
Jump over it.

134
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,709
And then, get over here!

135
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,660
Okay, let's watch this.

136
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,660
Everybody...

137
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,339
Oh my god. Look at that centipede of Meat Boys.

138
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:26,339
I want to...

139
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:27,339
Yeah.

140
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:30,339
40 to 50% all died on that first little thing.

141
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:34,300
Well, that's one way to do it.

142
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Let's continue here.

143
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,439
The Deceiver.

144
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,439
Oh, that's right.

145
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,439
You have to just jump through like this.

146
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,939
And then, go like that.

147
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:44,620
And then, go like that.

148
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,779
Oh, that wall just screwed me over.

149
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:50,779
Can I get that bandaid?

150
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,779
If you have to fall into it like that.

151
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,779
If I remember correctly, what should I do?

152
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,339
I got it.

153
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:59,180
Let's go.

154
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,180
Just be safe here.

155
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,180
Don't do anything crazy.

156
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,680
You need that bandaid.

157
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,110
And this one is like this.

158
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,610
Get the key.

159
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,110
Get the key.

160
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,939
Gotta fall down.

161
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:18,899
Patience is a virtue.

162
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,829
I hate this part.

163
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:22,009
Whoa.

164
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:23,250
Wow.

165
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,250
Oh, wow.

166
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,000
Christopher Walken.

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's who I...

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,259
It's Alan...

169
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,759
Too busy doing like a bad Christopher Walken impression to play this game.

170
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,269
No, just fall down it.

171
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:36,509
Yeah.

172
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:40,889
Butt head.

173
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,889
I was too busy doing a bad Christopher Walken.

174
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,389
Okay, enough Christopher Walken.

175
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:48,279
Let's just play the damn game.

176
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,279
Oh, goodness me.

177
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,070
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

178
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,000
Be patient.

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:09,500
I hate being patient.

180
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
I did that with my mouth.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,139
Don't worry.

182
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,139
Don't worry.

183
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:16,720
Oh, my.

184
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,220
This is just going to get even worse.

185
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,480
I don't even know what's going to happen in the later levels.

186
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I think we might actually see some germapuke.

187
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,110
Do it on this one, then go.

188
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,480
Now, don't hit your head on the damn ceiling.

189
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:42,570
Oh, my God.

190
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,570
Just do it.

191
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,570
Just do it.

192
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,500
Smell that?

193
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,740
It's called being really mad at this game.

194
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,320
I'm not really that mad, to be honest with you.

195
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,139
It's kind of fun dying in this game.

196
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:04,139
Only because you know you're going to be able to just do it again.

197
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,139
This time, I just undershot it that time.

198
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:12,240
I undershot it that time.

199
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Will you just jump down there, you son of a beast sting?

200
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,480
The sting is going to be so strong when I sting you in your face.

201
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,950
Jump, jump, jump.

202
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,950
Now, get over here.

203
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,320
If I don't do it this time, I'm going to swallow my freaking mouse.

204
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,620
All right, here we go.

205
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,620
I got it.

206
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,649
It's down.

207
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:44,649
I don't know why I'm having such trouble with this one.

208
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,019
This one's not even that difficult.

209
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,019
You just have to jump into the damn hole.

210
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,379
Just jump into the damn hole.

211
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,379
Why is it so hard for me right now?

212
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:54,690
Why?

213
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,889
Why?

214
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,889
Thank you.

215
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:03,460
Let's see this.

216
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,179
I was going to say, did nobody get the key?

217
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:10,610
I wonder how many people die at this little ball.

218
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,330
At least one or two.

219
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,330
Please, we have to make it to the end.

220
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,620
Oh, no, no, please.

221
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,009
Goodness gracious.

222
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:25,009
What level are we on?

223
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,440
Eleven?

224
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
We're not even halfway there.

225
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,509
Oh, okay.

226
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:36,210
Oh, got to be quicker than that.

227
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,789
Up, up.

228
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:42,929
Now, I got to fall in the...

229
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:47,470
Quicker be quicker.

230
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,470
Just jump in.

231
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,649
Oh, my God.

232
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:54,419
Oh, my God.

233
00:11:54,419 --> 00:12:01,730
Up, just like the movie, up.

234
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,970
This is what happens when I don't play this game for years, and then I try to...

235
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,139
I'm going to throw my controller against the wall.

236
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,690
It's going to smash.

237
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,360
How am I still missing this?

238
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,919
I'm going to smash my controller against the wall.

239
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,919
It's going to break into a...

240
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:33,580
Oh, God, I think you have to go like that.

241
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,799
Oh, it's getting harder.

242
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,509
I'll get out of here.

243
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:45,120
Oh, give me the key.

244
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,450
Do the same thing.

245
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,450
This time, go the other way.

246
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:57,379
Oh, my God.

247
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,639
Don't want to...

248
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,639
I remember this part.

249
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,070
You don't want to touch all these things because you have to do it again.

250
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,779
Oh, no, I forgot to get the key on this.

251
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:10,779
I'm not going to do it this run.

252
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:11,779
There's no way.

253
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:14,179
That's good to know.

254
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:15,179
You have to jump.

255
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,179
There you go.

256
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:17,179
There it is.

257
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:19,179
Now, just grab the key right when it falls.

258
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:20,179
Get it.

259
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,179
No, that was a trick I used to do, and I never got...

260
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:23,179
I can't get it.

261
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:27,870
Goodness.

262
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,870
Goodness me.

263
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,000
Up, up, and away we go.

264
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay, now what?

265
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm just going to wait.

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,820
Now go.

267
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,820
You know what?

268
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,990
Just kill me.

269
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,000
Just freaking kill me.

270
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,779
Go.

271
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:48,779
That one, that one.

272
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:49,779
I hit the ceiling again.

273
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,779
How many times am I going to hit the ceiling?

274
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:55,820
Way too many times I've hit that ceiling.

275
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,570
There it is.

276
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,570
Get me out of this level.

277
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,129
Easy.

278
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:03,129
Easy.

279
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:07,250
Just get in there.

280
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,250
All right.

281
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,190
I'm going to play with command video here.

282
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,190
I remember command video did this quite well.

283
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,710
Up and around.

284
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,710
Oh, come on.

285
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,710
The jump didn't register that time.

286
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,980
Are you out of your freaking mind, dude?

287
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
Up away.

288
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,980
Oh, patience.

289
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,860
Just stand here.

290
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,289
Just wait.

291
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:31,340
Just be, be the meat boy.

292
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,580
Be the meat boy.

293
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
There it is.

294
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,580
Be the meat boy.

295
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,149
Here we go.

296
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:40,570
Be the meat boy.

297
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,570
Yeah.

298
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,370
Oh.

299
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,759
Be the meat boy.

300
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,759
Round and round.

301
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,759
Wow.

302
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,759
That was very risky.

303
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,759
I should not have done that.

304
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,220
That was not a good move.

305
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,460
Get up here.

306
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,460
Oh my.

307
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,809
Let's go, boy.

308
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:00,809
Let's go, boy.

309
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:03,710
There's my boy.

310
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,779
That's my boy right there.

311
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,779
Come here to video.

312
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:07,779
Maybe not.

313
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:10,049
He's a little too slow.

314
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:11,049
Come here to video.

315
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:14,659
Command.

316
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:15,659
This is what.

317
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:17,980
Go back to meat boy.

318
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,759
The noises are getting a lot stronger.

319
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,960
I can feel my blood boiling right now.

320
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,649
Oh.

321
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:25,649
Oh, no.

322
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,139
I will get it this time.

323
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:30,750
I just got it.

324
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,750
I just got it.

325
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,750
I just got it.

326
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,940
I just got it.

327
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
I just got it.

328
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,940
I just got it.

329
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,059
I just got it.

330
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:44,059
I just got it.

331
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:45,360
I just got it.

332
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
I just got it.

333
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,539
I will get it this time.

334
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:56,009
I just got to get this part correct.

335
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:59,009
Need to stay up there for a split second longer than I already am.

336
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:00,759
Why?

337
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,129
Why did that not work?

338
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,940
Why?

339
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,940
In all that is sacred.

340
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,940
Why?

341
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,840
Make your way up.

342
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,240
Oh, I'm definitely doing something wrong, and I just don't know what I'm doing wrong

343
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,179
right now.

344
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,730
Maybe I should just make a run for it up there.

345
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,350
Pull this thing back, I think, maybe?

346
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,360
Like this?

347
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Like that?

348
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Okay.

349
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,370
Exactly.

350
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,370
All right.

351
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,370
Figured it out.

352
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,950
Figured it out.

353
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,179
Now it's just a question of getting over that.

354
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:42,179
Whew.

355
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:44,379
How many lives is that?

356
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,340
Half of them died.

357
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,580
I want to see this.

358
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,779
I want to see how many of them actually perished up here on this turn here.

359
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,090
Here we go, guys.

360
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,840
Wee.

361
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
I'm going here.

362
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Go.

363
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:08,119
Oh, is this thing the thing that shoots the stuff all over the place?

364
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,450
This needs to fire me.

365
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,450
Come on.

366
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:16,569
Hello.

367
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,579
Wow.

368
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,900
Wow.

369
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,279
I've got to stay up there a little longer.

370
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,950
Maybe not.

371
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,950
Yep.

372
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,950
That's how you do it.

373
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,950
What?

374
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,660
What?

375
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
What?

376
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,539
What?

377
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:37,539
What?

378
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:40,700
What?

379
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
What?

380
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,539
What?

381
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:45,539
What?

382
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:46,539
What?

383
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:47,539
What?

384
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,539
Oh, my God.

385
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,170
I hate this part.

386
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,519
I hate this.

387
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,519
Why?

388
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,400
Why?

389
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,789
Why are you doing this to me?

390
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:59,789
Okay.

391
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:00,789
Obviously.

392
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,670
Obviously, I need to jump first.

393
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,299
No, that's not what's the matter.

394
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:05,299
Yes.

395
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:09,079
No, it wasn't.

396
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,079
Oh, no, it wasn't.

397
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,920
God, I can't handle this.

398
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,920
I can't handle this.

399
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,950
I think I maybe have to stand still over here.

400
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:26,880
No, that just gets me killed again.

401
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,400
I think initially you got to do it.

402
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Then you got to run.

403
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,900
Yeah.

404
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Oh, dear.

405
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,900
Oh, my God.

406
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,900
I got through it, and it didn't even matter.

407
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:43,089
Wait for him.

408
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,089
Silent.

409
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,089
Silent anger.

410
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:47,539
All right.

411
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:48,779
Just wait.

412
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:56,460
This is not cool.

413
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,460
Get me out of here, please.

414
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,410
A plus, apparently.

415
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,410
After all that.

416
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:10,880
Oh, up here.

417
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,180
Easy.

418
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,180
Easy.

419
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,829
Easy, breezy, beautiful cover girl.

420
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,579
I know that commercial.

421
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:22,269
I've seen that commercial before.

422
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:27,779
I'm just trying to not psych myself out.

423
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:28,779
There we are.

424
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:30,529
Good.

425
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:31,529
Getting close here.

426
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:34,599
I think there's only one or two more that I'm at the boss.

427
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,599
Please don't kill me.

428
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,599
Oh.

429
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,029
Oh, God.

430
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:39,339
He's relentless.

431
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:40,339
Please.

432
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:43,279
What?

433
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,279
I was out of range.

434
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:46,279
Oh, these things don't have range.

435
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,900
Oh, I was about to just say a very bad word right there, but I didn't.

436
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,190
Get away from me.

437
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,430
Here he comes.

438
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,430
Of course it's going to go in that spot.

439
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,430
Right where I'm landing.

440
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,430
Of course it is.

441
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,890
You hungry, hungry hippo.

442
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,279
You know, I was just standing there just blanking out.

443
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,710
I was just standing still saying to myself, I just stand here.

444
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,710
This is all right.

445
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,710
I'm safe.

446
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:22,049
The torture is almost over.

447
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,609
I'm almost through hell.

448
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:27,299
And then I have what's left?

449
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:28,299
Rapture?

450
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:29,299
Whatever it's called.

451
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,859
Okay, don't make that same mistake.

452
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:40,859
It's so much trouble to get through that.

453
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:42,609
Phew.

454
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,829
The hive.

455
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,900
Get me.

456
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,900
I have to wait till this is down.

457
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,079
Oh, it was down.

458
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,079
Almost down.

459
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:57,109
Why am I going through there?

460
00:20:57,109 --> 00:21:00,720
Just wait till he jumps and then wait till he does it again.

461
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Go.

462
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,730
Oh my God.

463
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,990
I just almost choked.

464
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,420
That's how much I'm raging right now.

465
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:18,789
Gotta be quiet.

466
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:19,789
That's the only way I can do this.

467
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:23,609
As if I'm just...

468
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:28,599
Stand still and jump over.

469
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,599
It's such an easy pattern.

470
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:35,380
Why can I not get it down?

471
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,549
My blood is just on fire right now.

472
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:41,240
I could just...

473
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
I'm going to...

474
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
I can't even think of words right now.

475
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
I'm so mad.

476
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,700
Just do it again.

477
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Do it again.

478
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,200
Now go.

479
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Just nice and easy.

480
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,660
This is it.

481
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,829
And then we're at the...

482
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:59,420
We're at the boss after this.

483
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,420
I remember this level.

484
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,420
This level is so terrible.

485
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,490
You have to...

486
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:11,529
This level is so long.

487
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:18,259
It requires so much patience, which I don't have.

488
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:33,180
Why did I try and get the bandaid?

489
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,809
I thought that was a key.

490
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:38,809
My puny brain thought that was a key.

491
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:43,069
I can't believe I did that.

492
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:48,059
Gotta stay confident here.

493
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,619
It's the last level.

494
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,000
I can't let this beat me.

495
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Gotta push forward.

496
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,259
Can't let it beat me.

497
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,259
Come on.

498
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:01,000
Let's go.

499
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And go.

500
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
One, two, tie my shoe.

501
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Three, four.

502
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,140
What?

503
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,210
I wasn't even sticking out.

504
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,880
I could be mad right now, but that was just stupid.

505
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,309
I was barely sticking out right there.

506
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:20,319
Even Meat Boy is mad.

507
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,319
Look at him.

508
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,319
I'm so mad right now.

509
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:29,490
What?

510
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,180
What the hell is going on?

511
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:38,240
Just go.

512
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Just get her.

513
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,990
This is it.

514
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,680
Time to play.

515
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,940
I have no idea how long this is going to take me.

516
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,569
Let's see, though.

517
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:52,829
What was that?

518
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:54,460
What the hell is going on?

519
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,460
What are these bodies doing falling down?

520
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,950
Dude, are you dead?

521
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,130
Weep, weep.

522
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,130
Dude, you gotta get up, man.

523
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,130
What the hell?

524
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,430
Okay, that plus Spike equals death.

525
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,430
Help me, please.

526
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,670
He's got me.

527
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,670
You'll never get away.

528
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,670
There's lava here, stupid.

529
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,670
Man, he's right.

530
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,670
There's lava.

531
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,670
Oh, look.

532
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,670
What the hell is that?

533
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,670
Oh, my goodness.

534
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,039
Okay, this is getting old.

535
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,039
Oh, he's mad.

536
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,660
I remember this part.

537
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
I remember what happens here.

538
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,660
This is really hard.

539
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,799
And he...

540
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,799
Oh, I remember this.

541
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,799
This is going to take forever.

542
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,799
This is going to take a million years.

543
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,799
Oh, guys.

544
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:30,799
I need to like...

545
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,740
Oh, no.

546
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,740
I'm so scared right now because he does this punch move.

547
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
Oh, no.

548
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
Here it is.

549
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,740
Jump.

550
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,240
He does it again.

551
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
This is all about patterns here.

552
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,819
And he has to do that three times.

553
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:49,740
So then he punches once, twice, and then in the middle.

554
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,960
So, go for it.

555
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,759
One, two, middle.

556
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:08,720
One, two, three, two.

557
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,140
one two middle yep okay now what is he gonna do he's gonna punch the side and

558
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:25,390
he's gonna come over this way yeah he's gonna do it again no he doesn't jump no

559
