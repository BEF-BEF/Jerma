1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:17,379
Hey, what's going on everybody? It's Dr. Jermick here, at my desk using my mouse and my keyboard going to put some patient files into the directory.

2
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:25,870
Let's see here. Anyways, I'm a doctor now. As you know, I have my doctorate in surgery.

3
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, let me just get this telephone here for a second. Hello? I don't care. I'm a goddamn doctor now. Get this phone off the desk.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,619
Oh, everything must go.

5
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:47,570
We are going to do an ambulance mission. Now what this is, you will see very shortly.

6
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:55,869
In addition to the original game, you can do stuff in ambulances, and I've never done it before, and it's incredibly difficult and crazy.

7
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:59,869
So here we go. Gonna do the transplant, heart transplant, in the ambulance. Here we go, baby.

8
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:09,650
Get this off. Thank you. So far so good. How am I gonna do this here?

9
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,590
I should probably...

10
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,280
Hey, like, watch the potholes, asshole guy driving the car.

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,219
Okay, the back of the door just opened. Are you serious?

12
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:29,989
Come on. What are we doing? Are we on like a roller coaster right now or a road?

13
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,989
No, I'm gonna lose my tools. Hold on. Where's the...

14
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:34,989
Wait, there it is.

15
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:37,989
Come here. Come here.

16
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:39,989
Come here.

17
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:40,989
Pick it up.

18
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:42,989
Okay, here we go.

19
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:45,739
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

20
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:49,969
Get me into that rib cage.

21
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:53,969
Hey, can you, like, stop at a Taco Bell while you're at it? I'm, like, kind of hungry.

22
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,530
Jesus Christ.

23
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,980
I'm gonna kill this guy.

24
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,420
I'm legitimately going to kill this guy.

25
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,419
I almost got the rib cage done.

26
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,099
Get this out of here.

27
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,620
Get this glass tube off the guy. Come on.

28
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,620
Hold on, I gotta... I gotta start to move some of this stuff.

29
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,620
Do not lose this. Put it down right there.

30
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,439
Here, we'll, like, throw this at an oncoming car.

31
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,810
Well, the doors don't even open anymore.

32
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,560
Okay, good, good, good. So far, so good.

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,060
No, no, no, no, no, no.

34
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,379
No, no. I still need to open this.

35
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,460
Come here.

36
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,460
And everyone thinks I'm on drugs.

37
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,460
The whole point of this game is... Oh, great, there's a saw in his body.

38
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,460
The whole point of this game is you're supposed to be, like, a guy on drugs.

39
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,460
Like, that's the joke.

40
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,460
Where's the guy driving the car? How many beers did this guy have?

41
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,409
Come on.

42
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:02,409
No, I'm gonna lose this guy already.

43
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:06,680
Here we go, here we go. That's what I want.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,860
That's what I want.

45
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,860
Just shut up for a second, car.

46
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,860
Get that toaster out of the way.

47
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,610
Where's the heart?

48
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,099
Where's his heart?

49
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,099
Where's the heart that I was supposed to transplant?

50
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,539
Did it go out the back door?

51
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:25,479
Oh, it's already over.

52
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,039
He's losing a lot of blood. It's necessary, though.

53
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,039
It's completely necessary.

54
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,569
No, hold on to it still.

55
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:36,569
Don't I have... Where's my syringe?

56
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:38,569
I need to, like, feed this guy drugs so he doesn't die.

57
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,830
Almost, almost.

58
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,830
No, come on.

59
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,819
All right, where's the syringe?

60
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,770
There it is, there it is. Come here.

61
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,009
Come here. Come on, stick him in his face.

62
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:55,960
Yes. Yes.

63
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,259
We're good. We are good.

64
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:00,259
Just need to cool it here.

65
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:02,569
Don't want to lose the hearts right here.

66
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:04,569
Oh, no. God, that heart's gonna fly out the back.

67
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:06,569
Protect the heart. Protect the heart for the time being.

68
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:08,740
Okay, the doors are closed.

69
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,560
God damn.

70
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,340
Get out of the way.

71
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,339
I still gotta get those two pieces of ribs out of there.

72
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,540
I gotta get those, like, riblets from chilies out of there.

73
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,800
All right, so far so good.

74
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
So far so good. So far so good.

75
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,420
No, I need to cut those. I still need to cut those.

76
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,420
No, don't put that...

77
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,420
No, come here.

78
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,180
This thing's gotta go.

79
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,120
This is gonna fly into his face and kill him.

80
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,180
Come over here. Where's the scalpel?

81
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,610
I just need a scalpel.

82
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,490
Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha.

83
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,490
No.

84
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,490
No.

85
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,370
No, I just got hit with the drugs.

86
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,370
This is gonna be ten times more difficult now

87
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,540
because I am on, like,

88
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,540
whatever the hell it is, morphine.

89
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,449
No, dude.

90
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,449
Are you serious? I was so close.

91
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,389
I don't even know what I'm cutting into right now.

92
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,360
Hopefully his heart.

93
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
This is gonna make me die.

94
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,560
I'm gonna throw up looking at this.

95
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Is the heart free? I can't even see.

96
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Is the heart free? I have no idea.

97
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,379
Let's see if I can pull it out.

98
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:30,300
Nope. Easy.

99
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,300
I just gotta cut into the...

100
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,300
This is gonna be really bad, guys.

101
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,730
Where is a scalpel?

102
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,160
Can I please find a scalpel

103
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,939
in this mess of an ambulance?

104
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:45,370
I got a tool.

105
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,629
Got a tool. Here we go.

106
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:52,470
Slice these ventricles. Slice these ventricles.

107
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,470
No.

108
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,779
I gotta cut one more. Cut one more.

109
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:01,339
Get out of the way!

110
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:05,560
No!

111
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,180
Good, good. Open that up. Throw all these up.

112
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,180
Out. Out. Out with you.

113
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,639
Out with you. Out with you. Out with you. Out with you.

114
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,310
I don't think I have enough blood.

115
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,310
He's gonna lose too much blood right here when I try to cut him.

116
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:28,420
There it is.

117
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,050
One more precise cut. Right there.

118
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,829
Right there. Right there.

119
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:41,139
Cut it! Now we just need to cut the ventricles.

120
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,149
I'm, like, leaning into the

121
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,149
computer right now, guys. This is, like, so intense.

122
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:51,019
There's one. Right? No?

123
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:57,139
Give me that cut.

124
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:00,069
Give me that cut. There it is.

125
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:03,209
I gotta get this last one. I got it.

126
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:05,209
Got it. Got it. Wait, no, did I?

127
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,579
There's one more. That red one.

128
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:10,389
Holy jeez! Where's the heart?

129
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,459
Where's this other heart? Come here!

130
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:16,019
Oh, pop it in the air.

131
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,019
No! No!

132
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:20,019
No, get in! Get in his

133
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,019
chest. Get in there.

134
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:25,980
Get in. Yes!

135
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,149
Wow, that was ridiculous.

136
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:30,149
That was intense. I can't even imagine doing, like, the brain

137
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,149
surgery. There's brain surgery, there's

138
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,149
kidney transplants, and heart transplants.

139
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:36,149
I have no idea how the hell you'd be

140
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:38,519
able to do that with a brain transplant one.

141
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,519
But anyways, guys, that's Surgeon Simulator 2013!

142
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,519
And, uh, it's on Steam right now.

143
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,759
I believe it is ten

144
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,759
bucks? I could be wrong. I believe it's ten dollars

145
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,759
on Steam. And I'll see you guys all next time.

146
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,759
Thank you so much for watching. Take care,

147
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,759
everybody.
