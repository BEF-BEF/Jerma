1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,660
Your mission is to find L. Ushin's hideout and eliminate him and his entire drug cartel.

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:21,399
You do this as this guy.

3
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:25,050
This guy doesn't see me?

4
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,480
As long as you stay hidden in the bushes, enemies will not be able to see you.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,229
Oh look. What the fuck dude? Are you kidding me right now?

6
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:39,630
There's gonna be some guy that's gonna walk over here.

7
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,630
Yeah, oh look, oh I wonder why I can't believe that.

8
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,630
Where's, oh there's somebody in that bush I think.

9
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,630
Oh no, I'll just take my 2D gun and go yeah.

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,640
Whoa whoa whoa, press enter at the right place to, oh I have to blow the bridge up.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,890
Okay, this looks like, hmm.

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,890
I wonder where the right place is.

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,890
It's not a giant blue arrow.

14
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,819
Make sure you find the right place, indicated by the gi-

15
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:18,189
What? Did that seriously blow me up?

16
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:22,620
It was a cutscene! That was just a cutscene!

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,620
Three, two, one, boom!

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,099
What was that?

19
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:32,099
What was just on the side of the screen?

20
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:35,659
What was that giant clay brick that just came over?

21
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:38,659
What the fuck was that?

22
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:44,420
Why would they have an explosion animation if you were just gonna take it out with a slab of clay?

23
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:53,140
Why is this a lumberyard? Why are we at a lumberyard?

24
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,780
Dude, dude.

25
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,780
No dude, like, you've got to be kidding me right now.

26
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,170
You've shot down dozens of gang members, but you still aren't a single step closer to their leader.

27
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,560
To make him come after you in person, try to make things more personal.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,379
That's a pretty nice car, dude.

29
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,379
This is his recently imported from France super sports car.

30
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,259
Trash it with your baseball bat before he returns.

31
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:29,259
Excuse me, but are you making this up right now, or am I hearing you correctly?

32
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,259
No, this is, I'm not making this up.

33
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:35,419
Attack it.

34
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,419
Yeah, you show him.

35
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:41,419
You show him what it's like to be a gang member.

36
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:50,449
Mission failed? I fucking trashed the thing.

37
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:53,449
Dude, I trashed the car.

38
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:56,449
Oh, you better hurry up and do it.

39
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:00,449
How much more damage do you want me to do to this car?

40
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:05,449
The car was like in a fucking junkyard by the time I was done with it.

41
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:07,449
If I fail the mission right now...

42
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,449
What is this?

43
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:12,689
What happened to the enemies?

44
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:14,689
What's going on?

45
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:16,689
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy.

46
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:19,310
Oh, it's an armored car.

47
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,379
Well, you didn't really take the right correct route to come get me.

48
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,939
You actually just drove into a tree.

49
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:32,759
Jesus, dude!

50
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:44,150
So what happens when these all get actually exploded?

51
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,710
What happens?

52
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,710
Oh, there's another one. Look out. Beep, beep, beep, beep.

53
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,710
I'm an animal.

54
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:54,229
The cars in this game are animals and they just drive into walls.

55
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:55,229
All right, I did it.

56
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:56,229
What's next?

57
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:58,050
What's next, huh?

58
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,050
What do you got for me?

59
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,860
What do you got for me?

60
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,860
I hear you.

61
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,860
I hear you.

62
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,860
Where are you?

63
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:18,939
First car. Where's the first car?

64
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:19,939
First car. Where are you at?

65
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,939
There you are, driving into walls.

66
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:24,500
You ain't even going to make it over here.

67
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Your pathing is so...

68
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,519
Bye.

69
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,519
Goodbye.

70
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,980
Sometimes you find a bug in a game.

71
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,519
And sometimes you just interdimensional time warp through every single map that they made.

72
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,519
I have no idea why this is happening.

73
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,519
We've landed.

74
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,519
We're on Jupiter now. Welcome to Jupiter.

75
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,519
Enjoy your stay.

76
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,519
Please pick up your bags at the carousel.

77
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:57,259
What the fuck is actually going on right now?

78
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,259
This just turned into a completely different game.

79
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,579
I feel like I'm soul searching right now.

80
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,779
Look at this.

81
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,779
What happens if I go into like the great void?

82
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:09,910
The great void awaits you.

83
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,899
What's this?

84
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:14,899
A new land.
