1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,379
Look at the people in the background. This dude looks like he's holding two cups that are just invisible.

2
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,070
Hey, can I get one of those soldiers you're holding, dude?

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,070
In your default position?

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,629
I'll just kill this guy. I don't know how much health everybody has.

5
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:32,259
This technique seems to be working pretty well. Oh, another guy. Another guy holding two cups in his hands.

6
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:38,719
Excellent. I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:47,299
Can I please get out of here? I broke his sword.

8
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:51,789
We've been fighting for so long, this guy's sword is broken in half.

9
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:56,789
Yet for some reason he still continues to fight me and I still can't bring his health down past 5%.

10
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,380
Like, I have to be doing something wrong, right?

11
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,379
I have to be.

12
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,180
Both of us wouldn't have arms or legs anymore.

13
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,180
So now both of our swords are broken, which means this is a candlestick fight.

14
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,900
Notice the design work on the candles.

15
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,900
Can we stop this, please? End the fucking tutorial. God.

16
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,650
This is sad. How do I stop this?

17
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:36,939
We're fighting with two broken swords.

18
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:41,310
This guy's wearing like a speedo.

19
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,549
Everybody is talking at once.

20
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:49,370
I can't understand this.

21
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,760
Can you please talk it one at a time?

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Big battle.

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,769
Help, I don't want to die.

24
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:03,769
Whoa.

25
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:06,769
He actually did it?

26
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:10,199
Holy shit.

27
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,360
I didn't think that was that. I thought he was going to just yell it like a taunt, like a command.

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,650
Am I on the train tracks? Can I move?

29
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,340
Train's coming. The fucking train is coming.

30
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:36,599
No way. That's it? What happened?

31
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,610
I don't even know what to even describe what just happened.

32
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:47,419
Did I lose?

33
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:51,229
Hey, I'm allowed to kill you if I want to.

34
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:55,819
That's not too extreme end of the spectrum. I don't know what is.

35
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,819
Oh, hey, hello. I'm going to kill you if I want.

36
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:14,389
This guy's not doing so well.

37
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:19,389
Get out of the way. Don't you see him having fun making this guy stay standing?

38
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:25,960
What is she saying? Oh, fuck.

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,900
No, will you watch out?

40
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,080
Lady, if you don't see, I'm kind of busy right now.

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,780
Take another egg.

42
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,139
I'm not paying for it.

43
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:45,069
All right. That was pretty easy.

44
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,139
I just had to not pay for the egg.

45
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:52,020
These guys are on the case.

46
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,849
Crime rate? I've been arre...

47
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:00,599
You get arrested?

48
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,030
There's just an egg. Come on.

49
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,620
So I stole an egg. What are you going to do?

50
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,120
You're going to like slap me on the wrist?

51
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,129
I am naked tied up in a dungeon.

52
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,129
Other naked dudes are throwing slabs of granite at me.

53
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:22,569
I took an egg.

54
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:26,579
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

55
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:29,579
Can I ask you a question? Do you know where the nearest subway is?

56
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:31,579
I know I could ask one of the officers around here,

57
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:34,579
but you seem like a citizen that knows what they're talking about.

58
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:38,579
So should I take a right down the street or is it a left?

59
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,329
Yeah. Okay. So I should go that way.

60
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:46,040
Oh, no.

61
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,279
Somebody's hurt over here.

62
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:51,160
The dude with the...

63
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,160
You're telling me the dude with the fucking box on his head can't see?

64
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,579
No way. That's unheard of.

65
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:04,860
Again, like, what the fuck are you people doing?

66
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,860
What are you doing? Why would you do something like that?

67
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,860
You can't see or hear the thing tracking along the...

68
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,550
Hey, watch me! Hey, watch this! Hey, watch me!

69
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,069
Let's go fishing in the man-made moat with no fish in it.

70
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,379
That sounds like a plan.

71
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,089
Did you shake... That guy knew.

72
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:29,089
See, that guy knew there were no fish in here.

73
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:33,089
Oh, he was wrong. He was wrong. There's crabs in here.

74
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:37,870
Hey, old lady. Edge up!

75
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,860
No. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's not...

76
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,860
No, no, no, no. Ma'am. Ma'am, you okay?

77
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:54,829
Ma'am? I killed her.

78
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,829
I don't know who they're... Who is he cheering on?

79
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:03,579
Shoot him! Shoot this guy!

80
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:07,100
These guys all have guns.

81
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,100
Will you please light this guy up? Oh, my God.

82
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,470
Shoot him. Somebody shoot him.

83
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,100
The seven of you with guns, shoot this guy.

84
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,100
He's trying to kill me with his blade.

85
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,470
You guys are running around like cockroaches.

86
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:32,790
I just drank a beer.

87
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,610
This is so exciting. You just slashed me with a fucking blade.

88
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,610
I'm going to chug my beer.

89
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,769
This guy can do whatever he wants and nobody cares.

90
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,769
Let's see how long this takes.

91
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:52,939
Where is this guy's health?

92
00:06:52,939 --> 00:07:00,300
Because I feel like this guy's taken at least 15 to 30 bullets into his body.

93
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Like, that was a neck shot. He shot him directly into his neck.

94
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,300
That was in the head. That was in his face.

95
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,189
Is he dead? Oh, I think he's finally...

96
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:13,189
No, he's running. He's running. He's running.

97
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:18,459
He's running. He's running. Put this down.

98
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,459
No! Don't let him get away!

99
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,459
Don't let him get away!

100
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,459
No!
