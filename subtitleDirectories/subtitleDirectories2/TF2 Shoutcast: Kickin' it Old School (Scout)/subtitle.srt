00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:19,379
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight, gonna be doing a good old-fashioned shoutcast, like I used to do back in the day.

2
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,379
Used to talk really fast, used to go over gameplay elements, and that's what I'm gonna do tonight in this video.

3
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:33,549
And the class of choice is gonna be the Scout, using the default scatter gun, the Criticola, and the Candy Can, one of my default setups, my favorite setup as the Scout by far.

4
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:43,789
And before I get started, I do want to say that I am reading the comments, I am taking in your guys' feedback, and here is one of the most requested things I get to do more gameplay-oriented videos.

5
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:50,789
Breaking down how I'm killing people, why I'm choosing the certain targets, and the map direction and all that stuff, that is what this entire video is going to be about.

6
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:59,100
So without further ado, let's get started. Playing on King of the Hill Lake side right now, which is arguably the best Scout map in the game, at least in my opinion.

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:08,099
I find when I play Scout, I can come on here and do very, very well, regardless of if I'm having a bad day or a good day or something like that, it just all clicks on Lake side.

8
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,099
So coming around the left stairwell over here, left or right, depending on where you're looking at it.

9
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:16,099
Get this Scout, he wasn't looking at me off guard, and I get the assist on this Soldier as well.

10
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:24,340
Stay in this area as a Scout. The fact that there is a full health pack in there should make you lead over there for the entire duration of the fight.

11
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:30,340
And also right over here too, there is a medium health pack. Health packs, health packs, health packs, that is I guess what I'm getting at here.

12
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:37,340
Get a route as the Scout where you can run around in a circle almost while you're killing people, picking up these various health packs and staying alive.

13
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:46,579
And the best part about that pool room is there is water in that room. So if you get lit on fire by a Pyro and there's no health pack there, somebody took it recently, you can just jump into the water.

14
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:51,939
So sticking around here on the bottom level patrolling, making sure nobody comes around, no Scouts or anything like that.

15
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:55,939
Not going to go over on that side because there was obviously 55,000 people over there.

16
00:01:55,939 --> 00:02:01,939
Get lit on fire by this Pyro, and this is exactly what I'm talking about over here. Watch the health pack. It's not there.

17
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:05,939
I actually get it because it reappears, but at the same time I could have just jumped right in.

18
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,939
Me and this Soldier fall in there together and I kind of feel bad because that was a random crit right in his face.

19
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:13,939
But at the same time you take those if you can get them, and I ended up getting one.

20
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:18,569
So let's break for a second right here and let me tell you why I'm not entering that room.

21
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,569
Kind of the counter to a Scout is a Mini-Sentry Engineer. There was a Mini-Sentry in that room.

22
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:28,569
He actually came out and I killed him right there. But at the same time, going into this room is certain death for any Scout.

23
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:33,740
If you know there is a Mini-Sentry around, do not just run yourself into death.

24
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,740
Go around the other side, wait for one of the power classes to take it out.

25
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,740
But you are not the one that can kill that. If you do, if you can get it, great.

26
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,240
But most of the time you're going to find yourself in a lot of trouble if there's a Mini-Sentry.

27
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,240
So coming down to about a minute and ten seconds left, the Red Team has not really got on the point.

28
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,240
This is a pretty good push right here, but they don't actually succeed.

29
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,240
Because of course we have a Heavy sitting in the corner waiting for anyone to come through.

30
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Get a nice shot on that Scout and a Pyro chasing me.

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,240
I love that part right there. That Scout just bashed his brains in. He wasn't even paying attention.

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,669
So a small tip, at least on Lakeside. It works for other maps as well.

33
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,669
Take a look at where everyone comes out of the spawn.

34
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:12,669
Everyone tries to find the easiest possible route out of a spawn door.

35
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:15,669
And it just so happens to be the straightforward option.

36
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:20,669
This little S-curve right there is the best possible straightforward option for anyone coming out of the spawn.

37
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:24,669
The only people that go left and right are Snipers and maybe Spies.

38
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:28,669
But that's really it. Most people try to go, like I said, to the easiest possible exit.

39
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:32,669
Which gives you a great little picking round for finding people off guard.

40
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:35,909
As you just saw right there, I got killed by that enemy Scout.

41
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:39,909
Because I had Criticola on and the only explanation for that is I like to live dangerously.

42
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:42,909
And right here, this mini-century is not built yet.

43
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,909
So that's why I kind of went for it. I knew I was going to put it down.

44
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:46,909
Knew I could get it if I could just get in there fast enough.

45
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:48,909
And it actually worked out perfectly.

46
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:52,909
So that is going to wrap up this gameplay. I actually got on the top of the scoreboard.

47
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:54,909
Which is always interesting, always cool.

48
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,909
And this last little bit is just a couple of random clips I put together.

49
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:02,090
Just because I didn't want a three and a half minute video or a four minute video.

50
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,330
So while this kind of ends here, this last Scout gameplay on Lakeside, I want to bring up this question to you guys.

51
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,330
Do you want to see more content like this?

52
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,330
More Shoutcast-y, more gameplay-oriented, more fast-paced.

53
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:20,329
And I know it's about a 50-50 threshold where some people like the other content, some people like this content.

54
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,329
So I'm going to try to bring some of this back a little bit and do this a little more often.

55
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,569
Because I do have a lot of fun doing this.

56
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:32,569
And it's always interesting to get on here and start talking about the gameplay and start talking about the characters and stuff.

57
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:35,569
Only I don't know why I haven't done this in a while, to be honest with you guys.

58
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:38,569
I don't know why I haven't done one of these Shoutcast-type gameplay videos in a while.

59
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,870
And I think it's because it's just been on the back burner a little bit.

60
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,870
I told myself a few weeks ago, I said, I should do another Shoutcast.

61
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,870
I should do another just gameplay Shoutcast video.

62
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,870
And I forgot. I never did it.

63
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,870
And actually yesterday or the day before, I forget what it was, I got a couple of comments of people saying,

64
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,870
Jerma, where's the old Shoutcast, the old gameplay-type videos?

65
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,870
And I went, whoa, my memory jogged.

66
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,870
And I said, you know what? I forgot. I got to do one of those.

67
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,870
So here it is. I hope you guys enjoyed it.

68
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,870
And like I said, please give me some feedback if you want to see some different classes

69
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,870
or if you want to see me continue this type of series, then please let me know.

70
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,180
And I will catch you guys all next time.

71
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,769
So take care, everybody.
