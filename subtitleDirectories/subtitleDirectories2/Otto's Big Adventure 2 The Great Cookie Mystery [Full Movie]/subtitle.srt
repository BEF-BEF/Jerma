Hi everybody, it's me, Arto. This is my second movie, Arto's Big Adventure 2. This is where I invite all my friends over and we eat cookies.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:21,260
Let me introduce you to all my friends. This is Moose and Mari. They're a couple. They're married.

3
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,260
Hi. Hello.

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,820
This is Boo Boo.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,820
Hello. Oh jeez, I'm not that good on camera. Please don't put the camera on me right now.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
And this is me, Arto. Hi.

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
These are so good. I love these.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
Oh jeez, these are the best cookies I've ever eaten in my entire life.

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
Mmm, yeah, they're actually kind of gross.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,820
Mmm, that was good. Now that we ate our delicious cookies, it's time to play outside in the snow. It's snowing.

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,570
Let's go outside. What's that, a leaf?

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,570
Give me the leaf. I don't know what this is, but I'm going to keep it.

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,570
Hold on now. I've got big bones here. I'm coming, I'm coming.

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,570
Let's go and see what that is. Everybody, let's go. Come on, come on, come on.

15
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,570
Hey.

16
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,020
What is it?

17
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,020
Have you guys tried the snow yet? Oh, the snow is just so full of flavor.

18
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:04,260
Where's the rabbit?

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,260
Give me that.

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,260
No, there's a rabbit over here. Stop it.

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,260
I'll bite your face. I'll bite your face off.

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,260
Let's go back inside.

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,260
Okay, let's go inside and eat some more cookies.

24
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:18,400
Oh no, the cookies are all gone. Someone stole the cookies.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,769
Who would do such a thing?

26
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:25,769
We need to find out who did it. Which one of these dogs took the cookies?

27
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:34,769
Let's see, are the cookies in here? Are they in the kitchen? Where are they? Who took them?

28
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:40,760
What about outside? Did somebody bring the cookies outside? Who did this?

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,129
Okay, I don't want to alarm anybody here, but I'm sorry I may have taken a shit in your house.

30
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:57,599
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Frank O'Leary.

31
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:04,599
I am the director and producer of The Great Cookie Mystery, Otto's Big Adventure 2.

32
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:09,599
I'm joined here for the director commentary. Thank you for joining us with Otto the dog.

33
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,599
Hi.

34
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,599
Otto, thank you for joining us.

35
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,599
I like cookies. I eat the cookies.

36
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,599
Yes, of course.

37
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:26,599
This is going to be the commentary of the piece and why certain things were done, a couple of funny stories and that sort of thing.

38
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:35,599
So we'll start by saying that when I got the script from Burger Boy, it was an absolute masterpiece.

39
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:45,969
I wanted to change a few different things, but the studio wasn't really on the same page with the creative team, which I was leading.

40
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:46,969
I was in this movie.

41
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:48,530
Yeah.

42
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,530
I was in this movie. Do you remember how I was in this movie?

43
00:02:51,530 --> 00:03:07,460
OK, so what we were trying to achieve from the yin and the yang perspective of this movie was to show the real struggle of the everyday man and make a metaphor towards the beginning of a new life.

44
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,460
And that's one of the most important things as a visionary creator that I like.

45
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,699
I was in the movie. That's me.

46
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:17,699
Yes, you were in the movie and you did a fantastic job.

47
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,699
Yes, thank you.

48
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:26,699
As the lead man behind the mask, which is exactly what I was trying to do with this piece.

49
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,699
And that's the end of the film.

50
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:38,699
So thank you, everybody, for watching my magnum opus, Otto's Big Adventure 2, The Great Cookie Mystery.
