1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,480
What do you want to do? You want to go out there? Are you sure you want to go out there right now?

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:16,199
All right, how about this? We're we're all going out there. Curtin, get out of the way.

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,730
Fun in the sun, baby. Haven't seen sunshine in like three days. Oh, this is gonna be fun.

4
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:35,579
You want to go outside and play? You want to put the bun on your fat body?

5
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,100
The bun that like can't even go across your whole body because you're too fat?

6
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,329
Yeah, I got my hat. Yeah, you can't, well you can't be talking out here with me.

7
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,990
What? I just walked into the door. Why did you do that?

8
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,489
I kind of look like a dickhead right now too. Look at this. Come on, let's go. Come on, boo boo.

9
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:11,450
All right, can I be completely honest here? It's so bright out right now because the sun is shining

10
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,250
on the snow. There's laser beams shooting into my eyes. That's like how bright it is right now.

11
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,700
I don't need all these clothes. I can't even see anything going on on the camera right now.

12
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,780
I do not need all these clothes on. I probably look like such a dipshit to all the neighbors.

13
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,500
I could be out here in a sweatshirt. Like I'm ready to go like in the snow.

14
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:38,969
God, I look like an idiot. Otto, Otto, I like this little path I got for you.

15
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:54,099
Oh, look at this. This is so like hopeless. Oh no. Come on, Otto. You can do it. Come to me.

16
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,719
All right, well while you do that, let's see how boo boo's doing over there.

17
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:22,729
Hey, boo boo. You almost made it. Otto. Oh, come on. Oh, you can make it. I'm so overdressed right now.

18
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:27,240
Hey, boo boo. All right, I want to show you guys something because this is like,

19
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:35,219
this, dogs for some reason are obsessed with snowballs. For instance, ready, watch my dog.

20
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:40,259
Watch how crazy he gets when he finds out that I have a snowball in my hand. Ready? Look at this.

21
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:46,500
Oh, yeah. Oh, look. They love them. Oh, now he's like, wait, what happened to the magic ball? Oh,

22
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:55,020
jeez. What are you doing? What the hell was that? What, dude, why did it, did somebody just light

23
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:02,419
like a match under your ass? Like what the hell were you doing? Little Otto. All right, we're

24
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:07,479
going to play catch the snowball in your mouth. I figured it was going to be freezing. It's like,

25
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:13,939
it's like 70 degrees out right now. Some blizzard. No, this is like the day after. So a lot of the

26
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:18,740
snow has started to melt already, but I wanted to get out here. I wanted to do some like dog tricks.

27
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:26,500
We're going to do it right now. Dog tricks. Who wants to catch a snowball? Do you want one boo boo?

28
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:34,580
Here. Ready? Yay. See how crazy he just got? He just like almost tried to bite this out of my hand.

29
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,780
I told you when dogs see a snowball, they go nuts. Try it on your dog. If you've got a dog,

30
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,530
make a snowball. He won't even care until you go like this. That's pretty cool. So again,

31
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:52,360
ready? Watch this. Hey boo boo, boo boo. Look at, I got like nothing in my hand. Hey, ready? Crazy.

32
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:02,009
He's crazy now. Now he's insane. All right. You know what? I'm just going to go do like a front

33
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:19,139
flip into the snow right now. Hey, don't try this at home. Go get hurt. Oh, somebody help me. He's,

34
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:26,310
please. He needs your help from the two dogs. Oh, I'm sorry. I just made you do that.

35
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:38,500
Are you all right? He's stuck. Just get out of here. See you guys later. Don't do that at home.

36
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,670
You'll die instantly. Crazy.
