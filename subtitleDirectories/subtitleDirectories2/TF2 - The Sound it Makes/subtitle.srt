00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:22,690
Welcome to the new series here on German 985. It is a game show titled, What's the TF2 Sound?

3
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,690
So we're going to go ahead and invite our first ever contestant, Star Underscore. Welcome to the show, Star.

4
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,690
Hello. What were you doing today? I came all the way from Kentucky to be here on this.

5
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:37,689
Oh, right. Yeah. Okay. So here we go. You're going to have to guess the TF2 sound. Can you get it right? Here we go.

6
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:44,259
That's the scout. That's the scout. What is the TF2 sound?

7
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:50,210
That was just you. That wasn't the TF2. I thought you were going to get like an actual sound clip.

8
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:57,409
No, no, no. What was it? I don't know. What does that sound? You don't know what that is?

9
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:04,409
No, I don't know what that is. Yeah, cut, cut it. Cut the music. No, it was the Mini-Sentry. I don't know how you didn't get that.

10
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,409
That's not what it sounds like. Now, you see, I disagree, but not going to start an argument about this.

11
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,409
That's not the sound it makes. That is the sound it makes. It's rhythmic. It doesn't go...

12
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,409
No, that is the sound. I'm going to prove it to you right now. You want to hear? You want to hear? Are you listening?

13
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,840
You have to check it out right here. You want to hear the sound it makes? No. This is the sound it makes.

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,019
Well, it's set up time. So you're going to have to just wait a second. Okay. Watch out for the spy. Watch out for that spy.

15
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:35,780
I tried to warn him through voice communication and he didn't hear me. All right. Where are you?

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,780
I need to find you. I'm fucking dead. Oh, you died? You just watched him back there.

17
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,780
Well, you're about to get proven. Are you ready to get proved wrong? I'm ready to get proven. Okay, you're about to get proven.

18
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,780
Here we go. You're not with me. Oh, you're the healer. Okay. I'm the healer.

19
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:59,019
Take a listen. It's going to start here in a second. No, it's not. He blew it up. He's ubered. Run. Just run away.

20
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:06,019
Okay, now is the moment of truth. Now it's time for you to hear the Mini-Sentry sound. Ladies and gentlemen, here we go.

21
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:17,020
I think you're delaying. I think you're doing this on purpose. No, I'm just going back to the medicine cabinet to get some aspirin and let's go.

22
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:24,669
Okay, I'm following you everywhere. I'm the healer. Time to hear the sound once and for all.

23
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:36,680
I feel like this video is going to be 90% built up. Can we please make this thing? I want to just... All right, kill me.

24
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:44,610
Kill me? Okay, I'm going to put it down right here. Ladies and gentlemen, here we go. Time to hear the sound.

25
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:53,610
Here we go eventually. We're going to hear that this is not the sound. Listen to Sentry right now. It's just going beep beep. It beeps like one. It doesn't go beep beep beep. It beeps.

26
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:02,729
No, it goes beep beep beep. See, you're going to hear it double because of this guy. I'm going to hear a lot of it. He's going to Rancho Relaxo all over this beep beep beep beep beep beep.

27
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:06,729
See, right now, listen carefully. No, now no one's going to come over here.

28
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:17,110
Just wait. Somebody will come through the door. Going up the right side. I'm currently moving up the right side.

29
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,110
Just put it in this corner. Just put it in that corner and someone will come out eventually. No, not that fucking corner.

30
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:28,110
Why? I shot it over here. They're going to come out the door and just see it. This corner? This corner. Like sneak it.

31
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,110
All right, it's very sneaky. That's a very sneaky...

32
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,110
Okay, now we just need to wait and hear the sound.

33
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,349
Yeah, and we're going to see who's right and who's wrong. I think it goes beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.

34
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:44,469
You don't think so. I don't think so this scout this scouts gonna get didi didi didi, but not that doesn't

35
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,469
I would love for him to walk out here

36
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:49,099
Will you just walk out here?

37
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,150
He's gonna do this forever

38
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,740
He's gone. Oh

39
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,259
See listen. Oh, no, did you hear that?

40
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,740
You heard it didn't you?

41
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:07,030
No, no, no, no, no, it never did that before. Why is it doing it? It's doing it. It's not doing it

42
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,990
I do you can't have my bananas. I just bought those are my bananas. I'm taking them from you

43
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:20,610
I would have to wash my dishes again. Look at all these look at all these didi didis. I'm getting you want

44
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:27,949
Oh, you think it's gonna work. What is going on in here? It's me. I'm the medic, but I'm the medic. Oh, you're this medic

45
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:33,699
Things in your brain just don't add up right away do they

46
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,379
Hey, I'm this medic

47
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,860
Oh, you're this medic

48
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:47,769
Right. Well for the second part of this, but that's a sad despite for the second part of this video

49
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:49,769
I need you to be on my team

50
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,170
Okay, this is my heart and join your team. This is part two of the sounds

51
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:58,970
What's how do they make them? So?

52
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:01,089
for part two

53
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:05,550
Quite quite quite quite quite quite quite what sound is that in the game tf2?

54
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:12,870
That is no sound in tf2. You just screamed for like the 12 seconds. Oh, that's not a sign. That's you great joke

55
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,269
I think I already fucking made it. No, that sound isn't tf2. Oh really?

56
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:19,350
What was that sense you have to guess you have to figure it out

57
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,509
So you tell me there is on this map mine at least was close

58
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:27,629
Yours was not yours was nothing your mind was close enough. You you just be like

59
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:39,779
No, that sound is part of this map the ecosystem. Is it the cart? Did I win? No, it's a weapon

60
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:50,370
Oh, so it's we were only doing weapons like you did the weapon slinger do it again for me. It's different every time

61
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,279
That is not a sound you have to know it's a gun

62
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,899
rocket launcher no

63
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,220
grenade launcher no cold

64
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:07,339
the scatter gun

65
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:11,660
No, no, no, no, no, no, you're not thinking the right way katana. No

66
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,300
What the fuck is it then? It's

67
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,860
Someone I mean, it doesn't have been the huntsman the huntsman. No

68
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,120
I

69
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,439
Lock and load. No, this is great. Yes. Yes

70
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,120
Thank God, how did I not get that? I know it doesn't hurt people that was the clue

71
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,959
I know is it hurting such as good is it hurting such as good such as good is it healing such as good?

72
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,600
well that uh

73
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,689
That sounds absolutely nothing like what you did

74
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:50,110
No, that's exactly what it is. Like the no the first initial activation. It starts off like that and it goes down

75
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:53,990
Okay, well we got that that mystery solved

76
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:00,839
I'm gonna go ahead and play some demo night for the remainder of the video and then end the video
