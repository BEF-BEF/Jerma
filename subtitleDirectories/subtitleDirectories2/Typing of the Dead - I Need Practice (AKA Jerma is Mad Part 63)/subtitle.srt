1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:10,509
Hey, what's going on everybody?

2
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:16,140
Jerma here. I apologize I'm currently eating some Halloween candy because it's Halloween.

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:23,059
And what better way to celebrate Halloween than to play, you know, Typing of the Dead Overkill just came out on Steam.

4
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,339
So a couple things you-

5
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:27,019
What's up, motherfucker?

6
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,339
They met as adversaries.

7
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:31,179
Who the fuck was that for?

8
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:33,939
A monster made them allies.

9
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:40,060
So the Typing of the Dead, as you can see, is a game about writing on your keyboard.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,719
You can only kill monsters if you type. You can't- there is no, like, shooty gun thing.

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,960
There is no weapons.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,820
It's only your keyboard. What the fuck is that?

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,460
GOOTORARIO? I don't even know what that is.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,250
I'm such a bad typer too, guys. I apologize. I have to, like, look at my keyboard. I suck so bad.

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,530
But yeah, this game came out a long time ago.

16
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,519
And they just re-imagined it.

17
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:13,209
God, I'm so bad. God, I'm terrible at typing.

18
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:17,890
Hey, you know what? Let's make a Typing of the Dead video on a guy who can't type for shit.

19
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,370
That sounds like a good idea.

20
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,310
In the difficulty, you can make it much harder than this.

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,430
I can't believe I have to look down every single time at my keys. That is so bad.

22
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,069
I'm such a terrible, terrible typer.

23
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:35,500
Flabwagon.

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,140
So I think there's gonna be co-op eventually on this game.

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,140
But it's good to see they actually brought this series back.

26
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,700
Cut them down.

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,219
Phew. OK, we got through the first room. Can I reload?

28
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:53,180
I don't think reloading really matters. OK, I gotta get ready. There's gonna be a couple.

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,659
There's gonna be a few coming through the store.

30
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:03,450
God.

31
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,790
I'm sorry I'm not, like, talking.

32
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,870
This takes all of my brain power to be able to do this.

33
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:17,669
What? What happened to the words that were just already there?

34
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,949
But if you are looking for something to help...

35
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,729
I can't talk.

36
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,580
If you're looking for...

37
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,979
OK, can I have a two second break?

38
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:35,020
If you're looking for some way to help your typing out, this is probably the game to do it,

39
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,439
because you get to kill zombies in the same time, right?

40
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,449
The best back rubs.

41
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:45,689
This is actually helping me.

42
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:49,330
This is helping my typing, guys.

43
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,090
I'm becoming a type master because of typing of the dead.

44
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,800
Oh, shit.

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,620
Shit! Fuck you!

46
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,300
I love how I thought this was a great idea to make a video on this

47
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,069
when I can't even pay attention to even talking.

48
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:10,030
I'm such a brain dead fuck.

49
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,319
I have to, like, pay complete attention to my keyboard and, like, nothing else.

50
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:22,199
Oh, am I making a video right now or am I trying to use my 100% of my brain to play this video game?

51
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,960
I'm not sure.

52
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,180
Big Berza!

53
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,719
Well, those are for extra points. I get it, I get it, I get it.

54
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,340
Uh-oh.

55
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,520
Oh, boy. Hot diggity dog.

56
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,840
I like how it gives you the...

57
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,659
If you make an incorrect keystroke, it's not just going to, like, make...

58
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,759
Hold your fire.

59
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,900
Mutilate.

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,219
Civilian rescued.

61
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:55,340
5,000 points, dude. Are you kidding me?

62
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,979
Rack it up. Rack up the points.

63
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:04,180
Whose head is that?

64
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,139
I am such an old person.

65
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:12,139
I am, like, 75 years old right now.

66
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:17,620
All right, type C-A-Y-N-I-D.

67
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,180
Some of you guys can probably blow through this, and I give you a lot of props

68
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,980
because typing has never been my forte.

69
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,610
I've never been able to really do it that well.

70
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,129
I have a legitimate headache.

71
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:35,509
These guys ain't human.

72
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,790
Never seen this kind of crazy shit before.

73
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,279
All right, so what is this? What is this acting?

74
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,740
Boss fight. Oh, I have to hit I.

75
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,819
Shit. Oh, my. I'm getting owned.

76
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,579
This guy is owning me.

77
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:55,740
I've gotten hit by every single thing.

78
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,379
No. No, Z.

79
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,250
There we go. There we go.

80
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,300
About to rage quit this game.

81
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,180
About to rage quit this game.

82
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm about to put my hand through my monitor.

83
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,980
I'm about to seriously...

84
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,279
There's going to be some serious rage in a second

85
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,720
because of how awful and how stupid I am

86
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,800
and how... Give me a chance.

87
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,829
That's so... Just give me the gun.

88
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:30,060
I'll take the gun.

89
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:39,939
What's going on?

90
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,800
I think they just made it way easier for me

91
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,399
because the game could tell I was having a ton of trouble.

92
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,819
Look, look at how easy these words are now.

93
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:51,060
We could tell that you, like, sucked ass.

94
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:59,180
We're going to give you, like, some wicked easy words, like am and okay.

95
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,740
Hopefully that trend keeps up. Look, oh, Sam.

96
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,819
Hog. Tap.

97
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:06,220
And I still missed it.

98
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,060
I still missed it.

99
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,300
Oh, we're back to being difficult now.

100
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,540
That's so funny.

101
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,569
What was it? C? B? Homework?

102
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:23,490
D. You missed me.

103
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,250
I wish I could do some better commentary, guys,

104
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,100
but it is mildly pathetic that my brain can't do two things at once.

105
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,829
I'm going to lose again. I'm going to fucking lose again.

106
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,769
Can I have the wicked simple easy words again?

107
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:42,930
Give me, like, two fro fought easy words.

108
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:50,220
Come on, man. Bye. Done. I did it.

109
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,620
I beat the first boss in the typing of the dead.
