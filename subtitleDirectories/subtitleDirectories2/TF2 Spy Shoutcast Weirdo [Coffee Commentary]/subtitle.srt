1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,210
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 GAME PLAY commentary.

2
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:24,210
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Spy with the Conivers, Kunai, the Ambassador, and the STRANGE making this part up.

3
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,210
Um, the... Why the hell can I not say the name of this item? The Sapper! God, Jerma, what the hell?

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,210
Get eaten by the cot. Or don't get eaten by the cot. It missed ya. Bang. Headshot. Boom.

5
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,210
As you can already tell, this is a coffee commentary of Justice and Doom.

6
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,210
And what that means is I just hit record and I backstab two heavies in a row.

7
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,210
And then I just start talking about anything that could be on the screen. I don't know what's gonna be happening.

8
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,210
It could be something that is not on the screen.

9
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:53,210
Like, for instance, I could have you direct your attention right now to outside the current window in the room you are in right now.

10
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,210
There is a monster and he's gonna get... No, there's not really a monster out there, although there very well could be.

11
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,210
So, just for me, be careful. Just make sure there's no monster. Are you looking?

12
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,209
Okay, good. There's no monster out there. So, let's move on now. We're gonna talk about the spy.

13
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,209
I'm gonna talk about some spy tactics and some spy strategies.

14
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:15,200
As you can see right there, I sap that sentry and got the hell out... What? Dude, what? You shot right in the back.

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm trying to do like a spy strategy and you shoot me right in my freaking back. What a real friggin' embarrassment that was.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,379
Anyways, when you sap a sentry, one of the main important things you want to do is get the hell out of there.

17
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:32,379
If there is an opportunity for you to stab the engineer and get out, don't dilly-dally around and like look at your watch and...

18
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:36,379
Well, literally look at your watch, but don't metaphorically look at your watch.

19
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:41,379
When you sap a sentry, there was a heavy standing right next to that engineer. He actually was shooting at me.

20
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:47,379
Just run away. Just go away and try to get another kill because you're gonna stand around too much and you're gonna get yourself shot right in the balls.

21
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:50,379
Kind of like what happened to me about 15 seconds ago.

22
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:55,680
Another tip right here, if you have the opportunity, shoot the engineer in his face.

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Don't wait around for the enemy to get backstabbed. Just shoot him right in his face and you know what?

24
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,980
Shoot this guy in his freaking face too.

25
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,979
I actually get a couple of good ambassador headshots in this gameplay. I think you've already seen the good ones.

26
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,979
I could be completely wrong, but let's start shoutcasting now. We do that sometimes in these coffee commentary.

27
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,979
He's getting that backstab on that heavy who was trying to get the car to be suppressed.

28
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:22,979
Coming around the ramp here, Jerma is gonna come up and hide because he doesn't want to be seen by the heavy, especially the guy in the top left here.

29
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:28,979
So he backs up. Demoman is unfortunately enough jumping into it in front of the knife and he gets backstabbed right there.

30
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:31,979
Going for a headshot. Maybe Jerma decides to back off there, but he gets it.

31
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,979
One headshot does not pull off the second one, unfortunately.

32
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:38,979
If he had only had one more second time, he probably would have had that shot.

33
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:41,979
Now he is being very cautious because he doesn't want to go up here by himself.

34
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:44,979
Wants at least two or three people to maybe distract somebody.

35
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:49,979
A heavy sees him, gets a couple of shots on him, but Jerma does not back down that easily, it seems.

36
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:53,979
He's still gonna hide here. Not sure why he's doing this. Maybe that heavy does not think he's still here.

37
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,979
Disguising himself as a pyro to try and throw the heavy off.

38
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,979
Maybe he's not gonna be in there anymore. Maybe he's gonna decide to go for this.

39
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:00,979
He's gonna go for the sentry gun. Engineer going back into spawn for some more metal.

40
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,979
He gets the sapper down. Medic coming out with the ubersaw.

41
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:04,979
He gets a couple of hits on him. Does not kill Jerma.

42
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:08,979
He's gonna find his way down here to hide back in the original spot.

43
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:11,979
It's just unbelievable. Can't believe he got away with that one, ladies and gentlemen.

44
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:15,979
The sapper was removed, unfortunately, and looks like he's gonna try for some crazy.

45
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:20,979
He gets the stab on that heavy. Oh my goodness gracious, that guy is probably rage-witting right now.

46
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:23,979
But let's take a break here for a moment, folks. I'm gonna talk about our sponsor for a second.

47
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:27,979
Crispy cream ice cream cones. Make sure you get one. They're delicious. Crispy creams.

48
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:31,979
Now let's get back into the action here. Jerma is gonna disguise as a heavy.

49
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,979
This is a pretty risky move, ladies and gentlemen.

50
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:36,979
Jerma does not understand that he moves a lot slower as a heavy.

51
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:41,159
But I don't think he realizes this because he's an idiot and sometimes he does not think logically.

52
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,159
But he's coming back up here trying to find his way back up top.

53
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,159
What a beautiful stab by that spycicle. And a pyro shows up.

54
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,159
But he doesn't do anything, so Jerma is gonna be fine.

55
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,159
But just in case he drops down, does not want to be in that situation.

56
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,159
Sees the knife, raise nose. This is a spy. We got spy on spy action here.

57
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:58,159
Goes in front of him. He gets a whirlwind stab.

58
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,159
I've never seen anything like that, folks. A whirlwind stab.

59
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,159
In all my years of casting Team Fortress 2, which is actually like 15 minutes that I've been doing this,

60
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,159
I have never seen anything like that before.

61
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,159
And he's gonna get another stab on this guy. No, he's not.

62
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,159
No, run. Just get out of there. Oh. Shoot him. Get him. Please. Oh.

63
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:20,740
Did I really just spend the last like half of this video doing a shellcast?

64
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,740
Is that like what just happened?

65
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,740
Am I gonna have to title this video? It's a shellcast, even though it's a coffee commentary?

66
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
You know what? It's gonna be coffee commentary slash.

67
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:37,660
Oh. My elbow. Oh, damn it.

68
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,839
Okay. Anyways, before the video is over, I'm gonna stop shellcasting now.

69
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,839
I do want to bring this up. I want to mention something.

70
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,839
If you watch American football, the Patriots just won.

71
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,839
They're going to the AFC Championship game now.

72
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,839
If you're not big into sports, neither am I.

73
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,839
But it's still pretty interesting to see that and to know that.

74
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,839
So if you guys are football fans, let me know the teams that you're rooting for that are currently, I guess, still in it.

75
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,839
With that being with the Patriots or the Atlanta Falcons or something.

76
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,839
And if you're from a different country, then you can just disregard this statement.

77
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,839
That was pretty sick right there, by the way, that stab.

78
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,839
That guy was invisible. And that guy is dead now.

79
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,839
But yeah, I just want to get your guys' opinion on the football playoffs.

80
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,839
Because it's something I'm currently watching right now.

81
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,079
And now I'm on fire. And I die right up here.

82
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,079
I remember dying from this because there was like five million pyros or like two or three or something.

83
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,079
But that's going to pretty much conclude the video.

84
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,079
We actually pull off the victory right here.

85
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,079
Thank you all so, so much for watching.

86
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,079
I really do appreciate this coffee commentary shoutcast thing.

87
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,079
Whatever you want to call it.

88
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,079
But yeah, I do really do appreciate it, guys.

89
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,079
Let me know what you think.

90
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,079
And I'll see you all next time.

91
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,079
And of course, take care, everybody.

92
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,079
Coffee commentary, baby.

93
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,079
Let's drink some more like tea.

94
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,899
Is this tea? I don't know.

95
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:51,529
Yeah, it's tea.
