1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:11,089
So we're having a competition who can make the worst one.

2
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:15,259
Yes, the competition here is whoever makes the uglier person wins.

3
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:18,839
And in the comment section, please take your vote.

4
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,809
Whoever makes the ugliest, worst, disgusting character wins the hundred bucks.

5
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:27,350
Why is it always a hundred bucks?

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,149
Because it is a hundred bucks.

7
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:35,899
Why do I... Can I like plug my gamepad in? This is awful. This is horrendous.

8
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,740
Yes, that looks like it healed nicely.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
Ow! My fucking head!

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,200
I just made myself an instant migration!

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Okay, skip, skip this. Get out of here.

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,439
Everything's going black for a second. Oh my... Where are you?

13
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:15,299
What is going on? What are you?

14
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,900
Look how my sideburns match my beard.

15
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,900
Yeah, look real close. Look real close. I'm Schmiegel.

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,900
You really are. You got boobs, dude.

17
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,900
Okay, so in the comment section, go ahead and vote.

18
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,900
Who has the ugliest character?

19
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,859
Hey Jerma, wanna have a lot of fun?

20
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:41,489
Have fun.

21
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:42,659
What the hell are you doing?

22
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,659
Have fun. I'm never unpausing it.

23
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,340
Look at all your options.

24
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,939
Look at all the things you get to do. I'm leaving. Bye.

25
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:53,939
I'm done. Bye.

26
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,890
We've got dumb shit to do.

27
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,019
Is he really gone?

28
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:09,129
Star. What?

29
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,259
Oh, we have to go this way. This way. Get back in quick.

30
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,259
Before the cops show up.

31
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:19,259
This helicopter is really close to the ground.

32
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:23,259
Look at this helicopter. Look how close to the ground this is.

33
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,370
I'm wedged in.

34
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,370
Are you dead right now? Did you die?

35
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,370
No, are you dead?

36
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:37,849
No, I'm backing up and going forward. I think this guy is dead on my lap.

37
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,849
Where are you? Just get in the car.

38
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:43,849
Just get in the car.

39
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,789
Now I'm dead.

40
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:52,789
You're telling me the helicopter that was five feet off the ground crashed?

41
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:57,610
I got you. Revive your dead homie.

42
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,210
You're ugly. I don't want you to revive me.

43
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,580
Will you please get in the car?

44
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,580
You get in the car.

45
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,580
Before we can make our daring escape.

46
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,139
Or can we?

47
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:19,580
This guy right here.

48
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,580
I forgot you could do that in this game.

49
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,969
Come with me.

50
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:28,969
Star, you want to play a game called throw the guy at you?

51
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:30,969
What?

52
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,969
How do you do that?

53
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,419
You didn't need to kill them.

54
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,780
Fairly certain I just ruined everything.

55
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,020
Pretty sure I just ruined everything.

56
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,020
How do you buy shit? What do you fucking stop?

57
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,370
What?

58
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,370
That guy went through the windshield backwards.

59
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,930
Gas station.

60
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,930
Gas station where?

61
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,169
Gas station.

62
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,169
No, dude.

63
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,170
We needed to get gas.

64
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,170
Let's go. Fill her up, sweetie.

65
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,110
How do you blow up the same gas station twice?

66
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,990
I don't understand.

67
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,480
I think we got him.

68
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,480
I think we got him. What is this guy doing?

69
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,310
You gotta revive your homies, okay?

70
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,310
Calm down and revive your homies.

71
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,970
I can hear you clicking.

72
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,970
Yeah, you get him. You get him.

73
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,420
No, you get my guy.

74
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,079
What?

75
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,079
Can I do that again?

76
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,079
I have to see if that works again.

77
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:21,370
Wait, how do you?

78
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,370
You have to have a gun out.

79
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,370
Come here.

80
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,370
Hold on, I'm trying to get a hold of somebody.

81
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,370
No, you don't need a hostage.

82
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,370
Yes, I want you to hit both of us.

83
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,370
Fucking ass.

84
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,939
That's vicious.

85
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,750
So you hold control now?

86
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,990
Hold it.

87
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,620
You have to like count down.

88
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,649
Oh my god, there's another fucking fire alarm in this building.

89
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,649
I'll see you later.

90
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,069
Hopefully Star is okay.
