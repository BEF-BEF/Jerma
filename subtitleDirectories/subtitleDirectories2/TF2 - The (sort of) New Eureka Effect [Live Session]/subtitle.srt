1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,290
Hey, what is going on everybody?

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,500
Jerma here with a live gameplay commentary.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,339
Playing as the engineer with the new Eureka effect, soldier.

4
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:17,420
And you're probably saying to yourself,

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,059
damn it, to explain what you're talking about here, engineer.

6
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:26,140
Well, I will. The old Eureka effect was not really that good and it still ain't

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,179
really that good right now. The 50% slower repair rate and upgrade rate

8
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:36,539
takes 17 goddamn times before you get your central to zero to 200

9
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,710
or any of your other buildings, of course. But that's okay because now you can

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,109
teleport to spawn or you can teleport to an exit

11
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:48,710
whenever you happen to feel like it. So we're gonna let Jerma take over here.

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,030
He's gonna do a live commentary about the Eureka effect and I'm gonna go

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,100
and fill my diaper with shit. Oh, a sandwich.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,560
That was delicious. That was delicious. That was delicious.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,680
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Not gonna waste any time here.

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,480
I'm gonna try to actually get the tele- I want to

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,799
show you the teleporter thing. I'm gonna try to- whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

18
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,340
Oh god, I hate when this happens. You get like the uber for two seconds and

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,939
you think, oh my, it must be a panic uber and you run out and then it ends on you

20
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,260
and you turn around running backwards and you just get absolutely annihilated.

21
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,019
We really can't get out of here. I'm gonna go for

22
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:36,790
Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones engineer. You guys ready?

23
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,500
This is what we call Indiana Jones. See, I helped.

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,120
I helped with that. Come on, give me the kill.

25
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,969
I'm just gonna put this here for just because to give a

26
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:50,810
distraction so I can come up here and kill this guy.

27
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,930
No, the soldier already get down. Okay, good job.

28
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:59,000
That was exactly what I was going to do. What the fuck?

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,310
Oh, was he standing right there? Did I just completely miss that guy?

30
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,789
Well, whatever. Now I have some time. I've got some time to build

31
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:14,020
up my entrances and stuff. Hopefully we don't just steam roll right now

32
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,139
because that would not be good because I do want to try this eureka effect thing.

33
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,939
I want to go teleport to the exit. I want to find myself in a

34
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:29,240
teleportation device. Okay, we're just gonna forget.

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,120
You know what? Let's try. No, that's a bad idea. I was...

36
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,849
Oh my god, I'm gonna stop burping. Let's build this just so I can carry it.

37
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:43,099
This is the worst part though. This takes so long.

38
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:48,039
Let's get that exit built right here. So now...

39
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,439
Shoot him! What the hell was that? Did you guys see that?

40
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,569
No, no, no, no, no, no. This ain't gonna happen.

41
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:01,560
I knew you needed like a two percent shot left.

42
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,159
But once this exit is built, I can do wacky

43
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,000
stuff like this. Let's see if I can do it. Here we go. And let's go back to base.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,020
Let's fill up on our ammo. And then let's immediately go back to

45
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:22,120
the teleporter exit. Okay, here we are. So that's kind of cool. That's cool.

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,479
Is it good enough? I don't know, because look, it really does

47
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:30,680
take such an absurdly long time to build up your centuries and to

48
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,819
repair and everything. So I don't know, I guess if you like to

49
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:36,699
fly around and teleport around stuff, it's kind of cool.

50
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:44,469
But at the same time, at what cost? At what cost? This is a really bad idea

51
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:45,990
because I don't have the Wrangler, but you know,

52
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,909
he probably does. I wonder if he does. Well, this is a terrible idea.

53
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:52,969
This is like a, yeah, this is the worst idea I've ever had.

54
00:03:52,969 --> 00:04:02,969
Yeah, hey, hey, get him. Spray him. What? Oh, well that sucks. That really

55
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,349
sucks. What is this guy doing? This guy's like

56
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:12,789
inside of the door. Oh, I need some ammo to be the refill.

57
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:20,620
Let's get a dispenser up right here. Are we moving? Kind of. We're kind of

58
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:27,129
moving. Yeah, sort of. Let's build this up here.

59
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:31,500
That's probably a better idea. Better idea?

60
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,160
Maybe. I just, I don't have the Wrangler on, which is

61
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,860
not going to help me that much. Yeah, this is bad. It's all right though.

62
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,139
A little bit of distraction. It'll get probably one or two kills. It'll get this

63
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,920
guy too. No, maybe not. Well, if yeah, actually if

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,139
this guy peeks out, yeah, he's dead. This guy's dead because here comes a demo.

65
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,860
Fighting him. I'll just, you don't screw it. I'll go down there and get him. Wait

66
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,540
a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a

67
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,579
minute. Wait just one minute. Yes. I was going to say,

68
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:09,050
it's, that guy's not real. Oh, I need, I need my stuff. I gotta go back up

69
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,459
there and grab the sentry. Dispenser's gonna have to die,

70
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:17,459
unfortunately, because like I don't really care to repair it or bring it

71
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:23,269
because we're moving too fast. Come here. And we're about to get this

72
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:28,459
next spawn. So, life of an offensive engineer. You're

73
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:34,199
just constantly moving. But it's fun though. It's a fun time.

74
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,300
Where's that guy go? That's a spy. Oh, shit. No, don't go up there.

75
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,540
Get, please tell me you're gonna kill that Pyro because I really don't want to

76
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,589
deal with him. Come on, build, build, build, build.

77
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:50,439
You're, yeah, you're still alive. Still alive. I'm gonna have to do spy callout.

78
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:56,790
Spy creeping around here. Where is he? Which one? He's probably gonna appear

79
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,060
right next to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

80
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,649
Well, I'll just have to kill you. Well, no, I won't kill you. Somebody else will.

81
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:14,550
Get out of here. Damn, dude. You're making my life hard.

82
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,470
Can somebody just get rid of that little mini sentry so I can build this?

83
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:25,290
Oh, damn. Kill him before he gets the sentry.

84
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,610
Holy shit, what the fuck is going on up there? I'm dead.

85
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,850
I'm gonna burn. Bye. But, please, there's like five people.

86
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:45,560
There's an entire crew in that room. Oh, my god. This sentry is doing so much

87
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,689
work right now. Why do I not have an exit built? I could

88
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:57,899
just teleport right to it right now. This thing. They have a teleporter in

89
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:03,240
here? Is that what this has to be, right? Yeah, they do. All right. Well, let's just

90
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,500
get rid of this stuff. I'm so sorry that you're dead. I'm so

91
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,040
sorry that you died right there. Nothing I could have done.

92
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,930
Nothing that could be done. We actually might win this right now.

93
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,769
I have, like, not shown the Eureka effects, like, cool abilities,

94
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:26,730
like, really yet. I've shown it, like, one time. We're just playing, like, engineer.

95
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,810
All right, now we're gonna show up, because I'm gonna have an opportunity

96
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:34,730
here to build an exit right here. Exit's gonna, by the time this is built,

97
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,050
so here's the strategy. Here's the, here's the strat right here. We're gonna try to

98
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,250
get this thing built. I'm gonna teleport back to spawn. So,

99
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,420
here we go. Teleporting back to spawn. Let's go, fill up, and then immediately

100
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:51,240
come back. Very good. And there you go. We are back.

101
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,959
I can build. Actually, I should destroy that so I can build one down here.

102
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,500
And, you know, we're gonna do it again. We're gonna do it again. We're gonna go

103
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,139
right back to spawn and come right back immediately.

104
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:10,259
Fill up, come right back. Hello. Yes, that is very cool. Who was it? What?

105
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:16,470
Oh, it's this guy. Well, don't. What is this guy doing?

106
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,829
What was that guy doing? Let's get this to level three,

107
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:26,310
and then we're gonna build an entrance so people can actually use this thing.

108
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,240
That would be ideal, right?

109
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:38,809
Oh, should I move this? I feel like this is not

110
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,299
really doing, yeah, it's not really doing that much right now.

111
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:48,169
We're moving too fast. Hey, spy. Block him. Block him. He's right here

112
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:55,899
somewhere. Where? I don't know. He's down here.

113
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:01,259
Get this. Come on, come on, come on. Hurry up. Get to level three already.

114
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:04,809
Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.

115
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:09,799
It's okay. Here's the deer. Here's the deer. We are going to go back to spawn. I'm

116
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,710
going to build the entrance right out here. So,

117
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:21,259
entrants go up, bring you right to the action, and you know, while that's

118
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:24,899
building, let's just go ahead and teleport to the exit.

119
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:32,779
Hello. All right. Sentry going up, but this one I want like...

120
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:38,360
No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't think so. I just don't think so. Not today.

121
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,590
Not today. And what do we say to the god of death?

122
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:49,269
Not today. It's built. Is this? No, it's not level three. This is going to take

123
00:09:51,620 --> 00:10:01,179
Ugh. What a snooze. What a total snooze. I would have been already done by now.

124
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:05,210
Well, it's level two now. At least it's level two. We'll just get it to level

125
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,149
three. Why not? I mean, what else am I doing

126
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,220
right now? I'm just sitting here being a fucking

127
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:18,299
dingus. I don't want to get backstabbed. That would not be cool.

128
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,490
Level three. Oh my god, somebody's calling me.

129
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:31,960
On the... Get... Move. Leave me alone. I don't want to be called right now. There

130
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:36,840
we go. Let's move. Let's get some action in here.

131
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,519
That was a good like three full minutes of me hitting things with a wrench.

132
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:47,240
So we got that. Got that covered. And there's a pyro dead. There's another

133
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,580
pyro that's gonna die. That's two dead pyros. Let's get on it.

134
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,590
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move. Now I'll get off of it because there's

135
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:02,169
somebody trying to come destroy my stuff. He's dead. There's another guy over here

136
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:09,500
just on fire. All right. We are going... No, we're not going to destroy that yet.

137
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,460
Oh, I wish this thing was the rescue ranger. Where am I going?

138
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,289
I'm not sure what I'm doing here, guys, but I did it.

139
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:23,779
Well, let's get on. Let's push it. We don't gotta go far.

140
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:29,450
Exit. Exit strategy. This thing still shooting? It is.

141
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,049
I may leave this back here just for the denial, the area denial, if anyone wants

142
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:38,090
to come back here and screw with us. But then again, it might not be a terrible

143
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:45,100
idea to bring it to the front lines. And let's...

144
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,240
He's a dead ringer. Can I come back in time? Yes, I can.

145
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,850
But we are right here anyways. Yeah, this... I can destroy my

146
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,379
exit. There's no reason to have it right now. Can't really build... Unless I could

147
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,860
do this, I'm gonna try for something really, really...

148
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,509
I wonder if I can do it. If I can do it, it'll be really cool.

149
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:13,610
Let's get rid of the entrance and let's try to build an exit. Just an exit down

150
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:19,669
here where nobody cares to look. Oh, but no, I'm being chased.

151
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:25,830
Shit. I didn't realize like three people were still chasing me.

152
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,580
All right, we gotta end this. I gotta go power class. We needed power.

153
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,220
Engineer was just not doing it at the moment. And what is happening and how is

154
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,090
this guy still killing everybody? Let me get that medic.

155
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,590
Let me get that medic. Let's do it. Me and you, baby.

156
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,019
Me and you. We're gonna take on the whole world.

157
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:52,600
All right, I'll just turn the corner and just get exploded by a

158
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,509
rocket. This is the one. This is the one. We only have two minutes and 28 seconds.

159
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:03,690
This has to happen now. I got a telephrag. All right.

160
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,500
I'll take a telephrag. Here we go. Here we go. This is the push.

161
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,159
We got it. Here we go. This is the one. This is the push.

162
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:20,440
Come on now. Geez, man. They got so much stuff and so many people. This is not the

163
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,049
push. I don't think this is the push at all.

164
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:29,059
That didn't hit him. You've gotta be kidding me.

165
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:34,019
That hit somebody. Any more medics? Where'd you go, man? Where'd you go?

166
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:41,159
Where'd you go? I need some heals. I need some heals.

167
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:47,750
Man, oh man. Come on now. Here we go. Come on.

168
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,700
Everybody get on it. We got some advantage here. We got an advantage.

169
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:58,899
We got the slight advantage. Come on, drop down.

170
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:03,220
Oh, I got fucking backstabbed. No. God damn it. I was gonna detonate that.

171
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,899
We got it. We got it. We got it. Come on. Everybody get on there.

172
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:15,059
All human beings get on there. Come on. I gotta get out there. I gotta get out there.

173
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,740
It's so close. We have one minute. One minute.

174
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,159
One minute. They're all going over there. It didn't hit anybody.

175
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:29,000
Come on. I don't think we're gonna do it. No, don't be bad attitude. That was a bad

176
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,649
attitude. Let's go. Get it. I died. Shit.

177
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:41,399
Oh, unless we get up there right now. 46 seconds.

178
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:48,259
Come on now. Let's just do this thing. Spoke too soon. That's

179
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:52,409
a spy. Shit, if I just couldn't aim my weapon.

180
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:58,220
That guy would have died a long time ago. Go this way. I'm going this way.

181
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,929
No, I'm not. Too many scouts. Don't care. I'm wrapping around.

182
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:07,820
Wrap all the way around. I got full ammo. Full loaded.

183
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,690
There we go. Scout doesn't know. Neither does the spy.

184
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:20,230
Now he does. All right. We just gotta get this heavy. Gotta get this heavy up here.

185
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,000
Get on it. Just get on it. Stop bottling. Come on.

186
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,559
Get on it. Come on, everybody. I'm getting off. I'm getting off. You gotta get off

187
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,639
right now because you gotta help out the team. You gotta get the

188
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:38,470
people that are going in. That's a critscreek.

189
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,419
This is too intense for my brain. Come on, push it.

190
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:49,019
I don't care about the gloves. No. No.

191
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,240
We were close. That's gonna wrap it up though. Thank you, everybody, so much for

192
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,799
watching. This has been Rage Demo and EurekaSnooze Best Engineer. Thank

193
