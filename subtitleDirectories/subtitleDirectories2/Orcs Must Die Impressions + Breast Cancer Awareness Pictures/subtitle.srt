1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:14,949
What is up guys? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary, but before I get

2
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:18,690
into that, I want to talk about the breast cancer awareness pictures that

3
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,579
you're about to see. Thank you every single person that wanted to participate,

4
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:28,940
that did participate. You guys supported an amazing cause. Thank you so much guys.

5
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,390
I was so happy that I filled the server a couple of times. About 50 or 60 people

6
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,149
were involved, so thank you so much. Here are the pictures. They came out great.

7
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,310
Everybody with a pink hat or a pink miscellaneous item painted. I heard a lot

8
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,149
of stories from you guys about how you're having family members deal with

9
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,549
breast cancer or you've had to deal with family members with breast cancer. And

10
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:54,179
it's tough. It's tricky for a lot of you guys and I appreciate the fact that

11
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,340
everyone came to that server and we all supported it. Everybody that's supporting

12
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,340
this whole thing, you guys are all awesome. Thank you. All I can say is thanks.

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,010
And you're supporting a great cause. So here is the gameplay. A lot of you guys

14
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:13,719
know that the Team Fortress 2 game engine is destroyed right now. So you

15
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,079
can't even play. I personally can't play Team Fortress for more than 10 minutes

16
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:23,480
without crashing to my desktop. So I am going to play Orcs Must Die which is a

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,959
new strategy tower defense hybrid game. Hope you guys enjoy it and hopefully

18
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:36,400
they fix Team Fortress 2 soon so we can all play again. Okay so here we are in

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,560
Orcs Must Die and I gotta tell you guys this is one of the best games I've

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,480
played this year. Haven't played a whole lot of games this year but this is

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,480
definitely topping the charts for me. If you are unfamiliar this game is a

22
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,519
hybrid of tower defense and strategy elements in the game. It's amazing. It's

23
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,239
really really great. So if you're one of those guys like me that grew up playing

24
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:03,159
Warcraft 3 and playing tower defense on Warcraft 3, you are going to absolutely

25
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:09,219
love this game. It is amazing to a million degrees. So basically what you

26
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:14,060
want to do, I only just started playing this game yesterday, so basically what

27
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:21,039
you want to do is you want to defend this thing over here. It is a little rift

28
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,800
area thing and you got this guy here that can protect it with you. But this

29
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,080
thing right here has to be protected and these doors over here if you look at the

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,800
top right of the screen, this door is going to open and this door down here is

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,360
going to open as well. What's going to happen is orcs, hundreds and hundreds of

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,039
orcs are going to pour out of those places and you have to defend them. You

33
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,150
have to kill them all or else they're going to take that over. So how do you do

34
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,500
this? One way is with your crossbow. You can shoot it like this. It has a couple

35
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,259
of little features too. You can do like a stun where it stuns them in place but

36
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,460
the cool part about this game and why it's sort of like tower defense is

37
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,539
because you have all these things you can put down. So I have started to

38
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:07,979
upgrade or I've already upgraded this poison spike trap and I use the super

39
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,460
boom barrel but I'm not going to use that right now because I'm going to use

40
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,139
the arrow walls but you can as you can see customization is really really

41
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:17,259
interesting in this game and look at how many spells you're gonna actually end up

42
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:20,580
getting. It's a whole lot of fun and yes you'll see what I'm gonna do here is

43
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,310
place a couple of spike traps over here. They're gonna come from this way too so

44
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,629
let's go over this way too. Bang, bang and this guy just got this guy. I don't know

45
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,180
what the hell he does. We're gonna put him right here though and we're gonna

46
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,500
put this guy rotate with R. Okay so as you see these guys are gonna shoot the

47
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,860
orcs that come down the hallway so let's unleash the horde and look at the top

48
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,060
right of the screen you can see where they're coming from. They're coming from

49
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,099
right here so let's get them. The cool part about this game guys is you can

50
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,419
string together combos and headshots and stuff like that. It is a very very fun

51
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,379
game. I gotta tell you right now like I said before it's one of the funner games

52
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,740
I've ever played and I've played a lot of games like this and this one is one

53
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,520
of the ones that takes the cake. It's awesome. Oh my god stun him. These

54
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,599
orcs are actually pretty sick. Oh they can get killed. I did not know that. I did

55
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:19,879
not know that. So yeah that's the first wave so as you'll know if you play tower

56
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,000
defense before you have multiple waves to deal with and you have a few

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,920
seconds between each wave so let's uh oh god put a couple more spike traps here.

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:37,540
Oh boy gotta go gotta go gotta go. Oh my god. Oh you know I'm gonna I need those

59
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,579
archers are sick. I need more of those archers. Oh boy this is not looking good

60
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:47,290
right now. I'm being really inaccurate. See if you look at the crosshair the

61
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,970
crosshair oh god stun him. The crosshair will shrink. It's kind of like in if you

62
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,769
know Team Fortress but oh they're killing my archers. In Team Fortress when

63
00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:00,290
you are shooting the gun like with the ambassador let's just say for instance

64
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,050
if you have the ambassador. It's very very accurate on the first shot and you

65
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:10,050
see I'm collecting headshots right here. Bang bang bang bang bang bang me a bunch

66
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,769
of headshots baby. So it's kind of you get more inaccurate the more you shoot

67
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:19,810
and that's it for that wave. I gotta put some more archers down and the money is

68
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,879
in the lower right. So these cost 600. I'm gonna you know let's do this. They're

69
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,759
probably gonna come from the other side. Let's do this. You can't get my

70
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,439
impenetrable. Oh yeah they're coming to the other side. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna

71
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,800
have my archers shoot that way and I'm gonna shoot these guys coming around

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,209
here. See if that works out. Oh god the little freaks they run fast. Alright cool

73
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:46,680
cool. Stop where you're going right now brother. So there's a whole lot of

74
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,920
strategy and you can play this game a million different ways. I am selecting my

75
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,040
way I'm doing my own thing but you can do your own thing. There's endless

76
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,360
possibilities guys. It is a whole lot of fun. Highly suggest you pick this game

77
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:06,120
up. It is only 15 bucks. So yeah that is completely and totally worth it. So now I

78
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,279
have a break. I have a couple levels left to do. Let me pull out my you know what

79
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,879
I'm gonna keep this going. Let's keep these archers here. Let's do a ton of

80
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:22,800
archers. Oh baby. You think you're gonna get by this? I got my crew with me. My

81
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,060
crew are mad archers. Oh let's do it. Unleash the horde. Where they coming from?

82
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,379
Yeah I'll go I'll go this way again and they'll take out that other side. Oh let me

83
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:41,660
bang some headshots. Oh boy. Nice. Nice. How they doing? Okay they're doing

84
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,620
alright. They're doing alright. I better go over there and assist. No I don't

85
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,139
they don't even need me. They don't even need me. Okay yeah I might need some help

86
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:56,899
over here though. Unfortunately guys there is no co-op in this game. I really

87
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:01,420
wish there was. I really do. Because this would be so much fun with two or three

88
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,220
people. Oh my god. I'll be alright. I'll be alright. Come on let me let me just bang

89
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,089
some headshots on you guys. You can also pull out your staff or your sword

90
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:16,209
whatever it is. I don't have it equipped because I don't really use it to be

91
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:21,199
honest. And look at that. These archers. Oh they don't even stand a chance. So now

92
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,399
I'll put one more there and I'm gonna come over here and let's put a couple

93
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:34,100
this way because I'm gonna get smoked if I don't. Very cool. Let's do it. They got

94
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,420
it. They got that. They got it. I don't even have to go over there. They got that

95
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:41,980
covered. Wow this is awesome. So you're seeing I'm using the archers. I'm gonna

96
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,759
be using them a whole lot more. How's this side looking? Look that's alright. I

97
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:54,379
look good. Looking good. Freeze baby. And the more points you get after you kill a

98
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,459
group. Let's say see on the left there I just got a hundred points for stringing

99
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:01,339
together some kills. You spend those points you get skills and you can

100
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:06,379
upgrade your abilities which gives it like RPG feel to it. Oh it's just it's

101
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:11,490
fantastic guys. I gotta tell you it is fantastic. And here comes the final wave.

102
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:18,610
Let's go with a couple more archers over here just because I can. And let's do it.

103
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:24,870
I'm ready for you. They're coming on both sides. Little freak shows. Don't stand a

104
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,930
chance baby. They're good. Are they good over there? Let me shoot a long-range

105
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:38,059
stun. Oh boy. See some people just shoot violently like I like to be a little bit

106
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,419
more precise with it. Try and get some headshots. Get a few extra points. You

107
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:47,639
guys know the deal. Oh come on now. Oh what's that three in a row? Let me get a

108
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:53,340
three piece. Let me get a throw. Shoot. Oh this is looking kind of. No they're good.

109
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:00,230
They're good. We're good. It is game over. They got they got nothing. So I'll show

110
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,110
you the ending screen. He does a funny little dance. It's actually it's pretty

111
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:10,029
awesome. And here we go. Here's the dance. So yeah if you have not bought this game

112
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:14,629
already go buy it right now. It's on Steam. It is incredible. So I'll see you

113
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:18,330
guys all next time. Actually no let me let me show you this first. Got my point

114
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:24,809
see buy upgrades. See I have six skulls after doing a bunch of things. Oh this is

115
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:29,460
14 to upgrade and this makes it cheaper. It makes archers cheaper because they're

116
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,940
kind of expensive. But you get the deal and this eventually is gonna fill with

117
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,620
abilities and the replayability is just amazing. So yeah I hope you guys enjoyed

118
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,779
this and maybe I'll do more of this this series. Maybe I'll do more of this

119
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,179
because it's a very very interesting game. So I'll see you guys all next time

120
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:48,899
and take care everybody.
