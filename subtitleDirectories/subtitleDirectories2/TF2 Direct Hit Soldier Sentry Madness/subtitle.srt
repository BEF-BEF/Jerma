00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:06,339
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:11,740
Friday before Christmas. Christmas Eve is tomorrow. I can't wait. I love Christmas time, guys.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:19,539
And you guys should all be excited as well because the giveaway is tomorrow at 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

4
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:23,920
Good luck to everybody, and if you have no idea what I'm talking about,

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,719
there's gonna be a link in the description. Go enter that contest. You have until tomorrow morning to do it.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,119
And because we are talking about Christmas and Christmas Eve, on Sunday, Christmas Day,

7
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:41,020
there will be a Grandpa episode. A very special Christmas Grandpa episode.

8
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:48,600
So stay tuned to Machinima Respawn for that. Sunday at 4 p.m. Pacific Time. Check your local listings.

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,070
So what are we doing right now? This is a direct hit soldier on Hoodoo, Payload Hoodoo.

10
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,869
I've gotten a couple of requests from the same person over and over again to do this.

11
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:04,170
So hey, I'm finally gonna do it for you. The guy that's been asking for like two months.

12
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,849
I'm gonna give you your direct hit gameplay. Here it is.

13
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:16,079
Sorry it took so long. So the loadout is gonna be the direct hit, the shotgun, the strain shotgun, and the equalizer.

14
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,280
I do a lot of work, and the title of this video is something that's gonna be like Century Madness

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,480
because they have like five or six engineers with a ton of century guns,

16
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,480
and I take out so many centuries with this thing, it's insane.

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,379
And that brings up a great point. This rocket launcher, thanks for the Uber by the way,

18
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:42,579
this rocket launcher can take out a level three century in two rockets. That's it.

19
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:45,980
You don't have to shoot it five times, you just have to land two rockets,

20
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,750
and it takes about one and a half seconds to drop a level three century.

21
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,049
This is obviously if the engineer is not right there repairing it like this one is right now,

22
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:03,450
but regardless, it can be a lot to have to handle if you are not standing right next to your century gun.

23
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,750
You will lose it in one second. You have to use the element of surprise, I guess,

24
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,449
when using the direct hit going after a century.

25
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:17,349
It is especially important in not a situation like this where there are a million people, a million century guns,

26
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:21,849
but in a typical situation, the other team will have maybe one or two engineers,

27
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:25,849
and they'll be going back and forth, grabbing stuff, turning around, whacking the century.

28
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:30,150
So if you time it right, if you can sit there and observe an engineer doing something,

29
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,889
you can take out the century within a split second of him turning around.

30
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:39,389
Get Ubercharged here, take out the century in two shots, and the engineer, go after the dispenser as well,

31
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:43,189
and if you were paying attention, I killed this is number five right here.

32
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:47,189
That's five centuries that have gone down in the last 30 seconds.

33
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:50,370
So if you can see what I'm talking about, it's pretty ridiculous.

34
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,669
Somebody else killed the fifth one. I think I had four right there,

35
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:56,169
because there was one over on the left side that somebody took out.

36
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:59,870
But regardless, I die right here, yoink, crit rocket in my face.

37
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,509
Let's skip the respawn time, because nobody wants to watch that.

38
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:07,909
So if you are looking for direct hit tips, I can't really give them to you.

39
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:12,280
I can maybe give you one, but the reason for that is because I don't really use it that often.

40
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,020
I use this and the cow mangler pretty much the same amount of time.

41
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,219
They're my bottom two rocket launchers.

42
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:22,020
So I can't really give you a whole lot of crazy things.

43
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,319
That being said, I can tell you one of the biggest tips I can give you,

44
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,400
make sure you always have at least two rockets in this clip before you go after somebody.

45
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
You will miss a lot with this thing.

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,500
And as you'll see here, I actually get ubercharged in a second,

47
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,340
and I miss this heavy like seven times in a row.

48
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,139
And the reason why it happens is because I keep reloading once, shooting it, reloading once, shooting it.

49
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,939
That doesn't work with the direct hit.

50
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:50,939
You have to really be precise. You have to know when to shoot.

51
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,210
You can't just blow around like a regular rocket launcher. It doesn't work that way.

52
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,580
Another tip I can give you is aim low.

53
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,580
I found this to be very, very true because if you aim too high with this rocket launcher,

54
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,879
you are going to go right by everybody's heads and you're not going to hit anybody behind anyone.

55
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,120
You want to try and go right for the gut, right for the breadbasket, right in the middle of the stomach.

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,699
Don't shoot too low. Don't go for their feet or their shins because it might just blow up in front of them.

57
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:24,199
But the reason why you do it is you're going to prevent yourself from shooting rockets into the skybox.

58
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,199
I can't tell you how many times I've shot this rocket launcher,

59
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,329
and it goes whizzing by everybody into a wall or into the sky.

60
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,730
Another tip, this is the last one I can give you right there.

61
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,329
If somebody gets too close, have your shotgun ready to go

62
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:43,410
because it's actually pretty difficult to land a direct hit shot somebody right in front of you.

63
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,509
I don't know, maybe that's just me, but it's actually difficult for me to do that.

64
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:51,810
So I just whip my shotgun out if they get too close, put a couple of shots in their face and they are dealt with.

65
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,910
Now this part right here is the most ridiculous part of the entire gameplay.

66
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,410
I get ubercharged right here. I promise you, none of these people are bots.

67
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,879
None of them are bots.

68
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:04,980
If there were any bots, there were probably only one or two.

69
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,079
Nothing like the whole team. I don't know. I have no idea.

70
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,379
You'll see what happens.

71
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:10,879
Come around this left side here.

72
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,680
Engineer tries to build another sentry.

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,779
I take it out and I take out the dispenser.

74
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,180
Oh my God, a sniper!

75
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,980
Don't worry, got my shotgun.

76
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,579
Take him out, take out the dispenser and then watch.

77
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:23,180
I feel like I was a disguised spy.

78
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,779
I really felt like I had a disguise on.

79
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:26,379
I was like, what the hell is going on?

80
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:29,959
I'm literally behind the whole team and no one is acknowledging me.

81
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,160
Even if these people were bots, they would have turned around and acknowledged me when I shot them.

82
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,360
This is like, what is going on?

83
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,959
Eventually, they start to acknowledge I'm here because I think they see the cart is moving.

84
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:45,439
But look, even still, I'm still just sitting on the cart just going, okay, I'll just pick off random people.

85
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,339
And I kill a bunch of people.

86
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:50,240
I get this guy, get that guy, take out one more person, then I get killed.

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,910
And if you take a look at the timer, there's only 30 seconds left.

88
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,910
Here's my feeble attempt to get on the cart within five seconds.

89
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,610
Does not work out and we lose the game, unfortunately.

90
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,209
But that's gonna be it, guys.

91
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:06,509
Have a very, very Merry Christmas if you happen to celebrate it.

92
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:08,410
Have a fantastic weekend, everybody.

93
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,209
I will see you all next time.

94
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:12,310
Take care, everybody.

95
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,709
And good luck on the contest!
