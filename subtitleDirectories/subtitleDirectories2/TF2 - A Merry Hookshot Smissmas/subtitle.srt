1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:20,809
Some foundry with... there's a briefcase here? What the fuck is going on there? They added

2
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:29,449
hookshots to the game? They added hookshots? This is a fucking Legend of Zelda now? How do I get one?

3
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,859
Where do I get one? Where do I get one? How do I... is it Q? It's gotta be Q.

4
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:45,140
It's not Q. So this item... all right, let's do... let's start hookshot. So this is just capture the

5
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:55,539
flag. Oh, watch out for this guy. So this is... this sticky new sticky launcher is all about

6
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:03,719
the quick detonations, huh? It max charges faster. This is like a combination of a lot of different

7
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,090
items because I can do stuff like this. What I meant to say was... what I meant to say was just

8
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,629
bottle this guy. That's what I meant to say. Now you know we're gonna get a hookshot.

9
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,390
He didn't even know what had happened. This guy didn't even know. That guy knew behind me,

10
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:27,189
but the scout in front of me doesn't. What is this? Give me this! Ooh, I got precision power-up.

11
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:34,540
What does that mean? Precision power-up? Do I have... holy shit, do you see how far that goes?

12
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:47,299
Oh my god, dude. I could like snipe... oh, you ruined it! Why am I walking around when that's in the

13
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:53,930
game? Why am I not going all over the place with that? How far does it go? Can I go all the way up

14
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:02,659
there? You've got to be shitting me right now. And these places are no longer... get up there!

15
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:12,789
No, don't fall! This guy... come here! He's gonna blow up from that one. Give me the Batman!

16
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:18,969
I got the vampire power-up. So I'm assuming I heal off of hits or something, right?

17
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:26,900
That's interesting. I'm gonna go be Batman. Be a bird of prey! I'm gonna just snipe people with

18
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:35,719
this thing. Oh my god, are you serious? I get to stay up here? This guy's not even gonna know

19
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:39,110
where I'm hitting him from. Lookit, he's just like... oh, he's hookshotting me. He's like,

20
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,229
what the fuck's happening? Where am I? You think you can hookshot away from me?

21
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:56,460
I'll hookshot to you! Hookshot heavy is crazy, man! Oh, what? Hookshot spy is even crazier.

22
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:04,870
Invisible hookshot. This guy's toast. That is ridiculous. You can't see me!

23
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:11,719
Where did I go? I was invisible the whole time, you see.

24
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:26,250
Again. Let's see if I can stay. No, actually, I guess I have to stay. That is so messed up.

25
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,479
You can just do that all over the place. And you can be invisible! It's like, really?

26
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:45,620
I have four crits right now. I gotta make use of this. Get back there. I see the mini-sentry.

27
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:53,159
I see you. I don't even need to disguise. Why would I disguise when I can just hookshot around?

28
00:03:53,159 --> 00:04:01,800
Like, what's the point of disguising? Let's see if I can... I do have crits. Oh,

29
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:10,550
the warlock. Give me the warlock. I'll wait for him. Let's see. Ready? Ready? Ready? Ready?

30
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:20,540
Okay, if I can get him when he comes up. Oh, it worked. It worked. Sort of. Sort of. No,

31
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:29,019
I don't want to give up. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. If I just had only swung

32
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:37,379
a second earlier. Get me out of here. Oh my god. I'm freaking out right now. All right,

33
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:40,980
put a disguise on for the first time in the entire time you've been playing spy. Put

34
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:48,490
a enemy disguise on. Okay, good. Look, I'm just a demo man. Hi. I'm a demo man using my rocket

35
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:57,079
hookshot thing. Cool, huh? Oh, what? How did he know? This must be super speed.

36
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:08,199
Hookshot this way. Oh, come on. Oh, what? I should have hookshotted up there. I'm stupid.

37
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:16,740
Is this their spawn? But they're protected though, right? We can't like immediately insta kill them.

38
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:29,129
No, we can't. Whoa. I'm gonna try to hookshot kill this guy. I'm gonna go for a hookshot kill

39
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:48,139
on this guy. Where is he? Dammit. What the fuck is going on? Let's make this happen. One, two, three,

40
00:05:48,139 --> 00:06:02,569
four. No, don't let him get away. So this quick fix medic. I wonder if he's going to follow me

41
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:17,139
all the way up here. Let's go. Hey, I seem to be levitating this medic. Come with me. Let's go.

42
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,970
We got places to go. Let's go this way now. Come with me. Let's fly. No.
