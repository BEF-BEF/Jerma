00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:21,339
Ah, welcome to Jerma's Waterpark. Everything is so wonderful here. We got jacuzzis, we got lounging chairs, we got cool slides, whoa, yeah!

2
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:30,280
But the main attraction of Jerma's Waterpark is the thing that's over here. And this is the reason why I made this video.

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:40,189
Here's a high dive. Not only is this a high dive, it's a definite, like, death. If you come up here and you jump off this thing, I don't know how you're gonna survive this.

4
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:47,189
I don't see a feasible way to survive this. I don't see how you could ever live, but we're gonna try to get someone to do it anyways and see what happens.

5
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:48,189
The high dive!

6
00:00:49,189 --> 00:01:01,590
I spent all this time making this and all the time waiting. I don't think anybody's gonna do this. I think I just wasted, like, two hours of my time.

7
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,659
Would you do it? I would never do this. No one would do this. Except for this guy. Except for this guy.

8
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:13,900
Please be the only brainless motherfucker in here that's gonna do this. He's doing it! He's doing it! Follow him down.

9
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:26,579
Oh! He's gonna crash into people! Is he alive? Did he make it into the pool? He made it in the pool! It's safe! It works!

10
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,310
Come on, let's go.

11
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:40,269
Tempt number two. I gotta get a good view of this. This is too long sitting here waiting for this. Here we go. Let's see what he does.

12
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:52,579
See ya! Oh god! Yay! Ta-da!

13
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,879
Anybody else? Anybody else?

14
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:03,989
Pause it. See, he is about to jump off this high dive right now and he thinks he's going in the pool.

15
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:08,300
Well, what we're gonna do is we're going to replace...

16
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:16,659
Let's replace part of this pool that he's about to dive into with, you know, just like that. Let's just see what happens.

17
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:19,800
Let's see what happens to this guy.

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,370
Time to unpause.

19
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,080
Yoink! There he goes!

20
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:39,370
What?! It's this kid right there! Are you serious?

21
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:47,150
You're completely fine after that? Where'd he go? He's fine!

22
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:56,860
All he has to say is, I'm hungry coming through. Beach Hut was really good value. I'm not that hungry right now.

23
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:07,099
You just jumped off of a 5,000 foot platform into the ground and you got right, what are you, fucking Spider-Man or Superman? What the hell?
