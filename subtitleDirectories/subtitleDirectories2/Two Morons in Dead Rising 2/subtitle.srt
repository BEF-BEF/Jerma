1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,019
Is it really appropriate that we're both naked men?

2
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:19,019
Yes it is. It is appropriate.

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,019
Nah, you ain't taking that box. Put it back.

4
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:29,820
Come here, can I bash you in the face with this?

5
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:38,750
Oh shit!

6
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:45,750
Alright, explain what world does a box do more like knockback and damage than a fucking showerhead?

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:54,200
Dude, I'm gonna kill you!

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,780
No! Up!

9
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,049
Hey there!

10
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,049
Wait a minute, I can't even lift you up.

11
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:05,930
I need to get food!

12
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,930
I need to get like Cheetos to like rescue you!

13
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,930
No!

14
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,359
Where's the Cheetos?

15
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,359
Is there like any like dirty sodas anywhere around here?

16
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:21,260
We haven't gotten out of like the tutorial.

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,060
If you hadn't killed me with that cardboard box, we wouldn't be in this situation.

18
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,060
Oh wait, hold on, I'm coming. Hold on, don't worry.

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,819
I brought you some like potato chips.

20
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:38,819
This should heal all your wounds. A bag of fucking potato chips.

21
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:41,819
Oh, thanks, thanks.

22
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:44,819
I can't find anything.

23
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,819
You're gonna be there for a while. I'm in like the game right now.

24
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:51,959
Hold on, just hang tight.

25
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,959
So far my perspective of this game is like a concrete ground.

26
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,959
These cabinets over here look great.

27
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,959
Hold on, I'll find you something.

28
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,390
This cream.

29
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,389
There we go. I got you a large soda.

30
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:13,939
What if I can make it? Oh shit!

31
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:19,710
Get off me! I gotta bring my friend like a drink!

32
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,710
No shit, I just drank it!

33
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,169
Shit!

34
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:30,979
No!

35
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:32,979
I benched my...

36
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:37,569
Oh shit!

37
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:43,479
Hold on, strong attack was what?

38
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,580
I just saw strong attack.

39
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,580
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

40
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,580
Did I seriously just almost kill you again?

41
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,580
No, dude. No, no, we're not gonna do this again.

42
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,580
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just go, just go, just go.

43
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,580
We're gonna cause way too many problems here.

44
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,580
I can't believe I almost just killed you.

45
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,740
I'm gonna throw this at you.

46
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,740
Yeah, come on, come on. Come fuck around.

47
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,050
Yeah, nice toss. Nice toss.

48
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,050
It actually pains me.

49
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,310
I can't believe I'm gonna make you like the Incredible Hulk.

50
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,409
Don't kill me, don't kill me.

51
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:35,099
We've had enough. I have a propane tank.

52
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,830
Oh, you have a propane tank, huh? Is that what you have?

53
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,150
Why can't we stop this?

54
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,030
No, if I go die, we're gonna have to do this all over again.

55
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,030
It's all up to me. Go get the drink.

56
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,030
It's all up to you. Just go get a drink.

57
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,030
And it's all up to me, he says.

58
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,030
He's all up to me and then he dies.

59
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,719
I didn't even get out the door.

60
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,719
You didn't even get out the fucking door.

61
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,719
Please stop killing each other.

62
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:14,650
No, no. When you give people this type of freedom with this amount of items,

63
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,149
there's no way you're gonna get out the front door.

64
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,149
Grab a bunch of stuff.

65
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:25,149
All the food's in here, like orange juice and shit.

66
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:27,519
Oh, you wanna have a little breakfast party?

67
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,519
Mustard.

68
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:35,560
Let's go, let's go. I got enough water for the both of us.

69
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Hey, do you think we can get any computer games you can play out here?

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Move.

71
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Dude, oh.

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Move, I want this milk or whatever.

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Oh, you want this? Yeah, okay, thanks, I'll take it.

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,800
Careful!

75
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,800
No, I want, can we just please, can we just please play Team Fortress 2 on the computer?

76
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Can I get the damn milk?

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Hold on, I don't wanna play, look at this.

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Okay, here we go.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Do-do-do-do-do, boom, boom, boom.

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,800
I got a more headshot, I got a, I'm the best.

81
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,990
Get me out of this room.

82
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,990
I don't think we can keep this person alive.

83
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,990
You don't think we can?

84
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,990
I won't bet money on it.

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,990
Okay, well.

86
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,990
Because we're not gonna, we're gonna get distracted by something.

87
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,509
Well, just try, I want the extra points.

88
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,899
I want like the double points.

89
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:26,899
I want the triple points.

90
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:27,899
Let's go then.

91
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,899
She is being surrounded right now, do you not see this?

92
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,040
And then all my stuff's broken.

93
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
And someone's biting my penis.

94
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Uh, maybe not.

95
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,259
Maybe not.

96
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:45,259
I'll just wait over here.

97
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:47,259
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, there's more people in here.

98
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:48,259
They're having like a reunion.

99
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,259
They're like hugging each other and stuff and there's zombies everywhere.

100
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,259
What the hell are they doing?

101
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:58,259
Dude, you don't like, you don't hug it out during a zombie apocalypse in like a room full of 30 zombies.

102
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,939
Let's go.

103
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:01,939
We don't have time.

104
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:04,629
Let's go, Gordon.

105
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:05,629
Come on, Gordon.

106
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:08,319
Come on, Gordy.

107
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,319
What the hell are they doing?

108
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,319
Oh, shit.

109
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,319
What?

110
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,319
That's not what I thought I was equipping.

111
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,319
What do you mean?

112
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,459
Aren't you so pretty.

113
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:25,459
They look like, I don't know, just like plaid shirts.

114
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:29,459
Well, can you stop like trying on like women's clothing and come like fight these guys?

115
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:30,459
These people are dying.

116
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,459
I gotta take care of them.

117
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,459
Oh, my God.

118
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,410
We got two people dying.

119
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,410
I'm fighting off a zombie apocalypse and you're trying on women's clothing.

120
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,410
I have the only loaded gun.

121
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,970
Yeah, you're the only person with a gun.

122
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,100
Thanks for the help.

123
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Oh, shit.

124
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:57,759
Don't worry, I got you.

125
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,759
Well, Lashandra's almost dead.

126
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,759
Can we just go?

127
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,759
I would really appreciate that if you would get over here.

128
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,759
I don't have any weapons left.

129
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,759
And Lashandra takes a wild swing at my face and kills me.

130
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,759
Dude, what the hell was the point of that?

131
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,759
Will you quit trying on shoes and get over here?
