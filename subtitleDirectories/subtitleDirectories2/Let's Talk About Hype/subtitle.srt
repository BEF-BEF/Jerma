00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:11,050
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Fistful of Frags on a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:16,070
I screwed that one up. It's actually a gameplay commentary on Fistful of Frags.

3
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:21,190
I screw I went backwards on it. I haven't had my coffee this morning. So forgive me. But hi, how are you guys?

4
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:27,589
Welcome to this video. It's been a little while since I made a just talking to the microphone video like you're watching right now.

5
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,829
Where I just discuss something that's on my mind or something that's sort of relevant to

6
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,670
The gaming world or even just my life in general. This is just gonna be kind of an update one of those update-y

7
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:43,750
I ramble and rant for like five to ten minutes and that's it. So Fistful of Frags in the background

8
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,070
This is my game of the year for 2014

9
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,429
If you were curious at what my game of the years are for 2014

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,789
We're gonna get those out of the way because I haven't really talked about it

11
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:57,030
I talked about it like once in star stream a week or so ago, but here you go

12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,100
Here are my games of the year for 2014 in no particular order

13
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:08,819
Okay, Fistful of Frags, Finding of Isaac Rebirth, Shadow of Mordor, Smite, and Lethal League.

14
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,439
So there you go. Those are my top five games that came out in 2014 and technically Fistful of Frags

15
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:21,670
Was a mod from a long time ago, but it released on steam in 2014

16
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:24,390
So if you don't want to count Fistful of Frags

17
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:31,510
Then it's Tactical Intervention again because Tactical Intervention is game of the year every fucking year no matter what year it is

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,069
Okay, so just you can replace that wherever you want and now that that's out of the way

19
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,310
We're gonna actually talk about

20
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,189
One of them in particular the one that you're watching right now Fistful of Frags

21
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:50,219
and how I really wish there were more games like this because I'm just I I need fresh ideas

22
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,150
And I'm not saying that as like oh, I'm so smart. I'm so intelligent

23
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:00,069
I need something that can fill my brain with all kinds of wonderful knowledge. No, no, it's I need something. That's just interesting

24
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:06,810
If something doesn't interest me, I can't do it. I can't play it the same thing with this youtube channel guys

25
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:12,229
If something doesn't interest me enough to make a video, I'm not gonna make a video

26
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:18,949
I'm not gonna press a button to record and force myself to upload a video because I have to be interested in something

27
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:19,990
It has to be something that I go

28
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,300
You know what? Okay that I want to do that and if you take a look at some of the recent first-person shooters

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,520
That you know when I say recent I mean the last 10 years or five years. That's not recent at all

30
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:37,909
Sorry, if you take a look at the most recent first-person shooters in the last fucking decade, that's a stupid thing to say

31
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:43,770
But in my recent memory of gaming I gravitate towards games that have interesting ideas

32
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:49,590
Strange stuff crazy weird mechanics style. I don't like to play

33
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:57,400
The kind of run-of-the-mill shooters i'm not saying they're bad games. I just have trouble. I have such attention deficit hyperactivity disorder guys

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:04,250
I have adhd if I don't immediately like get hold on a second. There's a squirrel at my window

35
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,439
If I don't get locked into something within the first hour or so of playing the game

36
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,360
I'm not really going to put that much time into it. It has to be pretty colors

37
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,580
It has to be interesting gameplay. It's got to be something to make my brain click and that doesn't happen that frequently

38
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,479
And that's my transition to talking about overwatch

39
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:37,509
Overwatch is the new blizzard game that's coming out in the next

40
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:42,069
Maybe within the next year or so there'll be a beta. I think eventually coming up here soon

41
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:44,020
I don't know

42
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,180
I don't want to get so hyped up about overwatch for one very specific reason

43
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:53,930
It might not be that fun. I'm not going to say it isn't going to be fun

44
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,330
I'm just saying that there's a possibility

45
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,530
With the track record of the last five years or so from all these triple a companies releasing games

46
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,770
And a lot of them being not that great

47
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,139
I don't I just don't want to get hyped up about a game anymore

48
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,719
Now this is not a shot at blizzard because this game might be fantastic overwatch might be a fantastic game

49
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,959
Which I will dump a ton of time into but I just don't know that yet

50
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,360
And I really wish the overwatch team the absolute best of luck

51
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,240
And I hope you guys come up with something great

52
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,560
I hope it's interesting and I hope it's really fun because I really want to enjoy it

53
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,699
and hopefully the name of the game is still overwatch by the time you're watching this video because

54
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,100
They just got like a trademark problem

55
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,819
So the game the name of the game could be like fusion core

56
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,379
All right

57
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,629
So when fusion core comes out in whatever beta it's going to come out in

58
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:47,850
I'll take a look at it and we'll talk again there

59
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:54,439
But I need to be very very careful and I can't stress this enough at how careful I need to be

60
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,399
When overwatch comes into beta because beta means it's a beta

61
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,480
And the same exact scenario I do not want to have play out

62
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:11,180
What happened to me when I played smite one of my other 2014 games of the year when smite was in very very early closed beta

63
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,920
I played a shitload of it. I was so into it. I was making videos on it

64
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,680
It was I go this game is so much fun

65
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,439
This is such an awesome game

66
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,680
But it was so early in the game's development and it wasn't even close to being ready yet

67
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,759
There was a lot of unbalanced gods

68
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,600
There was a lot of broken stuff in the game and it was frustrating and I really burnt myself out

69
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,279
In that year or so that I put into that closed beta because it was such a fun idea

70
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:41,980
It was such a great fun concept and it wasn't done

71
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,540
It just wasn't done and I put all my energy into it when it wasn't done

72
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,939
So I don't want to do the same thing with overwatch. I'm looking into a crystal ball right now

73
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:55,899
And i'm seeing the same scenario play out. It's a game that looks really fun

74
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:57,899
Really interesting

75
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,779
And i'm gonna put time into it when it's not done

76
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,220
So I again want to stress to myself and to you guys out there

77
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:07,910
When you're playing a new game that you're hyped up for and this is like hype in general

78
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,730
Just let it play out a little bit

79
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,930
Don't just dump all your eggs in one basket and like and spend a huge amount of time in something

80
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,180
Knowing that when you're done putting all the time into it

81
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:26,259
You might not care anymore when it's actually a finished product and potentially a way better product

82
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,819
Than the one that you put all the time in two years ago

83
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,259
So that's gonna wrap up this video guys. That's all I really wanted to say

84
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,939
Um the wrap one more thing my book i'm still working on the book books are hard. Uh, don't expect it's gonna suck

85
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,410
um and

86
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,569
Eat your vegetables because there's all kinds of calcium and there's all kinds

87
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:47,610
You know, there's vitamin k in that broccoli there. There's vitamin k in that broccoli

88
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,569
You want to eat that broccoli?

89
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:54,170
Make sure you're taking a little bit of protein too because protein is the building block of all cells and that's it

90
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,779
That's the end of the video
