00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,589
So I just recently beat Firewatch, and I came across a feature that I haven't really seen

2
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:14,650
very many people talk about. There's a disposable camera in this game that allows you to take

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,820
pictures. You can take a picture of whatever you want. It never leaves your inventory,

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,379
and you have it throughout the whole game. But the cool feature is they actually ask you if you want

5
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:30,410
to develop those photos, and they will mail them to you. And that's exactly what I did. They got

6
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,770
here today, and I kind of want to just go through them with you guys, like I thought it'd be a really

7
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:40,600
neat idea to look at them together and see what I took pictures of. Now, it has been a while,

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,759
so I don't actually know or remember what's on these. Hey, your memories have arrived, huh?

9
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:53,350
That's real cute. Photo dome. Look at that. Okay, let's open them up. Let's see what we got.

10
00:00:54,549 --> 00:01:08,099
First one is the sky. Skies can be cool sometimes, I guess. That's a rock. A pretty interesting

11
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:14,540
growth of a rock. The way that it was growing out of the ground was pretty cool. I think that's the

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:26,019
inside of a bush. Yeah, that's the inside of a bush. I think I was trying to take a picture of a...

13
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:42,620
These are fucking terrible. Seriously. What? Did I take these? What even is this? Is that a thumb

14
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:48,469
print? Oh, there we go. There's a little selfie there, you know, selfie action. Sometimes you

15
00:01:48,469 --> 00:02:00,790
gotta take one. Okay, that's a private one. That's gonna go in a different pile. It's gonna go in

16
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:08,599
the privacy pile. Hey, a fence. Take a look at that. Interesting, right? It's a... What am I even

17
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:16,250
taking a picture of here? Hey, here you go. I got a picture of the toilet, you know. Oh, this one's

18
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,610
great. I like this one. This one's like, there was a rock on a stump, and I thought like, whoa, that's

19
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,090
such an interesting rock. Like, that's so odd. Why would there be a rock on a stump like that?

20
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:37,879
Uh, I don't know why. There is a box up there, I guess. Ooh, here we go. Here we go. I remember

21
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,520
this tree. I remember saying to myself, man, it's got such interesting moss growing on the side. I

22
00:02:42,520 --> 00:03:00,710
gotta get a picture with it. So there you go. There it is. Privacy pile. Damn it. What the fuck?

23
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:16,009
Who am I? I don't know who the fuck this is. I have no idea. I've never met this person before

24
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:27,030
in my entire life. Another rock. Good one. Oh, look, another rock. Oh, cool. And it's a sunset

25
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,990
that you could have taken a picture of too. Oh, good rock in the way. Come on. Come on. You know

26
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:51,300
what? I apologize for this. Oh, my God. That's somebody's asshole. I hope it's not mine. No,

27
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:58,060
that's mine. That's mine. Do something cool. Oh, look at that. I did something cool, guys.

28
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:12,460
Hey, Ma. Don't look in the trash.
