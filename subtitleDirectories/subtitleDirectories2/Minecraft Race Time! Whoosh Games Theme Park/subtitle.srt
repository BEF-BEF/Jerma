1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,259
What is going on here? I just gave myself two redstone torches.

2
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:21,530
What is this like dog? What? There's a dog just like sitting in this room right here.

3
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:29,289
Information kiosk. Oh I know what I can do. It's a dog. Hello doggy. Hello little doggy.

4
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:33,659
Who's your good boy? Oh no! I didn't mean to punch you. I was trying to pet you.

5
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:41,539
Is there a pet button in this game? Uh, no. Can I like pet him?

6
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:48,869
Now he's mad at me. I'm sorry dog. By the way, by the way, I saw somebody comment on your last video.

7
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:55,670
They said, Jerma, you know that there's an engineer skin for Minecraft, right? You should get a TF2 skin.

8
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,909
Well this is Gino from Mario RPG. It's like my favorite video game thing ever.

9
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:08,790
I love Gino. I don't even know why I'm a pirate to be perfectly honest. I have no idea.

10
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,790
I thought you were like a king. I am the king of pirates, of course.

11
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,790
Is it nighttime again? Let's fix that. Geez, man.

12
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:27,340
I wish I could just make it daytime like forever. Now you're welcome.

13
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,769
That's where the gold block goes whenever you find it. Okay. All right.

14
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:38,459
Are you ready? I think I'm ready to play Jungle Race. Game one. So we just go?

15
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,459
We're going to keep tally and see who wins when all this is said and done.

16
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:46,760
I am ready. Ready? So the whole point, we're going to get up to the top of that thing, right?

17
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:53,420
Are we going? Oh yeah. Obstacle course time. Oh, go. Over the slow sand.

18
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:00,219
Oh, this is slow sand. What the hell? Come on, come on, come on. Run, run, run, run, run, run.

19
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:04,900
Oh my God. I'm going to like puke. This is like pulsating.

20
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,400
They got up here. All right. We're on the bridge. No. Oh, I'm okay.

21
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,900
I'm okay. I'm all right. I'm good. I thought I fell down. I'm in the water pool. That's not where I want to be.

22
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,330
Swimming up to the surface. Oh, I see you. I see you. You're like right across from me.

23
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,330
Oh, I'm going to win. I am absolutely going to win.

24
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,330
I refuse to lose. I'm getting stuck on all the vines.

25
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,330
What's going on? Where am I? Oh, wait, the vines, right? Go, go, go, go, go.

26
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,330
The gold blocks are on the highest place of the jungle. Destroying leaves is cheating.

27
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,569
I don't even like know what this is.

28
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,569
Oh no. What is going on? The world is gone.

29
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,810
What? What? Oh, what do you know? Like half the

30
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,810
world is gone. Let me just climb up this tree. I'll be okay. Uh oh, I fell.

31
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,979
Okay. There's lots of handy ladders placed strategically

32
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:58,979
around these trees. All right. I see this platform. Probably supposed to go up there.

33
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,909
No, get out of the way. Up here, up here, up here, up here, up here. Come on, come on, come on, come on.

34
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:08,280
We're looking for the gold block, right? Yeah, there's like a

35
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,280
gold block somewhere around here. Ow. It's up here. Oh, there's a skeleton.

36
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,280
There's a skeleton on my side. Kill him. Punch him in his face.

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,280
Yeah, I'm not going to take time to punch him in his face when I could be trying to find the gold.

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,969
Oh, it's right there. It's right there. Oh my God. Go, jump. Oh, I got this in the bag.

39
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:28,969
I got this in the bag, I think. Wait, what? Are you already at the gold? Yeah,

40
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:33,659
I'm at the gold right now. Oh man. Here we go. Here we go.

41
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,960
Take only one gold block and put it in the Indian statue. All right.

42
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,389
I've already got the gold, son. I'm running out here. Wait, hold on. Where'd it go? Give me this.

43
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,340
Oh my God. Punch it again for another one. I got it. I got it. I'm good. Wait.

44
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,900
I don't know where to go. I don't know where to go. You gotta jump off the edge.

45
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Oh my God. There's a creeper. You gotta be kidding me. You gotta be kidding me. Get away from me.

46
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,830
Get away from me. Oh my God. Okay.

47
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,830
I'm winning this thing. I am winning this thing. I just almost had a legit heart attack right there.

48
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,830
The world is ending. Where do I go? You have like a

49
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:16,100
chuckle. All right, all right. Jerma has

50
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,420
forfeited. He has died. I lost. All right, so we're gonna make a creeper.

51
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,779
You had a creeper? A creeper came right behind me and it freaked me out and gave me a heart attack.

52
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:30,790
985 and I'm gonna send... Hang on. Is this teleporting you to me or me to you?

53
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:38,019
I guess we're about to find out. Hooray. I don't...

54
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:42,709
Are you there? I don't see you. I'm standing right here, yeah. Hello. Go.

55
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:46,949
Wait. Wait, what? There's a second part to the challenge.

56
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,500
Oh, I do. Wait. Yeah, there's part two. There's part two.

57
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,120
This is the maze. We have to like climb. We have to like figure out

58
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,420
how to get out of this maze. How come I'm in yours?

59
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,899
I'm in your part of the thing. No, it meets up in

60
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:10,089
the middle so we're both like racing against time. Hey, hey.

61
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:15,139
But get away from me. Hold on. I just went

62
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:20,180
back. I went back to the place where I started.

63
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,750
I'm just like wandering around here trying to find the way out. Oh, it's definitely this way.

64
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,750
Oh, how did you get out there? I didn't make it.

65
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,759
Oh. I'm still stuck in the forest.

66
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,259
I can't like find my way. You're stuck in the... Oh, I found you.

67
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,259
Oh, you're already climbing up there. Wow. There's so many like things in the way. I can't see where I am.

68
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,199
I'm like in the maze. Oh, you're not. I can see

69
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,720
climbing that thing. Oh, there's an arrow. Oh, this is bad.

70
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,720
I'm gonna fall off of this for sure. Yeah, you certainly are, sir.

71
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Are you already at the finish? Put the fire away.

72
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,329
Man, that was like the fastest scaling ever. How do I...

73
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:12,089
Do I just punch it? Did I win? Congratulations. Thank you for playing. I

74
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:17,209
won. I get a diamond pick. You win. And flint and

75
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:22,600
steel. You kind of won. You kind of like lost and

76
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,720
won. I absolutely lost the game.

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,579
I just failed pretty hardcore right there. I am bad

78
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:38,490
at jumping. Alright, so where are you? I'm still like failing at scaling this

79
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,500
wall with you so expertly like climbed up somehow.

80
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,459
I'm lighting the trees on fire. Is that bad?

81
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:53,459
Should I not be doing this? Is that gonna like ruin everything? I'm like

82
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:58,069
climbing up here just to see if I can. Just to see if I can...

83
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:02,250
Oh, you're over here. And I can't. I'm just a

84
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,259
complete failure. Oh, come on, Italics. I'm rooting for you. Oh, yeah, man.

85
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,939
Get out of here. No, my life.

86
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:18,470
I'm alive still. I don't know how, but I am. It's kind of dangerous.

87
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,779
Oh, God. Just a little dangerous. It's alright. We'll fight him off.

88
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:29,620
Yeah, I've got a gold sword. Fire. Burn.

89
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,750
Burn. Oh, I put you in the fire. Sorry.

90
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,750
Oh, it's okay. I forgive you. It's just a minor third degree burn.

91
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,250
So now we're gonna move on to... What's this one? Swedish Gladiators.

92
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,250
I think this one's gonna be pretty difficult though. Alright, that's

93
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,430
fine. I'm up for a challenge. I'm game. I'm game.

94
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,980
Two players needed. Obstacle race. So it's kind of like jungle race?

95
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:04,069
My specialty. Blue Gladiator is Notch.

96
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:08,250
Yellow Gladiator is Jeb. Reach the diamonds before your opponent.

97
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,870
If you fall in the water, you should start over. Okay. Sounds about

98
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,870
right. So do we have to push start or do we just go?

99
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:22,519
I think there's a start button. I think we just go. Is this pressure plate right here? Oh, no.

100
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:27,019
Okay. Step on pressure plate to make the game stop. And then I'm ready.

101
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:32,220
There's a button. You ready? I don't know, man. I'm getting kind of nervous. Getting those butterflies

102
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,220
right before an Olympic race. Oh, right before the meet. Here we go. This is it.

103
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:41,529
Are you ready? I'm ready. Do it. Do it. Go.

104
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:45,700
Running up the ladder. Here we go. Swedish Gladiators. Oh, yeah.

105
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Alright. Jumping across an S. Oh, wow. That was close.

106
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,139
I'm not risking that. Oh, well. How do I get over here? Oh.

107
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:58,700
I was going to wait and see how you did that. Oh, you did it. Now what do you do?

108
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:04,580
I'm going through some kind of crazy obstacle course. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

109
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,399
Okay. I get it. I get it. They're trying to push me off the edge now. They're trying to push me off. Oh, my

110
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:14,840
God. They pushed me off. I'm back on the track, but I'm at the beginning of it.

111
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,720
I'm already at that ladder. Alright. Alright. Hang on. Hang on.

112
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Next time we both fall, I'm going to like spawn in some more bread

113
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,850
because I'm losing some hunger here. Jump. Jump.

114
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,019
Oh, no. Don't jump. Just walk. I have a feeling this is going to be just like a series of fails.

115
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,019
Oh, man. No. I'll get it this time. I can see what it's trying to do.

116
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:42,019
The pistons. The pistons that push you off are where it really gets me.

117
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:46,389
I'm trying to see the pattern. My brain is too slow right now.

118
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:52,419
Alright. Here we go. Boom. Oh, I made it. I actually made it. Okay. I got it. I got it past the

119
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:56,419
Oh, you're already up there. Oh, no. Oh, my God. I don't know what to do here.

120
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:01,100
Is it right here? And then you jump? There's water. Oh, no.

121
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Oh, man. There I go again.

122
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,269
How did you see that pattern? I didn't. I like it. I got like

123
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:13,769
pushed off and it like didn't push me off and then I like glitched it out. I think.

124
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:18,009
I could be wrong. I might be really good. I'm probably not though.

125
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:23,000
Okay. There's water. I got it.

126
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, man. Okay. Don't get

127
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,990
trampled by the mine carts. How am I supposed to do this part? Don't

128
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,429
get trampled by the mine carts. Oh, here's another pattern. Great.

129
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:42,700
Go. Go. I don't know how to get through the second

130
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,700
set of pistons. You gotta just jump. I fell again. Oh, you gotta jump

131
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:52,220
and just glitch it out. That's the only way I got through. Water.

132
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,519
Water. No, no. Water slows you down. Whoa. It's pushing me off. Oh, okay.

133
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,580
Slow down. Slow down. All right. I'm back where I was.

134
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,950
Don't let the mine carts trample you. Okay. I won't.

135
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:12,519
Oh, man. No, don't go. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Go. Oh, it pushed me

136
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,519
off a man three times. You're gonna win this one. Oh, I hope so.

137
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:22,860
You've got the system down. You've got the system. Oh, my. Do you fall?

138
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,539
I did. All right. If I get knocked, I got back to this part again.

139
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:31,720
Come on now. Come on. I don't want to get hit by this piston.

140
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,370
Why'd I do that? Why'd I do that? Why'd I do that? Okay, I'm good. No.

141
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,370
See, it comes out the middle. Wow. This is just, this is gonna be a fail time right here. There it is.

142
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:47,129
Okay. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. Don't want to mess anything up.

143
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:51,500
Here. I'm almost at the end. You know what they should have? Oh, my God.

144
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,860
I'm not gonna screw this up. I'm not gonna screw this up. Not gonna

145
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:02,649
screw this up. All right. This one, I don't think I have to double jump for this one. I'm gonna

146
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:07,580
freak myself out. No, I didn't. Okay. All right. I'm gonna win it.

147
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:14,299
So, do you have to just tipsy-turvy on this thing or what? Oh, man. I don't know where you're at.

148
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:20,179
I'm sneaking. Is that gonna do anything at all? I have no idea.

149
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:24,860
Oh, for all the time it took. I completed it. Get some wool

150
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:30,549
and try to hit the basket to open the door? What? What do I have to do?

151
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:38,789
Oh, I have to throw it? Hey, Jerma. Oh, I'm trying.

152
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:44,870
Hey, Jerma. Yeah? Take a look around. Did you complete it?

153
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:50,950
You beat it before I did? Take a look around.

154
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,320
So, is this it? I'm dancing on diamonds right now, man.

155
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,120
You shut up, bitch. I can't believe it.

156
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,419
Look at this chunk error.

157
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:09,110
Is there anything after this? Because there's a chunk error right there. Yeah, there's like

158
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,480
the finish line is right here. So, the finish line is right there. Okay.

159
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,720
Make sure to right-click the button. Don't left-click it.

160
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:25,509
This didn't do anything. Oh, I just...

161
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:30,889
We are the champions of... You just

162
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:34,889
left me in the dust back here. You're like, ah, that's my button, son.

163
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:39,320
Apparently, there's a zombie doing it as well.

164
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,320
The obstacle. He's on my side. He's like doing it. Look at him. He's like, oh, I want to do it too.
