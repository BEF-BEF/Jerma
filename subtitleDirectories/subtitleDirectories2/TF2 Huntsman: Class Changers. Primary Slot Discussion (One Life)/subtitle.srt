00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,440
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight gonna be playing with the Huntsman Sniper.

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:29,920
Something I haven't done in a pretty long time. I think the last time I played Huntsman was when I was in North Carolina for helping my sister and being there for Thanksgiving.

3
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,920
So my goodness, that's been November, December, October. Oh my goodness, it's been a long time.

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,159
And I actually have a really interesting topic for this video, and it's something I want to talk about, something really cool I was thinking of.

5
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:48,159
And it has to do with, first I'll tell you the loadouts. Loadout's gonna be the Huntsman, the Jurati, and the Bushwhacker.

6
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,159
And I kind of feel naked with this setup, because I really like having the Darwin's Danger Shield.

7
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:58,399
And without it, I really do feel like I'm outside naked in my underwear in 20 degree weather.

8
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:05,900
I mean, but honestly though, I just like having that extra bit of security, that extra health to counteract enemy snipers.

9
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:14,900
If I get body shot, I probably won't die. And of course, if a stray rocket comes in and takes me down to 15 health, I'm not gonna die in that situation either.

10
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:22,900
But you're given your take though, because the Jurati is a fantastic item, and I use it once or twice here to get some assists, and to kill somebody with the Bushwhacker.

11
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,900
So it goes hand in hand. It doesn't matter what you put on, as long as you're putting something on.

12
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,900
Alluding to my naked argument I just made, two-set, whatever.

13
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:39,709
So this commentary is going to very, very, very, very much so focus on primary weapons like the Huntsman.

14
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:43,890
Now I don't mean all primary weapons, or the rocket launcher, or the syringe gun.

15
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,890
I'm talking about primary weapons that totally change the direction of a class.

16
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:59,140
I don't think there's any other item in the game, besides the Huntsman, that totally changes the default weapon that is supposed to be there.

17
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,310
Now that's the only way I can really describe this. It's the default weapon that is supposed to be there.

18
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:09,310
Let's take for instance a rocket launcher for the soldier. They have rocket launcher, rocket launcher, rocket launcher.

19
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,310
There's nothing else besides the rocket launcher for the primary slot.

20
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:20,550
The sniper differs in an amazing way, because of course he has three or four sniper rifles, but he also has this damn thing.

21
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:27,729
And I think it's so amazing when Valve takes some of these items and they create different subclasses with the primary weapons.

22
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:30,729
And I wish I would see it more often.

23
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:36,729
No other class has a weapon like this that totally differs from the default.

24
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:41,900
Like I said, the sniper rifle, sniper rifle, sniper rifle, bow and arrow. Whoa, what?

25
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,080
It's amazing. And I kind of wanted to make this video to get some of your guys' responses and some of your feedback.

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,259
What would you put in this game for some of the other classes?

27
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,500
Let's say for instance the heavy. He's got of course the miniguns.

28
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
So what would you guys in the comments section let me know?

29
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:07,740
What would you give, not only the heavy, but what would you give the other classes to make it sort of like the Huntsman versus the sniper rifles?

30
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,740
And I was thinking about this in my bed the other night. I was going, you know, the soldier.

31
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:18,099
The soldier should probably have some type of maybe assault rifle or something like that, or maybe a different type of grenade launcher,

32
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,099
or maybe something like that. I was just kind of going all over the place.

33
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:25,099
But it really gets you thinking because they've already done it with the Huntsman and the sniper rifles.

34
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,099
There are two totally different weapon classes.

35
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:36,469
And really the only other one I can think of besides the Huntsman is probably the shortstop or maybe even the pompson for the engineer.

36
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:40,469
But those are still kind of in the same category as their default counterparts.

37
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:44,710
So just wanted to throw that out there. And hopefully we see some more of these cool items.

38
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,710
Hopefully Valve throws us some more cool stuff.

39
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,080
But it just got me thinking and I of course wanted to get your guys opinions because when I'm rolling around in bed thinking,

40
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,080
okay, that sounded really bad. Let's redo this.

41
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,080
When I'm in various modes of deep contemplation and in undisclosed locations,

42
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,080
I like to throw the ideas off people and you guys always bounce back with some really good responses.

43
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,379
And I do read every single comment.

44
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,379
So if you throw a comment at me and you don't think I'm going to read it or it's too long,

45
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,379
and he's not going to read this, I will read it. I read everything.

46
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:20,379
And I can't reply to everybody.

47
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:25,379
And that's just because the sheer amount of people sometimes that leave comments on these videos or in PMs or whatever.

48
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:31,379
But really do keep in mind, I do read every comment and I do appreciate every single one of those comments,

49
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,379
whether it be constructive criticism or whether that be something good.

50
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,379
I appreciate all of it, guys.

51
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:43,560
And I know already that I'm going to get so many good responses to this particular video question thing.

52
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,740
And yeah, I'm looking forward to it, guys.

53
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,230
So that is going to wrap up this particular video.

54
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,230
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

55
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,230
And I forgot to mention, this is a one-life from start to finish,

56
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,230
where I complete the entire round without dying.

57
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,230
I forgot to mention that.

58
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,230
So one-life gameplay is the Huntsman sniper.

59
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,230
And I will see you guys all soon.

60
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,230
So take care, everybody.
