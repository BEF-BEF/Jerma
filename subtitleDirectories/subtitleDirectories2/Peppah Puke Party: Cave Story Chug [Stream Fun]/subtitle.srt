6
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:28,819
Something like that. Oh, no, why did my flash plug-in crash? Am I still streaming right now?

7
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:36,790
Hold on a second. That would have been bad. Okay, I'm still streaming. My like entire like

8
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:43,000
computer is almost crashed. Or did it? Oh, I think we're still here. Oh, we're here. Okay.

9
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Everything just crashed. That was weird. Bottoms up boys and girls. If you're in the stream,

10
00:01:50,280 --> 00:02:07,430
this is to you. Whoa. It always is good the first sip. Let's get going. Oh, chug it, chug it.

11
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:16,060
I can't chug it. I gotta savor this one. It's gonna last me a little while. Click here. Sound

12
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:23,719

00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:44,099
something. Apparently he already is. Okay. Oh, the booster version 2.0. Please honor my final request.

14
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:51,270
What is he dying? Why is he dead? I'm looking at the chat right now and all I see is chug,

15
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:59,419
chug, chug. All right, fine. I will do it. I will do it. I wanted to like drink this.

16
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,250
I'm gonna puke on stream. Like you're gonna see me puke on stream. It's gonna happen.

17
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:15,259
I'm gonna savor it for like two minutes and then I'm not gonna tell you when I'm gonna do it.

18
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:21,689
So here's how it's gonna happen. I'm gonna just do it at a very random time. You're not gonna know

19
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:33,500
until it happens. So there you go. Oh, wow. That was great. I wasn't even reading that. Where do I

20
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:41,340
go? I have no idea. I didn't even read one word of that text. Can somebody tell me where I'm going?

21
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,889
Maybe I'll just talk to him again. Take suit and escape from this island, please. Okay. Well,

22
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:56,150
where the hell is she? I thought she like went to bed. So how do I equip it? Press the jump

23
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,449
button while airborne and boost in one of four directions. Yeah, I want to equip it. Are you

24
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:16,230
kidding me? Let's go. Oh, man. Look at that. Oh, this thing is, this thing is sick. All right.

25
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:28,730
Hold on. I gotta read the chat. Go to the grassland. All right. Well, let's go get her. Do I have to go

26
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:36,060
in the teleporter? I don't think so. So do I have to go to the egg corridor? I gotta go to the egg?

27
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:48,329
Right. All right. We're going to the, we're going to the egg corridor. You thought I was gonna chug

28
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,870
it, didn't you? No, you're never going to know when that happens. It's just going to happen.

29
00:04:53,670 --> 00:05:01,370
Hey, dude. I don't know what's going on. Why are you asking me? You're supposed to,

30
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:20,170
you're the one that like lives here. Oh, that's delicious. Oh, look out, the frogs. Come on,

31
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:28,089
you frog freaks. Come here. Actually, I like this weapon. This weapon is fun to use. I should have

32
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:41,819
used it for a while now. Wow. Wow. That guy came out of nowhere. Look at that guy. Come here. Yeah,

33
00:05:41,819 --> 00:06:00,660
flying gear team. Still level one. I gotta stop getting hit. That's my issue here. I can just

34
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:13,750
kill you. Open the treasure chest. Max missiles and max missiles increased by five. Sweet. Oh,

35
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,870
wow. I forget. Somebody just told me I could hover. I like completely forgot about that.

36
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:27,339
Whoa. Come here. Come here. Oh, that's so awesome. That lasts for a long time.

37
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:37,529
Uh, this game is free. Cave Story, the regular Cave Story, I believe is free. Is it? But Cave

38
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:44,100
Story Plus is not free. You can get it on Steam. I believe for $10. I could be wrong.

39
00:06:47,350 --> 00:07:09,500
So should I, do I have to go in this door? Oh, that was such a bad idea.

40
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:20,250
Whose idea was that? Whose idea was that? Because we're no longer friends. It was my idea.

41
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Jerma, you're not my friend anymore. Oh, do I have to have like a boss fight right now? I'm gonna

42
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:34,759
die. Why did I just kill that guy? It will harm your health.

43
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:45,610
I'll be fine. That's not the first time I've done that.
