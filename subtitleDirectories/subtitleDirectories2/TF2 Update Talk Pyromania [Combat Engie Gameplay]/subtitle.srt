00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:14,839
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,

2
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,480
and tonight we're gonna be playing as the Engineer with the Widowmaker, the Mini-Sentry

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,199
Gunslinger, and the Pistol. It's gonna be on Barn Blitz defense on the last point, but

4
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,079
we are not gonna talk about the gameplay. We're gonna talk about the update stuff and how

5
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,909
tomorrow, Wednesday, meet the Pyros coming out and we got a bunch of new stuff, a bunch

6
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,509
of new items, some new sets. My brain is wracked right now. I cannot wait to talk about this.

7
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:46,710
Now, how I typically do my update videos, guys, is I wait till it's all out. Wait till

8
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,109
I can actually get my hands on this stuff before I give, obviously, my demonstrations

9
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:55,829
and my first opinions on them and stuff like that. So that video will be out tomorrow.

10
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,390
The second I can get my hands on all these items and make a video, it will be live on

11
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:06,319
this channel. But in the meantime, let's talk about what we've seen so far. So Monday, they

12
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:12,459
showed us, in my opinion, the best part about this entire update. We're getting a new official

13
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:19,000
game mode to Team Fortress 2. The last official game mode was DeGroot Keep, and a lot of people

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,640
don't even consider that a game mode. And we've gotten stuff like Saxon Hail. We've

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,340
gotten stuff like Prop Hunt and WarioWare. Those are all great community mods, but we

16
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,099
haven't seen an official one in so long. So this is just so exciting to me. I can't wait

17
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:37,579
to play this. Can't wait to try it. I have no idea how the game mode works. But the way

18
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:42,180
it sounds on the Valve website, it's kind of like Left 4 Dead 2 scavenge mode, where

19
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,620
you had one team had to fill up a tank and the other team had to stop them from doing

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,900
that. And if the first team fills the tank up and the rocket takes off, then they win

21
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,459
the game and then they flip a course sides and vice versa. So I think that's kind of

22
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:00,340
how it's going to work. Maybe red team is defense or maybe not. Maybe it's you're both

23
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,219
fighting for the same rocket, blue team and red team. That would be pretty interesting.

24
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:07,819
You know, you have a bar on the top that goes back and forth depending on how much fuel

25
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:12,759
the certain side is put in. This is all speculation at this point because I have no idea. But

26
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:18,699
I do know one thing. It's probably going to be a lot of fun. So today, Tuesday, we got

27
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:23,139
a bunch of different items for some of the classes. We got some scout stuff, sniper,

28
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:27,819
soldier and pyro. And I actually really want to talk about the pyro item. I'll go over

29
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,939
the stuff obviously tomorrow. I'm going to do a big, huge video on all this stuff. But

30
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:35,990
I want to talk about the pyro item mostly. Link will be in the description for all these

31
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:41,150
items and you can scroll down and see what I'm talking about. This pyro item is a secondary,

32
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,469
I think. But the stats on it are very, very odd. So for instance, it's called the scorch

33
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:52,090
shot, right? Flare knocks back target on hit and ignites enemies in a small radius. And

34
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,710
there's a minus 50% damage penalty on this thing. So my question is this. If this is

35
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:03,030
a secondary, why would you ever equip this rather than the flare gun or the detonator

36
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,229
or the shotgun? Knocking somebody back for a secondary, it's essentially a compression

37
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:14,169
blast. But as a pyro, we use our compression blast to utilize our secondaries. So if I

38
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,770
compression blast somebody and then switch to this and shoot them, I'm going to compression

39
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,629
blast them twice. I don't think it crits. I'm not sure if it even does any of those

40
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:27,599
things the flare gun does. And the minus 50% damage penalty, I feel like this is a primary.

41
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,919
I feel like it should be a primary because I can't think of a use for it if it was a

42
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:36,360
secondary. If it were a primary, think about launching somebody in the air with this, then

43
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,639
switching to something like the reserve shooter or the detonator or the flare gun and getting

44
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,319
the crit. That would make some sense. That would be interesting, especially because of

45
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,879
the minus 50% damage. You could essentially turn this into a compression blaster and that's

46
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,039
its job and that's what it's used for. But I think I have to stop making all these assumptions

47
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:58,020
on this item before I even sit down and use it. But that's my favorite part about Team

48
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,479
Fortress. Sitting down, speculating on items because we don't even know. There could be

49
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,759
more stuff tomorrow that complements this item. I don't even know yet. Nobody knows.

50
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,830
That's the beauty of Team Fortress. So tomorrow is Wednesday, which is the launch of the update

51
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,410
and of course the launch of Meet the Pyro. So here's a little fun facts for you. Meet

52
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,509
the Pyro comes out tomorrow. Meet the Medic came out exactly one year ago. And before

53
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:27,310
that, Meet the Spy came out two full years behind Meet the Medic. So it's kind of interesting.

54
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,310
They took two years to make Meet the Medic and pretty much less than one to make Meet

55
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,870
the Pyro. I remember looking at that coming in 2012 image that's on the main page and

56
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,689
I thought to myself, there's no freaking way they're going to introduce Meet the Pyro in

57
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:45,069
the first or second quarter. There's no way. I thought this was going to come out in like

58
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:51,250
November or December, right at the very end of 2012. And I was proven wrong. And that's

59
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,160
pretty awesome because I can't wait to see it. So yeah, that's going to wrap up the video

60
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,240
guys. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And let's see how

61
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,480
this update comes through. Let's see how awesome it is. Let's see how cool Meet the Pyro is.

62
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,939
I'm sure we're all going to be talking about this tomorrow. There will be a video on this

63
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,920
channel tomorrow as well talking about all the items in detail, showing them in gameplay

64
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,769
form. Just wanted to make this video telling you how excited I am and I can't wait for

65
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:18,649
Meet the Pyro and I can't wait for these items. But yeah, anyways, I'll see you guys all next

66
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:21,009
time and take care everybody.
