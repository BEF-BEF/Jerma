1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,130
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot.

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,629
Said it correct. Good, because I've been saying, like, The Mighty Epic Quest for Loot, and that's not correct.

3
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:26,129
It's a pretty long title, and that can be a little bit of a pain sometimes, and you try to tell people about it when you get in a conversation with somebody.

4
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:29,129
You're like, hey, have you heard of this game, The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot?

5
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,130
They're like, uh, what did you just say? Are you okay? Do you need to go to the hospital?

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:41,130
But no, this is an action RPG, guys, and it's one of those action RPGs that's not really classified as a 100% action RPG.

7
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,299
It's sort of a mishmash of a few different genres, which makes it really, really cool.

8
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:51,299
And I really hope that before I really even get into this, this is in closed beta right now.

9
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,299
It just came out of alpha, and it's in a very early beta stage.

10
00:00:55,299 --> 00:01:01,299
So if something changes from this video in the next six months or so as they're developing the game, then that's why.

11
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:10,299
But I really do hope, I'm praying to Ubisoft or the guys that are making this game, I really do pray that they take this game in a direction that is fun.

12
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:16,299
Because sometimes games like this can really just be a money sink, and I really hope that is absolutely not the case.

13
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:21,060
So with that being said, we're going to talk about the actual basics of the game here.

14
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,230
And the basics of this game are you build a castle or a dungeon, whatever one you want to call it.

15
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,230
And other players come to loot it.

16
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:39,230
Depending on how difficult you make it, how much time you spend getting resources to create the dungeon and create the monsters, other players are going to attack it.

17
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:46,230
If they succeed, they take a portion of your money and your gems or your diamonds or whatever you want to call them.

18
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,230
And the thing is, you do the exact same thing.

19
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,230
There are two different phases in this game.

20
00:01:51,230 --> 00:02:00,230
There are the defense stage, where you build your castle up for people to come attack it, and the attack stage, where you go do the same thing that I just said to other people.

21
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:08,729
And the really cool thing about the defense aspect of the game is, unfortunately you can't see things happen in real time, somebody attacking your castle.

22
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:16,729
But after they're done, you can watch a replay of them going through and doing everything, almost in real time, but not quite.

23
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:17,729
It's a saved replay.

24
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:27,729
But I find that feature very, very cool, because you can go back and watch and see where people were having trouble in your castle, where they were just plowing through, having absolutely no problem at all, taking out all the monsters.

25
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:28,729
It's an awesome feature.

26
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:36,729
And if they die in your castle, there's a clickable icon in the pinpoint location where they died, where if you click it, you get 125 gold.

27
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:45,729
So they made the defense portion of this game satisfying, because instead of it just being, oh, you have to go and loot castles and attack castles to make any money.

28
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:49,729
No, you can make a pretty decent amount of money if you have a really good defense in your castle.

29
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:50,729
So two thumbs up.

30
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:51,729
That's a cool feature.

31
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:53,479
So moving on to the combat.

32
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,479
The combat is pretty straightforward.

33
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:02,479
If you played any action RPG in your life, you have the click to move, click to attack, and a couple of spells at your disposable.

34
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,479
Disposable diapers.

35
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:10,909
So there are only three classes in the game right now, two of which are playable right out of the gate.

36
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:14,909
The second you install the beta, you can play as the archer and the knight.

37
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:22,909
The mage, the third and final class as it stands right now, can only be played in the beta if you buy him.

38
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:25,909
You have to buy the mage and buy into the beta.

39
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:26,909
They have tiers.

40
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:31,909
There's the to get into the beta, then there's the other pack, then there's like the founders pack.

41
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:33,909
You have to buy into it to play as the mage.

42
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:35,909
But everything is going to be free to play.

43
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:36,909
You're not going to have to buy anything.

44
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:37,909
Everything will be open.

45
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:41,909
This is just for the beta purposes to test things in advance.

46
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:44,469
But it's really cool looting other castles.

47
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:49,469
It's really cool fighting other people's stuff, seeing how they did things and then maybe stealing their ideas.

48
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:51,469
I've done that quite a few times so far.

49
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:53,469
And the one thing that is not...

50
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:58,469
I know it's a beta and I know I'm talking about the beta right now, but there's not a whole lot of loot in this game yet.

51
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:01,469
There's different rarities, there's different item qualities that drop.

52
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:04,469
You can deck your character out, but there's not very much stuff.

53
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:08,469
There's only a couple of different things you can really get that you really want.

54
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:10,469
And the upgrades come very sparsely.

55
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:15,469
You can take your own gear anyways using either in-game currency or gold that you acquire.

56
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:22,709
And I understand that balance purpose is because you're going up against other players' castles and their money is at stake.

57
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,709
Well, their in-game money is at stake and your money is at stake.

58
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:26,709
You have to...

59
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:35,709
Gear, you can't have like crazy overpowered gear because it's more about the strategy of finding ways through castles, putting different skill combinations.

60
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,709
That's more important than having an amazing gear set.

61
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:39,709
But it still is important.

62
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:40,709
It still should be there.

63
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:44,949
But you guys get it. You guys understand.

64
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:48,579
So now we're going to talk about the in-game currency and what it does.

65
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:53,579
When you get into the beta, you get 1,500 of these gems, green gems.

66
00:04:53,579 --> 00:05:01,579
And what you do with them is when you do various tasks, when you build certain things in your castle, it's going to take time.

67
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:06,579
It's going to take upwards of six hours to complete building sometimes.

68
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:13,579
And how you skip that, just like games like Farmville and the Smurfs Super Fun Village.

69
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:18,579
So some of these Facebook and iOS type games, you can speed up the process by using the in-game currency.

70
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:26,579
Now, it's not to an extent right now where I would say it's completely bogus to have it in the game because there are...

71
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:32,579
While you're having things be building, sometimes they take like 10 minutes, sometimes they take like 45 minutes.

72
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,579
But while that happens, you can go and play the other half of the game.

73
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:40,579
You can go and loot dungeons, you can go build your character out, you can go try out new builds.

74
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:48,579
That makes it so it's a lot less painful to have to sit there and wait and force yourself to buy in-game currency to finish your buildings.

75
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:58,250
With that said though, this type of currency and this type of mechanic is really, really treading on a very thin line.

76
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,250
Where when you cross that line, you get to pay to win.

77
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,250
And they haven't got there yet, but it's right there.

78
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,250
It's staring at pay to win in the face.

79
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,250
I really hope they don't make anything in this game where it's like, oh yeah, alright.

80
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,250
So you want to build your dungeon? Oh, that's cool.

81
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,250
If you don't pay this money, then it's going to take you two weeks to build this part of the dungeon.

82
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,620
And everyone else has a dungeon way cooler than yours because they already did it.

83
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,620
I really hope that doesn't happen because this game is really, really fun, really addicting in its current state.

84
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,620
And they're going to be adding a lot of stuff. This is a very early beta.

85
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,620
And this is my impression so far on the beta.

86
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,620
If you're finding this video months or even years later, this was a first impressions video of the beta.

87
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,620
So keep that in mind when you're watching this.

88
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,620
It's a fantastic, fun little game.

89
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,620
And how you get into the beta, you can sign up for it on the MightyQuest Repaglute site.

90
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,620
And they pick people all the time.

91
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,620
Or you can get directly into the beta right now for 10 bucks USD.

92
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:03,620
And what that's going to do, that's going to unlock the first two character classes to test the knight and the archer.

93
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,620
And it's going to give you 1500 in-game currency to be able to play around with.

94
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,620
So if you want to get right into the beta right now, you think this is your cup of tea, then you can do it for 10 bucks.

95
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,620
And if not, you can just sign up and hopefully you get picked.

96
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,300
And if you don't care at all, then who cares?

97
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,300
But that's going to wrap this video up, guys.

98
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Thank you all so much for watching.

99
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,300
This has been the MightyQuest for Epic Loot, a fun little game by Ubisoft.

100
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,300
If you want to check it out, check it out.

101
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,300
And I'll see you all next time.

102
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,300
And of course, take care, everybody.
