1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:14,089
Hey what's up everybody, it's Germa here with the answers portion of my Q&A.

2
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:23,329
Before I get into this, I want to just say that the background of all this is going to be the TF2 super crazy fun time event that I had last week at some point.

3
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:31,500
I think it was like three or four days ago. We did like Scout on Scout Melee only. We did Demoman only Demo Night versus Pyro.

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,100
We did a bunch of crazy, crazy crap so hopefully you'll enjoy it and it's kind of funny.

5
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:46,409
I couldn't really do a gameplay commentary on it because obviously it's just a bunch of like insanity so there's no way I could have done a gameplay commentary.

6
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:49,409
So I'm going to let it go in the background and if you want to pay attention to that, that's cool.

7
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:51,409
If you want to listen to my voice, that's cool too.

8
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:53,409
So here we go, time to answer your questions.

9
00:00:53,409 --> 00:01:00,170
I'm going to start off with the basic questions first. A lot of people ask these so I'm just going to get right into it.

10
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:08,180
How old are you? I'm actually kind of old. I don't look that old but I'm a lot older than you might think.

11
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,180
I'm 25 years old so if some of you thought I was like 19 or 18 or something, you were so wrong.

12
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,739
I'm 25.

13
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:20,739
Where do you live? I think I've answered this before but just for the sake of it.

14
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:25,299
Boston, I live in Boston, not New Jersey, not New York. Boston.

15
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:27,299
What do you do for work?

16
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,480
This is kind of a difficult question because I do a few things.

17
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,079
For most of my money, I am a freelance videographer.

18
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,079
I have a big expensive HD camera and that's what I film.

19
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,319
I film weddings, I film events, promos, music videos. I do a lot of crap.

20
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,319
So that's kind of what I do for money.

21
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:51,319
And I used to before, recently, maybe like two or three months ago, I kind of stopped doing it.

22
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,560
But I was a substitute teacher at a middle school.

23
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,140
So there you go, that's what I do for work.

24
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,140
How did you meet Leptor?

25
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,019
Leptor, I met him by, I asked him a question.

26
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,019
I sent him a message because I was getting kind of big.

27
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,020
When I say kind of big, I mean like I was at like six or seven hundred subscribers.

28
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,199
And I was just looking for advice because the channel was growing so fast and so rapidly that

29
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,379
I was looking for somebody that had a big channel.

30
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,379
What to do about all the people and how to go about growing even more.

31
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,379
So I sent Leptor a message. I sent IRSnipeR.

32
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,740
I sent Shibya a message. I tried to talk to Star.

33
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,740
And I got a few replies back. I got one from Leptor.

34
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,740
Leptor most notably because Leptor said,

35
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,740
Hey, why don't you go on my channel? Your stuff is great.

36
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,740
I will put you on my channel because I like you.

37
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,740
And I said, well, you know what? I like you too.

38
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,050
So that's how we kind of became buddies.

39
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,050
And we, to this day now, we're still good internet buddies.

40
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,479
The next question is not really a question, but it's more of a request.

41
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,479
And it was from Leptor, actually, who we just talked about.

42
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,479
So I'm going to take his request into consideration.

43
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,719
And for the next two questions, I am going to fulfill Leptor's request.

44
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,719
If you knew what it was, then cool. If you don't, well, I'm sure you're going to find out.

45
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,110
Why don't you use the fast switch on TF2?

46
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,349
Oh, listen, okay, let me tell you something.

47
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:11,699
Fast switch on TF2, it's just a little hard. It's hard to do it.

48
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:14,699
You know, I can't do quick switching. It screws with my brain, you know.

49
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,699
It really, you know, makes me look like an idiot, you know what I'm talking about.

50
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,699
It makes me crazy. You know, it makes me a stupid fucking idiot

51
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,699
whenever I try to upload a video.

52
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:25,699
I'm getting tired of this. I'm getting tired of fucking doing this every day.

53
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,710
I didn't even answer the question. So anyways.

54
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,710
Why don't you use fast switch on TF2?

55
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,340
Fast switch on TF2, it's because whenever I hit one,

56
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,340
I'm always accidentally hitting buttons in this game.

57
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,340
So if I accidentally hit a button, it's going to switch my weapon.

58
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,340
So I like to accidentally hit a button and see, no shit, I didn't want to do that and go right back.

59
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,340
So that's why I don't use quick switch.

60
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,509
The next question is, what would you do for a Klondike bar?

61
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:50,509
I got this a lot. Too many people were asking about Klondike bars,

62
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:52,509
which, you know, Klondike bars suck.

63
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:54,509
I'd rather eat the heavy sandwich, to be honest, because he's a fat fuck.

64
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:55,509
You know what I'm talking about.

65
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:59,509
But anyways, I don't think I want to eat a Klondike bar because Klondike bars kind of suck.

66
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:02,069
They kind of, you know, they taste kind of like dog crap.

67
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:04,069
You know what I'm talking about? I'm not going to eat it.

68
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,500
No, I would not do anything for a Klondike bar because I don't really like Klondike bars.

69
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
They're too messy.

70
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,370
I mean, if that's your goal, if that's your goal in life is to be a pawn star.

71
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,370
I've been watching too much A&E lately, sorry.

72
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:27,670
A pawn star, if you think you can pull it off, then once you get old enough, I guess go for it.

73
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,730
And absolutely, brother, bring it on.

74
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,730
You bring the knives, I'll bring the beer.

75
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,170
Even though I don't really drink beer.

76
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,170
I know some classes and loadouts can be more useful depending on the map, but which is the most fun?

77
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,730
In my opinion, the most fun thing to play in Team Fortress 2 is a Huntsman Sniper.

78
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:01,730
Huntsman Sniper with the Jurati and the Bushwhacker, I think, is the most entertaining thing to play.

79
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,730
Because it's a lot of fun just aiming at people, shooting arrows, pretending like you're in Lord of the Rings and stuff like that.

80
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:12,730
It's just a really fun, interesting setup, so that's probably the most fun class to play.

81
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:21,819
Soon, soon.

82
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:28,129
When I say soon, that could mean like a couple months from now, but I'm going to try as hard as I can to get that sooner.

83
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,129
Me and Leptor were actually talking about buying a dedicated server together and splitting it,

84
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:37,129
so there might be a Germa Leptor server at some point in the near future, so look out for that.

85
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:45,410
No, I hate Jello. It is the worst.

86
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Yes, before I started doing commentaries, believe it or not, I talked all the time on the mics in Team Fortress 2,

87
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,339
and now that I've kind of gotten a little bit of a following, I've shied away in public servers doing that,

88
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:10,339
because I don't want to give myself like a bad name, like, oh, dude, Nihal Medic, hit the Uber next time, you idiot.

89
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:15,339
Like, I feel like I could really get myself in a little bit of trouble now if I try and do that now.

90
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:19,579
But yes, a couple years ago, I used to do that quite frequently, so.

91
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:26,029
What kind of music do you like? I got a bunch of these, so I'm going to put these all in the same category.

92
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:30,029
What music do you like? What's your favorite band? What's your favorite song? I'm going to do them all right now.

93
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:36,399
My favorite band is the Gorillaz. I think that they are the only band you should be listening to right now,

94
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,399
because everything else is this, you know, pop dance floor crap that everyone seems to love now.

95
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,639
And if you love that, then that's your own opinion. I'm not going to say that it's a wrong opinion.

96
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,819
I just say that I don't like that crap. Let me reiterate that. I don't like that garbage.

97
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:59,060
I'm just kidding, obviously. But Gorillaz are my favorite band. My favorite song is Stylo from the Gorillaz.

98
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,060
If you've never heard Stylo, please, God, go listen to it right now. For the love of God, go play it.

99
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:11,490
And what's your favorite type of music? My favorite type of music is alternative, kind of like alternative rock,

100
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,490
alternative like trance. Not like techno, but like I said, the Gorillaz are my favorite band.

101
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:23,259
So that type of, you know, electro pop, electro alternative, that's my favorite type of music.

102
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:27,259
DMACDouble asks, what's your favorite thing about Tim Robbins?

103
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:38,779
My favorite thing about Tim Robbins is probably his incredible acting experience, his great demeanor on the stage and screen,

104
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:46,389
and how nice he is to people that are on set with him, because that's what I've heard.

105
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:52,209
How did you react when you saw that you had so many subscribers with so few videos?

106
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:59,500
Happy and shocked. I guess that's the only thing I can really say is I was really, really happy.

107
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,680
Here's a really quick story, actually, for you guys. I'm sure some of you would think this is actually kind of interesting.

108
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:13,540
When I first did my first Team Fortress 2 commentary a couple months ago, I did two in a row, and I uploaded them on the same night,

109
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:23,779
and the next morning I woke up and I said, I don't want to do this. No one's going to watch me. I'm too old for this. I can't do this.

110
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:27,269
So I deleted all the videos and I was going to delete the account.

111
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:33,820
Then I talked to a friend of mine who said, you know what? You might as well just go for it, and you might as well have fun with it,

112
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:39,820
because what are you going to lose? What are you going to lose? People are going to think you're a dork or something?

113
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,120
I already am a dork. I've been a dork my whole life.

114
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,419
So one of my buddies actually was the one that convinced me to continue doing it, and I brought the videos back.

115
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:55,289
So if it wasn't for my real-life friend, these videos would not exist, and I'm so glad that I did,

116
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:58,289
because you guys are all so awesome, and I've had so much fun so far.

117
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:02,289
So I look forward to a nice, real long-term relationship with a lot of you guys.

118
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:06,289
Hopefully you stick around in the months and years to come, because I'll be here.

119
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:09,870
So I hope we have some good times.

120
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,429
That's two questions. I kind of molded them together.

121
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:22,429
I have owned Team Fortress 2 since the very beginning, since it first came out. I played in the beta.

122
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:31,470
They did like a promo where if you bought the game, like a pre-order of the game, you could play for two or three weeks before the release.

123
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,470
That's when I bought the game. I played in October. It released at the end of October or something.

124
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,470
So I played like two or three weeks before everyone else did in the beta.

125
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:44,080
And it's been three, four, five years since the game came out, so that's how long I've been playing.

126
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,080
How many hours do I have? I have 600 hours played in the game, which is not that much compared to a lot of people,

127
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,080
but you got to remember I'm 25 years old and I have other obligations and I have other things I have to do every day.

128
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,639
So when I was in college, that's where a lot of those hours came from when I was in college.

129
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:06,519
Did you become friends with most of the other Team Fortress 2 subscri- I think he means to say commentators.

130
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:12,519
So did you become friends with most of the other Team Fortress 2 commentators before Leptor featured you or after?

131
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,519
Because it seems that recently everybody knows you.

132
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,190
Uh, no. Leptor is the only guy that I really have a speaking relationship with.

133
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,370
So before Leptor, it was just me. It was just me.

134
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,370
And then I think it's because the fact that I have almost 2,000 subscribers now

135
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:36,370
is the reason why people are kind of starting to pay attention to the channel and the channel is actually starting to get a little bit of legitimacy now

136
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,370
because you guys are all still coming.

137
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,610
So keep coming and this channel will get even more legit.

138
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,450
Have you ever kissed two girls at the same time?

139
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,389
No. Unfortunately I have not.

140
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:54,779
What is your favorite Engineer Melee weapon?

141
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,600
Definitely the Jag and I know the Jag is a gimmick weapon and some of you guys are going to say,

142
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,600
that's a gimmick weapon, come on, it's got to be like the Southern Hospitality or something.

143
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,840
No, I really like the Jag only because building up a dispenser,

144
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,840
saving that 1.3 seconds, whatever it is,

145
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,840
it really does help in some situations and it looks really cool.

146
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,360
I like the weapon and how it looks. So that's why it is.

147
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,389
Do you want to fish slap Star for pure randomness?

148
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:30,700
No, I don't because I don't have a speaking relationship with Star.

149
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,659
I've never had a conversation with him really so.

150
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:39,659
Do you own Killing Floor and if you do, would you be willing to record some gameplay of it?

151
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:42,159
I do not own Killing Floor.

152
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,159
It's a game that I thought when it first came out it was sort of a Left 4 Dead clone

153
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:48,159
and I already had Left 4 Dead so I didn't want to get it.

154
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,159
But if people want me to play it and if it's good enough,

155
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,159
then yeah, eventually here once I'm done with all these other games I'm doing,

156
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,159
then maybe yeah, I'll try doing a Let's Play of it.

157
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,340
Will my comment be in the video? Yes, it will.

158
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,340
Nerayuxa32, Nerayuxa32, of course it will.

159
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,970
Why did you start playing TF2?

160
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,960
I started playing TF2 because I played Team Fortress Classic

161
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,960
way long ago when a lot of you guys were too young to even play video games

162
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
or to even understand some of these games.

163
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Team Fortress Classic is Team Fortress 1.

164
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:30,139
I believe it was like 1996 or 1997 when it came out and I was like 14 or 15

165
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,549
and so your Team Fortress 2 is my Team Fortress 1.

166
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:38,919
You know how some of you, a lot of you guys are 13, 14, 15, 16,

167
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,919
a lot of you guys are pretty young.

168
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,919
So I was your age when I was your age I was playing Team Fortress 1.

169
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,289
So that's a little bit of info for you.

170
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:50,289
But obviously when Team Fortress 2 came out, the sequel,

171
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:53,289
it's a much better game so that's why I started playing it.

172
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:57,230
Why do I always check to see if you uploaded a new video?

173
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,100
Because you're the man and you're a critical viewer

174
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,100
and I love people like you so that's not a bad thing.

175
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,039
What is your favorite class and what do you think about the new soldier weapons?

176
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:14,710
I combine these two because a lot of people ask both of these questions so

177
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,710
my favorite class has changed over the years.

178
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,710
At first when I first got Team Fortress 2 and in Team Fortress Classic it was the Spy.

179
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,889
The Spy is just a lot of fun to play.

180
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:25,889
More recently however though it's been the Engineer.

181
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,889
The Engineer is probably my favorite class as of right now.

182
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:32,580
So Spy, Engineer, definitely my two favorites.

183
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,580
What do you think about the new soldier weapons?

184
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,580
I think that they are stupid.

185
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,580
I think they're just complete gimmicks and I think Valve

186
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,580
should never have added them into the game but you know,

187
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,639
20-20 hindsight you can't look back and say that because it's already here.

188
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,639
Just deal with it.

189
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,639
And they're actually kind of, the items are kind of fun to play with

190
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,940
but that's all they are.

191
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,940
They're items just to play with for one round and never use them again.

192
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,210
Can you fake Chao your friend's babysitter's aunt?

193
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,409
I have no idea what that even means.

194
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:08,350
So I'm going to say yes, no.

195
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,940
Do you love Jamps? says Jamps96.

196
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,559
I don't know, does Jamps love me?

197
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,179
Should Pluto be considered a planet?

198
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:23,809
Of course it should because you know what?

199
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,110
I say screw you to the scientists.

200
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,110
They can't do that to my boy Pluto.

201
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,110
He's been a planet since I was a little kid and it was the coolest thing

202
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,110
knowing Pluto was like the smallest, coolest planet

203
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,110
and now they're going to take it away from him.

204
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,610
Give me a break.

205
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,870
How long did it take you to become so sexy?

206
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,870
And any tips on how to achieve your sexiness?

207
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,250
Okay, first of all, the first part of the question is DNA, I believe

208
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:57,379
is how I became so sexy and my parents, I guess by genes

209
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:01,070
and any tips on how to achieve your sexiness?

210
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,740
Yeah, be yourself and have some confidence.

211
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,759
Only two tips I can really give.

212
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,639
Boxers or briefs, somebody says.

213
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,639
Funny, boxer briefs is what I wear.

214
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,639
Boxer briefs.

215
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,159
What is your favorite food?

216
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:23,539
Oh God, dude, this question is going to take a while.

217
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:24,539
No, it's not.

218
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:29,490
My favorite food is probably.

219
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,049
Oh God, it's like two or three options.

220
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:36,360
I'm just going to say the two that I'm going to give you two.

221
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,360
One is General Gao's chicken, like the Chinese food.

222
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
I think that's it's unbelievable.

223
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,789
And the other one is chicken cutlets.

224
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:46,789
And I'm not talking just regular boring ass chicken cutlets.

225
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:52,269
I'm talking about the real thin pressed crispy fried chicken cutlet.

226
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:55,470
So those are my two favorite foods.

227
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,470
This question is just potatoes.

228
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,899
Potatoes?

229
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:03,639
No, no potatoes.

230
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,200
What do you do when you're not playing video games?

231
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,570
Oh, that's a good question because I do quite a few things.

232
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,570
First of all, I am in a men's softball league

233
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,570
and we're currently going into the playoffs next week, so wish us luck.

234
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,059
So I do that.

235
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,059
I play men's softball.

236
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,059
I used to play like baseball, softball, you know, when I was younger.

237
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:25,370
And that's just continuing now.

238
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,370
I love sports.

239
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,370
So that's the reason why.

240
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,179
What else do I do?

241
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:31,179
I do lifting.

242
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:32,179
Like I said before, I do a lot of workouts.

243
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,179
So, you know, three or four or five days a week, I'm in the gym.

244
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:38,549
So I do that when I'm not gaming and obviously just hanging out with friends,

245
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:40,549
hanging out with family, you know, just doing the old thing.

246
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:44,460
Do you like Borderlands?

247
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,700
I got that question four or five times.

248
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
Yeah, I do like Borderlands.

249
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,700
And you'd probably know that if you watched my Borderlands Let's Play with Leptor.

250
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,940
So the answer is yes, I do like Borderlands and go check out Leptor's page right now

251
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,179
because it has like at least 14 or 15 episodes right now of us playing Borderlands.

252
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:08,700
The next question is how big?

253
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,460
This big.

254
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,460
What do you think of people that always say, mainly in tutorial videos, go Google it.

255
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,950
I don't have time to add links, blah, blah, blah, blah.

256
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:24,319
Ah, I think that if you're going to make a video for people that's going to teach them something,

257
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,500
I think that you should have all the information in the video, not like go, go do this, go do that.

258
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,500
I think if you're going to do it, especially a tutorial video,

259
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,799
you need to be able to tell people exactly what you're doing, where to go, what the hell.

260
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,799
You know, you have to give everybody all the information.

261
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,099
So I think that I agree.

262
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:41,099
I think that's a dumb thing.

263
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:46,109
Why does Google Chrome spell check say that Google needs to have the first letter uppercased?

264
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:49,289
Well, because Google is a noun.

265
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:50,289
It's a company.

266
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:52,289
So Google is a company, which is a noun, like I said.

267
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,289
So it has to have an uppercase letter at the beginning.

268
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:59,809
What do you think of the VAC, the anti-cheat system?

269
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:05,240
The anti-cheat system, I think it's great because it allows people to be afraid of hacking.

270
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,539
A lot of games don't put that fear in people, you know, like, oh, I'm going to go play, you know,

271
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,539
this game and there's no punkbuster or there's no VAC.

272
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,539
It's just I can do whatever the hell I want online.

273
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:22,869
VAC might have its flaws, but at least it's that wall that makes people afraid to do anything.

274
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,869
How did you get to know Shibby and why is he always so drunk?

275
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:29,819
Well, the first part of the question is pretty easy.

276
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:34,819
Just like Leptor, I sent Shibby a message and he sent me a reply back,

277
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:37,819
giving me some advice for the channel and he was a nice guy about it.

278
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:42,059
And as the channel grew, he, I guess, started to notice that people were hanging out here

279
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,059
and he was like, oh, who the hell is, hey, hey, what's going on, dude?

280
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,789
So and then we started talking and we became buddies and that's kind of how that happened.

281
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:50,789
And why is he always drunk?

282
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:53,099
Because he likes to have a good time.

283
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,099
Nothing wrong with that.

284
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,099
I'm not going to tell anybody what they can and can't do.

285
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:59,099
If you want to be drunk, if you want to have fun, I mean, he's only 23.

286
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:02,099
That's like the prime age to be like going out, having a good time all the time.

287
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,339
So I'm down with that.

288
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:05,339
That's fine for me.

289
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:09,789
What's your favorite game type and map in Team Fortress 2?

290
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:14,160
My favorite game type is Payload and my favorite map is Badwater.

291
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,160
I know that's like so cookie cutter, but that's the truth.

292
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,940
When will Team Fortress 3 come out and will it be microtransactions again?

293
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,140
Hmm.

294
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,140
Well, because I work at Valve, I'm going to tell you all the development plans of Valve.

295
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:37,440
And Team Fortress 3 is on pace to be released on January 16th of 2017.

296
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,680
And it's going to be all microtransactions.

297
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:47,289
And we're adding 18 more classes for a total of 29 classes, I think.

298
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:48,289
No. Yeah. Yeah.

299
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:51,460
So we're going to have like 30 classes in Team Fortress 3.

300
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,460
And it's going to cost $455 for a hat in the Manco store.

301
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,049
iAnimeKid3 asks, can you give me a hat?

302
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:02,740
No.

303
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Because if I give you a hat, then I have to give everybody else a hat.

304
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:12,910
So once I end up with like 12, 15, 16, 1700 hats, sure, I'll give everybody a damn hat.

305
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,660
What is your favorite weapon in Team Fortress 2?

306
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,289
The Frontier Justice.

307
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:21,289
The Frontier Justice is the best weapon in the game, in my opinion.

308
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,289
It's my favorite. I've named it.

309
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,289
So, you know, when you name something, it's like your favorite thing.

310
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:29,779
Either that or the Connivorous Kunai. Those are my two favorite items.

311
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:33,180
What other games will you be posting?

312
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,799
If you've been watching the channel so far, you see that I have The Witcher 2.

313
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,799
It's kind of a semi-serious let's play I'm going to start doing.

314
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,039
I'm going to do it maybe once every two weeks. Once every week I'll put a new video up.

315
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,279
Don't worry for those people that are freaking out.

316
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,279
It's not going to take over Team Fortress.

317
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,279
It's a secondary let's play. I'm going to say that again one more time to reiterate.

318
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:54,279
It's a secondary let's play.

319
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:57,420
Where did the name Jerma come from?

320
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,039
The name Jerma, it's pretty self-explanatory.

321
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,039
It's my first name, kind of changed a little bit.

322
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,279
My name is Jeremy.

323
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,279
So Jeremy, Jerma, it's kind of a nickname I had in high school.

324
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,650
So that's where it came from.

325
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,789
Do you play Minecraft and do you play on a server?

326
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:18,789
I play Minecraft very, very, very infrequently.

327
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:20,789
And no, I don't play on any particular server.

328
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:22,789
I kind of just jump around whenever I feel like it.

329
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:24,789
Haven't really played Minecraft in a few weeks.

330
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:28,789
The last time I played it was actually a couple days ago, but it was just for fun.

331
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,029
We were playing on the Hunting Wolves server.

332
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:34,029
And he was really cool about it.

333
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:37,029
And we were there with Shibby and Leon was there.

334
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,029
There was a bunch of dudes there.

335
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:40,029
So it was a fun time, but I don't really play Minecraft at all.

336
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:44,029
I only play it when, like I said, it's going to be just a goofy fun time.

337
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:47,740
Do you think Mars is a cool planet?

338
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:55,240
What did I tell you guys about asking about the stupid Mars question?

339
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,180
Oh no, Mars is actually kind of a cool planet.

340
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,180
Yeah, it is.

341
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,190
Katy Perry or Megan Fox?

342
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,500
Megan Fox all the way, definitely.

343
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,079
Do you live alone and do you have a girlfriend?

344
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:12,150
For the first one, I do not live alone.

345
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,150
I just graduated college about a year and a half, two years ago.

346
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,460
So got back to the home with the parents just hanging out here for now.

347
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,460
Trying to find my own place somewhere in the near future.

348
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,460
But I'm at my house still living at home.

349
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,019
Do you have a girlfriend?

350
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:27,019
No, I do not currently have a girlfriend.

351
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:33,190
But this does not mean I am going to accept inquiries of inquiries of people asking me,

352
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,190
Oh, hey, you don't have a girlfriend.

353
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,190
Like, let's chat.

354
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,190
Like, no.

355
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,190
So you can forget about that already if that was your plan.

356
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,519
What is your absolute favorite setup in the whole game?

357
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,079
Kind of hard because I have one or two,

358
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,079
but probably the one that I go to all the time is Engineer,

359
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:57,259
and it's the Frontier Justice, the Pistol, and the Mini-Sentry.

360
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:59,259
That is my absolute favorite setup in the game.

361
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:00,259
I love it so much.

362
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,259
I wish I could play it every day,

363
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:04,259
and I wish I could just do all Engineer gameplays.

364
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,500
But no, that's a joke.

365
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
But no, that's my favorite.

366
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,250
You are pretty funny, so I was wondering what makes you laugh.

367
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,250
Do you have a favorite comedian or a favorite movie or a joke?

368
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,380
I have a favorite comedian.

369
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,380
My favorite comedian is Bill Burr.

370
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,380
He is hysterical.

371
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,380
He's from Boston, too, which makes it even better.

372
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,380
He's hilarious.

373
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,380
If you have never heard of Bill Burr, you never watch Bill Burr.

374
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,380
He's kind of on the 17, 18-plus side,

375
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,819
so I'm not going to recommend that to anybody right now.

376
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:37,819
But if you are of age and you like funny comedians,

377
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:38,819
then go check out Bill Burr.

378
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:40,380
Favorite movie?

379
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,380
I don't really have a favorite movie.

380
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,380
I don't really watch movies, to be honest.

381
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,380
The last time I went to the movies was probably to see

382
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,450
one of the Harry Potter movies a while back,

383
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,009
so I don't really have a favorite movie.

384
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:58,099
Every gamer eventually noms on something during their hours of play.

385
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:00,099
What do you normally snack on?

386
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:03,539
That's a good question because I don't snack on anything.

387
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,539
I'm a drinker when I play games.

388
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:07,779
I'm not talking about alcoholic beverages.

389
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,779
I'm talking about like fruit punch or a soda or something.

390
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:14,779
I'm more of a drinker than an eater when I play games.

391
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:16,779
Do you like cheese?

392
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:18,779
And if you do, what's your favorite cheese?

393
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,150
I do love cheese. I love it a lot.

394
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,150
And my favorite cheese is Swiss.

395
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,150
Swiss cheese is amazing.

396
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,220
What's your favorite survival horror game of all time?

397
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,910
Probably Resident Evil 4.

398
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,150
That's one of the games I beat two or three times

399
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,150
and did all the other extra stuff, so probably Resident Evil 4.

400
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:40,910
What would you add or remove class-wise in TF2?

401
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,910
I would not remove a class and I would not add a class

402
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,910
only because the game is just so balanced around the nine classes.

403
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,910
If you took somebody away, it would just screw everything up.

404
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,910
Definitely it would ruin everything, so I wouldn't add or remove anybody.

405
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,789
What would you like to work as?

406
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:01,869
Huh, probably this, to be honest.

407
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:05,619
If I could somehow get to a position where I was doing this every day

408
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:08,619
and you guys were all involved and everyone was having a good time

409
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:10,990
and I could do this for a profession, it would be huge.

410
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,619
That would be huge for me because I'm getting kind of old

411
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:18,619
and it would be nice in the next couple years to have something where I could go,

412
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:19,619
you know what, this is a whole lot of fun.

413
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:22,859
I go to work every day with a smile on my face

414
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:25,160
and this is what I would love to do.

415
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Now, the question is, will that actually happen?

416
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,400
I don't know.

417
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,829
That's solely up to the amount of people that come to the channel,

418
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:35,440
the amount of people that stick around, and that's all up to you guys.

419
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,869
So that's what I would love to do, though.

420
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,869
I'd love to, you know, be a machinima partner or something

421
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:41,869
and make money doing this. It would be amazing.

422
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:46,029
Can you do a backflip?

423
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:49,980
It's funny because yes, I can.

424
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,980
I can do a backflip without my hands in the air.

425
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,980
That's not a joke.

426
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,980
And if anyone wants to give me hate on that,

427
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,980
I will post a video of me backflipping in the air without my hands.

428
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,980
So yes, I can.

429
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
Kind of an odd question, but yes.

430
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,980
Digimon or Pokemon?

431
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,670
Uh, neither.

432
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,670
Not a fan of either of them, but if I'd have to pick one,

433
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,670
probably Pokemon because it's the original, it's the older one.

434
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:22,109
What is the best thing to ever come in a Team Fortress 2 update?

435
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:23,109
Definitely payload.

436
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:26,109
Out of all the weapons, out of all the items, all the hats,

437
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:29,539
absolutely, it's definitely the addition of the payload game type

438
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:31,539
because that changed everything

439
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:33,539
and it made the game so much more popular,

440
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,539
so much more interesting, so I definitely would say payload.

441
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:41,549
Do you read, and if you do, what is your favorite book?

442
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:44,240
I don't really read a whole lot.

443
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
I don't read as much as I should.

444
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,240
I know that you're supposed to read at least like

445
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,240
five to 12 paragraphs a day to keep your brain working or whatever,

446
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,240
but I guess I do kind of read these comments.

447
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
I read graphic novels.

448
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
I don't know if they count, but I count that

449
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,240
because it's plenty of words, and if you want my favorite book,

450
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,609
if you want my favorite series, I guess you could say,

451
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:05,609
go look up a guy named Doug Tenapel.

452
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:09,910
Doug, T-E-N-N-E-P-A-L, Doug Tenapel.

453
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,220
He is the guy that created Earthworm Jim,

454
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,220
and he has insanely funny, insanely interesting graphic novels,

455
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,220
so go check about if you have never heard of him already.

456
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,900
What is your most hated class in Team Fortress 2?

457
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,660
As of right now, none.

458
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,660
I think the game is very, very balanced,

459
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,660
but two, three, four years ago,

460
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,660
it was definitely the Demoman and the Soldier,

461
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,660
and I'll tell you why.

462
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,019
A lot of you guys don't know this, but way back long ago,

463
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:41,259
the Demoman and the Soldier used to have much more ammunition.

464
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,259
I think right now the amount of rockets you have is 20.

465
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:46,259
It used to be somewhere around 40.

466
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:47,259
Same thing with the Demoman.

467
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:50,259
It's 16 pills you get in the grenade launcher.

468
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:52,259
It used to be like 36 or something.

469
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:55,259
It used to be insane, and it was a huge nerf.

470
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:58,259
When they did that, it was an enormous nerf to those classes.

471
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:02,529
What is your favorite hat in Team Fortress 2?

472
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:06,390
Definitely the one I currently have on the Heavy right now.

473
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,390
The Luchador, the Lodge Luchador.

474
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,460
It's hysterical. It's the best thing ever.

475
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,460
Do you have any dogs or cats?

476
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,700
Yes, I do. I have two dogs and three cats.

477
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,009
Yeah, my family's really crazy about animals.

478
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:24,400
Who is your favorite Team Fortress 2 commentator besides yourself?

479
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,900
Uh, I think all of them.

480
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,900
I think every single one of the TF2 commentators right now

481
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,079
bring something to the table.

482
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,079
Guys like IRSnipeR, they're really skill-based.

483
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:37,079
They have really, really high-quality skill videos

484
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,380
where they kill a bunch of people.

485
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,380
Star is really relaxed. He's really easy to listen to.

486
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,380
He's really good on the ears.

487
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,619
Guys like Shibby are just hysterical. He's hilarious.

488
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:47,619
He's one of the funnier guys you could ever listen to.

489
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:49,619
Leptor is also in that category.

490
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:51,619
He's like funny, but he's skilled too,

491
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:53,990
so he's a good combination of both worlds.

492
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,990
And I really don't know what category I would fit into,

493
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,230
even if there is a category, but out of all those guys,

494
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,230
I think all of them bring something really, really good to the table.

495
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,230
And I think they're all good. I like them all.

496
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:07,369
How much meat do you eat with your hands?

497
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:10,819
Uh, none.

498
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:13,819
I don't really eat, like, bags of meat.

499
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:17,829
What is your favorite game of all time?

500
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:20,460
Easy question, easy answer.

501
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,630
Super Mario RPG.

502
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,809
Definitely the best game of all time, in my opinion.

503
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,809
Below that, it's probably Diablo 2.

504
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:29,809
Soon to be Diablo 3, I'm hoping.

505
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:33,289
And then below that, number 3 is probably...

506
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:35,660
You guys are gonna hate me.

507
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,900
World of Warcraft.

508
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
Wait, before you freak out,

509
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,069
the reason why World of Warcraft is in my top 3 favorite games of all time

510
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:47,069
is because the sheer amount of time I put into that game.

511
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:52,890
I put hundreds, thousands, thousands, and thousands of hours into World of Warcraft.

512
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,890
I don't play it anymore.

513
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,890
I haven't played World of Warcraft in probably a year.

514
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,059
And I'd never plan on going back.

515
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:01,059
I'm done with it. It's over.

516
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:05,059
But for a good six, five or six years, I was really, really into it.

517
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:07,059
Made a lot of friends on there.

518
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:09,059
Had a lot of good conversations, a lot of good raids.

519
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,500
It was a good time, so...

520
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Do I think the game is the most fun, the most balanced, the most interesting?

521
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,500
No, but it's definitely the most social, and I had a lot of fun on it.

522
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,059
So that's probably why.

523
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:22,420
Where are you or your parents from?

524
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,420
I think that means... I think what he's asking is where...

525
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,789
What's your nationality? I think is what he's saying.

526
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:31,029
My nationality is half Irish, half Polish.

527
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,029
My father is from Ireland, and my...

528
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:35,029
No, he's not from Ireland, but...

529
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:39,579
My father is Irish, and my mother is Polish, so...

530
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:42,519
How many push-ups can you do?

531
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,950
I've never really tried to max out my push-ups, but...

532
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:53,190
Normally I do 60 in three sets, so I'll do one 20, 20, 20, and that's pretty much what I do for push-ups, so...

533
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:59,880
As the scout, do you have urges to smash relatives in the face with a metallic baseball bat?

534
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
And or drink hallucinogenic fizzy drinks?

535
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,440
All the time.

536
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,640
All the time.

537
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Why make commentaries of Team Fortress 2?

538
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:17,339
Basically, Team Fortress 2 is one of the only games that I've been good enough at it,

539
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:19,339
where I could potentially join a competitive scene,

540
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:24,460
and I'm not really that good at most other games, I'm good at them,

541
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,460
but to the point where I could really be like a competitive, professional player,

542
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,700
I think Team Fortress 2 is the only game since...

543
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:36,000
I mean, there was a time in World of Warcraft where I played it for so long that I became very good at it,

544
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,539
but Team Fortress is definitely the only game where I have real professional competitive skills in,

545
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,539
and that's why I think it's my best game,

546
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:47,539
so I figured why not make commentaries on the game that you're good at, you know?

547
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:51,420
Time to wrap this up, guys, only one or two more questions, so...

548
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,420
Thank you all for putting your questions in, I'm sorry if I didn't answer your question,

549
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:01,420
just you gotta remember, you gotta realize there was about 150 questions that I had to answer or potentially answer,

550
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,420
and I didn't want this to go more than 30 or 40 minutes, cause people probably wouldn't even watch it, so...

551
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,420
I had to skim through, I had to cut the fat a little bit, so I'm sorry if your question did not get answered,

552
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,789
so let's wrap it up here.

553
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:16,440
Do you like Finnish people?

554
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,700
I don't have a problem with Finnish people, I...

555
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,700
They're just as good as anybody else, I think, there's nothing wrong with them.

556
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,859
What is your favorite element on the periodic table of elements?

557
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:32,299
Barium, baby, barium.

558
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:36,740
I don't even know what barium is or what it does, but barium.

559
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,170
That's gonna wrap it up, guys, thank you so much for inputting all your questions, it was a great time,

560
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,170
I'm so happy that you guys were that enthusiastic about it,

561
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,170
I didn't think I was gonna get more than maybe 30 or 40 questions,

562
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,170
because it is kinda tough to come up with a question for somebody,

563
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,170
so thank you all so much, there's a little bit of gameplay left,

564
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,170
some real funny stuff happens, I'm sorry that you guys couldn't see the whole event we had,

565
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,170
but like I said, it's just too long,

566
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:05,170
so enjoy the rest of it, and I'll see you guys next time, take care everybody.

567
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,859
No, throw it, throw your stupid jorati.

568
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:11,859
No, no, no, get this out of here, get that out of here.

569
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:14,160
Get the sentry out of here.

570
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,490
Alright, so ready?

571
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,490
Everyone line up, shoulder to shoulder.

572
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,500
Ready?

573
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Three, two, one, let go!

574
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,900
Dude, I got killed before I could even throw my anything out there.

575
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:47,109
Hey, I'm some dude, can you pick people who aren't?

576
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:53,109
Alright, now this is free for all.

577
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:10,309
You just crushed him.
