1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,710
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Shank 2 multiplayer first look, I guess you could call this.

2
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:21,210
The official release of Shank 2 was, I believe, today or last night, something like that.

3
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,210
And this game is a lot of fun. This game is awesome. So I suggest you try this game out. If you have never played it before, it's awesome.

4
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:34,509
Playing the multiplayer co-op survival mode with Italics, who's a good friend of mine. His link will be in the description.

5
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:40,509
So go check him out. He's a cool dude, a good friend of mine. So let's get this started. The live commentary is going to start right now.

6
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:45,899
I'm going to cut a little bit between some things, but enjoy guys and let me know what you think.

7
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,899
Yeah, we're going to have to explain how the game is played as well.

8
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,329
Yeah.

9
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:53,210
But you are. You're like a yellow jumpsuit.

10
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,210
I'm like Kill Bill.

11
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,210
That's what I was thinking actually.

12
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,210
Uma Thurman up in this biatch.

13
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:06,739
Yeah, so I guess for those of you that don't know what is going on right now, this is not Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

14
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:08,739
This is a...

15
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:11,980
Doesn't it look like it? It kind of looks like Smash Bros.

16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,980
I guess Smash for the boat.

17
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,469
Yeah, we're on the boat. But this is the multiplayer.

18
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:23,780
And the multiplayer is you have to defend waves and waves. You have to defend against waves and waves of people.

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,780
And I'm assuming it's going to get increasingly difficult. So we shall see where this goes.

20
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,319
We got to defend these, yeah, these bombs here on the bottom.

21
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,069
This one up top too.

22
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:39,069
I kind of like this Uma Thurman.

23
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:41,069
I'm like shooting up into the air.

24
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,069
I'm like celebrating. I'm just like, yeah.

25
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:47,480
All right, wave one.

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,480
New item, tequila. Heal yourself.

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
Okay.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
I've got a fish.

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,920
Can you throw these things? I want to butcher somebody in the face.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,219
What do you have?

31
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:01,219
I have like a butcher knife. I want to throw it at somebody's face.

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,680
Oh no, get off that bomb. Oh God, this guy's going to get it.

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,680
Oh, we have one down there?

34
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,560
I keep overshooting it.

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,800
No, get off that. I got to do more grabs, man.

36
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Look at those combos piling up right there.

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I know, geez.

38
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,169
All right, we're good.

39
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:23,169
I'm going to go up top. You stay down there.

40
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:26,169
Because there's one up top. If that one goes down, we're in a lot of trouble.

41
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:32,409
It's a good idea. We get to split up, but watch for health too because you are getting close to dying.

42
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:34,409
Oh, there's a guy down here.

43
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,710
Oh, disarm that bomb.

44
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,710
Got it, I got it. I'm disarming. Cutting the wire, cutting the red wire.

45
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,710
That's right.

46
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,710
How much money do I have?

47
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,710
Got to buy some tequila.

48
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,009
Yeah, this girl has like minus 25% health or something.

49
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:48,319
Probably wasn't a great idea to do that.

50
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,319
What is that on the ground next to you flashing?

51
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,319
I think it's a pizza.

52
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,319
What is this? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?

53
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,319
Yeah, who wants a pizza?

54
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,319
I'll take pepperoni, onions, mushroom.

55
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,129
You can definitely throw, how do you throw these things?

56
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:05,129
I am about to die.

57
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,430
I'm up here like being an idiot. I've got to help you, hold on.

58
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,430
I'm retreating.

59
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,430
Don't worry, I've got this thing. It didn't even matter.

60
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,699
I'm doing the jump. No, get off this bomb.

61
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,699
Oh, he threw me off the boat.

62
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:21,699
Are you dead?

63
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:22,699
No, I'm still alive, barely.

64
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:26,699
Oh my god, I am going to die. I'm staying back to my range.

65
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:27,699
I'm dead.

66
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:30,699
No, I'm okay. I'm alright, I'm good. I'll revive you.

67
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,699
I've got to use some skills here.

68
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:35,710
Come on, come on!

69
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,710
Nice.

70
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,710
Got it, we got it.

71
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,509
Oh, I'm down now, I'm down.

72
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:43,509
Oh, it's right bumper. Right bumper is how you throw stuff.

73
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:45,680
You need a heal, sir.

74
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Oh my god!

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
You hop into the...

76
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
No, I just jumped down like an idiot.

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
I'm going to try to lead him up here.

78
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Come on.

79
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,819
Oh, come on big man.

80
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,819
Alright, revive.

81
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,819
Get out of there, just run.

82
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,819
Leave my friend alone.

83
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,439
Oh god, I'm running.

84
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,439
I'm dead, I'm dead.

85
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,740
Alright, I'm going to shop shoot him.

86
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,370
I got him caught like in a glitch.

87
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,370
Okay, yeah, come on, follow me over here.

88
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,120
That's right.

89
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Fell right into my trap.

90
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
There you go, alright, sweet.

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,550
Oh my god.

92
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,550
I've got to use more range.

93
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,550
Get him under the boat and I'll drop the boat on him.

94
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,550
Nice, nice.

95
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,920
I'm at low health again.

96
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,100
No, I missed that.

97
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Oh my god, I'm dead.

98
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Oh, escape!

99
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,100
I barely escaped.

100
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,300
Oh my god, he can run?

101
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
You're not going to call him a boar, are you?

102
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
I really want to.

103
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
I have enough money.

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm going to do it.

105
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Here we go.

106
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Alright, let's see what it does.

107
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Battle boar.

108
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
That is battle boar right there.

109
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
He's defending this crate.

110
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Oh, that wasn't a total waste of money.

111
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Oh no, oh, there he goes.

112
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,779
Just sit back here and unload.

113
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:00,079
Oh, look at that.

114
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,079
It's going to be sad when that pet dies.

115
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,079
I think he just died.

116
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,079
Oh my god, I'm going to get back broken.

117
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,220
Whoa.

118
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,220
Just going to shoot in the air.

119
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,220
We almost got him.

120
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,220
We almost got him, yes.

121
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,220
Nice, get that money.

122
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,519
Alright, buy some tequila.

123
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,519
Buy some tequila.

124
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,519
Decoy.

125
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,519
Dammit, I'm trying to turn on the fire.

126
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,519
Man, this guy is annoying me.

127
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,519
He's got like this grenade launcher.

128
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,680
There we go.

129
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
I can't aim.

130
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
I can't aim.

131
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,680
I'm just trying to shoot him from afar now.

132
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
It's like shooting up in the air for some reason.

133
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Pounce.

134
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Get pounced.

135
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
Wait, you can use this thing?

136
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
I can use this thing.

137
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
This grenade launcher.

138
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,980
That's what I was trying to use, but it was just shooting up in the air.

139
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,980
We have one to defuse up here.

140
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,980
Oh, come on.

141
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,980
Two defused.

142
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,980
I'm defusing this one.

143
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,279
Uh oh.

144
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,279
I got one.

145
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,930
There's another one up here.

146
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,930
No.

147
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,389
Alright, I'm defusing it.

148
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,689
They're planning down there below again.

149
00:05:57,689 --> 00:05:59,689
Oh god, come on now.

150
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,000
Get lit.

151
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,560
I got this one.

152
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Alright, I'm defusing this one.

153
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
We're good.

154
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
That is teamwork right there.

155
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
That is teamwork.

156
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,560
I wish you could high five in this game because we totally would.

157
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Yeah, be a little bit more like Portal 2.

158
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,120
Okay, I still got shots in this thing.

159
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,480
I'm just going to fire and spam them.

160
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,779
We're going to give you all the ranged guns since you have the controller.

161
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,779
Yeah, I am the one with the controller.

162
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:30,470
Uh oh, fire, fire.

163
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,470
Get out of there.

164
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,470
Alright, I prevented this.

165
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,470
Oh, I blew up.

166
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,470
They got the top one.

167
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,470
Oh, they got it?

168
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,470
I didn't even know it got planted on.

169
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,399
Alright, the guy below is planting.

170
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,399
Not for long.

171
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,769
Oh, I kicked him right off.

172
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,769
I just totally missed every single time.

173
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:49,459
I'm about to go down again, I think.

174
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,459
Oh, no, no, no.

175
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,759
Not if I bring out Battle Boar.

176
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,759
Awesome.

177
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,759
Alright, there's another bomb engineer.

178
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,759
Alright, we can leave the bottom floor now and focus on the middle and top.

179
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,759
Because Steve the Battle Boar is taking people out.

180
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,759
Quick, you've got no time.

181
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,759
Heavy attacks, man.

182
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,759
2,000 bucks.

183
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,759
I don't get that kind of cash.

184
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,300
Oh, they've got riot shields.

185
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
What is this?

186
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Oh, is this Call of Duty?

187
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,920
Uh oh.

188
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
They've got like Call of Duty riot shields.

189
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
They're planting.

190
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,220
Oh, God.

191
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,220
Is he planting?

192
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,220
He planted.

193
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,220
I can't get up there.

194
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,589
Here we go.

195
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,220
Alright, I'm defusing.

196
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,220
Oh, God.

197
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,220
Oh, no.

198
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,220
This could be the end.

199
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
I'm just throwing grenades.

200
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,220
I don't even know where they're going.

201
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,220
I'm down.

202
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,220
No, no.

203
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,220
Diffuse it.

204
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,220
I got you.

205
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,220
I got you back.

206
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,220
I got it.

207
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,220
That is clutch.

208
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,220
Clutch right there.

209
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,220
We're about dead.

210
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,220
Oh, yeah?

211
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,389
Turret.

212
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:48,389
I just built it.

213
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:49,389
I am dead.

214
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:50,629
What is it doing?

215
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:51,629
The turret's not doing anything.

216
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:52,629
Oh, there we go.

217
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:53,629
There we go.

218
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,240
It's doing something now.

219
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
I need to revive down here.

220
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,540
Oh, I can't even get down there.

221
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,230
Oh, my God.

222
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,230
I just jumped it.

223
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,230
I'm so confused right now.

224
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,230
You still got this.

225
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,230
No, I'm dead.

226
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,230
Maybe we are dead.

227
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,230
We just lost it.

228
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,230
Wave 15.

229
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,230
That was wave 15.

230
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,230
Wave 15.

231
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,230
That was pretty good.

232
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,529
That was pretty solid right there.

233
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,899
Man, that's embarrassing.

234
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,899
Money earned 10,000 to 4,000.

235
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:23,899
I got seven disarms though.

236
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,199
Hey, I do have the controller though.

237
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,199
Let's be fair.

238
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,199
Do what you do.
