1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:20,089
Oh, don't worry, we can do it. What does that look like?

2
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,969
Oh, do you need some help? Don't worry, I'll help you.

3
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:35,350
Hey, what is going on guys? Welcome to my first ever quest tutorial video.

4
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,270
And what's going to happen here is we're going to teach you how to do a quest.

5
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,030
The most important thing in this is you want to get the quest, which is really easy.

6
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,229
There's a quest giver around the world. So after you get the quest, you do the quest,

7
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:51,750
and then you complete the quest. And that's really all there is to it.

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,149
Quest.

9
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:54,950
The thing in this game is really, really fun and interesting.

10
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,070
Quest, quest, quest, quest, get the quest.

11
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:08,250
What a beautiful land this is, wouldn't you say?

12
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,180
The sights, the sounds, the smells.

13
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,180
Oldham is full of treasures, my friend.

14
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,799
Treasure. I like that.

15
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,599
Yeah, some are easy for even simple men to discern, while others require wisdom to see.

16
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,140
Ah, what the hell am I doing? I can see that, oh, why am I doing this?

17
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,760
I knew that for that last one, you were literally just going to do what you did and just shout.

18
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,359
Well, no, because on my screen, I'm sitting next to this guy,

19
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,159
and he's telling me his life story, and I just don't care.

20
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:00,040
Well, not that I don't care, my character doesn't care.

21
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,519
At least he would. He's sitting here like stone.

22
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,139
Dude, when you see this video, look at my guy's hands.

23
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,860
He is like, he's sitting there like he's holding on.

24
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,060
Dude, it looks ridiculous.

25
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:17,509
My guy's hands.

26
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,120
Oh, he's like, it looks like he's got broken arms and he's in casts.

27
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,129
What?

28
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,650
This is a bumpy ride, by the way.

29
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,409
Who's manning this son of a bitch?

30
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,099
Okay, so they're weakened.

31
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:31,750
They're weak.

32
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:35,300
Oh, man.

33
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,889
And it only took like an hour and 10 minutes.

34
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,250
All right, you better queue up.

35
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,449
Hit that button.

36
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,069
Oh, you son of a bitch.

37
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,020
This guy better queue up or I'm going to be pissed.

38
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:53,669
It's probably the same guy.

39
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,659
Oh, thank God.

40
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,180
I was about to freak out.

41
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,120
Hey, look at that.

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,590
Where the hell are we?

43
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,909
Grim Batol.

44
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:12,090
Oh, our healer lagged out.

45
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,289
Oh, joy.

46
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,539
Look at this face of disappointment.

47
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,930
He is disappointed right now.

48
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,530
When the hell did I make my guy look this ugly?

49
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,330
He looks like Santa Claus Hulk Hogan right now.

50
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,530
When the hell did I do this?

51
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,590
Hello.

52
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:38,009
Hey, sorry I can't get in.

53
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,409
How?

54
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:43,349
He says I need to do the stupid quest before I'm allowed in.

55
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,189
What?

56
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:47,099
You can run?

57
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:50,599
Really?

58
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,069
Yeah.

59
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,509
Jesus.

60
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,550
Okay.

61
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:58,419
But you could get in this one without the quest.

62
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,300
Yeah.

63
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:06,629
Oh, and here we go.

64
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,789
This is the journey.

65
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,629
This is what it all comes down to.

66
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:12,389
That guy is huge, man.

67
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,430
Can I just...

68
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,459
I'm going to start attacking this guy.

69
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,540
Oh, that guy died.

70
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,329
I killed one of those marines.

71
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,459
I have to fight this guy?

72
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,540
How the hell am I going to fight this guy by myself?

73
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,540
I think those marines helped me.

74
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,810
Let's hope so.

75
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,329
Come on, you.

76
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:39,019
Don't worry.

77
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:39,740
I got my dogs.

78
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,500
Whoa, lasers everywhere.

79
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,000
Get him.

80
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,040
Get him.

81
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,439
Kill this son of a bitch.

82
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:46,759
Kill him.

83
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,079
Everything you got.

84
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,720
Heroism.

85
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,639
Super bomb move.

86
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,019
Oh, man.

87
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:56,420
Oh, man.

88
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,980
Intense battle sequence.

89
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,939
Get behind the colossus.

90
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,269
All right.

91
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:08,470
He did like a super smash.

92
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,410
This guy is toast.

93
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:11,689
Are you kidding me?

94
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,920
This guy is toast.

95
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,360
He is really, really cool looking, though.

96
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,879
I will say this is one of the coolest things

97
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,160
I've seen so far in the zone.

98
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,360
Ow.

99
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,420
Bitch.

100
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,779
Oh, and that's it.

101
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:29,180
See you.

102
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,610
See you later, dude.

103
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,939
Why is he not dying?

104
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:35,699
Oh.

105
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,019
He needs like two more DPS done.

106
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:40,579
I did it.

107
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,410
Wait, these guys are attacking me now.

108
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,769
Oh, no, they're not.

109
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,899
I'm wrong.

110
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,139
No, I can't use any of it.

111
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,120
I'm just going to take away.

112
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,480
What's the most expensive thing?

113
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,100
This.

114
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,339
Why?

115
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:57,430
Not very much.

116
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,069
Oh, oh, I did it.

117
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:02,889
I did all the quests.

118
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,399
I am the quest master.

119
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,480
I am the master of the quests.

120
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,300
And you cannot defeat me.
