00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,050
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 Smithsmas 2012 update.

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,750
Now, this is not going to cover any of the man versus machine stuff.

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,949
Just want to talk about the new items, the new weapons that could put into play in Team Fortress 2 with this update.

4
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,649
And they are going to start as follows. I'm going to go through three of them. It was only three.

5
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:31,750
I know a lot of us are kind of like, oh, what the hell, man? I want like ten new items.

6
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:35,049
But these items are pretty substantial.

7
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:41,250
These are not just reskins of a weapon or just one little stat that was added to like, you know, a shovel or something like that.

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,149
These are very substantial, very interesting items in their own.

9
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:50,780
It's going to take a while to explain at least one of them, which is the first one we're going to talk about, and that is the Vaccinator.

10
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,079
So without confusing you guys, the text on the screen right now is probably going to be pretty confusing.

11
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,579
Now, let me, without reading a ton of the text and trying to, you know, read you the stats and all that, let me just say what this thing does.

12
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,879
This is a specific uber-charging medigun.

13
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,879
What that means is that it's going to protect people from specific types of damage.

14
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,780
So me healing this heavy right now, just without the uber, me and him take 10% less bullet damage.

15
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,680
That's stuff like the Scout Scouter Gun. That's the minigun.

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,409
Stuff that is actually classified as a bullet, we take 10% less of.

17
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:33,010
Now, I can change that. I can change it from bullet damage to blast damage or fire damage with the number 4.

18
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,909
I believe it defaults to number 4 is how you switch this.

19
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:38,510
So let's say I hit number 4 right now.

20
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,209
I'm going to switch over to blast damage.

21
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:43,010
If I hit 4 again, I'm going to switch over to fire damage.

22
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,709
10%, it never changes from 10%.

23
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:48,109
We both just take 10% less damage.

24
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,609
Now, let's talk about the uber-charge.

25
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:53,310
This is where it gets a little bit crazy and a little bit weird.

26
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,010
If you look in the lower right, there are four squares there, four different quadrants.

27
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,609
Each one of those is a two second uber.

28
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:03,810
You don't have to use the whole uber.

29
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,810
We've been waiting for something like this for a long time.

30
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,210
I remember people talking about in the comments, like a year ago on one of my minigun videos,

31
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,710
talking about how cool it would be to have an uber that you could use halfway through.

32
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,610
Like, oh, I filled my uber up to 20%.

33
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,509
I can use 20% of that uber.

34
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,610
They put that in the game now.

35
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,009
It's actually a thing.

36
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,810
So regardless of how many quadrants you have filled,

37
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,289
you can either use one of them, two of them, or all of them.

38
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:31,189
You can use all four by holding down the right click,

39
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:34,889
or you can just right click one time and just suck down one of those quadrants.

40
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,990
So here is what the uber-charge actually does.

41
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,389
When you uber-charge, you probably have seen it already on the screen.

42
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:41,789
It's going to put somebody in a little bubble.

43
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:43,490
They do not, it's not invincibility.

44
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,889
It is not invincibility.

45
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:47,389
What happens is, whatever you have selected,

46
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:50,789
whether that's bullet damage, fire damage, or blast damage,

47
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:56,189
you and that person are going to take 75%, not 10%,

48
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:01,889
75% less damage of that damage type until you're done ubering them

49
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,189
or you change to a different target.

50
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:07,889
Also, on top of this, while you are uber-charging somebody,

51
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,490
whatever you have selected for the resistance,

52
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,590
let's say you have the bullet damage selected.

53
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,689
If your target is taking bullet damage,

54
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:18,090
you get healed for 25% of that incoming bullet damage

55
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,870
while they are uber-charged.

56
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,569
And talking about just pure stats,

57
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,770
this thing has a 50% faster uber-charge rate,

58
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,870
which means you'll be getting charges more often.

59
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,270
But, and this is a pretty big deal because it's not the quick fix.

60
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,969
This is not the quick fix.

61
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:37,009
It can do overhealing, but it overheals 66% slower.

62
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,909
There's a lot going on with this gun.

63
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:40,610
There's a lot going on with this Medigun.

64
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,710
And hopefully, I could break it down a little bit for you there

65
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,409
and go play with it, go have fun with it, guys.

66
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:47,009
This thing is crazy.

67
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,610
But now, let's move on to the next thing.

68
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,800
Let's move on to the Demoman's new grenade launcher, the Loose Cannon.

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,900
So this thing is a primary slot replacement,

70
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,699
and I guess I can describe this in one way.

71
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:01,800
It's the baby of two items that are already in this game.

72
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,900
If you know the Detonator from the Pyro

73
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,099
and the Beggar's Bazooka from the Soldier,

74
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,599
they got together and had a kid.

75
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,199
It's this. This is the Beggar's Bazooka Detonator.

76
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,199
If that makes any sense at all, let me try to explain.

77
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,099
So the thing shoots cannonballs first off the bat.

78
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,899
Let's just say that. That's awesome.

79
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,399
And they roll around.

80
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,899
Now, if a cannonball hits the ground,

81
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:25,199
it's going to do 50% less damage than if it was not on the ground.

82
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
So anytime you hit a surface or you hit the ground,

83
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,699
it's going to do a lot less damage.

84
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,100
But if you hit somebody with the cannonball,

85
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,500
it can go through people.

86
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,399
You can actually hit people with the cannonball,

87
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,300
and it'll go through a line of people.

88
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,100
It also knocks people around,

89
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,600
and you can detonate this thing in the air.

90
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,899
That's what I talked about the Detonator and the Beggar's Bazooka.

91
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,699
Because you hold the button down,

92
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
and on the lower right, you're going to see a bar.

93
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,100
When that bar gets to be about 50% or 30% of the way you let go,

94
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,600
the thing is going to detonate somewhere in the air,

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,699
depending how long you held it down for.

96
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,000
Now, it can blow up in your face.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,699
That's where the Beggar's Bazooka comes in.

98
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,399
If you hold it down too long,

99
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,699
it's just going to blow up in your face and you're going to take damage.

100
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:09,899
But it's very, very fun to try and knock people around with this thing,

101
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,399
and shoot this into a hallway with a bunch of people,

102
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,000
you're going to knock it into so many people

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
because the cannonball does damage.

104
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,899
So, I don't know right now how this weapon is going to, you know,

105
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:21,800
be on the list of are these things worth equipping,

106
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,699
but it's pretty fun.

107
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,089
I will tell you right now, it's very, very fun just to play around with.

108
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:29,389
So, let's move on to the third and last weapon of this update,

109
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:33,089
and it is the Rescue Ranger, probably my favorite one so far,

110
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:37,790
because it answers the prayers of a lot of big Sentry Engineer users,

111
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,689
and that is, I wish I could move away from my Sentry Nest

112
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,089
and not have to worry about everything exploding

113
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,490
and all my work being thrown down the toilet.

114
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,089
What this thing does, it's a ranged Sentry Healer.

115
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:54,389
Not only is it a projectile shotgun, but it's a ranged Sentry Healer.

116
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,589
It's going to heal your Sentry from any range,

117
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,990
you could be 5,000 feet down the road or right next to it,

118
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,889
you shoot it with the shotgun a couple times,

119
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,389
bada bing bada boom, your Sentry is healed.

120
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,990
Now, it's very, very, very important to say this,

121
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,689
this is not going to replenish ammo into your Sentry or rockets,

122
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:14,889
and this will not remove sappers.

123
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:15,990
That's a big deal.

124
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,689
So, this thing cannot remove sappers or replace ammo into your gun,

125
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,689
it can only heal the Sentry.

126
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:25,189
So, is this thing worth putting on?

127
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:28,689
I'm going to say absolutely yes, because I didn't even talk about the second

128
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:32,120
and probably the best feature of this item.

129
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,920
This allows you to pick up your Sentry gun from anywhere on the map,

130
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,319
as long as you can see the damn Sentry gun.

131
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,920
So, I can be standing all the way across Dust Bowl,

132
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,420
and right-click and teleport the Sentry into my hands.

133
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,420
Now, when you do that, you are going to be marked for death,

134
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,019
but it's a huge upside.

135
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:56,720
That's not even really a downside to me, in my opinion,

136
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,319
because you can get your Sentry gun out of so much trouble.

137
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,120
If you see somebody coming around the corner,

138
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
if you know the thing is going to die,

139
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,319
you can teleport it to you and run backwards back to the next point

140
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,720
or back to the next checkpoint for the payload cart.

141
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,319
It is unbelievable.

142
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:13,620
It does take 130 metal to do that, but my goodness gracious,

143
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,120
that is one of the coolest things I've ever seen in this game.

144
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,220
So, yes, I'm going to say absolutely go try this and go put it on.

145
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,120
And the downsides, the real downsides of this item

146
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,600
are lower clip size and lower maximum ammo capacity.

147
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,699
Like, who cares?

148
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,180
Like, this thing is ridiculous. Go put it on.

149
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,379
So, that is going to wrap up this video, guys.

150
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:35,879
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

151
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,779
And stay tuned for the Man vs. Machine counterpart

152
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:41,980
of this update little series on Smith's Miss 2012

153
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,379
coming in the next couple of days.

154
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,680
So, I'll see you guys all soon.

155
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
And of course, take care everybody.

156
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,879
Have fun with the new weapons.
