1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,130
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Galactic Fantasy Prelude.

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,129
Now before anybody says, oh my god, what the hell is this game? I've never heard of this. I'm outta here.

3
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:23,129
Just bear with me for a second. Maybe you saw the title. This is not gonna be a gameplay commentary of this game.

4
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:30,129
I'm not gonna talk about this game really at all, besides the fact of one very specific detail that of course is very, very important.

5
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:35,130
I'm in this game. I am a voice actor in this game. I have almost a hundred lines.

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,130
And that's gonna be the discussion and the topic of this video. I'm gonna talk about voice acting.

7
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,630
I'm gonna talk about my voice acting, quote, career, if you could even call it that, and that sort of stuff.

8
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:50,130
So before I say anything about voice acting or the gameplay or anything like that in general,

9
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:55,130
the link in the description is gonna take you to the iTunes store for this game.

10
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,000
This is not a PC game. This is not a console game. This is an iOS game.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,500
So it's gonna be on your iPhone, your iPad, and I don't think it's on Android.

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,180
But it could be. I could be completely wrong with that. But the iTunes link is gonna be there.

13
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,180
And yeah, I'm in this game. I voice acted the whole thing as the character Matt.

14
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,420
So you are free to go download that. It's, I believe, 99 cents for the iPhone version.

15
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,920
And you'll hear me talk through the course of the game as you play through.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,420
It's got a whole storyline. It's got a beginning, middle, and end.

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,420
I'm not sure how difficult the game is. I know it's a very, very intense shooting kind of RPG type game.

18
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,420
So I don't know if you can blow right through the game in 15 minutes.

19
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,920
It's probably gonna take you a while to hear all my lines, if that's what you're playing the game for.

20
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,420
But it is there in the description nonetheless.

21
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,980
So let's actually take a listen to a couple of lines that I have,

22
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,480
just so you can see and kind of hear what's going on.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,480
I'm not gonna do too many. I'm just gonna do maybe one or two lines in a row.

24
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,480
And we'll get back to the meat and potatoes of this video,

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,980
which is gonna be my story, I guess, of how I got to this position,

26
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,480
how I got to do this game, and other various things like that.

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Because I'm so passionate about voice acting, guys.

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,980
I've been doing it for a long time, off and on, doing flash cartoons, doing little stuff like this.

29
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,980
And I'm so passionate about this, and I see comments all the time telling me,

30
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,979
Jerma, you have so many voices, you do so many characters,

31
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,479
you gotta try to get into voice acting.

32
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,479
And I would love to answer these type of questions and these comments in a Q&A video.

33
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,979
But there's just so much to talk about, and there's such a big backstory with this,

34
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,979
that it has to be its own video.

35
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:25,979
I would never be comfortable doing this in like a two-minute question and answer period.

36
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,280
So without further ado, let's get started here.

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,780
I'm gonna show you a couple of clips back-to-back, as me as the character Matt.

38
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,280
And when we get back, we shall talk about some more stuff, so enjoy, guys.

39
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,439
I see.

40
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,439
Buy some plutonium right away.

41
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,439
Set a course for Abaddon Starport.

42
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,759
Send a communication to Freeport authorities.

43
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,259
Tell them what happened here, and get them to send rescue shuttles immediately.

44
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:18,259
Having a pirate call the authorities?

45
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:20,259
You know, irony aside, we should move.

46
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:23,259
We're probably wanted men for stealing this ship already.

47
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,259
And I don't wanna be locked up for the rest of my life.

48
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,259
My family was killed by the slavers, so I have nowhere else to go.

49
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,759
May I join you?

50
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,960
I need to know for myself why this is happening.

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,460
Welcome back, everybody. Thank you for sticking around.

52
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,460
To listen to the backstory now of how I got into this sort of stuff, and why I got into it,

53
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,460
and how this has shaped this YouTube channel.

54
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,960
And if I did not get into voice acting when I did,

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,960
I probably would not have been even doing this YouTube channel.

56
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,960
I probably wouldn't even have attempted this YouTube channel.

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Well, let's back up. Let's go back to when I was a younger kid,

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,960
when I was probably like 10, 11, or 12 years old.

59
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
And that's imitating people.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,960
I used to sit around and just listen to my grandparents talk.

61
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,460
They used to have people come over for bridge.

62
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,139
If you were an old subscriber, you probably already know this story.

63
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,639
But I'll tell it again for those of you that might be new to the channel,

64
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,639
or might be a somewhat recent subscriber.

65
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,639
I used to sit there watching TV and listen to my grandparents have people over for bridge.

66
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,639
And there would be like 10 people over there, all yelling at each other,

67
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,639
all talking a bunch of trash, all trying to like figure out whose bet was what bet.

68
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,639
And I would just sit there and listen to them.

69
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,639
And I would be repeating their voices in my head over and over again.

70
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,639
And then when nobody was around, of course, I didn't just like walk up to the table

71
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,639
and was like, oh, hey, by the way, I'm going to like do all your voices in front of you.

72
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,639
When I was alone, I would just do them out loud and just laugh.

73
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,639
And it was pretty much just self-entertainment.

74
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,639
And I really truly think that if you are a voice actor,

75
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,139
or you want to get into voice acting, or you're one of those people

76
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:00,139
that can self-entertain yourself, that's where you start.

77
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,139
You kind of just make goofy faces in the mirror,

78
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:06,139
and you do goofy voices in the mirror, and you make yourself laugh.

79
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,139
And then eventually you take those ideas and you take those voices that you're doing,

80
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,139
and you do it to other people.

81
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:14,139
You do it to your friends, you do it to your other family members.

82
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,139
And they're like, how did you learn how to do that?

83
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,139
And you say, well, I just passed the time with it.

84
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,139
I just, you know, do it in the mirror, have fun.

85
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:23,139
I think it's funny. I mean, that's where everybody starts.

86
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,139
And the same thing with something like beatboxing as well.

87
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,139
I mean, I'm not the best beatboxer in the world,

88
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,139
but a lot of you guys that have heard me do random little beatboxes before,

89
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:32,139
I just did that for fun.

90
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:35,139
I would just sit there playing a video game and do it.

91
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,139
And I would do it all day.

92
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,139
And I would just eventually get good enough at it,

93
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,139
where I did it to other people, and they was like,

94
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,139
oh, geez, all right, cool, you can like kind of do that, that's cool.

95
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,139
And when I got to an older age, when I got to be,

96
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,379
maybe I'd say like 16, 17, or 18, right towards that college age,

97
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:52,379
I started talking to myself, and I'd say, you know,

98
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:54,550
what if I did this for a living?

99
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,550
What if I could really make these voices or make these things part of my everyday life

100
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,550
and try to entertain people, try to make people laugh as my job?

101
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,980
And it was around this point when I started to peruse the internet

102
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,980
for other people that potentially had the same interests as me

103
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,980
and try to find someplace to hang out with maybe other people

104
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,980
that were interested in voice acting and talking in general into a microphone.

105
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,980
And this is a real testament, guys, as to why the internet is truly a fantastic place.

106
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,160
Because without the internet, I don't think I would have ever,

107
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,160
ever tried to do any of this stuff or anything to do with talking into a microphone

108
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
or playing games and talking or voice acting.

109
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,339
Plus, on top of that, I've met some lifelong friends

110
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:37,339
from doing this whole voice acting thing and getting involved in the forums and stuff like that.

111
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:41,339
And it's pretty amazing to see because some of these guys are on Cartoon Network right now

112
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:44,339
doing voices for the primetime shows.

113
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,339
So it's amazing to know that, it's amazing to meet these people.

114
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:51,339
You're all starting in the same area, you're all trying to help each other out

115
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:53,339
and see where you guys are going to succeed.

116
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:55,339
And watching a lot of these people that I'm friends with

117
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,339
succeed to a level that they are right now,

118
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:00,339
not only is it a humbling thing to see that,

119
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:04,339
you just feel so good knowing that you have people that you've been friends with for a while

120
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:07,829
that have been trying so hard that are succeeding in something.

121
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:10,829
And talking about present day, moving on to where I am now,

122
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,829
doing this kind of talking into a microphone over gameplay

123
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:17,009
and doing even stuff like comedy videos and skit videos and stuff like that.

124
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,009
All the knowledge that I have gained from doing the voice acting thing for so long,

125
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:24,009
editing audio files, editing video files,

126
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,009
going to college and learning about production value

127
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,009
and learning all sorts of things, meeting more friends, meeting more people.

128
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:33,009
That's kind of how I got to right here, guys.

129
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:37,009
If I had never done any of these things, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you right now.

130
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,009
And I would say with the utmost bottom of my heart, complete sincerity,

131
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:45,009
if you have an idea or if you have something you've always wanted to try

132
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,009
and you never did it and maybe you're sitting on it right now,

133
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:54,009
stop right now, click this video, click pause on this goddamn video and go do it now.

134
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:57,009
Don't wait any longer, go do it now.

135
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,009
Because I've talked about this before, guys.

136
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:04,009
I spent years doing absolutely nothing.

137
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:06,009
And if I look back, I can look back to myself, my old self,

138
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,009
if I had a friggin' time machine, I would go back there

139
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,009
and I would kick myself in the ass so hard that I would have puked rainbows.

140
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:18,009
I would have made myself get off my ass and do stuff four or five years ago.

141
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:22,250
So take my advice on this, guys. If you have something you want to try, try it now.

142
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,250
Do it tonight. Start it tonight.

143
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,939
So that is going to wrap up the video, guys.

144
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,939
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

145
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:32,940
Again, link in the description for Galactic Fantasy Prelude.

146
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,940
And I will keep you guys up to date if I do any more voice acting

147
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,940
or if I do any more paid jobs, I guess, or if I'm in another video game or something like that.

148
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,940
I'll keep you guys in the loop.

149
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,940
So thank you again so much for watching. I'll see you guys all next time.

150
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,940
Of course, take care, everybody.
