00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:20,760
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Turma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Spy with the Ambassador, the Kunai, and the Dead Ringer.

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,059
My typical Spy setup, a lot of you guys know that. This video is going to discuss the Spy.

3
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:33,060
It's gonna be kind of a casual commentary, I'm gonna sit back and talk about things, relax, drink a few Dr. Peppers, you know, crack one open.

4
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,060
If I had one, I would, but I have one already open, so that joke does not exist because I can't make it.

5
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:44,429
But I want to talk about the old Spy. Those of you that will remember, and I don't know why I thought about this.

6
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:51,429
When I was getting this gameplay, I thought about it because there's a couple of instances where my knife comes down really quickly and I was like, you know what?

7
00:00:51,429 --> 00:01:02,090
Wasn't there a time when the Spy didn't have that? And there wasn't. For those of you that do not know, the Spy's backstab animation never was like this.

8
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,090
It was never this quick a few years ago. Actually, it was probably more than that.

9
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,090
But it was when the game came out. When the game came out, and maybe for like six, seven, eight months after the game came out,

10
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:18,459
the backstab animation took almost a full second to complete. You brought the knife up, and then you brought the knife down.

11
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:24,459
It was kind of slow in comparison to what it is right now, where it's almost a quarter of a second when you stab somebody.

12
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:33,459
It was much longer than that. I'm going to put a link in the description here of what it looks like compared to what it looks like now.

13
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:42,079
I'm old. Seriously. I thought about this, and this change happened when I was in college.

14
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,079
It's almost four or five years ago now that this change was made.

15
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,319
I remember sitting in my college dormitory and being like, oh wow, they changed the backstab animation.

16
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:59,989
I'm young and fun and young and good looking. Fast forward a little bit. I'm an old shithead.

17
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:06,989
I'm just sitting here drinking Dr. Pepper's five years later. I really can't even believe that it's been five years since that change.

18
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:13,990
This is also kind of around the time when they added the compression blast to the Pyro, because the Pyro never had the compression blast.

19
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:20,419
I'm just going through all these changes in my head and thinking to myself, if you were to tell me when I was in college,

20
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:24,919
all this stuff is going to be hats. There's going to be new backstab animations.

21
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,919
Pyro's going to have a thing that knocks people away with this compression blast.

22
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,159
If you told me all this stuff, I would say, what the hell are you talking about?

23
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:36,159
TF2 is just like a fun multiplayer game that I play online sometimes.

24
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:46,159
I would have never believed that this would have turned into the TF2 Hat Combat Simulation Virtual Reality Burger Boy 2012 Emperor of Earth.

25
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,159
I would never have been able to guess that.

26
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,849
So what's the point here? Why did I make this video? What's the point of me making this video?

27
00:02:53,849 --> 00:03:06,129
The point is, from right now, July 22nd, 2013, where is this game going to be five years from now?

28
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:16,610
In 2018, if TF2 still has an active community, if they're still making updates, or if TF3 comes out, what the hell are they going to do?

29
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,610
How are they going to change this game even more than they already have drastically done it?

30
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:26,610
And I don't think anyone will ever be able to foresee it, because nobody could foresee that there was going to be a hat economy.

31
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,610
Who the hell knew that was going to happen? Who in their right mind could have ever said that TF2 was going to have a hat economy?

32
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,039
What? What are you talking about?

33
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,039
And it interests me for a very specific reason.

34
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:43,280
It's because when you get older and you look back at the games that you've been playing,

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,280
and you look back at the games that have been out for a very long time, that have undergone huge, drastic changes,

36
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,949
and you can remember back to when the game was completely different,

37
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,949
it's kind of sad and kind of a little depressing, but it's cool at the same time,

38
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:01,949
because you get to see from the beginning of a game's life to where it's currently standing,

39
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:06,949
and you get to see all the changes, all the things that happened, and it sort of reminds me,

40
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:10,949
now we're going a little bit deeper here, but the console generations.

41
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,949
I've been alive long enough to see all the console generations,

42
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:23,949
all the way back from the Atari almost, the regular Nintendo, the whole Super Nintendo, N64, PlayStation 1,

43
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:27,949
all those generational changes. I've seen everything.

44
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:36,509
And it's crazy to think about Team Fortress 2 has gone through just about one and a half console generations.

45
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:42,509
I mean, it started during the midst of the Xbox 360 and the PS3, the prime of those two consoles,

46
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:46,509
2006, 2007, everybody had one, everyone was using one,

47
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:52,509
and we're going to go into the Xbox One and the PS4, and TF2 is still here, still actively played.

48
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:58,509
So it's done its own, in quotes, console generational leaps, if that makes any sense.

49
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:03,750
And I truly do wonder if TF2 eventually, if there is no TF3,

50
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:10,750
if they will do some type of source 2.0 port, because I'm sure a lot of you guys know the source engine,

51
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,750
the new source engine is currently being worked on.

52
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,750
So a world where we would see maybe another generational jump for this game, Team Fortress 2,

53
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,750
is a complete graphical reworking or a port to the new source engine.

54
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,750
I don't know if that's going to happen. It's obviously just wishful thinking at this point,

55
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,750
because who knows what Valve's going to do with this game.

56
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,750
Nobody knows, but that's really where I want to take this video.

57
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,750
I just want to wrap it up here, guys.

58
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,750
A quick little casual commentary about the spy and then transitioning,

59
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,750
kind of going off on a tangent about consoles and stuff, but that's going to wrap it up here.

60
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,750
I'll see you guys all next time. Thank you all so much for watching.

61
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,750
I really do appreciate it, and I'll see you guys all next time.

62
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,750
And of course, take care, everybody.
