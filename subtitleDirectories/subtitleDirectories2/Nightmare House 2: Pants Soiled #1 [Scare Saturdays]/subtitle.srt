00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,699
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Nightmare House 2 for Scare Saturdays.

2
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:22,859
Alright, let me put my headphones in now, at least in one of the ears.

3
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,859
This is Scare Saturdays, this is Nightmare House 2. This is a Half-Life 2 Episode 2 mod.

4
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,859
A lot of people get confused sometimes. You have to have Half-Life 2 Episode 2 to play this game.

5
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:37,859
It is free, the link will be in the description, all that good stuff.

6
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:44,280
And it's fairly long, too. This might take me at least 5 or 6 episodes to play through the whole thing.

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,280
Probably a little bit more. We will see how this goes.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,149
But, Nightmare House Prologue, I guess? Or should we just skip to Chapter 1?

9
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,539
Oh, we're skipping right to Chapter 1. Here we go, baby.

10
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:05,680
I probably shouldn't have done that. What if it was like, oh, this is the secret code you need to know to get into the first level?

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,500
I'm in my little cell here with my marshmallows on the sides.

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:19,590
Okay, it looks like the door. Is there anything in here I need to know?

13
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:32,180
Okay, Chapter 1 Rebirth. Should I just go this way?

14
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,700
This hallway is dark, so I'm assuming I just have to go this way.

15
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,989
Oh, my brain, you're hurting my brain with that. I can't open that door, let's just go.

16
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:49,329
Dive! Right off the bat, are you serious? The first second.

17
00:01:49,329 --> 00:02:05,200
Oh my god, come on, dude. I'm not calm. I never have been calm, I'm getting out of here.

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:16,539
Is there a run? Can I sprint? Anything over here? A lot of blood.

19
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:21,930
Wait, I just saw like a twinkle. I just saw a twinkle. What was that?

20
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:29,889
Do I have like a flashlight or something? I don't. Security room.

21
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:39,189
All right. That does not look good. There's the flashlight. That's what I wanted.

22
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:44,629
Hey, you're looking at it. It's me on a webcam. A webcam-ception.

23
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:58,580
Am I locked in this room right now? What the hell? How do I get out of here?

24
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:04,030
Oh, okay. Like I said, just remove the lock. Good to know.

25
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:19,650
Hey, I thought you turned the lock off, you B-I-T-C-H. Locked in, it seems.

26
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,689
Is the kitchen over here? Looks like it.

27
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:35,650
Oh, damn. Oh, man. Chef Boyardee had a bad day today.

28
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:43,099
Anything else in here? I got it. I got the axe, now what?

29
00:03:51,460 --> 00:04:06,300
Oh, god. Oh my- Is he dead now? Those bastards, man.

30
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:15,699
That seriously hurt my whole body. Oh, remember, I have an axe. Nobody can hurt me, I have an axe.

31
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:26,480
Oh, god. Which way do I go? I don't know where to go.

32
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:34,439
Oh, I don't like this game. God, no!

33
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:42,480
The bathroom is full of blood. That's disgusting. Can I break this? I can.

34
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,149
Any more cafeteria workers that are going to come out and punch me in the face?

35
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:55,750
Jump! Hooray. All right. Made it up.

36
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,870
I don't like vents. I do not like vents. Screw you, vents.

37
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,180
Something's going to just run right at me right now.

38
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,540
Don't look behind you. Don't look behind you. Don't look behind you.

39
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,360
Oh my god. Oh my god. I don't want to look behind me.

40
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,480
I did it anyways.

41
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:28,540
God damn.

42
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:34,959
Get me in this door. What's in here?

43
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:43,300
Hey, eat computer screen, whatever you are up there.

44
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,379
It's a button, I think. Come on, I'm pressing the buttons.

45
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:51,620
Oh, give me the gun. Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

46
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,750
Oh, for the love of god, please don't even tell me that something's going to jump through this door right now.

47
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,990
What the hell?

48
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,740
Oh, why did I shot the screen?

49
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,370
I shot at the screen.

50
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:15,699
Okay.

51
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:25,170
I'm losing my brain here.

52
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:33,290
All right, well, I'm going to shoot the absolute crap out of anything that comes near me.

53
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,290
If that guy comes near me, he's going to die. Hope he knows that.

54
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,490
Get me out of here.

55
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,920
Unlock the door. You said you're going to...

56
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:53,139
What the hell is that?

57
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,139
Where's my flashlight? Where's my flashlight?

58
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,670
Die, bitch.

59
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,670
Oh, god. Oh, god.

60
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,670
I just wasted like 10 rounds.

61
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:22,199
God, this game is tough to play.

62
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:34,139
All right, well, chapter two.

63
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,139
I think I might call it right here for this episode.

64
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:45,459
Oh, come on. I was about to say goodbye.

65
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,459
All right. Oh, my god.

66
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:54,579
Am I falling right now? Where am I going?

67
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:58,810
I need the axe.

68
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,759
Dude, dude, come on.

69
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,759
Okay, so how am I falling up?

70
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,139
God damn.

71
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,779
Okay, I will see you.

72
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,779
What the hell is going on with this frigging elevator?

73
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:29,050
All right.

74
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,049
So I'll see you guys. I'll see you guys all next time for chapter two.

75
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,049
And take care, everybody. I'll see you all soon. Bye.

76
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,049
Peace, love, resp...

77
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,049
Bye.
