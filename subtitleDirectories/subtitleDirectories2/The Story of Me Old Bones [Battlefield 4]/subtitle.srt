1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:10,970
To the left, to the right, to the behind.

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,970
Oh dude, I got killed by a parachuting man.

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,970
Wow, that guy just got destroyed.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,969
Oh my god, there's people everywhere.

5
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:18,969
I don't even know. Guy that just parachuted in.

6
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,969
Didn't kill him.

7
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:22,969
It's okay. I'm pinned down here.

8
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:24,969
I'm pinned down here.

9
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:27,210
What killed me?

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,210
You're telling me that some motherfucker on the roof just killed me?

11
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,210
Somebody on the roof.

12
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,210
Except for Vibe, yes. No, I'm dead again.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,210
He shot me again from the same spot.

14
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,210
He's up on the roof, he's like on the corner.

15
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,210
He's like fucking Spider-Man.

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,210
Get rid of that guy.

17
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,210
I don't know what corner you're talking about.

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,210
He's on like the roof of the building, like one of the highest buildings.

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,210
Spawn on me, then shoot at him.

20
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,210
Alright, fine. Spawning on you, shooting at Spider-Man.

21
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,899
Confirm Spider-Man, get him.

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,899
We're never gonna hit this guy.

23
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,899
Dude, this is the one time I spawned without a sniper rifle.

24
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:59,929
And I just got...

25
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:03,929
Oh, it was a long storm on that one fateful day.

26
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,299
Did I ever tell thee the story of me old bones?

27
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,299
Do we keep going under the water?

28
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:12,980
Yeah, we do.

29
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,549
Let me tell you the story of me old bones.

30
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:20,549
There was a time in a pirate's life.

31
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,549
When we didn't have such old bones.

32
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,239
And that time, well you ran out of bullets, didn't you?

33
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:36,390
So, are we defending this?

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,849
Okay.

35
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,409
The house just...

36
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,409
I did that.

37
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,409
Did you seriously just do that?

38
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,840
I spent the last minute looking for a spawn beacon that was placed there.

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Couldn't find it.

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
Honestly, I didn't even know what just happened.

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
I felt like somebody just put a flash in my face.

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,840
And I teleported to the past.

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,640
How do I get a better view?

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
I don't know.

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,639
I need a better view of this.

46
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,639
I fucking jumped out.

47
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,639
I swear to God, dude.

48
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,639
Why am I floating?

49
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,639
I'm flying into the air.

50
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,879
I'm going to heaven.

51
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,419
I'm going to heaven. God has chosen me.

52
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,919
Let me tell you the story of me old bones.

53
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,919
Did you just never tell the story?

54
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,919
You just keep saying it.

55
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,919
Let me tell you an old story of me old bones.

56
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,919
I want to hear the story.

57
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:43,099
One time me old bones shot twelve people in one second.

58
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,099
Like you just saw right there.

59
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:49,530
And then me old bones were buried.

60
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,090
In the graveyard.

61
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,460
Behind your old bones.

62
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,460
Once again, I guess we're going to have another German video where you don't even play the game.

63
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,340
I'm kicking ass right now.

64
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,340
And your bones, whatever.

65
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,340
And then he turned the corner.

66
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,340
And he shot some more old bones.

67
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,830
And he got another kill.

68
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,969
And then another boat came over.

69
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:18,969
And he killed all their bones as well.

70
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,969
And blew up the fucking boat.

71
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,810
See how I was seven and ten?

72
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:31,300
I got my only seven kills in that fifteen to thirty seconds when I was doing the old bones thing at the end.

73
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,300
You were doing it for like eight minutes.

74
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,960
Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.

75
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,960
You just like stumped your balls in my face.

76
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Blub blub blub blub.

77
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
You see what I mean?

78
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Yeah, you just did.

79
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Did I just drown?

80
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
No, I didn't.

81
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,139
No, I just want to go swimming.

82
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,139
I just want to go swimming in grandma's lake.

83
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,699
No!

84
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,699
Grandma's lake, the ocean you mean?

85
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,699
No, grandma's lake. She's a rich bitch.

86
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:10,840
What am I supposed to be even shooting here?

87
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,170
Please don't drive us into like the dish from Cable Guy.

88
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,540
No, this is the ending scene from 007, Goldeneye.

89
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,540
Ah, this is the ending scene from Cable Guy as well.

90
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,540
Who's this dude with a blowtorch?

91
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,480
Some guy, something tells me buddy.

92
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
You're not going to hit anybody with a blowtorch.

93
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,480
What are you doing? Stop spinning around in circles.

94
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,480
You're seriously fucking up my screen.

95
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,480
I'm out. See you later.

96
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,060
Goodbye.

97
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,060
Look up in the air at me.

98
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,060
What are you doing?

99
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,699
What are you doing?

100
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,149
You spin around in circles.

101
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:58,149
Blowtorch man, like trying to clean somebody's teeth.

102
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:03,339
Alright, let's go.

103
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,509
Deploy.

104
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,509
There he is, there he is.

105
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,819
Gotta land on the building and do the bros.

106
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:15,209
I'm not even close to landing on that building.

107
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:17,959
I'm like falling straight down.

108
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,350
Battlefield bros.

109
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,199
You just came out of the ground.

110
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:32,220
Now that we're in a plane.

111
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,220
I might as well tell you the story.

112
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,709
Of me old boys.

113
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:41,850
It was a dark and dreary night.

114
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,850
And me old boys were fucking on fire.

115
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,300
Sure, he's still alive.

116
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,660
That makes perfect sense.

117
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,339
I'm going.

118
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:04,660
This guy lying on the ground right here.

119
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,660
Why is this working?

120
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,660
I can't even see man.

121
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
You are messing up my camera.

122
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
It's trying to fix my camera.

123
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,660
My character is stuck in the I'm crawling forward animation.

124
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,100
I fell off.

125
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,870
Let me tell you a story about me old boys.

126
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,870
Let me tell you a story about me old boys.
