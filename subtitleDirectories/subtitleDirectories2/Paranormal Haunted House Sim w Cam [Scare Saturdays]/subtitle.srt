1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,460
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Paranormal.

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,460
Now this game is not out yet. This is in beta. Not even clo-

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,219
Okay, that like kinda scared me. The furnace just turned on.

4
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:27,219
Alright, anyways. This is in beta. It has a Kickstarter project. You can go in the link in the description.

5
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:33,219
And you can go support this guy. You can get this game right now. 30 bucks is gonna get you the beta.

6
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:38,219
So, you can check that out. That just threw me off my game. Let's just get going.

7
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:40,899
Let's begin.

8
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,140
So I guess the whole point of this game is you have a camera.

9
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:01,140
And you need to capture the hauntings, or you need to go walk around the house and film things that are going on.

10
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,140
So let's do this.

11
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,950
Okay. Left mouse to begin.

12
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,599
Enter the haunting in 3, 2, 1.

13
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,379
Oh my god.

14
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,450
Alright. So let's just start looking around.

15
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,540
Little doll. Hello!

16
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,500
I have a- What's opening?

17
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,819
What door is opening right now?

18
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:38,469
If there's monsters in this game, like if these little things come alive and start attacking me or something, I'm gonna flip out.

19
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:44,099
It's a kitchen.

20
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,920
So like I said, this has a Kickstarter project.

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,920
It's got a lot of money raised so far. It's actually pretty interesting.

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,099
Ah!

23
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:56,500
Oh, that's not so bad.

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,500
It's-

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,469
God!

26
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,469
That was the biggest scare so far out of any game I've played. That's a horror game.

27
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:15,150
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,150
What is that thing? What is that guy over there?

29
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,949
Is that guy gonna attack me?

30
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:26,259
Oh, come on. No way. What am I, stuck in the kitchen?

31
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:29,069
Turn this off.

32
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,139
Oh, my arm hurts right now from that scare.

33
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:40,539
What is making that buzzing like a- I feel like my phone is vibrating.

34
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:44,629
Like, seriously.

35
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:45,629
Stop it!

36
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:51,699
Can I go up here?

37
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,699
That, seriously, that noise needs to-

38
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,699
I'm gonna freak out.

39
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:58,699
Let's go upstairs.

40
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:00,699
Up the stairs we go.

41
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:09,219
To try and find the vibrating cell phone.

42
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,979
Oh, thanks.

43
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:13,979
Whoever's doing that.

44
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:20,120
Bedroom. Okay, so I have to sleep.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,860
Hi, Fit!

46
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,159
Did I just- Did I just take-

47
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,159
I didn't close that door.

48
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,159
Hey.

49
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,159
So, I'm assuming it's a new day. Camera is charged.

50
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,159
My fish are gone. Somebody stole them.

51
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,159
Which, that's just fantastic.

52
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,550
Get-

53
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

54
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,550
Close the door! Close the door!

55
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,039
Oh, damn.

56
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,659
Somebody was- Why am I not in the reflection?

57
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,180
That doesn't make any sense.

58
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,379
Dude, the beaver- Dude, somebody had a bad case of burritos.

59
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:05,379
I'll tell you that right now. That's not cool.

60
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,560
What kind of bathroom is this, by the way?

61
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
This guy has like a forest in his bathroom.

62
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,780
Painting in the bloody-

63
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,780
That's weird.

64
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,560
Do I even want to open this door?

65
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Is there gonna be like a dude here with like a-

66
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,180
Okay.

67
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,089
Let's go back downstairs.

68
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:28,089
Let's film some more happenings.

69
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:30,089
You little-

70
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,839
I'm gonna kick him down.

71
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:41,009
There's the phone again.

72
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,850
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

73
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,850
Wait, wait, wait.

74
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,850
God!

75
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:55,860
I'm running. I'm run, run, run, run, run, run.

76
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,860
Run down the stairs. Run down the stairs.

77
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,860
Why can't I move? I can't move.

78
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,860
I can't move right now.

79
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,860
What is that?

80
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
They're all-

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,100
I was just stuck.

82
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:14,850
God, come on!

83
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,850
Where's the-

84
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,750
Alright, I'm gonna find that damn phone,

85
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,750
and I'm gonna turn it off, and I'm gonna throw it.

86
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,750
There it is! There it is! There's the phone.

87
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,750
There's the phone.

88
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,850
I don't, like, answer the phone?

89
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,579
Is that a dog?

90
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,209
The phone didn't do anything.

91
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,339
What the hell?

92
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,339
At least I turned it off.

93
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,839
Alright, now I turned off that.

94
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,660
What's going on?

95
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,660
God damn!

96
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,660
I'm outta here.

97
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:59,550
I'm-

98
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,180
I'm getting the hell outta here.

99
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,180
I'm getting the hell outta here.

100
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,420
Can I, like, leave the house?

101
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,850
Alright, I've done. I finished. I got all I needed.

102
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,149
I recorded the monsters and the noises.

103
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,319
Ugh.

104
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,319
Let's, uh-

105
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,319
Let's call that- I can't do it anymore.

106
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,319
My brain is like-

107
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,529
Okay, that guy was not there before.

108
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:32,180
I'll see you guys all next time,

109
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,180
and go check this game out.

110
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,180
It is the-

111
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,180
It's got a Kickstarter project, like I said before.

112
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,180
And, yeah, that's gonna wrap it up.

113
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,180
First, we're gonna look outside, and yeah!

114
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,250
I thought that was a, uh-

115
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,250
What is that?

116
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,250
It's gone.

117
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,250
Alright, so take care, everybody.

118
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,250
I'll see you all soon.

119
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,250
Run away from this house!

120
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,089
Rest in peace, boy.

121
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,089
What?
