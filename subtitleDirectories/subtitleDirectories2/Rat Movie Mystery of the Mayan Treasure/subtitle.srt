1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,750
Rats, we're rats, we're the rats. We pray at night, we stalk at night, we're the rats.

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:22,750
I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,079
So sue me for being thorough. I want to know that you know what the plan is.

4
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,079
Look, seriously mate, how many artifacts do we need to steal before you trust me with these jobs?

5
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,079
Well, I just want to make sure you know what's happening. We're going to get the treasure, we're going to get out of there.

6
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,079
And we also have to...

7
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,079
We must get it. That's the most important thing. So be on your A-game. We go now.

8
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,280
I got to drive the car today because it's my birthday.

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,280
No, don't let him get in the car. Please don't let him.

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
Come on.

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
He's driving. Whatever.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,280
Bloody hell.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,280
Oi, more importantly, since when did we have a rat problem?

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,100
We don't. Get in.

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,099
Let's go. Speed it up.

16
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,099
Yeah, that's the speed I'm looking for. That's the type of fastness I want.

17
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,810
I don't even know where you're going at this point. We've been driving all night.

18
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,810
It's my birthday.

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,049
Hey, you... You're just... You're running over a guy right now.

20
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,420
Are you fucking serious?

21
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,450
I mean, next time we do this, I'll get my nan to drive.

22
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,590
Excuse me, sir. Yeah, you over the dancing. It's actually $10 to dance in this building. You're going to have to give me some...

23
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,590
Oh, I'm going to die!

24
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,590
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, may I have the attention of the class?

25
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,590
My name is Dick Dastardly Richard, and I'm here to take the treasure chest that's in the back room.

26
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,590
Go get it, boys. I'll follow you in.

27
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:59,590
And let me tell you something, clerk. If you so as move a muscle, I'll make sure you stay buried in that ground there.

28
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:07,079
Alright, let's go.

29
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,080
Alright, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. Is the treasure in there? Is it in there?

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Yep. It's all here.

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Oh, yes. Now that's what I like to hear. And now we are invincible.

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Not so fast.

33
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:27,080
You stand before Gerard, guardian of the treasure chest of the Mayan temple, and I will make sure to grab...

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Hey.

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Oh, fuck this. I'm off.

36
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Hey, what are you doing?

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,080
We're the rats. We pray at night, we stalk at night. We're the rats.

38
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Alright, yeah, that's cool. I like rats, nothing bad with rats, but let me tell you something.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Over my dead body are you getting this treasure.

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,080
Rats, rats, rats, rats, rats, rats.

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,080
Wow, look at that flock of birds over there. That reminds me of my favorite movie, The Movie.

42
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,080
That's your favorite movie, too, right?

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,080
No, my favorite movie is Frozen. I like Elsa and Anna. Okay, now I kill you.

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,419
I'd kill you.

45
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,900
Wow, that's great pick choice for a favorite of this movie.

46
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,620
I wonder if I have to think that now.

47
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,259
Now I get to be the giant rat.

48
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:16,629
Cool, surprise.

49
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,830
So you're trying to tell me that inside of this building

50
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,830
right here, there is a giant rat,

51
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,810
among other things, the giant pickles.

52
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,990
Did he say pickles?

53
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,830
Or am I putting that in there by myself?

54
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,830
Whatever, Sergeant Pickles is gonna go in here

55
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,669
and check it out.

56
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:29,909
We're gonna make sure everything's okay.

57
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,550
And give me some candy corn, too.

58
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,830
That's a weird request, I know, but just get it.

59
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,949
You guys are gonna drop it.

60
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,310
We're gonna be in big trouble.

61
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,550
So quit blushing around.

62
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,389
I hear somebody coming.

63
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,389
Somebody put it down, put it down.

64
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:40,229
Hey, get in.

65
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,770
Hello, sir.

66
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,289
Welcome to the Rat Cafe.

67
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:45,849
There's no rats here.

68
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,930
It's just hamburgers.

69
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,610
That would be real nice if that were true.

70
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,050
Except it isn't.

71
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,949
You're a rat, aren't you?

72
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,389
No, no, why would that happen?

73
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:57,229
That's not us.

74
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:58,990
We're just, we're just people.

75
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,030
And I'm gonna be taking you in.

76
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,349
And wouldn't it be funny if this were real?

77
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:04,469
I'm just kidding.

78
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:05,289
Be careful though.

79
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:07,509
There's apparently a giant rat around.

80
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:12,090
You have a good day, officer.

81
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,250
So, you figure anything out in there?

82
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,889
Nice, clean.

83
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,769
It's back to the drawing board.

84
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,769
Well, that's great.

85
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:19,730
I don't know how to draw,

86
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:32,670
so you're gonna have to do the drawing.

87
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,470
Sergeant Scritchy Scratch of the Cat Police reporting in.

88
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,149
You are now relieved of your duty.

89
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:38,990
Absolutely, Sergeant.

90
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,829
You've got it.

91
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:41,350
We'll be taking off now.

92
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,189
Thank you for your continued work.

93
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:44,029
Thank you.

94
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:47,300
Your duty will not go unnoticed.

95
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,500
What's that on you?

96
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,339
What?

97
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:50,939
Are you wearing a rat on your shoulder?

98
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:52,100
Why would I be wearing?

99
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,939
What the fuck?

100
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:53,759
Get in there.

101
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,600
They're gonna just...

102
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,139
Boss, we got big problems.

103
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,500
The Cat Police are here.

104
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,379
Are you kidding me right now, Cat Police?

105
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,660
Get us the fuck out of here.

106
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,500
Drive the car.

107
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,339
Get us out.

108
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:03,699
Let's speed it up.

109
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,019
Get us the fuck out of here.

110
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:06,620
Come on, get us the Cat Police.

111
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,019
You kids, don't leave.

112
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:08,860
I'm the police.

113
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,699
I'm the police.

114
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:10,540
I'm the police.

115
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,379
I'm the police.

116
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,819
I'm the police.

117
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:13,660
I'm the police.

118
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,920
Good job, Cat Police.

119
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,759
You did it again.

120
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,160
You saved the world.

121
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,560
And that's what we do as Cat Police.

122
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,160
We make the world a better...
