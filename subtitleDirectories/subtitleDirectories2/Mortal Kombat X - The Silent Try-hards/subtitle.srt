1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:19,750
Let's get, let's get warmed up. Let's get, get warmed up. This is too offensive for cameras. Turn the camera off. Don't show it, don't blur it. Don't show, blur it out.

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:29,870
Okay guys, welcome to a video. So Ster and I have realized that trying to play a game like this and talk, it always ends in disaster.

3
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:38,039
So we're just gonna try our little pants off as the two characters who know how to play. If somebody makes a noise, you know what I mean?

4
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,789
If somebody says a word, then you got it. You know what I mean?

5
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,789
This video is going to be 95% silent and every once in a while we're gonna go.

6
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:51,420
Yeah, so first we're gonna do a little just to check here. Make sure your connections are connected.

7
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,719
Okay, so commence the tri- no.

8
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,539
You said commence.

9
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:59,539
Commence means end, by the way. I figured that out the other day.

10
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:00,539
Does it really?

11
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,540
The other day? What the fuck am I talking about? Tri-Hod mode, activate. Jack's wrestler versus culto-

12
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,540
You said activate!

13
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,840
Now I'm gonna have to do a comeback. Here we go. Three-

14
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:16,719
We need to show us how good we are at video games, okay?

15
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,719
We're not good at this game though.

16
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,719
We need to show just what we're capable of. Okay, ready?

17
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,019
Yeah. Thriller!

18
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:26,019
Three, two, one, action!

19
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,950
I wasn't ready.

20
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:41,540
Well now it's too bad because now you're caught in the combo mania. I always forget about that fucking sword move.

21
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,560
Oh, out of the corner. Into the face. Jump kick.

22
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Okay.

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,560
I knew you were gonna do that, and you know what? I just fucking threw up blood in my mouth.

24
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:01,280
What is with those fucking blocky blocks?

25
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,459
What?

26
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:06,459
I can't talk in points. I can't-

27
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,460
What's with all these blocky blocks this guy's doing?

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Alright, well I won that round. Good.

29
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,250
I was trying to think of what to say about blocky blocks.

30
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,250
It's just what happens when you play this game, and you try, and you try to try.

31
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,340
Shit.

32
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,689
That didn't work. That did.

33
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,490
Every time. Why won't that move work? Come on, controller.

34
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,439
No!

35
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:04,259
Get that out of here.

36
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:06,879
I want to be in the sun.

37
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,879
Get that out of here.

38
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,879
And you fucking throw the- you throw the saw blade overhead at me.

39
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,879
That's how you're gonna end this one?

40
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,879
And then it reappears on my back.

41
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,879
You're gonna try and throw me into the statue?

42
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,879
I thought about it. I was going to.

43
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,259
You didn't think I was like trying to do that?

44
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:31,210
Alright, we'll play online.

45
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,210
Well, we are playing online. I'm glad you noticed.

46
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,289
Jump off the face.

47
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:42,490
Now back it up. Back it up to the thing that I'm not gonna-

48
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,490
Oh my god.

49
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,490
What?

50
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:55,219
I'm just- I'm just trying to sit up.

51
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:56,219
What was I doing?

52
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,219
I don't know. What were you doing?

53
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:06,319
Every time I don't jump, and I always say to myself, why didn't you jump?

54
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,030
And this is time for a finisher.

55
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,340
You want to see my finisher?

56
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,340
I fucked it up.

57
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,339
You just pop a guy in the face.

58
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,899
I didn't finish me-

59
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,899
Smoking! That's-

60
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,899
Censor that out, smokers.

61
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,899
He's not smoking. He's eating a fucking sausage.

62
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:30,970
After a good fight, I just like to sit back and have some of the pork.

63
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,589
It's time for a bet.

64
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,589
We're betting, men.

65
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:39,589
If I win this next match, then-

66
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:40,589
What happens if you win?

67
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:41,589
If you win?

68
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:42,589
Stop it, man.

69
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:44,589
Oh, it's sniping you.

70
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:45,589
Yeah, I know.

71
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,589
I'm gonna win because I want to have a nap.

72
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,589
Yeah, I'm gonna win because I want to sniff for a second.

73
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:53,589
Oh, the snakes are on, guys. You heard it here.

74
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:57,649
Whoever wins, you heard the bets.

75
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:59,649
You hold the rules.

76
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:04,060
Can I please just do the knee to you?

77
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,060
Of course I got it.

78
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,060
Follow it up with the combo.

79
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,199
Follow it up. You can follow it up any time you fucking want, you know, Jax.

80
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:17,269
And I just wasted meter for no goddamn reason.

81
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:20,790
Yeah, because you're a nude.

82
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,790
And I wanted a two.

83
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,790
How do you taunt? How do you- which button taunts?

84
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,079
Watch out!

85
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,060
What did I do? I just did like the three stooges bop you on the head move.

86
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,060
How did I do that?

87
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:48,259
You can hide in there all you want.

88
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:56,379
And you're gonna- I fucked it up.

89
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,139
I fucked it up and you have full meter. I am such a good head.

90
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:03,980
Oh my god, wrong button.

91
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,600
How dare you throw your fucking snakes at me?

92
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,250
Get me out of that. I don't want that to kill me.

93
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,250
I wanted that to kill you so bad.

94
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,250
Dude.

95
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,250
Get out of here. I know you're gonna do it.

96
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,060
I'm fainting.

97
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,060
Oh, I've got such a headache.

98
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,370
My head hurts.

99
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,220
All right, this is it.

100
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,220
Yeah, because I used all of my meter to like give you a sunburn.

101
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,180
What am I doing? What the fuck am I doing?

102
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
I was sitting there blocking.

103
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,180
My brain was trying to process a word I was gonna say.

104
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,420
Fuck you a sunlight.

105
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,800
Yeah, get thrown. Get thrown again.

106
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Get fucking thrown one more time.

107
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,300
I should have blocked it.

108
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,500
That would have been really good if I had blocked it.

109
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,370
No, get out of here.

110
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,370
You're gonna get stuck in this corner and I'm gonna laugh at you.

111
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,370
I'm gonna do this move and you're gonna complain about

112
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,370
why didn't I think that he was gonna-

113
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:23,540
I know your weakness.

114
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,540
What's my weakness? You know what?

115
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,000
I bet you don't know my weakness. I know your weakness.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You wanna know what your weakness is?

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What? Do it.

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,180
I didn't hit the buttons right, so I can't show you.

119
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,180
I can't show you your weakness.

120
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,930
It's getting kicked in the face.

121
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,930
Good fatality.

122
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,550
I don't want to sit here and watch it.

123
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,750
They're so long.

124
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,750
Yeah, that actually, like we've seen it so many times that like-

125
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,750
Well, we've already seen it.

126
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,209
Yeah, well, this is gonna make you pretty angry.

127
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,209
This one's for all the marbles.

128
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,899
Oh, it is.

129
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:00,220
Every time. I get hit by-

130
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,220
I think I seriously get hit by that every single time.

131
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,220
Pretty sure.

132
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,410
Oh, you think you wanna mess with me?

133
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,779
If I had done the move right, I would have got you.

134
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:18,779
Try to block that one.

135
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,720
Try to block that one.

136
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
I'm like doing this with you right now.

137
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
What the fuck?

138
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,899
I knew it. I knew you were gonna do that, too.

139
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:32,269
You didn't account for me to do that, did you?

140
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:34,899
I'll get out of here. You know what I'm gonna do.

141
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:37,840
I was trying to jump away from it, too,

142
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
and I just didn't do it because I'm just bad.

143
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,429
How could you be crouching that low

144
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:54,429
and still kicking you in the head?

145
00:08:55,429 --> 00:09:06,610
I need to do the jump grab to you more often.

146
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,379
Gotcha.

147
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:16,169
That was so dumb.

148
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:20,409
Have some hot soup.

149
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,779
Why did that hurt me?

150
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:23,779
Because I did my air grab.

151
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,779
I'm surprised it didn't just grab you.

152
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,779
You didn't even do your air grab.

153
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,779
Finally, I got it to work.

154
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,779
And you got me with your x-ray.

155
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,779
From like over the head to the point.

156
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,779
I don't think it's gonna kill me.

157
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,779
I think I still get a chance. Of course I get a chance.

158
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,779
Of course I get a chance to do your fucking weakness.

159
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,779
I know your weakness.

160
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,009
Good luck.

161
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:52,059
I'll see you in the fucking funny papers.

162
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,059
Yeah, I'll see you next to Garfield.

163
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,820
See you next to Garfield.

164
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
And Foxtrot.

165
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
And more soup.

166
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
What's another funny?

167
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,120
What are some other funnies?

168
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,549
I don't even know.

169
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:13,700
I'm having trouble thinking of funnies.

170
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,019
I was trying to grab you and just couldn't get it to work.

171
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:24,580
Shit.

172
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:32,769
Any day.

173
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:39,490
Every time. I do it every time.

174
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:46,720
Don't do it.

175
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
