1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,410
Oh yeah, friendly fire. You want to do like some like medic pyro jumps?

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,410
Let's go over here. Come over here, let's jump like into this thing.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,410
This would be amazing if it was an actual mechanic.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,410
Like friendly fire regardless.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,410
Buff the third degree so you can hit your own medic and like jump with him.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,410
This is awesome.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,410
Alright, let's try to get up there. Ready, so...

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,410
Ready, go.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,179
Just up, straight up here. Yeah!

10
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes!

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,740
Okay, so the rule here is,

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,740
everyone get as close to the middle as you can.

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,740
Like everyone's stuff on that point.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,429
Okay, now at the count of three,

15
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,429
literally everybody in here called you like your mother a bitch.

16
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:53,429
Alright, go! One, two, three, go!

17
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:59,140
Why have a Natasha?

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,140
Why? Who has flames?

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,450
Who has fire?

20
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,450
Who had the fire?

21
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,450
Oh, it's the healer.

22
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,450
Oh, god.

23
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,579
Are you kidding me?

24
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:16,579
That guy's the last one standing.

25
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:19,530
I had the worst one.

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,530
I didn't know what your plan was. I went in with the Natasha.

27
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,530
Yeah, yeah, you did. That sucked.

28
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,530
Alright, again. Do it again. Do it again.

29
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,530
Do it again. Do it again.

30
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,530
Don't kill each other. Hold on, wait a second.

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,659
The guy that just

32
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,659
flew up right here.

33
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,659
You got destroyed.

34
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,659
Alright, don't kill each other.

35
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,659
Do not kill each other.

36
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,659
Oh, I know what I'm coming with.

37
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,670
Make sure we get everybody inside here.

38
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,670
Everyone stuff inside the middle.

39
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,670
By the way, whoever is in the very middle, you're dead.

40
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,670
Like, you're gonna die instantly.

41
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,560
Drebin, you are going to die instantly.

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,560
It's gonna be ridiculous.

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Alright, so everyone clump around him.

44
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,500
Get as close to the middle point as you possibly can.

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
If you're not like in the gray,

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,409
then something's wrong.

47
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,409
I can't even fit.

48
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:18,819
Alright, so hold on.

49
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,819
On the count of three,

50
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,819
Alright, go. It's too late. Just go.

51
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Oh, I'm gone.

52
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,960
I got taunt killed.

53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
I got kicked off by a taunt.

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,960
You really did.

55
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,520
It's down to two.

56
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,210
Oh, there's one more contestant.

57
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,210
Oh, he's got a holiday punch.

58
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,210
Get him.

59
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,939
The crits are down.

60
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,939
What's gonna happen here is somebody's gonna detonate it first

61
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,939
when I say three.

62
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:51,939
And every single person in the room is gonna explode.

63
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,939
And then the crits server is gonna crash.

64
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,129
I'm looking forward to that.

65
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:59,129
Alright, that's it.

66
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,129
Alright, so everybody get in here.

67
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,129
Everybody get in here and don't move.

68
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:05,129
Don't do anything. Just marvel.

69
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:07,129
Marvel at the marbles that are all over the ground.

70
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,659
Everybody in here.

71
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,659
On the count of three,

72
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,659
somebody detonate their sticky bombs.

73
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,830
Are you ready?

74
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,020
One, two, three.

75
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,689
There's nobody.

76
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:29,689
I don't even know what happened.

77
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:31,689
I don't even know what happened.

78
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,689
I don't even know what happened.

79
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,689
The game, I couldn't handle that.

80
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:39,979
It just didn't understand.

81
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:45,990
Three, two, one.

82
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,500
Alright.

83
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
That's just too much.

84
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,259
What?

85
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:00,389
Oh, he keeps on getting healed.

86
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:02,389
I'm going heavy. Everybody's a threat.

87
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:05,719
I don't even care.

88
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,599
If I see person, I'm shooting person.

89
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,219
I think I just killed my own spy.

90
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,009
See,

91
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,009
trying to heal yourself with a power jack

92
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,009
is not, it doesn't work.

93
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:26,620
I love the chat.

94
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,620
This is dumb.

95
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,420
Somebody has to try to win the game.

96
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,420
But everybody's in there.

97
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,490
The second I say that, of course,

98
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,490
somebody just puts a shotgun

99
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,490
in somebody's face.

100
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,660
Look at these two going at it.

101
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,199
Look at these two going at it.

102
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,199
Get him. Get him.

103
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,199
Oh, there's a caper.

104
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,199
You capped it.

105
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,199
Somebody capped it.

106
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,199
I need to heal. I need to heal.

107
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,949
He just tried to kill you.

108
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:10,949
This sniper, you're so dead.

109
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,949
Two snipers.

110
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,949
Right now, this guy is going to shoot the first person.

111
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,949
Oh, he doesn't realize.

112
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,319
He doesn't realize the Huntsman doesn't hit teammates.

113
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,319
And these are just the flames from her.

114
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,319
GG.

115
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,579
I'm taking off the Tommy Slav.

116
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm just going Brass Beast.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,329
You can't light me on fire. It doesn't work.

118
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:36,329
Exit.

119
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:39,529
That was my exit strategy.

120
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:42,660
Make sure no one's following me.

121
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,209
All you son of a bitches are a threat.

122
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:49,959
Oh, no, no.

123
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,959
You were on the point.

124
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,959
I was like, where is everybody?

125
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,959
I'm walking outside. There's like three red soldiers trying to kill each other.

126
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,220
No!

127
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,220
Yes!

128
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,220
I'm getting told off by the AFK manager for not moving from spawn.

129
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,220
I can't get out of my spawn.

130
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,220
Why can't I not hit this guy?

131
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,060
What the hell was going on?

132
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,060
Wait, the AFK manager.

133
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,060
Seriously.

134
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,060
He's like, if you don't move from spawn soon,

135
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,060
you'll be moved to Specter.

136
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,060
I can't physically get out.

137
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,060
I can't get out.

138
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,060
You're going to get booted from the server because you can't move.

139
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,060
That's bullshit.

140
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,620
Oh, Pyro is the worst class to play.

141
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,620
Honestly, I don't even know why I'm disguising.

142
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,620
There's no point in disguising.

143
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,620
Oh, yeah, dude.

144
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,620
Your dead ringer will pop from teammates.

145
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,800
They can look kind of convincing, actually.

146
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,259
Good.

147
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,259
We got somebody on the cap.

148
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:47,259
What the hell is going on over here?

149
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:49,259
Why is this guy's clothing just over here?

150
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,980
No!

151
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,980
I got 7 HP. I'm good.

152
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,980
As long as one of my teammates doesn't show up,

153
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,980
I'll be okay.
