00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:07,110
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary on Team Fortress 2.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,750
This is gonna be a one-life gameplay with the Scout, using the default scatter gun,

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:18,839
the Criticola, and the Sandman. This is the first time I've ever equipped the Sandman in a commentary,

4
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,359
ever, and not just a commentary. I haven't put this thing on probably since it came out back

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,100
in like 2008 or 2009, whenever they released this thing. I haven't used it once since then.

6
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,380
This is also on CP Gravel Pit, and it's on Defense if you couldn't already tell.

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,740
Now here, let me tell you why I'm playing Scout. Scout on Gravel Pit on Defense is really,

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,979
really awesome, because if you can see in the bottom of the screen, they have to capture these

9
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:50,979
two points, and you can go back and forth between these two points very, very quickly. So if somebody

10
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:56,659
gets on A, you can run to A. If somebody gets on B, you can run over to B. The other classes don't

11
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:00,179
really have that luxury. If you're playing a Soldier or a Heavy or something like that,

12
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,739
or even a Pyro, even one of the normal speed classes, you can't go back and forth between A

13
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,939
and B that quickly. So a lot of times, what will happen is somebody will sit on one point, let's

14
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:14,260
say A, and if B is getting captured, they'll just let it get captured, because they don't want to

15
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:21,560
leave their position at A and have them cap A as well. This happens in 95% of every single

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,200
Gravel Pit gameplay I've ever been on. And the way to combat it is you need a couple of good

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,159
Scouts. If you have two, maybe three Scouts on defense on Gravel Pit, and they're doing this

18
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,560
running back and forth between the two points, and they're good, it's going to be really, really

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,760
difficult for the blue team to cap any of the points. Especially because you have these structured,

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,239
big, heavy bomb classes like the Heavy or the Demoman, and if they sit in their positions and

21
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,840
they defend where they're standing, and you got these two or three Scouts running back and forth

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,159
to try and protect both of them, you can really close off a lot of choke points, and you can really

23
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,680
control the game. Now this particular gameplay started with A being captured already, but the

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,319
tip still remains. If you want to try and prevent stuff like this from happening from your entire

25
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:09,159
team just stuffing onto B or stuffing onto A, you got to get a good Scout, you got to get a couple

26
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:14,310
of good Scouts, and probably even a few Engineers as well. All right, freeze it right here. Want to

27
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,150
talk about one quick little thing before we get back into this. This Heavy right here is guaranteed

28
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:27,740
If I keep moving forward, if I go after this Heavy, I am definitely, there's zero chance I'm going to

29
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:34,460
beat this guy. If this Heavy has any aim at all, I'm dead. Never run yourself into death. If you see

30
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,979
a Heavy and there's an obstacle you can get around, get around it as soon as possible, because guys,

31
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:45,909
people have such short memories when it comes to Scouts. If you don't kill a Scout, chances are

32
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,270
you're going to say in your head, somebody else will deal with them, and everybody does that,

33
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:57,830
and nobody ever deals with them. So use that to your advantage as many times as you can.

34
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,750
So tip wise, that's all I can really give you today, but let's talk about a couple of things

35
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,389
in the game right now, especially the end of this game. You'll see what I'm talking about in a minute

36
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:12,330
or so. It's ridiculous. For the time being though, let's talk about what's going on on the screen now.

37
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,330
Scout tries to get me with a ball, which ends up being his demise, because he doesn't have the

38
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,050
extra couple shots that I had on him. Jumping up here with the ball, nobody really pays attention

39
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,370
to me when I do this by the way, and I feel like it happens for a lot of people. I've been in this

40
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,330
situation before as well, when a Scout comes up here and just smokes you, and remember this guy's

41
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:37,219
name, remember that sniper. He's important in about 10 to 20 seconds, you'll see. Trying to get an

42
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:41,939
overheal from this Medic, but he totally ignores me, which really really stinks, because I probably

43
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:46,340
could have used it really bad right here. End up getting this Scout jumping up into the corner

44
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,300
again. This is the part I'm talking about now, everybody pay attention, this is ridiculous.

45
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,500
So I'm not sure if this was lag or what actually happened here, but watch. Insta-death. Let's do a

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,939
little bit of German investigative reporting here. So take a look at what he's doing. He's facing

47
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:07,080
completely and totally forward with his arrow cocked. Look it, he's not even looking at me,

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,439
and somehow he magically kills me by shooting forward, but shooting to the right at the Saint

49
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:18,360
I don't know. I really don't know, and watch the chat. Watch the chat, ready? He says hee hee,

50
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,759
almost like he knew that was gonna happen, or he planned it, and maybe it was just lag and he's

51
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,639
laughing about the lag. Not sure, but that's gonna be the end of the game guys. Thank you so much for

52
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,800
watching, I really do appreciate it, and if you liked this video, go ahead and shoot me a like,

53
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,639
and I'll see you guys all next time. Take care everybody.
