1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,760
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Nightmare House 1. It's the actual prologue to Nightmare House 2, and I did it sort of in reverse.

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:27,760
I did Nightmare House 2 before I did Nightmare House 1, and that's my mistake, but I did promise I was going to do this. I did promise I was going to do the prologue.

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,939
So let's wrap up Nightmare House 2, the playthrough, totally, I guess, with Nightmare House 1. Prologue, here we go.

4
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:43,630
I heard this is very, very scary. I heard there's a lot of moments in the prologue or in Nightmare House 1 where you crap your pants.

5
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,579
So let's see if I crap my pants. Currently at the loading screen.

6
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:06,379
Uh oh. Nightmare House 2 will start after finishing the prologue. Okay. This is going to be real scary.

7
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:29,549
All right. The prologue. Oh man. Oh boy. Birds. This is very dark. I might turn up the brightness just a little bit because I can't see anything. Brightness.

8
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:40,590
Right there should be better. Hey, it's still pretty dark, but a little bit better. Let's just go here. In the woods.

9
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:53,340
Over the hills and through the woods to grandmother's house we go. Look at that house. It's a nightmare house.

10
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:07,980
Okay. Blood at the door. Anything around here? Bottle. Get out of here. Table. You know what? Let's wreck this guy's whole picnic table.

11
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:20,289
Oh, that's all I can do. Get out of the way. Can I open this up? No. Uh, door will not open. That's okay.

12
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:34,650
Whoever lives here, you are a freak. What's that? A bulkhead? Can I open the bulkhead? No, it's locked. I can't do anything with this house. This nightmare house.

13
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:43,530
Let's, uh, can I go around? Hmm. Maybe there's a way to break it. Can I like break that for the shovel or something?

14
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:51,659
Break it. Open the doors and smash the window. Oh, smash the window. Smash the window. Give me something to smash the window with.

15
00:02:51,659 --> 00:03:07,060
Oh, that's not gonna work. I can see inside, but I cannot get in. Come with me. What about the shed? Let's go check out the shanty.

16
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:23,099
Anything? Hey, the shed opens. There's an axe. A bike. I'm gonna ride my bike out of here. Give me the axe.

17
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:32,039
Why can't I take the table saw? I'd rather have the table saw. I could probably just break the door down now.

18
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:48,080
Actually, you know what? I'm gonna go for the lock. Lock seems like the sure thing. And... Yay! Door! Hello? Hey!

19
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:56,050
Do I have a flashlight? Okay, good to know that you have a flashlight in this one as well as the second one. Good to know.

20
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:06,460
Let's move along here. Electric. I'm assuming I'm gonna get hurt if I touch that. Go! Nope. Oh, it's all water.

21
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:16,769
I'm gonna electrocute if I stand on that. Jump! Alright, let's go tub. Let's go move the tub.

22
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:35,209
Hey, dude. Are you okay? Are you okay, sir? You don't look okay. Got a gun. Break some of these crates. Let's get the hell out of here.

23
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:46,620
Door opens. Now this just comes back out to the electricity room. Can I jump this? I thought the guy was gone.

24
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:59,860
Move this thing. Get out of the way. Oh, I think I know what to do. I gotta make like a quasi bridge. That didn't work.

25
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:09,300
Come here. You go right here, and you get over here. And you go right here. Is that gonna do it? Is that gonna work?

26
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:21,009
Ah! Physics! I don't know how you work! I die! Come here. Get over here. Oh my god, maybe this is not what you're supposed to do.

27
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:31,519
I can't see any other way though, so I'm gonna say yes it is. Hey, look at that! No, don't fall over. Yes, it worked! I made it!

28
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:40,209
Door won't open. Of course the door won't open. Why would the door open?

29
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:57,439
No, that's not the way. Secret room. Secret room. Where am I supposed to go? Maybe out to the back here? To the door, maybe?

30
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:05,930
I'm gonna try my block building routine again, because I think I saw something up there. Is that gonna work?

31
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:21,319
And support my weight! Yay! Oh, hooray! This is what I just looked at. What is this? Oh, hello! Guy sitting on the toilet is now not a guy on the toilet.

32
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:30,660
It's two guys. Kinda looks like an egg. Got my flashlight still, right? Anything in here I need to know? Turn on the water, clean my hands.

33
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:40,029
No, I knew it! I knew it! I knew you were gonna do that! Why am I kneeling? I was just kneeling, like just swinging at him. Now it'll open, right?

34
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:49,620
There's another one right here, no? I thought his legs were gonna get up instead of attacking me. Anything in here? Bullets.

35
00:06:49,620 --> 00:07:04,399
Oh, this one is so scary because it's just confined rooms. It's like hallways. Storage. Can I move this? Don't think I can. Can I open this door?

36
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:23,379
This door looks like it's already kind of ajar. No, I don't know. Open. Can I break? Maybe I can just break this. No, I can't. That's good to know. Good to know.

37
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:35,860
You got anything in your cabinets, lady? Hey! Hey! Whoa! Oh, I thought someone broke in the door. Okay, the lights out. Lights out. It's curfew.

38
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,970
Blood. Recharge flashlight. Lots of blood. Lots of blood. Lots of blood.

39
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,670
Get the hell away from me, you son of a sneaky snake! Get away from me!

40
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:06,310
Oh, TV. What's on the TV? Anything interesting? Come on. That eye just looked at me.

41
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:14,180
Gah! I want to watch like Spongebob Squarepants. Do you got that on your TV? Do you have cable?

42
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:23,029
Alright, we're gonna go, I'm gonna go in here to pick, there's probably stuff in here. There is a, what the hell is this thing?

43
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:32,100
Is this like an incubator? Are you making like chickens? Are you gonna hatch like little chickens? Bullets. Good to have bullets. It's always good to have bullets.

44
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:41,440
This is the only way to go. He's in here. Let's go. Come on now! Come on! Don't do this to me!

45
00:08:45,460 --> 00:09:03,639
Charge the light. Hey! Where am I? Where the hell am I? What is going on? Hey, weird house you got here, dude.

46
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:13,580
Your house is like a bunch of bricks. I fell down. Alright, well let's just do it again.

47
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:22,710
We're right here. That's cool. Land on... I'm stuck. I'm stuck! Why am I stuck? You, get out of my face!

48
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:30,409
Thank you for getting out of my face. I appreciate that. Now why could I not land on that? Did I mess something up? Let's see, hold on.

49
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:51,919
Got a board over there. And can I just jump from here? Hey, I can! Excuse me, miss. Um, there seems to be a problem here.

50
00:09:51,919 --> 00:10:01,299
It looks like this guy is dead on your wall and you're just sitting there watching TV. Oh, I don't want to walk over near her.

51
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:08,399
Slow down, sequence. What you got for me, huh? You gonna run? You gonna run? That guy's gonna chase me.

52
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:18,850
Garen? Oh, she wasn't even watching TV. Who can I... Oh! My dog is barking at me right now. Did you guys hear that?

53
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:29,500
He was like, Ruff! Get me in! Get me out of... Why are you doing this, lady? Why are you scaring me so much?

54
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:42,740
Through the next door. It's locked. Gag! Come on! She's just always standing in front of you.

55
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:53,009
Come on! That's a two-piece! Something in my eye. Something in my nose. Something all over me. Can I break this?

56
00:10:53,009 --> 00:11:07,379
Give me that shotgun. Oh! Shotgun, baby! Overconfidence! I just got... Good! What is that?

57
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:15,720
Alright, I'm keeping the shotgun out. I don't care how many bullets I waste. No one is coming near me.

58
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:27,960
Charge the light. Let's go. God! God! He's... Double shoot! Double barrel! This is just a jump-mania game.

59
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:38,039
Everybody just jumps in your face. Got this girl jumping in my face. These guys with the broken necks jumping in my face.

60
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:51,500
Guys on the ground. Holy hell in a hand basket. Is he dead? He's dead. Come on! Hide somebody around every corner.

61
00:11:51,500 --> 00:12:06,840
Keys? Any keys? Hey, a key! Give it to me. I want that key. Give me that key. Hey, can I pick it up?

62
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:19,409
Hey, I can pick it up. Hooray! Get... These guys are so creepy. Just these grotesque freak shows.

63
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:28,860
Let's go, key man. There we go. Open the door. Get me out of... Let me guess. The stairs are going to fall down. Hooray!

64
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:40,750
No, they didn't. Oh, it opened. Where's my shotgun? I'm only comfortable when I have the shotgun out.

65
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:58,340
Charge the light. Another door. Open. Get me out of here. God, this is gross. Oh, you're moving. You're rocking. That's not terrifying.

66
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:13,470
Hey! Get me out of that room. Get me out of that room. Get me out of here. I just keep hearing noises. Get me out.

67
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:23,610
Get away from me, you crawling... What's in there? Nothing? Nothing. Got to go in here. I'm okay with that.

68
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:33,649
Break down the walls. Break them down. It's going to be a jump. I will make this jump. Here we go. Jump, master!

69
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:47,879
Bullets. And... A ladder. I can't move. Can I break that stuff? Oh! I thought that was a person. I thought that chair...

70
00:13:47,879 --> 00:14:07,419
Oh, it actually was a person. Never mind. Really? Shoot him! Shoot him! Get me up off of here. Will you get off me?

71
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:20,809
Why can't I get out of here? I'm stuck on this ladder. I fell down. Oh, well, that was dumb. I was glitched out on the ladder. I couldn't get off.

72
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:30,259
Alright, this time I'm going to be ready for this guy that was side swiping me when I climbed up the ladder. Yeah, you're dead, bro. Let's go.

73
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:42,500
Get off me. Hey, my whole job is to sit up here and... I almost just got scared again from that. Get out of here! Okay, go.

74
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:52,120
Okay, we're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Load up that shotgun. Open the door. Something's going to break through the walls. Something's going to break through the walls.

75
00:14:52,120 --> 00:15:07,470
Just run everywhere. Too many. Too many. No more shotgun bolts. Should I go down? What was in the room across the hall? Might as well look.

76
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:23,480
Let's bar it up. Can't get in there. Only one option. Looks like we're going to have to take it. Down. Going down, down, down.

77
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:34,440
Oh, that one hurt. That one hurt my brain. That and that one. Damn it!

78
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:49,990
I thought I got better at these scare games. I got worse. Hey, Komodo, come over here like Quasimodo. Eat that. Eat that.

79
00:15:49,990 --> 00:16:06,700
I only have two shots in this. Not anymore. 20 now. We're good. Charge it. You have to do that. She has to just appear randomly. Did I like escape the house? I think I did.

80
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:15,970
Get me out of here. Take me down like the King's Road. Game of Thrones reference. That was a Game of Thrones reference.

81
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:23,210
Who's going to combat me and get shot in the face with the shotgun? A lot of people here. What's going on? Maybe I should just be running.

82
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:42,539
Oh, I have a sprint. I forgot about that. Oh my God. Look, it's a light. Hey, it's a truck. Ah! You can't escape from Nightmare House. Oh my God.

83
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:58,580
Well, that's it, I guess, for Nightmare House 1. Now, if you were watching this right now and you didn't see any of the Nightmare House 2 stuff, I'm going to put a link in the description to start off at Chapter 1 for Nightmare House 2.

84
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:07,579
I suggest you watch through that playthrough. It was very, very fun, very, very interesting. And yeah, that's going to wrap it up, guys. I will see you guys all soon. And take care, everybody.
