00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,980
Going over your morning commute right now, we've got traffic on the threes, which looks like it could be letting up by about 4 or 5 p.m. tonight.

2
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,980
I would suggest taking a different route, but we got an accident on route 45, and hopefully...

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,980
What's this? Oh my god, a person!

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:39,939
Hey everybody, welcome to another video starring me, German985.

5
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:45,939
I've got a really interesting thing to show you. It's how I drive cars now. It's pretty fun.

6
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:56,619
Here we go. Oh yeah, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. Coming soon. Coming soon, DVD.

7
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:00,119
Jesus Christ.

8
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:12,920
This is nothing like riding a tricycle on a Sunday afternoon. Hey, look at me, mommy. I'm so cute.

9
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:21,750
Inside of a Mack truck? Oh, you gotta be shitting me. This ain't gonna end well.

10
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:29,700
This is gonna be real bad. Oh, fuck the fuck. That sucked.

11
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:42,030
Okay, we'll put a big ramp right here. Let's go. Let's do it. Big ramp. Hold on for dear life.

12
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,030
Because we're going over the goddamn ramp. That's not what I wanted to have happen.

13
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:55,129
For some how I landed that. Broken bones everywhere. I don't know how that just happened. Let's do it!

14
00:01:55,129 --> 00:02:02,209
Go. Go. Go.

15
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:08,819
And just like that, he was never heard from again.

16
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:16,169
So are you sure this is safe? I'm positive. Just do it, you baby.

17
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:21,169
Okay, well I guess I'll try. Weee!

18
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:26,430
Looks like you're gonna be fighting a little bit of construction on Route 24 coming on the bridge there.

19
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:35,139
What the fuck even happened? Are you serious? I didn't even do anything. He didn't do anything.

20
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:50,319
What just happened? I broke my neck on the dashboard. Okay.

21
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:57,319
You know son, it was on this very bridge that your mother proposed to me. I mean, I proposed to your mother.

22
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,319
She looked so pretty in her red dress. Fucking come on!

23
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:09,750
Did I ever tell you son, when I proposed to your mother on this very bridge, we were both young and restless.

24
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,750
And I said, sweetie, I love you so much. Can we please get married?

25
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,930
And if I miss this again, I'm gonna fucking scream.

26
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,930
It was this very bridge where I proposed to your mother.

27
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:29,300
She looked so pretty in her red dress and I said, son, would you like to get married?

28
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,180
No, there's a fire. There's a fire somewhere. We're gonna bring the fire engine. I think there's a fire.

29
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,180
There could be a fire over here.

30
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,180
It's this highway right here. This is the one son. You gotta be careful. You're only a student driver.

31
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,180
You gotta watch out for the goddamn animals. There's birds and bears cross this bridge all the time.

32
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:54,439
So please just be careful. Look out son! There goes one now!

33
00:03:54,439 --> 00:04:01,919
Why did mummy not want me to play in the street? She said not to play in the street, but why? It's so much fun.

34
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:09,150
Fuck! That would have been perfect.

35
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:15,030
I can't wait to show my mummy my new skateboard move. She told me not to play in the street, but I don't care.

36
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:22,779
Mummy, let me see. Maybe I can show mummy my new skateboard move. Look, I'm just flying down like Superman.

37
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:31,439
Check it out. You're going for 20 points.

38
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,829
20 points.

39
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:42,480
Yeah, my boyfriend's so badass. He's in a biker gang. He buys me presents all the time.

40
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,480
You wish you had a boyfriend like mine. Just wait till he shows up to say, to say, fuck you.

41
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,490
And he fucking fell off again. I really hope this works.

42
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,490
I've done this like eight times and it keeps on falling off the bike like a dipshit.

43
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,490
Somebody get this dipshit, a driver's license that is capable for a motorcycle.

44
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,490
Here he comes. Here he comes. Come on. Come on now.

45
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:09,490
You did it. You did it, my son.
