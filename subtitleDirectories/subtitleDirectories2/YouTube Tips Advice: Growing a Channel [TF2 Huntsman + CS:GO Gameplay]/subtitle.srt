1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,759
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jirba here with a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,800
Tonight, I'm not exactly sure again what game I'm gonna be playing, and you might see more of this in the future.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:31,480
I'll do these commentaries that I have ideas for, and I won't exactly know what games in the background because I just want to talk about these things, sort of radio podcast style, talking to myself, but of course to you guys about these things.

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:52,960
I don't know what's going on. I could be a soldier, I could be playing Smite, I could be playing Anti-Chamber, and whatever, you know, whatever game's there, that's the game that's there, but the important thing about this video is going to be trying to help you guys out with a lot of questions that I get about YouTube, and I'm gonna go right into it, not gonna dilly-dally, not gonna spend any time on anything else, so let's talk about YouTube.

5
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:07,900
One of the biggest questions I get on this channel, and it happens on a daily basis, I have hundreds of PMs and thousands of comments of people over the years asking me how to grow a YouTube channel, and how do I do these things?

6
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:17,420
I know how to make the commentary, but I don't know how to get people to watch. I have no idea what to do. Please, if you could give me some advice, I would really appreciate it, and I used to reply to a lot of these people.

7
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:40,260
I used to reply and give them some of my advice on how to do certain things on YouTube, how to try to gain an audience on YouTube, but I feel like doing a video like this on the whole would be much better, because then you can reference to it whenever you need to, you can just watch this and have your question completely answered, and I can try to help you out as best as I can, because it can be a lion's den on this website, guys.

8
00:01:41,099 --> 00:02:03,099
This is not the YouTube of yesteryear. This is now, you brought money into it, everyone is fighting each other like dogs trying to get views and to get subs and stuff like that, so let's break it down to a very basic level, and hopefully you can take something out of this video for the better, if you have a YouTube channel, or if you want to start a YouTube channel, this falls into the same category.

9
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:03,939
Number one, before you start a YouTube channel, you need to have your channel brand in your head already. Now, that means to have a good channel name. You want to make sure you have a channel name that is easily rememberable, a channel name that is easy to type into a YouTube search. You don't want to have a YouTube name that's like XTX93455GamingHDSonyVegas9500, because that name is very difficult to type into a search, and if somebody hears your name somewhere, let's say somebody tweets out one of your names, and you're like, hey, what's your name? What's your name? What's your name? What's your name? What's your name? What's your

10
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:34,729
name?

11
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:57,650
You want to make sure you have that please name that's easier to remember at the top of somebody's head and that is hopefully half the time that you start a YouTube channel, or it's probably too easy to model your name into a YouTube video, because then that alarm area will probably hind

12
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,770
you and your costs will be a lot bigger on YouTube.

13
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,669
channel, money cannot be the thing you're doing it for.

14
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:07,409
I know there's a bunch of people with partnerships,

15
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,490
there's a lot of people making a lot of money

16
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,990
on this website, but a lot of these people

17
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,430
are very, very specific, sort of out there cases

18
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,610
that are very hard to achieve and very hard to obtain.

19
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,169
So take money completely out of this, guys.

20
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,650
If you are doing a YouTube channel,

21
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,349
if you're making content, if you want to start

22
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:27,349
a YouTube channel, get the money idea

23
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,310
out of your head right now.

24
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,610
Do not even think about it, do not make videos

25
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,090
hoping to someday make money, hoping to someday

26
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,409
get a partnership, because something you gotta realize

27
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:40,889
is a couple years ago, like only three or four years ago,

28
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,629
YouTube partnerships were not even a thing.

29
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:45,930
The machinima network, like the game station,

30
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,550
none of these places, none of these networks

31
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,689
for gamers even existed.

32
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:52,590
So a lot of these huge YouTubers that you know today

33
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,349
were making videos for no money for a couple years.

34
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,449
So you have to get the money thing out of your head.

35
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,250
Once you start thinking of money,

36
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,770
that's when you start to make content,

37
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,009
specifically because you want to make money,

38
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,030
and it should not have anything to do about that.

39
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,210
You should make a YouTube channel

40
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,229
because you want to make content for people.

41
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:12,289
You want to make commentaries, you want to entertain people,

42
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:14,090
you want to show somebody something important

43
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,770
that you think is really cool.

44
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,449
That is what a gaming channel is all about,

45
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:20,269
and I'm pounding my desk like I'm some type

46
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,689
of presidential candidate right now.

47
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:24,410
But anyways, you get the idea.

48
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,170
Don't start a YouTube channel for money,

49
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,290
start it for passion.

50
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,290
That is really, really important for success,

51
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,370
incredibly important.

52
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,110
So thirdly and then fourthly,

53
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,730
we're gonna talk about two different points here.

54
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,870
We're gonna talk about how to grow your YouTube channel,

55
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,610
how to get views on your YouTube channel,

56
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,529
and how to try to keep people sticking around.

57
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:44,170
And it really is quite simple, guys.

58
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,410
It has to do with your titles, your tags,

59
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,500
and when you upload certain videos.

60
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,660
So let's go over the first part there.

61
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,459
Let's talk about titles and tags.

62
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,100
I can't tell you guys how many times

63
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,500
I've seen somebody's content that they wanted me

64
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,480
to check out or that they asked me

65
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,540
to come check out their channel,

66
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,379
or even if they didn't,

67
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,420
if I just see people's videos on YouTube,

68
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,100
their titles are ridiculous.

69
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,019
So let's say you have a TF2 Spy video, for example.

70
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:11,819
You're playing TF2 Spy, you get 30 backstabs in one life,

71
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,819
and the title of that video is TF201.WMV.

72
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,899
It's like, man, no one's gonna search for that,

73
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,660
because when you type a search into YouTube,

74
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,379
what it does is it looks for the keywords

75
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:27,180
in your title, your description, and your tags,

76
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,899
and then it shows you videos according to that search.

77
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:33,500
So if your video is titled My TF2 Fun Video,

78
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,139
and it's like a great video, nobody's gonna find it.

79
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,779
It has to be a very good comprehensive title,

80
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:42,259
like Team Fortress 2, Backstab Streak 30,

81
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,019
Hightower Dash, My First Commentary.

82
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:47,680
You need to make sure your titles are comprehensive,

83
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,300
and your tags and your description

84
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,660
are also very comprehensive.

85
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,459
And that leads me into the second point here,

86
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,300
and that's when to upload certain content.

87
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,740
Keep the titles and the tags thing in your brain,

88
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,899
and remember here, anytime a major game comes out

89
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:05,139
or a major update to an already big franchise,

90
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,899
there are so many people that search for that type of stuff.

91
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,540
If a TF2 update comes out,

92
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,579
or a PlanetSide 2 update comes out,

93
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,939
people are searching to find out what those notes are.

94
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,839
People are trying to see gameplay footage

95
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,300
of that particular update or that particular game.

96
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,560
So you gotta keep that in mind.

97
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,939
You gotta keep track of when things are being updated,

98
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,860
when new big releases are coming out,

99
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,939
and try to get your upload schedule there

100
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:27,529
accordingly.

101
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,089
So the last thing I'm gonna talk about here,

102
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,990
and the thing to wrap up this video,

103
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,949
there's a lot more stuff to talk about, guys.

104
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:34,329
I wish I could bring up everything

105
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,170
I ever wanted to talk about with this subject,

106
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,089
but it would be like a 40 minute long video.

107
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:40,170
So I'm trying to get as much information down

108
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,410
into a 10, eight to 10 minute video as fast as I can.

109
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,470
So let's talk about collaborations now.

110
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,370
This is so huge, because in this day and age on YouTube,

111
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,009
guys, you cannot do it alone.

112
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:55,850
There are thousands and thousands and thousands

113
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,089
of gaming YouTube channels on the internet right now.

114
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,730
After the explosion of channels,

115
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,209
like in the last year or so,

116
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:03,610
this thing has taken off so much

117
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,750
that it is almost impossible to get your content seen

118
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,009
if you go it alone.

119
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,189
So here's my advice to you guys.

120
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:11,589
Try and find other channels out there

121
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:14,269
that have similar sub and similar view counts,

122
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:17,430
because it's very difficult for somebody

123
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,269
that has a very low sub and view count

124
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:21,350
to be able to convince somebody

125
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,269
with a very high sub and view count to do content together.

126
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:25,670
It's pretty difficult.

127
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,269
It's probably not going to happen.

128
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:30,550
For instance, if I had sent a message to PewDiePie,

129
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,110
and I was like, hey, PewDiePie, let's do a video.

130
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,629
Let's play TF2 tomorrow.

131
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:38,189
He'd probably just be like, I don't know, man.

132
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:40,430
What's your channel, who are you?

133
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,430
You have to stay in your own realm of sub and view counts,

134
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,230
because that's when people take you seriously.

135
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,649
If I sent a message to another guy

136
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,389
that has 50, 60, 100,000 subs,

137
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:51,470
we'd be able to work together,

138
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,629
because he would look at my channel and go,

139
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:54,470
oh yeah, I'm the same size as this guy.

140
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:56,389
Cool, but it's like, let's do some stuff together.

141
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:57,949
The same thing has to go through your head.

142
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,589
So if you have a couple of friends you have

143
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:01,610
that you're in the same sub and view count area,

144
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,829
and you make some content together,

145
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:04,810
you like and favor each other's videos, maybe,

146
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,430
that's how you spread subscribers around.

147
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,949
If all of you have less than 1,000 subs,

148
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:10,189
let's say you get three or four guys

149
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,589
that are in the same boat here,

150
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:13,709
you might be able to get up to four or 5,000

151
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:14,829
in a couple months,

152
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,350
because you're all doing content together,

153
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,810
and everyone's seeing your name pop up

154
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,250
in each other's videos.

155
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,649
That's incredibly important.

156
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:22,889
That's how you get eyeballs on your content.

157
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,649
And one thing I do have to say is,

158
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:26,430
try not to spam people.

159
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,050
If you send somebody a message on YouTube,

160
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,889
or you send them a message,

161
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:30,329
or you try and Skype the person,

162
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:32,049
and you say, hey, I wanna do some content together,

163
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,129
come check out my channel,

164
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:34,169
and they don't respond,

165
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,370
or maybe they're not into it,

166
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,970
don't keep bothering that person,

167
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,850
because there are some people on YouTube

168
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,250
that do not wanna do content with other people.

169
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,570
And that's okay, I mean, that's fine,

170
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,649
but you gotta try to respect people's opinions on things,

171
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:49,710
and try not to just attack somebody

172
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,960
for not doing videos with you.

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,519
So to wrap this video up, to end this video,

174
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,799
I'm going to stop on this,

175
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,039
and it's gonna be,

176
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,379
guys, if you wanna make a YouTube channel,

177
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:01,960
the content's gotta be good.

178
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
You can't just throw together a video and upload it,

179
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,759
and say, hey, where's my 10 million subscribers?

180
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,860
You've gotta put effort into every single video,

181
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,840
you gotta put passion and intimacy

182
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,000
into each video you make on this,

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,360
intimacy, that's a little weird,

184
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,759
but you gotta put your whole soul into each video,

185
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,440
and each upload's gotta be as best

186
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,879
as you can possibly make it,

187
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,639
and you gotta be consistent.

188
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,840
You can't upload one video,

189
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,960
and then not do YouTube for six months,

190
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,200
come back, and hope that your subscribers

191
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,639
still even know who you are.

192
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,120
I mean, but this is a very fast-moving environment.

193
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,360
The average attention span on this website

194
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,059
is like five minutes,

195
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,360
so if you don't upload a video

196
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,840
for two or three, four, five, six weeks,

197
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,519
you have to stay consistent,

198
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,600
because people have short attention spans,

199
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,399
especially on the internet.

200
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,259
So hopefully, you guys got something out of this,

201
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,559
hopefully I gave you some insight on a few things,

202
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,919
and if you want more,

203
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,679
I would probably make another one of these,

204
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,039
because of course, there's a lot to talk about here.

205
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,399
Just let me know in the comments section,

206
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,360
throw me a comment asking me certain things,

207
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,600
maybe some more questions you have

208
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,159
that I didn't cover in this video,

209
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,200
and maybe I'd make a part two on this.

210
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,240
We'll see how it goes, guys,

211
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,519
but thank you so much for watching,

212
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,279
I really do appreciate it, everybody,

213
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,360
and good luck if you wanna make a YouTube channel.

214
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,740
It is a very, very daunting endeavor,

215
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,840
and there are a lot of ups,

216
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,879
and there are a lot of downs

217
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,700
with running a YouTube channel every day,

218
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,960
but I really do wish you the best of luck, everybody.

219
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,360
Go get them, go try it, and go have some fun,

220
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,840
and I'll see you guys all next time,

221
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,039
and of course, take care, everybody.
