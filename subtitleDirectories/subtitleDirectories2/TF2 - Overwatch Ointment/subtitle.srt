1
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:12,169
Is this really happening right now? Am I about to record a Team Fortress 2 video on this channel?

2
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:20,199
Wow. Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

3
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:27,370
It's been a while since you've seen TF2. It's been a long time. And why am I doing it now?

4
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:33,880
Why have I decided randomly right now to make this TF2 video? It's because I just played Overwatch.

5
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,539
I just got back from the Blizzard event where they showcased Overwatch to a bunch of people.

6
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:42,380
I was one of the people that were there. It was a pretty cool event. Got to play the game for a few

7
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,520
hours. Sat down with it. It's really fun. And now I want to play TF2 again. And sort of the unintended

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,969
consequences of going to the Blizzard event was there aren't very many games like this that are

9
00:00:54,969 --> 00:01:02,250
on the market right now. And getting that initial taste of Overwatch got my juices going for TF2.

10
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,750
Which is a really good thing. That means that Overwatch impressed me enough where it got me

11
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:13,879
to want to play at least a similar game because I want to play more Overwatch. So we're going to

12
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:19,000
break this down very, very quickly, very easily. I'm not going to go over gameplay mechanics.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,159
I'm not going to talk about how many knots per second this character moves at sea level.

14
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:31,349
I'm just going to say one, one, one thing. I keep getting this intermittent rash that I cannot ever

15
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,950
get rid of. And I always try to use different products. And you know the type of rash I'm

16
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,109
talking about? It's on your back. It's in a really weird spot where your left hand has to come

17
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:43,590
wrapping around your body and try to scratch it. Your right hand then swoops around and you reach

18
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,709
down and you're barely touching your two fingers. But you can't get it. And God did that. I got to

19
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,750
go to the doctor now. You go to the doctor. You walk in. The doctor prescribes you Team Fortress

20
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,390
2. You go down. Team Fortress 2 clears up the rash. You're smearing that TF2 all over the rash.

21
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,870
And it's filling. It's scary. You're using a lot of the Team Fortress 2 tube. An antimonth though.

22
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,030
And after like three or four years, you run out of the ointment. You go to the doctor. The doctor

23
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,510
says, oh geez, you got it. I'm running out of that TF2 medicine. I take it. This is all I got left.

24
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,349
It's another two-year supply. You take that two-year supply. You're like, yes, I'm so fucking glad you

25
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:16,469
rub it more. The rash is deceding. It's going away. And then the rash comes back up even worse

26
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,590
after that. And you go back to the doctor. The doctor says, I don't have any more Team Fortress

27
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,389
2 medicine. They just continued that shit in like 2014. And you're like, no, what do I do?

28
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:28,870
This rash is starting to take over my body. It's itchy all over. And then Overwatch comes out and

29
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,469
it's a new medicine. And you've seen the ads on TV. You're like, what is this new medicine? I don't

30
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:35,509
like the side effects. Side effects may include stinging and burning initially. And you're like,

31
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:39,110
I don't want to be stinging and burning initially. So you get it. You fucking, you don't even want

32
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,030
it, but you get it because, okay, I'll just take it, I guess. You put it on. It stings.

33
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:52,360
And then like a couple hours later, the rash is starting to feel a little better. It's going to

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,270
go away. It still hurts, but the rash is going away. And look, I don't even, I can't even tell

35
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,770
you, dude, the Overwatch might make the rash worse. You know, you get some medications where

36
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,889
it makes the thing that you're the problem you're having worse. And you're like, what the fuck? I

37
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:09,349
got this because I had a rash. I didn't get this because I wanted a bigger rash. But then what's

38
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:14,460
going to cure that rash? Nobody knows. And I'm not going to pretend like I do know. I'm not going to

39
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,580
pretend to sit here and tell you that Overwatch is going to be the best game ever. That when it

40
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,400
releases, it's going to be a 10 out of 10. I don't know that. All I know is it was really fun when I

41
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,710
played it. The characters all feel great. Bastion is probably my favorite character out of all of

42
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:33,590
them. If you don't know what Bastion is or what the character is, he's this big goofy robot guy

43
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,030
that can turn himself into an immobile sentry. And you find those places, you find those chokes

44
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,770
where you know people are going to come through and you just turn into a sentry gun and you get

45
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,930
this big shield in front of you to help protect you and teammates and laying down that suppressing

46
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,289
fire. It's great. I love being the support characters in games like this. It's one of the

47
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:59,129
reasons why engineer is my favorite class in Team Fortress 2. It's because of the almost indirect

48
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:03,289
help you're giving people. When I build the teleporter or when I build the dispenser as the

49
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:08,729
engineer, I know people are using it, but I'm not making people use it. Like I'm not grabbing

50
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:14,169
somebody by their pant legs and their shirt collar and tossing them over the point to go to B. Like

51
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:18,569
I'm not directly teleporting people. My shit's doing it for me. Same thing with a character like

52
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:24,250
Zenyatta in Overwatch who has this orb that you simply place on somebody. You can only go on one

53
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,220
person at a time and it just heals them. You give somebody a personal pocket medic and you don't

54
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,639
even need to be near them. You just have to place it on them. But the characters in Overwatch, just

55
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,379
like in Team Fortress, have the personalities behind them to make it so you want to play as

56
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:42,860
a certain character. You'll connect with one of these characters just like I did when I first

57
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,939
started playing with the spy. I thought I got his spy. I thought he was like the coolest thing ever

58
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:52,579
and I wanted to play spy even though I wasn't that good with spy. I just wanted to hear him talk and

59
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:56,980
that's so huge for me in a game like this. Like the reason why I continue to play TF2, why I like

60
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,910
Team Fortress, why I've been playing for as long as I have, it has a lot to do with the personality

61
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,790
of the characters. It has a lot to do with the shorts, the source filmmaker videos, the Gmod

62
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:13,589
videos, the comics, the whole world that has been realized around these characters. They're each

63
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:18,939
their own person. They're each their own hysterical awesome character and I really hope that's what

64
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:23,579
happens with Overwatch. I hope Blizzard takes that seriously because we love to see these characters

65
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:28,779
play out situations and be sort of these living breathing people when in fact they're just kind

66
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:34,149
of mercenaries that are playing in a multiplayer shooter game. Now however you feel about Overwatch,

67
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:37,269
if you think it's going to be terrible, if you don't like it looks, if you think it's too much

68
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:43,430
like TF2 or whatever, at least it's trying to do it. At least it's trying to fill a potential void

69
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,189
that TF2 will inevitably leave behind. When is that going to happen? I don't know. I don't know,

70
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:53,829
it could happen tomorrow, it could happen next year, it could happen ten years from now, but

71
00:05:53,829 --> 00:06:00,230
that's the problem with the Team Fortress series. It is covered in this gigantic shroud of the

72
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:05,300
unknown. We don't know where the direction of the series is going. We don't know what they're going

73
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,939
to be adding. We don't even know if there's going to be another installment in this series. We just

74
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:15,060
get the stuff that Valve gives us whenever they deem it necessary to give it to us.

75
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,779
That's it. That's just the way it's always been and that's the way apparently it's going to be.

76
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:25,779
But it's just refreshing to see a company like Blizzard that has the money and has the experience

77
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:32,069
making games stepping up to the plate and taking a swing. And I'll parrot what I said in the

78
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,939
beginning. I'll end this video simply by saying the time that I spent with it was pretty damn fun.

79
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:42,540
I'm starting to get more interested in it than I was before. And even if it's not the rash cure

80
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,490
that I initially think it's going to be, I'll find another fucking prescription. But we'll leave it

81
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,209
at that. Just know that I don't want to overhype it for myself. I made the overhype video. I'm

82
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:56,810
getting excited. I don't want to get this excited about it, but I'm starting to get excited. I don't

83
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,930
know what to do. Somebody please help me. I'm getting too excited for Overwatch. Somebody come.
