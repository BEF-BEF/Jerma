1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:19,519
I got plenty of health. Dog food? HP up. Oh, wow. Okay. I already had pretty much full health anyways, though, didn't I?

2
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:30,899
What's down? What's this? Okay. Um... I... I'm a little concerned right now. I don't know what's going on.

3
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:36,649
Alright, left or right? Left or right? Left.

4
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:51,630
Brimstone. Whoa. Whoa, what? What the hell is this? What is going on? Whoa! Does that hurt me?

5
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:57,630
Oh, I lost a... Okay, should I... I'm just gonna go. I'm not even gonna pretend like I know what's going on.

6
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:08,379
Level 3, the caves. One. Alright. So I'm still this guy. You have to hold it down? This could be pretty deadly.

7
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:17,400
Oh. I don't know if I like this. Yeah, I don't know if I like this. You have to, like, wait before you can shoot?

8
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:30,510
Ah, it's not that bad. Let's keep going. I'd probably miss something in that room. If you, like, destroy the gar girl, you get $5,000.

9
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:46,810
Actually, this is pretty cool. I'm not gonna lie. Oh! Down or right? Let's go down. Oh, what do you know about my super stream beam?

10
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:56,230
What do you know about my super stream? I forgot those bug things are here. What do you know, Cauliflower Boy? You're done.

11
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:06,810
Let's get rid of those. Now, I'm wondering if I... I don't think I can waste this. I'm pretty sure I just have this forever until I die.

12
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:14,199
Which is... Someone just died right there, speaking of death. This is where it gets a little tricky.

13
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:23,860
I'm just gonna stand here. Oh, God. I don't want to die because I don't want to lose this. Get out of here. Get out of here!

14
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:32,960
Get out of here! Get out of here! That was the scariest thing in the world. You can't mess with my fire and brimstone, baby.

15
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:41,699
So, what I was gonna say is I'm wondering if I die... There's no checkpoints in this game, I don't think. There is not.

16
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:52,009
Can I open that? I can. Look at that health. No, I can't. I have temp... No, you know what? Now, screw the boss. I'm not going for the boss right now.

17
00:02:52,009 --> 00:03:00,750
That's a bad idea. There could be some hidden secrets that I'm missing that I don't want to miss. Let's go right.

18
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,750
I'm gonna charge up my stuff beforehand. Ooh, I don't know how I just didn't get hit by that.

19
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:16,340
Okay, I don't have any keys. Let's just get out of here. I don't have any... I can't get any health.

20
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:26,229
Hopefully, there's something cool over here. Oh, dear God. Oh, my God. I'm gonna die. Oh, my God.

21
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:35,419
Oh, I have to hold the stupid thing down. If I didn't have to hold that down... Now I'm gonna get my ass kicked at the boss.

22
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:46,569
Shit. Die. Actually, there's health on the way. The key. I can open that item door now. That's a good thing.

23
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:56,669
How am I supposed to get that chest? I'm confused. How does one cross that and get the chest?

24
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:10,550
It's probably an item you can get that does it, to be honest. Shit. And here comes the pitch, and it's a home run.

25
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:18,110
I need to be careful here because I will die and lose everything, and then I will want to shoot myself in the face.

26
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:28,870
Pills here. So what? You just hit Q to use the pills? Yeah, come on. Get in a line like that. Just like that. Bang.

27
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:43,420
I can go in here. Okay, so here's the conundrum. Do I go in the room? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay, we're good. We're good.

28
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:55,500
I get it. I get it. Oh, nothing. You maggot bastards. So the doors... So you get a chest, but... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:04,660
You have to do it again? Oh, God. If I knew that, I wouldn't have signed up for this deal. Geez. My God.

30
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:16,170
I bet you there's another one, too. I just really royally screwed myself right here. Oh, my God. Jesus. Oh, my God.

31
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:23,290
I don't think that was worth it, even though I didn't lose any health. That was not worth it. Gonna safely say.

32
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:31,720
But I do have a key now, and I can go into that item room. So I'm pretty stoked.

33
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:44,870
The binding of Isaac. Okay, item room. Yeah, item room. It's a guaranteed item. Why the hell wouldn't I do that?

34
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:57,379
Damage up. Blood of the Martyr. I got a lot of items on right now. I am ready to rock. So wherever you are... Oh, he's down there, I remember.

35
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:06,019
I've also got pills. So I'm ready to go to caves, too. And you can take that to the bank, wherever this boss is right here.

36
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:16,310
I got full health. Two hearts. That sucks, but you know, whatever. All right. Isaac versus Fistula. That's not disgusting at all.

37
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:27,709
Oh, don't worry. You're not disgusting. I'm not looking forward to this. Whoa. Oh, my God. Pills. Take the pills.

38
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:37,769
What? What? What is going on? No, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Oh, that was so stupid. Hold on. Don't freak out.

39
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:48,000
You got this. Get the heart. Just get the heart. It's okay. It's right there. Nice. Nice. Okay, that was a minor freak out right there, but I did it.

40
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,139
And I got some lipstick. I don't really need range with this thing. It goes across the whole map. All right, let's move on.

41
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:07,779
Move on to the caves, too. Oh, this is gonna be nice. See ya. Can I beat this game? Please tell me I can just beat this game.

42
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:34,480
Please tell me I can just beat this game. TNT. Okay, let's go. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

43
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:44,939
God damn. So it turns out that that was not the best thing to do. I will get back up to that part.
