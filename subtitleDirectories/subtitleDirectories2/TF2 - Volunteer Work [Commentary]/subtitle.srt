00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:11,400
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary and tonight

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,280
I'm gonna play as the Engineer. It's been a while since, but I don't even know how long it's been

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,920
since a proper engineer gameplay commentary. I have no idea, but it's gonna be using the Frontier

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,039
Justice. I've put a couple clips together where this one I get 25 crits in the thing and I go

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,719
absolutely insane and the next clip is on offense with I think like 13 or 14 crits, but that's what

6
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,119
I'm showcasing here and it's gonna sit in the background. This is gonna be an update video

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:42,439
on where I've been and what I've been doing and where have you been for like eight days. It's

8
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:48,600
been like eight days. You don't go away for eight days unless something important's happening, so

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,899
let me explain. The reason why I've been gone so long is because I've been working on

10
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,460
some projects on and off of YouTube and the one we're going to talk about today is primarily

11
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,500
the one that's off of YouTube and something that I need to do, something that I want to do,

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,400
that I've always really wanted to do with myself, but never really jumped at the opportunity to do

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,760
it until now and maybe me talking about it a little bit might pique your interest in you doing

14
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:24,099
it as well or getting involved in something like this in your area. Volunteer work. Volunteering

15
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:29,540
primarily for me at an animal shelter. I'm starting today, it is Tuesday, I'm recording

16
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,659
this video, so I'm going to be starting there today as a volunteer at my local animal shelter

17
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:40,500
to help out with whatever I can, whether that be walking the dogs, playing with the cats, feeding

18
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,099
the animals, maybe helping out a little bit financially in some places. We need five pounds

19
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:50,099
of this dog food. I'll go get it. We need 20 pounds. We need like two 20 pound bags.

20
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:57,540
That's what I'm going to start to do with myself for at least a few hours a week and the whole

21
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,969
point of me doing this stemmed from I had this epiphany in the shower. A lot of you guys I know

22
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,819
I told you about how like when I take a dump or when I'm in the shower I think about things

23
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:11,939
and a lot of you guys might not know. I mean some of you do. I don't even remember if I talked about

24
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:18,120
it or not. My dog Otto, you haven't seen a whole lot of him and there's no real reason for that.

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,780
It's not like oh Otto is in such trouble. He has seizures and he's had a couple of real big ones

26
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,259
that were really really scary scary things where he had to be brought down to the ER.

27
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,580
He's had to go to the vet a bunch of times. We're trying to figure out what's what's wrong.

28
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,539
He's okay though. Like don't get don't take this as there's something really wrong with my dog.

29
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:43,770
He's fine. He's actually lying down right here next to me. He's okay. But I had this epiphany

30
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:53,080
where I said man it sucks when you an animal in your house or something that you love you watch

31
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,800
it get sick or you watch it and when we were in the ER I watched dogs come in cats come in they

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,330
looked one was like limping it was just like damn man like how do I help that how do I do something

33
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,520
about that like at least personally for me it was something I needed to do and I always thought that

34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,280
volunteer work I don't have the time for volunteer work. I can't make that time. I just can't do it

35
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,280
but then you then you realize let me look at my schedule here oh today wake up at 11 a.m.

36
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:30,840
check eat food at 11 30 or to check and play video games for six hours oh yeah that's good

37
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,520
that's busy work that's I've got that and go to sleep I just don't got the time I don't have the

38
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,250
time to do and that's that's where the epiphany came from. I love animals. I love working with

39
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:48,259
animals. I love talking to people. Why not? Why not give at least like a couple hours a week to

40
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:54,419
this? I don't know how it's going to go from here. I'm not sure if I'm going to be doing this more

41
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:59,620
closer to part-time in the future. I really have no idea. This is just a trial period for me guys.

42
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,300
I'm just trying to find more things to do and that's what I was talking about leave it like

43
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,759
throwing it to you guys like do any of you guys volunteer and if you do maybe you could give me

44
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,319
some of your experiences volunteering and maybe some things that I need to know going into

45
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,560
volunteer at an animal shelter or if you're going to volunteer at like your local homeless shelter

46
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,600
or something these are things that I am a total noob at and if you have any information on it I

47
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,079
would love to hear it and I'm sure some other people would love to hear your experiences as

48
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:33,079
well and we're trying to push positivity here right now guys I guess I'm trying to say if you

49
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,800
have time now I know a lot of people don't have time to volunteer you're working nine to five

50
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,319
every day maybe you have two jobs maybe you're in school you're in college and you just don't

51
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,800
you don't have a whole lot of time you're taking a bunch of classes or something this is not a video

52
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,279
to guilt trip people into volunteering at a anywhere please I really hope nobody takes

53
00:04:54,279 --> 00:05:00,120
this video like that it's mainly just to say in general it'll probably make you feel a lot better

54
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,839
about things it'll probably make you feel more positive I've heard stories that volunteering

55
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,639
is so rewarding when you do it because it just makes you feel so much better about the world

56
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,519
and you're trying to make something happen you're trying to change the world in as small a way as

57
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,899
you might think it is you're still doing it and that's pretty much where I'm going to leave this

58
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:23,819
video I just want to do a little update on where I've been the last week and what I've been doing

59
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:29,819
I've also got a couple of secret projects that I'm working on that I really hope you guys enjoy

60
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,339
that's been kind of going through into the pipeline and there's a lot of things I've been

61
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:37,420
doing on and off YouTube like I said in the beginning this is one of them and yeah just

62
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:55,110
an update of where I've been and hopefully you guys what am I doing no seriously what the fuck

63
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,649
am I doing right now um anyways guys I'll see you guys all next time uh take care everybody

64
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:03,050
