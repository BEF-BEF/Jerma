00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,500
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 Scream Fortress 2 Halloween Update for 2012.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Got a bunch of stuff to talk about, but first and foremost I wanted to say this first off the bat.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,500
There is a new seasonal key, the Eerie Key, and this will open up the Halloween themed crates.

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Just in case you want to know that, in case you want to start collecting those, they are now in the game.

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,500
As well as a bunch of other miscellaneous hats, and miscellaneous hats, hats and miscellaneous items that are crazy.

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,500
My favorite one so far is probably the Executioner. This one right here in the middle. It is just ridiculous.

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,500
I want to get that so bad, I was going to buy it, but I was like, no, I'll hold off for now.

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,700
But let's talk about what is in this update.

9
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,700
So the first thing that was added was, oh my, look at the top of the screen.

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:01,259
This is the new man versus machine level called Wave 666.

11
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:09,260
So as you can see by the top of the screen, it is an insanely massive one wave mission that you cannot do in man up mode.

12
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,260
This is only for the boot camp mode.

13
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,260
And look what happens here, it gives you a ton of money to spend on whatever you want.

14
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,260
Get out there and try to complete the entire wave.

15
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,260
I see 9 tanks, 40 huge demo man, 10 huge soldiers.

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,260
Look at all the stuff that comes out in this one wave.

17
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,260
It is probably incredibly intense, incredibly fun.

18
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,260
I had a little bit of trouble getting into a server, so I just wanted to show you guys what that looked like.

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,260
So now let's move on to what happened on King of the Hill Lakeside.

20
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,819
So King of the Hill Lakeside is the fourth map that Valve has turned into a Halloween wonderland.

21
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:45,819
And if you notice on the screen here, this is seven minutes against seven minutes.

22
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:49,819
It's not three, it is way, way longer.

23
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,819
And if you notice right there, somebody just capped the point.

24
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:57,000
Every single time somebody caps the point, it's going to do something crazy like this.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is actually my favorite one right here.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Making everybody dance and then all of a sudden, oh, time to fight now, time everybody shoot at each other.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,239
It's just total pure chaos.

28
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,240
And by the way, it is completely random.

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,240
There is no set rotation on any of these things.

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,240
It just spins the wheel of fate and whatever it lands on, that's what happens.

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Like this one, for instance.

32
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,240
This one reminds me, if anybody ever played GoldenEye, they had something called DK mode.

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,419
Where everybody's heads were just proportionately way too huge for their bodies.

34
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,419
And Valve takes it a little step further.

35
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:33,419
Valve actually drops the voice lines of everybody to sound like this.

36
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,419
They drop it really low.

37
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:37,419
That was a bad impression, but you get the idea.

38
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:40,719
And there's actually a whole wide range of these crazy weird things that can happen.

39
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,719
And I don't want to spoil them in the video because when I saw them for the first time, I was laughing my absolute butt off.

40
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,719
So I would like to keep that hush hush for now and for you guys to experience that on your own.

41
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,050
Now let's talk about the boss, Merasmus.

42
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,050
As he is the title character in this update.

43
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,050
Him and the soldier going back and forth.

44
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,050
And he is the cause of this whole problem going on here.

45
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,050
So what does he do and is he killable?

46
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,050
The answer is, I'm not actually sure.

47
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:14,050
Because all the times that all the servers have been into, even on my server, trying to kill this guy is really, really hard at the moment.

48
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,050
I'm not sure if we're doing something wrong.

49
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,050
I don't think we are.

50
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,050
But how the mechanic pretty much works is like this.

51
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,050
He's going to come out here, take regular damage and if he gets stunned.

52
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,050
And the only way he can get stunned is if you run into him as a bomb.

53
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,050
Which is something he periodically casts on random people.

54
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,050
I don't think there's a real set in stone way to get the bomb cast on you.

55
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:38,289
And once it's on you, you run around like a chicken with your head cut off and you run right into him.

56
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:39,460
That's going to stun him.

57
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,460
Once he's stunned, everybody will do crits to him.

58
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:49,639
And the person that stunned him actually gets an Uber charge to kind of negate some of the damage because they're right next to him.

59
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,639
The problem here is not so much that he has too much health.

60
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,639
He just disappears too quickly.

61
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,639
He's only really around for maybe a minute or two until he's gone.

62
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:05,639
And trying to coordinate this whole fight with a team, two teams fighting against each other is pretty impossible.

63
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,639
People are just killing each other.

64
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,639
People are running around shooting bombs and grenades and it's very hard to coordinate a whole team to do this.

65
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,639
Maybe if there was nobody else on the map and it was just the red team or just the blue team, I'd say this would be a little bit more easy.

66
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,009
And also on top of that, when you bring him down to about 50% health, he starts to play prop hunt with you.

67
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:31,009
He actually disappears and turns into a random prop that you have to find and kill the prop and he pops out of it.

68
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:34,009
So it gets even more crazy once you get to 50% health.

69
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:37,180
Oh, I also forgot to mention he can take crit damage when he's in the air too.

70
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:43,180
He does this crazy thing where he flies in the air and throws massive bombs at people and he takes 100% crits.

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,180
But still, it's pretty difficult in its current state.

72
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,490
But regardless of all of this, it's a great new update.

73
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,490
Scream Fortress 2012, I believe, is a success.

74
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:57,490
A lot of new collectibles, a lot of new cool things to pick up, a lot of crazy things going on in the world of Team Fortress 2.

75
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,490
But that is going to wrap up the video, guys.

76
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,490
So I'll see you guys all soon.

77
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,490
And happy Halloween, by the way.

78
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,490
If I don't say it again, which I probably will, happy Halloween.

79
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,490
And I'll see you guys all soon.

80
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,490
And of course, take care, everybody.
