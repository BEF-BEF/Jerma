00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,910
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jirba here with chapter 2 of

2
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:20,000
Nightmare House 2. And I'm just gonna go where we left off. I know a lot of you

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,410
guys wanted me to do the prologue and I absolutely will do that. I apologize.

4
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,210
I thought the prologue was just some kind of cutscene or something like that,

5
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:36,130
but that actually is Nightmare House 1, I think. So I will do that at the end of

6
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,289
this playthrough. I'll make sure to get that done. But in the meantime, let's go.

7
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:48,820
God, will you... What the hell? Enough with the jump scares in the first 11 seconds.

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:55,789
Anything over here? Get out of the way, you stupid thing. I have a gun at least

9
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:01,119
and I have bullets. I have... Turn up the flashlight. Radiology department. Never

10
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,140
lose hope hospital. Oh yeah, never lose hope except for the guy that like got

11
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:12,500
locked in there with a monster. God! How many shots does it take to kill a zombie?

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:20,010
Can I get in there? No. I only have 10 bullets. Are you absolutely kidding me?

13
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,680
X-ray, CT scan, MRI.

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,519
Okay.

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,719
Good to know. That's locked. This is locked. And come on, lucky number three.

16
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:50,870
They're all locked. Can I like break through or something? Oh, of course I can.

17
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,060
This guy's going to come alive, guaranteed. And like, he's going to start

18
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:04,280
attacking me and I'm going to scream. Three, two, one. Nope. I could do without

19
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:15,259
the flashbang in my face. All right, this is gruesome. Oh my God. Get this guy on

20
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:19,530
the wheelchair. Something horrible is going to happen right now. I'll take an

21
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:27,889
ice cold. I'll take an ice cold Dr. Pepper. I didn't even read the tagline. So

22
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:33,449
cold, it'll make you S bricks. I knew it was going to happen. What am I? Can I

23
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:40,120
like just hit him? I'm just like playing patty cake with this guy like, die, die,

24
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:50,740
die. Danger. Admitance to authorize personnel only. Which means me get some

25
00:02:50,740 --> 00:03:02,310
recharge my light. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Health kit. Probably shouldn't have

26
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:12,889
done that. Anything here? No. Where am I even supposed to be going? I don't like

27
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:31,300
that TV. Okay. Well, can I like make a collect call to my mother? Hi, Ma. It's

28
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,219
me. I just wanted to let you know that I'm in the middle of like a zombie like

29
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:41,629
apocalypse. And all the doors open. Okay, let's go into the radiology department.

30
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:45,870
All cell phones and electronic devices must turn this on. Oh,

31
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,509
yeah, I'm breaking the vital medical. I'm like smashing the medical equipment

32
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:59,569
right now. Anything even in here that I need to know about? A box of tissues can

33
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:07,580
blow my nose. Just keep going. Recharge the light. I can take this away.

34
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:20,259
To get in that door. Get out of here. Anything in here? Ooh. Bullets. Thank you

35
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:32,620
very much. I will take those. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? But what the

36
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:40,339
hell is going on? Come on here. I can't get out. I have no flashlight either. No.

37
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:55,040
God, why does she have to do that to me? What did I ever do to her? Okay. Oh, all

38
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,589
right. What do I do with this thing? I just drop it. All right, let's bring this

39
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:08,310
over here. Can I put this in here? Can I just fit in there? Just go in here. Go in

40
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,100
like that hole right there. Damn it. There's got to be a box right here

41
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,160
somewhere then, huh? I have no idea where to bring this damn thing. I'm just

42
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:29,970
carrying around this power supply. No, I have a feeling. What about in here?

43
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:37,269
There's another one. What's with these power supplies? Like, what am I supposed

44
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:51,209
to do with these things? What? What? What? What? God. Ow, my brain. Where did he go?

45
00:05:52,980 --> 00:06:01,930
I didn't just do that, did I? Can I get in here? I can. No. No, stop. It's totally

46
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:14,129
black. No bullets. And all these things. I just don't know what to do with these

47
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:17,779
things. I keep pulling out the power supplies, but I don't know what to do

48
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:23,259
with them. Maybe I bring the... I think I know what to do. This one's glowing. Where

49
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:30,939
is he? Where is he? Son of a... God, there's a couple of them. Go for headshots.

50
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,779
There's three of them!

51
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,339
Get away from me! Get away from me! Okay. Definitely have to bring this back and

52
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:54,050
put that in the other one. For sure. In here, right? Get in there. All right, what

53
00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:03,100
does that do? Is this operational now? It is. Okay. I have no idea what I just did,

54
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:12,600
but I did... Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. It's like everything's exploding. I can't... How am

55
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:22,610
I gonna get out of this room? Was that... What the hell? Was I supposed to do that?

56
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:39,779
What did I... Jeez. Now what? Oh, damn. It blew a hole in the wall. Okay. Get up

57
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:44,589
there, you bastard. Get up there. All right, we found a new little area here.

58
00:07:44,589 --> 00:08:03,209
No. Where are you? I don't know where you are. Locked. Oh, I thought I just saw

59
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:08,420
something. My whole body just tingled right... What's going on? What's going on?

60
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,439
Why can't I... Why can't I do anything? Was that guy in, like, a gym suit? What the

61
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:21,790
hell was that? I do not like that. That guy... Oh, it's another vent. Oh, great.

62
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:40,539
Another vent. Okay. How do I get up there? Can I, like, jump on something? Um, the

63
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:47,340
wheelchair? Sorry, whoever that was. I needed to use it. First of all, I am going

64
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,340
to recharge this light.

65
00:08:48,340 --> 00:09:21,700
Oh, that was ridiculous. Please don't just jump at me. What? How is that even

66
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:34,179
possible? That's impossible. Get out of my way. So glad I have a gun. Without this

67
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:54,659
gun. Hey. You can't even... Okay. They can't get in. That's okay. Yeah, no, no crap.

68
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,049
Oh, why isn't this guy here helping me with a gun or something? Go arm yourself

69
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:13,929
with a machine gun and get out here. Go get an assault rifle. Oh, I'm going to

70
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:29,340
throw up. Come on now, really? Get down. Storage. No, that's the... So what did I

71
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:35,669
just do? I came from here. This is the MRI machine. So I went down this way. Let

72
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:42,149
me try going over here now. No, I already went over here. Where is this girl? That

73
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:56,169
always means the girl's around. What the... Whoa. Hey. Well, that's not terrifying.

74
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:11,899
Get me out of here. Whoa. What? Oh, man. That's going to do it again, isn't it?

75
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:20,250
What the hell is that? Where's my flashlight? Where's my flashlight? There's

76
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:35,529
nowhere else to go. What is that? Is that a chair? It's a chair. Where am I? Where

77
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:57,700
am I? What's going on? Okay. Where am I? Where's my light? I think I'm alive. I'm

78
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:09,379
alive. That's good to know. Well, now what? Chapter three. All right, guys. Well,

79
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:16,200
that's going to be it for Scare Saturdays. Hope you enjoyed... That thing wasn't

80
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:25,720
human. That thing wasn't human. I will see you guys all next time, of course. And

81
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,480
take care, everybody.
