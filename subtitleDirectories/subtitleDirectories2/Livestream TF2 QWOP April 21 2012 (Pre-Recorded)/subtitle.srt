1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:13,259
Alright, so I think it's going. Hopefully there's no problems with the actual stream,

2
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:29,489
because that would not be cool. Twitch.tv. I gotta change this. It says I'm gonna be

3
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:46,130
playing CSGO, but that's not the case. That's gotta be changed. Yeah, the chat is lagging.

4
00:00:46,130 --> 00:01:00,530
I can't see any of these. The chat is all screwed up. That is not cool. I don't have

5
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,069
a solution to that, so I'm just gonna have to do it, play it by ear, and if something

6
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:11,980
happens, something happens, you know? Oh yeah, I'm trying to see how to spell principal right,

7
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:20,629
if you saw that in the Google chat. How do you spell principal? I don't know. Let's see

8
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:40,060
if I can pop this out. Alright, it's muted. Lower. Just want the chat. Mmm, that's not

9
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:55,010
working for me. That is not working for me. Come on Twitch, get your act together. I'm

10
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,859
refreshing the page. If you haven't chat problems, just try refreshing. Maybe that'll help. If

11
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:17,520
not, then I'm not exactly sure what to do. But it's okay. We shall persevere. Right there.

12
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:27,639
Okay, just gonna tell people what's happening on the various social media networks. It's

13
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:40,360
going on Twitter. And then, of course, the Steam group. Steam community groups. The inhumane

14
00:02:40,360 --> 00:03:03,699
psychopaths. Party. Twitch. Jot TV. Oh, by the way, I'm also sorry for starting this

15
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:15,379
pretty late. I was trying to get that video up and it was not working. Don't know why,

16
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:34,270
but it just wasn't. Oh, not in all caps. That's me screaming. Woohoo! Fifteen minutes. That

17
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:54,879
was me. And one more. Gotta tell all the people on the YouTubes about it. Channel feed. Streaming

18
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:14,939
TF2 and Flash game. HTTP. Alright. Okay. Good afternoon, morning, evening, night time, whatever

19
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:34,350
it happens to be in your quarters of the world. Welcome to the stream. Oh, Flash Gordon game.

20
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,750
So sooner or later here when I get my server up and running, we're not gonna have to do

21
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,689
more. It'll just be, hey, I'm in my server. Everyone go there if you want to play. Because

22
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:49,800
now it's kind of like, where are we gonna find a good map to play on? How about the

23
00:04:49,800 --> 00:05:00,110
Gold Rush? Alright, Gold Rush it is. Oh, no, wait, never mind. Refresh. It was like fifteen

24
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:17,399
people already in there. How about players are not full. That's fine. Alright, come on.

25
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,740
Stop with the refresh. Oh, come on. I just refreshed it again trying to hit stop refresh.

26
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:36,149
Why do you do that? Stop. Okay. How about, ooh, that one is Thunder Mountain. Cough Badlands.

27
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:47,019
King of the Hill Badlands. Here's the IP. Let's get started. And boom, heads in there.

28
00:05:47,019 --> 00:06:01,279
All hands on deck. King of the Hill Nucleus should be a rockin' time. It's 4.05 in California,

29
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,399
yeah? Yeah, I'm sorry for starting late. I said this before, but I'll say it again. It's

30
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,839
probably like seven in the morning or like five in the morning for people that are used

31
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,420
to seeing this at like, at least at a reasonable time, and I apologize for that. I usually

32
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,990
want to start at around 5.36, but 7.30 is when we're actually starting, and I feel bad

33
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:30,500
for you European guys. That's my fault, and I do apologize. What do I want to do now?

34
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:41,100
Let's go. Oh, I'm sure the audio is good. How's the in-game audio? Should it be lower

35
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,259
or higher? How does it sound? Who am I bumping into? You know, I'll stick with the Direct

36
00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:02,019
Hit. The chat's still broken. Yeah, I don't know. If you can not see the chat, I apologize.

37
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:09,160
There's nothing I can do. Oh, come on, you scout. Why am I using the...I have to touch

38
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:18,269
you, by the way. Come here! Oh, which way are you going to go? What? What was that?

39
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:23,670
Oh, it was a crit. Oh, okay. Yeah, the chat's not refreshing for me either. So I guess

40
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:30,850
just sit back and relax, and if you're playing, play, I guess. Five, four, three, long one.

41
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:36,850
I'm taking the Direct Hit off. Get rid of this thing. Why am I using the gunboats? What

42
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:43,629
on earth are these on here for right now? I'll keep the half-satoichi on. I'm not very

43
00:07:43,629 --> 00:08:00,339
good with the Direct Hit. It's hard. It's very hard to use. Where do you go? Where do you

44
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:13,100
go? Where do you go? I'm going to jump around. What's going on here? Super lag. Super lag.

45
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:26,699
Oh, no. Sentra down. I need help. I'm loaded all my shots in this shotgun. I don't know

46
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:41,340
how that happened. Oh, my God. Come on, something has to change. That's why. Sensitivity was

47
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:48,419
all a little low. I'm going to have to deal with it, though. So when are we going to get

48
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:56,419
an update? When's the Teeny Fortress update coming out? How am I not hitting him? I feel

49
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:08,240
like I'm lagging like crazy. I'm starting to go in a roll here. Ding ding. Oh, here comes

50
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:17,500
Burger Boy. I wonder who that is. That can't be Burger Boy right there, can it? Burger

51
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:35,820
Boy. Hold that point. I wish I could see the chat. I'm refreshing. I can't see the chat.

52
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,340
Maybe if I do this, I might be able to see the chat if I go to the dashboard. Maybe just

53
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:53,169
the actual chat is screwed up. Maybe not. Maybe not. Twitch, what the heck? I'm streaming

54
00:09:53,169 --> 00:10:06,730
on Twitch because YouTube is usually broken, and I guess not. I guess not, Twitch. Bing

55
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:22,250
bing bing. Oh, I'm going to get headshot. I know it. I know it. Run away. Oh, this guy

56
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:34,669
is screwed. Oh, I thought I killed him. You see that in the kill feed? It was like, oh,

57
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:46,309
nope, you killed the guy behind him. I think that was a dead ringer. I don't think he's

58
00:10:46,309 --> 00:11:01,850
dead. Pretty sure he's still alive. Might as well go get some health. Right. Boom. Fire.

59
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:11,860
Oh, no. We've got to get on this. Oh, jump around. So get off your feet and jump around.

60
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,529
Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. I don't know what the point of that was. Oh, my god. Oh,

61
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:32,389
no. No. I'm just jumping around like an idiot. I'm not. I'm doing okay. Still no chat. This

62
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:38,730
is what it looks like, by the way, for me. Like, the wheel of death. So I can't answer

63
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:47,379
your questions. Oh, that's stupid. I'm going to try refreshing it again. That's what it

64
00:11:47,379 --> 00:12:05,269
looks like. Unfortunately. Did I get the chat back? Did I? Of course not. Of course not.

65
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:17,090
That was a spy. My god. That was a dead ringer. Look out. Look out. Look out. Oh, that's going

66
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:23,100
to kill me. I need the equalizer. I need to put the equalizer on. We're going to lose.

67
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:35,029
If I can help it. Stay on it. Stay on it. Stay on it, my brethren. Get that spy and

68
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:45,220
the scout. Stay on it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Yes. Nice job. Nice job. Good

69
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:55,409
job, guys. Look at this guy just like hiding behind like the stakeout area. Oh, now I

70
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:03,279
got the chat. Okay. I just said MGE live streaming. That's the last thing I saw. I was going for

71
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,850
an air shot. I'm not hitting people with rockets right now. I think every single one of my

72
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:23,500
kills has been with the shotgun. Except for that one. Except for Burger Boy. Need help.

73
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:36,210
Come on. Hit him. Oh. No. No. No. No. I can't believe I'm that stupid. Oh, my god. What

74
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:46,080
is wrong with me? Yeah, good game, guys. Good game. Oh, my god. I'm just standing there

75
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:55,850
like scratching my butt. What is going on? What the hell is this? What is it? A prop

76
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:03,779
hunt mod? Wow. That's pretty cool. All right. We're going to go in. Whatever this is, I'm

77
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:15,000
using it. All right. Good. Oh, come on. Get hit marked. Get hit mocking. How did I lose

78
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:25,460
all that? I thought I was hitting people. Oh, now I can read the chat. Oh, god. So, yes,

79
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:31,659
I will talk about my Steam Workshop item. Oh, no, Burger Boy. Just punch him. My Steam

80
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:39,419
Workshop item is going well. The modeler behind it, he... Thank you, Optimus Prime. But the

81
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:43,169
modeler behind it, he had to take a little break from modeling because I think he just

82
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:47,009
had some school stuff he was trying to get out of the way and had some family things

83
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:54,559
he wanted to get done. So, it is still going. I got a pretzel in my mouth. I'm sitting here

84
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,240
eating pretzels and I can't even like... Yeah, so probably in a couple weeks, I would assume

85
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,539
will be more updates on that. And I'm going to die. It's going to take one shot. I'm going

86
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:10,679
to go down. Might as well make it epic. That is a spy. How come I didn't get any medal

87
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:19,659
for this? Was that not really a spy? I swear I bumped into him. I swear to every single

88
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:27,580
deity that exists, I was bumping into that guy. Oh, man. Look at all these dudes in here.

89
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:36,019
Yeah, the pretzels are meeting. They're the small... Look at them. Look at me. I'm like,

90
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:46,139
hey, I got one hand playing it. Okay, okay. Let me wash this down first. Before, I was

91
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,820
an idiot. Oh, I got a kill. They're the small cylinder pretzels, like the ones that are

92
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,980
the best ones. I'm not a big fan of the really skinny ones. If you guys know what I'm talking

93
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:03,379
about, the tiny little skinny baby pretzels. Eh, not for me. Now, let's actually start

94
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:19,179
playing this game. You know what? I want this. There we go. Are you a spy? I bet you are.

95
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:28,899
Oh, no. Here comes Burger Boy. The insensitive one. Demo ends with spy. I can't. I got to

96
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:40,240
shoot somebody. Come on. One good meat shot on someone. Do you want some hats? Germa?

97
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,750
No, I'm good. I'm good to go. Thank you for offering, though. I appreciate that. I don't

98
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:58,570
need any items or anything. Oh, boy. Pyro coming in. Come on. Come on. Oh, no. I'm dead.

99
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:09,460
I didn't mean to taunt, by the way. I was just trying not to die. The chat is back.

100
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:17,329
Thank goodness. Can I play some payload? Of course. I'm going to try and find a good Gold

101
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:25,220
Rush or Bad Water map after this. What are we looking like? That's spy. I don't know

102
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:36,549
why. I'll put it right here. Give me those hit markers. Oh, gosh darn it. Am I a fan

103
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:44,700
of Frank Sinatra? Yeah. Who couldn't be with a voice like that? Luck be a lady tonight.

104
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:52,519
Luck be a lady tonight. Luck if you ever kill Germa in Team Fortress. Luck be a scout tonight.

105
00:17:52,519 --> 00:18:00,529
I apologize for doing that. That was not cool. Oh, my God. I'm going to die again. No. Can

106
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:10,220
I make it? Take your bats. Do I make it? Do I make it? Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, come on.

107
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:19,710
I had my finger touching. I was reaching for it, too, and everything. Give me a break.

108
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:26,339
Oh, well. All right. This time. Every time I get out of spawn, something bad happens.

109
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:37,059
Getting kills with a mini sentry. That's one good thing that comes out of all this. I'm

110
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:49,170
going to move it. I want it up here. Oh, my God. You toast bastard. How much was TF2?

111
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:55,950
TF2 was $10. I think it was originally $20, wasn't it? $19.99 for a while. Then it went

112
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,190
to $9. Did it ever go to $9.99? I don't remember it being $9.99. Maybe it's because I just

113
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:07,779
never bought it. That's a crit. I'm dead. I was trying to strafe and drop down, not

114
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:12,450
in the pit, and I ended up landing on the crit. Well, you know what? We're going to

115
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:21,430
change this. Oh, by the way, I'm going to say this here just because, you know, it makes

116
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:27,259
sense to say it here. I still have to give away 33% of that backpack because it's been

117
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:33,609
about five days and the third person still has not responded. So I'm going to give them

118
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:40,210
maybe another 48 hours, and if I still don't see anything, we're going to talk about maybe

119
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:47,319
another small giveaway, potentially in the stream. So I might not do it. If I do it on

120
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:53,339
Twitter, I do it on Twitter, but I've not decided at this point what I'm going to do.

121
00:19:53,339 --> 00:20:05,089
I'll probably just repick. Ow. Oh, put me out. Put me out. I was behind you. I have

122
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:15,750
not played Gotham City Impostors. I heard it's fun, though. Are we going to win? Oh,

123
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:26,759
they're going to get it. They are absolutely going to get this. I'm going up here. I'm

124
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,339
absolutely going up here. I'm protecting this room. This health is mine for the rest of

125
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:41,359
this god damn game. Oh my god. What's going on? What? What is it? What's happening? Oh

126
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:52,880
my god. During the live stream. Um, hold on. Hold on a sec. That just took me totally off

127
00:20:53,559 --> 00:21:02,369
guard. Um, thank you so much for that. Hold on. Let me accept it. Hold on. Let me even

128
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:10,519
see what just even happened. Hold on. I got to duck away for one second. Oh, we won. Okay,

129
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:19,660
cool. What is that? What's happening right now? Where is it? You've received a gift.

130
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:27,779
Total War Shogun 2. Oh my god. Oh, this is from my wedding partner. Oh my god. I have

131
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:31,980
to show this. I forgot to show this off. So this guy right here, this Suicidal Engineer

132
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:40,220
is what his name is. He sent me the ring. Where is it? Where's my diamond ring? Look

133
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,490
at that. Special something for special someone. So thank you so much. I wanted to really mention

134
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,329
that. But yes, I will accept this. Yeah, this is like the Team Fortress 2 like Valentine's.

135
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:56,420
It's not wedding. It's like Valentine's Day. But yeah. Special shout out to that guy because

136
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:01,990
that's really, really thoughtful. So now I've got to accept your gift. I don't even know

137
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:11,380
how to do it. Where is it? All right. I accept. Thank you. Thank you so much. Add to my game

138
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:16,579
library. I will absolutely play this. Thank you so much. That's all I can say. You're

139
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:23,220
awesome. Thank you. Oh, our little Jervish growing up now. Yeah, that's awesome. That's

140
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:34,359
not a good way to go. Yeah, I did see the new Grordbord stuff. The new Grordbord. How

141
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:45,940
do you even say that? I always say that wrong. Grordbord. Grordbord. Gordbot. Oh my god.

142
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:52,799
Every time. Every time I exit spawn. All right. You know what? I'm going. I am going to just

143
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,579
plant. You know what? No. I'm killing this guy first. Before running away. That works

144
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:05,460
as well. Protect this room. Let's at least get some area denial going here. This guy's

145
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:11,829
down here. This guy knows I'm here. Where is he? Change it. Right here. Oh what? What?

146
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:22,289
That's a big sentry. That is a big sentry. My goodness. No. My god. All right. All right.

147
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:30,960
Time to go scout. Time to go scout. I'm going to use. Oh no. Oh that's right. You know what?

148
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:44,789
For the sake of my backpack being gone, we're going to go all default. At least item wise.

149
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:57,019
You are not real. And you're probably still alive. I can't believe I just did that. I

150
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:01,980
can't believe it. I can't believe that just happened. I can't believe I just did that.

151
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:12,380
I got behind two people. I want to just go punch myself in the face with like an iron.

152
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:21,670
Oh my god. That is really depressing. You know what I mean? It's just like I got behind

153
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:37,470
those two guys. That one soldier. And there was a crit. And I missed. There's a spy coming

154
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:50,549
up. I need help. He's going to headshot me. This always happens. Why did I just hit E?

155
00:24:50,549 --> 00:25:06,700
God. This is a spy. Maybe not. Let's bump. No. It's Ari. Hey Ari. That's a bad place

156
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:19,420
to go. What? What? What just happened? That guy shot me through the staircase. I am mad.

157
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:28,460
All right. I'm putting the milk on. I need my milk. I need my calcium. Calcium for the

158
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:38,480
week. If I were to have any unusual effect on a hat or any unusual, I would want the

159
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,220
what is it? The searing towering pillar of hats. Because that is not worth like five

160
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,289
million dollars or something. That's like a lot of money. Two soldiers. I can't deal

161
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:58,480
with that. And a scout. And I have milk. And I threw it. Oh my goodness gracious. How much

162
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,480
what? Somebody tell me. What is the most expensive Team Fortress hat? Like in dollars. In U.S.

163
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,259
dollars. Is it searing towering pillar or a sunlight towering pillar? Is it like two

164
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:17,980
thousand dollars or something crazy? What is the approximation? The value of that item?

165
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:33,779
Oh boy. I'm in trouble. Someone just has to like burp on me and I'm going to die. Please

166
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:45,250
don't burp on me. I don't want to die. There we go. I have played L.A. Noir. Oh. What?

167
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:50,740
Oh. That just made me sad what just happened. I'm not even mad about that. I'm just like

168
00:26:50,740 --> 00:27:02,220
upset. I just want to cry. Game to game. Sunbeam's TC is about 40 buds. So how much is one bud?

169
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:16,339
U.S. dollars. Get in there. Did I get him? Get rid of that mini sentry. I can't even

170
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:26,619
go over there. I can't even go anywhere. I can't take you anywhere scout. Hi spawn. Bye

171
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:39,259
spawn. I can't go over there. God. Oh that's not the right taunt. Wait we failed. Wait

172
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:50,990
I thought we were winning. I thought we had the point. Well that's uh. So one bud is 35

173
00:27:52,109 --> 00:28:00,900
dollars. So that's a lot of money. That is a lot of money. Let's go to. Alright new server.

174
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:06,670
Thanks to you guys on this server right now. We're going to trade. Trade servers. Let's

175
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:12,069
try and get on a payload. Payload race. No no payload race. I don't like payload race.

176
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:19,420
I do but it can be too chaotic. Peel bad water. Too many bots. People won't be able to get

177
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:25,900
in so easily. Here we go. Hoodoo. There we go. Absolutely freaking lootly hoodoo. It's

178
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:36,220
going in the chat right now. This is the IP. There you are. Ladies and gents. The last

179
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:41,779
giveaway winner. I sent him a Twitter message and he still hasn't replied. I'm going to

180
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:50,579
shell check right now. That was a long time ago. That was a while ago. So be on the lookout

181
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:54,779
in the next week or the next 3 or 4 days. I may be picking another person on Twitter

182
00:28:54,779 --> 00:29:09,920
for this 33% of this backpack. I want all your items. I'm probably going to play tower

183
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:18,700
defense again because that was always fun. Bloons tower defense. Here's the IP again

184
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:25,619
for those of you wondering. That is the IP right? Let me make sure. Yes it is. That is

185
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:35,900
the IP. Do. I don't think I've really ever done the scope sniper on a stream before so

186
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:42,440
you know what? We're going to do it. I need like a hat. I need like a hat. One of these

187
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:51,839
like party hats and like sunglasses. Oh yeah. High five. Ship boom. Pro ping right here.

188
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:58,660
How much ping? That's not that bad Norman. That's not too terrible. I'd say if you got

189
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:11,339
to like 160 or 150 you should start to count your blessings. Oh my god Boo. Yeah Boo sorry

190
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:17,589
there's like no Skype call. I was running very very very late. More than an hour late

191
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:28,380
to the stream so I had to just go. What is this guy doing? That guy was like standing

192
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:39,039
in the creator character position. You know what? This is a bad spot. I'm going to get

193
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:52,349
in trouble. Yeah I knew it. That's a bad spot. Late to his own stream as usual. Yeah I do

194
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:59,099
frequently. I'm always at least 5-10 minutes late. Hey better late than never though right?

195
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:10,559
Isn't that the old adage? Is that even an adage? Oh my cat's in here now going. Let's

196
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:19,000
get a couple of headshots huh? There goes the engineer that's in like the creator character

197
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:33,359
stance. What? Oh boy. I didn't cover him. My god what a total idiot I am. Stop the

198
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:45,660
bloody boom. Ow. Right in my face. Am I going to play Left 4 Dead 2? Probably not on this

199
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:54,220
stream tonight but I absolutely love that game so probably at some point yeah. Will you stop

200
00:31:54,220 --> 00:32:13,390
meowing? You're ruining my stream cat meowing. Oh my god. Hey you look like you could use

201
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:22,579
some pee on your back. I'll like throw it right into one of my teammates backs. I just

202
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:32,799
puked cat. Oh I got to switch. I got to go heavy. They're going to win. Got to go heavy

203
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,519
with the brass beast and I'm just going to stand in a corner and just hold down this

204
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,319
damn button. Come on come on come on come on. Don't let them get it. Don't let them

205
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:54,029
get it. No. No I got to get right up on here. Bye. Oh my god I'm going to die. I'm just

206
00:32:54,029 --> 00:33:04,200
going to eat the sandwich on the cart. Oh my god. Oh yeah. Heavy turtling. What do you

207
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:14,740
know about heavy turtles? The two heavy turtles. This is actually going to work. Who needs

208
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:32,119
sentry guns when you've got three super heavies? Are these two the same person? Oh hear me.

209
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:43,829
Help me. Teenage mutant ninja heavy alien turtles. So I know I asked this before but

210
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:47,549
I couldn't see the chat. Is the audio fine? Can you hear me and is the stream too loud

211
00:33:47,549 --> 00:34:06,380
or are we just right as Goldilocks would say? That's good. That's good. Ha! You cannot

212
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:14,360
defeat the heavy. I just bumped into someone for sure. You can always tell when, you know,

213
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,880
you never know if it's lag or you're actually bumping into someone and that's, I don't want

214
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:27,139
to get hit by that again. Oh for the love of all that is sacred. Ditto zero zero zero.

215
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:40,130
How are you man? Look at, I love this heavy. Look at this guy. That is a true heavy right

216
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:48,099
there. Standing on the cart with sunglasses, a luchador mask and a Russian hat on. What

217
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:59,730
a goofy goofy person. I love him. Oh my goodness. Oh I have on the Brass Beast. Can't move.

218
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:07,409
Must punch someone in face. Nope not going to happen. I heard a backstab. I'm so scared

219
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:17,900
right now. That is the worst part about the Brass Beast. If you get ubered and there's

220
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,900
people like 50-100 feet away from you, it's all over. Because by the time you run up there,

221
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:34,449
it's just like, oh everyone just turn around the corner and run away. I'm sorry. You know,

222
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:50,300
we could use, I don't know what I want to do. Pyro. Saddled him. Going pyro. Best guerrilla

223
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,539
song is absolutely stylo. Either stylo, oh you know what, this is going to sound weird

224
00:35:54,539 --> 00:36:06,739
but I actually like dare. For use of that song. I do know the lyrics of the song but

225
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:14,210
they're very odd. Oh pyro on pyro fight. That's, you are not real. That's not me. I didn't

226
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:22,739
just look in a mirror. That wasn't me. Bumping into somebody. Watch your backs. Oh he turned

227
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:34,360
and just smoked me. I started listening to the guerrillas because well they are a great

228
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:45,539
band. I'm glad you got to listen to them because they're awesome. My cat right now is just

229
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:52,480
sitting underneath, literally just sitting underneath my legs. Just rubbing up against

230
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,239
my legs over and over again and I just want to be like cat get out of here but I can't

231
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:25,530
because he's too cute. Die. Die. How much health do you have? Kill me. Oh we found

232
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:45,659
him. We got a winner. We got a winner. Come here. Come here. Watch out. No. No. Stay alive.

233
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:57,920
I need, I'm going to run out of ammo. Oh shoot me. Shoot me. Shoot me. Oh that would have

234
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:08,139
been a crit. Get him. Oh my god. What just happened? Somebody look at the, look what

235
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:15,920
just happened. What just even happened right there guys? I, what did I reflect? I tried

236
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:23,880
to put the heavy that was on fire. What even just happened? That was very very odd. Maybe

237
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:32,969
I reflected a, I'm so confused. Oh let me like put this heavy out and hear like the

238
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:39,239
crit noise and then kill somebody. Like what? So if that was you that I just killed I have

239
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:59,639
no idea how it happened. Whoa. Oh he's a sniper. Damn. Whoa hold on. Stop freaking out here.

240
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:13,250
Gotcha. Back the car. No. Back the car. Oh my god they're going to win. Oh sup burger.

241
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,380
Sup burger boy. You got to like, are you raging yet? Are you on, oh you're on this. No you're

242
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,699
on the other team. Burger boy why are you not like freaking out right now? No. No. No.

243
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:35,570
Trying to put people out. Oh man. Nice team Uber. Nice team Uber Ari. Oh here it comes.

244
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:45,460
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. I'm upset. I'm going medic. I thought for sure I was going

245
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:55,719
to time that but he had the direct hit. He got killed by Herp and Dirk. At the same time

246
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:03,400
they both killed me. Where is grandpa? Did you see my latest vlog talking about that?

247
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:12,630
Oh my god. Spies everywhere. In my latest vlog I talk about grandpa. Oh my god they're

248
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:28,210
behind us. No don't die. Just, I'm going to sit down here. No I'm not. Oh god. Oh my

249
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:34,539
god. I was so concerned about getting shot from behind from people on the cart but I,

250
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:45,260
oh we won. There we go. I do want to play Grand Theft Auto on a stream. I really do.

251
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:50,659
It's just the only problem with Grand Theft Auto is it's very poorly optimized on the

252
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:56,570
PC so it can be very difficult to even record that game. So it's something I would have

253
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:01,929
to look into trying to make it run at a little bit lower settings maybe because that game

254
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:10,119
takes almost like 5,000% like CPU when you try and play it on like good settings. Now

255
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:14,650
this will be the last round in this server and we're going to go somewhere else. Oh look

256
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:22,989
at you. You match. Don't you just look so beautiful. Alright here we go. Ship bank.

257
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:34,650
Oh look my spray. My spray's cold. Who wants this? Who's getting this? I don't know yet.

258
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:39,369
You're all good players. I don't know who's going to get it. I guess the person that I

259
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:48,980
do it to is the person that's going to get it. So be on the lookout. No trades. Not right

260
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:56,579
now. Look at what you guys are doing. And why is everybody pink? Everybody's like, we're

261
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:07,619
about to go like driving Miss Daisy. And do it. Demo spam everywhere. What is happening?

262
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:20,659
Oh my god. Am I excited for Borderlands 2? Yeah I guess. Borderlands 1 I was, I had a

263
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:26,000
good time with it. But I don't know. You have to really play that game with other people.

264
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,489
You can't really play that game alone. It's too, it's just not my type of game to play

265
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:38,949
by myself. But I would probably play it with other people for sure and make videos. Absolutely.

266
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:44,340
Is there a spy for sure? Like look at this crowd of people. There's got to be a spy stuck

267
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:51,590
somewhere in here. Oh my god where are you? I need to heal you. I just saw him. Come here.

268
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:58,869
Come here. Come here. Oh. Hey at least I did that right? At least I said, at least I avenged

269
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:08,739
you. Oh Ari are you ready? Boom. Crits everywhere. Probably should have saved that but you know,

270
00:43:08,739 --> 00:43:21,909
oh my god. No, no. Get out of here. Oh I backed up right into a knife. Right into a knife.

271
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:28,449
I'm going to spell out what I want to say but I'm not going to say it. S-H-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-T.

272
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:33,889
And then as many exclamation points you can put on the end of that sentence. That's how

273
00:43:33,889 --> 00:43:50,869
I feel right now. I got you. I got you. Put that away. Let me heal you. Final push. Oh

274
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:54,510
wouldn't it be great to be on defense right now with a critscreek as a demo man and kill

275
00:43:54,510 --> 00:44:01,349
every single person standing right here. My goodness. I think we're going to get it. Let's

276
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:11,559
try and get these people to stay and heal. That's one way. Alright nice job guys. Crit

277
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:18,559
needles. Oh my god. They just respawned. Oh my god. You want to talk about a way to burn

278
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:27,380
out a hard drive? A graphics card? Oh my god. Speaking of that, let me make sure I'm not

279
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:40,409
going to explode here. I say this every time. No I'm good. We're good to go. Alright changing

280
00:44:40,409 --> 00:44:55,320
servers one more time. Disconnect. Browse servers. Refresh. Favorite classes engineer

281
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:01,940
then probably huntsman sniper. I don't know. I change it. My mind changes on a daily basis

282
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:11,980
so it's hard to say what my favorite class is. Let's go to a... We can always go to good

283
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:19,860
old gravel pit. Gravel pit for sure. Play a couple more rounds on here. There's the

284
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:34,579
IP. Oh there's decals. Maybe it's going to be cool looking. Maybe. Maybe. The reason

285
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:40,460
why I don't accept trade requests during streams is because I like to keep the action as high

286
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:45,619
as I can keep it. I'm sure people don't want to... Oh I'm going to trade. What am I going

287
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:49,690
to get? Let's do some trading. I guess maybe that could be entertaining to some people

288
00:45:49,690 --> 00:46:00,789
but I like to keep the action flowing. I'll go blue this time. And I'm going to play with

289
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:08,730
my revolver. My spicycle. I just got this. I might as well use these things. Totally

290
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:23,869
strange brain. I don't have a strange sapper. Too bad. Too bad. Medic! Doctor! Medic! Doctor!

291
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:34,159
Doctor! Alright that's enough of that. Wait a second. I thought I was waiting for set

292
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:40,900
up time. Apparently there's no... Okay. It's just happening. Oh I'm looking at the chat

293
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:50,199
right now. I'm not even looking at my screen. I just tried to give it. That's weird. Okay

294
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:59,059
so the chat just screwed up. Can anyone see what I just wrote by the way? Can you guys

295
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:11,579
see the IP? Because apparently it's Twitch. What are you saying Burger Boy? Oh Burger

296
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:21,099
Boy. Blue's capture. I'm so confused right now. I think I'm playing. I don't know why

297
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:32,519
I think I'm red. I'm looking at the chat. Oh my goodness. Pull out the dead burger.

298
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:42,860
I don't have it. I do have it. Hey I'm a scout. Don't shoot me. Oh no. Oh god. Oh god. Oh

299
00:47:50,320 --> 00:48:08,949
god. Run. Oh no. Please. Oh. So did you guys hear my idea for a spy video? I think I said

300
00:48:08,949 --> 00:48:20,179
it last stream. Oh my god. Oh my god. That is... That is a... If you've never seen that

301
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:32,349
spray before that is Burger Boy spray. And he is a disgusting human being. God dang it.

302
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:43,960
I'm in trouble. Hey. I'll just go this way then. Instant respawn. My goodness. I think

303
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:52,960
we're about to win. Alright let's get like a new round started so I'm not so confused.

304
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,699
I don't want to be confused. I don't want to fall asleep cause I... That's two songs

305
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:09,949
combined in one. I'll miss you babe. And I don't want to miss a thing. Cause even when

306
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:21,690
I... Oh my god. Come on. My hands are in my face right now. I really thought I was going

307
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:29,460
to get that stair step. I really thought I was going to get it. And it didn't happen.

308
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:38,250
And I crouched in everything. I did. I crouched. I did crouch. Oh you're going to taunt? Are

309
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:50,139
you ready to get head shot? He's going to get away. Oh. Just running right into people

310
00:49:50,139 --> 00:50:15,639
again. Oh my god. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm just going to be like the tank. Yeah heal

311
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:23,260
me. Spy's not working right now. I'm not playing spy anymore. When I... A lot of you guys know

312
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,429
this. I've said this before. Playing spy on a live stream is like pulling teeth out of

313
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:33,960
my brain. Like when I play spy I need 100% concentration. And if I don't have that it's

314
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:51,849
like I am essentially regressed to being like 9 years old. Oh dat live com. Oh my goodness.

315
00:50:51,849 --> 00:51:01,099
Did they even have... Okay that didn't hit anybody. Oh my god. Bottle. Attack of the

316
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:15,989
bottle. Oh. Kroba. Kroba is my best friend on this team. Because his name is Kroba. And

317
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:42,760
I can say it. Walking lord. You want to go bottle? You want to go with the bottle? He's

318
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:54,840
gone. He's gone. Don't worry we got it. We got it. We're good. Where is it? Is there

319
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:04,400
something up there? There's nothing up here. Except this one dude. Oh. I'm like a hippie.

320
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:19,960
Rocket. Woohoo. Flying demo man. Here we go. Boink. Oh yeah. You know I'm going to take

321
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:30,670
this off. I'm going to put on the weed booties. And the frying pan. We're going to go sticky

322
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:44,579
tank. Sticky tank. Sticky tank. Worst item in the game? Oolipool caper. In my opinion.

323
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:51,150
I do not like that thing. I think it's just a dumb weapon. I don't know. I never use it.

324
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:57,300
And I think it's just a suicide weapon in my opinion. Which there's not something terribly

325
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:05,219
wrong with that. I build your uber for you. Look. Oh I missed the high five. I'm sorry.

326
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:09,719
Alright. Ready. Place your bets. How many people are going to watch the stream right

327
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:19,590
now and see what I'm doing and just not open this door? I bet every single person is not

328
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:32,280
here right now. Except for this one dude who might die. No. Oh I just waited one more second.

329
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:55,860
Sticky tank. They're all going. Hey. Get over here. Oh he's not dead. Oh for the love of

330
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:06,349
goodness gracious. Oh my god. Get rid of this guy. Blowing us all around like pot pockets.

331
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:23,289
That analogy did not make very much sense. Now did it? I wonder what that looked like

332
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:30,969
on his screen. That must have been so funny. He must have saw that. What? What? Oh he's

333
00:54:31,050 --> 00:55:00,739
up there. Oh my god dude. Oh that was so funny. Defend the point. Oh another lucky crit. I'm

334
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:11,809
sorry about that. I backed into another knife. Gosh darn it. With a capital D. Is the chat

335
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:20,170
slow for anybody? I can't see anything. There we go. Absa-positive elutely my friend. Towering

336
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:35,369
pillar of hats. Two dudes with it. Except I'm not going to have it for very long. Oh

337
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:44,579
my god you are a spy. He's still alive. How many does it take? I do play in windowed mode.

338
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:57,579
I have to. Just stream it. How much health does he have? He must have a bunch of heads.

339
00:55:57,579 --> 00:56:10,019
I don't trust you. I don't trust you you snake. Oh don't you back up into that. I can't believe

340
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:23,269
I didn't hit him. I am so shocked and appalled. Oh my god. There he is. Why? I thought we

341
00:56:23,269 --> 00:56:29,780
got rid of him. I thought somebody killed him. How many spies are on that team? One

342
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:46,820
two three four three. Yeah I'm not doing too well either so don't worry. I'm on that guy's

343
00:56:47,820 --> 00:57:02,949
head. I'm scared. If I was standing that would have been so cool. Of course I put the crit

344
00:57:02,949 --> 00:57:11,340
down right in front of my face. Is that guy still up here? I think he is. Oh yeah he is.

345
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:19,920
I found him. Alright no more demo man. Not doing hot with him. Let's go back to Pyro.

346
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:36,530
Do reserve shooter. Come here let me put you out. Engineer. Dude I'm just the designated

347
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:54,429
putter router people of person. God let me reload. Good good good. Oh god crit screak.

348
00:57:54,429 --> 00:58:02,000
I don't know if you want to give it to me. Might be a total failure. Oh my god how-

349
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:17,780
He's still up there. Oh get rid of him. Oh no. How are you still alive? I need more bullets

350
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:30,460
in this damn thing. What's my opinion on the royal wedding? That's cool I guess. People

351
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:38,170
getting married. It's whales right? Prince I think I could be totally wrong. Boo don't

352
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:43,559
be mad at me if I don't know that answer. Of course if you don't know Boo, BooMan61 is

353
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:51,829
a Eastman. No that's a little bit of a- I'm trying to think of the word. Trivia. I'm sure

354
00:58:52,150 --> 00:59:03,519
everyone knows that anyways. Oh jeez. That guy did a double jump. Oh yeah. Let me get

355
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:14,530
stuck on the wall. Lagging very badly. I'm sorry. I apologize for the lag dude. I'm sorry.

356
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:32,599
Let's go this way. Yeah it's true. Oh come on. I have new items. What? I haven't died

357
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:43,630
yet. I got a feeling that there's a lot of people trying to- What even killed him on

358
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:55,039
the century? Mini century. It wasn't just a century it was a gosh dang mini century.

359
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:16,090
Oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy. Oh no no. Oh come on kill everybody. Oh at least I got two

360
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:22,480
or three people. Brass beast. Two and two on this guy. I haven't seen this guy in a

361
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:30,449
little while. This guy las. The chat is not loading for me so if you- What the hell? What

362
01:00:30,449 --> 01:00:38,210
the- Well that's one way to die. Yeah the chat is not loading. What the hell is going

363
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:53,829
on here? Chat bastard. Cat. Stop yelp cat. Do I speak English? It depends on if I'm playing

364
01:00:54,469 --> 01:00:58,869
a game and talking. At that point probably not. Probably speaking some other language

365
01:00:58,869 --> 01:01:08,739
and nobody knows. I don't know how I didn't hit him in the first one. Will you be quiet

366
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:35,599
cat? You're messing with my feng shui. Or is that spy? Oh die. Oh god there's people

367
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:48,739
everywhere. Oh right into- Walked right into him. Favorite movie is probably- Now that

368
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:53,570
is a tough question because then you have to talk about The Dark Knight, Memento, Ghostbusters.

369
01:01:53,570 --> 01:02:00,579
I cannot pick a favorite movie. No way. Even if I tried. Even if I really wanted to tell

370
01:02:00,579 --> 01:02:18,699
you. Get him in the air. This guy's getting unusual. He means business. Oh let's go. Let's

371
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:25,179
rock out. I don't even care anymore. I'm just running into like an idiot. Fight Club is

372
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:31,940
also an amazing one. Ghostbusters. You never seen Ghostbusters before? If you've never

373
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:38,420
seen Ghostbusters, go. Go. Go do it right now. Go. Go to Netflix dot- I mean isn't even

374
01:02:38,420 --> 01:03:03,960
on Netflix? I don't even know. Eight damage. Hitting me. There you go. Oh if I had a shot.

375
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:16,059
If I had a damn shot. There's how you shoot somebody in the face. How come I didn't hit

376
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:22,900
anybody? I didn't get a crit with that? Actually maybe I did. Probably just didn't show up.

377
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:33,889
Two minutes left. Hello spy. You happen to be in the base. Red spy in the base. Blue

378
01:03:33,889 --> 01:03:53,659
spy in the base. Actually. Make sure no Rapscallions are coming up behind us. Damn it. What? How

379
01:03:53,659 --> 01:04:02,079
did that not hit that dude? Just barely killed him. No. Stay away from my medic. I'm trying

380
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:22,030
to keep him away from you. No. I'm going to have to catch him off guard. For sure. Oh

381
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:36,179
he was just- Oh my goodness. How is he not going to die from that? I was going to say.

382
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:48,110
Oh get up in the air again. I'm sorry. I can't protect you. No. Leave my spedic alone. Watch

383
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:59,659
yourself. I don't have any air blast left. Retreat. Retreat. Crit to the face. I think

384
01:04:59,659 --> 01:05:09,719
we're going to get it guys. See if any craziness happens at the very end. Oh don't jump. Probably

385
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:17,119
be a good idea to- Oh my god. That guy came out of nowhere. Might as well sit on the point

386
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:24,739
and just do this. And just air blast anyone that tries to jump up here. Nice game guys.

387
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:36,809
Oh. Alright. So I think I'm going to transition now to play some Bloons Tower defense. I'm

388
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:46,920
going to play until I die. Well hopefully I do. I'm going to go one more life. So if

389
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:57,559
I- Next time I die. My last life. I've been streaming TF2 for about an hour and ten minutes.

390
01:05:57,559 --> 01:06:15,880
Just about an hour. A full sixty minutes. Yeah Bloons is fun man. Ten hour games by

391
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:29,579
play. Is Bloons 5 out? Can I play that? I've never had Bloons from my iPhone. I've got

392
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:33,989
to do that. My god. Alright so if you want to keep playing Team Fortress the only way

393
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:38,940
it's going to happen is if there's like nine medics on me. You know what? Let's do it.

394
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:45,980
Let's do it. Everyone on blue go medic. We'll see how long this lasts. If you are on blue

395
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:54,059
just go medic. And just octo heavy me. I wonder how long I will stay alive. This is the last

396
01:06:54,059 --> 01:07:05,969
life. Here we go. Oh my god. Oh this is an immediately rigged fight. Is it even like

397
01:07:05,969 --> 01:07:16,460
possible to die? I don't even think it's possible to die. Oh my god. Oh my god. Unless I get

398
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:32,769
backstabbed. There's no way I'm going to die. It just hurts to laugh. Oh what a bunch of

399
01:07:32,769 --> 01:07:50,289
nonsense. Oh my- No don't kill my medics I need them. Oh no we lost quite a few. Oh no.

400
01:07:56,059 --> 01:08:04,659
Oh I'm going to like pass out man. I just like laughed too hard. Oh my face hurts. We really-

401
01:08:04,659 --> 01:08:11,440
No there's no way this is going to work. There's no way this is going to work. If this actually

402
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:21,359
works no way. No my battalion. I'm going to get backstabbed. It's going to end it. The

403
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:32,369
backstab's going to end it all. No don't kill me. Oh my god they're all going spy. They are

404
01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:50,659
all going spy. Everybody went spy. No no no no no. Oh well you did it and I think we won.

405
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:57,010
Did we win? Did we just win the game right there? Oh come on we gotta win. We gotta win.

406
01:08:57,010 --> 01:09:11,810
I'm going again. All right this is it. This is it. Is it possible? Is it possible? I thought

407
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:15,140
we were going to do it in one life. That would have been ridiculous. That would have just been

408
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:22,989
like a joke. Such a total nonsense. Careful for spies. There's a spy back here somewhere.

409
01:09:22,989 --> 01:09:34,180
Look at all those stickies. That's all right. I am octo- Oh that's it. That's it. I'm dead.

410
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:41,890
I said it was going to be one life. Turn it into two and third time's a charm baby. Let's do it

411
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:53,140
one more time. After this I'm going to play one round of bloons. This is it. This is the real-

412
01:09:53,140 --> 01:10:03,039
This is it. This is really it. If I die right here I am rage quitting. Careful. I'm not supposed to

413
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:15,340
keep my back turned. There's definitely somebody's hiding in this room. This is chaos. This is

414
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:20,880
absolute total chaos. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Jump down. All the medics

415
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:27,380
jump down. Watch out for the spy medic. This is spy medic. Oh my god he's killing everyone.

416
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:33,729
Oh my god. He's killing. Oh my god they were all spies. Oh my god how many people.

417
01:10:38,659 --> 01:10:44,850
How many of those medics were actually spies is the real question. All right that's uh that's

418
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:55,779
going to be it. Oh I didn't get it in three. Oh meow yourself. All right guys. Oh my goodness. My

419
01:10:55,779 --> 01:11:01,460
throat hurts from just like cackling for the last 10 minutes. This time because I'm going to give

420
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:08,380
this a little bit of time. I want to really get a tactic down because usually I end the stream

421
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:14,819
with this and I'm probably going to end the stream with this as well but I want to get a tactic down.

422
01:11:14,819 --> 01:11:28,239
A real tactic. So let's see. So the the actual tactic is you're supposed to do it's- somebody

423
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:35,149
gave me a tactic before and they said you have to do- you have to raise your right leg and then

424
01:11:35,149 --> 01:11:41,810
raise your left leg but you don't raise the calf. Like that. Like that. Like that. Oh my god come on.

425
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:48,689
This is the first time I've ever stepped more than two steps in this game. So the goal tonight guys

426
01:11:48,689 --> 01:12:01,600
is- what was that? The goal tonight is 50 meters. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna get to 50. You don't

427
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:10,899
believe me? Just watch. 50 meters right now. Once I get to 50 I can end the stream. 50 meters. Come

428
01:12:10,899 --> 01:12:17,699
on. Come on. Slug your way over there you bastard. 50 meters. We're doing it. I'm doing it. I don't

429
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:24,239
care if it takes me till eight in the morning. I'm doing 50 meters or at least 40. We'll say 40.

430
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:36,609
At least 40 meters or I have- oh my god. I'm okay. We're good. We're good. Gotta get to at least 40.

431
01:12:36,609 --> 01:12:42,590
Here we go baby. Come on. We're doing the niche. We're doing the niche stride. We're doing the knee

432
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:50,079
slug. Imagine how bad that would hurt. Can you imagine how awful that would hurt? I seem to be

433
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:58,689
stuck here. I'm stuck. Oh my god. There we go. What you- there we go. There we go. Come on. Keep- stay

434
01:12:58,689 --> 01:13:07,199
with it. Stay with it now. Gotta get to 30 or 40. Oh my god. This is the best I've ever done. All right.

435
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:17,090
All right. Slow down. Slow down a little. Slow down a little. We're gonna hit 30. Oh my god. Oh my god.

436
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:24,939
Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug. Oh dude.

437
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:36,859
Oh when I say 40, when I said 30 or 40. Let's try and get it again. Oh god damn it. I'm so mad right

438
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:51,550
now. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I am so, so mad right now. Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug.

439
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:58,220
I'm gonna get to 40 with the slug. Just you see. So now that we got a little slug going here,

440
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:07,170
let's talk about a story. So one time there was a slug named Jerma and the slug was- I can't even

441
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:22,180
talk because I'm like balancing on one foot. All right. Transition here. No. All right. 30 plus 10

442
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:31,359
is 40. I did it. I just gotta get down. I gotta get down on like the ground. I gotta have this like-

443
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:38,619
I gotta get- I had it down the first time and you know what? I screwed it all up. 30 plus 10 is 40.

444
01:14:38,619 --> 01:14:54,510
I did it. There we go. There we go. Nice workout I'm doing here, huh? Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug.

445
01:14:54,510 --> 01:15:02,720
Slug. Slug. All right. We're at 10. I've made it to a combined- a combined 50 meters. Can I make it

446
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:13,899
to 40 doing this? I don't think it's gonna happen. I really don't think it's gonna happen. Oh don't

447
01:15:13,899 --> 01:15:22,109
lose it. All right. 30 plus 10 plus 13 is more than 50. I did it. I made it.

448
01:15:22,109 --> 01:15:38,289
Do-do-do-do-do. Do-do-do-do-do. Apparently I can walk up sideways. There we go. Just gotta keep this

449
01:15:38,289 --> 01:15:45,569
rhythm. I'm gonna keep the rhythm. Boom. Do-do-do-do. Slug. Slug. We're gonna slug. Slug. Everybody's

450
01:15:45,569 --> 01:15:52,689
gotta slug. We're gonna slug. Slug. Every day. You gotta slug till it's told till the end of May.

451
01:15:52,689 --> 01:16:08,239
You gotta slug. Slug. The music helps. The music helps. The music helps.

452
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:19,520
Why did I stop singing? The music helped. Let's do it again. This is the last time. Here we go.

453
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:43,439
Do-do-do-do-do. Slug. We gotta slug here. I've never seen such a slug in my entire life.

454
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:50,239
When you slug, you gotta slug. When you go, you go. You gotta get on the track and be

455
01:16:50,239 --> 01:17:03,760
super slow. You got it. The music. The music. Never, never don't slug. Never stop slugging

456
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:20,930
till you get to the end of town. Oh, I think that was a combined over 100 meters. Well, there we go.

457
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:33,409
Well, that's gonna be it. I've drained all my energy with this co-op. At least I got 30 meters.

458
01:17:33,409 --> 01:17:38,340
I said 30 or 40 in one try. Actually, I said 40 or 50, but I'm gonna change my words.

459
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:44,479
I'm gonna be like a politician and say, well, I actually said 30 or 40. But yeah, that was fun.

460
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:50,239
That was fun. So everybody, thank you so much for coming. This is the end of the stream.

461
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:58,779
I need to go drink some tea. My throat is a little dry and itchy. But anyways, guys,

462
01:17:58,779 --> 01:18:04,859
thank you so, so much for coming. All you guys that stuck around means a lot. You guys rock.

463
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:10,380
Stay tuned. I'm gonna hope this will all be uploaded to YouTube. At least this part.

464
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:14,619
I'll make sure to get the TF2 and at least the co-op part uploaded to YouTube.

465
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:24,189
Be on the lookout for that. Probably tomorrow. Tomorrow in the afternoon, I would assume.

466
01:18:24,189 --> 01:18:29,069
But the chat, I cannot. The chat just died for me right at the end here. So I'm sorry if I can't

467
01:18:29,069 --> 01:18:33,380
see anything that you guys are saying. But thank you so much, guys. And I'll catch you guys all

468
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:37,069
later. Take care, everybody.
