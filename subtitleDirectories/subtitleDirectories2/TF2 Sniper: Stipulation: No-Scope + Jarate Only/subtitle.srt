00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,800
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,390
and tonight, gonna be playing as the Sniper in a stipulation match. Now, before I get

3
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,530
into this, I want to talk about, uh, it's summertime right now, and the pollen in the

4
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:31,210
air is making my voice and throat and nose all scratchy and screwy louie, so I do apologize

5
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,609
if in this video it sounds a little raspy, but hopefully this damn pollen goes away so

6
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:43,969
I can breathe again. Anyways, this is a stipulation match. The series where I take a certain class

7
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,549
and a certain loadout, and I have to follow a very very strict set of rules and guidelines

8
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:54,869
during the entire video. Now this video, playing as the Sniper, I have to use the Sniper Rifle

9
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:59,880
and the Jurati only. Now here's the big kicker, that doesn't sound so bad, now does it? The

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,379
big stipulation here is I can only no scope with this Sniper Rifle. Now this was requested

11
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,060
a very very long time ago, back when I first started the stipulation series to begin with,

12
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,219
and I've never been able to get a gameplay. It has taken me so long to get this, it is

13
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,340
very very difficult, and I suggest you try it out. If you've never tried something like

14
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,180
this before, jump into a server and just try to do this, throw the Jurati on somebody and

15
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,340
no scope, it is freaking hard. Specifically, because when you throw the Jurati on somebody

16
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,019
and you no scope them, well you know, let's start from the beginning here. When you no

17
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:38,140
scope somebody in general, it's only going to do about 50 damage. So when you throw the

18
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:45,040
Jurati on somebody, you increase that number to about 65 to 72, which really isn't that

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,840
big of an increase. If you look at the damage spread and the random number generation in

20
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,680
this game, it only ends up being about 20 extra damage. So it turns out, you're better

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,200
off not using the Jurati to begin with, if you're going to do this stipulation of course.

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,769
Because let's think of it like this. When you throw the Jurati, it takes about 3 seconds

23
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:08,289
for you to throw the Jurati, get your weapon back up ready to shoot. So after that, when

24
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:13,930
you shoot somebody, let's say you connect with someone, it does 68 damage. That's fantastic.

25
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,210
But in the time it takes to pull out the rifle after throwing out the Jurati, you could have

26
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:24,259
potentially already no scoped 2 or 3 times and done more damage than that one Jurati shot.

27
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:28,400
So with that out of the way, which that kind of goes over the whole process of how this

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,039
setup works, I told you it's very, very difficult. This is so hard to do this. I only got maybe

29
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:39,560
2 or 3 kills in a row before I would get killed by somebody. It's just super, super hard.

30
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,780
And I came to the conclusion, while I was doing this, I'm pretty much a gimped scout.

31
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,330
And here's my explanation for that. So I'm using a hip firing hitscan weapon. The only

32
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,550
other classes that have hitscan weapons are the Soldier, the Scout, and the Engineer.

33
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,750
Now I'm not going to really count the pistol that much, or really any of the melee items,

34
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,840
because those are technically hitscan as well. I'm just talking primary or secondary.

35
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,680
So I have a scatter gun as the sniper, except it shoots a whole lot slower, it does a hell

36
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,449
of a lot less damage, and it only shoots one pellet. And I run slower. I don't run as fast

37
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:22,050
as a scout either. So when you play this setup as the sniper, essentially you're just taking

38
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,810
the scout, clubbing him in the head with a bowling pin, and then letting him out of spawn

39
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,740
and saying, okay, go kill the red team. And he's like, what time is it? And it really

40
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,780
is no surprise that when you go up against any other class, really any other class, it

41
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,889
is very hard to kill them. And they are going to get you probably 80% of the time. But that

42
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,610
does not mean this is not fun, and should not be tried at least a couple of times. And

43
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,930
it took me, like I said, a while before I got this down, before I got the actual strategy

44
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,650
down. But it is really cool when you kill one or two people like that. It's very interesting,

45
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,060
makes you feel good. So here are just a couple of examples of how I got these kills that

46
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,699
you're seeing. So this soldier hits me with a rocket. I know for a fact he's coming in

47
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:09,639
the room. And sure enough, there he is right in his face. If I had thrown the Girardi at

48
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,610
him when he came into the room, I probably would have died. He turns that corner and

49
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,610
shoots one rocket at me. I will explode all over the walls, all over all the nice paintings

50
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:24,250
in that room. There are no paintings in that room, but you get the idea. I would have instantly

51
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,180
died. So killing that scout right there is a pretty good example of knowing when somebody

52
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,500
is trying to get health. Because as you saw, he was jumping all over the place trying to

53
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,399
get over me. And I was certain if I put one bullet into him, I would have killed him.

54
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,220
And those two examples, no Girardi was thrown at all. And that of course goes back to my

55
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,500
previous point of me not using the Girardi and how it's a little easier to not throw

56
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,959
the Girardi. So while this commentary comes to a close, I just want to say thank you of

57
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,040
course for watching. I really do appreciate it. And I will see you guys all next time.

58
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,639
More stipulations are in the works. I think Pyro is going to be the next one. We will

59
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,329
see. So peace guys. I'll see you all soon. And take care, everybody.
