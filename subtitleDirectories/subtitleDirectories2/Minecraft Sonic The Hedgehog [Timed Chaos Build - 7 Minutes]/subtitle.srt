1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,890
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here, and MLC Stealth.

2
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,429
And today, Untimed Chaos Build. You can't start yet.

3
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:19,429
I wasn't, I was hiding.

4
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:24,429
Today we're going to be doing another Timed Chaos Build. We're going to be building Sonic the Hedgehog.

5
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:29,300
Because we haven't done really any gaming related things.

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:36,539
I mean, the only thing we came close to was the Super Mario Cheetos freaking like Pringles Man that we did with the first episode.

7
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,710
So, we're going to end up doing an actual gaming, iconic gaming character, Sonic the Hedgehog.

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,189
And we've got seven minutes to do it. So are you ready Stealth?

9
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:47,369
I am absolutely not ready because it's going to be bad.

10
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:54,259
So let's see how this goes. We've got seven minutes in three, two, one, go.

11
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,259
So we're starting his feet?

12
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:57,259
Yeah, I'll do the front leg.

13
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:01,259
Let's try to not make him like as tall as Andre the Giant.

14
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:03,259
That's probably a good idea.

15
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:08,260
We always make their legs like ten, like a hundred feet apart from each other.

16
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,260
And then it's like, oh man, this guy's going to be huge.

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,260
Alright, so wait, is Sonic the Hedgehog's whole shoe is blue? I mean, blue, red?

18
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,819
German, this color is red.

19
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:18,819
Okay, yeah, that's fine.

20
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,819
Here, make his feet a little bit longer, like that long.

21
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:23,579
Okay. Well, he's like running.

22
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:29,879
Yeah, this, yeah, no. Well, he has, wait, no, it's too, that's too long.

23
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:33,180
No, it's not. It's fine. He's good.

24
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,180
Why are his feet going that way?

25
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,359
Because he's going to be like running.

26
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,359
What?

27
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,359
No, just go. We don't have time.

28
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,359
What?

29
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,359
We don't have time.

30
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,359
Which way is he facing?

31
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,359
I don't know. He's facing that way.

32
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,540
What? Okay. He's facing the other way.

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,719
I don't know what you did with this sideways foot over here.

34
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,599
He's plieing right now. That's like what he's doing.

35
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,599
Great.

36
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:06,599
No, because this is going to, this leg's going to...

37
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,599
This is ballet Sonic the Hedgehog, apparently.

38
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,599
Look at him, he's plieing.

39
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,460
All right, this has to be a little bit shorter, like this.

40
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,469
All right.

41
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:18,469
Dang it.

42
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,469
One, almost one and a half minutes have gone by.

43
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:21,469
Oh, boy.

44
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:22,469
All right.

45
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:23,469
We made two feet.

46
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,650
That's fine. That's fine.

47
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,650
Have him come up.

48
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,650
We never give him any legs.

49
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,650
He could go straight from like knee to freaking body.

50
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,650
I got to do the spikes.

51
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,650
I'm going to do the spikes.

52
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,650
We don't have time.

53
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,650
I can't even finish this.

54
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,650
I don't even know what this is.

55
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,650
Is he on his knees?

56
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,650
Why is this leg like two inches long?

57
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,650
Look at his left leg.

58
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,650
I have no, I have no idea how to do the spikes on his back.

59
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,650
I don't know.

60
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,650
I have no idea how to do this.

61
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,650
Look at how long his legs are.

62
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,819
Screw it, straight to the head.

63
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:12,379
The head is like the most iconic part of him, so I'm going to make sure at least that's there.

64
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:14,379
I'm like losing breath, man.

65
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,379
All right, here comes the spikes.

66
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:21,139
Doesn't he have white in the spikes, too?

67
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:23,949
Sure.

68
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:25,949
All right, it's head time.

69
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:26,949
Yeah, you do the head.

70
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:30,599
What color is his mouth?

71
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,599
He's got a giant hand.

72
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,599
It's a giant hand on legs.

73
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,159
This is not Sonic the Hedgehog.

74
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,159
We almost three minutes have gone by trying to make it remotely Sonic the Hedgehog.

75
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,159
How long do we have?

76
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,159
We have like four minutes.

77
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,159
All right, he has white on his stomach, doesn't he?

78
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,169
Kind of like a penguin?

79
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:57,729
Oh, crap.

80
00:03:57,729 --> 00:03:59,729
You have the wrong thing.

81
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:01,729
Hold on, I'm getting wool.

82
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:04,479
All right, I'm getting the spikes to come out of his head.

83
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,919
All right, it's starting to look like space bug Sonic the Hedgehog.

84
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:18,670
Wait, his mouth is somewhat like that.

85
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,879
All right, arms.

86
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:32,310
If you had to take a guess at what this was, you would never be able to guess this.

87
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,310
He's supposed to be running.

88
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,310
I still have no idea what the heck you did with his right leg.

89
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,310
I thought we were going the other way.

90
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:46,189
He kind of looks like the Mass Effect alien race.

91
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:50,250
What's that Mass Effect like alien girl?

92
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,250
What is her name?

93
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,490
She's the one with like the space suit, I think.

94
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,490
No, I'm not. I'll never be able to guess that.

95
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,480
All right.

96
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,910
Oh, cool. Good thing we got Scorpion Sonic the Hedgehog.

97
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,980
The actual bug Scorpion.

98
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,980
Four minutes have gone by.

99
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,540
That's his hand.

100
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,550
He's broken.

101
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,550
He is completely broken.

102
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,550
He's broken in so many different pieces.

103
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,050
I don't even know how to fix this.

104
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,050
I don't know. I don't know how to fix this.

105
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,050
This is so broken.

106
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,050
This is so screwed up.

107
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,050
Look at how many directions his body is going in.

108
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,050
You know what he looks like?

109
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,050
He looks like you took his head.

110
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,050
You twisted it.

111
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,050
You took his body.

112
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,050
You twisted it.

113
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,050
And you took his legs and you twisted it in completely different directions.

114
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,050
And that's how you left him.

115
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,050
Like imagine he's on it like all like he has head and his stomach and his legs are in a 360 degree plane.

116
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,050
And you spun him in random directions.

117
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,459
All right, we got we need more spikes.

118
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,459
I don't he doesn't have this many spikes.

119
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:55,459
Well, it's all right.

120
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:58,019
He looks like a character.

121
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,019
Okay, let's give him eyes.

122
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:02,019
First off, give him the eyes.

123
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,019
It'll look like normal with the eyes.

124
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,009
And then he has to have like the hair come up like this.

125
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:15,569
Normal with the eyes.

126
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:18,569
Five minutes and 25 seconds.

127
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:22,569
This is if I was this Sonic the Hedgehog.

128
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:28,569
This this guy is in like I know we've said this before, but I would be in pain.

129
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,569
I would be in so much pain as this character.

130
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:39,250
There is no words to describe what we have created here, but it absolutely is not Sonic the Hedgehog.

131
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,250
No, no, it's not.

132
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,379
Sounds like it's going great.

133
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,740
He's ET.

134
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,870
We have a we still have a full minute and I don't even know where to go.

135
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,870
There's no fixing this.

136
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,870
Oh, check it out.

137
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,870
It's ET with giant.

138
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,870
I don't know.

139
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,050
All right.

140
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,050
Come over here.

141
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,050
Let's at least fix this.

142
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,050
You said he doesn't have these spikes coming out all over the place.

143
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,290
You know what he is?

144
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,290
He's a maze.

145
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,290
He's a standing up maze.

146
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:19,529
I always make the hands the same way.

147
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:22,529
They look like four fingers and they look like pitchforks every single time.

148
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:24,529
It's going to be more like glove based.

149
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,459
Oh, that did it.

150
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:30,459
That fixed it.

151
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:31,459
Germica job.

152
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:32,459
It's made it ten times worse.

153
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,699
Like Sonic.

154
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:34,699
There you go.

155
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,379
All right.

156
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:39,199
Let's just make them have like a giant tongue coming out.

157
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:41,379
Yeah.

158
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,379
All right.

159
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:47,379
Well, we have plush toys that you get like mad at and you like squeeze it and everything just pops out.

160
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,379
He really looks like a squeeze.

161
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:49,379
Looks like one of the squeeze toys.

162
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:50,740
All right.

163
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,740
Well, we have three seconds.

164
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
Three, two, one.

165
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,740
And what's up?

166
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,740
Let's set the time.

167
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,740
Wrong thing.

168
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,740
We like even tried.

169
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Oh, man.

170
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,860
There he is.

171
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
There is Sonic the Hedgehog.

172
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:11,579
All right.

173
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:14,579
So if you want to give it a different name, by all means, go ahead.

174
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,199
Let us know how we did.

175
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,199
That has to Sonic is that they're both blue.

176
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,439
That is literally it.

177
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,439
That's the only that's the only similarity.

178
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,449
All right, guys.

179
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,449
Cool.

180
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,449
Thank you so much for watching.

181
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:29,449
I really do appreciate it.

182
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:30,939
My goodness.

183
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:31,939
My goodness.

184
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:32,940
How did this happen?

185
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,909
How did this happen?

186
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,389
Seriously, just like two inches long legs.

187
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,570
It went from his feet to his body.

188
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,570
Oh, well, see you guys all next time.

189
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,570
And of course, take care, everybody.

190
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,899
Thanks for watching.

191
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:53,899
Oh, my God.

192
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:54,899
This is hard.

193
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:55,899
This is insane.
