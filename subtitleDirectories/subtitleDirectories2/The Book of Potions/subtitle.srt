1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,100
Oh, you didn't you didn't think we were gonna play every single wonder book game? Let's make a potion.

2
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:27,379
We have the ideal guinea pig there. That is a poor soul. The cure for boils.

3
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,019
Alright, so I'm gonna make this potion that he's gonna drink it.

4
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,020
If you can make it correctly.

5
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:36,939
Pungent onions.

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Crushed snake fangs.

7
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,700
Pungent onions. Dry nettles, a dash of flubber worm.

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,140
Nucous and sprinkle of ginger. This is a lot of ingredients.

9
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:55,100
Dude, why don't you just go to CVS and get fucking boil cream. Why do I have to do all this?

10
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,539
They make like Neosporin.

11
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,340
We have the ideal guinea pig there. That is a poor soul.

12
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,340
Oh shit, no, no, no. Go this way.

13
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,340
We have the ideal guinea pig there. That is a poor soul. That is a poor soul.

14
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,340
Get out of here, Dobby.

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,340
Get out of here, Dobby.

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,340
You're tracking mud all over my wonder book. Get out of here, dude.

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,340
Turn to page three.

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,030
Dobby, get off the book.

19
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,400
Dobby, get out of here.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,769
What, page three?

21
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,769
Keep an eye on those pictures. They'll always tell you what we're doing next.

22
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:31,030
Ah, a hopping cauldron.

23
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,030
A faithful friend.

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,030
Dobby, get out of the potion.

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,030
At least until you try mixing flux weed.

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,400
I don't think he's supposed to be here.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Right at it, then hold the move button to start lifting it up.

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,129
Okay.

29
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:48,129
Am I making a potion?

30
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:53,129
Or am I Looney Tunes-style cooking Dobby in a pot?

31
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:56,129
This is fucked up.

32
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:05,129
This is evil.

33
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:09,129
Get him out. Get him out.

34
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,129
Dobby, get out. Get out of the...get out, please.

35
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:17,129
Ooh. Ooh.

36
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,129
Say the same line again, please.

37
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,870
Oh, that's fine.

38
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,870
Scatter those lovingly gathered ingredients everywhere, not to worry.

39
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,870
What a mess. Try to get some of it in the cauldron.

40
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,870
Oh, that's fine.

41
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,870
Scatter those lovingly gathered ingredients everywhere, not to worry.

42
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,870
What is in this?

43
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,870
Try to get some of it in the cauldron.

44
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,870
This thing is still going.

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,870
You need to be really careful when you're using your chopping tools.

46
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,919
Because there's a chance that you might cut yourself.

47
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,219
Ooh!

48
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:15,219
Hey, buddy. Who's holding the knife?

49
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:17,219
Okay, I did it right.

50
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,180
Yes!

51
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,180
...to clip off some of the nettle.

52
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:39,330
Hold the clipper's clue.

53
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:45,280
For a cure for boils.

54
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,229
We still need that ingredient. Pick it up again.

55
00:03:52,229 --> 00:04:02,789
It'll cure him.

56
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:08,960
If you don't get him in there, just dunk him a little bit.

57
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Come on, Dobby, get in there.

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:18,699
Dobby, we're curing your fucking warts.

59
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,699
Stop there. That's two figs worth of juice.

60
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,069
Put my hand down.

61
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,810
There.

62
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,810
Oh, dude, he's sucking my blood.

63
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,810
Quite ingenious.

64
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,810
Oh, how much is he gonna drink?

65
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,810
After that close encounter, time to learn more.

66
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,810
Okay.

67
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,810
I just let these things drink a bunch of my blood.

68
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,980
Now I'm gonna kill him, mash him up, and put my blood in this potion.

69
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,980
You wanna get arrested?

70
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,980
That's how you get arrested.

71
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,980
That's how you get the health inspector to be like,

72
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,420
You're putting blood in your fucking food? Your blood?

73
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,009
My restaurant's gonna be closed.

74
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,750
Give them another bash.

75
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,750
My blood wasn't green?

76
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,230
Go to it!

77
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,230
Why is this implying that I had green blood?

78
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,980
I don't have green blood?

79
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,350
My blood's red.

80
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,350
Now we've got a cauldron full of ingredients.

81
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,350
All you need is a wave of the wand.

82
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,350
To make it into a fish potion.

83
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:28,199
That's it.

84
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:38,220
Your wand, pick up the fish and fling it towards him.

85
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,069
That's it.

86
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:55,519
Stupid, that's covered in shrinking solution.

87
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,519
He's just a little baby.

88
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:09,949
Well, he certainly won't stop us passing by now.

89
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:17,420
Can this chop?

90
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,420
You're too hard.

91
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,420
But here it is again, flighty thing.

92
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,480
Just keep quiet still now.

93
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,879
You know what the most fucked up thing is this entire time?

94
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,879
I haven't even had a chance to sample my own material.

95
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,879
I haven't even had a chance to drink my own fucking potions?

96
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:43,930
That's changing right now.

97
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,480
Whoa, that's spicy.

98
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Whoo!

99
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,480
At first, I really didn't think I was going to like that.

100
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,730
But man, that was pretty tasty.
