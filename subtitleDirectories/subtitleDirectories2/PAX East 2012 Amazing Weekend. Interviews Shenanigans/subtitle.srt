00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,060
Hey everybody, it's Jerma here with a Pax East compilation video.

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,059
First of all, Pax East was amazing, and a special shout out to everybody I met there.

3
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:24,059
All the people I hung out with, all the cool dudes that really came out to say hello.

4
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,059
It was amazing, a lot of fun, a lot of friends.

5
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:31,059
And I just want to say that a lot of this footage is a little bit on the low quality side.

6
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:34,060
I wasn't going there as really press, but I wanted to get a couple iPhone interviews.

7
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,060
I wanted to do some Sony Handicam stuff, so keep that in mind.

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,060
The audio isn't really the best you'll ever hear in your life.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,299
And I have about maybe enough footage for one more video.

10
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:45,299
I'm not really sure about that, but we shall see.

11
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,299
But enjoy this video, guys, and I'll see you all soon.

12
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,299
So take care, everybody.

13
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,859
We're on our way to the PC free play right now.

14
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:58,859
PC free play is where it's at.

15
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,859
Am I right? PC free play is where it's at, right?

16
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:07,859
Come on, we've got to get a chant going.

17
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,170
Get to the group, it's way back there.

18
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,469
Hey, you know, we're going to go play PC free play right now.

19
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:17,469
What do you think you're doing?

20
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:18,469
Sorry.

21
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:21,469
This is PC free play. You know what we're going to play at PC free play?

22
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:23,469
I'll tell you what we're going to play.

23
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:25,469
We're going to play Team Fortress 2.

24
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:32,469
Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2.

25
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:35,469
Oh, everyone fucking hates me.

26
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:38,469
How do we even get downstairs?

27
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,469
Right there, that's where we're going, boys and girls.

28
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,469
We're going to the PC free play room.

29
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:49,469
Wait, hold on a second. Hold on.

30
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:51,469
Hey, is that...

31
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:55,469
This down here is, I think that's like the tabletop stuff.

32
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,469
It's fun. It's a fun time.

33
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,469
It's going this way, going this way.

34
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,460
Oh, it's PCs. I wonder how much energy this is using.

35
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,460
Like, how much electricity is powering all these computers? Oh my god.

36
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,599
We're over here with Dan from StealthMachines.com.

37
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,849
This is a crazy PC building company.

38
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,849
Basically, our company started with $200.

39
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:34,930
It was eight years ago, and all we did was use the word machines.

40
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,810
We started to market. We're getting our name out there.

41
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,810
Besides, it's just for your gamers.

42
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,069
We have a 10-year warranty and almost a perfect record.

43
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:47,270
10-year warranty.

44
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,270
PC builders, they have like a three-year warranty,

45
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,110
but you have to pay for a 10-year warranty.

46
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,110
That's insane.

47
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,740
This is the first time I just walked over here and had this stuff,

48
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:07,669
and it was like, oh shit.

49
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,669
No matter where you are, they'll get you.

50
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:15,520
You can hand deliver it.

51
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,550
Take a look at this beast.

52
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,979
This is the fastest AMD graphics card on the planet right now.

53
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:26,979
It's the AMD Radeon 7970.

54
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,979
Over three gigs of RAM.

55
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,979
Oh my god, there it is.

56
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,979
Look at that alien spaceship.

57
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:57,539
Guys, I'm here with D, who is the creative head,

58
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:01,539
and the guy responsible, I guess you could say, for Dust and Elysium table.

59
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,539
It's an Xbox Live arcade release.

60
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:06,539
Coming out, no release date yet, but he's still working on it.

61
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,539
He's done everything for this game.

62
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,539
So I want you to introduce yourself in the audience

63
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:12,539
and tell them what you're doing here.

64
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:13,539
It's amazing.

65
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:16,540
All right, so I come at this as an artist.

66
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,540
You know, my background is in animation.

67
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,540
And I wanted to work on a program.

68
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,540
So I decided, you know, I'll pick up XNA and C Sharp.

69
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,540
And before I knew it, I started making a game.

70
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,540
And Microsoft showed interest in it.

71
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,540
And now here I am, almost four years later, showing up.

72
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,540
In fact, it's great.

73
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,540
Four years of work.

74
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,540
So let me get this.

75
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,350
You are doing all the artwork, programming.

76
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,720
What have you not done on the XNA?

77
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm not handling the audio.

78
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,720
I've got people coming and using.

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
But I'm doing all the design.

80
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm doing all this work.

81
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
It's crazy.

82
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
But it's a dream come true.

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Anything you can give us about when it potentially might be coming out?

84
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Well, the game will definitely be finished this year.

85
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,720
You know, it's up to the publisher as well when to release it.

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
But it'll be done this year.

87
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
And it's close.

88
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
It's close.

89
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Unbelievable work you're doing here.

90
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
I can't wait to see what you've got in store.

91
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Thanks a lot.

92
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Thank you, guys.

93
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Well, we found it.

94
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,720
The Team Fortress 2 store.

95
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Look at all that stuff.

96
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,019
I'm about to instantly transform my outfit into one of these.

97
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,019
Absolutely.

98
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:57,370
Axis, bitch!

99
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,370
Burger Boy.

100
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,370
Axis.

101
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,370
Yeah!

102
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,250
So Burger Boy, I was talking to you the other day.

103
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,250
That was a spy.

104
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,250
That was a spy.

105
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,250
Spy!
