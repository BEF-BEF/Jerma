You're on a stick. Yeah, it was a very large branch and it went. Why are we doing this? Why is nobody coming over here? Because they have a teleporter. They do? Oh, well, let's get rid of that. Let's go take care of that. What the hell is this? It's just a hat.

6
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:49,860
All right, now we hide, hide, hide, hide, hide. I help help you. We're not supposed to be here. We're supposed to be here. Are we really supposed to be here? We're supposed to be here. Is this really what we're doing? Are we this much of like douchebags?

Douchebags?

8
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:06,289
No, we're not doing this. I don't want to do this. This is horrible. I'm glad I died.

9
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:21,860
Worst Simpsons joke ever. Worst joke ever. Who's that? You get 20 German bucks if you can say who that is. Worst episode ever.

10
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:36,919
Al Gore. Got it. Al Gore, ladies and gentlemen. Star wins the 20 German bucks. What are you going to buy? There was no contest. Nobody else is even in this call. Okay, time to turn it on. I'm going out left. I'm turning it out left. You're going to bring the thunder?

11
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:52,789

You should have told me the right coordinates. See? And instead I ended up going to Bingo Bingo and I ended up getting myself killed.

14
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:33,699
Oh, headshot. Watch out for this guy. Watch out for this typer. What do we got anymore? We got any more? We got any more peeps? We got any more creeps? We got any more sweeps and creeps and beeps?

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:39,699
Eat a whole box of creeps in one sitting? Peeps? Dude, one time I ate a host. Just tell me your poop scenario.

16
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:54,069
Did I ever tell you the story I ate the whole sleeve of Oreo cookies and I threw up in my mother's bed? No, that sounds like a good story. Like, why wouldn't you tell this? It was actually pretty recently.

17
00:04:54,069 --> 00:05:14,430
Dude, I threw up. This is like, what the fuck was that? Wait, wait, you mean recently. You recently threw up in your mother's bed. And you couldn't prevent this from happening. You couldn't like lean to the side. This isn't like a mother's floor carpet throw up story.

18
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:29,800
You demolished her bed. Did you have to get a new mattress? Because that shit goes right through. I don't think so. So every night she goes to bed, you just think about what's going on here. Maybe it's kind of fucked up.

19
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:51,629
Alright, where coordinates Brinkobongo? Can we hear the story? No, I'm too busy. Hold on, I don't need a second, man. I'm trying to play a good game of Dubspole over here. We actually are going to steam room now. Okay. Is that confirmation? This is confirmation.

00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:52,370
No, they just have like six engineers. That's what I mean. They have that many NG's. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We're just we're bomb rushing it right now. I think we have totally bomb rushing. Everyone just rush it. There's only two people on that point. There's still two centuries around the corner. What what a joke.
