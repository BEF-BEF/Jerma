1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,580
So I feel a little bit bad that I haven't been covering as many games as I used to on this channel.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:12,580
I used to go over patch notes, game updates, how I felt about them, and I haven't done it in a very long time.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:18,379
So I wanted to play catch-up with myself, in a sense, and go over all of them.

4
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:23,379
All the patches and updates that I wanted to cover that I didn't get a chance to cover over the last three years.

5
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:25,559
So this one's probably gonna be quite a long one.

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,059
We're gonna go over all these patches and we're gonna start with Team Fortress 2.

7
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,060
Team Fortress 2, the invasion update.

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,560
Get yourself excited. Are you excited? Well, you should be.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,560
We're talking about patches here. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the patch video.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
So Team Fortress-

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,060
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa. You're fast-boarding right now.

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,060
I just wanna make sure your fingers hold. You're doing that intentionally? Is that another mistake?

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,560
I added a drop-down area to Red's last and adjusted lighting in various areas.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,560
What's interesting, though, is they finally fixed the direct deck settings on light poles.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,560
Remember how annoying that was with the light pole?

16
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,359
Okay, listen, I-

17
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,359
I sometimes- you don't have to skip all of Overwatch.

18
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,859
That was a pretty big deal of games coming out soon.

19
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:17,359
Look, this video took me like three months to make, so I don't wanna be like a dick about it.

20
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,359
But if you could just pick something so I could at least feel like it mattered-

21
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,359
There's one for Nazgoth here.

22
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,359
Sonic Boom actually finally got the nerf it deserved. It's now under eight seconds for a cooldown.

23
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:28,859
Yep.

24
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,359
And they fixed a couple of crashes, the desktop launcher, the crash on exit.

25
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,859
Thank God we can now not have to deal with that.

26
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,920
And the game will never turn on ever again after May 31st.

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,420
It's true.

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,920
Moving right along, we got another patch-

29
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,420
No, look. There's no reason for you to go this fast.

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,920
Okay, I'm just gonna be very frank with you. Take your finger off that button right now.

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Right now. If you have any respect-

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,420
The first sin.

33
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,290
Why is Dark Souls 2 even on here?

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,290
I'm just gonna hang out. I'll be over here on my phone.

35
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,790
Got a couple new apps to check out. I downloaded FaceSwap. You know, FaceSwap, you can do it with your dog and it's really funny.

36
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,789
I got a new keyboard app, too. I'm not sure if you've heard of it. It's called Key. It's up in Key.

37
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:13,789
You can make a little tune, it's pretty bold. I got a couple more games for the tune as well.

38
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,030
What the hell is this?

39
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,030
Hold on.

40
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,030
Pause the video for a second. Pause it!

41
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,340
You're in a different video right now.

42
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,080
I haven't even made this video yet. You are at least 20 to 30 uploads in the future.

43
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,250
So you're going to listen to me very closely and very carefully.

44
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,250
You're going to rewind a few months and you're going to stop, okay?

45
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,250
Very simple instruction.

46
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,069
There you go. Right here, right here. Stop, stop, stop.

47
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,069
Doesn't matter where. Stop right here.

48
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,069
In fact, you might-

49
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,069
In fact, you might-

50
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:52,069
Yeah, I'm overlapping here.

51
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:53,069
Yeah, I'm overlapping here.

52
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,069
Pull it forward like two inches or so.

53
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:55,069
On the bar? On the bar?

54
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,759
Almost there.

55
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,930
Almost there. One more.

56
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,490
Got it. Perfect.

57
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
These are my patch notes.

58
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,659
And these just came out today.

59
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:04,659
I haven't even seen these yet.

60
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,969
You picked a perfect place to stop.

61
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,210
So, let's see what they changed.

62
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,719
They're actually shrinking me again.

63
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,719
This is the second time it's happened.

64
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,219
We should all look for Dermot's current height.

65
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,219
He's been causing performance issues.

66
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,219
He couldn't easily fit into a clown car.

67
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:21,219
With this change, clown car videos are now much more accessible.

68
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,099
I don't want to do clown car videos.

69
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:26,099
What are they talking about?

70
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,099
My lumberjack outfit is going to get removed too.

71
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,270
No, that is bullshit.

72
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,270
I'm keeping my lumberjack outfit on.

73
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,139
What else do we got?

74
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,080
This patch is fucking terrible so far.

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
40% more vacation vlogs.

76
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,460
No, I'm not doing vacation videos.

77
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,460
No way.

78
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,080
I would rather do 100 clown car videos than one vacation video.

79
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,520
So, opting out of this one, as you could say.

80
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
It's downloading.

81
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,009
When did I do that?

82
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,009
I didn't press any button.

83
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:57,009
I didn't accept anything.

84
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,009
There was no cancel or anything.

85
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,319
Nothing's working here.

86
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,560
Do I seriously have to rip out my ethernet cable?

87
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,560
I do. I don't want this patch.

88
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,110
Hold on a second.

89
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,110
I had all these installed.

90
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,110
I'm connected to my whole damn house.

91
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,860
I think that's it.

92
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,860
Is it?

93
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,189
God damn it!

94
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:19,189
Ow!

95
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:20,560
Ow!

96
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,930
That's the cable.

97
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,930
I gotta put that back in.

98
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,930
I want to watch Better Call Saul season 2.

99
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,639
I can't...

100
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,579
Hello?

101
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:35,040
Look, you are going to have to call back at a different time.

102
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,220
I'm in the middle of some shit right now.

103
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,220
And I need...

104
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,459
Look, please put me on the do not call list!

105
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:45,750
Fucking asshole!

106
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,250
Ah!

107
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,490
Your service has been temporarily disconnected.

108
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,490
That's not it.

109
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,490
I think I might throw up.

110
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,920
I hope not.

111
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
What is this?

112
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
What is that?

113
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Why do I have a sneeze switch?

114
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Please leave a message.

115
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,920
Please leave a message.

116
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
This is it, right here.

117
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Whoa!

118
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,100
Colors!

119
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,850
Gone.

120
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,850
I can't see anything.

121
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,410
I'm blind.

122
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,910
I must have pulled out the HDMI.

123
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,910
Oh boy!

124
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,910
Oh boy!

125
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,209
Somebody's gonna have to call.

126
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:17,209
Where's my mom?

127
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,209
Where's my phone?

128
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,209
Mom?

129
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:20,209
Fuck!

130
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:21,709
How much time do I have on that?

131
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:22,709
I don't know.

132
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:23,709
I can't tell.

133
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:26,040
I can't see.

134
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,019
I'm deaf.

135
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,769
I don't know if it feels like there's a part of me on this one.

136
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:40,189
This is a weird feeling.

137
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:42,189
I kind of just feel like I don't exist.

138
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:46,220
I can't hear and I can't see.

139
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,779
Is there a way I can...

140
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:54,949
I can't come to it.

141
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:55,949
I'm gone!

142
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:56,949
One...

143
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:57,949
Two...

144
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:58,949
One...

145
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:00,319
Three...
