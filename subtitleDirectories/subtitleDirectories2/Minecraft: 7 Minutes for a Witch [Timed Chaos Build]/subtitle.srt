00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,630
From the spooky sunset, comes two minecrafters ready to do the Halloween special.

2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,980
That wasn't as spooky as I imagined it to be.

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,980
That was not as spooky as I imagined it to be.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,980
That was not spooky at all.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,980
You just kind of like glided across, didn't you?

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,980
We were supposed to, uh, whatever.

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,780
You got the plan?

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,780

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,780
It's gotta be fine, man. It's gotta be fine.

22
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,280
So let's set the time.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,719
You give me the, you give me the, the go sign or the go whatever.

All right. I'll let you know. Don't worry.

25
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,019
Signal.

26
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:16,019
So we're gonna have seven minutes to do this.

27
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,519
Don't ask me why the ground is like weird color.

28
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,519
I don't know what happened.

29
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,519
It wasn't me.

30
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,519
Orb like blew it up.

31
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,700
Don't ask, but it wasn't me.

32
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,700
But anyways, here we go.

33
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,099
In three, two, one, go.

34
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,099
Oh jeez.

35
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:32,099
That was like instant.

36
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,099
You gotta be quick. You gotta be quick.

37
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,099
All right. We need, we need the broom.

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,329
I'll do the old boy.

40
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,329
That didn't come out right.

41
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,890
It didn't come out right.

42
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,129
Just keep it going.

43
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:55,129
I hate to say this, but we've got to make the broom thicker.

44
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:58,129
Yeah. Well, make, make sure the broom like comes up and like,

45
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:04,659
so it's not just like, oh, it's already ruined.

46
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:06,659
I can't even talk.

47
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,659
Because it's good.

48
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:09,659
That's good. That's good.

49
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:10,659
Keep it going. Keep it going.

50
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,659
Okay. Okay. Okay.

51
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:13,830

52
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,830
Hey, I need like, I need what?

53
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,389
Oh wait.

54
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,389
Are you missing colors?

55
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,759
No, no, no, nevermind.

56
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,759
This is going to be her legs.

57
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,939
Oh, this is a really short broom.

58
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:26,240
Well, yeah, that broom is way too short.

59
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
What are you doing?

60
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
No, no, no.

61
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
Okay. Okay. Okay.

62
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,610
I got it. I got a plan. I got a plan.

63
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,610
What am I doing over here?

64
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,060
This has got to come out and then like this.

65
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,389
It started off really weird, but it's got to be better.

66
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:43,389
It's going to be even longer than that.

67
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:45,270
Yeah.

68
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,270
I mean, you got to make it thicker too.

69
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,270
But hey, it's not about the size.

70
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,509
Motion of the ocean.

71
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,009
Here we go.

72
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:55,009
We're making like a Lego spaceship, by the way.

73
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,250
Okay.

74
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,250
This needs to come up like a little bit like this.

75
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,129
This has got to be her legs.

76
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,129
It's got to be like a seat.

77
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,430
See, I'm making like the seat right now.

78
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,430
Wait, what? I'm making legs.

79
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,430
What are you doing?

80
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,430
A seat?

81
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,430
Yeah, that's like, this is like the seat.

82
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,430
She's going to be sitting on it.

83
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,430
Hey, by the way, almost two minutes have gone by.

84
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,430
We don't have a dirty time.

85
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,430
Oh, no, no.

86
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,430
Oh, God.

87
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,740
All right.

88
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,740
Here's her leg.

89
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,740
I'm going to make it.

90
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,740
I'm going to make her shoe.

91
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,740
She doesn't have to be that big.

92
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,740
She doesn't have to be that big.

93
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,650
Okay.

94
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,650
Nice shoes.

95
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,650
Okay.

96
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,650
What?

97
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,650
Oh, God.

98
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,849
I just dropped.

99
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:30,849
Oh, you dropped connection.

100
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:31,849
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

101
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:32,849
I just dropped down.

102
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:33,849
I just dropped down.

103
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:34,849
Okay.

104
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:35,849
So.

105
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:36,849
Oh, a nice like lopsided bird legs she has, by the way.

106
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,539
Keep going.

107
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:39,539
Keep going.

108
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:40,539
From the parrot.

109
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:41,539
Okay.

110
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:44,479
So is this like her body?

111
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,490
Yes.

112
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,490
So build it up.

113
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,490
Oh, two minutes have gone by.

114
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,490
She's really square.

115
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,110
It's okay.

116
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,110
We just got to make.

117
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,110
We got to make a face.

118
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,110
We got to make a face.

119
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,110
We got to get the foundation first.

120
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,110
We got.

121
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,110
We got to make her bigger, though, because otherwise the face.

122
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,110
How do you make a face?

123
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,110
You can't make a face on this.

124
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,110
This looks like a sword going through some guy's balls.

125
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,740
Like, this is ridiculous.

126
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Oh, look.

127
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,740
Great like sword going through this guy's balls.

128
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,300
That's fantastic.

129
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,539
This is the best Halloween special ever.

130
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:15,710
Yeah.

131
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,709
She's got to be a little thicker.

132
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,019
Okay.

133
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,379
Yeah.

134
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,689
We got to make her.

135
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:22,689
I mean, she.

136
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:23,689
Heavy said last.

137
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:24,689
Yeah.

138
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:25,689
You don't know.

139
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:26,689
Three minutes have gone by.

140
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:27,689
Okay.

141
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:28,689
Yeah.

142
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:29,689
See that.

143
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:30,689
But how big is she going to be, though?

144
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:31,860
Because you can't be too.

145
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,040
That's okay.

146
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
This is her face.

147
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Yeah.

148
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,410
Her face is going to come this way.

149
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,160
She's going to have a green face because witches have green faces.

150
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,399
That's eyes.

151
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,399
Wait, that's eyes?

152
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,399
I don't know.

153
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,399
What?

154
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,399
What does she?

155
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,399
What does she like?

156
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,399
Kermit the frog?

157
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,399
Like, no.

158
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,399
We're done.

159
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,399
We're done.

160
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,399
What?

161
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,399
What are you talking about?

162
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,399
We're done.

163
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,399
She's got a big witch nose and stuff.

164
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,399
What is?

165
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,019
Oh, yeah.

166
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:58,019
All right.

167
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,019
Hold on.

168
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,019
This is her head.

169
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,019
This is going to come up like this.

170
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:02,019
Okay.

171
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:03,019
And this is her nose.

172
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,389
All right.

173
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:05,389
There's like a hood.

174
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,389
She needs like a hood.

175
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,389
What are you doing?

176
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:08,389
That's her nose.

177
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:09,389
No, that's not her.

178
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:10,389
Her face is right here.

179
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,389
Oh.

180
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,910
Dude, she doesn't have like, like, like knife boobs.

181
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,910
I once.

182
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,910
That's her nose.

183
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,910
Yeah.

184
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,910
She's got to go to the good like what?

185
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,910
All right.

186
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,910
Now we need eyes.

187
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,910
I was thinking.

188
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,430
I'm going to make her have like a hood.

189
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,430
Hold on.

190
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,430
That's her eyes.

191
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,379
No, but wait.

192
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,379
Her eyes.

193
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:31,379
Because her hood is going to be black.

194
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,259
So no, make her make her hood black and make the face blue.

195
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:37,439
Well, she's going to have a green face.

196
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,579
I think.

197
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:42,019
Oh, she needs like a mouth, too.

198
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:43,019
It's got to be black.

199
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,019
Her clothing.

200
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,019
Yeah.

201
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:46,019
Yeah.

202
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:47,019
You're right.

203
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,509
Right.

204
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:50,139
So whatever.

205
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:51,139
Oh, my God.

206
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:52,139
Hold on.

207
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,139
Why does she have a black nose?

208
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:54,139
It should be green.

209
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,139
She's got a green face.

210
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,139
Obviously.

211
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,139
Obviously.

212
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,139
No, that's too long.

213
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,149
She's got blue eyes.

214
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:01,149
It doesn't look realistic.

215
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:02,149
Come on, dude.

216
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,149
There's her.

217
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:04,149
There's her blue eyes.

218
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:05,149
Are they like bulging out?

219
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:06,149
All right.

220
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:07,149
She's.

221
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:08,149
This is the worst.

222
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:09,149
All right.

223
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,149
Almost five minutes.

224
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:11,149
We're going to give her arms.

225
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:12,459
You're going to be holding on to this.

226
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:13,459
Yeah.

227
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:14,459
Yeah, of course.

228
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:20,819
I'm going to cover her back of her face with a cape or a cape with a cape.

229
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:23,819
No, with her clothing, her hoodie, whatever.

230
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:24,819
Broken.

231
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:25,819
Okay.

232
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,819
Okay.

233
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,819
Seriously.

234
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:28,819
Okay.

235
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:30,459
Okay.

236
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,699
That's that looks fine.

237
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:32,939
We got to fix this.

238
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:36,120
What is this arm?

239
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Is this an arm?

240
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
It's her like pipe arms.

241
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,550
And she's got to hold.

242
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,550
What is it?

243
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,550
Is she holding a wand?

244
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,550
I don't know what.

245
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,550
Yeah.

246
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,920
Let's have her hold a wand.

247
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,480
Is that a common thing for a witch?

248
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,660
We don't.

249
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
We don't have.

250
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
Yeah, sure.

251
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,959
Just do it.

252
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:51,959
Just do the.

253
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:52,959
Oh, shit.

254
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,959
Hold on.

255
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,959
I'm not finished making her spiral staircase.

256
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,959
Like.

257
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,959
Actually, this looks actually pretty cool.

258
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,959
You see that?

259
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,959
That's pretty good.

260
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,959
All right.

261
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,199
Let's go to the top.

262
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,199
Here we go.

263
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,199
Like the top.

264
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,199
No, no, no.

265
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,199
Why?

266
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,199
Why?

267
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,199
Like that.

268
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,199
See?

269
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,199
Oh, yeah.

270
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,199
That's killer.

271
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,199
But that arm is not.

272
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,759
Yeah.

273
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,319
This arm is not gonna.

274
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,689
This is bad.

275
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:18,689
Well, can't the arm just can't the arm like sort of come from here?

276
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,689
Yeah.

277
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,689
I just don't understand like depth perception in Minecraft.

278
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:23,689
Just.

279
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:25,439
Okay.

280
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,439
So is her feet going to be they're not equally long?

281
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,870
No, but that's all right.

282
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,050
It's okay.

283
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,050
Is there anything like a dude like trying to like cover?

284
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,420
Yeah.

285
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,420
But shoot.

286
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,420
I don't know about you, man.

287
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,420
But you can't ride a broom if you don't hold on to it.

288
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,620
She's like standing on it.

289
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,110
Dude, this is the this is the Statue of Liberty.

290
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,420
We made the Statue of Liberty.

291
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,420
This is the Statue of Liberty.

292
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,420
With a wart in her face.

293
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,850
It's got to make the crown.

294
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,019
All right.

295
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,019
We got the we can work on that.

296
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,019
No, she's got to have at least one hand.

297
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,019
This hand's got to be on the broom.

298
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,019
We only have 30 seconds.

299
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,019
No, no, no.

300
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:04,970
We got it.

301
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,970
We got it.

302
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,209
So this has got to come down like this and across.

303
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:10,209
Why is the broom like weird looking back here?

304
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:11,209
I don't know.

305
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:12,209
That's her.

306
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:13,829
That's her.

307
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:14,829
Like, that's her thing.

308
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:15,829
That's her thing.

309
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,829
Oh, man.

310
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,389
This arm.

311
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:19,389
We only got 10 seconds.

312
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:20,389
God.

313
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:21,389
Well, we got to make it pointy.

314
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,209
I don't understand arms.

315
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,639
Okay.

316
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,639
So this could be.

317
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,639
What is this?

318
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,639
What is this thing?

319
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,639
She's grabbing on.

320
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,639
That's it.

321
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,639
It's over.

322
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,639
It's over.

323
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,639
Oh, my God.

324
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,940
Hey, man.

325
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
I think we did pretty good.

326
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,940
This was part of this was part of my plan.

327
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,309
This is part of my master plan.

328
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,309
I like this.

329
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,309
Hey, the wand thing.

330
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,309
The wand thing.

331
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,309
The red thing.

332
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,309
That was that was icing on the cake right there.

333
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,309
Yeah.

334
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,309
The Statue of Liberty wand was perfect.

335
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:45,309
That was so good.

336
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:47,059
I feel like this is better than your bird.

337
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,059
I feel like your bird is very blocky.

338
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:49,690
Hey, the birds got like a big butt.

339
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,690
All right.

340
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,690
Yeah.

341
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,690
Big booty.

342
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,690
Big booty.

343
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,690
No.

344
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,690
All right.

345
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,179
Well, thank you guys so much for watching.

346
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:06,789
Of course, you got to give this thing a name and rating and happy Halloween, everybody.

347
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:12,100
Happy Halloween or scary Halloween.

348
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,399
Thank you for Incredible Orb for his appearance.

349
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,399
Absolutely.

350
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,399
Anytime.

351
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,399
We'll see you guys all next time.

352
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,899
And of course, take care, everybody.
