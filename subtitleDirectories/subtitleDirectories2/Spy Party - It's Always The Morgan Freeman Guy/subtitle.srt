00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:09,099
Welcome back to Spy Party. In this episode, we're going to return to the game that-

2
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:16,399
Just making duck noises, that's fine. That's great. Um, we're going to be playing Spy Party again because it was just recently updated.

3
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:28,420
Oh, that looks fancy.

4
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,219
There's now an option to complete one known mission. We're going to do that.

5
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,359
I only have one-

6
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,060
Only one?

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,859
Yeah, I only have one thing I have to do.

8
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,600
That's going to be too easy.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,140
All I have to do is- oh, here we go. So look at these new models.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,939
And there he is, ladies and gentlemen. The new Monopoly guy.

11
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:52,619
Actually, can I be the old Monopoly guy too? No- what? There's only like four people you can choose from.

12
00:00:53,990 --> 00:01:01,189
I wonder which character Jerma picked. There's a guy with a-

13
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,159
It wasn't the Monopoly guy. It was me. It's just a lady.

14
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:16,239
This is- that's- there's only five people at this party. What a shitty party.

15
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,799
Oh, I had a- I had a party. Do you want to come to my party? Only four people showed up.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,989
This is a pretty huge house for like five people.

17
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,140
That is so funny. It's like, oh, we have like- look at character model.

18
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,140
Animation's like beautiful than like the Muppet in the room.

19
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:53,629
No shit!

20
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,299
I was trying to shoot the Monopoly guy.

21
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,430
Contact double agent is your only mission?

22
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,430
So you're going to win, like easily.

23
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,419
I don't know, I just like thought it was him.

24
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,919
Look at this comparison. Look at these two faces.

25
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,840
So hold on. That one guy that just does not belong, he can't be anything.

26
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,650
Literally, I can't make him the ambassador. I can't make him- I can't pick him.

27
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,650
That's the point. That's what I'm saying. You know he is completely irrelevant and you shoot him?

28
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,650
I didn't know he was like that completely irrelevant. I thought you could at least like pick him or something.

29
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:07,770
So why is he here? Why is this guy here? What is this guy's purpose? Like what purpose does this guy serve?

30
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,050
I love how Morgan Freeman has a cane. Why does Morgan Freeman have a cane?

31
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,050
He's not that old. Is that his wife like standing right next to him? Oh, he's planting the bug on him.

32
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:35,919
Whoa, look out. This is fucking impossible by the way.

33
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:42,300
There's only four people in this room. How the hell are you- you're going to see me do this every time?

34
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,460
I don't know. I'm kind of not paying that much attention right now to be honest with you.

35
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,469
What? You're paying attention to like the guy over here?

36
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,930
That's you, isn't it? You know what gave you away?

37
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,930
What?

38
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,560
You tapped your key like once and your character shifted like, and I was like, dude, they don't do that.

39
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,060
Okay, he was the like new Monopoly guy. Big surprise, Jerma.

40
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:21,240
We're gonna do- we're gonna do something here. Because there's only five people in this room and one of them does not matter at all in the slightest.

41
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:30,100
I'm going- there's like a 20% chance- no, 25% chance that I'm going to kill you instantly.

42
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,699
Damn it, you're fucking Morgan Freeman again!

43
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:42,279
You're not catching on to this. This is like the same thing from the first video.

44
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:47,939
I will keep that in mind, that it's always Morgan Freeman.

45
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,939
Well, no, see, this is where I metagame you.

46
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:54,199
No, you're not going to metagame me. I already know what you're doing.

47
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:01,279
You see, oh, it's always Morgan Freeman, but no, no, no. You see, you're not going to pick Morgan Freeman now.

48
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,279
You're going to be like Cruella De Vil from 101 Dalmatians. Game over, I win.

49
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,050
I told you-

50
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:19,769
Alright, no, no, it's still the old models. It's still the old models when you go back to like the other missions.

51
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:22,269
Well, it's open bay today. Today's a good day to do it.

52
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:25,339
Oh yeah, this has been a great experience.

53
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:33,939
Great experience, Jerma. I'm glad I got to play this game with you again.

54
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:38,430
I just couldn't wait to do this.

55
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,750
You want to go again? Just do a few more of these?

56
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,399
Yes, I want to do- I want to do another one.

57
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,399
I want to go back to this one again.

58
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,959
One mission.

59
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:04,730
I want to do-

60
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,970
Alright, let's go.

61
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,339
You and me. Baby, it's on now.

62
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,160
Do you want to just keep doing this?

63
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,889
I don't understand. Why do you think I would know what you're doing here?

64
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,759
Are we done?

65
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,790
Yeah.

66
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,959
Okay, good.

67
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,959
Wait, the guy who doesn't finish is scratching his head on my screen like, what?

68
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:42,459
Morgan Freeman again.

69
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:44,459
That was so stupid.
