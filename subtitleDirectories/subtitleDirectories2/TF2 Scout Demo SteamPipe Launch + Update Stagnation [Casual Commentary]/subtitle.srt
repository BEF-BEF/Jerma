00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,210
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Druma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:20,210
And tonight, I'm going to be playing as the Scout in the first clip, and then the Demoman in the second one.

3
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:26,210
I actually don't remember the loadout. I think this is the Scattergun, the Mad Milk, and I don't remember the melee.

4
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,210
So, I apologize. What I'm probably going to end up doing from now on is just showing the loadout screen.

5
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:36,210
Just to save myself an extra three or four seconds from saying it.

6
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,210
But anyways, I was playing with Boo and Italics in this gameplay. Agni, OP, that's Boo, just shooting me in the face.

7
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,210
And this is going to be just a kind of casual, laid-back commentary, not going to be too focused on one particular topic.

8
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,210
But there are a couple things that I do want to talk about in this video.

9
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:59,210
And the first being this. The Steam Pipe is coming out today, I believe. What's today? April 30th? April 30th, yes.

10
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:05,209
Today, Steam Pipe is coming out. If you don't know what this is, I'm going to give you guys sort of a heads-up on this.

11
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:11,379
It's Steam's new file management system, apparently, and it's coming to Team Fortress 2 today.

12
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:15,379
And what it's going to do, don't freak out, don't worry, it's just going to make TF2 load faster.

13
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:21,379
It's going to make maps load faster. Everything's just going to be a little bit less buggy when it comes to file management now.

14
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:29,379
But you're going to lose all your custom HUDs, all your custom maps, all the stuff that you load into, like, your custom folder.

15
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:33,750
You're going to have to do it again. Well, the custom maps, I think, are already taken care of.

16
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,750
It's just they're moving a bunch of folders, and they're changing a bunch of directories and stuff like that.

17
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,750
But I'm going to leave a link in the description for you to go check out the FAQ for this whole thing.

18
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,750
Because if you do have a bunch of custom files, you're probably going to want to take a look at this fact.

19
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,750
I mean, I don't have very much custom stuff, so I don't really care. It's like, oh, whatever, Steam Pipe, oh, cool.

20
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,750
But apparently, like I said, it's going to make things load faster, and it's happening today.

21
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,750
So just keep your eye on that of you. Your TF2 starts to do a bunch of weird stuff and you don't know what the hell is going on.

22
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,750
That's what's happening today.

23
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:15,310
Also, on the topic of Team Fortress 2, TF2 updates more specifically, we haven't gotten anything new added to this game in a pretty long time.

24
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:24,310
And I'm starting to get worried. You know that TF2 update down period where you start to get concerned because the game hasn't had anything really update or anything given to it.

25
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:34,310
Besides, of course, the Oculus Rift thing. But I really don't count stuff like that because those are more mechanical implementations than they are of content patches.

26
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:42,310
We haven't gotten a content patch for Team Fortress since the Vaccinator and the Rescue Ranger and the Man vs. Machine stuff came out.

27
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:50,620
Well, the Man vs. Machine new maps. I'm starting to get antsy. In hats, in miscellaneous items, those are cool, but they're purely cosmetic.

28
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:59,620
You know what I'm looking for, guys? I'm looking for Valve to give us a new good payload map or a really good new control point map.

29
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:07,620
We haven't had one of those in such a long damn time. I can't remember the last map that came out that was like a good upward style map.

30
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,620
Come on, we need more of those. I know there's custom ones and those are very good.

31
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:20,620
But I'm talking more either official Valve maps or community maps that were pulled in by Valve and made official.

32
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:30,030
And I'm trying to think right now, but besides Koth King and then Doomsday, what was the last official Valve map or community official map?

33
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:39,580
Do we have to go back to like Barn Blitz to get that map or Nightfall? I'm trying to think. I have no idea what the last real official map was.

34
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,819
But whatever. I mean, I'm looking for a new map. I'm looking for some new items. And we're actually talking about items.

35
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:52,819
We might actually get something fairly soon because I don't know if you guys notice this, those robot crates that are appearing every now and then when you're just playing the game.

36
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:58,819
What the hell are those? Are we going to get some more man vs. machine stuff? I assume that's what those things are, but they might not.

37
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:06,819
We might get another big robot update. I really don't know. But you cannot open those crates at the moment. Those blue robot crates cannot be opened.

38
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:13,819
So let's cross our fingers here and hope that very, very soon here, Valve comes out with some new content because that's what we're always hankering for.

39
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,819
We always want new content for TF2. Let's hope we get it.

40
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:24,629
And while this video wraps up in the next minute or so here, I want to bring this up because I get this a lot of people have been asking me this.

41
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:35,629
Are you still doing your schedule or have you dropped that? Now, if you don't know what I'm talking about, I a couple of months ago, I made a video with a video schedule where every Tuesday and Saturday was going to be TF2.

42
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:40,629
It was going to be Smite every Sunday. It was going to be Little Gems.

43
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,629
I had a whole schedule planned out and I wanted to do it for a month or two.

44
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:52,629
And I did it for about five or six weeks and then it kind of went to hell after my hard drive died and I got hit in the face at PAX East.

45
00:04:52,629 --> 00:05:01,810
That screwed up the whole schedule. So as of right now, I am not going to be following my schedule and I'm probably not going to be following the schedule for a long time.

46
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,810
I'll probably make a new one when once the summertime really drops and a lot of you guys are out of school.

47
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,810
Maybe I'll make the schedule again or I'll try a different schedule.

48
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,810
But as of right now, no, I am no longer following that schedule I made a couple months ago.

49
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,430
But that is going to wrap up the video, guys. So thank you all so much for watching. Really do appreciate it.

50
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,430
Just want to throw this little casual commentary together, give you a heads up about the steam pipe, talk about the update.

51
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:33,430
And that's going to wrap it up. So thank you guys so much for watching again. See you all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
