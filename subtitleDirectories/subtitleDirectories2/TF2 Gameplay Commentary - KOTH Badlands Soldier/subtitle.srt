1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,110
Hey, what is going on guys? It's Jerma with a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,429
This time I'm on King of the Hill Badlands as a Soldier, and I'm using the default rocket

3
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:15,009
launcher, the buff banner, and the riding crop, making this heavy run frigging a thousand

4
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,289
miles per hour, getting them right up to the front lines.

5
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:24,969
Kill a Soldier and I get murked in two seconds by these hippies that were here.

6
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:29,269
The only thing I changed from the Uber update is the riding crop, the disciplinary action

7
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:36,939
is the only item I took from the Uber update, because I can't use the other, hold on, this

8
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:41,740
is really funny. This spy is AFK the entire match, and I use

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,780
him the entire match to run really fast out of the spawn.

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,979
I'm not sure if it was a good idea or not, because I could probably have just ran out,

11
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:52,039
and I don't know if I was wasting my time or not, but I figured that if he was watching

12
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,140
at some point and just see it happen, I thought it would be funny.

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,700
Kill this heavy medic pair with an instant crit rocket, I am a jerk for doing that, I'm

14
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:05,379
sorry, whoever that heavy was. But back to what I was saying before, this is my default

15
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,019
setup usually, if I did not have the riding crop, I would have the equalizer, and I'm

16
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,099
so glad I could change. Speaking of the buff banner, here it is right

17
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:20,810
here, and oh, I killed two engineers with one rocket, but the sentry kills me.

18
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,159
If I had known that sentry was there, I would not have taken that route, obviously, but

19
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,140
I love the buff banner. It gimps you a little bit when you don't have

20
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:38,269
the shotgun, but it's something about giving every single person around you many crits,

21
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,989
and even for you, it's gotten me out of a lot of trouble when I'm stuck in a corner

22
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:47,709
somewhere and I have it, and I use it, and I kill four or five people.

23
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:54,579
So I like to use it, I couldn't use the new rocket launcher, I tried, I know I said in

24
00:01:54,579 --> 00:02:00,409
a previous video in the uber update item demonstration video that I was going to try really hard

25
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:07,609
to use it, I did, I tried using it in about six or seven different servers, and I just

26
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:14,289
couldn't, it was good, I liked it, but that third rocket, sorry, that fourth rocket not

27
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:20,020
being there, they were like at least four or five times, I counted, where I would have

28
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,729
killed somebody with the fourth rocket and it just didn't happen, and I just can't use

29
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,770
it. Hey, what's going on, Spy, how are you? I'm

30
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:33,560
good, thanks. So I don't really play Soldier that often, Soldier's not really like one

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,669
of my classes, quote unquote, but I figured I don't have a Soldier gameplay, and some

32
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:45,030
of you guys probably will ask for it, so here is one of the probably few Soldier gameplays

33
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,150
I do, and I do okay, I do pretty well, I think I'm the number one scorer at the end of the

34
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:56,460
round, but King of the Hill maps are a lot of fun, they can get a little chaotic though,

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,580
as in most King of the Hill maps, the spawn points are really, really, really close to

36
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,659
the point, and you can get into a lot of trouble with spawn camping and stuff like that, like

37
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:12,379
as in right here, I kind of back off, I would have died definitely anyways, but you never

38
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:17,379
know what people are going to consider spawn camping, so you just let people come out,

39
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:25,610
don't spawn camp, don't be a jerk. So I have the buff banner now, and I blow the horny

40
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:32,319
horn, try and get a few of my guys to get crits, I kill this Heavy with another random

41
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,020
crit, I think that's the second time that's happened, again I'm really sorry, but it probably

42
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,719
wouldn't have mattered, I hear an engineer building, I couldn't find it, I find it here,

43
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:46,340
I eventually get killed, I think, no, I come around this corner here and I do a super swing

44
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,069
shoot, and I kill that sniper, I thought that was pretty cool, because I'm not really, I'm

45
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:55,430
not that great with Soldier, I, that's to me to do something like that, I was like,

46
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,069
nice, that was a pretty sick thing I did, kill that spy, come up around the corner,

47
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:07,520
we got a minute left, trying to get this Heavy, don't get him, he gets me with his default

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,770
minigun, which you don't see very many of those as of today, after the Uber update,

49
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:19,379
so anyone that's not using the Tomislav, good for you, because it's good to have it spread

50
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,819
out a little bit, not have every single person use the new things, and that's another reason

51
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:29,399
why I could be using the Liberty Launcher right now, but everybody and their grandmother

52
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,540
is using it right now, same thing with the Tomislav, pretty much all the new items, it's,

53
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,980
I mean, I understand people are trying to get used to him, me and the Soldier sprinting

54
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:45,060
up here, we both take out this Heavy together, see how unbelievably useful the riding crop

55
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,420
is, so stop using the Equalizer, use the riding crop, so they get on the point here, and I

56
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,540
only have three health, so I'm trying to just sneak over here and pick somebody off, I get

57
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,579
one person, but it doesn't matter, and this screenshot is great, according to the kill

58
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:06,689
feed, it didn't turn out so well, so they get the point, and we're stuck in overtime

59
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:13,860
now, and this is kind of how King of the Hill maps go sometimes, you know, you'll be down

60
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,019
to the wire, you'll win, essentially your team wins, and the other team at overtime

61
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:26,220
gets it back, and a lot of times, from here on out, they will win this match, that's why

62
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,180
King of the Hill is interesting, because you never know what's really going to happen,

63
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:38,740
so this is kind of embarrassing, I kill this Soldier, and then I get destroyed by a Medic's

64
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,610
Bonesaw Crit, and I was saying when that happened, I was like, oh, maybe I can like cut that

65
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,970
out and nobody will notice, but, I mean, I left it, but I'm not going to take it out,

66
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,329
I promise, this is the last time I'm going to use you for my own gain, so get out here

67
00:05:55,329 --> 00:06:00,329
to the last point, they only have one minute left, and thanks to this guy up here, this

68
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:05,610
Soldier that was up there firing, doing suppressing fire, we got to keep the point, we end up

69
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,350
getting everybody on it, and we are the Weenas!

70
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,689
So this next clip here, it's kind of like a bonus clip, I guess you could say, it's

71
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:23,259
me as a spy on Nucleus, I don't use the Eternal Reward at all, it's an Eternal Reward gameplay,

72
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,459
but I figured because I was showcasing the Soldier, which is something I don't do that

73
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:32,060
often, I would just put this in here, I was a little late, as you can see, it's about

74
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,540
two minutes on each side right now, and I managed to get to the top score position,

75
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,379
so I think that was pretty cool, I have to come in late, so I get a couple kills here,

76
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:45,379
I get this Soldier, I get this Sniper too, and just to talk about what I don't like about

77
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:49,939
the Eternal Reward, why I never use it, I think it's very counterintuitive as playing

78
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:55,019
a spy, I think you should not have to run behind every single person to get your first

79
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:58,699
kill, I don't know, it's not a philosophy I agree with, this is a cool headshot right

80
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:03,060
here, I'm the Scout, I get the kill, but it's something that I don't agree with, I think

81
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,259
that as a spy, you're supposed to, the core gameplay as a spy is you're supposed to blend

82
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:14,899
in and fool people and use people's ignorances to your advantage, I think with this knife

83
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:18,139
you just can't really do that, because right now I'm just running around as a red spy,

84
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:25,139
and it's right there, everybody knows it, and spies are a red flag in this game, spies

85
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:31,019
and medics in this game are red flags, if you see a spy, you kill it, and you do everything

86
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:36,540
you can to kill it, otherwise you didn't do your job, oh spy, I didn't kill that spy,

87
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,860
same thing with a medic, if you see a medic, it's just a big red flag, and I know a lot

88
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,379
of you guys use this knife on offense when you're playing in a control point map or a

89
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,660
payload map, I just don't understand how you guys can do that, it's just too hard, see

90
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,939
king of the hill maps, it's easy to get behind people because everyone's all over the place,

91
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,899
by the way here's a quick tip if you guys don't know, if you sap a building and no one's

92
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:06,500
around, take your revolver out and shoot it a couple times, it will die ten times faster

93
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,459
than if you just sapped it and ran away, and you shouldn't sap it and run away if no one's

94
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:14,500
around because you'll look in the top right corner of the screen in the notification area

95
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:19,579
and find out, oh the engineer just came back and got rid of the sapper, so give it a few

96
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:24,620
shots and I guarantee you that the engineer will not even have time to react, even if

97
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,660
the engineer happens to be ten feet away, you can take out a full sentry before he even

98
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,259
realizes what's going on, even if he gets there, don't freak out, still do it because

99
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:39,259
you can really take down a sentry like that, see right here I didn't have a disguise and

100
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:44,820
I ran out of cloak, so I'm a red flag like I was saying before, but it doesn't matter,

101
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,019
our team handles it pretty well, we end up winning the round and as you can see I made

102
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:54,379
it to the bottom of the chart there when I came in, about half way through the match,

103
00:08:54,379 --> 00:09:00,820
so that's pretty cool, I want to announce this right now too, if I get 500 subscribers,

104
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:07,659
I will do a video showcasing me in real life, you'll get to see me in real life, finally

105
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:13,820
the man behind the mask, and I'm going to do a workout exercise video to try and pump

106
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,019
some of you guys up, so you'll be able to watch that video and go listen to what I tell

107
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:24,340
you and you'll get fucking huge donations, but anyways for real though, thanks a lot

108
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,820
guys you guys, all this means a lot to me, it's awesome, so shoot for 500!
