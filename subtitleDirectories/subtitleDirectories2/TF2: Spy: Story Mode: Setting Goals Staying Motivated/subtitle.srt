00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,380
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:22,379
Playing as the spy tonight with the Ambassador, the Stinger, or the Coniver's Kunai, and of course the Dead Ringer, my default spy setup.

3
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:27,379
Playing on Gold Rush tonight, defense on Gold Rush, but I don't really want to talk about the gameplay.

4
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:31,379
I want to talk about something that is very important to a lot of you guys,

5
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:40,380
and something that I get asked a lot, and this is going to be a great way for me to explain how to keep motivated in things like YouTube,

6
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:46,380
or really anything universally, anything you're trying to do that you're maybe not succeeding so much at,

7
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,380
or maybe you're just starting something and you really want some advice on where to go from the beginning.

8
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,380
And this is what this video is going to be about. It's going to be about goals.

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,679
So let me just start by saying that if you have a particular thing you want to try and do,

10
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,680
let's say you want to be a soccer player, or let's say you want to be a YouTube personality, or you want to do a commentating,

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,980
whatever it is you're trying to do, it's going to be quite difficult to do that thing unless you set yourself a realistic goal.

12
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:20,219
And this goal is constantly going to be updated on I'd say probably like a monthly basis.

13
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,459
Let me start by saying, when I started YouTube, let's just talk about YouTube commentating in general.

14
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:29,879
When I first started YouTube I had zero subscribers, didn't really know the direction I wanted to take the channel,

15
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:38,549
but I knew I wanted to do something. And I would look around at all these channels that had 20, 15, 20, 30,000 subscribers,

16
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,549
and I'd say, damn, how did they get to where they, how did they get there? How did you do that? That's ridiculous.

17
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:52,549
And what I didn't understand back then is all these channels that you're looking at that are really, really popular channels,

18
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:57,730
they all had to start from zero, and they all had to find a way to work themselves up to where they are.

19
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:04,730
And a lot of these guys have been doing this for a couple years, sometimes even three or four years.

20
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,340
So it can take a long time. But let me get back to the whole goals thing.

21
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,509
The reason why I bring that up is because if you don't set yourself a goal, here is one of the realistic goals that I set for myself.

22
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:24,300
When I first started, I said, I want to have 25 subscribers by July. I started this channel in June.

23
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,659
And I knew that if I reached that goal in July, I knew I was going to want to keep going.

24
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:37,659
And then I would set another goal for myself. So once I got, I think I got to like 60 subscribers in July, I was so happy.

25
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:44,900
I was like, wow, I put a goal for myself and I shot way past that goal. I'm going to make a new one.

26
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,900
And every month I just added another couple hundred subscribers to that goal. And it really makes you motivated.

27
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,900
It really makes you want to do it. It makes you want to keep pushing for it.

28
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:01,900
But you can't ever say to yourself, oh, I have 125 subscribers. Next month I want to have 4,000.

29
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:10,900
It's not going to work that way. Some people get lucky. Some people will get really lucky and you'll get 20,000 subscribers in two days.

30
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,900
But that happens because of circumstances that not everyone's going to see.

31
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:25,900
So if you are starting out as a new YouTube channel, or even like I said, if you're a new soccer player or you're a go getting into drama at your school or something like that,

32
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,900
try and set yourself a realistic goal, something that you know you can accomplish.

33
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:38,080
Because if you reach for the stars too early and you don't get to touch them, I like good analogy, right?

34
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,500
If you reach for the stars too early and you get shut down, it really hurts.

35
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,500
And I've been in that position before, guys. Before YouTube, I wanted to be a film director.

36
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:53,039
I went to college for film. I have a film degree. And I never went anywhere with it.

37
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,650
And I've reached way too high. And I think that a lot of people do the same thing.

38
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,650
They try, they reach way too high into the sky, and they get nowhere.

39
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:09,949
And I specifically wanted to make this video to try and answer some of the questions that people have for me in PMs when they say,

40
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,949
You know, I just started my YouTube channel. I'm just starting this, just trying to do that.

41
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:18,949
Where do I go from here? What do I do? I've been doing this for like a couple months.

42
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:24,949
I only have a couple hundred subscribers. And my only real answer to that is you just got to stick with it.

43
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:28,259
You got to stick with it. You've got to put a lot of effort into your channel.

44
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:34,430
Or even if it was something else, it all takes practice, it all takes effort, and it all takes time.

45
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,430
The most important thing that you have to remember about starting anything new

46
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,610
or even if you're already doing it, it takes a lot of time.

47
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,610
I've been doing this for just about a year now. I'm coming up on one year this summertime.

48
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,850
And I'm currently still setting goals. Every month I give myself a new goal and I try to reach it.

49
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,149
And that's what you guys should be trying to do with your stuff, your content, your anything, your flute playing.

50
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:04,149
It doesn't matter what it is. Set yourself some goals and go for them, man.

51
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:08,389
So that's going to be the end of this video, guys. Pretty good spy gameplay.

52
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:15,389
I just wanted to make sure I got this video out to try to help you guys with your new channels or new anything.

53
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,389
If it's something to do with school work or something like that.

54
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:22,389
But I will see you guys all next time and expect more of these videos where I kind of just talk to you guys.

55
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,389
I'm not going to do them all the time, but expect them every now and then.

56
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:30,810
So yeah, see you guys all next time. Take care, everybody.
