1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:22,149
Here comes the huntsman. Here comes the huntsman. I am the huntsman. I will shoot you in the face.

2
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:27,649
Get out of here, spy. Yeah. What do you know? What do you know about that? Shpee.

3
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:35,700
What do you know about that one? Shpee. What do you know about that one, Shpee?

4
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,700
That's a triple kill.

5
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,700
And spies?

6
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,700
No, no, no, no, no, no. Get out of here, Shpee.

7
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,259
I got him. At least I got the Shpee.

8
00:00:46,259 --> 00:01:00,049
Hey, medic. How are you? Hey, spy. Time to singumentary. You want me to singumentary right now?

9
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:05,049
Do you understand what a singumentary is? You know what? Just get... Both of you guys are just done.

10
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:24,049
You see that headshot. You see that headshot. Just two in a row. Make it three in a row. Make it four in a row.

11
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,480
Actually, was that four in a row? I don't even know.

12
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:42,140
Get that headshot, girl. You gotta play. Team Fortress 2 is on its way. Got Star in the call and he's playing ten million. What is he doing that for?

13
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,140
I gotta beat this because you beat it. I feel like less of a man.

14
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,299
Come on. Are you sure you don't want to have two default snipers sitting in spawn AFK?

15
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,980
I'm sure. I want them there. I told them to stay there.

16
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,980
Are you sure that you want to have two default snipers sitting AFK in spawn?

17
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,480
Yeah, I told them to stay there. We need them there. What if they start spawn camping us?

18
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,560
Yeah, what if?

19
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,580
Oh, I'm on the red team. Toadman.

20
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,750
Hey, you made it. You made it on the team?

21
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,750
Toadman.

22
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,379
Oh, great. Where are you? Oh, hi, Toadman. Hi.

23
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,009
You want to high five me? Fine. Here's a high five.

24
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:29,009
I've never seen this joke before.

25
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:36,939
You're ruining this whole game. You're going to be. No, this is it.

26
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:43,439
No, with me again.

27
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,150
The I blew up joke. I don't want to see that again.

28
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,150
You're going to see it again.

29
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,949
No, I'm not. Because it's three, two, one, go. Go.

30
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:58,949
This scout is so toast. Damn it. I said that so preliminarily.

31
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,780
Wow. Is this mad, Jerma?

32
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,449
No. Is this what it's like when you're mad, Jerma?

33
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:18,449
Because you're mad right now.

34
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,199
You mad right now?

35
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,849
All right, come here.

36
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:27,849
Come here. I want you to go as fast as possible.

37
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,389
That sounded like a little kid.

38
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:52,699
I want to get up top, but we can't get up top.

39
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,379
Here, come with me. Come with me. You ready to come with me? You ready to come with me?

40
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:58,379
Don't whip me. I might blow myself up.

41
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,379
No, don't. If you blow yourself up right now.

42
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,379
Watch out for this stupid scout dickhead.

43
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:06,379
Oh, look, you got to spawn. Who cares? Let's go.

44
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,379
Let's go left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left. We're doing a flanking maneuver.

45
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,379
Do you know what that means? Have you ever been to school?

46
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:16,629
You're way faster than me. Hold on. Come here. Come here. Hit detection.

47
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:19,579
Rocket jump. Rocket jump.

48
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,579
That's a spy scout. That's got to be.

49
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:26,060
Do you like that sick rocket jump, rocket jump, kill?

50
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,660
Here we go. Center down. Center down. Center down. Make it happen.

51
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,889
What are you playing, Pyro? I'm a sniper.

52
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:38,889
I was just walking with you just with me.

53
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:41,889
I don't remember my memory. I have a memory of an elephant.

54
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,180
Reverse. There's going to be a scout coming up here.

55
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,180
What? No, he's going to kill me. No, I'm going to get.

56
00:04:48,180 --> 00:05:01,800
I'm going to get panned. Oh, do you shut up?

57
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,860
Shut your mouth. I'm not talking.

58
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:16,160
I got him to 150. You see that 150? No, did you see that 150?

59
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:24,550
But we were moving on.

60
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:31,610
Oh, your day. Shit.

61
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:38,430
Did you see that 150? Yeah, on me. That guy 150'd me.

62
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,930
Did you see that 150? Did you see that 150?

63
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,449
Star, I have a really serious question for you.

64
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:50,220
Did you see that 150? I'm going to soil my diaper.

65
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,220
I'm a baby. I soiled my baby diaper.

66
00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:00,500
There's a spy behind you. What? You are such a troll.

67
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,500
I really thought. I seriously thought.

68
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,250
No, no, seriously behind you now. Shut up.

69
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,959
No, are you serious?

70
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:19,449
I'm checking everybody because of this.

71
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:29,240
I have a feeling that you are just being a dick weed right now.

72
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,930
Yeah, you totally are.

73
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,930
There's a scout running at slower speed.

74
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,930
I wonder if he's like a spy. He's got like the pistol out.

75
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,709
I don't know. I just heard.

76
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:46,079
I seriously heard the dead ringer. I'm not kidding.

77
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,660
Got to be the most obvious spy, not spy you can be.

78
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,930
Can I get a heal too? Could I get. Could you heal me?

79
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,939
Please God.

80
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,110
There's a health kit down here.

81
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,290
Yeah, it's a little tiny shitty one.

82
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,290
Oh my God, you're the worst.

83
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,230
This guy's going to die because of you.

84
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,600
Did you see what you've done? Did you make it down there?

85
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,350
Do you see what you've done?

86
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,230
Okay, I'm going in.

87
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,220
What do you mean you're going in?

88
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,399
I'm going in. I'm not going in.

89
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,829
I need health.

90
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:26,930
Yeah, it would be great if I got that health too.

91
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:40,329
This guy actually did it.

92
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:42,329
Watch out, crits.
