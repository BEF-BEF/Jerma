00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,059
Hello everybody, welcome to Modern Warfare 3.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:10,060
If you're as excited for this game as I was, being one of the top ten players in the world.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,060
That's right, this is Jerma's grandfather here.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,059
Not Jerma, he's not as good as me, he can't give you the tips.

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,059
He can't give you the strategies that I can.

6
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,059
So let me just tell you that I'm one of the best players in the world.

7
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:26,059
And I'll show you right here, look at this, get the fuck out of here buddy.

8
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,059
Let me tell you, I have so much confidence in my game.

9
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:37,060
If I die one time in this fucking gameplay, then I'm going to pay everybody $6,000.

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,060
You understand me? That's how good I am.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:47,649
I usually put up 400... Jeremy! Jeremy, come down here!

12
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:52,490
Hey, how do I restart recordings?

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,490
I can't hear you, what?

14
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,490
Come here, how do I restart a recording?

15
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,490
What are you doing? You're recording?

16
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,490
I just fucking told everybody I was going to give them $6,000.

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,489
I don't have that kind of fucking money.

18
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,489
Oh gee, it's F9.

19
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:07,489
It's F9?

20
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:08,489
Yeah.

21
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:09,489
Okay, well I just...

22
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:12,489
Hey everybody, it's Jerma's grandfather here.

23
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:17,489
Bringing you a first ever modern Warfare 3 gameplay on his channel.

24
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:23,489
And I'm going to tell you all the tips and all the strategies of how to be the best player in Planet Earth.

25
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:27,489
And I'm pretty good at this game, I'm not that good, but I've been...

26
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:30,489
People have told me that I'm pretty good.

27
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:34,730
So this gun is the SCAR-L and the attachments on it.

28
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,730
And you're going to be the red dot sight.

29
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,730
And it's going to have less recoil.

30
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:47,730
And the perks are going to be Hardline Pro, Sleight of Hand, and I don't remember the third one.

31
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:52,730
So I've found that if you want to be lighter, you want to throw all your grenades out.

32
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,730
Within the first two seconds of the game.

33
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,730
And every time you respawn.

34
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,730
Because you don't want to carry that extra fucking weight.

35
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,730
You know, that's just extra weight.

36
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,219
And if you happen to hit somebody on your team with a flashbang, fuck them.

37
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:13,219
Another tip I want to give you is always unload your entire clip whenever you shoot the gun.

38
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,219
Because it just scares people away.

39
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,219
They see the spray and they get scared of you.

40
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:20,219
And that's how you show real dominance.

41
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:21,219
You say, here's my gun.

42
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:24,219
And here's me unloading the fucking whole clip on you.

43
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:26,219
And hold on, I have to diarrhea.

44
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,719
Okay, I'm back from diarrhea-ing.

45
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,719
And I got another tip for you.

46
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,719
This one is for communicating before the game.

47
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,719
You always want to make sure people understand what your plan is.

48
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,719
Because you have to make sure they know what you're talking about.

49
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,960
So make sure here's an example.

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Has anybody in here seen the new movie with Adam Sandler with his big balls?

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,439
Wow, you're old.

52
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,439
Shut up, alright? Jesus, fuck.

53
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,439
Here's a scoreboard from the game.

54
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,439
And as you can tell, I got 13 kills.

55
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,439
And 15 people in the game said I was a cool guy.

56
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,439
And they got rid of deaths.

57
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,439
There's no more deaths.

58
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,439
I did not doctor this photo.

59
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,680
So it looks like this for everybody.

60
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,680
And if it doesn't look like this, then you have a computer bug.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
So I'll talk to you guys later.

62
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
See you. Have fun in the game, you fuckers.
