00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,839
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,

2
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:23,070
and tonight, gonna be playing as the Engineer, Aggressive Defense Engineer, playing on the

3
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,230
big coil on Thunder Mountain, or the big snake, whatever you want to call it. It's, I think,

4
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,289
the last part of Thunder Mountain. But anyways, this video is not gonna really cover any of

5
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:38,649
the gameplay on the screen, but it is gonna cover a gaming topic, and that is competitive.

6
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:43,929
And what it now means to me, and how I feel about the competitive communities across the

7
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:48,570
globe doesn't matter what game you're playing. Because, as you know, some of you, most of

8
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,600
you, a lot of you know by now, we are going to E3. Now, if you haven't been on the channel

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,399
for a few days, or you don't know what I'm talking about, I'll try and break it down

10
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,299
a little bit here. So a few days ago, me, Ster, and MLC Stealth, we joined into this

11
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:06,120
Shoot Mania Storm tournament on Twitch TV. And the two people that were the top two

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,040
in that tournament move on to E3 to play in the Grand Finals. And we're one of those

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,730
teams. I don't know how we did it. I don't know, it really, it still hasn't hit me yet.

14
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,129
I'm still kind of sitting in this chair going, am I really about to get on a plane in like

15
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:25,730
less than 24 hours to go to E3? Is this really happening? My mind has not settled around

16
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,730
that fact yet. And I know it will. When I get on that plane, I'm gonna be sitting there,

17
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,730
the captain's gonna go, this is your captain speaking. We are now taking off to Los Angeles

18
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,810
International Airport. And I'm just gonna be like, oh my God, I'm going to E3. And I'm

19
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,849
gonna scare the ever living crap out of everybody on the plane. And that's not my intention.

20
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:47,120
I apologize if you're on that plane that I'm on, but I'm getting off track. The point is

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,400
we are going there to E3. We're all gonna be there. We're all gonna hang out. Shibby's

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,319
gonna be there or we're all gonna just, it's gonna be ridiculous. And I'm bringing my camera.

23
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:01,730
Don't worry, I am gonna get random footage of us being crazy in those hotel rooms. But

24
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:07,049
I do have to say this though. This is a massive thank you, massive shout out to anybody that

25
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,810
came to that stream that was supporting our team. Because we would look at that chat and

26
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,889
we would see people going, yeah, YouTube, money, crush them, let's go. And there were

27
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:20,050
so many of them. It was just so motivating. Whether you came from Shibby, Star, MLC Stealth,

28
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,210
my channel, wherever you came from. Thank you so much for doing that. You guys rock.

29
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:31,580
Well, freaking yeah. So now I want to transition from that to talk about competitive gaming

30
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,819
and sort of what I think about it and how I feel now, especially now after winning or

31
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,199
not winning, but coming in the top two of this tournament to go to E3. So competitive

32
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,080
gaming, the only thing, the only experience I've ever had with comp gaming is when I was

33
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,590
11, when I was 11 years old, I won a gaming competition at my local Blockbuster. Now that

34
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,469
might not sound like competitive gaming, but it was for me when I was 11, I was like, oh

35
00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:00,669
my God, I'm playing, I'm going to be in a tournament. And it was exciting. But so the

36
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:05,349
winner of that tournament got to get free rentals from Blockbuster. I think for a couple

37
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:09,110
months or something like that, you get free video game rentals. That's back when video

38
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,719
game rentals were the big thing. And that's also back when Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis

39
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:21,360
were the big guys on the block. And now I feel old. Talking about Super Nintendo, I

40
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,879
owned a regular Nintendo and an Atari. That's how old I am. I'm pretty much as old as a

41
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:32,840
dinosaur egg. Well, not really. But that is the only time up until this past weekend

42
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,469
where I've ever competed in a game situation for real prizes or real notoriety. And I think

43
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:44,830
I want to keep doing it because it was so much fun, guys. This last weekend, it was

44
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:50,310
really tough. It was really competitive. It was really adrenaline rushing. And we spent

45
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,069
a lot of time practicing. We were prepared for this tournament. And even still, there

46
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:58,150
were a lot of good teams. And when you go up against a team that's evenly matched with

47
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,439
you, calling out strategies and trying to get in position, trying to really land down

48
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:08,159
those shots, my mind was in a tornado. And it wasn't a bad thing. It was a good thing.

49
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,180
And it really got me into the game. And I want to keep doing it. It was a rush. I can't

50
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,029
explain that a lot of you guys that play competitive probably already know what I'm talking about.

51
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:21,410
We were going up against some quake pros. We were going up against Counter-Strike 1.6

52
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,730
A couple other guys that had a lot of competitive experience. And it was just so exciting. And

53
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:33,360
my question for the video, I guess, is competitive-wise, how many of you guys have done some tournaments

54
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,360
or maybe won a couple things? And that doesn't mean Team Fortress. I'm talking anything.

55
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,319
I'm talking Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, Quake, Unreal. A lot of you guys are older

56
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,370
too, so you might have some of that experience under your belt as well. And I guess a follow-up

57
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:53,259
question is, getting into competitive, how do you get prepared? Because how I got prepared

58
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,740
is I drank like four coffees and listened to a bunch of music in my headphones as loud

59
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,860
as it can go to try and get me squared away. And then we just started playing. So I want

60
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,660
to know what your guys' process is, because this is really interesting stuff. And it's

61
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,420
stuff I like to know. So before this video is over, I want to bring this up again. Thank

62
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,139
you so much to everybody that came and supported that stream and came and supported us playing

63
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:23,139
in that tournament. And also a lot of stuff went in behind the scenes with Shibby2142

64
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:28,699
kind of being our PR guy to get our team straightened away, and Incredible Orb. Without Incredible

65
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:33,279
Orb, I would not have been in this tournament. Neither would anybody. So big, huge shout

66
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,240
out to Orb. You the man, dude. And I hope to see you at E3. I'm going to give you a

67
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,389
big hug. So thank you guys so much for watching video-wise for this channel in the next four

68
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,870
or five days. I'm going to have stuff schedule uploaded, so don't worry. There's going to

69
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,170
be content here, regardless of me being at E3. And if any of you guys are in the Los

70
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:57,500
Angeles area at the E3 Expo, I will salute you, and hopefully I see you there. So I'll

71
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,939
see you guys all soon, and take care, everybody.
