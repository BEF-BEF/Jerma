1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,259
Don't head out to sea understock. No one beats my prices. Friend, come and see for yourself.

2
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,259
Got some coin to spend? What? Up!

3
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:19,260
Shut up! Keep that.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,260
Have a look. No matter what you pick, I guarantee you'll love it.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,260
Shut up!

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,260
Shit! Where's your eyes?

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,259
Friends, come see what I've got in stock today.

8
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:35,259
Swab the deck!

9
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:37,619
Sweep the floors!

10
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,950
Sweep the cannon!

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,219
Be a lookout!

12
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,780
What the fuck are you doing?

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,780
You're gonna come on my boat!

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,140
And not do work?

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:57,299
You're the one limey bastard that's gonna get a knife straight into your skull!

16
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,299
You know what? You can stay.

17
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:03,979
You can stay.

18
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:09,030
Go bird.

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,030
Go, do it again. Steal from this guy too.

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,030
Good job. Good job. You picked up a couple of his hairs.

21
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,030
Nice. Two of his hairs.

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,030
How do you do?

23
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,030
Oh, fine. How do you do?

24
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,030
How do you do?

25
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,030
God be with you.

26
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,030
God be with you.

27
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,030
Good day. Good day to you.

28
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,030
How is it? How do you do?

29
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,030
Oh, fine. How do you do?

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,319
Oh, fine. How do you do?

31
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:44,629
Something wrong with my bird.

32
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:47,629
Stupid pig. Get out of here.

33
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:52,969
What the fuck is that? Is that a gorilla? Is that a monkey?

34
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:58,909
What are these animals doing? Why are they just all hostile?

35
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,909
If you're this close to the town, get out of here.

36
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:04,859
Alright, pig. Get him.

37
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,099
Get him, pig.

38
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,099
He just threw a rock at me.

39
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:13,099
You're gonna throw rocks? That's what you do?

40
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,099
You little shit.

41
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:19,879
I'm glad I get to see the pitching machine monkey.

42
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,180
It's rapidly throwing rocks.

43
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,870
I just like the batting cages.

44
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,620
Holy Jesus!

45
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,530
What the fuck?

46
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,530
Why is it like mountain lions?

47
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,770
Help me.

48
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,770
Help me, guys. Quick.

49
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,669
God be with you.

50
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:47,419
Good day. Good day.

51
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:58,169
Indeed. Oh, please.

52
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:03,610
For some ale.

53
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,610
Good day to you.

54
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,610
That Spanish commander, what's his name?

55
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,610
His fleet's been restless these days.

56
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,610
That's another guy. It comes from the same guy.

57
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,610
That guy just...

58
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,610
Oh, let me just be in mid-conversation.

59
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,610
Eating an apple while I walk by eating an apple.

60
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,520
No, this fucking alligator is so stupid.

61
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,520
There's no reason for this to be in the game.

62
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,520
There's just one alligator.

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,400
Okay, now the alligator doesn't go in the water?

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,659
It's just a sand alligator.

65
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,659
He's afraid of the water. That doesn't make any sense.

66
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,860
You think you're a big man, don't you?

67
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
Yeah, you really do. You stare at you.

68
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,860
Stare at my eyes.

69
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,229
Yeah, you ain't nothing.

70
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:01,409
I'm not gonna look away.

71
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,060
You're gonna look away first.

72
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,300
Are you really all just afraid of the water?

73
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,300
Except for the pitching monkey. He's not afraid.

74
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,919
Well, he kind of is afraid.

75
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,250
I tricked him.

76
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,430
You see, I'm the smart one. I'm the man.

77
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,430
I am the human.

78
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,430
You're scared of the water, so I put you in the water.

79
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,430
So you're afraid to come out.

80
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,800
Stupid animals.

81
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,040
That's why we will always reign as humans.

82
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:53,959
God, right now we are standing in the temple of Osiris.

83
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:57,959
And I can tell you right now, guys, I'm a little excited as an anthropologist and an archaeologist.

84
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,959
I have been waiting for this day for a long time.

85
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,959
I'm a little nervous. I can't wait. My whole life has been dedicated to this.

86
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,959
I can't wait to give it a try.

87
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,959
Getting a little too excited.

88
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,199
Getting a little too excited.

89
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,199
I don't want this to be a puzzle game. I don't want to do puzzles.

90
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,379
I don't want to do a puzzle.

91
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:19,610
All right. Is this where I'm supposed to go?

92
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,610
I think so. I've got to drop down.

93
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,980
This is one of those games where you have to find the place to drop down.

94
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,980
This is it. Right here.

95
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:36,040
Specific amount of damage.

96
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,339
Hold on. How much damage is that?

97
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,339
One, two, three.

98
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,339
One, two, three.

99
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:44,339
One hundred and seven million damage.

100
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:49,660
That's a fucking shitload.

101
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,730
Hold on a second.

102
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,730
I've got to make sure there's no traps in here.

103
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,160
Okay. I've been fooled before.

104
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,160
You know, I've been fooled before.

105
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,660
Nothing on the walls.

106
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,220
Nothing on the ground.

107
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,220
Nothing on the ceiling.

108
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,220
I'm pretty sure that that's normal. Nothing.

109
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,220
So we're free. I think we're going to be all right.

110
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,220
Step on the button and let's go continue our quest.

111
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:18,149
The button kills you.

112
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,149
You put in some crocodiles. You put in some pigs.

113
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,149
What, a dragon?

114
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,149
A dragon is in the game.

115
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:26,149
You're going to put a dragon in the game?

116
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:35,689
A real one?

117
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:41,180
How? Can I?

118
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,180
I guess we're going to just slide down this.

119
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:50,089
I wonder how long this is going to take.

120
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:56,040
Is this ever going to end?

121
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,040
There probably has to be something at the bottom.

122
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,920
I'm using my sword. See, I'm cutting down.

123
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
What you guys don't understand is I'm cutting down right now.

124
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Like this is a cool action movie.

125
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,920
I stuck the sword in and it's sliding down like puss in boots.

126
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Didn't he do that in that movie?

127
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,569
What are some other things we can talk about?

128
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:18,920
This is in fact...

129
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
No, we're going to pass it.

130
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Going right by. I believe that is the last level I was just in.

131
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
I think. I could be wrong though.

132
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,930
I've been wrong before.

133
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,769
I see water.

134
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:33,769
Or is that water or is that just terrain texture?

135
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:35,769
I believe that's just terrain texture.

136
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:37,769
At least we're going to land.

137
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:41,540
We've landed.

138
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,129
So I'm in no man's land right now.

139
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,199
Shit's getting a little weird.

140
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,199
I wonder if there's anywhere...

141
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,699
Can I go anywhere?

142
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:54,699
Have I unlocked the secrets of humanity by falling down the giant dragon pillar?

143
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:57,129
I believe I have.

144
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,259
What's this?

145
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:05,300
What's with this random tree?

146
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,990
Who put this random tree here?

147
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,990
Alright, Ted.

148
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,990
You put a tree in this spot down the lower left.

149
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,990
Delete that.

150
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,829
Control Z.

151
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,649
What the fuck am I?

152
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:24,040
I'm lost.

153
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,220
This just got so scary.

154
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,220
This really just got scary.

155
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,440
There's nothing out here?

156
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
I should turn back?

157
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,000
They have actual text in the game to tell me to turn around.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,649
Because I got to the end of the developer's map.

159
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:42,649
There's nothing out here.

160
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:44,649
I should probably turn back.

161
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,549
Yeah, turn back to where is the question.

162
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:52,779
If I get the sun, I will get superpowers.

163
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,779
I can't imagine anything else what this could be besides the sun.

164
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,779
It's the sun.

165
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,620
Or is that God?

166
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,500
I'm not sure.

167
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Entertaining to say the least.

168
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:16,419
You know what this looks like?

169
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:18,789
I'm in a movie theater.

170
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:21,220
I found the secret.

171
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,830
Game crashed.

172
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,830
It was a big projector.
