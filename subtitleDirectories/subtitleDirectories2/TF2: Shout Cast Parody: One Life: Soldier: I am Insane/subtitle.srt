00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:07,780
Hello ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's me Anthony Wimbleton here with another German 9.85 shoutcast on his Shadow of a Team Fortress 2.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,880
I got a lot of requests to get back into this and do another shoutcast, so I'm gonna start it here we go.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,380
One, two, three, four, five, let's do it!

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,879
Playing right now is the Soldier with the black box and the shock and the default shock and actually it is strange, I'm sorry about that.

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,079
And I have on the frying pan, I think I do.

6
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,980
Playing with the black box right now, when you use the black box, when you shoot somebody and you make direct contact with them,

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,280
you get plus 15 health added to your total health.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,679
It is amazing, unbelievable Soldier item.

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,380
Playing on King of the Hill Harvest Final right now, one of the more fun maps in Team Fortress 2, especially for King of the Hill maps.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,979
Getting this started now, Jerma comes out here, shoots a rocket to the right side and look at the point capture, it is almost capped for the red team.

11
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:47,679
Spy almost gets the backstab on Jerma, but he's not smart enough to get behind him, so Jerma's okay.

12
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,380
Sniper right here, Jerma gets a couple of rockets on him, gets the final shot on him and kills him.

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,179
Jerma is fine, ran and dandy.

14
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:57,579
Unfortunately, the medic went down and Jerma is very saddened by that, but Jerma is now trying to defend the point.

15
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:02,079
We got a couple of people coming on here, Scout gets on the point, Jerma gets a malpiro coming on here now, Jerma is okay.

16
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,980
He may be on fire, but Jerma has the confidence of 15 balls running in the ball parade.

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,780
If you've never seen the ball parade, it's a very, very interesting thing, funny to watch.

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,980
If you want to check it out, go to www.BallParadeIsAwesomeAndFun.com.

19
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,879
That website does not exist, I just made it up, please do not go there and waste your time.

20
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,780
Jerma gets the health back and is now on fire again.

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,180
When I say that, I mean that metaphorically, now he's on fire with the shots.

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,879
Prime example right here, Jerma turns around, sees an enemy pyro, shooting a friendly pyro.

23
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,379
Which one's the right pyro? Just like a mystery movie on TV, he makes the right decision.

24
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,079
Enemy Spy gets blown up as well, and now he got a soldier on soldier fight right here with Jerma versus this dude.

25
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,780
We don't know his name, I'm not sure, I'll find out.

26
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,780
He gets a couple of shots and exchanging fire.

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,879
What's gonna happen here? He's getting no more shots, that pulls out the shot, can equalize and run away.

28
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,480
Does he get the- he gets the shot right in his back, unbelievable display of athleticism.

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,780
I gotta bring in one of my colleagues right now to try and explain what just happened.

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,379
Everyone, please welcome David from the mail room.

31
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:53,879
David, how can you analyze that situation? What just happened?

32
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,680
That was pretty cool.

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,180
Yeah, I'm sure it was pretty cool, David, but the real reason why I invited you up here was because I'm actually firing you.

34
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,579
So you're fired, thanks for coming, your performance has been pretty lackluster, et cetera, et cetera.

35
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:04,879
See you later, thanks for coming.

36
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,780
Take a look now at the bottom portion of your screen.

37
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,479
You will see that the enemy just capped the point, which is bad news,

38
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,080
cause Jerma and his medic could have been out here protecting it, but they were in that choke point the whole time.

39
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,180
Getting a couple of shotgun shots on that soldier, and he gets a blind fire shot on exactly what I'm not sure,

40
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,280
but he kills whatever the hell was in there.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,180
Medic now has a hundred percent uber charge.

42
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,080
Jerma, this pyro, and his medic trying to find a way back onto the point to take it back to square one for the blue team.

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,180
Scout gets on the point. He is not a factor because he's on fire and runs away, frankly.

44
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,280
They got the point captured right here, and this is where things get really, really rocky for the blue team.

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,879
Here comes the entire red team. Here comes Puff, the uber.

46
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,280
Kaboom! There they all go, everyone's dead, absolutely fantastic.

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,180
Trying to find somebody to shoot at, they're covered in the uber charge goo.

48
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,180
Looking to the left, Jerma sees a sniper and a scout,

49
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,280
but he doesn't want to go deal with him because, as we all know, he wants to find the heavy medic pair again,

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,379
straight ahead towards the spawn area.

51
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:57,680
And sure as sheep's milk, he finds him, shoots the heavy, and shoots the medic with a couple of shotgun shots.

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
That was exactly what he was looking for.

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,979
Jerma and his medic now come out to the courtyard area, get lit on fire by a pyro.

54
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:05,180
He's going for the extinguisher kill. He does not get it.

55
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,680
Jerma gets him with a shotgun kill.

56
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,479
Treading backwards now, Jerma does not want to get shot in the face by anybody.

57
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,979
Lots of people around here on the red team.

58
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:13,879
Jerma finds a way backwards, and here comes another enemy pyro.

59
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,479
Jerma gets the lucky shot on him. Unbelievable.

60
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,080
Whipping around this corner, Jerma sees a disguised spy, gets him with a lucky crit.

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Not sure if he's a dead ringer or not, but it doesn't matter because he checks this demo man behind him anyways.

62
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,379
It's not a dead ringer.

63
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,479
Runging now down towards this heavy, Jerma's being a really risky bastard.

64
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,580
Is he going to get the shot? One, two, three, oh no!

65
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,419
Jerma dies, and that is going to be the end of the shoutcast because I'm...

66
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,639
out of breath.

67
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,340
So if you're wondering why I decided to do this, I wanted to put a one-life gameplay

68
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,939
and a shoutcast together because I got a lot of good responses from both of those two things.

69
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:56,879
People like the shoutcast, people like the one-life series, so I figure why not combine them?

70
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,180
And technically what you're seeing now is not any more of the one-life gameplay,

71
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,080
but like you all know, I do not like to have gameplays that last less than three, four, five minutes.

72
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,580
So I'm going to talk to you about one more thing here.

73
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,680
So if you are familiar with my Facebook, then you already know this and I don't have to tell you again,

74
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,379
but for those of you that do not know, I am now a Machinima Respawn Director.

75
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:21,379
I mentioned it in my Q&A answers video, maybe for a second or two,

76
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:26,279
but Grandpa is going to have a show on Machinima Respawn now.

77
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,680
I will let you guys know whenever that happens, whenever it's going to be up there.

78
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,180
I can't wait to get started. I can't wait to get my first upload on there.

79
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,959
I am going crazy right now. I'm going to work so hard on this, guys.

80
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,560
Thank you, everybody.

81
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,160
This is to every single one of you out there that subscribed, that liked, that favored,

82
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,660
that do everything, that do anything you guys do to support this channel.

83
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm totally grateful and I always will be grateful.

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,560
And for the first person that subscribed to this channel, the first guy, you rock, dude.

85
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,959
And the guy that just subscribed two seconds ago, all you guys rock.

86
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,259
You guys are all amazing and hopefully that this series will take off

87
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,259
and maybe get some more support, maybe get some more channel growth.

88
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,459
Who knows what's going to happen, but thank you all so much for watching.

89
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:11,860
I really do appreciate it. I will see you all next time and take care, everybody.
