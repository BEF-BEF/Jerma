Hey, what is going on guys? Jerma here with SCP-087. Now, if you don't know what this

2
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:21,350
game is, this is a freeware game. The link will be in the description. It's a horror

3
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,949
game, and apparently it's one of the scariest damn games ever made. Now, I don't do well

4
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:30,789
with these types of games, and as you can see, I'm down the first flight of stairs and I

5
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,640
already don't want to play. But I have to, and I figured it would be fun to have the

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,090
face cam there in case something crazy happens, which I know it will. So, let's get started.

7
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,179
And to try not to psych myself out while I do this, I'm going to give you the backstory

8
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:59,960
of the game. So, pretty much this game, I already don't want to do this. So, pretty much this game

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,640
was made in two days by a guy, some programming designer or something. He said he did it on

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:16,340
coffee breaks, and it's a stairway... Somebody's coming behind me right now, I don't want to look

11
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:24,260
up there. It's a stairway simulator game, where this is really all you do, and... God,

12
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:37,900
God damn it. Get me out of here. I can't stop moving now. I don't know how long... This could

13
00:01:37,900 --> 00:02:02,260
last like less than three minutes, and I might just rage to quit. Damn it, I hate this. But you

14
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:12,379
go down a series of stairs over and over again, and that's the game. And the goal is to see how

15
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:17,300
far you can go down, how many stairs you can go down. I'm at floor number six, and I'm almost

16
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:25,610
ready to just quit this game. And it messes with you, too. I keep on repeating myself, probably,

17
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:31,509
but that's because I am terrified right now. I can't even play Resident Evil without having

18
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:48,969
somebody else in the room with me, let alone a game like this. Floor eight. You know what? I need

19
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:54,520
ten people in the room with me to all be hanging out, because this is me by myself with headphones

20
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:06,460
on. What the hell was that? Floor number nine. Wait, wasn't I already on? The stuff is getting

21
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:20,409
louder, too. That's the worst part about this. Stuff is getting just loud and horrible. See,

22
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:26,009
it's so much repetition that you're doing the same thing over and over again, and you know

23
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:42,490
at some point something horrible is going to happen. You just don't know when. So I'm going to...

24
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,349
If you hit escape, you end the game. Hitting escape ends it, and that's going to happen,

25
00:03:47,349 --> 00:04:16,779
definitely. Nineteen. It's actually, it's really... Oh my God! You knew it was going to happen at

26
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:28,410
some point. You just didn't know when. I'm at floor 20. I'm done. Can't give up that easily.

27
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:44,680
This stuff is going to get much... I don't even want to go down. God... God... You bastard. You son

28
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:58,740
of a bitch. I don't think I'll be able to... I don't think I'll be able to go past 30. Somebody's

29
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,500
right there. That was something. What is that? Oh, it's the shadow. It's the shadow of the...

30
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:23,980
That's the first time I saw that. That is the first time. 27. See, the shadows are really

31
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,660
starting to mess with you now. The shadows are really starting to kick in and really start to

32
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:45,290
freak you out because I didn't notice them before. I can't even look at the screen. I can't. I

33
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:56,939
seriously can't look at the screen. My whole body hurts right now from what just happened.

34
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:17,660
What is that? That's a face. Oh my God! Okay. See you next time.
