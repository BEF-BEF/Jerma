00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:14,679
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:20,679
This time I'm gonna continue the series I started a while back called One Life, where I showcase One Life from One Class.

3
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:24,679
You guys know the deal. Show you something cool, show you a good kill streak.

4
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:31,859
As you can see on the screen, playing as the Engineer with the default Sentry Gun, the Frontier Justice and the Short Circuit.

5
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,859
And let me just tell you that I max out the Frontier Justice crits and I put them to very good use.

6
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:40,859
I'm pretty lucky that I was recording during this particular gameplay because sometimes I don't.

7
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:43,859
Sometimes I just kind of want to play for fun and I don't want to record.

8
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,859
Don't want to have to worry about the pressure of recording, but I'm glad I did because this is a great gameplay.

9
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:51,859
So let's get started. No more talking about nonsense. Here we go.

10
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:58,859
Level 3 Sentry is now built up to completion and let me just tell you quickly, this is a great spot to put a Sentry Gun on defense.

11
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:05,859
Only because it's the turning point of the cart and at least the first time that people come around this area here,

12
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:11,859
the first time they take this turn, they're not going to expect it because the point cap is right there.

13
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:15,859
They're thinking about capping the point. They're not thinking about turning around and having a Sentry Gun there.

14
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:18,859
That's a Spy. My Medic told me to turn around at the right time.

15
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:22,859
Thank you because that would have ended right there and this gameplay would not exist.

16
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:24,859
So props to good, aware Medics, huh?

17
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:28,420
Speaking of which, watch what happens here.

18
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,420
Sentry gets sapped and I try to go for the Spy for a second or two, but it doesn't matter.

19
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,420
That Medic gets the kill with the Ubersaw.

20
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,420
So fantastic job, Medic. You really saved my ass at least two times in this gameplay.

21
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,420
So thank you very much.

22
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,849
Putting a Teleporter up now, I don't really do anything with it.

23
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:47,849
I forgot when I came out of the gate to put a Teleporter up,

24
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:51,849
which is something I don't normally do because Engineer is my number one played class,

25
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:55,849
except maybe for Spy, but Engineer is my pretty much bread and butter class.

26
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:02,280
So me doing that, when I realized it, I said, Oh God, terrible Engineer. I don't even have a Teleporter.

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,280
People are going to yell at me, but it didn't even matter. We ended up crushing them anyways.

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,280
So just sitting here whacking the Sentry.

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,280
I turned the corner because there was really no action going on right now,

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
so I wanted to see where the enemy team was.

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Turn the corner. They are coming up here pretty soon.

32
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,280
Coming back, just whacking the Sentry more and more, get another kill.

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,520
This is kind of what you do as an Engineer.

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,699
You kind of sit back and you let the enemies come to you while you play your guitar

35
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:27,699
and you watch your TV and you eat your TV dinners at the same time.

36
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:31,259
That was terrible, but watch this.

37
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,259
This is ridiculous. Look at how many Spies there were here.

38
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:37,259
I thought that was an eternal reward Spy on their team

39
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,259
because he backstabbed that Spy who looked like he was on our team

40
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,259
and turned into that Spy. It's just ridiculous.

41
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,259
And then there was another Spy that was just de-cloaking.

42
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:52,259
If you want to watch that back, I put it in slow motion so you can see it a little better and more clearly.

43
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:54,259
I don't think I'll ever see something like that ever again.

44
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:58,620
Just three Spies just stabbing each other and walking into each other at the same time.

45
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,620
So my Sentry is racking up a lot of kills.

46
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,620
Nine kills and two assists at the moment right now.

47
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,620
Me and this Medic are kind of just hanging back here alone.

48
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,620
So I told the Medic, I said, don't run out there, don't get yourself killed.

49
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,620
There's a Mini-Sentry, there's a bunch of people.

50
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,620
Because take a look over yonder, the rest of the team is back there.

51
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,620
So we're kind of down here by ourselves and finally a Pyro comes back here.

52
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,620
But look, pretty much no man's land back here.

53
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,620
And then a Demo Knight comes out of nowhere.

54
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,620
I thought he was going to kill the Medic and a Spy.

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,620
The Medic ubers me to save my life for like the third time in a row.

56
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Coming out here just because I wanted to make something happen, try to cause some chaos.

57
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,620
The Sentry goes down unfortunately, but take a look at the lower right-hand corner.

58
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,620
29 crits, here we go.

59
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,620
Time to cause complete and total chaos.

60
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,620
She thought this was so funny.

61
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,620
This was a friend of mine, Lydia, that's the Medic by the way.

62
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,620
I was cracking up, she was cracking up.

63
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,620
It was a great time, just having fun.

64
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,620
29 crits.

65
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,620
I think the maximum is 29, I don't think you can get further than that.

66
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,620
Valve put a cap on it so you can't just sit there with like 400 crits for an entire round.

67
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,620
29's the cap, I think I only shoot 11 or 12 rounds just because I get myself killed.

68
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,860
After about 4 kills or 5 kills, I take my final shot on that Scout, but I die.

69
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,860
And that's the one life as the Engineer on Hoodoo guys.

70
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,860
Thank you so much for watching, I really appreciate everybody that views the videos.

71
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,860
Take care everybody, I'll see you all soon. See you later.
