00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,500
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Gonna be playing tonight as the Soldier, the Black Box Soldier with the Black Box.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,500
What else would a Black Box Soldier be using?

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:31,829
Also using the buff banner and the equalizer, and this gameplay, guys, is a real testament to why you should never just let somebody cap the last point.

5
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:38,250
Look where the cart is right now. A lot of times when this cart gets to this part on the map, the red team...

6
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,250
This is on upward, by the way, forgot to mention that. This is defense on upward.

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,250
The red team, especially if they're getting rolled, will just let them cap it.

8
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:53,250
I've been guilty of this before myself, where I'll come out of the spawn, see the cart is right there, see four guys on it, and just go,

9
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,250
Okay, let's just wait till next round.

10
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:03,679
But this is not one of those gameplays. This is one of those gameplays where the whole team just was like, you know what, screw this.

11
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:10,680
We're all gonna work together. We are going to stop these blue bastards from getting on this point, and my goodness, do we do that.

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,680
And nobody really says anything. I think it's just kind of a collective mass of thoughts.

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,680
We're all just kind of telepathically telling each other, Hey, I don't want to lose this match. Let's like really try hard.

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,109
And a couple of guys switched to medic, and they do very, very well.

15
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:29,109
Guys like Switch and MLC Stealth, they're the reason pretty much why we win the game.

16
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:35,849
So I briefly want to talk about the black box and why I'm using the black box, even when there's medics on the team.

17
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:41,849
Never be afraid to equip this item if there's one, two, three, four, five, a hundred medics on a team.

18
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,150
Because all you're going to do is just help your medics heal you faster.

19
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,150
I'm going to show you guys, I'm going to go down, we'll do a slow motion to show you what I'm talking about.

20
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:56,150
This happens a little later in the game when we get more than one medic on the team, but the theory stays the same.

21
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,150
The black box is going to heal you plus 15 health when you hit anybody.

22
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:05,150
So if you have a medic healing you, you are going to be healed in combat 24 health a second.

23
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:11,330
Now that's great, but imagine this now. It takes about one second to shoot your rocket launcher, 0.8 seconds.

24
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:19,330
So if you turn a corner and there's a large group of people shooting at you, and you shoot one, two, three rockets and hit every single time,

25
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:26,330
that's plus 45 health in three seconds, which turns out to be just about 15 health per second if you land all the shots.

26
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:35,330
So let's say that happens. Now instead of 24 health a second the medic is healing you for, you are actually receiving 39 health a second,

27
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,330
which of course is way better than the 24 health a second you receive from a medic.

28
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:46,500
Because that 24 health a second is pretty slow, especially if you want to be really aggressive, especially when you're playing Soldier.

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,810
So don't rule this out so quickly because it can really keep you on the front lines.

30
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,430
So let me transition with that into why I'm using the buff banner.

31
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:04,800
Talking about keeping people on the front lines, keeping your team alert, the buff banner is the absolute quintessential item for that.

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Because as you'll see here, any time somebody blows a buff banner, every single person on the team,

33
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,800
whether it be a medic, engineer, spy, pyro, doesn't matter what class they're playing,

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:24,800
everybody wants those mini-crits, and what that does is that allows your entire team to collectively move into one spot

35
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,800
and sort of make this wall of instant death to anybody that comes near them.

36
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,800
And as you'll see in this gameplay, me and another Soldier, we get quite a few buff banners and it brings everybody to our current location.

37
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,169
So absolutely use the buff banner, the shotgun is great, but I would say for situations like this one,

38
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:48,409
or during a stalemate, the buff banner is going to help you out big time.

39
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:52,969
Getting the crit screak right there, but it doesn't really do me a whole lot, get myself killed.

40
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:55,969
I think I get maybe two people with that, pretty sure.

41
00:03:55,969 --> 00:04:00,210
But now when you start to hear this noise, when you start to hear that,

42
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:05,210
you know you really got to step your game up a little bit because look at where the cart is.

43
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,770
It is literally, if somebody sneezes on that cart, we're done.

44
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,770
So I get a heavy off guard here, he comes around the corner with his gloves out,

45
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,770
wasn't really prepared for anybody, and they end up faking him out too.

46
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,769
Watch, he thinks I'm going to come around this corner, but no, I go this way instead.

47
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,769
Get the kill on him, do a little bit of backtracking right here, don't want to get myself killed,

48
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:25,769
get lit on fire and run towards the health.

49
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:32,769
And now this is where I want to talk about the black box and medic healing thingamajigga that I was talking about before.

50
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:38,259
So keep your eye on the lower left, I'm going to slow this down a little bit, so let's watch.

51
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:41,259
Take a look, I never get overhealed during this entire time,

52
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:44,259
and look at how many people are coming around this corner.

53
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:49,259
I am able to sustain all this damage because of course I'm being healed by a medic,

54
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,259
and because of all the plus 15s I'm getting.

55
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,259
There's plus 15 there, plus 15 there.

56
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:59,259
They never get me to a point where I'm in the red, which is incredibly important.

57
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:03,569
Now obviously the counterpoint to this whole thing, the argument that people will have is,

58
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:10,569
Well, you're missing one rocket, and the only gain you're getting is helping your medic out a little bit while he heals you,

59
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:14,569
and he's going to heal you anyway, so you shouldn't really lose that extra rocket.

60
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:18,939
Now I do agree with this to an extent, but if you're on a team with a lot of people,

61
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:22,939
and the medics are going around healing everybody, you're not being pocketed,

62
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,110
then definitely yes, this is something to look into.

63
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:32,110
Now if you are being pocketed 100% by somebody, then yes, this is not really the best option,

64
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,110
but it still can work, as you saw just right there, it still works very well.

65
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,540
And to be completely honest with you, I probably should have switched rocket launchers at this point,

66
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,540
or maybe 30 or 40 seconds before this, only because I'm being pocketed right now.

67
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,540
But as you can see, there's not that much time left, so I figured why the hell not, I'm going to stick with it.

68
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,540
So this is going to be the end of the gameplay guys, less than 10 seconds left.

69
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,720
We push them all the way back to their spawn, and they had a chance to cap it a couple of times,

70
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:08,089
so don't ever give up. So I'll see you guys all next time, and take care everybody. See you soon.
