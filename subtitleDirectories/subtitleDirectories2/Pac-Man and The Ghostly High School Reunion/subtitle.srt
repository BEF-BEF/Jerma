1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:30,390
Honest to God, can somebody please go back to my other Pac-Man video and see if it's like the same music from like 15 years ago that they used again on that atrocity of a game that was Pac-Man the New Adventures 2, whatever it was?

2
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,649
I think it's the same music!

3
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,210
Who the fuck are these people?

4
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,210
Cersei!

5
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,090
Who are these people?

6
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,090
We were as fast as we could!

7
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,520
It sounded important!

8
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,020
No.

9
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,020
Why?

10
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,020
Why did they give Pac-Man the default anime main character voice?

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,730
Alright, who are all these characters?

12
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,730
Is there an entire world of these fucking freak shows?

13
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:21,370
There's an entire world of these freak show Pac-Man things.

14
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,060
Pac-Man's like in school?

15
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,629
Remember when Pac-Man went to college, guys?

16
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:29,629
Do you remember that?

17
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:30,629
That was my favorite Pac-Man.

18
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,629
Pac-Man 3, university woes.

19
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:36,060
Yes, Mrs. Stevenson.

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,060
I would like to...

21
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,060
My homework is gone.

22
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,260
Pac-Man's like 60 years old!

23
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,629
How is he in like high school or college or whatever the hell this is?

24
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:48,629
And what the fuck is this little thing?

25
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:50,510
What is that?

26
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,510
This was...

27
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,750
Why did they make up this whole world of alien characters for Pac-Man's high school reunion?

28
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:07,099
What is this Saturday morning cartoon?

29
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,590
Is there a new Pac-Man cartoon coming out or is there one already out?

30
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,590
This is very fishy to me.

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,590
I've never seen a new Pac-Man cartoon but I feel like they're trying to push a cartoon here.

32
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,340
Yeah, there is.

33
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,270
There's a new Pac-Man cartoon.

34
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,270
It apparently came out a few months ago and I've never heard of it.

35
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,270
This whole game makes more sense now.

36
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,270
This entire game makes more...

37
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,270
Let's just fucking get back to Let's Play.

38
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,969
I highly doubt I'm going to take one point of damage through this whole video.

39
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,659
I'm going to...

40
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,659
Burger.

41
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:43,729
They have cheeseburgers in the game?

42
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:44,729
It's the best game I've ever played.

43
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:46,909
I'd like to eat it.

44
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,960
Okay, that was harder than I should have been.

45
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Alright, so here's the thing.

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,960
If I take one point of damage, then I will give stars $100 back.

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Okay?

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:10,439
Alright, can we just pretend that didn't happen?

49
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,909
I gotta send it back.

50
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:15,909
Getting your $100 back.

51
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,659
I already spent it.

52
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,039
You'll need to collect more zucchinis to play that game.

53
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,039
Oh, what?

54
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,659
I want to play the zucchini game.

55
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,659
I want to play the zucchini simulator.

56
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,659
The most realistic zucchini simulation.

57
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,289
What about this one?

58
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:33,289
Come on.

59
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:36,289
The pineapple tank game won't work until you've collected more pineapples.

60
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:37,289
Oh, fuck you.

61
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:39,289
What about this one?

62
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:42,289
Oh, the lemon game won't work until you've collected 12 lemons.

63
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,289
That lemon rocket game is fun.

64
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:45,289
Told you.

65
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:47,289
But you need to collect more lemons to play it.

66
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:48,289
Okay.

67
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:49,289
Sure.

68
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,180
Shut up.

69
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:58,250
Oh, that ice cream game is fun, but you need to collect more ice cream cones to be able to play it.

70
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,250
Nope.

71
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,159
Actually, it's free.

72
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,699
Okay, so let's talk about avoiding enemies in this game.

73
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:12,699
As long as you just move a centimeter, they will not touch you.

74
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:15,699
Let's see just how much hit detection there is in this game.

75
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,170
Where'd he go?

76
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,170
Where did he go?

77
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,170
Did he fall off and die?

78
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,480
It's okay, ghost.

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
I've done that.

80
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,220
Jeez.

81
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,990
I have like a giant ice tongue.

82
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,680
What the hell is the point of that?

83
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,110
It's much easier just clicking X on people and them dying instantly than doing a skillshot on someone.

84
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:55,250
Would you like to click on them and have them auto-lock die or would you like to use skillshots in Pac-Man the New Adventure 2 that ghastly give us adventures?

85
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,660
Hi.

86
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,660
My name is Pac-Man.

87
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,839
I hope that I'm in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

88
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,649
It's a new playable game.

89
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:09,649
Hi.

90
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,649
My name is Mr. Pac-Man.

91
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:12,649
You fucking piece of shit.

92
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:18,029
I'm trying to do like a bit here.

93
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:19,029
Hi.

94
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,029
So I'm going to say yes.

95
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,029
I'd like to meet your dentist.

96
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,029
Clyde, good to see you.

97
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,029
Look at this guy.

98
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,029
He's like perfect teeth.

99
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:27,029
Have I been turning invisible again?

100
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:30,550
Sick dentist you got.

101
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,550
Hey Clyde, what's up?

102
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,550
Hey Clyde, seeing any new Pokemon lately?

103
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,550
Because I'm Ash Ketchum.

104
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,360
Alright, I gotta get out of here.

105
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,360
I'm like freaking out that he's in school.

106
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,000
No, there he is.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Professor...

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Professor Nosehair.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hey, Professor Nosehair.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How are you?

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hey, Cersei.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,329
Actually, maybe you should get back out there.

113
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:54,329
Hey, don't get...

114
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:55,329
Don't you scold me.

115
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:57,329
You're the asshole that put like the lemon...

116
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:02,329
The minimal lemon amount and minimal pineapple amount on the arcade machines out there.

117
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,329
You're a tyrant and a scumbag.

118
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:05,329
Good day.

119
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:06,949
No, you know what?

120
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,379
Fuck you.

121
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:11,199
I'm not going to keep it PG in Pac-Man.

122
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,199
What's this robot?

123
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,199
Get out of here tin can.

124
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,269
R2-D2 looking motherfucker.

125
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:17,269
R2-D2.
