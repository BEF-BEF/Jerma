1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,960
I... I do not trust this guy being the captain of my ship.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,960
In fact, if this guy wasn't the janitor, I would leave the ship. I would get off. I would tell him to pull over.

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,250
This shit is like drawn on with crayon.

4
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,920
Well, here's the ship. There's a turret on there to shoot the bad guys.

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:42,840
We got a DirecTV in case we want to watch HBO. Another gun. And there's a... well, I've fallen into space.

6
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,549
I've fallen off my ship. I'm in space now. Can I do anything about this?

7
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:54,030
No, I don't think there's anything I can do.

8
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,000
Didn't they make a movie about this?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,120
See, right there, that's Orion's belt, right there. And up there, there's the Big Dipper.

10
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,620
See, that's the Big Dipper. One, two, three. That's the spoon part.

11
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,489
Over here we have... that's the planet that we're going to.

12
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:14,489
In this space exploration, space adventure game. It's gonna be so much fun.

13
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,489
I've always wanted to meet an alien. I've always wanted to handshake an alien and we're gonna be able to do that.

14
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:20,489
Get excited! This is gonna be the most exciting game!

15
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:38,489
This bird is not having an easy time in the rain.

16
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:44,459
This bird... it's a thunderstorm. Watch out!

17
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:52,250
I seriously don't know what to do with you.

18
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,750
I can't pick you up. I can't really do anything with you.

19
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,250
The only thing I can do is, like, help you by breaking the stone around you.

20
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,420
And maybe you'll get the idea.

21
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,420
And... I killed him.

22
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,420
Very strange things are happening right now.

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
What the fuck?

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Where's the snake come from?

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Holy shit. Okay, how do I kill it?

26
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,710
How do I kill it? I'm dead.

27
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:39,219
Found him, guys. Excuse me, sheep. I need to mine this ore.

28
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,219
Yeah. Yes, Mr. Pig. Yes, Mr. Pig.

29
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,000
Did I just get killed by a sheep?

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
God, where are these snakes going?

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,949
What are you fucking idiots doing?

32
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,460
Leave me alone!

33
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,960
And here's the dipshit that was riding on the top of...

34
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,599
I seriously wonder... I don't even know how many animals are gonna be stuck in here by the end of this.

35
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,740
But it's gonna be probably a shitload.

36
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,900
Good thing I got out of there. I wonder if he's gonna fall into a fucking hole.

37
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,020
Yep.

38
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,229
I gotta jump. I gotta jump out of here.

39
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:27,229
I can't jump. I gotta...

40
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:35,099
Oh my god, will you get out of here?

41
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,340
You need to defend yourself. Mortimer, defend yourself!

42
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,340
Turn around and start swinging!

43
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,710
Stop the snakes!

44
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,080
You were created for one purpose!

45
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,129
Here comes the captain's chair.

46
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,129
All this garbage, it took so long.

47
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:57,340
But I'm finally installing my captain's chair.

48
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,349
And then... I can go.

49
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,349
I think it's time to take off.

50
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:06,319
I think I'm ready.

51
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,939
There's no like sound. This is such a piece of shit, ship.

52
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,939
Don't cry. I crashed into a tree.

53
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,939
I crashed directly into a tree and nothing happened.

54
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:15,939
I'm just kind of spinning around.

55
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Well, here we go. I fell off the side of the planet.

56
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,819
Where do I want to go?

57
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:30,819
Oh, I'm so excited. Why am I this excited?

58
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:33,060
This has been like a pain in the ass.

59
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,000
I guess it's just slowly gonna drift this way.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,829
I don't even know what that is.

61
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:45,829
But I seem to not be going towards it for some fucked up reason.

62
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:50,360
There we go. Okay.

63
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,360
The fuck is happening? What the fuck is going on? What's happening?

64
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,970
What's going on?

65
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,970
What happened?

66
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:21,459
What the fuck is going on?

67
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:31,620
I can't... I can't...

68
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,860
I don't know what to do.

69
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,860
I don't know what to do. I have to exit the game.

70
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,860
I have to get out of here.

71
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,120
Let's go right over here.

72
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,389
What the fuck was that?

73
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:52,139
What the fuck is happening right now?

74
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,800
Whoa! What is that?

75
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,040
Hostile environment.

76
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,860
Hostile environment.

77
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
This is a pretty interesting planet.

78
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,040
You've got giraffes

79
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,540
just in the water, walking around drowning and walking on the ground.

80
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,540
And you also have three headed serpents that shoot fireballs out of their mouths.

81
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,610
Pretty interesting collection of animals we have here.

82
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:23,370
And there's an elephant too.

83
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,639
I don't know if he's upside down or right side up.

84
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,519
I honestly could not tell you.

85
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,139
Okay, looks like he was upside down.

86
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,850
Looks like a monster hunter.

87
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,329
He just shot himself in the face.

88
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:41,639
Done. Did it.

89
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,819
But I'm going to fall out now.

90
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,819
My guy is just... I didn't want to weld that on the back of the fucking spaceship

91
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:50,319
and I can't take it off.

92
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,230
I'm gonna fall out.

93
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,009
No, shit.

94
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:02,310
That's so unsafe. Why would anybody do that?

95
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,310
Why would you ever do something like that?

96
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,310
And now goodbye.

97
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,259
No wait, it might land.

98
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,009
I'm not a scientist.

99
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,009
I don't claim to be an engineer or anything, but

100
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,009
I have to beg the question.

101
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:16,009
If this 5,000 pound piece of space equipment

102
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:19,009
is floating this slowly back to the surface,

103
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,439
shouldn't I, as like a 140 pound meat bag,

104
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,439
be able to jump and swim to the next planet?
