00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,039
Hey, what's up, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,440
tonight, I'm gonna be playing as the Engineer. The title, I'll explain the title in a second,

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,480
but I'll give you the loadout. The loadout is gonna be the Strange Frontier Justice,

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,079
the Wrangler, and the Strange Wrench. Now, this gameplay is not the best in the world.

5
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:34,020
I don't even think I make it onto the leaderboard, but that's not why I made the video. I made

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,939
this video to show you guys the Parade of Traveling Engineers. Now, what the hell does

7
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:44,119
that mean? What is a Traveling Parade of Engineers? Well, as you will see, I'm gonna cut around

8
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:48,719
in this gameplay. This is not really a gameplay to show you massive kill streaks and stuff

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,219
like that. There's a lot of funny things that happen in this, so I really just had to make

10
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,479
a video on it. So, this is Badwater. This is the last point on Badwater, and as a lot

11
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,439
of you guys know, there are two great places for Sentry Guns here. One across the way,

12
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,840
as you see to the right, and over here on the left. So, take a look at this Engineer

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,359
right here. So, I say, all right, this is fine. We know two Sentries, whatever, we'll

14
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:16,379
deal with it, and then, hey, yo, well, hello. We now have three Sentries over here, and

15
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:21,659
the right side is bare. And I decide, I say, okay, this can't happen. I have to try and

16
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,560
do a risky maneuver. I grab the Sentry and make a run for the right side. I end up getting

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,549
over there unscathed. Fast forwarding about 40 seconds here, and as you'll see, the Sentry

18
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,390
is built up to level three, and I have a dispenser here now. So, I'm okay. I got the

19
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,750
Wrangler, pull it out, deal with a pesky soldier, and things are looking up. You know, they're

20
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,489
almost at the point, but I got a good Sentry here, got a good position. I'm not worried

21
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:57,349
about a thing. And then, here comes the Travelling Parade of Engineers with their two Sentries

22
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:04,599
in the same spot as mine, and I go, okay, I'll help you build it, and let me get me

23
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,219
out of here. Quick, quick, go, go, go, go. I try to get over to the other side again,

24
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,500
the side where I just was less than a minute and a half ago, and so now there's a sniper

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,000
shooting at me, and I'm freaking out trying to jump all over the place and crouch and

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,939
stuff because I don't want to get killed. So, less than 10 seconds go by, and look what

27
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:24,639
happens. This dude comes over, drops one right next to mine again, and this is where I kind

28
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,139
of just give up. I say, whatever, we'll do a double defense. I'm not going to sit here.

29
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,819
I'm not going to bring my Sentry all over the place. There's four Engineers on the team

30
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:39,979
now, so if you take a look over there, I go, oh, uh, whatever. And this is the part of

31
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:45,379
the gameplay when things all fall apart, and I just start to turn on my Troll Mode. Now,

32
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:49,419
not on my own team, of course. I'm talking about the other team. I start to build Sentries

33
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:55,240
in just odd places, places that could be really easily destroyed, taking out my shotgun, trying

34
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,060
to get some crit shots into people, and I actually do get a pretty good one coming up

35
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,460
here. So, this is Troll Sentry number one. I think this is actually the one and only

36
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,300
Troll Sentry in this particular gameplay, so I bring it up here, trying to get it in

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,300
a spot where it'll guaranteed kill anyone that walks up to there, and remember, I have

38
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,460
the Wrangler, so it's just me being a real jerk, being a real bastard, just shooting

39
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,599
people with the Wrangler as they walk by, smack that spy a couple of times, get the

40
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,020
kill on it, and then look at this. Look at the traveling parade of Engineers over here.

41
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,840
I just, I want to briefly explain to maybe some of the newer guys that don't know what

42
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,659
I'm talking about, but the reason why that is a bad idea is if an Uber Demoman comes

43
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:39,539
around that corner, it's only going to take him probably five seconds to destroy every

44
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,819
single building over there, because you've got to remember, it only takes three stickies

45
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:49,120
to destroy a Level 3 Sentry gun, and the Demoman in his sticky launcher has eight stickies,

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,139
so all he really has to do is turn that corner and just start, boom, boom, boom, just spamming

47
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:59,319
stickies all over the place, and he will take out everything. So a good rule of thumb

48
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,879
is to always stay at least ten, maybe fifteen feet away from the nearest Engineer and his

49
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,639
Sentry gun. Now I know that sometimes that really just is not possible. The situation

50
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,939
you just saw earlier is a great example of that. If there's at least three or four Engineers

51
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:18,300
on a team, you're going to be sharing space with people, but if you can at least make

52
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,000
a conscious effort to stay as far away from each other as possible, you're just giving

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,860
your team a better chance of victory. So this Sentry goes down, not big surprise. Oh,

54
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,579
Heavy cameo right there. Thanks a lot, Heavy. I appreciate it. You are very welcome. Apparently

55
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:41,839
the Heavy is General Grievous from Star Wars. That was a terrible Heavy impression. You

56
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:49,120
got anything else for us, Heavy? I am going to add your Engineer wrench to my collection.

57
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,480
What the hell am I doing right now? Like I'm recording this and listening back to it. What

58
00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:02,259
am I doing? Anyways, get the nice revenge shot on that Medic and I see that this Engineer

59
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:06,459
has built up a wrangled Sentry and I'm going to do something about it. So right when he

60
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:10,060
goes to repair it, I'm watching him, watching him, there he goes. I run at him. He must

61
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,019
have been like, what the hell are you doing? Get the kill on him right there, but his Sentry

62
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:19,819
obviously turns around and blows me to hell. So this is the end of the gameplay here, guys.

63
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,259
Got a Sentry built up in overtime and it kills a few people, but that's not the reason why

64
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,439
I'm showing you the end here. I don't get on the leaderboard like I say, but there's

65
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,240
one little clip here at the end where I shoot a Demoman that sticky jumped across the map

66
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,199
and I was laughing so hard. I thought it was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen.

67
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,439
So this is going to be the end of the gameplay here, guys. Thank you so much for watching.

68
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,689
I really do appreciate it and I will see you guys all next time. Take care, everybody.
