00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,669
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, Mondays edition.

2
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:21,649
Playing as the Demoman. Hold on. Needed to kill somebody.

3
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:30,190
Playing as the Demoman on King of the Hill Badlands. This place is bad. Bad, bad, bad.

4
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,189
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, okay. Don't freak out here. It's just a sentry.

5
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:50,039
And it's gone. Oh, oh, oh my god. Thank you, my goodness. That was... What the hell is going on?

6
00:00:50,039 --> 00:01:05,329
Oh my god. I'm speechless right now. There was just three big sentries, I think. One up there, one down, and one to the right.

7
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:20,200
Holy crap. That jar lag. Wow. Oh my god. Okay, good to know. Good to know. We're getting beat. Help me.

8
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:30,780
Oh man, I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna burn out. This is gonna be a sad death. Where's the health?

9
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:44,090
I'll thank every single god that exists for this medic. Get that guy. Where is this sentry now?

10
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:57,420
Is it still over here? It's right there. That thing's going away right now. See you later, sentry.

11
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,730
Another one. You guys are relentless with the sentry guns. At least I got the point.

12
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,859
Oh, by the way, everyone was telling me in the last couple videos, they said,

13
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:13,860
Jerma, your room is an absolute mess. So I do agree with you, so I'm gonna clean it for you right now.

14
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:30,139
Just a pair of scissors. We don't need those. Let's see. Some kind of disc. This is an expensive camera.

15
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:37,620
Oh! You see, I just made somebody gasp. Somebody just went, Jerma! Okay, we just lost.

16
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,669
You know what happens when you lose? You do it again, and you win this time.

17
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:57,289
Should I stay, Demoman? That's the real question. Hmm. How many Demo- What do we have? I'm staying. We only have one. It's me.

18
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:03,189
Hiya, where ya doin'? Oh, I'm gonna take that sentry out!

19
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:11,509
Alright, let's actually win this time. Gotta get a victory under our belts. Come on, dudes.

20
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:20,830
How did I miss you? You slippery bastard! Oh my- Get the hell over here!

21
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:29,099
Somebody, you know what? Someone's getting crushed with this. I'm going to crush someone.

22
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:34,099
I'm mad right now. I'm mad. Bro.

23
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:37,099
Wow, this is- I can't believe I'm actually still standing here.

24
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:43,860
Not this time! Alright, at least I got the point. At least we got the point.

25
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:50,939
Oh, this engineer. No, let me kill him! I need to get the kill! No!

26
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:57,780
God, okay. Oh, and welcome to FaceCamp Fortress 2, where Jerma runs around in circles with the-

27
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,860
Okay, there we go. Good, good, good. Good. Get that kill.

28
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:09,939
That engineer's not gonna build anything in that room. Not while I'm on my watch.

29
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:14,240
I try to say, not on my watch, and I say, not while I'm on my watch.

30
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,939
Not exactly sure what those words would mean together. That was actually like a literal phrase.

31
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:24,689
Not while I'm on my watch. Oh, you bastard.

32
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:31,509
Finally. I landed a shot on somebody.

33
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:38,149
Ugh! Alrighty. Get outta here.

34
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:42,709
Let's get a long range shot right there. That would've been sick. Too bad I didn't get it.

35
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:49,410
Oh! Baby!

36
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:55,569
Come on, somebody stumble outta there. Somebody stumble on outta there.

37
00:04:55,569 --> 00:05:05,170
Oh, that's how you smash!

38
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,899
That guy turned the corner and just got absolutely decimated.

39
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:15,959
Oh, that's one way to lose.

40
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,329
Anything up here? No. Spy, though.

41
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:23,170
Perfect opportunity right here for one of these.

42
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,060
Oh, never mind!

43
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,060
Everything in that room is going down right now.

44
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,230
I'm just going to lob stickies into that window and just absolutely kill everything.

45
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,899
You ready? Are you ready for this? I hope you're ready for this.

46
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:48,480
Oh, that medic is a brave soul. What a brave bastard.

47
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Swinging away with his bone saw. In a room full of people and a sentry.

48
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,480
I commend you, good sir. But you, on the other hand, whatever.

49
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,680
You know what? He can keep his pride. It's time to destroy everything in that room.

50
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:11,089
Oh, I got one guy. Oh, come on. Get in that room. Get in that room.

51
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:14,259
Oh, there it is. Sentry down.

52
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:19,339
And big heavy up. Big heavy dead.

53
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:23,860
Anything else in this room that I should be aware of? Yes, there is.

54
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,860
Anything else I should be aware of here? Look at all this carnage.

55
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,220
I wonder what happened in there.

56
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,629
Keep him closed off. Keep him closed off.

57
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,069
Yeah! That's going to be it.

58
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:42,439
Cool. Top rack.

59
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,439
13 points as a demo, man. Blink.

60
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,439
I promise I'm not going to kill you. I promise.

61
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,060
Oh, you walked away from one taunt kill into another one.

62
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,439
But I didn't get it.

63
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,439
Alright, we'll do one more life and then I'm going to close it up.

64
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,000
One more life as a spy.

65
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,560
And what we're going to do here is actually very, very important.

66
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,930
Alright? I'm going to try to not kill anybody.

67
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,930
I just want to blend in.

68
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,230
I just want to be on blue team. That's all I want.

69
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,600
But first I want to kill this medic.

70
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Okay, now I want to just blend in.

71
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,740
Alright, here we go. Ready?

72
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,360
Not going to try not to kill anybody.

73
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,860
Just want to pretend that I'm on blue team.

74
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,670
Alright, guys. We got to get on that point.

75
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,300
Alright, yeah. We got it. Sweet deal. Awesome, dudes.

76
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,240
Alright, we got to cap this. Come on, guys.

77
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,930
Cap it.

78
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,740
Alright, nice job, you guys. We did a good job here.

79
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,740
I commend both of you guys.

80
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,920
Got to get that sentry up, man.

81
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,920
I don't want to get backstabbed by any spies because I'm a sniper, you know.

82
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,480
Aw, I got to snipe.

83
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,939
Get that stuff up.

84
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:52,560
Come on, let me zoom in here.

85
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Got to be careful.

86
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,990
All kinds of things can happen right now.

87
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,550
You know, this guy...

88
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,730
If I...

89
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,350
You know what?

90
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,660
I'll see you guys all next time.

91
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,660
Of course.

92
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
And...

93
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,290
Oh, well.

94
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,290
I was going to end it by...

95
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,290
That was funny.

96
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,910
But you know what? I guess I'll end it from right this.

97
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,910
From right this, yeah.

98
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,910
One.

99
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,910
And...

100
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,910
Two.

101
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,910
And...

102
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,909
Three.

103
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,409
Come on. Who wants to kill me?

104
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:37,289
Somebody kill me.

105
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,289
Somebody please kill me.

106
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:42,789
Oh my god.

107
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,399
You got me.

108
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,700
Alright, guys.

109
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,700
That's going to be it.

110
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,700
I will see you guys all next time.

111
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,700
And of course, take care, everybody.

112
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,700
Time to clean my room.

113
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,879
Let's go.
