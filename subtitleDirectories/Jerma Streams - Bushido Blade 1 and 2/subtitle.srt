1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:13,449
So I wasn't going to start streaming for like another couple minutes, but I just, my brain went into autopilot and I tweeted that the stream was live and then I went, oh fuck, oh, oh, oh, and I just pressed live.

2
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:18,649
I wasn't planning on it. I just did it early. I did the tweet first.

3
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:30,230
And look, I know, I know, but just link your Twitter to Twitch and it'll just do a tweet. I don't want the robots taking over my accounts. Sorry.

4
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:47,109
I don't want any, I don't want any, then it like goes into your Twitter and it like reads your tweets and sends them to Bezos. Where do you think they go?

5
00:00:47,109 --> 00:01:08,950
What do you think his toilet reading material is? Anyways, the app is not letting me see the screen. My tweets. Yeah, just mine.

6
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:19,400
Anyways, we're going to play. Hey, first of all, hi, welcome. We're going to play Bushido Blade. I think I'm saying that right.

7
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,829
Bushido Blade and maybe Bushido Blade 2. It depends on if I can even get past the second enemy in this game.

8
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:37,870
This is a classic. This is an old favorite of a lot of people. This game is different from some of the other games you may have played.

9
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:45,299
At least it's kind of a fighting game, but it's different because if you get hit once, you die.

10
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,989
And if you hit somebody else, they die in one hit, typically.

11
00:01:51,989 --> 00:02:04,170
So that with that in mind, is this the first or second one is the first one, but I also have the second one right next to me.

12
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:11,979
And I know I've been told because I played this game when I was 12 or something of 13.

13
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:18,610
And I just didn't get it. And I hated it. I think I've rented it. And I was like, this game sucks. This is stupid.

14
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,849
I don't like this because you just die in one hit and I had no idea what was going on.

15
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:33,060
But now as an adult, I understand that what's going on. So I'll be ready.

16
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:43,430
But to jump on the thing I was just saying, this game, the second one is apparently just a better version of the first game, but I got them both.

17
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:51,110
That's what I've been told. Anyways, welcome. Hope everyone's having a good day.

18
00:02:51,110 --> 00:03:02,030
I'm still trying to figure out. So as of tomorrow, I'm probably going to do. I don't know. I have to get ready to leave.

19
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:07,400
I have to leave. If you weren't here last night, the Halloween stream is not happening in Vegas.

20
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,969
I'm going on location for that special stream. Should be a lot of fun.

21
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:20,270
So if there is a stream tomorrow, it's going to be short, like probably less than a few hours.

22
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:27,099
Oh, you just nailed it right there. That one one guy. Jackbox done.

23
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:32,530
Jackbox tomorrow for like two, three hours, four hours. Done. Easy. Perfect.

24
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:39,379
And that just shit just came out. Yeah. Yes, I did it.

25
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:53,349
Anyways, here we go. Classic video games. Just shoot a blade. I'm ready to attempt. Here we go.

26
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:59,419
There are other modes in this game, but I don't. I mean, I'm just saying just baptism by fire.

27
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:05,900
What do you think? I'm just going to go POV mode.

28
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,900
Well, we could. We have to do the POV mode after I figure out what the hell I'm doing.

29
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:28,699
OK, so. All right, I'm going to do this. I think I'm going to be this guy.

30
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:38,660
What weapon do I want to use? Tana. I don't even know what any of these are.

31
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,089
Is it? OK, wait, broadsword. That sounds pretty good.

32
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:48,220
Broad sword. Minecraft sword. Yeah. Hammer.

33
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:55,779
OK, I'll do the hammer. Is this the fucking hardest thing to use?

34
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,779
That's not even. What is this thing? It's a sword. I'm holding it by the blade.

35
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:07,519
There's no subtitles. Pay attention.

36
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,819
This is really a secret society of assassins called Kagei.

37
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:20,120
Everyone who knew was sworn to secrecy.

38
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:28,120
One person broke the code of silence and escaped into the ruins of a deserted castle

39
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,579
in search of the only way out through the castle tower.

40
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:41,490
I should have picked the broadsword.

41
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,490
We actually do get subtitles.

42
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:05,220
OK, it's time for me. It's kind of like a fighting game, but it's not really a fighting game, but it is.

43
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,220
It just is. All right, here we go. How do you play?

44
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,459
Wait, he got hit. You mirror hammer. I didn't hit him?

45
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:24,459
Dude, the hammer sucks. All right, hit him in the head.

46
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,459
Got him.

47
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,139
All right, I did it. I got him in the head like three times.

48
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,959
This is supposed to be one hit kill. What am I doing?

49
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:48,660
You crushed his face in.

50
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
Oh, shit. OK, round two.

51
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Fight.

52
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,100
OK, so Serpa looks like a... You have a blade.

53
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,100
This is not even a sledgehammer. This is a stick with two bells on it.

54
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,339
She hit me with the flat end.

55
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,339
Oh, she hit me with the flat end. I'm fine. Oh, shit.

56
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,970
Oh, my God. That's pretty brutal, actually.

57
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,850
Sledgehammer is actually pretty good.

58
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:36,639
So is this still level one? It's a war hammer. Aren't war hammers shorter?

59
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
All right, no message.

60
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
No, no, don't do it. I'm bleeding out of the leg.

61
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,170
Oh, God. Oh, God, please. Don't do it.

62
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,009
Head. Hit in the head.

63
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:04,379
Come on, I'm just going to crush head.

64
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,819
OK, L1 is one.

65
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:14,300
All right, I'm going to do a running circle.

66
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Oh, I would have had it.

67
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,920
No!

68
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,899
A lot of coward. I'm just being tactical.

69
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:30,899
Oh, damn it. Why am I not dying?

70
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,899
What? Are they using practice swords?

71
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:39,389
I'm dead.

72
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Continue.

73
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,299
Easy mode. No, this is on hard.

74
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:58,539
OK, is there a block? Triangle is like a quick one.

75
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:02,169
OK, square is a little parry.

76
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,039
All right, I get it.

77
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,250
Yeah, square is like a...

78
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,620
Yeah, I got you.

79
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:29,610
I could both find legs.

80
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,779
I got really banged up legs.

81
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:43,179
Yeah, one hit weapon master. All right, here we go.

82
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I got to get a good parry.

83
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,039
You can hit stuff.

84
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,980
I tried to run.

85
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,419
If you did that in a real fight, that would be really embarrassing.

86
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:09,419
Do I just keep all my scars?

87
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:14,419
Yeah, I'm like, oh, I don't think I can use my left arm.

88
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,710
What? He killed me. Yeah, he did.

89
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,759
Damn it. How many continues do I get?

90
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,759
OK, this is the hard boss.

91
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,220
Trying to give him a chance.

92
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,460
Get out of here. Got him.

93
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:06,340
No honor. Yeah, I know. That's the equivalent of punching the guy before the bell, but whatever.

94
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,940
Now what?

95
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
Where am I going?

96
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:26,740
I'm not controlling this.

97
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,169
What? All right, we're going down to the sewer.

98
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:38,179
Let's have a clean fight. Sure.

99
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,850
Got him. Double tap him. Get out of my way.

100
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,340
By the way, you might not be noticing the nuance there.

101
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,289
That was a parry block into a double tap.

102
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,289
Like I said, this weapon sucks.

103
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:24,659
Did I win? I win.

104
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:39,539
I remember this game. Why was this game so hard when I was younger?

105
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:42,539
I don't think I beat the first person.

106
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:52,590
All right, new character. POV mode.

107
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:59,309
I have to play honorably. OK, fine.

108
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:01,309
I do want to use... I want to use...

109
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:04,309
I'm going to use a small thing like this thing.

110
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,309
Actually, this is going to be hard.

111
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:10,309
All right, you can use the long sword. That's fine.

112
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:13,309
How much did I pay for this?

113
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:15,309
I don't think it was very much.

114
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:17,309
What's an arena?

115
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
Be honorable. Stop killing.

116
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
You have to kill...

117
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:34,480
Are you kidding me? This is actually pretty cool.

118
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:42,610
I can't even... Oh, I have to block. Get up!

119
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,610
Did I lose? I'm dead.

120
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,779
It's different in VR. It's harder in VR.

121
00:13:53,779 --> 00:14:01,200
All right, I'll get him here.

122
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:10,120
No, wait. It's a short sword, right?

123
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
What?

124
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:21,399
He fell down.

125
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,789
I was trying to hold for his head.

126
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:28,669
It looks like a Roblox game.

127
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:32,940
Continue? Why am I continuing for you?

128
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,940
What?

129
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,860
Got him instantly.

130
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,860
Wait, he's...

131
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,860
I got to see that in slow motion.

132
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,620
Watch this. Bang.

133
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,500
Nice try.

134
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,080
Go back to story mode and play honorably.

135
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,080
Well, I need to not continue for the computer.

136
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,379
All right, fine. I'm going to do...

137
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:07,379
Maybe the sled chamber was easy mode.

138
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:17,029
What's the hard weapon?

139
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:24,929
Fists.

140
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:26,929
You can't use fists.

141
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:31,980
No weapon.

142
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,980
Fist. I can't select zero weapon.

143
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,980
How about just...

144
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:42,000
How about just long sword?

145
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,450
Or katana.

146
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,450
None means I eject a disc from the tray.

147
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,899
Google how to be honorable.

148
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,899
What?

149
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:02,220
Are you guys making this up?

150
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:12,899
Hold on a minute. This is real?

151
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,899
Hold on. Did I just go through and just kill everybody?

152
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:22,649
And I wasn't supposed to do that.

153
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,460
Oh. I just...

154
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,539
I don't know. It is real.

155
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:30,539
Okay, hold on.

156
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:32,539
Fight with honor.

157
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,779
Don't be careless.

158
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:52,779
How do I fight honorably? Honor the code.

159
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,779
Don't strike opponents in the back.

160
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,779
Don't throw dust at people.

161
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,779
Don't strike opponents while they're lying down

162
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:08,779
or attack opponents before the start of the fight.

163
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,779
Which I did every time.

164
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,950
If any of these dishonorable acts take place,

165
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,950
the story will end in the middle of the playthrough.

166
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,950
The screen will display a message

167
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,950
and berate the player for his cowardly act.

168
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,579
What?

169
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:30,170
So what can I not do?

170
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,170
No stabbing in the back.

171
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,410
Don't throw dust and don't...

172
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,410
I don't attack while they're lying...

173
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,410
Alright. I got it.

174
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,529
Don't hit them while they're down.

175
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,529
Am I trying to win?

176
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:51,799
What am I trying to do here?

177
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,470
Fight with honor.

178
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,750
Be honorable.

179
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,750
Is stabbing in the back a win?

180
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,180
In terms of a deserted castle,

181
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,180
in search of the only way out...

182
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,180
I'll do it.

183
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,180
...to the castle tower.

184
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,180
One hit is actually dishonorable.

185
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,180
Maybe this is why I didn't understand it.

186
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,180
I still don't understand it as an adult.

187
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,180
I returned this game to Blockbuster.

188
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,180
Okay. So I'm just going to stand

189
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,180
if somebody falls down.

190
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,180
But what if they trip?

191
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,000
I didn't know there was a dust throw button in the game.

192
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm probably going to accidentally do it

193
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and ruin the playthrough.

194
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,220
I don't even know the move set for this thing.

195
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,220
I should have done hammer.

196
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
Alright. Here we go.

197
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,220
Don't attack.

198
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,220
We're ready.

199
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Come on.

200
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
I can't just run in there and stab.

201
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
It's not so easy now, is it?

202
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Oh. Come on.

203
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
I like it.

204
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:35,109
Was that dishonorable?

205
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:37,109
You're doing a backflip? That's showing off.

206
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:48,390
The block.

207
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:56,579
What? You did a backflip and I did a backflip

208
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:58,579
and then you slit my throat.

209
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:00,579
Can't win with honor.

210
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,579
Yes, I can.

211
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:04,579
Shit. Kill me. Kill me. I didn't mean to do that.

212
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,660
Kill me.

213
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:17,960
You need to kill everyone without dying.

214
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,960
That's not going to happen.

215
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,390
Okay. Here we go.

216
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,390
I don't like this weapon.

217
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,390
Give me a fucking break.

218
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,390
This weapon sucks.

219
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,390
I need my hammer back.

220
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,779
This is probably the weapon I picked when I was 12.

221
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:41,779
And I was like, this is stupid.

222
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:52,009
Can't play without the...

223
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:54,009
My inputs didn't...

224
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:56,009
I'm not going to make a complaint about inputs.

225
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:58,009
Nope. That's an automatic

226
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:00,009
you suck moment.

227
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,009
My inputs weren't even... Oh, you said the word

228
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:04,009
inputs. Automatic.

229
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,009
I don't listen to the next three words.

230
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:14,650
That wasn't an instant kill, but yours is.

231
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,539
Input equals dishonorable.

232
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:24,539
I don't like this move set either.

233
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,539
Somehow I died.

234
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:28,539
Somehow I think I killed myself with the sword.

235
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,970
How?

236
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,970
What?

237
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,140
The fuck? I can't do it.

238
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,140
Honorable. No, I can't do it.

239
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,140
No, I can't do it with this weapon. This weapon sucks.

240
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,140
That's not going to kill?

241
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,980
Easy. Is running dishonorable?

242
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:56,779
I didn't run technically.

243
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:01,000
How would... I stabbed you in the fucking face.

244
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Okay.

245
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,559
Don't stab me in the face.

246
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:14,019
Don't stab me in the back.

247
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:18,890
Dishonorable.

248
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,890
That wasn't the back. Okay, I hit you three times.

249
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,250
That wasn't the back.

250
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,250
I hit her three times with the same sword

251
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,250
that she's using, and I died with

252
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,740
one hit.

253
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,740
What kind of bullshit, dishonorable

254
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,740
bullshit is that?

255
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:43,859
Get out of here.

256
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:45,859
What'd I do?

257
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:48,230
That wasn't dishonorable, right?

258
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,460
Just use a different weapon.

259
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,460
Yeah, but I've already beat the first boss.

260
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,170
A skilled opponent can insta-kill

261
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,170
without... Did you pay attention?

262
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,170
The title of my stream is

263
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,170
you can one-hit in this game.

264
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:16,009
What?

265
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:24,299
I tried to do the backflip.

266
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:29,240
No, it's not hammer time. Actually, I want to do the training.

267
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Hold on.

268
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:37,319
Okay, R1 is a different stance.

269
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,690
I actually like this stance.

270
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:46,869
Nice block.

271
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:52,440
Got it.

272
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,809
I got right into the intestines.

273
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:01,289
That dishonorable stance.

274
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:15,109
There's no such thing. I like that stance.

275
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,980
Okay, here we go.

276
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,980
You're not going to get anywhere just by

277
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,980
the ball spinning.

278
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,740
Got a little stab there.

279
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:36,259
Bang.

280
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:39,589
I didn't even...

281
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:42,730
I didn't need to try. That was really easy.

282
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:52,099
I don't... Five of shit.

283
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,099
Don't... Is he going to make that... You going to make that thing now?

284
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,730
Okay.

285
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,289
Change stance.

286
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:07,460
Good block.

287
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,460
What happens now?

288
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:19,660
Is it like a race?

289
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,660
Who hit the ground first? Oh, come on.

290
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,759
No, kill me. I didn't even swing.

291
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,759
You're hitting me when I'm on the ground.

292
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,759
Holy shit.

293
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,759
That was really

294
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,759
dishonorable.

295
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,759
Oh my god.

296
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,759
That's like

297
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,759
dialed to 11.

298
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:48,599
I thought you said not to hit

299
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:50,599
people on the ground. What do you mean you can do that?

300
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,779
No, you can't.

301
00:25:57,579 --> 00:25:59,579
Oh, shit.

302
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:01,579
What came out of me?

303
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,000
How did I drop? Did I drop like

304
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,880
loot?

305
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:21,500
Okay.

306
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,119
I've been honorable so far.

307
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,940
We're going to jump down in the

308
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,940
sewer.

309
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,880
Take me the long way. I'm going to just jump in.

310
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:38,859
This is the sewer of honor.

311
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:43,220
Okay.

312
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,220
Oh, shit. Let me get out.

313
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,220
Aw, where's the honor?

314
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,220
My legs are broken.

315
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,220
Is this honorable?

316
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,029
Step on his fingers.

317
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:07,029
Shit.

318
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,349
Get up.

319
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:17,349
Oh, dishonorable.

320
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:19,349
You punk.

321
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:21,349
No, get away from me.

322
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:25,559
No, let me get up.

323
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:29,019
There's no honor in what you're doing.

324
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:40,220
Get away.

325
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,220
Get away from me.

326
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:48,470
Get away.

327
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,470
This is not even...

328
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
I'm just

329
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,680
sick of my shit at that point.

330
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,680
I think I did some dishonorable things.

331
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Prepare.

332
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,680
I'm prepared.

333
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Let's end this.

334
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
He's wearing body armor.

335
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,680
How much health do you...

336
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,680
What the fuck?

337
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Should I not have done that if you stabbed

338
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
when they're dead?

339
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,099
Is that all right?

340
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:31,099
Is that okay?

341
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:40,549
I really hope that's not

342
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:47,720
a problem.

343
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
This looks like a gun.

344
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Wait.

345
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
A gun?

346
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Why do you have a gun?

347
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,990
Play honorably.

348
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,990
Shoot gun at somebody.

349
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,359
Are you kidding me?

350
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,359
Can I block it like a Jedi?

351
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,359
What?

352
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:36,009
God damn it.

353
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:45,509
Is this God?

354
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:47,509
Get the fuck out of here.

355
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
I can't block the bullets.

356
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Is it dishonorable?

357
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
I can't attack before he gets his text out.

358
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
I can't attack before he gets his text out

359
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
and I can't move.

360
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Prepare.

361
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,910
Prepare.

362
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:16,500
Prepare.

363
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,450
Take it easy.

364
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,450
Don't die.

365
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,259
Don't die.

366
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,259
Take it easy.

367
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:32,259
Don't die.

368
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:34,259
Don't die.

369
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:39,460
I just, I know I've listened to somebody in the chat, but I'm running at the guy with the gun.

370
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,019
See you later.

371
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,779
Okay, does the next person have an assault rifle or something?

372
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,549
He fight a tank. Now that would be funny.

373
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:28,170
Easy. He's got a, he has the Darth Maul thing. I don't know what they're called. Yes, I know. It's a called actually something, but it's not as known by Darth Maul.

374
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,359
It's too long. It's too long.

375
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:54,619
Get over here. Oh no, don't, don't hit him.

376
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,470
That's how you, I don't know. That's how you did that.

377
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,690
The back, not the back. Walk this. God damn it.

378
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:32,660
That's not a bad idea.

379
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,890
He got a little coffee. I might be his downfall.

380
00:32:49,049 --> 00:33:00,569
Who's after this guy?

381
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:04,869
All right, I'll get it now. Here we go.

382
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,559
Block him.

383
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,250
Come on, I'm in that combo.

384
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,920
Whoa, what was, damn it.

385
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:32,869
Side step the lance. I was trying for it right there.

386
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,380
Now that I,

387
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:56,859
Jesus God.

388
00:33:56,859 --> 00:34:00,859
All right, now that I've had some time to see different weapons and action,

389
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:02,859
and this is, this is an accurate accurate,

390
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,860
um, the, the lance is, that's the best weapon that's ever been invented in hand-to-hand combat.

391
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,860
You can just stand like 10 feet away.

392
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,860
It's not great, isn't it?

393
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,420
Isn't it like the best weapon ever?

394
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,639
Got it.

395
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,639
He's not, I thought he wasn't dead.

396
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,639
He was doing what I was doing, making jokes out of this whole thing.

397
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,639
Running around in circles.

398
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,349
Where did I go?

399
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:41,349
Did I, I just jumped out of frame?

400
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,750
Oh.

401
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,750
Oh shit, that was actually pretty bad.

402
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,750
That was scary.

403
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:04,860
Fucking spammer.

404
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
Here we go.

405
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:15,099
Block.

406
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:20,039
Oh shit.

407
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:24,969
Oh, damn it.

408
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:27,590
Switched.

409
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,340
The burger boy technique.

410
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,340
It's not a bad technique.

411
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:46,949
Oh, don't. I was trying not to stab him in the back.

412
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:50,219
Cause that's dishonorable.

413
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:54,219
Lifted up her left arm to dodge that somehow.

414
00:35:54,219 --> 00:36:00,679
I'm going to go for a dab.

415
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:03,750
Holy shit.

416
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:13,619
Once they get cocky, that's when we go in.

417
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:17,619
I'm going to try to go for the other side.

418
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:22,679
Right here.

419
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,360
Shit.

420
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,860
We're getting into this though.

421
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,860
Counter attack.

422
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,860
We're getting into this though.

423
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,860
Counter attack.

424
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,860
After you block, you can't do anything for a second.

425
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:59,000
Okay, you get like a spin super move.

426
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,949
Where did you get that from?

427
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:06,949
I don't have one of those.

428
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,750
Helicopter attack.

429
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,630
Zangief.

430
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,630
Yeah.

431
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:31,800
This is not my kind of weapon.

432
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
It's like you're giving me a weapon.

433
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
I'll try.

434
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,809
I'm not changing stances.

435
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:42,809
I feel like that's bad right now.

436
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,570
Can you skip the replays? I can, but don't you guys want to see?

437
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:53,000
Yeah, after this I want to learn some actual techniques.

438
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:57,559
So let's see if I can complete the game without knowing anything.

439
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:05,699
How is your sword sharper than mine?

440
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:10,380
Are the directional inputs? Probably.

441
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,380
Because it looks like, hold on, let me see.

442
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,380
If I go down and like forward and...

443
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:23,349
I wasn't even looking at the screen.

444
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:25,349
I was looking at my controller.

445
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:33,369
I was like, wait, down and...

446
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:43,739
That's the secret.

447
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,739
Hahaha.

448
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:47,739
No.

449
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:51,739
I could have just ran and just slashed.

450
00:38:57,739 --> 00:38:59,739
Right in his stomach.

451
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,420
He was like, please.

452
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,420
Please poke my stomach.

453
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,760
I did it.

454
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Full motion video cutscene.

455
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:39,940
Wait, what are you talking about?

456
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:06,300
I have to go.

457
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,789
Now I'm all alone.

458
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:08,969
We're going to go into training.

459
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,969
Just curious, because I need to learn this for the next game.

460
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,969
And I have to pick a weapon that I care about.

461
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:25,929
Also, some maps you have to exit the map in a specific area mid-fight, really.

462
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:31,000
Going quality build, something like that.

463
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,590
Okay, so let's see.

464
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,590
So, circle.

465
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,590
You can do double dare.

466
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,590
What if I go like down and...

467
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,590
What if I go backwards?

468
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,590
Forward circle.

469
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,590
Forward circle.

470
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,590
So there's a double tap there.

471
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,590
X has...

472
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,590
Forward and X.

473
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,590
Down and X.

474
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,590
Back, X.

475
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,590
Up, X.

476
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,590
Forward, X.

477
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,590
Double tap, back, X.

478
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:18,730
I have to beat a hundred enemies in slash mode without dying to unlock the guy with the gun.

479
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,030
I wonder if, like, how about triangle, like circle?

480
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,030
Like circle, triangle.

481
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,719
Because that's locked.

482
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,719
Clearly.

483
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:45,190
Tap.

484
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,190
I mean, yeah, some of these don't tap.

485
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,690
I actually like holding like this.

486
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,690
Baseball stance, yeah.

487
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,690
You are really slow.

488
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,300
I'm trying to do those, like you guys say, directional and like a fucking...

489
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:15,190
Like, lower stance with R2, I think.

490
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:21,190
Oh shit, yeah, you can do high, mid, and low.

491
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:25,559
Damn, okay.

492
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:27,989
That's good to know.

493
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,059
Game is too loud.

494
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:38,489
I can't hear you.

495
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:40,489
Alright, sorry, I didn't know.

496
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:43,239
This is the first time music's been in the game.

497
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:45,239
Alright, how do I get out of this?

498
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:49,210
How do I get out of...

499
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:53,449
Check the game manual?

500
00:43:53,449 --> 00:43:57,449
Yeah, I would have to go online for that because this did not come in the manual.

501
00:43:57,449 --> 00:43:59,449
Alright, kill me, so I want to go to the slash mode.

502
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:06,989
Start, select, yeah, that's what I've been doing.

503
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:13,489
How about...

504
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:15,489
Start, select.

505
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:17,980
Select, start.

506
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,980
Start, select, and shoulder buttons.

507
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,019
Holy shit, you do have to press everything at the same time.

508
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:30,019
Okay.

509
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:32,019
Movie.

510
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:34,019
What is slash mode?

511
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:43,050
Let's see what that does.

512
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,130
Mikado.

513
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,130
I guess we have to do the katana.

514
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,579
I guess I can't pick.

515
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:55,579
Eat slash mode on hard without continuing.

516
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:58,340
Let's see how impossible that is.

517
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,340
We want cheats, we want cheats.

518
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,980
On it doesn't matter here.

519
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,219
I just think steamroller.

520
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,530
Alright, bring this down.

521
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:22,559
Bring this sword down, there we go.

522
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,559
Ooh, that's a good, I like that.

523
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:28,059
Okay, a hundred of these?

524
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:32,150
I mean, they are pretty dumb.

525
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,980
Although...

526
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:43,719
I actually don't like this weapon.

527
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:46,539
But I have to use it.

528
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:57,139
Okay.

529
00:45:57,139 --> 00:45:59,139
Nope, he's alive.

530
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:02,920
Good.

531
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,920
We're going to try that technique a hundred times.

532
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:13,159
Don't kill me.

533
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:15,159
Alright, I broke his arm.

534
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,619
Good.

535
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,619
Okay, I think I can do this.

536
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:23,619
Holy shit, he must...

537
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:25,619
Thank god.

538
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:31,440
Don't block, don't kill me.

539
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:41,630
Did I just headbop him?

540
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:55,460
No, they get harder.

541
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,460
Oh boy.

542
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,460
Good thing I blocked that.

543
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,460
Oh, I'm dead. I got to nine.

544
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:08,500
You have to do that a hundred times, holy shit.

545
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
Wow.

546
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,250
It's just a gauntlet mode.

547
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,250
And you have to get to a hundred.

548
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,250
I can imagine getting to 99.

549
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,940
And hating myself.

550
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,619
Because I'm about to be lost.

551
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,980
Give him one more try.

552
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,340
We both did the same thing.

553
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,719
What is honor?

554
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:47,719
I don't need honor.

555
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:50,090
I'll go...

556
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:54,989
I'm just helping this guy tumble backwards over and over again.

557
00:47:54,989 --> 00:47:57,989
How many more times do I have to do this?

558
00:47:57,989 --> 00:48:15,989
I just did the thing that you do at the arcade when you're really mad that you lost and you don't have any coins left.

559
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:17,989
You just get to fucking zero.

560
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:19,989
No one else is going to have fun.

561
00:48:19,989 --> 00:48:26,260
Let me see.

562
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,260
Bushido blade combos.

563
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,809
The mall to spam.

564
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,110
Here we go.

565
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:39,019
Move list.

566
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:41,019
I'm just curious.

567
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:43,510
General moves.

568
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,510
Square.

569
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:47,510
Square R2 is roll backwards.

570
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:51,750
Forward R2 is kneel pickup weapon.

571
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,380
Throw dirt.

572
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,380
There's a jump.

573
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,380
Forward R2 and then R1 is jump.

574
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:03,239
Hold on. You can do this too?

575
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:07,849
What happens if you do this?

576
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:09,849
Do a 100% dirt throw run.

577
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:25,269
Just use cheat codes.

578
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:29,940
Can I use the gun guy?

579
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,690
4.5 kilogram sword.

580
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,309
Throwing dirt is BM but it's lots of fun.

581
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:46,309
Let me try this.

582
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:48,309
And then we'll move on to Bushido blade 2.

583
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:50,309
Because Bushido blade 2 is just Bushido blade 1 but better.

584
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:52,309
With more stuff.

585
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:54,869
The gun guy is only available in two player mode.

586
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:56,869
Oh shit. Well...

587
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:02,710
Uh oh. That's not true.

588
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,710
Is it not true?

589
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,710
Oh shit.

590
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,710
It's literally worse.

591
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,659
It's worse.

592
00:50:13,659 --> 00:50:17,690
I think it's worse.

593
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:19,690
Don't play 2.

594
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,690
I already bought it.

595
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,690
I'm not going to not play it.

596
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,519
It's right here.

597
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:32,889
What do you want me to do?

598
00:50:32,889 --> 00:50:35,829
Recycle it?

599
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:49,400
Let's see.

600
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,400
Stop. I'm trying to boost dishonorable too.

601
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,400
Forward R2 R2.

602
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,000
Forward plus R2 and then R2.

603
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:06,650
Let's try it again.

604
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,829
Oh. There it was.

605
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:15,909
Kind of. Forward R2.

606
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:22,119
Uh. It's not working.

607
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:24,119
Forward R2 R2.

608
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:26,119
Forward R2 R2.

609
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:28,119
Forward R2.

610
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:30,119
It looks like he kneels down for a second.

611
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:38,869
Forward R2.

612
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:42,869
And then R2 is throw dirt.

613
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:45,750
Because forward R2 is kneel.

614
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,750
So when I kneel down I should...

615
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,750
Some moves are weapon dependent.

616
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,820
Oh shit.

617
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,900
This is one of the general moves.

618
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,389
Don't hit your opponent

619
00:51:58,389 --> 00:52:00,389
when they're lying on the ground.

620
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:02,389
No whacking your opponent in the back.

621
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:04,389
Don't slice your opponent when they're climbing a wall.

622
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:06,389
No beheading your opponent before they are ready.

623
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,389
What do you mean beheading your opponent before they're ready?

624
00:52:08,389 --> 00:52:10,699
No blinding your opponent by throwing something at them.

625
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:12,699
Dirt and snow etc.

626
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:21,960
Oh here we go. Hissou moves.

627
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,960
Looking for the rip here. There it is.

628
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,329
Okay. Triangle

629
00:52:26,329 --> 00:52:28,329
from high stance.

630
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:33,260
Is this a high stance? What am I doing?

631
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,750
It looks like I'm juggling.

632
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:38,119
Okay.

633
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:41,130
Slash. So.

634
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,130
Here we go.

635
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:48,699
Circle circle.

636
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,699
X. Okay.

637
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:52,699
Middle stance. Let's just check it out. I need to learn this stuff.

638
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:56,860
Alright. Now let's get a big one.

639
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:01,269
Oooh.

640
00:53:01,269 --> 00:53:03,690
Here we go.

641
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:06,179
Let's try it.

642
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:12,739
Nice.

643
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:14,739
Go back to the thing.

644
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:16,739
I already beat the thing. I can't throw that twice.

645
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:20,900
The last four hours of that game

646
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,900
was dog shit.

647
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,900
I don't want to do that again.

648
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:35,019
Play the game again

649
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:37,019
but do it backwards.

650
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:39,019
What do you mean put the controller backwards?

651
00:53:39,019 --> 00:53:41,019
No.

652
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:43,019
Alright. Pursuit of Blade 2 is going in in just a minute.

653
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:45,769
I gotta have the...

654
00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:48,010
Alright. Hold on.

655
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:50,010
Forward X. Circle. Triangle.

656
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:52,630
I'm gonna try this.

657
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,449
Forward X. Triangle. Triple slash.

658
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:07,159
Ah.

659
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:09,159
It's gonna be the same game but worse.

660
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:16,179
Will it?

661
00:54:16,179 --> 00:54:18,619
Alright. It's going in.

662
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:21,429
I'm taking the bandaid off.

663
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:24,309
Let me try to do this one thing.

664
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:26,309
Am I in the wrong stance?

665
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:29,769
Yeah, I am.

666
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:36,250
Alright. Fuck it.

667
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:42,840
Take the second disc and snap it.

668
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:47,380
Alright.

669
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,380
I'm gonna be really upset with you guys if Pursuit of Blade 2

670
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,380
is much better.

671
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,690
If this game is really, really fun

672
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,690
and I love it, I'm gonna be upset.

673
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,690
Because you guys tried to get me to like

674
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:07,739
break it. It's actually

675
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:09,739
awful? No.

676
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,739
It can't be. The first one is fun

677
00:55:11,739 --> 00:55:13,739
and interesting and cool. How would the second one be worse?

678
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:17,639
I guess this...

679
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:19,639
Yeah. Hold on. That's true. The sequel could be

680
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:25,849
always worse.

681
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:31,420
We're gonna try it though. Is it not

682
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:46,969
registered? There it is. People talking shit

683
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,969
about Dark Souls 2 are people who can't

684
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:50,969
beat Dark Souls without shields or sorcery.

685
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:55,050
What?

686
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:59,780
What does this have to do with anything?

687
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,750
It has nothing to do with what we're doing.

688
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,750
Just had to

689
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:15,420
get it off his chest.

690
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,420
The one guys are on a roll tonight.

691
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:24,329
Yeah, they are.

692
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:28,170
Oh, it's an example of a worse sequel.

693
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:43,210
I see where you're going. Is this the only

694
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,210
thing I'm gonna be doing tonight?

695
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:53,019
Probably not.

696
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:55,019
Because I can imagine this is probably gonna be like another

697
00:56:55,019 --> 00:56:59,239
hour or so for this game.

698
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:01,239
And I do have Siren, but

699
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:03,239
should I start Siren after this?

700
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:05,239
That might be a mistake

701
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:07,239
because it's a long game.

702
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:09,239
And I'm gonna disappear as of tomorrow.

703
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:21,269
Dead Rising?

704
00:57:21,269 --> 00:57:23,269
No, no. I wanna...

705
00:57:23,269 --> 00:57:25,269
No, I can't. No.

706
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:27,269
That's gonna be a string of at least

707
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:29,269
a couple of streams in a row.

708
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:36,309
You just disappeared for

709
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:38,309
a week. Well, this is to set up the Halloween stream.

710
00:57:38,309 --> 00:57:41,320
Because I'm traveling for the Halloween

711
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,320
stream. If you didn't know, I'm going to the East Coast to do it.

712
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:59,900
Am I gonna play horror games

713
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,900
after Halloween? Probably not.

714
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,840
There are like one or two that I'd

715
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,840
like to do, but we've done

716
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,840
a lot of scare games.

717
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:13,130
Horror Thanksgiving.

718
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:24,889
Oh, okay.

719
00:58:24,889 --> 00:58:26,889
I was gonna say I can't read this.

720
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:39,420
Alright, hold on.

721
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,420
Master your weapon. Let's do this.

722
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:48,710
Practice. Train with the ninja.

723
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:50,710
Adjust the ninja's fighting pattern by pressing...

724
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,710
Okay. Yeah.

725
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:59,880
There's a lot of secret characters in

726
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,880
this one.

727
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:10,500
I wanna be...

728
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:15,690
I guess I'll be you.

729
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:21,900
Spear? I'm doing spear.

730
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:26,889
Oh, and you can do Tatana, whatever.

731
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:34,949
The longer, the better. That's right.

732
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:44,679
Frontal attacks.

733
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:47,300
Off, off, off. Okay.

734
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,250
So.

735
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:54,539
Holy shit, this thing is huge.

736
00:59:54,539 --> 00:59:56,539
Alright, so square has changed the

737
00:59:56,539 --> 00:59:59,420
stance of this one.

738
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,909
Alright.

739
01:00:01,909 --> 01:00:03,909
I feel like I don't have to do anything with this.

740
01:00:03,909 --> 01:00:06,519
Do a swipe.

741
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,519
Oh, wow.

742
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:10,519
Okay, so X.

743
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:12,519
I can go bang, bang, bang.

744
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:17,340
Is there no blood in this one?

745
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:24,889
The stage doesn't look finished.

746
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:26,889
It's just a training stage.

747
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:30,150
This is lame. No blood.

748
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:33,030
Hold on.

749
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,030
Since there's no longer a parry button,

750
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,030
in Bushido Blade II,

751
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,030
you must learn to use the attack buttons to parry.

752
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:42,230
Oh.

753
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,230
Is this why everyone doesn't like it?

754
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:46,659
When the opponent attacks

755
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:48,659
with X, hit O

756
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:50,659
just before the attack. When the opponent

757
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:52,659
attacks with circle, hit X to counter.

758
01:00:52,659 --> 01:00:55,610
Okay.

759
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,610
Well, that's good to know that there's no parry.

760
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,610
Like, a parry button.

761
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:03,610
God, I love spears.

762
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:05,849
No blood. No blood.

763
01:01:05,849 --> 01:01:08,860
No blood.

764
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,860
There's an actual dedicated jump button, though.

765
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:23,030
Alright, that's pretty cool.

766
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:25,340
Oh, that's sick.

767
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,769
Oh, yeah. Oh, two is

768
01:01:27,769 --> 01:01:29,769
way better than one.

769
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,699
Alright, I think I can do it.

770
01:01:36,699 --> 01:01:39,369
But there's the whole other thing called rebound attacks.

771
01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:48,119
When an attack hits the opponent's weapon,

772
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:51,190
a pink flash will appear.

773
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,190
When this happens, both the attacker and the defender

774
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:55,820
can follow up with a rebound attack.

775
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:57,820
So if you're attacking and this happens,

776
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,820
you press circle.

777
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,820
Okay.

778
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,820
Okay.

779
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,820
When this happens, you press circle.

780
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:09,059
If you're defending,

781
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,059
if I'm hit, it's X.

782
01:02:11,059 --> 01:02:13,059
There it is.

783
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:18,309
Where am I reading this?

784
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:20,309
In the game's online

785
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:22,309
manual.

786
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:29,349
That's cheating. I'm reading the game's

787
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:31,659
manual. Alright, weapon clash.

788
01:02:31,659 --> 01:02:33,659
When two attacks meet, a weapon clash will occur.

789
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:35,659
A weapon clash has three phases.

790
01:02:35,659 --> 01:02:39,420
Yay.

791
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,420
Neutral, advantage, and overpowering.

792
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,420
In any phase, is this just a spam button?

793
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:45,420
Like, press it as fast as you can?

794
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,420
In any phase, either player

795
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,420
must hit the attack buttons more quickly than the

796
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:51,420
other in any order to gain the advantage.

797
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,420
I win. I will never lose

798
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:56,940
one of those. Okay.

799
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,940
So now,

800
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:03,269
what's this thing called?

801
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:05,269
It's not called the spear.

802
01:03:05,269 --> 01:03:07,269
Oh, there it is.

803
01:03:07,269 --> 01:03:09,510
Okay.

804
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:12,519
I'm ready.

805
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:24,860
Top menu.

806
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,860
Story mode. Here we go.

807
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:28,860
You can do POV story mode. That's kind of insane.

808
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:40,679
Insane.

809
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:47,050
800 years ago.

810
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:49,050
100 years ago.

811
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,340
It's kind of hard to read.

812
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:07,780
Was honor in this game too?

813
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,780
How does honor work in this one?

814
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,420
There's nothing on

815
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:31,420
Bushida Blade 2's honor system.

816
01:04:36,329 --> 01:04:38,329
There is no honor in Bushida Blade 2.

817
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:43,190
Why would they do that?

818
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,300
You actually cannot fight honorably or you lose.

819
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:05,349
Cave on the left.

820
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:21,639
Okay.

821
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:23,639
So, I'm going to just do the same

822
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:28,949
thing?

823
01:05:28,949 --> 01:05:36,949
I think I have a good understanding of what's going on.

824
01:05:36,949 --> 01:05:42,969
I'm on Tutorial Island.

825
01:05:45,269 --> 01:05:47,269
Moisac.

826
01:05:57,929 --> 01:05:59,929
Who's talking to you?

827
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:11,179
What?

828
01:06:11,179 --> 01:06:13,179
I'm speaking from above in the

829
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:15,179
rafters.

830
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,179
I could just come down and meet you.

831
01:06:17,179 --> 01:06:19,670
But, holy shit,

832
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:21,670
worse than one.

833
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:23,670
Look at that fucking fake virtual fighter

834
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:26,099
blood.

835
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:32,739
How do you do that?

836
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:38,570
He'll never win one of those.

837
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:40,570
It'll never happen.

838
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,510
Right in the head.

839
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:53,510
Oh, what?

840
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,510
That was right in the head.

841
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:07,030
You probably shouldn't have

842
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:09,030
did that, but it's okay.

843
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:11,909
How many times do I have to do this

844
01:07:11,909 --> 01:07:16,260
to prove myself?

845
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:18,570
I'm going in with

846
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:20,570
the slide thing.

847
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:23,639
Nice.

848
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:25,639
Can I?

849
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:34,010
Alright.

850
01:07:46,059 --> 01:07:48,059
By the way, Dad, can we get some furniture

851
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:50,059
in the living room? The echo is

852
01:07:50,059 --> 01:07:52,059
really, really fucking strong.

853
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:05,030
Instantly got him.

854
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:07,780
Wait, we're going again?

855
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,409
You'll never win.

856
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,949
Oops.

857
01:08:22,949 --> 01:08:24,949
He broke my arm, but it doesn't matter.

858
01:08:24,949 --> 01:08:26,949
I can do this with one hand.

859
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:28,949
Oh shit, one handed.

860
01:08:28,949 --> 01:08:30,949
Right in the face. Just let him walk into it.

861
01:08:30,949 --> 01:08:32,949
He'll walk into it.

862
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:37,130
Spare is the best weapon.

863
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:55,399
Okay, for a second,

864
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:57,399
I thought he was standing up.

865
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:04,060
I was like, oh, my arm is still broken.

866
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:10,020
That was a smart play.

867
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,430
See ya.

868
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:21,430
I'll never understand that stance.

869
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:23,430
The stance we're both doing.

870
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:29,529
Why hold your hands up?

871
01:09:29,529 --> 01:09:31,529
The vital organs are like in your armpits.

872
01:09:31,529 --> 01:09:33,529
If you get slashed in the armpits...

873
01:09:43,449 --> 01:09:45,449
What?

874
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:52,390
Oh.

875
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:54,390
Good to see ya again.

876
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:59,020
I do doubt ya.

877
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:02,729
Not gonna pull a gun out on me, are ya?

878
01:10:02,729 --> 01:10:08,100
He's like...

879
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:13,350
He's dressed.

880
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:15,350
Wait.

881
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,350
It's me now.

882
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:20,600
What if I just lose?

883
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,600
Oh, you suck. You're not fast enough.

884
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:39,270
Oops.

885
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:41,270
I was...

886
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:46,020
Is he dying?

887
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:56,140
That's fucking funny.

888
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:58,140
All right, hold on.

889
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:00,699
There's a different ending, I think.

890
01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:04,279
Why did I give him the spear?

891
01:11:04,279 --> 01:11:06,279
I didn't know how to use this shit.

892
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:10,710
Here, let me see that weapon.

893
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:12,890
I have no idea how to use.

894
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,890
It can't be that hard.

895
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,890
He's just sticking with the end that's sharp.

896
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:23,590
Why would you charge a guy with a spear like that?

897
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:25,590
Mistake.

898
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:28,340
Too flashy.

899
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:31,930
Too flashy.

900
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:33,930
Just go back to basics.

901
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:40,140
Spears are seriously the best weapon.

902
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:43,399
Oh, shit.

903
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:46,279
What happens if I die?

904
01:11:46,279 --> 01:11:48,279
We're good.

905
01:11:48,279 --> 01:11:54,020
Already broke my fucking arm.

906
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:04,949
Cross it.

907
01:12:04,949 --> 01:12:06,949
There it is.

908
01:12:06,949 --> 01:12:08,949
Dumb.

909
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:14,180
I didn't even do anything. He just ran into it.

910
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:16,680
Same thing.

911
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,680
I'm like a spike trap on the wall.

912
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,680
Sorry.

913
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:26,420
As long as I'm here, you won't be going any further.

914
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,420
Okay.

915
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:31,750
Why are we fighting in a...

916
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,750
Oh, hold on.

917
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,750
Why are we in a parking garage?

918
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:37,750
I'm just realizing this right now.

919
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,750
Weren't we like 800 years ago?

920
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,750
Wait.

921
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,750
This is 800 years ago.

922
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:46,310
What?

923
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:49,189
What?

924
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:56,810
I can't even...

925
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:58,810
Okay, let's go.

926
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:01,239
You gotta start back here.

927
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:03,239
Right there.

928
01:13:05,239 --> 01:13:07,239
Boom.

929
01:13:07,239 --> 01:13:09,239
Triple combo.

930
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:12,500
They're LARPing in a parking lot.

931
01:13:20,819 --> 01:13:31,899
That guy's just died.

932
01:13:31,899 --> 01:13:33,899
Live action roll.

933
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:36,899
They actually added a person with

934
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:38,899
an assault rifle.

935
01:13:43,829 --> 01:13:47,100
Okay.

936
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,100
Parking garage's assault rifle.

937
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:55,260
She blocked my sword with the gun.

938
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,260
And then shot me.

939
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:01,539
Of course.

940
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:15,140
Kill, kill, kill, kill.

941
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:17,140
Kill, kill, kill.

942
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:19,140
Kill.

943
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,140
She was missing me at point blank.

944
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:23,140
Get her.

945
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:27,180
Oh my god, she's so bad.

946
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:29,180
Kill her.

947
01:14:51,289 --> 01:14:58,890
Ugh.

948
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:03,109
The eye died.

949
01:15:03,109 --> 01:15:07,529
The eye died.

950
01:15:07,529 --> 01:15:09,529
Stewie grimace.

951
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:16,220
Ha ha ha.

952
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,220
This sounds like

953
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:20,220
me. I was gonna say

954
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,220
I do this voice a lot for

955
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,220
Nuke.

956
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,220
I do this voice a lot.

957
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,220
It's coming to me. Fist punch.

958
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:30,220
I do this one all the time.

959
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:34,180
Can you really handle a sword?

960
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:36,180
No.

961
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:41,689
That's why I use a spear.

962
01:15:41,689 --> 01:15:46,550
Die.

963
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,550
Let's do a whirlwind attack.

964
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:50,979
Ooh, got him right in the

965
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:52,979
toe.

966
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:54,979
He doesn't have honor anymore.

967
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:01,670
Bring it up.

968
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:05,060
Let him walk into it.

969
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,060
Bingo.

970
01:16:11,689 --> 01:16:17,579
You giddy.

971
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:19,579
A sword made for the sole purpose

972
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:24,569
of revenge.

973
01:16:24,569 --> 01:16:32,949
It sounds like Michael Jackson.

974
01:16:32,949 --> 01:16:34,949
Pretty good.

975
01:16:34,949 --> 01:16:36,949
You've made it this far without losing your breath.

976
01:16:36,949 --> 01:16:40,890
Oh, Utamaro.

977
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:43,060
I mean like, exactly.

978
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:45,060
Damn.

979
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,060
You've outdone me again.

980
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:50,310
This is nothing.

981
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,310
Besides, it's not

982
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:56,220
over yet.

983
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:58,220
Yeah, undoubtedly.

984
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,220
Unless we sever the enemy's bloodline, we won't reach

985
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:02,220
our true goal. Where's your weapon?

986
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:04,220
Vengeance to settle this prolonged

987
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,970
hatred? Revenge

988
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,970
is nothing to do with me, but I suppose

989
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:11,140
it can't be helped.

990
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,140
Well, I suppose I'll

991
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:15,140
help you. You can pay me back

992
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:17,140
later. Hear me?

993
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:28,279
I'll go on ahead.

994
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:33,529
Okay.

995
01:17:33,529 --> 01:17:35,529
This is called the Tartar Shrine

996
01:17:35,529 --> 01:17:37,529
path. Wait, what?

997
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,960
Why does he keep changing characters on me?

998
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,520
Wait, what?

999
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,819
Bring it down.

1000
01:17:46,819 --> 01:17:49,640
Bring it straight in.

1001
01:17:54,329 --> 01:17:56,329
Oh, that guy got

1002
01:17:56,329 --> 01:17:59,210
fucking destroyed.

1003
01:18:03,449 --> 01:18:05,449
Oh, what happened to your arm?

1004
01:18:05,449 --> 01:18:07,449
You okay?

1005
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:11,220
Something wrong?

1006
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:13,220
Oh, got it.

1007
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:16,810
Again, we go. Okay. Let's go down.

1008
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:27,180
Oof.

1009
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:29,670
I felt that one.

1010
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:33,130
I've been looking for a good challenge.

1011
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:35,130
Oh, yeah.

1012
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:37,130
I've been looking for a good challenge.

1013
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:39,130
Oh, yeah.

1014
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:41,130
I've been looking for a good challenge.

1015
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:48,170
I've been looking for a good challenge.

1016
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:50,170
I've been looking for a good challenge.

1017
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:52,340
Oh, yeah.

1018
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:54,340
I'm only Matsumushi and I'm just passing through the area.

1019
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,340
Why are you holding onto your hair?

1020
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:58,649
I might not be worth your effort.

1021
01:18:58,649 --> 01:19:00,649
That's what I do. I do that. I get it.

1022
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:03,460
Down you go!

1023
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:05,460
Take that!

1024
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,460
Take that!

1025
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:09,460
Take that!

1026
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:15,739
Take that!

1027
01:19:15,739 --> 01:19:18,739
Take that!

1028
01:19:18,739 --> 01:19:20,739
Take that!

1029
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:22,739
Take that!

1030
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:25,180
Low. Can I do it low?

1031
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:28,060
Okay. Sweet.

1032
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,060
Take that!

1033
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:33,109
Take that!

1034
01:19:33,109 --> 01:19:35,420
Die! Take that!

1035
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:37,420
Come on, you can do better than that.

1036
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:39,420
Got it. One more.

1037
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:42,470
Down you go!

1038
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:44,470
Take that!

1039
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:46,470
Take that!

1040
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:48,470
Die! Take that!

1041
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:53,270
I'll leave the rest up to you.

1042
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:56,470
So, alright.

1043
01:19:56,470 --> 01:20:06,520
I go back to me?

1044
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,340
No, me.

1045
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:12,729
That was a good damage hit.

1046
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:15,659
That was a good damage hit.

1047
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:19,220
Do it again.

1048
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:22,039
Do it again.

1049
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:24,039
Swing it down.

1050
01:20:24,039 --> 01:20:26,039
Swing it down.

1051
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:28,600
And...

1052
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,970
Oh!

1053
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:33,270
His arm.

1054
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:35,270
I love that combo.

1055
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:37,270
I love that combo.

1056
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:39,829
What?

1057
01:20:39,829 --> 01:20:42,970
What?

1058
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:48,140
What?

1059
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:50,699
What?

1060
01:20:50,699 --> 01:20:52,699
Oops.

1061
01:20:52,699 --> 01:20:54,699
Don't.

1062
01:20:54,699 --> 01:20:59,109
Don't.

1063
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:03,510
Don't.

1064
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:05,510
I do like the fact that they give you these little...

1065
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:08,010
Hold on. Let me just instant one of those.

1066
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:11,260
Hmm.

1067
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:13,260
Hmm.

1068
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:16,199
Hmm.

1069
01:21:16,199 --> 01:21:18,199
There's a little, like, fist bash at the end of that.

1070
01:21:18,199 --> 01:21:20,199
Oh.

1071
01:21:20,199 --> 01:21:24,039
Oh.

1072
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:26,600
Bring it down.

1073
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,600
I like the down.

1074
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,600
Gives you the opportunity to get killed.

1075
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,600
Because you get too greedy and do the same thing.

1076
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:38,550
Hmm.

1077
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:41,479
Already broken arm.

1078
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:43,479
Already broken arm.

1079
01:21:43,479 --> 01:21:45,479
Already.

1080
01:21:45,479 --> 01:21:48,170
Right in the chest.

1081
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,539
Right in the chest.

1082
01:21:50,539 --> 01:21:56,090
Get it!

1083
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:59,350
Get it! Come on!

1084
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:01,350
No!

1085
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:04,149
They're getting smarter.

1086
01:22:04,149 --> 01:22:08,760
Hmm.

1087
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,760
Why am I killing these people? I really have no idea.

1088
01:22:23,829 --> 01:22:26,199
What the fuck?

1089
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:30,039
What's that weapon?

1090
01:22:30,039 --> 01:22:32,409
Hold on. Your weapon's cooler than mine.

1091
01:22:32,409 --> 01:22:34,409
You got, like, the ten cards in the iPad game

1092
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,409
that are my weapon and then I pay, like, four dollars

1093
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:38,409
and it upgrades into that one.

1094
01:22:38,409 --> 01:22:40,579
I want that one.

1095
01:22:40,579 --> 01:22:43,720
Hmm.

1096
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:52,069
Hmm.

1097
01:22:52,069 --> 01:22:54,699
Ooh, that would've been a great counter.

1098
01:22:54,699 --> 01:22:56,699
So would that.

1099
01:22:56,699 --> 01:23:06,659
You could've chose it in the beginning.

1100
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:09,220
I stick with what I have.

1101
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:11,220
Oh my god.

1102
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:13,529
She just took out my whole entire thing.

1103
01:23:13,529 --> 01:23:15,529
Zorax, whatever it's called.

1104
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:19,050
No, that's an ant.

1105
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:21,050
That's like an ant's body.

1106
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:23,050
The thing in your throat.

1107
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:30,250
Hmm.

1108
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:33,130
You're long, too.

1109
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:35,130
So it's fair. I don't like this.

1110
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:38,010
The larynx. There it is.

1111
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:42,010
Oh, I tried to do, like, the scoop

1112
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:44,010
but I couldn't get you with it.

1113
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:47,399
I'm too slow.

1114
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:56,020
Right in the middle.

1115
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:58,460
What are you doing?

1116
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,460
Excuse me.

1117
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:03,449
What?

1118
01:24:03,449 --> 01:24:06,140
That was fucking stupid.

1119
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:08,140
You would cut your hands up so much.

1120
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:10,140
Alright, let's end this.

1121
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:18,329
You got too cocky.

1122
01:24:18,329 --> 01:24:22,420
The end is near.

1123
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:34,520
Always without the weapon, too.

1124
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,340
You just find a new one.

1125
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,960
I suggest you give up.

1126
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,960
The Naru Kagami have protected the Kagami lineage

1127
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,960
for a very long time.

1128
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,960
I cannot allow you to make an end of it.

1129
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:55,300
Okay.

1130
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,430
Uh, I guess what?

1131
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:05,430
The guy has magic powers.

1132
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:13,430
Okay.

1133
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:27,079
Okay.

1134
01:25:27,079 --> 01:25:29,770
I think I have to counter him.

1135
01:25:32,069 --> 01:25:34,069
Yeah, I have to counter him.

1136
01:25:38,819 --> 01:25:40,819
Alright, I have to wait until he attacks

1137
01:25:40,819 --> 01:25:42,819
and then counter him.

1138
01:25:44,819 --> 01:25:48,979
How the fuck do I do this?

1139
01:25:48,979 --> 01:25:51,220
Why would I see that little flash?

1140
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:53,659
I gotta counter it.

1141
01:25:53,659 --> 01:25:55,659
So, like, wham.

1142
01:25:55,659 --> 01:25:57,659
And...

1143
01:25:57,659 --> 01:25:59,659
counter.

1144
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:05,539
Maybe he'll run out of mana.

1145
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,680
Damn it.

1146
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:29,939
He's running out of mana.

1147
01:26:29,939 --> 01:26:31,939
His teleport gets shorter and shorter.

1148
01:26:31,939 --> 01:26:34,250
For real?

1149
01:26:43,529 --> 01:26:45,529
He's probably in, like, a false insecure...

1150
01:26:45,529 --> 01:26:47,529
Alright. That was a pretty cool move,

1151
01:26:47,529 --> 01:26:52,970
but...

1152
01:26:56,279 --> 01:26:59,079
How did that not hit him?

1153
01:26:59,079 --> 01:27:01,770
Fuck.

1154
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:06,500
It looks the same. Yeah.

1155
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,500
No, I'm gonna have to counter

1156
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,500
or something.

1157
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,500
Like that, but...

1158
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:28,710
How's that for magic powers?

1159
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:30,710
Oh!

1160
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:32,710
Damn it.

1161
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:34,710
Come on. How did I miss him?

1162
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:48,340
I, like, grazed his ear.

1163
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:51,609
He blocked it on the ground.

1164
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,600
He's blocking them on the ground.

1165
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,609
How are you doing that?

1166
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:03,609
Alright, low.

1167
01:28:13,689 --> 01:28:23,220
Get over here.

1168
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:28,590
That was... I parried and countered.

1169
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:30,590
What happened?

1170
01:28:40,689 --> 01:28:42,689
This is a nice boss theme.

1171
01:28:42,689 --> 01:28:46,020
Yeah.

1172
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,640
The crickets and the owl

1173
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:52,100
stand perfectly still.

1174
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,710
Why would I do that?

1175
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:10,819
Alright, I'm gonna try to block.

1176
01:29:10,819 --> 01:29:14,470
Okay, he swings. I'm gonna swing with circle.

1177
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:17,859
And then hit X.

1178
01:29:19,859 --> 01:29:21,859
No, it was...

1179
01:29:21,859 --> 01:29:23,859
That was X.

1180
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:29,380
Only attack when the owls hoot.

1181
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:39,829
Do something!

1182
01:29:39,829 --> 01:29:41,829
Please! Do anything!

1183
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:48,520
I mean, he's...

1184
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,520
He's almost like he's too far away to counter.

1185
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,819
I like... Hold on.

1186
01:29:56,819 --> 01:29:58,819
I like the... Hold on.

1187
01:29:58,819 --> 01:30:00,819
Let me try this again. He's on the ground.

1188
01:30:00,819 --> 01:30:02,819
I just have to, like, sweep the ground.

1189
01:30:11,609 --> 01:30:13,609
I googled it.

1190
01:30:13,609 --> 01:30:15,609
You need to hit him enough times so he teleports next to you, then...

1191
01:30:15,609 --> 01:30:21,939
What?

1192
01:30:21,939 --> 01:30:23,939
Hit him enough times until he teleports next to you?

1193
01:30:23,939 --> 01:30:25,939
And then stab him?

1194
01:30:31,909 --> 01:30:35,300
Okay, hold on.

1195
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,300
Is he getting closer?

1196
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,300
Did I hit him or did he hit me?

1197
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,300
I can't tell.

1198
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:58,060
Oh, come on.

1199
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:00,060
Come on.

1200
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:03,260
Come on.

1201
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,260
He's definitely not getting closer.

1202
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,260
Are we sure?

1203
01:31:12,569 --> 01:31:14,569
I need to, like, this one.

1204
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:16,810
Because then I can just go, stab, run.

1205
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:22,810
Kick him.

1206
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,810
How do you kick?

1207
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:27,430
Google says he gets closer.

1208
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:29,430
If you get stuck on this, you can play the first one again.

1209
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:31,609
What? Kick.

1210
01:31:33,609 --> 01:31:36,789
What's the kick?

1211
01:31:36,789 --> 01:31:38,789
This jump. What if I jump?

1212
01:31:43,479 --> 01:31:45,479
You have to hit him until he teleports

1213
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:47,479
next to you, then kill him there.

1214
01:31:47,479 --> 01:31:49,479
So, yeah, I was doing it right.

1215
01:31:49,479 --> 01:31:51,479
He definitely is getting closer.

1216
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:53,479
There's no way he's not.

1217
01:31:53,479 --> 01:31:55,479
Yeah, he is.

1218
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,840
He is.

1219
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,840
He is.

1220
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,840
There he is.

1221
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,840
Don't you fucking

1222
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,840
dare.

1223
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:14,840
Okay, now?

1224
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,840
Don't fucking die.

1225
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:27,210
God damn it, he did kill

1226
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:29,210
my god.

1227
01:32:40,069 --> 01:32:42,069
You're a real pain in the ass, do you know that?

1228
01:32:56,949 --> 01:33:05,140
Don't you dare.

1229
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:07,140
Alright, that's a good one. That's a good one.

1230
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:09,140
I like this one. It's more defense.

1231
01:33:17,289 --> 01:33:19,289
Don't do the third

1232
01:33:19,289 --> 01:33:21,289
attack. It's not worth it.

1233
01:33:21,289 --> 01:33:23,850
Alright, I countered

1234
01:33:23,850 --> 01:33:25,850
and parried and he went further away.

1235
01:33:28,729 --> 01:33:30,729
No, please, please, please, please.

1236
01:33:30,729 --> 01:33:32,729
No, stop it.

1237
01:33:32,729 --> 01:33:34,729
He keeps, like, sidestepping me.

1238
01:33:37,289 --> 01:33:42,149
Why is he getting further away?

1239
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:51,130
Oh, shit, he's right behind me.

1240
01:33:54,199 --> 01:33:56,199
You...

1241
01:33:56,199 --> 01:34:01,189
Oh, come on.

1242
01:34:03,189 --> 01:34:05,189
Oh, come on.

1243
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:16,060
So you have to do that until he is

1244
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:18,060
actually right next to your body.

1245
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:22,060
Is this the boss of the game?

1246
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:38,170
Swing the spear instead of poking him.

1247
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:40,170
But look at how vulnerable I am.

1248
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,729
This is stupid.

1249
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:10,340
Oh my fucking god.

1250
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:13,350
Just throw sand at him?

1251
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:28,020
Alright, here we go, come on.

1252
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:30,020
Okay, cool.

1253
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:32,020
Fun.

1254
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,329
Great.

1255
01:35:38,329 --> 01:35:40,500
Okay, fun.

1256
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,500
This is fun.

1257
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,500
Oh my god, okay, he can't be doing it

1258
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,500
that many more times, right?

1259
01:35:54,869 --> 01:35:56,869
Fuck, you don't...

1260
01:35:58,869 --> 01:36:00,869
Die!

1261
01:36:00,869 --> 01:36:02,869
Oh my fucking god.

1262
01:36:04,869 --> 01:36:06,869
Jesus Christ.

1263
01:36:08,869 --> 01:36:11,109
Oh, he...

1264
01:36:13,989 --> 01:36:19,100
Have I actually hit him once?

1265
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:27,479
No, because you have to hit him

1266
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:29,479
until apparently he teleports

1267
01:36:29,479 --> 01:36:31,479
directly next to your body.

1268
01:36:33,479 --> 01:36:35,479
Because he has to be kneeling like that.

1269
01:36:35,479 --> 01:36:37,479
Because he has to be kneeling like that.

1270
01:36:37,479 --> 01:36:39,479
And that's the only time he can be hit.

1271
01:36:43,979 --> 01:36:45,979
But he can hit me once.

1272
01:36:47,979 --> 01:36:49,979
I have to hit him like 20 times.

1273
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:54,470
Can I put him in a corner?

1274
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:58,310
No, because he teleports behind me.

1275
01:36:58,310 --> 01:37:00,310
I'm just going to do this and see what happens.

1276
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:02,310
I'm just going to keep doing this.

1277
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:04,310
Just do it the exact same way every time.

1278
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:06,310
Just do it the exact same way every time.

1279
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:16,310
I'm close.

1280
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:21,130
But he goes behind you!

1281
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:29,130
Oh my god.

1282
01:37:29,130 --> 01:37:31,130
Goddamn.

1283
01:37:36,329 --> 01:37:40,550
Do with my eyes closed.

1284
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:58,390
Okay.

1285
01:37:58,390 --> 01:38:02,489
Why? What?

1286
01:38:02,489 --> 01:38:05,619
Why is it doing that?

1287
01:38:05,619 --> 01:38:07,619
Oh, it's because my webcam's not plugged in.

1288
01:38:07,619 --> 01:38:09,619
So it's taking the last

1289
01:38:09,619 --> 01:38:16,279
frame that it captured.

1290
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:23,829
Alright, hold on.

1291
01:38:23,829 --> 01:38:25,829
Can I even plug this in? No, I can't.

1292
01:38:25,829 --> 01:38:29,479
Because I have to unplug.

1293
01:38:29,479 --> 01:38:32,489
Do I have too many USBs plugged in?

1294
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:34,489
Actually, yes, I can.

1295
01:38:34,489 --> 01:38:37,050
I can. I have to unplug my mouse.

1296
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:44,779
Okay.

1297
01:38:44,779 --> 01:38:46,779
I have too many USBs plugged in and they're all incredibly useful.

1298
01:38:46,779 --> 01:38:58,340
Shit.

1299
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:01,800
Okay. I just tried to use my mouse.

1300
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:16,760
That's not going to work. Did it work?

1301
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:19,189
No, I need my mouse. Hold on.

1302
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:25,659
I don't have any other emote

1303
01:39:25,659 --> 01:39:27,659
slots. USB

1304
01:39:27,659 --> 01:39:29,659
slots. I don't have

1305
01:39:29,659 --> 01:39:31,659
any other USB slots in my fucking

1306
01:39:31,659 --> 01:39:33,659
whole computer. Yes, I do.

1307
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:41,340
Why is the Razer app

1308
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,510
opening right now? No, I'm not going

1309
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:45,510
to install your fucking garbage software.

1310
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:54,090
Get out of here. Hey!

1311
01:39:54,090 --> 01:40:01,510
Look how red I am now.

1312
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:05,859
It's the same shirt.

1313
01:40:05,859 --> 01:40:08,300
Yeah, because it's the same day.

1314
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:10,300
It's the same day.

1315
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:12,300
It's been like probably an hour

1316
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,300
and 45 minutes since that image was

1317
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:19,670
captured. Is it desync?

1318
01:40:19,670 --> 01:40:23,239
Oh, kids. Alright.

1319
01:40:23,239 --> 01:40:25,739
I'll turn off the desync. There's no

1320
01:40:25,739 --> 01:40:30,090
desync, you liars. Oh, no, there

1321
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:32,840
is actually. You guys are not lying.

1322
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:37,500
Hold on. Sorry to

1323
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,500
really fly off the handle on that one.

1324
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,060
Okay. Now

1325
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:45,000
I'll do it with my eyes closed.

1326
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,939
This is not going to even work. Why am I doing this?

1327
01:40:47,939 --> 01:40:58,619
Okay, ready?

1328
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:17,739
Why did I

1329
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:19,739
just, I heard like five moves.

1330
01:41:27,739 --> 01:41:29,739
Why am I alive?

1331
01:41:50,329 --> 01:41:53,720
I'll sidestep that.

1332
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:55,720
This is the best way to do this.

1333
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:57,720
It is.

1334
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,720
It is. Just get away.

1335
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:01,720
Only attack if you know you have an opening to do this.

1336
01:42:10,569 --> 01:42:12,569
It's getting closer.

1337
01:42:12,569 --> 01:42:14,569
Here it comes.

1338
01:42:14,569 --> 01:42:16,569
Shit. It's okay.

1339
01:42:16,569 --> 01:42:18,569
Run.

1340
01:42:18,569 --> 01:42:20,569
Do it again.

1341
01:42:20,569 --> 01:42:22,869
Run. Do it again.

1342
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:28,010
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1343
01:42:28,010 --> 01:42:30,010
Don't!

1344
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:32,010
Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't!

1345
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:35,079
Run! Run!

1346
01:42:35,079 --> 01:42:37,079
Don't, please.

1347
01:42:39,899 --> 01:42:45,189
His armor's broken.

1348
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:13,560
I didn't even look at him.

1349
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:18,310
Oh my god.

1350
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:20,310
I got it.

1351
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:27,399
What does he have?

1352
01:43:27,399 --> 01:43:30,340
Ow, my chest.

1353
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:32,340
What does that mean? I know what it means.

1354
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:35,159
What does he have? Lego hair?

1355
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:50,710
That's not it. There's more.

1356
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:53,399
The other one.

1357
01:43:53,399 --> 01:43:56,149
You have come.

1358
01:43:56,149 --> 01:43:58,579
By orders of Shinto, I have come to kill you.

1359
01:43:58,579 --> 01:44:03,689
Yes.

1360
01:44:03,689 --> 01:44:05,689
It is the mission of your clan.

1361
01:44:05,689 --> 01:44:07,689
To take my life with your Yugiiri.

1362
01:44:07,689 --> 01:44:09,689
To end our existence.

1363
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:16,300
It was 800 years ago that our ancestors,

1364
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:18,300
the Kagami family,

1365
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:20,300
destroyed the Suede family

1366
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:27,829
and destroyed them.

1367
01:44:27,829 --> 01:44:29,829
There is only one way to have your revenge.

1368
01:44:29,829 --> 01:44:31,829
And lay this feud to rest.

1369
01:44:33,829 --> 01:44:35,829
I don't have to let go here.

1370
01:44:35,829 --> 01:44:39,220
Go ahead.

1371
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:41,220
Take my life.

1372
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:43,220
For I am the descendant of the Kagami.

1373
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:49,689
Do it. Are you going to do it or what are you doing?

1374
01:44:49,689 --> 01:45:01,590
I want to get this right.

1375
01:45:01,590 --> 01:45:03,590
I want like a full on

1376
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:05,590
baseball swing.

1377
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:13,399
Wait. Try this way?

1378
01:45:16,409 --> 01:45:18,409
There it is. Alright. Ready? So it's one,

1379
01:45:18,409 --> 01:45:20,409
two, three.

1380
01:45:20,409 --> 01:45:23,100
Just practicing.

1381
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:25,100
One, two.

1382
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:28,489
Whatever. What do you mean it's fate?

1383
01:45:28,489 --> 01:45:30,489
This endless, vigilant protection

1384
01:45:30,489 --> 01:45:32,489
so meaningless

1385
01:45:32,489 --> 01:45:34,489
of the blood of the Kagami family.

1386
01:45:34,489 --> 01:45:37,750
It can end now.

1387
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:39,750
With my death.

1388
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:42,439
And everything.

1389
01:45:42,439 --> 01:45:44,439
Do you guys really give a shit about

1390
01:45:44,439 --> 01:45:46,439
the bad end of

1391
01:45:46,439 --> 01:45:48,439
Bushido Blade 2?

1392
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:55,350
The people of Kagami fought for the Kagami family.

1393
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:58,359
And the people of

1394
01:45:58,359 --> 01:46:00,359
Suei fought for the Suei family.

1395
01:46:00,359 --> 01:46:02,359
You can run out the door.

1396
01:46:02,359 --> 01:46:04,359
I'll do it next time when I do this again.

1397
01:46:04,359 --> 01:46:06,359
Oh wait no I have to fight the teleporting guy again.

1398
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:08,359
No that's not fun.

1399
01:46:08,359 --> 01:46:10,359
There should be no shame or regret.

1400
01:46:10,359 --> 01:46:14,840
As one of the Kagami family

1401
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:16,840
was it not your destiny to fight

1402
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:19,270
until the very end?

1403
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:21,270
Sword. To fight in order to protect

1404
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:23,699
something. In the end

1405
01:46:23,699 --> 01:46:26,199
that may have actually saved you.

1406
01:46:26,199 --> 01:46:30,489
How unfortunate.

1407
01:46:30,489 --> 01:46:32,489
Watch the blade.

1408
01:46:32,489 --> 01:46:34,489
You're going to step on a rake and it's going to hit you in the face.

1409
01:46:34,489 --> 01:46:47,859
Alright how do I do

1410
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:59,619
the assault rifle?

1411
01:46:59,619 --> 01:47:06,090
Battle? How do I

1412
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:08,090
unlock assault rifle in this game?

1413
01:47:14,489 --> 01:47:18,520
You change the game first.

1414
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:20,520
No not yet.

1415
01:47:29,859 --> 01:47:32,550
Let's go with

1416
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:34,550
not broadsword. We did big and slow.

1417
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:36,550
I want small and usable.

1418
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:39,109
Not longsword.

1419
01:47:39,109 --> 01:47:41,350
It's an adachi.

1420
01:47:41,350 --> 01:47:47,300
Small streamer.

1421
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:52,020
Get that person out of here.

1422
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:54,520
I'm going to do this quick.

1423
01:47:54,520 --> 01:48:00,659
My hair has not moved.

1424
01:48:00,659 --> 01:48:03,350
Alright let me get this done real quick.

1425
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:15,050
Just wild swings.

1426
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:17,420
We're just trying to

1427
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:19,659
die like that one.

1428
01:48:21,659 --> 01:48:23,659
Okay good. Keep going.

1429
01:48:28,789 --> 01:48:30,789
That was a nice counter.

1430
01:48:30,789 --> 01:48:32,789
That was kind of cool but not cool enough.

1431
01:48:34,789 --> 01:48:36,789
Okay.

1432
01:48:36,789 --> 01:48:38,789
That's the hair from the last time his frame

1433
01:48:38,789 --> 01:48:40,789
was captured.

1434
01:48:40,789 --> 01:48:42,789
Alright now you got me looking over at the chat

1435
01:48:42,789 --> 01:48:44,789
room about my

1436
01:48:44,789 --> 01:48:46,789
Lego body. Whatever it is.

1437
01:48:46,789 --> 01:48:48,789
Why do I have two

1438
01:48:48,789 --> 01:48:50,789
headphones in? I don't need them for this game.

1439
01:48:50,789 --> 01:48:52,789
Because I need to be able to hear you guys.

1440
01:48:59,750 --> 01:49:02,890
Get it.

1441
01:49:02,890 --> 01:49:04,890
Bring it over this way.

1442
01:49:04,890 --> 01:49:06,890
Cross.

1443
01:49:08,890 --> 01:49:10,890
Got it.

1444
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:38,149
This is not accurate.

1445
01:49:38,149 --> 01:49:40,149
This is not accurate.

1446
01:49:40,149 --> 01:50:47,659
Hold on.

1447
01:50:47,659 --> 01:51:06,409
That's fine. God damn it.

1448
01:51:06,409 --> 01:51:20,810
How the fuck would you even know

1449
01:51:20,810 --> 01:51:22,810
what that is? How would you even know?

1450
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:41,109
It's mirrored so it's hard for me to do this.

1451
01:51:41,109 --> 01:52:24,500
It's exactly the fucking same.

1452
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:26,500
It looks nice.

1453
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,600
Oh look. He's got the same fucking

1454
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:58,600
Lego hair.

1455
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:00,600
Doesn't he? Same hair.

1456
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:05,699
Oh look at that.

1457
01:53:27,689 --> 01:53:36,520
Yeah fucking guess what?

1458
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,520
Lego hair

1459
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,520
looks pretty damn good.

1460
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,520
It's nice and smooth and

1461
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,520
it's styled. I'm going to kill this guy. How many lands? Watch this.

1462
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,520
One, two, three.

1463
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,520
Lie.

1464
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:50,699
German lied about Minecraft VR.

1465
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:52,699
German lied about Minecraft VR.

1466
01:53:52,699 --> 01:53:54,699
Right?

1467
01:53:54,699 --> 01:53:56,699
German's hair looks like

1468
01:53:56,699 --> 01:54:00,149
Minecraft VR.

1469
01:54:00,149 --> 01:54:07,260
Oh!

1470
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:12,250
He did the thing I wanted to do.

1471
01:54:18,970 --> 01:54:22,300
I'm not even paying attention.

1472
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:24,300
I'm supposed to be learning combos.

1473
01:54:26,729 --> 01:54:28,729
One, let's see.

1474
01:54:28,729 --> 01:54:30,729
One.

1475
01:54:30,729 --> 01:54:32,899
One.

1476
01:54:32,899 --> 01:54:34,899
One, two.

1477
01:54:34,899 --> 01:54:37,270
One, two.

1478
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:39,270
There's a two combo.

1479
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:42,409
I played the first

1480
01:54:42,409 --> 01:54:44,409
game. I already did.

1481
01:54:44,409 --> 01:54:46,409
I already beat the first game. Honorably, by

1482
01:54:46,409 --> 01:54:48,409
the way.

1483
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,920
Alright, I'm just being, I'm running and

1484
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:02,920
being violent. I need to like

1485
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:04,920
control my emotions.

1486
01:55:08,310 --> 01:55:10,310
I thought I had it.

1487
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:16,840
There it is.

1488
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:18,840
I'm not clicking any world Lego

1489
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:20,840
links.

1490
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:42,170
That's not even it.

1491
01:55:48,170 --> 01:55:50,170
Why is there a

1492
01:55:50,170 --> 01:55:52,170
green screened image

1493
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:54,170
of a balding Lego character template?

1494
01:55:54,170 --> 01:55:56,170
Why?

1495
01:55:56,170 --> 01:55:58,170
What is this for?

1496
01:55:58,170 --> 01:56:07,060
What is the application of this

1497
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:09,619
image?

1498
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:29,159
Wait a minute. No, that's just, that's gonna put

1499
01:56:29,159 --> 01:56:31,850
me in there.

1500
01:56:46,569 --> 01:57:19,100
Oh my god, it's trying to key out my green teeth.

1501
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:21,100
No, it's not. Okay, I thought I had green ass teeth

1502
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:23,590
right there for a second.

1503
01:57:23,590 --> 01:57:27,590
No, I don't have, look, I don't have green teeth.

1504
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:30,279
Wait, I'm a new character.

1505
01:57:32,279 --> 01:57:34,279
I don't, I'm done.

1506
01:57:34,279 --> 01:57:42,140
This just looks like my hair's up in a bun.

1507
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:48,409
Alright, let's see.

1508
01:57:48,409 --> 01:57:54,039
My hair's up in a bun.

1509
01:57:54,039 --> 01:57:56,039
Alright, let's key out

1510
01:57:56,039 --> 01:58:02,300
green.

1511
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:07,479
That doesn't do anything.

1512
01:58:07,479 --> 01:58:09,479
Okay, I thought I didn't grab it.

1513
01:58:09,479 --> 01:58:23,289
Oh, fuck.

1514
01:58:23,289 --> 01:58:25,289
I actually like this. This is kind of fun.

1515
01:58:25,289 --> 01:58:27,289
The trees come down.

1516
01:58:30,539 --> 01:58:35,340
That's, okay,

1517
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:37,340
that's very clearly.

1518
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:39,340
Alright, well to do this correctly,

1519
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:41,770
give me a second.

1520
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:43,770
I'm gonna do this correctly.

1521
01:58:43,770 --> 01:58:50,810
Let's see this correctly done.

1522
01:58:50,810 --> 01:59:01,180
It would actually be more like this.

1523
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:16,090
Because they have these like square heads.

1524
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:30,680
Not that way.

1525
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:42,579
Wrong image.

1526
01:59:42,579 --> 01:59:44,579
It looks like I'm wearing a fucking old like 1930s

1527
01:59:44,579 --> 01:59:47,340
football helmet.

1528
01:59:47,340 --> 02:00:36,920
This is not correct. There you go, I'm done.

1529
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:41,529
Don't say I never did anything for you.

1530
02:00:41,529 --> 02:00:43,529
Oh, do this one too.

1531
02:00:43,529 --> 02:00:53,510
I'm trying to play Bushido Blade 2.

1532
02:00:53,510 --> 02:01:02,470
Fuck this game.

1533
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:04,470
This is not, is this like, I don't know,

1534
02:01:04,470 --> 02:01:09,909
what is this? Is this supposed to be like a beard?

1535
02:01:09,909 --> 02:01:15,659
No, it's like a, what is this?

1536
02:01:15,659 --> 02:01:30,619
Where's the image?

1537
02:01:30,619 --> 02:01:32,619
There's a bald cap on it.

1538
02:01:32,619 --> 02:01:45,739
Okay, hold on. This is gonna be hard to do

1539
02:01:45,739 --> 02:01:48,939
because of this color. I have to key out this color.

1540
02:01:48,939 --> 02:01:50,939
This is stupid.

1541
02:01:50,939 --> 02:01:52,939
It's not even the same color as my like skin tone.

1542
02:01:52,939 --> 02:02:01,050
Hold on.

1543
02:02:01,050 --> 02:02:04,699
It's closing in on him.

1544
02:02:04,699 --> 02:02:07,000
Alright, I'm gonna add another key.

1545
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:12,939
Okay.

1546
02:02:12,939 --> 02:02:15,500
And it's gonna be this color. Not green.

1547
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:27,130
Custom color.

1548
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:29,130
Okay, it's this.

1549
02:02:29,130 --> 02:02:31,130
Where's my grab, my little grabber thing?

1550
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:33,560
I need to put it over there on there.

1551
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:35,930
I don't think I can.

1552
02:02:35,930 --> 02:02:41,430
Hold on, here we go.

1553
02:02:41,430 --> 02:02:43,430
Nope, not that. Wrong one.

1554
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:45,430
This one? It's like that one.

1555
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:52,090
Okay, let's see what happens.

1556
02:02:52,090 --> 02:02:57,449
Is that too similar?

1557
02:02:57,449 --> 02:02:59,449
Oh hey, oh well.

1558
02:02:59,449 --> 02:03:19,930
What, somebody made a cutout?

1559
02:03:19,930 --> 02:03:23,130
What's happening right now?

1560
02:03:23,130 --> 02:03:32,979
What is going on?

1561
02:03:32,979 --> 02:03:34,979
I don't have Photoshop open right here.

1562
02:03:34,979 --> 02:03:36,979
I mean, I've got like a stream going.

1563
02:03:36,979 --> 02:03:38,979
I've got stream labs. I've got my game.

1564
02:03:38,979 --> 02:03:40,979
I'm not like, oh let me open up Photoshop.

1565
02:03:40,979 --> 02:03:42,979
Over here.

1566
02:03:42,979 --> 02:03:44,979
That looks like, yeah, let me use the pen tool.

1567
02:03:44,979 --> 02:03:48,180
Open paint?

1568
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:50,180
I can't open paint. I'm at, I'm 600 milliseconds behind.

1569
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:55,560
This game sucks.

1570
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:57,560
I didn't say it.

1571
02:03:57,560 --> 02:03:59,560
In fact, I didn't because this one was, I actually had fun with this one.

1572
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:05,060
Why is this one all dirty?

1573
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:09,800
Why?

1574
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:24,010
This just looks like I'm wearing a hat.

1575
02:04:24,010 --> 02:04:36,739
Okay, I want to change

1576
02:04:36,739 --> 02:04:42,300
wait, color correction.

1577
02:04:42,300 --> 02:05:14,359
It just looks like

1578
02:05:14,359 --> 02:05:16,359
I have a fucking giant white head

1579
02:05:16,359 --> 02:05:18,359
as a fucking skull.

1580
02:05:18,359 --> 02:05:23,029
What if I just like

1581
02:05:23,029 --> 02:05:27,300
Like that, this is not,

1582
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:29,300
this is just a cyst.

1583
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:48,760
Good, did everybody get their screenshots?

1584
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:56,420
Now make an angry face.

1585
02:05:56,420 --> 02:05:58,420
I'm like held hostage right now.

1586
02:05:58,420 --> 02:06:02,460
Okay.

1587
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:06,100
Okay, okay, alright, alright, alright.

1588
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:47,430
I'm trying to match this.

1589
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:54,340
There you go, that's all you're getting. Good night.

1590
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:56,649
Dr. Phil.

1591
02:06:56,649 --> 02:06:59,850
Dr. Phil.

1592
02:07:10,069 --> 02:07:14,229
I think the game broke.

1593
02:07:14,229 --> 02:07:16,229
What happened?

1594
02:07:16,229 --> 02:07:18,229
Hold on, did I die so many times

1595
02:07:18,229 --> 02:07:20,229
with this character that his plot armor

1596
02:07:20,229 --> 02:07:22,409
melted?

1597
02:07:22,409 --> 02:07:24,409
I died like 15 times.

1598
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:38,460
Siren, siren, siren.

1599
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:40,460
Hold on.

1600
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:42,460
I like this game.

1601
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:45,590
Alright, you're going to get a choice.

1602
02:07:45,590 --> 02:07:48,220
You're going to get a choice.

1603
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:50,779
No, you're not. I lied.

1604
02:07:50,779 --> 02:07:57,369
You're not getting a choice.

1605
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:04,500
Why would I ever play Daze Bomb?

1606
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:08,069
Because it air shot you.

1607
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:16,840
Come on, Joe.

1608
02:08:20,220 --> 02:08:23,289
Come on, that was it.

1609
02:08:23,289 --> 02:08:26,100
I don't even know how you got there.

1610
02:08:34,279 --> 02:08:37,100
Okay, that is the run that you do

1611
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:42,020
when you drop a glass

1612
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:44,020
and it shatters in the kitchen

1613
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:46,020
and you don't know what to do. That is the

1614
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:48,020
I have to go get mom run.

1615
02:08:53,460 --> 02:08:55,460
Another gun.

1616
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:03,659
Dude, we shot in the air?

1617
02:09:05,659 --> 02:09:08,649
How do you block that? What are you made out of?

1618
02:09:08,649 --> 02:09:10,649
Metal?

1619
02:09:10,649 --> 02:09:12,890
Do you have metal shins?

1620
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:25,289
Oh shit.

1621
02:09:25,289 --> 02:09:29,380
Sleep well?

1622
02:09:29,380 --> 02:09:32,199
Do you reload?

1623
02:09:36,340 --> 02:09:40,180
What is this

1624
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:42,180
laugh?

1625
02:09:44,739 --> 02:09:46,739
Why are you doing an Elmer Fudd laugh?

1626
02:09:46,739 --> 02:09:54,470
Reload.

1627
02:09:59,699 --> 02:10:01,699
And you blo- I didn't.

1628
02:10:16,739 --> 02:10:19,560
Dreamcast sucks.

1629
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:21,560
Laughing by himself.

1630
02:10:26,039 --> 02:10:32,619
Favorite

1631
02:10:32,619 --> 02:10:34,619
chat comment of the last

1632
02:10:34,619 --> 02:10:36,619
three years.

1633
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:42,949
Come on, climb up. You climb up.

1634
02:10:42,949 --> 02:10:44,949
You climb up because

1635
02:10:44,949 --> 02:10:46,949
you're getting destroyed. I'm going to hit you. I don't even

1636
02:10:46,949 --> 02:10:49,130
care. Fucking honor?

1637
02:10:49,130 --> 02:10:51,819
Nope. Yeah, I'm going to

1638
02:10:51,819 --> 02:10:53,819
cut your damn fingers off.

1639
02:10:53,819 --> 02:11:10,779
Come on, get up here.

1640
02:11:19,779 --> 02:11:28,489
My doctor is going to be so mad

1641
02:11:28,489 --> 02:11:30,789
at me. I keep

1642
02:11:30,789 --> 02:11:32,789
hurting myself.

1643
02:11:32,789 --> 02:11:46,279
Okay.

1644
02:11:46,279 --> 02:11:48,579
Don't

1645
02:11:48,579 --> 02:11:51,659
go that way.

1646
02:11:51,659 --> 02:11:55,750
That's so

1647
02:11:55,750 --> 02:11:57,750
funny.

1648
02:11:57,750 --> 02:12:01,640
What's going on?

1649
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:04,010
Where am I?

1650
02:12:04,010 --> 02:12:06,310
What am I doing?

1651
02:12:06,310 --> 02:12:08,550
Alright.

1652
02:12:08,550 --> 02:12:12,579
Alright.

1653
02:12:12,579 --> 02:12:15,140
Here comes the

1654
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:17,640
fall jokes.

1655
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:19,640
Press R2

1656
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:22,010
and then hit circle.

1657
02:12:22,010 --> 02:12:25,460
Alright.

1658
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:27,460
To be fair though, I did not realize

1659
02:12:27,460 --> 02:12:29,460
what was going on until like I was by

1660
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:31,460
the rock. Could I-

1661
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:33,460
Okay, once I got to about right here

1662
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:35,460
I may have been able to stop

1663
02:12:35,460 --> 02:12:37,460
but even if I turned around quickly right here

1664
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:39,770
I don't think I would have done it.

1665
02:12:46,069 --> 02:12:48,069
Sorry, R2-

1666
02:12:48,069 --> 02:12:50,069
Wait, R2 and then circle?

1667
02:12:50,069 --> 02:12:53,899
Dude, shit.

1668
02:12:53,899 --> 02:12:55,899
You say I throw knives, that's not a knife.

1669
02:12:55,899 --> 02:12:57,899
That's a full sword.

1670
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:07,609
Alright, give me that back.

1671
02:13:09,609 --> 02:13:13,050
Can I pick it up?

1672
02:13:13,050 --> 02:13:15,050
I don't-

1673
02:13:15,050 --> 02:13:19,399
I can't pick this up.

1674
02:13:19,399 --> 02:13:24,630
Dude, you just die already.

1675
02:13:26,630 --> 02:13:29,060
How does that not kill you?

1676
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:31,060
Okay.

1677
02:13:31,060 --> 02:13:35,159
There it is.

1678
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:43,750
Oh, I can't throw it because

1679
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:45,750
I don't have a hand to throw it with.

1680
02:13:53,819 --> 02:13:55,819
This damn sucks. Flee, shred it.

1681
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:05,100
Hahaha.

1682
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:07,100
I win. I'm not gonna shred

1683
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:09,979
this. You can shred

1684
02:14:09,979 --> 02:14:11,979
the Guy Fieri game because it was $4.

1685
02:14:11,979 --> 02:14:13,979
Bushido Blade 2 was like $30

1686
02:14:13,979 --> 02:14:16,220
or $40.

1687
02:14:16,220 --> 02:14:18,220
This is like a rare game. You don't shred

1688
02:14:18,220 --> 02:14:37,659
this one.

1689
02:14:37,659 --> 02:14:43,720
Back it up. There it is. It's pretty

1690
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:45,720
incredible.

1691
02:14:50,390 --> 02:14:52,390
Please drop her off the cliff.

1692
02:14:52,390 --> 02:14:59,750
Why do I want that to happen?

1693
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:01,750
Yeah, I mean, it's a pretty- it's a pretty good image.

1694
02:15:01,750 --> 02:15:03,750
I will tell you. That's a pretty good image.

1695
02:15:03,750 --> 02:15:08,170
What a twist.

1696
02:15:08,170 --> 02:15:11,430
It means you're-

1697
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:14,819
you're that person's brother.

1698
02:15:14,819 --> 02:15:16,819
That's your- you came from

1699
02:15:16,819 --> 02:15:18,819
the same parents.

1700
02:15:29,029 --> 02:15:32,939
In fact,

1701
02:15:32,939 --> 02:15:35,239
you aren't carrying it at all.

1702
02:15:35,239 --> 02:15:37,239
Seems to be glued

1703
02:15:37,239 --> 02:15:39,239
to the tops of your fingers.

1704
02:15:39,239 --> 02:15:41,239
That wasn't that loud.

1705
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:49,319
Okay, so

1706
02:15:49,319 --> 02:15:51,319
do I have a choice here?

1707
02:15:51,319 --> 02:15:53,689
Oh, no, I-

1708
02:15:53,689 --> 02:15:56,760
Ooh, I like this.

1709
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:59,060
Ooh, I like that.

1710
02:15:59,060 --> 02:16:04,229
I like the spin.

1711
02:16:04,229 --> 02:16:06,229
I like that.

1712
02:16:06,229 --> 02:16:13,770
I like that.

1713
02:16:13,770 --> 02:16:18,170
I like that.

1714
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:21,180
I like that.

1715
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:23,180
I like that.

1716
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:25,420
I like the spin.

1717
02:16:25,420 --> 02:16:27,420
Oh, he's dead.

1718
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:29,420
No, stay away from that character. They're not a longer part of the game.

1719
02:16:45,270 --> 02:16:47,270
And, by the way,

1720
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:49,270
they died to a default enemy.

1721
02:16:49,270 --> 02:16:51,959
They died to the default

1722
02:16:51,959 --> 02:16:53,959
regular, just enemy.

1723
02:16:53,959 --> 02:16:59,590
That's- that's sad.

1724
02:17:03,899 --> 02:17:06,329
Hey.

1725
02:17:13,610 --> 02:17:16,540
Oh,

1726
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:18,540
I was trying to bury it in his head.

1727
02:17:22,540 --> 02:17:24,540
There it is.

1728
02:17:29,530 --> 02:17:31,530
Ooh.

1729
02:17:31,530 --> 02:17:33,530
Damn it.

1730
02:17:33,530 --> 02:17:35,959
What the fuck was that?

1731
02:17:40,680 --> 02:17:44,329
Damn it.

1732
02:17:44,329 --> 02:17:46,819
He blocked it twice.

1733
02:17:46,819 --> 02:17:48,819
We cut the shit?

1734
02:17:48,819 --> 02:17:51,510
All right.

1735
02:17:51,510 --> 02:17:57,270
His arm is broken.

1736
02:17:57,270 --> 02:17:59,270
All right, I'm looking over at the chat

1737
02:17:59,270 --> 02:18:01,270
and I see more purple text

1738
02:18:01,270 --> 02:18:04,280
than white text.

1739
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:07,420
And it also doesn't help that this link

1740
02:18:07,420 --> 02:18:09,420
is like a Google image link

1741
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:12,170
that's like- what the fuck

1742
02:18:12,170 --> 02:18:14,600
just happened?

1743
02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:31,879
Who shot me with a gun off screen?

1744
02:18:31,879 --> 02:18:34,120
All right, I want to stab. I want to get some of this.

1745
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:36,120
I mean, that's a pretty cool follow-up,

1746
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:38,120
but the thing never works.

1747
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:46,409
Let's go

1748
02:18:46,409 --> 02:18:48,409
back this way.

1749
02:18:48,409 --> 02:18:50,899
Got it.

1750
02:18:50,899 --> 02:18:52,899
It's a virus link. It's a Discord link.

1751
02:19:01,659 --> 02:19:03,899
That's the same thing.

1752
02:19:03,899 --> 02:19:07,350
Oh, that's me from before.

1753
02:19:07,350 --> 02:19:09,350
Now I have to kill me.

1754
02:19:15,930 --> 02:19:19,639
Ooh, this is so dumb.

1755
02:19:19,639 --> 02:19:21,639
What does it even do?

1756
02:19:23,639 --> 02:19:25,639
It just makes me vulnerable to getting hit in the-

1757
02:19:25,639 --> 02:19:27,639
it just makes me vulnerable to getting hit in the face.

1758
02:19:27,639 --> 02:19:36,469
And I didn't get it.

1759
02:19:38,649 --> 02:19:43,829
Same move.

1760
02:19:43,829 --> 02:19:45,829
Same ideas.

1761
02:19:45,829 --> 02:19:54,899
Ooh, that would've been nice.

1762
02:19:54,899 --> 02:19:56,899
So that-

1763
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:09,370
Shit.

1764
02:20:09,370 --> 02:20:11,370
Joopstorm, attention.

1765
02:20:11,370 --> 02:20:13,370
Joopstorm, chat is bored.

1766
02:20:13,370 --> 02:20:15,370
Joopstorm, attention. Joopstorm, chat is bored.

1767
02:20:24,139 --> 02:20:27,270
What is this?

1768
02:20:27,270 --> 02:20:29,270
What, is this the school bus

1769
02:20:29,270 --> 02:20:31,829
back from the field trip?

1770
02:20:31,829 --> 02:20:33,829
Am I the bus driver?

1771
02:20:33,829 --> 02:20:36,329
Can I look back

1772
02:20:36,329 --> 02:20:38,329
and everyone's just like, Joopstorm,

1773
02:20:38,329 --> 02:20:40,329
Joopstorm, Joopstorm. And I'm like,

1774
02:20:40,329 --> 02:20:45,510
God damn it, kid.

1775
02:20:45,510 --> 02:20:47,510
I'm trying to drive.

1776
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:54,620
I know- I know

1777
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:56,620
everybody was really excited

1778
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:58,620
going to the old English village.

1779
02:20:58,620 --> 02:21:02,520
But relax.

1780
02:21:05,190 --> 02:21:16,649
Was I bleeding on my stomach?

1781
02:21:25,209 --> 02:21:27,209
For a second I thought the audio was off the whole screen.

1782
02:21:27,209 --> 02:21:34,059
Go to the McDonald's

1783
02:21:34,059 --> 02:21:36,059
drive-through

1784
02:21:36,059 --> 02:21:38,940
with a school bus.

1785
02:21:38,940 --> 02:21:40,940
That would be the most fucking

1786
02:21:40,940 --> 02:21:42,940
ridiculous thing.

1787
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:44,940
Imagine seeing a school bus

1788
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:46,940
in front of you at the- like the Burger King.

1789
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:48,940
You'd be like,

1790
02:21:48,940 --> 02:21:50,940
nope, I'm gonna go somewhere

1791
02:21:50,940 --> 02:22:01,110
else.

1792
02:22:09,239 --> 02:22:11,739
Just stop.

1793
02:22:11,739 --> 02:22:13,739
Somebody's like, can we play something else

1794
02:22:13,739 --> 02:22:15,739
besides Bushido

1795
02:22:15,739 --> 02:22:18,040
Butthole 2?

1796
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:20,040
Excuse me.

1797
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:22,040
This is a fucking- this is a classic

1798
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:24,040
game that is very

1799
02:22:24,040 --> 02:22:26,040
very- it paved the way for a lot of stuff.

1800
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,040
And it's fun. I'm playing

1801
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:34,120
it. What?

1802
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:43,399
I just did that to him to look cool

1803
02:22:43,399 --> 02:22:47,690
because he looked cool.

1804
02:22:47,690 --> 02:22:50,700
R2 then jump.

1805
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:53,829
Holy shit, that was cool. What?

1806
02:22:53,829 --> 02:22:56,709
What?

1807
02:22:56,709 --> 02:22:58,709
A sword came out of it.

1808
02:22:58,709 --> 02:23:00,709
Why does a sword

1809
02:23:00,709 --> 02:23:03,659
come out?

1810
02:23:03,659 --> 02:23:09,219
If the game

1811
02:23:09,219 --> 02:23:11,219
is so good, why did they only make two?

1812
02:23:11,219 --> 02:23:13,219
Okay, why did they only make two

1813
02:23:13,219 --> 02:23:16,870
Parappas?

1814
02:23:16,870 --> 02:23:21,610
Why are there only two Paper Marios?

1815
02:23:21,610 --> 02:23:27,159
Why are there

1816
02:23:27,159 --> 02:23:29,159
only two Corona games?

1817
02:23:29,159 --> 02:23:36,120
God damn it, I lost

1818
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:38,620
again.

1819
02:23:38,620 --> 02:23:40,620
Why are there only two Team Fortresses?

1820
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:42,620
Why are there only two Half-Lives?

1821
02:23:47,719 --> 02:23:49,719
In fact, if a game has

1822
02:23:49,719 --> 02:23:51,719
more than three or four iterations,

1823
02:23:51,719 --> 02:23:53,719
it's usually a shitty

1824
02:23:53,719 --> 02:23:55,719
game franchise.

1825
02:23:55,719 --> 02:23:57,719
You ever think about that one?

1826
02:23:57,719 --> 02:23:59,719
6,000 IQ chat room?

1827
02:24:07,139 --> 02:24:13,420
Look at that thing.

1828
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:15,420
That thing's awesome. What's that called?

1829
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:18,360
That's like the Moonlit Greatsword.

1830
02:24:18,360 --> 02:24:20,360
That thing is so cool. What's that called?

1831
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:28,659
I ain't gonna let you do that shit.

1832
02:24:30,659 --> 02:24:34,250
That would've been good.

1833
02:24:34,250 --> 02:24:36,250
His arm's fucked up. No.

1834
02:24:36,250 --> 02:24:38,489
I can't believe it.

1835
02:24:38,489 --> 02:24:44,760
It's called Big Sword.

1836
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:46,760
Guys, I'm only doing this to get to the end

1837
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:48,760
so I can kill the lady again.

1838
02:24:48,760 --> 02:24:50,760
And everyone can go.

1839
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:52,760
The D.

1840
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:54,760
The D face.

1841
02:25:06,020 --> 02:25:08,020
Got it.

1842
02:25:08,020 --> 02:25:10,020
Down. Down.

1843
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:12,459
Down. Down.

1844
02:25:14,459 --> 02:25:16,459
Oh, the spin.

1845
02:25:23,799 --> 02:25:26,170
Wait.

1846
02:25:26,170 --> 02:25:29,180
Is it teleporting person?

1847
02:25:29,180 --> 02:25:31,860
Uh-oh, it's teleporter.

1848
02:25:43,579 --> 02:25:45,579
Nope.

1849
02:25:48,139 --> 02:25:50,139
Wait, it is.

1850
02:25:52,139 --> 02:25:55,270
Wait, is it?

1851
02:25:55,270 --> 02:25:57,270
Is it new? Is it new guy?

1852
02:25:57,270 --> 02:25:59,700
It is. Thank God.

1853
02:26:16,579 --> 02:26:24,260
Oh, he's got

1854
02:26:24,260 --> 02:26:26,260
an armor gimmick.

1855
02:26:26,260 --> 02:26:30,090
He just bounced

1856
02:26:30,090 --> 02:26:32,090
it off his chest like it was nothing.

1857
02:26:45,379 --> 02:26:56,459
Countering it every time.

1858
02:26:56,459 --> 02:27:35,799
Out of level.

1859
02:27:55,510 --> 02:27:57,510
Fuck.

1860
02:27:57,510 --> 02:27:59,510
I'm trying to hit him in the back.

1861
02:27:59,510 --> 02:28:03,739
Damn it.

1862
02:28:13,190 --> 02:28:15,190
He has like this thing on his back.

1863
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:17,190
Is that like a spot to hit?

1864
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:27,270
Okay, I can't hit him.

1865
02:28:27,270 --> 02:28:30,790
He's running after me.

1866
02:28:30,790 --> 02:28:33,930
Burrito? What?

1867
02:28:38,139 --> 02:28:40,139
Strike his back. I'm trying!

1868
02:28:40,139 --> 02:28:42,309
It didn't even get me.

1869
02:28:42,309 --> 02:28:53,299
It didn't work.

1870
02:28:53,299 --> 02:29:02,700
He doesn't know where I am.

1871
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:07,299
I did it. I got him.

1872
02:29:07,299 --> 02:29:10,489
He was even looking over his

1873
02:29:10,489 --> 02:29:12,489
shoulder like he was backing out of a parking spot.

1874
02:29:12,489 --> 02:29:14,489
Like he was turned looking

1875
02:29:14,489 --> 02:29:16,489
straight back.

1876
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:27,500
Wait, son?

1877
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:29,500
Brother? What does that mean?

1878
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:42,659
I'm your

1879
02:29:42,659 --> 02:29:44,659
father. I'm your

1880
02:29:44,659 --> 02:29:46,659
brother. I'm your sister.

1881
02:29:46,659 --> 02:29:50,739
Sister.

1882
02:29:50,739 --> 02:29:52,739
The most basic of all twists.

1883
02:29:52,739 --> 02:29:54,739
Just three in a row.

1884
02:30:27,049 --> 02:30:33,059
That hasn't been confirmed yet, so you know.

1885
02:30:42,389 --> 02:30:44,389
Okay.

1886
02:30:44,389 --> 02:30:48,920
Okay.

1887
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:57,370
Guys.

1888
02:30:57,370 --> 02:31:06,379
I have to do it again.

1889
02:31:06,379 --> 02:31:10,469
With another character.

1890
02:31:10,469 --> 02:31:12,899
I have to.

1891
02:31:12,899 --> 02:31:22,229
It's gonna not take-

1892
02:31:22,229 --> 02:31:24,229
I'm gonna do a very good weapon.

1893
02:31:24,229 --> 02:31:31,530
Explain why.

1894
02:31:31,530 --> 02:31:37,219
I don't know.

1895
02:31:37,219 --> 02:31:44,120
I don't know.

1896
02:31:44,120 --> 02:31:46,120
Wait, we didn't even do

1897
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:48,120
VR mode.

1898
02:31:48,120 --> 02:31:50,120
That's god. We haven't even done VR mode.

1899
02:31:50,120 --> 02:31:53,379
Stop.

1900
02:31:53,379 --> 02:31:56,840
Stop.

1901
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:59,340
That's enough.

1902
02:31:59,340 --> 02:32:03,049
We've been in the drive-thru for hours.

1903
02:32:03,049 --> 02:32:16,489
Everybody wants me to move to Siren.

1904
02:32:16,489 --> 02:32:18,489
And I can't wait to see

1905
02:32:18,489 --> 02:32:20,489
all the people that say

1906
02:32:20,489 --> 02:32:22,489
go back to Bushido Blade.

1907
02:32:22,489 --> 02:32:24,860
Oh, it's gonna be-

1908
02:32:24,860 --> 02:32:27,420
It's gonna be rich.

1909
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:37,209
Alright. Just one boss.

1910
02:32:37,209 --> 02:32:40,659
As you.

1911
02:32:40,659 --> 02:32:42,659
And I'm gonna use-

1912
02:32:42,659 --> 02:32:44,659
Hold on. Don't worry. We're almost done.

1913
02:32:44,659 --> 02:32:46,659
We're almost done. Don't worry.

1914
02:32:46,659 --> 02:32:48,659
Broad-sword. We're almost done.

1915
02:32:48,659 --> 02:33:03,510
And then we'll play

1916
02:33:03,510 --> 02:33:07,540
Siren.

1917
02:33:07,540 --> 02:33:09,780
Well, this is awful.

1918
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:11,780
Why would they put a wireframe here?

1919
02:33:14,020 --> 02:33:16,020
Of all the things that

1920
02:33:16,020 --> 02:33:18,020
don't deserve a punch-out-style

1921
02:33:18,020 --> 02:33:20,020
wireframe.

1922
02:33:20,020 --> 02:33:22,840
It's this game.

1923
02:33:25,139 --> 02:33:27,139
What information

1924
02:33:27,139 --> 02:33:29,139
are they conveying to me?

1925
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:35,340
I don't know if that's my body,

1926
02:33:35,340 --> 02:33:37,340
my stomach, or-

1927
02:33:43,350 --> 02:33:53,899
Let's go.

1928
02:33:53,899 --> 02:33:55,899
Okay. My final take

1929
02:33:55,899 --> 02:33:58,069
on the Bushido series.

1930
02:33:58,069 --> 02:34:00,069
That's pretty cool. It was great.

1931
02:34:00,069 --> 02:34:02,940
It's a fun game.

1932
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:04,940
Especially when you play- when you played this game

1933
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:06,940
in two-player.

1934
02:34:06,940 --> 02:34:08,940
It was really, really, really fun. Because it

1935
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:10,940
was so easy for someone to die.

1936
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:14,120
It was great.
