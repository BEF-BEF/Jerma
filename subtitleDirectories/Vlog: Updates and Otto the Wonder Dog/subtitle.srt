00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,150
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with an outdoor vlog. I've never done one

2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,170
of these before, but look, you want to see? I'm really outside. I know, right? It's crazy.

3
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,199
A nerd like me going outside. Yeah, right. But I wanted to make this video because obviously

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,760
it's beautiful outside. It's kind of late, but it was beautiful outside earlier. But

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,299
I wanted to make this video to give a couple of updates on certain things because I get

6
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:39,740
asked these questions a lot of times. So, Grandpa. Grandpa is coming back to Machinima

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:47,200
Respawn next month. There's going to be a trailer for Grandpa next week, I think, for

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,479
season two. So if you're wondering, Jerma, where did Grandpa go? How come there's been

9
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:57,700
no Grandpa for like five weeks on Machinima Respawn? It's because it was taken into an

10
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,380
off season and it's coming back. Don't worry. So, May, look for Grandpa. Oh my God, a bug

11
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:10,989
just landed on me. Bug bastards. So look for Grandpa in May on Machinima Respawn. And I'm

12
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:15,370
working on it right now. It's going to be ridiculous. So the second thing is a lot of

13
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,730
wind right now. Hopefully it's not ruining this entire footage. But the second thing

14
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:26,209
is going to be about my server, my Team Fortress 2 server. And I bought it. It's all set up.

15
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:32,510
It's all ready to go. But I want to talk to somebody that knows about servers. I have

16
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:39,049
an appointment with Shibby2142. He knows what he's talking about. So before I make the server

17
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:44,409
public and the server live and all that stuff, I want to make sure it's good to go and I

18
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:49,489
have all the settings as good as I can possibly have them. So stay tuned. I'll make another

19
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:55,420
video. I'll mention it in another video. But yes, the server is coming along one week from

20
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:03,060
today. It should be live. That's my prediction. Otto, what are you doing? My dog is running

21
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,810
around in circles around the yard. And speaking of Otto, I don't know if you can hear that,

22
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,990
but speaking of Otto, a lot of people have asked this. They want to see more Otto. If

23
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,990
you don't know, Otto is my little dog, my little Doxen Doberman Chihuahua thing that

24
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,110
I got like a month ago. And I showed him in one video and that was all it took. Everyone

25
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:32,360
loves Otto. They want to see him. So okay, here you go. Oh God, he's coming to get me.

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:44,389
Come on. What do you got? What do you got? That's my shoe. You are a freak. Look at

27
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:53,310
that face. Oh my God. What? Oh, I'm going to pick up this stick that's like 10 times

28
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:02,330
bigger than my body. This is actually going to work. What an idiot. Hey, don't eat that.

29
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,930
So thank you all so much for watching. I really do. It's cold out. My lips are like all numb.

30
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,810
So like talking is like, but thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate

31
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:18,810
it. And I will see you guys all next time. So peace, love, and take care everybody. Otto!
