00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,630
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Blacklight Retribution.

2
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:20,629
The first Blacklight Retribution video on this channel. Not sure if it's going to be the last or not, but we will see as time goes.

3
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:28,629
I actually just recently installed this game. I didn't really catch on to it when it released a little while ago, but it's very, very fun.

4
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:33,630
This is not a game that I would consider to be the best first-person shooter I've ever played in my life,

5
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,630
but it is definitely very, very fun, very, very action-oriented.

6
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:43,630
And if you're noticing on the screen, before I really get into the loadout, because I mean, I'm not really that sure of a lot of the game mechanics,

7
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:52,429
because like I said, I just sort of installed this game not that long ago, and I only really have maybe five hours into the game, maybe total.

8
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:58,429
So I unlocked this gun, and the way that unlockables work in this game, it's actually very, very confusing at first.

9
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:06,430
And again, pretty much how it works is you have to buy either with in-game currency or out-of-game currency, which is actual real money.

10
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,430
You have to buy these guns, and they only last for a certain amount of time.

11
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,430
I think this gun has one day on it before I can not use it anymore, unless I want to buy more time with it.

12
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,670
It's a little confusing. I'm not sure if there's any way you can permanently purchase an item or not,

13
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,230
but if you can, then that's something I have not really figured out yet.

14
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:31,230
But what I want to bring up in this game, it's actually a very, very good discussion to have with you guys,

15
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,230
it is how to stop hackers from taking over your game.

16
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,230
Now this is, I guess I could go in a million different directions with this,

17
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:44,230
but I want to cover on the legal free hacks that every single person gets in this game.

18
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,230
It's actually a major, major part of the game mechanic.

19
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,230
So if you see right there, I just touched my face and instantly could see through all the walls.

20
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,230
It kind of reminds me of, if you ever played Perfect Dark,

21
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,230
that gun where you could see everybody's silhouettes through walls and you could shoot through walls,

22
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,230
you cannot shoot through walls in this game.

23
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,230
But oh, watch this like fail hack right here.

24
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,230
I really had no idea what I was even doing.

25
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,229
I just was like, just hack, I just do this button, whatever.

26
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,229
But that's besides the point there.

27
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,409
So legal free hacks, that's the discussion of this video.

28
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:20,409
And when you give it to everybody, what are the consequences of doing this and what does it actually achieve?

29
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:22,409
So let's go from the very beginning here.

30
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,409
When a game comes out, there's always going to be hackers.

31
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:28,409
There's always going to be people that get some way to exploit the code.

32
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,409
They come up with all kinds of different things where they can,

33
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:37,409
oh, here's like auto aim, here's wall hacks, here's super secret butthead hack, whatever you have for hacks.

34
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:44,580
So a company like this that decides to come up with a game that just includes hacks for everybody,

35
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,580
it almost makes it so even if you got a wall hack for this game,

36
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,580
it wouldn't even be necessary because you can do that anyways.

37
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:57,580
And I feel like that's a very, very good way to deter anybody from hacking the game to begin with.

38
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,819
Because when you hack a game, you're doing it because you're trying to get an advantage on people, an unfair advantage.

39
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:10,819
And that's something that companies since back in like the mid 90s when PC gaming really took off in the first place,

40
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:13,819
they've been trying to combat this for so long.

41
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:20,129
And you could go back to when DRM first came out, the bad DRM, the one where it was like,

42
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:26,129
if you are not connected to the internet at 24-7, then we're going to come to your house and slam your head off your desk.

43
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:29,129
It gets kind of ridiculous, especially when they introduce stuff like that,

44
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,129
or you can only install the game in one or two different places.

45
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:40,129
But it's almost necessary now because these companies are so scared of piracy, of hackers,

46
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:45,129
of all these bad things that could plague a game community that they freak out sometimes.

47
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:52,370
Diablo 3 has a constant connection and it's technically a single player game.

48
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,370
Now, I mean, we could go off on, I could talk about this for the entire day,

49
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,370
but let's get back to Blacklight and how free hacks make no hacks.

50
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,740
So let's say you load up Blacklight Retribution.

51
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,740
You turn it on, you get your hacks ready, you get auto aim or auto bot or whatever it is, auto bot.

52
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,740
That's from the Transformers, right?

53
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,740
Well, let's say you like get Optimus Prime or like come down to your house and sit down and like play games with you.

54
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,740
No, so let's say you load up your auto aim.

55
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,740
You load up Blacklight, you get into a game, get into a lobby and you play the game.

56
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,980
Even if you have it enabled and you're killing people with auto aim, people can see you through walls.

57
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:36,279
So you still can't get that 200 and 0 KD game or that 95 and 2 KD game

58
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,279
because people can come up behind you that you can't see and will still kill you.

59
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,709
Now, this is not to say that nobody will ever hack Blacklight Retribution.

60
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:49,709
No, there's probably people right now in the lobby shooting a million people and killing people with hacks.

61
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:54,709
But the point of this video is to talk about the potential deterrence that this could have to a hacker

62
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,709
or to somebody that wants to cheat in the game.

63
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:01,709
And just basically in general that if a game is fun, a game has great mechanics, a game is interesting,

64
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:05,709
it has a great community, not very many people are going to hack it.

65
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,709
And it's, I see that a lot in Team Fortress 2.

66
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:13,709
Team Fortress 2 has a very good community behind it and not, you know, you run into a hacker every now and then,

67
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:18,709
but it's pretty rare in the over five years that I've played Team Fortress 2.

68
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:23,709
I really think I've only come across maybe three hackers in the entire time I played the game.

69
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:30,709
Now, translate that to another one of these big titles that is plagued with hackers and you start to see the correlation.

70
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:36,079
Some of these games have huge, massive mainstream audiences,

71
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:42,079
which of course there's more of a pool for hackers and a game like Team Fortress, of course, has a lot less players,

72
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,079
but they're much more close-knit.

73
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,079
And I think it's all about that guy. It's all about love.

74
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:51,079
It's all about community because if you know the guy next to you, do you want to hack him?

75
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:56,259
I mean, not really. I mean, if you don't know the guy five doors down down the street,

76
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:59,259
do you care if you hack that guy? Probably not.

77
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,259
Now, I don't want to get into a discussion where we're talking about which gaming community is the best

78
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:06,259
because every gaming community really has its ups and its downs.

79
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:08,259
So no real community is the best.

80
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:11,259
There are always going to be new ones popping up every now and then,

81
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:13,259
and they're good to be a part of all of them.

82
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,430
But I just wanted to make this video to kind of get a discussion going.

83
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,430
I'd like to see what you guys have to say, some of your thoughts.

84
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,430
If you have any points to make, please, by all means, put it in the comments section.

85
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,430
I would love to read them, as would a lot of the other people that are watching this video right now as well.

86
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,430
So please let me know what you think.

87
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,430
And also, before this video is over, I don't even like talk about how this is free.

88
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,430
This game is free to play.

89
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,430
You can go download it through Steam right now, which I highly suggest you do.

90
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,430
Even if you only play this game for an hour or two, that's you didn't have to pay for it.

91
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,430
I mean, what's the worst that could happen?

92
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,430
And I always forget about that when it comes to free to play games.

93
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,670
Even if you don't like it, you can just uninstall it and pretend like it never happened, right?

94
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,670
And I really am feeling like this game is starting to catch on with me.

95
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,670
I love the gunplay. I like the mechanics. I like the wall hacks.

96
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,670
It's a lot of fun.

97
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:06,670
And I did say in the very beginning that this was not the best FPS I've ever played before, but it is very good.

98
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,980
So hopefully you guys check this game out.

99
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,980
And with that, that is going to wrap up the video.

100
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,980
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

101
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,980
And I will see you guys all next time.

102
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,980
And take care, everybody.
