1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,359
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Battlefield 3 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,059
Only the second Battlefield 3 video on this channel, and I'm gonna try and change that.

3
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:24,559
I'm trying to get better at this game, trying to find my groove playing with Shibby2142 and a couple other guys.

4
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,059
They helped me out. They were pretty good seasoned veterans at this game.

5
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:36,049
So, enjoy the live commentary guys starting right now.

6
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,450
Oh, no. Oh, it's a bad idea.

7
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:44,109
Whoa. Hey, he just went right by me. I'm cool with that.

8
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:48,460
Oh, where's this guy?

9
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,460
Alright, everyone join Charlie.

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,460
Wait, can't, can't just like kick this person?

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,460
Yeah, I can just kick. Oh, okay.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,460
Cause I don't like him anyways. How did I not get that guy?

13
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,460
One second. Oh, he just died.

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,310
Jerma, watch it around the corner. Nice. Yeah, I got him.

15
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,430
One more. Oh, Jesus.

16
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,430
Alright, join up Shibs. Oh my God, he's trying to knife me.

17
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,430
Nice dude, that was nice.

18
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:17,329
Thank you for just saving my life.

19
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:20,400
Anybody else?

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,329
No, I think that's it.

21
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:26,329
Oh, no, there's somebody. Oh, no, there's an AA.

22
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:28,329
He's like on the opposite side of two walls.

23
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:30,329
Oh, God. No, he got me.

24
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,959
So far away. He got me.

25
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,959
I don't know. Sniper, two guys.

26
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,400
Nice, good job.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
There's another guy though, his buddy.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Got health back, Shibya, get some health on him.

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm down, down.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Can I revive him? Yeah, we traded so he's dead.

31
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,469
Oh, I'm dead, dead? Yeah.

32
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:53,219
The green meaning.

33
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,219
Like the green monster.

34
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,219
Jerma knows all about that.

35
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:59,219
Oh, come on.

36
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,219
What do you know about suppressing fire right there?

37
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:06,219
Oh my God. Oh, God, no.

38
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:08,219
Is that you in the helicopter right there?

39
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,800
Dude, the helicopter.

40
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Nice.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
I tried to come in and just flank him with a helicopter.

42
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Oh, come on.

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
No, I have no ammo left.

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,099
I have absolutely no ammo left.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,189
Done?

46
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,189
Oh my God, it's a helicopter.

47
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,189
The sun is so bright.

48
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:32,189
Too bright.

49
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,490
Like notify that the building's falling.

50
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,490
Yeah, that's probably the rarest way to die in this game is by destruction because, you know, Frostbite 2.

51
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,490
So much destruction, guys.

52
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,490
Less destruction than Bad Company 2.

53
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,490
Makes sense, right?

54
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,490
Destruction.

55
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,490
Yeah, so getting killed by destruction, that's like an honor.

56
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,490
Oh, boy.

57
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,490
Oh, God, that's a helicopter.

58
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,490
Hit the helicopter face on with a rocket.

59
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,490
What do I get?

60
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,490
Nothing. Nothing from it.

61
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,490
Nope. Nope.

62
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,490
Alright, let's take BA's also getting capped.

63
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,490
Coming right behind you, Shibby.

64
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,490
Alright.

65
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,490
Because I'm trying to take out element choppers with rockets and it doesn't work.

66
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,490
Minus the left. Minus Shibby.

67
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,729
Yep, two of them.

68
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,729
I got killed.

69
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,729
I don't even know where he was.

70
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:22,289
Working on him. Got one.

71
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:26,319
I saw that.

72
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,319
Ooh, with the revive clutch.

73
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,330
Not a lot of people do that.

74
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,530
Can't switch revive.

75
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,530
It's a roll.

76
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,530
Okay, A's clean, B's clean, C's clean.

77
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,530
Wait, C's flashing. Let's go.

78
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,530
Why did I do that?

79
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,530
Hold on to my chopper.

80
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,530
He's on the roof.

81
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,530
Oh, eat this.

82
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,030
Eat this, baby.

83
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,030
Alright, let's go.

84
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,030
Vote next map.

85
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,030
Oh, I got your RPG.

86
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:04,259
Got him.

87
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:07,889
Got this.

88
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:09,889
We got this.

89
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,889
Where are we going?

90
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:13,889
I don't know. I accidentally pushed E out of the helicopter.

91
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,889
Shibby, I like this...

92
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,889
I like this scope you got.

93
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,319
This thing's good.

94
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,319
I like this little...

95
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,079
The Cobra.

96
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,079
So that's considered one of the red dots.

97
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,079
And then there's the red dot, red dot, which is the American version.

98
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,079
Why are we going to E?

99
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,079
Oh, in front of us, in front of us.

100
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:36,319
Got him.

101
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,319
Where did he spawn from?

102
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,319
Let's just go take A, if you want to go on foot.

103
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,319
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

104
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,480
Alright, I'm going to take this corner right here.

105
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,240
Oh, we're going to shot from behind.

106
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
Oh my stupid little bird.

107
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,240
I hate that.

108
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,600
He came out of nowhere.

109
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Anybody in the building?

110
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
That thing's so overpowered.

111
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Alright.

112
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Hopefully our car is still there.

113
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I kind of paid her a lot for that one.

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,970
Yeah, we had valet pocket.

115
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,209
Uh oh.

116
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,209
Don't push E.

117
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:14,209
Woohoo!

118
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:16,209
No, it disappeared.

119
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,209
Guy on the road.

120
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:20,209
You guys are going B?

121
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:23,089
We're going B, B, E, E.

122
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,089
There's a car at B, so watch it.

123
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:27,089
We're in a ram it.

124
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:29,089
Germa, it's all you.

125
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:32,290
This guy's down.

126
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,290
Oh, where was he?

127
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm dead.

128
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
That was a poor decision.

129
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Because we were bumping the Jurassic Park tune and I just got all jacked up.

130
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,269
T?

131
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:47,269
I did it!

132
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:49,269
Am I even capping this damn thing?

133
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:54,370
Protecting it.

134
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,370
Spawning on the T of space.

135
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,800
Oh no, little bird.

136
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,110
Aw yeah.

137
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,110
We're about to win.

138
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,110
These guys got crushed.

139
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,689
Secured, flag cap.

140
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:10,689
Oh, you need some heals, you need some heals.

141
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,689
Who's that guy?

142
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:14,689
Give me a sec.

143
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,689
Shoot him, just shoot him, just shoot him all, no!

144
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:21,600
Your team has won.

145
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
So that is going to wrap up the video guys.

146
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Thank you so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.

147
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
And I will see you guys all next time, trying to get better at Battlefield.

148
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
I promise you.

149
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
See you guys all next time.

150
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Take care, everybody.
