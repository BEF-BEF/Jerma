1
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:15,029
I told you guys I was gonna be early. I told you. I mean I'm only five minutes early but I'm still

2
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:34,539
early. Still counts. Still does. How you doing? Are we doing good? I gotta tweet this. Today

3
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:47,719
we're gonna play some FMV games. One just came out that piqued my interest. If we're gonna play

4
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:58,570
the first one is not late. No, I'm not late. I'm precisely on time. The first one's called

5
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:12,709
American Hero and apparently this game is like 25 years old and it was never released. So some

6
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:18,859
company, I guess they like got 90% of the way through development and they just didn't finish

7
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:26,120
the game. So some random indie company, I don't know what the name of the company is. I kind of

8
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:36,060
forget. Got all the footage and actually released it. So this is a very old game. I'm very interested

9
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:47,049
in this one. You're a hipster king. Well, not really. This thing's on the Nintendo Switch right

10
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:58,170
now. So not really. I didn't like go get this on some secret place. You can literally get this on

11
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:12,039
Switch right now. What about Monster Breeder? It's possible we play Monster Breeder later today.

12
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:17,699
It really depends on how long these take. Because with some FMV games, some of these games are

13
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,139
40 minutes. Some of them are three hours. It really depends on how many. Maybe if we play

14
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:30,379
through it again, if we move on to the next one, I don't know. It depends. We'll see.

15
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:45,099
You can play among us. It's never gonna happen. It's gonna be awful or bad.

16
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:56,009
Is that what you said? Did I read that wrong? This is gonna be awful or bad. What about the

17
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:01,689
Goosebumps FMV with Jeff Goldblum? I did not even know that existed. But now that I know that

18
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:08,860
exists, I'm very interested. I'm like an FMV wine connoisseur. It doesn't matter how bad they are.

19
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:21,539
It doesn't matter how shitty they are. I have to play them. All of them. If I can. Also, I want to

20
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:27,560
make this really clear. There was a content warning on this game. Apparently it's pretty dated.

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know exactly what that means. But like I said, it's on the Switch.

22
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:44,060
I don't know how... I don't exactly know what to be looking for. But we'll be on the ready.

23
00:03:44,699 --> 00:04:01,050
Are you gonna stream bad mojo? Probably not. So if we do come across something that's

24
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:07,990
fucking shitty and bad, you know, you fucking behave yourselves. Come on. Come on, Gwen.

25
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:24,980
You know what I mean? Are you gonna stream crab game? No, I don't. No. No, I don't.

26
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:35,290
Every one of these games it takes off, I don't play them. I watch. Okay. With like trends on

27
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:41,290
Twitch, it's kind of like how a lot of people jump into like the stock market and stuff.

28
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,490
It's like a game will come along and I'll go, that looks kind of cool. I would like to maybe

29
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,930
try that out. That looks like a great experience. And then I don't play it. And then two or three

30
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:58,250
weeks later, it's incredibly popular and everyone's on it. Oh, that's awesome. I

31
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,610
probably should have... Maybe I could get in now. I don't think I'm gonna get it. I, you know,

32
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,250
maybe. It looks fun. Now it's like the biggest thing on Twitch, the biggest thing in the world.

33
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:15,750
I don't want to buy the top of the crab game meta. You know what I mean? Stop calling me a hipster.

34
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:28,439
Why are you saying that? Why don't you stream McDonald's hamburger adventure? I don't even

35
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:38,360
know what you're talking about. All right. You guys ready? Apparently, this is something else

36
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,209
I read about this too, is the actor that's in this, they had to have him re-record lines

37
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:53,480
with the restoration. And I mean, the guy's like almost 25 plus years older than he is.

38
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,079
So I don't know how that's going to play out, but it might be pretty funny.

39
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:11,079
But this is American hero. I am ready. Our choices matter, apparently. Are you going to

40
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:17,750
play Fortnite or should I just go? You liar. You're a, how many months up? You're a six-month

41
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,879
subscriber. You've been here for six months. You know what happens on this channel. You're a liar.

42
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:36,459
You're lying to everybody. All right. You ready? Let's go. This is American hero. Viewer discretion

43
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:49,180
is advised apparently. And let's go. You ready? Oh, by the way, very important. That's the guy

44
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:56,089
from, that's my Bush from comedy central. Yeah. I don't know if anyone remembers that show.

45
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:11,160
That was a really weird reference, but here we go. American hero. Yeah. Okay. Well,

46
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:20,550
there's right off the bat, right off the bat. I hope there's, uh, I don't think, I don't think

47
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:34,600
there's any nudity. I hope not. No, there's not. Oh God. My home away from home. It's, I,

48
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:41,189
Crystal's looking good today. I think that's the, I think that's the voiceover. I think that's a new

49
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:48,490
line. You got something against me making a lemon. Relax. Just care. Asshole. There is nudity. No,

50
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:54,009
there's not. It's on the switch. It can't be. It's on the Nintendo switch. It's impossible.

51
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:58,329
They don't allow any nudity on the switch. That's a lie. It can't be possible.

52
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:13,110
Here's trouble. They were right. Now you can piss off. Sergeant. It's Colonel. BFD.

53
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:21,029
The old man has a problem. Why does it sound like he's in a bathroom? Not interested. It involves

54
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:32,490
Laura and a dangerous mind control virus. Dangerous. Okay. I think she's been kidnapped. Can't say more.

55
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,250
It looks like borderlands characters. What's the, what's the, it looks weird. Why are you interested?

56
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:45,450
Meet me somewhere a little more private. You're a big fucking dork. All right. Let me pay attention

57
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:54,919
to the game. A rock in a hard place. I have to make a decision here. What do I want to do?

58
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:04,700
Bad news. Bad news. Or party. What? Bad news. What's going on? What'd I do?

59
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:21,750
Did he leave? Oh shit. Am I going to get run over by a car? Why is there a truck?

60
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:43,129
Do I have to move the QTE? What do I do? What do I do? A ledge. Run. A ledge. Run. A ledge. Run. Run.

61
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,259
Jump. Jump. I'm going to jump. I'm going to drop. I'm going to drop. He's going to get run over.

62
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:06,039
New item unlocked? Oh shit.

63
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:31,659
Wait. Hold on a second. Hold on. So I was in a strip club and then I was either going to go do

64
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:35,500
this mission or stay in the strip club. And then he left the strip club. Started running away from

65
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:43,940
a, somebody in a Mack truck that ran my whole body over lengthwise, which is

66
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:50,889
fucking crazy. I got steamrolled. Okay. All right. No, Jesus. We have to do this again.

67
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:57,450
I don't want to have to show this again. I, all right. What should I do? Should I?

68
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,490
I'm going to go get the bad news. I'm not clicking party on a game that has been confirmed to have

69
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:13,429
nudity in it. No way. Not going to happen. Nope. Not happening. My home away from home.

70
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:17,669
I could run over lengthwise. That's fucking it ran over from my heels looking good today

71
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:20,860
to the top of my head. That was insane.

72
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,019
I missed that last time as well. He's drinking carrot juice. I don't get it.

73
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,110
I don't believe there's nudity on the switch.

74
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:53,210
Here's trouble. They were right. So now you can piss off. Oh, there's not. It's Colonel B F D.

75
00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:01,529
The old man has a problem. I'm not clicking party. Not interested. It involves Laura

76
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:14,659
and a dangerous mind control virus. I didn't mean to click that. I think she's been kidnapped.

77
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:21,529
Can't say more upscaled with AI. If you're interested, meet me somewhere a little more.

78
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:24,970
It does actually, I'm actually kind of glad it looks like this because some of the old FMV

79
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,529
games we played in the past, they look like absolute dog shit. So this doesn't really even

80
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:36,250
look that bad. All right. No, no party. No, I have to get this right. It's like a rhythm game.

81
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:49,399
Bad news. Bad news. Bad news. Bad news. I clicked bad news. I clicked bad news. I don't want to

82
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:55,399
run away from the fucking truck. I clicked bad news. I clicked.

83
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:01,059
I clicked. What's the fuck? No, I'm how do I skip the cut scene?

84
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:10,090
I'm not going to get run over again. The truck is bad news. Oh, no it's not. I didn't do anything

85
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:17,000
last time. All right. All right. This time don't drop. This time I'm going to, I'm going to go

86
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:28,309
for the ledge. Ledge. Ledge. Run. Ledge. Run. Ledge. Ledge. Ledge. Run. Is he doing it?

87
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:38,230
What? He's not making decisions. What the fuck? Drop. Jump. Drop. I can't do anything. Drop. Do

88
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:56,600
you hear me clicking? Do you hear this? What? Why doesn't the game work? Mouse one. I'm clicking

89
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:11,690
mouse one. Oh, this is not good. It's not right click. It's left click, right? Maybe I should

90
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:18,970
unplug the controller. I don't think I have one unplugged in. I mean the mouse apps. Yeah,

91
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:25,100
that's left click. I don't think, no, there's no controller plugged in. It's just my mouse.

92
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:39,129
I was spamming too. 10 second reaction time. Try right clicking. Hold on. Options.

93
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:50,179
Dirty full screen. Set keys. Set. Okay. Select. Left click, right? Yeah. Action. Space.

94
00:14:51,460 --> 00:15:05,860
Better be pressing. Well, why would it say left click? I guess I'm going to try to hit space.

95
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:17,509
It's also up, down, left, right as well. Well, I'll try space. God damn it. All right. I'll try

96
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:23,509
space. You better believe I'm going to try to make sure this, get this to work. You don't get

97
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:27,590
run over lengthwise by a car like that and not like play out at least some of the game. Are you

98
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:36,139
kidding me? No way. All right. Let me see what happens. The tutorial doesn't give you, it just

99
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:41,500
tells you, um, like the gist of the game. I read it already. All right. Can I skip this cut scene?

100
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:48,840
How do you skip cut scene? Escape. That's definitely a way to do it. Enter.

101
00:15:49,559 --> 00:16:02,779
It's tab. I mean, it's tab works. My home away from home. Right click. No, this is definitely

102
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:15,320
a way to do it. Looking good today. I'm going to see if space works. Pinhead. Why are you making

103
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:21,700
us watch this? I'm not making you watch this again. I'm trying the game's controls are not accurate.

104
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:40,549
Here's trouble. They were right. So now you can piss off sergeant. It's colonel. D F D.

105
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:48,629
The old man has a problem. He needs your help. Not interested. Bad news space. It involves law.

106
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:55,750
It doesn't work that I don't know what I'm going to do. It's not the game. Oh, should I like,

107
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,750
should I plug it to controller in? I think she's been kidnapped. Can't say more.

108
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,059
Falls have ears. If you're interested, meet me somewhere a little more private.

109
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:24,170
And let's see. Base rock in a hard place. Come on, please work. Please work. Bad news. All right.

110
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:32,759
It's space. It's fucking space. What is that meter at the top? I knew you'd make the right

111
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:40,819
choice. Okay, Colonel, this better be good. I hope I still get run over by a fucking truck.

112
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:49,319
I'm sure Laura would be impressed. I'm not here on a social visit.

113
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:55,000
There's so many cigarettes. Kruger's escaped. It's up to his old tricks. Laura was working

114
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,319
for us. She developed an antivirus formula. They kidnapped her before she could get it to us.

115
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:07,319
Tell me about the virus. The old man will do that. What matters is you want Laura. We want the

116
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:15,559
antivirus formula. Okay. No, that's not, that's not Nick Cage. What do you think, Jack? Can you

117
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:25,609
get it up for another? Fuck you. Yes. Fuck you. Yes. Fuck you. Yes. What just happened? I just

118
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:37,750
blacked out. Why did I black out? What was the point of blacking out? Oh, it's censored.

119
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,750
Get it. Split. What? Lemo. Get it. Lemo. Split. Lemo. Get it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

120
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,170
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. It's the elasticity of the Switch. It's

121
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,950
all the Switch. It's on the Nintendo Switch. It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen.

122
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,269
You should drink a big water. That's it. It's all Nintendo Switch now going to happen.

123
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,710
Things are looking up. No, they're not, no, they're not, they're

124
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,670
have to get out of this. It does three options. It's like, I'm playing a fucking Mario Party

125
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,750
game where I have to like hit the dice at the right time. Give me a break. That's weird.

126
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:14,660
I don't get out leave, leave, leave before I hit the escape button? Leave, run.

213
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:31,599
was not the right decisions probably break yeah yeah okay what if I hit gas

214
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:44,000
here's what the other option this game is having a nightmare it is gonna have

215
00:36:44,000 --> 00:37:14,559
a nightmare it's break break is the right play we're gonna get the same

216
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:38,960
ending it's my lucky day you smoke gas this is outrageous is brave the way Jack

217
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:46,400
would watch it be ashes to ashes dust to dust what was the budget for this game I

218
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,599
don't know but the crazy story about this game is that you weren't here in

219
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:58,079
the very beginning this game was never released it it was done filming and I

220
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,360
don't know if they've ran the studio ran out of money or something but it was

221
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,940
never actually released a new company came in and kind of remastered all the

222
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:12,489
footage and restored it it's the only reason why we're playing it today okay

223
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:26,820
it's a break break all it's because it was in a Jaguar right and the console

224
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:47,010
we're not arguing about McDonald's or Wendy's we're talking about life and

225
00:38:47,010 --> 00:39:07,159
death here I know we're gonna be great friends right yes there we go okay we're

226
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:22,610
good on to the next sequence what are you waiting for let's go okay what is

227
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:36,880
this pretty tight security this is the lab why would I just walk to the front

228
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:55,000
door like a fucking sim that's a neighbor what are you doing oh what are

229
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:10,340

231
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:27,010
where's Laura everything in good time hey well I think I think I'm gonna try

232
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:33,880
to like melt me into the into the chemical that has one fatal design can

233
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:45,070
you guess what that is Russia Los Angeles is built on near desert what

234
00:40:45,070 --> 00:41:01,000
try another 10 CC oh if someone were to say for instance here that was a fake

235
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,119
hand sitting there was a rubber hand I will release my virus into the system

236
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:15,809
within minutes the disease will ripple out exponents it will be the greatest

237
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:22,619
biological conquest of all boys in the waters I no longer have to remove this

238
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:26,980
primitive but clever oh that's why they're drinking the water out of the

239
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:55,329
big bottles another failed attempt oh sadistic bastard I got ready to turn and

240
00:41:55,329 --> 00:42:11,219
fight oh no I'm gonna get like tortured what information do I have anyways I'm

241
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:34,329
just like an agent that's Laura Jack it was a story recap so far I was in

242
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:38,449
retirement I came out of retirement to solve this madman poisoning the water

00:42:38,449 --> 00:43:03,849
supply done already on my case what oh no they took away the light that bulb is

244
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:13,289

00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:18,369
all right right right here pin the guard here the guard do the medical solid I'm

246
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:41,119
sick I have diarrhea what well something anti-virus formula has an air yeah yeah

247
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:48,360
he's gonna get crushed what would you open the door without like a weapon yeah

want we're gonna help you with oh yeah they told me never to do one thing I

250
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:00,039
forget what it was I think it was don't ever open this fucking door when people

251
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:11,480
are in it that wasn't even cartoon logic that was like they had a whole scene and

252
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,880
like they had like that the scene they threw the whole scene away and they had

253
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,780
to get an extra to be that guy like there was like a full ten minutes of

254
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:27,000
dialogue there left right left that was a reshoot left right they had a whole

255
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:55,099
sequence with a guard oh shit they went left oh god oh here we go oh no don't

256
00:44:55,099 --> 00:45:09,690
push her into the way sound effect if you type in punch sound effect on YouTube

257
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:17,760
right now that's the first that's exactly the first one I have not had a

258
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,730
decision to make they're just doing it on their own the AI is just picking

259
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:36,809
direction left right oh god left right right that'll do holy shit she's running

260
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:47,670
way faster than me and she's in heels that's crazy left right oh my god I've

261
00:45:47,670 --> 00:46:07,760
no idea let's go left right was the same guy this guy again we're gonna okay

262
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,969
we're gonna see this guy again like that's the wrong way I think if you make

263
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:17,090
the wrong decision you go in the circle you see that guy every time we're gonna

264
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:41,460
see him again right left right right that'll do we're about to loop again is

265
00:46:41,460 --> 00:47:10,840
that guy gonna get up again can I just shoot that guy left right not again all

266
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:16,019
right there's no way that guy comes back another time it's not possible you

267
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:20,820
understand it's not possible that guy's back he flew off of a balcony like 15

268
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:46,829
no way look I need to know right I have no that guy's still alive somebody's

284
00:50:59,619 --> 00:51:09,469
guy and grab the gun last time all right what do you think ones in the chat to

285
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:12,429
just go from that checkpoint and try it to keep going or two in the chat if you

286
00:51:12,429 --> 00:51:22,559
want to start the game over and go different route that looks pretty that

287
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:29,179
looks pretty unanimously one all right let's go sadistic bastard okay so this

288
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:34,809
time I'm not gonna shoot grab the gun apparently where's Laura

289
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:46,059
shoot me and you'll never see okay don't shoot kill him later kill him later

290
00:51:46,059 --> 00:52:01,059
later they still put him with a good dog so what I don't I just don't kill

291
00:52:01,059 --> 00:52:14,179
care about having the weapon bar is a fight or flight meter yeah the more it's

292
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:18,969
on the right side it's aggression the more it's on the left running right we

293
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,530
have to do this again I need to play through this game one more time at least

294
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:31,500

295
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:40,579
try the hairpin

296
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:47,739
me and every other girl you bump into you overestimate how many past they shot

apparently a lot of footage all right let's try hairpin I'm sorry it's so loud

298
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,619

343
01:03:58,409 --> 01:04:03,309

348
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:35,349
looking for this I don't know I've been infected we selling your body is gonna

349
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:40,590
mutate you're gonna be another one of dr. Kruger's mindless zombies a few

350
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:54,750
seconds you'll be my own personal can you say that again a plane drover ruined

351
01:05:54,750 --> 01:06:18,900

352
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:29,340
minutes take it away didn't he say a few seconds that turned into a few

353
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:40,429
minutes is this the lose did I lose within three minutes Los Angeles will

354
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:53,969

356
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:49,650
shoot him from up here oh I hope the checkpoints really close I thought I

357
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:54,019
was gonna snipe him from all the way back there that would have been so

358
01:07:54,019 --> 01:08:20,619
funny oh I was right at the checkpoint good very good yeah it's it's not I think

359
01:08:20,619 --> 01:08:24,140
it's time for this guy to go back to the drawing board mojo Jojo tried this like

360
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:45,699
three times already I god damn it all right whatever it's all right it's all

361
01:08:45,699 --> 01:08:50,220
right we have to watch this whole thing again all right this time I'm gonna who

362
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:58,810
should I shoot I point the gun at Hoover who should I point the gun at then not

363
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:02,250
the barrels right I thought the barrels is a great idea I'm gonna shoot the

364
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:05,890
barrel which is gonna destroy everything and everyone's gonna get the virus or

365
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:08,409
whatever all over them right that was like okay but then the guy just came

366
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:13,659
behind me the extra came behind me and hit me in the head so I was supposed to

367
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:18,199
know that was gonna happen it's gonna take it's gonna take oh god it's gonna

368
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:23,229
take forever yeah I'm gonna aim at Hoover that's a good idea

369
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:41,329
give it I don't I can't you can't get cutscenes I don't get down there I told

370
01:09:41,329 --> 01:09:45,050
you to stay someplace safe you need to watch this every time I think we'll get

371
01:09:45,050 --> 01:10:09,720
it this time skip no way not in a hundred million years let's go all right

372
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:14,199

375
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:44,300
very excited yeah I said the guy looks like Joe Biden no it looks like it looks

376
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:48,939
like somebody took young Joe Biden and put them in one of those agify apps to

377
01:10:48,939 --> 01:11:16,220
make old Joe Biden that's what it looks like all right we got to aim at this guy

378
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:25,020
go after him I feel like we'll probably get another decision guns don't even

379
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:36,119
have barrels really bringing the crane well it gets the same message

380
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:51,039
don't screw this up I don't want to watch the first five minutes of every

381
01:11:51,039 --> 01:12:13,680
RTS phase no I don't want to watch this don't have much time okay here we go

382
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:34,979
Hoover construction complete building building construction complete unit lost

01:13:22,449 --> 01:13:28,329
the goon I know I'm I don't care about him he's nothing to me kill him it has

388
01:13:28,329 --> 01:13:39,970
to be the main guy what can I even get to the main guy I damn it that's so

389
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:56,500
funny has to be a way to skip I really don't think there is it's space I don't

390
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:06,939
know I don't think it is yeah hey yeah this is very important to remember this

391
01:14:06,939 --> 01:14:25,289
is 25 years old it's 25 years old how old are these actors now the craziest

392
01:14:25,289 --> 01:14:33,890
part is the main character recorded voice lines with this remaster so how

393
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:38,689
old is the main character here probably in his I want to say probably the 40s

394
01:14:38,689 --> 01:14:44,979
maybe early 40s probably so this this person the actor might actually be in

395
01:14:44,979 --> 01:15:01,279
their late 60s into early 70s late 30s early 40s yeah that's another thing spam

396
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:10,600
every button no it doesn't do anything I'm telling you there is no skip he's

397
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:26,130
George Bush from that's my bush it was on Comedy Central he's almost as old as

398
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:40,119
you are now no I forgot about that's my bush yeah that was correct me if I'm

399
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:44,600
wrong but that was Trey Parker and Matt Stone made that show or at least Trey

400
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:50,520
Parker did South Park guys I think it was only live for like four episodes or

401
01:15:50,560 --> 01:16:07,220
like six episodes goodbye Hoover goodbye Kruger here we go don't screw this up

402
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:18,289
Bill Murray is on the crane pay attention what Bill Murray pay attention

403
01:16:18,289 --> 01:16:28,340
how preparing the virus somebody said I missed Bill Murray both times well I'm

404
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:40,199
not gonna miss him this time you said he's on the crane Bill Murray on the

405
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:47,279
crane so ready of over anticipating this I feel like it's not gonna be as funny

406
01:16:47,279 --> 01:17:24,310
as you said it was okay where is he brain is the big moment that's not even

407
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:29,939
that's not even close it's his face is so pixelated in what this that's just a

408
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:33,819
guy that's just a guy with like Bill Murray hair actually hold on a minute

409
01:17:33,819 --> 01:17:42,159
don't have much time that was actually pretty close that you okay here we go I

410
01:17:43,050 --> 01:18:02,609
gotta be ready Kruger what if none of them are correct

414
01:18:38,329 --> 01:18:44,539
been proven that he's bulletproof remember I tried to shoot him earlier

415
01:18:44,539 --> 01:18:59,199
but now it's go for him I forgot that was a second choice here you did Hoover

416
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:05,210
last time no I tried to shoot him from down here I grabbed his gun I tried to

417
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:12,979
aim up at him and he shot her in the head

418
01:19:12,979 --> 01:19:24,470
with dr. Krueger's newest brain looking for this what you want

419
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:31,149
it's still a little bit in there I just picked that thing up and just start

420
01:19:31,149 --> 01:19:36,069
going I would start inhaling right because you'd get like the vapors and

421
01:19:36,069 --> 01:19:40,800
might help a little every cell in your body is gonna mutate gonna be another

422
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:53,149
one of dr. Krueger's mindless on me yeah or like just touch a little bit of the

423
01:19:53,149 --> 01:19:56,710
wetness and get it like in your mucus membranes just put your fingers in

424
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:59,229
your nose all the way back and try to get it in there it get absorbed in your

425
01:19:59,229 --> 01:20:19,710
mucus membranes I really don't want to have to view this whole thing again so

426
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:31,869
this better be right did Hoover last time no I didn't I tried to shoot up at

427
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:35,750
Kruger I was like I'm gonna shoot him from here and I aimed down sights and he

428
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:39,310

440
01:23:27,819 --> 01:23:30,779
the other times where I've picked a decision where it was like oh go get

guys there's been choices where he just had a gun in his pocket and he didn't

443
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:47,029
have it there before I think the game was showing me its hand

444
01:23:47,029 --> 01:23:54,770
remember when I picked go for go to Hoover he fucking just was in mid tackle

445
01:23:54,770 --> 01:24:09,119
after hiding behind a bush whatever the fuck was over there the game gaslit you

446
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:31,060
oh god damn it please tell me that no okay so to me fight would have been

447
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:40,220
stupid but oh grab the the plot device of the entire game but how am I gonna

448
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:45,380
fight a guy when I'm hanging from a ledge like that you don't plot device

449
01:24:45,380 --> 01:25:04,210
plot device plot device plot device I've clicked the plot device put something

450
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:10,420
up distract us I have I have a really big apology here for you if I click out

451
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:17,590
of the window the game pauses and cannot play we have to work again this is gonna

452
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:23,430
be a bitch I can turn it down all right I turned it down we're gonna talk about

453
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:33,800
for like two minutes what should we talk about you need well you get to see bill

454
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:42,699
yeah you'll see bill Murray again that's cool that's pretty cool stuff what I

455
01:25:42,699 --> 01:25:57,890
have a breakfast I had a coffee and then I had nothing else I don't eat it's hard

456
01:25:57,890 --> 01:26:04,109
to eat breakfast when I get up in the morning and going all the way into the

457
01:26:04,109 --> 01:26:10,159
early afternoon I can't eat anything thought of eating breakfast a lot of

458
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:16,539
times make me kind of like nauseous I'm just not ready for food the first three

459
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:28,329
four hours when I get up but coffee that I can do I usually eat lunch lunch some

460
01:26:28,329 --> 01:26:34,289
kind of snack some kind of small mid late kind of afternoon meal and then I do

461
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:45,239
dinner breakfast is overrated anyways I mean breakfast is incredibly important

462
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:52,300
your body needs fuel to burn so you can function it's important to do something

463
01:26:52,300 --> 01:27:01,659
you have any hue I actually don't have any heels left smoothies are good yeah

464
01:27:01,659 --> 01:27:17,989
that's that's a good idea you're being played by big breakfast okay let me get

01:27:17,989 --> 01:27:24,960
this remember this drum Hoover fight drum Hoover fight drum Hoover fight

466

drum Hoover fight the essential breakfast breakfast thing is legit just

467
01:27:40,560 --> 01:28:02,460
Kellogg's propaganda well I mean if you if you eat just like sugary cereals all

468
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:13,340
right here we go a lot of cereals are just cotton candy with vitamin powder

469
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:28,960
sprinkled all over it pretty much the same thing Kruger Hoover drums drums I

470
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:42,899
feel like that would be a great Skrillex intro I mean don't shoot the drum call

471
01:28:42,939 --> 01:29:02,920
them off or you're dead mods aren't allowed to minus 2 me in this channel by

royalty-free movie night well this is my own personal this is pretty much not

476
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:22,220
royalty-free but it's a game from Hoover fight all right let's go for it

477
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:27,819

480
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:30,039
he said scuff scuff Biden versus scuff bush all right here we go now there's no

481
01:31:30,039 --> 01:31:43,340
other choices to make I wish you'd just shoot him now I just realized they just

482
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:53,310
did the Roger Rabbit routine same exact scenario that of the acid the juice dip

483
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:58,229
weasel falls over laughing hits the thing and it moves came out first

484
01:31:58,229 --> 01:32:02,270

485
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:23,899
25 years old all right here we go don't screw this up dip was Monka s Christopher

486
01:32:23,899 --> 01:32:29,300
Lloyd as the judge is one of one of my favorite acting my favorite characters

487
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:33,300
ever he's just so good in that role it was unbelievably good if you have not

488
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:51,520
seen who frame Roger Rabbit it's required reading for this stream okay

489
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:56,239
fight this is it this is where we actually get this correct fight there's

490
01:32:56,239 --> 01:33:06,210
not a third option right let me just double check rabbit rabbit fight fight

491

499
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:08,560

506
01:36:19,739 --> 01:36:24,789
first bait is this is gonna be a bitch I'm gonna turn this down because I can't

507

516
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:05,250
about me so I'll be able to fight and you do the annoying annoying orange sound

517
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:21,319
I'm ignoring whom what am I ignoring are you a furry answer the question no I'm

518
01:38:21,319 --> 01:38:27,399
not there you go is that is that's matter of fact for you isn't it should

519
01:38:27,399 --> 01:38:34,399
be matter of fact for you somebody said this is just golden eye except

520
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:50,149
everything sucks don't you love it though I'm so glad that we get to like see this

521
01:38:50,149 --> 01:39:06,149
and experience this time harvester meets James Bond harvester was fucked I would

522
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:17,420
not play that game a second time all right let's start the process here get

523
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:30,779
the audio back where it should be all right let's go I didn't realize the run

524
01:39:30,779 --> 01:40:02,279
he screams run at the people drum Kruger Hoover drum from over fight yet so it's

525
01:40:02,279 --> 01:40:06,590
Hoover and if there's something afterwards again I have to remind myself

526
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:11,520
a thousand times it's fight if there's another choice is therefore I would have

527
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:33,319
taken the antidote marijuana is a memory loss drug I'm not high that would have

528
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:55,189
been a huge mistake for this dream these serious okay don't get it wrong

529
01:40:55,189 --> 01:41:00,229
every cell in your body is gonna mutate you're gonna be another one of dr. Kruger's

530
01:41:00,229 --> 01:41:11,779
minor zombies what if get it is wrong then that's not my fault because you all

531
01:41:11,779 --> 01:41:16,739
we all have come to a consensus here that I need to get it when it's on the

532
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:23,409
ground because otherwise I turn into the zombie

533
01:41:23,409 --> 01:41:31,109
exothermic reaction is gonna multiply that virus me a pole we get a short pole

534
01:41:31,109 --> 01:41:37,909
as to what I should do on the second after I fight the first time and a pull

535
01:41:37,909 --> 01:41:40,989
I need cuz I if I'm gonna be wrong I need a bunch of people to be wrong too

536
01:41:40,989 --> 01:41:52,489
so we can all be wrong together so I don't feel as bad fight or get on the

537
01:41:52,489 --> 01:42:00,539
second attempt and one that we just died at we go within three minutes Los

538
01:42:00,539 --> 01:42:14,149
Angeles will be mine perhaps you might enjoy sharing do a prediction it's good

539
01:42:14,149 --> 01:42:38,960
prediction to take too long okay Hoover Hoover Kruger all right that was a

540
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:54,659
perfect opportunity for a will Wilhelm Wilhelm okay fight what do we got 80%

541
01:42:54,659 --> 01:43:30,670
yet so if I'm wrong you're wrong too this guy shoots so many bullets like I

542
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:43,340
probably gonna throw in a rock and hit me easier than his shooting okay fight

543
01:43:43,380 --> 01:44:23,409
right yeah I swear to God if it's not like rabbit fight there we go I am so

544
01:44:23,409 --> 01:44:28,210

01:46:15,329 --> 01:46:31,449
you may well have saved us all why does why does Laura not get a medal

550
01:46:31,449 --> 01:46:42,039
sometimes it's all worth what was what was Laura not get a medal for that he

551
01:46:42,039 --> 01:46:50,760
sponsored her like kill count at the end there was like fucking 30 people I can't

552
01:46:50,760 --> 01:47:09,520
do that without her that's cool we need an alternate ending all right I am

553
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:13,760
willing to play through one and not play through I just want to there's some

554
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:22,069
stuff early that I really want to see there's a lot of other shit that we

555
01:47:22,069 --> 01:47:44,770
need to know where it goes play I always start from the beginning oh shit I can do

556
01:47:44,770 --> 01:47:53,720
this checkpoint locked all this somebody locked checkpoints alright I'm not doing

557
01:47:53,720 --> 01:48:00,979
party party torturing 14,000 people this is some of the most fun I've had in a

558
01:48:00,979 --> 01:48:07,199
while what are you talking about I love this I'm loving this all right let's go

560
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:31,279
mean I can I not start at the other ones I'm gonna do party but I'm gonna

561
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:57,859
censor the screen to make sure it's okay my home away from home crystals

562
01:48:57,859 --> 01:49:01,020
looking good it actually censored this re-release the original game did have

563
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:18,560
nudity interesting okay voiceover lines were not in the original no no way the

564
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:25,069
actor actually came back to rerecord them I'm surprised they didn't port this

565
01:49:25,069 --> 01:49:30,760
to something else here's trouble this whole thing was done even if it was not

566
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:34,319
on the Jaguar why would they not they were right so now you can piss off Sega

567
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:41,680
Saturn or something take a CD it's Colonel BFD the old man has a problem

568
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:55,079
not interested it involves Laura and a dangerous mind control virus shit we

01:49:58,439 --> 01:50:03,159
walls have ears if you're interested meet me somewhere a little more private

571
01:50:03,159 --> 01:50:09,319

572
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:18,359
ESRB rock in a hard place like real people on camera like naked I think that

573
01:50:18,359 --> 01:50:26,149

02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:24,210
or your hatchet Institute was founded by a Nobel prize-winning scientist who

658
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:28,970
disappeared in the late 50s leaving the place deserted for nearly 30 years

659
02:11:28,970 --> 02:11:42,310
and turned the knob okay doors locked knock on the door look under the mat it's

stairs I paused to see if I was being oh I hate this I was I hate this okay run

something I dragged me to a cellar below der hatchet manner okay I lost a health

672
02:13:24,369 --> 02:13:29,930
as I struggled to clear my head I clicked on my flashlight and looked

673
02:13:29,930 --> 02:13:34,729
around any fool could see that the place had more than its share of ding

02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:47,920
the feeling that I was at the end of my rope wait am I dead I was I was fit to

681

685
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:34,039
this I'm gonna do something clever I was trying to think of a diversion when I

686
02:15:34,039 --> 02:15:47,689
started to slip away as the rope bit into my neck what do I do wait I didn't do

687

laughing boy okay make good use of the rope take the candle and go uh take

689
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:16,869
I grabbed a candle and headed out a sudden breeze blew out my candle and I

690
02:16:16,869 --> 02:16:23,859
could barely make out my surroundings in the darkness I should have taken the

691
02:16:23,859 --> 02:16:32,209
rope or something use your last match go look for another candle uh match don't

695
02:16:54,399 --> 02:17:01,510
someone or something was sitting across the attic from me at long last the

696
02:17:01,510 --> 02:17:09,309
detective decides to pay a visit to his host have you enjoyed our hospitality so

697
02:17:09,309 --> 02:17:18,069

you now haunt the halls of your hatchet Institute and the case remains unsolved

706
02:18:29,559 --> 02:18:33,639

707
02:18:33,639 --> 02:18:40,860
investigation yeah we got gum shoot got the we got gum overconfidence was your

if I sneak I probably can as I ascended the rotting stairs I began to feel as if

734
02:21:50,030 --> 02:22:01,229
I were being followed from the top of the stairs I could see a woman below okay

735
02:22:01,229 --> 02:22:14,559
I don't have a weapon holy water use the holy water her skin erupted as the water

736
02:22:14,559 --> 02:22:25,760
splashed on the stench was awful the second floor looked dark and uninviting

737
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:34,059
okay that was a waste I don't know if I could have got away check on her

738
02:22:34,059 --> 02:22:39,020
condition run into the nearest room right I don't you have so much there's

739
02:22:39,020 --> 02:22:47,340
not enough time my fear faded as I fled I felt fine till I fell so I flipped over

740
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:52,780
and found I'd been followed by a fanged femme fatale with a fried finger it's

741
02:22:52,780 --> 02:23:01,540
her use the vial of holy water I don't do I have it kick her teeth out oh I

742
02:23:01,540 --> 02:23:07,209
don't still have any left it wasn't till I cut my hand on the broken glass that I

743
02:23:07,209 --> 02:23:21,319
realized that the bottle of holy water wasn't shatter proof I just well here we

744
02:23:21,319 --> 02:23:26,639
go again I don't know how long I was out but someone or something had dragged me

745
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:32,770
to a cellar below der Hatchet manor is this guy as I struggled to clear my head

746
02:23:32,770 --> 02:23:37,209
I clicked on my flashlight and looked around which disappeared after the

747
02:23:37,209 --> 02:23:41,850
fool could see that the place had more than its share of dingbats and I was no

748
02:23:41,850 --> 02:23:52,680
exception find who dragged you in here explode go looking for trouble find who

749
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:58,840
dragged you here I don't I think these are all the same thing it was there in

750
02:23:58,840 --> 02:24:03,920
the cellar that I discovered the little man with the evil grin what's the

751
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:07,729
correct play here

752
02:24:20,459 --> 02:24:24,819
okay stay for dinner all right so now what are the choices don't lunge at him

753
02:24:24,819 --> 02:24:33,639
grab his shovel glance past him say don't turn around and you bait him he

754
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:40,440
fell for it so I took the opportunity to bash him in the chops I never hit a man

755
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:44,799
when he's down but I knew I should have made an exception when I felt his

756
02:24:44,799 --> 02:24:53,590
fingers on my throat you can't be serious

757
02:24:55,590 --> 02:24:58,549
I have to flip that second option is not gonna do anything

758
02:24:59,549 --> 02:25:05,950
I flipped him into his coal bin and ran into the darkness

759
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:15,360
shovel and be like you know I don't hit a person when they're down even if

760
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:23,260
they're a degenerate murdering zombie person find an elevator find the

761
02:25:23,260 --> 02:25:34,260
elevator I found myself ascending a steep circular stairway when a green

762
02:25:34,299 --> 02:25:41,020
ghoul in a rented tuxedo made a dramatic entrance these people just went to the

763
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:45,219
Halloween store and bought everything on the rack and then just decided to shoot

764
02:25:45,219 --> 02:25:49,239
stuff with it and they made choices around it they were just having a they

765
02:25:49,239 --> 02:25:54,489
just having like fun for like a weekend let's make some small talk see if it

766
02:25:54,489 --> 02:26:00,629
works I approached the zombie reluctant took his hat off and asked him who his

767
02:26:00,629 --> 02:26:07,430
Taylor was his response was to push me backwards into a rickety old freight

768
02:26:07,430 --> 02:26:22,440
elevator he took his hat off like oh it's me hello oh floor surprise me um

769
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:33,219

770
02:26:33,219 --> 02:26:43,579
piano music coming from somewhere piano music this is it could be anything I

771
02:26:43,579 --> 02:26:53,979
have no idea um enter the room on the left the room was crawling with vermin

772
02:26:53,979 --> 02:27:03,809
but otherwise empty but they're so cute they just have that is vibing leave him

773
02:27:03,809 --> 02:27:16,670
alone follow the rats yeah they know what they're doing the next room I came

774
02:27:16,670 --> 02:27:22,440
to had nothing in it there was an old freezer on one side and a wall full of

775
02:27:22,479 --> 02:27:30,649
potions on the other Frank one of the random potions just as I started to

776
02:27:30,649 --> 02:27:48,000
examine them I heard a scream okay find a place to hide open the freezer I'm

777
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:54,540
putting the fewers in the freezer open the freezer be only to find another

778
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:59,719
prisoner of this horrible place

779
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:20,520
we have to keep this guy alive

780
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:31,120
you wouldn't have a car by any chance you wouldn't be going to your Fresno

781
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:42,520
area Fresno's really not that far he was unfortunately an obnoxious jerk who

782
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:46,760
didn't have anything intelligent off money or a cigarette you thought what a

783
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:50,840
jerk it's remarkably still alive what are you talking about this guy could

784
02:28:50,840 --> 02:28:55,200
probably help see what he knows about the house what do you know about the

785
02:28:55,200 --> 02:29:01,440
house you've been here probably for a while oh shit the fumes

786
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:20,959
wouldn't let me go this is a monster this might be a monster in the house

787
02:29:20,959 --> 02:29:32,180
maybe this is not a person I give him five bucks I gave him five dollars and

788
02:29:32,860 --> 02:29:45,420
okay leave this loony bin behind search remaining rooms search remaining rooms

789
02:29:45,420 --> 02:29:55,659
that actually might have been a monster to the next room I heard the scream

790
02:29:55,659 --> 02:30:09,729
again take the source of the scream we have to know we have to know returning

791
02:30:09,729 --> 02:30:22,709
to the hall I glanced up to where the sound came from Jesus see run away right

792
02:30:22,709 --> 02:30:30,459
but I don't know see what he does next run see what he does

793
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:47,360
so I backed up and gave him plenty of room fell on his head I don't but what

794
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:52,280
if what if he's not hostile I don't we might not be hostile the loony was

795
02:30:52,280 --> 02:31:09,430
wearing a straight jacket how yeah but you know you never know

796
02:31:09,430 --> 02:31:16,430
I was at the end of my rope when I realized that I was I was fit to be

797
02:31:17,030 --> 02:31:22,639
all right so we got this right last time we have to like tie this guy up or

798
02:31:22,639 --> 02:31:47,239
something this was no time for reflection if I didn't stream I would

799
02:31:47,239 --> 02:31:53,750
probably be this guy like if I was in a streamer or did YouTube or something I

800
02:31:54,639 --> 02:32:00,799
would have probably been that guy at some point something clever I was trying

801
02:32:00,799 --> 02:32:10,500
to think of a diversion when I lost this was the right thing last thing hits him

802

second floor look dark and uninviting pick a room at random find the kitchen

822
02:35:26,809 --> 02:35:40,219
the room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort great job finding

823
02:35:40,219 --> 02:35:46,000
the kitchen there is there was a door to my left another dead ahead but most of

824
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:50,319
the action was taking place in the kitchen on my right someone was

825
02:35:50,319 --> 02:36:03,610
practicing a bizarre form of culinary preparation right let's go right let's

826
02:36:03,610 --> 02:36:08,909
see I couldn't put my finger on it but there was something odd about the woman

827
02:36:08,909 --> 02:36:22,049
in the kitchen I think maybe it was her three-day beard okay grab some food and

828
02:36:22,049 --> 02:36:37,590
go can I look in the fridge oh it's Edna fine a find the edibles find the

829
02:36:37,590 --> 02:36:42,540
edibles everybody on this house is on him might as well join a clove of

830
02:36:42,540 --> 02:36:53,680
garlic and a couple of potatoes definitely take the garlic and shove

831
02:36:53,680 --> 02:37:09,319
that down the boss's throat of garlic okay I'm gonna leave sneak away quietly I

832
02:37:09,319 --> 02:37:14,280
don't want to do anything else out of the kitchen and left her to her work a

833
02:37:14,280 --> 02:37:24,059
faint breeze carried a musty odor to my sensitive nostrils okay well over to the

834
02:37:24,059 --> 02:37:27,579
closed door okay we're gonna peek through that I'm not going in there just

835
02:37:27,579 --> 02:37:36,920
yet this room seemed to be a laboratory there was something odd about it and

836
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:46,549
then I realized what it was the room suddenly I realized that someone was

837
02:37:46,549 --> 02:37:55,760
coming up behind me the vampire see the teeth jump in the tub and quickly jump

838
02:37:55,760 --> 02:38:02,520
in the tub thinking quickly I stepped into the shower and pulled the curtain

839
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:12,200
closed a hairy paw reached in and turned on the water I peered around the

840
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:18,840
corner and saw a she wolf busily primping herself for a night on the town

841
02:38:18,840 --> 02:38:32,659
this is such a crack game it really is what do I do ah I don't know I'm not

hypnotic effect there's only one person that's really tried to hurt me everyone

910
02:50:03,129 --> 02:50:09,270
next room I heard the scream again this guy we just do avoid this do not go

911
02:50:09,270 --> 02:50:16,500

912
02:50:16,500 --> 02:50:22,649
up I ran through the door and found myself near the elevator okay up I

913
02:50:22,649 --> 02:50:28,530
pushed the button and waited there was a green door to my left and a stairway to

914
02:50:28,530 --> 02:50:41,040
my right wait for the elevator but what if he comes out let's find the green

915
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:48,340
door I walked over and opened the green door well the last thing I remember is

916
02:50:48,340 --> 02:51:02,059
staring at the hole in his chest where a steak should have been oh come on come

917
02:51:02,139 --> 02:51:08,819
on I came to in an attic someone or something was sitting across the attic

918
02:51:08,819 --> 02:51:28,020
from me I wonder this way I can it was difficult not to listen his voice had a

919
02:51:28,020 --> 02:51:37,090
strong hypnotic effect maybe maybe it's too small maybe he didn't take it okay

920
02:51:37,090 --> 02:51:49,469
yeah I don't know you I love this cause I know you each time you lapse in

921
02:51:49,469 --> 02:51:58,069
consciousness I get to know you a little better come sit drink with me it's

922
02:51:58,069 --> 02:52:04,870
something I picked out close to your heart that was my blood he was sucking

923
02:52:04,870 --> 02:52:15,940
on okay uh should I offer him a bribe that's the only thing I haven't

924
02:52:15,940 --> 02:52:34,920
my pockets were empty I love this guy this was count your Chakonsky I knew I

925
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:39,879
had failed when I looked into his eyes I was powerless to resist him

926
02:52:39,879 --> 02:52:53,260
all right I'm gonna try this one more time come on at least well I opened the

927
02:52:53,260 --> 02:52:58,780
green door and it was okay like I choose your adventure game there's a reason

928
02:52:58,780 --> 02:53:04,379
why you hold your finger on the previous page because open door on right guy

929
02:53:04,379 --> 02:53:08,360
kills you you know that's okay well fuck that I'm not doing that one and you keep

930
02:53:08,360 --> 02:53:19,940
your hand your finger on the tab you go back and you choose the right one you're

931
02:53:19,940 --> 02:53:38,819
cheating at books that's not cheating it's not cheating there's still so much

932
02:53:38,819 --> 02:53:46,290
stuff okay where do I what am I doing wrong there's a lot more in this game

933
02:53:46,290 --> 02:53:57,200
that I really thought there was all right one more try holy water and then

934
02:53:57,200 --> 02:54:06,479
we're gonna leave he wanted money all right your best but it was for a good

935
02:54:06,479 --> 02:54:15,750
cause okay it's nice to see you the okay don't send in the next client it's the

936
02:54:16,350 --> 02:54:41,030
you so I'm gone under the mat of course naturally there was a key to the back of

937
02:54:41,030 --> 02:54:50,010
my neck okay now what over my shoulder is the girl explore the room everything

938
02:54:50,010 --> 02:54:56,959
is the girl I think the candlelit room should be okay the room was crawling

939
02:54:56,959 --> 02:55:01,719
with vermin but otherwise empty she follows oh god damn it she follows you

940
02:55:01,760 --> 02:55:06,270
both times he follows you in both scenarios I don't think you can avoid

941
02:55:06,270 --> 02:55:20,590
this wait explain I can't run I could sense that she was attracted to me what

942
02:55:20,590 --> 02:55:31,959
run tell her she has nice eyes what I don't understand what do you if I hadn't

943
02:55:31,959 --> 02:55:36,000
been so busy talking I might have noticed what why isn't a run really

944
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:42,629
listening I can't believe there's not oh god damn it I could have avoided that

945
02:55:42,629 --> 02:55:47,030
alright there's one here's how you avoid that one you just have to go up the

946
02:55:47,030 --> 02:55:52,750
stairs and run as if you go to the candle I was out but someone or

947
02:55:52,750 --> 02:55:57,309
something had dragged me to a cellar below der Hatchet holy water works but

948
02:55:57,309 --> 02:56:01,670
she follows you up the stairs as I struggled to clear my head I clicked on

949
02:56:01,670 --> 02:56:11,870
my flashlight and looked around all right these are these all don't go look

950
02:56:11,870 --> 02:56:18,639
for trouble these all lead to the same place anyways it was there in the cellar

951
02:56:19,479 --> 02:56:28,219
so what's the correct thing with this guy don't turn around glance past him

952
02:56:28,219 --> 02:56:35,120
there's just glance past him but what if we don't attack he fell for it so I took

953
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:39,520
the opportunity to bash him in the chops he fell for me looking the other way I

954
02:56:39,520 --> 02:56:44,120
never hit a man when he's down but I knew I should have made an exception when

955
02:56:44,120 --> 02:56:52,969
I felt his fingers on my throat can you avoid this guy oh flip over backwards

956
02:56:52,969 --> 02:57:12,750
right I flipped him into his colbin and ran into the darkness he Egypt ology

957
02:57:12,750 --> 02:57:21,549
laundry look look for a stairway I don't think we did the stairway last time I

958
02:57:21,549 --> 02:57:32,049
found myself ascending a steep here's the guy with the hat when a green ghoul

959
02:57:32,290 --> 02:57:40,149
made a dramatic entrance I wonder if there's a wrong option with this guy

960
02:57:40,149 --> 02:57:52,079
proceed small I don't think it really matters let's just do small talk I

961
02:57:52,079 --> 02:58:00,700
approached the zombie I don't want to go I don't want to go down to the what if I

962
02:58:00,700 --> 02:58:12,090
say mind your own business that's the one option I did not do I could hear

963
02:58:12,090 --> 02:58:18,450
faint piano music coming from somewhere all right where's the steak kitchen I

964
02:58:18,450 --> 02:58:28,629
don't I don't remember where the kitchen is is it straight I'm getting so turned

965
02:58:28,629 --> 02:58:32,549
around like I don't even know what any of these options really go the next room

966
02:58:32,549 --> 02:58:37,430
I came to had nothing in it okay here we go there was an old freezer on one side

967
02:58:37,430 --> 02:58:45,790
and a wall full of potions on the other but that we want the steak one we gotta

968
02:58:45,790 --> 02:59:14,590
give this guy money what about those potion bottles I read the labels extra

969
02:59:14,590 --> 02:59:21,350
strength potion instant steak pill anti-grav tablets gravity I feel like the

970
02:59:21,350 --> 02:59:32,000
steak is the is the correct option steak I wasn't hungry now but an instant

971
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:40,399
steak might come in handy later stick to your ribs I gotta get up the stair

972
02:59:40,399 --> 02:59:51,799
okay well should I take the anti-gravity one to anti-grav tablets I noticed

973
02:59:51,799 --> 03:00:05,100
something strange from the moment I opened the jar get some strength stop

974
03:00:05,100 --> 03:00:09,020
get the I take the instant strength potion and run taking the extra strength

975
03:00:09,020 --> 03:00:15,020
I gotta get out of here like a good idea till I read the fine print oh god damn

976
03:00:15,139 --> 03:00:24,799
we're dead we're dead ask take a deep breath no run run run how do I get out

977
03:00:24,799 --> 03:00:32,959
run leave the fumes in the room no I'm trying to get out and consequently I oh

978
03:00:32,959 --> 03:00:45,270
come on so I blacked out well how was I gonna know that like it was there was a

979
03:00:46,270 --> 03:00:52,590
feeling that I was at the end of my rope the anti-gravity pills fly up I was fit

980
03:00:52,590 --> 03:01:08,120
to be I did the situation none of this matters I was trying to think of a

981
03:01:08,120 --> 03:01:23,579
diversion when I started to slip away as the rope bit into my neck okay let's

982
03:01:23,579 --> 03:01:32,190
get them make good use of the rope I told laughing boys to be out of

983
03:01:32,190 --> 03:01:39,600
circulation for a while but he didn't appreciate the gag okay so now from here

984
03:01:39,600 --> 03:01:45,549
look for a sign oh I don't think we clicked this yet I'm pretty sure this is

985
03:01:45,549 --> 03:02:00,559
one I have not done look for a sign I did I need like a piece of paper that

986
03:02:00,559 --> 03:02:04,819
has like the blueprint of this house it's just like teleporting around it's

987
03:02:04,819 --> 03:02:12,950
like how my brain cannot remember where I am oh let's go do this the next room

988
03:02:12,950 --> 03:02:16,950
contained an old writing desk under the derhatchet family we'll get points for

989
03:02:16,950 --> 03:02:26,059
getting rid of this on the desk were many items of interest decipher the

990
03:02:26,059 --> 03:02:31,780
cryptic rune and then that makes him come over and then we put it in the

991
03:02:31,780 --> 03:02:38,260
thing and we burn up the papers the candle lit itself and a funky phantom

992
03:02:38,260 --> 03:02:56,790
friar okay enjoy wine and candlelight I extinguished the candle in a glass of

993
03:02:57,790 --> 03:03:10,229
and the phantom friar gave up the ghost okay so from here was filled down I have

994
03:03:10,229 --> 03:03:17,479
the coins I need to find my way up to the second floor on the elevator look

995
03:03:17,479 --> 03:03:24,069

1000
03:04:19,190 --> 03:04:33,059
last score the room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort there

1001
03:04:33,059 --> 03:04:37,659
was a door I don't remember what time but most of the action was taking place

1002
03:04:37,659 --> 03:04:43,059
in the kitchen on my right where someone was practicing a bizarre form of here we

1003

03:08:52,219 --> 03:09:01,959
guard why can't I attack I came to in an attic someone or something was sitting

1037
03:09:01,959 --> 03:09:07,120
across the attic from me I have garlic and I have the steak pill and holy water

1038
03:09:07,120 --> 03:09:14,239
decides to pay a visit to his host oh well have you enjoyed our hospitality

1039
03:09:14,239 --> 03:09:20,200
so many 500 points it's fine at least we seduced the werewolf it was difficult

1040
03:09:20,200 --> 03:09:24,120
not to listen his voice had a strong hypnotic effect

1041
03:09:24,120 --> 03:09:32,979
I did it well let's just get as many I'm trying to get to 8,000 points you don't

1042
03:09:32,979 --> 03:09:41,379

shit that vampires are weak against holy water steaks with me garlic I couldn't

1044
03:09:48,780 --> 03:09:54,620

1045
03:09:54,620 --> 03:10:01,180
sucking on you have to this is guys this game came out like in 1984 1985 or

1046
03:10:01,180 --> 03:10:06,870
something find something of value I don't have anything quickly I checked my

1047
03:10:06,870 --> 03:10:18,280
pockets what is it what what's going on what's in my pocket

1048
03:10:18,280 --> 03:10:30,319
roll gold coin kick in the groin what should I do I tried to attack but count

1049
03:10:30,319 --> 03:10:36,659
your check on I can't do it into my eyes and I knew I had failed I blacked out

1050
03:10:36,659 --> 03:10:43,379
what would you pick the gold coins out why wouldn't you take why wouldn't

1051
03:10:43,379 --> 03:10:48,540
garlic it be an option why wouldn't the steak pill a holy water he didn't take

1052
03:10:48,540 --> 03:10:53,100
the shit out of my pockets this time I have coin where I throw a coin at him

1053
03:10:53,100 --> 03:10:59,350
why don't you give a coin because I want to try to kick the guy in the groin

1054
03:10:59,350 --> 03:11:05,879
alright this game came out in like 1992 are you serious you don't think it would

1055
03:11:05,879 --> 03:11:09,879
have been like a comedy routine where it's he goes like oh my oh my balls I

1056
03:11:09,879 --> 03:11:18,059
was going for like the stupid like 90s comedy routine this game came out in

1057
03:11:18,059 --> 03:11:29,780
2016 it wasn't yet but it wasn't filmed in 2016 it was filmed in probably like

1058
03:11:29,780 --> 03:11:48,020
1990 shit alright well that was fun game was made in 84 yeah come on well now

1059
03:11:48,059 --> 03:12:08,409
let's watch them well now we can see the music video wait did showing him dying

1060
03:12:08,409 --> 03:12:26,309
what the hell was that we didn't see any of this stuff we didn't get any of these

1061
03:12:26,309 --> 03:12:54,940
options behind the scenes yeah I think the skeleton guys mouth is partially

1062
03:12:54,940 --> 03:13:11,739
made from a baseball mitt is a physical wizard like cantaloupe no not really I

1063
03:13:11,739 --> 03:13:38,700
can't believe there's a wizard that can cast fireball at you play it again oh

1064
03:13:38,700 --> 03:13:52,469
you need to probably have the ace for that the thing with these old games

1065
03:13:52,469 --> 03:13:55,510
those you have to be so weirdly specific about everything to see some

1066
03:13:55,510 --> 03:14:33,860
of this stuff some random lady we saw that plenty of times wait was that the

1067
03:14:33,860 --> 03:14:48,799
real ending villain well that was fun actually in love with this game play

1068
03:14:48,799 --> 03:14:56,979
more play again use a walkthrough I could just use a walkthrough you look at

1069
03:14:56,979 --> 03:14:59,840
the respiration of a 16 millimeter film adaptation of the original interactive

1070
03:14:59,840 --> 03:15:04,739
text adventure designed wait this is an it's a text adventure that's why it

1071
03:15:04,739 --> 03:15:14,420
feels like this uh-huh over the chance to create a feature-length interactive

1072
03:15:14,420 --> 03:15:21,819
film I wanted to read that Empire's Wanted restoration that's really cool I

1073
03:15:21,819 --> 03:15:28,219
did not back-to-back games that just never released it's really interesting I

1074
03:15:28,219 --> 03:15:40,469
love this shit I really do it's kind of old-fashioned way to have the old 16

1075
03:15:40,469 --> 03:15:48,620
millimeter FMV games with all the weird goofy choices I love this shit

1076
03:15:50,319 --> 03:15:58,389
the people still make them now but the people make interactive movies right now

1077
03:15:58,389 --> 03:16:04,469
right there's been a few of them one more playthrough all right one more time

1078
03:16:04,469 --> 03:20:20,459
with I'm gonna get a walkthrough I'm gonna go pee though we're at that boys

1079
03:20:20,459 --> 03:20:29,020
and girls a little bit of an issue here we have a little bit of a small problem

1080
03:20:29,020 --> 03:20:37,520
here I don't think a walkthrough exists for this game I don't see any there are

1081
03:20:37,520 --> 03:20:52,159
no walkthroughs so that's bad make the walkthrough do you even go to the

1082
03:20:52,159 --> 03:21:01,459
bathroom I did I was promised to overwatch I don't I think you're in the

1083
03:21:01,459 --> 03:21:13,049
wrong place nobody's beaten this we'll help you you gotta be quick though you

1084
03:21:13,049 --> 03:21:16,649
gotta be really quick it's like two seconds it takes three seconds for the

1085
03:21:16,649 --> 03:21:19,329
stream delay to kick in for you guys to see what happened we're not gonna be

1086
03:21:19,329 --> 03:21:38,420
able to do it I can't elongate that slow your CPU down what if you alt tab does

1087
03:21:38,420 --> 03:21:47,780
actually let me test that let me see if this works if I like tab out will the

1088
03:21:47,780 --> 03:21:59,889
game stop no it just keeps going yeah it keeps going wait a minute wait a

1089
03:21:59,889 --> 03:22:05,489
minute wait a minute what if I had known this shit this would have been so much

1090
03:22:05,489 --> 03:22:14,530
better guys oh my god damn it take a look at this get a good view get a good

1091
03:22:14,530 --> 03:22:29,159
view the timer doesn't do anything when it gets to zero it's just points I was

1092
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:38,260
panicking half the time cuz I thought are you kidding me it's just what's your

1093
03:22:38,260 --> 03:22:48,409
score up higher well you can help let's figure this out together and this needs

1094
03:22:48,409 --> 03:22:56,270
to be unanimous so the obvious play here is I can't believe this I could have

1095
03:22:56,270 --> 03:23:04,219
whatever we're gonna meet the gentleman the priest wanted money all right give

1096
03:23:04,219 --> 03:23:08,020
us but it was for a good cause thank you mr. Spencer go to the orphanage

1097
03:23:08,020 --> 03:23:17,690
specter whatever your name is the not deductible okay so this just means a

1098
03:23:17,690 --> 03:23:22,809
lot of points mid points not I don't care if I get zero points I supposed to

1099
03:23:22,809 --> 03:23:29,350
the end of the game okay we do click maps click max is gonna take way too

1100
03:23:29,350 --> 03:23:41,319
long all right the obvious thing here is I have the holy water I don't want to

1101
03:23:41,319 --> 03:23:47,840
send in do click maps I don't even I don't even have it like installed we

1102
03:23:47,840 --> 03:23:56,090
can do quick polls how long does the poll take just give us two seconds to

1103
03:23:56,090 --> 03:23:58,969
click hold all right well then give me a second I gotta like enable it again

1104
03:23:58,969 --> 03:24:06,180
obviously I might not be able to do it no click map the shortest poll is one

1105
03:24:06,180 --> 03:24:13,139
minute that's much easier click okay to enable click maps have you guys click and

1106
03:24:13,139 --> 03:24:28,090
me disable it is like 45 seconds a B or C let's go the very obvious one I know

1107
03:24:28,090 --> 03:24:39,120
how to get here it's B I know how to get us into the room into the door the

1108
03:24:39,120 --> 03:24:44,280
Der Hatchet Institute was founded by a Nobel prize-winning scientist

1109
03:24:44,280 --> 03:24:52,430
this locked is what okay finally we have not done we've only done look under the

1110
03:24:52,430 --> 03:25:03,540
mat what do you guys want to do let's open it up why not well we'll do a full

1111
03:25:03,540 --> 03:25:15,139
chats choice run how does that sound and I look I can look at this as it's

1112
03:25:15,139 --> 03:25:21,459
coming in and yeah it's not gonna take 60 seconds look at 66% of the vote wants

1113
03:25:21,459 --> 03:25:27,059
me to go a so I could theoretically just once it once it becomes like a 50

1114
03:25:27,059 --> 03:25:31,840
to 60% majority I'm just gonna go can you just close the poll like if you

1115
03:25:31,840 --> 03:25:35,280
cancel the poll right now just close it like I know that's 67% of voted for a

1116
03:25:35,280 --> 03:25:42,790
and there's no way bees coming back I can just do it right yeah let's go that

1117
03:25:42,790 --> 03:25:56,280
works on another way inside as I walked around the house I saw an open window

1118
03:25:56,280 --> 03:26:02,200
high above me isn't that where the guy is I found a ladder leaning next to

1119
03:26:02,200 --> 03:26:14,040
another window okay I think that's where the guy is well there we go perfect so

1120
03:26:14,040 --> 03:26:18,940
after the poll is over it gives enough time after majority is seen they just

1121
03:26:18,940 --> 03:26:23,629
keep going that's perfect timing okay we can do the climb the ladder look

1122
03:26:23,629 --> 03:26:27,510
around explore the extensive grounds or move ladder to access the open window

1123
03:26:27,510 --> 03:26:33,049
I'm just gonna tell you I am under the impression here that I think that's the

1124
03:26:33,530 --> 03:26:42,620
the Count Dooku guy the gravest guy is up there this is extraordinarily

1125
03:26:42,620 --> 03:26:55,069
unanimous looks like we're gonna see I moved the ladder and started I hope it's

1126
03:26:55,069 --> 03:27:00,739
him I was halfway through the window looking at the ground below when I was

1127
03:27:00,739 --> 03:27:06,760
struck from above by what felt like a Louisville slugger the gorilla covering

1128
03:27:06,760 --> 03:27:17,979
above me was a bat from the big leagues push its face in swing for the fences

1129
03:27:17,979 --> 03:27:26,030
or maintain a safe distance I doubt any of these work if I'm gonna be honest

1130
03:27:26,030 --> 03:27:39,139
with you a bat from the big leagues well B makes sense because B is part of the

1131
03:27:39,139 --> 03:27:54,739
pun right it's waiting for the fences a big bat from the big leagues all right

1132
03:27:54,739 --> 03:28:02,010
we're gonna be it's unanimous wait for the fence I grabbed the bat with both

1133
03:28:02,010 --> 03:28:08,229
hands and to say it looked angry would be a gross understatement definitely

1134
03:28:08,229 --> 03:28:20,920
hurt the actor okay snare the bat with the rope climb up to the rafters or use

1135
03:28:20,920 --> 03:28:36,409
the rope to escape snare the bat with the rope that's in that it's 80% of the

1136
03:28:36,409 --> 03:28:49,129
vote so far yeah okay it's near the bat I grabbed the rope and a trap door opened

1137
03:28:49,129 --> 03:28:55,010
as a wrong fell for what seemed to be a long long time they hit the ground hard

1138
03:28:55,010 --> 03:28:59,309
fortunately I broke my fall on something soft

1139
03:28:59,309 --> 03:29:08,610
well what do you think you're doing mother doesn't like anybody playing in her laundry do ya mom

1140
03:29:08,610 --> 03:29:11,170
that's right stay out of my laundry

1141
03:29:11,170 --> 03:29:13,170
why did he change his voice halfway through

1142
03:29:13,170 --> 03:29:25,709
this guy was obviously a psycho

1143
03:29:25,709 --> 03:29:27,709
this guy's a psycho

1144
03:29:27,709 --> 03:29:32,530
why does it sound like Bobcat Goldthwait

1145
03:29:32,530 --> 03:29:40,930
I mean I had to like make sounds and make voices and stuff like that it sounds like me

1146
03:29:41,229 --> 03:29:47,329
you guys say this to me all right give the psycho a closer look go find the

1147
03:29:47,329 --> 03:29:57,120
butler give mama a friendly smile well I think this is the death one but we have

1148
03:29:57,120 --> 03:30:01,860
to click it because that's what you guys want to do give mama a friendly smile

1149
03:30:01,860 --> 03:30:09,149
wow what are you waiting for

1150
03:30:09,149 --> 03:30:20,459
yet within striking distance casually gain his confidence or go find the

1151
03:30:20,459 --> 03:30:38,159
butler I'm convinced that you made this game and this is some kind of prank

1152
03:30:38,159 --> 03:30:57,879
stream I wish I did I wish I made this game all right we're gonna be I moved

1153
03:30:57,879 --> 03:31:06,409
cautiously towards mama's boy watch it right okay you guys got that double

1154
03:31:06,409 --> 03:31:16,489
wrong that's double wrong he flattened your nose I don't know how long I was

1155
03:31:16,489 --> 03:31:22,290
out but someone or something had dragged me to a cellar below Der Hatchet Manor

1156
03:31:22,290 --> 03:31:29,069
as I struggled to clear my head I clicked on my flashlight and looked

1157
03:31:29,069 --> 03:31:34,469
around any fool could see that the place had more than its share of dingbats and

1158
03:31:34,569 --> 03:31:41,969
I was no exception FMV game you know how badly I okay here's the problem

1159
03:31:41,969 --> 03:31:50,729
there's I have to be careful for like shotgun blasting out a bunch of ideas

1160
03:31:50,729 --> 03:31:56,930
that I think of really fun because I have to focus on only a few things at a

1161
03:31:56,930 --> 03:32:06,420
time make no mistake about it I would love nothing more than to put hundreds

1162
03:32:06,420 --> 03:32:13,100
and hundreds of hours of time and any amount of money doesn't matter how much

1163
03:32:13,100 --> 03:32:19,319
it would cost to make an FMV game that's like this but holy shit that is

1164
03:32:19,319 --> 03:32:23,920
like a monumental undertaking and there's no way I'm gonna be able to do

1165
03:32:23,920 --> 03:32:33,620
it there's only so many things I can be in the tank you can't load up too much

1166
03:32:33,620 --> 03:32:37,350
luggage in your car to the point where your car is touching the ground because

1167
03:32:37,350 --> 03:32:48,889
it won't drive yeah I can't weigh the car down with 500 cinder blocks make

1168
03:32:48,889 --> 03:32:57,590
that one the last bit before retirement I explore the seller it was there in the

1169
03:32:57,690 --> 03:33:02,790
seller that I discovered the little man with the evil grin I've actually talked

1170
03:33:02,790 --> 03:33:05,790
about it before with people in the community about like things that I've

1171
03:33:05,790 --> 03:33:11,090
wanted to do but it's just I can't I get if it's too much to think about too much

1172
03:33:11,090 --> 03:33:32,790
to do all right I mean we already know how this one plays out I probably just

1173
03:33:32,790 --> 03:33:43,780
did this on my own yeah we it's don't turn around and then we flip them he fell

1174
03:33:43,879 --> 03:33:50,479
for it so I took the opportunity to bash him in the chops I never hit a man when

1175
03:33:50,479 --> 03:33:55,479
he's down but I knew I should have made an exception when I felt his fingers on

1176
03:33:55,479 --> 03:34:06,469
my throat how fucking awesome how fun would that be oh man imagine making a

1177
03:34:06,469 --> 03:34:15,969
full FMV game and we just do it what you guys play it I don't even play it you

1178
03:34:16,069 --> 03:34:25,860
guys pick like this god damn it that would be fun yeah do it I don't tell me

1179
03:34:25,860 --> 03:34:34,719
to do these things because I will fuck up every other project just give me a

1180
03:34:34,719 --> 03:34:39,209
little bit more time and I have a lot more things to talk about it's a little

1181
03:34:39,209 --> 03:34:46,149
bit more time I want to do so many of these things a little bit more time all

1182
03:34:46,149 --> 03:34:51,879
right what are we doing all right well Chad is deciding to lose another heart

1183
03:34:52,379 --> 03:35:01,059
so we're going to tickle him he just tightened his grip and laughed well you

1184
03:35:01,059 --> 03:35:15,340
died I woke up with the feeling that I was at the end of my room it didn't work

1185
03:35:15,340 --> 03:35:21,709
realize that I was you lost a heart he tied the situation was bad and my life

1186
03:35:21,709 --> 03:35:27,110
hung in the balance but this was no time for reflection just make an unfinished

1187
03:35:27,110 --> 03:35:30,510
FMV project and have somebody else need to finish it in 30 years that's really

1188
03:35:30,510 --> 03:35:37,770
funny well it would have to be shot in 16 millimeter that's one of things I'm

1189
03:35:37,770 --> 03:35:42,360
gonna make it really incredibly incredibly clear if I'm if I were to do

1190
03:35:42,360 --> 03:35:52,700
this it's being shot in 16 millimeter I don't care how expensive it is this

1191
03:35:52,700 --> 03:36:06,959
needs to be led that way it's gonna be like two million dollars fuck it I don't

1192
03:36:06,959 --> 03:36:12,370
think it's gonna cause that much do 16 millimeter and then get it restored into

1193
03:36:13,069 --> 03:36:24,040
Wow now that's a big brain play that's a big brain play somebody say cringe all

1194
03:36:24,040 --> 03:36:28,340
right we all know this is easy all these are the same I was trying to think of a

1195
03:36:28,340 --> 03:36:39,159
diversion when I lost my footing started to slip away as the rope bit into my

1196
03:36:39,159 --> 03:36:47,129
neck have us pay for it do like a pay-per-view stream when I got up I saw

1197
03:36:47,129 --> 03:36:54,360
that the pipe had made quite an impression on laughing boy I wouldn't

1198
03:36:54,360 --> 03:36:58,059
want to do okay here's what I wouldn't want to do I wouldn't want to make it so

1199
03:36:58,059 --> 03:37:03,479
people couldn't watch it even if that okay let's say that this whole project if

1200
03:37:03,479 --> 03:37:06,260
it was ever if it was ever done remember this is not me saying it's

1201
03:37:06,260 --> 03:37:11,590
happening I'm just saying that's even I'm interested if it was oh here's an

1202
03:37:11,590 --> 03:37:15,510
idea we'll make the whole thing and then the stream will be you pay for the

1203
03:37:15,510 --> 03:37:21,760
stream like a pay-per-view stream no I want as many people to experience that

1204
03:37:21,760 --> 03:37:29,059
as humanly possible right maybe do paid physical copies yeah I'm honestly I

1205
03:37:29,059 --> 03:37:33,870
would not give a shit at all I mean obviously I don't want to like lose like

1206
03:37:33,870 --> 03:37:38,159
millions of dollars like that would be fucking devastating I don't have

1207
03:37:38,159 --> 03:37:43,780
millions of dollars it would be pretty bad maybe there's a way maybe that well

1208
03:37:43,780 --> 03:37:51,309
maybe I'll find a way all right what do you guys want to make yeah of course I

1209
03:37:51,309 --> 03:37:58,459
told laughing boy he was bound to be out of circulation for a while but he

1210
03:37:59,399 --> 03:38:11,229
losing millions is really funny though no really okay well all right this is

1211
03:38:11,229 --> 03:38:25,319
where it all goes completely off the rails what about getting it sponsored

1212
03:38:25,319 --> 03:38:38,870
yeah you don't know and do get the sign we need to be done with actors shot on

1213
03:38:38,870 --> 03:38:58,200
film I wanted to be old where we going I would make yourself an actor no I would

1214
03:38:58,200 --> 03:39:01,280
know I don't be the only actor I would be I would be in it for like 10 seconds

1215
03:39:01,420 --> 03:39:17,040
I'd be like the the old prospector that you run into in a hallway somewhere this

1216
03:39:17,040 --> 03:39:22,969
is also pretty you this is very unanimous look for some artifacts the

1217
03:39:22,969 --> 03:39:28,129
next room contained an old writing desk under the derhatchet family crest on the

1218
03:39:28,129 --> 03:39:40,260
desk were many items of interest you get streamers to be actors no I don't think

1219
03:39:40,260 --> 03:39:45,610
so I don't want anyone I feel like okay I want them to be unknown I don't want

1220
03:39:45,610 --> 03:39:50,219
anyone to know who they are I wanted to be actors I wanted to be I'd like to be

1221
03:39:50,219 --> 03:39:58,549
like real because here's the thing stuff like that would be really funny but let

1222
03:39:58,549 --> 03:40:04,190
you say it was like streamer X it's no it's it's like streamer X playing

1223
03:40:04,190 --> 03:40:10,860
character right it's not that's the that's a monster on the screen so if I

1224
03:40:10,860 --> 03:40:13,780
would ever do that exactly the same reason why I said I don't even want to

1225
03:40:13,780 --> 03:40:18,610
be in it either like I would want to be in it for like 10 seconds as like an

1226
03:40:18,610 --> 03:40:22,250
Easter egg I don't want to be in this I want to hire I want to like direct

1227
03:40:22,250 --> 03:40:28,030
actors right because then it's just oh look it's germa as this character you

1228
03:40:28,030 --> 03:40:35,260
know I'm saying so now it would be all just actors that we would be hiring and

1229
03:40:35,260 --> 03:40:41,260
I'm talking like this is happening soon but it's not if it did happen it would

1230
03:40:41,260 --> 03:40:48,420
be like that all right uh taste the wine you we already know how to do this one

1231
03:40:48,420 --> 03:40:57,670
we already know how to do this one why are you doing this as I reached forward

1232
03:40:57,670 --> 03:41:15,299
the candle lit itself and as if by magic a monk appeared well this is a

1233
03:41:15,399 --> 03:41:23,350
different option now play more of these games if you're a relatively new viewer

1234
03:41:23,350 --> 03:41:29,030
gold motion video games I've played almost all of them over the last five

1235
03:41:29,030 --> 03:41:35,930
years or so there actually aren't very many left that I haven't played some of

1236
03:41:35,930 --> 03:41:38,989
the new ones I haven't played the ones that have come out in the last year or

1237
03:41:38,989 --> 03:41:47,840
two and we're gonna be drunk the flame in the wine oh yeah okay wish the candle

1238
03:41:47,840 --> 03:41:56,079
and a glass of the house vino and the Phantom friar gave up the ghost at least

1239
03:41:56,079 --> 03:42:01,219
the ones that look like we'd have a good time playing them right some FMV

1240
03:42:01,219 --> 03:42:06,280
games that are very much meant to be taken very seriously and it's not like

1241
03:42:06,280 --> 03:42:09,239
oh my god look at how funny that was look at how bizarre of a scenario that

1242
03:42:09,239 --> 03:42:12,799
was it's just actors doing things in front of a camera so it's supposed to

1243
03:42:12,799 --> 03:42:20,479
be taken seriously and not like oh let's have a fun time and laugh at this all

1244
03:42:20,479 --> 03:42:36,280
right pocket the gold and split I think that's what it's gonna be it is you guys

1245
03:42:36,280 --> 03:42:54,379
cannot make another mistake hey you want to go I don't want to say anything

1246
03:42:54,379 --> 03:43:00,190
because it's kind of close what is the baseball stream baseball stream is going

1247
03:43:00,190 --> 03:43:07,889
to be at some point in the first quarter or second quarter of next year somewhere

1248
03:43:07,889 --> 03:43:13,479
when baseball is played it was a theory that we might be able to get it done

1249
03:43:13,479 --> 03:43:23,250
this year but it's not gonna happen too cold but that I refuse to not do that

1250
03:43:23,250 --> 03:43:29,959
stream and what about grotto beasts grotto beasts actually let's do this

1251
03:43:29,959 --> 03:43:38,120
right now I want to shout this out so grotto beasts I can't give you a time or

1252
03:43:38,120 --> 03:43:42,979
date for that but I really really want you to be able to have that stuff in

1253
03:43:42,979 --> 03:43:52,930
your hands the physical cards in your hands by the latest quarter one of this

1254
03:43:52,930 --> 03:43:58,200
coming year I'm giving a huge window for that because it's very very possible

1255
03:43:58,200 --> 03:44:05,379
that's way earlier but I don't want to rush people on the work that they're

1256
03:44:05,379 --> 03:44:13,909
doing so if you get it at some point at the end of this year or January maybe

1257
03:44:13,909 --> 03:44:17,750
you do but I'm not gonna tell you that because I don't want to put on a

1258
03:44:18,010 --> 03:44:23,229
dumb amount of pressure on people to have to get stuff done that's I don't

1259
03:44:23,229 --> 03:44:26,590
know I do not want to do that so whenever it's done and whenever it's like

1260
03:44:26,590 --> 03:44:35,680
okay it's ready to go and with that let's go ahead and talk about this so the

1261
03:44:35,680 --> 03:44:44,760
grotto beasts team has a Twitter and they post various updates I actually just

1262
03:44:44,760 --> 03:44:53,450
retweeted them on Halloween here's the official grotto beasts Twitter account

1263
03:44:53,450 --> 03:45:00,309
let me put it in the chat go give it a follow if you want to know more about

1264
03:45:00,450 --> 03:45:10,540
grotto beasts coming up they post all the time all the various artists and

1265
03:45:10,540 --> 03:45:24,979
here you go here is the official Twitter of the grotto beasts trading card game I

1266
03:45:24,979 --> 03:45:32,889
was holding off on talking about this until it was clear that we had sort of

1267
03:45:32,889 --> 03:45:40,139
like an end goal of soon grotto beast NFTs this these are not NFTs but now

1268
03:45:40,139 --> 03:45:46,530
there's not gonna be an NFT there won't be any grotto beast NFTs this is you're

1269
03:45:46,530 --> 03:45:50,030
gonna be able to hold these in your hand well not you get that it's a you're

1270
03:45:50,030 --> 03:45:57,120
gonna be a whole it's cards you will be able to purchase and open for yourself

1271
03:45:57,120 --> 03:46:08,049
packs of grotto beasts by the way let's make this very clear too if you think

1272
03:46:08,049 --> 03:46:13,520
that this was just gonna be a repackaged thing that I opened on the stream you

1273
03:46:13,520 --> 03:46:24,360
are so wrong there's going to be an astronomical more amount of cards and

1274
03:46:24,360 --> 03:46:29,739
it's gonna have a playable game behind it as well you're actually gonna be able

1275
03:46:29,739 --> 03:46:40,579
to play this with people it's a real game have a game designer and hey hope

1276
03:46:40,579 --> 03:46:43,879
you like it when it comes out because there's other stuff that I haven't

1277
03:46:43,879 --> 03:46:50,809
talked about yet with it too but you know what yeah fuck it let's just talk

1278
03:46:50,809 --> 03:47:01,309
about it why not hey I I'm the goddamn CEO okay um should I hold off on some

1279
03:47:01,309 --> 03:47:12,030
stuff so the grotto beasts card game is going to end up being a pretty

1280
03:47:12,030 --> 03:47:18,969
significant when people talk about like merch right oh what what should you do

1281
03:47:19,389 --> 03:47:22,870
a t-shirt I could do another t-shirt oh maybe I'll do a t-shirt maybe I'll do

1282
03:47:22,870 --> 03:47:27,229
something else so maybe I'll do like a toy or something in the grotto beast

1283
03:47:27,229 --> 03:47:34,489
card game there's going to be not just grotto beasts it's not just gonna be

1284
03:47:34,489 --> 03:47:42,409
grotto beasts it's gonna be tons and tons of this channel's references

1285
03:47:42,409 --> 03:47:54,219
characters it's gonna be a gigantic crossover so it's not just simply the

1286
03:47:54,219 --> 03:47:58,450
grotto beasts there's potentially lots of other things too that you'll be able

1287
03:47:58,469 --> 03:48:09,629
to have and collect it's the biggest crossover event ever and it's two things

1288
03:48:09,629 --> 03:48:15,100
that were created in on this same channel in this same community it's not

1289
03:48:15,100 --> 03:48:27,420
even a crossover event it's the same goddamn channel so I've been pretty

1290
03:48:27,420 --> 03:48:30,620
tight-lipped about this because I don't I didn't want to like hype this up until

1291
03:48:30,620 --> 03:48:35,500
I knew that it was gonna start to become a thing so it's a game you can actually

1292
03:48:35,500 --> 03:48:43,979
play it you don't even have to he's losing viewers no stay don't please

1293
03:48:43,979 --> 03:48:51,340
don't leave please don't leave please what about people that were in the

1294
03:48:51,639 --> 03:49:16,840
rumble actually 20 community subs of Anto uh yes so that there's a lot of

1295
03:49:16,840 --> 03:49:22,139
plans for like that project in the future maybe just know that it's gonna

1296
03:49:22,139 --> 03:49:27,799
have a lot of cards is gonna be I don't want to talk too much about it because I

1297
03:49:27,799 --> 03:49:31,540
don't want to get anything wrong and community Jake right now might be

1310
03:51:30,540 --> 03:51:41,170
never said that what about EU I I don't I I have no answer for that time I don't

1311
03:51:41,170 --> 03:51:46,540
I currently do not have an answer for this time I'm I think so I just can't

1312
03:51:46,540 --> 03:51:49,340
give you an answer I don't know I do not have an answer for this time and my

1313
03:51:49,340 --> 03:51:58,159
phone just blew up I've got eight unread notifications on my phone I see a stop

1314
03:51:58,159 --> 03:52:04,200
sign emoji a hundred times okay I probably should let's go ahead and play

1315
03:52:04,200 --> 03:52:23,299
the game what did you guys pick it was a I don't remember I can't it was B all

1316
03:52:23,299 --> 03:52:36,870
right B let's go on the steps above me a green ghoul gestured gracefully I'm

1317
03:52:36,870 --> 03:52:39,909
really really excited for not just the fact that the grotto beast are really

1318
03:52:39,909 --> 03:52:44,840
awesome but it's gonna be this interesting kind of mix of like a ton of

1319
03:52:44,840 --> 03:52:55,329
references to this the last decade plus of this channel and community it's a

1320
03:52:55,329 --> 03:53:09,229
really interesting way I was hopeful to do merch and we're going a proceed boldly

1321
03:53:09,229 --> 03:53:19,010
I approached the zombie reluctantly and asked him who his tailor was his

1322
03:53:19,010 --> 03:53:27,059
response was to push me backwards into a rickety old freight elevator yeah you said

1323
03:53:27,059 --> 03:53:41,219
boldly you end up gonna do the germa joke plus two minus two futures market

1324
03:53:41,219 --> 03:53:50,870
with channel points that seems like a fun idea yeah I did but that's the

1325
03:53:50,870 --> 03:53:55,559
problem this is why I get into trouble I get in a lot of trouble because we

1326
03:53:55,559 --> 03:54:01,049
pay okay I tell I tell you guys about four or five different things that

1327
03:54:01,049 --> 03:54:06,840
sound really interesting don't they but in reality only one or two of those

1328
03:54:06,840 --> 03:54:13,030
things can possibly be worked on so what ends up happening is you are like oh my

1329
03:54:13,030 --> 03:54:17,510
god he talked about like four or five different cool things going on when in

1330
03:54:17,510 --> 03:54:21,840
realities one of these things is actually gonna work these are all things

1331
03:54:21,840 --> 03:54:25,159
that I really want to do every time I talk it's things that I really want to

1332
03:54:25,159 --> 03:54:34,729
do but here's the thing right since the dollhouse stream there's been some

1333
03:54:34,729 --> 03:54:43,360
potential here to do more possibly maybe hopefully maybe find more people that

1334
03:54:43,360 --> 03:54:48,360
are willing to get on board and help us pay for projects and help us do things

1335
03:54:48,360 --> 03:54:54,690
there some of these things are possible now because the dollhouse happened and

1336
03:54:54,690 --> 03:55:01,280
the dollhouse was a really really fun time so I can't tell you exactly what's

1337
03:55:01,280 --> 03:55:07,200
gonna happen because I still don't even know but if some of these doors are

1338
03:55:07,200 --> 03:55:11,969
starting to open a little bit more with like okay now people are aware that I

1339
03:55:11,969 --> 03:55:17,209
want to do big projects and I need capital and I need people and I need

1340
03:55:17,209 --> 03:55:22,129
more crew members and stuff right like this is all stuff that's knowledgeable

1341
03:55:22,129 --> 03:55:28,809
to a lot of people now so if I can get some of these things to help make these

1342
03:55:28,809 --> 03:55:39,059
projects come faster that's what I'm gonna do networking Andy well you bet

1343
03:55:39,059 --> 03:55:47,510
your ass that I want to try to make some of these things reality right and if

1344
03:55:47,510 --> 03:55:51,959
they do become a reality that's what makes me happy I don't care about

1345
03:55:51,959 --> 03:55:57,120
anything else I really don't I don't give a shit about anything else I could

1346
03:55:57,120 --> 03:56:01,479
not make a single dollar from us any of the projects none of them zero I would

1347
03:56:01,479 --> 03:56:07,049
not give a flying fuck at all I wouldn't care at all I don't care if they that

1348
03:56:07,049 --> 03:56:11,840
the projects can be paid for and I don't have to worry about it then fucking

1349
03:56:11,840 --> 03:56:20,639
perfect that's exactly what I want I don't care he's lying by the way I'm

1350
03:56:20,639 --> 03:56:32,129
not I swear I promise you I don't care you've seen okay you've seen the leak I

1351
03:56:32,129 --> 03:56:36,010
don't even need to tell you that like we've made a jokes about it before do I

1352
03:56:36,010 --> 03:56:41,649
really need to make a shitload of money on each project because I'm I have to

1353
03:56:41,649 --> 03:57:00,790
no I don't care I'm for 98 yeah I'm not a liar says the life yeah all right I am

1354
03:57:00,790 --> 03:57:08,010
a liar I I'm a liar but not in not unimportant stuff like this I'm not

1355
03:57:08,010 --> 03:57:13,569
trying to make a bunch of money I'm trying to have things be paid for right

1356
03:57:13,569 --> 03:57:19,379
that I'm I care about and sometimes people will hear about some of the how

1357
03:57:19,379 --> 03:57:24,360
much some of this these projects costed right holy shit it was that much money

1358
03:57:24,360 --> 03:57:33,549
yeah I sometimes it has to be but don't get do not give me any money I'm seeing

1359
03:57:33,549 --> 03:57:36,829
people give money don't do that stop giving me money right now I demand it

1360
03:57:36,829 --> 03:57:42,639

1361
03:57:42,639 --> 03:57:48,809
money stop that immediately I command it I demand it I demand it it ends at once

1362
03:57:48,809 --> 03:58:01,940
are we going stop reverse engineer Andy I'm just saying all right just know in

1363
03:58:01,940 --> 03:58:08,319
the future whatever projects we do I'm just I'm glad that they were able to

1364
03:58:08,319 --> 03:58:14,940
happen that's it just think about this this is like the kind of shit that I've

1365
03:58:14,940 --> 03:58:21,469
wanted to since I was like fucking 12 right I cannot even begin to tell you

1366
03:58:21,469 --> 03:58:27,510
guys just how how it feels to like something that I wanted to do when I was

1367
03:58:27,510 --> 03:58:35,270
11 you are 12 like I am I'm really I'm living every single one of my fantasies

1368
03:58:35,270 --> 03:58:39,719
from when I was a kid it's unbelievable to me and the fact that I'm able just to

1369
03:58:39,719 --> 03:58:47,930
do that alone just just by itself is worth more than anything anything so the

1370
03:58:47,930 --> 03:59:01,159
fact that I can sit here and talk like this is already enough just want to be

1371
03:59:01,159 --> 03:59:13,299
clear Jesus fucking Christ just play the game already I just I just had a major

1373
03:59:16,500 --> 03:59:21,450
announcement I'm I'm going I'm going I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm going I thought

1374
03:59:21,450 --> 03:59:28,579

1377
03:59:37,459 --> 03:59:44,399
we're gonna go I'm a fucking bad guy all right I'm the bad guy don't worry what

1378
03:59:44,399 --> 04:00:03,950

1379
04:00:03,950 --> 04:00:08,110
you know I'm so much better than I look at what I do look yeah I don't care

1380
04:00:08,110 --> 04:00:12,870
about from only me oh I'm the only one that cares about not receiving a

1381
04:00:12,870 --> 04:00:18,469
monitor I'm the only one no I don't want you to think that either I love money

1382
04:00:18,469 --> 04:00:37,030
okay here we go all right walk straight this I don't think I've done this before

1383
04:00:37,030 --> 04:00:48,969
the next room I came to had nothing in it there was an old freezer on one side

1384
04:00:48,969 --> 04:01:00,639
and a lot of potions on the other just as I started to examine them I heard a

1385
04:01:00,639 --> 04:01:17,469
scream open the freezers the correct play we've all seen it like five times

1386
04:01:17,469 --> 04:01:29,719
already although there's opening the freezer stop whatever the laughing

1387
04:01:29,760 --> 04:01:41,760
screaming person coming in the room I think Coolsville sucks just open the

1388
04:01:41,760 --> 04:02:00,329
freezer ignoring the fumes I opened the freezer I love this guy uh can I just do

1389
04:02:00,329 --> 04:02:29,020
this on my own because I know how to get there please do okay I read the labels

1390
04:02:29,020 --> 04:02:39,920
extra strength potion instant steak pill anti-grav tablets okay so it's the

1391
04:02:39,920 --> 04:02:48,649
take the steak and leave I wasn't hungry now but an instant steak might come in

1392
04:02:48,649 --> 04:03:01,280
handy later where's your choice that's what everybody was gonna pick all right

1393
04:03:01,280 --> 04:03:07,069
this is it's a and then you leave these are both this is gonna kill us so don't

1394
04:03:07,389 --> 04:03:29,610
be stupid about this thank you

1395
04:03:50,170 --> 04:04:06,969
yeah we gotta get out of this room it's your one-year anniversary with the sus

1396
04:04:06,969 --> 04:04:31,040
face I want a divorce I gave him five dollars and left all right this is a

1397
04:04:31,079 --> 04:04:34,280
tough call because I don't remember exactly which one of these means you get

1398
04:04:34,280 --> 04:04:55,520
grabbed how do you feel about the rats becoming extremely popular and tick-tock

1399
04:04:55,520 --> 04:05:01,190
sorry say that again so that one more time I didn't hear that that well say

1400
04:05:01,190 --> 04:05:12,520
that again I won't say that again the rats are incredibly popular on tick-tock

1401
04:05:12,520 --> 04:05:16,399
the rats are huge on tick-tock I'm sorry I'm leaning with my ear say that one

1402
04:05:16,399 --> 04:05:25,950
more time what do we talk about like a few weeks ago what that I I am huge on

1403
04:05:25,950 --> 04:05:32,059
tick-tock and I'm not even there so I'm excuse me I'm just trying to understand

1404
04:05:32,100 --> 04:05:42,489
why everyone was saying that that was not accurate the rats are also huge on

1405
04:05:42,489 --> 04:05:56,520
Facebook all right let's search the room the rats are popular not you bozo as I

1406
04:05:56,520 --> 04:06:03,629
ran into the next room I heard the scream again I am the rats the rats are

1407
04:06:03,629 --> 04:06:14,719
nothing without me should I make a tick-tock video of doing the rat song but

1408
04:06:14,719 --> 04:06:19,100
make sure I'm doing it really poorly and I'd be pretty relatively unknown on

1409
04:06:19,100 --> 04:06:22,979
tick-tock would people like hate me for it would be like oh that was terrible

1410
04:06:22,979 --> 04:06:28,200
nice try my video is way better on the tick on the rats meme it's like I'm I'm

1411
04:06:28,200 --> 04:06:36,780
the one who made it talking to you talking to the guy that made it up keep

1412
04:06:36,780 --> 04:06:45,420
moving forward why you're not actually gonna do this are you I ran through the

1413
04:06:45,420 --> 04:06:49,940
door and found myself near the elevator oh I thought you fall I pushed the

1414
04:06:49,940 --> 04:06:55,459
button and waited there was a green door to my left and a stairway to my right

1415
04:06:55,459 --> 04:07:06,270
okay I know for a fact we don't do the green door this is a really important

1416
04:07:06,270 --> 04:07:28,280
decision but I'm just kidding I scramble up the stairs is it time to

1417
04:07:28,280 --> 04:07:48,260
release release release is it time to release the third rat song I wonder if

1418
04:07:48,260 --> 04:08:01,129
we're gonna get to the end at the top of the stairs I saw an ugly dwarf private

1419
04:08:01,129 --> 04:08:16,239
eye versus private eye gory how tall am I okay show him your license take

1420
04:08:16,239 --> 04:08:33,540
evasive action or put down that shovel take evasive action when he moved I

1421
04:08:33,540 --> 04:08:39,100
jumped over the railing it was a long way to the first floor and laughing boy

1422
04:08:39,100 --> 04:08:49,559
was no help at all that would hurt so bad holy shit that was painful looking

1423
04:08:49,559 --> 04:09:02,549
I think you guys are in some trouble here grab his shirt and pull punch with

1424
04:09:02,549 --> 04:09:07,049
your stronger hand or let go of the railing grab his shirt and pull is

1425
04:09:07,049 --> 04:09:17,569
winning by a way too much I grabbed his shirt and flipped over the railing symbol

1426
04:09:17,569 --> 04:09:36,920
crash the second floor looked dark and uninviting okay where we go I told my

1427
04:09:36,920 --> 04:09:40,600
friend who used to work for the company that helped with this game and he

1428
04:09:40,600 --> 04:09:45,209
thought that it was crazy that you were playing it and as we're having a great

1429
04:09:45,209 --> 04:09:53,090
time the last one too I applaud the companies that actually tried to restore

1430
04:09:53,090 --> 04:10:01,989
this stuff this is awesome I'm having a lot of fun ask your friend how to beat

1431
04:10:01,989 --> 04:10:18,629
the game all right we're going I don't know it's 51 42 a and C if it were me I

1432
04:10:18,629 --> 04:10:22,489
would probably pick the one that we didn't do yet which is probably whatever

1433
04:10:22,489 --> 04:10:26,170
medical records so and that's winning right now so that's what I'm gonna pick

1434
04:10:26,170 --> 04:10:40,270
the room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort well it's in

1435
04:10:40,270 --> 04:10:45,389
regardless I'm gonna get the garlic there was a door to my left another dead

1436
04:10:45,389 --> 04:10:50,309
ahead but most of the action was taking place in the kitchen on my right where

1437
04:10:50,309 --> 04:11:00,809
someone was practicing a bizarre form of culinary preparation but we don't

1438
04:11:00,809 --> 04:11:12,729
necessarily have to do the kitchen but the garlic seems pretty important huh

1439
04:11:12,729 --> 04:11:24,250
yes the library kitchen I couldn't put my finger on it but there was something

1440
04:11:24,250 --> 04:11:32,989
odd about the woman in the kitchen it's really cold in this room I think maybe

1441
04:11:32,989 --> 04:11:39,280
the breath coming out of you see that you see just how cold it is in there I

1442
04:11:39,280 --> 04:11:51,950
feel bad for the actor oh yeah we look in the bad we're gonna look in the

1443
04:11:51,950 --> 04:12:14,049
fridge of course I find other edibles we've gotten this right plenty of times

1444
04:12:14,049 --> 04:12:18,520
make the FMV game and make sure there's no references to you in it no they won't

1445
04:12:18,520 --> 04:12:24,360
be it would be it would be I mean well they'd be you'd probably know I made it

1446
04:12:24,399 --> 04:12:31,930
somehow but this would not be a like German 985 FMV experience it'd be like

1447
04:12:31,930 --> 04:12:41,510
an old Western game or something like an old horror game inside the cupboard was

1448
04:12:41,510 --> 04:13:04,959
a rose a clove of garlic and a couple of potatoes don't tell us you made it and

1449
04:13:04,959 --> 04:13:08,780
just play it one day well I think it would be really fun if the first

1450
04:13:08,780 --> 04:13:16,000
experience ever with the game was on the stream and you guys are doing this maybe

1451
04:13:16,000 --> 04:13:21,329
we'll build like an extension or something I have like some kind of use

1452
04:13:21,329 --> 04:13:28,729
of an extension for you guys to do it easier so you guys are get the first

1453
04:13:28,729 --> 04:13:31,969
experience of the game and then like I reached in and took the clove of God a

1454
04:13:31,969 --> 04:13:40,440
week later or something it goes on steam or whatever stop giving him an idea he

1455
04:13:40,440 --> 04:13:57,319
only cares about money I care about money I don't only care about money

1456
04:13:57,319 --> 04:14:04,559
money's somewhere on the list somewhere take the potato I feel like I'm gonna

1457
04:14:04,559 --> 04:14:22,520
get hurt I you guys really I think a is you took too much die and we get stabbed

1458
04:14:22,520 --> 04:14:59,479
this is a GG I thank you all right well I came to something was sitting across

1459
04:14:59,479 --> 04:15:20,180
the attic from me this doesn't matter oh I feel like we've met before

1460
04:15:23,260 --> 04:15:27,819
that's my favorite shot of the whole thing he's kind of leaned over you all said a

1461
04:15:27,819 --> 04:15:49,149
anyways I want this guy that was my he was sucking on this character okay this

1462
04:15:49,149 --> 04:16:10,920
is actually important I want that exact character in another game find something

1463
04:16:10,920 --> 04:16:26,659
value I should have the coins quickly I checked my pockets okay throw a gold

1464
04:16:26,659 --> 04:16:33,430
coin that's the only option that probably results in something different

1465
04:16:33,430 --> 04:16:46,930
that's a different video clip let's try it I threw it in his mouth expecting him

1466
04:16:46,930 --> 04:16:57,159
to choke to death what but instead when I looked in his eyes I knew I had failed

1467
04:16:57,159 --> 04:17:16,440
I was powerless to resist him that sucked that sucked it was a great throw

1468
04:17:16,440 --> 04:17:26,520
but Jesus okay you guys want one more chance at this I'm gonna give you one

1469
04:17:26,520 --> 04:17:39,540
more chance let's get to the end I know you can do it collectively I know you can

1470
04:17:39,540 --> 04:17:49,750
is there another FMV I have this I have one more that's ready for right now but

1471
04:17:49,750 --> 04:17:54,270
it's new and I don't know I'm not sure if I want to do it right now it looks

1472
04:17:54,270 --> 04:18:08,799
like it might be long depends on how long it is is it the battle royale one

1473

04:25:57,790 --> 04:26:01,629
can say that's my face you have been inundated with applications they have

1520
04:26:01,629 --> 04:26:05,549
been ground into dust by the boot heel of the rich and powerful who are now

1521

1523
04:26:14,430 --> 04:26:23,190

1701
04:52:35,930 --> 04:52:46,400
to do this shoot him shoot him no scratches no I probably shouldn't have

1702
04:52:46,400 --> 04:52:53,470
done that I've done that I could just oh I just landed no scratches no bruises oh

1703
04:52:53,470 --> 04:52:56,709
yeah I just landed away from my group yeah right look around they're out here

1704
04:52:56,709 --> 04:53:11,750
they're probably hiding dead yep and he had a gun thank you everybody wants to

1705
04:53:11,950 --> 04:53:48,180
I'm a psycho I just saved the goddamn team hesitation is defeat no if

1706
04:53:48,180 --> 04:53:53,799
everyone's look that's the thing if you landed away from your group you're not

1707
04:53:53,799 --> 04:54:00,080
going to hide behind a tree and approach another group choco boy 89 not a chance

1708
04:54:00,279 --> 04:54:06,720
why would you sneak up on another group that's not gonna happen I did what I had

1709
04:54:06,720 --> 04:54:15,799
to do camo camo so in right now really you never see it anywhere seriously

1710
04:54:15,799 --> 04:54:20,439
though what is this shite these guns are almost antique we should head for the

1711
04:54:20,439 --> 04:54:27,439
Sun see that what about it it's got to be something it's not in the

1712
04:54:27,439 --> 04:54:32,599
lock exactly there's a bridge up ahead from there we can either go straight

1713
04:54:32,599 --> 04:54:40,430
through or we can go I don't know straight ahead I feel like everyone's

1714
04:54:40,430 --> 04:54:45,799
gonna be going around nobody wants to do the straight shot because as well it's

1715
04:54:45,799 --> 04:54:49,080
too far in the open we don't want to be too exposed but isn't everybody gonna be

1716
04:54:49,080 --> 04:55:03,959
going around I think it's straight on I say we go straight through let's go see

1717
04:55:03,959 --> 04:55:10,939
if we can catch someone off guard no we go the other way and make sense we

1718
04:55:11,419 --> 04:55:19,770
serious I didn't just get telltale did I have the trust of his teammates what's

1719
04:55:19,770 --> 04:55:23,369
it gonna take to pull this back oh wait they don't trust me it's actually a

1720
04:55:23,369 --> 04:55:32,680
meter oh shit they won't listen to me that's actually kind of interesting

1721
04:55:32,680 --> 04:55:41,240
it's illusion of choice but it's not really an illusion of choice is this a

1722
04:55:41,240 --> 04:55:45,080
team morale meter and they would have listened to me if I if I didn't they

1723
04:55:45,080 --> 04:55:52,919
didn't hate me or something what's the difference between a liberal and a poppy

1724
04:55:52,919 --> 04:56:04,479
a puppy stops whining when it grows up landmine here comes the landmine or

1725
04:56:04,479 --> 04:56:07,840
maybe they're gonna keep him around long enough to like make everybody like hate

1726
04:56:07,840 --> 04:56:22,250
him and then they'll kill him I don't know I'm just gonna keep walking by the

1727
04:56:22,250 --> 04:56:31,400
way let's talk strategy here why would you ever talk like that with your

1728
04:56:31,400 --> 04:56:34,520
teammates in a life-or-death scenario where you need to like have each other's

1729
04:56:34,520 --> 04:56:41,330
backs but I feel I feel like you don't want your teammates to like fucking hate

1730
04:56:41,330 --> 04:56:45,330
your guts regardless of any of this right I would you want why would you do

1731
04:56:45,330 --> 04:56:53,610
that everybody is like hating this guy and he's like I'm being like political

1732
04:56:53,610 --> 04:56:58,340
and I like a dick isn't that hot look at me like why wouldn't you want to like

1733
04:56:58,340 --> 04:57:04,919
have your back with your teammates this is a life-and-death scenario with

1734
04:57:04,919 --> 04:57:31,759
everybody here what the fuck did you find any what's going on here I saw

1735
04:57:31,759 --> 04:57:37,959
something up ahead like a building what's with the blood don't point the

1736
04:57:37,959 --> 04:57:42,040
gun back at your face that was really bad

1737
04:57:43,040 --> 04:57:55,220
um I what why do you have blood all over your face I mean it's very very it's

1738
04:57:55,220 --> 04:58:00,939
very very very odd that it would be that high like okay have you shot somebody

1739
04:58:00,939 --> 04:58:06,189
like and they sprayed blood on it would be like kind of here here here yeah

1740
04:58:06,189 --> 04:58:11,549
she's blood like on her face up here why that's very that's that's a little odd I

1741
04:58:11,549 --> 04:58:16,380
don't you need to explain this here what you seem awfully eager to get us

1742

1746
04:58:55,099 --> 04:59:00,959

1754
05:00:33,290 --> 05:00:41,930

1756
05:01:02,500 --> 05:01:08,040
stream remote okay guys so we got three seconds left and I gotta be honest I'm

1757
05:01:08,040 --> 05:01:14,389
really not so sure what I should do I'm thinking that Gav has experience with

1758
05:01:14,389 --> 05:01:21,180
potential survival skills but tish had a lot of big brain ideas I'm not so

1759
05:01:21,180 --> 05:01:37,580
certain about this though she had some I think she's she's probably to keep the

1760
05:01:37,580 --> 05:02:01,729
smart person tish tish just suspects me oh shit she does you were acting sus

1761
05:02:01,729 --> 05:02:08,180
you've been acting sus towards tish if you save her then she should trust you

1762
05:02:08,180 --> 05:02:27,779
again but tish had a headshot that's right that's right hmm what I feel like

1763
05:02:27,779 --> 05:02:35,979
I haven't heard very much from from Gav in fact people saying who is Gav so just

1764
05:02:35,979 --> 05:02:44,139
because of that I think we have to kill that's it

1765
05:02:44,139 --> 05:02:55,259
yeah yeah that was not the annoying guy it's a good job I followed you down a

1766
05:02:55,259 --> 05:03:03,000
good work on the bridge there you really showed them it's your lucky day

1767
05:03:05,549 --> 05:03:11,750
death the cannibal has cornered his own landing squad

scarring yeah that was fucking horrible like forever changed from that one

1784
05:06:55,159 --> 05:07:37,750
let's stop watching TV actually good effects though not very realistic but

1785
05:07:37,750 --> 05:08:07,060
pretty good I mean it was fucked up how many people are even left on our team

1786
05:08:07,860 --> 05:08:10,900
let's take a breather there's something up ahead

1787
05:08:10,900 --> 05:08:29,889
we please stop playing this um I mean there's only two of us left what what

1788
05:08:29,889 --> 05:08:45,950
what are you looking for you need to tell me what's going on that headcase

1789
05:08:45,950 --> 05:08:52,310
Ari was almost right throw for content I actually have not thrown about that but

1790
05:08:52,310 --> 05:08:56,869
this game is fixed what do you mean winners picked out before the game

1791
05:08:56,909 --> 05:09:03,889
begins how guns are real the mines real how could you possibly stop someone from

1792
05:09:03,889 --> 05:09:08,299
getting killed it's not a sure thing but from what we can tell anything it's

1793
05:09:08,299 --> 05:09:18,619
fake and get them the advantage I'm too speed I'm not here to win tish I've been

1794
05:09:18,619 --> 05:09:23,819
sent here by a group called the Alliance they've sent me here to expose the truth

1795
05:09:23,819 --> 05:09:29,189
that the corporation used deep fake technology to rig the outcome of kill

1796
05:09:29,830 --> 05:09:32,200
with a deep fake stuff

1797
05:09:50,720 --> 05:09:52,720
are they deep faking people dying?

1798
05:09:59,560 --> 05:10:03,560
suits from the contestants estates them with audiences dwindling they had to

1799
05:10:03,560 --> 05:10:07,959
come up with a plan so they started fixing it we're not sure when when the

1800
05:10:07,959 --> 05:10:12,770
creator left their big changes behind the scenes the winners always became big

1801
05:10:12,770 --> 05:10:17,090
all the way up to the top and then all the way to the top man decided to change

1802
05:10:17,090 --> 05:10:20,849
that with the winners in their pockets they managed to keep things afloat for

1803
05:10:20,849 --> 05:10:24,810
a while longer but now they're getting desperate that's why the rules keep

1804
05:10:24,810 --> 05:10:30,729
getting more brutal so you were being serious about the no tap ups they're

1805
05:10:30,729 --> 05:10:38,459
doing it to boost the ratings and the puppet who is it? I'm not sure yet it's him

1806
05:10:38,459 --> 05:10:45,279
sure it's um it's I'm the bad guy probably right it's me who's I talking

1807
05:10:45,279 --> 05:10:53,509
to on the phone before on the walkie-talkie okay it's me it's gonna be

1808
05:10:53,750 --> 05:11:07,520
you're here to expose all of this how why do you be like not bad and send you

1809
05:11:07,520 --> 05:11:12,459
let's just say I have a reason to hate Alan we're all getting deep faked the

1810
05:11:12,459 --> 05:11:16,740
Alliance knew this and it was a safe bet my this is the last thing I'm playing

1811
05:11:16,740 --> 05:11:21,659
before I'm starting streaming they gave me this device payload that I need to

1812
05:11:21,659 --> 05:11:25,459
plant in the corporation's network if they can get in they can hijack the

1813
05:11:25,459 --> 05:11:31,180
stream expose it all the deep fakes the fix everything so why are you telling me

1814
05:11:31,180 --> 05:11:36,180
this why isn't the Alliance helping you it was the notion was up they switched

1815
05:11:36,180 --> 05:11:39,580
locations at the last moment

1816
05:11:39,580 --> 05:11:46,979
last dream ever wait I'm no I'm saying just for today what about GPS our phones

1817
05:11:46,979 --> 05:11:51,500
blocked this signals in and out of this place go through our own corpse network

1818
05:11:51,939 --> 05:11:56,479
we're almost done mice was meant to be an old to their control but the blast

1819
05:11:56,479 --> 05:12:00,720
back there must have knocked it out I need to find a way to our course

1820
05:12:00,720 --> 05:12:05,080
network a calm start maybe I can find a way to get a message out we can find out

1821
05:12:05,080 --> 05:12:08,919
where they're going to kill you gotta be something I didn't say this was bad

1822
05:12:08,919 --> 05:12:15,560
they're streaming from all these drones 24-7 let me see that even if the radio

1823
05:12:15,560 --> 05:12:21,310
is broken you should be able to get some info from the storage I'm not dying on

1824
05:12:21,310 --> 05:12:29,200
this fucking island for nothing why do I trust her we think I don't know I don't

1825
05:12:29,200 --> 05:12:35,259
think so I'm gonna keep hold of it for now they keep just doing the double

1826
05:12:35,259 --> 05:12:46,729
cross thing no okay it's getting dark if there's a predetermined winner it could

1827
05:12:46,729 --> 05:13:05,110
be anyone you have another tower then we know that so what if it's just her we

1828
05:13:05,110 --> 05:13:08,349
should take it in turns keeping watch and tell them to stop cursing please

1829
05:13:08,349 --> 05:13:14,270
toss a coin you're concerned about cursing you sure and there was just like

1830
05:13:14,270 --> 05:13:18,110
a gruesome scene with somebody's like face like blown off I'll have the

1831
05:13:18,110 --> 05:13:29,990
conversation how'd you end up here that's complicated answer why not not

1832
05:13:29,990 --> 05:13:35,819
much call for an aging child actor I didn't make the transition you bleep

1833
05:13:35,819 --> 05:13:43,680

05:20:24,049 --> 05:20:32,000
here than you know lower the gun and let's talk and things a really good

1871
05:20:32,000 --> 05:20:38,229
strategy it keeps your kill death high you to enjoy the game you can eat a

1872
05:20:38,229 --> 05:20:41,450
sandwich while you're playing you don't have to have two hands the controller I

1873
05:20:41,450 --> 05:20:46,669
mean that's a pain in the ass what's the difference between this island and a

1874
05:20:46,669 --> 05:20:59,500
dead prostitute Otto hears me saying Otto and is walking over here now hello

1875
05:20:59,500 --> 05:21:11,860
well it's a different auto not you this island still sucks we got a new party

1876
05:21:11,860 --> 05:21:17,220
why don't get is if they can fake bits of it why not fake the whole thing why

1877
05:21:17,220 --> 05:21:21,470
bother going to the expense of hosting it in the first place so let's let's get

1878
05:21:21,470 --> 05:21:29,430
Otto involved here to be variables all the drama power struggles randomness of

1879
05:21:29,430 --> 05:21:34,950
people is hard to script plus I don't know whether you know him but seriously

1880
05:21:34,950 --> 05:21:39,909
cutting you want 50% auto cam 50% game everybody apparently hey man streaming

1881
05:21:39,909 --> 05:21:43,669
that there's just too many people involved but it's an auto can't see this

1882
05:21:43,669 --> 05:21:48,470
shit trust a handful of people at the top to stay quiet they've got the most to

1883
05:21:48,470 --> 05:21:53,979
lose the winner's gonna keep their mouth shut but what about everyone else

1884
05:21:53,979 --> 05:22:00,900
who is it another puppet the winners are you since it was all fake you know he

1885
05:22:00,900 --> 05:22:04,459
really believed it maybe he was onto something maybe it's you mysteriously

1886
05:22:04,459 --> 05:22:08,779
popping up after an explosion one foot in one foot out of the group seems a bit

1887
05:22:08,779 --> 05:22:14,900
suspicious could be anyone he needs something I've got my suspicions hungry

1888
05:22:14,900 --> 05:22:23,139
no you hungry fingers it could be more than one for all we know West I'm gonna

1889
05:22:23,139 --> 05:22:26,180
take them out and give them a little snack and that's where I saw the

1890
05:22:26,180 --> 05:22:31,060
building 50% auto complex my promise has to be something you get to a part where

1891
05:22:31,060 --> 05:22:37,060
I can freeze it there you go all right this is gonna be the last BRB of the

1892
05:22:37,060 --> 05:26:14,349
night I'll be right back and then we'll have a 50% auto cam let's see how the

1893
05:26:14,349 --> 05:26:55,680
auto cam will work auto cam okay if he sits down let's see I don't 50% auto cam

1894
05:27:02,740 --> 05:27:23,659
well you won't you can't see the game okay can you see the game cooking down

1895
05:27:23,659 --> 05:27:30,459
to the final ten who cares about the game this tension with a spoon Nick

1896
05:27:30,459 --> 05:27:35,830
Romeo is still and we think in your party maybe you're still hope maybe the

1897
05:27:35,830 --> 05:27:42,020
pieces is too small but this is strange they're not showing anything bullshit

1898
05:27:42,020 --> 05:27:49,889
fuck is going on the show's really gone downhill oh the show's gone downhill

1899
05:27:50,090 --> 05:27:55,490
that's two clicks West just pass those trees pass the mines we just go get

1900
05:27:55,490 --> 05:28:00,099
through the field isn't there another way around the winds around the islands

1901
05:28:00,099 --> 05:28:07,700
200 meters open ground it gives us an advantage so you're on like a bright red

1902
05:28:07,700 --> 05:28:12,139
blanket how can someone who joined this is way too then suddenly be so risk of

1903
05:28:12,139 --> 05:28:17,220
us it doesn't contrast well at all I don't know it's better than fumbling

1904
05:28:17,220 --> 05:28:21,330
around in the dark just hoping to come across something okay what are our

1905
05:28:21,330 --> 05:28:28,659
options well there's one thing that I think my live auto reaction go on well

1906
05:28:28,659 --> 05:28:32,020
you said those guys use the mines to blow up the bridge yeah that means one

1907
05:28:32,020 --> 05:28:35,139
of those assholes is figured out how to rig those mines to blow up on command

1908
05:28:35,139 --> 05:28:39,580
that means it can be hacked if they can be had to figure out how their arms and

1909
05:28:39,580 --> 05:28:46,180
give it itchy head so what we take a live mine and deactivate always it is

1910
05:28:46,220 --> 05:28:51,380
here that sounds like it's gonna take forever but only for the first one is

1911
05:28:51,380 --> 05:28:55,939
mine's a smart which means it's probably part of a mesh network they send the

1912
05:28:55,939 --> 05:29:00,819
signal to arm disarm from mine to mine if I can figure out how to break one of

1913
05:29:00,819 --> 05:29:05,819
these guys security I can maybe disarm the whole thing at least the area we're

1914
05:29:05,819 --> 05:29:12,419
in wow that sounds like okay then fuckers why don't you go grab a big

1915
05:29:12,419 --> 05:29:15,619

yo you seen this on the subreddit defects yeah I'm not buying this thing

1938
05:33:00,330 --> 05:33:03,490
that's why Romeo is there

1939
05:33:24,139 --> 05:33:30,099
we've come this far yeah but where I was okay I was about to say I'm gonna walk

1940
05:33:30,099 --> 05:33:32,700
out of the theater but he said we've come this far

1941
05:33:33,700 --> 05:33:37,700
like shit like you they're right

1942
05:33:37,700 --> 05:33:45,349
moving he's not just some glory-seeking wannabe Otto here is convicted of

1943
05:33:45,349 --> 05:33:51,150
swatting another streamer well Otto did not do that no swatting call the cops

1944
05:33:51,150 --> 05:33:55,389
and said there was a hostage situation at the house of another player so they

1945
05:33:55,389 --> 05:34:06,540
would send an armed response and what happened to Otto is killed I didn't mean

1946
05:34:06,540 --> 05:34:11,740
I don't care about anyone's past the fact is we're already in this situation

1947
05:34:11,740 --> 05:34:16,779
and we have to keep going how do we know he's not the puppet how do we know

1948
05:34:16,779 --> 05:34:22,459
you're not the fucking puppet you want a fucking because it's me I'm the main

1949
05:34:22,459 --> 05:34:28,270
character is the puppet it's me what's that I might as well tell them at this

1950
05:34:28,270 --> 05:34:37,479
point shouldn't be out this far come on

1951
05:34:43,389 --> 05:34:54,560
yeah I kind of want to just finish this movie so I can put it back in the

1952
05:34:54,560 --> 05:34:58,240
blu-ray case and just put it in the closet must be close now you know I

1953
05:34:58,240 --> 05:35:02,680
don't want to have it be sitting in my ps4 after I just kind of stop watching

1954
05:35:02,680 --> 05:35:07,200
it you know I mean I it's like I've got to complete it so I can put it in the

1955
05:35:07,200 --> 05:35:20,549
case and put it in the closet all right well okay this is difficult because she

1956
05:35:20,549 --> 05:35:28,090
she woke up earlier before I did and she I don't know what she she like was do

1957
05:35:28,090 --> 05:35:32,560
we sit behind the building and then she's like what huh what and then we

1958
05:35:32,560 --> 05:35:54,490
already like kind of betrayed Otto but then Otto but Otto at low opacity and

1959
05:35:54,490 --> 05:36:04,459
put the stream behind him all right well I'll go with Otto because Otto was the

1960
05:36:04,459 --> 05:36:11,990
dog name and if I don't click Otto then everyone's gonna be pissed you don't

1961
05:36:11,990 --> 05:36:23,099
like that guy you like my dog you like this Otto oh look at him he's so long

1962
05:36:23,099 --> 05:36:36,509
and chunky look at his big chunky butt he's like a seal

1963
05:36:40,630 --> 05:36:52,759
no earlier a phone fell out oh it was switched on yeah sure just before the

1964
05:36:52,759 --> 05:36:59,290
drone came look I know coming from me what if he's making this up here's the

1965
05:36:59,290 --> 05:37:09,939
problem what if he called the drone he's just putting it on her but it's I tell

1966
05:37:09,939 --> 05:37:13,659
we need to confront her dude I think we need to get the fuck out of it we're not

1967
05:37:13,659 --> 05:37:35,090
just ditching her okay is he right oh is he aiming at my head he's oh god he's

1968
05:37:35,090 --> 05:37:38,409
aiming at me oh I thought Otto was aiming at me

1969
05:37:38,409 --> 05:37:46,180
Nick let her go in the spirit of the game now would it I do need you Nick

1970
05:37:46,180 --> 05:37:52,560
you're outnumbered anyway you shoot her we kill you you didn't think I'd come

1971
05:37:52,560 --> 05:38:00,069
alone did you I come the yeah remember us you and me we just need a little chat

1972
05:38:00,069 --> 05:38:20,200
what the hell is going on speedrun 100% auto no I mean didn't I tell you that

1973
05:38:20,240 --> 05:38:26,139
near the end I was gonna have to have a sacrifice but here's the thing what if

1974
05:38:26,139 --> 05:38:30,259
they're baking this up what if they're working together this could just be an

1975
05:38:30,259 --> 05:38:42,540
elaborate ruse this is an elaborate ruse they're working I knew it I told you

1976
05:38:42,540 --> 05:38:54,700
yep what are you doing we need him god damn it I knew it

1977
05:38:54,700 --> 05:39:08,159
no no no worries go I've been looking forward to this we had the root we had

1978
05:39:08,159 --> 05:39:35,400
the redemption arc too okay so now what what is the climax of this whole thing

1979
05:39:35,400 --> 05:40:49,270
right you're just at the beginning your face on autos he's using the webcam okay

1980
05:40:49,270 --> 05:40:52,470
I thought he was just saying he wanted to take a bath I wasn't paying too much

1981
05:40:52,470 --> 05:41:13,529
attention okay so what happens here how does this end the acting that well I

1982
05:41:13,529 --> 05:41:17,169
think it's not even bad was it that was like good acting that wasn't bad

1983
05:41:17,169 --> 05:41:34,950
acting what are you talking about I mean some of the acting is not good is not

1984
05:41:34,950 --> 05:42:00,279
good you think he's a bad actor I think that guy's pretty good I got this so

1985
05:42:00,279 --> 05:42:03,000
wrong I thought this guy was gonna die first and they kept him through the

1986
05:42:03,000 --> 05:42:35,830
whole game like comedy relief guy yeah stealth takedown how do you do a stealth

1987
05:42:35,830 --> 05:42:56,439
takedown if somebody's looking at you I don't know how I got over here what yeah

1988
05:42:56,500 --> 05:43:19,840
search where'd the knife come from I don't remember it was makeup no no I

1989
05:43:19,840 --> 05:43:32,349
don't think so what do you mean it was makeup all right dad it's makeup yeah well

1990
05:43:32,349 --> 05:43:55,869
fast fast fast fast fast really fast oh shit he didn't even say anything but

1991
05:43:55,869 --> 05:44:46,549
what do you have another gun upgrade nice go go get it hurry let's talk we

1992
05:44:46,549 --> 05:44:55,090
can still get on the blur and get this all sorted you awake again okay but

1993
05:44:55,090 --> 05:45:07,740
we're almost there the finale wait what what chance do you think you had you

1994
05:45:07,740 --> 05:45:15,680
fucking muppet see the decisions already be made okay but I'm still alive

1995
05:45:15,680 --> 05:45:21,759
around oh the deep fakes are out there as far as the world knows already dead I

1996
05:45:21,759 --> 05:45:32,319
can easily just show up and be alive they can't let you there will be

1997
05:45:33,220 --> 05:45:40,759
one survivor anyway oh my god I can't believe you just showed that what I

1998
05:45:40,759 --> 05:45:43,840
don't remember that happening everyone gets shot through their right eye by the

1999
05:45:43,840 --> 05:46:04,259
way now what put the gun down tish so we made it to the last two that's not

2000
05:46:04,259 --> 05:46:09,459
true doesn't have to end this what about what about the girl the blood in her

2001
05:46:09,459 --> 05:46:20,650
mouth you just dipped out there are no guarantees what then this right here is

2002
05:46:20,650 --> 05:46:26,709
the ultimate prize Nick that's bullshit you just don't get it do you you may

2003
05:46:26,709 --> 05:46:32,270
have lost your fame your fortune your friend but it's not seven times I never

2004
05:46:32,270 --> 05:46:38,310
had any of that to begin with I came here for my family and now I can have it

2005
05:46:38,310 --> 05:46:43,830
all hell with everyone else you can't change it Nick we gotta look out for

2006
05:46:43,830 --> 05:46:48,470
ourselves there's a better way we can put an end to all this bloodshed you

2007
05:46:48,470 --> 05:46:54,330
were better than this day you don't know me who I am you still have a choice I

2008
05:46:54,330 --> 05:47:06,479
never had a choice Nick don't do it your move fine don't make me do it don't make

2009
05:47:06,479 --> 05:47:14,080
me do it please dish never point a gun at something you don't intend to kill oh

2010
05:47:14,159 --> 05:47:17,389
you didn't tend to kill me okay well never mind

2011
05:47:17,389 --> 05:48:23,919
the broadcast is out you're dead anyway not if I skip the ending cutscene I can

2012
05:48:23,919 --> 05:49:02,009
do my own deep fake chaotic laughter I live nice do I survive that that's

2013
05:49:02,169 --> 05:49:13,200
really bad ending oh it's gonna be after credits it's a battle royale you went by

2014
05:49:13,200 --> 05:49:23,409
didn't win though because they bake the whole thing with CG characters like one

2015
05:49:23,409 --> 05:49:27,009
of the characters was saying earlier what is the point of even doing this

2016
05:49:27,009 --> 05:49:33,029
show if you can just have realistic completely uncanny Valley real people

2017
05:49:33,029 --> 05:49:49,979
CG of people doing this what's the point of doing this in real life that might be

2018
05:49:49,979 --> 05:50:06,409
the worst ending it could be it's probably at least like five endings the

2019
05:50:06,409 --> 05:50:17,240
full-screen auto well hold on not yet in one of the other endings you hack the

2020
05:50:17,240 --> 05:50:27,229
stuff and release the deep fake info okay all right let's get the credits and

2021
05:50:27,229 --> 05:51:02,159
see what happens there's nothing there that it gets it no morale nobody likes

2022
05:51:02,159 --> 05:51:18,500
me nobody loves me but I'm strong and smart I guess no one likes me but I'm

2023
05:51:18,500 --> 05:51:28,970
very strong and very smart okay decisions made 54 scenes view this 294

2024
05:51:28,970 --> 05:51:41,450
scenes holy shit damn okay no romances all right I'm gonna do one thing before

2025
05:51:41,450 --> 05:51:47,880
we go there's a short video I want to watch it's a short sorcery film about

2026
05:51:47,880 --> 05:51:57,909
this stream and the sorcery game but stream is essentially over next time

2027
05:51:57,909 --> 05:52:02,150
I'll be live it will likely be next weekend probably on either Friday or

2028
05:52:02,189 --> 05:52:10,020
Saturday or Sunday keep an eye on the sus likely Sunday either maybe Friday and

2029

penguin stripe okay I'm gonna grab this video real quick me one second will I

2033
05:53:06,470 --> 05:53:13,159
grab it but that's gonna conclude essentially the gaming portion of the

2034
05:53:13,159 --> 05:53:16,959
stream and I think this video is like you two three minutes four minutes I'm

2035
05:53:16,959 --> 05:53:23,810
like that those either to have never seen the sorcery playthrough is one of

2036
05:53:23,810 --> 05:53:30,610
the first streams I really did on twitch when I went to quote I'm a streamer now

2037
05:53:30,610 --> 05:54:04,669
when he what 2015 2016 link is okay

2038
05:54:04,669 --> 05:54:13,189
slam the walk turns over behind you hold on don't know it's good look at the

05:54:38,450 --> 05:54:56,459
right you ready this is called zap the old man a sorcery tribute and here we go

2041
05:54:56,459 --> 05:55:07,209
three the door of the stone building is slammed and the lock turns over behind

2042
05:55:07,209 --> 05:55:23,040
you is this gonna be a better movie a bench against one wall is the only piece

2043
05:55:23,040 --> 05:55:30,020
of furniture where an old man sits we're gonna go talk to it's a better movie

2044
05:55:30,020 --> 05:55:35,540
greetings old man he ignores you he is concentrating hard on something on the

2045
05:55:35,540 --> 05:55:40,299
ground just in front of him you glance upwards to the stars and suddenly the

2046
05:55:40,299 --> 05:55:46,810
old man shouts her sorcerer I knew it you're mistaken you reply cautiously oh

2047
05:55:46,810 --> 05:55:51,930
I don't think so you'll get us out of here better yet I haven't played anyone

2048
05:55:51,930 --> 05:55:58,930
for months silly not anyone smart sit down sit down hey what oh I swindle

2049
05:55:58,930 --> 05:56:05,009
stones of course swindle stones stranger in town don't know how to play better

2050
05:56:05,650 --> 05:56:10,889
he shows you one of his stones it is a strange for value to die he pats the

2051
05:56:10,889 --> 05:56:18,990
bench beside him with one hand shit play we can talk while I beat you this is

2052
05:56:18,990 --> 05:56:23,709
really really well made I'll go first show you how it's done the game is

2053
05:56:23,709 --> 05:56:30,459
simple we roll and bet on what's come up for instance I might start and bet that

2054
05:56:30,459 --> 05:56:35,659
between us we've rolled at least two truth how do I know what you have three

2055
05:56:35,659 --> 05:56:40,259
twos didn't you hear my last bid that was a clue at least unless I'm trying to

2056
05:56:40,259 --> 05:56:46,340
mislead you four twos I think you're trying to sleep oh yeah he had fucking

2057
05:56:46,340 --> 05:56:51,979
two twos so I get the I win when you win a round of swindle stones the other

2058
05:56:51,979 --> 05:56:56,779
person loses a die this game is so good by the way well two ones should do

2059
05:56:56,779 --> 05:57:03,439
therefore 20 years now hold on I need directions three threes oh yes we're

2060
05:57:03,520 --> 05:57:12,220
two four three screamer meta so he loses another die and he's at even more of a

2061
05:57:12,220 --> 05:57:18,139
disadvantage so what do they get you for one one it's a mistake one two oh I
