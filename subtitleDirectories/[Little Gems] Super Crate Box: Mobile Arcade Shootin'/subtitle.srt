00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,750
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a little gem.

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,890
This is the new series, if you missed the one from last week, where every Friday

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,350
I'm gonna go over my favorite mobile games, whether that be Android, iPhone, or iPad, and this week

4
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:29,969
we're gonna talk about Super Crate Box. Now a lot of you guys might already be aware of this game because it came out back in

5
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,270
2010 as a freeware PC game. That's right. You can go play this right now for free.

6
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,030
You don't have to download it, you don't have to buy it,

7
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,920
but I would highly recommend you actually do buy this game, and here are the reasons why. I'm gonna go over the game in general,

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,719
what the hell this thing even is.

9
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,799
So at its core, this game is an arcade shooter, and it's a platformer,

10
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,159
but the platforming is really just to dodge enemies and not get yourself killed.

11
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:57,880
It is one life, if you get hit you die, and the whole point of this game is to collect these crates.

12
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,920
They are gonna randomly drop in random places on the map, and there's not very many places

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,439
they can be, because as you see the levels are not that large, and as you collect these crates,

14
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,640
you're going to get another random weapon. It's a weapon crate.

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,920
So if I pick this up and I get a machine gun, that means I'll have a machine gun until I pick up the next

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,599
crate, and some of the weapons are very very good, and some of them are very hard to use or just straight-up bad,

17
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,400
and that's the nature of this game.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,120
It is all random, and the point is to get as many crates as you possibly can,

19
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,760
while defending yourself against waves and waves and waves and waves of enemies.

20
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,319
And if you check out the bottom of the screen, there's gonna be a fire pit there.

21
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:39,439
If they fall in that, if any enemy goes into that, they don't die.

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,879
They reappear at the top of the screen, turn red, and run really really fast.

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,250
So as you go during this game, as you pick up crates, you're gonna unlock a bunch of stuff.

24
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,689
You're gonna unlock new items, new characters, new levels.

25
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,569
It's just the whole thing is very very addicting, and it's very hard too.

26
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:59,329
This is not an easy game. You will die over and over and over again.

27
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:04,730
Think of it as like Super Meat Boy meets that game mode in Super Mario Brothers 3.

28
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:08,449
If you guys remember what I'm talking about, that old, that kind of looks similar too,

29
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,289
the level design is similar, where you were Super Mario, the POW button was right there,

30
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:14,610
and you had to kill all the enemies and collect the coins.

31
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,250
That's sort of what this game reminds me of, but at a much more hardcore level.

32
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:26,039
And speaking of hardcore, if you're looking for a challenge, this game definitely brings it, and brings it hard.

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,719
The normal mode is pretty difficult, but after you beat the normal mode at a certain amount of points,

34
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:37,400
you're gonna unlock SFMT, which makes more enemies spawn at a much faster rate,

35
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,319
making things incredibly difficult.

36
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,800
And then after you beat that at a certain point score, you're gonna unlock Ambush,

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,520
and it's just it's just crazy. They keep throwing all these challenges at you,

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,680
make the game progressively harder, and then it's all about personal records.

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,159
How far did you get in Ambush? How far did you get in SFMT? How far did you get in normal mode?

40
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,120
And they keep all these records for you that you addictingly want to break them all over and over again.

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,759
They remind you of this all the time.

42
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,639
Every single time you die, it's gonna pop up on the screen.

43
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,919
Hey, you died, but you know, you were pretty close to unlocking a character.

44
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,560
Get like five more crates, and you get a new character, or 20 new crates, you get a new weapon,

45
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,520
or a hundred new crates, and you might unlock this new game mode.

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,120
So it's just like, I gotta unlock everything, because I'm that type of person.

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,240
I have a very addicting personality, where if I sit down with an iPhone game,

48
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,599
I'm gonna sit there, and even when somebody tries to tell me to stop,

49
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,770
for instance, I will sit in the doctor's office, and they'll call my name, and I'll go,

50
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,449
damn it, I wish they didn't call my name, I want to get a hundred crates.

51
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,610
That is what this game is going to do to you.

52
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:43,569
This game is $1.99, two bucks on the iTunes store, and it is not currently on Android.

53
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:48,770
But again, you can play it for free on your PC or your Mac, if you go to the website in the description.

54
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,129
But like I said in the beginning, this is something you're gonna want to take with you.

55
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:54,150
And that's mainly because it's just so easy.

56
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,229
It's just so simple to pull this out of your pocket and start playing wherever you're playing.

57
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,870
And any game in this series, I play all these games when I do things that are boring.

58
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,069
So that is gonna wrap up this video, guys.

59
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,389
Thank you all so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.

60
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:12,389
And go check out Super Crate Box, it is a fantastic little gem of a game,

61
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:13,270
and you see what I did there.

62
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:18,160
But yeah, I'll see you guys all soon, and of course, take care, everybody.
