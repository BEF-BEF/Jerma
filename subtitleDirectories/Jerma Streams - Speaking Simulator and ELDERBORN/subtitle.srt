1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:10,650
All right. God, I hate. That's the worst comment of the whole year, but somehow also the best one.

2
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:27,829
All right, got a uh water. Stay hydrated, right? So the plan is to do speaking stimulator.

3
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:35,140
That's what was voted for. That's what was- that's what people voted for.

4
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:47,740
Why don't we just play- okay, listen to me. Why don't we just play it for like 10 minutes or

5
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,539
something? And we'll figure it out after that. Like, you want me to veto this?

6
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:01,420
Should I- should I veto this game? I already bought it. What do I- I might as well just play

7
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:09,930
for like 10 minutes. Play it for five minutes. All right, I'm gonna play it for five minutes.

8
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,680
Who cares? You haven't streamed in a week. I streamed like three days ago.

9
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:40,700
I've streamed in a week? Just refund it on stream. Same difference. All right, let me just come back

10
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:51,000
here. Uh, we can get this off the screen. So I'm gonna play it for five minutes and then I'll give

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,560
you- I'll give you some of the- you know, let me see. What have I got for- for veto options here?

12
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:09,259
Let me take a look. What do we got? We got- all right. Oh, you know what? I got elderborn.

13
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:22,889
Elderborn looks like it's- I was gonna play elderborn anyways. All right, it's either gonna be

14
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:34,620
elderborn or- I'm not starting the surge, too, right now. All right, bear with me. I'm gonna

15
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,629
play speaking simulator for five minutes. Put a countdown. Elderborn is snooze. It is? It looks-

16
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:57,460
it looks pretty fun. I'm gonna open it. I'm just gonna try it. I'm just gonna try it. All right,

17
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:38,889
I'm trying it. I just wanna try it. I just wanna play

18
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:47,379
for a few minutes. I'm gonna change the- yeah, hold on. Counting paper clips? That's not correct.

19
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:11,699
Here. It's even in the title, guys. All right, help me. Who did this? How about we do, um- help

20
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:21,300
me? Tongue movement, click and drag, lips, eyes, and brows to smile. W A S D's tongue.

21
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:37,459
Sorry, but you are now alive. I hope with your condition- I thought I was gonna read it.

22
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:51,939
How about that infiltrate and destroy human society? Okay, so hair. Meal, food, one? This is

23
00:04:51,939 --> 00:05:19,300
not very much specified. Chunk? What? I don't understand. Okay, this is you, a perfect human

24
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:27,290
replica, the peak of our engineering technology. Not this game. I know. Look at the title. Wink?

25
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:41,829
All right, let's go. Try the jaw mechanism. Look on your mouth and drag it down. Okay, that was

26
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:45,829
inspiring. You're very inspired. Very good, very good. Let- let- let this praise wash over you.

27
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,990
Good. Now that you're sufficiently motivated, you will learn to stretch and pucker your lips.

28
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:55,579
You can drag outwards from the lip center to stretch. Drag in towards the lip to pucker.

29
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:12,220
Okay. Activate tongue. Use W A S D to move up, down, left, and right.

30
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:30,180
Push the green buttons with your disgusting tongue muscle. Okay, I just did. Despite being an

31
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,579
unfeeling AI, I'm proud of you. You're ready to face real humans. So I have to talk? You have to

32
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:39,540
talk. Level one, the date. Can you stop playing now? Just read the title. Manager of human

33
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,540
resources, Karen, has asked us to meet at this human food dispensary. We do not know why.

34
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,339
Show caution. It is possible that they suspect we plan to destroy humanity.

35
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,420
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was terrible.

36
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,470
What button do I have to press?

37
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:22,899
Oh, I get it. Okay. I am glad we're doing it. Thank you. That knocked all my teeth out.

38
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:48,459
There's something going on here. Nothing is going on. I am just a normal person.

39
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:54,779
Okay, I got it. I think something's definitely going on. I think we both know that there's some

40
00:07:54,779 --> 00:08:39,370
attraction here. Yeah. I don't understand. Say it. I got it. You have such a flirt. I love it.

41
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,370
Let's get a drink and you can tell me more about how you like me.

42
00:08:44,330 --> 00:09:14,659
How many units currency are required to purchase two fermented ethanol beverages?

43
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:23,370
This game is me. Why have you been playing this game for six hours? I've not been playing this

44
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:46,379
for six hours. Let's look at the menu. Okay. Imagine playing this for six hours. It hasn't

45
00:09:46,379 --> 00:10:11,820
happened. Please forgive my error in requesting mechanical maintenance fluid. It was merely a

46
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:24,139
Somebody likes this here. Somebody likes this. I know they do. All right. My tongue's fucking

47
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:32,950
fucked up. Come on. Say it. What a treat. Not only are you gorgeous, but you get a sense of humor too.

48
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:48,860
I'm going to have some fun with you. Aren't I? I am a fun human with many fun. Come on. Get it.

49
00:10:50,250 --> 00:11:07,159
Touch it. I am an elegant mate. Got it. I was not expecting this to get so saucy so quickly. This

50
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:21,320
is going to be a great night. Incredibly normal. Even kind of cool. All right. Back to the base.

51
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:37,299
Upgrade the station. Let's do it. Pull out teeth. Why am I pulling my teeth out? What? What's this

52
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:53,750
for? Smile. Smile. Express your innermost feelings as if they exist. All right. Let's get it. Smile.

53
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:04,940
What else can I do? Left, right. Gain system control of your eyes. Okay. Sure. Now the game

54
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:17,750
got harder. Yeah. That is actually what's going on here. It's been 10 minutes. The office. Job

55
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:32,470
interview. Yes. Yes. It's actually. No. Hold on. It hasn't been 10 minutes. All right. You've been

56
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,309
working for a month. The great leader has summoned you into their office. Be on your guard. You must

57
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:40,710
secure this position. You're great to meet you in person. I've been reading your resume. I'm beyond

58
00:12:40,710 --> 00:13:38,460
impressed. What? Look happy. Isn't that happy? Oh. Exit this game. No, no, no. Not yet. Please call

59
00:13:38,460 --> 00:14:09,559
me Grant. All right. Well, let me at least like close face up. Pressing it. I'm pressing it. Why

60
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:26,779
can I not hit this? external matrix. Chad wants out. Just wait. I bought this. It's not even that.

61
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:58,360
It's a game where they charge. This game is ridiculous. All right. Just, just do whatever

62
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:11,019
the weird thing is. All right. We're going to open up elderborn. Okay, guys, we're going to open up

63
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:17,980
the game elderborn. Jump king. I'm not. What do you mean jump king? Don't make me play jump king.

64
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,980
What do you mean jump king? Don't say that. Why are people saying that? Don't do that.

65
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:34,570
It was fun. I told you it was going to be 10 minutes. I can't play jump king. I haven't played

66
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:45,370
it in so long and I'm going to be so fucked up. I can't do it. Let's try elderborn. If elderborn's

67
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:56,440
not fun, I'll play jump king. How's that sound? Rain world. What the hell is rain world?

68
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:16,250
Rain world? What is this? Rain world. He plays like a slug cat thing. No, not today. Not today. I

69
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:31,879
want to, I want to swing swords at people. Elderborn opening up right now. Speaking simulator.

70
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:46,700
We got a wink. Hold on. Game capture. And here we go. I actually have wanted to play this for a

71
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:53,559
little while. This was on the list today. All right. Wait, wait, wait. You'll get your wink.

72
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:10,099
Two winks. All right. We got sound. Let's turn subtitles on. Ambient volume. A little bit lower.

73
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:18,809
Music volume. A little bit lower. Sound effects. Global volume. All right. Three. What? Do you see

74
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:39,849
my cheek? That's like a spasm. I'm spasming. Gameplay. Difficulty. Elderborn is fine. Elderborn.

75
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:45,690
That's fine. Auto aim. Disabled. Gore. Particles and decals. Crosshair. Enable. Dense indicator.

76
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:51,609
Hit value. Fine. Field of view. Let's get that up to at least like 90. 90. I don't want to puke.

77
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:56,250
Controls. Mouth sensitivity. We'll bring this down a little bit.

78
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:07,049
Let's take a look. Change the title. Oh, shit. Yeah. Hold on. Play it for like 10 minutes.

79
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:20,759
Uh, first per FPS. What the fuck do I even title this? Should I keep it playing this for 10

80
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:35,480
minutes and I'm out here for like two or three hours? How about Elderquop? Here. How does this?

81
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:44,170
This is better. So then people will come to the stream and they'll do the uptime and be like,

82
00:18:44,170 --> 00:19:01,269
what the fuck? All right. Let's go. All right. I'm going to just ready. Let's get ready.

83
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:30,680
Right in the middle. This game looks fun. We've been told legends of the day that the sky has

84
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:37,400
fallen. The world filled with death and despair as the land of our ancestors turned to ash.

85
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:45,240
But the tribes, we survived. At the center of all destruction, a mighty city rose in the desert,

86
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,640
Yurmum. Feeding off the strange power flowing from the never-ending...

87
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:56,069
It's a webcam mic. It remained unconquered. A webcam mic. Relax.

88
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:03,829
Yurmum and its golden army was the bane of the realm for ages. The tribes toiled in shadow.

89
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:09,819
Its relentless grip enslaved and oppressed. It's just a little compressed because it was

90
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,099
big. They want to make it under like six gigs. United our tribes and led them against the city.

91
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:23,589
His name was Yannis, a hero anointed by elders, standing a giant among...

92
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:32,119
You making excuses? Yannis' warriors never returned, but the city fell silent.

93
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,039
Sealed shut. Dormant for centuries. But all of a sudden you guys care about voice acting?

94
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,079
Silent Hill 2 is some of your favorite game ever made. Our elders are the keepers of the past.

95
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,680
They tell us the city holds a great prize, the very secret of eternal peace.

96
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,079
Resident Evil 1 is like some of your guys' favorite game. You really care about voice work?

97
00:20:54,279 --> 00:21:01,160
In every generation, a champion of the tribes is chosen by the elders. With their blessing,

98
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:08,680
they are set upon a holy pilgrimage to explore the city. The champion is decided in trial by

99
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:26,630
combat. I've mastered all my brothers and sisters. In this generation, the holy quest is mine.

100
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:35,109
Leaving the familiar desert sands behind me, I enter the Forbidden Caves. This is the only

101
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:42,869
remaining way to the sealed off city. No one returned from the pilgrimage. Yet there is no

102
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:50,069
fear in my heart as I stare into the darkness. Gripping my weapon, I step into the shadows,

103
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:53,109
and the shadows come alive.

104
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:59,210
Some mechanism is working nearby. Activate a fountain to save progress. Drinking from

105
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,490
an active fountain will heal you but also bring back slain enemies. Dark souls!

106
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:29,990
Fix the FOV? What's wrong with it? What? Was 93 too much for you? Make it higher.

107
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:37,559
Left shift to dash in any direction. You can perform attacks while doing so. Use this to

108
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:42,410
your advantage.

109
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:55,450
Pay attention to the icon. What's that dash? Okay, you can only do it for like one second.

110
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:08,500
That is the Dark Souls sound. That is the quake FOV. What are you talking about? What?

111
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:24,779
Do you want more? Left kick. Oh no, you're gonna make me f**king puke.

112
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:43,019
Oh, there's stuff in here. I want to change kick to... I'm gonna change kick to one of the

113
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:55,690
worst mouse ever buttons. Kick is not going to be F. It's going to be this button. Okay.

114
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:03,779
Use healing file. Okay, that's going to be this mouse button. Next weapon, that's fine. Quick

115
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:11,619
swap is fine. One-handed blades. Alpha one. Alpha two. Alpha three. Oh, spoiler. 270.

116
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,109
Gamer mouse. All right, let's go. Is this death? Do I die if I go in here?

117
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:30,740
This guy's got a shield. Mouse three to kick through your enemy defense. Watch for counters.

118
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:52,519
F**k. This isn't Rain World. No, and you know what? You know what? I ain't ever gonna play

119
00:26:52,519 --> 00:27:19,779
Rain World. This might be useful. I ain't ever gonna play Rain World. No, I can jump up.

120
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:28,099
You weren't going to anyway. Maybe not. Maybe not. It depends.

121
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:36,039
That's key. Key fits. Open it. All right, here we go. First real test of the game.

122
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:54,410
I'm dead. I'm dead.

123
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:13,740
All right, I'm good. This door is open. Do I pick up souls or anything?

124
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:41,819
If you died in the undead asylum, give it a rest. Okay. All right, let's go.

125
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:53,609
Do I have eye frames if I dodge with this? Apparently not.

126
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:29,720
Die. Will you marry me? No, absolutely not. My girlfriend would have a real bad problem.

127
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:42,089
That one. Oh, there it is. Cover the souls? Got it. Five hundred and ten.

128
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:59,430
F.A. hands. Why? Interesting. Catacombs. I have a girlfriend. I'm not marrying somebody in chat.

129
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:11,240
Mouse four to heal yourself with the luminous file. All right. How many do I have? Just one?

130
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,160
I feel like I could get used to this and it'd be pretty fun.

131
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:41,450
This might be useful. Stop selling us on this game. I didn't do anything. Just playing.

132
00:30:42,329 --> 00:31:01,509
It's all about the block. Here's the door. Is this too loud? I think it's a little too loud.

133
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:15,160
Not anymore. He's doing a gameplay voice. What's a gameplay voice? What's a gameplay voice? What

134
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:34,789
does that mean? Gameplay voice? I'm just fucking talking. I'm talking. Does it wink? Can't get this

135
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:56,460
open. That was actually mad. He's in undead asylum. Dying in undead asylum. No, I'm not.

136
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:24,680
E3 game trailer. Let me just enjoy this. Oh, it slows motions. This feels like Oblivion.

137
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:33,769
So what do I do with a full meter? All right. I'm going to start talking like this for the

138
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:37,049
rest of the game so people don't fucking say that I'm doing an E3 voice.

139
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:46,900
No, shit. That is an E3 voice. Look, I'm a relatable guy from a city. I'm from Boston.

140
00:32:46,900 --> 00:33:02,710
I'm relatable to you. No, that's worse. All right. Just do Bugleberry. No, I don't want

141
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:21,740
3,000 people to leave. Do the auto voice the whole time. That is E3. How is that less E3?

142
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:34,710
Challenge completed. What is that? Challenge completed. What the hell?

143
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:46,700
Uh, might, speed, and resilience. Your attacks and skills deal more damage. Wait,

144
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:52,119
can I put points into this? You move faster and your attacks are more fast. You have additional

145
00:33:52,119 --> 00:34:18,920
hit points. Claim reward? Okay, I claimed it. How do I use it? I claimed it apparently.

146
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:27,739
Go back to universal paperclips. I beat it. I completed it. I beat the whole game.

147
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:51,989
This stream feels longer than 20 minutes. No, it hasn't. It's been, I don't know, like 15 minutes

148
00:34:51,989 --> 00:35:06,500
so far total. Should I even be opening these? I have like a max bar. What's it doing?

149
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:17,659
I regen health for the full bar. Oh, that's kind of cool.

150
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:27,179
Somebody said super frog. Speaking of super frog, uh, got something. I got something.

151
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:59,699
I'm gonna die. Get out of my life, please. All right. Now what? Got candy. It does have candy.

152
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:11,369
200 essence. Do I have a super frog? Uh, I have something coming up soon.

153
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:23,449
You guys really gonna like? Don't kill me, please. The fuck just hit me? I have a game compilation

154
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:41,340
that was highly requested. I got it. The orange box. I finally got the orange box. I'm trying to

155
00:36:41,340 --> 00:37:01,880
see what like the big hype about it is. Nothing in there. Fuck. This area kind of sucks. Finally

156
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:09,210
got rain world. People want to see you finish jumping. That's not gonna happen. I've been out

157
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,050
of the game for so long. It would take me like a whole, typically like three days to get back

158
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:20,619
to where I need to be to beat the DLC. I can't do it. No way. I got to, I got to where I wanted

159
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:36,469
to get to. Shit. Oh, fuck. This is bad. This is bad. Just kill him for me, please. Kill him.

160
00:37:39,289 --> 00:38:08,389
Oh, Jesus. Come on. Here again. Keep going up. Irma the turtle. Yeah, I'm level one. Of course

161
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:13,369
I'm going to be a turtle at level one. I know. What do you think? I am like level 30. I don't

162
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:39,179
want to lose this. If I lose, I'm going to move on to Jump King. Can I throw something? Missed.

163
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:48,650
Missed again. Oh, that was actually pretty cool. Whoa. That's a lot of people. That's a lot of

164
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:58,260
people. This game looks like Sea of Thieves. Stop. Don't make me laugh right now. I don't want to

165
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:15,559
lose. There's so many people here. Oh, fuck. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I'm okay. I haven't fallen.

166
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:27,619
Oh, boy. Come on. That was pretty good reaction to anything. Sea of Fucking Thieves. Come on, man.

167
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:41,210
Oh, boy. Still alive. No, no, no. I want him to die. I want him to die. That's what you sound like

168
00:39:41,210 --> 00:40:10,630
right now. How much further does this go? I probably have like six million HP. Oh,

169
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:30,900
what is that? Is that alive? Can I upgrade? I probably can. I hope so. Activate the thumb.

170
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:36,010
Made it to a fountain. Tab to level up. Leveling up is possible when the icon below is displayed.

171
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:48,090
Okay, let's heal and then let's level up. What should I do? Speed? Speed, damage, or health?

172
00:40:48,090 --> 00:41:02,760
What do you guys think? Speed. One percent. Two percent. Three percent. Five percent faster. I'm

173
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:18,619
five percent faster. Didn't I claim this already? All right, I'm good. I got the fountain. I've

174
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:34,119
leveled up. Let's keep going up. It's probably a boss right here. You guys are going to see me

175
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:40,440
play this boss and then all of a sudden like this steam page is going to get like 600 people new

176
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,239
traffic and there's going to be like 350 fucking new sales. It's going to be like,

177
00:41:45,239 --> 00:42:05,590
oh, that was awesome. I'm going to fucking beat this before he does. There's a lot more people

178
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:20,579
here. Dude, it's an ad. It's not an ad. Rain World now. I've never even heard of this game.

179
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:45,510
Oh, shit. Don't. It's a bad game. I don't know anything about it. There's no iframes.

180
00:42:56,389 --> 00:43:17,320
Who the fuck said that? You got the logs. How do they not block that? Are you kidding me? Come on.

181
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:36,820
Do it. All right. Can I kick you off? What you? Hold on. You stay planted? What are you talking

182
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:55,659
about? Do Rain World or I leave? We'll see you later. I'm not playing Rain World right now.

183
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:09,400
Get rainers. Get ready to riot. Where did this even come from?

184
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:28,840
Do I even have stamina bar? I don't think I do. All right. There's a shitload of people up here.

185
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,679
You didn't want to play it. So chat now is doing this because they want to be funny.

186
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:52,340
Play right. All right. I don't back up that much. I'm going to die. Wait till he swings.

187
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:58,730
Gameplay voice. All right. One, two. There it is. Opportunity comes up. Nice job.

188
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:04,730
There's a couple of swings. Do it again. Gameplay voice. Okay. One, two. No, let's try to get that

189
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:34,219
one. Tuber voice. I'm the ultimate tuber. Name me a better tuber. Come on. Can you?

190
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:51,460
Don't you remember Face Camp Fortress 2? I do. All right. This is somebody said Sea of Thieves. No,

191
00:45:51,460 --> 00:46:14,820
this is like Riddle Hollow and Outer Wilds. Oh, no. What's it called? What's that one called

192
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:31,099
with the black hole in the bottom? A Kinect game. Stop. All right. More speed. Sure.

193
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:35,900
Successfully parry a projectile to launch it at the nearest foe. Spend less time chasing after

194
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:42,650
essence. It will fly towards you on its own. I mean, that sounds, that sounds pretty good.

195
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:54,659
So when I parry now, it'll launch at somebody. All right. That's cool. That's pretty cool. Let's

196
00:46:54,659 --> 00:47:15,880
keep going. This doesn't open. Let's test it. Shoot at me. Shoot an arrow. Is that not a parry?

197
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:31,400
That's a projectile, right? The parry. All right. Where am I supposed to? Oh, there's a lever over

198
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:43,989
there. Okay. Am I supposed to jump and get this? No. Oh my God. Hold on. Fall off. No, there's no

199
00:47:43,989 --> 00:48:29,780
fall joke here. All right. I'm ready. Just pull the lever. Shit. I actually have to fight my way

200
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:40,019
down there. Oh, come on. What is this? A fighting game. Jump King now. No, I'm not playing Jump King.

201
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:57,960
That was a lie. So why is that? Am I not parrying correctly? I don't get it.

202
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:26,630
How's that on a parry? It's not. I'm very confused by that. This game is supposed to have music. I

203
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:32,659
think it's playing. I need a different weapon to parry. Oh, somebody's running behind me somehow.

204
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:57,159
Open this fucking door, please. Eight. Oh, down there. Come on. That door now opens.

205
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:08,219
Does that stay open? Can I save the game? This is pretty cool for on PS2.

206
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:28,420
All right. That's a level up right there. Let's go. Speed. Okay. I don't have enough essence.

207
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:35,909
All right. I'm 10% faster. I can do more damage next. Nothing stops the rain. I'm going to open

208
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:43,619
up rain world and people are going to be like, I don't like this. This is what's going to happen.

209
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:54,809
Character sheet. All right. Kill count. 83. Time played. More than I've said I was going to stream.

210
00:50:55,909 --> 00:51:22,300
Chests open. What should I get to a boss? What do you mean no bosses? Let me just get to a boss

211
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:29,559
first before everybody freaks out. I mean, I'm not getting the essence for this, but whatever.

212
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:42,179
Easy to get rid of them. This game's too violent for me. I'm sorry. This is what we're doing,

213
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:53,989
though. Need more enemy variety. Well, it hadn't been very long. Really? Breaking this will require

214
00:51:53,989 --> 00:52:14,760
some heavier tool. Oh, great. Can I go anywhere else? Wink. If you speak while playing a game,

215
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:24,019
an E3 presenter. I can't even talk. Otherwise, I'm an E3 presenter.

216
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:50,059
Guys, I can go this way. I can go this way. Remember, if you say the thing you're doing,

217
00:52:50,699 --> 00:53:03,380
you're in. Blame the E3 gameplay fucking demos. It's nothing to do with me. Pick up.

218
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:22,230
Ooh, and a block. Ooh, that looks like a parry. That's a parry. That's absolutely a parry.

219
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:48,889
Wink scam. You only got like three more days on that, by the way. Well, I didn't die,

220
00:53:48,889 --> 00:54:03,800
so that's good. Sell them now. I don't even need to jump. You just go, you walk up these

221
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:09,500
and you get 5,000 points in three days. Probably. It'll probably be all right.

222
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:21,429
This is not... Oh, is this not a heavier tool? Wait, this is not what I was supposed to do?

223
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:55,480
Spear is not heavier than a sword. Well, okay. Refuge. I call this place a refuge with dark

224
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:07,500
sarcasm. It seems less dangerous than the fire pit below. Fire pit below. You got it. Dark sarcasm.

225
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,739
Tap right mouse button at the right time to parry. You can parry unblockable attacks.

226
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,829
Attacks marked with that icon cannot be parried. All right, nice.

227
00:55:20,889 --> 00:55:34,090
That was fucking cool. That was really cool, actually. Are you gonna do something?

228
00:55:40,010 --> 00:56:04,869
What? How is that not a parry? Nice parry. I thought it was. What? Okay.

229
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:38,199
Why did it work that time? He was slightly too early. That's all right.

230
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:46,059
All right, look for a tool. A heavy tool. Well, are they fighting each other?

231
00:56:47,260 --> 00:57:22,920
It's a fucking scorpion down there. This is really confusing. So, is it gonna be later than this?

232
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:46,090
All right. Oh my God. Monka S. Minus 300 viewers. Monka S. Ah! I thought it was a set piece.

233
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:52,539
I thought it was a set piece. I thought it was a set piece. Oh well. I thought it was

234
00:57:52,539 --> 00:58:16,309
calcified or something. I don't know. I didn't think it was alive. There's only 500 viewers left.

235
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:35,400
Shit. Fuck. I better play Risk of Rain. I better hurry up and get on that. Die here?

236
00:58:38,469 --> 00:58:42,710
So, I'm gonna have to parry this. These scorpions are fucking scary. Here we go.

237
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:52,809
Parry. That happens very quickly. Holy shit. I'm not supposed to be down here. I don't think I'm

238
00:58:52,809 --> 00:59:07,559
supposed to be down here. Holy shit. I'm not supposed to be down here. There's so many

239
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:20,219
fucking scorpions. I'm not supposed to be down here. I'm hiding. Is there a fountain?

240
00:59:24,780 --> 01:00:01,400
I'm definitely not supposed to be here. I need to find a tool. Okay. Well, I'm up here. What? So,

241
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,840
am I not supposed to go down this way? I don't understand. I died in like one hit down here.

242
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:49,980
Find a tool. That's better. I'm almost dead again. Did that guy just spawn? That was weird.

243
01:00:55,349 --> 01:01:12,969
Wink scam? God. It's getting deleted. Use them now. It's gone in like in less than 24 hours.

244
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:40,710
I'm absolutely not supposed to be going down here. I'm already dead. Is there a different way to go

245
01:01:40,710 --> 01:02:03,610
besides? Hold on. Play funny jump game. No. No. There's a fountain right there. Why? I'm just

246
01:02:03,690 --> 01:03:26,940
keeping it on. I didn't press any button. Stab each other. I killed it. All right. Now what?

247
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:37,659
You don't have to parry every attack. If I don't, I'm going to get hit and die. I'll be dead.

248
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:58,250
Watch out for that fire. Don't touch it. Give me that. Say the funny word. What's the funny word?

249
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:06,699
What do you want me to say? Maybe getting hit and dying is a good thing. I don't think so.

250
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:13,019
Like five people said they were coordinating in like a discord.

251
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:19,820
Play this rain game and now all you guys are latching on to it. Don't get manipulated.

252
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:47,030
Play Wayne's World? Am I reading that wrong?

253
01:04:49,880 --> 01:05:12,170
Somebody say play Wayne's World for Super Nintendo? Okay. Still going good. Hello board?

254
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,710
Somebody's shooting arrows at me. From where? Oh, over there.

255
01:05:15,989 --> 01:05:34,739
Wait, I can. That hurt. Never mind. Wayne train leaving the station.

256
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:53,860
Get out of here. What was that fucking hit box? Am I like 60 feet long?

257
01:05:53,860 --> 01:06:09,619
I don't even fight these things. I don't even worth doing that.

258
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:27,210
Like King's Quest? That's not a bad idea. King's Quest is pretty fun.

259
01:06:27,849 --> 01:06:34,360
People could like talk shit and stuff and we could have like a fun back and forth about like

260
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:39,719
what do I do? What do I do with the bubblegum? Do I combine the bubblegum with the stick?

261
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:42,760
And everyone's going to be like not like this fucking idiot. What are you doing?

262
01:06:44,760 --> 01:07:21,590
Sounds like fun. All right. I'm not done yet. I'm not done until I get to a boss

263
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:46,789
and then I uninstall the game. Oh sick fountain. Let's go. I haven't leveled up yet.

264
01:07:49,179 --> 01:08:01,860
Dude's sick. Dude's sick. He thinks there are bosses. There is. There really isn't.

265
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:19,159
Need a tool. Oh, there's a key. Let me get this. All right. Now I get the key to that door that's

266
01:08:19,159 --> 01:08:30,659
over there. I can level up. There's another one down there, but not worth it. All right.

267
01:08:30,659 --> 01:08:41,159
Now let's go open the door that's over here. Where was it? Down? Where was it over here?

268
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:53,850
I can't get back up here, can I? I think I have to drop down. I guess I gotta go down here.

269
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:10,779
Fire pit. Interesting. Okay. Interesting. Let's see if I can kill these guys. Oh,

270
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:15,020
there's three of them. All right. I'm ready for. Hey, here we go.

271
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:35,560
Um, this is, this is like fucking a hundred over here. Who cares? I got a door to open.

272
01:09:40,739 --> 01:10:11,050
Oh, come on. Come what? What? Give me a break. Why? Where was this door? It was back here,

273
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:25,130
wasn't it? Do I still have the key? Thank God. Somebody's probably behind me too.

274
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:32,489
Everybody careful. I told you there was bosses in this game. What did you? I told you there was a

275
01:10:32,489 --> 01:11:02,550
boss. Give me the hammer. Oh, I got a hammer now. Game just got way better. Okay. I can. Okay. So

276
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:14,539
now we go. I'm going to go back to where that down here, right over. Will you please? Why don't I

277
01:11:14,539 --> 01:11:33,100
put this up to my face? Me mad? Who? Who is over there? What's the name? Why are you so? Why are

278
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:39,420
you mad about them? What are you mad about? What's wrong? What's the matter? I'm going to

279
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:56,710
kill them all in one swing. Ready? Watch this. Close enough.

280
01:12:17,609 --> 01:12:21,529
All right. This game just went up a fall letter grade because of this weapon.

281
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:37,609
Wham. You want rain world. Wham. You want rain world. Shit. Come on. Just hit one.

282
01:12:44,920 --> 01:13:03,770
Why? No, don't activate it. Activate, activate, activate. Okay. Let's get up.

283
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:14,359
All right. Can I not get up from here? I think I'm stuck down here.

284
01:13:17,239 --> 01:13:34,359
Can I not get back up from this way? 600 people left. It's my fault. No, that's, that's on them.

285
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:39,859
Guys, for all you know, 600 people just got like a fucking call and they had to get on a phone call.

286
01:13:39,859 --> 01:13:43,460
They had to go to like the doctor or something or they were going to eat dinner or it was not

287
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:48,539
going to bed. You don't know it was my fault. I had nothing to do with it. 600 people just got a

288
01:13:48,539 --> 01:14:00,199
phone call. I can't get, I cannot get back up here. Can I?

289
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:20,579
It hurts so much. Just play rain world. I'm going to open rain world like three weeks from now

290
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:30,600
and play the first five minutes and then delete the game. Can I not get out of here?

291
01:14:30,600 --> 01:15:04,579
How do I get back around? Uh, wasn't there another one of those patches somewhere? I mean,

292
01:15:04,579 --> 01:15:08,420
there were two walls. There was another wall I could break. I don't know where it is.

293
01:15:09,699 --> 01:15:25,989
Over here. Over here. Back to that boss door. I don't even remember where the fuck it is.

294
01:15:26,949 --> 01:15:33,500
They use the wrong fountain.

295
01:15:35,979 --> 01:15:49,020
There ain't nothing down here. Well, let me go back this way. I have to go through here, right?

296
01:15:51,189 --> 01:16:03,539
No, do I? Through here and back up around. Go up this way. Don't get killed by a fucking scorpion.

297
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:09,609
All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Back up here.

298
01:16:10,489 --> 01:16:16,899
Is that boss door thing? If I can make it by this without aggroing the whole room.

299
01:16:17,779 --> 01:16:53,770
And you just, that was embarrassing. All right. All right. I've almost had enough. You died? I

300
01:16:53,770 --> 01:17:06,859
know I died. What do you think? I don't have the same screen on as you. All right, pull these guys

301
01:17:07,260 --> 01:18:03,819
out. Oh my God. Should I try to parry? All right. I just fucking annihilated this dude. Let's go.

302
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:26,819
All right. You know what? I don't even care. Let's just go. Like, what the fuck?

303
01:18:34,760 --> 01:19:05,659
There's nothing even in here. Why is there a third guy? Shit. There's nothing even in here.

304
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:24,090
All right. I got to level up. I like sneak out of here and just check every crevice. Hold on.

305
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:35,560
All right. That counts as a boss. Is there a fountain up here?

306
01:19:44,659 --> 01:19:58,390
Fuck. Oh my God. I'm in so much trouble now. Let me die. All right. Well, I know that my shit is

307
01:19:58,390 --> 01:20:33,180
over there. It's a full level up worth of stuff. Okay. We're good. Oops.

308
01:20:53,939 --> 01:21:00,899
It's a sticky key. Wait, why is sticky keys on? All right. I'm good. All right. I'm almost done

309
01:21:00,899 --> 01:21:38,180
with this game. I wanted to play it. It's fun. I just mauled it into sticky keys. It's fun.

310
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:52,310
Quick. Get the fuck out of here. Sex is safe. Game over. We win? No, you don't win.
