1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:08,470
You ordering Chinese food? All right, you ready? I got it, I got it. You want me to tell you what

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:28,550
I want? Here we go. Crab rangoons. Spare ribs. Noodle. That's it. All right, let's open Elven

3
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:36,250
Assassin. Stop killing time here. I feel like it's been a majority of this stream. Sorry for

4
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:44,600
everybody that wanted some more VR for Mind Show. It's kind of hard to work with sometimes. So I

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,850
know a lot of people may have left. Uh, I'm sorry. Just do what I can, right? That's all I can do.

6
00:00:52,409 --> 00:01:09,109
Elven Assassin. Let's try it. Spare ribs. Oh yeah, the spare ribs are the best. Elven Assassin.

7
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:20,819
This is an early game. I'm sure it is. Hey, but thanks for sticking it out. I say that a lot, but

8
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:24,420
you know sometimes you come across shit that you didn't know existed in the first place, so

9
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:34,599
appreciate the support. Let's go. I'm ready. This is an early access, so some things will

10
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:42,040
improve along the way if you find any issues. All right, well this is wrong again. Jeremy.

11
00:01:42,840 --> 00:02:04,980
Uh, I gotta change this from Mind Show to Elven Assassin, unfortunately. ABCD.

12
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:17,610
I like cringed people out of the channel. Archery platforms don't match your play area. It should

13
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:27,620
be not be used to play. Okay, whatever. Single player is fine. RPG, I guess. What the fuck is

14
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:37,539
happening here? No, the same shit that happens every time you play VR. What was that one? Oh,

15
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:44,259
I put it in the chat. Oh, you did? Oh, wait. Okay, ready? Graduate goon. Okay. Spare ribs.

16
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:50,020
Okay. And some kind of noodle. Like mulling? Yeah. Okay. All right, sorry about that. No,

17
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:56,039
it's all right. It's all good. You're good. You're good. It's all good. And some kind of noodle.

18
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:13,620
That was Kim. Virtual reality. Hey, pay fucking $299 to not have this happen. God damn

19
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:47,639
consumerists. Uh, defend the Elven town. Sure. Get the fuck off me. This is pretty. How do I play?

20
00:03:48,280 --> 00:04:13,319
I, I don't know how to play. Okay. All right. Ah, shit. I'm not good. Not good.

21
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:57,370
Fuck. All right, got it. Wave three. All right. I win. Wave survived. Wave four.

22
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:47,860
What? Somebody climb it up here. Breaking in. What? What happened? Oh, my face. God damn it.

23
00:05:47,860 --> 00:06:27,259
I'm gonna break my VR. Oh, fuck. Breaking in. Whatever. He'll be fine. He's slow. Just

24
00:06:27,259 --> 00:07:29,350
go around him in a circle with a rope. This is just mind show. They're breaking in. Come on.

25
00:07:35,160 --> 00:08:14,550
All right. I've got it. I'm good. I'm good. Oh, that was good. Good. Breaking in.

26
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:45,429
Full of fire. Is this the whole game? Breaking in.

27
00:08:48,299 --> 00:09:14,120
Shit. Who's left? Who's even left? Can I go over there? Oh, I'm so good at video games. You have

28
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:22,460
no idea. Watch this. Watch this one. Just fucking feast your eyes on this shit. Just zoom in on this.

29
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:37,580
Just fucking download that. Download this one. Breaking in. This giant jacket is killing me.

30
00:09:37,580 --> 00:10:40,600
I'm not fucking this one up. Oh, you dick. Right in the head. Come on. Come on. Breaking in.

31
00:10:43,750 --> 00:11:15,769
Oh, thank God. Right in the head. Come on. Really? Game's kind of good.

32
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:26,299
All right. Let's summon Jax for this one. Ready?

33
00:12:33,539 --> 00:13:04,250
Fuck. Come on. This stupid giant.

34
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:51,419
All right. I'm done. I'm done with this one. I'm done. We're moving on.

35
00:13:52,059 --> 00:14:00,389
This is fun. This is fun to do this. God damn it. I'm done. I'm off. Get me out of here.

36
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:34,840
Not anymore. We're done. Breaking in. Oh, I got it. Not yet. Not yet. Horror game? No,

37
00:14:34,840 --> 00:15:03,669
not right now. You don't really... Horror? Ugh. Fine. Let's do Dreadhalls. Can I beat the game?

38
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:28,200
We'll find out. Jerma lied about Minecraft VR 5 community stuff. I didn't lie. I did do it.

39
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:34,019
All right. So the title of the stream is Improv Acting Workshop. And we're going back into

40
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:57,769
Dreadhalls. I feel like the title can stay. Let's get it open. You ready for some acting?

41
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:13,500
Are we doing sweat? Eh. It's okay. Uh, where is it? What the hell is going on?

42
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:27,769
Show sweaty. There you go. See how red I am. VR takes a lot out of you guys. It really does.

43
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:37,620
Where is my... God computers. Don't fucking buy them. All right. I've had a few drinks.

44
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:51,029
We can go into Dreadhalls. See if I can beat it. I'll give it a try. I will. Solid attempt.

45
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:10,980
I'm in the last section of the game. I should be able to do it. Let's get some courage here.

46
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:28,700
Dr. Steen 5 community subs. Thank you. I'm going to wake up tomorrow.

47
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:51,180
All this hair off. It's too fucking expensive. All right. Dreadhalls. I'm not afraid of no ghosts.

48
00:17:51,180 --> 00:18:04,390
Let's fucking do it. Oh, it's so scary. Oh, two headphones in this time. We're almost at the end

49
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:18,619
of this game. I'm going to beat it tonight. Two headphones. Let's go. Oh, it's so scary.

50
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:27,000
Fucking horror games. Shut the fuck up. How do you move? I forget the controls, but who cares?

51
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:53,339
I don't know how to move. I'm serious. That's the map. Okay. How do you move faster? Okay. I got it.

52
00:18:53,339 --> 00:19:13,099
I got it. I know what I'm doing. Let's go. Oh, so scary. Monsters. What the fuck are you doing?

53
00:19:28,059 --> 00:20:16,200
What's up there? Oh, these shit guys. I'm sorry. I'm going to relax. I think I said wonka.

54
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:06,890
Open for a scroll. I sat down and turned off my lamp once more, but this time the shadowfall came

55
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:14,140
to me. I didn't run. I raised my gaze and moved to touch them. They blended with me, agony,

56
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,420
freedom, despair, understanding. Shut the fuck up.

57
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:35,960
What do you got? To be judged. To prove your worth. To satisfy your curiosity.

58
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:45,029
All to be forgotten here, like many others before you. I'm not picking my ass and moving to court.

59
00:21:45,990 --> 00:22:27,900
How do I get the fuck? What is that for? Did I go the wrong way?

60
00:22:44,920 --> 00:23:45,880
This way? Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Okay. Let's go. What does that noise mean? Watch it.

61
00:23:46,680 --> 00:24:19,269
This way. Shit. Okay. That's quiet. Oh, okay. What is this? What is this? What are you doing?

62
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:47,099
What is it in these hands? Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Okay. Okay. Hold on.

63
00:24:53,849 --> 00:25:44,789
Nothing. Nothing. God damn it. Who's the dog? Jesus Christ. That was the best YouTube reaction.

64
00:25:49,140 --> 00:26:11,240
Let's go. You can only sprint for so long. I'm going to go right. I'm not going to go straight

65
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:32,140
ahead. Let's go right. I need oil. Fuck. I have no oil. How do I have no oil?

66
00:26:49,910 --> 00:27:50,329
Oh, God. Nothing. Come on. What's in here? Oh, give it to me, please. I've seen the pillars.

67
00:27:50,329 --> 00:28:00,150
They shine and chant. Fucking Jesus Christ. Give it to me, please. Burn him. Burn him.

68
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:41,349
Why did it go up? It's being left. Straight down. Oh, thank God. Okay. Checkpoint. I can see you

69
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:51,369
now, reader. You will not sit. You lied to me. Whatever. Can't you hear them, liar? It's the

70
00:28:51,369 --> 00:29:23,910
pillars. They are chanting your name. Whatever. Get me the fuck out of here. Left. Oh, yes.

71
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:42,779
Got it. Got it. Fuck yeah. Let's go. One. Two more. Oh, that sucks. Okay. We're going this way,

72
00:29:42,779 --> 00:30:15,460
then. That's it. Through here? Let's go. Is this right? I don't think it's right.

73
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:41,059
Didn't I already have one? Oh, I'm stupid. What an idiot. What an idiot. I know. I know. I know.

74
00:30:41,059 --> 00:31:22,099
This way. Let's go. Two more. Let's go this way. What the fuck is that?

75
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:37,619
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Open. Open. Open. Open. Open. This is

76
00:31:37,619 --> 00:32:04,890
hard lock. Which way? Straight? What is this? Oh, fuck. What does that mean? What does that mean?

77
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:33,589
Oh, shit. I don't know what that means. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Is it the lady? Come on.

78
00:32:34,150 --> 00:33:32,119
From here? I have no idea. What's it say? This is very loud. This way. What the fuck does that mean?

79
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:53,210
What does that even mean? Oh, shit. I don't know what that means. Oh, my god. I don't know what

80
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:58,710
that means. Oh, my god. I don't know what that means. I don't know what it means. How do I turn

81
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:37,530
this off? Oh, I don't know what it means. Oh, my god. Just sit here. Oh, fuck. Come on. Shit. Oh,

82
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:44,789
my god. I don't know what character it is. I don't know what it is. Oh, fuck.

83
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:44,460
Oh, my god. No fucking way. Jesus Christ. The same thing happened. So I check. There you go.

84
00:35:44,460 --> 00:36:04,760
You're such a good actor. It's like you were really scared. God damn it. Let's go. It's hard

85
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:15,030
to talk when these are in. Immersing myself. Ay, ay, ay. Jesus Christ. Okay. Well, let's go.

86
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:43,510
Tuber reactions. Let's go. Speed run. Come on. Speed run. Not fucking around. Let's go.

87
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:54,460
Get to the eye. Right here. It's gonna be right here. Stupid game.

88
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:15,130
Come on. Just get there.

89
00:37:45,210 --> 00:38:04,659
What is that? What is that? What is that? I don't know what that is. Oh, I'm gonna go this way.

90
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:35,659
Fuck. Shit. No. Wrong way. God damn it. I need one more eye and that's it.

91
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:52,869
Fuck me. Come on. Get it. Beat this game. Oh, god. Come on. Let's go. I've never seen that monster.

92
00:38:52,949 --> 00:39:33,429
I know this. What is over here? Is it the dog? Is it the dog? Don't be the dog.

93
00:39:40,280 --> 00:40:10,550
You hear that? Oh, shit. Oh, some creatures are attracted to your light. Okay. Let's go tell them.

94
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:20,150
Okay. I'll be over here. I'll be over here. Okay. What are you talking about?

95
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:40,059
What? What is talking? Who's talking? Holy shit. God. Give me a fucking. Jesus. Fucking Christ.

96
00:40:41,349 --> 00:41:25,260
Holy shit. Oh, fuck. Please, God. Oh, my fucking God. Jesus. That was terrifying.

97
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:39,139
Fuck me. P-break? No, I'm good. No, I'm good. I'm good. I got water right here.

98
00:41:42,949 --> 00:42:10,570
It's empty. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let's go. Let's go. That was terrifying.

99
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:19,780
Turn your light off. What the? Jesus. God. This is the scariest game I've ever played

100
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:25,699
and I've had a few drinks. It's fucking terrifying even with like four glasses of wine. God damn,

101
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:40,809
man. Come on. How did I end up here? I don't know. Why am I playing Dread Halls?

102
00:42:41,769 --> 00:43:06,840
Oh, I don't know. It just kind of happens, huh? All right. Let's go. Fuck. I have the hiccups.

103
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:20,760
Nothing. Of course. I will. I'm going to beat this game before the stream turns off.

104
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:47,349
I swear to God. I don't care. Open, motherfucker. Oh, is there a lady in here? Oh, shit.

105
00:43:47,349 --> 00:44:16,469
Oh, shit. Let's go this way. I got oil. Oh, fuck. Oh, God. Get out of here. Get me out of here.

106
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:23,159
Jesus Christ. It's right behind me. It's right behind me. It's right behind me. It's right behind

107
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:25,079
me. It's right behind me. It's right behind me. It's right behind me. It's right behind me. It's

108
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:31,429
right behind me. It's right behind me. What a dumb room. What a stupid fucking room.

109
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:45,460
Oh, close the fucking door. Oh, God. Damn it. What is that? Who is in here? Don't open the

110
00:44:45,460 --> 00:45:39,800
fucking door. Don't. Do not open the door, please. Right. What is that? Oh. Oh. I found. I don't care.

111
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,559
You're okay. Let's go. Give me the eye. Come on. Oh, fuck you. Oh, fuck you. Oh,

112
00:45:53,639 --> 00:46:04,039
fucking streamer. Fuck you, you know. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Twitch Prime is a thing.

113
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:14,380
Don't. Don't subscribe with Twitch Prime. Who cares? Just watch for free. You fuck me.

114
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:47,269
You know what? Fuck this guy. This guy sucks. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Get him out of here.

115
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:59,500
Oh, I'm so good at Twitch. Fucking subscribe to me if you want to. Don't.

116
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:52,250
Fuck you. What's up? Yeah. Fuck. What's the way to go? I have no fucking idea. What? Did it open that way?

117
00:47:55,719 --> 00:48:15,769
I don't know what's going on here. Fucking don't. I think I'm with the right way. Okay.

118
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:42,139
Gabe sucks. Okay. Oh, shit.

119
00:48:44,519 --> 00:49:18,820
Oh, straight. Oh, fuck you. Oh, okay. Let's go. Come on. I'm at the end of the game. The pillar is

120
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:25,559
the gate between the worlds. Not for you. No, you have been tainted. Like all of us, your place is

121
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:40,090
here too, bombed by the shadows. You can't escape. You belong here. Oh, god damn it. Fuck you. No.

122
00:49:41,050 --> 00:50:13,400
What is this? What? What? What? Where do I go? What the fuck? I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

123
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:51,980
Please. Oh, please. Okay. Get them both. Use the oil.

124
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:01,820
There it is. You ready? I don't know if I'm ready. We'll find out.

125
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:16,300
Shit, it's the brow noise. We're all going to shit our pants.

126
00:51:41,110 --> 00:52:12,599
Why? I don't. Oh, I got to. Oh, yeah. Why? Okay. Great. Good job. Fuck off.

127
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:22,099
Fuck you, wall. Get out of my way. I'm going right to the portal.

128
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:50,250
I'm going to sprint to the portal. Ready for this shit? Watch this. What? I'm going to beat this

129
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:59,480
fucking game. Watch this. You ever seen a streamer beat dreadholes on the stream?

130
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:19,420
Line them up. Because it's me. Look at this darkness. Find me somebody else. Okay.

131
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:26,139
Find me somebody. You're one of them. All right. Get in there. Go. Get in there.

00:55:30,409 --> 00:55:37,900
Zero. I can do this shit for like six to ten hours. And I'm out of here for like a day.

Who is it?

167
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:11,289

186
01:01:28,659 --> 01:01:30,840

Making jokes to make yourself feel better.

200
01:01:59,579 --> 01:02:07,380
I can't get by him.

201
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:09,380
Ugh.

202
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,380

01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:11,380

It's okay.

222
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:21,449

01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:24,439
What are we going to do now?

253
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:31,420
My stocks are dropping. I don't care.

254
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:37,800

255
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,800
It might be time to go

256
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:50,659
to bed. In like an hour.

257
01:10:50,659 --> 01:10:52,659
Going is not a bad idea.

258
01:10:52,659 --> 01:10:57,140

01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:28,100

01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:42,760
Are you serious?

266
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,760
Let's go over this because somebody said I was dying.

267
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,319

268
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:58,250

273
01:12:09,779 --> 01:12:11,779
been on the decline. It's alright though.

274
01:12:11,779 --> 01:12:17,079

01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:20,020

276
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,329

01:13:35,909 --> 01:13:45,430
What the fuck?

288
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:48,439
Let me get rid of that. I don't want this shit. This is going to tank

289
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:56,310
in like fucking six months.

01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:36,539
No. That can't be right. That

300
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:47,979

01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:47,510
That's how much I'm worth. I don't believe that.

309
01:15:47,510 --> 01:16:00,569
What's up with that? 30 bucks.

310
01:16:00,569 --> 01:16:03,449
Joel's worth more than me? What?

311
01:16:03,449 --> 01:16:06,840
Joel was worth more shares than I am.

312
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,079
That's fucking. That's unbelievable.

313
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:11,699
That's bullshit. How do I sell this?

314
01:16:11,699 --> 01:16:15,659
Let's buy fucking 130

315
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:17,659
bucks. Come on. I'm 26?

316
01:16:17,659 --> 01:16:24,729
Sell it. Unbelievable. 30.

317
01:16:24,729 --> 01:16:29,270
What am I? I've got a pretty good jump today though.

318
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:31,510
26. Where the fuck is my

319
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:37,850
jump? No. People are selling.

320
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:39,850
Who is selling right now?

321
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:43,159
Look at this. This is one hour. Don't

322
01:16:43,159 --> 01:16:51,609
sell. People are selling me and I can't

323
01:16:51,609 --> 01:17:02,170
fucking even believe it. People sold after

324
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:04,170
the AVC joke. It wasn't a joke.

325
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:08,970
It was an experience. Alright.

326
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:14,149
Alright. I swear to God

327
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:16,520
I'm not this fucking crazed.

328
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,520
Your hair is your most number one important

329
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:25,050
asset. 26 bucks. I'm

330
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:27,420
worth fucking 75. I swear

331
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:34,060
to God. Alright. Let's do

332
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:36,619
one more Dread Halls

333
01:17:36,619 --> 01:18:38,550
map. Now that I'm getting the fuck out. It's cheap.

334
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:42,010
It's cheap. Oh, that's cheap

335
01:18:42,010 --> 01:19:06,140
today. I knew it. I knew it.

336
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:09,720
I knew it. No.

337
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:18,359
Don't buy. I'm sitting down for this next one.

338
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:24,939
I'm sitting down. I'm not

339
01:19:24,939 --> 01:19:27,930
standing. Fuck it. Buying

340
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:31,260
in a bull market. Whatever.

341
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:38,550
Do you see this name? Wait. Wait.

342
01:19:38,550 --> 01:20:08,300
Wait. Wait. Give me a second.

343
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:31,079
Insider trading.

344
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:33,770
What does that say?

345
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:36,260
The biggest... Google, Amazon, Twitch,

346
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:38,260
Streamlabs, Mail, Yahoo, Login, Streamlabs,

347
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:40,949
Teespring. What's down here? Regular?

348
01:20:40,949 --> 01:20:42,949
The biggest waste of time.

349
01:20:42,949 --> 01:20:45,510
No annual fee. Okay.

350
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:55,609
Give us a fuck. If

351
01:20:55,609 --> 01:20:57,609
my stock is not worth $5,000 tomorrow

352
01:20:57,609 --> 01:20:59,609
I'm gonna quit streaming for the next

353
01:20:59,609 --> 01:21:01,609
6,000 minutes.

354
01:21:01,609 --> 01:21:08,760
You know what to do.

355
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:20,220
Insider trading.

356
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:22,220
How did I gain viewers doing? How?

357
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:25,020
Why did you come here?

358
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:27,020
What are you doing here?

359
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:29,020
Like 400 people showed up. What did I do?

360
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:31,020
I didn't do anything.

361
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:36,069
I didn't do anything.

362
01:21:36,069 --> 01:21:38,069
God. Fuck it. Did you want to fucking

363
01:21:38,069 --> 01:21:44,859
subscribe? I hate myself.

364
01:21:44,859 --> 01:21:47,659
Let's go.

365
01:21:47,659 --> 01:21:49,659
Let me sit in my fucking like streamer

366
01:21:49,659 --> 01:21:59,960
chair. More Twitter?

367
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,960
No. I already got who I need.

368
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,960
I'm gonna be worth a fucking trillion dollars

369
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,840
in like six weeks.

370
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,840
It's the IRS? I paid

371
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,840
taxes.

372
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,840
Whoa, Texas.

373
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:19,300
Don't get me started on that.

374
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:23,529
Get off the fucking screen.

375
01:22:23,529 --> 01:22:27,239
Alright. Are you

376
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:29,239
chumps? No, you're not chumps. You're fucking

377
01:22:29,239 --> 01:22:31,239
valued members of the community.

378
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:38,710
Where am I? Why would I call you chumps

379
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:51,319
that's fucking not nice?

380
01:22:51,319 --> 01:22:53,319
Maybe like 5% of you are chumps.

381
01:22:53,319 --> 01:22:55,560
Maybe. The people that like say that you suck

382
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,560
and your streams are terrible.

383
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,800
I would give you like a D-minus.

384
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:04,579
Get the fuck up.

385
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:09,130
I don't need this fucking

386
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:13,989
chair. Where is it? I'm standing.

387
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:21,800
Maybe like 1.8%

388
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,489
of you. Fuck off.

389
01:23:24,489 --> 01:23:26,659
The other like 99.6?

390
01:23:26,659 --> 01:23:28,659
You guys are fucking hell yeah.

391
01:23:28,659 --> 01:23:38,010
You're stupid.

392
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:41,020
I know. I know I'm dumb.

393
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,020
I've lived 34 years on the planet. You don't think I

394
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:45,319
know this? You don't gotta tell me

395
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:47,319
I'm fucking dumb. I know this already.

396
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:49,319
I have 126 IQ

397
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:51,319
and a fucking 60

398
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:53,319
performance IQ. I know this already.

399
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:55,319
I gotta tell me every day.

400
01:23:55,319 --> 01:23:57,319
What the fuck is

401
01:23:57,319 --> 01:23:59,560
going on?

402
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:32,250
I don't know what's going on. Hey.

403
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,250
Hey. Hey. I don't think so.

404
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:36,619
I don't think so.

405
01:24:36,619 --> 01:24:57,159
What the fuck is happening? Who is

406
01:24:57,159 --> 01:24:59,159
who are you? It's a chair.

407
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:21,109
The eyes of a hawk.

408
01:25:21,109 --> 01:25:28,779
Alright. Let's go.

409
01:25:28,779 --> 01:25:43,750
Did I do something wrong?

410
01:25:43,750 --> 01:26:03,109
What the fuck?

411
01:26:03,109 --> 01:26:06,119
Say it with me. Say it

412
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:09,000
with me. Say it with me.

413
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Say it

414
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,520
with me or I'm fucking

415
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,520
I'm gonna knock every stream

416
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:20,229
again.

417
01:26:20,229 --> 01:26:22,229
I'm just doing the same

418
01:26:22,229 --> 01:26:24,729
thing.

419
01:26:24,729 --> 01:26:29,720
The next person that says E is

420
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:32,409
getting banned. I swear to god.

421
01:26:32,409 --> 01:26:34,579
I can't handle that shit

422
01:26:34,579 --> 01:26:44,060
anymore. It's just a naked guy.

423
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:46,939
I'm gonna fucking grab him by the fucking

424
01:26:49,819 --> 01:26:57,100
Okay. Goodbye.

425
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:36,699
One more. Random.

426
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:11,050
Twitch.tv

427
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:15,079
What?

428
01:28:15,079 --> 01:28:17,079
I don't know where I was going with that.

429
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:19,079
I just said the name

430
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:21,829
of the website.

431
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:26,180
What is this fucking dumb story?

432
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:32,140
Are you having a good

433
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,140
time? Are you having fun?

434
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:44,939
Are you having fun? You better.

435
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:46,939
That was embarrassing.

436
01:28:46,939 --> 01:28:48,939
Whatever. Fuck it. Who cares? I suck.

437
01:28:48,939 --> 01:28:52,260
I tried to catch it.

438
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:57,640
Okay.

439
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,640
Alright. I don't understand.

440
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:03,850
Oh shit.

441
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:16,500
God damn it.

442
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,500
Oh god damn it.

443
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,500
Don't move.

444
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:27,960
Why would you do that to me?

445
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,960
Why would you do that to me?

446
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,960
Why would you do that to me?

447
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,960
Oh my god. I'm gonna die.

448
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,960
I'm gonna die on camera.

449
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,960
I'm sorry I have to leave. It's really hot in there.

450
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,960
Oh my god. Are you serious?

451
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,329
Why would you do that to me?

452
01:29:42,329 --> 01:29:44,630
Why would you do that? He's trying to kill me on camera.

453
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:46,630
Why the fuck would you do something like that?

454
01:29:49,449 --> 01:29:51,449
It's really hard to contain myself. My knees hurt.

455
01:29:51,449 --> 01:29:53,449
Oh my god. What the fuck happened?

456
01:29:53,449 --> 01:29:55,449
Why would you do that to me?

457
01:29:55,449 --> 01:29:59,989
Why would you do that to me?

458
01:29:59,989 --> 01:30:09,720
Why would you do that?

459
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:17,720
I can't.

460
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:23,909
Oh my god.

461
01:30:23,909 --> 01:30:25,909
I just felt the hands on me.

462
01:30:25,909 --> 01:30:27,909
She's done that before.

463
01:30:27,909 --> 01:30:31,300
She's in trouble.

464
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,500
I'm gonna give her a lecture.

465
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:41,340
Oh Jesus Christ.

466
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,340
You can't do that to somebody when they're in VR.

467
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,340
That's like the number one fucking rule.

468
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:47,340
You can't do that to

469
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:49,340
somebody when they're in VR.

470
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:52,460
I'm done. I'm gonna sit here

471
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:54,460
and hang out with you guys for a little bit.

472
01:30:54,460 --> 01:31:00,279
Jesus Christ. I can't do it anymore.

473
01:31:00,279 --> 01:31:02,779
Fuck me. Give me the chair.

474
01:31:02,779 --> 01:31:26,579
Get this out of the way.

475
01:31:26,579 --> 01:31:28,579
I'm returning this.

476
01:31:28,579 --> 01:31:30,579
I'm gonna return the Vive.

477
01:31:30,579 --> 01:31:44,279
This phone for a while.

478
01:31:44,279 --> 01:31:56,819
We made her do it?

479
01:31:56,819 --> 01:32:12,810
Anybody got a clip? I wanna see it.

480
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:14,810
What the fuck was that?

481
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:17,430
She was in here for a long time.

482
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:21,449
Hold on.

483
01:32:21,449 --> 01:32:47,350
Let's see it.

484
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:49,529
I wanna see.

485
01:32:49,529 --> 01:32:59,939
She was in here for a long time.

486
01:32:59,939 --> 01:33:01,939
Oh my god. Give me a break.

487
01:33:01,939 --> 01:33:05,079
What the fuck?

488
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:10,649
Hold on. You guys can't.

489
01:33:10,649 --> 01:33:15,060
Before that?

490
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:17,369
What?

491
01:33:17,369 --> 01:33:38,090
How long was she in here for?

492
01:33:38,090 --> 01:34:01,579
I had no idea.

493
01:34:01,579 --> 01:34:04,260
Anybody have the whole thing? I wanna see the whole thing.

494
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:13,270
I'm gonna die on camera. Is this it?

495
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:15,270
What? She's in the closet?

496
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:17,510
When did she get in the closet?

497
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:22,420
What?

498
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:24,420
Why is she in the closet?

499
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:26,420
What?

500
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:28,420
How long was she? What?

501
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:30,979
No, she was not.

502
01:34:30,979 --> 01:34:32,979
She was in here from the break?

503
01:34:32,979 --> 01:34:34,979
I don't fucking believe it.

504
01:34:34,979 --> 01:34:36,979
No way. 30 minutes?

505
01:34:36,979 --> 01:34:39,220
I don't believe it.

506
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:41,220
No fucking way.

507
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:44,039
She was in there for 30 minutes.

508
01:34:44,039 --> 01:34:49,979
Why?

509
01:34:49,979 --> 01:34:54,199
No, she wasn't.

510
01:34:54,199 --> 01:34:59,260
She was in there for 30 minutes?

511
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:03,350
She's trying to kill me. Jesus Christ.

512
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:05,350
Go watch the VOD. I'm gonna bring up the VOD right now.

513
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:13,930
Why?

514
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:16,810
Why would you do this?

515
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:21,420
She's hiding in the closet.

516
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:23,420
This is what I get for not having the fucking chat.

517
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:29,369
She's in there here?

518
01:35:29,369 --> 01:35:31,369
No, she's not.

519
01:35:31,369 --> 01:35:33,369
No way. Hold on a second.

520
01:35:33,369 --> 01:35:45,000
She's unbelievable.

521
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,300
I thought she was ordering food.

522
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:51,270
Let's watch this. I wanna see this.

523
01:35:51,270 --> 01:36:03,739
She's not in there, is she?

524
01:36:03,739 --> 01:36:07,060
No. What?

525
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:17,220
She's gotta be kidding me.

526
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:22,470
That's so scary.

527
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:26,380
I can't.

528
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:28,380
Alright, that's it.

529
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:50,390
Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me.

530
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:52,390
I'm gonna fill the closet with concrete.

531
01:36:52,390 --> 01:37:49,220
I'm fucking muted.

532
01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:02,789
What do the stocks look like?

533
01:38:02,789 --> 01:38:04,789
What do the stocks look like? Let's take a look.

534
01:38:04,789 --> 01:38:08,439
Did I go up at all?

535
01:38:08,439 --> 01:38:14,579
I fucking have nothing to say.

536
01:38:14,579 --> 01:38:24,420
She was here the whole time.

537
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:29,739
Jesus Christ.

538
01:38:29,739 --> 01:38:31,739
I'm doing okay. I'm at 26 bucks.

539
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:34,680
That's better than fucking not marrying many people.

540
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:40,949
Well, I think that's gonna be it.

541
01:38:40,949 --> 01:38:42,949
That's a good time to go up.

542
01:38:42,949 --> 01:38:46,600
You took off the headset when she started to open it.

543
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:52,170
Too early?

544
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:54,170
Oh, let's hang out then. Fuck it. Let's go.

545
01:38:54,170 --> 01:38:57,369
I'm selling my German stocks.

546
01:38:57,369 --> 01:39:05,500
Look at this peak right here. That's a huge peak.

547
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:22,199
I mean, that's a sell point right there.

548
01:39:22,199 --> 01:39:28,090
Oh my god.

549
01:39:28,090 --> 01:39:30,779
What a scream.

550
01:39:30,779 --> 01:39:32,779
Insider trading? It's okay. It's Twitch stocks.

551
01:39:32,779 --> 01:39:35,319
Alright, I got money.

552
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:38,699
Let's go home. What do we got?

553
01:39:38,699 --> 01:39:40,699
Uber Haxonova.

554
01:39:40,699 --> 01:39:55,380
That's too much money.

555
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:57,380
Uber Haxonova is worth some money.

556
01:39:57,380 --> 01:40:04,300
That's at 37 bucks. What the fuck?

557
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:06,300
I don't know who any of these people are.

558
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:13,449
Oh!

559
01:40:13,449 --> 01:40:21,899
Trending! Trending!

560
01:40:21,899 --> 01:40:24,260
Nine bucks?

561
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:50,810
That's a fucking steal.

562
01:40:50,810 --> 01:41:03,800
What do we got? 30,000?

563
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,800
Alright, I think I got a good portfolio.

564
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,680
What's my portfolio? Account.

565
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:11,619
Let's see what we got.

566
01:41:11,619 --> 01:41:13,619
We got Vinesauce, Kiwo, Dr. Disrespect,

567
01:41:13,619 --> 01:41:15,619
Forsen, XQC, Destiny,

568
01:41:15,619 --> 01:41:17,619
Uber Haxonova, Mizkif, Tylo and a Ninja.

569
01:41:17,619 --> 01:41:20,890
Where's me?

570
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:26,260
Ninja's all...

571
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:28,260
I sold myself right off.

572
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:30,260
Fuck, you're right.

573
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:32,890
It's okay.

574
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:36,920
That's a good portfolio.

575
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,920
I don't think that's a bad portfolio.

576
01:41:38,920 --> 01:42:01,819
Is there anybody who named Mike?

577
01:42:01,819 --> 01:42:04,180
Nine bucks?

578
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:13,189
What are these gains?

579
01:42:13,189 --> 01:42:16,840
What the fuck are these gains?

580
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,840
Dr. Disrespect for five dollars and twenty cents.

581
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:22,680
Okay. I got a lot of Vinesauce.

582
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:25,239
I got a lot of Mizkif.

583
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:29,399
I don't know. Should I have that much

584
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:32,729
of Mizkif? I don't know about that.

585
01:42:32,729 --> 01:42:36,310
I think that might be too much.

586
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:38,310
I think that might be too much.

587
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:40,310
I got a lot of Kiwo.

588
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:48,250
Kiwo on the rise though, for real.

589
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:51,319
Mizkif.

590
01:42:51,319 --> 01:43:03,289
Grillmaster doesn't exist, guys.

591
01:43:03,289 --> 01:43:05,289
Look at back here though.

592
01:43:05,289 --> 01:43:07,289
9.48?

593
01:43:07,289 --> 01:43:09,289
This is going to come back.

594
01:43:09,289 --> 01:43:27,060
Tomorrow.

595
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:29,060
What the fuck? Are you kidding me?

596
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:33,029
No! Fuck! No! Shhh! God damn it!

597
01:43:33,029 --> 01:43:55,539
Wait! Really?

598
01:43:55,539 --> 01:43:57,539
I want as much as I can get a Kiwo. I'm serious.

599
01:43:57,539 --> 01:44:03,350
Look at this. Kiwo is going to fucking explode.

600
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:05,850
Look at this.

601
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:08,600
Already on the fucking uptake.

602
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:10,600
Buy as much Kiwo as you can possibly fucking purchase.

603
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:21,220
I'm serious.

604
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:44,010
Come on. Look at this. Are you serious?

605
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:49,060
I can't even do it.

606
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:58,470
It's fucking parabolic!

607
01:44:58,470 --> 01:45:04,869
Alright. What time is it?

608
01:45:04,869 --> 01:45:06,869
Ten? Fuck it. Let's hang out. AMA.

609
01:45:06,869 --> 01:45:11,159
Ask me almost anything.

610
01:45:11,159 --> 01:45:14,859
Let's go to IRL. I don't give a fuck.

611
01:45:14,859 --> 01:45:40,380
I'm not done. That's better.

612
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:42,619
Just chatting. No! Fuck you, Twitch!

613
01:45:42,619 --> 01:45:44,619
Give me a break. I can't believe it.

614
01:45:44,619 --> 01:46:05,779
That's better. Okay.

615
01:46:05,779 --> 01:46:13,399
Alright. Ask me anything.

616
01:46:13,399 --> 01:46:16,859
I'll ask me anything right now.

617
01:46:16,859 --> 01:46:19,289
What's my actual height? 5'7.5".

618
01:46:19,289 --> 01:46:25,050
With shoes on 5'8". I'll measure it if you want.

619
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:29,399
Favorite YouTuber?

620
01:46:29,399 --> 01:46:32,789
Donkey.

621
01:46:32,789 --> 01:46:40,600
Yeah. Probably.

622
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:43,159
What am I going to do? Breakfast tomorrow?

623
01:46:43,159 --> 01:46:49,300
Yogurt.

624
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:53,380
That's it. What do I think of Growmaster?

625
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:55,380
He's a fucking piece of shit.

626
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:57,619
He's a leech.

627
01:46:57,619 --> 01:46:59,619
Whatever it takes to get viewers from my stream.

628
01:46:59,619 --> 01:47:01,800
It's unfortunate but that's just the truth.

629
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:05,880
Sorry to say.

630
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:07,880
What's my favorite casino in Las Vegas?

631
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,880
Now that's a really good one actually. That's a really good one.

632
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:12,060
I have a real answer for you.

633
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:14,300
Are you ready? This is no bullshit.

634
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:17,609
The Aria.

635
01:47:17,609 --> 01:47:19,909
The Aria in Las Vegas

636
01:47:19,909 --> 01:47:21,909
on the strip, if you're talking strip casinos,

637
01:47:21,909 --> 01:47:24,600
is my favorite casino.

638
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:27,100
I love the Aria.

639
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:30,939
And Circus Circus because the place is dumb.

640
01:47:30,939 --> 01:47:36,060
But it's a good place though.

641
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:38,060
It's fun.

642
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:40,060
People are like fucking juggling and flying around in the ceiling.

643
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:43,060
Circus Circus is number two.

644
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:45,060
Aria is...I look like

645
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:47,060
fucking insane. Hold on. Give me a second.

646
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:53,659
Jesus Christ.

647
01:47:53,659 --> 01:47:55,659
I'm going to get presentable. My God.

648
01:47:55,659 --> 01:48:01,479
That's not going to fucking do anything.

649
01:48:01,479 --> 01:48:04,869
Oh my God.

650
01:48:04,869 --> 01:48:13,260
How do I get a Chad face?

651
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:19,140
Like this.

652
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:21,829
Am I mad at Kim?

653
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:24,949
No. What? It's funny.

654
01:48:24,949 --> 01:48:27,319
Comedy trumps everything. Okay?

655
01:48:27,319 --> 01:48:29,319
If somebody does something at your expense and it's funny,

656
01:48:29,319 --> 01:48:34,359
it's fine.

657
01:48:34,359 --> 01:48:36,359
No. Why would...she's wonderful.

658
01:48:36,359 --> 01:48:38,359
What? Why would I be mad at my girlfriend?

659
01:48:38,359 --> 01:48:40,359
For like hiding in the closet

660
01:48:40,359 --> 01:48:42,659
for 30 minutes. No.

661
01:48:42,659 --> 01:48:46,180
That was great. Only Chads have

662
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:48,180
kids. I don't have any kids. I'm never going to have kids

663
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:50,180
and it'll never happen. Next.

664
01:48:50,180 --> 01:48:55,819
What's my workout routine?

665
01:48:55,819 --> 01:48:59,659
I'll show you. That's it.

666
01:48:59,659 --> 01:49:04,899
This is that once a day. Favorite fruit?

667
01:49:04,899 --> 01:49:06,899
Banana. Nah.

668
01:49:06,899 --> 01:49:08,899
Banana sucks. Um...

669
01:49:08,899 --> 01:49:11,699
Lemon. It's probably lemon.

670
01:49:11,699 --> 01:49:15,289
Why don't I want kids?

671
01:49:15,289 --> 01:49:17,460
Because you have to change their diapers and they shit all over

672
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:21,300
themselves. That's it.

673
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:34,359
Am I a vegan? No.

674
01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:37,109
Never will be.

675
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:39,109
Hamburgers are too tasty. I could never do it.

676
01:49:39,109 --> 01:49:41,739
Steak and cheese subs

677
01:49:41,739 --> 01:49:43,739
are the reason I could never be a vegan.

678
01:49:43,739 --> 01:49:45,909
Because of Philly cheesesteaks.

679
01:49:45,909 --> 01:49:47,909
I eat them like once a year. But that's the

680
01:49:47,909 --> 01:49:53,289
reason. Would I eat lab

681
01:49:53,289 --> 01:49:55,289
grown meat? Yeah.

682
01:49:55,289 --> 01:49:58,619
Why not? I would try it once.

683
01:49:58,619 --> 01:50:00,859
If I didn't like it then fucking I would fucking

684
01:50:00,859 --> 01:50:04,699
delete my Twitch Prime.

685
01:50:04,699 --> 01:50:06,699
Longest gone without changing underwear?

686
01:50:06,699 --> 01:50:08,699
That's a pet peeve of mine. Not even a day.

687
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:10,869
I change my underwear once a day.

688
01:50:10,869 --> 01:50:13,239
You think that's bullshit?

689
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:16,060
How could I prove that? There's no way.

690
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:22,579
Longest I've gone without showering?

691
01:50:22,579 --> 01:50:25,460
A day. One day.

692
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:28,020
One day! That's it.

693
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:31,859
That's it. You used to be such a

694
01:50:31,859 --> 01:50:33,859
meathead. Did you really stop lifting? Yeah

695
01:50:33,859 --> 01:50:36,359
it just became too much.

696
01:50:36,359 --> 01:50:38,359
I walk every day because I'm a fucking boomer.

697
01:50:38,359 --> 01:50:40,920
I'm 34 in September.

698
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,920
Do you guys understand that? I'm 34.

699
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:44,920
I'm 34

700
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:46,920
in like a few months.

701
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,920
That's fucking old.

702
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:50,920
I can't go like throw weights around

703
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:55,079
anymore. You understand?

704
01:50:55,079 --> 01:50:57,079
I can't do that anymore.

705
01:50:57,079 --> 01:51:03,859
I wish I could. What's my

706
01:51:03,859 --> 01:51:05,859
birthday? August 4th.

707
01:51:05,859 --> 01:51:10,789
I did, I, that was

708
01:51:10,789 --> 01:51:14,890
the, I told you I didn't want to give the

709
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:16,890
it's in September. I don't know why I did that.

710
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:21,880
Any conventions or meetups in the

711
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:24,380
future? Well it's funny you say that.

712
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:27,579
There is a place

713
01:51:27,579 --> 01:51:29,880
in Las Vegas called

714
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,880
the Level Up Lounge.

715
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:35,699
Okay. This place is really

716
01:51:35,699 --> 01:51:37,699
cool. They got like games. They have like skee ball.

717
01:51:37,699 --> 01:51:40,010
They got like fucking

718
01:51:40,010 --> 01:51:42,010
it's pretty cool. They got like a bar.

719
01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:44,010
There's Jenga.

720
01:51:44,010 --> 01:51:46,010
There's whole, there's like pool tables.

721
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:49,449
I was thinking

722
01:51:49,449 --> 01:51:51,449
now hold on don't quote me on this. I'm

723
01:51:51,449 --> 01:51:55,029
about to say it but don't quote me. I might.

724
01:51:55,029 --> 01:51:57,029
Don't fucking quote me on this.

725
01:51:57,029 --> 01:51:59,979
I'll be very upset about it. I might

726
01:51:59,979 --> 01:52:02,340
see if I can do a

727
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:04,340
private party. Don't fucking

728
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:08,569
you dare quote me on this.

729
01:52:08,569 --> 01:52:10,569
Where I rent out the Level Up Lounge

730
01:52:10,569 --> 01:52:14,020
and we just have a fucking good

731
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:17,989
time. Don't quote me on that.

732
01:52:17,989 --> 01:52:19,989
But I thought about it. Seems fun.

733
01:52:19,989 --> 01:52:25,300
The Level Up Lounge is in

734
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:27,300
the MGM casino in Las

735
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:30,250
Vegas. And I'm like fuck

736
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:32,250
going to E3. What happened here?

737
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:35,060
Fuck E3. Fuck

738
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:37,060
I was going to say the T word.

739
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:39,060
Fuck like E3.

740
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:41,060
Fuck like PAX West.

741
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:43,060
No. Let's do our own shit. Right?

742
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:45,819
Let's do our own thing. Come to

743
01:52:45,819 --> 01:52:47,819
Germacon at the Level Up Lounge.

744
01:52:47,819 --> 01:52:52,229
This isn't real.

745
01:52:52,229 --> 01:52:54,229
Like I hope they don't piss off somebody

746
01:52:54,229 --> 01:52:56,229
at Level Up Lounge. It's a great place.

747
01:52:56,229 --> 01:52:58,229
The place is fucking great.

748
01:52:58,229 --> 01:53:00,229
It's a really, really clean, wonderful

749
01:53:00,229 --> 01:53:02,600
place with a great bar.

750
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:08,229
We'll see. Come to Brazil.

751
01:53:08,229 --> 01:53:10,229
I don't know. I don't got any money.

752
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:16,180
Germacon at the Level Up Lounge.

753
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:18,180
You can do a private party. We'll see. It might be fun.

754
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:20,359
There's a karaoke. You can like do

755
01:53:20,359 --> 01:53:22,359
LAN parties. There's like a VR.

756
01:53:22,359 --> 01:53:24,359
There's an entire VR setup

757
01:53:24,359 --> 01:53:26,359
at the Level Up Lounge in MGM.

758
01:53:26,359 --> 01:53:29,050
If you work for MGM,

759
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:32,180
you don't have my phone number but I might

760
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:37,500
give it to you at some point. That would be a lot of fun.

761
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:40,630
To do a full on like meetup

762
01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:43,000
but open bar

763
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,430
and like open

764
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:47,430
karaoke, open VR setup.

765
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:49,430
I would just pay for the whole fucking

766
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:51,609
thing. And we could have like a good time.

767
01:53:51,609 --> 01:53:53,609
If you're in Vegas for a fucking weekend, come on out.

768
01:53:53,609 --> 01:53:55,909
This isn't really yet but it might be

769
01:53:55,909 --> 01:54:00,970
in like a few months. Open bar is a

770
01:54:00,970 --> 01:54:02,970
bad move. No it's not. It's a

771
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:07,960
good move. It would be

772
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:09,960
21 plus. Sorry.

773
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:12,140
It would have to be. Get

774
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:14,140
Penn and Teller. I would do my own magic

775
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:20,600
tricks. Open bar with VR.

776
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,600
I think that would be fun. It would

777
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:26,119
be. If I ponied

778
01:54:26,119 --> 01:54:28,550
up the cash to have whoever

779
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:30,550
I mean, here's the thing I didn't understand

780
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:32,550
before I moved to Las Vegas is there's a

781
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:34,789
lot of people that live

782
01:54:34,789 --> 01:54:36,789
in Vegas. A lot of you guys live here.

783
01:54:36,789 --> 01:54:39,720
And in LA. So

784
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:42,470
fuck it. Let's do it. I don't care how much

785
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:46,949
it costs. Fuck it. Who cares?

786
01:54:46,949 --> 01:54:49,579
It don't fucking matter. That doesn't matter.

787
01:54:49,579 --> 01:54:52,010
If I can afford it, oh

788
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:58,920
you better fucking believe we'll do it.

789
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:02,380
Fuck it. VR chat

790
01:55:02,380 --> 01:55:07,750
meetup.

791
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:09,750
Jerma lied about Minecraft VR5

792
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:14,939
community subs. Thank you. You could do that?

793
01:55:14,939 --> 01:55:17,239
I probably could. I really

794
01:55:17,239 --> 01:55:19,239
don't think that would cost that much money.

795
01:55:19,239 --> 01:55:22,569
Is this drunk talk? Not really.

796
01:55:22,569 --> 01:55:24,810
It's more like just hang out talk.

797
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:30,699
You can ask

798
01:55:30,699 --> 01:55:33,260
Kim. Me and Kim went to this

799
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:35,260
place. And we specifically

800
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:37,260
it was like how fun would the speeders do with a meetup here?

801
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:40,010
Because I get you know

802
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:42,010
you can do a meetup at PAX. You can do a meetup at

803
01:55:42,010 --> 01:55:44,010
E3. No. Fuck it. Let's do our own.

804
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:46,439
Let's do our big

805
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:50,220
bits. Oh Jesus. What happened?

806
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:52,220
Colonel Zero thanks for the 50 bucks.

807
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:55,029
Can you pay for my plane ticket?

808
01:55:55,029 --> 01:55:57,029
No I can't. I can pay

809
01:55:57,029 --> 01:55:59,029
for the booze at the bar.

810
01:55:59,029 --> 01:56:01,399
And the space. But I can't

811
01:56:01,399 --> 01:56:06,329
pay for plane tickets.

812
01:56:06,329 --> 01:56:08,329
And he said this. Kim Dang

813
01:56:08,329 --> 01:56:10,329
take a look at Kim Dang right there

814
01:56:10,329 --> 01:56:18,710
talking about it. Let's do it.

815
01:56:18,710 --> 01:56:21,460
I'll call these motherfuckers

816
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:23,460
no they're not motherfuckers. They're really great people.

817
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:25,460
I will call MGM tomorrow.

818
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:28,149
Yeah. Let's

819
01:56:28,149 --> 01:56:30,149
do it. Fuck it. Let's do it.

820
01:56:30,149 --> 01:56:34,810
Let's do it. Quote me.

821
01:56:34,810 --> 01:56:37,819
Let's do it. Let's do

822
01:56:37,819 --> 01:56:39,819
JermaCon at the level up lounge if it's possible.

823
01:56:39,819 --> 01:56:49,340
Let's do it.

824
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:51,340
I'm not really that

825
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:53,340
tipsy at all.

826
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:56,789
I am but not really. I

827
01:56:56,789 --> 01:56:58,789
swear to God this is something me and Kim were talking about

828
01:56:58,789 --> 01:57:00,789
like last week. I swear to God this is for real.

829
01:57:00,789 --> 01:57:05,909
I was

830
01:57:05,909 --> 01:57:07,909
stone cold sober

831
01:57:07,909 --> 01:57:09,909
when Kim and I were talking about this.

832
01:57:09,909 --> 01:57:12,149
People saying flush?

833
01:57:12,149 --> 01:57:14,520
That's the VR helmet. That's

834
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:16,520
not me. That's being in VR

835
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:20,300
for five hours. Yeah let's fucking

836
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:22,789
do it. Fuck it. I'm gonna

837
01:57:22,789 --> 01:57:24,789
call them tomorrow. I swear to God.

838
01:57:24,789 --> 01:57:32,789
What's the food situation? I don't know. We'll get

839
01:57:32,789 --> 01:57:34,789
like fucking McDonald's delivered. Who cares?

840
01:57:34,789 --> 01:57:40,359
How much water do I waste?

841
01:57:40,359 --> 01:57:42,359
What the hell is that kind of? What?

842
01:57:42,359 --> 01:57:46,899
How much water do I waste?

843
01:57:46,899 --> 01:57:48,899
I don't waste water.

844
01:57:48,899 --> 01:57:51,399
Confirm. Did I talk

845
01:57:51,399 --> 01:57:53,899
about this last week? Did I talk

846
01:57:53,899 --> 01:57:56,329
about that last week? Did I

847
01:57:56,329 --> 01:57:58,329
talk about that last week? We went for

848
01:57:58,329 --> 01:58:00,329
my birthday and he did talk

849
01:58:00,329 --> 01:58:02,329
about this. He did.

850
01:58:02,329 --> 01:58:04,329
I have like pictures of the level

851
01:58:04,329 --> 01:58:06,329
lounge and I made sure to take pictures and stuff.

852
01:58:06,329 --> 01:58:08,329
Excuse me. Look at the space. We're gonna

853
01:58:08,329 --> 01:58:10,329

Hi. We're gonna witness

856
01:58:14,329 --> 01:58:16,329
corroboration. I'm sorry I scared

857
01:58:16,329 --> 01:58:18,329
you earlier. Oh my God. My knees

858
01:58:18,329 --> 01:58:20,329
started to hurt so I actually had to leave.

859
01:58:20,329 --> 01:58:22,329
Like I was like I need to get out of here.

860
01:58:22,329 --> 01:58:24,569
I need to get out of here.

861
01:58:24,569 --> 01:58:26,569
I was like I gotta get. I was trying to leave

862
01:58:26,569 --> 01:58:28,569
like well I was just gonna leave but then

863
01:58:28,569 --> 01:58:30,569
I started laughing too hard so I was

864
01:58:30,569 --> 01:58:32,569
like oh I'm just gonna scare him.

865
01:58:32,569 --> 01:58:34,569
It was bad. You just get the shit out of me.

866
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:39,640
But yeah see there we go.

867
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:41,640
Story corroboration. Yeah we went to the MGM

868
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:43,640
for my birthday and a couple other things

869
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:45,640
and we had a lot of fun there so we think

870
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:47,640
that people would have really

871
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:49,640
a lot of fun like meeting

872
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:51,640
us and drinking

873
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:53,640
and the bar was really like the bar was

874
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:55,640
really nice. The bowling alley was

875
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:57,640
really nice.

876
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:59,640
They had like a virtual VR set like

877
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:01,640
you go into the room and it's like all VR.

878
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:03,640
Karaoke too.

879
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:05,640
They had a giant Jenga

880
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:07,640
table. They had ski ball

881
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:09,640
pool. If anybody

882
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:11,640
likes to play pool they have that

883
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:13,640
too and what else. They had like a

884
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:15,640
like really hyped this up. It's like not

01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:17,640

Oh and they have a bunch of painted

893
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:35,350
cats on there. Painted cats!

894
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:37,350
Are you kidding me?

895
01:59:37,350 --> 01:59:39,350
No yeah they do. I have a picture right here.

896
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:44,340
Painted cats. No it's a cool

897
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:46,710

898
01:59:46,710 --> 01:59:49,079
They're the painted cats. Hey that's

01:59:49,079 --> 01:59:51,899
what it looks like. We're like talking

900
01:59:51,899 --> 01:59:55,350
up this place so much.

901
01:59:55,350 --> 01:59:58,170
But uh you don't waste

902
01:59:58,170 --> 02:00:00,729
water. Everybody knows that

903
02:00:00,729 --> 02:00:02,729
they're just talking shit. You use a lot of plastic

904
02:00:02,729 --> 02:00:08,680
though. Gotcha.

905
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:11,939
I use a lot of

906
02:00:11,939 --> 02:00:13,939
plastic? What the fuck does that mean?

907
02:00:13,939 --> 02:00:16,180
Plastic? Like single use

908
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:18,180
plastic? I put it in the recycling unit.

909
02:00:18,180 --> 02:00:22,539
Uh oh. I'm getting compromised.

910
02:00:22,539 --> 02:00:27,590
I

911
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:29,590
put plastic in the recycling

912
02:00:29,590 --> 02:00:32,220
receptacle. I do.

913
02:00:32,220 --> 02:00:34,579
Come on. Talk into the camera.

914
02:00:34,579 --> 02:00:39,060
Tell them. He does

915
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:44,819
95% of the time.

916
02:00:44,819 --> 02:00:46,819
100%

917
02:00:46,819 --> 02:00:48,819
Alright. I love you.

918
02:00:48,819 --> 02:00:56,170
I'll see you when you're done. Bye guys!

919
02:00:56,170 --> 02:01:09,220
I recycle. I do.

920
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:11,460
I care about the environment.

921
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:13,460
I recycle. We got recycling here in

922
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:15,460
Vegas. I put everything. I don't know

923
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:18,470
what that was even about.

924
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:20,470
Recycle 95%.

925
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:22,470
You can't recycle everything.

926
02:01:22,470 --> 02:01:24,470
Some recycling cannot be recycled.

927
02:01:24,470 --> 02:01:26,470
If you've got bubble wrap

928
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:35,180
it's gotta be...

929
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:37,180
I recycle. I do.

930
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:48,569
Who's my favorite streamer?

931
02:01:48,569 --> 02:01:55,590
Oh. Are you talking about

932
02:01:55,590 --> 02:01:57,590
talent? Are you talking about who I think is the funniest?

933
02:01:57,590 --> 02:02:00,470
Or what's interesting?

934
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:04,420
What do you think? Who?

935
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:06,420
Vinny. Joel.

936
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:09,430
They're always doing something fun.

937
02:02:09,430 --> 02:02:11,430
Always doing something different.

938
02:02:11,430 --> 02:02:13,430
Vinesauce. The whole Vinesauce team

939
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:15,430
always doing something fucking different.

940
02:02:15,430 --> 02:02:17,430
They're always trying to make something fucking fun.

941
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:19,430
Follow them if you don't know who they are.

942
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:21,430
Joel, Varg, Skeletor.

943
02:02:21,430 --> 02:02:23,430
Skelethor and Vinesauce obviously.

944
02:02:23,430 --> 02:02:25,430
Criken

945
02:02:25,430 --> 02:02:28,229
is always doing something fun.

946
02:02:28,229 --> 02:02:30,229
Italics. Roommate.

947
02:02:30,229 --> 02:02:32,729
Like, roommate

948
02:02:32,729 --> 02:02:34,729
Literally is right here. Probably fucking sleeping.

949
02:02:41,449 --> 02:02:47,340
Who else? Wake him up? Fine.

950
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:53,979
He probably heard that.

951
02:02:53,979 --> 02:02:56,149
He's probably like, what the fuck are you doing?

952
02:02:56,149 --> 02:02:59,930
Who else?

953
02:02:59,930 --> 02:03:03,130
Who else is a streamer?

954
02:03:03,130 --> 02:03:05,130
Fun streams?

955
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:09,609
I don't watch everybody.

956
02:03:09,609 --> 02:03:13,510
He just watches

957
02:03:13,510 --> 02:03:15,510
his own VOD start to finish.

958
02:03:15,510 --> 02:03:17,510
Fuck off. Don't watch Italics.

959
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:19,510
He's fucking not even fun.

960
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:23,539
He's not even funny.

961
02:03:23,539 --> 02:03:28,920
Honestly, Kiwo is great.

962
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:31,670
She does a lot of RP.

963
02:03:31,670 --> 02:03:33,670
She does a lot of fucking character work.

964
02:03:33,670 --> 02:03:35,850
She does a lot of editing. She's fucking hilarious.

965
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:37,850
Hysterical.

966
02:03:37,850 --> 02:03:40,149
Go follow Kiwo. For real.

967
02:03:40,149 --> 02:03:42,149
XQC is funny.

968
02:03:42,149 --> 02:03:44,149
He's really just kind of all over the place out there.

969
02:03:44,149 --> 02:03:46,149
He's funny. He's fun to kind of see.

970
02:03:46,149 --> 02:03:49,210
Who else is

971
02:03:49,210 --> 02:03:51,210
I think funny. Interesting.

972
02:03:51,210 --> 02:03:59,079
Dance gaming.

973
02:03:59,079 --> 02:04:01,079
Just OG. Dance gaming is fun to watch.

974
02:04:01,079 --> 02:04:04,340
He's talking about his

975
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:15,930
investments.

976
02:04:15,930 --> 02:04:17,930
You got me. You fucking got me.

977
02:04:17,930 --> 02:04:19,930
I'll take it. I will. I will take that.

978
02:04:19,930 --> 02:04:21,930
You did catch me

979
02:04:21,930 --> 02:04:26,149
in the middle of my bullshit.

980
02:04:26,149 --> 02:04:28,149
Star. Star. I mean

981
02:04:28,149 --> 02:04:30,520
what can you say about Star?

982
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:32,520
One of the funniest, most talented fucking people on YouTube.

983
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:36,039
Still going on Twitch.

984
02:04:36,039 --> 02:04:38,039
Still funny. Still interesting.

985
02:04:38,039 --> 02:04:40,039
Give him a follow.

986
02:04:40,039 --> 02:04:42,039
He's fucking OG. For real.

987
02:04:42,039 --> 02:04:45,239
Who else?

988
02:04:45,239 --> 02:04:52,149
Uberhacks on Nova.

989
02:04:52,149 --> 02:04:56,380
Nova has been around for a long time too.

990
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:58,380
Moved to Twitch.

991
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:01,380
Still fun. Still interesting.

992
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:03,380
Critical. Critical is killing it on Twitch right now too.

993
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:05,380
There's too many people.

994
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:07,380
You understand? There's too many people.

995
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:09,380
There's so many fun. Look. Okay.

996
02:05:09,380 --> 02:05:11,380
Germa985. This channel.

997
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:13,380
Sucks.

998
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:15,380
Don't leave now. Don't fucking watch.

999
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:17,819
No I'm kidding. Stay.

1000
02:05:17,819 --> 02:05:20,949
But there are so many fun channels

1001
02:05:20,949 --> 02:05:22,949
that are always trying to do new things.

1002
02:05:22,949 --> 02:05:25,189
Trying to keep going.

1003
02:05:25,189 --> 02:05:28,779
Excel. But don't leave.

1004
02:05:28,779 --> 02:05:32,680
Because I need you.

1005
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:35,369
I need you.

1006
02:05:35,369 --> 02:05:37,369
At the table I'm going to spend like 15 grand.

1007
02:05:37,369 --> 02:05:39,609
I'm going to spend 15 grand.

1008
02:05:39,609 --> 02:05:44,460
How much is it to rent out

1009
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:46,460
a fucking level up lounge? Let's find out.

1010
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:48,630
Level up lounge

1011
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:51,699
price.

1012
02:05:51,699 --> 02:05:57,699
That doesn't do anything.

1013
02:05:57,699 --> 02:06:01,289
Depends on the year. Yeah it does.

1014
02:06:01,289 --> 02:06:04,810
Grillmaster?

1015
02:06:04,810 --> 02:06:07,880
I hope Grillmaster

1016
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:09,880
fucking throws himself off

1017
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:13,720
of a fucking plan of existence.

1018
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:16,539
He has talked so much

1019
02:06:16,539 --> 02:06:21,079
and his fans are unbearable.

1020
02:06:21,079 --> 02:06:23,079
Grillmaster x BBQ.

1021
02:06:23,079 --> 02:06:25,899
And his fans are relentless.

1022
02:06:25,899 --> 02:06:27,899
I'm just trying to stream

1023
02:06:27,899 --> 02:06:29,899
myself hanging out in IRL.

1024
02:06:29,899 --> 02:06:31,899
And they come in here and they fucking

1025
02:06:31,899 --> 02:06:38,619
throw themselves into the camera.

1026
02:06:38,619 --> 02:06:40,619
What? Gonna have to ban you?

1027
02:06:40,619 --> 02:06:42,619
Gonna have to ban you for

1028
02:06:42,619 --> 02:06:45,500
threatening other streamers?

1029
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:47,500
Grillmaster doesn't even fucking stream.

1030
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:50,890
Old joke. No.

1031
02:06:50,890 --> 02:06:52,890
This guy sucks.

1032
02:06:52,890 --> 02:07:03,500
Fuck this guy.

1033
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:07,319
Who is he? Don't worry about it.

1034
02:07:07,319 --> 02:07:09,319
I'm not going to answer that question.

1035
02:07:09,319 --> 02:07:23,770
Ban?

1036
02:07:23,770 --> 02:07:25,770
I bet Grillmaster would be saving city goals.

1037
02:07:25,770 --> 02:07:28,140
Yeah this channel sucks.

1038
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:30,140
Who cares? He doesn't even have a stock. I do.

1039
02:07:30,140 --> 02:07:35,130
I have a stock.

1040
02:07:35,130 --> 02:07:38,970
Does he have a stock?

1041
02:07:38,970 --> 02:07:42,550
No I don't think so.

1042
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:47,479
I do. What is it at right now?

1043
02:07:47,479 --> 02:07:53,880
Not even in trending anymore.

1044
02:07:53,880 --> 02:08:10,520
What the fuck have you guys done? He sold out.

1045
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:12,520
This is fake bullshit.

1046
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:19,300
It's not even real. Maybe I should

1047
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:21,800
stream better? I try.

1048
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:25,640
Do I have any cringey old art?

1049
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:29,289
How about some cringey new art?

1050
02:08:29,289 --> 02:08:31,289
How does that sound? Let's go for it.

1051
02:08:31,289 --> 02:08:35,829
No I don't.

1052
02:08:35,829 --> 02:11:07,319
How? I was quiet for a long time.

1053
02:11:07,319 --> 02:11:26,380
It's not bad. Alright that's it.

1054
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:28,380
What else? What else you got?

1055
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:34,760
Vinny said he loves you?

1056
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:43,579
Hey thanks Vinny. You're a pretty good guy.

1057
02:11:43,579 --> 02:11:45,579
Explain becoming a tree. Alright alright alright.

1058
02:11:45,579 --> 02:11:51,529
This is important.

1059
02:11:51,529 --> 02:11:53,529
Everybody that was going to leave

1060
02:11:53,529 --> 02:11:55,529
has already left.

1061
02:11:55,529 --> 02:11:57,529
We had like forty four hundred people here.

1062
02:11:57,529 --> 02:12:00,279
Like two hours ago.

1063
02:12:00,279 --> 02:12:02,279
They moved on. They probably watched

1064
02:12:02,279 --> 02:12:04,279
that's fine. But the twenty eight hundred

1065
02:12:04,279 --> 02:12:13,500
people that are still here.

1066
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:17,529
What is going on with trees?

1067
02:12:17,529 --> 02:12:20,859
You cut their limbs off. They come back.

1068
02:12:20,859 --> 02:12:24,699
How have we not

1069
02:12:24,699 --> 02:12:27,060
figured out as humans

1070
02:12:27,060 --> 02:12:29,430
how to genetically

1071
02:12:29,430 --> 02:12:31,930
tap into that

1072
02:12:31,930 --> 02:12:35,319
complete regrowth?

1073
02:12:35,319 --> 02:12:37,560
Seriously. Trees they

1074
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:39,560
fucking grow back. They last

1075
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:41,560
thousands of years some trees.

1076
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:46,229
Imagine in a hundred years

1077
02:12:46,229 --> 02:12:48,229
if they can tap into

1078
02:12:48,229 --> 02:12:56,100
the DNA of trees.

1079
02:12:56,100 --> 02:13:12,619
I'm getting made photo. It was

1080
02:13:12,619 --> 02:13:14,619
a thought experiment. Never mind.

1081
02:13:14,619 --> 02:13:20,630
No no no no no. Listen listen.

1082
02:13:20,630 --> 02:13:25,500
Besides humans.

1083
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:31,640
Right? Did I eat any

1084
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:35,029
edibles? No. No.

1085
02:13:35,029 --> 02:13:37,029
Not tonight. Not any night.

1086
02:13:37,029 --> 02:13:41,060
Oh they got a picture of the black hole.

1087
02:13:41,060 --> 02:13:43,750
That's right. They got a full on picture

1088
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:46,630
of the black hole. Let's take a look at it.

1089
02:13:46,630 --> 02:14:00,439
Black hole. There it is.

1090
02:14:00,439 --> 02:14:17,829
It's not boring. It's a good donut. Let's see it.

1091
02:14:17,829 --> 02:14:23,399
So this is a picture of a black hole.

1092
02:14:23,399 --> 02:14:29,930
I mean it kind of looks like what happens when you go

1093
02:14:29,930 --> 02:14:31,930
underwater and open your eyes and look

1094
02:14:31,930 --> 02:14:35,260
at the light. That shit's coming for you.

1095
02:14:35,260 --> 02:14:37,260
And it's going to wipe out everybody.

1096
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:42,760
That's the last thing you see before you die.

1097
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:49,979
Yep. Like a blurry

1098
02:14:49,979 --> 02:15:01,500
like the ring three image.

1099
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:05,210
Can I what?

1100
02:15:05,210 --> 02:15:07,960
What the fuck did you just say? Holy shit.

1101
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:12,630
Why worry about black holes

1102
02:15:12,630 --> 02:15:14,630
when your stream is this derailed?

1103
02:15:14,630 --> 02:15:16,869
I made that up. Somebody didn't write that.

1104
02:15:16,869 --> 02:15:18,869
I said that pretending to be a chat member.

1105
02:15:18,869 --> 02:15:35,640
How long has this stream been

1106
02:15:35,640 --> 02:15:48,760
six and a half hours? Watch

1107
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:51,899
an old video? Ah.

1108
02:15:51,899 --> 02:15:59,289
No. Not tonight.

1109
02:15:59,289 --> 02:16:09,590
Not tonight. Do a backflip. Sure.

1110
02:16:09,590 --> 02:16:32,170
Fucking easy.

1111
02:16:32,170 --> 02:16:39,020
Fucking easiest thing I've done all day.

1112
02:16:39,020 --> 02:16:51,620
Any other questions or requests? Do a

1113
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:53,620
cartwheel? Fucking easiest thing

1114
02:16:53,620 --> 02:17:02,840
I've done all day. I'll do two.

1115
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:05,590
You want two? Fine. I'll do two.

1116
02:17:05,590 --> 02:17:16,969
What? I'm going to kick

1117
02:17:16,969 --> 02:17:18,969
I'm going to kick that and I don't want to kick it.

1118
02:17:18,969 --> 02:17:35,799
Get this off! I'm just kidding.

1119
02:17:35,799 --> 02:17:51,159
I'm so self conscious about this

1120
02:17:51,159 --> 02:17:53,530
hair. It's so bad.

1121
02:17:53,530 --> 02:18:01,139
Will I ever go to Australia?

1122
02:18:01,139 --> 02:18:05,030
No. Probably not. Look at the link.

1123
02:18:05,030 --> 02:18:11,610
What link? I don't see a link.

1124
02:18:11,610 --> 02:18:49,479
I see. Where is it?

1125
02:18:49,479 --> 02:19:05,219
I just saved it. There it is.

1126
02:19:07,219 --> 02:19:12,340
Am I looking forward to Game of Thrones?

1127
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:15,139
Yeah. I don't know.

1128
02:19:15,139 --> 02:19:20,069
Maybe. A little.

1129
02:19:20,069 --> 02:19:29,100
Wider? I can't look at that shit for more than

1130
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:36,569
five seconds. Alright.

1131
02:19:36,569 --> 02:19:41,299
I think that's it. I've embarrassed myself

1132
02:19:41,299 --> 02:19:43,299
for a night at least.

1133
02:19:43,299 --> 02:19:49,819
Mine show was a lot of fun.

1134
02:19:49,819 --> 02:19:51,819
It just technically had some problems.

1135
02:19:51,819 --> 02:20:05,049
Thanks for the stream. Thanks for watching.

1136
02:20:05,049 --> 02:20:08,889
There's a lot of people fucking here. Thanks for

1137
02:20:08,889 --> 02:20:12,920
giving me your time. As much as

1138
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:16,500
I think maybe. Thank you.

1139
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:24,569
I put raw garlic in my head?

1140
02:20:24,569 --> 02:20:26,870
What? I don't know what you said.

1141
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:30,389
No for real. You guys

1142
02:20:30,389 --> 02:20:33,399
there were a lot of people here. I hope you had fun.

1143
02:20:33,399 --> 02:20:40,489
Thank you. We will do the

1144
02:20:40,489 --> 02:20:42,489
bits. I'm

1145
02:20:42,489 --> 02:20:46,200
probably. I said I was going to

1146
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:48,819
do three days in a row. I might be

1147
02:20:48,819 --> 02:20:51,260
a liar. Am I a fucking liar?

1148
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:53,260
I don't want to be a liar.

1149
02:20:53,260 --> 02:20:57,159
Now we're not done. We're not done. We're still going.

1150
02:20:57,159 --> 02:21:04,899
What do we got?

1151
02:21:04,899 --> 02:21:10,149
Are there any other games? It's late

1152
02:21:10,149 --> 02:21:13,610
but who cares? Fuck it.

1153
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:17,959
What is it? VTOL?

1154
02:21:17,959 --> 02:21:19,959
VTOL VR.

1155
02:21:19,959 --> 02:21:24,040
Let me look that up. VTOL

1156
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:26,729
VR. What is this?

1157
02:21:26,729 --> 02:21:29,290
VTOL VR.

1158
02:21:29,290 --> 02:21:33,190
Combat flight sim game.

1159
02:21:33,190 --> 02:21:35,500
You trying to make me throw up?

1160
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:44,780
V. Alright.

1161
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:47,139
I'll buy it. Fuck it. I'll buy it

1162
02:21:47,139 --> 02:21:49,620
right now. Let's go.

1163
02:21:49,620 --> 02:21:59,989
VTOL VR. Fuck it.

1164
02:21:59,989 --> 02:22:09,530
Let's go. Don't push yourself. We all love

1165
02:22:09,530 --> 02:22:11,530
your health is number one. No. I mean I had

1166
02:22:11,530 --> 02:22:14,469
three days off. You guys know this

1167
02:22:14,469 --> 02:22:17,159
right? I told you guys this

1168
02:22:17,159 --> 02:22:19,159
a long time ago. And by long. I mean like three

1169
02:22:19,159 --> 02:22:21,909
days ago. I take a

1170
02:22:21,909 --> 02:22:23,909
lot of time off to like

1171
02:22:23,909 --> 02:22:27,030
be ready. So.

1172
02:22:27,030 --> 02:22:30,360
No I'm good. I feel great.

1173
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:32,659
What did Kim say? What did Kim

1174
02:22:32,659 --> 02:22:35,100
say? What is she saying now?

1175
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:39,129
I didn't even see it. I didn't

1176
02:22:39,129 --> 02:22:44,700
see it. VTOL

1177
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:46,700
VR. VR Josh.

1178
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:50,149
No I owe it to you guys for

1179
02:22:50,149 --> 02:22:52,149
a fucking longer stream. I do. I really

1180
02:22:52,149 --> 02:22:54,149
do. I swear to god. I just typed

1181
02:22:54,149 --> 02:22:56,149
in VR Josh into Steam. That's not

1182
02:22:56,149 --> 02:23:10,149
that's not it.

1183
02:23:10,149 --> 02:23:12,149
No I do because you guys

1184
02:23:12,149 --> 02:23:14,459
you guys are fucking great. Don't worry.

1185
02:23:14,459 --> 02:23:17,719
He doesn't know. She's not in there anymore.

1186
02:23:17,719 --> 02:23:20,340
Okay. Kim's not

1187
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:26,620
in the closet anymore. Look

1188
02:23:26,620 --> 02:24:27,290
I just lived like 30

1189
02:24:27,290 --> 02:24:31,129
years. I went in there and like

1190
02:24:31,129 --> 02:24:33,500
I jumped into a fucking another person's

1191
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:40,729
body. I just barely fucking

1192
02:24:40,729 --> 02:24:42,729
came out. It was like 30 fucking years of a person.

1193
02:24:42,729 --> 02:24:46,120
Acting fucking one on

1194
02:24:46,120 --> 02:24:48,420
one. Give me a break. I could out

1195
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:50,420
act Brad Pitt. Fucking give me a scene with

1196
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:57,020
him. Give me any scene. It

1197
02:24:57,020 --> 02:24:59,020
doesn't matter what it is. Did you see how good that was?

1198
02:24:59,020 --> 02:25:01,260
My god it was fucking fantastic.

1199
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:05,219
Setup tour?

1200
02:25:05,219 --> 02:25:08,100
Yeah sure. There's

1201
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:10,100
a computer. And there's the other

1202
02:25:10,100 --> 02:25:12,100
computer. And there's my fucking desk.

1203
02:25:12,100 --> 02:25:14,409
As you see there is a

1204
02:25:14,409 --> 02:25:18,309
wine. And there's

1205
02:25:18,309 --> 02:25:32,069
me. Nothing else here.

1206
02:25:32,069 --> 02:25:38,139
Is this game any fun? Can we

1207
02:25:38,139 --> 02:25:40,139
see a bathroom? Yeah sure.

1208
02:25:40,139 --> 02:25:42,139
It doesn't go that far.

1209
02:25:42,139 --> 02:25:51,290
Is this installing or what?

1210
02:25:51,290 --> 02:25:59,479
Install the game? What the fuck are you doing?

1211
02:25:59,479 --> 02:26:05,420
I just bought it.

1212
02:26:05,420 --> 02:26:07,420
I don't know why this is not happening.

1213
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:10,549
I don't get it. Show tax returns?

1214
02:26:10,549 --> 02:26:12,549
Alright. So show my asshole. Okay.

1215
02:26:12,549 --> 02:26:17,739
Here we go. Where is that game?

1216
02:26:17,739 --> 02:26:25,030
I just bought it. VTOL?

1217
02:26:25,030 --> 02:26:27,030
I just fucking bought it.

1218
02:26:27,030 --> 02:26:31,770
Where the hell is it? In

1219
02:26:31,770 --> 02:26:33,770
add to cart. What did I just buy?

1220
02:26:33,770 --> 02:26:36,969
What did I seriously just buy?

1221
02:26:36,969 --> 02:26:45,909
What? I don't understand

1222
02:26:45,909 --> 02:26:49,110
what I just purchased. I just

1223
02:26:49,110 --> 02:26:51,110
bought it. I just bought it.

1224
02:26:51,110 --> 02:26:53,670
Purchase. Your account already

1225
02:26:53,670 --> 02:27:02,680
owns the game. There it is.

1226
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:07,479
Let's go. Oh my god he

1227
02:27:07,479 --> 02:27:48,489
leaked. Relax.

1228
02:27:48,489 --> 02:28:18,250
BRB? This was

1229
02:28:18,250 --> 02:28:20,250
30 bucks. I hope you fucking understand.

1230
02:28:20,250 --> 02:28:22,870
The things I do for

1231
02:28:22,870 --> 02:28:30,420
love. Look at me.

1232
02:28:30,420 --> 02:28:39,510
Look at me. VTOL.

1233
02:28:39,510 --> 02:28:47,940
Alright. Did we get Chinese food?

1234
02:28:47,940 --> 02:28:50,950
Did we get Chinese

1235
02:28:50,950 --> 02:28:53,770
food like an hour and a half ago? What happened?

1236
02:28:53,770 --> 02:28:57,459
Where is it? I

1237
02:28:57,459 --> 02:29:03,219
could go for some crab rangooz right now. Why am I

1238
02:29:03,219 --> 02:29:09,110
like 15 feet tall? Should

1239
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:13,459
I be this big? I don't

1240
02:29:13,459 --> 02:29:20,059
understand. Why am I like 15

1241
02:29:20,059 --> 02:29:25,500
feet tall?

1242
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:44,760
What's happening?

1243
02:29:44,760 --> 02:29:48,600
VR Josh told me to buy this.

1244
02:29:48,600 --> 02:29:53,190
All of them accountable. Okay?

1245
02:29:53,190 --> 02:29:58,489
Where's the audio? No chat.

1246
02:29:58,489 --> 02:30:02,760
Don't scare me. What is this?

1247
02:30:02,760 --> 02:30:04,940
The Chinese food I ordered?

1248
02:30:04,940 --> 02:30:07,940
I didn't order the Chinese food.

1249
02:30:07,940 --> 02:30:09,940
You have spare ribs downstairs and

1250
02:30:09,940 --> 02:30:11,940
you have pad thai downstairs too.

1251
02:30:11,940 --> 02:30:18,020
You just want one?

1252
02:30:18,020 --> 02:30:21,719
I just heard. A little birdie

1253
02:30:21,719 --> 02:30:26,389
told me.

1254
02:30:26,389 --> 02:30:28,629
Mmm. Mmm.

1255
02:30:28,629 --> 02:30:30,629
Mwah. Mwah. Mwah.

1256
02:30:30,629 --> 02:30:32,629
Fantastic. Okay.

1257
02:30:32,629 --> 02:30:37,819
Well, I'm going to leave these notes for free.

1258
02:30:37,819 --> 02:30:51,510
Can you guys hear this?

1259
02:30:51,510 --> 02:31:08,659
Why did you tell me to buy

1260
02:31:08,659 --> 02:31:11,420
this? Help make preparations

1261
02:31:11,420 --> 02:31:14,870
depending on the dress for personnel?

1262
02:31:14,870 --> 02:31:17,750
I don't... Negotiations for

1263
02:31:17,750 --> 02:31:19,750
priests? No! This is not going to come through the ro...

1264
02:31:19,750 --> 02:31:35,989
Why did I buy this?

1265
02:31:35,989 --> 02:31:42,969
I don't know why I bought this. That crab

1266
02:31:42,969 --> 02:31:44,969
rangooz was fucking fantastic.

1267
02:31:44,969 --> 02:31:47,909
Okay. I'm ready.

1268
02:31:47,909 --> 02:31:53,100
So what do I do? Fly.

1269
02:31:53,100 --> 02:31:58,459
Okay. Fly.

1270
02:31:58,459 --> 02:32:24,760
Align your seat with the...

1271
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:42,040
Align your seat with the virtual

1272
02:32:42,040 --> 02:32:44,979
grip helmet when ready. I'm ready.

1273
02:32:44,979 --> 02:32:46,979
Okay. Let's go. I'm ready.

1274
02:32:46,979 --> 02:32:54,920
Where's the audio? What the fuck?

1275
02:32:54,920 --> 02:33:07,530
I can't... This is... I can't

1276
02:33:07,530 --> 02:33:23,909
hear this. Why is it come...

1277
02:33:23,909 --> 02:33:40,020
What? Nav off?

1278
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:43,670
Hover mode? HD?

1279
02:33:43,670 --> 02:33:47,000
What the fuck is this?

1280
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:56,010
Grip? How do I get out of here?

1281
02:33:56,010 --> 02:33:59,340
Landing?

1282
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:02,090
This is too much!

1283
02:34:02,090 --> 02:34:04,090
Grip? Jenison?

1284
02:34:04,090 --> 02:34:14,579
This is $30!

1285
02:34:14,579 --> 02:34:20,149
Just toggle flight assist?

1286
02:34:20,149 --> 02:34:27,899
What do I do with this?

1287
02:34:27,899 --> 02:34:39,780
How do I drive?

1288
02:34:39,780 --> 02:34:43,350
All? None?

1289
02:34:43,350 --> 02:34:45,659
Go? Navigation? Nav?

1290
02:34:45,659 --> 02:34:47,659
No. That's night vision.

1291
02:34:47,659 --> 02:34:50,149
How do I get that off? Get off!

1292
02:34:50,149 --> 02:34:52,149
I don't want night vision.

1293
02:34:52,149 --> 02:34:54,149
I don't know what this does. HUD?

1294
02:34:54,149 --> 02:35:04,459
Brightness?

1295
02:35:04,459 --> 02:35:07,780
Why did you tell me to buy this?

1296
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:09,780
I'm going to be fucking forever in goods. I'm out of here.

1297
02:35:09,780 --> 02:35:16,059
Eject?

1298
02:35:16,059 --> 02:35:29,110
Where is eject? Grip?

1299
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:33,340
How do I fly?

1300
02:35:33,340 --> 02:35:35,829
How do I turn it off?

1301
02:35:35,829 --> 02:35:38,069
Turn it off!

1302
02:35:38,069 --> 02:35:40,069
Turn off the...

1303
02:35:40,069 --> 02:35:43,590
What is this? Eject?

1304
02:35:43,590 --> 02:36:25,559
I'm gonna throw up. I don't know

1305
02:36:25,559 --> 02:36:41,559
what I bought that for.

1306
02:36:41,559 --> 02:36:45,270
Try tomorrow.

1307
02:36:45,270 --> 02:36:50,389
We'll see. I'm okay. I just wanted

1308
02:36:50,389 --> 02:36:52,389
to play when not

1309
02:36:52,389 --> 02:36:56,409
drunk. That was a

1310
02:36:56,409 --> 02:37:06,389
good walk going on there.

1311
02:37:06,389 --> 02:37:08,389
Well, thank you for watching everybody.

1312
02:37:08,389 --> 02:37:13,370
That's it. I'm gonna go eat some

1313
02:37:13,370 --> 02:37:15,370
crab rangoons. I did not think

1314
02:37:15,370 --> 02:37:17,989
this was going to be a seven hour stream.

1315
02:37:17,989 --> 02:37:22,090
What is going on here? I don't... whatever.

1316
02:37:22,090 --> 02:37:28,040
Thanks for watching. Thanks for thinking

1317
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:31,180
around. I'll see you guys

1318
02:37:31,180 --> 02:37:34,059
hopefully tomorrow.

1319
02:37:34,059 --> 02:37:36,059
Unless we sit here and have another glass of wine

1320
02:37:36,059 --> 02:37:38,059
and have a few conversations.

1321
02:37:38,059 --> 02:37:44,889
I'll probably be

1322
02:37:44,889 --> 02:37:47,319
live tomorrow. What the fuck was I doing?

1323
02:37:47,319 --> 02:37:55,190
In actuality,

1324
02:37:55,190 --> 02:37:57,190
I'll probably see you on fucking...

1325
02:37:57,190 --> 02:37:59,190
on Friday, probably.

1326
02:37:59,190 --> 02:38:02,780
What an idiot.

1327
02:38:02,780 --> 02:38:05,209
What a stupid motherfucker.

1328
02:38:05,209 --> 02:38:07,209
Like I was gonna do three VR days in a row

1329
02:38:07,209 --> 02:38:09,209
like four to five hours each. This is like a seven hour

1330
02:38:09,209 --> 02:38:11,209
drunk stream. What a dumb dickhead.

1331
02:38:11,209 --> 02:38:25,159
But, regardless,

1332
02:38:25,159 --> 02:38:27,459
I actually

1333
02:38:27,459 --> 02:38:29,459
had a lot of fun. Hope you did too.

1334
02:38:29,459 --> 02:38:31,959
If you didn't, I'm sorry.

1335
02:38:31,959 --> 02:38:33,959
I can do better. I'll try better. I'll try

1336
02:38:33,959 --> 02:38:36,649
harder. If you did,

1337
02:38:36,649 --> 02:38:38,649
I'm glad you did. If not, then I'm

1338
02:38:38,649 --> 02:38:43,319
trying. I'll see you soon.

1339
02:38:43,319 --> 02:38:45,319
I'm gonna go have some crab rangoons, but

1340
02:38:45,319 --> 02:38:50,440
let's do the bits.

1341
02:38:50,440 --> 02:38:52,440
Look, I look drunker than I am,

1342
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:54,440
okay? It looks like somebody fucking

1343
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:56,440
shook me up and threw me and hit me in the

1344
02:38:56,440 --> 02:38:58,440
face with a shovel.

1345
02:38:58,440 --> 02:39:01,000
That's because of the hair.

1346
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,299
Okay? Look, ready?

1347
02:39:03,299 --> 02:39:05,610
How do I look now? Probably pretty

1348
02:39:05,610 --> 02:39:09,049
good. But like,

1349
02:39:09,049 --> 02:39:11,049
it's the hair. The hair fucks me up. I'm deleted.

1350
02:39:11,049 --> 02:39:15,590
But thank

1351
02:39:15,590 --> 02:39:17,590
you so much for joining me. I'll see you soon.

1352
02:39:17,590 --> 02:39:19,829
I hope you liked it.

1353
02:39:19,829 --> 02:39:22,260
I did.

1354
02:39:22,260 --> 02:39:24,260
I had a great time.

1355
02:39:24,260 --> 02:39:32,379
But, let's do the bits.

1356
02:39:32,379 --> 02:39:34,379
See you guys in probably a day and a half.

1357
02:39:34,379 --> 02:39:37,700
Because

1358
02:39:37,700 --> 02:39:39,700
Jeremy's 34 and drinks

1359
02:39:39,700 --> 02:39:41,700
and has to sleep for a whole day.

1360
02:39:41,700 --> 02:39:43,700
Took three days off.

1361
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:45,700
God damn it. What an idiot.

1362
02:39:45,700 --> 02:39:47,700
What an asshole.

1363
02:39:47,700 --> 02:39:49,700
Thank you guys.

1364
02:39:49,700 --> 02:39:51,700
So, we had a

1365
02:39:51,700 --> 02:39:53,700
meaty-matey. Thanks for 10 bucks.

1366
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:57,030
Especially with wine. What a bad choice.

1367
02:39:57,030 --> 02:39:59,030
But it was fun. I had a great time.

1368
02:39:59,030 --> 02:40:01,030
I had a great fucking time. I really did.

1369
02:40:01,030 --> 02:40:04,229
What a blast. I really did.

1370
02:40:04,229 --> 02:40:07,299
Uh, meaty-matey

1371
02:40:07,299 --> 02:40:09,610
10 bucks. Thank you for

1372
02:40:09,610 --> 02:40:11,610
brightening all of our days with your streams

1373
02:40:11,610 --> 02:40:13,610
and being the only person I can watch on Twitch.

1374
02:40:13,610 --> 02:40:16,549
Uh, thank you.

1375
02:40:16,549 --> 02:40:20,889
That means a lot.

1376
02:40:20,889 --> 02:40:22,889
I hope you enjoy yourself here. I really do.

1377
02:40:22,889 --> 02:40:27,370
Regardless if I drink

1378
02:40:27,370 --> 02:40:29,370
wine or not, I hope you

1379
02:40:29,370 --> 02:40:31,370
have fun. Cause I had fun.

1380
02:40:31,370 --> 02:40:34,500
I hope that means you did too.

1381
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:36,500
Uh, Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the 250.

1382
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:38,739
Please grow a massive

1383
02:40:38,739 --> 02:40:40,739
Tormund beard. It would be a scarecrow. It would be

1384
02:40:40,739 --> 02:40:42,739
terrible. You wouldn't want to look at it.

1385
02:40:42,739 --> 02:40:45,500
It would be ugly.

1386
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:50,549
Uh, Smelly Boy, thanks for the 250.

1387
02:40:50,549 --> 02:40:52,549
Desk infested by Gamer God.

1388
02:40:52,549 --> 02:40:55,049
I don't know what that means,

1389
02:40:55,049 --> 02:40:57,860
but thank you. Bake me

1390
02:40:57,860 --> 02:40:59,860
home 250. Less than 20 days

1391
02:40:59,860 --> 02:41:01,860
till Avengers. Are we excited or what?

1392
02:41:01,860 --> 02:41:06,329
Yeah,

1393
02:41:06,329 --> 02:41:09,059
kind of. Kind of.

1394
02:41:09,059 --> 02:41:12,200
It would be a good movie. Hope it is.

1395
02:41:12,200 --> 02:41:14,200
What wine am I drinking? This is a Malbec.

1396
02:41:14,200 --> 02:41:16,629
Malbec is my favorite wine.

1397
02:41:16,629 --> 02:41:20,709
It is the best.

1398
02:41:20,709 --> 02:41:22,709
If you can get your hands on a Malbec,

1399
02:41:22,709 --> 02:41:25,209
please do. It's good shit.

1400
02:41:25,209 --> 02:41:29,049
Jerma lied about stream

1401
02:41:29,049 --> 02:41:31,049
legends. What kind of name

1402
02:41:31,049 --> 02:41:36,360
is that? That's not, I do that

1403
02:41:36,360 --> 02:41:38,659
every day. Every, of the stream.

1404
02:41:38,659 --> 02:41:40,659
What are you, what? What are you talking about?

1405
02:41:40,659 --> 02:41:46,809
I do that every stream.

1406
02:41:46,809 --> 02:41:50,520
You'll get it at the end.

1407
02:41:50,520 --> 02:41:54,360
I promise. Door Cube. Hey,

1408
02:41:54,360 --> 02:41:56,790
Door Cube, thanks for the 250 Door Cube.

1409
02:41:56,790 --> 02:41:58,790
You are screaming way too much. I did not

1410
02:41:58,790 --> 02:42:00,790
raise you like this. I did not raise you

1411
02:42:00,790 --> 02:42:02,790
like this. You scream too much.

1412
02:42:02,790 --> 02:42:08,360
I forget every

1413
02:42:08,360 --> 02:42:11,110
skit I made in that

1414
02:42:11,110 --> 02:42:14,440
game. I hope they were funny.

1415
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:16,739
Hahaha.

1416
02:42:16,739 --> 02:42:19,049
Uh, thank you

1417
02:42:19,049 --> 02:42:21,049
Kombino for the five dollars.

1418
02:42:21,049 --> 02:42:24,059
Hey Jerma, it's me Kombine. My

1419
02:42:24,059 --> 02:42:26,059
account was stolen by

1420
02:42:26,059 --> 02:42:28,059
someone from Malaysia.

1421
02:42:28,059 --> 02:42:30,059
Can you make characters have sex with each other

1422
02:42:30,059 --> 02:42:32,059
in this game? Do it. I give you money.

1423
02:42:32,059 --> 02:42:38,200
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Kombine.

1424
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:42,170
I don't think you can.

1425
02:42:42,170 --> 02:42:44,170
Maybe if you really put your

1426
02:42:44,170 --> 02:42:46,170
imagination into it. Maybe.

1427
02:42:46,170 --> 02:42:48,729
Ugh.

1428
02:42:48,729 --> 02:42:50,729
Hey Flugboy,

1429
02:42:50,729 --> 02:42:52,729
thanks for the 20 bucks, Flugboy.

1430
02:42:52,729 --> 02:42:55,850
20 bucks. Hey Jerma,

1431
02:42:55,850 --> 02:42:57,850
I thought I'd drop you a good amount of bids tonight. Hope you

1432
02:42:57,850 --> 02:42:59,850
are doing well and having a beautiful Duwang.

1433
02:42:59,850 --> 02:43:02,090
Duwang.

1434
02:43:02,090 --> 02:43:06,180
Also, really

1435
02:43:06,180 --> 02:43:08,180
I'm hoping Keem comes down

1436
02:43:08,180 --> 02:43:10,180
and smacks you after screaming.

1437
02:43:10,180 --> 02:43:12,860
She did. She scared the

1438
02:43:12,860 --> 02:43:16,700
fuck out of me. Ah, that's a Jojo

1439
02:43:16,700 --> 02:43:22,260
reference. Okay. Thank you

1440
02:43:22,260 --> 02:43:24,260
though. Thank you Frodeon Weapon for the 250.

1441
02:43:24,260 --> 02:43:26,260
No message, but thank you Frodeon.

1442
02:43:26,260 --> 02:43:28,500
Internet, Jorge, thanks for the 15

1443
02:43:28,500 --> 02:43:30,680
bucks. Nothing makes me laugh

1444
02:43:30,680 --> 02:43:32,680
harder and my day better than

1445
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:34,680
watching the stream and chat devolve into absolute

1446
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:36,680
madness. Much

1447
02:43:36,680 --> 02:43:40,139
love, Jerma. Much love to

1448
02:43:40,139 --> 02:43:46,340
you. I mean, you just watch the guy

1449
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:48,340
like drink wine and get like drunk

1450
02:43:48,340 --> 02:43:50,340
and play a

1451
02:43:50,340 --> 02:43:53,930
VR game. And I made

1452
02:43:53,930 --> 02:43:56,489
a fucking ton of money. Seriously.

1453
02:43:56,489 --> 02:43:59,180
Do you understand like how

1454
02:43:59,180 --> 02:44:01,180
much that fucking means to me?

1455
02:44:01,180 --> 02:44:07,579
I can't even tell you.

1456
02:44:07,579 --> 02:44:09,579
I really can't.

1457
02:44:09,579 --> 02:44:15,139
I wish there was another way

1458
02:44:15,139 --> 02:44:20,950
that I could tell you that.

1459
02:44:20,950 --> 02:44:24,149
Thank you for everything. And

1460
02:44:24,149 --> 02:44:28,059
as long as you're having a

1461
02:44:28,059 --> 02:44:30,809
good time, that's all I fucking

1462
02:44:30,809 --> 02:44:32,809
care about. That's the only fucking

1463
02:44:32,809 --> 02:44:36,389
thing I care about. Even if

1464
02:44:36,389 --> 02:44:38,389
I feel like I need to talk shit and make fun of

1465
02:44:38,389 --> 02:44:40,819
it. Of course, we're all gonna

1466
02:44:40,819 --> 02:44:43,129
prod at the stream sometimes.

1467
02:44:43,129 --> 02:44:46,440
Thank you.

1468
02:44:46,440 --> 02:44:48,440
You guys mean more than you think.

1469
02:44:48,440 --> 02:44:52,969
Seriously.

1470
02:44:52,969 --> 02:45:00,899
For real. Never ever in a million

1471
02:45:00,899 --> 02:45:02,899
years did I think that somebody would think it was fun.

1472
02:45:02,899 --> 02:45:04,899
To like watch me

1473
02:45:04,899 --> 02:45:06,899
drink wine and like make shitty

1474
02:45:06,899 --> 02:45:08,899
videos in mind chill.

1475
02:45:08,899 --> 02:45:12,299
I

1476
02:45:12,299 --> 02:45:14,299
am forever fucking grateful.

1477
02:45:14,299 --> 02:45:18,709
Thank you for everything.

1478
02:45:18,709 --> 02:45:24,090
Seriously.

1479
02:45:24,090 --> 02:45:26,090
You don't understand how much that

1480
02:45:26,090 --> 02:45:30,819
actually means. Not only

1481
02:45:30,819 --> 02:45:32,819
Jorge did you give me 15 bucks.

1482
02:45:32,819 --> 02:45:35,579
But that message.

1483
02:45:35,579 --> 02:45:40,309
I wish I could tell you more.

1484
02:45:40,309 --> 02:45:42,739
How much that actually

1485
02:45:42,739 --> 02:45:44,739
fucking really means. For real.

1486
02:45:44,739 --> 02:45:49,159
I wish I could. But thank you

1487
02:45:49,159 --> 02:45:52,489
so much.

1488
02:45:52,489 --> 02:45:56,840
VR Josh.

1489
02:45:56,840 --> 02:45:58,840
Six dollars from VR Josh. One of the

1490
02:45:58,840 --> 02:46:01,209
resident VIPs.

1491
02:46:01,209 --> 02:46:03,209
Sorry about the technical difficulties. You handled

1492
02:46:03,209 --> 02:46:05,209
it really well.

1493
02:46:05,209 --> 02:46:07,579
VR streaming can be extra rough

1494
02:46:07,579 --> 02:46:09,579
sometimes but I appreciate you trying to make it work.

1495
02:46:09,579 --> 02:46:12,579
Now I know that too. And like

1496
02:46:12,579 --> 02:46:14,579
look. Mind show

1497
02:46:14,579 --> 02:46:17,209
is amazing. It's a

1498
02:46:17,209 --> 02:46:19,209
great idea. The people behind it

1499
02:46:19,209 --> 02:46:21,209
they really give a fuck. You can tell.

1500
02:46:21,209 --> 02:46:23,700
So my frustrations

1501
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:25,700
with the game are not

1502
02:46:25,700 --> 02:46:29,100
necessarily

1503
02:46:29,100 --> 02:46:31,100
take it with a grain of salt. Because

1504
02:46:31,100 --> 02:46:33,100
I mean we had some issues with it but it was

1505
02:46:33,100 --> 02:46:35,100
still a lot of fun. It really was.

1506
02:46:35,100 --> 02:46:39,319
I don't mean my frustrations

1507
02:46:39,319 --> 02:46:41,319
to be taken out on the developers of the

1508
02:46:41,319 --> 02:46:43,620
game. Because I do think it's

1509
02:46:43,620 --> 02:46:47,719
really great. I hope they continue

1510
02:46:47,719 --> 02:46:49,719
to improve it. I hope it's continue

1511
02:46:49,719 --> 02:46:56,250
I mean it's a great concept.

1512
02:46:56,250 --> 02:46:58,250
But thank you Josh. VR

1513
02:46:58,250 --> 02:47:02,540
Josh. I loved

1514
02:47:02,540 --> 02:47:06,819
it. I had a lot of fun.

1515
02:47:06,819 --> 02:47:08,819
I still think. I would still recommend that

1516
02:47:08,819 --> 02:47:11,129
game. Just because of what they're trying

1517
02:47:11,129 --> 02:47:15,670
to do with the platform. It was good shit.

1518
02:47:15,670 --> 02:47:18,229
For real. Hey pizza

1519
02:47:18,229 --> 02:47:21,180
bot. Pizza bot.

1520
02:47:21,180 --> 02:47:23,180
Five dollars from pizza bot. This is a fever

1521
02:47:23,180 --> 02:47:25,989
dream. Yeah. That's

1522
02:47:25,989 --> 02:47:27,989
kind of how it works here sometimes.

1523
02:47:27,989 --> 02:47:30,809
Peaceful. Hey Lee. Thanks for the 250.

1524
02:47:30,809 --> 02:47:33,299
Hey Jeremy. Just want to say you're such a funny

1525
02:47:33,299 --> 02:47:35,299
man. Keep being yourself.

1526
02:47:35,299 --> 02:47:37,299
Going to Texas tomorrow.

1527
02:47:37,299 --> 02:47:39,299
So I'll miss a bunch of the streams but I hope you

1528
02:47:39,299 --> 02:47:41,299
enjoy the rest of your week.

1529
02:47:41,299 --> 02:47:44,739
Love you Jeremy. And chat.

1530
02:47:44,739 --> 02:47:47,180
I'm sure they appreciate that.

1531
02:47:47,180 --> 02:47:49,180
Thank you for the 250.

1532
02:47:49,180 --> 02:47:51,180
Thanks for the wonderful message.

1533
02:47:51,180 --> 02:47:55,020
Hey Jess. You got it. Thanks for

1534
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:57,020
the 250. This is how your fight

1535
02:47:57,020 --> 02:47:59,020
scene directing looked.

1536
02:47:59,020 --> 02:48:09,620
What is this?

1537
02:48:09,620 --> 02:48:11,620
This is the

1538
02:48:11,620 --> 02:48:13,620
Liam

1539
02:48:13,620 --> 02:48:15,620
Neeson jumps a fence.

1540
02:48:18,739 --> 02:48:21,110
I can't believe they actually kept this.

1541
02:48:21,110 --> 02:48:23,110
Why would you not

1542
02:48:23,110 --> 02:48:25,420
change that? That is so

1543
02:48:25,420 --> 02:48:27,420
absolutely disgusting

1544
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:29,420
in a filmmaking sense.

1545
02:48:29,420 --> 02:48:31,420
And I really, I mean that.

1546
02:48:31,420 --> 02:48:33,420
Holy shit. That was unbearable.

1547
02:48:33,420 --> 02:48:41,930
But thank you Jess. You got it for the 250.

1548
02:48:41,930 --> 02:48:44,170
Hey Pilot Guy. Thanks

1549
02:48:44,170 --> 02:48:46,170
for $15 Pilot Guy.

1550
02:48:46,170 --> 02:48:48,170
I'm fine. Seriously though.

1551
02:48:48,170 --> 02:48:50,170
I haven't laughed this hard in a while.

1552
02:48:50,170 --> 02:48:52,170
Thanks Jeremy. Thank you.

1553
02:48:52,170 --> 02:48:59,510
Glad you had a good time.

1554
02:48:59,510 --> 02:49:01,510
Thank you for the $15 and your wonderful

1555
02:49:01,510 --> 02:49:03,510
and amazing message.

1556
02:49:03,510 --> 02:49:06,459
Thank you. Mostly lost.

1557
02:49:06,459 --> 02:49:08,459
Thanks for the 250. Hey Geronimo. I'm going to

1558
02:49:08,459 --> 02:49:10,459
leave this Academy Award nominee by Kiwo

1559
02:49:10,459 --> 02:49:12,459
here. And it's

1560
02:49:12,459 --> 02:49:14,459
sequel which is even better.

1561
02:49:14,459 --> 02:49:16,459
Sorry, not sorry. Kiwo, deal

1562
02:49:16,459 --> 02:49:18,459
with it. What are you talking about?

1563
02:49:18,459 --> 02:49:21,530
Cherry chapstick.

1564
02:49:21,530 --> 02:49:26,709
What is this? Hold on.

1565
02:49:26,709 --> 02:49:39,510
This is a Kiwo video? I mean we gotta

1566
02:49:39,510 --> 02:49:42,840
watch the whole fucking thing.

1567
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:44,840
Things have been rough between us.

1568
02:49:44,840 --> 02:49:46,840
Jeremy wants you to come home. Jeremy wants you to do this.

1569
02:49:46,840 --> 02:49:48,840
I miss you. I know things have been rough.

1570
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:51,530
I miss you too. I still love you.

1571
02:49:51,530 --> 02:49:53,530
I love you too.

1572
02:49:53,530 --> 02:49:55,899
Awesome Texas.

1573
02:49:55,899 --> 02:50:16,629
Where's the audio?

1574
02:50:16,629 --> 02:50:20,729
What happened to the audio?

1575
02:50:20,729 --> 02:50:25,979
Kiwo, we gotta make it like a fucking

1576
02:50:25,979 --> 02:50:32,819
real video together.

1577
02:50:32,819 --> 02:50:35,190
I didn't do anything.

1578
02:50:35,190 --> 02:50:43,129
I just like shut off. Blossom.

1579
02:50:43,129 --> 02:50:45,129
I just played the video.

1580
02:50:45,129 --> 02:50:48,780
Kiwo went to bed 3 hours

1581
02:50:48,780 --> 02:50:50,780
ago. I don't blame her.

1582
02:50:50,780 --> 02:50:53,209
It's late. It's like 2am

1583
02:50:53,209 --> 02:50:55,209
Eastern. Like 6, 5,

1584
02:50:55,209 --> 02:51:00,260
6am EU.

1585
02:51:00,260 --> 02:51:02,260
The vibe may have, the vibe probably

1586
02:51:02,260 --> 02:51:04,260
fucked it up. But thank you Mostly Lost.

1587
02:51:04,260 --> 02:51:06,500
Kiwo and I will make

1588
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:08,870
content together I promise.

1589
02:51:08,870 --> 02:51:10,870
She's hilarious. She's talented.

1590
02:51:10,870 --> 02:51:13,610
Of course I'd want to

1591
02:51:13,610 --> 02:51:16,229
make content with somebody like that. For real.

1592
02:51:16,229 --> 02:51:18,229
Like it's gonna happen.

1593
02:51:18,229 --> 02:51:22,459
It's never happening.

1594
02:51:22,459 --> 02:51:26,100
Hey Mostly Lost, thanks again

1595
02:51:26,100 --> 02:51:28,409
for the 250.

1596
02:51:28,409 --> 02:51:30,409
We can probably piece together the ABC video

1597
02:51:30,409 --> 02:51:32,409
with the first person's perspectives

1598
02:51:32,409 --> 02:51:34,409
when you were filming it and the final

1599
02:51:34,409 --> 02:51:36,709
audio from the end.

1600
02:51:36,709 --> 02:51:38,709
I don't even know what you're talking about. I forgot it.

1601
02:51:38,709 --> 02:51:45,819
What an embarrassment.

1602
02:51:45,819 --> 02:51:47,819
Didn't I lose like 700 fucking

1603
02:51:47,819 --> 02:51:50,629
viewers during that segment?

1604
02:51:50,629 --> 02:51:52,809
That's embarrassing.

1605
02:51:52,809 --> 02:51:55,180
I lost like a thousand

1606
02:51:55,180 --> 02:51:57,180
viewers.

1607
02:52:01,020 --> 02:52:04,729
That's so bad.

1608
02:52:04,729 --> 02:52:06,729
Okay, if I was a marketing person

1609
02:52:06,729 --> 02:52:09,540
I would come to me and be like

1610
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:11,540
hey dude, don't fucking

1611
02:52:11,540 --> 02:52:15,190
do that again. You lost

1612
02:52:15,190 --> 02:52:17,190
a thousand people.

1613
02:52:17,190 --> 02:52:19,190
You lost like 20% of your whole

1614
02:52:19,190 --> 02:52:22,139
audience.

1615
02:52:22,139 --> 02:52:24,500
That's a new record.

1616
02:52:24,500 --> 02:52:26,500
Who cares?

1617
02:52:26,500 --> 02:52:29,000
Who gives a fuck, right?

1618
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:36,760
It's all good.

1619
02:52:36,760 --> 02:52:40,790
But thank you Mostly Lost.

1620
02:52:40,790 --> 02:52:42,790
PastaGlobs

1621
02:52:42,790 --> 02:52:45,030
250, bless you for putting up

1622
02:52:45,030 --> 02:52:47,030
with dumb technical bullshit for as long as

1623
02:52:47,030 --> 02:52:49,030
you could. We love you.

1624
02:52:49,030 --> 02:52:52,489
Thank you. I think it was worth it because

1625
02:52:52,489 --> 02:52:55,049
the game is worth it. I think so.

1626
02:52:59,719 --> 02:53:01,719
Demias, thanks for five subs.

1627
02:53:01,719 --> 02:53:04,020
Demias, thank you.

1628
02:53:04,020 --> 02:53:06,020
Jerma lied about Minecraft

1629
02:53:06,020 --> 02:53:08,389
VR, five subs.

1630
02:53:08,389 --> 02:53:10,389
Rin the cutest, three subs.

1631
02:53:10,389 --> 02:53:12,760
Dr. Steen, five subs.

1632
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:14,760
Sroiliat, Sroiliat

1633
02:53:14,760 --> 02:53:17,899
give 20, which is unfucking

1634
02:53:17,899 --> 02:53:21,159
believable. Thank you Sroiliat.

1635
02:53:21,159 --> 02:53:23,159
Sroiliat,

1636
02:53:23,159 --> 02:53:25,159
Sroiliat won.

1637
02:53:25,159 --> 02:53:28,549
Jerma lied about

1638
02:53:28,549 --> 02:53:30,549
Minecraft VR, another 10

1639
02:53:30,549 --> 02:53:34,700
community subs.

1640
02:53:34,700 --> 02:53:36,700
I can't fucking believe you'd give this

1641
02:53:36,700 --> 02:53:40,340
many subs, thank you. That's a lot

1642
02:53:40,340 --> 02:53:42,340
of money, it's a lot of contribution, it's a ton

1643
02:53:42,340 --> 02:53:44,340
of fucking, it's a big paycheck.

1644
02:53:44,340 --> 02:53:46,709
I

1645
02:53:46,709 --> 02:53:48,709
can't even, thank you.

1646
02:53:48,709 --> 02:53:52,299
15 community subs

1647
02:53:52,299 --> 02:53:55,559
tonight. I don't

1648
02:53:55,559 --> 02:53:57,559
have much else to say. I can't believe

1649
02:53:57,559 --> 02:54:00,629
it, thank you. Jerma lied

1650
02:54:00,629 --> 02:54:02,629
about Fruity Loops, I lie about

1651
02:54:02,629 --> 02:54:04,940
everything. Jerma, what's up? Like the stream

1652
02:54:04,940 --> 02:54:06,940
but I think Fruity Loops would be better, I do too.

1653
02:54:06,940 --> 02:54:08,940
And a real guitarist

1654
02:54:08,940 --> 02:54:10,940
to be hired to

1655
02:54:10,940 --> 02:54:12,940
play the guitar on the stream.

1656
02:54:12,940 --> 02:54:15,940
I'm working on it.

1657
02:54:15,940 --> 02:54:17,940
Jerma lied about Minecraft VR,

1658
02:54:17,940 --> 02:54:19,940
lying about a lot of things tonight.

1659
02:54:19,940 --> 02:54:22,440
Hey Benito, maybe in

1660
02:54:22,440 --> 02:54:24,440
your drunken stupor you'll reconsider your

1661
02:54:24,440 --> 02:54:26,440
weird authoritarian stance on enabling

1662
02:54:26,440 --> 02:54:28,440
the Pog emote.

1663
02:54:28,440 --> 02:54:40,010
Like really? We got this shit.

1664
02:54:40,010 --> 02:54:42,010
That's better than it, that's the best.

1665
02:54:42,010 --> 02:54:45,590
Do you need anything else

1666
02:54:45,590 --> 02:54:49,299
besides that? Man Bear

1667
02:54:49,299 --> 02:54:51,299
Pig, 15 dollars from Man Bear Pig.

1668
02:54:51,299 --> 02:54:53,299
Jerma, it's probably weird

1669
02:54:53,299 --> 02:54:55,299
hearing this with somebody on the internet,

1670
02:54:55,299 --> 02:54:57,299
but you helped me overcome depression with how

1671
02:54:57,299 --> 02:54:59,299
funny you are. Just want to say thanks

1672
02:54:59,299 --> 02:55:01,299
for everything you've done, even if you don't know

1673
02:55:01,299 --> 02:55:06,229
you did it.

1674
02:55:06,229 --> 02:55:09,940
Anytime somebody tells me that,

1675
02:55:09,940 --> 02:55:12,950
happens maybe once every couple

1676
02:55:12,950 --> 02:55:14,950
weeks.

1677
02:55:14,950 --> 02:55:18,600
Maybe like once a month

1678
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:20,600
somebody talks about their depression on the stream.

1679
02:55:20,600 --> 02:55:23,799
And how like this community in the

1680
02:55:23,799 --> 02:55:25,799
stream has made it easier and fun

1681
02:55:25,799 --> 02:55:29,379
and interesting for them.

1682
02:55:29,379 --> 02:55:31,379
I can't even fucking

1683
02:55:31,379 --> 02:55:33,379
respond. I can't believe it.

1684
02:55:33,379 --> 02:55:37,670
I am so

1685
02:55:37,670 --> 02:55:39,670
happy that you can have fucking

1686
02:55:39,670 --> 02:55:41,670
fun here.

1687
02:55:41,670 --> 02:55:43,670
You can forget about the bullshit of the daily

1688
02:55:43,670 --> 02:55:45,670
life. You can come here and enjoy yourself

1689
02:55:45,670 --> 02:55:47,670
with this community, with these people

1690
02:55:47,670 --> 02:55:49,670
and this stream.

1691
02:55:49,670 --> 02:55:53,000
I will never fucking forget

1692
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
that. I will never

1693
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
fucking forget it. So

1694
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:00,010
when somebody says something

1695
02:56:00,010 --> 02:56:03,079
like this, it

1696
02:56:03,079 --> 02:56:05,079
means a lot. It hits me to my

1697
02:56:05,079 --> 02:56:10,459
very fucking core. I

1698
02:56:10,459 --> 02:56:12,459
really truly hope the best for you. I do.

1699
02:56:12,459 --> 02:56:17,510
Thank you for the $15.

1700
02:56:17,510 --> 02:56:19,510
Thanks for sticking around. Thanks for hanging out.

1701
02:56:19,510 --> 02:56:30,459
I'm depressed that these fucking streams help

1702
02:56:30,459 --> 02:56:34,549
the ever-living shit out of me.

1703
02:56:34,549 --> 02:56:36,549
We've got a great community here. We really

1704
02:56:36,549 --> 02:56:39,370
do. Forget about like the

1705
02:56:39,370 --> 02:56:41,370
meta in-joke stuff that

1706
02:56:41,370 --> 02:56:43,370
people say. We all say it, right?

1707
02:56:43,370 --> 02:56:46,059
But at its very, very core,

1708
02:56:46,059 --> 02:56:48,059
this is a great, really

1709
02:56:48,059 --> 02:56:50,059
great fucking community. So

1710
02:56:50,059 --> 02:56:52,059
many people are

1711
02:56:52,059 --> 02:56:54,360
so great here. I am

1712
02:56:54,360 --> 02:56:56,360
so forever blessed

1713
02:56:56,360 --> 02:56:58,360
with this group of people.

1714
02:56:58,360 --> 02:57:01,110
Pin wrote a

1715
02:57:01,110 --> 02:57:03,110
paper on this shit. We have

1716
02:57:03,110 --> 02:57:05,110
like papers and like scientific

1717
02:57:05,110 --> 02:57:07,110
documents based

1718
02:57:07,110 --> 02:57:09,110
on this community. Do you understand?

1719
02:57:09,110 --> 02:57:14,100
God, it means a fucking lot.

1720
02:57:14,100 --> 02:57:16,100
I hope you fucking understand that.

1721
02:57:16,100 --> 02:57:21,670
You guys have given me so much.

1722
02:57:21,670 --> 02:57:24,620
I am completely

1723
02:57:24,620 --> 02:57:26,620
grateful and forever happy

1724
02:57:26,620 --> 02:57:28,790
that you can take something from

1725
02:57:28,790 --> 02:57:32,180
here too. God damn.

1726
02:57:32,180 --> 02:57:34,180
Like, I wish you the best, for real.

1727
02:57:34,180 --> 02:57:40,520
There's a lot of great fucking people here.

1728
02:57:40,520 --> 02:57:50,309
I wish there was more I could say.

1729
02:57:50,309 --> 02:57:55,620
So much money and so

1730
02:57:55,620 --> 02:57:57,620
much happiness and

1731
02:57:57,620 --> 02:58:00,500
acceptance and fun and

1732
02:58:00,500 --> 02:58:02,500
interesting things and interesting conversations

1733
02:58:02,500 --> 02:58:05,000
happen here. I couldn't trade

1734
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
it for anything, even if I wanted to.

1735
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,180
It's impossible.

1736
02:58:09,180 --> 02:58:11,180
I couldn't do that.

1737
02:58:11,180 --> 02:58:14,309
There's so many great things.

1738
02:58:14,309 --> 02:58:17,000
Look at the shit from fucking last

1739
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
week. Look at the game. Somebody

1740
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,430
made a video game

1741
02:58:21,430 --> 02:58:23,430
about this community. It's like

1742
02:58:23,430 --> 02:58:25,430
what? It's unbelievable.

1743
02:58:25,430 --> 02:58:28,120
Every fucking day.

1744
02:58:28,120 --> 02:58:31,770
Don't think, I don't think

1745
02:58:31,770 --> 02:58:33,770
about this on a daily

1746
02:58:33,770 --> 02:58:39,340
basis. Thank you for

1747
02:58:39,340 --> 02:58:41,340
everything. Thanks for hanging out. I'm happy

1748
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:43,639
that you have a community.

1749
02:58:43,639 --> 02:58:45,639
You have an outlet. You have something fun to do.

1750
02:58:45,639 --> 02:58:49,989
And I'm gonna keep doing it. I'm gonna

1751
02:58:49,989 --> 02:58:51,989
try to keep this community going. I'm gonna keep doing

1752
02:58:51,989 --> 02:58:53,989
things that I think are interesting, that I think

1753
02:58:53,989 --> 02:58:56,549
are fun. If you wanna ride the ride,

1754
02:58:56,549 --> 02:58:59,049
I hope you do. If it's not for you,

1755
02:58:59,049 --> 02:59:01,049
thanks for coming out.

1756
02:59:01,049 --> 02:59:03,350
Anyways, thanks for watching.

1757
02:59:03,350 --> 02:59:06,549
Even if you don't think it's for you.

1758
02:59:06,549 --> 02:59:09,799
Thank you for giving

1759
02:59:09,799 --> 02:59:11,799
me even a fucking second of your goddamn time.

1760
02:59:11,799 --> 02:59:26,059
For real.

1761
02:59:26,059 --> 02:59:28,059
E-Dragon, thanks for the $5 E-Dragon.

1762
02:59:28,059 --> 02:59:32,149
I wanted to give you $5

1763
02:59:32,149 --> 02:59:34,149
for my birthday, but

1764
02:59:34,149 --> 02:59:36,149
now I think you should give it to Kim for that scare.

1765
02:59:36,149 --> 02:59:38,149
I'll give it to Kim.

1766
02:59:38,149 --> 02:59:41,989
Door Cube, thanks for the $2.50. This $2.50

1767
02:59:41,989 --> 02:59:43,989
is for Kim. She deserves it. I can't believe she's

1768
02:59:43,989 --> 02:59:45,989
tied in the fucking closet. That's insane.

1769
02:59:45,989 --> 02:59:49,059
Kim will get it. For sure.

1770
02:59:49,059 --> 02:59:51,059
Kim Bits.

1771
02:59:51,059 --> 02:59:53,059
PikaBanana,

1772
02:59:53,059 --> 02:59:55,059
thanks for the $5 Pika.

1773
02:59:55,059 --> 02:59:57,059
Kim is amazing. That was absolutely hilarious. Awesome

1774
02:59:57,059 --> 02:59:59,299
stream as always. I'm glad

1775
02:59:59,299 --> 03:00:01,299
you enjoyed yourself. Thanks for sticking around.

1776
03:00:01,299 --> 03:00:09,350
Thank you. Wilma,

1777
03:00:09,350 --> 03:00:11,350
thanks for the $2.52.

1778
03:00:11,350 --> 03:00:13,350
Cheer52, no message. Thank you, Wilma.

1779
03:00:13,350 --> 03:00:15,350
Unkind,

1780
03:00:15,350 --> 03:00:17,350
$5 from Unkind.

1781
03:00:17,350 --> 03:00:19,350
Hey, JermaBabe,

1782
03:00:19,350 --> 03:00:21,350
I had a really shitty day

1783
03:00:21,350 --> 03:00:23,350
preparing for my trigonometry

1784
03:00:23,350 --> 03:00:25,350
exam, but just popping in very

1785
03:00:25,350 --> 03:00:27,350
quickly at the end of the stream and seeing you

1786
03:00:27,350 --> 03:00:29,350
scream like a little girl

1787
03:00:29,350 --> 03:00:31,590
made my day.

1788
03:00:31,590 --> 03:00:34,659
Jerma Heart, I wish you luck on

1789
03:00:34,659 --> 03:00:39,340
your trigonometry exam.

1790
03:00:39,340 --> 03:00:41,340
I'm glad you got some happiness

1791
03:00:41,340 --> 03:00:44,790
from that. Thank you. Good luck.

1792
03:00:44,790 --> 03:00:49,209
The scare was very real.

1793
03:00:49,209 --> 03:00:51,209
I just, you don't know, when you're in VR,

1794
03:00:51,209 --> 03:00:53,209
the world closes in.

1795
03:00:53,209 --> 03:00:56,469
Nothing else exists,

1796
03:00:56,469 --> 03:00:58,469
you know? It's hard.

1797
03:00:58,469 --> 03:01:01,219
Thank you, Unkind

1798
03:01:01,219 --> 03:01:03,219
though. Have a great exam.

1799
03:01:03,219 --> 03:01:05,219
Hope you ace it. A minus.

1800
03:01:05,219 --> 03:01:07,219
I'm not gonna give you the A plus

1801
03:01:07,219 --> 03:01:11,450
here. Kim's the perfect match

1802
03:01:11,450 --> 03:01:13,450
for you. You two are the only people I know who would

1803
03:01:13,450 --> 03:01:15,450
be willing to stand in a closet for half an hour for a prank.

1804
03:01:15,450 --> 03:01:17,450
She's great. She puts up

1805
03:01:17,450 --> 03:01:21,100
without my bullshit. If you

1806
03:01:21,100 --> 03:01:23,100
find a girl or a guy

1807
03:01:23,100 --> 03:01:25,100
wherever, doesn't matter, I will

1808
03:01:25,100 --> 03:01:27,100
put up with your fucking bullshit.

1809
03:01:27,100 --> 03:01:29,100
She's great. She's fun.

1810
03:01:29,100 --> 03:01:31,979
She means everything to me, so.

1811
03:01:31,979 --> 03:01:37,860
It's great.

1812
03:01:37,860 --> 03:01:40,620
That's for real. If you get a

1813
03:01:40,620 --> 03:01:43,370
human, take him. Yeah.

1814
03:01:43,370 --> 03:01:49,129
Hold on to those that you love.

1815
03:01:49,129 --> 03:01:51,129
My sunflower seed block. What a

1816
03:01:51,129 --> 03:01:54,520
champ, huh? How does

1817
03:01:54,520 --> 03:01:56,520
one find that? Accidentally go to a Christmas

1818
03:01:56,520 --> 03:01:58,520
party and meet somebody and accidentally

1819
03:01:58,520 --> 03:02:02,489
hang out with them. That's what happened to me.

1820
03:02:02,489 --> 03:02:05,110
That's it. Sometimes shit just happens.

1821
03:02:05,110 --> 03:02:07,110
You can't plan for it, guys.

1822
03:02:07,110 --> 03:02:09,670
You'll never know.

1823
03:02:09,670 --> 03:02:11,670
It just happens.

1824
03:02:11,670 --> 03:02:13,670
I was single for like seven years.

1825
03:02:13,670 --> 03:02:15,670
It just fucking happens sometimes.

1826
03:02:15,670 --> 03:02:18,739
I would be the last

1827
03:02:18,739 --> 03:02:25,270
person to tell you that that was going to happen.

1828
03:02:25,270 --> 03:02:27,270
It was Burger Boy's Christmas party.

1829
03:02:27,270 --> 03:02:30,090
Well, that's not true.

1830
03:02:30,090 --> 03:02:32,090
It was a Christmas party I went to with Burger Boy.

1831
03:02:32,090 --> 03:02:35,659
She was just there.

1832
03:02:35,659 --> 03:02:39,750
Just be approachable.

1833
03:02:39,750 --> 03:02:46,840
Be yourself. Tinder

1834
03:02:46,840 --> 03:02:48,840
update. No matches.

1835
03:02:48,840 --> 03:02:50,840
That's it. No matches.

1836
03:02:50,840 --> 03:02:53,079
That Tinder shit was depressing.

1837
03:02:53,079 --> 03:02:55,079
Tinder sucks. Delete that

1838
03:02:55,079 --> 03:02:57,079
fucking app. Don't use that app.

1839
03:02:57,079 --> 03:02:59,079
That app is poison. Don't use

1840
03:02:59,079 --> 03:03:07,850
it. Kim, that's

1841
03:03:07,850 --> 03:03:13,860
amazing. Thank you.

1842
03:03:13,860 --> 03:03:19,110
Okay, Cupid.

1843
03:03:19,110 --> 03:03:21,110
Just be yourself and just try.

1844
03:03:21,110 --> 03:03:29,540
That's all you can do.

1845
03:03:29,540 --> 03:03:31,540
But error of paradox

1846
03:03:31,540 --> 03:03:33,540
thanks to the three bucks franker Z.

1847
03:03:33,540 --> 03:03:35,540
That's a dog. Thank you,

1848
03:03:35,540 --> 03:03:37,540
three dollars. Error of paradox

1849
03:03:37,540 --> 03:03:39,540
again, 250. Jerma, I'm going

1850
03:03:39,540 --> 03:03:41,540
to Vegas for my 21st birthday.

1851
03:03:41,540 --> 03:03:43,540
Can we please do the level up lounge

1852
03:03:43,540 --> 03:03:45,540
thing? It'd be the best birthday ever.

1853
03:03:45,540 --> 03:03:48,229
It's probably going to take a while

1854
03:03:48,229 --> 03:03:50,229
for me to get that going, but I want to do

1855
03:03:50,229 --> 03:03:53,049
that. People want

1856
03:03:53,049 --> 03:03:55,860
to do a meetup. And

1857
03:03:55,860 --> 03:03:57,860
hey, you're going to be at TwitchCon.

1858
03:03:57,860 --> 03:03:59,860
I don't want you guys to fucking stand at a goddamn

1859
03:03:59,860 --> 03:04:02,100
line.

1860
03:04:02,100 --> 03:04:04,100
Waiting for my signature. Like a

1861
03:04:04,100 --> 03:04:06,100
fucking Disney World ride.

1862
03:04:06,100 --> 03:04:08,469
No, fuck that.

1863
03:04:08,469 --> 03:04:11,100
We're throwing a fucking party.

1864
03:04:11,100 --> 03:04:14,680
You understand? Oh, hey, welcome to the

1865
03:04:14,680 --> 03:04:16,680
fucking meetup. Here's your signature, bye.

1866
03:04:16,680 --> 03:04:18,680
No, fuck that shit.

1867
03:04:18,680 --> 03:04:23,479
I ain't doing like a TwitchCon

1868
03:04:23,479 --> 03:04:25,479
standing fucking line meetup.

1869
03:04:25,479 --> 03:04:31,559
Some people have to do that because they have

1870
03:04:31,559 --> 03:04:33,989
so many people. And I

1871
03:04:33,989 --> 03:04:36,739
understand. But if I'm able

1872
03:04:36,739 --> 03:04:40,200
to rent out a place,

1873
03:04:40,200 --> 03:04:42,200
fuck it, let's do it. Let's just have fun.

1874
03:04:42,200 --> 03:04:44,200
Anybody's invited, 21

1875
03:04:44,200 --> 03:04:46,200
over. Let me see what I can do.

1876
03:04:46,200 --> 03:04:51,700
JermaCon. No, it'll be

1877
03:04:51,700 --> 03:04:54,200
a lot smaller than that. We

1878
03:04:54,200 --> 03:04:56,200
can like trickle into the casino and just dick around

1879
03:04:56,200 --> 03:04:58,200
for a little while. Put like fucking 20

1880
03:04:58,200 --> 03:05:00,200
bucks on a double zero. Why not?

1881
03:05:00,200 --> 03:05:03,340
Fuck it, let's do it. I'm done.

1882
03:05:03,340 --> 03:05:14,090
Should be fun.

1883
03:05:14,090 --> 03:05:16,090
21. Gotta be 21.

1884
03:05:16,090 --> 03:05:18,329
And only like four people.

1885
03:05:18,329 --> 03:05:20,329
You know what? If four people show

1886
03:05:20,329 --> 03:05:22,329
up, then that's

1887
03:05:22,329 --> 03:05:24,329
great. Thanks for coming.

1888
03:05:24,329 --> 03:05:26,950
I will treat you

1889
03:05:26,950 --> 03:05:28,950
like fucking royalty.

1890
03:05:28,950 --> 03:05:33,989
If you decide to show up. Seriously.

1891
03:05:33,989 --> 03:05:36,489
You guys don't even understand.

1892
03:05:41,739 --> 03:05:43,739
When I went to TwitchCon, there's a quick little story.

1893
03:05:43,739 --> 03:05:46,170
TwitchCon last year,

1894
03:05:46,170 --> 03:05:48,170
or like two years ago, whenever

1895
03:05:48,170 --> 03:05:50,170
it was in Long Beach.

1896
03:05:50,170 --> 03:05:52,729
One person

1897
03:05:52,729 --> 03:05:54,729
came to the

1898
03:05:54,729 --> 03:05:56,729
meetup that I put on Twitter.

1899
03:05:56,729 --> 03:05:59,350
It was Red Ranger. Not sure if they're

1900
03:05:59,350 --> 03:06:01,350
still around in the community or not, but regardless.

1901
03:06:01,350 --> 03:06:04,680
That's who

1902
03:06:04,680 --> 03:06:06,680
we hung out for like fucking

1903
03:06:06,680 --> 03:06:11,860
45 minutes.

1904
03:06:11,860 --> 03:06:13,860
I don't give a shit about

1905
03:06:13,860 --> 03:06:16,100
how fucking many

1906
03:06:16,100 --> 03:06:18,100
people are there, how big the line is,

1907
03:06:18,100 --> 03:06:20,100
oh yeah, policy.

1908
03:06:20,100 --> 03:06:25,590
I don't give a shit.

1909
03:06:25,590 --> 03:06:27,590
We sat and we fucking talked and we hung out

1910
03:06:27,590 --> 03:06:32,840
for like a fucking hour. One person.

1911
03:06:32,840 --> 03:06:35,719
I don't fucking care.

1912
03:06:35,719 --> 03:06:38,920
That person

1913
03:06:38,920 --> 03:06:41,350
watched the streams,

1914
03:06:41,350 --> 03:06:43,659
cared about this content,

1915
03:06:43,659 --> 03:06:46,649
cared about this community.

1916
03:06:46,649 --> 03:06:48,649
I don't fucking care if one person, I don't care if fucking

1917
03:06:48,649 --> 03:06:50,649
ten people, five people, I don't give a shit.

1918
03:06:50,649 --> 03:06:53,340
One fucking person

1919
03:06:53,340 --> 03:06:55,340
could go and it would like light up my

1920
03:06:55,340 --> 03:06:59,620
life. I don't care.

1921
03:06:59,620 --> 03:07:01,620
I don't give a shit about all that.

1922
03:07:01,620 --> 03:07:03,930
I really don't. I hope you fucking know that.

1923
03:07:03,930 --> 03:07:07,260
The one guy could

1924
03:07:07,260 --> 03:07:09,260
show up. That would be fucking great.

1925
03:07:09,260 --> 03:07:11,260
We would have a blast. I would do karaoke.

1926
03:07:11,260 --> 03:07:14,649
Who cares?

1927
03:07:14,649 --> 03:07:16,649
If 200 people show up,

1928
03:07:16,649 --> 03:07:19,909
I hope I can give you all attention.

1929
03:07:19,909 --> 03:07:28,680
Do you mind if I get drunk as fuck?

1930
03:07:28,680 --> 03:07:30,680
Get drunk as fuck. It's Vegas.

1931
03:07:30,680 --> 03:07:35,930
It's Las Vegas, dude.

1932
03:07:35,930 --> 03:07:37,930
What do you mean, do you care if I get drunk?

1933
03:07:37,930 --> 03:07:41,510
It's Las Vegas, Nevada.

1934
03:07:41,510 --> 03:07:43,750
Just be safe. Don't fucking drive.

1935
03:07:43,750 --> 03:07:45,750
Don't do that shit.

1936
03:07:45,750 --> 03:07:47,750
Get a Lyft, get an Uber to your AirBnB

1937
03:07:47,750 --> 03:07:49,750
or hotel. The hotels are all right here.

1938
03:07:49,750 --> 03:07:52,309
Get a room for like 30

1939
03:07:52,309 --> 03:07:54,309
bucks at fucking MGM. They're like

1940
03:07:54,309 --> 03:08:01,100
nothing. Does the open bar have

1941
03:08:01,100 --> 03:08:03,100
milkshakes?

1942
03:08:03,100 --> 03:08:06,229
Maybe. It depends. Staying in

1943
03:08:06,229 --> 03:08:08,229
an AirBnB in Vegas.

1944
03:08:08,229 --> 03:08:17,370
But for real, I don't

1945
03:08:17,370 --> 03:08:19,370
care if one person wants to

1946
03:08:19,370 --> 03:08:21,799
say hello or a thousand.

1947
03:08:21,799 --> 03:08:23,799
We've done meetups before. I don't do

1948
03:08:23,799 --> 03:08:26,360
Twitch or like YouTube

1949
03:08:26,360 --> 03:08:29,049
sponsored meetups.

1950
03:08:29,049 --> 03:08:31,049
The last time I did one, we just filled up a lobby

1951
03:08:31,049 --> 03:08:33,049
and just hung out for like fucking two or three hours.

1952
03:08:33,049 --> 03:08:38,940
I don't

1953
03:08:38,940 --> 03:08:42,329
give a shit about that.

1954
03:08:42,329 --> 03:08:44,329
I don't care about feeding people through fucking

1955
03:08:44,329 --> 03:08:49,639
goddamn line.

1956
03:08:49,639 --> 03:08:51,639
And I might be talking shit

1957
03:08:51,639 --> 03:08:53,639
right now. But whatever.

1958
03:08:53,639 --> 03:09:02,920
I don't care. Deodorant is

1959
03:09:02,920 --> 03:09:04,920
necessary.

1960
03:09:04,920 --> 03:09:10,409
It is. We're in. But

1961
03:09:10,409 --> 03:09:13,219
I'm not gonna stand on a soapbox

1962
03:09:13,219 --> 03:09:17,700
anymore. If I do it,

1963
03:09:17,700 --> 03:09:19,700
you'll know well in advance.

1964
03:09:19,700 --> 03:09:28,020
But each and every fucking

1965
03:09:28,020 --> 03:09:30,020
one of you has grown this channel.

1966
03:09:30,020 --> 03:09:32,020
Has stuck with this channel.

1967
03:09:32,020 --> 03:09:34,709
So why wouldn't I value

1968
03:09:34,709 --> 03:09:36,709
every fucking single one of you?

1969
03:09:36,709 --> 03:09:40,620
The reason why, oh you had

1970
03:09:40,620 --> 03:09:42,620
4500 fucking people watching?

1971
03:09:42,620 --> 03:09:44,620
That's like top 10, top 20 on Twitch.

1972
03:09:44,620 --> 03:09:46,979
Are you serious?

1973
03:09:46,979 --> 03:09:48,979
What? I'm not gonna give you the credit that you deserve

1974
03:09:48,979 --> 03:09:51,860
for that? Are you serious?

1975
03:09:51,860 --> 03:09:53,860
Like that's such a huge fucking deal.

1976
03:09:53,860 --> 03:09:59,180
A shitload of you make

1977
03:09:59,180 --> 03:10:01,180
this channel as popular and as

1978
03:10:01,180 --> 03:10:04,180
interesting as it is.

1979
03:10:04,180 --> 03:10:06,180
Never fucking forget that.

1980
03:10:06,180 --> 03:10:08,180
Never, ever, fucking

1981
03:10:08,180 --> 03:10:11,510
ever forget that.

1982
03:10:11,510 --> 03:10:17,909
Ever. Oh look at me.

1983
03:10:17,909 --> 03:10:27,579
2020.

1984
03:10:27,579 --> 03:10:29,579
For me to get up here and like

1985
03:10:29,579 --> 03:10:32,010
drink a bottle of wine

1986
03:10:32,010 --> 03:10:34,010
and like act out my dumb fucking

1987
03:10:34,010 --> 03:10:36,440
skits. And you're

1988
03:10:36,440 --> 03:10:38,440
watching. Like I don't

1989
03:10:38,440 --> 03:10:40,440
have anything else to tell you.

1990
03:10:40,440 --> 03:10:43,450
That's remarkable that somebody would do

1991
03:10:43,450 --> 03:10:47,799
that. But Superman,

1992
03:10:47,799 --> 03:10:49,799
thanks for the 297.

1993
03:10:49,799 --> 03:10:52,549
He's knocking shit over. Now that's an empty cup.

1994
03:10:52,549 --> 03:10:55,180
Jerma, I got a vibe.

1995
03:10:55,180 --> 03:10:57,180
I have to see how much fun you're having with it.

1996
03:10:57,180 --> 03:10:59,180
And I can't stop playing Beat Saber. What a great game.

1997
03:10:59,180 --> 03:11:01,180
By the way.

1998
03:11:01,180 --> 03:11:03,180
Also, my stepbrother and I are going to Vegas

1999
03:11:03,180 --> 03:11:05,180
next week. What's my favorite

2000
03:11:05,180 --> 03:11:07,180
places you've been to?

2001
03:11:07,180 --> 03:11:09,180
And where do you want to go? Best wishes.

2002
03:11:09,180 --> 03:11:11,610
Well, I told you

2003
03:11:11,610 --> 03:11:14,620
my favorite casino is the Aria.

2004
03:11:14,620 --> 03:11:16,620
It's just that everything is in the Aria. I love the Aria.

2005
03:11:16,620 --> 03:11:18,920
Downtown Vegas is great.

2006
03:11:18,920 --> 03:11:22,440
If you get to Fremont Street

2007
03:11:22,440 --> 03:11:24,440
for real. It's a great

2008
03:11:24,440 --> 03:11:26,440
place. A lot of good pizza.

2009
03:11:26,440 --> 03:11:28,440
Evil Knievel's got great pizza.

2010
03:11:28,440 --> 03:11:31,319
Aria. The Aria.

2011
03:11:31,319 --> 03:11:33,319
Like this, right? The Aria.

2012
03:11:33,319 --> 03:11:35,819
Like that.

2013
03:11:35,819 --> 03:11:40,100
There you go. The Aria.

2014
03:11:40,100 --> 03:11:43,620
If you want to walk the strip, it takes about

2015
03:11:43,620 --> 03:11:45,620
two plus hours to walk the whole

2016
03:11:45,620 --> 03:11:47,620
thing. So just the whole thing.

2017
03:11:47,620 --> 03:11:49,620
I've had a few glasses of wine. Give me a break.

2018
03:11:49,620 --> 03:11:54,360
Takes about two hours to walk the whole thing.

2019
03:11:54,360 --> 03:11:57,500
Wouldn't recommend it. Stay somewhere.

2020
03:11:57,500 --> 03:12:00,950
Go to Hash House

2021
03:12:00,950 --> 03:12:02,950
Agogo at the Link.

2022
03:12:02,950 --> 03:12:05,579
The Link is, I mean, the casino is alright.

2023
03:12:05,579 --> 03:12:07,579
And the drinks are alright.

2024
03:12:07,579 --> 03:12:09,579
And the place is alright. But Hash House Agogo

2025
03:12:09,579 --> 03:12:11,579
at the Link

2026
03:12:11,579 --> 03:12:13,579
has the best cheeseburger

2027
03:12:13,579 --> 03:12:15,579
I have ever eaten.

2028
03:12:15,579 --> 03:12:17,579
It is the best I have ever

2029
03:12:17,579 --> 03:12:19,579
consumed in my entire 34 years

2030
03:12:19,579 --> 03:12:21,579
on the planet.

2031
03:12:21,579 --> 03:12:23,750
Hash House Agogo. Fucking go there and eat their food.

2032
03:12:23,750 --> 03:12:25,750
It's fantastic.

2033
03:12:25,750 --> 03:12:28,180
That is not sponsored. It's just real life.

2034
03:12:28,180 --> 03:12:30,180
It's just real life.

2035
03:12:30,180 --> 03:12:35,500
Okay? It's great.

2036
03:12:35,500 --> 03:12:37,500
They do like a lace burger.

2037
03:12:37,500 --> 03:12:39,500
They flatten it out. I want to go there

2038
03:12:39,500 --> 03:12:42,120
right now. It's just fucking reality.

2039
03:12:42,120 --> 03:12:50,569
Streamer condones hash

2040
03:12:50,569 --> 03:12:53,260
consumption.

2041
03:12:53,260 --> 03:12:55,260
Well, if it's Hash House Agogo, then yeah.

2042
03:12:55,260 --> 03:12:59,350
But thank you Superman.

2043
03:12:59,350 --> 03:13:01,780
Hope you have fun in Vegas.

2044
03:13:01,780 --> 03:13:03,780
Enjoy it. Just don't let it consume you.

2045
03:13:03,780 --> 03:13:06,280
There's a lot to do in Vegas.

2046
03:13:06,280 --> 03:13:08,280
Just be responsible.

2047
03:13:08,280 --> 03:13:10,969
Hazy thanks to the $5. They said shave.

2048
03:13:10,969 --> 03:13:12,969
I will in a few days.

2049
03:13:12,969 --> 03:13:15,909
Internet Jorge. $15

2050
03:13:15,909 --> 03:13:17,909
Internet Jorge. If JermaCon

2051
03:13:17,909 --> 03:13:19,909
actually happens, summer will be

2052
03:13:19,909 --> 03:13:21,909
awesome since I'm off

2053
03:13:21,909 --> 03:13:23,909
and request to work off. Jerma, I'm challenging

2054
03:13:23,909 --> 03:13:25,909
you to drink off.

2055
03:13:25,909 --> 03:13:28,409
I read that so wrong.

2056
03:13:28,409 --> 03:13:30,709
It's not going to be JermaCon. I don't want my

2057
03:13:30,709 --> 03:13:32,709
name in that shit. I'd rather

2058
03:13:32,709 --> 03:13:35,659
it be like the hangout

2059
03:13:35,659 --> 03:13:37,659
session or something.

2060
03:13:37,659 --> 03:13:40,280
I don't know. JermaCon

2061
03:13:40,280 --> 03:13:43,290
sounds a little pretentious.

2062
03:13:43,290 --> 03:13:47,899
I'm going to

2063
03:13:47,899 --> 03:13:49,899
get in touch with MGM. I really

2064
03:13:49,899 --> 03:13:51,899
am. I swear to God this is real.

2065
03:13:51,899 --> 03:13:56,180
Grill MasterCon. If you can

2066
03:13:56,180 --> 03:13:58,180
make it, I'll talk. If it happens,

2067
03:13:58,180 --> 03:14:01,829
I'll talk about it a lot more.

2068
03:14:01,829 --> 03:14:03,829
21 plus. We'll see if I can get

2069
03:14:03,829 --> 03:14:05,829
a private party. It'll be fun.

2070
03:14:05,829 --> 03:14:09,479
Thanks for the $15.

2071
03:14:09,479 --> 03:14:12,620
Something or utter

2072
03:14:12,620 --> 03:14:14,790
thanks for the $2.50. Can't wait for

2073
03:14:14,790 --> 03:14:16,790
JermaCon. Hope you can handle your liquor better at

2074
03:14:16,790 --> 03:14:18,790
the open bar. I'm good.

2075
03:14:18,790 --> 03:14:21,350
Thank you Bingo Sunshine for the $15.

2076
03:14:21,350 --> 03:14:23,350
I'm going to charge back these bits

2077
03:14:23,350 --> 03:14:25,350
if you don't stream tomorrow.

2078
03:14:28,040 --> 03:14:33,340
Come on.

2079
03:14:33,340 --> 03:14:36,149
I might...

2080
03:14:36,149 --> 03:14:38,899
God damn it. I'll try.

2081
03:14:38,899 --> 03:14:41,139
I didn't think I was going to drink this much

2082
03:14:41,139 --> 03:14:44,469
wine. I might have to fucking

2083
03:14:44,469 --> 03:14:46,469
sleep tomorrow. What a fucking

2084
03:14:46,469 --> 03:14:50,620
asshole.

2085
03:14:50,620 --> 03:14:52,620
And I took three days off.

2086
03:14:52,620 --> 03:14:54,620
What is this, like an eight hour stream?

2087
03:14:54,620 --> 03:14:56,620
I'll see you in a few days. I'm going to take another

2088
03:14:56,620 --> 03:14:58,620
few days off.

2089
03:15:01,299 --> 03:15:03,610
God damn it.

2090
03:15:03,610 --> 03:15:10,069
I appreciate the fact that people

2091
03:15:10,069 --> 03:15:12,069
really, for the most part,

2092
03:15:12,069 --> 03:15:17,450
they don't care.

2093
03:15:17,450 --> 03:15:19,450
The more that you guys understand, the more that

2094
03:15:19,450 --> 03:15:21,450
I can do the things that I want to do.

2095
03:15:21,450 --> 03:15:25,979
You understand? We talked

2096
03:15:25,979 --> 03:15:27,979
about it a lot. I don't have like a schedule.

2097
03:15:27,979 --> 03:15:29,979
I don't want a schedule.

2098
03:15:29,979 --> 03:15:32,219
I want to just do it

2099
03:15:32,219 --> 03:15:34,219
whenever, you know? Whenever I'm fucking

2100
03:15:34,219 --> 03:15:36,219
happy. Which is a lot,

2101
03:15:36,219 --> 03:15:39,030
right? I never want to force

2102
03:15:39,030 --> 03:15:41,030
myself or push myself

2103
03:15:41,030 --> 03:15:43,719
to do things I don't really necessarily

2104
03:15:43,719 --> 03:15:50,250
want to do, right? I've been doing this

2105
03:15:50,250 --> 03:15:56,069
for a long time. I hope you

2106
03:15:56,069 --> 03:15:58,250
understand that every

2107
03:15:58,250 --> 03:16:00,250
single fucking time I press that start

2108
03:16:00,250 --> 03:16:02,250
every time, every

2109
03:16:02,250 --> 03:16:04,250
single fucking time

2110
03:16:04,250 --> 03:16:06,680
that I press that start

2111
03:16:06,680 --> 03:16:09,370
streaming button on OBS.

2112
03:16:09,370 --> 03:16:11,370
I want you to have as much fun as possible.

2113
03:16:11,370 --> 03:16:14,250
So if somebody says, oh you took like three

2114
03:16:14,250 --> 03:16:16,250
or four days off, I just, I

2115
03:16:16,250 --> 03:16:18,250
just know that that, I want to make sure

2116
03:16:18,250 --> 03:16:20,250
every stream is fucking good

2117
03:16:20,250 --> 03:16:24,979
and fun for you. And sometimes I

2118
03:16:24,979 --> 03:16:30,420
have to take that time. I was like that

2119
03:16:30,420 --> 03:16:32,420
on YouTube. I mean maybe I'm not,

2120
03:16:32,420 --> 03:16:34,420
I don't stream as much as other people do, but

2121
03:16:34,420 --> 03:16:37,879
that's just kind of the way I work.

2122
03:16:37,879 --> 03:16:42,040
He's getting sentimental

2123
03:16:42,040 --> 03:16:44,040
again. No, you guys fucking get it.

2124
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:46,040
You really do. You guys fucking get it.

2125
03:16:46,040 --> 03:16:53,719
An actor.

2126
03:16:53,719 --> 03:16:56,790
No.

2127
03:16:56,790 --> 03:16:59,350
I couldn't ask for a fucking better life

2128
03:16:59,350 --> 03:17:01,350
and a better group of fucking people.

2129
03:17:01,350 --> 03:17:03,909
Like get it, you know.

2130
03:17:03,909 --> 03:17:08,180
God damn.

2131
03:17:08,180 --> 03:17:12,469
If only you guys knew. I say

2132
03:17:12,469 --> 03:17:14,469
it a lot and we've been talking about it for a long time

2133
03:17:14,469 --> 03:17:17,540
tonight. But my god.

2134
03:17:17,540 --> 03:17:27,270
Just wait, wait.

2135
03:17:27,270 --> 03:17:29,510
Another few weeks.

2136
03:17:29,510 --> 03:17:32,459
I got a lot of stuff planned.

2137
03:17:32,459 --> 03:17:41,979
Thank you.

2138
03:17:41,979 --> 03:17:43,979
It feels good to be funny. I finally found someone who can

2139
03:17:43,979 --> 03:17:45,979
make me laugh. I feel you.

2140
03:17:45,979 --> 03:17:49,620
Never change. Lord knows we need

2141
03:17:49,620 --> 03:17:51,620
more loving and well-meaning people.

2142
03:17:51,620 --> 03:17:54,309
Like yourself.

2143
03:17:54,309 --> 03:17:56,309
Fighting just a bunch of laughs and much needed.

2144
03:17:56,309 --> 03:17:59,370
I just want to

2145
03:17:59,370 --> 03:18:02,059
have a good time. That's all I

2146
03:18:02,059 --> 03:18:04,420
care about, you know.

2147
03:18:04,420 --> 03:18:06,420
In a world that's so fucking crazy.

2148
03:18:06,420 --> 03:18:08,420
We live in like a crazy fucking world.

2149
03:18:08,420 --> 03:18:13,739
The world is crazy.

2150
03:18:13,739 --> 03:18:15,739
In a society. In this society.

2151
03:18:15,739 --> 03:18:21,879
This is as much of an

2152
03:18:21,879 --> 03:18:26,040
outlet for me as it is for you.

2153
03:18:26,040 --> 03:18:28,790
I hope you understand that.

2154
03:18:28,790 --> 03:18:30,790
This is the Joker backstory.

2155
03:18:30,790 --> 03:18:32,790
We live in a society

2156
03:18:32,790 --> 03:18:34,790
where if you're fucking good at something,

2157
03:18:34,790 --> 03:18:37,670
fucking trees

2158
03:18:37,670 --> 03:18:42,659
regrowing. I'll never

2159
03:18:42,659 --> 03:18:44,659
be the biggest streamer. I'll never be the fucking most

2160
03:18:44,659 --> 03:18:46,659
respected streamer. Maybe.

2161
03:18:46,659 --> 03:18:48,969
But I got you guys.

2162
03:18:48,969 --> 03:18:50,969
I got this fucking group of people.

2163
03:18:50,969 --> 03:18:53,530
You all get this shit. You all understand.

2164
03:18:53,530 --> 03:18:55,770
I don't need anything more.

2165
03:18:55,770 --> 03:18:57,770
I don't need anything else.

2166
03:18:57,770 --> 03:19:00,069
I got a fucking group of funny fucking

2167
03:19:00,069 --> 03:19:03,079
people. I don't give

2168
03:19:03,079 --> 03:19:05,079
a fuck about anything else. Are you kidding me?

2169
03:19:05,079 --> 03:19:07,319
You think I give a shit about being

2170
03:19:07,319 --> 03:19:09,319
like the most popular?

2171
03:19:09,319 --> 03:19:11,319
I've got to make sure my post gets

2172
03:19:11,319 --> 03:19:13,319
20,000

2173
03:19:13,319 --> 03:19:15,319
thumbs up. I don't give a fuck.

2174
03:19:15,319 --> 03:19:19,540
Holy shit.

2175
03:19:19,540 --> 03:19:21,850
I don't care at all.

2176
03:19:21,850 --> 03:19:23,850
Hopefully this video can get

2177
03:19:23,850 --> 03:19:25,850
10,000 likes.

2178
03:19:25,850 --> 03:19:29,180
Please give. No.

2179
03:19:29,180 --> 03:19:31,180
I don't give a flying fuck about that.

2180
03:19:31,180 --> 03:19:41,020
Fuck that. Let's just have

2181
03:19:41,020 --> 03:19:44,280
fun. I'm getting worried about

2182
03:19:44,280 --> 03:19:46,280
him. No. Don't. Don't. Don't.

2183
03:19:46,280 --> 03:19:52,739
Don't. Wine gives him

2184
03:19:52,739 --> 03:19:54,739
the pot. I'm not going to swear for the rest of the stream.

2185
03:19:54,739 --> 03:19:57,620
I promise.

2186
03:19:57,620 --> 03:20:01,209
Not one more time.

2187
03:20:01,209 --> 03:20:04,540
Hey, Thevious!

2188
03:20:04,540 --> 03:20:06,540
Thanks for the five dollars.

2189
03:20:06,540 --> 03:20:08,540
I'm glad I got to

2190
03:20:08,540 --> 03:20:10,540
catch your stream today. It's honestly been one of my favorites.

2191
03:20:10,540 --> 03:20:12,540
Hope you play more VR

2192
03:20:12,540 --> 03:20:14,540
horror games. I had a

2193
03:20:14,540 --> 03:20:16,540
relationship and the other day.

2194
03:20:16,540 --> 03:20:18,540
And this really helped my mood.

2195
03:20:18,540 --> 03:20:20,540
It was only about a month long or so.

2196
03:20:20,540 --> 03:20:22,540
So I'm not completely torn.

2197
03:20:22,540 --> 03:20:24,540
But it was still rough since I'm dealing

2198
03:20:24,540 --> 03:20:26,540
with college finals.

2199
03:20:26,540 --> 03:20:28,540
Just wanted you to know that I appreciate your streams.

2200
03:20:28,540 --> 03:20:30,540
Thanks for great stream.

2201
03:20:30,540 --> 03:20:36,680
Turn my heart. I'm really sorry to hear that.

2202
03:20:36,680 --> 03:20:40,500
The one

2203
03:20:40,500 --> 03:20:42,809
thing you can take from that though

2204
03:20:42,809 --> 03:20:44,809
is if it was a month long, it

2205
03:20:44,809 --> 03:20:46,809
was, you know, you

2206
03:20:46,809 --> 03:20:48,809
figured out that it wasn't to be

2207
03:20:48,809 --> 03:20:51,799
and you moved on.

2208
03:20:51,799 --> 03:20:54,739
You're going to bounce back.

2209
03:20:54,739 --> 03:20:56,739
Just don't worry about it.

2210
03:20:56,739 --> 03:20:58,739
There's tons of other people in the ocean.

2211
03:20:58,739 --> 03:21:01,180
Just go diving.

2212
03:21:01,180 --> 03:21:03,739
You know. Don't worry about that.

2213
03:21:03,739 --> 03:21:05,739
Thankfully, you didn't figure that out

2214
03:21:05,739 --> 03:21:07,739
two or three years later.

2215
03:21:07,739 --> 03:21:14,459
Right? Tons of people are

2216
03:21:14,459 --> 03:21:16,459
drowning. I got my snorkel.

2217
03:21:16,459 --> 03:21:27,059
But, Thievous,

2218
03:21:27,059 --> 03:21:29,239
Thievous, I wish you the best.

2219
03:21:29,239 --> 03:21:32,120
Don't let it break you up too much.

2220
03:21:32,120 --> 03:21:34,739
Thanks for hanging out. Thanks for the five dollars.

2221
03:21:34,739 --> 03:21:37,559
Oh, Zalaski.

2222
03:21:37,559 --> 03:21:39,559
Thanks with three bucks. Alright, look here, boomer.

2223
03:21:39,559 --> 03:21:41,559
Olive Chat wants 2012

2224
03:21:41,559 --> 03:21:43,559
beef cake,

2225
03:21:43,559 --> 03:21:45,559
beef cake. Germaback,

2226
03:21:45,559 --> 03:21:47,739
take him out of the closet.

2227
03:21:47,739 --> 03:21:49,739
I'll never be that fucking Jack.

2228
03:21:49,739 --> 03:21:52,229
Guys, I spent every other

2229
03:21:52,229 --> 03:21:54,860
day in the gym.

2230
03:21:54,860 --> 03:21:56,860
Oh, that was a swear. You're right.

2231
03:21:56,860 --> 03:21:59,610
I was lifting four days

2232
03:21:59,610 --> 03:22:01,979
a week. Oh, it took

2233
03:22:01,979 --> 03:22:03,979
a 10, 20,

2234
03:22:03,979 --> 03:22:05,979
it took like 20 hours a week of my time.

2235
03:22:05,979 --> 03:22:09,559
Alright.

2236
03:22:09,559 --> 03:22:11,559
At Jexpo,

2237
03:22:11,559 --> 03:22:13,559
at Germa Jexcon

2238
03:22:13,559 --> 03:22:15,559
2019, I will

2239
03:22:15,559 --> 03:22:17,559
bench press 240 pounds.

2240
03:22:17,559 --> 03:22:20,379
Why did I say that?

2241
03:22:20,379 --> 03:22:23,579
I hope somebody can help me.

2242
03:22:23,579 --> 03:22:25,579
At Jexcon 2019,

2243
03:22:25,579 --> 03:22:31,139
I will bench press like

2244
03:22:31,139 --> 03:22:33,829
100 pounds and somebody can help me.

2245
03:22:33,829 --> 03:22:36,329
We're gonna have to need a spotter for that one.

2246
03:22:36,329 --> 03:22:40,299
It's gonna be

2247
03:22:40,299 --> 03:22:42,540
live streamed. Jexcon

2248
03:22:42,540 --> 03:22:44,540
2019 for the level up lounge.

2249
03:22:44,540 --> 03:22:46,540
Alright, I gotta stop saying that.

2250
03:22:46,540 --> 03:22:48,540
Because that's not true.

2251
03:22:48,540 --> 03:22:50,540
And somebody, MGM

2252
03:22:50,540 --> 03:22:52,540
might be like, that's not fucking happening, dude.

2253
03:22:52,540 --> 03:22:55,219
Like, don't say that shit.

2254
03:22:55,219 --> 03:22:57,850
But, hey, maybe

2255
03:22:57,850 --> 03:23:00,409
it will. Maybe it will.

2256
03:23:00,409 --> 03:23:02,840
Swear. Ah, it's alright.

2257
03:23:02,840 --> 03:23:06,620
Hey, broluck.

2258
03:23:06,620 --> 03:23:08,620
Thanks for the three bucks. They say nice hair.

2259
03:23:08,620 --> 03:23:13,420
Nice hair. What is it?

2260
03:23:13,420 --> 03:23:15,420
It says nice hair, apparently.

2261
03:23:15,420 --> 03:23:18,299
Let's find out what this means.

2262
03:23:18,299 --> 03:23:31,340
What is it? What's wrong with it?

2263
03:23:31,340 --> 03:23:43,030
What is it?

2264
03:23:43,030 --> 03:23:45,030
I don't get it.

2265
03:23:45,030 --> 03:23:49,690
Nice hair.

2266
03:23:49,690 --> 03:23:54,809
What's wrong with my hair?

2267
03:23:54,809 --> 03:23:58,010
Okay. Thanks.

2268
03:23:58,010 --> 03:24:00,010
Thanks, I guess.

2269
03:24:00,010 --> 03:24:11,000
Okay. Alright.

2270
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:14,899
Thank you, broluck.

2271
03:24:14,899 --> 03:24:16,899
Jerma lied about Minecraft VR

2272
03:24:16,899 --> 03:24:18,899
thanks to 250.

2273
03:24:18,899 --> 03:24:22,299
Plebs can't Jerma Venus, though.

2274
03:24:22,299 --> 03:24:26,379
If they sub, they can. But

2275
03:24:26,379 --> 03:24:29,319
you can Jerma Venus for them.

2276
03:24:29,319 --> 03:24:31,690
Thank you. Skelly

2277
03:24:31,690 --> 03:24:33,690
Boner. Oh, I read that.

2278
03:24:33,690 --> 03:24:37,659
You are, hold on.

2279
03:24:37,659 --> 03:24:39,659
Mr. Picklesworth says, you're honestly a huge inspiration

2280
03:24:39,659 --> 03:24:41,659
in my life. I look up to

2281
03:24:41,659 --> 03:24:43,659
you so much and I truly hope my future turns out

2282
03:24:43,659 --> 03:24:47,239
as good as it has for you.

2283
03:24:47,239 --> 03:24:49,239
You're one of the most genuine and loving people on the entire

2284
03:24:49,239 --> 03:24:51,479
internet. And don't change.

2285
03:24:51,479 --> 03:24:55,319
If you look up to me,

2286
03:24:55,319 --> 03:24:58,010
I hope you can take a couple

2287
03:24:58,010 --> 03:25:00,629
of things. Try your best.

2288
03:25:00,629 --> 03:25:03,940
Try to make as many people happy as you can.

2289
03:25:03,940 --> 03:25:07,850
And be realistic about your goals.

2290
03:25:07,850 --> 03:25:11,670
Try your fucking best.

2291
03:25:11,670 --> 03:25:14,360
Do what you can. And try to make as many people

2292
03:25:14,360 --> 03:25:17,430
happy as you can. You only get one chance.

2293
03:25:17,430 --> 03:25:19,989
You got one life here.

2294
03:25:19,989 --> 03:25:22,680
Try to do your best. Just do your fucking best.

2295
03:25:22,680 --> 03:25:29,020
Obey your thirst.

2296
03:25:29,020 --> 03:25:33,559
Hey, peekaboo in a $5.

2297
03:25:33,559 --> 03:25:35,559
We're blessed to have you. I'm blessed to have you too.

2298
03:25:35,559 --> 03:25:38,120
It's a symbiotic relationship.

2299
03:25:38,120 --> 03:25:42,200
So thank you.

2300
03:25:42,200 --> 03:25:44,200
Mithril Bong. Thanks for $5.10 Mithril.

2301
03:25:44,200 --> 03:25:48,149
And they say,

2302
03:25:48,149 --> 03:25:50,149
Jeremy, you're the man. I just hate

2303
03:25:50,149 --> 03:25:52,149
you a little for doing the ABC's

2304
03:25:52,149 --> 03:25:54,149
bit while I was in the subway

2305
03:25:54,149 --> 03:25:57,290
on the way home from work.

2306
03:25:57,290 --> 03:25:59,290
You can't win them all though. Laughing

2307
03:25:59,290 --> 03:26:01,290
my ass off. Keep it up your 35

2308
03:26:01,290 --> 03:26:03,290
and haven't peaked yet. You'll

2309
03:26:03,290 --> 03:26:05,290
figure something out. I have not even peaked.

2310
03:26:05,290 --> 03:26:07,290
As Dennis Reynolds says,

2311
03:26:07,290 --> 03:26:09,290
I haven't peaked yet. Come on.

2312
03:26:09,290 --> 03:26:11,290
I'll peak when I'm 45.

2313
03:26:11,290 --> 03:26:13,290
You know how much shit is coming up

2314
03:26:13,290 --> 03:26:15,290
in the summertime? You think I've peaked?

2315
03:26:15,290 --> 03:26:17,290
Don't even. Oh my God.

2316
03:26:17,290 --> 03:26:19,290
You have no fucking idea. I'm gonna

2317
03:26:19,290 --> 03:26:21,290
get in a goddamn clown costume. It's in a dunk tank.

2318
03:26:21,290 --> 03:26:23,290
And you guys are gonna control a fucking

2319
03:26:23,290 --> 03:26:25,290
pitching machine to dunk me. You think

2320
03:26:25,290 --> 03:26:27,290
I've peaked? I'll see you in a few months.

2321
03:26:27,290 --> 03:26:29,290
Not even like a few weeks. Fucking

2322
03:26:29,290 --> 03:26:31,290
whatever it is. Oh my God. Are you serious?

2323
03:26:31,290 --> 03:26:34,489
I'm a golden

2324
03:26:34,489 --> 03:26:36,659
goddamn god. Remember

2325
03:26:36,659 --> 03:26:42,739
that. All Mew thanks

2326
03:26:42,739 --> 03:26:44,739
for the three bucks.

2327
03:26:44,739 --> 03:26:46,739
Say it was the suit, Peter.

2328
03:26:46,739 --> 03:26:48,739
It was the goblin so that I can go to bed.

2329
03:26:48,739 --> 03:26:50,979
Hope he can go to bed now.

2330
03:26:54,889 --> 03:26:58,219
Jackatomic.

2331
03:26:58,219 --> 03:27:01,079
Thanks for five bucks.

2332
03:27:01,079 --> 03:27:03,079
Your butterfly effect is insane.

2333
03:27:03,079 --> 03:27:05,319
So many people go through life just hoping

2334
03:27:05,319 --> 03:27:07,319
to make a difference in the world. But you've done

2335
03:27:07,319 --> 03:27:09,319
it. Thousands of people here

2336
03:27:09,319 --> 03:27:11,319
plan our nights around you because you make us

2337
03:27:11,319 --> 03:27:13,319
happy. And it helps us get through

2338
03:27:13,319 --> 03:27:15,690
tough times. You're a gift to humanity

2339
03:27:15,690 --> 03:27:17,690
as a whole and we thank you tremendously.

2340
03:27:17,690 --> 03:27:21,209
Give yourself some credit.

2341
03:27:21,209 --> 03:27:26,649
As they say in Game of Thrones, the night is

2342
03:27:26,649 --> 03:27:29,590
dark and full of terrors. But

2343
03:27:29,590 --> 03:27:32,979
give yourself some credit. Right?

2344
03:27:32,979 --> 03:27:38,170
Minus two games. Come on!

2345
03:27:38,170 --> 03:27:40,170
It's coming back in like a week. Give me that one.

2346
03:27:40,170 --> 03:27:46,440
Thousands of people plan

2347
03:27:46,440 --> 03:27:49,829
their nights around you. But you do

2348
03:27:49,829 --> 03:27:51,829
understand that I plan my nights

2349
03:27:51,829 --> 03:27:53,829
around all of you.

2350
03:27:53,829 --> 03:27:59,319
You know? It goes both

2351
03:27:59,319 --> 03:28:03,030
ways. So

2352
03:28:03,030 --> 03:28:05,030
I plan a lot of my nights

2353
03:28:05,030 --> 03:28:07,530
around you guys. You know?

2354
03:28:07,530 --> 03:28:09,530
I want the streams to be fun. I want you guys

2355
03:28:09,530 --> 03:28:12,090
to have a good time. And if you're saying

2356
03:28:12,090 --> 03:28:14,090
that, it's a complete

2357
03:28:14,090 --> 03:28:16,090
symbiotic. I'm the hippopotamus

2358
03:28:16,090 --> 03:28:18,090
and you're like the hippo bird that

2359
03:28:18,090 --> 03:28:20,090
eats the fucking bugs.

2360
03:28:20,090 --> 03:28:22,520
You know? Or you're the hippo

2361
03:28:22,520 --> 03:28:24,520
and I'm the bird that eats the bugs.

2362
03:28:24,520 --> 03:28:26,520
We're in this together.

2363
03:28:26,520 --> 03:28:29,139
Forever. So don't you ever leave.

2364
03:28:29,139 --> 03:28:33,559
Don't ever leave me. It's kind of

2365
03:28:33,559 --> 03:28:35,559
a bad idea. It's alright.

2366
03:28:35,559 --> 03:28:40,420
I'll see you soon.

2367
03:28:40,420 --> 03:28:42,420
Chat doesn't know. The hippo bird.

2368
03:28:42,420 --> 03:28:44,420
I don't know whatever the bird's

2369
03:28:44,420 --> 03:28:46,420
name is. The hippo birdimus.

2370
03:28:46,420 --> 03:28:51,799
Doesn't matter.

2371
03:28:51,799 --> 03:28:53,799
Streamer forces...

2372
03:28:53,799 --> 03:28:57,450
But if I have a butterfly effect on

2373
03:28:57,450 --> 03:28:59,750
you, I hope you take something positive

2374
03:28:59,750 --> 03:29:02,250
from the stream. We fuck around

2375
03:29:02,250 --> 03:29:04,250
a lot. Look, we fuck around

2376
03:29:04,250 --> 03:29:07,639
all the time. But if

2377
03:29:07,639 --> 03:29:09,639
you take something from the stream and you

2378
03:29:09,639 --> 03:29:11,639
take something, inspiration or

2379
03:29:11,639 --> 03:29:14,260
positivity or

2380
03:29:14,260 --> 03:29:16,260
helpfulness or community,

2381
03:29:16,260 --> 03:29:19,139
it doesn't matter. That's such a

2382
03:29:19,139 --> 03:29:22,219
big fucking deal. When I go

2383
03:29:22,219 --> 03:29:24,579
to bed every night, I will lie

2384
03:29:24,579 --> 03:29:26,579
in my bed. I'll stare

2385
03:29:26,579 --> 03:29:28,579
at the ceiling. And a lot of times

2386
03:29:28,579 --> 03:29:30,579
I just think about

2387
03:29:30,579 --> 03:29:32,579
this world that

2388
03:29:32,579 --> 03:29:34,579
I live in now. And this community.

2389
03:29:34,579 --> 03:29:37,139
And I'm living in Las

2390
03:29:37,139 --> 03:29:39,829
Vegas. In a nice place.

2391
03:29:39,829 --> 03:29:42,010
And what I've

2392
03:29:42,010 --> 03:29:44,489
been given. Right?

2393
03:29:44,489 --> 03:29:46,489
I don't sleep on my back. I fucking think

2394
03:29:46,489 --> 03:29:48,489
on my back. I sleep on my side.

2395
03:29:48,489 --> 03:29:53,540
So whatever you tell me that I've

2396
03:29:53,540 --> 03:29:55,719
given you, always remember

2397
03:29:55,719 --> 03:29:58,979
what you've given me. You give me

2398
03:29:58,979 --> 03:30:00,979
that opportunity to lie on my fucking back in

2399
03:30:00,979 --> 03:30:02,979
Las Vegas and be like, holy, I'm in fucking

2400
03:30:02,979 --> 03:30:06,059
Las Vegas. In like a nice

2401
03:30:06,059 --> 03:30:08,059
place. In a nice area.

2402
03:30:08,059 --> 03:30:10,420
And I fucking can

2403
03:30:10,420 --> 03:30:13,299
pay my rent. I...

2404
03:30:13,299 --> 03:30:15,299
What?

2405
03:30:15,299 --> 03:30:18,500
That's why I take this shit so damn

2406
03:30:18,500 --> 03:30:20,500
seriously. Like I take fun

2407
03:30:20,500 --> 03:30:22,500
and this community so seriously.

2408
03:30:22,500 --> 03:30:26,979
I think about this shit all the goddamn

2409
03:30:26,979 --> 03:30:31,399
time. Paying rent?

2410
03:30:31,399 --> 03:30:33,399
Pogchamp? Yeah. I thought you bought...

2411
03:30:33,399 --> 03:30:36,280
Nah, I don't own in Las Vegas.

2412
03:30:36,280 --> 03:30:39,219
It was too quick.

2413
03:30:39,219 --> 03:30:41,590
Our vessel.

2414
03:30:41,590 --> 03:30:44,600
No, but it's true.

2415
03:30:44,600 --> 03:30:47,860
Think about that. Think about the thousands

2416
03:30:47,860 --> 03:30:49,860
of fucking people. Think about the thousands

2417
03:30:49,860 --> 03:30:51,860
of you that have decided to fucking

2418
03:30:51,860 --> 03:30:53,860
pay money to this stream.

2419
03:30:53,860 --> 03:30:57,059
It's not a joke.

2420
03:30:57,059 --> 03:31:00,379
It's not funny

2421
03:31:00,379 --> 03:31:03,510
to me. It's a lot.

2422
03:31:03,510 --> 03:31:05,510
It's a huge amount

2423
03:31:05,510 --> 03:31:08,649
of people. It's a community

2424
03:31:08,649 --> 03:31:11,020
of people. I can't

2425
03:31:11,020 --> 03:31:13,020
even fucking comprehend sometimes.

2426
03:31:13,020 --> 03:31:18,649
What else do you want me to do with spare cash?

2427
03:31:18,649 --> 03:31:20,649
I just hope you think it's worth it.

2428
03:31:20,649 --> 03:31:27,500
Yeah, I've had a few drinks, but you guys have heard

2429
03:31:27,500 --> 03:31:29,739
this before. I will never change

2430
03:31:29,739 --> 03:31:31,739
my tune on this. Ever.

2431
03:31:31,739 --> 03:31:34,680
Doesn't matter how many subs come into this

2432
03:31:34,680 --> 03:31:36,680
channel. How many bits come into this fucking channel.

2433
03:31:36,680 --> 03:31:38,680
I will never

2434
03:31:38,680 --> 03:31:41,430
change this tune. And if I do,

2435
03:31:41,430 --> 03:31:43,989
tell me about it.

2436
03:31:43,989 --> 03:31:46,940
If I ever change this shit,

2437
03:31:46,940 --> 03:31:49,299
if I ever start acting a different

2438
03:31:49,299 --> 03:31:51,799
fucking way, start acting like

2439
03:31:51,799 --> 03:31:53,799
I deserve this. I deserve something.

2440
03:31:53,799 --> 03:31:55,799
Keep me fucking grounded.

2441
03:31:55,799 --> 03:31:58,420
I hope you do. Because it keeps the community

2442
03:31:58,420 --> 03:32:09,690
fucking churning. Your tune

2443
03:32:09,690 --> 03:32:15,430
is raw.

2444
03:32:15,430 --> 03:32:17,430
You don't strike me as the type. I hope I don't.

2445
03:32:17,430 --> 03:32:21,209
I hope I don't. I hope you guys

2446
03:32:21,209 --> 03:32:23,209
think that I do this because I want to.

2447
03:32:23,209 --> 03:32:25,209
Otherwise, what would I

2448
03:32:25,209 --> 03:32:27,209
stream fucking six, seven days a week?

2449
03:32:27,209 --> 03:32:29,770
Every stream is turned on because I

2450
03:32:29,770 --> 03:32:36,170
want to turn it on. That's all there is

2451
03:32:36,170 --> 03:32:38,170
to it. And it's never

2452
03:32:38,170 --> 03:32:44,059
going to fucking change. Don't ever

2453
03:32:44,059 --> 03:32:47,190
let me change. Five thousand

2454
03:32:47,190 --> 03:32:49,190
subs, ten thousand subs, twenty thousand.

2455
03:32:49,190 --> 03:32:52,649
I don't fucking care.

2456
03:32:52,649 --> 03:32:54,649
Never let the dynamic change.

2457
03:32:54,649 --> 03:32:57,139
Otherwise, I've failed.

2458
03:32:57,139 --> 03:32:59,899
And why I started in the first

2459
03:32:59,899 --> 03:33:02,069
place is moot.

2460
03:33:02,069 --> 03:33:04,500
Don't let me fucking do that.

2461
03:33:04,500 --> 03:33:13,139
I really fucking mean

2462
03:33:13,139 --> 03:33:15,139
that. That's for real. That's actually

2463
03:33:15,139 --> 03:33:17,139
coming out of my...

2464
03:33:17,139 --> 03:33:19,139
We'll turn the camera on.

2465
03:33:19,139 --> 03:33:21,319
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

2466
03:33:21,319 --> 03:33:29,260
Here. Clip this one.

2467
03:33:29,260 --> 03:33:34,309
No.

2468
03:33:34,309 --> 03:33:37,770
Jesus Christ.

2469
03:33:37,770 --> 03:33:41,739
That's all I'm going to say. I'm going to move on from that.

2470
03:33:41,739 --> 03:33:43,739
I know it might be about fucking rambling, but

2471
03:33:43,739 --> 03:33:45,979
drunk man's thoughts are superman's

2472
03:33:45,979 --> 03:33:47,979
thoughts too.

2473
03:33:47,979 --> 03:33:49,979
Because they're the same person. What the hell

2474
03:33:49,979 --> 03:33:51,979
does that even saying mean? You're going to say

2475
03:33:51,979 --> 03:33:54,600
the same goddamn thing.

2476
03:33:54,600 --> 03:33:56,600
Whatever that fucking saying is, you've heard it.

2477
03:33:56,600 --> 03:34:06,500
You look worn out.

2478
03:34:06,500 --> 03:34:08,500
I'm not, though. I'm just fucking

2479
03:34:08,500 --> 03:34:11,319
terrible.

2480
03:34:11,319 --> 03:34:13,319
Thanks for the one dollar.

2481
03:34:13,319 --> 03:34:15,319
I'm not supposed to be reading these.

2482
03:34:15,319 --> 03:34:17,620
I'm not supposed to be reading these.

2483
03:34:17,620 --> 03:34:19,620
But thank you.

2484
03:34:19,620 --> 03:34:21,860
Thanks for five dollars.

2485
03:34:21,860 --> 03:34:23,860
Look, Jerma, I really need you to do me a favor.

2486
03:34:23,860 --> 03:34:25,860
What's the favor?

2487
03:34:25,860 --> 03:34:29,379
You didn't say what the favor was.

2488
03:34:29,379 --> 03:34:31,379
You just gave me five bucks, which is a fucking shitload of money.

2489
03:34:31,379 --> 03:34:33,819
You gave me a five dollar bill.

2490
03:34:33,819 --> 03:34:35,819
I don't know. What's the favor?

2491
03:34:35,819 --> 03:34:39,340
Jerma lied about Steam Legends.

2492
03:34:39,340 --> 03:34:41,340
You never came back. You never came back.

2493
03:34:41,340 --> 03:34:48,309
What do you mean? What did I say?

2494
03:34:48,309 --> 03:34:52,979
I'll come back in an hour and a half and I'll do it.

2495
03:34:52,979 --> 03:34:57,899
I'm going to go eat some food.

2496
03:34:57,899 --> 03:35:01,350
I'll do it in an hour and a half. Do what?

2497
03:35:01,350 --> 03:35:04,489
Do what in an hour and a half?

2498
03:35:04,489 --> 03:35:08,840
I don't know what this means.

2499
03:35:08,840 --> 03:35:12,620
I don't know what I'm lying about.

2500
03:35:12,620 --> 03:35:15,430
What was I supposed to do?

2501
03:35:15,430 --> 03:35:19,340
What was I supposed to do?

2502
03:35:19,340 --> 03:35:21,340
Oh shit!

2503
03:35:21,340 --> 03:35:23,340
The loot! I never came back.

2504
03:35:23,340 --> 03:35:26,409
I never get

2505
03:35:26,409 --> 03:35:28,409
I never came back and gave the loot.

2506
03:35:28,409 --> 03:35:30,969
Oh god.

2507
03:35:30,969 --> 03:35:32,969
Wow, I never did. Holy shit.

2508
03:35:32,969 --> 03:35:34,969
What a terrible person.

2509
03:35:34,969 --> 03:35:37,850
Yeah, I was supposed to do that.

2510
03:35:37,850 --> 03:35:39,850
Oh my god, I'm so scatterbrained.

2511
03:35:39,850 --> 03:35:43,750
I'm so sorry.

2512
03:35:43,750 --> 03:35:48,299
We'll do it tonight.

2513
03:35:48,299 --> 03:35:50,299
Thank you Dorkcube for the 250.

2514
03:35:50,299 --> 03:35:52,299
If you still decide Jermacon is a good idea

2515
03:35:52,299 --> 03:35:54,299
after you leave the VR stupor,

2516
03:35:54,299 --> 03:35:56,299
just be careful how you plan it.

2517
03:35:56,299 --> 03:35:58,299
You have to consider how to handle

2518
03:35:58,299 --> 03:36:00,299
what could possibly be a large group of people

2519
03:36:00,299 --> 03:36:02,299
following you for hours.

2520
03:36:02,299 --> 03:36:04,790
No, that's fine.

2521
03:36:04,790 --> 03:36:07,350
We would go to the Level Up Lounge

2522
03:36:07,350 --> 03:36:10,229
in the MGM casino.

2523
03:36:10,229 --> 03:36:12,659
Beautiful casino. 21 plus.

2524
03:36:12,659 --> 03:36:15,290
I'd make it work.

2525
03:36:15,290 --> 03:36:21,290
It'll be fine. We'll do karaoke.

2526
03:36:21,290 --> 03:36:23,290
I'll sing like fucking Walking in Memphis

2527
03:36:23,290 --> 03:36:27,190
or some dumb shit.

2528
03:36:27,190 --> 03:36:29,370
No, I'm gonna play this by the book.

2529
03:36:29,370 --> 03:36:33,979
So don't worry about that.

2530
03:36:33,979 --> 03:36:35,979
Level! You're so dead set on

2531
03:36:35,979 --> 03:36:37,979
Level Up Lounge. I know

2532
03:36:37,979 --> 03:36:39,979
it sounds sponsored, but it's not.

2533
03:36:39,979 --> 03:36:43,430
The place is just cool.

2534
03:36:43,430 --> 03:36:45,430
It's not gonna be like that.

2535
03:36:45,430 --> 03:36:47,430
Don't compare me. I'm uncomparable.

2536
03:36:47,430 --> 03:36:49,430
I am an uncomparable streamer.

2537
03:36:49,430 --> 03:36:51,430
Do not compare me to other streamers.

2538
03:36:51,430 --> 03:36:53,430
As you can tell by

2539
03:36:53,430 --> 03:36:55,430
my fucking Twitch Docs.

2540
03:36:55,430 --> 03:36:57,430
Let's take a look and see how good they're doing.

2541
03:36:57,430 --> 03:37:01,209
Don't compare me to other streamers.

2542
03:37:01,209 --> 03:37:03,209
Let's see how my Twitch Docs are doing here.

2543
03:37:03,209 --> 03:37:05,209
Let's see. Trending.

2544
03:37:05,209 --> 03:37:07,209
Is German985 currently

2545
03:37:07,209 --> 03:37:09,209
trending? He's not.

2546
03:37:09,209 --> 03:37:11,639
There he is. There he is.

2547
03:37:11,639 --> 03:37:13,639
Okay, a little bit of a dump.

2548
03:37:13,639 --> 03:37:16,649
A little bit of a dump.

2549
03:37:16,649 --> 03:37:18,649
People have sold.

2550
03:37:18,649 --> 03:37:20,649
People have sold a little bit.

2551
03:37:20,649 --> 03:37:22,649
You gotta cool off after

2552
03:37:22,649 --> 03:37:24,649
a big gain like we've seen.

2553
03:37:24,649 --> 03:37:29,260
But yeah, don't worry.

2554
03:37:29,260 --> 03:37:31,260
Whatever the meetup will be.

2555
03:37:31,260 --> 03:37:33,750
It'll be a never...

2556
03:37:33,750 --> 03:37:35,750
Maybe I'll stream it.

2557
03:37:35,750 --> 03:37:38,250
If I can get permission

2558
03:37:38,250 --> 03:37:40,250
from the Level Up Lounge in MGM

2559
03:37:40,250 --> 03:37:43,059
Casino. Maybe I'll stream the whole

2560
03:37:43,059 --> 03:37:45,819
fucking thing. Somebody said

2561
03:37:45,819 --> 03:37:47,819
Jesus, this guy is wasted. No, Vance,

2562
03:37:47,819 --> 03:37:49,819
I'm not. You joined at a weird

2563
03:37:49,819 --> 03:37:51,819
time.

2564
03:37:51,819 --> 03:37:55,979
God damn it. How do I

2565
03:37:55,979 --> 03:37:57,979
tell that person I'm not? How do I tell this person

2566
03:37:57,979 --> 03:38:00,219
I'm not wasted? God damn it.

2567
03:38:00,219 --> 03:38:03,479
I'll see...

2568
03:38:03,479 --> 03:38:06,420
Hey!

2569
03:38:06,420 --> 03:38:08,420
You were right. It's fine. It's okay.

2570
03:38:08,420 --> 03:38:11,180
Mithra Bong, thanks for the

2571
03:38:11,180 --> 03:38:14,700
$5.10. Jeremy,

2572
03:38:14,700 --> 03:38:16,700
you're the man. I just hate you

2573
03:38:16,700 --> 03:38:18,700
a little for doing the ABCs on the

2574
03:38:18,700 --> 03:38:20,700
subway. Oh, we already said

2575
03:38:20,700 --> 03:38:22,700
Mithral, thanks for $5.

2576
03:38:22,700 --> 03:38:28,680
God damn it.

2577
03:38:28,680 --> 03:38:30,680
That guy's right.

2578
03:38:30,680 --> 03:38:33,299
Don't leave, though.

2579
03:38:33,299 --> 03:38:35,299
Did you just get here?

2580
03:38:35,299 --> 03:38:37,540
You know, there's a follow up button. Don't press it

2581
03:38:37,540 --> 03:38:39,540
until you find out you think that it's fun to be here.

2582
03:38:39,540 --> 03:38:41,540
We've got a great community.

2583
03:38:41,540 --> 03:38:43,540
We've got fucking fun people.

2584
03:38:43,540 --> 03:38:45,540
I'm gonna get dunk tank in like a few weeks.

2585
03:38:45,540 --> 03:38:47,540
Just wait till you see me in the dunk tank.

2586
03:38:47,540 --> 03:38:49,540
Twitch can... He's probably already gone.

2587
03:38:49,540 --> 03:38:54,149
Hey, Dork Cube, thanks for the $2.50.

2588
03:38:58,760 --> 03:39:00,760
Hey, Bro Luck,

2589
03:39:00,760 --> 03:39:02,760
thanks for the $5.

2590
03:39:02,760 --> 03:39:04,760
Hey, how many people in your community do you think have

2591
03:39:04,760 --> 03:39:06,760
murdered someone? I don't...

2592
03:39:06,760 --> 03:39:09,129
What the fuck are you talking about?

2593
03:39:09,129 --> 03:39:11,940
I don't... I'm gonna say zero.

2594
03:39:11,940 --> 03:39:14,379
I hope it's zero. Kim

2595
03:39:14,379 --> 03:39:16,379
Dang, Kim Dang,

2596
03:39:16,379 --> 03:39:18,739
22 minutes ago,

2597
03:39:18,739 --> 03:39:20,739
my girlfriend just sent

2598
03:39:20,739 --> 03:39:22,739
$5 in bits to this

2599
03:39:22,739 --> 03:39:24,979
channel. Why are you doing that?

2600
03:39:24,979 --> 03:39:26,979
Please eat your food

2601
03:39:26,979 --> 03:39:29,219
downstairs. Oh, God.

2602
03:39:29,219 --> 03:39:34,010
Okay. I'll be down in a minute.

2603
03:39:34,010 --> 03:39:38,739
Uh, only...

2604
03:39:38,739 --> 03:39:41,940
Let's get the... Oh, Kim,

2605
03:39:41,940 --> 03:39:43,940
you're the best. Here come

2606
03:39:43,940 --> 03:39:46,700
the credits. That's a lot

2607
03:39:46,700 --> 03:39:49,260
of subs. Thank you, everybody.

2608
03:39:49,260 --> 03:39:52,010
For this like dumb shitty

2609
03:39:52,010 --> 03:39:54,010
drunk VR, German complaints about

2610
03:39:54,010 --> 03:39:56,440
technology stream. I'm

2611
03:39:56,440 --> 03:39:58,440
watching from jail. I hope you get out soon.

2612
03:39:58,440 --> 03:40:01,510
That's a lot of subs.

2613
03:40:01,510 --> 03:40:03,510
Lightspeed subs and

2614
03:40:03,510 --> 03:40:06,010
Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $2.50.

2615
03:40:06,010 --> 03:40:08,010
I have to wake up early

2616
03:40:08,010 --> 03:40:10,010
tomorrow, but it's worth

2617
03:40:10,010 --> 03:40:12,010
staying up to hear you talk. Love the

2618
03:40:12,010 --> 03:40:16,360
stream, everything you do. Thank you,

2619
03:40:16,360 --> 03:40:19,610
Clueless Sniper. You're

2620
03:40:19,610 --> 03:40:21,610
a fucking huge part of this community. Thank you.

2621
03:40:21,610 --> 03:40:24,870
Thank you, Jesse. You got up at $2.50.

2622
03:40:24,870 --> 03:40:26,870
What if you do that same height party

2623
03:40:26,870 --> 03:40:28,870
thing where everyone gets a pair of shoes to

2624
03:40:28,870 --> 03:40:31,180
bring them all up to the

2625
03:40:31,180 --> 03:40:33,180
same height? I'm 5'8". I don't give a fuck.

2626
03:40:33,180 --> 03:40:35,739
Dorkcube, thanks for the $2.50.

2627
03:40:35,739 --> 03:40:37,739
I kid you not,

2628
03:40:37,739 --> 03:40:39,739
I have watched this clip at least once

2629
03:40:39,739 --> 03:40:41,739
every single day since it happened.

2630
03:40:41,739 --> 03:40:44,100
What is this?

2631
03:40:44,100 --> 03:40:56,200
You watch this every day.

2632
03:40:56,200 --> 03:41:04,459
What a joke.

2633
03:41:14,739 --> 03:41:17,559
I fucking love the internet.

2634
03:41:21,379 --> 03:41:23,379
Hey, welcome to the stream. If that person is still here,

2635
03:41:23,379 --> 03:41:25,379
I hope you followed. If you didn't, then

2636
03:41:25,379 --> 03:41:27,690
hopefully we see you soon.

2637
03:41:27,690 --> 03:41:31,319
Take care of yourself.

2638
03:41:31,319 --> 03:41:33,319
Hey, I just joined for the first time. Well, then

2639
03:41:33,319 --> 03:41:36,010
I'm glad.

2640
03:41:38,500 --> 03:41:40,500
I can't believe I lost like fucking a thousand people

2641
03:41:40,500 --> 03:41:42,500
during that like singing thing.

2642
03:41:42,500 --> 03:41:44,500
I'm going to look at that clip tomorrow,

2643
03:41:44,500 --> 03:41:46,500
that stream tomorrow, and be like, ugh,

2644
03:41:46,500 --> 03:41:49,829
what the fuck was I doing?

2645
03:41:49,829 --> 03:41:52,709
Who cares?

2646
03:41:52,709 --> 03:41:54,709
Whatever. Fuck it, it's all a good fun.

2647
03:41:54,709 --> 03:41:57,530
He hates his new viewers. What?

2648
03:41:57,530 --> 03:42:00,409
Post the fight.

2649
03:42:00,409 --> 03:42:02,899
Ugh.

2650
03:42:02,899 --> 03:42:04,899
I may have turned away a few people today.

2651
03:42:07,979 --> 03:42:12,649
If you're one of the people that stayed

2652
03:42:12,649 --> 03:42:14,649
after all that, hey,

2653
03:42:14,649 --> 03:42:16,649
some of the best fucking TwitchTV content

2654
03:42:16,649 --> 03:42:19,459
you could find.

2655
03:42:19,459 --> 03:42:21,459
A fucking 5.8 troll

2656
03:42:21,459 --> 03:42:23,459
screams at bad technology

2657
03:42:23,459 --> 03:42:25,459
and gets mad at bugs in games

2658
03:42:25,459 --> 03:42:27,459
and it makes a cringey fucking

2659
03:42:27,459 --> 03:42:29,459
13 second bit.

2660
03:42:29,459 --> 03:42:34,950
Hope you had fun.

2661
03:42:34,950 --> 03:42:38,540
And finally,

2662
03:42:38,540 --> 03:42:40,840
Frostro, thanks to the five bucks.

2663
03:42:40,840 --> 03:42:44,489
Jerma is a measured

2664
03:42:44,489 --> 03:42:46,489
experience, not a single stream that

2665
03:42:46,489 --> 03:42:48,489
lost some viewers.

2666
03:42:48,489 --> 03:42:52,059
Oh.

2667
03:42:52,059 --> 03:42:54,059
You guys are too much. Thank you so much, everybody.

2668
03:42:54,059 --> 03:42:56,870
5,000, 2,000, 10,000,

2669
03:42:56,870 --> 03:42:58,870
40,000, fucking 200.

2670
03:42:58,870 --> 03:43:01,690
I don't give a fuck.

2671
03:43:01,690 --> 03:43:03,690
If you thought it was fun, I'm glad.

2672
03:43:03,690 --> 03:43:05,860
Thank you. What a fucking blast.

2673
03:43:05,860 --> 03:43:07,860
I loved it. Tonight was great.

2674
03:43:07,860 --> 03:43:10,100
Thank you, everybody. I'll see you all

2675
03:43:10,100 --> 03:43:12,100
soon. I can't, I mean I'm supposed to stream

2676
03:43:12,100 --> 03:43:14,469
tomorrow, but I might wake up

2677
03:43:14,469 --> 03:43:16,469
with a hangover and then we're going to have

2678
03:43:16,469 --> 03:43:18,469
to, we'll see.

2679
03:43:18,469 --> 03:43:20,469
I don't know. I love you.

2680
03:43:20,469 --> 03:43:22,469
I'll see you guys fucking real soon.

2681
03:43:22,469 --> 03:43:25,930
Whenever that may be, in the next day or two.

2682
03:43:25,930 --> 03:43:28,299
Lots of water. I will.

2683
03:43:28,299 --> 03:43:30,299
Take care. Have a great one.

2684
03:43:30,299 --> 03:43:51,739
Oh god, I forgot about the stream

2685
03:43:51,739 --> 03:43:53,739
legends, you're right. Keep me honest.

2686
03:43:53,739 --> 03:43:56,040
Hold on.

2687
03:43:56,040 --> 03:43:58,040
I'll get it this way. I'll get it.

2688
03:43:58,040 --> 03:44:00,979
I'll get it. I'll get you.

2689
03:44:00,979 --> 03:44:09,879
I got you guys, don't worry. Hold on.

2690
03:44:09,879 --> 03:44:12,629
There it goes.

2691
03:44:12,629 --> 03:44:15,500
Stream legends.

2692
03:44:15,500 --> 03:44:17,989
Open it up if you have it.

2693
03:44:17,989 --> 03:44:19,989
If you play it. It's just a little

2694
03:44:19,989 --> 03:44:21,989
fun thing to have down there. It's free.

2695
03:44:21,989 --> 03:44:23,989
You don't have to pay anything.

2696
03:44:23,989 --> 03:44:33,209
It's just there.

2697
03:44:33,209 --> 03:44:36,899
Here we go. I will see you guys

2698
03:44:36,899 --> 03:44:39,399
real soon. What?

2699
03:44:39,399 --> 03:44:42,649
What the hell did I just do? Oh there we go.

2700
03:44:42,649 --> 03:44:44,649
Three, two, one.

2701
03:44:44,649 --> 03:44:46,649
Gifts gone out. Hope you got something good.

2702
03:44:46,649 --> 03:44:49,979
See you tomorrow

2703
03:44:49,979 --> 03:44:51,979
or maybe the next day if I

2704
03:44:51,979 --> 03:44:54,860
wake up with a hangover and then I might

2705
03:44:54,860 --> 03:44:57,670
have to go the next day. Ace Attorney's

2706
03:44:57,670 --> 03:44:59,670
out, that's true, but ah

2707
03:44:59,670 --> 03:45:03,319
how much VR? Ah, we'll see.

2708
03:45:03,319 --> 03:45:05,559
See you soon. Take care guys.

2709
03:45:05,559 --> 03:45:09,379
As always, have a

2710
03:45:09,379 --> 03:45:11,379
great day.
