1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:09,910
Let's do it.

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:16,070
Four, six, five, six, seven people on B now.

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,760
That's a lot of people.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,829
Ooh, this is a good place to do this.

5
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:23,829
This is a good place to do this.

6
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:25,829
Can I get another one?

7
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:28,260
Oh!

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,500
Can I get another one?

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
I will get somebody.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Oh, I'm just slowly taking out your whole team.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Somebody's on C!

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,189
What? Somebody's on C!

13
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:43,619
Somebody get back there and get that...I gotta get back there.

14
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,310
Nice job. Beautiful.

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,310
Beautiful air blast. He's gonna walk right into this.

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,240
Where are ya?

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,759
Oh, there you are.

18
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,759
Damn it, I'm so awful!

19
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,759
Oh, now I'm just freaking out.

20
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:02,280
Now I'm just freaking out.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,519
Holy jeez, I am totally freaking out.

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,519
I'm freaking out! I'm totally freaking out right now.

23
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:10,599
I'm freaking out!

24
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:13,219
I gotta piss.

25
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,219
I gotta pee so bad right now? Is that the problem?

26
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:17,219
Who is on this point? There's nobody on the point.

27
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:19,219
Where is this guy?

28
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:22,170
What the fuck? It was a pyro?

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,170
No, I'm not allowed to pee.

30
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,170
I'm not allowed to go pee yet until I win a round.

31
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,790
That's the punishment for me just like

32
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,790
whiffing on like nine arrows in a row.

33
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,349
Do it for the camera. Go...

34
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:35,349
Yeah! Nice. Good spin, bro.

35
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:37,349
Do it again. One more time.

36
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:39,349
One more time for the camera. Just for the camera.

37
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,349
For the camera. Come on. You got a camera point at me.

38
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:43,349
I got a camera point at you.

39
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:45,349
We're both...

40
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:47,719
Let's make this quick.

41
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,719
Because seriously, I'm going to piss my fucking pants.

42
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,480
Go to A first.

43
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,480
And Scout just kind of standing there.

44
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,040
He'll go down. Make it nice and easy.

45
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,920
Nice and quick.

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,480
Just like my old pancake recipe.

47
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,780
See, what you gotta do is you gotta do twigs.

48
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,280
No, don't worry. I'm not going to do that joke again.

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,030
That joke is going to be buried forever.

50
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,030
Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.

51
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,270
Scout, turn. Turn around, Scout.

52
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,349
Where is he? What?

53
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,349
What kind of fucked up magic trick was that?

54
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,229
Now I'm going to burn.

55
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,789
Do you have any milk? Got milk?

56
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:29,659
Hey, got milk?

57
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,659
I really am going to burn though.

58
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:34,090
Like, I really am going to burn. This is a stupid idea.

59
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,090
Hey, got milk?

60
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,090
Hey, need some milk?

61
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,900
At least the Scout is going to get it.

62
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,210
Come on, Scout. Get it.

63
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:51,289
Why is nobody pushing B?

64
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:53,289
They got a sentry? Is that the issue?

65
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,659
Nice dodge. I'll accept it.

66
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:58,520
I'll accept that dodge for what it was.

67
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,680
No, no. Fuck you.

68
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,300
I ain't going to die right there.

69
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:10,729
No!

70
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,729
Scramble the teams. No, I gotta pee.

71
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:17,659
Do not scramble the teams. I've got to piss.

72
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:22,710
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

73
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,020
Stack every single person on A.

74
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,020
Here comes a spy. He's not going to do anything

75
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,409
because there's like 12 of us here.

76
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:32,650
Just cap it. Nothing spooky.

77
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,650
Nothing fancy. Nothing...what?

78
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,979
How did you...

79
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:42,819
How did he get...

80
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,819
Okay, we're still...

81
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,319
No, that's a crit. Where are these people?

82
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,780
Come on up. Come on up. Yeah.

83
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,169
Come on up. I ain't losing this.

84
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:58,699
Get A. Please get A. We got it.

85
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,699
Three, two, one.

86
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,699
Beautiful. Let's move on.

87
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,520
Jerma's gotta pee.

88
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
He is going to piss his pants if we don't

89
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,490
hurry this up.

90
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,490
Where'd he go? He's dead.

91
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,819
Why am I...what am I doing at C? I'm like skipping.

92
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:19,819
I'm skipping B because I have to pee so bad.

93
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:23,209
Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.

94
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:26,730

96
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,779
Look at the balls.

97
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,779
Stop caring about that shit.

98
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,089
Just get the kill.

99
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:40,250
Get rid of that thing. Everybody get on B.

100
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,939

I'm going to pee out of my esophagus in about 30 seconds.
