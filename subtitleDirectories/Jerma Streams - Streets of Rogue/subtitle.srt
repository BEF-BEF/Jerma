00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:13,210
Good afternoon, everybody. Hi, I'm there the transmission works. I'm able to transmit data

2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,019
through a wire

3
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,660
Into your house. How are you?

4
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:25,460
Unfortunately, it's not perfect. Oh

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,670
Oh, I feel it. I could feel it. Our internet was

6
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,109
fixed in quotes

7
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:38,140
and what that means is it's not fixed and it's

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
It's they're working on it

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,840
They did something they screwed something up and they're trying to fix it. But unfortunately for us

10
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,270
We have to deal with it

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,659
Hopefully does not drop that many times

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,399
Hopefully doesn't drop to zero

13
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:05,959
But I I gotta try right? I can't just like oh bye. See you later guys. I'll see you in like three weeks

14
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:09,959
I've got to try and

15
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:14,420
this is what this stream is we're gonna try and

16
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:21,370
And

17
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,810
It's Alex and I because it talks is having this problem too because he also lives here. We've been running

18
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:29,510
full twitch tests

19
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,829
You didn't know twitch has test servers that you can just stream to and it's a pretend fake stream

20
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,670
and we've been doing this for about two straight days now and

21
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,709
The problem is way less evident than it was

22
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:49,310
Three or four days ago, but with anything who has any idea?

23
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,469
What may have seemed okay

24
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,790
Yesterday for the whole day with a few drops here and there it was like, alright, we get a whole day of green

25
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:04,469
Let's go. I'm going for it. And that's what this stream is. And then right when we turn it on, of course it's problems, but

26
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:11,020
What do you say we talk about since it's been a while? It's been like five six days since I last streamed

27
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,740
That was not my intention

28
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,340
But a couple of things happened if you didn't see I tried to keep some of it a secret over the weekend

29
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,699
I was part of the vinesauces. Hope

30
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:28,060
Joel's vine wrestle segment. I invaded

31
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:36,500
Jerma Jerma wrestling Federation invaded vine wrestle. I didn't really talk about it because I wanted they wanted to be a surprise

32
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:38,580
so I didn't really

33
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:46,060
Say much about it, but I won't give you any spoilers, but if you haven't seen it, I recommend it

34
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:55,620
Hyphus crossover. That was a lot of fun. And although I wasn't able to stream on my own channel

35
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:59,620
I was able to participate in that and it was awesome for a great cause. They do that every year and

36
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,419
I'm just happy to participate

37
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,340
But yeah, I did that. We've also got a couple of ideas

38
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:13,939
for the future and

39
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:15,979
what I mean by that is

40
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,270
in the future in like

41
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,340
Don't do this to me. Come on. It was green fucking for the last like

42
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,039
15 hours

43
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,039
Come on

44
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,319
You got you got to give this to me it's been too long you got to give this to me

45
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:40,990
It's trying

46
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:49,300
But anyways, I'm just I'm just looking over here at the like drop frames. I'm just like no, no, please don't do this to me

47
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:57,199
Please I just want to stream. I just want to turn off my live stream. I don't know what they did but

48
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,909
Besides the carnival stream we're just gonna sit here and talk for a minute because

49
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,750
It's been a while. So besides that carnival stream, which is coming up in probably late September

50
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:16,769
There's another stream that I want to do that would be really fun and it involves the idea that we talked about

51
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,009
the where's Waldo stream where

52
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:28,449
Somebody or people come together as a community. They make up some fun slides where I have to find on the stream me

53
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,209
green screen cutout on stream

54
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,930
now

55
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,610
That sounds like a lot of fun

56
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,649
but then I thought about you know, what would be better instead of it just being a

57
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:47,129
Segment where oh, I'm gonna do like 30. Where's Waldo slides. No, I'm gonna do on this stream

58
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:51,290
I will give you it will once I get everything set in stone. They're probably in a few weeks

59
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:57,449
I want to do an entire highlights magazine stream. I'm talking dot-to-dots

60
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:04,829
Hidden objects where's Waldo coloring book section if you remember those magazines they were ridiculous

61
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,120
I want to have like a ask the editor section where people ask me things

62
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,639
It's gonna be a whole highlights magazine

63
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:20,180
Now this is sounds like it might be hard to do but it won't be it actually would probably pretty easy

64
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,300
so that where's Waldo idea sort of evolved into this and

65
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,079
I would say at some point next week

66
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,899
I'm gonna get some hard details down and we will have like submissions

67
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,939
For this stuff because I'm gonna do some stuff too

68
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:46,329
I want to I want to like hire out some people to make some crazy shit make a print

69
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:48,329
Yeah, I want it to be like an actual

70
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,500
Like book at least mine at least I want to do that on stream

71
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
But then it actually might be better if it was all digital

72
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,199
I'll come up with all the other the hard stuff here, but that will happen probably in the next few weeks

73
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,439
So I want to give at least a couple weeks for people to submit stuff. So next week we'll give some deadlines there

74
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:16,579
But that would be fun to do. There's like a jokes, but they had a joke section in highlights magazine

75
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:20,470
So I want I want you guys to submit your best jokes that I'm gonna read them on stream

76
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:32,680
It's just gonna be all copypastas more lifelines the minus two section

77
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:40,360
It's gonna be the same coffee pasta will there be a cereal stream

78
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,519
Um, I thought about the cereal strip, but his thing about a cereal stream

79
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:53,259
That's kind of it. You open up the boxes of cereal you eat the cereal and then what?

80
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,029
That's it. What are you? What am I?

81
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,459
That is like I would classify eating cereal on stream as

82
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:04,850
like

83
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:10,870
Let's say there's like a content layer content level from zero to a hundred. That's like a four

84
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,209
Sleeping on stream is probably like a two

85
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,879
Streaming a black screen is a one

86
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:25,870
You know I'm saying so that you're only like two or three notches over streaming a black screen with no with muted

87
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:35,279
So, I mean maybe I would it might be fun but I think that would I would want there to be a segment of a bigger stream

88
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:48,810
Zero is you're not live. Yeah, but anyways, we're gonna play streets of rogue, which is a rogue like a game

89
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:54,389
But it's also a kind of an adventure game too could be a bunch of other stuff

90
00:07:54,389 --> 00:08:00,709
How would you know you've never played it neither of I what's a 100? Oh

91
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:08,009
Carnival stream that's I mean if you were to make a carnival with twitch controlled robots that play

92
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:15,569
Games on stream like at least at least like three four five of these games on stream and like clowns

93
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:25,480
I would say that would probably be somewhere around a hundred. I think that's my barometer

94
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,949
anyways

95
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:29,930
There's also a

96
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:41,580
There's also a twitch integration in this game. I have no idea how the hell this works, but let's see. Hey, there it is

97
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,980
streets of rogue

98
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,980
Kind of wanted to come back

99
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
soft today

100
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,080
Because obviously I I don't know how it I'm

101
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,059
Essentially, I've got a blindfold on I have no idea what's gonna happen with the internet

102
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:01,100
All I know is that it's on and I'm turning I turned it on and here we are

103
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,340
So there's no going back now unless they turn it off and then that case it's off and we went back

104
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:16,710
But that's kind of the the state of the update. Let's try it streets of rogue. Here we go

105
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:27,429
And the guy below me, why would I do that? I'll be green. We're green. I think I'm ready

106
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:33,019
Elected on vague promises of lower taxes more beer is true color things showed me the art

107
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:38,620
Okay, this is like the tutorial what happened before this?

108
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,919
Elected on vague promises of lower taxes and more beer

109
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,659
Okay

110
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:51,139
The whole camp the mayor's first executive order were a massive raise on taxes and a one-time confiscation of all

111
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,179
alcoholic beverages

112
00:09:53,179 --> 00:10:01,500
He stated that the confiscation was so he could throw the mother of all ragers for his constituents

113
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:09,070
Okay, but in reality there was only like one keg and a bag of torture. I listen

114
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:14,509
I like this. Yeah, it's already a full letter grade. But in reality, there was only like one keg

115
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:22,340
I like that. It was super lame. All right now bring it back down full letter grade

116
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,100
I don't like this part

117
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,720
He used the money an extra boost to fund a private army of goons

118
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,309
Happy to carry out his every nefarious bidding before along the city had fallen into a state of chaos

119
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:39,600
But there is still hope a secretive organization

120
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:44,840
Organization known only as the resistance has been formed to fight back against the mayor's tyrannical leadership

121
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,809
And that is where our tale begins. It's time to embark on your journey into the

122
00:10:50,389 --> 00:11:05,590
Streets of Rome, baby. So you want to join the resistance? Hey, well, there's something you should know our standards are for entry

123
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,700
I'm extremely hot. I'd offer where you've been hurt in my eyes. You know, that's very fair farm

124
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:17,639
The first task is move around use WASD. Holy crap. You did it. I'll open that door by pressing the E button

125
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,679
Which one II?

126
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,679
No way. No way. This is the farthest anyone's gotten in a long time

127
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,919
I left a little something for you in that chest. Can you figure out what to do next? This music's pretty good

128
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,100
II

129
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,940
Okay, so that's a lockpick pick any lock just don't expect the owner of said lock to appreciate it

130
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,110
Wow. Oh my god

131
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:49,549
Haha, but but there's no way that you could possibly figure out what to do with that thing. Oh

132
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,350
Haha. Oh god. I

133
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,230
got a

134
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,230
lock door here

135
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:01,309
Use lockpick just one

136
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:07,240
Whatever click it. Yeah. Holy crap. Holy crap

137
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:18,669
Why oh no, he spontaneously exploded

138
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:23,659
I'm so sorry you had to see that on the plus side you must be doing pretty well so far for him to get that

139
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:29,470
Excited he had a lot of emotional problems. Anyways, no use moping around. I'll take over from here

140
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:36,429
He's gonna explode too. Just watch I'm teleporting you some money use it to buy a hacking tool from our staff shopkeeper

141
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:41,769
50 bucks

142
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,980
Staff shopkeeper as you oops

143
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:51,779
What are you buying I'm buying

144
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,960
hacking tool

145
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,759
Jesus

146
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,320
Single-use device that will hack into any computer remotely

147
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:04,159
Okay, and he didn't explode. Oh, he will

148
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,820
Access your inventory by pressing Q

149
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:11,259
Then right click the hacking tool to select it and left click the computer

150
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,070
Which computer that one?

151
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:17,470
So right click to use and then click on the computer

152
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,500
Try to do from that far away

153
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:30,100
Open locked doors read email. That would be rude. Ah, you're right. It'll be pretty rude. Yeah, I don't do it

154
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:38,539
Try it again. Okay, open locked doors. I got it. Okay. Sorry. Good dad

155
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,820
This is as fast as I can move. What's E entrance?

156
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:45,179
Alright, so I'm at the computer

157
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,139
I'm gonna send you on a little trial mission to see what it is. Press tab

158
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:56,220
Destroy the generator which is up here. So I gotta go left up right up right down. Okay

159
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:01,580

Can I punch the computer? Yeah, but I don't want to break it

162
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:11,009
Should I break the bed?

163
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:16,950
Someone is on guard duty in the building past this fence to see more info hold space

164
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,220
Hostile, it looks like he won't be too happy to see you. And by the way, if someone's name is yellow

165
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,379
It means they own the property

166
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:32,460

00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:01,279
Meet our staff bouncer. He'll be playing the part of bad guy, but he's been interested instructed not to fight back under any circumstance

173
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,179
Hello, nice to make your acquaintance rookie. Feel free to wail on him as hard as you can. He's a big guy. He can take it

174
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,580
Excuse me, but I don't recall agreeing to this when you sign your resistance paperwork

175
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:18,740
Perhaps you'll recall section 7c which states members are subject to any and all of the resistance leaders illogical dangerous and are sadistic whims

176
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,179
Look, you have no right to allow some random guy off the street to take shots at me for the sake of some what you call

See, okay

188
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:05,679
How many do I have to shoot him with? I did way too many. I just over tranquilized him

189
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,039
I got the key to the base

190
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:15,519
Okay, do you see that blue meter at the top of your screen you'll get skill points for things like murdering and lockpicking, okay

Is it really why does it have to be a bacon cheeseburger?

196
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:57,649

200
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,980
What is it a rock? He's raw rocks people

Holy shit, I can throw rocks at people. All right, this game just got way better

203
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:33,990
You mean I'm wet. Why am I wet? I have no way to open this

204
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:40,130

I mean, that's not very useful at all. Is it check out on your stats screen press R

211
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,960
Nobody liked the Waluigi scream. I thought like wait, wait, hold on

212
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,559
Maybe are we on the internet because I always thought that if you say the word Waluigi or do

213
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,519
W-A-H-H you automatically are way cooler of a person

214
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,359

00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,630
Well, all right. I'm gonna have to remember that

216
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:27,599
Damn. All right. Well, I apologize about that. I thought that I thought that Waluigi Wow was still like automatically

00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:36,140
Special ability where is it cry profusely cause you to cry like a little baby

219
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:40,460
Serves no purpose except to embarrass you. Okay. Well, I did get embarrassed

220
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:44,049
It worked it worked you working as intended

221
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,180
Here's a key. Oh, whoops

222
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,220
I just accidentally teleported into the elevator where you first came in open your mission screen with tab

223
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,339
Then you can look at the entrance to teleport to the entrance. Oh, that's cool

224
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:07,710
Once you grab the key, you can quick teleport by pressing left control under normal circumstances. This will teleport you to important locations

225
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,779
All right

226
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,980
Destroy that generator to complete your mission. You got it

227
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,920
I

228
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:24,000
Can't throw rocks at it, unfortunately, I can't do that. How do I do it? I punch it. I

229
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:30,559
Don't think I would ever hit like a space heater with a baseball bat. That's probably a bad idea. It's gonna blow up

230
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:38,460
Tutorial done all you knew to get out of the way. You're no fun

231
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:44,940
Anyway, sorry for all the hazing. You're pretty tough cookie. We only lost one person during this exercise. That's a new record who?

232
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,940
Congratulations, you can join speak to the doctor when you get in we'll see about getting you another bacon cheeseburger

233
00:19:53,160 --> 00:20:02,240
I'm in a home base. Oh the first guy right the guy that exploded, but I thought that was like a magician thing

234
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:21,079
You missed a rock. Is there like a go pee? Oh god his free points his free comedy points if I can do that

235
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:30,190
Get out of here. This is not the doctor. This is the

236
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:33,829
Okay, I

237
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:35,549
Don't know why I

238
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:47,279
Was the first person I saw in a room. I look okay. I knew that was a toilet, but this could be I know I'm fucking stupid

239
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:53,059
So I have a few other things to let you know before we send you out on the suicide men

240
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:55,500
Oh completely achieved mission of taking down the mayor

241
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:02,380
Since you're new to the city, you should know that it's built in vertical layers like a lasagna. I fucking hate lasagna

242
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:08,440
slums at the bottom then the industrial area then the faux outdoor park downtown and uptown at the top

243
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,559
The only way to get from one level to nexus through the elevator

244
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:18,609
In addition to your primary mission won't you do a bunch of other stuff too. They'll be highlighted on your map like that generator

245
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:20,210
You just blew up

246
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,670
You'll need to finish your missions on a floor before you can travel to the next one

247
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:29,769
Resistance leaders like myself will help you out by sending you rewards for completing these missions

248
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:35,259
But that's about all we can do for you. We're less doers in more idea

249
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:39,140
Why am I doing like the person in line at Disney World to monitor that you walk by

250
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,299
I'm like that actor that is on the screen. I'm gonna slow down here

251
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:46,460
For example, it was my idea to send you out on this mission

252
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:53,940
So do me proud because they might be a promotion in it for me as you may know the mayor has banned chicken nuggets

253
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:57,059
Due to the fact that they once caused him a mild tummy ache

254
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,059
Wait, did you ban chicken nuggets?

255
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:06,509
Chicken nuggets have since become a rare and precious commodity

256
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:13,059
Re if you can scrounge up some chicken nuggets

257
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,660
We can trade him for things that can help you out

258
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:21,539
The doctor the thief and the soldier can brief you a bit more on the nugget situation

259
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,470
Or if you want to be heading the city the elevators to your north. Good luck to you young road. Oh

260
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:33,430
By the way, stay out of the occupied restrooms that kind of activity embarrasses the resistance more than it does you

261
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,250
What a callback. All right, so I can what's in here a fridge

262

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,569
Can I steal from my own self?

264
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:51,130
Well, if you that's doesn't make any sense if you steal from yourself, it's just yours

265
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,180
What about the fridge?

266
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:04,190
Trash, it's just mine. I would be taking an item from one place and putting it in another place in my house

267
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:13,259

00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,460
So I put like that protection on

276
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,380

I ain't gonna fuck that up safe combination. Oh

714
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,180
32 bucks that's that was worth it

715
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:29,619

720
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,600
I just have to destroy this and then i'm done

721
01:13:51,920 --> 01:14:04,539
This is a computer over here. I need to know what in the name of god

722
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:09,090

Full health there it is finally. All right, give me the shotgun

726
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:27,760
Let's go up front here. Nothing else, right? This is safe

727
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:35,520

728
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,520
No, it's not worth it. I'm going

729
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,359
Is it worth it? No

730
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:47,920
So what does the green and blue mean? Does that mean it's a rarer?

731
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:50,539
perk

732
01:14:50,539 --> 01:14:53,659
How does that work?

733
01:14:53,659 --> 01:14:56,220
Health gradually regenerates when below 40. That's really good

734
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:03,020
Increase this attribute is just melee. Okay followers gain extra health

735
01:15:03,579 --> 01:15:06,779
The plus means it's an upgrade. Okay

01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:51,810
I have it set every every like 20 minutes. I have it set to like cause a problem

809
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:55,170
My internet I have it make it so it shuts it off

810
01:22:57,069 --> 01:23:01,229
Uh, all right, let's get the safe and let's do this first. Is there anything quiet?

811
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:07,840
Not really

812
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:12,029
Another generator where

813
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:18,399
Can you turn that off so we can watch? Oh, there's a dis twitch integration in this game

814
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:21,310
I just have to turn it on

815
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:30,430
I don't know what it does. I want to do a few rounds where I just got familiar with the game

816
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:32,510
So maybe we can add some stuff

817
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:35,489
All right. So next thing I need to do is where's the uh

818
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,899
One more generator, but should I even be doing this?

819
01:23:40,779 --> 01:23:44,510
All right, there we go. Sellomatic. That's what I want

820
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:52,909
Chat picks the perks for you at the end of floors. All right, that's kind of cool

821
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:57,380
Touch me

822
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,619
All right. I'm gonna get rid of the

823
01:23:59,619 --> 01:24:04,420

824
01:24:04,579 --> 01:24:07,840
I'm gonna keep the sandwich. I'm gonna get rid of the

825
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:10,479

baseball bat police baton

827
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:19,979
This thing's expensive

828
01:24:19,979 --> 01:24:21,500
hacking tool

829
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:24,189
I don't know. I just don't know what's good

830
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:27,890
All right, i'm gonna get rid of the knife

831
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:32,029
Get rid of the machine gun, maybe

832
01:24:36,289 --> 01:24:41,729
I'm not using the landmines at all

833
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:49,500
Oh, well, I don't know streamer actively avoids twitch mode to ignore his viewers

834
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:54,590
Well, wouldn't that be not ignoring you guys?

835
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:58,850
Isn't me turning on the twitch mode?

836
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:01,390
engaging with you guys

837
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:05,539
Isn't that what that means?

838
01:25:05,539 --> 01:25:08,020
All right. I need to do this. I gotta go in here and have to

839
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:14,430
Turn all the switches off

840
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:18,430
And when I say no, I mean the next building up never mind. I'm not supposed to be in here. Why?

841
01:25:22,819 --> 01:25:24,020
There we go

842
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:29,550
Who's in here? We got goon two goons one goon

843
01:25:30,189 --> 01:25:37,069
What is that?

844
01:25:37,069 --> 01:25:38,029
tube

845
01:25:38,029 --> 01:25:42,510
I'm gonna say i'm gonna go up and then down

846
01:25:42,829 --> 01:25:45,409
What is he coming to?

847
01:25:45,409 --> 01:25:50,979
Turn this back on

848
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,979
Oh, you can fall down there

849
01:26:05,149 --> 01:26:10,210
Read emails out of the way

850
01:26:10,689 --> 01:26:12,689
All right, how close am I to leveling up? I don't need to heal

851
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:18,300
More switches the workers come and turn them back on

852
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:25,840
Free check. I gotta do go back home and get some chicken nugget on upgrades

853
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,840
I'm going this way

854
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,350
It'll be easier to turn that off without causing a problem

855
01:26:42,689 --> 01:26:45,180
Got it hard hat floor clear

856
01:26:45,979 --> 01:26:53,039
Let's get out. Although is there anything else I want to do?

857
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,460
I could destroy that

858
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,479
Should I?

859
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:02,640
Yeah, I okay. I failed the total mission. Does that mean I shouldn't even do this at all?

860
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:07,409
I failed everything didn't I?

861
01:27:09,779 --> 01:27:11,939
So is me doing this actually do anything?

862
01:27:12,579 --> 01:27:24,140
Am I just wasting time right here? It's already filled right? Yeah, there's no point

863
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:29,180
Well, i'm already down here. So might as well just do it right? I'm like already here

864
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:36,859
How big is this explosion?

865
01:27:36,859 --> 01:27:39,739
This looks like it's gonna be pretty big

866
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:53,060
It is an overloaded generator. All right, that's good. Let's get out here

867
01:27:57,539 --> 01:28:01,569
I unlock jock

868
01:28:01,569 --> 01:28:03,170
Total deaths one

869
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:06,750
Enemies have more difficulty aiming at you

870
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:09,550
You're doing something bar fills more quick. Uh

871
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:14,659
What does that mean? You're doing something bar. What's that mean?

872
01:28:20,109 --> 01:28:21,250
Experience

873
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:25,859
And i'm gonna assume it's exp, right?

874
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,079
Oh, it's that when the bar that fills when you do something. Okay

875
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:41,329
Yeah, i'm not even gonna do this anymore because I failed it. I'm an idiot

876
01:28:41,329 --> 01:28:43,810
All right, so we need to neutralize this slum dweller

877
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:47,489
We get three cardboard boxes just they're all kind of right in a row

878
01:28:48,369 --> 01:28:51,090
There's a atm over here and there's a safe right there. All right, let's go

879
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:58,220
I don't want to make a whole lot of noise. Let's go baseball bat

880
01:28:58,939 --> 01:29:00,939
Knock on the door. Let it open

881
01:29:00,939 --> 01:29:03,310
whack

882
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:05,310
I took three bullets four bullets

883
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:12,430
I'm gonna die. I'm going to die right now. I'm gonna die right now. That's how ridiculous why did that just happen to me?

884
01:29:13,539 --> 01:29:15,539
I just ate the guy's whole clip and he ran out of ammo

885
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:38,930
Ooh, all right. Uh, yep. I actually have a silencer on this now. That's good

886
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:44,510
finally

887
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:46,590
Eat the sandwich clone machine

888
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,520
clone self

889
01:29:49,520 --> 01:30:01,229
Okay, you can have a grenade and a baseball bat

890
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:14,699
Uh, let's go worker

891
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:17,869
power box

892
01:30:17,869 --> 01:30:29,010
There's a mission over here. What do you want me to do? Excuse me doctor?

893
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:32,289
mission

894
01:30:32,289 --> 01:30:37,729
Rescue the drug dealer and you get five chicken nuggets. Let's do it. I think you've had enough. It's something I never said

895
01:30:38,289 --> 01:30:42,260
All right

896
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:46,539
rescue drug dealer

897
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:52,750
All right

898
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:56,189
I'm gonna have like 20 or 30 nuggets after this. It's gonna be kind of hard

899
01:30:56,810 --> 01:31:01,060
considering

900
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:03,539
This is the police station

901
01:31:03,539 --> 01:31:05,859
Is there a way to open these doors without causing a problem?

902
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:10,380
Is there a computer?

903
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:17,739
Shit, how do I do this without causing a problem?

904
01:31:27,699 --> 01:31:29,699
Does this ignore crimes? No

905
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:33,619
Keys. Yeah, maybe a key

906
01:31:33,699 --> 01:31:36,899
When is he gonna play minecraft again?

907
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:38,739
in 20 minutes

908
01:31:38,739 --> 01:31:41,220
It's a lie. I'm not doing that

909
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,760
Oh, no

910
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,739
How am I gonna do this?

911
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:58,989
I can't just blow this because it's gonna kill him. There's gotta be a key that I can get from somebody

912
01:31:59,949 --> 01:32:03,949
I'm gonna have to try to get a key from one of the cops. Let me put the sign. No, let me

913
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:12,560
Yeah, somebody has to have a key

914
01:32:13,439 --> 01:32:27,949
There it is. You did it minecraft resident sleeper

915
01:32:29,949 --> 01:32:33,380
Oh wait

916
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:36,130
That's right. You're a prisoner. Um

917
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:39,460
We're gonna go down

918
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:51,060
Don't get burnt

919
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:55,539
Down down down down follow follow follow. Let's go go go

920
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:59,760
Nope. Nope. Nope. What do you mean? Nope

921
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:07,020
All right, I did it five nuggets resident resident sleep

922
01:33:07,659 --> 01:33:20,899
I can't do those. How does that work? Next up on the list is to

923
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:28,739
Go this way. Whoa

924
01:33:28,739 --> 01:33:31,060
I did look it's not he's annoyed

925
01:33:31,859 --> 01:33:36,500
Yeah, I got blown through here with a gun in my hand. I didn't do anything. Why did he do that?

926
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:41,739
Did he steal from me? I don't understand

927
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:52,829
All right, I'm gonna turn these off. Let's see this one first retrieve the item from the worker

928
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:55,550
Oh god, this is gonna be ugly

929
01:33:56,029 --> 01:33:59,810
My mystery item sure

930
01:34:00,989 --> 01:34:02,989
hypnotizer mark two

931
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:08,779
Use this on someone to make them align with you because everyone needs somebody to lean on. Okay, that's cool

932
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,979
He's ugly

933
01:34:13,979 --> 01:34:21,819
Uh, my partner's gonna die here. Can I tell you to stay here? Just stand here

934
01:34:22,539 --> 01:34:26,060
Poison great. I'm trying to make you stand here and it's killing me

935
01:34:28,609 --> 01:34:31,329
Oh god, you stepped on it, too. Just stay here

936
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:35,869
Where should I stand down in the corner over there?

937
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:45,569
You're gonna die on you

938
01:34:45,569 --> 01:34:48,689
What what is poisoning you? Why are you still poisoned?

939
01:34:49,329 --> 01:34:52,859
I'm confused. Okay

940
01:34:52,859 --> 01:35:03,899
How am I gonna do this?

941
01:35:03,899 --> 01:35:10,300
What this is supposed to be silent?

942
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:24,619
Shit, give me the tooth and let's get out of here

943
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:33,149
Wait, they can turn off the gas. Oh god. Give me a break. I'm an idiot

944
01:35:34,189 --> 01:35:36,189
All right, come with me. Let's go

945
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:41,100
We just need to do this part. The chest is chest. Where's it you think?

946
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:48,590
No, it's not

947
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:51,390
I need to i'm gonna die. I need to heal we have to get the fuck out of here

948
01:35:52,029 --> 01:36:04,369
The streamer doesn't have pepe laugh enabled

949
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:09,310
No, I guess I don't no, I don't you're right

950
01:36:10,029 --> 01:36:13,060
Oh shit, I don't have that enabled. What am I what am I supposed to do?

951
01:36:13,779 --> 01:36:19,340
All right, here's another bullshit mission

952
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:21,659
You stay here

953
01:36:21,659 --> 01:36:25,920
Stand here

954
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,800
I'll do this on my own. I don't need your help

955
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,399
Countdown started

956
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:38,670
Let me

957
01:36:38,670 --> 01:36:40,670
Holy shit

958
01:36:42,739 --> 01:36:45,420
What?

959
01:36:45,579 --> 01:36:50,420
I just got bounced around like crazy. Oh, that was annoying

960
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,100
Uh, let's go to the home base

961
01:36:56,579 --> 01:36:59,140
I want to I just got a lot of chicken nuggets

962
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:07,119
Gorilla, can I talk to the gorilla?

963
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:12,880
All right

964
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:18,579
Whatever new traits

965
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:23,890
25 chicken nuggets these will appear

966
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:27,779
In the game. Oh man, I don't even know

967
01:37:30,779 --> 01:37:32,779
Knockback damage is decreased

968
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:36,859
You can recruit up to three people but they suck though. They're idiots

969
01:37:39,470 --> 01:37:42,529
Explosions caused by the players don't damage the player. That's pretty good

970
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:52,140
Wall wall hopper melee weapons can destroy certain walls when equipped for a large durability cost

971
01:37:56,539 --> 01:37:58,539
gain extra experience

972
01:37:58,779 --> 01:38:00,380
burning bullets

973
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:07,170
Drop weapons contain more ammo

974
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:14,260
Damage inflicted on the player may not cause any health loss. What?

975
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:17,500
a crit

976
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:23,649
That's weird. All right. Well, hold on. There's more stuff to do

977
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:28,060
rewards loadouts rewards

978
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:37,979

the

986
01:39:02,289 --> 01:39:08,130
Main menu screen of like a ball rolling ipad game where you have to roll the 3d ball around

987
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:12,050
And get it into a hole at the end of the level. I don't know why that's all I hear

988
01:39:12,689 --> 01:39:22,399
What else we got?

989
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:25,579

995
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:51,170
mutators

996
01:39:51,170 --> 01:39:53,409
Can I unlock characters?

997
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:59,199

1002
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:20,479
So I already did it

1003
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:28,239

1004
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:29,359
cannibals

1005
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:31,359
Cannibals will no longer attack you on sight

1006
01:40:34,029 --> 01:40:37,869
Each father's health can be restored once per floor. That's pretty good sneaky fingers

1007
01:40:38,930 --> 01:40:41,409
People won't notice when you're doing something bar is filling

1008
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,500

01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:55,359
You can't hit people you're aligned with and they can't hit you

What does that mean?

1025
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:45,229
Do the gorilla, but that's it. Is that an overpowered character?

1026
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:50,909
How do I change this character? I don't want to beat this guy anymore. I want to try somebody else

1027
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:53,979
loadout

1028
01:41:53,979 --> 01:42:09,279
Is there a way I can like change my character? Oh at the start of the game you choose it. All right

01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:13,810
All right, let's go

1030
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:18,289

Can't use computers or other complicated tech

Sucker items in shop costs more make loud noise whenever you move

1040
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:52,239

You can have three people follow you

1046
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:14,159
Knockback from damages decrease firing guns doesn't cause knockback

1047
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:18,319
Scientists will attack you on site

1048

1058
01:44:13,779 --> 01:44:15,619

01:45:51,630 --> 01:45:54,109
I know that wasn't a gorilla. Is there a gorilla on the level?

1076
01:45:54,829 --> 01:46:02,750

Cannot do it

1083
01:46:37,729 --> 01:46:41,420
All right. Did I miss it? There were no gorillas on this level, right?

1084
01:46:43,409 --> 01:46:50,100
I didn't see any

1085
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,779
No, there's no gorillas here

1086
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:57,840
Punch the window and climb through can you actually do that with this character?

1087
01:47:02,829 --> 01:47:11,680
No, let's just get out

1088

You can with all characters. Oh shit. I didn't know that

1089
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:18,960
This is new

1090
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,960
Should I do money? I should have do breaking into walls

1091
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:32,779
Probably the break walls one

1092
01:47:32,779 --> 01:47:37,710
Money is useless. Is it? Oh my god

1093
01:47:38,430 --> 01:47:40,909
Run in progress. All right. There's a gorilla on this floor

So how do I do this?

1097
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,560
I can't speak english. I just have to punch

1098
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:08,739

1100
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:21,329
And a knife looking for the gorilla safe in there

1101
01:48:27,550 --> 01:48:32,829
That was pretty good lineup. All right. Got a bat safe combination. Forget about this guy coming to get the safe. No only I am

1102
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:38,479
incriminating photo

1103
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:43,600
The resistance leaders would never cheat on their spouses help this completely truthful narrative prevail

1104
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:49,550
What what am I supposed to do with that?

1105
01:48:49,789 --> 01:48:56,880
Like a secret item. Let's head up

1106
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:05,939
Gorilla save gorilla. Let's go out

1107

I'm gonna break through this and kill him

1110
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:39,409
Oh, wait a minute. This is a bad idea. I don't know because that was smart. That was not smart

1111
01:49:40,479 --> 01:49:42,640
Oh shit. Oh shit. What do we do?

1112
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:48,260
Oh god, okay. Um, where's my other gorilla friend?

1113
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:59,970
Neutralized where is he? He's fine. There he is. We're good. All right, can I give you stuff?

1114
01:50:00,979 --> 01:50:04,159
I'm gonna give you a banana

1115
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:08,060
All right. You're fine. We're gonna sell the guns because we can't use them

1116
01:50:09,979 --> 01:50:13,380
silencer

1117
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:15,380
And you can't know we're selling the ammo stuff

1118
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:21,250
Chris's firearms attribute when using any projectile weapon. I just I don't have any I can't use weapons

1119
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:25,869
Put that down

1120
01:50:25,869 --> 01:50:27,869
And get a melee weapon in your hand

1121
01:50:28,029 --> 01:50:33,010
All right, let's do this mission

1122
01:50:33,409 --> 01:50:37,939
Retrieve I got it

1123
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,460
incriminating photo

1124
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:43,100
That was easy

1125
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:48,319
Five chicken nuggets

1126
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:50,000
Nice. Okay

1127
01:50:50,000 --> 01:51:02,140
I need to do to destroy that

1128
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:06,380
All right. We're gonna go right from the back. I'm gonna break through the wall and just hit it once

1129
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:16,210
Did you just give him the banana peel?

1130
01:51:16,689 --> 01:51:19,180
Where's do I have bananas?

1131
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:22,739
Okay, why did you just do that?

1132
01:51:22,739 --> 01:51:29,649
Can't break this

1133
01:51:29,649 --> 01:51:32,529
Did I oh I can't open the door because i'm a gorilla, right?

1134
01:51:35,550 --> 01:51:42,989
All right, nice job

01:51:42,989 --> 01:51:44,989
Oh

1136
01:51:44,989 --> 01:51:46,989
The whole audience just went oh

1137
01:51:50,539 --> 01:51:53,420
Oh, come on I thought he was gonna give me another second

1138
01:51:55,420 --> 01:52:00,640
It's all right, I get leveled up and I free them we're good

1139
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:15,840
Mission accomplished. I can't break through these just get out the door and let's go

1140
01:52:21,409 --> 01:52:22,930
Go on. Let's see

01:52:22,930 --> 01:52:24,930
Mission accomplished. My only friend is dead

1142
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:29,199
Ooh

1143
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:34,060
Hold on. Does this mean I can break through the metal walls?

1144
01:52:38,909 --> 01:52:51,630
That's pretty good. Let me try it. All right. I don't have any melee. How do I do the scream?

1145
01:52:52,510 --> 01:52:54,829
Killer robot is after you watch out great

1146
01:52:55,630 --> 01:52:57,630
How do I do the scream doctor?

1147
01:53:00,510 --> 01:53:04,029
Come here

1148
01:53:04,029 --> 01:53:05,229
Come here

1149
01:53:05,229 --> 01:53:24,020
All right, I get

1150
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:26,420
Oh god, what have I done? Wait, wait, I have an idea

1151
01:53:31,649 --> 01:53:33,649
It kind of worked it kind of worked

1152
01:53:34,779 --> 01:53:36,539
Can I kill the robot?

1153
01:53:36,539 --> 01:53:48,770
Okay, he's gonna hurt this money in these graves

1154
01:53:49,329 --> 01:53:58,529
Give me this money. Just keep doing this

1155
01:53:58,609 --> 01:54:09,619
shit

1156
01:54:09,619 --> 01:54:14,939
God damn it. I'm gonna die. I need heals

1157
01:54:15,579 --> 01:54:18,770
And maybe I want that money first though. He can't see me through walls, right?

1158
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:28,189
He that's so much damage. He's hurting himself at 30 every time. It's not even close. I have to run

1159
01:54:28,909 --> 01:54:36,449
Oh shit

1160
01:54:36,449 --> 01:54:40,420
Um

1161
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:43,149
I need to heal. I need to heal. I can't

1162
01:54:45,069 --> 01:54:47,069
Scientists kill it ghost

1163
01:54:47,310 --> 01:54:48,899
Friendly ghost

1164
01:54:48,899 --> 01:54:53,779
Can I add the ghost to my team? I don't think so. All right, I gotta go go go go go go go hurry up

1165
01:54:54,500 --> 01:55:03,470
soda machine

1166
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:05,470
Oh, no, you got a gun

1167
01:55:06,189 --> 01:55:08,189
Oh fuck

1168
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:11,630
Is the fucking robot no

1169
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:16,659
Please

1170
01:55:16,659 --> 01:55:18,420
Oh, what do I do?

1171
01:55:18,859 --> 01:55:20,859
Where's the robot? He's right here

1172
01:55:25,579 --> 01:55:27,859
This is so stupid

1173
01:55:27,859 --> 01:55:29,859
I need to buy another banana

1174
01:55:31,659 --> 01:55:33,659
Why is he still chasing me?

1175
01:55:34,590 --> 01:55:36,750
You just blocked that you gotta be fucking kidding me

1176
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:41,979
Fucking stupid like shop owner

1177
01:55:52,739 --> 01:55:57,699
Damn it

1178
01:55:57,699 --> 01:55:59,699
All right. Let's put on twitch integration. Let's see how it is

1179
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:03,279
Let me make sure I have it set up right

1180
01:56:03,359 --> 01:56:05,359
I don't I have no idea what this is gonna do

1181
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:09,100
But it should be on

1182
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:14,590
What does it do?

1183
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:16,300
like it

1184
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:18,380
It's on it's apparently turned on

1185
01:56:18,939 --> 01:56:29,810
Let me do some traits. I'm gonna stay with the gorilla

1186
01:56:32,739 --> 01:56:34,500
blaster survivor

1187
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:37,460
Explosions caused by the player don't damage the player. I like that

1188
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:47,260
Thieving tools may not break after usage cause people you hit to be knocked back further. I don't like that

1189
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:52,750
hiring people cost less

1190
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:56,609
Saving crowds more nearby followers. You have to list damage you take

1191
01:56:57,409 --> 01:57:00,539
Health giving items will affect your nearby followers. That's kind of good

1192
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:06,159
Can't hit people of your own class unless they are hostile

1193
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:09,439
That's pretty good. All right. What about one of these two ones?

1194
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:13,329
Followers will always travel to the next floor. All right, cool

1195
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:17,819
So I I

1196
01:57:17,819 --> 01:57:20,140
It's apparently turned on. I don't know what commands you're gonna have

1197
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:25,779
If it even is gonna work

1198
01:57:25,779 --> 01:57:26,899
We'll find out

1199
01:57:26,899 --> 01:57:33,539
Staying with the gorilla it lets us vote on stuff. Okay

1200
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:38,449
Let me look at this again. I can't use projectiles. I can have three people

1201
01:57:40,670 --> 01:57:42,750
Knockback from damage is decreased

1202
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:46,880
kill scientists

1203
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:53,069
I can do the lunge and bananas give you more health. All right

1204
01:57:54,979 --> 01:57:58,989
Turn it on. It's not working

1205
01:57:58,989 --> 01:58:00,989
Well, I just I turned it on

1206
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:07,840
nothing

1207
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:11,119
Text at the bottom of the screen for twitch settings. Yes. Do I maybe have to reload again?

1208
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:23,090
Maybe i'll reload again. It is on instead. Yeah, it's on in settings. I have like the token or everything

1209
01:58:25,949 --> 01:58:27,949
Everything. Yeah, everything's turned on for voting

1210
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:31,939
Okay on right

1211
01:58:32,260 --> 01:58:38,260
Vote duration 30 seconds viewers choose traits on viewers choose levels disasters on viewers choose rewards on

1212
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:45,810
That's fine, right?

1213
01:58:45,970 --> 01:58:47,489
leaked

1214
01:58:47,489 --> 01:58:49,010
Maybe it takes a minute

1215
01:58:49,010 --> 01:58:53,859
We'll see what happens. All right operate

1216
01:58:55,619 --> 01:59:10,699
Let's make this quick

1217
01:59:10,699 --> 01:59:13,359
You didn't tell me that it hurt me

1218
01:59:13,359 --> 01:59:17,310
Oh cheeseburger

1219
01:59:17,310 --> 01:59:24,960
Turn off all the lights in this person's house. What a mission and then we have to rescue this

1220
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,199
office drone

1221
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:35,470
Excuse me

1222
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:50,180
Scientists extra experience from the scientists, right? All right, let's go. I can't speak english

1223
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:54,720
uh

1224
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:59,630
Okay, how do I tell him to follow me?

1225
01:59:59,630 --> 02:00:11,659
Wait

1226
02:00:11,659 --> 02:00:13,859
Not like that

1227
02:00:13,859 --> 02:00:15,859
He won't climb through the broken glass

1228
02:00:21,039 --> 02:00:23,039
Oh my god

1229
02:00:23,279 --> 02:00:37,470
We're dead. Just kill me. Just kill me. Just kill me. Kill me. It's not even worth it. Just kill me

1230
02:00:37,470 --> 02:00:40,220
Just do it. Just do it. Just do it. Start over

1231
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:54,539
Damn it. I can't just fail the first mission. Let's go same deal. There is no

1232
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:57,970
Okay, there's no uh gorilla here

1233
02:01:03,729 --> 02:01:05,569

1234
02:01:05,569 --> 02:01:07,649
I'm oh look at all these scientists in here

1235
02:01:08,289 --> 02:01:10,449
They're all armed though

1236
02:01:10,449 --> 02:01:16,739
Not a good idea

1237
02:01:16,819 --> 02:01:20,270
They're in the trash pretty cool

1238
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:28,829
What do I need to do up?

1239
02:01:28,829 --> 02:01:31,149
Treat the item in here. I can just climb through and get it and climb out

1240
02:01:31,949 --> 02:01:36,640
Let's do that blast

1241
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:38,640
I need a melee weapon with this guy

1242
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:47,010
Drug dealer clerk annoyed. Yeah clerks don't like it when I come in here

1243
02:01:48,609 --> 02:01:50,609
I'll fucking deal with it

1244
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:08,859
Hold on I I can't shoot a gun but I can use a computer

1245
02:02:09,579 --> 02:02:11,409
How does that make any sense?

1246
02:02:11,409 --> 02:02:29,020
Come here. Come in. No, no, don't let him run away. Don't all right. Well, I don't care. You got away

1247
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:35,600
Gorillas can use computers. Are you stupid?

1248
02:02:38,020 --> 02:02:40,020
You wouldn't got a friend

1249

1250
02:02:45,630 --> 02:02:50,500

Will I get money from the ATM? No. Yeah, you're in you're in yeah

1267
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:17,520

02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,520
So, please be nice to me

1269
02:04:20,159 --> 02:04:26,479
Shit, i'm not doing that. Why would I do that? Wait, do I have to do that?

1270
02:04:27,779 --> 02:04:29,779
Get the briefcase from the chest

1271
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:41,550
Can we get hit by the fire? Oh shit

1272
02:04:42,430 --> 02:04:46,590
Up is down and down is up

1273
02:04:46,750 --> 02:04:48,750
No, I can't

1274
02:04:48,829 --> 02:04:50,510
I can't control this

1275
02:04:50,510 --> 02:04:52,510
I have to hold up to go down

1276
02:04:52,590 --> 02:05:05,310
How long does it?

1277
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:10,750
Do you have no idea how fucking hard that was to do? It's still the other

1278
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:15,699
When does it stop? Oh my god. Thank goodness

1279
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:26,300
Even swinging in this direction swung it over in that direction. That was horrible

1280
02:05:26,859 --> 02:05:28,399
Okay

1281
02:05:28,399 --> 02:05:30,670
I got everything I need

1282
02:05:30,670 --> 02:05:34,779
Let's move. I'm not doing the generator. No reason to just go

1283
02:05:35,659 --> 02:05:40,579
No gorillas on this level either

1284
02:05:46,819 --> 02:05:51,010
Choose a trait

1285
02:05:51,010 --> 02:05:52,770
Okay. I'll let you see what they do

1286
02:05:52,770 --> 02:05:54,770
And he's more likely to run away

1287
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:58,619
Followers gain extra health and receive money at the start of every new floor

1288
02:06:00,579 --> 02:06:02,579
Why did I know everyone was gonna pick this one?

1289
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:07,680
Oh, I didn't muck her ass. She's ugly

1290
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:18,829
All right. So, uh people run away

1291
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:28,159
One person said that one guy said that and you're still holding on to it

1292
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,300
All right, kill doctor get lockpick

1293
02:06:32,989 --> 02:06:36,670
Get the hard drive from the gangster and turn off all the switches

1294
02:06:37,710 --> 02:06:38,750
Okay

1295
02:06:38,750 --> 02:06:45,520
What do I got here? Banana peel. Oh, that's cool

1296
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:49,489
food

1297
02:06:49,489 --> 02:06:50,689
Sell that

1298
02:06:50,689 --> 02:06:55,760
Put the rock on here. All right, so I can make it send your opponent stone a trip to the ground

1299
02:06:56,560 --> 02:07:01,710
How does this work?

1300
02:07:01,710 --> 02:07:03,710
Now that's what the other gorilla was using

1301
02:07:04,420 --> 02:07:08,739
right

1302
02:07:08,739 --> 02:07:12,829
i'm gonna buy a banana

1303
02:07:12,909 --> 02:07:14,029
and

1304
02:07:14,029 --> 02:07:20,289
Should I clone myself? I don't have enough money. Never mind. There's a mission up there, too

1305
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:22,850
No gorillas to free

1306
02:07:22,850 --> 02:07:24,960
Let's go do it

1307
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:30,079
What do you got?

1308
02:07:30,079 --> 02:07:33,760
Uh free slave get five nuggets. Okay, it's down at the bottom

1309
02:07:34,399 --> 02:07:53,520
Out here. It's down this way

1310
02:07:54,079 --> 02:07:58,130
What are you doing? What are you? What are you? What are we freaking out?

1311
02:07:59,869 --> 02:08:01,869
What is what is what are we freaking out? What's going on here?

1312
02:08:11,579 --> 02:08:13,100
What what is this?

1313
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:25,699
What the what the fuck is this?

1314
02:08:25,779 --> 02:08:32,500
Accomplished in 87 what we released this for the most accomplished. Why did somebody make this?

1315
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:35,060
We released this for

1316
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:42,239
That's fucking terrifying. I told you I told you guys I told you this like a year ago

1317
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:48,239
Eventually, you're gonna be they're gonna get you can say anything. They'll get you to say anything. They'll get your face on shit

1318
02:08:49,039 --> 02:08:54,640
There's no there's no such thing as authenticity anymore and another five years. This technology will be perfected

1319
02:08:55,199 --> 02:08:57,920
You're most accomplished. How did you do this?

1320
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:03,819
I'm gonna show this

1321
02:09:03,819 --> 02:09:09,260
Because this is absolutely outrageous. That's me on the screen. Like I was in this scene had to open

1322
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:24,420
Hold on. We've released this for the most accomplished. If 87 we've released this

1323
02:09:26,979 --> 02:09:32,500
If 87 we've released this for the most accomplished if 87

1324
02:09:32,979 --> 02:09:40,500
You we've released this for the most accomplished in 87 you we've released this for the most accomplished

1325
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:45,140
In 87 you we've released this for the most accomplished

1326
02:09:46,180 --> 02:09:49,859
I hate this we've released this for the most accomplished

1327
02:09:50,739 --> 02:09:58,340
computers

1328
02:09:58,340 --> 02:10:00,289
aren't

1329
02:10:00,289 --> 02:10:02,689
See, I see it in fucking like 100 years

1330
02:10:04,689 --> 02:10:08,050
When like we will we're not going to be under control by the machines

1331
02:10:08,689 --> 02:10:13,439
Someone will come up with some algorithm that replaces human brains and we're just it's over

1332
02:10:14,079 --> 02:10:24,380
I don't know how you make something like that

1333
02:10:29,630 --> 02:10:31,630
Yeah, and that's like the third or fourth time that's happened

1334
02:10:32,770 --> 02:10:36,609
Some of you guys are getting really good at this like uh, do you eat ass like yes, of course I do

1335
02:10:36,689 --> 02:10:38,750
I've seen that before

1336
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:40,989
Some of you guys are getting really good at this. I just want to be dabbing

1337
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:48,399
Also, uh another great thing about the oh you can your face can be put on anything. I could just deny anything ever

1338
02:10:51,060 --> 02:10:55,859
Like i've that's never i've never done that I can deny it because look you just see how good the fakes are

1339
02:10:56,659 --> 02:11:03,170
It's easy to deny to deny everything though. Okay. I got to how do I get you out of here?

1340
02:11:05,170 --> 02:11:12,109
Do I have to kill the guards?

1341
02:11:12,109 --> 02:11:15,310
Hey, you got that was like a joke that that was the equipment. Come on

1342
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:34,159
You're gonna stab me over a joke. All right, i'll take the axe for sure. All right. Did you get out? Did you go?

1343
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:36,640
I didn't kill the guy accidentally, right?

1344
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:43,279
No, i'm good in 87

1345
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:55,649
Wait, where's this? Oh, he's up here out of the way I will take the chicken nuggets. Thank you

1346
02:11:56,609 --> 02:12:03,680
Huey louis. All right, so that I should be able to retrieve the items break through the door

1347
02:12:04,239 --> 02:12:16,859
No, it shouldn't be too hard though. Why don't you break free like

1348
02:12:21,069 --> 02:12:23,390
Oh should you you guys have to pick every reward I get

1349
02:12:24,109 --> 02:12:26,859
Free item mini fridge, which makes food better

1350
02:12:27,819 --> 02:12:34,380
Uh shuriken people generally dislike when you plant these in their faces or has literally nothing to do with smaller rodents

1351
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:37,020
But does increase your chance of scoring a crit by 100 percent

1352
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:46,850
Why would somebody deep fake me onto that? I still can't get over that

1353
02:12:49,739 --> 02:12:53,340
Can you deep fake me onto willy wonka when he does the pure imagination song?

1354
02:12:55,979 --> 02:12:57,340
Somebody get on that

1355
02:12:57,340 --> 02:13:06,130
How long would that take would that take like two quantum computers to get that done in like the next couple hours?

1356
02:13:06,850 --> 02:13:22,909
I'm not talking the whole scene. All right, we gotta go on with that chest

1357
02:13:23,470 --> 02:13:29,659
easy

1358
02:13:29,659 --> 02:13:31,840
And a burger dropped good within the chest

1359
02:13:33,390 --> 02:13:34,750
Something to sell

1360
02:13:34,750 --> 02:13:35,789
good

1361
02:13:35,789 --> 02:13:41,250
No gorillas, right? Nope

1362
02:13:41,329 --> 02:13:46,050
Really good and well-trained deep fakes can render entire scene in about two days

1363
02:13:50,079 --> 02:13:57,180
That's not worth it that's not worth it upgrade trait

1364
02:13:57,899 --> 02:13:59,899
Oh, that's way too much money

1365
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:06,399
That's some

1366
02:14:06,399 --> 02:14:08,659
Oh my god

1367
02:14:08,659 --> 02:14:10,420
Neutralize the doctor

1368
02:14:10,420 --> 02:14:14,100
Of course, let's turn off these switches get out of here. Oh, okay. I'm getting out i'm leaving

1369
02:14:24,829 --> 02:14:35,680
Key to the bank watch the full deep fake what hold on

1370
02:14:36,619 --> 02:14:39,170
What do you mean the full?

1371
02:14:39,170 --> 02:14:45,460
deep fake

1372
02:14:45,460 --> 02:14:47,550
Somebody did the whole scene

1373
02:14:47,550 --> 02:14:50,579
No, they didn't

1374
02:14:50,579 --> 02:14:52,579
Why?

1375
02:14:52,979 --> 02:14:59,409
What?

1376
02:14:59,409 --> 02:15:01,970
Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me

1377
02:15:13,789 --> 02:15:15,069
What?

1378
02:15:15,069 --> 02:15:23,010
Wait, let me see this

1379
02:15:32,579 --> 02:15:34,180
Why

1380
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:36,180
Why did you make this?

1381
02:15:37,630 --> 02:15:41,630
I don't have any reason for you for anybody to have made this

1382
02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:51,170
I we have to watch this i'm putting it on screen

1383
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:55,460
all right, so spoilers for um

1384
02:15:56,579 --> 02:15:58,420
american psycho if you've ever seen that movie before

1385
02:15:59,890 --> 02:16:01,090
and uh

1386
02:16:01,090 --> 02:16:06,449
Just know that if you haven't seen it, this is a scene in that movie. Okay good. Well, we good. I think we're good

1387
02:16:06,770 --> 02:16:15,760
You understand

1388
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:17,760
You like huy lewis on the news

1389
02:16:18,859 --> 02:16:20,140
They're okay

1390
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:25,199
Their early work was a little too that's not me for my taste

1391
02:16:26,189 --> 02:16:28,189
When sports came out in 83

1392
02:16:28,350 --> 02:16:37,260
That's not is that me that's not me artistically the whole album has a clear crisp sound

1393
02:16:37,579 --> 02:16:42,780
And a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost

1394
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:45,340
I can't tell

1395
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:58,799
He's been compared to elvis costello, but I think huy has a far more bitter cynical sense of humor

1396
02:16:59,520 --> 02:17:05,149
Oh, yeah, we're straight up. Yes, alan. Why are the copies of the style section of a play do you?

1397
02:17:06,030 --> 02:17:13,629
Have a dog a little chow or something no alan is that a raincoat yes it is

1398
02:17:15,579 --> 02:17:17,579
In 87

1399
02:18:03,059 --> 02:18:05,059
What what is he saying

1400
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:11,149
What is it saying?

1401
02:18:11,229 --> 02:18:13,229
What is it saying except to fuck you

1402
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:24,020
Uh, okay. I looked over it and somebody said

1403
02:18:25,299 --> 02:18:28,340
Major tos warning and i'm like, what are you talking about?

1404
02:18:28,739 --> 02:18:34,020
Oh, right when he uh brutally murders this guy with a fucking axe on camera. Oh, right. Yeah

1405
02:18:34,899 --> 02:18:54,690
That part I forgot about that. Okay, it's not real

1406
02:18:55,489 --> 02:18:58,879
Yeah

1407
02:18:58,879 --> 02:19:02,719
It's cool if it's a video game not if it's a movie. I don't make the rules

1408
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:08,530
Hold on. Let me see this

1409
02:19:08,530 --> 02:19:19,389
Where did it go? What is this?

1410
02:19:23,389 --> 02:19:32,100
This is so fucked up

1411
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:37,040
It this is ridiculous

1412
02:19:37,600 --> 02:20:07,229
I couldn't tell if it was christian bale of my face. It was too weird. We'll get we're going to down paths

1413
02:20:07,709 --> 02:20:09,709
That we never should have gone down

1414
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:15,420
Let me tell you a story. Okay, i'll tell you a story

1415
02:20:18,450 --> 02:20:21,899
Um, i'm gonna put this on screen and i'm gonna tell you a little story

1416
02:20:24,959 --> 02:20:38,319
Give me one second because it needs to be said

1417
02:20:44,190 --> 02:20:46,860
You're like huy lewis on the news. Okay, so

1418
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:51,459
What was supposed to be

1419
02:20:51,459 --> 02:20:53,500
What was supposed to be?

1420
02:20:53,500 --> 02:20:55,340
like 50k

1421
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:59,579
on a computer

1422
02:20:59,579 --> 02:21:01,489
has turned into

1423
02:21:01,489 --> 02:21:06,530
People doing this shit for fun. You were only supposed to send an email to somebody once a day

1424
02:21:07,409 --> 02:21:13,469
You understand?

1425
02:21:13,469 --> 02:21:19,870
Once a day you were supposed to send an email or maybe receive the equivalent of a fucking text from your mother

1426
02:21:26,799 --> 02:21:32,829
You know what i'm saying? Not much of a story but more of an observation

1427
02:21:36,459 --> 02:21:38,459
That's like my hair

1428
02:21:46,959 --> 02:21:49,200
All right. Wait a second freeze that

1429
02:21:57,940 --> 02:22:14,319
We have to do this because I need to see if this is for real. Hold on. Can I pause this without

1430
02:22:23,329 --> 02:22:30,340
This out of the way

1431
02:22:30,340 --> 02:22:39,540
Fuck it is

1432
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:50,510
Why is it exactly the same? It's just a little like it's a little cleaner. Hold on. I can I can flip it wait

1433
02:22:54,510 --> 02:23:30,770
Let me flip this

1434
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:50,219
I can't I this is too weird for me. Don't look at that. All right, i've had enough

1435
02:24:06,799 --> 02:24:08,959
It's hard to even process that that's even possible

1436
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:15,889
Remember when gps was a big deal when you had the thing that told you directions

1437
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,879
Wow

1438
02:24:18,879 --> 02:24:25,280
Just technology it tells you how to get to the person's house. I'm going to pretend that you were in this movie killing somebody

1439
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:27,899
No, what happens next?

1440
02:24:42,579 --> 02:24:49,940
Skynet. Well, that was a good little uh intermission there. I think let's get back to the game

1441
02:24:52,030 --> 02:24:54,190
Face cam so we have more footage to use

1442
02:24:56,239 --> 02:24:59,280
No, I don't do face cam. I only do face cam like once a month

1443
02:25:09,489 --> 02:25:14,129
No, I I was in front of a green screen for like six hours you can't pull some of that

1444
02:25:15,010 --> 02:25:30,299
Let me just be the gorilla. Hold on. I gotta get in there. I'm never gonna turn my face cam on again

1445
02:25:30,860 --> 02:25:33,250
Someone will use it

1446
02:25:33,250 --> 02:25:35,739
Someone will use it somewhere without my permission

1447
02:25:36,299 --> 02:25:48,260
That was it. That's all that was in there

1448
02:25:48,260 --> 02:25:50,260
Turret turret. What do I do about that?

1449
02:25:50,819 --> 02:25:53,379
I had to go the other way

1450
02:25:53,379 --> 02:26:10,659
So you let a goon?

1451
02:26:10,659 --> 02:26:16,500
61 dollars pretty good the turret only shoots if the camera sees you that's good to know

1452
02:26:17,059 --> 02:26:19,620
I want to at least get to like level five

1453
02:26:19,700 --> 02:26:25,309
Am I ever gonna be able to do this?

1454
02:26:25,309 --> 02:26:27,709
Syringe in a trash can I wouldn't pick that up if I were you

1455
02:26:30,209 --> 02:26:40,299
Um, that's all right. This is gonna be hard to do

1456
02:26:40,940 --> 02:26:44,030
I'm gonna have to break a door

1457
02:26:44,030 --> 02:26:46,020
climb through a window or

1458
02:26:46,020 --> 02:26:48,020
Because nobody wants the gorilla in the store, right?

1459
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:51,680
Maybe if I can just go right through

1460
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:58,180
Wait, is the cop gonna see that?

1461
02:26:58,180 --> 02:27:08,799
Sometimes you gotta just go for it. You just do let's go

1462
02:27:11,170 --> 02:27:12,209
new

1463
02:27:12,209 --> 02:27:16,020
Floor here we go. Give me something good guys, please

1464
02:27:16,579 --> 02:27:19,260
please

1465
02:27:19,260 --> 02:27:23,260
Followers will always follow you to the next floor. Maybe weapons can destroy walls

1466
02:27:24,219 --> 02:27:27,340
Or items in shop costs less, but I can't talk

1467
02:27:28,139 --> 02:27:31,500
So that's not gonna help me

1468
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:39,549
Choose wisely

1469
02:27:39,549 --> 02:27:41,549
Three is 100% useless, right?

1470
02:27:42,030 --> 02:27:51,739
What was that? Oh, I get two

1471
02:27:52,299 --> 02:27:58,590
Hey, wait, wait, wait, slow slow slow slow slow down slow down. Which terrifying disaster should befall your poor streamer in the next level?

1472
02:27:59,229 --> 02:28:03,309
Bombs are falling from the sky a bounty is on the player's head. So random people will attack

1473
02:28:03,790 --> 02:28:10,639
Or a killer robot. No, don't do the killer robot. That's guaranteed. It runs over do like bombs dropping

1474
02:28:10,639 --> 02:28:12,639
That's like funny yellow bell moment, right? Come on

1475
02:28:18,879 --> 02:28:21,309
Really? This one sucks

1476
02:28:21,790 --> 02:28:27,920
This one actually sucks. I'm probably gonna lose i'm just gonna go to the end of the level as fast as I can

1477
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:32,799

02:38:39,649 --> 02:38:41,649
Oh, you killed him. Uh, oh

1572
02:38:42,450 --> 02:39:05,819
I hit every single attack every single one. That's gotta say something. I'm not sure what that's supposed to say, but it

1573
02:39:06,700 --> 02:39:09,600
Not very much. I guess

1574
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:12,879
The game has auto aim. Yeah, I knew someone was gonna take it from me

1575
02:39:14,750 --> 02:39:16,750
Somebody was gonna take it from me. I knew they were

1576
02:39:17,149 --> 02:39:22,190
Through here

1577
02:39:24,110 --> 02:39:27,569
No pressure plates good

1578
02:39:27,569 --> 02:39:31,459
What happened to this guy?

1579
02:39:31,459 --> 02:39:37,180
Oh burnt

1580
02:39:37,180 --> 02:39:39,020
10 not

1581
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:40,379
Why is there a timer?

1582
02:39:40,379 --> 02:39:43,280
Do they all turn back on?

1583
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:44,159
wait

1584
02:39:44,159 --> 02:39:46,159
three two one

1585
02:39:49,010 --> 02:40:00,819
What I it's all right. It's not the main mission. It's fine

1586
02:40:01,709 --> 02:40:04,829
What?

1587
02:40:04,829 --> 02:40:06,829
I I didn't know that. All right

1588
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:24,299
I thought that I was gonna turn them all back on again. I do have the cell phone which recruits people, right?

1589
02:40:29,309 --> 02:40:35,309
Uh doing bar fills more quickly easier to knock people through walls and you can't hit people you are aligned with

1590
02:40:36,110 --> 02:40:39,709
I think that's a really good one. If I were in the chat right now, I would be pressing three

1591
02:40:42,700 --> 02:40:45,020
That's if I was in the chat

1592
02:40:45,020 --> 02:40:48,100
If I was streaming the game

1593
02:40:48,100 --> 02:40:50,180
I wouldn't have to say because uh, you were in the chair

1594
02:40:50,739 --> 02:40:54,350
Stop me

1595
02:40:54,350 --> 02:40:56,350
Yeah, I mean come on that that's perfect. That is

1596
02:40:57,219 --> 02:41:08,139
Everything we're looking for nice. All right. So now

1597
02:41:09,260 --> 02:41:11,250
Let's go

1598
02:41:11,329 --> 02:41:12,370
Any

1599
02:41:12,370 --> 02:41:14,370

02:41:14,690 --> 02:41:17,010
Team members here destroy everything neutralize. All right

1601
02:41:20,129 --> 02:41:22,129
There's a red team member right there

1602
02:41:22,930 --> 02:41:29,889
Leave a gun or a knife

1603
02:41:29,889 --> 02:41:36,989
I don't know how I hit you through the wall. I really don't understand that. All right

1604
02:41:37,870 --> 02:41:44,190
two more

1605
02:41:44,190 --> 02:41:46,350
Destroy that mission in here

1606
02:41:47,069 --> 02:41:58,850
Let's just check it out retrieve the muffin from the bartender

1607
02:41:59,489 --> 02:42:01,489
Sure thing and i'm gonna recruit you

1608
02:42:02,719 --> 02:42:04,719
Join me both of you

1609
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:08,000
That's what i'm talking about

1610
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:11,260
So we're gonna get the muffin from the bartender

1611
02:42:11,659 --> 02:42:24,989
Should be easy with three of us. Let's go this way. I did kind of just go the long way, but it's all right

1612
02:42:26,979 --> 02:42:29,180
Hello

Uh, there's a chest in here though. Should I get it?

1617
02:42:54,290 --> 02:42:59,280
Not worth it. Let's turn this in

1618
02:43:00,590 --> 02:43:02,829
How many chicken nugget points do I have now? Probably a lot

1619
02:43:04,270 --> 02:43:06,590
At least like 30 or 40 right after this

1620
02:43:15,579 --> 02:43:19,229

How do I destroy it? I'm gonna do that last

1623
02:43:22,860 --> 02:43:26,000
That's gonna cause the most chaos

1624
02:43:26,239 --> 02:43:45,360
This is probably timed again

1625
02:43:45,360 --> 02:43:47,579
Do not enter

1626
02:43:47,579 --> 02:43:49,579

02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:50,739
Followers gain extra health and I don't get hurt by my own explosions

02:55:53,360 --> 02:55:57,969

I can handle this

1750
02:58:03,579 --> 02:58:05,579
You're just gonna get yourselves killed

1751
02:58:07,379 --> 02:58:08,659
Uh, all right

1752
02:58:08,659 --> 02:58:12,219

02:58:52,829 --> 02:58:56,799
Unbelievable

1761
02:58:56,799 --> 02:58:59,040
We only just you say stay we don't do anything

1762
02:58:59,680 --> 02:59:01,700
Okay

1763
02:59:01,700 --> 02:59:03,700
Four dolls i'm never opening another chest ever again

1764
02:59:04,260 --> 02:59:08,100
That was less than the other one

1765
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:18,719
Retrieve that

1766
02:59:18,719 --> 02:59:21,260
Should be able to go

1767
02:59:21,260 --> 02:59:23,260
Oh, that's what is that hacker?

1768
02:59:23,260 --> 02:59:26,959
hacking to any computer

1769
02:59:27,520 --> 02:59:29,579
Pretty nice

1770
02:59:29,579 --> 02:59:37,659
Okay, you i'm gonna let's do some distraction here. Whoa, hold on

1771
02:59:42,079 --> 02:59:43,680
All right you

1773
02:59:45,229 --> 02:59:46,909
the security camera

1774
02:59:46,909 --> 02:59:50,750
Oh, you can't I can't have you just attack the security camera

1775
02:59:51,389 --> 02:59:53,659
That's kind of annoying

1776
02:59:53,659 --> 02:59:57,760
He didn't he didn't even say let's go back here. All right

1777
03:00:00,139 --> 03:00:03,329
No way to open the door

03:00:03,329 --> 03:00:06,479
I have to blow it up

1779
03:00:06,479 --> 03:00:08,159
I can't even blow this up

1780
03:00:08,159 --> 03:00:51,260
I tried diplomacy. It didn't work hard hat shotgun ammo stealer or critter upper. Give me the shotgun, you know

1781
03:00:51,420 --> 03:01:10,180
What if it's a tie?

1782
03:01:10,180 --> 03:01:13,840
Uh, it probably does it again with the two that are highest maybe

1783
03:01:14,719 --> 03:01:15,840
or

1784
03:01:15,840 --> 03:01:17,200
I don't know

1785
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:21,280
All right, I got the shotgun

Uh, i'm gonna have them do the dirty work here and I don't want to take any damage

1794
03:02:15,250 --> 03:02:27,969
All of you get in there this job

1795
03:02:29,090 --> 03:02:29,889
Hey

03:02:29,889 --> 03:02:45,040
Okay, can you come with me?

1797
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:53,920
Where are the red?

1798
03:02:53,920 --> 03:03:01,600
Everything is five dollars always

1799
03:03:02,750 --> 03:03:04,829
Always five dollars no matter what

1800
03:03:05,469 --> 03:03:09,840
And i'm still missing these two

03:03:09,840 --> 03:03:38,500
Did anybody see them? I didn't see them anywhere. How these people down here

03:03:53,899 --> 03:03:56,079
Did I just walk by them at some point?

1804
03:03:56,319 --> 03:04:11,219
Why is this guy not following me?

1805
03:04:11,219 --> 03:04:27,579
They don't show up on the mini map do they?

1806
03:04:27,579 --> 03:04:29,579
Shit i'm gonna pee my pants. Aren't I?

They show up on the mini map if you already found them. All right, we're good

1814
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:21,969

Items in the shop cost less or melee attacks do times two damage from behind

1817
03:05:37,979 --> 03:05:39,500
I'll take any of these

1818
03:05:39,500 --> 03:05:42,379
Except i'm not really buying stuff from the store because i'm I don't know i'm not really doing that

1819
03:05:51,920 --> 03:05:55,629

03:05:57,819 --> 03:06:00,299
Which terrifying disaster should be follow your streamer?

1822
03:06:01,180 --> 03:06:03,180
Who's is spreading trying to touch it?

1823
03:06:03,659 --> 03:06:06,540
Zombies are on the level and a bounty is on the player's head

1824
03:06:10,559 --> 03:06:13,920
I don't know what we haven't seen any of these. It's always just here comes the robot. So

1825
03:06:14,719 --> 03:06:17,860
Apparently it's going to be zombies

1826
03:06:19,709 --> 03:06:23,790
I'm opening up the cell phone and i'm calling some friends the second this loads up

1827
03:06:24,750 --> 03:06:27,700
I'm using one of my phone friends here

1828
03:06:28,940 --> 03:06:36,930
I'm gonna die down here. The dead are restless. It's zombie time

1829
03:06:40,639 --> 03:06:43,440
I'm making a phone call

1830
03:06:43,440 --> 03:06:45,440
Yeah, i'm sorry. I'm not doing this shit

1831
03:06:45,600 --> 03:06:47,600

1834
03:06:50,829 --> 03:06:53,819
and then you

1835
03:06:53,819 --> 03:06:55,819

1836
03:06:56,209 --> 03:06:57,969
No, the shotgun's mine

1837
03:06:57,969 --> 03:07:00,690
You take the pistol

1838
03:07:00,690 --> 03:07:02,690
Still the freeze gun. All right, let's go

1839
03:07:03,709 --> 03:07:08,829
There's one red person and it's the person we have to kill so they're right here and then they get the item from the worker

1840
03:07:09,309 --> 03:07:10,270
Let's go

1841
03:07:10,270 --> 03:07:25,489
All right. That's not that's not horrible

1842
03:07:25,489 --> 03:07:27,489
I can deal with that. It's only like one at a time

1843
03:07:32,340 --> 03:07:33,940
never mind

1844
03:07:33,940 --> 03:07:35,520

1845
03:07:35,520 --> 03:07:38,879
Okay, let's just go in. Um, we're gonna just go get the item

1846
03:07:39,760 --> 03:07:48,379
Just I don't just get it

1847
03:07:48,379 --> 03:07:52,770
What happened? What's going on? Okay, uh

Jesus

1850
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:09,280
I only have one bullet left

1851
03:08:09,280 --> 03:08:19,280
So this kills ghosts. I haven't seen very many ghosts

1852
03:08:20,799 --> 03:08:22,639
I would love

1853
03:08:22,639 --> 03:08:24,000
All right. What do I do?

1854
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:31,329

1855
03:08:31,329 --> 03:08:32,209

1856
03:08:32,209 --> 03:08:35,729
Do I still have any people left?

1857
03:08:36,430 --> 03:08:40,479
uh

1858
03:08:40,479 --> 03:08:42,319

1863
03:08:55,809 --> 03:09:00,209
What are you doing? Oh, wait. No, no, no, no, they're turning into zombies. This is bad. Very bad

1864
03:09:01,010 --> 03:09:02,610
Oh shit

1866
03:09:06,020 --> 03:09:08,020
Oh god, this is horrible

03:09:08,020 --> 03:09:10,020
Somebody help somebody help me

1868
03:09:10,340 --> 03:09:13,100

1869
03:09:13,100 --> 03:09:14,700
Wait, they are ghosts

03:09:14,700 --> 03:09:23,979
They're tech they are they are ghosts. They're technically ghosts

1871
03:09:34,659 --> 03:09:47,950
No, stop fucking hurting me. Why would you fight me? It makes no sense

1872
03:09:52,350 --> 03:09:53,469

All right. I'm safe. I'm fine

1879
03:10:32,510 --> 03:10:35,920
Everything's good

1880
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:39,819
That was a little chaotic, but it's mine

1881
03:10:39,819 --> 03:10:42,059
I am going to keep the axe out

1882
03:10:43,200 --> 03:10:45,040
in the event

1883
03:10:45,040 --> 03:10:47,170
that

1884
03:10:47,170 --> 03:10:49,040
I just

1885
03:10:49,040 --> 03:10:51,120
Destroyed that guy and now he turned into a zombie

1886
03:10:52,299 --> 03:10:54,299
Which makes it even worse. All right, he's dead

1887
03:11:00,530 --> 03:11:05,860
This thing is too good. I'm not gonna use it. I mean

1888
03:11:09,389 --> 03:11:10,909
Just get me the hell out of here

1889
03:11:10,909 --> 03:11:16,819

1890
03:11:16,819 --> 03:11:18,899
Syringe i'm gonna take one of these. What's this one do?

1891
03:11:19,620 --> 03:11:30,750

1892
03:11:46,180 --> 03:11:48,770

03:11:48,770 --> 03:11:53,739
Everything's done

1894
03:11:53,739 --> 03:11:55,260
Take out the ghost gun

1895
03:11:55,260 --> 03:11:57,760
Just in case I run into anything

1896
03:11:58,159 --> 03:12:00,430
in the meantime

1897
03:12:00,430 --> 03:12:07,649
Yep

Are this going to keep coming back to life?

1902
03:12:35,329 --> 03:12:52,690
Done character unlocked cannibal big quest done for this levels can't hit people of your own class

1903
03:12:54,250 --> 03:12:59,069
Explosions caused by the player don't damage me and all map markers are filled to the beginning of levels

1904
03:13:00,420 --> 03:13:04,030
Not bad

1905
03:13:04,030 --> 03:13:06,030
And uh, let me go. I gotta go pee

1906
03:13:06,110 --> 03:13:10,739
Let me take this opportunity to actually go to the bathroom. It's been like three hours plus

1907
03:13:11,700 --> 03:13:13,940
I'm gonna go pee grabbing water

1908
03:13:14,020 --> 03:13:25,579
It's all positive. All right, please

03:13:32,989 --> 03:13:34,270
I'll be right back

1912
03:13:34,270 --> 03:16:33,950
Hello, I am back

1913
03:16:34,010 --> 03:16:38,680

1914
03:16:39,020 --> 03:16:41,389

So I can teleport to these things

1918
03:16:52,530 --> 03:16:57,709
Well, that's real convenient. I thought you could only teleport at the end

1919
03:17:01,549 --> 03:17:04,829
All right

1920
03:17:04,829 --> 03:17:05,870

1921
03:17:05,870 --> 03:17:07,229

1922
03:17:07,309 --> 03:17:08,670
In here

1923
03:17:08,670 --> 03:17:22,129
I want to do no. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I need friends before I do this. Should I call the number?

1924
03:17:23,520 --> 03:17:25,360
Maybe I should give the phone call

1925
03:17:25,360 --> 03:17:35,459
I didn't do anything. Who did that?

1926
03:17:35,459 --> 03:17:37,760
What I didn't do anything

1927
03:17:37,760 --> 03:17:40,159
Should you do grenade or grenade? Which one?

1928
03:17:48,379 --> 03:17:53,229
What does this do?

1929
03:17:53,229 --> 03:17:55,229
Is that just higher crit chance?

1930
03:17:55,309 --> 03:17:57,309
How does that work? I'm not sure

1931
03:17:57,469 --> 03:18:05,520
We're gonna find out

1932
03:18:05,520 --> 03:18:07,579
I've had it a couple times before

1933
03:18:07,579 --> 03:18:13,409
I want nothing to do with that. All right, so

1934
03:18:14,049 --> 03:18:16,739
Electro pill

1935
03:18:16,739 --> 03:18:18,559

I took too long probably. All right, let's go

1943
03:18:45,389 --> 03:18:47,950

1944

Why do I still have debt debt to who?

1979
03:23:09,819 --> 03:23:14,850
I just put money in there. There's no way it's not in there. He was a bank owner

1980
03:23:19,799 --> 03:23:23,340
Neutralize sure thing. Let's go with uh, something creative

There was no reason for that

1990
03:24:20,850 --> 03:24:27,489

03:24:27,489 --> 03:24:29,489

A leaf blower causes extreme noise pollution aggravating bedroom programmers the world over

2232
03:48:46,680 --> 03:48:48,680
But in this game, it creates a huge gust of wind

Hiring people cost less so don't do that

03:49:08,709 --> 03:49:11,110
Items purchased from vendors may be given to you for free

2237

I like this one

2238
03:49:17,479 --> 03:49:19,719
Hitting objects and walls doesn't make any noise

2239
03:49:20,520 --> 03:49:24,659
That's awesome

2240
03:49:24,659 --> 03:49:28,180

03:58:50,680 --> 03:58:52,450
flamethrower is pretty good

2344
03:58:52,450 --> 03:58:55,700
Here we go

2345
03:58:55,700 --> 03:59:00,819
I can't fire in here

2346
03:59:01,780 --> 03:59:05,030
Did I use the horn

2347
03:59:05,270 --> 03:59:07,270
All right. I gotta get in here and help

2348
03:59:07,350 --> 03:59:13,159
We're good. Didn't lose anybody. Did I?

2349
03:59:13,559 --> 03:59:15,729
You shouldn't come in here. I you came that was

2350
03:59:16,770 --> 03:59:18,770
Just leave leave leave leave leave him leave him. Look

2351
03:59:19,090 --> 03:59:29,840
How am I good? How am I good today?

2352
03:59:29,840 --> 03:59:31,840
How am I doing today? I'm good

2353
03:59:31,920 --> 03:59:33,440
I'm doing pretty well

2354
03:59:33,440 --> 03:59:37,399
How about you? You doing good?

2355
03:59:39,239 --> 03:59:57,079
Ow damn it that hurt a lot. Give me the key. Give me the key

2356
04:00:03,270 --> 04:00:14,739
You made amazing roasted potatoes

2357
04:00:17,360 --> 04:00:19,360
I haven't had roasted potatoes in a long time

2358
04:00:19,520 --> 04:00:25,729
I know that sounds really strange for someone to say that

2359
04:00:27,360 --> 04:00:29,360
But I don't I've never had

2360
04:00:30,500 --> 04:00:34,340
It's been probably like a few months since i've had roasted potatoes in the oven

2361
04:00:34,979 --> 04:00:48,899
It's not something I really make or eat, but I will take this lecture. Let's try it

2362
04:00:50,100 --> 04:00:52,100
Oh, I can't break these walls

2363
04:00:53,879 --> 04:00:56,040
Uh, I gotta go over here to the thief

2364
04:00:59,350 --> 04:01:00,870
Take the horn out

2365
04:01:00,870 --> 04:01:15,270
Can I like horn over here and have it blow up? This is just a noise maker after god

2366
04:01:16,520 --> 04:01:17,479
Oh

2367
04:01:17,479 --> 04:01:22,920
God damn it the stupid thing. I'm so stupid. I just have tunnel vision and look straight ahead

2368
04:01:25,319 --> 04:01:28,719
every time

2369
04:01:28,719 --> 04:01:30,239
And now

2370
04:01:30,239 --> 04:01:39,889
I can't even get over there

2371
04:01:39,889 --> 04:01:45,079
This sucks

2372
04:01:48,079 --> 04:02:09,920
Go that hurts a lot. Remember you are very smart

2373
04:02:10,479 --> 04:02:23,360
Hey, thanks

2374
04:02:23,360 --> 04:02:30,579
Hurt him

2375
04:02:30,579 --> 04:02:34,739
Fake message. That's fine. All right, let me get out

2376
04:02:39,520 --> 04:02:41,520
I don't care. It's gonna be five dollars. You all know it

2377
04:02:42,479 --> 04:02:47,590
I think something good

2378
04:02:47,590 --> 04:02:48,549
Ooh

2379
04:02:48,549 --> 04:02:55,139
I wonder how much that compounds on top

2380
04:03:00,340 --> 04:03:02,579
Either one of these are good

2381
04:03:02,579 --> 04:03:04,579
All three of them worth picking

2382
04:03:04,579 --> 04:03:21,219
three followers

2383
04:03:21,219 --> 04:03:24,850
Oh, no, oh do this right do this right

2384
04:03:27,409 --> 04:03:31,649
Shifting status effects players and npcs get new status effects every 10 seconds or ooze

2385
04:03:44,530 --> 04:03:46,770
Lots of riders are causing chaos in the street

2386
04:03:48,680 --> 04:03:50,680
Might need to use the phone on this one

2387
04:03:54,149 --> 04:04:01,299
Maybe it'll just run to the end

2388
04:04:01,299 --> 04:04:03,760
There are seven

2389
04:04:03,760 --> 04:04:06,260
Of them really?

2390
04:04:07,590 --> 04:04:09,670
Riot riot riot riot

2391
04:04:24,260 --> 04:04:26,440
Good. Let's give me the money

2392
04:04:26,440 --> 04:04:28,200
All right. I need to uh

Whatever

2398
04:05:03,670 --> 04:05:05,030
It's fine

2399
04:05:05,110 --> 04:05:10,020

2400
04:05:10,020 --> 04:05:12,319
I'm coming in clean it up. Don't worry

2401
04:05:12,639 --> 04:05:15,010
Papa Jeremy's got it under control

2402
04:05:15,649 --> 04:05:24,979
I got some stuff. I think I want to sell here banana field don't want to take enough inventory space

2403
04:05:26,719 --> 04:05:28,719

Okay, come here tom. I'm trying to get you to follow me around and you just keep whatever

2406
04:05:49,159 --> 04:05:52,549
We're on the same damn team. Anyways, who cares?

2407
04:05:53,350 --> 04:06:04,979
straight ahead

2408
04:06:04,979 --> 04:06:06,979
In this labyrinth here

2409
04:06:07,459 --> 04:06:16,159
I got the axe

2410
04:06:16,159 --> 04:06:17,940
wrench

2411
04:06:17,940 --> 04:06:19,940
Why did I hit the cop for that was stupid?

2412
04:06:29,489 --> 04:06:39,170
All right, can we relax gotta get in there?

2413
04:06:46,450 --> 04:06:51,809
Yeah the fuck away from me

2414
04:06:51,809 --> 04:06:54,870
Oh, no, the drug dealer is dead

2415
04:06:57,170 --> 04:06:59,090
I'm gonna take one of these syringes

2416
04:06:59,090 --> 04:07:08,180
That's why I should sell all of them. I just went in a full circle

2417
04:07:08,739 --> 04:07:12,149
How do I get in here?

2418
04:07:12,149 --> 04:07:13,510
All the way down here

2419
04:07:13,510 --> 04:07:21,139
How do I miss this?

2420
04:07:21,139 --> 04:07:23,139
Oh, that's like in a weird spot

2421
04:07:25,479 --> 04:07:27,479
Don't touch that. It's a pressure plate

2422
04:07:33,219 --> 04:07:35,219
Yeah

2423
04:07:36,100 --> 04:07:38,100
I deserve that. Oh, well

2424
04:07:38,500 --> 04:07:52,360
Damn it. I deserve that. Can't even pick up the cigarette. Can I again? I need an ammo crate

2425
04:08:00,180 --> 04:08:01,920
Hmm

2426
04:08:01,920 --> 04:08:17,479
I don't know

2427
04:08:17,479 --> 04:08:21,590
Killer thrower

2428
04:08:21,590 --> 04:08:28,200
Seems like that's going to be the one

2429
04:08:28,200 --> 04:08:30,200
Did you use the item voucher from last run?

2430
04:08:31,139 --> 04:08:33,139
Uh, yeah, I think so

2431
04:08:33,459 --> 04:08:35,459
Remember I got the underwear

04:08:39,569 --> 04:08:41,809
So that's it need two more. Where are they?

2433
04:08:42,770 --> 04:08:44,770

04:08:45,010 --> 04:08:56,079
What's that? No bartender dead

2435
04:09:05,670 --> 04:09:07,670
All right, let's do this

2436
04:09:07,670 --> 04:09:14,899
Did you say I think you stink?

2437
04:09:16,639 --> 04:09:18,159
I think you stink

2438
04:09:18,159 --> 04:09:23,159
Where's the last one over here?

2439
04:09:28,930 --> 04:09:31,750
I do not stink. I can promise you that

2440
04:09:34,020 --> 04:09:36,020
Come on, let me pac-man this guy damn it

2441
04:09:36,639 --> 04:09:44,129
Pac-man kill him

2442
04:09:44,129 --> 04:09:45,729
God damn it

2443
04:09:45,729 --> 04:09:47,489
Get over here

2444
04:09:47,489 --> 04:09:49,489
No, please

2445
04:09:55,780 --> 04:10:09,459
Somebody took a syringe and became invisible

2446
04:10:11,459 --> 04:10:12,819
Where are they?

2447
04:10:12,819 --> 04:10:14,659
All right. I'm out. Goodbye

2448
04:10:14,659 --> 04:10:20,340
Wait recruit this guy

2449
04:10:24,920 --> 04:10:26,920
Oh, please just get away from me

2450
04:10:27,559 --> 04:10:29,559
Okay, I can I can bring these recruits downstairs, right?

2451
04:10:34,420 --> 04:10:35,940
Just leave

2452
04:10:35,940 --> 04:10:37,540
No, not yet. Hold on

2453
04:10:37,540 --> 04:10:43,139
Somebody drop food

2454
04:10:43,139 --> 04:10:44,659
Help me up here, please

2455
04:10:44,659 --> 04:10:51,059
All right. Fuck it. Just leave. Okay guys this food available. Give it to me

2456
04:11:05,159 --> 04:11:06,760
Any food bad

2457
04:11:06,760 --> 04:11:09,159
I have plenty of money

2458
04:11:09,159 --> 04:11:12,319
There's nobody there. Just gotta do the two missions and get out

2459
04:11:15,239 --> 04:11:17,959
There is a level up soon. You're right. You're right. You're right. I should probably calm down

2460
04:11:27,139 --> 04:11:31,620
Can I wait? Can I use the wrench on this and make it so it doesn't do anything?

2461
04:11:32,739 --> 04:11:34,420
Can I just say

2462
04:11:34,420 --> 04:11:41,829
I feel like that would work

2463
04:11:41,829 --> 04:11:44,819
Can I do that?

2464
04:11:44,819 --> 04:11:46,610
Yes, right

2465
04:11:46,610 --> 04:11:47,809
Yes, you can

2466
04:11:47,809 --> 04:11:56,469
Oh god

2467
04:11:56,469 --> 04:12:21,170
I don't know what to do. I'm stuck. I have no idea what i'm gonna do. Oh, okay. I'm fine

2468
04:12:21,250 --> 04:12:23,809
Oh, thank god. I leveled up. Holy shit. That was horrible

2469
04:12:24,770 --> 04:12:39,409
Safe combination to get it

2470
04:12:39,409 --> 04:12:45,319
Well, i'm not gonna use this right now

2471
04:12:45,959 --> 04:12:48,520
I'm thinking I just sell that that's gonna kill me

2472
04:12:49,319 --> 04:12:53,799
I'm actually gonna die from that. I can probably guarantee it

2473
04:13:00,440 --> 04:13:02,440
You suck, but I like this stream

2474
04:13:02,680 --> 04:13:04,680
Well, thank hey, thanks

2475
04:13:04,760 --> 04:13:06,760
I appreciate that

2476
04:13:07,079 --> 04:13:12,200
Glad you like the stream welcome

2477
04:13:12,440 --> 04:13:14,520
If you like what you see

2478
04:13:14,520 --> 04:13:18,040
Then let's hang out

2479
04:13:18,200 --> 04:13:20,200
Not in real life. I mean just like here

2480
04:13:21,319 --> 04:13:24,260
I unlocked the shopkeeper

2481
04:13:24,260 --> 04:13:36,690
I finally got some more weapons. I feel safe now

2482
04:13:39,719 --> 04:13:41,559
Keep the baseball bat. All right

2483
04:13:41,559 --> 04:13:43,559
Now we gotta do uh over here

2484
04:13:45,010 --> 04:13:47,409
Get that worker

2485
04:13:47,409 --> 04:13:49,409
You know, I do want you

2486
04:13:49,809 --> 04:13:51,809
Come from the door, please

2487
04:13:53,559 --> 04:13:55,319
More bullshit over here

2488
04:13:55,319 --> 04:13:59,139
Of course

2489
04:13:59,139 --> 04:14:04,399
Can I come over? You're already here

2490
04:14:04,399 --> 04:14:09,059
You're already here

2491
04:14:09,059 --> 04:14:10,579
Just stay

2492
04:14:10,579 --> 04:14:16,319
You're just a free kill to whoever is over here

2493
04:14:22,680 --> 04:14:26,579
How do I do this without?

2494
04:14:26,579 --> 04:14:29,010
Um, how am I gonna do this?

2495
04:14:31,600 --> 04:14:32,959
I'm gonna blow it up

2496
04:14:32,959 --> 04:14:36,079
I can't open this

2497
04:14:36,079 --> 04:14:37,200
Stand back

2498
04:14:37,200 --> 04:14:50,559
You asshole just get out here

2499
04:14:50,639 --> 04:14:52,709
Good didn't have to blow it up

2500
04:14:52,709 --> 04:15:02,639
Out all these are pretty good except I don't use the door detonators

2501
04:15:03,200 --> 04:15:25,090
ever

2502
04:15:25,090 --> 04:15:26,770
hmm

2503
04:15:26,770 --> 04:15:28,770
Mini fridge is probably the best

2504
04:15:29,239 --> 04:15:34,290
That'll help me because then food will be more filling

2505
04:15:35,879 --> 04:15:42,690
That's it. I'm out

2506
04:15:42,690 --> 04:15:44,690
You idiot not you me

2507
04:15:45,649 --> 04:15:51,440
Let's get out

2508
04:15:51,520 --> 04:15:55,360
Nobody else is on this floor. What about wait? Hold on. I think there's a cell machine over here

2509
04:15:57,879 --> 04:15:59,879
All right, let me sell

2510
04:16:00,040 --> 04:16:03,219
This knife is worthless

2511
04:16:03,219 --> 04:16:05,459
I'm selling the syringes. I'm not going to use them

2512
04:16:06,260 --> 04:16:09,360
I haven't even what about the boombox? I've never even turned it on

2513
04:16:10,079 --> 04:16:22,340
I think i'm good

2514
04:16:22,340 --> 04:16:25,299
Sell the killer thrower. I feel like I could use that pretty well somewhere

2515
04:16:28,069 --> 04:16:31,909
Hitting walls and objects doesn't make any sound can't hit people of your own class

2516
04:16:32,469 --> 04:16:34,950
And can't hit most people you are aligned with

2517
04:16:35,909 --> 04:16:46,979
Good stuff. Oh those of you that weren't here tomorrow

2518
04:16:47,620 --> 04:16:50,120
Tomorrow, we're gonna do a comb stream

2519
04:16:51,569 --> 04:16:53,090
That's right

2520
04:16:53,090 --> 04:16:55,520
We're gonna do tier lists

2521
04:16:55,600 --> 04:16:57,860
flash games

2522
04:16:57,860 --> 04:16:59,700
And some other just bullshit

2523
04:16:59,700 --> 04:17:03,559
I got so addicted to doing those tier lists. I want to do them again

2524
04:17:04,120 --> 04:17:06,180
It's allowed to be tomorrow night

2525
04:17:06,180 --> 04:17:11,200
And if you're fairly new to the channel and you don't know what a comb stream is

2526
04:17:11,920 --> 04:17:12,959
uh

2527
04:17:12,959 --> 04:17:14,959
it's a stream where

2528
04:17:14,959 --> 04:17:19,440
I just put on the webcam and we just do like fuck all for like four or six hours

2529
04:17:20,159 --> 04:17:22,159
We just do whatever

2530
04:17:22,159 --> 04:17:36,690
All right. What do I want to do here? A lot of stuff to do. It's gonna go right at the front door

2531
04:17:37,409 --> 04:17:44,149
It's the streams where we get footage for our deep fakes

2532
04:17:48,239 --> 04:17:50,129
Probably true

2533
04:17:50,129 --> 04:17:53,219
Probably correct. All right, let's get right up here

2534
04:17:54,020 --> 04:17:58,420
It's the best way to get in here

2535
04:18:01,409 --> 04:18:04,069
I don't want to do this

2536
04:18:04,069 --> 04:18:06,069
Can I like honk on this and have it not work?

2537
04:18:08,209 --> 04:18:13,459
What about the wrench use wrench to deactivate

2538
04:18:16,790 --> 04:18:18,469
Minus 30

2539
04:18:18,469 --> 04:18:20,680
I can only do that once

2540
04:18:20,680 --> 04:18:25,540
I need a silent killer

2541
04:18:25,540 --> 04:18:29,059
This all makes way too much noise. Um

2542
04:18:29,700 --> 04:18:33,620
Okay, what if I like honk blast him through the own his own laser?

2543
04:18:36,209 --> 04:18:39,010
Kind of a little sort of sort of worked

2544
04:18:39,729 --> 04:18:42,870
Uh, do I have any of the melee weapons? No

2545
04:18:43,110 --> 04:18:50,280
Retreat the shit out of them

2546
04:18:50,280 --> 04:18:53,479
Oh fuck he got a bat. He's got a bat. He's got a bat. He's got a bat. He's got a bat. Shoot him in the head

2547
04:18:54,440 --> 04:19:00,959
Okay, i'm good the honk blast technique would have been pretty good

2548
04:19:03,840 --> 04:19:08,069
Will you eat five more mcchickens?

2549
04:19:09,540 --> 04:19:13,430
No, i'm gonna take a break from fast food

2550
04:19:15,719 --> 04:19:17,719
No more fast food for like a month

2551
04:19:18,040 --> 04:19:27,059
I don't eat it that often but

2552
04:19:27,219 --> 04:19:31,639
Lately, it's just been yeah. You know what? I want taco bell. I want mcchickens

2553
04:19:32,500 --> 04:19:38,659
There has not been a time in the last like month and a half where i've gone. Yeah, I want a cob salad

2554
04:19:39,959 --> 04:19:44,760
Oh kale sounds good today. No, that has to stop. I have to start to actually care about that

2555
04:19:45,479 --> 04:19:50,469
Okay, so there's two more

2556
04:19:50,870 --> 04:19:53,540
So you come with me

2557
04:19:53,540 --> 04:19:55,540
Safe back there just open it

2558
04:19:55,780 --> 04:19:58,879
Uh

2559
04:19:58,879 --> 04:20:02,479
I got no reason to go in there. He's got the key to that safe, but it's gonna be nothing in it

2560
04:20:03,120 --> 04:20:11,889
I haven't been eating unhealthy

2561
04:20:12,530 --> 04:20:14,530
I've just been craving

2562
04:20:14,930 --> 04:20:18,530
All the unhealthy stuff that doesn't mean i've been acting on it

2563
04:20:19,170 --> 04:20:23,379
All right, you got a job for me?

2564
04:20:25,889 --> 04:20:29,170
Neutralize the thief and can I buy food from you?

2565
04:20:31,430 --> 04:20:33,030
All you have is beers

2566
04:20:33,030 --> 04:20:52,200
I take them

2567
04:20:52,200 --> 04:21:05,440
pretty loud speakers

2568
04:21:05,440 --> 04:21:08,159
countries to visit on a vacation tier list

2569
04:21:09,719 --> 04:21:14,200
Yeah, if you guys got some good ones and uh compile some for tomorrow because how we did it last time

2570
04:21:14,200 --> 04:21:16,200
I just picked up random ones from the chat

2571
04:21:17,319 --> 04:21:20,280
So if you find some good ones, i'm gonna do a candy list

2572
04:21:21,239 --> 04:21:27,299
So if there's a good bunch of candies chocolates like skittles that type of thing

2573
04:21:28,100 --> 04:21:44,610
Is it worth the 15 hp that actually 30 hp to go in here? No

2574
04:21:48,389 --> 04:21:57,940
Definitely not. All right. Is my loud in here?

2575
04:22:01,299 --> 04:22:04,100
Clerk all right. What about you? Can I get food?

2576
04:22:05,889 --> 04:22:07,889
No, i'm not borrowing any more money

2577
04:22:08,850 --> 04:22:12,209
That ended very badly. All right, so I have to go all the way down in the corner here

2578
04:22:21,760 --> 04:22:24,290
Don't let him alert anybody good

2579
04:22:24,290 --> 04:22:27,729
All right, somebody go get that security camera. Wait, can I just turn off the wrench?

2580
04:22:28,530 --> 04:22:38,770
I got it too bad. It's still alerted everybody

2581
04:22:40,739 --> 04:22:47,909
Give me the bat

2582
04:22:48,290 --> 04:23:04,500
Disaster disaster. All right back to me back to me back to me great everyone you've ever met

2583
04:23:08,399 --> 04:23:10,159
uh

2584
04:23:10,159 --> 04:23:14,790
That's not gonna happen

2585
04:23:14,790 --> 04:23:16,870
I can't I don't even remember anybody i've ever met

2586
04:23:18,879 --> 04:23:20,879
Yeah, what am I talking about? Yes, I do

2587
04:23:22,899 --> 04:23:24,899
But hold on I could probably name you

2588
04:23:26,079 --> 04:23:28,559
I can name you at least like 30 or 40 people

2589
04:23:30,680 --> 04:23:32,870
Do that right now

2590
04:23:32,870 --> 04:23:34,879
Can you name?

2591
04:23:34,879 --> 04:23:36,959
Let's just say the last hundred people that you've met

2592
04:23:38,120 --> 04:23:39,639
I don't think you could

2593
04:23:39,639 --> 04:23:52,639
It would take a lot of thought

2594
04:23:52,639 --> 04:23:54,959
That's way too much. Yeah. Okay. What about the last 20?

2595
04:23:55,680 --> 04:23:59,379
And i'm talking that like met for the first time

2596
04:24:00,260 --> 04:24:02,260
Where was it and who were who was it?

2597
04:24:02,420 --> 04:24:06,319
Okay, I gotta kill everybody in here

2598
04:24:09,280 --> 04:24:12,159
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait all attack

2599
04:24:12,319 --> 04:24:13,760
Start with the goon

2600
04:24:13,760 --> 04:24:15,760
Neutralize the goon. Let's go

2601
04:24:19,540 --> 04:24:21,540
And then from behind the door

2602
04:24:22,100 --> 04:24:24,100
We just get a free shot here

2603
04:24:25,059 --> 04:24:27,559
You're done

2604
04:24:27,559 --> 04:24:32,360
Oh, don't not you you i'm gonna get ready, you know, we'll just do it with the wrench few times. No, what do I have?

2605
04:24:35,989 --> 04:24:40,079
We can just beat this guy up

2606
04:24:40,079 --> 04:24:42,690
open the doors

2607
04:24:42,690 --> 04:24:52,360
Got it, right. That's it. Three out of three. Let's move

2608
04:24:52,920 --> 04:24:59,190
You know, I actually I probably think I would have trouble with the last

2609
04:24:59,909 --> 04:25:01,909
Five people that I've ever met

2610
04:25:02,389 --> 04:25:05,030
And do this from behind the wall

2611
04:25:05,030 --> 04:25:13,030
All right, watch out back up

2612
04:25:13,590 --> 04:25:16,979
You fucking idiot

2613
04:25:18,819 --> 04:25:25,670
What is he doing?

2614
04:25:29,170 --> 04:25:51,280
No, no you were inside the fortnight circle you idiot we had him at least I won damn it

2615
04:26:00,370 --> 04:26:14,420
Thankfully didn't hit me. What the hell happened?

2616
04:26:16,639 --> 04:26:18,639
They were here. No, they're not

2617
04:26:19,200 --> 04:26:23,940
It was so unnecessary. I just took like 30 points of damage for no reason

2618
04:26:25,729 --> 04:26:27,250
I could just leave

2619
04:26:27,250 --> 04:26:45,219
Five nuggets ammo though

2620
04:26:46,180 --> 04:26:48,180
Assist me what no

2621
04:26:48,340 --> 04:26:51,350
I can do that for free

2622
04:26:51,350 --> 04:26:54,479
uh

2623
04:26:55,200 --> 04:26:57,760
I refilled the shotgun because I just wasted it all

2624
04:26:59,829 --> 04:27:03,299
Let's continue

2625
04:27:03,299 --> 04:27:04,899
Hello

2626
04:27:04,899 --> 04:27:06,659
Good good good

2627
04:27:06,659 --> 04:27:18,950
They're all good turn on the face cam. No, I don't do face cam

2628
04:27:20,739 --> 04:27:26,690
Unless it's tomorrow

2629
04:27:26,690 --> 04:27:43,569
If it's tomorrow, then yeah, there'll be a face cam. There we go

2630
04:27:44,129 --> 04:27:50,229
Which terrifying disaster war on the streets

2631
04:27:51,219 --> 04:27:56,840
Radiation rains down on all areas for every 20 seconds or a bounty is placed on my head

2632
04:28:00,149 --> 04:28:02,149
Now don't do war zone again

2633
04:28:02,629 --> 04:28:08,690
War zone is too random do the other one do this one. Don't do this one do one of these two

2634
04:28:08,850 --> 04:28:12,319
We haven't seen it yet

2635
04:28:12,319 --> 04:28:14,159
Two seconds. Come on

2636
04:28:14,159 --> 04:28:16,659
No

2637
04:28:16,659 --> 04:28:19,780
And it won two it won. I got shit for that before closing the poll early

2638
04:28:24,870 --> 04:28:29,989
It's a war. All right. Well, let's just go do the stuff. I need to do quickly

2639
04:28:30,709 --> 04:28:32,709
Like kill this person

2640
04:28:34,790 --> 04:28:37,510
I didn't really mean to do that now. He's running great. Come on. Come here

2641
04:28:38,629 --> 04:28:49,239
Oh shit, who's this?

2642
04:28:49,239 --> 04:28:51,239
All right, I need to neutralize this guy

2643
04:28:51,239 --> 04:28:58,920
I get him both actually. All right, we'll eat this

2644
04:29:00,639 --> 04:29:01,520
Really?

2645
04:29:01,520 --> 04:29:03,520
That sucks

2646
04:29:03,920 --> 04:29:06,610
Did I shoot a soldier I saw that I shot a soldier

2647
04:29:07,780 --> 04:29:09,809
That's bad

2648
04:29:09,809 --> 04:29:15,329
I have the whole team on me. Oh, what have I done? Oh, no, i'm freaking out. How do I teleport?

2649
04:29:20,129 --> 04:29:23,969
Oh my god. Oh my god. Why did I do that? What's fucking wrong with me?

2650
04:29:29,010 --> 04:29:34,959
Watch out for the train

2651
04:29:34,959 --> 04:29:38,639
I'm just I have to get out. All right, we gotta kill the guy up here and get that thing and leave

2652
04:29:39,280 --> 04:29:47,399
We're going here. Okay, get in there

2653
04:29:47,399 --> 04:29:56,579
Where's the other red guy?

2654
04:29:56,579 --> 04:29:57,459
Shit

2655
04:29:57,459 --> 04:30:01,170
Oh my fucking god

2656
04:30:01,170 --> 04:30:03,110
Killer thrower what I do

2657
04:30:03,110 --> 04:30:05,969
What's what's going on?

2658
04:30:05,969 --> 04:30:07,969
Let's go. I I killer thrower. I just

2659
04:30:08,370 --> 04:30:21,459
Be stupid. I can't believe I took that syringe. It doesn't do anything slow and confused. Great. I'm selling them every single time

2660
04:30:23,329 --> 04:30:25,329
every single fucking time

2661
04:30:29,360 --> 04:30:31,840
No, please please I have to aim the other way

2662
04:30:32,559 --> 04:30:49,430
Stay back

2663
04:30:49,430 --> 04:30:51,430
Oh, it's just okay. It's the butler

2664
04:30:51,510 --> 04:31:17,540
Do the axe I can get out of this

2665
04:31:17,940 --> 04:31:19,670
onto the park

2666
04:31:19,670 --> 04:31:30,229
Okay, so this is I activate it and then when I throw something they explode

2667
04:31:31,110 --> 04:31:39,040
I understand. This is probably the best

2668
04:31:39,680 --> 04:31:41,040
no ghosts

2669
04:31:41,040 --> 04:31:49,079
so the internet

2670
04:31:49,079 --> 04:31:52,920
This was kind of the first stream back to make sure that it works and to test it

2671
04:31:53,719 --> 04:31:56,680
It's been okay

2672
04:31:56,680 --> 04:31:58,049
I have

2673
04:31:58,049 --> 04:32:00,360
In four and a half hours

2674
04:32:00,360 --> 04:32:04,200
Just over like one percent drop frames. It hasn't really done been terrible

2675
04:32:05,729 --> 04:32:10,770
Could be way worse if you were here a few days ago like four or five days ago. It was unbearable. I couldn't even stream

2676
04:32:13,649 --> 04:32:15,649
Let's hope they continue to figure out what's going on

2677
04:32:16,950 --> 04:32:20,389
One percent is bad. Oh, yeah, it's bad, but it's better than like 30 percent

2678
04:32:20,549 --> 04:32:23,909
Which is what it was before and dropping to zero and the stream turns off

2679
04:32:27,729 --> 04:32:29,590
It's gonna keep happening

2680
04:32:29,590 --> 04:32:31,590
All I can do is deal with it

2681
04:32:31,989 --> 04:32:33,989
And try to get it fixed

2682
04:32:33,989 --> 04:32:35,270
so

2683
04:32:35,270 --> 04:32:38,469
At least I can have my screen be on and not just turn the damn thing off

2684
04:32:39,270 --> 04:32:42,979
All right. Here we go. Now I gotta do

2685
04:32:43,620 --> 04:32:45,620
Everything is clear. Everything's done. Give me up

2686
04:32:53,780 --> 04:32:56,020
Yeah, forget it. Holy shit. Who are you?

2687
04:33:08,740 --> 04:33:10,740
He jinxed it he started saying the words

2688
04:33:12,310 --> 04:33:17,439
If you say the if you say cox in a row as the word is spelled out

2689
04:33:19,040 --> 04:33:21,040
Your internet starts to turn off

2690
04:33:22,770 --> 04:33:26,049
All right, this is gonna be bad. I haven't gotten past the floor one here. Have I?

2691
04:33:28,770 --> 04:33:30,770
I'll take a soldier. Can I recruit you?

2692
04:33:30,930 --> 04:33:34,439
It's worth it

2693
04:33:34,439 --> 04:33:36,439
No, it wasn't why the hell did I do that?

2694
04:33:37,139 --> 04:33:39,139
I thought that was one soldier

2695
04:33:39,139 --> 04:33:41,220
No, actually that was worth it. I'm glad I did that

2696
04:33:45,619 --> 04:33:47,619
I have I put the jukebox down

2697
04:33:47,700 --> 04:33:55,700
Why is it not dancing?

2698
04:33:56,500 --> 04:34:01,889
Oh, no

2699
04:34:01,889 --> 04:34:40,659
Uh, there's a crazy person in that bush. He's gonna run out with an axe. What's going on?

2700
04:34:53,110 --> 04:34:54,790
Why is he dancing

2701
04:34:54,790 --> 04:35:00,229
He's the only person that's dancing out of all the people that we're able to dance. It's him dancing great

2702
04:35:01,189 --> 04:35:09,680
Okay, the axe is the best

2703
04:35:09,680 --> 04:35:13,400
three out of three dead

2704
04:35:13,400 --> 04:35:14,599
chest

2705
04:35:14,599 --> 04:35:20,849
That's good, too

2706
04:35:20,849 --> 04:35:23,250
Jerma go in the water go in the water. That's not gonna go in the water

2707
04:35:25,090 --> 04:35:27,540
That would be a mistake

2708
04:35:27,540 --> 04:35:29,220
Oh shopkeeper

2709
04:35:29,220 --> 04:35:30,180
Nice

2710
04:35:30,180 --> 04:35:33,509
I still have to do the two missions. Okay

2711
04:35:33,830 --> 04:35:36,200
Can I buy stuff from you, please?

2712
04:35:38,259 --> 04:35:40,099

2713
04:35:40,099 --> 04:35:41,459

2715
04:35:43,810 --> 04:35:45,090
taser

2716
04:35:45,090 --> 04:35:46,680
can't afford

2717
04:35:46,680 --> 04:35:53,000
What does the muscle pill do?

2718
04:35:53,000 --> 04:35:56,200
so activate that and just use the axe and just swing around in a circle

2719
04:35:57,000 --> 04:36:04,919
Watch out for

2720
04:36:04,919 --> 04:36:06,919
There are vampires in this game, too

2721
04:36:09,409 --> 04:36:10,369
Why?

2722
04:36:10,369 --> 04:36:17,840
Why are there vampires?

2723
04:36:18,159 --> 04:36:20,159
Okay, the vampires are hostile to me

2724
04:36:20,720 --> 04:36:33,590
All right. I've had just about enough of this shit

2725
04:36:34,229 --> 04:37:09,689
Which one too bad that wasn't a rocket launcher in castlevania

2726
04:37:10,790 --> 04:37:13,729
That is too bad

2727
04:37:13,729 --> 04:37:16,529
Well, you had the holy water, right? Did you throw the flaming holy water?

2728
04:37:17,250 --> 04:37:30,419
Thanks for the four leaf clover

2729
04:37:30,500 --> 04:37:31,680
Okay

2730
04:37:31,680 --> 04:37:32,880

2731
04:37:32,880 --> 04:37:35,599
Just have to rescue this person and get 37 bucks and then get out

2741
04:38:26,709 --> 04:38:30,150
Probably the wrench too

2742
04:38:30,150 --> 04:38:33,299
Can I sell the clover?

2743
04:38:33,299 --> 04:38:36,049
Put the silencer on the pistol

2744
04:38:36,290 --> 04:38:43,970

2746
04:38:57,479 --> 04:39:02,529
Left click to be okay. There we go

2747
04:39:02,529 --> 04:39:04,529
Go in the purple water

2748
04:39:05,330 --> 04:39:08,130
Is the most horseshit thing i've ever heard

2749
04:39:08,689 --> 04:39:11,970
You want me to go in this water and it's gonna heal me. Sure. Okay

2750
04:39:13,919 --> 04:39:15,360
If this poisons me

2751
04:39:15,360 --> 04:39:17,360
I get 5000 subs

2752
04:39:19,319 --> 04:39:21,319
Oh, never mind. I don't get anything

2753
04:39:24,450 --> 04:39:25,490
Oh well

2754
04:39:25,490 --> 04:39:27,490
I don't get it

2755
04:39:27,490 --> 04:39:45,909
What are you so happy about?

2756
04:39:45,909 --> 04:39:52,630
We get 5000 now

2757
04:39:52,709 --> 04:39:58,290
Syringe? No. All right, let's go up here. I can't believe that's real

2758
04:40:02,689 --> 04:40:10,040
Honk come on out this sword

2759
04:40:19,360 --> 04:40:21,360
Seven dollars. Wow

2760
04:40:23,380 --> 04:40:25,380
That's a lot of money

2761
04:40:25,380 --> 04:40:27,380
He's a gun. Don't he? Oh yes, he does

2762
04:40:28,389 --> 04:40:29,270
bruh

2763
04:40:29,270 --> 04:40:57,540
How did that miss? Let's go

2764
04:41:01,860 --> 04:41:04,659
Poison the water. No, don't don't don't don't do that. Don't do that

2765
04:41:04,900 --> 04:41:08,130
I would have

2766
04:41:08,130 --> 04:41:11,909
fuck

2767
04:41:14,439 --> 04:41:16,439
I want to go into the water

2768
04:41:16,520 --> 04:41:40,470
Where to go? Oh, the jukebox is still down there. Okay

2769
04:41:45,810 --> 04:41:49,169
Uh-oh, i'm overstaying my welcome in here. What happens when it gets to zero?

2770
04:41:49,970 --> 04:42:00,439
Is it doesn't a bad thing, right?

2771
04:42:00,439 --> 04:42:02,049
zero

2772
04:42:02,049 --> 04:42:03,330
No, okay

2773
04:42:03,330 --> 04:42:08,639
You can make a custom class in this game. That's pretty cool

2774
04:42:10,200 --> 04:42:16,840
Yeah, I do want to say after this I don't want to see what I have unlocked watch out for cannibals

2775
04:42:17,319 --> 04:42:21,040
There's one over there

2776
04:42:21,040 --> 04:42:31,009
And we're good floor clear

2777
04:42:33,159 --> 04:42:35,159
Three chicken nuggets good

2778
04:42:41,939 --> 04:42:48,639
Oh pretty good. Can this game be a common stream choice from now on?

2779
04:42:49,680 --> 04:42:51,680
Um, I don't know. I'm just kind of just playing it

2780
04:42:53,319 --> 04:42:55,319
Ever since it released I've wanted to check it out

2781
04:42:55,799 --> 04:42:58,040
I'm not sure if I would do this all the time

2782
04:42:58,360 --> 04:43:02,389
There's a lot of content here though

2783
04:43:02,470 --> 04:43:05,919
You could put a lot of time into this

2784
04:43:11,080 --> 04:43:14,049
That means so that means no

2785
04:43:14,049 --> 04:43:17,939
I didn't say that I said you could put a lot of time into this

2786
04:43:22,180 --> 04:43:28,610
All right. We got a bunch of stuff over here. We're gonna neutralize some people get that chest. I'll go for it

2787
04:43:28,770 --> 04:43:31,159
sure

2788
04:43:31,159 --> 04:43:33,639
What the hell are these? All right, there's killer plants now

2789
04:43:34,439 --> 04:43:43,880
I'm kind of curious. What does that mean? What does a killer plant mean?

2790
04:43:44,840 --> 04:43:54,560
Can I pick it up? Can I have a killer plant?

2791
04:43:55,200 --> 04:43:59,750
What does this do? It's not

2792
04:44:00,229 --> 04:44:11,639
Okay, there's no reason me to do this. It's just a chest over here sugar

2793
04:44:17,319 --> 04:44:18,599
Speeds you up

2794
04:44:18,599 --> 04:44:21,139
Okay

2795
04:44:21,139 --> 04:44:23,060
Interesting. Give me the

I need some new weapons

2797
04:44:25,119 --> 04:44:32,959
My guns are low

2798
04:44:32,959 --> 04:44:38,529
Shit could have seen you coming from a mile away, but i'm stupid

2799
04:44:39,090 --> 04:44:51,270
You shouldn't be that big of a problem. What do I got rocket launcher right in the front door?

2800
04:45:07,619 --> 04:45:09,220
That was pretty good

2801
04:45:09,220 --> 04:45:18,470
No, no mystery item. Let's do a ski thing though. Cool. All right weapons, right?

2802
04:45:19,430 --> 04:45:23,590
I'm gonna buy the sandwich. Yeah, i'm gonna buy both the heels

2803
04:45:24,639 --> 04:45:26,080
I need them

2804
04:45:26,080 --> 04:45:30,229
All right. Next is

2805
04:45:30,310 --> 04:45:34,819
I'm not doing that

2806
04:45:37,009 --> 04:45:46,099
I'll use a knife until it's gone clone machine

2807
04:45:48,040 --> 04:45:51,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, what am I cloning? I don't want to clone anything. Stop

2808
04:45:51,799 --> 04:45:54,900
No, what are you doing? Stop

2809
04:45:54,900 --> 04:45:56,900
No, I want to go in the door

2810
04:45:57,459 --> 04:46:02,450
I almost just stepped right on that

2811
04:46:09,810 --> 04:46:19,799
Moron already there three

2812
04:46:26,689 --> 04:46:44,689
Ready to go shit. Well, there are the three

2813
04:46:45,330 --> 04:46:49,569
All right, i'm gonna be careful gonna come down here. They're gonna die

2814
04:46:50,290 --> 04:46:59,360
No, i'll get them shit

2815
04:47:11,990 --> 04:47:13,029
Oh

2816
04:47:13,029 --> 04:47:20,290
He has to die

2817
04:47:20,290 --> 04:47:36,290
Only one more thing to do in the right side and this is the other guy here and then I can get out

2818
04:47:37,840 --> 04:47:39,840
Most of the end of this, uh this area

2819
04:47:43,560 --> 04:47:44,840
Yeah, this is it

2820
04:47:44,840 --> 04:47:51,830
Then there's the third level and then the the fourth area which is something we've not seen yet

2821
04:47:52,930 --> 04:47:55,459
Wonder what it is. I don't know find out

2822
04:47:56,020 --> 04:47:57,479
Give me the gun

2823
04:47:57,479 --> 04:48:05,430
What do you got?

2824
04:48:05,430 --> 04:48:08,770
Give me beers

2825
04:48:08,770 --> 04:48:12,659
Watch out for the bear traps and where do you go up here?

2826
04:48:13,619 --> 04:48:21,729
Where the hell are you? Where'd he go? Down there?

2827
04:48:23,169 --> 04:48:24,689
He needs one bullet

2828
04:48:24,689 --> 04:48:28,340
What the hell is he?

2829
04:48:28,340 --> 04:48:32,200
Is he hiding in a bush?

2830
04:48:32,200 --> 04:48:33,959
Oh, it's the

2831
04:48:33,959 --> 04:48:35,720
Other one up there

2832
04:48:35,720 --> 04:48:49,080
Pretty good. Oh, this is gonna be pain in the ass

2833
04:48:49,560 --> 04:48:51,080
These guys are all armed

2834
04:48:51,080 --> 04:48:56,200
I'm gonna have to go for it

2835
04:48:56,520 --> 04:49:20,099
Great got it. Uh

2836
04:49:20,819 --> 04:49:52,200
Give me the I don't know. I don't know. Okay. I have no idea. They're all good. Good choice. Good choice

2837
04:49:52,439 --> 04:50:06,689
I can leave right? Yeah, that's it. There's other stuff dying

2838
04:50:08,689 --> 04:50:15,580
Bombs dropping hidden bombs or killer robot

2839
04:50:26,770 --> 04:50:31,750
Is it gonna be three for three

2840
04:50:31,750 --> 04:50:44,150
These are all terrible

2841
04:50:44,150 --> 04:50:52,659
Where is he over there?

2842
04:50:52,659 --> 04:50:57,750
All right. I kind of got straight up in the middle. All right, let me get a freeze ray. Just go

2843
04:50:58,630 --> 04:51:04,959
I have to go quick

2844
04:51:04,959 --> 04:51:07,520
Do I not have anything I can destroy the buckets with?

2845
04:51:08,159 --> 04:51:26,450
He did it for me. Can I turn this off with a wrench? How do I turn? How do I do this without getting hurt?

2846
04:51:27,650 --> 04:51:30,689
Oh fuck i'm in trouble. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm gonna die

2847
04:51:35,360 --> 04:51:37,360
I just unlocked a new character

2848
04:51:39,060 --> 04:51:40,099
No

2849
04:51:40,099 --> 04:51:42,099
God damn it. Oh

2850
04:51:45,639 --> 04:51:50,200
Stupid poison barrels, I can't destroy them unless I fucking smash them

2851
04:51:50,840 --> 04:51:59,409
I'm going home. That's so aggravating

2852
04:51:59,970 --> 04:52:13,439
I gotta walk up and punch this thing because I don't have any bullets left

2853
04:52:14,240 --> 04:52:17,360
All the while a robot's just walking down with a rocket launcher

2854
04:52:20,000 --> 04:52:21,119
bullshit

2855
04:52:21,119 --> 04:52:30,200
Give me this thing

2856
04:52:30,200 --> 04:52:32,040
Oh, I like that too

2857
04:52:32,040 --> 04:52:38,080
All right. I'm doing a new character

2858
04:52:38,080 --> 04:52:44,599
Let's see who we have

2859
04:52:44,599 --> 04:52:45,639
cannibal

2860
04:52:45,639 --> 04:52:56,209
Feast on corpses to gain health human meat is the only food that can restore your health alcohol works, too

2861
04:52:57,439 --> 04:53:00,959
Business owners want you to leave most people won't join your party

2862
04:53:01,759 --> 04:53:05,029
So I have to eat dead bodies

2863
04:53:05,029 --> 04:53:07,779
What was the other ones I got bartender?

2864
04:53:09,119 --> 04:53:12,000
Serve cocktails to anyone like it's your job or something

2865
04:53:12,560 --> 04:53:14,200
Okay

2866
04:53:14,200 --> 04:53:16,200
Most people are initially friendly toward you

2867
04:53:16,680 --> 04:53:18,680
Enter some private property without an issue

2868
04:53:19,479 --> 04:53:23,540
Three followers can follow you and all syringes are identified

2869
04:53:26,049 --> 04:53:27,720
interesting

2870
04:53:27,720 --> 04:53:30,389
shopkeeper

2871
04:53:30,389 --> 04:53:34,630
Recognizes that everything has a price can purchase items from anyone at marked up prices

2872
04:53:35,959 --> 04:53:37,959
And items in the shop cost less

2873
04:53:40,659 --> 04:53:42,659
So you can purchase anything from anybody

2874
04:53:42,819 --> 04:53:51,349
I think anybody else I feel like I got somebody else. Let's try the cannibal

2875
04:53:58,080 --> 04:54:00,229
That's fine

2876
04:54:00,229 --> 04:54:04,799
wait

2877
04:54:04,799 --> 04:54:07,860
So I have to eat people I can only eat human meat and nobody likes me

2878
04:54:13,490 --> 04:54:15,680
so is this just like a

2879
04:54:15,680 --> 04:54:19,700
murder run

2880
04:54:19,700 --> 04:54:21,700
Okay, eat a certain type of person

2881
04:54:22,659 --> 04:54:27,349
Eat a doctor

2882
04:54:27,349 --> 04:54:31,479
Well, you're all safe

2883
04:54:31,479 --> 04:54:51,319
Create a character next time. Okay, I will it's a lot of money. Okay, eat. How do I eat them?

2884
04:54:54,520 --> 04:54:55,799
I'm stuffed

2885
04:54:55,799 --> 04:55:00,279
Oh, it's right click

2886
04:55:00,279 --> 04:55:04,520
So it heals. Okay, that's pretty ridiculous. All right, eat a doctor. Okay, there's doctors in here

2887
04:55:05,479 --> 04:55:07,479
So let's go eat a doctor

2888
04:55:07,720 --> 04:55:18,610
All right. Well, that's

2889
04:55:18,610 --> 04:55:21,889
Actually, really really really really good of a perk

2890
04:55:22,610 --> 04:55:32,500
All right, let's go do the missions

2891
04:55:32,500 --> 04:55:34,180
Do both in a row

2892
04:55:34,180 --> 04:55:38,020
Destroy and retrieve let's go this way

2893
04:55:40,610 --> 04:56:01,810
First no, we'll do this one first reward. All right friend phone

2894
04:56:02,450 --> 04:56:04,450
melee durability spray

2895
04:56:04,770 --> 04:56:16,610
That'd be good to the axe

2896
04:56:16,610 --> 04:56:18,849
More cannibals does it actually call other cannibals?

2897
04:56:19,490 --> 04:56:22,680
That'd be kind of funny actually

2898
04:56:22,680 --> 04:56:37,270
I'll just eat them

2899
04:56:37,270 --> 04:56:41,799
Is there a certain amount of people I can eat in one map or does it not matter?

2900
04:56:42,439 --> 04:56:45,880
We're traps too. All right. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving look

2901
04:56:46,599 --> 04:56:48,200
You can watch me leave

2902
04:56:48,200 --> 04:56:50,200
I don't know how to get out. Where's the exit?

2903
04:56:50,599 --> 04:56:54,740
I'm gone. I'm gone. I'm out

2904
04:56:56,479 --> 04:56:57,939
You whiffed

2905
04:56:57,939 --> 04:56:59,939
I'm gone. Leave me alone

2906
04:57:00,630 --> 04:57:02,630
Leave me alone. Look, I don't want to kill you

2907
04:57:03,110 --> 04:57:05,669
Look, I don't want to have to knock you out. Okay, but I will

2908
04:57:06,709 --> 04:57:20,959
This guy is mad

2909
04:57:23,909 --> 04:57:37,349
Yeah, that's right run away. Hi hamburger. No, I sell it I eat people

2910
04:57:42,959 --> 04:57:57,990
Shit nice. I'll take it. This is gonna be interesting though because I have to destroy this. Um, okay

2911
04:57:58,709 --> 04:58:02,880
How does one get in there?

2912
04:58:02,880 --> 04:58:05,200
annoyed, um

2913
04:58:05,200 --> 04:58:06,959
I can just break through

2914
04:58:06,959 --> 04:58:14,849
It's not really a reliable way to do this unless I

2915
04:58:16,319 --> 04:58:19,909
Maybe hold on. Oh shit

2916
04:58:21,830 --> 04:58:24,389
All right, I can do it

2917
04:58:24,389 --> 04:58:30,389
Did you actually see me? No, you didn't

2918
04:58:30,389 --> 04:58:32,880
No, no, no get out

2919
04:58:33,360 --> 04:58:42,439
Floor clear have a lot. We're good ate the doctor next level

2920
04:58:44,790 --> 04:58:46,790
I unlock the shape shifter

2921
04:58:49,439 --> 04:58:50,880
Don't know what that does

2922
04:58:50,880 --> 04:59:03,560
There are a lot of characters

2923
04:59:03,560 --> 04:59:16,799
Shape shifter is great

2924
04:59:16,799 --> 04:59:21,970
What are you giving me?

2925
04:59:21,970 --> 04:59:29,029
Hmm. All those were kind of not super great for this character

2926
04:59:31,990 --> 04:59:35,380
All right, eat a cop

2927
04:59:35,380 --> 04:59:37,380
And do all these other missions. Okay

2928
04:59:39,479 --> 04:59:43,959
Eat a cop

2929
04:59:43,959 --> 04:59:45,639
Hey, all right

2930
04:59:45,639 --> 04:59:51,590
Nobody get in

2931

Yeah, fuck it. Just come here

2933
04:59:57,119 --> 04:59:59,169
Tell me to leave

2934
04:59:59,169 --> 05:00:01,169
Yeah, get out of here

2935
05:00:02,290 --> 05:00:49,490
Grenade hacking tool boombox or mini fridge i'm currently resisting bullets, which is a good thing pretty split

2936
05:00:49,889 --> 05:00:51,889
like boombox it is

2937
05:00:51,889 --> 05:01:06,259
I like this character. This character is really good. All right, I gotta eat a cop

2938
05:01:11,970 --> 05:01:14,950
I don't like bananas

2939
05:01:14,950 --> 05:01:16,950
I only like humans

2940
05:01:20,279 --> 05:01:22,450
But it's free money

2941
05:01:24,869 --> 05:01:29,669
Retrieve the incriminating photo from the worker over here

2942
05:01:30,470 --> 05:01:38,119
I'll try

2943
05:01:38,119 --> 05:01:40,119
The alcohol still is good though, right? Yeah

2944
05:01:51,880 --> 05:01:54,369
Front door. Yeah

2945
05:01:54,610 --> 05:02:05,330
I'm just gonna wrench

2946
05:02:05,330 --> 05:02:06,930
Oh shit

2947
05:02:06,930 --> 05:02:07,810
Oh

2948
05:02:07,810 --> 05:02:09,169
It hurts

2949
05:02:09,169 --> 05:02:17,590
I need to feed on more people. Okay, I gotta eat you

2950
05:02:25,349 --> 05:02:27,509
You better stop that. Oh, I gotta eat that cop

2951
05:02:35,409 --> 05:02:39,990
How am I gonna do this though bear trap? I'm gonna put like three bear traps down like right here

2952
05:02:40,790 --> 05:02:45,110
Okay

2953
05:02:45,110 --> 05:03:01,299
Done. Can I pick these back up? No. Oh, well very cool

2954
05:03:02,020 --> 05:03:09,220
Turn this in

2955
05:03:09,220 --> 05:03:13,860
These guys they're not hostile, right? I keep thinking of for some reason i'm playing so much on the gang character

2956
05:03:19,319 --> 05:03:21,000
All right. Now i've done that

2957
05:03:21,000 --> 05:03:23,240
Have to do these two up here and let's go

2958
05:03:23,880 --> 05:03:35,159
I'm just gonna go in break the window and just get it

2959
05:03:38,229 --> 05:03:41,799
Goodbye

2960
05:03:41,799 --> 05:03:43,080
No cop, right?

2961
05:03:43,080 --> 05:03:52,979
Health is not a problem with this character. So i'm it's all right

2962
05:03:53,700 --> 05:04:00,450
And then across the way wait, wait, wait, what's up here? Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

2963
05:04:04,150 --> 05:04:05,349
Uh

2964
05:04:05,349 --> 05:04:11,409
Let's eat them both

2965
05:04:11,409 --> 05:04:19,479
Here comes one man spam

2966
05:04:21,400 --> 05:04:34,930
Cut that out

2967
05:04:34,930 --> 05:04:46,150
Final break out these two good. All right. How do I do this without getting in trouble?

2968
05:04:47,110 --> 05:04:54,790
I don't it was that easy

2969
05:04:55,750 --> 05:05:07,540
Break them out and then eat them. Well, I don't need to my health is fine. Good to go

2970
05:05:08,099 --> 05:05:17,240
I want to start playing this game again

2971
05:05:17,319 --> 05:05:18,520
Oh

2972
05:05:18,520 --> 05:05:21,080
That's one this one this one this one this one this one do this one

2973
05:05:25,169 --> 05:05:29,169
Bodies are cannibalized faster. There's nothing else that matters. Just press one

2974
05:05:33,750 --> 05:05:35,029
No, it's fun game

2975
05:05:35,029 --> 05:05:39,650
There's a lot to do

2976
05:05:39,650 --> 05:05:45,270
Kind of keeps the carrot on the stick in front of you with all the unlocks and all the perks you buy and stuff

2977
05:05:48,080 --> 05:05:51,220
That's good. Oh, here we go

2978
05:05:52,599 --> 05:05:54,840
Who's bombs dropping or riot?

2979
05:05:57,090 --> 05:06:00,849
We've seen riot. We've not seen ooze or bombs dropping

2980
05:06:02,529 --> 05:06:04,529
But it is chat. So

2981
05:06:05,490 --> 05:06:07,490
Chances are they're gonna pick the one

2982
05:06:09,840 --> 05:06:14,400
We're never gonna see off there's an equal amount of fight against that

2983
05:06:15,830 --> 05:06:17,509
Yeah, we're gonna see ooze

2984
05:06:17,509 --> 05:06:19,509
Ooze is spreading. Don't touch it

2985
05:06:19,590 --> 05:06:28,720
I get the curve go

2986
05:06:29,400 --> 05:06:31,400
Don't touch the ooze

2987
05:06:39,909 --> 05:06:41,349
Eat a goon

2988
05:06:41,349 --> 05:06:51,520
And then there's two things up there. Okay goon eat a goon. Oh god, come on

2989
05:06:54,240 --> 05:06:58,639
See how long this takes

2990
05:06:58,639 --> 05:07:01,680
That's much faster. All right, cool. Let's open the uh, let's open it. What about

2991
05:07:01,840 --> 05:07:03,040
Oh

2992
05:07:03,040 --> 05:07:10,840
Goon eaten. Oh, I don't see very much ooze

2993
05:07:11,560 --> 05:07:16,549
Anybody see any ooze that guy's a gun

2994
05:07:16,869 --> 05:07:33,830
Can I use guns? Yeah

2995
05:07:34,069 --> 05:07:37,330
Why am I acting like I can't use it?

2996
05:07:37,409 --> 05:07:42,180
Turns out this one sucks

2997
05:07:42,180 --> 05:07:49,319
I don't see any danger at all

2998
05:07:49,319 --> 05:07:51,319
These are ooze. I don't see ooze

2999
05:07:55,119 --> 05:07:57,119
No, this is safe

3000
05:07:57,119 --> 05:08:04,099
I do have to get rid of these though

3001
05:08:06,150 --> 05:08:08,389
Turn around

3002
05:08:08,389 --> 05:08:12,770
Look at the map

3003
05:08:12,770 --> 05:08:22,979
This down here

3004
05:08:22,979 --> 05:08:25,299
Oh, it is spreading up here. I'm really far away though

3005
05:08:25,860 --> 05:08:37,889
I'll be done with this by the time it gets up here

3006
05:08:38,369 --> 05:08:47,110
We're good

3007
05:08:47,110 --> 05:08:50,310
Oh god. Oh fuck. Oh god. Oh fuck the ooze

3008
05:08:56,479 --> 05:08:58,819
No, I can see it. No, it's the darker

3009
05:08:59,619 --> 05:09:01,060
gray on the mini map

3010
05:09:01,060 --> 05:09:20,319
The ooze approach it. I'm gonna go look at it

3011
05:09:21,119 --> 05:09:24,040
Because i'm done

3012
05:09:24,040 --> 05:09:26,439
I ate a goon. I did everything I needed to do. Yeah

3013
05:09:27,700 --> 05:09:29,459
I kind of want to look at it

3014
05:09:29,459 --> 05:09:32,229
I'm curious

3015
05:09:32,229 --> 05:09:44,759
What does it look like?

3016
05:09:44,759 --> 05:09:46,759
Okay, it is just creeping

3017
05:09:47,619 --> 05:09:49,220
Does it kill people?

3018
05:09:49,220 --> 05:10:01,009
Is it gonna wipe out this whole bar? It's not even going in the bar

3019
05:10:01,650 --> 05:10:08,360
Oh, well, it's too dangerous to teleport. Why?

3020
05:10:13,919 --> 05:10:16,659
Touch it. It's safe

3021
05:10:16,659 --> 05:10:22,020
Nope

3022
05:10:22,020 --> 05:10:24,020
Eat a slum dweller

3023
05:10:24,599 --> 05:10:26,599
That should be pretty easy

3024
05:10:39,490 --> 05:10:40,930
Oh shit, i'm not hurt

3025
05:10:40,930 --> 05:10:42,369
No, there we go. I'm good

3026
05:10:42,369 --> 05:10:49,040
What do these power bucks shut down the power box?

3027
05:10:51,409 --> 05:10:53,409
Well, now we gotta eat a couple of cops

3028
05:10:54,369 --> 05:10:59,240
I'm gonna waste a fucking space there

3029
05:11:03,009 --> 05:11:05,330
Stop it. Oh my god, you're killing me

3030
05:11:08,159 --> 05:11:10,720
No, don't let him don't let him

3031
05:11:10,720 --> 05:11:16,240
Oh

3032
05:11:16,240 --> 05:11:18,240
No, I can't eat him if you do that

3033
05:11:18,319 --> 05:11:36,770
You get more hp if the meat is cooked, right?

3034
05:11:38,599 --> 05:11:47,430
All right. What is it? I need to do

3035
05:11:47,430 --> 05:11:57,569
Uh worker, uh, I didn't mean to do that

3036
05:11:59,750 --> 05:12:02,310
Well, they'll be cooked now, right? Let's test your theory

3037
05:12:02,950 --> 05:12:14,209
All right, they're gonna be cooked

3038
05:12:14,209 --> 05:12:16,209
You actually would not like

3039
05:12:18,720 --> 05:12:26,560
That's real

3040
05:12:26,560 --> 05:12:28,869
That's kind of unbelievable

3041
05:12:28,869 --> 05:12:32,389
Well little details, huh? All right. Let me turn this shit off

3042
05:12:35,970 --> 05:12:37,970
Turn off the gas open the doors

3043
05:12:46,950 --> 05:12:59,400
Neutralize this person. All right cook them

3044
05:13:05,909 --> 05:13:10,229
Oh, the purple water doesn't heal cooked meat doesn't heal better. I how am I supposed to trust you guys?

3045
05:13:11,110 --> 05:13:13,520
You know, many times i've been baited in games like these before

3046
05:13:22,630 --> 05:13:28,340
I'll take a shotgun

3047
05:13:28,340 --> 05:13:40,209
Either one of these works for me. I can do a sword. All right, let's cook them

3048
05:13:41,810 --> 05:13:45,169
Never mind. I just kind of chopped him up

3049
05:13:47,669 --> 05:13:49,669
So, uh operate all the switches

3050
05:13:50,389 --> 05:14:03,959
Just climb out the damn window

3051
05:14:03,959 --> 05:14:06,770
Oh, wait, wait, wait

3052
05:14:06,770 --> 05:14:08,610
whoo

3053
05:14:08,610 --> 05:14:09,729
handy

3054
05:14:09,729 --> 05:14:12,740
This is really handy actually

3055
05:14:12,740 --> 05:14:32,610
Look how handy this is

3056
05:14:32,610 --> 05:14:34,369
We gave you that. Yeah

3057
05:14:34,369 --> 05:14:35,889
That's what i'm saying

3058
05:14:35,889 --> 05:14:37,409
I'm thanking you

3059
05:14:37,409 --> 05:14:42,610
You guys really helped me here

3060
05:14:42,610 --> 05:14:45,619
And I much appreciate it

3061
05:14:57,430 --> 05:14:59,409
backstabber

3062
05:14:59,409 --> 05:15:00,950
That's pretty good

3063
05:15:00,950 --> 05:15:02,319
or that

3064
05:15:02,319 --> 05:15:04,799
Any of them I got a lot of money like this. I have to buy some stuff

3065
05:15:14,630 --> 05:15:16,630
Clone yourself and then eat the clone

3066
05:15:17,270 --> 05:15:20,369
Didn't they make a movie about that?

3067
05:15:20,369 --> 05:15:26,580
There's a whole movie based around what you're saying

3068
05:15:43,909 --> 05:15:54,959
Hello. Hello

3069
05:15:54,959 --> 05:15:56,240
I'm here

3070
05:15:56,240 --> 05:15:58,819
I'm still here

3071
05:15:58,819 --> 05:16:05,919
Yeah, eat a worker. Is that a worker? Yes

3072
05:16:06,400 --> 05:16:15,490
Stalking this guy

3073
05:16:15,490 --> 05:16:20,869
I don't want to do this around anybody. That's why

3074
05:16:26,869 --> 05:16:28,869
No, he exploded shit

3075
05:16:36,069 --> 05:16:37,830
Ow, god damn it

3076
05:16:37,830 --> 05:16:47,490
The stream's broken

3077
05:16:47,490 --> 05:16:59,569
What is it all screwed up again?

3078
05:16:59,569 --> 05:17:01,569
Yeah, you should be able to just kind of refresh it

3079
05:17:02,049 --> 05:17:04,419
That's not a worker

3080
05:17:04,419 --> 05:17:15,619
Where is there a worker that's in a room that i'm not going to explode accidentally

3081
05:17:20,389 --> 05:17:22,389
Worker worker worker. I need a worker

3082
05:17:23,270 --> 05:17:27,110
Come on

3083
05:17:27,110 --> 05:17:29,110
I did not mean to blow the last worker up

3084
05:17:29,669 --> 05:17:41,750
That can't be the only worker here

3085
05:17:41,750 --> 05:17:55,939
Well, we're going in

3086
05:17:55,939 --> 05:18:12,709
Um, anybody know what just happened because I don't unlock the safe open the doors

3087
05:18:13,189 --> 05:18:15,189
All right, this is gonna be timed. I think

3088
05:18:15,189 --> 05:18:18,520
I have to get in there and break this stuff

3089
05:18:19,159 --> 05:18:25,139
Should be good

3090
05:18:25,139 --> 05:18:27,139
You just steal from the cop

3091
05:18:27,619 --> 05:18:33,880
Why would you pickpocket police officer? That's probably the dumbest thing you could ever do

3092
05:18:34,840 --> 05:18:46,040
I still need to eat a worker

3093
05:18:46,040 --> 05:18:47,000
Shit

3094
05:18:47,000 --> 05:18:52,689
That's a slum dweller

3095
05:18:53,009 --> 05:18:55,009
I'm not sure there's another worker on here

3096
05:18:55,959 --> 05:18:57,959
Firefighters count as workers

3097
05:19:07,490 --> 05:19:08,770
Worker. All right

3098
05:19:08,770 --> 05:19:10,900
I need to do this right

3099
05:19:10,900 --> 05:19:14,290
I think that's the only worker here

3100
05:19:14,840 --> 05:19:16,790
Wait, hold on

3101
05:19:16,790 --> 05:19:18,549
doctor clerk

3102
05:19:18,549 --> 05:19:21,090
doctor

3103
05:19:21,090 --> 05:19:27,380
Yeah, it is

3104
05:19:27,380 --> 05:19:29,159
so

3105
05:19:29,159 --> 05:19:31,159
wait

3106
05:19:31,240 --> 05:19:32,360
office drone

3107
05:19:32,360 --> 05:19:38,279
worker, all right

3108
05:19:38,279 --> 05:19:40,279
I don't want to kill him instantly

3109
05:19:41,439 --> 05:19:51,490
This backstab will kill him

3110
05:19:51,490 --> 05:19:53,090
I don't have an opportunity to

3111
05:19:53,090 --> 05:19:59,169
He's going faster

3112
05:19:59,569 --> 05:20:08,959
Got it. Nice

3113
05:20:08,959 --> 05:20:10,720
Let me get a gun

3114
05:20:10,720 --> 05:20:20,389
No, this one's gonna suck over here though

3115
05:20:25,119 --> 05:20:28,240
Strength. Ooh, strength strength. That means I can uh, I

3116
05:20:30,930 --> 05:20:32,930
Very very very heavy swings, right?

3117
05:20:33,009 --> 05:20:51,220
Nice and I think does anybody eat that I explode them all too much

3118
05:20:51,860 --> 05:20:55,029
I think I blew them all up too much. That's fine. I'll leave this cop

3119
05:20:57,779 --> 05:21:00,560
No, I won't

3120
05:21:00,560 --> 05:21:02,560
They all just explode

3121
05:21:02,560 --> 05:21:12,680
Trade the item

3122
05:21:12,680 --> 05:21:16,439
Wow

3123
05:21:16,439 --> 05:21:36,150
That's pretty good in here. Oh

3124
05:21:37,110 --> 05:21:38,229
I'm fine

3125
05:21:38,229 --> 05:21:49,080
Baseball bat got the item. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna cook this person

3126
05:21:58,740 --> 05:22:00,180
Yeah, this one

3127
05:22:00,180 --> 05:22:02,680
So that chairman's gonna be insane here

3128
05:22:02,680 --> 05:22:20,319
At least it should be yes

3129
05:22:22,610 --> 05:22:23,889
All right. Let's uh

3130
05:22:23,889 --> 05:22:26,840
Let's gently push

3131
05:22:27,319 --> 05:22:29,830
Okay, never mind

3132
05:22:29,830 --> 05:22:35,880
uh

3133
05:22:35,880 --> 05:22:41,319
What the fuck i'm so mad right now. I'm furious. I can't fucking believe it. I need to eat these people

3134
05:22:48,759 --> 05:22:53,560
Everyone explodes now

3135
05:22:53,560 --> 05:22:57,000
Everybody explodes. How do I make it so people don't explode?

3136
05:22:58,040 --> 05:23:11,590
I have to kill them with a gun

3137
05:23:11,590 --> 05:23:13,590
Use the flamethrower. Yeah, but not right now

3138
05:23:15,520 --> 05:23:19,360
I need this

3139
05:23:19,360 --> 05:23:29,220
That's it, right? Yeah

3140
05:23:31,029 --> 05:23:33,029
Graceful floor hazards are not triggered

3141
05:23:33,430 --> 05:23:38,080
Melee weapons can destroy walls or all syringes are identified

3142
05:23:38,799 --> 05:24:06,400
I like them all

3143
05:24:06,400 --> 05:24:07,840
This one's terrible

3144
05:24:07,840 --> 05:24:09,599
shifting status effects

3145
05:24:09,599 --> 05:24:13,680
Radiation bombs or hidden bombs find a bunch of hidden bombs before they decimate the area

3146
05:24:15,639 --> 05:24:17,880
I feel like that one's gonna be terrible, too

3147
05:24:20,849 --> 05:24:23,810
Find all the hidden bombs. You think i'm capable of something like that right now

3148
05:24:34,520 --> 05:24:36,520
So I have to find the hidden bombs

3149
05:24:37,220 --> 05:24:40,799
Now what constitutes hidden?

3150
05:24:43,430 --> 05:24:45,830
Active bombs are hidden find them

3151
05:24:49,860 --> 05:24:51,459
Oh

3152
05:24:51,459 --> 05:24:59,459
All right. I gotta get in now

3153
05:24:59,459 --> 05:25:00,340
bomb

3154
05:25:00,340 --> 05:25:05,029
All right. This is

3155
05:25:05,029 --> 05:25:07,430
What oh the fire department?

3156
05:25:11,139 --> 05:25:13,139
No, it can't end like this

3157
05:25:13,939 --> 05:25:15,060
What happened?

3158
05:25:15,060 --> 05:25:17,060
I have two minutes to do this

3159
05:25:21,139 --> 05:25:23,139
Okay. All right. Go go. Go. Go. Go. There's only a few more

3160
05:25:39,090 --> 05:25:43,090
move

3161
05:25:43,090 --> 05:25:48,340
Uh, what a long hallway. That's so unfair

3162
05:25:49,060 --> 05:25:59,080
Is he begun?

3163
05:25:59,080 --> 05:26:00,639
Oh fuck

3164
05:26:00,720 --> 05:26:02,720
Who's am I live?

3165
05:26:02,720 --> 05:26:05,990
Fuck

3166
05:26:12,040 --> 05:26:13,779
That sucks

3167
05:26:13,779 --> 05:26:15,779
Three minutes is not enough time

3168
05:26:17,009 --> 05:26:21,250
All right. Let me go pee and we'll make a custom class. I'm gonna try it again. I'll be right back

3169
05:26:22,770 --> 05:26:23,970
God damn it

3170
05:26:23,970 --> 05:28:43,159
So let's do a custom class

3171
05:28:43,159 --> 05:28:47,860
And we'll uh, we'll do like one more run that should take us right to about six six and a half hours

3172
05:28:50,310 --> 05:28:52,549
That was a quick pee. Yeah, that was a long one actually

3173
05:28:54,930 --> 05:28:56,930
So how does one do this?

3174
05:28:57,169 --> 05:29:02,790
Oh, wait, wait, wait mutators. No, no, no, I don't want those

3175
05:29:03,349 --> 05:29:11,169
Did I wash my hands always? All right. Uh

3176
05:29:11,970 --> 05:29:20,919
I think what traits I can do

3177
05:29:20,919 --> 05:29:24,080
cool

3178
05:29:24,080 --> 05:29:25,599
also cool

3179
05:29:25,599 --> 05:29:28,290
I like that though

3180
05:29:28,290 --> 05:29:32,529
Teleport anytime regardless of location unless you were in immediate danger. I like that as well

3181
05:29:37,090 --> 05:29:41,000
Did you wash your legs?

3182
05:29:41,000 --> 05:29:44,360
Uh, no, I didn't go pee and then put my feet in the sink

3183
05:29:45,080 --> 05:29:49,810
So let me see here. So let's go

3184
05:29:51,479 --> 05:29:53,799
Almost in this three times

3185
05:29:53,799 --> 05:29:56,759
So, how do I make a custom class? Okay, create a character

3186
05:30:00,240 --> 05:30:02,259
uh

3187
05:30:02,259 --> 05:30:04,259
Really? Okay. How about uh, how about just me?

3188
05:30:06,720 --> 05:30:07,520
well

3189
05:30:07,520 --> 05:30:08,639
other me

3190
05:30:08,639 --> 05:30:27,119
Okay

3191
05:30:27,119 --> 05:30:32,819
Are you ready to save this character?

3192
05:30:34,529 --> 05:30:35,889
Uh, yeah

3193
05:30:35,889 --> 05:30:40,709
All right. So hair type

3194
05:30:40,709 --> 05:30:49,840
How do I

3195
05:30:49,840 --> 05:30:52,919
That's how do I change this?

3196
05:30:52,919 --> 05:30:54,919
Edit character load character

3197
05:30:55,330 --> 05:30:57,569
They uh, okay base again if I get it body type

3198
05:31:01,810 --> 05:31:04,630
Definitely the hoodie

3199
05:31:04,630 --> 05:31:12,040
Uh, i'm gonna do german at eight five colors, right? That's pretty close

3200
05:31:14,069 --> 05:31:15,909
No, not bald like me

3201
05:31:15,909 --> 05:31:26,319
No, no facial hair

3202
05:31:26,319 --> 05:31:28,319

3320
05:41:11,200 --> 05:41:19,119
I can't open this. Oh, I can't open it

All right, you're free. Let's go. Oh wait

3325
05:41:37,330 --> 05:41:51,060

zero

3331
05:42:32,049 --> 05:42:44,310
Yellow to see a toilet. I kind of want to try it

3332
05:42:46,150 --> 05:42:50,790
Like can you just hide in the toilets or do you flush down the toilet and end up in another toilet?

3333
05:42:51,590 --> 05:43:06,599
All right, this is where the writer

3334
05:43:06,599 --> 05:43:09,720
Uh, I don't really understand the point of that but okay

3335
05:43:14,689 --> 05:43:22,389
There's no secret

3336
05:43:22,389 --> 05:43:24,389

3337
05:43:25,029 --> 05:43:33,729
Oh more choice is good. That's good

3338
05:43:34,529 --> 05:43:36,099
That's good

3339
05:43:36,099 --> 05:43:44,279
That one's good

3340
05:43:45,700 --> 05:43:52,470
Oh, what is this what just happened?

3341
05:43:53,669 --> 05:43:57,060
Toilet, you know where to go

3342
05:43:57,380 --> 05:44:07,349
See you later sucker. This is stupid

3343
05:44:08,549 --> 05:44:30,639
Oh, I broke the toilet. Don't ever run away from jacks. I was gonna go eat that guy neutralize you got it

3344
05:44:31,599 --> 05:44:45,939

3346
05:45:42,200 --> 05:45:57,560
All right, let me open this out to the entrance

3347
05:45:58,119 --> 05:46:16,659
All the way to the end all the way all the way down the whole way fast. I didn't realize that was this fast

3348
05:46:18,110 --> 05:46:20,130
teleport, ooh

3349
05:46:20,130 --> 05:46:26,119
Wrong way wrong way, right? I'm stupid. I still have to wait for him though. I can't teleport with him

3350
05:46:29,750 --> 05:46:42,130
Done i'm supposed to be able to use the teleport in the toilet to go to a different toilet

3351
05:46:42,130 --> 05:46:44,130
But maybe there's only one toilet

3352
05:46:44,209 --> 05:46:54,470
That makes sense

3353
05:46:54,470 --> 05:46:56,790
Yeah, no melee melee the jacks is not going to use melee

3354
05:46:58,259 --> 05:47:07,139
I have like one or two points in it. The voucher is good because I could probably get a machine gun

3355
05:47:13,750 --> 05:47:17,139
Going pretty fast. Just give me some good perks and we're good

3356
05:47:17,779 --> 05:47:23,439
Oh, this is bad. I'll take one

3357
05:47:24,240 --> 05:47:32,680
The other ones are awful

3358
05:47:32,680 --> 05:47:36,680
I take more damage and I think I deal less damage right because i'm small

3359
05:47:38,180 --> 05:47:47,970
In the game riot riot we have to riot

3360
05:47:49,139 --> 05:47:55,779

3361
05:47:55,779 --> 05:47:57,779

3371
05:49:21,700 --> 05:49:29,919

3372
05:49:29,919 --> 05:49:31,919

Just gotta go over here retrieve the item from this guy and then get out

10 bucks in the trash

05:57:52,200 --> 05:57:53,479

05:59:01,459 --> 05:59:03,459
Almost okay. That's fine

3461
05:59:03,459 --> 05:59:07,430
That's it

3462
05:59:07,430 --> 05:59:08,549

3463
05:59:08,549 --> 05:59:11,430
Bring on the disaster guys

3464
05:59:13,189 --> 05:59:14,549
What do you got?

3465
05:59:14,549 --> 05:59:19,000
Don't do that one

3466
05:59:19,000 --> 05:59:21,299
Uh, this one's good

3467
05:59:21,299 --> 05:59:22,819
This one's good

3468
05:59:22,819 --> 05:59:24,819

Excellent choice guys

3471
05:59:49,459 --> 05:59:52,680
All right. We know this one's dumb. This is just like a speed run

3472
05:59:53,919 --> 05:59:59,279
Bombs falling from the sky and radiation rains down upon all outdoor areas every 20 seconds

3473
06:00:00,500 --> 06:00:12,979
Bombs or radiation

3474
06:00:12,979 --> 06:00:16,819
Bombs gonna be close

3475
06:00:17,540 --> 06:00:21,279
Do they telegraph or do I have to just avoid them? I have no idea

3476
06:00:27,119 --> 06:00:36,130
Bombs are dropping look up. Oh my god

3477
06:00:39,169 --> 06:00:44,229
This is gonna be horrible. All right. Well, actually this might be good because I would get

3478
06:00:44,790 --> 06:00:47,200
everything for free

3479
06:00:47,200 --> 06:00:49,200
Don't group up where the bomb dropped

3480
06:00:50,799 --> 06:00:52,799
Drop them over here so I can get the safe

3481
06:01:16,479 --> 06:01:18,220
Oh, fuck

Okay

3485
06:01:36,439 --> 06:01:38,919
No, no, no, that's not worth it. I have to just neutralize this guy

3486
06:01:39,560 --> 06:01:42,310
Where is it? Give me the pistol

3487
06:01:43,200 --> 06:01:44,319

3488
06:01:44,319 --> 06:01:54,560

Got it. Uh, give me uh, give me the freeze ray freeze ray freeze freeze

No, I don't want to need this

06:02:54,520 --> 06:02:57,200
All right. I know how the bombs drop

3499
06:02:57,200 --> 06:02:58,720
Where it lights up?

3500
06:02:58,720 --> 06:03:02,099
I want that safe though. Just drop the bomb on this guy right here

3501
06:03:05,349 --> 06:03:06,310
right here

3502
06:03:06,310 --> 06:03:14,520
Whatever, let's go

3503
06:03:14,520 --> 06:03:19,880
I'm just running from the bombs. Who's that is a bomb

3504
06:03:22,150 --> 06:03:25,189
All right, right here drop one right here and then let me get out

3505
06:03:25,909 --> 06:03:27,479
Here it comes

3506
06:03:27,479 --> 06:03:33,029
Will that do it?

3507
06:03:33,029 --> 06:03:38,610
Oh, come on drop one over here so I don't have to go in that

3508
06:03:39,250 --> 06:03:48,389
This guy's dead

3509
06:03:48,389 --> 06:03:49,750
Come do it

3510
06:03:49,750 --> 06:03:53,669
Is it gonna land?

3511
06:03:53,669 --> 06:03:57,959
Do it right here

3512
06:03:57,959 --> 06:04:02,439
Oh, fuck it. Whatever

3513
06:04:03,720 --> 06:04:13,189
Where's it dropping? Oh god, I don't know where it is

3514
06:04:16,979 --> 06:04:19,330
Hey

3515
06:04:19,330 --> 06:04:22,450
Dude, it's fucking chaos outside and you're gonna act like this right

3516
06:04:25,189 --> 06:04:27,430
Actual chaos outside. Are you stupid?

3517
06:04:28,229 --> 06:04:34,340
Oh god

3518
06:04:34,340 --> 06:04:44,229
Thank you elevator open. I need health

3519
06:04:44,869 --> 06:04:49,860
That's it. Right. All right. Get me out of this bomb nonsense

3520
06:04:50,659 --> 06:04:55,569
Turn on twitch integration

3521
06:04:55,569 --> 06:04:57,169
um

3522
06:04:57,169 --> 06:04:59,330
It's been on for like two hours

3523
06:05:00,689 --> 06:05:01,490
What?

3524
06:05:01,490 --> 06:05:07,430
Okay, random item

3525
06:05:11,560 --> 06:05:12,849
Yeah

3526
06:05:12,849 --> 06:05:14,849
It's been on for like a couple hours

3527
06:05:14,930 --> 06:05:17,669
I don't want to talk to you

3528
06:05:17,669 --> 06:05:19,509
Yes, you do

3529
06:05:19,509 --> 06:05:22,450
What is that bracelet of strength?

3530
06:05:22,930 --> 06:05:27,169
Probably belongs in a much more medieval fantasy oriented game, but who cares increases your melee strength

3531
06:05:27,889 --> 06:05:40,000
Give me like the big heel

3532
06:05:40,000 --> 06:05:47,759
Water pump. What is it? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Is this a heel?

3533
06:05:48,560 --> 06:05:50,080
No, it's not a heel

3534
06:05:50,080 --> 06:05:58,340
Is it electrified? The water is electrified now

3535
06:06:02,049 --> 06:06:16,950
Uh, is it though? I just poisoned it. Oh, it gives me electro touch

3536
06:06:17,590 --> 06:06:29,860
Okay. Oh, that's an electro touch forever

3537
06:06:30,580 --> 06:06:31,939
Can I electro?

3538
06:06:31,939 --> 06:06:38,310
Get rid of these

3539
06:06:38,310 --> 06:06:40,229
They die

3540
06:06:40,229 --> 06:06:41,909
Oh, yeah, they do

3541
06:06:41,909 --> 06:06:46,840
What is that?

3542
06:06:46,840 --> 06:06:48,630
Okay, nice

3543
06:06:48,630 --> 06:06:51,119
Turns almost any item into food

3544
06:06:51,840 --> 06:06:55,200
Food that probably causes cancer, but that's beyond the game scope

3545
06:06:57,860 --> 06:06:59,139
Wait, what?

3546
06:06:59,139 --> 06:07:01,569
I can can I put the shuriken in there?

3547
06:07:01,729 --> 06:07:23,639
What did it turn into? Oh turning it into the bud

3548
06:07:24,520 --> 06:07:30,340
Is there any more melee shit?

3549
06:07:30,340 --> 06:07:36,340
No, that's good for now

3550
06:07:36,659 --> 06:07:44,040
I wanted to eat the bud

3551
06:07:44,040 --> 06:07:46,439
But it ate the first aid kit and i'm about to level up

3552
06:07:47,560 --> 06:07:52,759
You have no idea just how badly I wish I could save state like 10 seconds ago

3553
06:08:09,729 --> 06:08:10,529
Hey

3554
06:08:10,529 --> 06:08:14,630
Hey

3555
06:08:14,630 --> 06:08:28,369
Oh, I got a friend phone. I'm just gonna sell it. Nobody likes me three dollars. What a waste

3556
06:08:29,169 --> 06:08:32,049
What a serious weight like why would I?

3557
06:08:32,529 --> 06:08:40,240
You got to put at least like five dollars ten dollars in those chests. Come on. Why am I hurting?

3558
06:08:40,880 --> 06:08:58,610
What the? All right. Wait, is there is there a sublimatic? Yeah, there is all right. Get rid of the

3559
06:08:59,169 --> 06:09:02,290
I don't want this. It's confused. It's terrible melee

3560
06:09:03,250 --> 06:09:05,250
Get rid of the banana peels. They don't do anything

3561
06:09:06,049 --> 06:09:08,049
get rid of the

3562
06:09:10,400 --> 06:09:13,159
Uh the phone

3563
06:09:13,159 --> 06:09:14,279
twice

3564
06:09:14,279 --> 06:09:16,549
Nobody I don't have any friends

3565
06:09:16,549 --> 06:09:19,919
All right. I'm okay with this

3566
06:09:19,919 --> 06:09:23,139
Can I buy anything else?

3567
06:09:23,139 --> 06:09:28,740
Axis melee. Yeah, but this could be desperate an incredibly desperate attempt for me to just run them around axe is really powerful

3568
06:09:29,540 --> 06:09:31,220
power powerful

3569
06:09:31,220 --> 06:09:33,840
Yeah, the axe is really powerful

3570
06:09:34,319 --> 06:09:40,840
God I like to talk

3571
06:09:40,919 --> 06:09:44,080
So we got uh, I don't want any of that stuff

3572
06:09:44,959 --> 06:09:46,959
All right. I'm good to go. Just uh destroy the box

3573
06:09:47,360 --> 06:09:54,799
Is there an ammo container anymore?

3574
06:09:54,799 --> 06:09:56,159
No, just bartender

3575
06:09:56,159 --> 06:10:02,419
See what I mean?

3576
06:10:02,419 --> 06:10:04,580
I don't even know what happened. I just knew that I need this axe now

3577
06:10:05,380 --> 06:10:07,380
Because everyone's coming after me

3578
06:10:07,380 --> 06:10:20,840
That dude had 10 bucks

3579
06:10:20,840 --> 06:10:23,840
All right load automatic

3580
06:10:24,319 --> 06:10:26,360
here

3581
06:10:26,360 --> 06:10:32,310
Um, I don't have the silencer equipped. Well, so hold on. Let me do that real quick

3582
06:10:33,029 --> 06:10:35,880
and then

3583
06:10:35,880 --> 06:10:38,930
Hi, I don't understand. What does the atm do?

3584
06:10:40,319 --> 06:10:44,560
Oh, it can be stored between runs. I get it. Okay. So what what's the point of me doing this just to get a

3585
06:10:45,180 --> 06:10:47,180
76 bucks for another gun

3586
06:10:59,240 --> 06:11:00,439
Just ammo

3587
06:11:00,439 --> 06:11:02,439
It's a lot of money for ammo though

3588
06:11:04,279 --> 06:11:11,319
Yeah, it's not worth it. Let's just do this

3589
06:11:11,959 --> 06:11:14,680
Uh, i'm gonna have to use the axe. This is why I kept it

3590
06:11:20,000 --> 06:11:21,200
Right into the water

3591
06:11:21,200 --> 06:11:31,830
It's better if you start the game with rare items because it puts those in there. I see

3592
06:11:32,389 --> 06:11:40,470
Cool none of these are very good for what i'm doing right now

3593
06:11:41,490 --> 06:11:49,119
Unfortunately

3594
06:11:49,119 --> 06:11:51,759
I'll be happy if I get down to the one after this

3595
06:11:52,479 --> 06:11:57,479
Yeah, the leap blower would be actually kind of good here

3596
06:11:57,880 --> 06:11:59,880
Just blow people into the water

3597
06:12:00,119 --> 06:12:03,250
Thank you

3598
06:12:03,250 --> 06:12:05,250
And it's technically a gun. So

3599
06:12:05,409 --> 06:12:08,869
You are correct. It is a gun technically

3600
06:12:09,750 --> 06:12:11,750
Not like anybody was arguing with me about it

3601
06:12:12,470 --> 06:12:19,319
Yeah, you know, you're right. You're right. Yeah, who's right? What are you talking about? Get away from me

3602
06:12:28,020 --> 06:12:36,099
Cocktail whiskey I should buy some of these no don't want that

3603
06:12:37,380 --> 06:12:40,450
Thank you

3604
06:12:40,450 --> 06:12:45,750
Resurrection does that last until I die because that's a huge deal

3605
06:12:50,639 --> 06:12:58,069
Oh shit, i'm done with all the missions. I'm just gonna get out walk him into the trap

3606
06:12:58,950 --> 06:13:01,240
You avoided it

3607
06:13:01,240 --> 06:13:02,599
Okay

3608
06:13:02,599 --> 06:13:06,529
Goodbye, there's an ammo thing right there. No

3609
06:13:08,630 --> 06:13:10,630
No, no, no, no. No. All right. Stop

3610
06:13:15,360 --> 06:13:17,360
Okay, get out get out get out. Okay. All right. All right

3611
06:13:17,680 --> 06:13:33,279
Did I refill the wrong thing? Oh, this is good. This is good

3612
06:13:38,630 --> 06:13:40,630
Was this three two coming up?

3613
06:13:40,869 --> 06:13:42,069
three three

3614
06:13:42,069 --> 06:13:51,540
Something like that, right?

3615
06:13:51,540 --> 06:13:53,540
Yeah, extra experience is always good. That means a full hell

3616
06:13:54,180 --> 06:13:58,400
said that with like a

3617
06:13:58,400 --> 06:14:02,930
English accent or like a scottish accent for some reason. Oh, it's a full hell

3618
06:14:05,599 --> 06:14:07,599
I don't know. Sometimes my brain just turns off

3619
06:14:08,080 --> 06:14:12,869
Selling that

3620
06:14:12,869 --> 06:14:15,400
All right right in there

3621
06:14:15,400 --> 06:14:17,400
Destroy that

3622
06:14:17,400 --> 06:14:19,400
I should be okay. I just yeah watch this ready

3623
06:14:20,200 --> 06:14:34,069
That's a huge

3624
06:14:34,150 --> 06:14:38,310
60 bucks you had a lot of money. Wait, where is it? Was it where is it?

3625
06:14:40,240 --> 06:14:56,099
That was clearly 60. Wasn't it? I did not know you had to equip those

3626
06:14:59,240 --> 06:15:02,279
Uh resist bullets or resist damage. What is the difference?

3627
06:15:04,040 --> 06:15:22,479
Let's go neutralize some folks and then retrieve the chest. Okay. Wait, he doesn't like me, but I don't have any more of that stuff

3628
06:15:22,479 --> 06:15:23,680
Do I?

3629
06:15:23,680 --> 06:15:26,709
oh well

3630
06:15:26,709 --> 06:15:28,880
oh well

3631
06:15:28,880 --> 06:15:32,080
I walked right into that. I saw it coming from a mile away. I knew it

3632
06:15:32,639 --> 06:15:35,040
Was staring at it. I just walked into it

3633
06:15:37,889 --> 06:16:22,959
Back up that scared the shit out of me. Did he bumped into me or something? I need some ammo for

3634
06:16:23,680 --> 06:16:26,049
the shotgun

3635
06:16:26,049 --> 06:16:31,279
I needed to do it. I still have resurrections. That's good

3636
06:16:38,020 --> 06:16:39,459
Nice, dude

3637
06:16:39,459 --> 06:16:44,049
Can I give him the flamethrower?

3638
06:16:44,049 --> 06:16:46,049
No, how do I approach this?

3639
06:16:46,450 --> 06:16:54,740
I have to just shoot them

3640
06:16:54,740 --> 06:17:06,400
They don't have any weapons, right? I'm gonna take the critter upper

3641
06:17:12,450 --> 06:17:13,250
Yeah

3642
06:17:13,250 --> 06:17:50,869
It was worth it that one that one that one that one or the grenade both will work. Good. Good. Good. Good

3643
06:17:51,509 --> 06:17:56,959
Thank you. Thank you. All of them doing a good thing

3644
06:18:01,080 --> 06:18:03,599
Three you fools

3645
06:18:03,599 --> 06:18:09,729
No one

3646
06:18:09,729 --> 06:18:11,169
getting there

3647
06:18:11,169 --> 06:18:12,290
annoyed

3648
06:18:12,290 --> 06:18:26,310
Wait guys

3649
06:18:26,310 --> 06:18:37,380
I didn't start it, but I finished it. I think I was a run killer again

3650
06:18:39,319 --> 06:18:42,439
It actually has been three for three even if I didn't die to the robot

3651
06:18:43,080 --> 06:18:45,880
The robot's presence causes me to panic every single time

3652
06:18:46,680 --> 06:18:49,040
I gotta get over it with Jax though

3653
06:18:53,700 --> 06:18:57,060
This one was terrible too. You only get three minutes to do three bombs across the whole map

3654
06:19:01,540 --> 06:19:03,540
I've i've never gone down through the park

3655
06:19:04,020 --> 06:19:07,060
Hasn't happened in the six and a half hours i've been playing this game

3656
06:19:08,680 --> 06:19:10,680
All right. Here we go. Come on

3657
06:19:11,860 --> 06:19:17,860
I just have to do retrieve the muffin and rescue somebody up here right in a row. Here we go straight ahead

3658
06:19:19,060 --> 06:19:25,889
retrieve item from you

3659
06:19:25,970 --> 06:19:28,369
No, he's okay. He's already here. I'm gonna wrap around

3660
06:19:29,409 --> 06:19:36,639
away from me

3661
06:19:36,639 --> 06:19:41,139
Where is he?

3662
06:19:41,139 --> 06:19:46,720
I had to

3663
06:19:46,720 --> 06:19:49,569
Nope to the entrance. All right, follow me

3664
06:19:56,200 --> 06:20:07,319
That hurts terminate him. All right. He has a clear shot right now

3665
06:20:12,630 --> 06:20:14,680
None of these are very good

3666
06:20:14,680 --> 06:20:19,119
I can't use any of them the phone to sell maybe for money

3667
06:20:25,720 --> 06:20:37,459
Something like that

3668
06:20:37,459 --> 06:20:39,700
Yeah, it's an easy sell

3669
06:20:40,020 --> 06:20:46,180
All right, watch it. He's gonna fire one. I got full health

3670
06:20:46,819 --> 06:20:51,880
Wait, can I

3671
06:20:51,880 --> 06:20:53,880
Oh, this guy's the guy I need to

3672
06:20:58,310 --> 06:21:00,310
He doesn't know i'm this person right?

3673
06:21:04,470 --> 06:21:07,270
He's he's gonna walk by me or is he gonna shoot at me?

3674
06:21:07,990 --> 06:21:10,159
He doesn't know he doesn't know right?

3675
06:21:17,569 --> 06:21:22,369
He doesn't touch me. He doesn't shoot at me. He just okay. This is good. I figured it out

3676
06:21:23,250 --> 06:21:26,450
Drop him drop him

3677
06:21:29,799 --> 06:21:31,799
Step on the pressure plate and drop him

3678
06:21:36,099 --> 06:21:38,849
Oh god get

3679
06:21:38,849 --> 06:21:40,369
Come on

3680
06:21:45,590 --> 06:21:47,590
Oh, he just direct hit me

3681
06:21:53,159 --> 06:21:56,630
Wait, why does he know now?

3682
06:21:56,630 --> 06:22:06,040
Why does he know now?

3683
06:22:06,040 --> 06:22:08,279
No, I went out. I went out. I went out. I went out. I want

3684
06:22:11,479 --> 06:22:14,369
I just got crushed

3685
06:22:14,369 --> 06:22:16,680
All right teleport, right?

3686
06:22:16,680 --> 06:22:20,599
Wait, wait, wait, I need to slow down. I need to go up. I'm done. I need to teleport out

3687
06:22:23,319 --> 06:22:31,830

Where what do I have for weapons just keep everybody away from me? Okay, I did it

3689
06:22:59,330 --> 06:23:03,080

Okay, I I need to make some food

3691
06:23:06,360 --> 06:23:08,279
That stupid robot

3692
06:23:08,279 --> 06:23:10,279
Why didn't he shoot me when I was?

3693
06:23:10,520 --> 06:23:12,200
In there the first time

3694
06:23:12,200 --> 06:23:28,360
Yeah, but i'm really loud. Give me this one. That means i'll get money and I can buy some stuff

3695
06:23:32,479 --> 06:23:34,479
Explosion survivor. Okay. This is 401

All right. I'll be all right. I need ammo though

06:24:15,919 --> 06:24:19,919
Welcome to hip and happening downtown. Enjoy your stay, but not too much. Let's not get crazy

3709
06:24:20,400 --> 06:24:24,720
Okay, look just keep your expectations in check and your gun in your pants and we won't have a problem

3710
06:24:25,759 --> 06:24:30,560
I need to sell something. I need to

3711
06:24:30,560 --> 06:24:32,580

What have to do with the altar?

3717
06:24:57,720 --> 06:24:59,639
No, that's way too expensive

3718
06:24:59,639 --> 06:25:07,919
I have no reason to use this right now. I wonder what I have to use that for

3719
06:25:08,799 --> 06:25:10,400

06:44:46,130 --> 06:44:50,610
It's gonna end again and i'm at the end. I have one more more to do

3888
06:44:53,159 --> 06:44:55,159
Give me something easy

3889
06:44:55,159 --> 06:45:00,069
Give me the ooze. The ooze is so easy. Give this to me

3890
06:45:00,709 --> 06:45:02,080
This is

3891
06:45:02,080 --> 06:45:03,279
It's over

3892
06:45:03,279 --> 06:45:15,080
And I don't have any food. Wait, I just thought of a genius idea

3893
06:45:16,369 --> 06:45:18,279
Let me come over here

3894
06:45:18,279 --> 06:45:19,720
Come on over here

3895
06:45:19,720 --> 06:45:22,340
Do I have shurikens? I do. Okay

3896
06:45:23,060 --> 06:45:25,759
um

3897
06:45:25,759 --> 06:45:27,459
Get over here

3898
06:45:27,459 --> 06:45:28,979
I'm waiting for you

3899
06:45:28,979 --> 06:45:38,259
I need to land one

3900
06:45:38,259 --> 06:45:40,259
One shot it has to hit

3901
06:45:41,250 --> 06:45:42,529
And i'm good

3902
06:45:42,529 --> 06:46:17,009
How long does it last for?

3903
06:46:17,250 --> 06:46:21,209
Ladies and gentlemen, this is mambo number five

3904
06:46:44,240 --> 06:46:46,240
Be a buzz like I had last week

3905
06:46:46,319 --> 06:46:54,659
I must stay deep because talk is cheap. All as I continue, you know, they're getting sweeter

3906
06:46:54,979 --> 06:47:01,299
So what can I do? I really beg you my lord to me learn this just like a sport anything fly

3907
06:47:01,540 --> 06:47:07,459
It's all good. Let me jump in please send in the trumpet a little bit of Monica in my life

3908
06:47:07,779 --> 06:47:12,900
A little bit of erika by my side a little bit of Rita's all I need

3909
06:47:13,299 --> 06:47:16,369
A little bit

3910
06:47:22,389 --> 06:47:24,389
The song sucks

3911
06:47:24,470 --> 06:47:27,409
What a dumb song

3912
06:47:28,049 --> 06:47:33,569
Deep fake that wasn't even me. I didn't even just do that. Somebody just turned somebody to just just fucking hack the computer

3913
06:47:33,729 --> 06:47:38,290
And put a deep fake on camera. That's what i'm talking about. That shit sucks. It's bullshit. I didn't do that

3914
06:47:46,360 --> 06:47:48,360
I can't believe somebody made that deep fake

3915
06:47:52,529 --> 06:47:55,569
I

3916
06:47:55,569 --> 06:47:58,689
Why do I have to lose every time to the fucking robot?

3917
06:47:59,409 --> 06:48:03,590
But let me lay I have some defense here on your offense. I've got defense

3918
06:48:04,610 --> 06:48:06,369
that item says

3919
06:48:06,369 --> 06:48:09,490
That is it. It instantly kills an enemy, right?

3920
06:48:10,369 --> 06:48:16,479
It was like take the instant kill for throwing stuff, right?

3921
06:48:17,279 --> 06:48:23,400
What do you mean wrong item?

3922
06:48:23,400 --> 06:48:25,400
No, look at look look look look. Where is it?

3923
06:48:26,040 --> 06:48:37,799
That's misleading. That's a misleading thing. What's it called?

3924
06:48:38,599 --> 06:48:44,119
Killer throw everyone wanted to be able to throw things at people and make them explode into giblets to live your dreams

3925
06:48:44,919 --> 06:48:48,360
so it's not

3926
06:48:48,360 --> 06:48:51,880
Killer thrower that so it doesn't say instantly kills them

3927
06:48:59,810 --> 06:49:01,810
But yeah, it doesn't say instant kill

3928
06:49:03,560 --> 06:49:05,560
Yeah, it doesn't shit

3929
06:49:06,900 --> 06:49:11,880
Oh, I was so close to stop picking the robot. It's causing me anxiety

3930
06:49:15,110 --> 06:49:17,110
I'm never gonna get over the robot

3931
06:49:17,669 --> 06:49:24,470
All right

3932
06:49:24,470 --> 06:49:26,470
No, no, that's it. That's it

3933
06:49:26,709 --> 06:49:30,400
We've been going for seven hours

3934
06:49:31,380 --> 06:49:37,569
Fucking robot. So tomorrow i'll see you for the comb stream

3935
06:49:39,599 --> 06:49:42,959
I said false song. I didn't say false song. I said I was gonna do for like 12 seconds

3936
06:49:45,330 --> 06:49:47,000
Yeah, it got late

3937
06:49:47,000 --> 06:49:48,680
Thanks for saying this game's fun

3938
06:49:48,680 --> 06:49:53,200
I would play this one again

3939
06:49:53,200 --> 06:49:55,060
If you enjoyed it

3940
06:49:55,060 --> 06:49:57,060
but I mean

3941
06:49:57,060 --> 06:50:00,500
Uh checking it out first impressions with germa 985

3942
06:50:01,139 --> 06:50:05,750
It's pretty fun. It seems like you can dump

3943
06:50:06,840 --> 06:50:09,159
Uh, like at least 20 to 40 hours into this game

3944
06:50:09,799 --> 06:50:12,549
It's pretty cool

3945
06:50:12,549 --> 06:50:15,860
But yeah tomorrow we're gonna do comb stream. We're gonna do uh more tier lists

3946
06:50:16,500 --> 06:50:19,650
I'm gonna lip sync the entire mambo number five song

3947
06:50:20,529 --> 06:50:25,889
From start to finish

3948
06:50:25,889 --> 06:50:27,889
And we'll do some flash game. We'll just hang out

3949
06:50:28,290 --> 06:50:30,229
It's like a whatever stream

3950
06:50:30,229 --> 06:50:32,869
Should be fun

3951
06:50:32,869 --> 06:50:35,349
Uh, the internet still seems to be an issue

3952
06:50:36,389 --> 06:50:37,189
but

3953
06:50:37,189 --> 06:50:39,990
At least I don't have five vods this time

3954
06:50:41,799 --> 06:50:44,680
Because before they fixed one of the there's probably two or three different problems

3955
06:50:45,479 --> 06:50:47,029
but

3956
06:50:47,029 --> 06:50:48,389
We dropped

3957
06:50:48,389 --> 06:50:51,990
20 000 frames in seven hours, which is just barely

3958
06:50:52,790 --> 06:50:54,790
at that level of

3959
06:50:55,500 --> 06:50:57,919
tolerable

3960
06:50:57,919 --> 06:51:00,560
Anything over like one percent drop frames would be

3961
06:51:02,159 --> 06:51:08,119
Let's hope it improves as we continue to go over the next few days

3962
06:51:12,080 --> 06:51:15,860
It was good. It was all right

3963
06:51:15,860 --> 06:51:18,180
Don't listen to this deep fake promising us thing

3964
06:51:18,819 --> 06:51:23,040
All right, let's uh

3965
06:51:23,040 --> 06:51:24,159
Let's call it

3966
06:51:24,159 --> 06:51:29,319
That's a perfect time to stop I think because starting a new run would be like another 40 50 minutes

3967
06:51:29,319 --> 06:51:30,840
And it's getting late

3968
06:51:30,840 --> 06:51:38,150
So let's go back earlier. Let's do the uh bits

3969
06:51:38,950 --> 06:51:41,840
and we had

3970
06:51:41,840 --> 06:51:44,880
two dollars and fifty cents from um well dough and well dough

3971
06:51:45,599 --> 06:51:48,020
Hey derma, i'd be surprised if no one has suggested this yet

3972
06:51:48,580 --> 06:51:50,580
But you should definitely contact

3973
06:51:51,299 --> 06:51:54,259
Michael reeves and william osmond to help with your carnival stream

3974
06:51:54,900 --> 06:51:57,939
Alongside the robotics team if you haven't heard of them look them up on youtube

3975
06:52:00,130 --> 06:52:02,689
Uh, unfortunately this robotics stream

3976
06:52:03,650 --> 06:52:05,650
There are two different

3977
06:52:05,950 --> 06:52:07,950
Companies that are involved

3978
06:52:07,970 --> 06:52:15,409
One of them is handling the actual engineering and building of the robots and the other one is handling the stream stuff

3979
06:52:16,209 --> 06:52:18,209
I mean i'm like grand

3980
06:52:18,610 --> 06:52:23,090
Uh the overseer or whatever. I'm like the executive producer, I guess you could say

3981
06:52:24,049 --> 06:52:26,049
But there's a couple of teams

3982
06:52:26,130 --> 06:52:28,130
That are working underneath

3983
06:52:28,209 --> 06:52:30,209
Essentially everything that i've said I wanted to do

3984
06:52:30,450 --> 06:52:32,450
So I really already have

3985
06:52:33,400 --> 06:52:37,959
A whole company, you know team of people who are going to be doing like the stream portion

3986
06:52:38,599 --> 06:52:40,599
and I don't think I have

3987
06:52:40,680 --> 06:52:45,720
the necessary resources to contact anybody else or have anybody else come on board or

3988
06:52:46,599 --> 06:52:47,479
um

3989
06:52:47,479 --> 06:52:50,479
There's a lot of moving parts

3990
06:52:50,479 --> 06:52:52,479
How can you afford all this?

3991
06:52:52,560 --> 06:52:56,040
uh

3992
06:52:56,040 --> 06:52:57,619
I

3993
06:52:57,619 --> 06:53:00,259
I kind of I kind of just don't give a fuck about all that

3994
06:53:04,450 --> 06:53:05,909
I'm doing

3995
06:53:05,909 --> 06:53:08,529
Just fine. You know what I mean?

3996
06:53:14,069 --> 06:53:15,270
Uh, I

3997
06:53:15,270 --> 06:53:17,830
The money that I make and the money that I put into this stream

3998
06:53:18,630 --> 06:53:24,069
I would rather put a shitload of money into a stream and still be doing just fine, which I will be

3999
06:53:24,869 --> 06:53:27,110
so don't worry about

4000
06:53:27,349 --> 06:53:29,029
my monetary

4001
06:53:29,029 --> 06:53:34,709
And my financials because I've ran the numbers a bunch of times if I'm saving a lot of money, so don't worry

4002
06:53:35,430 --> 06:53:37,430
But I really don't care about

4003
06:53:37,830 --> 06:53:39,430
trying to

4004
06:53:39,430 --> 06:53:41,430
Maximize my profits on twitch

4005
06:53:42,069 --> 06:53:45,590
If it means that I get to potentially do and stream

4006
06:53:46,549 --> 06:53:47,830
one of the

4007
06:53:47,830 --> 06:53:50,389
Most interesting things I think I've at least personally ever done

4008
06:53:51,349 --> 06:53:52,709
on camera

4009
06:53:52,709 --> 06:53:56,229
Then I want to do it like that. That's it's worth it to me to be able to do something like that and try

4010
06:53:57,990 --> 06:54:02,150
So

4011
06:54:02,150 --> 06:54:05,189
Tingy thanks for the 10 community subs right at the end here. Thank you so much tingy

4012
06:54:07,520 --> 06:54:09,520
That's where you get your money

4013
06:54:10,049 --> 06:54:12,049
That 10 community subs just came in

4014
06:54:13,700 --> 06:54:17,619
But if i'm able to do this look I want to look back in 10 20 years

4015
06:54:18,180 --> 06:54:22,419
When i'm done with this maybe all together. I'll be like i'll be like fucking 50 guys

4016
06:54:23,220 --> 06:54:25,220
I'll be like 60 years old

4017
06:54:25,810 --> 06:54:30,209
I personally want to just be like hey, remember when I did that and yeah, it costed some money, but

4018
06:54:31,250 --> 06:54:33,250
It was worth it. It was where it was a lot of fun

4019
06:54:33,409 --> 06:54:37,490
And it was a big like community fun event. I don't care about

4020
06:54:38,290 --> 06:54:41,810
Trying to well, you know, hold on. I can like keep that buddy

4021
06:54:42,770 --> 06:54:55,330
No, it's worth doing this it'll be fun when I spent two dollars whenever I spent a two dollar bill on that carnival

4022
06:55:01,200 --> 06:55:03,200
Another 30 years

4023
06:55:04,069 --> 06:55:05,669
I don't know about that

4024
06:55:05,669 --> 06:55:10,689
Two. No, not two billion

4025
06:55:10,689 --> 06:55:14,470
Don't ever stop streaming for the rest of your life

4026
06:55:15,810 --> 06:55:16,930
hmm

4027
06:55:16,930 --> 06:55:22,930
I don't have any immediate plans, but I don't know. I don't know if i'm gonna be the like

4028
06:55:23,889 --> 06:55:26,369
55 year old 60 year old guy on here

4029
06:55:33,569 --> 06:55:35,569
Why not? I don't know that's

4030
06:55:36,849 --> 06:55:41,650
I'm gonna like retire somewhere. I don't know. I have no idea how long i'll be doing this

4031
06:55:42,630 --> 06:55:45,270
I don't have any plan or any goals

4032
06:55:45,909 --> 06:55:48,049
with this

4033
06:55:48,049 --> 06:55:50,610
I'm just gonna keep doing it until I don't think it's fun anymore

4034
06:55:52,759 --> 06:55:54,759
That could be 50 years

4035
06:55:56,400 --> 06:55:58,400
It might not be I don't know

4036
06:56:07,000 --> 06:56:09,000
Cry if you retire

4037
06:56:09,000 --> 06:56:13,000
By the time that I stop streaming or really really really dial back completely

4038
06:56:13,959 --> 06:56:16,689
It'll

4039
06:56:16,689 --> 06:56:18,689
It's it's gonna be a while from now

4040
06:56:30,759 --> 06:56:34,119
All right. Uh, this is that's a this is a very normal thing

4041
06:56:35,000 --> 06:56:40,689
Hold on. So so me telling you guys, you know, you might get

4042
06:56:41,729 --> 06:56:43,970
It might be 20 more years of this

4043
06:56:44,770 --> 06:56:45,810
No

4044
06:56:45,810 --> 06:56:49,400
We'll think of it this way, right? How long did your favorite tv show run for?

4045
06:56:51,330 --> 06:56:54,290
I'm of the opinion and I I truly believe this

4046
06:56:54,849 --> 06:56:57,090
That there's a time to end the tv show

4047
06:56:57,889 --> 06:57:05,490
Because all the tv shows that go on for more than like 10 to 20 seasons

4048
06:57:06,689 --> 06:57:08,689
they

4049
06:57:09,080 --> 06:57:12,599
They start to lose why they were interesting in the first place, I think

4050
06:57:18,470 --> 06:57:23,759
After like the 9 to 15 seasons

4051
06:57:24,639 --> 06:57:26,639
Because it might be time to wrap it up, you know

4052
06:57:30,159 --> 06:57:32,080
20 seasons

4053
06:57:32,080 --> 06:57:36,290
Twitch is a lot different than television, but you know the same

4054
06:57:37,799 --> 06:57:40,919
I actually was having this conversation with italics the other day and

4055
06:57:42,520 --> 06:57:44,119
We were talking about this

4056
06:57:44,119 --> 06:57:46,119
Okay, so let's so twitch, right?

4057
06:57:47,029 --> 06:57:49,750
What what happens when you play every game, you know?

4058
06:57:50,549 --> 06:57:52,549
It's like a fossil fuel

4059
06:57:53,319 --> 06:57:57,400
When you do everything what happens if you do everything like 10 years from now you played every game

4060
06:57:58,119 --> 06:58:02,150
Every game that's worth playing

4061
06:58:02,790 --> 06:58:04,790
We just have to wait for the new ones

4062
06:58:07,040 --> 06:58:11,439
They make new ones. Yeah, but i'm just saying like what what happens when you do everything?

4063
06:58:14,959 --> 06:58:16,959
Prepare for more irl

4064
06:58:17,200 --> 06:58:21,299
Yeah, but I already told you guys. I don't i'm not gonna do irl streams unless they're

4065
06:58:23,040 --> 06:58:24,159
bits

4066
06:58:24,159 --> 06:58:33,250
I'm not walking around with the selfie camera out of like the subway and be like hey

4067
06:58:33,330 --> 06:58:37,650
So guys don't like the subway doors like clothes on the fucking selfie stick like oh shit

4068
06:58:38,209 --> 06:58:41,090
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Stop the train. Stop the train. I'm not doing that

4069
06:58:46,200 --> 06:58:48,200
You're doing an irl stream tomorrow

4070
06:58:49,569 --> 06:58:52,450
Yeah, but it's it's it's different because I it's

4071
06:58:53,250 --> 06:58:57,009
I don't do it that often and there's nothing wrong with that. I have nothing wrong with an irl stream

4072
06:58:57,009 --> 06:59:02,610
I'm just saying I I don't want to do that. I don't want to every day like walk around vegas

4073
06:59:03,409 --> 06:59:04,930
I don't want to do that

4074
06:59:04,930 --> 06:59:18,610
I'd rather do something else. Let me comb my hair on stream. Yeah, when was the last comb stream?

4075
06:59:19,169 --> 06:59:23,009
Two like two years ago

4076
06:59:23,250 --> 06:59:24,930
A year and a half ago

4077
06:59:24,930 --> 06:59:30,259
It was a year ago that I combed my hair on stream and just hung out

4078
06:59:33,840 --> 06:59:40,720
So come on

4079
06:59:40,720 --> 06:59:46,560
Is this the guy who's saying mambo number five into his comb like it was a microphone?

4080
06:59:47,279 --> 06:59:50,159
Yes

4081
06:59:50,159 --> 06:59:52,159
But long story short

4082
06:59:52,400 --> 06:59:54,400
Don't worry about my financials

4083
06:59:55,040 --> 07:00:01,840
We might fuck around here a lot, but i'm gonna make sure that i'm not gonna cause myself any problems

4084
07:00:01,840 --> 07:00:03,840
It's not gonna be an issue

4085
07:00:04,319 --> 07:00:06,319
I'm gonna be just fine. So don't worry

4086
07:00:06,560 --> 07:00:08,400
I appreciate the concern though

4087
07:00:08,400 --> 07:00:10,919
I'm looking forward to it. It'll be fun

4088
07:00:10,919 --> 07:00:12,919
But let's keep going with the bits

4089
07:00:14,419 --> 07:00:19,700
Stop dropping coins. I'm doing that. I'm okay. That's subconscious. I'm just picking coins up off the because they were a mess

4090
07:00:22,069 --> 07:00:25,189
I did this I did this little like uh thing where uh

4091
07:00:25,830 --> 07:00:28,549
Joel called me after vine bristle and I pretended

4092
07:00:29,509 --> 07:00:36,689
Because that's a spoiler. I was cheating but I like he like rolls of coins in my hands. That's a spoiler

4093
07:00:36,689 --> 07:00:41,680
We're not going to spoil this here

4094
07:00:41,680 --> 07:00:43,680
He's counting his money. We got one

4095
07:00:43,840 --> 07:00:44,720
two

4096
07:00:44,720 --> 07:00:46,720
Three that's a dollar right there

4097
07:00:47,840 --> 07:00:50,720
Anyways, uh, thank you to lewd sheep for the three bucks. Hey

4098
07:00:51,279 --> 07:00:56,080
Jermbo this message is so that you notice a creative person called yen wen len who made great art

4099
07:00:57,360 --> 07:00:59,360
Find their message if you can

4100
07:00:59,599 --> 07:01:00,880
Or did

4101
07:01:00,880 --> 07:01:02,639
And ignore this once you do

4102
07:01:02,639 --> 07:01:04,000
Yeah, we put uh

4104
07:01:07,520 --> 07:01:10,799
art up on the screen pretty much any chance we get it's

4105
07:01:11,759 --> 07:01:15,040
It's incredibly detailed. It's it's perfect. It's fantastic

4106
07:01:16,000 --> 07:01:21,759
And there's not much else I could say that's uh more than that. So we usually check it out every time

4107
07:01:23,360 --> 07:01:25,360
And i'm sure we'll probably come across it if it's here

4108
07:01:29,279 --> 07:01:31,200
But thank you lewd sheep

4109
07:01:31,200 --> 07:01:34,880
Uh trotter. Thanks for the 250. Hey germaine. I just got my one year sub badge

I really appreciate the support. Thanks for being around for that long. Thanks for being subbed for a year

4115
07:02:00,040 --> 07:02:05,159
That's 12 straight months that you have decided that I am worth your five dollars a buck

4116
07:02:06,580 --> 07:02:09,380
For more considering whatever potential tier

4117
07:02:10,869 --> 07:02:12,709
Thank you

4118
07:02:12,709 --> 07:02:17,799

Thank you abomination zero for the five dollars and ten cents germa. I need your help with a magic trick

4120
07:02:21,799 --> 07:02:27,240
Can you act like you're playing and then show yourself holding up the three of clubs and say is this your card?

4121
07:02:28,200 --> 07:02:36,209
Uh, yeah, okay

07:02:50,819 --> 07:02:54,869
it's no

4125
07:02:54,869 --> 07:02:56,389
Apparently not

4126
07:02:56,389 --> 07:03:11,080
There you go. What if you want to do with it? Go ahead. Thank you for the five dollars and ten cents

4127
07:03:11,080 --> 07:03:13,799
Thank you the lemonade parade for the ten dollars

Oh, wait a minute here. Thank you for the ten bucks. First of all and second of all

4129
07:03:20,639 --> 07:03:23,439
Tried the tuna and pretzel thing you said to try

4130
07:03:24,400 --> 07:03:27,029
It changed my life

4131
07:03:27,270 --> 07:03:31,110
Knew somebody and knew it

4132
07:03:31,349 --> 07:03:33,349
All you had to do is taste it

4133
07:03:33,509 --> 07:03:35,270
and realize

4134
07:03:35,270 --> 07:03:37,889
I hope more of you do that

4135
07:03:37,970 --> 07:03:41,540
Tuna i'm talking tuna like from the can

4136
07:03:42,340 --> 07:03:46,740
With mayonnaise whipped up crushed up like it's gonna go in a sandwich. Don't put it in the sandwich

4137
07:03:47,220 --> 07:03:53,700
Get pretzel sticks or a regular pretzel doesn't matter crispy ones and slide it smear it on the with the tuna eat it

4138
07:03:54,500 --> 07:03:55,700
Trust me

4139
07:03:55,779 --> 07:04:00,419
Uh does she do it do it. I don't care if you try it once and then you hate it

4140
07:04:01,060 --> 07:04:03,060
Come tell me you hated it

4141
07:04:03,540 --> 07:04:05,540

They were like 4,800 people on that stream. So one out of uh, 5 000 is

4145
07:04:16,479 --> 07:04:21,520
Okay, but that's not a very good number. But still nobody said it wasn't nobody came here and said it was bad

4146
07:04:22,400 --> 07:04:30,389
Uh, thank you frody weapon for the 250. Hey germ congrats on your vine

Wrestle participation

4148
07:04:33,599 --> 07:04:37,279
That's right. I was in it. It was a lot of fun. We're not gonna do any spoilers

4149
07:04:37,840 --> 07:04:39,840
Because there are people that may not have seen it yet

4150
07:04:40,560 --> 07:04:43,459
They want to watch it

4151
07:04:43,459 --> 07:04:44,439

Yes, it is

4157
07:05:11,430 --> 07:05:18,610
I have not seen that movie in a long time. I remember it being a very good movie though

4158
07:05:19,169 --> 07:05:23,970
That was when christian bale was really starting to kind of become

4159
07:05:25,080 --> 07:05:27,080
an a-list actor, right

4160
07:05:27,799 --> 07:05:31,439

07:05:31,439 --> 07:05:33,439
two dollars and 50 cents from snooze

4162
07:05:35,240 --> 07:05:36,919
And snooze says

4163
07:05:36,919 --> 07:05:41,729
Hey germ, I doodled some of your pals a few days ago and people in the discord seemed to like it

I love how shito has legs

4167
07:05:53,119 --> 07:05:54,959
Shido is a scorpion

4168
07:05:54,959 --> 07:06:00,639
That's very cute. Anyways, your streams are such genuine positive points in my week

4169
07:06:01,119 --> 07:06:04,799

forever grateful that that people think that people think that this

4175
07:06:21,400 --> 07:06:23,400
Stuff that happens on this stream is worth drawing

4176
07:06:24,930 --> 07:06:27,169
fan art for or community art for

4177
07:06:31,040 --> 07:06:33,360

Every day i'm just like is this like really is this like really happening?

Wear bots

4185
07:07:10,560 --> 07:07:12,560
I don't believe that

4186
07:07:12,560 --> 07:07:18,709
Am I a deep fake?

4187
07:07:18,869 --> 07:07:20,229
I don't know

4188
07:07:20,229 --> 07:07:22,849
I don't think so

4189
07:07:22,849 --> 07:07:26,049
This whole stream could have been a deep fake and you would never know but snooze

4190
07:07:26,689 --> 07:07:29,889
That's uh, very very very awesome stuff. Thank you for the art

4191
07:07:31,720 --> 07:07:34,680
i'm kind of realizing that shito and fireman could be

4192
07:07:36,240 --> 07:07:39,040
related somehow

4193
07:07:39,040 --> 07:07:41,439
Somewhere down the road

4194
07:07:41,439 --> 07:07:44,080

4197
07:07:52,720 --> 07:08:10,130
This shit is fucking freaky

4198
07:08:10,930 --> 07:08:12,930

4199
07:08:13,880 --> 07:08:20,979
less creepy

4200
07:08:23,599 --> 07:08:34,549
Uh by less creepy you mean somehow more creepy who comes up with this shit

4201
07:08:36,369 --> 07:08:45,840
How do you even make a program that's capable of doing that it's the eyes the eyes are freaking me out

4202
07:08:55,720 --> 07:08:57,720
Yeah, I don't know what it is about the eyes

07:08:58,319 --> 07:09:00,319
One of them's like off

4204
07:09:00,639 --> 07:09:02,240

4218
07:10:15,360 --> 07:10:18,720
The stream ended before you could finish the thought right? Right. That's right. I forgot about that

4219
07:10:21,240 --> 07:10:24,919
I was about seconds away from talking about how I wanted to start to do a thing

4220
07:10:25,639 --> 07:10:27,639
And the internet turned up

4221
07:10:32,130 --> 07:10:34,130
So let me actually go over that real quickly

4222
07:10:35,479 --> 07:10:38,119
Because so many people give so much interesting stuff on these streams

4223
07:10:39,250 --> 07:10:41,250
I would rather set up

4224
07:10:41,250 --> 07:10:43,680
like once or twice a month

4225
07:10:43,680 --> 07:10:45,040
a

4226
07:10:45,040 --> 07:10:49,360
Community video night community art night kind of bunch them all together

4227
07:10:50,240 --> 07:10:54,979
So we can do them all

4228
07:10:54,979 --> 07:10:59,459
Because it seems like every couple streams is like another video that's somebody spent a lot of time on

4229
07:11:00,099 --> 07:11:02,979
There's some artwork that people have submitted into

4230
07:11:03,619 --> 07:11:05,619
the creative channel in the discord

4231
07:11:06,020 --> 07:11:08,020
I think that maybe once or twice a month

4232
07:11:08,259 --> 07:11:09,939
doing a

4233
07:11:09,939 --> 07:11:11,139
Hey look

4234
07:11:11,139 --> 07:11:15,619
There's like five or six videos and like 12 pieces of artwork

4235
07:11:16,180 --> 07:11:19,459
And just for like an hour or so either before or after a stream just go over it

4236
07:11:22,990 --> 07:11:24,990
Especially especially

4237
07:11:25,470 --> 07:11:27,069
The video stuff

4238
07:11:27,069 --> 07:11:30,990
Because it really feels like oh, hey jerma his video. All right, let's uh, put it on right now

4239
07:11:31,549 --> 07:11:33,549
And maybe there's not as many people here

4240
07:11:33,549 --> 07:11:37,310
They maybe would want to see it too. And if they knew that it was oh, he's gonna do video stuff

4241
07:11:37,950 --> 07:11:39,950
Then maybe they would stick around for it

4242
07:11:40,509 --> 07:11:45,810
But that's what I was gonna talk about before

4243
07:11:45,810 --> 07:11:47,810
But in case let me see

4244
07:11:49,709 --> 07:11:51,709
I want to see a yen when

4245
07:11:54,740 --> 07:11:58,220
I have some art links. Let me make sure that I can get these open

4246
07:11:58,779 --> 07:12:08,509
Um, no, I can't wait to see this I got the links now

4247
07:12:11,790 --> 07:12:19,599
Oh man, this is awesome. This is fucking awesome

4248
07:12:25,250 --> 07:12:27,250
All right, let me get these on the screen because these are great

4249
07:12:29,970 --> 07:12:33,009
Let's see, this is gonna be probably really high resolution. See if we can get it on here

4250
07:12:34,209 --> 07:12:36,290
This is uh what yen when it says

4251
07:12:37,090 --> 07:12:40,049
What they imagine the carnival stream what I would look like on the carnival stream

4252
07:12:41,009 --> 07:12:56,979
You might be and you might be pretty close let's get it on there man

4253
07:13:01,970 --> 07:13:13,549
I need to have like a better system for this too

4254
07:13:15,950 --> 07:13:17,950
Because my files are like all over the place

4255
07:13:20,380 --> 07:13:23,180
Is my windows crashing right now? What are you doing?

4256
07:13:24,060 --> 07:13:35,119
Here we go. Ready?

4257
07:13:40,700 --> 07:13:49,150
Let's get a good view of this

4258
07:13:49,470 --> 07:13:51,470
You might be onto something here

4259
07:13:51,630 --> 07:14:03,020
Let's get let's get right into the face the eyebrows are the best

4260
07:14:11,569 --> 07:14:13,569
I can't wait to do that stream

4261
07:14:15,659 --> 07:14:17,580
I want nothing more than to have that done

4262
07:14:18,220 --> 07:14:20,419
now

4263
07:14:20,419 --> 07:14:22,419
All in due time. It'll be worth the wait

4264
07:14:22,740 --> 07:14:25,939
And then here's another one. Let's go. Djerba base face

4265
07:14:26,500 --> 07:14:31,380
Which is the start of it. This is kind of what I would look like without the

4266
07:14:34,189 --> 07:14:44,700
Makeup on I don't know how some of you. I don't know how some of you guys get this detail

4267
07:14:53,680 --> 07:14:57,139
It's so good

4268
07:14:59,099 --> 07:15:02,060
Thank you so much for these. Yeah, man, they're awesome as always

4269
07:15:03,549 --> 07:15:07,630
We see what I mean. Like I want I this is doing this like once every month or so

4270
07:15:08,349 --> 07:15:11,979
Would be great

4271
07:15:11,979 --> 07:15:15,740
With videos or other it doesn't have to be just art or just videos. It could be anything

4272
07:15:16,380 --> 07:15:22,139
But those are fantastic. Thank you so much

4273
07:15:23,950 --> 07:15:26,590
So much time so much energy and so much effort went into those

4274
07:15:27,389 --> 07:15:29,389
And all the other art that I get

4275
07:15:29,709 --> 07:15:30,909
and videos

4276
07:15:30,909 --> 07:15:34,590
Some of you guys spend weeks on shit and I wish there was more I could say

4277
07:15:36,430 --> 07:15:40,110
Some of you guys are so talented. Thank you so much for this fucking incredible stuff

4278
07:15:47,069 --> 07:15:49,299
Damn

Good luck to you. Uh squid harry

4303
07:17:55,900 --> 07:18:05,639
Halo soft boy. Thanks for the 250. Hey, if you're interested in more roguelikes that look fun. I've heard of cataclysm

4304
07:18:06,419 --> 07:18:08,180
dark days ahead

4305
07:18:08,180 --> 07:18:09,459
ilona

4306
07:18:09,459 --> 07:18:10,560
rimworld

4307
07:18:10,560 --> 07:18:12,560
factorio space station

4308
07:18:13,200 --> 07:18:15,200
space station 13

4309
07:18:15,279 --> 07:18:18,159
Yeah, i've heard of space station 13

4310
07:18:18,159 --> 07:18:20,159
And then he said shout out to seph

4311
07:18:21,319 --> 07:18:22,459
zentich

4312
07:18:22,459 --> 07:18:24,299
This was a fun stream

4313
07:18:24,299 --> 07:18:33,520
It was a fun game

4314
07:18:33,520 --> 07:18:35,200
I very much enjoyed it

4315
07:18:35,200 --> 07:18:39,689
It's kind of a more of a play the game and hang out with chat kind of stream

4316
07:18:40,650 --> 07:18:42,560
But those are

4317
07:18:42,560 --> 07:18:44,560
I I had blessed it was great

4318
07:18:44,560 --> 07:18:47,869
It's a good experience

4319
07:18:47,869 --> 07:18:52,270
Thank you tingy for the 250. I missed the old germa the one that always had an end of stream joke

4320
07:18:52,750 --> 07:18:55,790
Not this new germa will all we get is an end of stream voice

4321
07:18:59,680 --> 07:19:03,950
All right, fine

4322
07:19:03,950 --> 07:19:05,279
All right

4323
07:19:05,279 --> 07:19:09,040
Fine you want to get i'll do it now, but now you know what's happening and it's over

4324
07:19:12,889 --> 07:19:16,569
Thank you tingy. Thank you tingy for your 10 subs too. We came with a lot of subs earlier

4325
07:19:18,119 --> 07:19:20,119
And those subs are going to be on the screen right now

4326
07:19:25,479 --> 07:19:27,479
I can't really express

4327
07:19:29,000 --> 07:19:31,849
how

4328
07:19:31,849 --> 07:19:33,849
how much I

4329
07:19:33,849 --> 07:19:35,849
Really really really appreciate

4330
07:19:38,279 --> 07:19:42,000
everybody's support here

4331
07:19:42,000 --> 07:19:46,400
Sometimes when you you know, if you're not live, this is a kind of a streamer insider thing

4332
07:19:46,400 --> 07:19:51,599
I'm sure other people have talked about but if you're not live for like four or five six days in a row

4333
07:19:52,319 --> 07:19:54,639
People tend to kind of drop off in subs

4334
07:19:55,360 --> 07:19:58,959
And that's fine. It's a bit perfectly understandable where you're not obligated to give anybody anything

4335
07:19:59,599 --> 07:20:01,439
money wise on the stream

4336
07:20:01,439 --> 07:20:02,959
But I noticed that

4337
07:20:02,959 --> 07:20:06,639
Almost nobody it stayed almost exactly the same for like a week ago

4338
07:20:08,400 --> 07:20:10,400
And I opened that up and I was like, holy shit

4339
07:20:11,360 --> 07:20:13,799
So

4340
07:20:13,799 --> 07:20:17,560
everybody that continues to sub to this channel even when i'm not live that's

4341
07:20:20,159 --> 07:20:22,080
I have no words

4342
07:20:22,080 --> 07:20:23,200
Thank you

4343
07:20:23,200 --> 07:20:34,299
Because that was one of the first things I noticed was like, oh, holy shit like nobody everybody's still here. You're all still here

4344
07:20:39,099 --> 07:20:44,860
Sometimes you get in your head as a streamer or a youtuber like oh, they're still gonna be here in a week or two

4345
07:20:45,819 --> 07:20:49,599
Thanks for being here. Why would they leave?

4346
07:20:50,319 --> 07:20:54,700
It's not that they wouldn't or they would it's just that sometimes it's um

4347
07:20:55,659 --> 07:21:02,509
Goes through your head sometimes if people still having a good time. Is this still people are still having fun

4348
07:21:03,069 --> 07:21:06,619
Do people still like me?

4349
07:21:06,619 --> 07:21:08,619
So, thank you

4350
07:21:08,779 --> 07:21:12,959
They're gonna be on screen right now

4351
07:21:12,959 --> 07:21:21,099
Really appreciate it everybody

4352
07:21:21,099 --> 07:21:23,099
Two years and i'm still here. That's what I mean

4353
07:21:23,979 --> 07:21:26,840

4355
07:21:40,349 --> 07:21:46,509
I remember you passed your prime, but we love you

4357
07:21:48,990 --> 07:21:50,990
Just wait just

4358
07:21:52,720 --> 07:21:58,400
I know that i'm 34. You don't have to tell me i'm already very well aware of that

4359
07:21:59,869 --> 07:22:03,790
I'll be 35 in a year. Do you understand? I know that

4360
07:22:08,029 --> 07:22:11,310
You're not that old and then there it is get in my head again. I don't know what to do

4361
07:22:14,909 --> 07:22:16,909
I'm not 34. Haha. Take that

4362
07:22:17,310 --> 07:22:27,720
No

4363
07:22:27,799 --> 07:22:29,439
As

4364
07:22:29,439 --> 07:22:33,119

Oh, I got the best. Yeah, I know. I really I think I think I got one of the best communities on twitch

Everybody, you know, my community is just the best. They're so awesome. Everybody

4396
07:24:45,979 --> 07:24:47,240

You find me you've no no fuck that listen to me

4398
07:24:50,360 --> 07:24:57,319
You find me a community of people that could put together the green screen videos for like seven straight hours. Really

4399
07:24:58,119 --> 07:25:04,189
I don't think you could

4400
07:25:04,189 --> 07:25:15,959
You you find that

4401
07:25:15,959 --> 07:25:17,799
Someone made a deep fake of you

4402
07:25:17,799 --> 07:25:23,720
Yeah, i'm telling you every every stream. There's like something new that somebody made that was creative and really really funny and interesting

4403
07:25:26,169 --> 07:25:30,729
You're gonna need a uh, uh minus two minus two. Shut up. Shut up. Don't minus two me

4404
07:25:30,889 --> 07:25:34,169
You're gonna need a like streamer metal detector that's set to funny like

4405
07:25:36,009 --> 07:25:37,849
To try to find a better one

4406
07:25:37,849 --> 07:25:54,639
Fucking comedy. All right, let's keep going. But no seriously that there's a lot of

4407
07:25:55,439 --> 07:25:57,439
There's a lot of funny people that are in this community

4408
07:25:59,240 --> 07:26:02,319
It's proven all the time

4409
07:26:02,319 --> 07:26:04,319
You know what i'm talking about. I don't even say anymore

4410
07:26:04,799 --> 07:26:13,000
Got to end this doctor's here, too

4411
07:26:13,000 --> 07:26:16,919
How many times has a bit message come in that says hey germa, i'm a fucking doctor

4412
07:26:17,790 --> 07:26:19,310
i'm a scientist

4413
07:26:19,310 --> 07:26:22,540
I fly planes

4414
07:26:22,540 --> 07:26:24,439
It's almost it's like

4415
07:26:24,439 --> 07:26:26,439
75 of every message

4416
07:26:36,099 --> 07:26:39,939
But I can't help it I if there's things to play with in front of me i'm going to play with them

4417
07:26:39,939 --> 07:26:44,360
I'm sorry. I put them down

4418
07:26:48,150 --> 07:27:04,950
Oh, you got the 10 000 seagulls time to delete the command using somebody else's achievements as a flex

4419
07:27:06,069 --> 07:27:08,069
No, that means that I

4420
07:27:08,229 --> 07:27:10,229
This stream this streamer here

4421
07:27:10,630 --> 07:27:14,470
Doctors gravitate towards this streamer doctors scientists lawyers

4422
07:27:15,750 --> 07:27:18,470
plane flyers

4423
07:27:18,549 --> 07:27:22,709
Pilot, you know, they gravitate towards this stream. Why why are there so many doctors here?

4424
07:27:37,959 --> 07:27:40,040
They're worried about you

4425
07:27:40,040 --> 07:27:45,560
Yeah, I heard about this guy chairman on at five. He's like we're getting fucked up. He had a bunch of like intestinal problems

4426
07:27:45,880 --> 07:27:48,119
Maybe I should probably check that out and see if I can help him

4427
07:27:48,759 --> 07:27:58,549
I'm being written down in like a textbook

4428
07:28:07,080 --> 07:28:09,080
Very thoughtful of you guys. Yeah

4429
07:28:10,069 --> 07:28:12,069
All right, let's let's keep going

4430
07:28:14,409 --> 07:28:16,409
Okay, you know when money stinks

4431
07:28:18,950 --> 07:28:21,110
Oh this this money stinks

4432
07:28:22,549 --> 07:28:25,509
That heavy heavy heavy like iron

4433
07:28:26,950 --> 07:28:28,950
Smell that like metal

4434
07:28:29,029 --> 07:28:32,709
Like sweaty hands metal smell. This is disgusting. I haven't even touched this

4435
07:28:34,490 --> 07:28:37,209
I I just picked it up and it just filled the whole room

4436
07:28:47,860 --> 07:28:49,860
I'm gonna wash this money. Is that weird?

4437
07:28:50,740 --> 07:28:56,119
Would it be weird if you just filled up a little bowl of soapy water and watched the money?

4438
07:29:02,220 --> 07:29:03,740
Is that weird?

4439
07:29:03,740 --> 07:29:05,979
Why would that be weird?

4440
07:29:06,139 --> 07:29:08,860
I don't want germs on my hands from the money from all the random people

4441
07:29:09,500 --> 07:29:14,169
You know how many people probably look, you know, how many people probably touched this quarter?

4442
07:29:16,549 --> 07:29:19,500
A lot probably

4443
07:29:19,500 --> 07:29:21,500
This is probably at least a handful of people that touch that

4444
07:29:21,979 --> 07:29:24,860
Probably like 50

4445
07:29:27,529 --> 07:29:33,110
I don't know how many people think touch this penny. I don't think touch these quarters

4446
07:29:33,990 --> 07:29:36,919
He's a fucking magician. He's pretty damn good

4447
07:29:41,669 --> 07:29:43,669
Hey, hey, hey, hey

4448
07:29:44,459 --> 07:29:45,580
Hey

4449
07:29:45,580 --> 07:29:47,750
How many people think touch this penny?

4450
07:29:48,869 --> 07:29:50,869
No strings. I don't have strings here

4451
07:29:51,580 --> 07:29:55,080
No strings

4452
07:29:55,080 --> 07:29:56,599
I'll prove it

4453
07:29:56,599 --> 07:30:04,790
How many people touch this penny? I don't know you tell me guys

4454
07:30:19,909 --> 07:30:26,889
fake

4455
07:30:26,889 --> 07:30:30,840
I'm pretty fucking good

4456
07:30:30,840 --> 07:30:34,700
Hey

4457
07:30:34,700 --> 07:30:37,799
Hey

4458
07:30:37,799 --> 07:30:46,459
Hold on. Hey

4459
07:30:46,459 --> 07:30:49,340
Hey, nothing in my hands, right?

4460
07:30:49,500 --> 07:30:54,139
Nothing to me. Nothing in my hair. Nothing in the hair, right? No wires. No, nothing. Keep an eye on my hands

4461
07:30:55,099 --> 07:30:58,889
Got one

4462
07:30:58,889 --> 07:31:05,500
How did that happen?

4463
07:31:05,500 --> 07:31:15,220
You're gonna pull off your wig

4464
07:31:23,619 --> 07:31:25,619
All right, i'm fucking out of here

4465
07:31:26,659 --> 07:31:29,860
Thank you to uh, thank you to dubski dude for the 250

4466
07:31:30,659 --> 07:31:35,159
Hey germa the following is my most upvoted post on reddit surprisingly

4467
07:31:35,159 --> 07:31:41,240
But something tells me you and chat would enjoy it first link is an image second is a quick story. Both are stream safe

4468
07:31:42,360 --> 07:31:45,400
I love that's like a free text. Hey, everything's stream safe

4469
07:31:46,040 --> 07:31:51,540
Um, you didn't actually do this though, right?

4470
07:31:52,939 --> 07:31:54,619
germa doesn't

4471
07:31:54,619 --> 07:31:59,740
Mod me in the next 24 hours. I'm taking this picture at home depot and asking them what they think

4472
07:32:00,700 --> 07:32:05,740
This has 1.2. This has one almost one and a half thousand uploads

4473
07:32:11,189 --> 07:32:14,819
Okay, so wait

4474
07:32:14,819 --> 07:32:20,180
Yesterday I posted this pic demanding that I be modded or I unironically would visit home depot and show them the image

4475
07:32:20,900 --> 07:32:23,220
My demands were not met. The story is true

4476
07:32:24,729 --> 07:32:26,729
Everyone says that's the story is true

4477
07:32:26,810 --> 07:32:28,810
Uh right before his story is not true

4478
07:32:29,529 --> 07:32:34,759
I started up by printing the a aforementioned picture onto a seven by ten executive paper

4479
07:32:35,240 --> 07:32:38,599
Quality the print was a b-plus in my opinion, but it was lightly smeared by some

4480
07:32:39,319 --> 07:32:42,040
Rogue drops of cherry juice. I needed my vitamin c that morning

4481
07:32:42,520 --> 07:32:45,639
I couldn't redo the print as I had work in five hours and I didn't want to be late

4482
07:32:46,360 --> 07:32:49,720
It was the moment I found myself in my car only a few minutes from home depot

4483
07:32:50,200 --> 07:32:54,200
That I knew I had made a mistake. I'm just a regular person and these are people and not twitch chat

4484
07:32:54,200 --> 07:32:56,759
They can't even conceive of basic germa memes

4485
07:32:57,479 --> 07:33:01,319
This was just some depraved inside joke that I was about to take uh too far

4486
07:33:01,400 --> 07:33:07,000
I started to sweat and grip the steering wheel tightly but all I could think of was you missed that one try another

4487
07:33:07,319 --> 07:33:11,159
Playing over over and in my head. I wasn't gonna miss this one. Oh my god

4488
07:33:12,439 --> 07:33:22,069
I parked my car in a handicap zone. I'd only be there for a few hours. So no big deal. All right

4489
07:33:22,869 --> 07:33:28,650
Come on. I just needed to focus and take deep breaths else. I would have had no story to share with the subreddit

4490
07:33:30,119 --> 07:33:34,439
These upvotes are really important to me. What else would I derive my own self-worth from?

4491
07:33:34,759 --> 07:33:38,069
I

4492
07:33:38,069 --> 07:33:41,669
Entered the store and was hit with the trademark smell of fresh wood and paint thinner

4493
07:33:42,229 --> 07:33:46,580
It doesn't smell like that. I must have stepped in a puddle while walking in

4494
07:33:47,060 --> 07:33:51,860
But that was the least of my concerns. My knees had already started shaking and a crick in my neck was acting up

4495
07:33:52,740 --> 07:33:55,459
I felt like the terror. I was experiencing by what?

4496
07:34:01,610 --> 07:34:05,900
That the bathroom upholstery section was where I found myself

4497
07:34:06,779 --> 07:34:12,459
my anxiety would spike every time I came within five feet of another person and I tense up because I couldn't shake the thought that

4498
07:34:12,860 --> 07:34:17,580
Everyone knew why I was here and that they knew that I knew what they knew

4499
07:34:17,740 --> 07:34:21,580
I avoided eye contact at all costs and it would talk to myself out loud

4500
07:34:22,060 --> 07:34:27,900
Anytime someone would walk by and attempt to make it seem like I was preoccupied. This toilet is a b-plus. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

4501
07:34:29,849 --> 07:34:31,849
This is a long fucking story

4502
07:34:32,569 --> 07:34:38,090
As an afterthought I glanced towards the rental section. I saw an employee. They didn't seem busy. That was it

4503
07:34:38,810 --> 07:34:41,610
Uh, this was it. I had come so far already and I couldn't back out now

4504
07:34:41,610 --> 07:34:43,610
My knees began to visibly wobble

4505
07:34:43,930 --> 07:34:45,930
And my shoes were covered in paint thinner

4506
07:34:46,409 --> 07:34:49,130
Well, that was the puddle. Why hadn't they cleaned that off the floor?

4507
07:34:49,369 --> 07:34:54,330
Fuck, I don't know. But before I knew I was up in front of uh, this female home depot clerks, uh

4508
07:34:55,849 --> 07:34:58,650
She looked up at me with baby blue eyes. How can I help you?

4509
07:35:03,849 --> 07:35:07,290
It felt like all my internal organs had crowded into my throat. I was stunned

4510
07:35:07,770 --> 07:35:10,169
I didn't know what to say. What the hell was I doing here?

4511
07:35:10,169 --> 07:35:13,610
I had driven all this way to show some innocent person a photoshop picture of a twitch streamer

4512
07:35:13,930 --> 07:35:15,930
And I truly lost my damn mind the print

4513
07:35:16,970 --> 07:35:18,650
out of my hand

4514
07:35:18,650 --> 07:35:24,090
Was drenched in sweat cherry juice and paint thinner which had smeared the ink into a bizarre collage of colors and shapes

4515
07:35:24,490 --> 07:35:30,490
My hands were trembling but as I was on autopilot. I laid it on the counter and I said well, what do you think of this?

4516
07:35:31,610 --> 07:35:35,130
It felt like time had stopped I was done for I would never be able to live with myself after this

4517
07:35:35,290 --> 07:35:37,689
The employee squinted at the picture with a very confused look on her face

4518
07:35:38,090 --> 07:35:41,930
Is this she whispered and then paused the pause felt like an eternity

4519
07:35:42,409 --> 07:35:47,369
I should just turn and get out of the store. I should just leave now and undo the damage i'd done myself confidence

4520
07:35:48,090 --> 07:35:51,610
But my feet were like concrete the paint on my shoes was particularly thin at that point

4521
07:35:52,490 --> 07:35:54,490
Is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?

4522
07:35:56,630 --> 07:36:01,349
A huge burden. This is how you know the story ain't real a huge burden instantly rolled off my chest

4523
07:36:01,349 --> 07:36:04,150
I couldn't believe my luck another human being in my town that understood

4524
07:36:04,709 --> 07:36:09,110
We both began shouting the most obscure germa memes in the store and our celebration caused quite the scene

4525
07:36:10,310 --> 07:36:13,669
Customers began gathering in a crowd around us. It was twitch chat

4526
07:36:13,669 --> 07:36:20,470
They were pog champs and germa hearts and germa chomps bits rain like confetti and even nightbot was there muting a few people

4527
07:36:20,549 --> 07:36:22,549
Oh that nightbot

4528
07:36:23,029 --> 07:36:29,369
Okay, why am I reading this whole thing?

4529
07:36:29,750 --> 07:36:31,029
Why am I doing this?

4530
07:36:31,029 --> 07:36:35,990
But then the absolute worst thing imaginable happened the home depot manager drawn by the commotion stomped through the crowd

4531
07:36:36,310 --> 07:36:39,349
He had a grill master xbbq badge on his chest

4532
07:36:41,000 --> 07:36:43,000
He looked me dead in the eyes and said

4533
07:36:43,979 --> 07:36:46,299
Why the hell did you bother writing this entire thing?

4534
07:36:48,020 --> 07:36:51,939
I was dumbfounded. How did he know all I could do was turn to you the reader and ask you

4535
07:36:52,419 --> 07:36:54,790
Why did you read all this?

4536
07:36:54,790 --> 07:36:57,509
Your eyes drifted down the length of this final sentence in your brain

4537
07:36:58,229 --> 07:37:00,229
In your brain, you heard the word jubated

4538
07:37:00,790 --> 07:37:02,630
gg idiot

4539
07:37:02,630 --> 07:37:19,540
That's it. Remember we talked about deep fakes

4540
07:37:22,709 --> 07:37:24,709
in like 50 years

4541
07:37:26,250 --> 07:37:28,340
Like this story

4542
07:37:28,340 --> 07:37:30,340
Is just gonna be here

4543
07:37:32,470 --> 07:37:35,349
Somebody is gonna come across this somehow somewhere

4544
07:37:36,229 --> 07:37:37,990
100 years from now

4545
07:37:37,990 --> 07:37:39,990
And be like what the fuck happened here?

4546
07:37:43,270 --> 07:37:47,029
Who was this person that they're talking about who wrote this?

4547
07:37:51,419 --> 07:37:53,849
You know how many of these exist

4548
07:37:53,849 --> 07:37:55,049
this

4549
07:37:55,049 --> 07:37:57,049
The in like 200 years

4550
07:37:58,500 --> 07:38:00,659
People are gonna have so much trouble interpreting

4551
07:38:01,639 --> 07:38:13,619
Human history, you know, like we don't know really what the hell happened like fucking thousand years ago

4552
07:38:15,270 --> 07:38:17,590
We are reading like for I don't know like for instance, um

4553
07:38:19,610 --> 07:38:21,610
Like shit that happened in like the fucking 1400s

4554
07:38:23,259 --> 07:38:27,500
That shit was like written down and like spoken and passed down from person to person

4555
07:38:28,060 --> 07:38:32,939
Who knows if one of those stories that you heard about like king fucking edward the second or whatever

4556
07:38:33,340 --> 07:38:36,779
Could just be a a jubated twitch chat to somebody made it up for fun

4557
07:38:38,389 --> 07:38:47,400
How would you ever even know?

4558
07:38:47,400 --> 07:38:51,880
Who knows if half of this history the material in history could have just been a shit post

4559
07:38:54,500 --> 07:39:01,220
And they were laughing about it like could you imagine in 2000 years if they ever find the home depot story

4560
07:39:05,659 --> 07:39:11,419
In in fucking 500 years, there's gonna be an hbo special about this post

4561
07:39:15,720 --> 07:39:18,439
There'll be a seven-part mini series about this post

4562
07:39:19,159 --> 07:39:28,700
That's literally what mythology is

4563
07:39:28,779 --> 07:39:32,000
Yeah in the 500 years, we're gonna be the mythology

4564
07:39:40,139 --> 07:39:48,459
What is our legacy?

4565
07:39:49,340 --> 07:39:58,630
I'm worthy of being mythology

4566
07:40:00,549 --> 07:40:04,549
HBO is gonna be around in 500 years. What the fuck is gonna be around in 500 years?

4567
07:40:05,430 --> 07:40:08,310
Don't you kind of just want to know?

4568
07:40:09,349 --> 07:40:12,069
What's gonna be the most popular tv show in 500 years?

4569
07:40:15,700 --> 07:40:17,700
What is it gonna be? What is it?

4570
07:40:19,049 --> 07:40:21,049
What store are people gonna go into?

4571
07:40:23,000 --> 07:40:27,159
What's everybody's favorite food? What's the pizza of 500 years in the future?

4572
07:40:28,119 --> 07:40:30,220
Is it still pizza?

4573
07:40:30,299 --> 07:40:32,380
I mean pizzas lasted a pretty long damn time

4574
07:40:33,509 --> 07:40:35,509
people eating pizza like

4575
07:40:35,909 --> 07:40:38,970
Saint

4576
07:40:38,970 --> 07:40:40,490
Christopher Columbus

4577
07:40:40,490 --> 07:40:42,169
Was eating pizza

4578
07:40:42,169 --> 07:40:53,740
That's not that long ago

4579
07:40:54,060 --> 07:41:03,270
He was eating papa jobs

4580
07:41:07,270 --> 07:41:09,270
It's probably still gonna be pizza

4581
07:41:10,380 --> 07:41:17,099
And this home depot story do I genuinely think there will be humans in 500 years?

4582
07:41:17,659 --> 07:41:20,700
Well, apparently because I can't retire. I have to I have to keep streaming. So

4583
07:41:22,840 --> 07:41:31,029
I hope so there better be

4584
07:41:31,110 --> 07:41:34,069

4585
07:41:35,799 --> 07:41:39,560

I think I played destiny 2 for

4597
07:42:17,740 --> 07:42:20,779
A little while but in my brain destiny 2 and the division 2 are the same game

4598
07:42:25,080 --> 07:42:27,080
I I cannot separate them

4599
07:42:27,720 --> 07:42:30,439
You know like the it's the same image joke. It's that

4600
07:42:31,240 --> 07:42:35,799
I just every time I hear of division 2. It's destiny 2 every time I hear of destiny 2. It's division 2

4601
07:42:40,630 --> 07:42:42,630
I don't know. They're not I know they're not

4602
07:42:49,900 --> 07:42:53,740
They are are they?

4603
07:42:53,740 --> 07:42:54,779
