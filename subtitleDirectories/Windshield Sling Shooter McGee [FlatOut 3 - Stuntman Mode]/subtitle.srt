1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,140
Some of these characters are so stupid.

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,570
I'll definitely be in this guy.

3
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,570
Oh my god, it's Zario.

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,000
I wonder why this guy's name is Zario.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,429
Might have something to do with it. He looks like-

6
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,429
He even does a Super Mario jump!

7
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:29,429
Did you see that shit?

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,500
He just did the Super Mario jump!

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
I'm not sure if you're talking to me or talking to everyone else.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Watch out for the copyright infringed copyright strike.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,259
The evil windmill.

12
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,259
Are you ready?

13
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:44,259
I'm gonna destroy you.

14
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:46,259
Is it my turn first? Who goes first? Me?

15
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:48,439
Uh, we're both here.

16
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,439
Oh, well I'm going.

17
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,320
What?

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,840
You didn't make it uphill. Okay, my turn.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
You used your turn.

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,659
Wait, it says press the en-

21
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,659
Wait, what?

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,390
What?

23
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:20,469
What is the goal of this?

24
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:23,060
I don't know.

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,060
Get hit by the windmill a million times, probably?

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:32,079
Got it.

27
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:40,680
I can't believe that actually happened.

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,920
It's a me, Mario.

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,480
It's a me, Zario.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,939
Industrial realism.

31
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:49,939
Highway.

32
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:53,140
Study each map for the goal.

33
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,310
Please tell me this car is just coming forward at all times.

34
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,379
Please. Please.

35
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:01,379
No.

36
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,379
Damn it, why is it called highway then?

37
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:07,549
Because we have to jump onto this freaking highway.

38
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,300
What?

39
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,699
What?

40
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah, again, you're supposed to eject before you hit it, I guess.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's what I did.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I didn't.

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
It's a me!

44
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,759
What do you mean find the goal? We're just ejecting out of the cars.

45
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,379
What is this?

46
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,379
I have no idea.

47
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:32,289
I'm kind of-

48
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:35,289
Alright, wait, study the map, study the-

49
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:42,650
We were supposed to study the map.

50
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,650
I tried to study it.

51
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,400
Study the map and get the most out of your experience.

52
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,300
Well, I'm going to try and make this jump right now.

53
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,539
Alright, me too.

54
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,370
Why does this have a 23 on Medicare?

55
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,370
This is the best game I've ever played.

56
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,569
Hit him high.

57
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,150
I have a fucking headache, dude.

58
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,150
When we were tapping triangle, you know what cartridge tilting is?

59
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,520
Yeah.

60
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
That's what was happening.

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,520
My character was stretching and it was fucking horrific.

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,520
Look at them balls.

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Oh man, this is going to be sick.

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,340
What do you even do?

65
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
Let's just go at the same time.

66
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
Speed up.

67
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,340
Don't, don't, don't.

68
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,340
We have to study and survey the area.

69
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,340
No.

70
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,340
Didn't you read?

71
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:48,629
What happened to all of my momentum?

72
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,629
It just went straight up.

73
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,639
I can't.

74
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,639
Still.

75
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,639
Dude, your car.

76
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,639
You should have seen your car.

77
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,500
You should have seen-

78
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,740
You should have seen what your car did.

79
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:15,699
Your car.

80
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:18,329
I'll make sure I get over this one.

81
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,329
This time I'm going to get four million points.

82
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,329
Yeah.

83
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,329
Come at me, bro.

84
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,329
I'm coming at the hill.

85
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:29,420
Get up there.

86
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,420
Oh, baby.

87
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,420
Oh, baby.

88
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,420
Oh, baby.

89
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,420
Oh, baby.

90
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,420
What?

91
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,790
This will be the last one.

92
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,790
I feel like, I feel like we've gotten the fly out of car thing out of our system.

93
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,699
Sort of.

94
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:47,699
Yeah.

95
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:51,750
Okay, four.

96
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,750
Score a thousand points.

97
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,699
One thousand points.

98
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:57,699
Four.

99
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:58,699
Four.

100
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,699
Four.

101
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,699
Four.

102
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:01,699
Four.
