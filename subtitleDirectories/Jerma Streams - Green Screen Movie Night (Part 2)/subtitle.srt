1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:15,210
Oh my goodness. My god. Okay, so let's see. Yeah, there's less than 200 to go.

2
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:34,969
You guys are fucking hilarious. Here we go. I was just doing a breathing exercise downstairs.

3
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:46,710
I went downstairs. I got some water. I was just going one, like two. Here we go. Welcome back.

4
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:55,350
That was by Tom McGowan, by the way. Coming up next, we've got Jax.

5
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:26,019
Jax. Yes, Jax. That's all it's called. It's John Wick. Me? I don't... Wick's here.

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,140
That's it. That's it. It was just getting started. It was just getting started. All right,

7
00:01:45,140 --> 00:02:07,480
that's not even true. We got like 11,000. How many of these dances did I do? All right. That was...

8
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:30,300
No, we're back. Do it again. Oh, there it is. Looking good. Uh, Teeny Germa.

9
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:44,900
Nice, nice. Very nice balloon entrance. Absolutely perfection.

10
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:32,840
Me, me, me, me. GermaCraft. No. The series where I play Minecraft. This is going to be a single

11
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:44,840
player. Let's play. And when I said let's play, I used that term. Longing. Son, can you give me a

12
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:53,270
little pep in one place? Hey, what's going on? Please cut, John. What? Thanks. I love you, son.

13
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:47,610
I don't... When have I ever said this? I'm not sure how to react to this one. What's happening?

14
00:04:47,610 --> 00:05:15,399
All right. So I woke up on the side of the road. That's it. All right. That was B versus Omega

15
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:25,720
Germa. It is another Undertale reference. Bring on the Undertale. Wait, is it going to go...

16
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,899
Here it comes. By the way, if you haven't played the anime Undertale,

17
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:39,100
it's uh... Just be careful because this is a spoiler for that show.

18
00:05:51,399 --> 00:06:05,899
Holy shit. This is fucking terrifying. Holy fuck. My prized possession.

19
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:11,610
Germa eating ass certificate. I told you guys this before.

20
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,490
Red ass clap. Absolute perfection. Donald review manager of ass eating. No ifs,

21
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:22,009
ands, or buts. This right here is my ass eating certificate. Absolute perfection.

22
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:34,470
How did you... This is today. This is today. This is actually today. Oh, nice job. This is Jurassic

23
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,470
Park. Full movie.

24
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:32,620
Wait. Go back. I need to address this on stream again because listen. This picture. This is...

25
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:39,990
By the way, this is Mr. Slyne. Great fucking guy. Swell guy. Me and Slyne are the same size.

26
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:48,009
We're both 5'7 and a half. 5'8. I was leaning down in this picture. Me and Mr. Slyne are the

27
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:55,769
same size. I was pushing my fucking knees down and leaning forward. This picture is the reason

28
00:07:55,769 --> 00:08:01,050
for the internet calling me a small guy. And I'm small. I am a small guy. But not that small. Me

29
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:08,410
and Mr. Slyne are the same size. Ask him. He's a great guy. He's a fucking swell guy, by the way.

30
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:22,740
Total Maniac tries to break down your door and the situation escalates extremely fast.

31
00:08:30,740 --> 00:09:10,730
When do I try to break in? You think he would have attempted by now?

32
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,370
This is Jerma Invades Vinesauce, by the way. Vinny and I actually played... We didn't actually play it.

33
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,769
We tried to play Red Dead 2 online last night. Didn't work out. Vinny's a great guy. Vinesauce.

34
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:22,539
Check him out sometime. So you guys see what's happening with Jerma?

35
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:33,340
What's happening with Jerma? Because I don't know what the fuck is happening.

36
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:45,379
There's an Elvis impersonator. He's wearing a cloak. He's in the middle of the desert.

37
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,730
Can someone... Oh, yeah. Here's the picture. Can anyone figure out what's happening here?

38
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:02,070
I don't think he... You know. He doesn't look happy.

39
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:16,659
There it is. Hunt down the Compact Man. I don't know the... Whatever that was.

40
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:38,179
Here's the bee problem. This is just... There are no bees here.

41
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:55,940
There are no bees. Why does everybody use this? It doesn't have to be in every...

42
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,899
Alright. Speed Racer. Jerma. Jerma screenscreen stream.

43
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:24,659
All he talks about. All he seems capable of thinking about is automobile racing.

44
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,399
Racing's everything. From my family, it isn't just a sport. It's way more important than that.

45
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:43,879
It's like a religion. Are you ready to become a real race car driver? That's sign that contract.

46
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,559
He's just trying to scare you, son. What you do behind the wheel of a race car

47
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:54,200
has nothing to do with business. You walk away from me. You walk away from this deal.

48
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,440
No matter how well you drive, you won't win. You won't place. I guarantee you right now you

49
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,320
won't even finish the race. You think you can drive a car and change the world? It doesn't work

50
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,279
like that. Maybe not. Why is it so deep? The only thing I know how to do when I gotta do something.

51
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:31,220
It wasn't my idea. Oh no. It was his. Oh, it's me. It was mine.

52
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:44,100
He's going to be very good. Now he's going to be the best if they don't destroy him first.

53
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:52,340
That's pretty good. Pretty good. The Jervatrix has you.

54
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:16,659
You have to let it all go, Neo. Fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind.

55
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:19,779
Hey, can you get your hand down here? That's like a 400 foot jump.

56
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,379
I guess I'll give it a try. No, no, don't worry about me.

57
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:32,899
So what if he makes it? Who's ever made the first jump? What if he does?

58
00:14:47,240 --> 00:15:10,470
Oh, you got me. What does Jerva look like? You're tiny, tiny. It ain't the size of the

59
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,669
fucking ocean. It's how much motion is in that ocean. Like when I take a shower and I'm out of

60
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:19,029
the shower and I'm looking at myself in the full body mirror that I have and I just like

61
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:24,629
start fucking flexing and like squeezing my butt cheeks together. I go, damn, that guy's compact.

62
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:33,259
Describe what Jerva 95 looked like. Fucking tiny. Say tiny again. Say tiny again. I dare you.

63
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:41,980
I double dare you motherfucker. Say tiny one more goddamn time. Go on. He's balding. Does he look

64
00:15:41,980 --> 00:16:24,100
like an old? Yeah. Stupidest thing ever. Oh, this is called shut it all off.

65
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:32,860
Turn it off. Are you in charge of this? Turn it off. Get to shut this off. Shut them all off.

66
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,799
Turn your lights and your house off too. Another shpeak. That's it.

67
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:45,320
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of Journal Martial Arts.

68
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,320
This is the best part right here. I can't take it anymore.

69
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,600
This is my failure part. This is the best part.

70
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Stop talking. This is the best part.

71
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Nice.

72
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,599
This is terrible.

73
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,599
Absolutely terrible.

74
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,599
Nothing about this is good. Not one thing.

75
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,880
I don't know if you guys are actually really ready for this.

76
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,880
God, I hate this. I hate this.

77
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,180
Remember, if you hold shift, you don't fall off.

78
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,180
That's something I didn't know when I used to live stream this game.

79
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,180
What a god of a gamer, seriously.

80
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,180
Ready to go see our new home?

81
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,490
Alrighty then.

82
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,490
I was a little...

83
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:47,269
What?

84
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:49,269
I was a little s-word, guys.

85
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:53,269
I was a little jerk when I was younger.

86
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:55,269
This is the thing I'm talking about right here.

87
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:57,269
I've told you guys this before.

88
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:59,269
Absolute perfection.

89
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:01,269
Not very nice.

90
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:03,269
No ifs, ands, or buts.

91
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:05,269
This right here...

92
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:07,269
Absolute perfection.

93
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:09,269
I have to do it.

94
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:11,269
I have to do it.

95
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:13,269
My brother got in a fight with this kid and I heard about it.

96
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,049
And so I had to bust off one day.

97
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:20,049
Alright, this is German green screen entry.

98
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:23,569
This is called this one.

99
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,809
Idiots.

100
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
Nobody use...what?

101
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,460
I don't understand what we just watched.

102
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
But here is a Jerem intro.

103
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:40,420
Jerem intro.

104
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,849
The Elder Scrolls V.

105
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:52,579
I'm driving the chariot here.

106
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:55,009
Finally awake.

107
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:57,789
You were trying to cross the border, right?

108
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:59,789
Walked right into that Imperial ambush.

109
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:01,789
Same as us.

110
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,789
And that thief over there.

111
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:05,789
Damn you Stormcloaks.

112
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,789
Skyrim was fine until you came along.

113
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,150
I like the use of two different Germans here.

114
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,640
About three.

115
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,200
Why?

116
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
To watch the soldiers.

117
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,480
Inside the house.

118
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Why are we stopping?

119
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Why do you think?

120
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:36,009
Why am I getting up?

121
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,150
I need a fucking advil.

122
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:59,960
This stream is killing me.

123
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:10,579
It better not be the raptor.

124
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:12,579
Please no.

125
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,359
Centuries. What do you see?

126
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:35,240
This is a completely normal video where nothing happens.

127
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
I hope they're right.

128
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:45,690
You mother fucker.

129
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,690
I'm going to be the sweatiest fucking tryhard in this server.

130
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,690
I'm going to kill you.

131
00:21:53,690 --> 00:22:00,990
You're dead to me.

132
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,990
I'll tell you right now. I'm going to put my foot down.

133
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,990
It's over.

134
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:13,309
You got me.

135
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:20,140
What?

136
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:29,099
Oh.

137
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,099
German adventure.

138
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:57,140
I need to see.

139
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,140
I need to see.

140
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,559
There's less than 150 remaining.

141
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:11,750
Did you want to play for 10 with this weirdo?

142
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,750
Stick around.

143
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,990
I'm going to find a way out of here.

144
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,940
Why this pain?

145
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,369
I hate.

146
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,980
How are you guys doing?

147
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,410
Jojo.

148
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,410
Fucking bizarre adventure.

149
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:11,269
Shit.

150
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:15,109
Tardy piece of shit.

151
00:24:15,109 --> 00:24:17,730
Star Platinum the world.

152
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,099
Oh shit.

153
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:22,099
By the way, if you watch animated sequences.

154
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:24,339
That I have more than one.

155
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,339
Like 22 minutes per sequence.

156
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:29,119
And this may be 10 to 12 per long sequence.

157
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,119
And they're animated.

158
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:33,119
This one you might have.

159
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,150
It might spoil your dinner.

160
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,890
Why are all the Jojo ones so well made?

161
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,890
They're so well done.

162
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,890
I can't skip them.

163
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,890
They're so well made.

164
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,819
This is show business.

01:12:40,770 --> 01:13:03,729
oh no we didn't know what is this suggest but by that point we didn't want to know

363
01:13:03,729 --> 01:13:11,250
jeremy elbertson earlier this year was tried for the infamous father christmas killings

364
01:13:12,529 --> 01:13:18,770
after the overwhelming evidence supported by the polygraph test as well as the incident that

365
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:27,029
transpired he was sent to court to finalize the guilty verdict however during the hearing

366
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:35,250
his confession brought to light information that changed everything he said if you're good

367
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:41,409
at something never do it for free after that it was clear this man was an insane person

368
01:13:41,409 --> 01:13:48,079
and so he was sent to an asylum for psychiatric evaluation we discovered that he was in his own

369
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:55,279
little world talking to an imaginary audience we tried to make contact but he just kept spouting

370
01:13:55,279 --> 01:14:02,560
nonsense he kept saying presto majesto over and over he spoke in pure binary

371
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:14,119
list goes on no progress was made there was only one instance where he stopped talking to himself

372
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:22,789
actually responded to us during one of our interviews he told us this shuck prepared is

373
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:30,079
he is we're still trying to decide it's the best chef best celebrity chef ever

374
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:48,079
