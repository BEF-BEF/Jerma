1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:13,380
What's happening? What's up? We're playing Phasmophobia with some people.

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,929
Got a coffee here. I'm ready to go. Vod real? That's right.

3
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,879
Do the Luddie. All right. I'll listen.

4
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:37,799
I'm going to be doing VR because of the Among Us VR is coming out.

5
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,500
When I do, I will do the Luddie during when I do full cam.

6
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,530
OK. And it's going to be sick.

7
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,469
Going to be one of the best you've probably ever seen.

8
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,030
I'm just going to make that very clear.

9
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,719
Yeah. So today we're playing. I didn't tweet. Oh, shit.

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,619
We are playing Phasmophobia.

11
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:06,650
Then at dead of night.

12
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,409
Then maybe stay out of the house.

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,799
Nice to finally join us, dude.

14
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,170
Why were you here late?

15
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,420
Why are you talking? Why are you saying it like that?

16
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,379
Why are you saying it like that?

17
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:24,700
I know my I know my I know I have the radio voice today.

18
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:31,500
I know that every single stream, it seems, over the last five years.

19
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,620
I start out with the radio voice.

20
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,480
And then it slowly goes from this to this over the course of about seven hours.

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,840
I'm getting old. And that's just the way it is.

22
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,219
All right. Are we ready?

23
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:49,989
Are we good? Dinner is cold.

24
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:56,260
You change your pinned tweet.

25
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,069
Yeah. All right.

26
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:02,549
OK. Can I can I can all the social media managers of the channel

27
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:10,750
just relax for a few minutes to change your pinned tweet?

28
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,150
All right. All right. All right. All right. OK.

29
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,949
Uh, I'm I'm going to tweet a regular tweet right now as

30
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,750
asmophobic. How do you spell asmophobia?

31
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,860
Can somebody spell it?

32
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,060
Is it phasmophobia or phasmophobia?

33
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:36,340
It's like phasmophobia.

34
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:45,330
So it's phasmo. OK.

35
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,659
Asmophobia, let's go.

36
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:51,900
Let's get it. I like let's get it.

37
00:02:51,939 --> 00:03:00,810
It's better. How about phasmophobia and other scary things?

38
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:07,509
Let's get it. Yeah, that's perfect.

39
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:09,150
Hope you guys are having a good day.

40
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,830
And OK, I hope you guys are having a good day.

41
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,590
Let me just say words.

42
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,610
Well, I write the tweet. There it is.

43
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,580
All right. Here we go.

44
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,419
I wonder if everybody's ready.

45
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:27,620
I guess I don't even know how to play phasmophobia.

46
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,990
I'm a level one.

47
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:35,539
I played it like a year and a half ago.

48
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:40,539
OK, check in and see how we're doing.

49
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:44,939
Fuck, I forgot I was muted for them, but not for you guys.

50
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:46,419
How we how we doing?

51
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:50,500
How do you guys feel good?

52
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,900
My stream is running.

53
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,259
We're ready to rock and roll whenever I am.

54
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:58,819
Can you guys hear me? Yep.

55
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:03,120
All right. I'm back. Hello.

56
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,840
If I show the screen, there's nothing on the screen

57
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,840
that's not going to like leak the game code or anything, right?

58
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,500
No, it's hidden up top, right?

59
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,780
Well, cool. Yeah, game code.

60
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,099
They actually implemented that.

61
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:20,459
OK. So, yeah, once again, everybody, I have with me

62
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:29,310
Jerma Ross and Liam Triforce and also a basketball guest.

63
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,230
How do I walk a guest basketball jack-o-lanterns?

64
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,089
How do I leave this this board space?

65
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:38,699
I think. Oh, thank you.

66
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,060
All right. Yeah, there you go.

67
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,920
Who the hell is Jerma?

68
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,879
He's a famous streamer.

69
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,639
Now, now, now streamed to once or twice.

70
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,850
I watch now.

71
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,370
I mean, go watch my Anubis tutorial smite video.

72
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,430
That's what I'm known for.

73
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,819
That one.

74
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:58,740
All right. I got to make it so it's not pushed to talk

75
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,819
because I'm going to I'm going to scream something at you guys

76
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:02,610
and you're just not going to hear it.

77
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:08,100
OK. Just for the record, everyone watching, Liam and I are in VR.

78
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:10,819
Ross and Jerma are on desktop.

79
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,860
Yeah. Our experiences will be different.

80
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,569
If you want to watch Jerma's perspective,

81
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:17,689
you can go to his channel as well.

82
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:19,170
I can't tell which is which.

83
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,170
It's so funny hearing the different in each ear

84
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:27,360
because it's the positional audio that's funny.

85
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,769
Throw a football.

86
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,930
All right. Is this is this better?

87
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,529
Can you guys hear me?

88
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:36,129
Yeah, it's a good Halloween game.

89
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:39,170
Oh, well, you can keep the basketball on you if you need it.

90
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,360
Like I just have it on my belt now.

91
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Save it for later. Throw it at the ghost.

92
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,000
How do I turn some people saying that everyone were all loud, apparently?

93
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:50,379
Loud.

94
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:51,579
Is it was at the menu screen?

95
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:55,949
Is there a way I can drop people's levels in here, a tab or something?

96
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,579
The menu screen here, you can turn it.

97
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:01,620
Oh, right. OK, right, right, right.

98
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,589
Oh, OK.

99
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:06,230
Chad, everyone's good on my end, right?

100
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,350
Like they sound like human, like human with good volume.

101
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:11,870
I think that's probably a little better.

102
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,629
How's my volume? I'm OK. Yeah, everyone's good.

103
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,949
I think everybody sounds all right now.

104
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:20,029
But yeah, they did a pretty good job with the lobby.

105
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:21,790
You can see the spooky bats up there.

106
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,279
There's jack-o'-lanterns. There's done.

107
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,240
I just left the fucking game.

108
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,829
Fuck. OK, hold on.

109
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,029
I I thought it was like a leave.

110
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,709
They're going to be pissed. Hold on.

111
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:48,250
Give. We're about to start to.

112
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:51,550
OK, join game.

113
00:06:51,550 --> 00:07:01,759
I don't want to show this or walk over and like place it in.

114
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,040
OK, so leave is not leave is OK.

115
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,019
Hey, I'll be the judge of that.

116
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:11,980
I'll have to. I'll be on the corn hall committee.

117
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:15,420
I accidentally press leave game instead of leave the menu.

118
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:19,699
I would love to hear a committee.

119
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:20,899
All right. So this game is pretty dark.

120
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,500
I don't know where we're going. How do we get out of here?

121
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,980
Oh, my Jesus Christ. That was scary.

122
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,220
I didn't even see that.

123
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,259
If Chris Martin from Coldplay shocked you on some steps,

124
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:31,860
I'd be scared, too. Yes.

125
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,740
You know, I can barely see. Is there like a brightness?

126
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,899
I do. There are lights on in this room and I can't see anybody.

127
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,310
It's so dark.

128
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,269
Yeah, it's really dark.

129
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:43,110
Flashlight, I think that we can use it is

130
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:47,699
tea tea.

131
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,259
Let's try that. That's so much better.

132
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,040
I just went into brightness and just turned it up.

133
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,680
OK, I might do that.

134
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,459
I'll do. So, Chad, it's been like,

135
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,180
I guess over a year since I've played this, so it's been updated quite a bit.

136
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,759
There's like a there's like a mental asylum.

137
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,240
Like, Liam, you played this a lot.

138
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,439
Do you know how to, like, go to the asylum?

139
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,009
Yeah. When you select a mission, you'll be able to pick the asylum.

140
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:17,170
As long as it's available, I'm pretty sure it says it's locked.

141
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,649
Oh, damn. I guess we got to play the other missions then.

142
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,250
Would you be able to make a map like a server and like select it?

143
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,899
Or is it just because we're all underleveled?

144
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,220
Yeah, we're all pretty good, like zero.

145
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,740
I probably don't have it whenever I have levels.

146
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,659
I just piggyback off of my friends to get the new levels

147
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,740
because they'd always be like sitting here or something.

148
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,539
Um, well, we could go to the farmhouse.

149
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,379
I don't think we've seen this one.

150
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:46,659
I have no info. I don't know where anybody is.

151
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,299
Oh, wait. Yeah.

152
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,379
Oh, hang on. Let me see if I can find the asylum.

153
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:53,379
I think I can pick it.

154
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,779
Oh, really? What's it called?

155
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,460
Sunny Meadows?

156
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,179
Maybe we don't want to start at the asylum anyway, because we're all rotten at this.

157
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,259
Yeah. So we'll figure that out.

158
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:07,340
Let's try this Bleasdale farmhouse and we'll bust some ghosts.

159
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,419
Yeah. OK. I think, yeah, we can vote for the asylum whenever we're ready.

160
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,679
Oh, OK. So ready up. Ready up.

161
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,759
OK. And what about equipment?

162
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,279
Do we want to bring equipment?

163
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,320
Yeah, we don't have a crucifix candle,

164
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,580
motion sensor, salt, sanity pills.

165
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,620
We're going to need those. I'm going to bring a lighter.

166
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:30,740
OK. Why are you guys all like hunched over?

167
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,870
I don't know. I'm not hunched over.

168
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,909
No, this is just my normal posture.

169
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:42,309
Oh, well, everybody's everybody's leaning forward.

170
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,080
I'm an osteoporobro. Oh, my God.

171
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,049
We got some stuff like the way you guys were standing is the way that I guarantee

172
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:56,330
a side profile candid picture of me sitting on the couch with a remote control.

173
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,169
The TV is that's exactly what it looks like.

174
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:02,419
It's like that. Like, yeah.

175
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:06,419
Yeah, this that that is the exact pose, like the neck forward shoulders rolled.

176
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,879
All right, everyone, I think we're ready to bust some ghosts.

177
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,039
All right. You guys are going to have to hard carry.

178
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,399
I have no idea what the fuck's going on.

179
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,730
And we don't get Ghostbusters equipment like that last game we played.

180
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,929
Oh, no. We only play games together.

181
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:26,850
Jerma and I in particular, if it's ghost busting related.

182
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:29,500
I know it has to be ghost related.

183
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,139
It just started happening this way.

184
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,259
OK. Oh, yeah. We don't have any sanity pills.

185
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:38,779
We might need those. Oh, yeah.

186
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,870
Oh, am I not ready? Vdub left some at my house.

187
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,350
Hang on. Yeah.

188
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,629
Oh, there we go.

189
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:47,190
No, now you're unready school.

190
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,190
Yeah, you double click.

191
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,470
I got confused. All right.

192
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,990
We got some sanity pills now.

193
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,539
OK, we have at least one.

194
00:10:55,539 --> 00:11:01,850
Oh, we're going. Oh, OK.

195
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:10,009
Guys, there's a skeleton in here already.

196
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:14,960
Hey, let me investigate.

197
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,580
Oh, yeah. There's a little bit of meat on the bone if anyone's hungry.

198
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,919
Gross. No, I'm not.

199
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,440
I'm not wearing a Halloween mask.

200
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,159
Stop fucking saying it.

201
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,820
I put it in the title.

202
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:31,460
People keep asking me this.

203
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,139
It's like just getting annoying.

204
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:35,299
Like, dude, why do you have a Halloween mask on?

205
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:39,039
No. Look, whatever.

206
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,080
Trying to. Why am I already at 99 percent sanity?

207
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Ninety eight percent. What?

208
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,919
Oh, I just. Oh, I looked at the skeleton.

209
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,279
Oh, yeah, that must be it.

210
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,840
All right. So we tell the ghost with a smudge stick while it's chasing someone.

211
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,159
Well, I hope we have a smudge stick. Hold on.

212
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,379
Um, it changed a lot of stuff.

213
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:05,220
We've got a lightsaber, a camera.

214
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,720
How do you open the inventory?

215
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,940
Well, there's the book on your your belt.

216
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,899
You can open to see your items.

217
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,899
You got a big hand.

218
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:19,659
How do I pick up a flashlight?

219
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:21,720
Oh, there we go.

220
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,480
So, hey, Liam, do you remember how to do radio communication?

221
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,960
I think it should be your shoulder.

222
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,360
Oh, wait, there's a radio now for an update.

223
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,720
They added a little radio.

224
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,340
And if you hold it, you talk over the comms. Oh.

225
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:41,620
Try to take the camera.

226
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,250
Oh, how do you how do you do that?

227
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,250
On the utility belt, you take out the little walkie talkie

228
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,529
and just hold whatever button it's mapped to.

229
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:52,370
I don't know on keyboard.

230
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,039
V. Is it V?

231
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:08,440
Hello. Hello. How do I open the belt?

232
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,009
Utility belt to the belt is trying some buttons right now.

233
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,259
Oh, OK. If we're going to do this, we need smudge sticks.

234
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:25,259
And I don't think we have any.

235
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,740
So we're just going to have to try and identify the ghost

236
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,539
based on what we can see.

237
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:32,179
OK. And then head on out.

238
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,620
Yeah. All right. All right. All right.

239
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,899
OK. Well, it's not being a pressure.

240
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,179
OK. OK.

241
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:55,799
Like, if I just use the flashlight, wouldn't it?

242
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:00,200
Hold B. I'm holding B. It's not doing it.

243
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,799
OK. How do I access the belt?

244
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,639
Did we bring did we bring an EMF detector?

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,509
That's Spirit Box.

246
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:10,350
Oh, boy.

247
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,379
We did bring a camera. That's good.

248
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,100
So we can set that up somewhere and look for ghost orbs

249
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,460
where the thing may be.

250
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,100
But if we don't have an EMF, that might be tricky.

251
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,370
I got the camera right here.

252
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,490
You take pictures and the ghost shows up by the thing you scream, right?

253
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,799
Yeah. OK.

254
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:49,690
I'll burn her up.

255
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:02,970
It's really windy.

256
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:03,970
It's Vinnie.

257
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,580
It sounds like you're like in a call with me, like on my desk speaker.

258
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,730
Like, oh, man, we couldn't get Discord to work.

259
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,570
It's all right, Vinnie.

260
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,289
You can come through like on my on my my iPhone or the speaker.

261
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:26,669
Oh, piano. Let's play it. OK.

262
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:28,710
Jesus, what the fuck?

263
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,350
That was you did that, right?

264
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,620
Wait, was a ghost doing that? OK.

265
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:41,169
Well, you guys got to play something.

266
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:42,169
Oh, wow.

267
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:49,460
Oh, that's sad. I wish I could do that.

268
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,980
Wait, can I?

269
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:58,350
Wait, we just tap it when we're down.

270
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,860
Oh, oh, gosh, you have to deal with whatever song the game gives you.

271
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,129
Boy, I left the camera here.

272
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:13,049
All right. Who's going to work?

273
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:16,659
Who's coming upstairs with me?

274
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:19,299
Where we off to? Where we going?

275
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:20,220
We can hit the attic.

276
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,379
See if there's a check the attic.

277
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:25,700
Any spooky phenomenon?

278
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,649
We are doing this so wrong, man.

279
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:31,750
Like I should be all the way back.

280
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,070
I should be like key light.

281
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,399
You should be focused light. You know what I mean?

282
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:43,730
I don't like this.

283
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,340
Oh, I just love. OK, you are.

284
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,659
OK, I found a brush.

285
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,159
Does that matter?

286
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,360
I don't I don't think so.

287
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,919
We do have like a book we could put down.

288
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,759
Oh, I could take a picture.

289
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,519
Right. I do have a book.

290
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,960
We should put it right here. OK.

291
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,839
Yeah. Put it there and see if the demon like writes in it.

292
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,640
OK. Then we can point a camera at it.

293
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,920
Do we need to open it?

294
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,380
I don't know. I got a camera here. Oops.

295
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:21,299
Oh, I really have no idea.

296
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,799
We're just like, I'm just making this up as I go along.

297
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,470
All right. Hold on. Take it.

298
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,430
OK. Beautiful.

299
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,430
How many photos can you take?

300
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,150
Get my good side.

301
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,029
No, you didn't.

302
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,990
How do I press? Oh, OK.

303
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,390
There we go. OK. I put the put it down.

304
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,829
It's open on the on the table.

305
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,829
All right. Now we've got to wait for it to.

306
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,750
Maybe it'll write on it, I guess.

307
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,670
We can come check on it later and just go downstairs.

308
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,650
Yeah, that works.

309
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,440
Doesn't this game listen to your microphone, too?

310
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,480
Yeah. If you like, learn its name and say, suck my balls, suck my balls.

311
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,180
Oh, OK. Oh, hey, what's up, man?

312
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,579
Hey, did you know?

313
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:11,869
Wait, you have a camcorder?

314
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:17,130
Yeah. The lens cap is on.

315
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:31,369
All right. So I was that somebody was a shadow.

316
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:42,779
I don't know. OK.

317
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:43,859
Something just flew. Something just flew by.

318
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:45,289
Something just flew by me.

319
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:48,569
Well, I saw something like a book just flew from right to left.

320
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:52,259
I swear. Oh, well, you think it was the book you left upstairs?

321
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:54,660
I don't know.

322
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:02,759
Lame. Oh, I'm getting chills.

323
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:05,359
Wait, where is he? Is he is he is he at like 7-Eleven?

324
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,759
Hey, can you stop?

325
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,559
Can you grab me some flaming hot Cheetos, dude?

326
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,460
Like on your way back?

327
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,119
You gave me flaming hot.

328
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,299
I want the powdered doughnuts.

329
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,579
Get the new lime ones, though.

330
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:26,690
Those things are fucking sick.

331
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,569
They actually are actually sick.

332
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,569
The new lime flaming hot Cheetos are awesome.

333
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,059
All right. Let's check the book.

334
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:43,440
Where's the book over here?

335
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,829
Not that I can tell.

336
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:47,789
It would be pretty obvious.

337
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,509
It draws like pentagrams and shit.

338
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:51,819
Maybe not up here, then.

339
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:54,339
Huh? Going to bring it with you?

340
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,900
Oh, yeah. Maybe we'll put it somewhere else.

341
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,539
Maybe because it would have probably done it by now, right?

342
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:04,589
I imagine you maybe put it down.

343
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:09,359
Hey, what's up?

344
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,079
All right. I'm putting it over here.

345
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,279
Yeah, maybe.

346
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,200
What's the scariest place in this whole house?

347
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,140
I would have said the attic, but I guess, yeah, we could do downstairs.

348
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:27,119
Piano's pretty scary.

349
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,759
OK, yeah, my light just like somebody's singing.

350
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,200
OK, yeah, I don't like this at all.

351
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,720
OK, they're coming from that room in there on the left.

352
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,619
I heard that door.

353
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:40,859
I got a frag grenade going out.

354
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:43,819
I guess somebody's right here.

355
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:45,579
Yeah, there's a ghost.

356
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,779
What? Excuse me?

357
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,940
They're strangling Vinny.

358
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,339
What? What just happened?

359
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,140
I killed Vinny.

360
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,619
OK, we're probably going to die next.

361
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:57,980
What do you think?

362
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,460
Um, I'm going to put the book down on the ground

363
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,109
and then we're going to see almost like a landmine.

364
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,339
Yeah, it'll get distracted and draw pictures.

365
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:09,339
It'll draw a picture to be like, oh, I have to do this.

366
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,380
I'm a fucking ghost. I have to draw a pentagram.

367
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:23,660
Right. That's what's going to happen.

368
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,259
So what even was that?

369
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:27,500
Yeah, I don't actually know how to open doors and decks.

370
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,059
Desktop. Do you know how to do that?

371
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,900
This is the second time I've ever played this game.

372
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,980
So no, I don't either.

373
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,900
So we're trapped in here.

374
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,180
All right. So we need to figure out how to open a door,

375
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:39,859
which is probably E, which is probably click.

376
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:42,500
It's click. Oh, it's left click.

377
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,890
Oh, this toilet's nasty, dude.

378
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:54,119
Let me see. Oh, are we the only two people left?

379
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:57,299
I think so. Oh, wait.

380
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,839
We are. When did, um, who?

381
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,720
Yeah. When? When did that happen?

382
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,759
This ghost is aggressive.

383
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,720
Should we just leave and just go?

384
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,920
Yeah, I know. Close that door.

385
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,400
You scared you. Oh, God.

386
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,559
You scared me just then because you walked through me.

387
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,079
I saw your teeth.

388
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:17,160
It's already singing right now.

389
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,700
Oh, for fuck, dude.

390
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,859
I feel like we're playing Left 4 Dead.

391
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:22,420
And like this is the oh, the good idea.

392
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,660
Let's go in the bathroom and aim our shotguns out the door.

393
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,740
It never works. It always feels like it should, though.

394
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:32,049
I'm not scared, by the way, just so you know.

395
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:36,150
I'm going to hide it. OK, I'm going to crouch.

396
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,400
I'm going to also crouch.

397
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
I think it's out there.

398
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,299
Do we want to go try to get back to the trailer and see if we can guess?

399
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,700
I think well, we know it's the singing one.

400
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,789
What does that matter?

401
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:54,109
That's all the like the information I made.

402
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,869
Are we locked in here?

403
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:58,789
I do. We actually did that.

404
00:22:58,789 --> 00:22:59,630
You're joking.

405
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,230
Can we actually knock it out of here?

406
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,319
I'll try the window.

407
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,089
The window doesn't work.

408
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:13,039
What did you do with that?

409
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,200
No, I just tried to open it.

410
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,140
Wait, you let the ghost in, didn't you?

411
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:19,900
I might have. I don't know.

412
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,970
It's possible.

413
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,609
I'm sweating. I'm sweating.

414
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:28,140
I mean, no, I'm not. I'm brave. Let's go.

415
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,740
Let's just leave. This place is bad.

416
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,420
Oh, wait, hold on. Actually, let's check the book.

417
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,710
Wait, the book actually might have something in it.

418
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,869
No, it's got nothing. Oh, come on. Really?

419
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,160
Yeah. Oh, well.

420
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,720
OK, let's try to guess.

421
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,650
This is a warm up around anyways.

422
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,980
It's the the the the singing

423
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,700
singing specter.

424
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,180
OK, yeah, they're down here.

425
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,690
They can't get up there.

426
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,089
Yeah, you're in.

427
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,890
Um, I think they're I don't know.

428
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,930
It got me. It got me.

429
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,180
It got you. It did.

430
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,190
Give me stuff.

431
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:23,960
Do you have any items?

432
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:35,299
Hey, this is why is this locked?

433
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:37,099
I'm getting the fuck out of this house.

434
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:39,460
I'm the one that got to stay alive.

435
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:47,230
And by the way, you're the singing specter with the car.

436
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,920
All right. It's the singing.

437
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,329
All right.

438
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:03,819
She's choking people.

439
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:07,700
All right. I think I got it.

440
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,500
How do I how do I guess?

441
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:20,279
How do I how do I guess?

442
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,599
It's open your journal. OK.

443
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:26,140
Um, ghosts, it's the.

444
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,910
Oh, my God, there's so many.

445
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:34,720
What's the one that sings?

446
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,430
They're probably just like, dude, just just just fucking just get out of the game.

447
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,259
Go to evidence.

448
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:42,769
OK, all right, right, right.

449
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:50,299
The ghost, I believe, is a we heard singing.

450
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,670
It was very cold.

451
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,980
There was a music.

452
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,180
I think it was a bay.

453
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:08,589
No, I'm going to say it's just a gym.

454
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,380
I'm going to say demon and that's it.

455
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:15,819
Right. A demon.

456
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:17,940
I don't know, guys, I don't know how any of this works.

457
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,500
I'm going to say demon and and just call it.

458
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:33,609
How do I how do I say yes?

459
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:36,279
Go to the truck door. OK.

460
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:52,519
We do it.

461
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:53,980
Oh, did we win?

462
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,180
It was a revenant.

463
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,579
It was what you what you guess.

464
00:26:57,579 --> 00:26:59,980
I guess demon.

465
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,779
OK, German, can you hear me? Revenant.

466
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:05,960
Yeah. German, apparently you couldn't hear me in game because my

467
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,619
like you had me too low.

468
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:11,339
I did. I was talking, but people were saying I wasn't audible.

469
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,140
But they're OK.

470
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,940
You were coming through the walkie talkie for a little while.

471
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,279
I think it was a glitch.

472
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,690
I don't know. I can hear you now.

473
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,210
We're yeah, I think it's a glitch now.

474
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,529
Also, Liam got booted before we started.

475
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:28,210
So the one dude knew how to play the game was booted.

476
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:30,089
That's so funny.

477
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:32,460
We were trying to figure out my book.

478
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,220
Oh, by the way, I'm back now. Finally.

479
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,259
I. OK, I opened my book.

480
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,619
I was looking at the evidence and my game just kicked me to the main menu

481
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:41,160
for no reason.

482
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,599
I guess it was a connection, according to Vinnie's chat.

483
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,799
But I have been cool.

484
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,240
I'm surprised at least one of us made it out of there.

485
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,789
I don't know how.

486
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,740
I'm going to add all like as much equipment as I can get.

487
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,819
OK, so we have we're just going to all walk behind you saved up.

488
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,880
Yeah, I'm trying to navigate this new menu, though.

489
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,720
I'm not used to it.

490
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,759
I'm telling you, we should just there should be three people with flashlights

491
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,480
in a triangle pattern, all pointing in the direction that he is facing.

492
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,460
Yeah, we should.

493
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,579
We should just be your studio lighting for you to go around and find stuff.

494
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,940
OK, candle by that.

495
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,990
Let me just get set up real quick.

496
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,750
I do the same level.

497
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,339
Yeah, I'm going to add a lighter.

498
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,819
Just going to just keep adding lighters.

499
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,500
OK, we got two.

500
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,380
So we're good.

501
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,319
Motion sensor, hairball, microphone.

502
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,000
What's all this stuff?

503
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,539
I get some there's some jiggling happening.

504
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,740
That's the stuff we're buying right now.

505
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,170
Somebody said gamer neck.

506
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,970
Hmm. So Vinnie, how are you using the walkie talkie?

507
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,970
What is it?

508
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,690
Are you holding what you did?

509
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,970
You have to physically pick up the walkie talkie to talk into it.

510
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,549
Yeah. Oh, like this.

511
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:03,349
And then I have to do this because I would do.

512
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:06,630
Do we how do we have those as non VR?

513
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,109
Yeah, yeah, we do.

514
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:12,829
I think you hit Q or maybe we have to hit B or V because I was hitting B or V

515
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:15,710
and it was making like a noise, you know, noise maybe.

516
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,589
So it's just we have to.

517
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,069
Oh, I thought that holding B was voice chat.

518
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:23,920
But OK, I get it.

519
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,619
I get it. Green on one side, red on the other.

520
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:32,619
That's like you got to do RGB lighting if you if you're like an epic

521
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:35,180
Call of Duty gamer on YouTube.

522
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,259
OK, there we go.

523
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:38,420
OK, so now you're lit properly.

524
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,619
Speaking of light, do we need any more lighters?

525
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,779
I'm getting as much equipment as I possibly can.

526
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:46,019
We're if we're using smudge sticks, we're probably going to need

527
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:48,279
at least one per person.

528
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,960
OK. OK. Yeah.

529
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,079
I VDub left a couple smudge sticks here last night, so I'm I'm down for that.

530
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,480
Wait, candle.

531
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:01,670
How much money do I have?

532
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,829
Um, you can see it over here on this monitor.

533
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:06,630
You can see it in the top right.

534
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,589
How much money you have?

535
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:08,630
Oh, I got 25 bucks.

536
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,269
Do I get a lighter?

537
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,269
I'll get a

538
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,210
can of whipped cream.

539
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,490
Yeah, there's is that whipped cream?

540
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,609
Is that whip? It's I don't know.

541
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,769
I don't have it's ghost assault.

542
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:22,809
Hey, it's OK.

543
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:25,450
Guys, I brought two lighters motion sensor.

544
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,289
OK, there we go.

545
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:33,769
We are now all around to to to detect when ghosts like are near us.

546
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:35,130
You have one of those.

547
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,170
Yeah, math. Yeah, we've added one.

548
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,940
OK, that's good.

549
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,460
We add another.

550
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,500
I think with what we have, we'll be all right.

551
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,140
We've got everything.

552
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,619
I'm voting for 10 Ridgeview Court, so sure.

553
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,990
We're writing up.

554
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:01,180
Sure. Sick.

555
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,660
All right. Hopefully I don't disconnect this time.

556
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,339
We definitely need we definitely need you.

557
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:06,500
We need your expertise.

558
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:13,220
Amen has money.

559
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,339
We're all here.

560
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,009
We're all here.

561
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:17,890
Perfect.

562
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,769
Oh, I really, really hope I don't get disconnected this time.

563
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:24,339
And if I do, good luck.

564
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:26,980
Is this wacky device?

565
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,579
Well, I think that's all the whipped cream sound.

566
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:34,170
Yeah, I think it's a parabolic microphone.

567
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:40,730
Ah, hey, hey, guys.

568
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,559
Oh, I love whipped cream.

569
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,799
That joke was awful.

570
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,559
That was not even funny.

571
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:55,579
I don't have it today.

572
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:58,099
If I ever had it, I certainly don't have it today either.

573
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,619
I just I just we have to understand something.

574
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:03,220
I just did the look at I'm turning the thing upside down

575
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,420
and eating it at like three o'clock in the morning out of the fridge.

576
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:07,549
That was the humor there.

577
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:09,869
Oh, OK, that's cool.

578
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,710
OK, so we should probably spread our equipment

579
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,190
thin here based on what we have.

580
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:18,230
Like, no, we shouldn't have like four EMFs like divided between us.

581
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,710
We only need like three.

582
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,930
We need to get the ghost to blow out a candle,

583
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,930
prevent the ghost from hunting with a crucifix

584
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,849
and clear the area near the ghost using smudge sticks.

585
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:30,930
So I'll bring the crucifix of just a crease through.

586
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,170
I just played faith.

587
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,769
So I know how to do this.

588
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:35,740
You just hold it up, is that?

589
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,049
Yeah, basically, if it's hacking, you just like do this.

590
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:40,609
Yeah. The power of Christ compelled.

591
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:44,230
OK, exactly. I think so.

592
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,029
It is actually prayer.

593
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:48,750
I mean, like I've never it's it's 50 50.

594
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:51,460
OK, so we don't have to actually recite the Lord.

595
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,900
Like when I went to school, they taught me our father.

596
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:57,450
Should I say that if that makes you more comfortable?

597
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:01,390
I think you should do it. All right.

598
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,150
All right. I'll set up a camera and tripod.

599
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,210
Yeah. Yeah, we should.

600
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,950
We actually should just take a bring a candle.

601
00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:11,710
Oh, I need a lighter. Yeah.

602
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,950
How much can we bring in this new utility belt?

603
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,789
Like the area looks like three items, right?

604
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,920
Yeah, I've got pretty sure three.

605
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:25,019
Yeah, I have my flashlight and some think flashlights

606
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,420
probably really important.

607
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,500
Oh, you're going to need that.

608
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,640
You can do three.

609
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,000
I think it's three items.

610
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,559
You could. Yeah, on keyboard.

611
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:36,440
You're you don't have the hands, so they have to accommodate.

612
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,079
Oh, your mouse wheel to go between them.

613
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:43,420
OK. Oh, my God.

614
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,660
Is this going to be OK?

615
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:48,980
Why am I taking a lighter when I could take a flashlight?

616
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,259
That seems like you can probably.

617
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:54,299
The lighter is probably going to just be for the concert.

618
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,099
I'm definitely taking a flashlight these days.

619
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:03,450
So who you have crucifix who brought is anybody have smudge stick?

620
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,250
I have a I have a smudge stick.

621
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,329
German, if you have the lighter, definitely bring a smudge stick.

622
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:10,170
Oh, yeah, 100 percent. You're good.

623
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,369
OK. All right. So I should drop the lighter then and get something else.

624
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,849
I'll bring maybe bring bring the book or the blacklight.

625
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:22,329
So that way we can see if there's any like nocturnal emissions in the bedroom.

626
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:24,329
You guys you guys have EMFs, right?

627
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,690
Do I need this?

628
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,929
Uh, some ghostly goo.

629
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,969
I have flashlight, lighter and smudge stick.

630
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,820
Yeah. Did any I don't think anybody else has an EMF.

631
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,179
So take that. OK.

632
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,239
I'll take a spirit box.

633
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,730
And OK, my hands are full, but I mean,

634
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:45,820
you're walking in with like you can just juggle as you go.

635
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,380
Yeah, I think that's what I'm going to do.

636
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,420
You are right now the infomercial where it's trying to show you a product

637
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,860
that includes everything that's on your belt and holding it.

638
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,820
And you're like dropping shit in black and white. Yeah.

639
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,510
Like, why would you carry all this stuff?

640
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:05,110
Is this you can set that up here?

641
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,409
No, no, no. I just need to turn my flashlight.

642
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:09,130
We need to once we find the room, it's in.

643
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,050
Then we set it up.

644
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,369
Where is it snowing from?

645
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:12,809
Is this ghost snow?

646
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:15,010
Because it's like clear night and snow.

647
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:16,409
Maybe it's like ash.

648
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:19,250
The earth's like Silent Hill. Yeah. Yeah.

649
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,369
Like it's just coal fires burning under the town for 50 years.

650
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:26,019
That's that's earth door right now.

651
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:27,340
Shit, my flashlight.

652
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,420
That's not the moon. That's fucking earth.

653
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,119
Wait, wait, wait, what?

654
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,360
That looks like earth, man.

655
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,159
That doesn't look like the moon.

656
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,820
This shit's blue.

657
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,340
How did you bend that way?

658
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,820
Like broke your spine.

659
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,139
Oh, my goodness.

660
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:46,300
Permanent. Permanent.

661
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,619
OK, not having a flashlight kind of sucks.

662
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:49,980
Permanent spine damage.

663
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,440
All right.

664
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,519
All right. I hear something already.

665
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:54,760
That's the spirit box germ.

666
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,320
It's OK. OK, good.

667
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:02,320
OK, I've got the the camera set up over here

668
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,960
and I got the cross in case any demons wish to attempt.

669
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,360
All right. Should I light the smudge stick damage?

670
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,920
No, no, not yet.

671
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,679
We need to know where it is first.

672
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,360
OK, it's not in this room.

673
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm not getting anything.

674
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,960
Give us a sign. I'll be right back.

675
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,519
I'm going to go get some more equipment.

676
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,519
Why would we be why are we doing this?

677
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,079
What is your name? Give us a sign.

678
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,679
Uh, let me go over here.

679
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:26,480
Well, I should probably now.

680
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,519
I'm not going to break up.

681
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,900
I'm going to stick here.

682
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,579
Where's Vinnie going?

683
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:35,900
Uh, probably to get get an item.

684
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,739
Vinnie, where are you at?

685
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:41,590
OK. Vinnie, you good?

686
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,909
No, I'm fine. I'm just grabbing some Crystal Head vodka.

687
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:55,360
Oh, we thought you were dead.

688
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,239
Oh, oh, OK, cool, cool, cool.

689
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,239
30 seconds before a ghost appears.

690
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,119
That's what it says here on the time.

691
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,519
Oh, let's we should put something down then.

692
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,260
Yeah, I've got the book.

693
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,659
Do you want to put down the book?

694
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,739
Yeah. Where should we put the book?

695
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:12,579
In any any particular location you like?

696
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:17,659
Hello?

697
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:27,969
OK, I'm coming.

698
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:29,690
You're stuck at a wall.

699
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,090
Oh, the way you said that, you were like,

700
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,969
it sounded like you were trapped in the wall

701
00:37:33,969 --> 00:37:39,750
and you didn't know how you got there.

702
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,670
Give me a sign.

703
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,429
We need to put the book down somewhere,

704
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:44,750
somewhere that's scary enough.

705
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,110
Yeah, I do.

706
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,059
It says it's blue, it's blue.

707
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,099
So there's nothing?

708
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,739
OK, there's nothing, there's nothing.

709
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:55,679
All right, let's my hands are full.

710
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,599
You're going to have to open the door.

711
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,920
What did I saw a thing here?

712
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,860
What? 5.9, 6.2, 6.2.

713
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,699
It's all good here.

714
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:08,300
What's the clock say?

715
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,559
I'm holding the thing that except sound that I'm getting decibels.

716
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,599
I don't know what's happening.

717
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,440
It's midnight.

718
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,360
I don't I don't know what that means, but I'll follow you.

719
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,440
Oh, that's actually really good.

720
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:26,760
This one, uh, give us a sign.

721
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,880
Give us a sign.

722
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,119
You're the piano man.

723
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,719
Give us a sign.

724
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:33,800
It's probably where you were, Vinny, if you're getting a reading there.

725
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,280
It's probably in that hallway.

726
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,840
We can do can you speak?

727
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,480
And let's let's make sure that it's not just you speaking.

728
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,079
OK. Hello.

729
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,079
I'm a ghost hunter.

730
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,239
Hello.

731
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,360
Creepy ghosts.

732
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,760
You got a five dB voice, apparently.

733
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,869
Oh, I'm quiet.

734
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:52,949
My friends tell me otherwise.

735
00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:57,070
It's so funny because honest to God, all four of us don't need to be here doing this.

736
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,309
Like, like two of us could do this, right?

737
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:01,829
Right. We could split up into like scuba groups.

738
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:04,150
You know, like, yeah, yeah.

739
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,190
We're just blocking the hallway for each other.

740
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,469
That's so funny.

741
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:09,110
There's I don't think there's anything here.

742
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,869
Never mind. Like, let's let's be honest.

743
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:11,989
What am I doing?

744
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:14,190
What is my job right now?

745
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,070
You're holding the flashlight.

746
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,469
Yeah, you are Ross's lifeline right now.

747
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:20,829
Yeah. Without you, I can't see.

748
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:25,809
That says nothing in there.

749
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:27,329
Well, I think it's probably downstairs.

750
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:28,610
Oh, we didn't check this room yet.

751
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,090
It's got to be downstairs.

752
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,369
I can't open it because I have a ghost.

753
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,690
Fellas, don't worry.

754
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,690
I can get the door.

755
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,369
Thanks, Jerma.

756
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:38,570
Thanks, Jerma.

757
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,170
Are we in the bathroom, ghost?

758
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,570
Are we in the bathroom?

759
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,329
No, it's still blue.

760
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:44,329
Still blue.

761
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:45,730
74 dB.

762
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,530
Yeah, the EMF is still reading absolutely nothing.

763
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,170
How?

764
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,570
I guess it's downstairs.

765
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,210
I guess it's downstairs. Yeah.

766
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,289
I mean, there is a isn't this house have a basement or?

767
00:39:57,289 --> 00:39:59,050
It might actually.

768
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,929
Yeah. I might think of the first one.

769
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:02,409
What is that? What is that?

770
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:04,809
What happened?

771
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:05,650
You're good.

772
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,500
Something happened.

773
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,599
No, no, I.

774
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,400
I.

775
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,239
Nothing.

776
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,599
Spider land on you.

777
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,920
It was itchy. I thought it was a fucking centipede.

778
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,920
Spider.

779
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,039
Centipede.

780
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,760
I'm all right.

781
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,719
Once we know where it is, we can use the salt.

782
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,760
Imagine being in VR and having a centipede climb on your neck.

783
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,880
You just click when it's active, but don't use it just yet.

784
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,519
And I was like, you know, I was going like this behind the pillow.

785
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,800
And then I was like, what is that? This feels fuzzy.

786
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,119
And it was a house centipede on my hand.

787
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,079
Oh, my God.

788
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:40,599
It was the worst and it was huge.

789
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:42,679
It was the size of like three quarters.

790
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:46,400
Is it weird that I would rather have Jason fucking chase me through a house

791
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,800
than have that experience where you just had.

792
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,760
What would you rather?

793
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,360
I would rather be chased in a house with Jason behind me

794
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,380
than have a centipede around my neck in bed.

795
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,420
You see how disgusting how centipedes are.

796
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,260
They're like the worst.

797
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,619
There's a pentagram in here.

798
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:02,139
So I think we're close.

799
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:03,340
No, it's normal.

800
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,380
Is it normal?

801
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,780
Yeah, I don't. I don't think I recognize that from the last update.

802
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,940
No, on Zillow, they showed the pentagram.

803
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,219
It was fine. Oh, I see.

804
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:14,900
OK. Oh, wait a minute.

805
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,619
Oh, your ghost. Hello.

806
00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:19,179
How old are you?

807
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:20,219
What is your name?

808
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:21,820
What is your name, ghost?

809
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,980
What is your name, ghost?

810
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,139
And I'm just waiting for the

811
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:26,619
Oh, did you close that door?

812
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,219
What the fuck was that?

813
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,739
Sound like a door opening.

814
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,139
Something.

815
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,420
Guys, shh, shh, smoke stick activated coming out.

816
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,860
Fifteen, twenty DB.

817
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,190
Smoke stick activated.

818
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,389
Fifty two DB.

819
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:42,949
Where's the cross?

820
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:46,469
In the name of the Lord, Savior, Christ.

821
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:47,469
I can fuck.

822
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:51,360
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

823
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,119
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

824
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,320
As it is in heaven.

825
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,119
Give us this hallowed.

826
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,440
Is a ghost laughing or somebody else laughing?

827
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,400
And I'm sorry, I'm just I'm laughing.

828
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,760
Oh, that was a ghost laugh.

829
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:07,050
That was me all along.

830
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:10,090
You were like just close enough to my left ear where it was like

831
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,440
you were inside of my left ear.

832
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,039
I'm so sorry.

833
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:17,079
Oh, OK.

834
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,760
Um, it's not down here.

835
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,360
It's upstairs. Yeah, it went back up.

836
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,440
Yeah, I don't like this one.

837
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,019
Here is our home.

838
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:30,550
Oh, what?

839
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,829
Do I sprint in there? No, no, no.

840
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:36,739
You will. You might die if you do that.

841
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:39,019
Oh, this one's like scurrying around.

842
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:40,219
I'm going back.

843
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:44,989
Oh, you're done.

844
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,079
Well, I guess the crucifix didn't work.

845
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,519
German, where are you?

846
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,159
Oh, shit. I have to go find you. Where are you?

847
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:55,320
Are you down in the basement?

848
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,840
Well, that's a great question.

849
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,760
I got you. I got you.

850
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,480
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?

851
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,880
Guys. Holy shit, dude.

852
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,360
Um, it yanked my flashlight out of my hand.

853
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,079
What? Did it get Vinny?

854
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:06,440
It got Vinny. He's dead, I think.

855
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,039
Oh, look, there's his head.

856
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:11,000
I saw him on the floor.

857
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I was like, we should probably go back to the house.

858
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,280
The spirit box is useless.

859
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,280
How do you open it? Oh, no, the door just closed.

860
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,400
Oh, thank God.

861
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,719
Did you get level five in the EMF or did you just freak out?

862
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:23,880
I did. I just panicked and ran.

863
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,980
I couldn't I couldn't see anything.

864
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,460
I do two flashlights.

865
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,539
We can we can regroup here.

866
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:30,969
Talk about it.

867
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:33,900
Try to pick that. No, that thing's useless, you said.

868
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,670
OK. Oh, what did he drop it?

869
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,670
So we should I should not pick this thing up.

870
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,159
Grab a flashlight.

871
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:44,489
I got it. OK.

872
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:47,869
All right. So what do we know so far?

873
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:50,030
Did your EMF reach level five at all?

874
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:53,300
No, it didn't.

875
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,639
At least if it did, I didn't see it.

876
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:59,159
OK, let me see if the crucifix even helped at all.

877
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,179
No, no, he died.

878
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:05,619
OK, well, we all have really terrible sanity.

879
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:07,940
Let's work on that real quick.

880
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,619
Do we take pills or?

881
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:10,900
Yeah. How many do we have?

882
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,820
Oh, my God, it's bad.

883
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,869
Bill's here. Bill's here.

884
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:15,670
So we just wait. Shit.

885
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,750
I dropped I dropped the shit.

886
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,780
There we go. And it's just I just.

887
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,860
Yeah. Right.

888
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,219
Click. Did I do it?

889
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:25,019
I heard the sound. It probably worked.

890
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:26,670
Yeah. Yeah, it worked.

891
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,909
My hands are sweaty, so I'm dropping shit.

892
00:44:28,909 --> 00:44:29,909
I was so loud.

893
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:33,260
All right. So we should take more than we take two pills.

894
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:37,579
Let's hang on just in case.

895
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:39,820
Yeah. We should ration them out.

896
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,179
Yeah, Vinny didn't get to eat it.

897
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,780
OK, I dropped the pill bottle.

898
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,219
It's on the ground right here.

899
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:46,019
I'm going to pick it up. I wish I put it.

900
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,789
How do I put something down here?

901
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:49,909
Give it to me. Oh, you got it. OK.

902
00:44:49,909 --> 00:44:51,510
So what should I take instead?

903
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,750
Because I got a flashlight. That's it.

904
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,829
Did you use the smudge stick yet?

905
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:56,869
Yeah, I kind of panicked.

906
00:44:56,869 --> 00:44:58,230
And just when we were down in the basement,

907
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,409
I clicked it and it made like a smoke thing.

908
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:01,489
It didn't work.

909
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:04,289
So we can you can use another one just in case it attacks again.

910
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:07,070
OK, I need the candle.

911
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,309
I have no clue what it is.

912
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:10,309
You did not get level five, correct?

913
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:11,630
I'm sorry. I didn't see.

914
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,429
I know I didn't see level five.

915
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:15,429
I just saw the level blue.

916
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:18,670
OK, we can rule those out then.

917
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:19,989
Let's check the journal.

918
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,789
Let's try and place it where the ghost might be.

919
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:23,230
He died in the hallway, right?

920
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,710
Oh, yeah, the door to the basement.

921
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:30,789
So. OK.

922
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:32,909
Yeah, we get a video camera set up yet.

923
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:35,550
Yeah, this one right here in the in the that

924
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:40,099
we're currently recording the office.

925
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:43,869
We should probably move that to where Vinny died.

926
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:47,469
OK, and then I'll place the journal and I have a journal.

927
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:49,690
Do you want to just place the camera?

928
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:52,289
Yeah, OK. Plus, you got VR.

929
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:57,900
You probably better than us.

930
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:06,380
OK, hit cameras right here.

931
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:20,280
Cameras right here.

932
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,289
But it was one of you guys lagging.

933
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:23,369
Wait, no, they're right here.

934
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:23,969
There's a ghost right here.

935
00:46:23,969 --> 00:46:26,559
There's a ghost. I thought there's a ghost right here.

936
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,989
They're holding a cup.

937
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,300
Yeah, could this be?

938
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,019
I need everyone.

939
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:33,500
No one's going to believe me if that if I don't see this,

940
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,699
I'm going to look like a fucking weirdo.

941
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:40,360
I swear to God, this cup was moving.

942
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,260
Oh, he's fucking on this.

943
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,980
Yeah, you can do that when you're a ghost.

944
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,940
It's great. I love it.

945
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:54,369
I thought one of you were lagging for a second.

946
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:58,380
Which Vinny's communicating with us.

947
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:12,900
Liam, is your camera on right now?

948
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,380
Do you want it? Oh, I see a flashlight.

949
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,219
Oh, OK, OK. Yeah, I got it right here.

950
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:16,860
It's me right here.

951
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:20,219
OK, you got it. Oh, you found it.

952
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:21,739
Ross, do you see this floating mug?

953
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:23,989
Oh, where do you want to move to?

954
00:47:23,989 --> 00:47:31,070
Something's behind it.

955
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,630
Something's loaded behind me right now.

956
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:33,949
Go somewhere and hide and be quiet.

957
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:35,429
Hold on. What?

958
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:37,630
Help. Help me.

959
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,949
Oh, smoke sticks.

960
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:41,190
Smoke stick.

961
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:42,710
I didn't get it.

962
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:43,710
Did it work?

963
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:44,710
God.

964
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,360
Smoke sticks.

965
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,360
Hi.

966
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,929
We want to get back here.

967
00:47:55,929 --> 00:47:58,610
How you doing? Hey.

968
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:05,730
Oh, whoa, a ball.

969
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,170
So that was you that was moving the stuff around.

970
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,170
That's funny.

971
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,769
I was moving the coffee mug.

972
00:48:10,769 --> 00:48:13,769
Yeah, I was moving it.

973
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:16,590
Are you on... Am I muffled when you hear me speak?

974
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,670
Yeah, you are talking through...

975
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,900
You're a very thin wall.

976
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,820
Yeah, exactly. OK.

977
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,460
Yeah, when you're ghost, you just get muffled.

978
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,780
Oh, that's OK.

979
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,820
Well, I can still kind of hear you.

980
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:36,820
Apparently, we have to go outside to fix that, so...

981
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,340
Roommate voice.

982
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:42,610
Yeah, that's how I lean over to the wall here and go...

983
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:46,269
Hey, man, you want anything from McDonald's?

984
00:48:46,269 --> 00:48:48,949
Hey, can you lower your music?

985
00:48:48,949 --> 00:48:50,590
Holy shit.

986
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:54,199
You just opened up the room to my apartment and did that.

987
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:54,960
Oh.

988
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,349
You're not muffled anymore.

989
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:04,869
You just stormed over and opened the door.

990
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:12,619
Please, I need you to lower the music.

991
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:14,769
So, where are they now?

992
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:18,489
Uh, I don't know, actually.

993
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:21,000
Maybe the basement?

994
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,099
Dude, let's mess with them.

995
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:27,260
All right, I'm going to grab...

996
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,739
Can we grab knives?

997
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:30,590
Let me see.

998
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:34,219
I can grab a fork.

999
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:36,730
Oh, OK, I got a plate.

1000
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:37,530
All right.

1001
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,289
Then we just need to find them.

1002
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:42,420
Can I throw this and hit them with a plate?

1003
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,780
I don't know if it'll hit.

1004
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,900
I don't know if it'll be like a...

1005
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,500
I wonder if it'll break.

1006
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:54,099
Let's see if they're down here.

1007
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:55,849
They're not down here.

1008
00:49:55,849 --> 00:49:59,519
Do you see this?

1009
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,659
Do you see the lighter just bouncing?

1010
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:04,989
No.

1011
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:06,429
OK, I'm not making this up.

1012
00:50:06,429 --> 00:50:11,190
Like, there's a lighter that is just infinitely bouncing on my screen right now.

1013
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,510
Somebody else is fucking with us.

1014
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,389
Somebody died in the ghost world and now they're able to mess with the ghosts.

1015
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:16,659
I see.

1016
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:18,219
Yeah.

1017
00:50:18,219 --> 00:50:20,010
Oh, I think they've lost.

1018
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:24,940
OK.

1019
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:29,510
I imagine you guys lost.

1020
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:30,429
All right.

1021
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:32,190
It was a thay.

1022
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:33,110
Of course.

1023
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,349
How could I get that wrong?

1024
00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:35,550
How did I think of that?

1025
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,789
I got 80 bucks for that.

1026
00:50:37,789 --> 00:50:38,949
Oh, good.

1027
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:43,980
Last thing I saw was a lighter covered in repulsion gel.

1028
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,940
What?

1029
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,139
It was weird.

1030
00:50:46,139 --> 00:50:51,260
Yeah, someone, I'm sure, clipped it, but it was very strange.

1031
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,969
So this game is scary.

1032
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:55,130
That was good.

1033
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:57,420
Oh, can I buy anything?

1034
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:57,739
No.

1035
00:50:57,739 --> 00:50:58,420
Yeah.

1036
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,659
If you have money.

1037
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:00,900
Hmm.

1038
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,300
Seems that two times of zero is still zero.

1039
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,340
If I use the...

1040
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,500
So if I use the smoke stick...

1041
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:09,179
Does the smoke stick work?

1042
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:11,699
OK, so if it's like, oh, you're about to get attacked by a ghost.

1043
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:13,659
If I do the smoke stick, then they won't get me.

1044
00:51:13,659 --> 00:51:14,780
Is that how it is?

1045
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,380
Ah, you know what?

1046
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,940
I think we have to know what room it's in.

1047
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:22,070
And then just when we're in the room, we just smudge.

1048
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:23,510
I think that's what we did wrong.

1049
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:24,670
Oh, OK.

1050
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,949
Also, the cross have to drop it on the ground.

1051
00:51:27,949 --> 00:51:30,699
I was holding it up like a...

1052
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:31,820
You knew that?

1053
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,059
The first time I tried to do it, I did that exact same thing.

1054
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:35,820
And you know what?

1055
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:36,659
It didn't work.

1056
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:40,059
So it wasn't 50-50.

1057
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,340
I'm just bad.

1058
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,699
Got it.

1059
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:45,300
I figured it would work like that.

1060
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,019
I mean, you see it in movies all the time.

1061
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:48,659
You hold up the cross.

1062
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:49,780
I know.

1063
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,960
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1064
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,800
Anyway.

1065
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,400
Liam, can you vote on the asylum?

1066
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,900
Yes.

1067
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,019
None of us vote.

1068
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:03,059
I'm assuming it's Sonny Meadows that I'm thinking of.

1069
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:05,300
Chat will have to probably clarify what level it is.

1070
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,420
Chat, is it Sonny Meadows?

1071
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,860
It is, yeah, confirmed.

1072
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:08,820
Perfect, OK.

1073
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:12,300
I just saw one yes in my chat, and I took that as objective truth.

1074
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,900
So, it's for me.

1075
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:19,139
Do we have a thermometer?

1076
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:22,699
We're probably going to need that.

1077
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:24,869
We have a ther-pop-eter.

1078
00:52:24,869 --> 00:52:26,750
Don't laugh at that.

1079
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:27,869
I could...

1080
00:52:27,869 --> 00:52:30,840
Playing this game alone would be hard, I think.

1081
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,519
It'd be scary.

1082
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:32,719
I tried it once.

1083
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:34,920
I actually had to take the headset off one time,

1084
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,199
because I was like...

1085
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:37,159
I was too spoopy.

1086
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:40,760
Yeah, it gets like too real in the headset, probably.

1087
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,300
Yeah.

1088
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,690
OK, well...

1089
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:46,010
Let's...

1090
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,449
Let's just go with what we have, I think.

1091
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:51,050
Turn your lights off.

1092
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:53,849
It's like two o'clock in the afternoon right now.

1093
00:52:53,849 --> 00:53:01,429
Like, there's no light. It's not going to do anything.

1094
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:03,269
Crucifix does work in your hand.

1095
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:05,789
It just has a small range, and it prevents the start of the hunt,

1096
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:07,469
not if the ghost is already after you.

1097
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:10,360
OK, I understand.

1098
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,320
You West Coast lads, thank you for joining at the time,

1099
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,000
because I wouldn't have been able to do this later.

1100
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,559
This is perfect.

1101
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:18,760
If it worked out, that's good.

1102
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,820
Perfect for me.

1103
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:24,539
My audience was like, this isn't my usual time,

1104
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:26,980
so they're like, wait, why are you online?

1105
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,150
Why are you here?

1106
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:32,159
Please leave.

1107
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:33,599
I just wish there was like a melee,

1108
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,829
just like a single right-handed melee punch.

1109
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:39,590
Punch the ghost?

1110
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:45,260
I would be so much better at this game if that was in it.

1111
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,340
Like, I would just be the guy that...

1112
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,099
You just deck me out in like the melee gear,

1113
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:48,940
and I just...

1114
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,860
Even if I can only punch three times,

1115
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,260
I would still be... I'd be so much better at this.

1116
00:53:54,659 --> 00:53:57,699
Jerem, I think, ready up, and we'll go into the...

1117
00:53:57,739 --> 00:53:58,900
Sorry, it's my problem.

1118
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,460
Oops.

1119
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,750
It's OK.

1120
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:06,050
We get it. You like Dark Souls.

1121
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:15,329
Great franchise.

1122
00:54:15,329 --> 00:54:17,619
All right.

1123
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:18,420
Everyone load in?

1124
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,260
OK.

1125
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,420
Yep.

1126
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:24,539
Get a ghost to blow out a candle.

1127
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:25,460
I'm taking the cross.

1128
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,139
Have a member of your team escape the ghost during a hunt.

1129
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,539
Repel the ghost with a smudge stick.

1130
00:54:29,539 --> 00:54:33,960
OK.

1131
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,889
Well, you know, when I was writing the Ghostbusters film,

1132
00:54:37,889 --> 00:54:40,150
I got a lot of inspiration.

1133
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:40,590
The trap.

1134
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:44,900
Let me tell you, the ghost didn't blow out a candle.

1135
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,150
Who wants to bring the candle and lighter?

1136
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,030
I'm walking around with this thing.

1137
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,230
I got two spots.

1138
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,190
I'll take the EMS.

1139
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,630
What is the rice scanner?

1140
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:57,219
What's this thing?

1141
00:54:57,219 --> 00:55:01,099
That... You just picked up a thermometer.

1142
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:01,780
That helps.

1143
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,820
If we're looking for freezing temperatures,

1144
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:04,900
we need that.

1145
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,780
Why is this flash, like, crusty?

1146
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,219
Basically, we just need to make sure...

1147
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:11,699
We need to rule out all of the possible evidence

1148
00:55:11,739 --> 00:55:15,980
for the ghost type by using, like, the spirit box EMS,

1149
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,619
just spreading them between all four of us.

1150
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:19,139
OK.

1151
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:20,940
So I have a cross.

1152
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,780
I'm taking the cross.

1153
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:23,260
OK.

1154
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,659
I got a spare slot.

1155
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,059
Do you want to take anything?

1156
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:31,900
Can you take the journal again?

1157
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,219
Yep.

1158
00:55:33,219 --> 00:55:38,139
And once we know where it is, roughly, we can come back,

1159
00:55:38,139 --> 00:55:43,260
get a camera, and then go back in.

1160
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,989
Beatboxing?

1161
00:55:44,989 --> 00:55:49,309
No, I'm just pretending this is a weapon.

1162
00:55:49,309 --> 00:55:51,269
I thought you were, like, spraying compressed air.

1163
00:55:51,269 --> 00:55:52,269
I was like...

1164
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:58,190
From his mouth.

1165
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:00,269
All right, let's do this.

1166
00:56:00,269 --> 00:56:01,110
I got a candle.

1167
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:02,670
Don't make me pick up the whipped cream can

1168
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:05,469
and turn it upside down and do that funny joke.

1169
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:07,949
Oh, this is... You should.

1170
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:08,949
Yeah.

1171
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,230
It looks like I'm not a bum.

1172
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:12,789
Did anybody take an EMF?

1173
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:15,150
Yeah, OK.

1174
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:18,829
This place is actually kind of terrifying.

1175
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:20,110
I hate it.

1176
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,150
All right, I'm leaving.

1177
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:21,750
All right.

1178
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:22,750
See you.

1179
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,039
OK.

1180
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:31,800
Already?

1181
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,320
I've not played this map before.

1182
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,280
OK.

1183
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,960
We're all screwed.

1184
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:41,179
Hey, Liam, when do I light the candle?

1185
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:43,099
Once we know where it is.

1186
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,539
It's all basically contingent on one...

1187
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:49,440
Six bucks.

1188
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,739
How much do you guys think this chair is worth?

1189
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:53,139
Take a guess, like, all three.

1190
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:54,219
At least one.

1191
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:54,860
One dollar?

1192
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:55,380
Don't look at the price.

1193
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,539
Don't look at the price.

1194
00:56:56,539 --> 00:57:00,219
Oh, if the price is right, I'm going to say $14.

1195
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:01,340
$14?

1196
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,420
$35.

1197
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,780
I'm going to say $35 and one cent.

1198
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:05,420
OK.

1199
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,469
All right, let's see.

1200
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:09,309
Sassy.

1201
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:11,349
That was $12.

1202
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:13,780
So who was closer?

1203
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,300
I said $14.

1204
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,659
Yeah, that was close.

1205
00:57:16,659 --> 00:57:17,340
You win it.

1206
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,420
It's your chair now.

1207
00:57:19,099 --> 00:57:19,739
You win the chair.

1208
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:22,019
Why is there a price gun in this game?

1209
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:26,519
That's what I was trying to ask.

1210
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:28,159
Something behind this door.

1211
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:33,260
When you turn it on, look for temperatures.

1212
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:33,980
It's 30.

1213
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:34,820
OK.

1214
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,659
Oh, it's Celsius.

1215
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:37,880
I don't know what this means.

1216
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:38,440
Celsius.

1217
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,599
Oh, I'm the Canadian here.

1218
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:40,719
I can discern.

1219
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:42,199
All right, so what is bad?

1220
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:44,119
What am I looking for here?

1221
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:47,840
Well, you want, like, negative temperatures.

1222
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,920
OK.

1223
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,599
Apparently 10.

1224
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,170
So once it goes below zero.

1225
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:53,650
OK.

1226
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,289
Good to know.

1227
00:57:55,289 --> 00:57:56,889
Pretty cold, pretty cold in here.

1228
00:57:56,889 --> 00:58:04,530
OK, I dropped my.

1229
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:07,369
This is the loudest clicking.

1230
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:08,250
That's what we're doing.

1231
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,199
It is a joke.

1232
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:11,920
OK, I'm doing that with my mouth.

1233
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,800
That's how loud that is.

1234
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,079
That's me going.

1235
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:20,739
Ross, is your EMF on?

1236
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:21,860
Yes.

1237
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,340
OK, perfect.

1238
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,780
And it is so blue.

1239
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:28,130
I'm not sure is VR or real life.

1240
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:35,940
Like, I don't know what's happening.

1241
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,440
Books.

1242
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,760
Star dies in crash.

1243
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,119
Man eats self.

1244
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,280
Oh, man enters space.

1245
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,440
That's less gruesome.

1246
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,530
Man eats self.

1247
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:55,969
That's the headline for today.

1248
00:58:59,289 --> 00:59:00,090
Extra, extra.

1249
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:00,809
Read all about it.

1250
00:59:00,809 --> 00:59:02,969
Man eats self.

1251
00:59:02,969 --> 00:59:04,409
Definitely on a slow news day.

1252
00:59:04,409 --> 00:59:06,130
Yo, Liam, come here.

1253
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,289
I lost my flashlight.

1254
00:59:07,289 --> 00:59:08,449
Hold on.

1255
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:11,130
Do you see this glass?

1256
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,739
What movie is that from?

1257
00:59:14,739 --> 00:59:17,219
I'm just going to say Blade Runner.

1258
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:20,179
Wait, what?

1259
00:59:20,179 --> 00:59:21,420
How would you know that?

1260
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,500
The one they drink whiskey from in Blade Runner,

1261
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,900
where Harrison Ford is like, just walking every scene.

1262
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,860
Like, it's in other things.

1263
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,099
Lightning.

1264
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,380
Just let me have this.

1265
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,380
OK.

1266
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,900
Thunder.

1267
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,860
OK.

1268
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,380
Are these the only rooms?

1269
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,219
No, there's got to be more rooms.

1270
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:41,059
Hold on.

1271
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:43,500
10 degrees so far.

1272
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,099
What about this?

1273
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:45,739
Is this a door we can open?

1274
00:59:45,739 --> 00:59:47,139
I can't, because my hands are full.

1275
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:49,980
But can someone check out these doors?

1276
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,019
Oh, it opens.

1277
00:59:51,019 --> 00:59:53,659
Well, now that makes a whole lot more sense.

1278
00:59:53,659 --> 00:59:56,750
I was going to say, this is a pretty small map.

1279
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,349
Oh, there's a staircase downstairs.

1280
00:59:58,349 --> 00:59:58,829
Oh, god.

1281
00:59:58,829 --> 00:59:59,309
OK.

1282
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:01,780
Oh, god.

1283
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,219
All right.

1284
01:00:03,219 --> 01:00:05,260
Don't push me.

1285
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,420
I'm sorry.

1286
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:12,369
I like this.

1287
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:16,730
I found wet wipes.

1288
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:19,170
Oh, wait, no, that's just never mind.

1289
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:19,690
Are you here?

1290
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:22,349
Give us a sign.

1291
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:23,550
What was that?

1292
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:25,670
Was that me?

1293
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,590
Oh, it's locked.

1294
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,250
OK, OK, OK.

1295
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,690
All right, back up.

1296
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:30,849
All right, so the basement.

1297
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:31,969
Oh, my god.

1298
01:00:31,969 --> 01:00:39,179
We don't have to worry about the basement.

1299
01:00:39,179 --> 01:00:44,099
OK, in real life, lads, how scared would you be?

1300
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:48,150
That, now that is spooky.

1301
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:52,429
As we got a crucifix, we've got a man.

1302
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:52,949
What?

1303
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,230
There's a sacrifice written on the wall.

1304
01:00:55,230 --> 01:01:01,070
It's like that place in, was it Winterhold in Skyrim?

1305
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:02,750
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1306
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,349
Except demonic.

1307
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:07,349
What's this thing down here?

1308
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:09,469
It's like a music box, and it's circled.

1309
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:14,119
I'm sure nothing bad will happen if I.

1310
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:15,519
Oh, you didn't just.

1311
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:17,280
Why would you do that?

1312
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,039
Why would you do that?

1313
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:20,800
Do you like this music, Ghost?

1314
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,039
Can you please answer me?

1315
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:25,119
I'm sitting back here.

1316
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,239
I know what's going to happen.

1317
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:27,440
We're going to get the.

1318
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,920
Oh, it's time to play.

1319
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,280
Here it comes.

1320
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,599
What was that?

1321
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:38,960
It's still blue, guys.

1322
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,599
There's no ghost.

1323
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:42,239
No ghost, OK.

1324
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:43,000
Not Elmo.

1325
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,079
Elmo wants to play.

1326
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:48,619
No, it's like.

1327
01:01:48,619 --> 01:01:49,380
Pretty good.

1328
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:52,900
It was supposed to be like, oh, the scary little girl ghost,

1329
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,780
right?

1330
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,099
I think so.

1331
01:01:58,099 --> 01:01:59,780
Oh, UV light.

1332
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:00,619
Got it, OK.

1333
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:02,460
There's like knocked over responses.

1334
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,059
I'm kind of surprised this place hasn't burned to the ground

1335
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:06,500
by now.

1336
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,769
Yeah.

1337
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:11,090
I don't know the Lord's word.

1338
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:14,650
There's a re-claw mark here.

1339
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:18,440
There's a claw mark of swiping claw and blood.

1340
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,500
Oh, I'm pretty sure that's for decoration.

1341
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,099
I think it might be an animal.

1342
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:25,940
OK, this is like the whole thing.

1343
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,460
The ghost is actually a jaguar.

1344
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:31,340
Wait, what you mean to say is that this asylum

1345
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:35,550
has been turned into a spirit Halloween?

1346
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,590
As is the fate of any abandoned building.

1347
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:42,300
Boss, I think I told you.

1348
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,699
I heard something outside, by the way, guys.

1349
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:47,980
Fallout set I showed you, like where it was.

1350
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,059
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1351
01:02:49,059 --> 01:02:51,059
You know, like where they filmed some of the Fallout show.

1352
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:56,260
It's now a spirit Halloween.

1353
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:57,340
Of course.

1354
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,059
Of course it is.

1355
01:02:59,059 --> 01:03:03,820
It's getting colder, 6.6 degrees Celsius right now.

1356
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:06,300
Dropping rapidly, 4.4.

1357
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,139
I just like pianos in VR games.

1358
01:03:08,139 --> 01:03:09,460
4.4, do I light the candle now?

1359
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,739
There's a...

1360
01:03:11,739 --> 01:03:13,340
Going back, 9.1.

1361
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:16,340
Wait, wait, what just happened?

1362
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,940
The temperature is going all over the place.

1363
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:18,780
We're at 5.5.

1364
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:19,980
Yes, that's a piece of evidence.

1365
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:22,099
We need that for the ghost.

1366
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:24,860
Rapidly changing temperature.

1367
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:27,699
In your evidence, write down freezing temperatures.

1368
01:03:27,699 --> 01:03:29,420
Sorry, I'm clicking.

1369
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:31,340
I only have one free hand.

1370
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:35,900
Yeah, it's going from like 4.5 to like 9.0 to like 4.1.

1371
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,900
It's jumping all over the place.

1372
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,300
If it went down that cold, it has to go below zero.

1373
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,300
Yeah, we're not at zero yet.

1374
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,260
Okay, nevermind.

1375
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,099
Well, I guess we might be close then.

1376
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:51,300
Fluctuating temperatures, is that in the evidence anywhere?

1377
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,340
No.

1378
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,900
It has to go freezing, I think.

1379
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,659
But we must be close.

1380
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:56,500
Should we open the door?

1381
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,480
Either that or just try to kill us and it couldn't find us.

1382
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:01,760
Ghost, please answer.

1383
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,619
Hello?

1384
01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:05,860
You're getting sick of your shit.

1385
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:07,420
Yeah, ghosts.

1386
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,739
Zombie ghosts, leave this place.

1387
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:12,820
Zombie ghosts, leave this place.

1388
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:13,659
Yeah, big hallway.

1389
01:04:13,659 --> 01:04:15,699
I'll be on my deathbed and I'll remember that video.

1390
01:04:15,699 --> 01:04:16,539
Big hallway.

1391
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:29,000
If you are here, give us a sign.

1392
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,239
Give us a sign.

1393
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:31,079
We found the room.

1394
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:33,900
You had to set off the...

1395
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,260
We found the room.

1396
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:36,380
That was me.

1397
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,219
Sorry.

1398
01:04:37,219 --> 01:04:38,059
That was you?

1399
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:39,420
I was so excited for a second.

1400
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,619
I pressed that.

1401
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:42,739
Guys, I found a book of fairy tales.

1402
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:45,539
By Hans Christian Andersen.

1403
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:48,980
Yeah, I love how there's just a shower running

1404
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:51,179
the entire time we're walking around here.

1405
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:54,869
That white noise is good for me.

1406
01:04:54,869 --> 01:04:55,989
I like it.

1407
01:04:55,989 --> 01:04:57,590
Yeah, that's why I keep it on.

1408
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:01,940
I know it's not a good idea, but I do it anyway.

1409
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:02,780
Do you hear that?

1410
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:09,559
Hit thunder?

1411
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:10,400
Weird.

1412
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,239
I was so excited.

1413
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:12,079
I thought we found the room.

1414
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:15,380
Wait, temperature check.

1415
01:05:16,019 --> 01:05:18,389
Oh, more Deckard drinks.

1416
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:21,300
5.3, 10.2.

1417
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,539
This is fluctuating.

1418
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:24,659
Is it?

1419
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:28,300
5.5, 10.0, 6.3.

1420
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,820
Try moving to different parts of the room.

1421
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,300
See if it gets really cold.

1422
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:36,519
10.4, 4.8 in the corner here.

1423
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:37,679
10.1 in the corner.

1424
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:42,380
It's going from like 10 to three to four to 10 to...

1425
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,139
That's a big change, isn't it?

1426
01:05:46,219 --> 01:05:48,480
He just walked off on his own.

1427
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:49,440
Oh, that's great.

1428
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,280
I'm good.

1429
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,119
I'm just...

1430
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:51,960
Okay.

1431
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:52,800
Hey.

1432
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,639
Oh, nevermind.

1433
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:54,480
Nevermind.

1434
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,639
This door is glitched.

1435
01:05:55,639 --> 01:05:56,480
Is it?

1436
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,320
Do you see?

1437
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,360
Why is this door like comically huge?

1438
01:06:02,539 --> 01:06:04,820
Is anyone else seeing how big this door is?

1439
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,300
It is kind of big.

1440
01:06:09,019 --> 01:06:11,059
This is Andre the Giant's bedroom.

1441
01:06:11,059 --> 01:06:11,900
No, seriously.

1442
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,860
Is it reaching the ceiling for you guys?

1443
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:14,699
No, no.

1444
01:06:14,699 --> 01:06:15,539
No.

1445
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:17,380
I think you got a silly door.

1446
01:06:17,539 --> 01:06:18,380
I got a silly door.

1447
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,900
I swear I have a Monty Python-esque door.

1448
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,900
It's really wacky.

1449
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,590
A little ghost.

1450
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:32,969
Sounded like I sounded two days ago.

1451
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,420
Hold on.

1452
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,860
Do I look like I'm in the washing machine?

1453
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,699
You do.

1454
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:39,539
You sure do.

1455
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:40,380
5.1.

1456
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:43,420
Oh, it's like that scene in Better Call Saul, Vinny.

1457
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:44,699
So he's Gus.

1458
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:45,539
Wait, wait, wait.

1459
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:47,460
I haven't seen past the first episode.

1460
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:48,300
How can this be possible?

1461
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,300
Shit, I'm so sorry.

1462
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,139
Well.

1463
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,780
There's a guy named Saul.

1464
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,099
I'm kidding.

1465
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:55,219
I've seen past the second season.

1466
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:56,059
Okay.

1467
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,360
Past the second season, okay.

1468
01:07:03,809 --> 01:07:05,289
Past the first episode, it's like, all right,

1469
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:06,809
so you just literally haven't even seen the show.

1470
01:07:06,809 --> 01:07:08,530
Okay.

1471
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:09,929
Yeah.

1472
01:07:09,929 --> 01:07:13,090
Oh yeah, no, I saw the first episode five years ago once.

1473
01:07:16,489 --> 01:07:19,690
I watched it when it premiered,

1474
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:22,210
but only the first five minutes.

1475
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:25,050
I lost everybody.

1476
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:26,250
I lost everybody.

1477
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,090
Where do I go?

1478
01:07:30,619 --> 01:07:31,780
Yeah, just down the hallway here.

1479
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,340
Oh, thank God.

1480
01:07:37,909 --> 01:07:41,019
Can we just like turn the lights on maybe?

1481
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:43,099
8.3, no, it's not, not cold.

1482
01:07:43,099 --> 01:07:44,960
Well, hold on.

1483
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,000
Yeah.

1484
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:54,309
4.5.

1485
01:07:54,309 --> 01:07:55,550
Every time I think I hear a noise,

1486
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:57,150
it's just like some object that someone actually.

1487
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:02,139
Yeah, something's moving.

1488
01:08:02,139 --> 01:08:03,340
Still nothing, huh?

1489
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:05,019
No EMF or anything?

1490
01:08:05,019 --> 01:08:07,900
Yeah, and I got no, oh, my flashlight just.

1491
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,019
Uh-oh.

1492
01:08:09,019 --> 01:08:11,780
Gipped in and out.

1493
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:13,690
Temperature check.

1494
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,090
Temperature check.

1495
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,489
EMF, storm blue.

1496
01:08:16,489 --> 01:08:17,689
We're fine.

1497
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:18,529
10.

1498
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:19,369
What's that?

1499
01:08:19,369 --> 01:08:20,649
That's thunder, that's thunder.

1500
01:08:20,649 --> 01:08:21,489
That's thunder.

1501
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:28,539
I was gonna hold the cross out.

1502
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:31,020
Remember to drop it if there's a spooky ghost.

1503
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,979
Oh, actually, actually drop it on the ground?

1504
01:08:32,979 --> 01:08:34,100
You have to drop it on the ground.

1505
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,100
Yeah, that's how I died before I didn't drop it.

1506
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:36,939
Okay.

1507
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:37,760
Yeah.

1508
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,039
That's very good info.

1509
01:08:40,039 --> 01:08:41,880
This, this gotta be it.

1510
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,319
This little room, come on.

1511
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,159
Come on ghost.

1512
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:46,800
That wood is mine.

1513
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,359
What do you even store in here?

1514
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:51,609
Ghosts.

1515
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:53,569
Yeah, exactly. As soon as you're getting attacked,

1516
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:54,729
whoever has the smudge sticks,

1517
01:08:54,729 --> 01:08:55,810
as soon as you're getting attacked,

1518
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:58,609
just immediately pull out the smudge stick and smudge.

1519
01:08:58,609 --> 01:08:59,529
No matter what happens.

1520
01:08:59,529 --> 01:09:00,489
We're locked in.

1521
01:09:00,489 --> 01:09:01,329
We're locked in.

1522
01:09:02,369 --> 01:09:03,210
Oh, we're locked in.

1523
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:04,050
We're locked in. Are you sure?

1524
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:04,890
I am. Are you sure it's locked in?

1525
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:05,890
We're locked in. Pull it back.

1526
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:06,930
Pull it back.

1527
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:09,310
No. There you go.

1528
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:11,149
Whoa, whoa, funny door.

1529
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:11,989
Ah, yeah.

1530
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:17,340
There's some funny doors in this game.

1531
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:19,100
This door opens too.

1532
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,220
I just don't need to be here.

1533
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:21,420
The fourth person here,

1534
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,220
and I just don't know how to open a door.

1535
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:24,060
I'm like, we're locked in.

1536
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:24,880
We're locked in.

1537
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,720
It's like, no, you just didn't open it.

1538
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,340
It's push, not pull.

1539
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,500
Yo, there's gherkins in here.

1540
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,899
Oh shit.

1541
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:34,100
No ghosts, but gherkins.

1542
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,699
Dropping the flashlight

1543
01:09:35,699 --> 01:09:37,779
when the thunder hits is like perfect.

1544
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:46,659
Zoinks.

1545
01:09:46,659 --> 01:09:47,859
What the fuck is that noise?

1546
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:49,500
What is this door?

1547
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,060
It's too big.

1548
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,579
Vinny's brushing his teeth right now.

1549
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:55,020
He said he was gonna brush his teeth for a minute.

1550
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,020
Weep, weep, weep, weep.

1551
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:02,109
Is there even a ghost in this whole place?

1552
01:10:02,109 --> 01:10:02,949
Yeah.

1553
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:03,770
Okay.

1554
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:04,609
Is one of the options for nothing?

1555
01:10:04,609 --> 01:10:05,590
It feels like ours.

1556
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:06,430
This is just, you know what it is?

1557
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:07,869
Is there an option for no ghosts to go home?

1558
01:10:07,869 --> 01:10:08,710
Yeah, yeah.

1559
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:10,989
It's the scariest of all the Phasmophobia maps

1560
01:10:10,989 --> 01:10:12,949
because this is just real life.

1561
01:10:12,949 --> 01:10:14,739
Yeah.

1562
01:10:14,739 --> 01:10:16,979
I think the ghost is a gas leak.

1563
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:19,300
Do you smell bark, ghost?

1564
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,880
It's just, that's the sound we're hearing.

1565
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,880
Ghost, give us a sign.

1566
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,479
Carbon monoxide alarms failed us.

1567
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,439
Yeah, oh, I think I can smell the ghost, guys.

1568
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:34,199
I think I can smell it like sulfur.

1569
01:10:37,899 --> 01:10:40,869
There's a small pencil on the couch.

1570
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:41,970
No ghosts, but.

1571
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,640
Where is this?

1572
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,800
Is there like a ghost that doesn't come out

1573
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,640
and they kind of hide and we have to do something?

1574
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,920
Yeah, there is a ghost that's shy.

1575
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,039
Oh, and you have to split up, right?

1576
01:10:56,039 --> 01:10:57,920
Yeah, that could be it.

1577
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,930
All right.

1578
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:01,850
But we need to, we don't have any readings,

1579
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,529
so we have nothing to go off of.

1580
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:05,130
Yeah, we don't, yeah.

1581
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:08,369
I was gonna say, I'll volunteer as bait

1582
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:10,329
for the ghost if you want.

1583
01:11:10,329 --> 01:11:11,170
Okay.

1584
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:12,729
It did work well last time.

1585
01:11:16,829 --> 01:11:19,310
Well, have we been down here?

1586
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:23,779
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1587
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,520
How would it not be in this room?

1588
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,840
I guess we went through a giant circle.

1589
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,960
This room is like the I am a ghost.

1590
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,680
We're heading back to the truck.

1591
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,020
Uh-oh.

1592
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,220
We're heading back to the truck if you wanna.

1593
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:36,060
Oh, okay, I'm coming.

1594
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,760
I'll guide you, where are you?

1595
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,300
Okay, good.

1596
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,500
I didn't want you to get lost again.

1597
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,619
Do we have any cameras or anything?

1598
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:50,140
We do, we just, there's no reason to set it up

1599
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,819
if we have no idea where it is.

1600
01:11:52,819 --> 01:11:53,819
All right, let's, let's.

1601
01:11:53,819 --> 01:11:58,340
We had a board brush for the ghost.

1602
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,659
Oh, what?

1603
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:00,859
Yeah, we're at zero sanity.

1604
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:01,699
What?

1605
01:12:01,699 --> 01:12:03,739
There's activity at 10.

1606
01:12:03,739 --> 01:12:05,140
What?

1607
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:05,979
What happened?

1608
01:12:05,979 --> 01:12:08,180
The half reader didn't do anything.

1609
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,899
We just all went crazy in there.

1610
01:12:09,899 --> 01:12:10,939
We are all apparently insane,

1611
01:12:10,939 --> 01:12:18,470
but I mean, I don't feel any different.

1612
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:20,789
Should we just take pills?

1613
01:12:20,789 --> 01:12:22,069
I guess we should.

1614
01:12:22,069 --> 01:12:25,470
Well, it was so probably haunted you guys.

1615
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:28,310
I guess I'm taking a fucking pill then, all right.

1616
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:33,180
So this activity you said at 10.

1617
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,100
Yeah, it said the activity was at 10,

1618
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,579
like so soon, right here.

1619
01:12:36,579 --> 01:12:38,739
Somebody said we should check downstairs.

1620
01:12:38,739 --> 01:12:41,779
So we were probably on the verge of potting.

1621
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:43,300
Okay, we were right there.

1622
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:48,350
I just spilled coffee all over me.

1623
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:49,470
I could really use anything.

1624
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:55,989
I don't care.

1625
01:12:55,989 --> 01:12:59,970
Is anybody there?

1626
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:05,970
It's not that much.

1627
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:09,789
Hello, is there anybody in there?

1628
01:13:09,789 --> 01:13:15,689
Spirit, show yourself.

1629
01:13:15,689 --> 01:13:18,449
We should just lure it out with mean words.

1630
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:20,369
I mean, we've been down this hallway.

1631
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:21,210
We need to go down.

1632
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:23,329
Let me go back to the church

1633
01:13:23,329 --> 01:13:25,489
and I'll just like separate from you.

1634
01:13:25,489 --> 01:13:27,569
Wait, that's a terrible idea.

1635
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:30,489
We got to go in twos.

1636
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:31,329
We got to do twos.

1637
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:33,250
Yeah, we'll pretend to not be in there.

1638
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,859
Yeah.

1639
01:13:35,859 --> 01:13:38,500
So if you like shut the door, maybe.

1640
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,500
You guys didn't try to pull on the basement door,

1641
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,970
says a chat member.

1642
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:44,529
We didn't pull on the basement door.

1643
01:13:44,529 --> 01:13:45,930
There's a basement door?

1644
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:49,460
Where are those stairs?

1645
01:13:53,060 --> 01:14:00,119
That lightning was closer.

1646
01:14:00,119 --> 01:14:02,159
So where's this basement door that we're,

1647
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:06,140
oh, oh, oh, basement door is open.

1648
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:06,979
Okay.

1649
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,060
I'm.

1650
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:08,899
You all right, Vinny?

1651
01:14:08,899 --> 01:14:10,939
I'm fairly sure we went down here earlier.

1652
01:14:10,939 --> 01:14:12,140
Oh, fuck.

1653
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,670
We did.

1654
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:15,069
Did we already go down here?

1655
01:14:15,069 --> 01:14:15,909
Yeah, we did.

1656
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:16,750
We did.

1657
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:17,590
Yeah.

1658
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:18,430
The mattress at the bottom.

1659
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:24,060
Shit.

1660
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,020
It's not the room?

1661
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,380
I'm starting to think that this was an elaborate scheme

1662
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,060
by somebody to tell us to all be here

1663
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,220
and yeah, go find the ghost

1664
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,939
while they rob all of our houses.

1665
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:45,840
Like, we're just here.

1666
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:52,859
I have no idea.

1667
01:14:52,859 --> 01:14:54,380
What funny door.

1668
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:56,380
You don't see it, do you?

1669
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,699
If you pull on it, Liam, pull on the door in VR.

1670
01:14:59,699 --> 01:15:01,390
Okay.

1671
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:02,829
Tell me if you can make it a funny door.

1672
01:15:02,829 --> 01:15:04,029
You got it?

1673
01:15:04,029 --> 01:15:05,029
It extends.

1674
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:07,270
No way.

1675
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:08,109
Oh my God.

1676
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:09,750
Wait, what?

1677
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:10,590
What?

1678
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:11,430
There's a funny door.

1679
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:14,270
Holy shit, this is the biggest door of all time.

1680
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:16,670
Can you guys pull on the door backwards?

1681
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:18,350
Like pull from the edge back?

1682
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:20,189
Oh my God.

1683
01:15:20,189 --> 01:15:23,380
I just turned it into a wall.

1684
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,659
Oh my God.

1685
01:15:24,699 --> 01:15:28,300
Every time someone uses the door, it gets bigger.

1686
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,180
Yeah, it's huge.

1687
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:30,579
It's at the ceiling for me almost.

1688
01:15:30,579 --> 01:15:32,380
I'm gonna load up your stream.

1689
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:34,060
Oh my God, what the?

1690
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:34,899
What?

1691
01:15:34,899 --> 01:15:35,739
Dude, what?

1692
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:38,220
Is it funny?

1693
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,060
This is better than the ghost.

1694
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:39,899
It's like someone's gonna use

1695
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:41,779
the free transform tool on the door.

1696
01:15:45,699 --> 01:15:48,460
Maybe the ghost is inhabiting this door.

1697
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,300
Maybe this is what it is.

1698
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,579
Is that in the evidence, giant door?

1699
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,619
Can we, yeah, put the ghost as door?

1700
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:57,170
Oops, can I pick that back up?

1701
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:58,010
Okay.

1702
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:00,979
The door is now.

1703
01:16:00,979 --> 01:16:03,380
It is 10 point, what did the game,

1704
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:04,460
did we get locked somehow

1705
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:08,420
and the ghost just didn't spawn in here?

1706
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:09,819
This door is now broken for me.

1707
01:16:09,819 --> 01:16:10,979
I can't actually grab it.

1708
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:11,819
Okay, here, let me try.

1709
01:16:11,819 --> 01:16:12,819
Yeah, neither can I.

1710
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,460
I think we're in trouble here then.

1711
01:16:17,659 --> 01:16:20,899
Yeah, the door's, yeah, the door broke.

1712
01:16:20,899 --> 01:16:21,739
Oh, I got it.

1713
01:16:21,739 --> 01:16:22,579
There you go.

1714
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:23,420
You got it.

1715
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,260
Oh my God.

1716
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,739
I have to maneuver around the door.

1717
01:16:26,739 --> 01:16:27,819
Do I spin like this?

1718
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:30,289
Does the door look silly?

1719
01:16:30,289 --> 01:16:33,090
Oh, oh, it's gittering.

1720
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:35,210
It's got collision too, all the way through.

1721
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,250
Yeah, oh my.

1722
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:55,439
The more collision it has.

1723
01:16:55,439 --> 01:16:58,479
Jerma?

1724
01:16:58,479 --> 01:16:59,319
Yeah.

1725
01:16:59,319 --> 01:17:00,159
Yep, I copy.

1726
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:01,680
Where am I?

1727
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:05,699
Where are you, Jerma?

1728
01:17:05,699 --> 01:17:06,659
Actually, help me.

1729
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:11,800
I actually, help, help, help, help, help, help me.

1730
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,279
Help, actually help.

1731
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:14,119
Are you behind this door?

1732
01:17:14,119 --> 01:17:15,960
I'm behind that door.

1733
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,239
Okay, I can't open it.

1734
01:17:19,239 --> 01:17:21,380
Why is the door locked now?

1735
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,529
I don't know.

1736
01:17:23,529 --> 01:17:27,840
You could try the other door to get into, yeah.

1737
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:28,680
It's right here.

1738
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,520
Help me.

1739
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,359
Open the door.

1740
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:31,199
Open it, open it, open it.

1741
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,039
Open it.

1742
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:37,739
Where, where are you?

1743
01:17:37,739 --> 01:17:38,579
Where was this?

1744
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:46,500
What the fuck?

1745
01:17:55,149 --> 01:17:56,430
I was, okay.

1746
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:58,829
I did the, everyone that says

1747
01:17:58,829 --> 01:18:00,789
that I would never do the thing that happens

1748
01:18:00,789 --> 01:18:03,149
in movies, right?

1749
01:18:03,149 --> 01:18:05,430
Where, oh no, I'm trying the door.

1750
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:08,670
I'm pulling, I'm yanking on the fucking door

1751
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:10,310
and it's closed and I can't open it.

1752
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,390
Everyone says I would never do that, right?

1753
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:15,189
You've got three seconds to get away from that thing.

1754
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:16,350
I did that thing.

1755
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:17,909
I went for the handle and I tried to grip it

1756
01:18:17,909 --> 01:18:19,590
and I pulled as hard as I fucking could.

1757
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:22,689
I should have just sprinted.

1758
01:18:22,689 --> 01:18:25,289
I should have sprinted the fuck away.

1759
01:18:25,289 --> 01:18:26,250
And yes, I understand.

1760
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,369
I realize I'm in a family guy death pose.

1761
01:18:28,369 --> 01:18:30,250
I get it, I understand.

1762
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,090
It's funny.

1763
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:42,979
Well, at least I pulled the ghost into aggro.

1764
01:18:42,979 --> 01:18:46,100
I'm happy about this.

1765
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,939
I recommend, we need to be careful what we say

1766
01:18:47,939 --> 01:18:57,859
because the ghost will know if we're going to be some kind.

1767
01:18:57,859 --> 01:19:00,260
All right, can I see the ghost now that I'm dead?

1768
01:19:01,539 --> 01:19:03,220
Same as family guy death.

1769
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:08,060
It's been better than I thought.

1770
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:10,420
Oh my god, how beautiful.

1771
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:11,859
Oh my god.

1772
01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:13,319
Oh my god.

1773
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:14,319
Oh, holy shit.

1774
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:15,159
Holy shit.

1775
01:19:15,159 --> 01:19:16,520
It's definitely falling easy.

1776
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,680
All I can hear is just muffled Peter Griffin

1777
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,520
and impressions.

1778
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,300
Holy crap, Lois.

1779
01:19:32,569 --> 01:19:35,010
Your roommates are watching family guy.

1780
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:40,409
Oh, that's, what the fuck?

1781
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:52,319
I could have pulled the door off.

1782
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,039
Wait, I could have pulled the door off

1783
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,439
and just walked away.

1784
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:00,560
You got to be shitting me.

1785
01:20:15,939 --> 01:20:17,420
I wonder who she's coming for.

1786
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:26,699
Who's screaming?

1787
01:20:42,779 --> 01:20:44,340
She's right there, she's coming.

1788
01:20:49,539 --> 01:20:51,390
What?

1789
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:53,079
Oh, it's you.

1790
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,680
Give me, I need to fuck with them, right?

1791
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,560
I need a, I need like a small plate.

1792
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:27,939
I just stood behind Liam and let the,

1793
01:21:27,939 --> 01:21:29,060
Oh, hey, Jerma, what's up?

1794
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:31,439
Hey, what's up?

1795
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:32,680
I died a horrible death.

1796
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:38,100
Yeah, that was, it's pretty rough.

1797
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,500
Yeah, that's, they can do that when they die.

1798
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,539
Oh no, they're telling us to check the book.

1799
01:21:43,539 --> 01:21:44,380
Okay.

1800
01:21:46,279 --> 01:21:47,640
So what did we have?

1801
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,760
We had, did we have,

1802
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:52,359
This is so funny.

1803
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:56,829
Wait, pick up the book if they drew something.

1804
01:21:56,989 --> 01:21:57,829
Did they?

1805
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:58,670
I don't think they did.

1806
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:00,869
Okay, pick up the book if there were fingerprints.

1807
01:22:00,869 --> 01:22:03,109
I didn't see any, I had the thing, nevermind.

1808
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:07,229
I just died and panicked, that's all that happened.

1809
01:22:07,229 --> 01:22:09,350
Yeah, you died in the Family Guy pose

1810
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:10,710
and like your skull was caved in.

1811
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:11,750
It was just terrible.

1812
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:12,590
Really?

1813
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:13,430
All around.

1814
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:14,270
Yeah.

1815
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:16,310
It was freezing.

1816
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:17,149
There was no EMF level five.

1817
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:17,989
Like we could see your teeth.

1818
01:22:17,989 --> 01:22:20,430
It was, it was gruesome.

1819
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:24,630
They're waving a book at us, does that mean?

1820
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:25,470
Do I have a book in my hand?

1821
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:27,909
Obviously, this is probably just gonna be a guess.

1822
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:29,710
Yeah, I didn't see any writing.

1823
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:31,270
I don't even think it interacted with the candle.

1824
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:32,909
I think, oh man.

1825
01:22:32,909 --> 01:22:34,439
Gym.

1826
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:35,319
Gym?

1827
01:22:35,319 --> 01:22:36,199
Gym.

1828
01:22:36,199 --> 01:22:38,199
Oh, it says gin, I thought it said gym.

1829
01:22:39,399 --> 01:22:40,640
Wait, I thought it said gym too.

1830
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:41,800
Oh, ghost orbs, let me,

1831
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,760
let me symbol the ghost orb thing, hold on.

1832
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,600
I can't pick this shit up.

1833
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,800
Chat, how about this, chat, why don't,

1834
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,000
based on what you've seen, do you have any guesses, chat?

1835
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:49,840
Do you wanna do gym?

1836
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,680
Chat.

1837
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:51,520
How do I, how do I signal that?

1838
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,479
What do you chat think?

1839
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:54,159
I don't know, how do we, how do we show?

1840
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:55,000
A lot of people say gym.

1841
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:55,840
Yeah, move it around.

1842
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,920
I'm just checking your chat now.

1843
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:57,760
This thing, this thing, this thing,

1844
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,560
floating around.

1845
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,760
On the book.

1846
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,840
It's all a prank by some guy named gym.

1847
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:05,920
Did you see it?

1848
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:11,779
Book might mean book evidence.

1849
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:18,350
Please.

1850
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,220
Just start pulling wires up from the computer.

1851
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:24,060
Yeah.

1852
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:25,020
Okay, they're, wait, they're, they're,

1853
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:28,619
they're throwing a, I can't, a ball, a ball, a ball.

1854
01:23:28,619 --> 01:23:29,619
Oh, they're telling us to look at,

1855
01:23:29,619 --> 01:23:30,859
they're telling us to look at the camera.

1856
01:23:30,859 --> 01:23:32,939
Look, look, look, look, look, they.

1857
01:23:32,939 --> 01:23:33,779
The bell.

1858
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:42,079
Why did that happen so many times?

1859
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:43,920
I'm gonna go get another fucking weird object

1860
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:49,039
that means nothing, hold on.

1861
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:52,279
Oh, they brought a, they brought a bottle of ketchup.

1862
01:23:52,279 --> 01:23:56,640
I wonder what that means.

1863
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:02,250
I'm gonna just keep throwing shit in here.

1864
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,210
Look, you can hit the bell while they're holding it.

1865
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:10,630
The Solonka returns.

1866
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:19,010
Can I bring this plant?

1867
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:24,010
No.

1868
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:25,529
Was that like a pen?

1869
01:24:25,529 --> 01:24:31,270
What was I gonna pick up?

1870
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:33,569
A clipboard?

1871
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:40,479
Okay, yeah, a clipboard.

1872
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:48,520
I think I'm lost.

1873
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,359
But I guess.

1874
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:51,039
Are you a clipboard?

1875
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:52,359
Yeah, a clipboard, a clipboard.

1876
01:24:52,359 --> 01:24:53,199
Where did you find that?

1877
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:54,039
I don't know.

1878
01:24:54,039 --> 01:24:54,880
Stay out here.

1879
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,079
If I don't come back, you guess, I'll be in touch.

1880
01:24:57,079 --> 01:24:59,600
Do you want my headlight thing?

1881
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,680
Yeah.

1882
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,840
I actually have no idea how to take it off.

1883
01:25:08,739 --> 01:25:11,300
How do I do like a follow me this way, this way?

1884
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:15,029
Just like throw in front of their face

1885
01:25:15,029 --> 01:25:17,670
and then drag it this way.

1886
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:18,510
So.

1887
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:20,229
Or like just shake it around and then.

1888
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:22,109
Yeah, I'm gonna make like a little trail with it.

1889
01:25:22,109 --> 01:25:31,970
Why don't I, you take the camera.

1890
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:34,130
I'm like trying to gesture them to come after you.

1891
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:38,739
Yeah.

1892
01:25:38,739 --> 01:25:40,500
Don't do it, Vinny.

1893
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,340
Take a smudge stick.

1894
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:42,579
You know what?

1895
01:25:42,579 --> 01:25:46,060
Nope, since Jerma and Liam died,

1896
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,979
I'm just gonna vote Gin.

1897
01:25:47,979 --> 01:25:48,979
I don't care.

1898
01:25:48,979 --> 01:25:49,819
Oh no.

1899
01:25:49,819 --> 01:25:50,659
Yeah, fuck it, let's go for Gin.

1900
01:25:50,659 --> 01:25:51,819
Screw it.

1901
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:52,779
Worth a shot.

1902
01:25:52,779 --> 01:25:54,729
Wait, we get to go.

1903
01:25:54,729 --> 01:25:56,770
Oh, I forgot to vote Gin.

1904
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:59,579
There we go.

1905
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:00,899
We got nothing.

1906
01:26:00,899 --> 01:26:07,619
Do we not get it?

1907
01:26:07,619 --> 01:26:09,760
Do we get it?

1908
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,600
Miling.

1909
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,750
No.

1910
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:13,989
Not Gin.

1911
01:26:13,989 --> 01:26:16,029
I got $20 for that.

1912
01:26:16,029 --> 01:26:17,630
I know, how are we supposed to make any money?

1913
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:20,470
Single level or single dollar.

1914
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:22,109
Oh my God.

1915
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:24,149
I made 25 bucks an hour ago

1916
01:26:24,149 --> 01:26:26,819
and I don't know how it happened, but it did.

1917
01:26:26,819 --> 01:26:29,640
That map was just too big.

1918
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,199
Maybe it's the difficulty we're on?

1919
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,119
No, no, intermediate's fine.

1920
01:26:37,619 --> 01:26:38,939
Liam, are there any other levels

1921
01:26:38,939 --> 01:26:43,100
that are like mid to small sized that you have access to?

1922
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:45,579
Yeah, can you access Tanglewood and Edgefield?

1923
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:49,140
This game is cool.

1924
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:54,720
Is there a hoop?

1925
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:57,789
Yeah, actually up here.

1926
01:26:57,789 --> 01:26:59,229
Is there?

1927
01:26:59,229 --> 01:27:00,069
Right here.

1928
01:27:02,229 --> 01:27:03,750
Oh, okay, that's blending in for me.

1929
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:04,590
All right.

1930
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:05,430
Maybe that's too small, but that's all right.

1931
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:07,229
That's not very well-interesting.

1932
01:27:07,229 --> 01:27:09,029
I guess we wanna feel some success today.

1933
01:27:09,029 --> 01:27:10,029
Wait.

1934
01:27:10,029 --> 01:27:10,869
No.

1935
01:27:10,869 --> 01:27:11,710
Oh.

1936
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:16,369
Yeah, I don't at least make Jerma fuck

1937
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:17,890
more than five bucks.

1938
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:18,729
Yeah.

1939
01:27:18,729 --> 01:27:19,569
That's my goal.

1940
01:27:20,649 --> 01:27:21,489
No, I'm good.

1941
01:27:21,489 --> 01:27:22,329
It's fine.

1942
01:27:22,329 --> 01:27:25,529
It's fun just to kind of walk around and be scared.

1943
01:27:25,529 --> 01:27:27,930
Look at the twins playing basketball over there.

1944
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:29,409
That's so pleasant.

1945
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:30,529
The Zuckerbergs.

1946
01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:37,539
Oh shit, I gotta add my equipment.

1947
01:27:37,539 --> 01:27:41,149
I gotta, I gotta, I got it in.

1948
01:27:41,149 --> 01:27:41,989
You got it in?

1949
01:27:41,989 --> 01:27:42,829
All this equipment is still here.

1950
01:27:42,829 --> 01:27:43,670
Yeah, I got it in.

1951
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:44,829
That's a win for me.

1952
01:27:44,829 --> 01:27:46,670
Hold on, I have to do it now.

1953
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:47,510
Oh, cause I died.

1954
01:27:48,510 --> 01:28:00,720
Let's just bounce back and hang me in the face.

1955
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,439
See, yeah, they, the UI on how this works.

1956
01:28:03,439 --> 01:28:06,239
So I'm like a little confused, but it'll be.

1957
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,760
I don't like that they changed it to this.

1958
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:09,840
I don't get it.

1959
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,619
It was weird at first.

1960
01:28:12,619 --> 01:28:14,140
What, they did like a big UI update?

1961
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:15,140
$15.

1962
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:15,979
Yeah.

1963
01:28:18,779 --> 01:28:20,260
I mean, it looks nicer, but.

1964
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:23,180
Have you guys played the Village DLC?

1965
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:24,020
Not yet.

1966
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:24,859
No, not yet.

1967
01:28:24,859 --> 01:28:26,729
It's good.

1968
01:28:26,729 --> 01:28:29,289
Are you still playing Splatoon?

1969
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:31,050
Yeah.

1970
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:32,409
You want to play Splatoon one of these days?

1971
01:28:32,409 --> 01:28:33,970
You want to do the salmon thing?

1972
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:34,850
Salmon run?

1973
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:35,970
Yeah, I'm down.

1974
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:37,529
I love salmon run and play that.

1975
01:28:37,529 --> 01:28:39,649
That's pretty much all I play on that game now.

1976
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:42,399
Except for maybe some rank.

1977
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:43,920
It's such a fun PvE mode.

1978
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,479
I got really addicted to that for a while.

1979
01:28:46,479 --> 01:28:47,640
So yeah, I'm down.

1980
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,479
I'll play.

1981
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:51,720
I slept on Splatoon for, since the first came out.

1982
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:54,130
First one.

1983
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:57,130
I did not think it was as intricate and fun as it was.

1984
01:28:57,130 --> 01:28:58,409
It is, yeah, it's great.

1985
01:28:58,409 --> 01:29:00,050
I mean, it, but it evolved too.

1986
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:01,130
The first one was good,

1987
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:03,489
but now it's like the best it's ever been, so.

1988
01:29:03,489 --> 01:29:04,329
I think you know what the big,

1989
01:29:04,329 --> 01:29:05,970
the huge turnoff for me was?

1990
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:08,329
That first game being on the Wii U,

1991
01:29:08,329 --> 01:29:12,770
and like I, it's just that big brick console in your hand,

1992
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:18,710
and the gyroscope, I don't know, it wasn't for me.

1993
01:29:18,909 --> 01:29:21,229
Well, the gyro is definitely way more manageable

1994
01:29:21,229 --> 01:29:22,510
on an actual controller,

1995
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:25,029
rather than the Fisher Price game pad they gave you.

1996
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:27,880
Hey guys.

1997
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:28,720
Yeah.

1998
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,199
That door over there, can you go and press that door?

1999
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:33,000
Press it?

2000
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,260
Yeah.

2001
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:36,100
What the?

2002
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:43,319
Who are the other people in the lobby?

2003
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:44,359
Did we invite some people?

2004
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:45,359
People join off you?

2005
01:29:47,489 --> 01:29:48,930
Chad said go in the center.

2006
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:50,529
What are you, Chad?

2007
01:29:50,529 --> 01:29:52,010
Use a black light.

2008
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:54,289
Use a black light on the inner circle.

2009
01:29:54,289 --> 01:29:55,130
We have a black light.

2010
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:56,130
My name is Jeremy, what's up, man?

2011
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:57,770
What's your, what's your channel?

2012
01:29:57,770 --> 01:29:59,090
What's your Twitch channel?

2013
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:03,430
I think your mic is messed up, man.

2014
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:04,909
Who invited, are these friends?

2015
01:30:04,909 --> 01:30:09,310
Yeah.

2016
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:11,289
Behind the counter.

2017
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:12,850
Oh, oh, oh, hang on, hang on, guys.

2018
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:16,739
There's a little thing that we have to do here, hang on.

2019
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:19,689
All right, here, look.

2020
01:30:19,689 --> 01:30:20,529
Oh.

2021
01:30:20,529 --> 01:30:21,369
It's gonna get weird,

2022
01:30:21,369 --> 01:30:22,489
because we're all gonna be talking at the same time,

2023
01:30:22,489 --> 01:30:25,090
so I mean, can you guys mute your microphones

2024
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:29,090
so our streams don't, I know we're like all.

2025
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,569
There's too many people in this lobby, sorry.

2026
01:30:30,569 --> 01:30:32,090
Yeah, I mean, it's gonna be weird.

2027
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:33,050
Oh.

2028
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:33,890
Maybe we could split it off

2029
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:35,489
into two different discords or something.

2030
01:30:35,489 --> 01:30:39,420
It's gonna be kind of weird.

2031
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:40,779
What's that?

2032
01:30:40,779 --> 01:30:41,619
They're dead now.

2033
01:30:41,619 --> 01:30:44,420
If you stand here, did they do the thing for you?

2034
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:45,340
What thing?

2035
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,180
Wait, wait, what is happening?

2036
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:47,020
What is happening?

2037
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:47,840
What is happening?

2038
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:48,680
Oh no, what?

2039
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,520
What?

2040
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:50,340
What?

2041
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,180
No.

2042
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:52,020
They became come on the floor, what's happening?

2043
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:52,859
That's what I was thinking.

2044
01:30:52,859 --> 01:30:54,220
I didn't want to say it out loud.

2045
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:57,539
Nothing's happening.

2046
01:30:57,539 --> 01:30:59,260
Oh.

2047
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:03,060
Hey, dude, one of you guys turn your TV down

2048
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:04,539
as he's coming to the mic, one of you guys.

2049
01:31:04,539 --> 01:31:06,539
They left, they all disconnected.

2050
01:31:06,539 --> 01:31:08,300
Yeah, they DC'd.

2051
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:09,300
It's all right, it's for the best.

2052
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,579
We don't like them anyway.

2053
01:31:10,579 --> 01:31:11,579
It'd probably be hard to do that anyways.

2054
01:31:11,579 --> 01:31:13,579
We'll just do this map.

2055
01:31:13,579 --> 01:31:14,579
All right, let's ready up.

2056
01:31:14,739 --> 01:31:16,619
I'm confident this time.

2057
01:31:16,619 --> 01:31:17,460
We'll get it.

2058
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:20,100
I mean, I'm down to play another like half hour.

2059
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,739
Is that cool guys?

2060
01:31:21,739 --> 01:31:24,619
Yeah, then I'll have to hop off anyway.

2061
01:31:24,619 --> 01:31:27,079
Okay, so we'll definitely get the.

2062
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:32,189
That's like the kind of like,

2063
01:31:32,189 --> 01:31:34,750
you got to back away from the TV.

2064
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:37,869
Both hands up, face into the television.

2065
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:42,460
That was, you were too close.

2066
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:43,420
Okay, smudge stick,

2067
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:46,260
and we have to have a ghost walk through salt.

2068
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:47,890
Okay.

2069
01:31:47,890 --> 01:31:49,890
German's on smudge stick duty again.

2070
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:51,680
That sounds good.

2071
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,579
I can take EMF again.

2072
01:31:53,579 --> 01:31:55,520
We don't have enough flashlights.

2073
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,920
I don't think.

2074
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:57,760
Wait, really?

2075
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,460
Oh boy.

2076
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:02,300
That's all right.

2077
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,340
That's just peachy.

2078
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:04,340
Hey, there's, I'll tell you what,

2079
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:06,659
I'll use the black light.

2080
01:32:06,659 --> 01:32:08,180
So who wants this extra flashlight?

2081
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,659
It's right here.

2082
01:32:09,659 --> 01:32:10,659
It's.

2083
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:12,020
I'll take it.

2084
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:14,979
All right, hang on, I'll put it back up here.

2085
01:32:14,979 --> 01:32:16,060
Did we have an EMF?

2086
01:32:16,939 --> 01:32:17,779
Yep.

2087
01:32:17,779 --> 01:32:19,000
Yes, perfect.

2088
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,760
I got lighter smudge stick flashlight.

2089
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,600
I got salt, I got black light,

2090
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,399
and I'll bring. Do you have a lighter, German?

2091
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:27,479
Yep.

2092
01:32:27,479 --> 01:32:28,319
Okay, I think we're all set.

2093
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:30,439
I'll bring a spirit box.

2094
01:32:30,439 --> 01:32:32,119
I'll bring the sound thing. Oh, you are?

2095
01:32:32,119 --> 01:32:32,960
Yeah.

2096
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,000
If you're bringing spirit box.

2097
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,359
I've got EMF and spirit box.

2098
01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:38,159
Oh, do we have a thermometer or did I?

2099
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:39,680
No, I don't think we have one.

2100
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:41,319
I don't think so.

2101
01:32:41,319 --> 01:32:42,520
Okay, that's fine.

2102
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,479
That's just one equipment, that's fine.

2103
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,000
All right, well, I'm gonna take a journal, man.

2104
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,840
What's this key for?

2105
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,840
What's this thing?

2106
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,600
That's the key to the house, yeah.

2107
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,600
Oh, okay.

2108
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,789
Oh.

2109
01:32:56,789 --> 01:32:59,310
So remember, we have to have a ghost walk through salt

2110
01:32:59,310 --> 01:33:00,710
and we have to use the smudge stick

2111
01:33:00,710 --> 01:33:03,029
when the ghost is chasing one of us.

2112
01:33:03,029 --> 01:33:05,390
Okay, wait, isn't this the baby level?

2113
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:06,229
This is the baby level?

2114
01:33:06,229 --> 01:33:07,069
We need a win.

2115
01:33:07,069 --> 01:33:08,069
We need a win.

2116
01:33:08,069 --> 01:33:12,109
We need a win, we need a win, we need a win.

2117
01:33:12,109 --> 01:33:13,510
Okay, yeah, I remember this.

2118
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:17,789
This level I've played a million times, we'll be fine.

2119
01:33:17,789 --> 01:33:18,829
All right, cool.

2120
01:33:18,829 --> 01:33:21,750
I say confidently, knowing that I'll probably die first.

2121
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:26,319
All right.

2122
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:28,520
I'm gonna make a pickle sandwich if anyone knows one.

2123
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,880
Ghost, are you in here?

2124
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:31,479
Pickle and peanut butter.

2125
01:33:31,479 --> 01:33:32,640
Ghost, how old are you?

2126
01:33:33,949 --> 01:33:39,710
What is your name?

2127
01:33:39,710 --> 01:33:41,390
Getting ratings over here, guys.

2128
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:42,590
There's four knobs here.

2129
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:44,270
I don't know what this ghost detector is,

2130
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:46,289
but somebody can read that, maybe?

2131
01:33:46,289 --> 01:33:47,430
Can you read it?

2132
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:48,960
I'm over here.

2133
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,000
There's a ghost detecting machine over here.

2134
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,140
It's got four nodules on it.

2135
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:56,600
I'm just trying to figure out what it is.

2136
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:00,600
Can anybody read what that says?

2137
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:02,930
It says gullible.

2138
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:04,760
It does?

2139
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:05,760
It doesn't say that.

2140
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:13,920
Pencil crayons, neat.

2141
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:17,180
This is a small house.

2142
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:18,380
All right.

2143
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:20,260
There's a chat member that said if we do this,

2144
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:21,699
he'll subscribe to my channel.

2145
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:22,539
Really?

2146
01:34:22,539 --> 01:34:23,659
All right, let's do it.

2147
01:34:23,659 --> 01:34:24,779
We gotta do this.

2148
01:34:24,779 --> 01:34:26,300
It's on the line now.

2149
01:34:38,949 --> 01:34:40,350
Spirit, I'm not the ghost,

2150
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:45,300
but I have to say the spirit temple is more fun.

2151
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:46,859
Spirit temple.

2152
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:49,760
Honestly, that's kind of a tough one for me.

2153
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,399
I don't even know what they're talking about.

2154
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:55,800
Oh, you guys can hear me.

2155
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,359
I thought I was far enough away.

2156
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:07,520
Bartholomew.

2157
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,119
Nancy.

2158
01:35:10,119 --> 01:35:11,729
Nancy.

2159
01:35:11,729 --> 01:35:13,130
Nancy.

2160
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:14,449
Okay.

2161
01:35:14,449 --> 01:35:15,770
Ghost, are you Nancy?

2162
01:35:22,909 --> 01:35:23,750
Okay.

2163
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:25,670
Why is this computer so big?

2164
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:27,069
It is huge, isn't it?

2165
01:35:27,069 --> 01:35:29,750
Like, that's a comically oversized computer.

2166
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:30,869
Speaking of, let me see if I can make

2167
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:32,510
these doors bigger.

2168
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:34,399
No.

2169
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:37,239
That's a big tower.

2170
01:35:37,239 --> 01:35:39,680
Well, you can fit a 4080 in there comfortably.

2171
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:40,800
It might just explode,

2172
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,680
but the connectors might burn up before it explodes,

2173
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:46,640
so you might get lucky.

2174
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,399
Yeah, you might get some gaming in before then.

2175
01:35:49,399 --> 01:35:51,239
Level two matches on Call of Duty.

2176
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:56,600
Nope, Nancy.

2177
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:58,680
There's a basement, by the way.

2178
01:35:58,680 --> 01:35:59,520
They might be down there.

2179
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,220
Oh, there's a basement.

2180
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:04,069
Oh, they're definitely in the basement.

2181
01:36:04,069 --> 01:36:05,310
Where we access that basement?

2182
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:06,590
Over here, I think.

2183
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:08,310
Yeah, it's here to the left.

2184
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:09,909
I'm ready with a smudge stick,

2185
01:36:09,909 --> 01:36:11,189
if you want me to use it.

2186
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:20,840
Don't touch that, you'll get electrocuted.

2187
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,460
What is this?

2188
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:24,659
Oh, that's for catching flies, I think.

2189
01:36:24,659 --> 01:36:27,739
Oh, I thought, honestly, this is insane to say,

2190
01:36:27,739 --> 01:36:29,619
but I thought this was the ghost,

2191
01:36:29,619 --> 01:36:31,899
like baiting somebody to come pick this up,

2192
01:36:31,899 --> 01:36:33,699
like they're, like, I'm gonna grab this.

2193
01:36:33,699 --> 01:36:34,859
Like, carry it on a stick.

2194
01:36:34,859 --> 01:36:36,460
It's like tomato soup or something,

2195
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,899
like, oh, tomato soup, and I'd pick it up,

2196
01:36:37,899 --> 01:36:38,739
and they would be like,

2197
01:36:38,779 --> 01:36:40,340
oh, it would pull us up or something.

2198
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:42,739
I thought this was, like, a thing the ghost was doing.

2199
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:48,189
Well, I mean, no.

2200
01:36:48,189 --> 01:36:49,029
That's gross.

2201
01:36:49,989 --> 01:36:50,869
Yeah, it's kind of nasty.

2202
01:36:50,869 --> 01:36:53,569
How long has this been up here?

2203
01:36:53,569 --> 01:36:57,000
How did this many flies get in the basement?

2204
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,699
Not even a window down here.

2205
01:37:01,699 --> 01:37:06,310
Bridge, anything in here?

2206
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:07,710
No, no, nothing, no.

2207
01:37:07,710 --> 01:37:09,229
Oh, what's up?

2208
01:37:09,229 --> 01:37:10,069
You all right?

2209
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:19,960
Minnie, Minnie?

2210
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:20,800
What?

2211
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:21,640
I don't know, nothing happened.

2212
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:26,720
You just made, like, a Five Nights at Freddy's scream sound.

2213
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:31,239
No, a little bit, maybe.

2214
01:37:31,239 --> 01:37:34,090
By the way, what a franchise.

2215
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:36,199
Right?

2216
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:38,520
Aren't they making a TV show starring Henry Cavill

2217
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,840
since he's no longer on The Witcher?

2218
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,239
He's no longer on The Witcher?

2219
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:44,680
Uh, Liam Hemsworth.

2220
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:46,600
Your namesake is replacing him.

2221
01:37:48,409 --> 01:37:49,409
Where's this ghost?

2222
01:37:53,810 --> 01:37:55,720
What was that?

2223
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:56,560
Lighter?

2224
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:57,800
I think Jerma has a lighter.

2225
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:58,800
I have it.

2226
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,760
What do you need?

2227
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,409
Okay.

2228
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:03,729
A little something fun will happen.

2229
01:38:03,729 --> 01:38:04,569
Okay.

2230
01:38:04,569 --> 01:38:05,850
Oh, that'd be cool.

2231
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:06,970
Let's see.

2232
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:09,250
10 DB, 11 DB.

2233
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:10,649
I don't, ow, my fucking thumb.

2234
01:38:10,649 --> 01:38:12,090
How do I light this?

2235
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:14,560
Ow, ow.

2236
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,640
Uh, maybe if it's, I'm in VR, it might be easier.

2237
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:18,479
Here.

2238
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,279
Oh yeah, you can light it.

2239
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:29,579
I'm ready with the smoke stick.

2240
01:38:29,579 --> 01:38:31,100
All right, and.

2241
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:32,779
Smoke stick, smoke stick. Holy shit.

2242
01:38:32,779 --> 01:38:33,619
I don't have to fucking light her.

2243
01:38:33,619 --> 01:38:36,390
Oh my god, oh my god.

2244
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:37,229
Maddie.

2245
01:38:37,229 --> 01:38:38,069
Ah, run.

2246
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:40,989
Oh my god, no, no.

2247
01:38:40,989 --> 01:38:41,909
I closed the door.

2248
01:38:43,310 --> 01:38:44,149
What?

2249
01:38:44,149 --> 01:38:44,989
Oh shit, he died.

2250
01:38:44,989 --> 01:38:45,829
Where's the lighter?

2251
01:38:45,829 --> 01:38:47,350
I can't light the smoke stick anymore.

2252
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:48,310
I have the lighter, I'm sorry.

2253
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:49,149
Smoke stick me.

2254
01:38:49,149 --> 01:38:49,989
Uh, here.

2255
01:38:49,989 --> 01:38:50,829
Smoke stick me.

2256
01:38:50,829 --> 01:38:51,829
Oh shit, where'd it go?

2257
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,000
I saw it.

2258
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,600
It was big.

2259
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:58,439
Yeah.

2260
01:38:58,439 --> 01:38:59,760
Where's the lighter?

2261
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,680
It looked like a naked Slenderman.

2262
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,239
What does that mean?

2263
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,199
Um, it could mean nothing.

2264
01:39:06,199 --> 01:39:07,479
The lighter just disappeared.

2265
01:39:07,479 --> 01:39:08,319
That's bad.

2266
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:10,640
We need to go back to the truck, right now.

2267
01:39:12,329 --> 01:39:13,170
Run.

2268
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,149
I don't know if it.

2269
01:39:21,149 --> 01:39:21,989
What's wrong, you okay?

2270
01:39:21,989 --> 01:39:22,829
It's getting, I've got a three.

2271
01:39:22,829 --> 01:39:23,670
I've got a three.

2272
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:24,510
Oh, you got locked in there.

2273
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:25,470
You're in trouble, you're in trouble.

2274
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:26,310
I'm gonna.

2275
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:27,149
Yeah, okay, it got to a four.

2276
01:39:27,149 --> 01:39:28,229
It got to a four.

2277
01:39:28,229 --> 01:39:30,789
You good?

2278
01:39:30,789 --> 01:39:32,560
He's dead, he's dead.

2279
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,800
Okay, well, that's your problem.

2280
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,760
Let's just close that door.

2281
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:36,119
Okay, well, now let's.

2282
01:39:36,119 --> 01:39:37,880
All right, so what evidence do we have, Jerma?

2283
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:38,720
The evidence that we have,

2284
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,640
it was a thing on the ground

2285
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:43,039
that we lit the candles to summon it.

2286
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:44,399
So it's a summitable monster.

2287
01:39:44,439 --> 01:39:45,560
That's one piece of evidence.

2288
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:48,680
Second piece of evidence, I would say, strangulation.

2289
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,560
There's been two strangulations.

2290
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:56,140
Third piece of evidence, I would say, is the skin.

2291
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:58,340
They've got skin, and they like,

2292
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:00,420
I don't know, something about it.

2293
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:03,699
They looked like they're, they looked like naked.

2294
01:40:03,699 --> 01:40:05,140
Yeah, they were naked.

2295
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:09,350
So I saw EMF level, it only got to four.

2296
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:10,350
It never got to five.

2297
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:11,750
So that's not evidence.

2298
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:14,710
Fingerprints, well, I saw it had fingers,

2299
01:40:14,710 --> 01:40:19,310
so we can assume it might have fingerprints.

2300
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:20,149
Okay.

2301
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:25,189
Ghost writing, didn't stop to find out

2302
01:40:25,189 --> 01:40:26,630
if it could, if it was, you know.

2303
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:27,550
We didn't know.

2304
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:29,029
We could go run in there and look.

2305
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:30,229
You say EMF level five?

2306
01:40:31,659 --> 01:40:33,819
No, no, it only got to four.

2307
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:36,899
Freezing temperatures, I didn't have a thing.

2308
01:40:36,899 --> 01:40:38,659
Spirit box.

2309
01:40:38,659 --> 01:40:39,500
I don't know.

2310
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,260
I didn't, I had one, but I didn't use it.

2311
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:47,199
Uh, ah, shit.

2312
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:48,760
What does DOTS projector?

2313
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:56,409
Is that like capturing like spirit orbs or something?

2314
01:40:56,409 --> 01:40:58,199
Or is that separate? Probably.

2315
01:40:58,199 --> 01:41:00,079
No, spirit, ghost orbs are separate.

2316
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:03,789
How do we look for fingerprints?

2317
01:41:03,789 --> 01:41:05,359
What do we do?

2318
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:09,199
I think we have to put down like a powder or something.

2319
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:10,600
Oh, we need salt, right?

2320
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:13,500
We need to have it walk through salt.

2321
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,300
Should we try to do that?

2322
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:16,140
We could try.

2323
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:16,979
Okay, so how about this?

2324
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:21,579
Yeah, I'm going to go stand out in the middle of the house

2325
01:41:21,579 --> 01:41:23,100
and just pretend like, oh, I don't know.

2326
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:24,140
Well, where's my friends?

2327
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,659
And then like when it, when it's going to show up,

2328
01:41:25,659 --> 01:41:31,289
just put the salt down.

2329
01:41:31,289 --> 01:41:32,369
No, I was going to just be,

2330
01:41:32,369 --> 01:41:36,020
I was just going to bait the ghost out.

2331
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:36,859
It's right here.

2332
01:41:36,859 --> 01:41:37,699
It's right here.

2333
01:41:37,699 --> 01:41:38,539
It's here. It's here.

2334
01:41:38,539 --> 01:41:39,380
It's here.

2335
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:40,220
I think it's going to kill you.

2336
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:41,220
Yeah, it is.

2337
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,060
Yeah, I'm dead.

2338
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:42,899
Without a doubt.

2339
01:41:42,899 --> 01:41:45,060
It's literally, but I'm right in front of the door.

2340
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:47,020
Put the salt down right now.

2341
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:47,859
Ow.

2342
01:41:47,859 --> 01:41:56,670
Dude, it's like he had a can of bug spray.

2343
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:03,640
He looks, he had a can of bug spray, like a can of raid.

2344
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:04,680
Where is it?

2345
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:09,460
Shh.

2346
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:21,020
That was loud.

2347
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:22,140
Hey, what's up?

2348
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:23,420
That's a cat.

2349
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:25,460
Your ghost was on the camera for some reason.

2350
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:26,300
That was funny.

2351
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:28,220
Hey, will I be on the camera?

2352
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:29,300
Yeah, I think you will.

2353
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:30,140
Okay.

2354
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:30,979
Woo.

2355
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:32,140
There he is.

2356
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:32,979
Oh wow.

2357
01:42:32,979 --> 01:42:33,819
It's Vinny's ghost.

2358
01:42:33,819 --> 01:42:35,060
Sounds like Dodd.

2359
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:35,899
Here, hang on a sec.

2360
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:37,300
Quick floss.

2361
01:42:38,659 --> 01:42:40,699
That's got the letters of dog in there.

2362
01:42:44,109 --> 01:42:44,949
Yeah.

2363
01:42:44,949 --> 01:42:45,789
I'm just going to.

2364
01:42:45,789 --> 01:42:47,109
I have no idea what that,

2365
01:42:47,109 --> 01:42:48,949
and I don't know how to shake the salt either.

2366
01:42:48,949 --> 01:42:50,829
I don't know how to make the salt.

2367
01:42:50,829 --> 01:42:55,800
I think you just put it on the floor and then.

2368
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:57,119
That was so funny, dude.

2369
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:00,560
That was literally, you literally were crawling in.

2370
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,199
Like you had a can of bug spray in your hand.

2371
01:43:02,199 --> 01:43:03,279
It was so funny.

2372
01:43:13,149 --> 01:43:14,430
I was close though.

2373
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:16,640
We got money.

2374
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:17,479
I got $10.

2375
01:43:17,479 --> 01:43:18,319
We got 10 bucks.

2376
01:43:18,319 --> 01:43:19,159
That's all right.

2377
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,359
That's the most money I've got all night.

2378
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:22,359
Oh, 33.

2379
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:24,640
I got it.

2380
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,560
It's money.

2381
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,520
You got five bucks.

2382
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,350
Oh my goodness.

2383
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:34,229
Well, I mean, somebody in your chat Vinny mentioned

2384
01:43:34,229 --> 01:43:35,710
what were they expecting when they lit it.

2385
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:38,510
I was like, I don't know, something would happen.

2386
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:40,390
Some action maybe.

2387
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:42,710
I didn't think we were going to summon a demon

2388
01:43:42,710 --> 01:43:43,869
like immediately.

2389
01:43:43,869 --> 01:43:46,630
I thought maybe it would be subtle.

2390
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:47,869
I didn't think we were going to summon

2391
01:43:47,869 --> 01:43:51,189
like the fucking skinwalker right in front of us.

2392
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:55,600
That was, it was not prepared.

2393
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:56,960
Wait, there's bowling?

2394
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:57,800
Wait, what?

2395
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:01,390
Wait, does the bowling work?

2396
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:06,000
Oh, does this work?

2397
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:06,840
It does.

2398
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,279
We can, wait, this Jenga?

2399
01:44:09,399 --> 01:44:10,239
Oh shit.

2400
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:11,079
Oh, you've lost.

2401
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:13,560
Hold on, man.

2402
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:14,880
Jenga.

2403
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,960
Yeah, that was the move.

2404
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,319
You don't want to play Jenga,

2405
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:21,039
but you're going to just like humor us and.

2406
01:44:21,039 --> 01:44:22,319
Let's put it back together.

2407
01:44:23,439 --> 01:44:25,279
And you're going to be like, oh shit, I lost.

2408
01:44:25,279 --> 01:44:26,199
This will be the rest of the stream.

2409
01:44:26,199 --> 01:44:33,810
Putting back, putting back the tower here.

2410
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:34,649
Oh, I see.

2411
01:44:34,649 --> 01:44:36,529
Let me add some color to the town.

2412
01:44:36,529 --> 01:44:37,369
Oh my God.

2413
01:44:37,369 --> 01:44:41,039
What?

2414
01:44:41,039 --> 01:44:45,680
Oh, it's making like source engine sounds.

2415
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:49,479
Check this out.

2416
01:44:49,479 --> 01:44:50,319
Oh my God.

2417
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:53,579
That does sound like Gary's mod.

2418
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:55,020
Does this look weird?

2419
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:56,180
Oh, I got it.

2420
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:00,720
That you guys, you guys want to do another one

2421
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:02,680
or you guys think it's not enough time?

2422
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:04,479
Do one more.

2423
01:45:04,479 --> 01:45:07,350
We got to win.

2424
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:08,270
You can do this.

2425
01:45:08,470 --> 01:45:11,859
It's still fun though.

2426
01:45:11,859 --> 01:45:17,470
Do you guys see what's happening to the basketball?

2427
01:45:17,470 --> 01:45:18,710
It's.

2428
01:45:18,710 --> 01:45:22,029
I see it like hovering, jittering.

2429
01:45:29,729 --> 01:45:32,239
Oh, a ball.

2430
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:33,079
Does this work?

2431
01:45:34,119 --> 01:45:35,319
It's just a table.

2432
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:40,500
Hey, you dropped this.

2433
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:41,340
No.

2434
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:43,220
I'm just enamored with the source engine sounds

2435
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:44,060
over here on the table.

2436
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:44,979
Okay.

2437
01:45:44,979 --> 01:45:46,100
Yeah, we can do one more.

2438
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:51,119
Maybe we'll do like, oh geez.

2439
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:53,840
Hey, is there anything easier than that?

2440
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,960
Is there, is there another easy short one

2441
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:57,520
that's like not a house?

2442
01:46:00,319 --> 01:46:02,039
Like what's the one on the right there?

2443
01:46:02,039 --> 01:46:04,640
This one, the, all the way on the top right.

2444
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:05,600
Willow street?

2445
01:46:06,970 --> 01:46:07,970
Is that a house?

2446
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:09,369
It could be small.

2447
01:46:09,369 --> 01:46:11,569
What is this a times 18 times two things?

2448
01:46:11,569 --> 01:46:12,409
Is this how many floors there are?

2449
01:46:12,409 --> 01:46:13,250
How many rooms?

2450
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:14,210
Oh, it's how many, yeah.

2451
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:16,050
How many rooms are in each house?

2452
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:19,130
So we did just pick a small one, Willow street.

2453
01:46:19,130 --> 01:46:22,079
All right, let's do Willow street then.

2454
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:23,560
All right, one more.

2455
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,399
This would be definitely,

2456
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:29,000
that'll get that chat member to sub.

2457
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Oh yeah.

2458
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,920
Let me add more equipment here.

2459
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,560
How much money do you have in this game, Liam?

2460
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,800
$1,600.

2461
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:38,640
What?

2462
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:39,479
Okay, wow.

2463
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,840
You like this game, don't you?

2464
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:45,119
A little bit.

2465
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:46,880
I have $42.

2466
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:49,140
It's 17.

2467
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:50,539
Okay, I understand how the UI works.

2468
01:46:50,539 --> 01:46:52,300
I'm gonna add all this crap.

2469
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:56,909
We need a candle crucifix.

2470
01:46:56,909 --> 01:47:00,500
What's happening?

2471
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:08,170
Hey!

2472
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:09,010
Why are you in the ground?

2473
01:47:09,010 --> 01:47:10,479
Oh, there you go.

2474
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:17,359
I'm just sitting.

2475
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:20,159
Sorry, just finishing up adding all the equipment here.

2476
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:21,680
I hope I don't die because I'll lose all this,

2477
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:24,640
but what can you do?

2478
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:27,970
Am I a puddle?

2479
01:47:27,970 --> 01:47:29,689
No, you're like a,

2480
01:47:29,689 --> 01:47:30,529
It's very impressive what you're doing.

2481
01:47:30,529 --> 01:47:32,930
Guy running onto his feet while shitting, like you're.

2482
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:40,659
You know, it almost looks like you got

2483
01:47:40,659 --> 01:47:42,659
like a really baggy pair of pants

2484
01:47:42,659 --> 01:47:46,779
and push your arms and legs through both leg holes

2485
01:47:46,779 --> 01:47:48,739
and put it all the way up and are walking around

2486
01:47:48,739 --> 01:47:52,960
kind of with your arms and legs in each pant leg.

2487
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,800
I just spent $600.

2488
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:56,159
It's a very specific mental image.

2489
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:57,600
Goblin mode, someone wrote.

2490
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,199
Okay, wow, $600, you say?

2491
01:48:02,199 --> 01:48:04,000
Yeah, I added a bunch of equipment.

2492
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,039
Well, we're definitely gonna win this one.

2493
01:48:07,039 --> 01:48:08,800
There's no way we're not.

2494
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,439
Investing in success.

2495
01:48:10,439 --> 01:48:11,279
All right, let's do it.

2496
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:17,020
Here we go, everybody.

2497
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:21,289
All right.

2498
01:48:21,289 --> 01:48:23,859
Another campsite map.

2499
01:48:23,859 --> 01:48:25,100
Ooh.

2500
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:27,140
Let's get that sub, guys.

2501
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:28,260
What was the campsite?

2502
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:34,039
We need to get at least that one sub.

2503
01:48:34,039 --> 01:48:37,199
Yo, can we go back and do the campsite instead?

2504
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:39,479
Because people are saying that one's cool.

2505
01:48:39,479 --> 01:48:41,319
I remember it, kind of.

2506
01:48:41,319 --> 01:48:42,920
Oh, you wanna do that instead?

2507
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:44,720
Yeah, is it possible to abandon this

2508
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:45,560
and not lose the equipment?

2509
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:49,079
Yeah, we just guess immediately and then leave, right?

2510
01:48:49,079 --> 01:48:50,359
Yeah.

2511
01:48:50,359 --> 01:48:52,399
We won't lose any equipment,

2512
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:54,000
but I think we'll lose money.

2513
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,840
No, only if we die, so yeah.

2514
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,760
Yeah, that's fine, we'll just guess.

2515
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,000
The campsite sounds great.

2516
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:03,279
I think Jermal would like it, according to my chat.

2517
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:04,119
Oh yeah, let's do it.

2518
01:49:04,119 --> 01:49:05,720
I'm gonna guess, um,

2519
01:49:09,609 --> 01:49:15,090
Let's go for it.

2520
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:16,409
What's that called, chat?

2521
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,270
Okay.

2522
01:49:22,270 --> 01:49:23,350
Moroi, okay.

2523
01:49:24,430 --> 01:49:25,949
Woodwind, it's called.

2524
01:49:25,949 --> 01:49:27,189
Woodwind.

2525
01:49:27,189 --> 01:49:29,109
Camp Woodwind, I see it, okay.

2526
01:49:29,109 --> 01:49:31,670
Perfect, okay, it's a small campsite map.

2527
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:34,109
The other campsite I played years ago was too big,

2528
01:49:34,109 --> 01:49:36,970
so that's perfect, okay.

2529
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:38,289
All right, sorry, everyone.

2530
01:49:38,289 --> 01:49:39,770
This should be fun.

2531
01:49:39,770 --> 01:49:43,489
I'm gonna add some more equipment.

2532
01:49:43,489 --> 01:49:45,609
Yeah, we're fine, we got everything.

2533
01:49:45,609 --> 01:49:46,449
Okay.

2534
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:52,500
Do you think I could quickly squeeze a game of Jenga in, or?

2535
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:55,619
We can play Jenga and then watch a terrible movie afterwards.

2536
01:49:55,619 --> 01:49:57,699
Really cool to see Shifter Xeris become a streamer,

2537
01:49:57,699 --> 01:49:59,500
I loved you, thanks.

2538
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:08,420
Swarhas, Jerm, are you gonna write it yet?

2539
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:10,060
Oh wait, you did, sorry.

2540
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:18,510
I just did when you were saying it, so you were right.

2541
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:22,520
Is this just a campsite, huh?

2542
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:24,079
Glory, shell, and gold.

2543
01:50:24,079 --> 01:50:27,000
Do you remember Salute Your Shorts on Nickelodeon?

2544
01:50:28,119 --> 01:50:30,279
This'll be like that, like it'll be like camping

2545
01:50:30,279 --> 01:50:32,439
and Zeke the Plumber's gonna come after us.

2546
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,000
Okay, I got an EMF.

2547
01:50:39,579 --> 01:50:40,420
What is this thing?

2548
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:41,460
Okay, or I could throw it.

2549
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:44,220
What's this like, this knee pad, what is this?

2550
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:46,020
And just the crucifix, okay.

2551
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:48,380
So we don't need to do anything specific

2552
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:51,939
other than crucifix and EMF and not die, so.

2553
01:50:51,939 --> 01:50:53,340
This is for dots projector.

2554
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:54,180
Oh, okay.

2555
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:55,020
I can live, I can live.

2556
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:55,859
Can I take it?

2557
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:59,000
I'm gonna take this thing.

2558
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:03,119
Somebody else take the spirit box this time?

2559
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:05,840
I'll take the spirit box, where is it?

2560
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:06,680
Right here, next to the book.

2561
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:08,079
Is that the orange one, okay.

2562
01:51:09,579 --> 01:51:11,060
All right, cool.

2563
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:13,699
And then I'll take a glow stick.

2564
01:51:13,699 --> 01:51:15,020
Temperature thing here.

2565
01:51:17,979 --> 01:51:19,260
Why is there a camera already pointed

2566
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:20,500
at the back of the truck?

2567
01:51:23,529 --> 01:51:24,609
That's creepy.

2568
01:51:24,609 --> 01:51:25,449
Yeah, that's a little weird.

2569
01:51:25,449 --> 01:51:27,939
That's weird.

2570
01:51:28,819 --> 01:51:30,819
We don't need a salt or a stick or anything?

2571
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:34,279
No, we don't.

2572
01:51:34,279 --> 01:51:35,159
All right.

2573
01:51:35,159 --> 01:51:37,239
Just the crucifix and EMF for sure,

2574
01:51:37,239 --> 01:51:39,640
and then the rest we can discern as we go.

2575
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:41,390
Okay.

2576
01:51:41,390 --> 01:51:43,270
We should be okay this time, maybe.

2577
01:51:45,229 --> 01:51:46,550
I'm just gonna stop saying that.

2578
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:48,270
Camp Woodwind.

2579
01:51:54,029 --> 01:51:55,909
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

2580
01:51:55,909 --> 01:51:56,750
I don't know, I just, like,

2581
01:51:56,750 --> 01:51:57,989
you guys walked right in front of me.

2582
01:51:57,989 --> 01:51:59,510
I just thought you, it was like immediately,

2583
01:51:59,510 --> 01:52:00,670
I was getting attacked.

2584
01:52:04,939 --> 01:52:06,180
All right, I'll be okay.

2585
01:52:09,449 --> 01:52:10,569
For some reason, I just forgot

2586
01:52:10,569 --> 01:52:12,489
that you were right there somehow.

2587
01:52:12,489 --> 01:52:16,449
I knew you were there, but I don't know.

2588
01:52:16,449 --> 01:52:20,210
What am I looking for on the EMF?

2589
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:23,930
You are looking for level five or anything.

2590
01:52:23,930 --> 01:52:24,850
Level five as well.

2591
01:52:24,850 --> 01:52:25,729
Oh, the spirit box.

2592
01:52:25,729 --> 01:52:28,529
Oh, you're just listening for sound.

2593
01:52:28,529 --> 01:52:30,489
Like if it's the ghost talks.

2594
01:52:30,489 --> 01:52:31,890
Who's got the EMF then?

2595
01:52:31,890 --> 01:52:33,050
I have the dots thing.

2596
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:35,630
Where should I put the dots thing?

2597
01:52:35,630 --> 01:52:36,470
Does it matter?

2598
01:52:37,670 --> 01:52:38,510
Dots thing?

2599
01:52:38,510 --> 01:52:39,710
The dots projector?

2600
01:52:41,159 --> 01:52:42,000
Oh, I don't know.

2601
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:42,840
Does that mean?

2602
01:52:43,479 --> 01:52:44,800
What does this do?

2603
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,640
Wasn't in the hole.

2604
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:46,479
I have no idea.

2605
01:52:46,479 --> 01:52:48,399
There's a Ouija board.

2606
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:50,000
We can use that to talk to the ghost.

2607
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,239
Oh.

2608
01:52:51,239 --> 01:52:52,640
All right, let's do it.

2609
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:54,359
Okay, that's what that does.

2610
01:52:54,359 --> 01:52:55,960
Can I turn it off?

2611
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:56,800
Oh.

2612
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:57,960
What is that noise?

2613
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:58,800
Wait, was that?

2614
01:52:58,800 --> 01:52:59,619
It's level three.

2615
01:52:59,619 --> 01:53:00,460
I just got level three.

2616
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:01,300
Level three?

2617
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:02,119
By Jerma.

2618
01:53:02,119 --> 01:53:02,960
Ghosts, speak to us.

2619
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:03,960
Yo, that thing is moving on its own.

2620
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:04,800
That bottle is moving on its own.

2621
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,039
Yeah, that bottle is moving.

2622
01:53:06,039 --> 01:53:07,479
Which one?

2623
01:53:07,479 --> 01:53:09,000
Ghosts.

2624
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,479
It's just level three though, not level five.

2625
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:14,720
So we can roll that out, perhaps.

2626
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:15,840
Okay.

2627
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,239
No temperature change.

2628
01:53:17,239 --> 01:53:18,319
It's still like 13.

2629
01:53:18,319 --> 01:53:19,159
Not really.

2630
01:53:19,159 --> 01:53:24,579
It's going between like...

2631
01:53:24,579 --> 01:53:25,420
Okay.

2632
01:53:25,420 --> 01:53:26,840
I'm gonna set up a video camera.

2633
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:27,680
I'm gonna go back to the truck.

2634
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,060
I'll be right back.

2635
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:32,159
All right, good call.

2636
01:53:32,159 --> 01:53:36,199
Ghosts, what is your name?

2637
01:53:36,199 --> 01:53:39,710
Oh my God, they got hand-pined beans.

2638
01:53:39,710 --> 01:53:41,430
So what are we looking for with this?

2639
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:43,229
Kiwi beans?

2640
01:53:43,229 --> 01:53:44,590
Did you die in the toilet?

2641
01:53:45,189 --> 01:53:48,359
Uh, was this like an Xbox Kinect?

2642
01:53:48,359 --> 01:53:50,079
What does it do?

2643
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:52,199
I don't know.

2644
01:53:52,199 --> 01:53:53,880
It projects dots.

2645
01:53:55,149 --> 01:53:56,069
Okay.

2646
01:53:56,069 --> 01:53:57,829
Does that help us see ghosts or?

2647
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:03,760
What's that?

2648
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:05,039
I can't be good for your eyes.

2649
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:06,949
What's that?

2650
01:54:06,949 --> 01:54:07,789
What's that?

2651
01:54:07,789 --> 01:54:08,909
Is somebody out?

2652
01:54:08,909 --> 01:54:11,550
Are we all together or is somebody walking around

2653
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:12,390
back there?

2654
01:54:12,390 --> 01:54:14,220
Are we all together?

2655
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:15,060
I think we all are.

2656
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:16,899
Wait, did you guys turn the camera on?

2657
01:54:16,899 --> 01:54:17,739
Oh, are we all on the campfire?

2658
01:54:17,739 --> 01:54:18,579
Oh, the shower just turned on.

2659
01:54:18,779 --> 01:54:20,659
The shower just turned on on its own.

2660
01:54:20,659 --> 01:54:21,739
Did you guys see that?

2661
01:54:21,739 --> 01:54:23,340
What do you mean it turned on on its own?

2662
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:24,939
There's a shower?

2663
01:54:24,939 --> 01:54:27,340
Ghost, are you taking a shower?

2664
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:29,140
Ghost, what are you doing in there?

2665
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:30,100
Talk to us.

2666
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:30,939
Oh, there is a shower.

2667
01:54:30,939 --> 01:54:33,220
Wait, you get the dots thing.

2668
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:36,449
No.

2669
01:54:36,449 --> 01:54:41,260
I'm not weird, but I'm gonna set up a camera in the shower.

2670
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:46,020
Good thing you clarified that early.

2671
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:49,449
Okay.

2672
01:54:49,449 --> 01:54:51,010
Ghost, why don't you speak to me now

2673
01:54:51,010 --> 01:54:52,569
and tell me why you turned on the shower?

2674
01:54:52,569 --> 01:54:56,090
Can you shower in the afterlife?

2675
01:54:56,130 --> 01:54:57,649
Oh, okay.

2676
01:54:57,649 --> 01:54:58,489
There we go.

2677
01:54:58,489 --> 01:55:03,789
Why is it not on when I put it down?

2678
01:55:03,789 --> 01:55:09,600
You wanna turn it so it's facing the hot ghost action?

2679
01:55:10,119 --> 01:55:12,750
Yeah.

2680
01:55:12,750 --> 01:55:15,770
Ghost, what was that?

2681
01:55:15,770 --> 01:55:18,720
What's that?

2682
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:20,760
I hear crunching.

2683
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:25,539
That could be us just walking, perhaps?

2684
01:55:25,539 --> 01:55:28,020
Maybe the ghost is eating Cheerios, I don't know.

2685
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:29,460
What's that then?

2686
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:36,880
Oh, okay.

2687
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:46,319
You said maybe.

2688
01:55:46,319 --> 01:55:50,479
That's right, it's weird that your name is Liam, you know?

2689
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:51,520
Yeah, that's weird.

2690
01:55:52,439 --> 01:55:55,810
Can we turn the, can we light the fire?

2691
01:55:55,810 --> 01:55:58,210
We start the campfire or no?

2692
01:55:58,210 --> 01:56:00,409
Because when we did our interview,

2693
01:56:00,409 --> 01:56:02,010
like we talked about Liam Gallagher

2694
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:04,470
for like 10 minutes for no reason.

2695
01:56:04,470 --> 01:56:08,079
Well, no, because your name is Liam, like, you know?

2696
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:10,979
Oh yeah, right, yeah, I remember that, yeah.

2697
01:56:10,979 --> 01:56:12,829
So I am Liam Gallagher.

2698
01:56:12,829 --> 01:56:15,949
But you're also gonna be in The Witcher, so.

2699
01:56:15,949 --> 01:56:17,189
Yeah, that's right, yeah, I am.

2700
01:56:17,189 --> 01:56:19,470
I just got the call from Netflix.

2701
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:21,430
Netflix is telling you they wanna chill.

2702
01:56:22,430 --> 01:56:26,800
It's not a time to be messing around and making jokes.

2703
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:28,279
There's a ghost here.

2704
01:56:35,279 --> 01:56:36,119
Ghosts.

2705
01:56:36,119 --> 01:56:38,319
Wait, it's minus seven, it's minus seven, right?

2706
01:56:38,319 --> 01:56:39,640
It's minus 11. Oh, perfect, okay.

2707
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:41,319
I'm gonna write it down, freezing temperatures.

2708
01:56:41,319 --> 01:56:42,760
Freezing temperatures.

2709
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:43,880
Freezing temperatures for sure.

2710
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:45,239
Ghosts, freezing temperatures.

2711
01:56:45,239 --> 01:56:46,079
Speak to us.

2712
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:51,300
Does anybody have a UV light or the journal?

2713
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:53,069
I got one over here.

2714
01:56:53,069 --> 01:56:53,989
Journal?

2715
01:56:53,989 --> 01:56:54,829
A UV light.

2716
01:56:54,829 --> 01:56:56,069
I had a UV light, I put it down.

2717
01:56:56,069 --> 01:56:58,510
If you have a journal, put it in the shower.

2718
01:56:59,390 --> 01:57:01,590
That's the first time anyone has said that sentence.

2719
01:57:01,590 --> 01:57:04,189
What do you wanna do with the UV light?

2720
01:57:04,189 --> 01:57:06,640
Just look for fingerprints.

2721
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:07,720
Oh. I don't see any though.

2722
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:08,560
I just threw it into the.

2723
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:09,800
Yeah, like, don't do that.

2724
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:14,039
That's a glow stick, actually.

2725
01:57:14,039 --> 01:57:14,880
Will it show?

2726
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:18,399
Yeah, on the walls, if you look around.

2727
01:57:18,399 --> 01:57:19,399
I'm pretty sure, I don't know

2728
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:20,960
if the glow stick reveals fingerprints.

2729
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:22,640
I'm pretty sure the UV light does that.

2730
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:23,479
No.

2731
01:57:26,159 --> 01:57:28,000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, colds.

2732
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,960
I had cold breath right over there.

2733
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:30,800
Cold breath.

2734
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:32,520
Right there?

2735
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:33,359
Okay, that's where the ghost is.

2736
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:37,640
It's not the shower.

2737
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:39,560
Ghost is here somewhere.

2738
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:40,399
What's that?

2739
01:57:44,359 --> 01:57:45,520
I dropped the temperature gun

2740
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:48,880
because I figured we don't really need it.

2741
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:50,800
Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

2742
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:51,640
I'll be right back.

2743
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:53,279
I'm gonna go get some more evidence.

2744
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:54,640
Ghost, can you speak?

2745
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:57,720
I'm trying to communicate with you.

2746
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:58,560
Please, tell me.

2747
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:02,000
I'm just trying to get the black light in the shower.

2748
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,840
Ghost, who do you think I am?

2749
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:07,520
We can rule out the shower.

2750
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:08,359
I got a book.

2751
01:58:08,359 --> 01:58:11,399
Do you want me to throw it out of the book anywhere?

2752
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:12,479
I got the dots.

2753
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,760
Move the dots.

2754
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:18,430
All right, I'm gonna put the dots over here.

2755
01:58:18,430 --> 01:58:21,439
There should be a camera on the truck pod.

2756
01:58:21,439 --> 01:58:29,760
Ghost, how do you feel about the Brighter Chief?

2757
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,680
Sorry, I was in my own world for a second.

2758
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,359
What was your question?

2759
01:58:34,399 --> 01:58:36,229
How do you open the book?

2760
01:58:36,229 --> 01:58:39,670
Oh, you have to press F on a surface.

2761
01:58:39,670 --> 01:58:56,899
First I can tell, no ghost.

2762
01:58:56,899 --> 01:58:59,880
So should I get rid of the DOS projector?

2763
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:01,680
No, I think we can leave it there.

2764
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:04,159
I don't think I'll scare the ghost off.

2765
01:59:04,199 --> 01:59:12,000
You can go back to the truck and see if we see anything.

2766
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,479
Oh, hey, Dapper Chief.

2767
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:19,359
So it's either a demon, a Moroi, or the Mimic.

2768
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:21,840
You know what, Vinny, I do too.

2769
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:22,800
It's just gross.

2770
01:59:24,590 --> 01:59:28,189
Wait, wait, so you said it could be four things?

2771
01:59:30,119 --> 01:59:30,960
What do we need?

2772
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,520
So it's four things?

2773
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:35,520
It's either the demon, the Moroi, or the Mimic.

2774
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:38,319
Why don't we all just pick a different one

2775
01:59:38,319 --> 01:59:41,640
and then we'll at least get a partial win.

2776
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:42,960
Listen, I need that sub.

2777
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:45,680
That's true.

2778
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:49,600
So what, okay, so what do those four ghosts do

2779
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:53,220
that we should be looking for?

2780
01:59:53,220 --> 01:59:54,460
They make some kind of sound?

2781
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:57,180
Do they make some kind of noise?

2782
01:59:57,180 --> 02:00:01,640
Do they leave fingerprints or?

2783
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:02,720
Throw a football.

2784
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:08,310
So what did you say it could be?

2785
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:11,229
It's either a demon, Moroi, or the Mimic.

2786
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:14,260
All right, so we're looking for ghost writing.

2787
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:17,340
Did we get any spirit box readings at all?

2788
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:21,359
Like did it say anything to you, Vinny?

2789
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:23,680
No, it doesn't want to talk to me.

2790
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:26,800
Okay, did we have a UV light?

2791
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,680
Yeah, we need to find fingerprints.

2792
02:00:29,939 --> 02:00:32,819
We can rule out two of these if we rule out fingerprints.

2793
02:00:32,819 --> 02:00:34,020
Wait, did you turn on the generator?

2794
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:35,539
The generator just turned on.

2795
02:00:35,539 --> 02:00:37,520
That was Vinny, I think.

2796
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:40,319
Okay, Vinny, turn it off.

2797
02:00:40,319 --> 02:00:42,560
Yeah, that was not.

2798
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:46,909
Who's did?

2799
02:00:46,909 --> 02:00:47,750
What?

2800
02:00:48,590 --> 02:00:49,869
How?

2801
02:00:49,869 --> 02:00:51,069
How did that happen?

2802
02:00:53,479 --> 02:00:55,560
Honestly, like which one of you two did that?

2803
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:57,680
Because there was no ghost.

2804
02:00:58,640 --> 02:00:59,840
I was further away.

2805
02:01:02,619 --> 02:01:05,340
Oh my God.

2806
02:01:05,340 --> 02:01:08,640
Whoa, Gumby.

2807
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:10,399
Holy shit.

2808
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:16,539
Why did you kill our friend Ross and my framerates?

2809
02:01:16,539 --> 02:01:19,949
All right, well that was.

2810
02:01:19,949 --> 02:01:21,989
Okay, the DOS protector's down too, right?

2811
02:01:21,989 --> 02:01:22,829
Nothing?

2812
02:01:22,829 --> 02:01:23,670
It's right here.

2813
02:01:23,670 --> 02:01:25,670
What are we looking for in the DOS protector?

2814
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:27,229
We need to find fingerprints.

2815
02:01:27,229 --> 02:01:29,149
I put a crucifix and I dropped it, I think.

2816
02:01:29,149 --> 02:01:30,869
Where's the UV light?

2817
02:01:30,869 --> 02:01:31,710
I got a crucifix.

2818
02:01:31,710 --> 02:01:35,510
Oh, I don't think we have a UV light.

2819
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:37,310
We don't have a UV light.

2820
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:38,149
I thought we did.

2821
02:01:38,149 --> 02:01:38,989
Ghosts speak to us.

2822
02:01:38,989 --> 02:01:39,829
What is your name?

2823
02:01:39,829 --> 02:01:40,710
Can the glow stick look for fingerprints too

2824
02:01:40,710 --> 02:01:42,229
or am I totally wrong?

2825
02:01:42,229 --> 02:01:44,350
That's what we were trying to figure out.

2826
02:01:44,350 --> 02:01:47,829
Yeah, I figured you could only, I don't know.

2827
02:01:50,670 --> 02:01:56,039
Well, I think we might have to leave the chance.

2828
02:01:56,119 --> 02:02:00,199
Hey, this process, this looks like it.

2829
02:02:00,199 --> 02:02:01,039
Oh, they just.

2830
02:02:01,039 --> 02:02:01,880
Yeah, they.

2831
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:02,720
Oh, yeah, it's.

2832
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:03,560
Oh.

2833
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:05,279
Hello?

2834
02:02:05,279 --> 02:02:06,520
Ghosts die.

2835
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:08,890
So it looks like we got it.

2836
02:02:08,890 --> 02:02:10,810
Yeah, I just dropped the crucifix

2837
02:02:10,810 --> 02:02:11,649
and it's gone.

2838
02:02:11,649 --> 02:02:14,000
We should go to the truck, truck.

2839
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,319
Before anybody else dies.

2840
02:02:15,319 --> 02:02:16,159
Yeah.

2841
02:02:16,159 --> 02:02:17,000
They're weird noise.

2842
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:17,840
They closed the gate.

2843
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:19,439
Oh, the gate's closed.

2844
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:20,279
Well.

2845
02:02:20,279 --> 02:02:21,119
Just jump it, man.

2846
02:02:21,119 --> 02:02:24,159
Can we not help him?

2847
02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:25,000
It's here, it's here.

2848
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:25,840
There it is.

2849
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:26,880
There it is, I think.

2850
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:27,720
There it is, it's on the ground.

2851
02:02:28,079 --> 02:02:29,039
It's crawling on the ground.

2852
02:02:29,039 --> 02:02:30,359
It's crawling on the ground.

2853
02:02:30,359 --> 02:02:31,680
It's crawling on the ground.

2854
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:32,520
It's got me.

2855
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:45,119
Jesus, it's so loud and I turned it down.

2856
02:02:45,119 --> 02:02:45,960
Man.

2857
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:47,300
What's up?

2858
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:50,300
It crawls on the ground.

2859
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:52,579
Yeah, it crawls on the ground like a little goblin

2860
02:02:52,579 --> 02:02:53,789
and then chokes.

2861
02:02:53,789 --> 02:02:54,909
I'm a member of your team escape.

2862
02:02:54,909 --> 02:02:56,710
No one has escaped.

2863
02:02:56,710 --> 02:02:57,949
We're at zero sanity.

2864
02:02:57,949 --> 02:02:58,789
All right.

2865
02:03:03,380 --> 02:03:04,939
People saying, hey, why didn't you do anything?

2866
02:03:04,939 --> 02:03:07,659
The ghost was attacking and you didn't do anything

2867
02:03:07,659 --> 02:03:08,819
and I'm sitting there just trying to,

2868
02:03:08,819 --> 02:03:11,100
I'm just trying to give info, right?

2869
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:12,220
I know I'm dead.

2870
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:14,460
So I'm sitting there going like crawling on the ground,

2871
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:16,260
looks like it's a demon and I'm dead,

2872
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:19,729
but they have that info.

2873
02:03:19,729 --> 02:03:23,250
My job is to make sure they get that info.

2874
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:25,130
So we got freezing temperatures, right?

2875
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:28,449
Is that a, we definitely got freezing temperature?

2876
02:03:28,449 --> 02:03:30,409
We got EMF level five or no?

2877
02:03:30,409 --> 02:03:31,880
No.

2878
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:34,560
Basically, I ruled out ghost orbs and EMF level five

2879
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:35,399
because I didn't see.

2880
02:03:35,399 --> 02:03:36,319
I think it's a demon.

2881
02:03:36,319 --> 02:03:38,439
Well, first of all, it wouldn't go beyond three

2882
02:03:38,479 --> 02:03:42,079
and the ghost orbs just aren't showing up on the monitor.

2883
02:03:42,079 --> 02:03:43,720
We just didn't do anything, for instance.

2884
02:03:43,720 --> 02:03:45,239
I don't know how to look for stuff

2885
02:03:45,239 --> 02:03:46,640
in the dots projector though.

2886
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:48,079
Yeah, I didn't see anything.

2887
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:55,579
Chat, did you see any?

2888
02:03:55,579 --> 02:03:56,420
You're winning, son.

2889
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:58,659
You gave them the info.

2890
02:03:58,659 --> 02:03:59,819
Yeah.

2891
02:03:59,819 --> 02:04:02,439
If you click twice.

2892
02:04:02,439 --> 02:04:03,880
So no spirit box either.

2893
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:06,010
Oh, it's the demon.

2894
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:07,489
Does that look like?

2895
02:04:07,489 --> 02:04:08,329
I'd say demon too.

2896
02:04:08,329 --> 02:04:09,170
Yeah, I just ruled out,

2897
02:04:09,170 --> 02:04:11,329
after ruling out three of the types of evidence,

2898
02:04:11,369 --> 02:04:13,449
it just gave me the demon as one of the possible answers.

2899
02:04:13,449 --> 02:04:14,369
Let me see the demon.

2900
02:04:14,369 --> 02:04:16,369
Demons are aggressive.

2901
02:04:16,369 --> 02:04:17,449
Going to attack without reason.

2902
02:04:17,449 --> 02:04:18,289
This is very aggressive.

2903
02:04:18,289 --> 02:04:19,210
They enjoy the thrill of the hunts.

2904
02:04:19,210 --> 02:04:21,050
They initiate hunts more often.

2905
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:22,609
Demons fear the crucifix

2906
02:04:22,609 --> 02:04:24,010
and will be less aggressive than you're one.

2907
02:04:24,010 --> 02:04:25,250
So that makes sense.

2908
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:27,449
Yeah, it did blow it up.

2909
02:04:27,449 --> 02:04:28,609
It would have been fingerprints,

2910
02:04:28,609 --> 02:04:30,409
ghost writing, and freezing temperatures.

2911
02:04:30,409 --> 02:04:33,170
So I guess if we found.

2912
02:04:33,170 --> 02:04:34,409
Did we not bring a book

2913
02:04:34,409 --> 02:04:36,409
or did we place it somewhere else?

2914
02:04:36,409 --> 02:04:37,250
I don't know.

2915
02:04:37,250 --> 02:04:38,090
The only thing we could do now.

2916
02:04:38,090 --> 02:04:39,930
We had a book.

2917
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:41,090
Oh, shit.

2918
02:04:41,090 --> 02:04:42,409
The light, I don't think.

2919
02:04:42,409 --> 02:04:43,250
We do.

2920
02:04:43,250 --> 02:04:44,170
It's the thing.

2921
02:04:44,170 --> 02:04:45,010
Do we have any pills?

2922
02:04:45,010 --> 02:04:45,850
No.

2923
02:04:45,850 --> 02:04:46,689
Oh, fuck.

2924
02:04:46,689 --> 02:04:47,529
No.

2925
02:04:47,529 --> 02:04:48,369
I think it's on the ground somewhere.

2926
02:04:48,369 --> 02:04:49,210
Either of us going back out.

2927
02:04:49,210 --> 02:04:50,409
I'm going to guess.

2928
02:04:50,409 --> 02:04:51,250
I think it's demon.

2929
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:52,090
Fuck it.

2930
02:04:52,090 --> 02:04:52,930
I'm going to guess demon.

2931
02:04:52,930 --> 02:04:53,770
Yeah.

2932
02:04:53,770 --> 02:04:54,609
Yeah, I'm going to guess demon

2933
02:04:54,609 --> 02:04:56,289
based on what I've ruled out here.

2934
02:04:56,289 --> 02:04:57,130
All right.

2935
02:04:57,130 --> 02:04:57,970
We did get some objective.

2936
02:04:57,970 --> 02:05:00,649
That was actually kind of successful.

2937
02:05:00,649 --> 02:05:01,489
For what it was.

2938
02:05:01,489 --> 02:05:02,329
It's getting money.

2939
02:05:02,329 --> 02:05:03,170
Even though two people died.

2940
02:05:03,170 --> 02:05:04,609
I'm so sorry you're in the wrong.

2941
02:05:04,609 --> 02:05:05,449
It's all right.

2942
02:05:05,449 --> 02:05:07,489
We got this, I think.

2943
02:05:07,489 --> 02:05:08,329
I think we still win.

2944
02:05:08,329 --> 02:05:10,010
I can taste that sub.

2945
02:05:10,010 --> 02:05:10,850
That's a win.

2946
02:05:13,949 --> 02:05:19,520
Is it?

2947
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:20,680
Fuck, it was a shade.

2948
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:22,000
What?

2949
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,800
Oh.

2950
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:25,279
EMF.

2951
02:05:25,279 --> 02:05:26,119
I think it was a shade.

2952
02:05:26,119 --> 02:05:27,350
I think it was crawling on the ground.

2953
02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:31,800
It was none of the things that I, it was.

2954
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:32,640
But I love it.

2955
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:33,880
All right.

2956
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:34,680
Well.

2957
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:35,680
No sub.

2958
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:41,140
Shit.

2959
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:41,979
Damn.

2960
02:05:41,979 --> 02:05:42,819
All right.

2961
02:05:42,819 --> 02:05:44,409
Shade, okay.

2962
02:05:44,409 --> 02:05:45,250
Once you start getting the hang of this,

2963
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:46,569
this game is pretty interesting.

2964
02:05:46,569 --> 02:05:48,050
It's pretty fun.

2965
02:05:48,050 --> 02:05:48,890
Yeah.

2966
02:05:48,890 --> 02:05:49,729
You've got the hang of it.

2967
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:51,289
Cool.

2968
02:05:51,289 --> 02:05:53,489
Oh, let me make this more accurate to Gmod.

2969
02:05:53,489 --> 02:06:00,270
Hold on.

2970
02:06:00,270 --> 02:06:04,329
I hope that sounds good.

2971
02:06:04,329 --> 02:06:05,170
Cool.

2972
02:06:05,170 --> 02:06:06,010
I'm killing it.

2973
02:06:06,010 --> 02:06:07,170
Did you guys see the ghost out here?

2974
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:10,409
Did you guys see the thing that's, you know,

2975
02:06:10,409 --> 02:06:13,810
staring at us through the window?

2976
02:06:13,810 --> 02:06:14,930
Oh, I do.

2977
02:06:14,930 --> 02:06:15,770
Mm-hmm.

2978
02:06:15,770 --> 02:06:18,409
It's like looking like the Mario Galaxy 2

2979
02:06:18,409 --> 02:06:20,329
Hell Valley Sky Tree thing.

2980
02:06:20,329 --> 02:06:21,890
Fuck's sake.

2981
02:06:21,890 --> 02:06:23,090
That was very specific.

2982
02:06:24,430 --> 02:06:25,430
Yeah.

2983
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:27,069
He knows his Mario.

2984
02:06:27,069 --> 02:06:30,500
You're in the, oh, you're in the table.

2985
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:33,149
You are.

2986
02:06:33,149 --> 02:06:35,510
I was more in the table, but yeah,

2987
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:38,750
these, in VR, you can pull the basketballs

2988
02:06:38,750 --> 02:06:41,869
through the table and they glitch really nicely.

2989
02:06:41,869 --> 02:06:43,590
I love how it's really nicely.

2990
02:06:44,470 --> 02:06:45,590
Yeah.

2991
02:06:45,590 --> 02:06:46,750
Oh, it's such a nice one.

2992
02:06:46,750 --> 02:06:49,390
I made a career on very nice glitches.

2993
02:06:49,390 --> 02:06:50,229
That's true.

2994
02:06:51,109 --> 02:06:51,949
So.

2995
02:06:53,109 --> 02:06:53,949
It's like, oh.

2996
02:06:53,949 --> 02:06:54,789
Oh.

2997
02:06:54,789 --> 02:06:57,789
Yeah.

2998
02:06:57,789 --> 02:07:01,840
Yo, I spent hours stomping Koopas.

2999
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:04,199
Someone said Koopas.

3000
02:07:04,199 --> 02:07:07,319
Someone said they gave me a participation sub.

3001
02:07:07,319 --> 02:07:09,279
Chat members, I didn't actually need the subs.

3002
02:07:09,279 --> 02:07:10,439
I'm fine.

3003
02:07:10,439 --> 02:07:11,279
But thank you.

3004
02:07:11,279 --> 02:07:13,729
That's very kind of you.

3005
02:07:13,729 --> 02:07:14,609
All right.

3006
02:07:14,609 --> 02:07:16,810
Well, here, I'll stand up for this one.

3007
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:19,460
Who is this? Stand up.

3008
02:07:19,460 --> 02:07:20,300
Is this Jerma?

3009
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:22,050
That's me. Oh, hey, Jerma.

3010
02:07:22,050 --> 02:07:23,409
Jerma, thank you for agreeing to this.

3011
02:07:23,409 --> 02:07:24,250
This was a lot of fun.

3012
02:07:24,250 --> 02:07:25,449
Good Halloween spooks.

3013
02:07:25,449 --> 02:07:26,729
Yeah.

3014
02:07:26,729 --> 02:07:28,609
Yeah, it's always a fun time.

3015
02:07:28,609 --> 02:07:30,390
I like playing games. It is.

3016
02:07:30,390 --> 02:07:31,630
You're very close to comfort there.

3017
02:07:31,630 --> 02:07:33,229
I don't, I have no idea what the hell I'm doing,

3018
02:07:33,229 --> 02:07:35,880
but it's fun to walk around and get scared of stuff.

3019
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:38,680
But we can, maybe we can be squids one day.

3020
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:39,520
I don't know.

3021
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,920
We should definitely be squids.

3022
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:42,680
I 100% agree.

3023
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:43,880
Okay.

3024
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:44,720
Cool.

3025
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:47,039

3026
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:47,880
Yeah.

3027
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:48,720
Yeah, if you guys want to,

3028
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:51,140
if all of you want to play squids one day.

3029
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:52,979
Yeah, I'd be down for squids.

3030
02:07:52,979 --> 02:07:56,500
Liam, do you play, you played squids together?

3031
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:58,020
Yeah.

3032
02:07:58,020 --> 02:07:59,500
Oh yeah, I just had a random match

3033
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:02,420
during the Splatfest or whatever.

3034
02:08:02,420 --> 02:08:06,829
So, but yeah, also for the new video, as always.

3035
02:08:06,829 --> 02:08:08,170
Sorry?

3036
02:08:09,010 --> 02:08:10,220
What did you say?

3037
02:08:10,220 --> 02:08:11,260
Good video.

3038
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:12,739
Oh, thank you.

3039
02:08:12,739 --> 02:08:13,899
Sorry, I thought you said it was mid.

3040
02:08:13,899 --> 02:08:14,739
I was like.

3041
02:08:14,739 --> 02:08:15,579
No, no, no, good.

3042
02:08:15,579 --> 02:08:17,300
No, no, I didn't say mid.

3043
02:08:17,300 --> 02:08:20,180
I said you were mid dunk because you had your arm up

3044
02:08:20,180 --> 02:08:21,659
and you were like in a mid dunk with the ball.

3045
02:08:21,659 --> 02:08:24,250
Oh yeah.

3046
02:08:24,250 --> 02:08:27,170
And Ross, where's Ross?

3047
02:08:27,170 --> 02:08:29,909
Yeah, the one with the basketball.

3048
02:08:29,909 --> 02:08:34,390
Now Ross is doing, yeah, I'll take that.

3049
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:37,149
Ross is doing a series of things with Minecraft

3050
02:08:37,149 --> 02:08:37,989

3051
02:08:37,989 --> 02:08:38,829
Oh God.

3052
02:08:38,949 --> 02:08:40,590
Is that what's called SMP?

3053
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:42,270
Yeah.

3054
02:08:42,270 --> 02:08:44,149
I might be in there at some point, chat.

3055
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:45,909

02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:05,180
It was a fun time, guys.

3071
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:06,000

3072
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:06,840
Goodbye, everybody.

3073
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:08,340
Goodbye.

3074
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:12,479
All right, chat, you got me for a couple more minutes.

3075
02:09:12,479 --> 02:09:15,899
Okay, so let me do this.

3076
02:09:15,899 --> 02:09:18,260
Okay, that was fun.

3077
02:09:18,260 --> 02:09:21,460
That was actually pretty scary.

3078
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:22,899
Welcome back.

3079
02:09:22,899 --> 02:09:24,979
I am going to move from that.

3080
02:09:24,979 --> 02:09:29,260
We are going to open at Dead of Night,

3081
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:31,380
which is a like FMV horror game.

3082
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:33,539
I don't know, I've heard it's fucking horrible though.

3083
02:09:33,539 --> 02:09:35,159
I heard it's terrifying.

3084
02:09:35,159 --> 02:09:36,000
I'll be right back.

3085
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,239
I'm gonna pee, I'm gonna get a drink

3086
02:09:39,239 --> 02:09:41,199
and I'll be back in literally two, three minutes.

3087
02:09:41,199 --> 02:09:42,039
Be right back.
