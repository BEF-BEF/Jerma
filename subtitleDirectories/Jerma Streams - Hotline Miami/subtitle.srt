1
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:12,970
How you guys doing? We're nice. Great night. See you tomorrow.

2
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,190
Are you okay? Are you okay?

3
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,739
Alright, see you later.

4
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,550
Welcome to another stream, guys.

5
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,500
How you doing?

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,659
I did just brush my teeth.

7
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,659
They're nice and clean.

8
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:44,170
Can you hear it?

9
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,469
I'm running my tongue across the front of my teeth.

10
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:59,950
So tonight, we're gonna play Hotline Miami.

11
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,380
Because I know I'm kind of...

12
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,379
I'm kind of jebaiting everybody here.

13
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,519
Last night, I said tonight we're gonna play EDF.

14
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,760
But that was determined to be a lie.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,060
Well, not a lie, but...

16
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,310
I wanted to play Me, Star, and Italics are gonna play it.

17
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,549
But we couldn't...

18
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,549
People had to get this stuff ready.

19
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:31,239
And we weren't all on the same page for today.

20
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:36,799
So tomorrow, we're gonna play it tomorrow.

21
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,840
So stream tonight, stream tomorrow.

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,340
So Star needed to set up some of his stuff.

23
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,340
He wasn't really ready to play it.

24
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,959
And we're gonna wait until tomorrow.

25
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,959
Because I obviously want to play with friends.

26
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:59,450
And the game is way more enjoyable that way.

27
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,450
So we're gonna play Hotline Miami tonight.

28
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:09,020
Somebody just wrote, this is gonna be very bad.

29
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,159
Why? Very bad?

30
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:15,159
Is that true? Yeah.

31
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,449
But why though?

32
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:22,449
Should I prepare myself for something that I'm not gonna have fun with?

33
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:29,740
Yes.

34
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:36,210
It's a very hard game.

35
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,280
Well, whatever. We'll be fine.

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,840
I'm not concerned about game difficulty.

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,419
You guys have seen me play plenty of games that require skill and focus.

38
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,419
And I just run them over with a lawnmower.

39
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:57,710
It might be jagged.

40
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:02,460
When the baseball comes shooting out of the lawnmower, it's gonna be torn up and all fucked up.

41
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:13,150
But at least I did it.

42
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,150
And no, somebody said, am I gonna do a face cam tonight?

43
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,030
Because I'm brushing my teeth.

44
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,460
No, I don't have any clothes on.

45
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,460
Everybody thinks this is a joke.

46
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,460
And thinks I'm making this up.

47
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,460
I don't have clothes on.

48
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,469
I have underwear and pants.

49
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:34,800
I mean, that's clothes. That's it.

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,099
No, I can't wear clothes.

51
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,099
I only wear clothes when I have to go out somewhere.

52
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:41,099
I don't have to leave the house.

53
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:51,189
It is an absolute nuisance for me to wear clothing.

54
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,430
Oh yeah, prove it. Sure. Let me turn it on.

55
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,430
No, I don't wear shirts.

56
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,430
I only wear shirts because I sweat through everything I put on.

57
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,060
So if I put on a t-shirt, oh yeah, I'm gonna do laundry.

58
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,060
Nice, fresh, clean laundry.

59
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,009
And I put on a shirt and in two hours, three hours, it'll be wet.

60
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:13,009
And it's not gross.

61
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:17,459
It's not gross or anything. I don't understand.

62
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,459
If I go out with that same shirt on, right?

63
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,459
If I put that same t-shirt on and go out of the house,

64
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:26,459
I will not sweat a single drop.

65
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:28,459
Not one drop will come out.

66
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:30,459
I'll be dry all day, all night.

67
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:35,660
I sit in a chair and just sweat comes off my body.

68
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:42,579
I don't understand why.

69
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:52,730
Does anybody have a logical medical explanation as to why that happens?

70
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,730
And I'm not like smelly or anything. I'm just wet.

71
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,730
It's like somebody threw water,

72
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,350
and a basin and like under my armpits.

73
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,879
It's just liquid.

74
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,180
But anyways, we're gonna play Hotline Miami tonight.

75
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,870
I've heard it's a very hard game from people in the chat room here.

76
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,870
It's a very hard game.

77
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,180
So everybody be careful with it.

78
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,180
It might be a little loud. I'm just making you aware of that.

79
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,699
Stalling. I'm not stalling.

80
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,180
I'm just talking.

81
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,180
It's been six minutes.

82
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,949
I'm at the title screen. I'm just gonna make sure it gets captured correctly.

83
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:46,970
Because if it doesn't, then I'm gonna be really, really, really, really, really, really angry.

84
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,100
There it is. Okay, Hotline Miami.

85
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,810
And it should pop up on the screen literally right now.

86
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,240
Hey, there it is.

87
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
So I have not played this game before.

88
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,990
I don't know how this works.

89
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,990
I know it's a top-down...

90
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,360
That almost looks to me like original GTA.

91
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,730
The same kind of top-down, right?

92
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,730
And the same animations when you punch people.

93
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:24,259
Did I tweet this? Okay, I did.

94
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,259
All right.

95
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,339
The music's incredible. I've heard it's really fun.

96
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:31,339
I'm playing keyboard and mouse. Please correct me if that's wrong.

97
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:37,709
Should I be playing with like an Xbox controller?

98
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:43,240
Okay.

99
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,569
So Hotline Miami. Here we go.

100
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:49,259
I'm here to tell you how to kill people.

101
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:55,329
This game is controlled with your WASD keys and mouse.

102
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:58,329
Press left mouse button to punch, aim for the face.

103
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:01,329
Once you've knocked someone out, you have to finish them.

104
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:04,329
To do this, you press space. You got it? Are you sure?

105
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,329
Left mouse button to punch, space to finish.

106
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:10,360
Do you understand me? Don't mess it up.

107
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Okay, so I'm...

108
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,329
All right, I'm Pinocchio.

109
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:16,329
So...

110
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:21,699
All right, now you should try killing the next guy.

111
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:24,699
But use the bat in the red room over here, okay?

112
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,699
This game's too hard. I can already tell.

113
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,889
I can already tell this game's too hard.

114
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:37,139
When you press the left mouse button to swing it.

115
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,139
Okay, did that get through your head?

116
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:40,139
So right click and then left click.

117
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,420
All right, right click.

118
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,110
And then...

119
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,480
Oh man, this is fun, but it's gonna be very hard for me.

120
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,189
Well done, so let's get to the gun, shall we?

121
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:58,430
You go and get the shotgun in the blue room.

122
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,250
You do it the same way you picked up the bat.

123
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,550
Just press the right mouse button. Can you handle that?

124
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,550
Use the shift button to look for enemies out of view.

125
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,009
It's very useful for not getting yourself killed.

126
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:13,009
Press the scroll wheel to lock onto enemies.

127
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:16,310
Just make sure to place your crosshair over them first.

128
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,620
Right mouse to grab, shift to look.

129
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,240
Left mouse button to shoot, scroll wheel to lock on.

130
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,500
Okay, hold on, let me check that out.

131
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,959
So, shift lets you look.

132
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,029
Where that's lock on.

133
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:38,970
So, scroll wheel, lock on.

134
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:52,519
Okay, got it.

135
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,519
All right, that about sums up the basics.

136
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,519
However...

137
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,210
However, there's always more tricks to learn.

138
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,210
You can throw any weapon you pick up by pressing your right mouse button.

139
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,340
You can use doors to knock enemies over.

140
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,340
Guns are very loud and will alert your foes.

141
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,340
So, plan your moves and use melee weapons when you can.

142
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,350
God damn it.

143
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,350
You'll just get yourself killed.

144
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,590
Why did I do that?

145
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,960
Won't you?

146
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,809
Phone calls!

147
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:31,759
I don't know what that accent was.

148
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,179
And who do we have here?

149
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:37,179
We've got a horse man.

150
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:41,080
Oh, you don't know who you are.

151
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Maybe we should leave it that way.

152
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,879
We've got a horse.

153
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,879
We've got Bro Jack Horseman, Chicken Little.

154
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,879
I know you.

155
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,879
Look at my face.

156
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,879
We've met before.

157
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,879
Haven't we?

158
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,820
I don't know you.

159
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,000
Why are you here?

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,820
You're no guest.

161
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
That's an O.W.O. face.

162
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,570
You're no guest of mine.

163
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,809
Do you really want me to reveal who you are?

164
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,809
Knowing oneself means acknowledging one's actions.

165
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:16,330
As of lately, you've done some terrible things.

166
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,269
If you don't remember me, I'll give you a clue.

167
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:22,639
Does April the 3rd mean anything to you?

168
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,639
I believe that was the day of our first encounter.

169
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,639
You look like you might be remembering something.

170
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:34,399
April 3rd, 1989, Miami, Florida.

171
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:41,860
Okay, this is just the intro to Earthbound.

172
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,190
Same music, too.

173
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:52,000
Am I gonna get attacked?

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,490
You have one new message.

175
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,730
Hi, this is Tim at the bakery.

176
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,730
The cookies that you ordered shall be delivered by now.

177
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,730
A list of ingredients are included.

178
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,730
Make sure that you read them carefully.

179
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,730
Click.

180
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,990
Okay.

181
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,000
Music needs to be louder.

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,299
Like, I can't.

183
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:18,299
I can't right now.

184
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:19,299
Just wait.

185
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,299
Just wait till I get through the first level.

186
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:24,399
Cookies.

187
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,830
That's my D.P.I.

188
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,830
It's not bad.

189
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,649
The target is a briefcase.

190
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,649
Discretion is of essence.

191
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:36,649
Leave target at point F32 inside the dumpster.

192
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:37,649
Failure is not an option.

193
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:40,909
It will be watching you.

194
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,879
All right.

195
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,850
It's gotta be louder.

196
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,850
I'm getting...

197
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,860
Why is everybody adding me?

198
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
Can I go on my balcony?

199
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,860
I don't even have a balcony?

200
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,299
Do I get to upgrade my house?

201
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,299
Is this a game where you make money and upgrade your house?

202
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:05,299
Can I have, like, cool stuff in the way and I turn it into a sim?

203
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,299
Okay, I'm just...

204
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,299
Get inside of Christopher Lloyd's time travel car.

205
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:18,409
The Metro.

206
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:19,409
Richard.

207
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:20,409
Unavailable.

208
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:21,409
Whoa.

209
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,409
Okay.

210
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:27,659
Looks like I'm Richard.

211
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:30,659
Do I have to talk to anybody or is this just time to play the game?

212
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:31,659
Oh.

213
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,149
Break his neck.

214
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:43,200
Win?

215
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
No, I lost.

216
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,779
I...

217
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:55,320
Okay.

218
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Okay.

219
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
You gotta be quick.

220
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,230
You gotta be very quick.

221
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,230
Yeah, there's a guy on the phone.

222
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,230
A guy walking around over here.

223
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,840
Ha ha!

224
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,980
Ah.

225
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:19,679
Thank God there's a checkpoint.

226
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,820
Okay.

227
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Got it.

228
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
Is this a gun?

229
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:39,929
I don't think this is a gun.

230
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:40,929
What?

231
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:53,750
Whoops.

232
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,750
This is too stressful for me.

233
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,590
Is that a...

234
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,149
Whoa.

235
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:09,029
Okay, good.

236
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,029
Oh, man.

237
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:11,029
Oh, no.

238
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:12,029
Wait.

239
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:13,029
How do I get rid of the briefcase?

240
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:14,029
How do I throw the briefcase down?

241
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:30,539
I wanna drop briefcase.

242
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:37,610
What?

243
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,610
You fucking idiot.

244
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,610
Oh my God.

245
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,019
Just go.

246
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:50,919
Go.

247
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,929
Hurry up.

248
00:14:52,929 --> 00:15:03,059
Break his neck.

249
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:06,929
All right.

250
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:08,549
Go to the car.

251
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:09,549
I did it.

252
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:15,460
Is there more?

253
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,460
I gotta leave it in the dumpster.

254
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,389
Who's there?

255
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:32,129
I can hear you.

256
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:37,080
I know you're there.

257
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
Stage clear.

258
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,980
Chapter clear.

259
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,980
That's true.

260
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,980
Wait.

261
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,580
Was I not supposed to kill that guy?

262
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,139
Was that the guy in the...

263
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:51,139
Did I do it?

264
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:52,139
Was I not supposed to do that?

265
00:15:52,139 --> 00:16:03,549
Killing...

266
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:05,559
Bologna.

267
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,629
No, that's...

268
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:08,629
Sorry.

269
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:09,629
That's what I'm saying.

270
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:10,629
That's the Spanish way to say it.

271
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:17,120
Bologna.

272
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Time bonus.

273
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Flexibility.

274
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,629
Mobility.

275
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:31,070
Whatever.

276
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,070
I got a B.

277
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,070
Execution.

278
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,070
Exposure.

279
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,679
Two times combo.

280
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,970
Execution.

281
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,870
Execution.

282
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,870
B.

283
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,370
I got a new mask.

284
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,370
Erasmus.

285
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,370
What do you mean mediocre?

286
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,370
Generic.

287
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,820
A B is not generic.

288
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,820
A B means you did a good job.

289
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
Generic B.

290
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,450
Give me a break.

291
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,450
Hi there, man.

292
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,259
Haven't seen you around.

293
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,259
Thought something might have happened to you.

294
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:03,259
You seem really down over losing your girlfriend.

295
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:07,769
Don't remember seeing you after that.

296
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,769
Maybe we should talk about something else.

297
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,769
So out for a midnight snack, huh?

298
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:12,769
Nah, don't worry about it.

299
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:13,769
It's on the house.

300
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:14,769
Good to see you.

301
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:15,769
Have a nice night.

302
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:21,680
I didn't do anything.

303
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,460
What is this guy eating?

304
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,460
Oh, is that sushi?

305
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,460
I love sushi.

306
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,900
Sushi?

307
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Sushi?

308
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:47,509
What else do I got?

309
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:48,509
What?

310
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:49,509
Everyone's upset that I said sushi?

311
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:50,509
What's happening?

312
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:55,670
I said sushi because it looked like it was sushi.

313
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,670
And I love sushi.

314
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,670
And all of a sudden, I'm a bad guy?

315
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,380
You have one message.

316
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,380
Hello, it's Linda.

317
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,380
I need a babysitter.

318
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,380
Right away, I got a few kids that need to be disciplined here.

319
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,380
I'm at East 7th Street.

320
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,380
Make sure you have a long talk with them.

321
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,380
I really need someone to get through to these rascals.

322
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,380
And like last time, please be discreet.

323
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,519
Turn it up?

324
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,519
I have to quit the game to turn it up.

325
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,519
Just wait.

326
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,519
Just wait.

327
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,519
Hold on.

328
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:28,700
Wait, wait, wait.

329
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
Guys, I was at a B, okay?

330
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,259
I'm at a B for music.

331
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:35,259
That's the kind of person that I am.

332
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:40,579
I'm only a B or...

333
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:45,180
That's as high as it goes.

334
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,059
Take music to an A plus?

335
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,880
No.

336
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Music seems to be an A.

337
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
Just 97.

338
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,779
That's fine.

339
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:55,779
It's up.

340
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:56,779
It's up all the way.

341
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:02,609
This one's called No Talk.

342
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:06,700
Look, I'm getting the...

343
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
I can see the whole level now.

344
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
Start with intro?

345
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
No.

346
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,779
Don't be afraid of dying is what this thing says.

347
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,900
Richard.

348
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,900
An eye for secrets.

349
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,900
What does that mean?

350
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
All right, let's go.

351
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,900
Let's take a look.

352
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,900
Who's inside?

353
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Long corridor.

354
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,400
Long corridor again.

355
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
That's it.

356
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Nothing else.

357
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,769
Discipline the people in here.

358
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:34,769
All right.

359
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:35,769
We've got...

360
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:36,769
Hold on.

361
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:37,769
Wait, wait, wait.

362
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:38,769
Guy up here.

363
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:39,769
Leads to guy...

364
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:40,769
Nobody in living room?

365
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:41,769
Kitchen.

366
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:42,769
All right.

367
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:43,769
Kill guy in kitchen.

368
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:46,769
Shoot his head off and then take his gun, right?

369
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,940
That's...

370
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,180
I almost just passed out.

371
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:03,099
Psycho.

372
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:08,819
Okay, I got a gun.

373
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:09,819
Two rounds.

374
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:13,099
Two...

375
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:14,099
All right.

376
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:15,099
Guy with a gun and a guy sitting on the couch.

377
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:16,099
I can take...

378
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:17,099
Shoot guy, throw gun at guy.

379
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:24,299
All right.

380
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:31,490
I got it.

381
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,490
Who's in this room?

382
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,490
We got a guy on the couch, guy with a gun, and that's it.

383
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,650
Wait.

384
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,650
I need run.

385
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,650
I need bullets.

386
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,400
This one...

387
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,789
Is there anymore guns?

388
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:44,789
No gun.

389
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:45,789
Okay.

390
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:48,819
Six rounds.

391
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:49,819
Check this out.

392
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:50,819
Ready?

393
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:51,819
Bingo and then bango.

394
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,250
What just happened?

395
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,960
Oh, come on.

396
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
What?

397
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,670
What the fuck was that?

398
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:13,410
I missed him and he hit his head on the door.

399
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:33,420
I gotta wait till he turns.

400
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,420
No lock on.

401
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,420
Lock on is gonna hurt me.

402
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
Lock on is gonna be bad.

403
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:49,460
Unless I can plan what I wanna do.

404
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,460
This guy had a crazy gun too.

405
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,460
All right.

406
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,450
I'm good.

407
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,450
You shift to look further?

408
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,450
That's what I've been doing.

409
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,450
What are you talking about?

410
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,450
I've been doing that this whole time.

411
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,690
I've been using shift the entire time.

412
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:11,200
Quite the discreet operation.

413
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,920
What a 2010 streamer.

414
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,359
You can look further away.

415
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,359
What?

416
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,710
A minus.

417
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,710
See, I turned up the volume.

418
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,279
All right.

419
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:37,650
Now you're just being bastards.

420
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,980
Now we got Tony.

421
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,019
We got three masks now.

422
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:51,349
God, I love pizza.

423
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:52,349
You know what?

424
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:53,349
It's crazy.

425
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:55,349
I haven't had pizza in like three months.

426
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:58,849
Because I've been trying to stay away from bread.

427
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:01,849
Because my whole body is like all fucked up.

428
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:03,849
I'm not going into minute details.

429
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,849
I'm trying to stay away from gluten.

430
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:07,849
Because I feel like I'm developing a gluten intolerance.

431
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:09,849
And I've got a dark disappointment coming up.

432
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:12,089
I miss pizza.

433
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:13,089
Hey there.

434
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:15,420
Welcome.

435
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
Oh, you don't need to order.

436
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,420
Your pizza's already done.

437
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,539
Gluten-free pizza.

438
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,539
Yeah, but you have to like go specially get it.

439
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:24,539
You can't go to...

440
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:28,539
You can't go into like pizza hut or Domino's or...

441
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:30,539
And order like a gluten-free pizza.

442
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,539
Can you?

443
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:32,539
Don't get me wrong.

444
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:43,369
I would eat a whole entire pizza to myself right now.

445
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:47,369
But every time I've been eating bread.

446
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:49,369
I get like sick.

447
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:50,369
And it's...

448
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:51,369
I don't know.

449
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:52,369
And I've got a doctor's appointment coming up.

450
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,369
So you'd find out what the fuck's wrong with me.

451
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,369
Let's leave it at that for now.

452
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,369
Shall we?

453
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:57,369
Yeah, I agree.

454
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,180
Don't worry about paying.

455
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,180
It's on the house.

456
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:08,990
And then I don't know if it's something to do with like colitis.

457
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,990
Or I have no idea.

458
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,990
But it's really, really not cool.

459
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:19,549
You forget just how much shit has like bread or wheat or gluten in it.

460
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:21,549
When you try to avoid it.

461
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:22,549
It's wild.

462
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:27,609
So I got my pizza.

463
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:33,069
And a phone call.

464
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:34,440
I got one new message.

465
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,559
Just eat it.

466
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,990
And then I could, but it doesn't feel very good.

467
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,990
This is Thomas from the Methadone Clinic.

468
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,990
We've scheduled a short meeting for you tonight.

469
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,990
We're at North West 840...

470
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,990
184th Street, Apartment 105.

471
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,990
And don't worry.

472
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,990
We know discretion is of importance to our clients.

473
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,740
Click.

474
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:07,960
This game's pretty fun.

475
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Why have I never played this game?

476
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,460
In like the seven years that it's been available to play.

477
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,460
It's called Overdose.

478
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,460
You can shoot through some walls.

479
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:25,240
Fists of Fury and Eye for Secrets.

480
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,480
I'm going to assume this means harder punches.

481
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,900
So guy sitting on the chair.

482
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,900
Guy at the front door.

483
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,900
We're going to go front door.

484
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,900
Punch.

485
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,900
Break guy's neck into the other room.

486
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,900
Avoid the piano.

487
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:50,279
We got guy with a gun.

488
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,279
Guy pissing.

489
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,819
Break his neck space.

490
00:25:55,819 --> 00:26:08,750
I need that.

491
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,849
All right.

492
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:12,849
I got a gun now.

493
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:17,799
I don't think I want to use it though.

494
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,799
No, I don't.

495
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:28,269
We got a guy down at the piano.

496
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:36,359
I knocked him out.

497
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:45,019
Oh shit.

498
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:46,019
I don't have any more weapons.

499
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:47,019
What am I doing?

500
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:48,390
Okay.

501
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:53,730
We're good.

502
00:26:53,730 --> 00:27:07,900
Oh fuck.

503
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,519
Oh no.

504
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:22,789
Oh no.

505
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:26,339
Oh.

506
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:28,730
No.

507
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,730
Give me this.

508
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,730
Is there somebody left?

509
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,730
Who's still alive?

510
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,730
I don't.

511
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,730
I'm going to die.

512
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,740
I'm going to walk in a room.

513
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,740
Okay.

514
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:43,460
That guy down there.

515
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,599
He's the only guy left.

516
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,599
All right.

517
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,599
I got it.

518
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,599
Let's get out of here.

519
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,599
Can I get this thing?

520
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:57,619
That's not real.

521
00:27:57,619 --> 00:27:58,619
Crab?

522
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:03,000
What do you mean crab?

523
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Crab.

524
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,660
Crab.

525
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,329
Grab the crab.

526
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:15,210
Dead guy.

527
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:23,589
Give me a fucking A plus for that one.

528
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:31,190
Didn't even need to restart that one.

529
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:35,500
Boomer accidentally activates sticky keys.

530
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:53,119
What?

531
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,119
Combos.

532
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,119
I had a few combos there.

533
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,869
Flexibility.

534
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,869
Like I threw the thing at the guy and it bounced off the wall and I bounced back

535
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:00,869
and I hit him and I shot him.

536
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:06,950
New weapon unlocked and it's an A.

537
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:15,299
New mask.

538
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,470
Aubrey and Earl.

539
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,539
Okay.

540
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:20,539
New weapon.

541
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:23,299
Do I get to start with this or something?

542
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:31,509
Samurai sword.

543
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:33,839
This is fun.

544
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,839
I'm glad I played this.

545
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,420
Hey, dude.

546
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,299
Good to see you again.

547
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:42,299
Did you hear about the massacre the other night?

548
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,299
A bunch of rusties I heard.

549
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:45,299
No loss.

550
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,299
Did you ask me?

551
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:49,299
They say some maniac wearing a rubber mask did it.

552
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:50,299
Jesus.

553
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:54,299
Sounds like a scene straight from a slasher flick.

554
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:59,769
I have the perfect film for you.

555
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:00,769
The one on the desk.

556
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:01,769
Take it.

557
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:07,099
It's on the house.

558
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:10,390
Enjoy yourself, dude.

559
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:20,250
Why does this guy keep giving me free stuff?

560
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,250
I should play the second one too?

561
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,250
Well, one step at a time.

562
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,279
April 25th.

563
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:37,519
Hi, it's Kate from Hotline Miami's dating service.

564
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:40,519
We have set up a date for you this evening.

565
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,519
Should be waiting for you at Southwest 53rd Place.

566
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,519
As usual, make sure you wear something fancy.

567
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,420
Do I have to go to my wardrobe?

568
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:59,019
All I have is a Nintendo console with two games.

569
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:01,769
I don't have any clothes.

570
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:16,339
This is called decadence.

571
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:20,299
Alright, what did we unlock?

572
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:21,299
More guns.

573
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,299
Or where's Earl?

574
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:27,569
Survive two bullets.

575
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:33,390
That seems kind of crazy.

576
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,390
That seems like it's...

577
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,390
That makes it...

578
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,819
No, I don't want to be Earl yet.

579
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:38,819
Not until I need it.

580
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:42,450
Let's do more guns.

581
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,450
Alright.

582
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,900
Scope it out.

583
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,660
Front door.

584
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,960
Okay, we're going to do this in one shot.

585
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
You ready for me?

586
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,200
You ready for me?

587
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Front door.

588
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Knock the guy out.

589
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Grab the gun in the left room.

590
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Head to the left.

591
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Shoot all three people with gun.

592
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Run out.

593
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Throw gun at guy here.

594
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Punch guy here.

595
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Break that guy's neck.

596
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Shoot that guy with gun that he drops.

597
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Go!

598
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,559
Oh, that didn't work.

599
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,559
Alright, so...

600
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:24,569
I'm going to go this way.

601
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:29,920
Oh, hit me right in the head.

602
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:37,180
Whoa!

603
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:50,509
Shoot a fake Earl.

604
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:54,740
I've got to take it slow.

605
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:00,329
Who's in here?

606
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:02,329
Is this guy watching TV?

607
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:05,140
How do I get in there?

608
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,009
Alright, it's possible.

609
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:11,009
It's very possible that I go...

610
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:12,630
If this guy turns...

611
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,630
I can get this guy without this guy knowing, I think.

612
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:21,380
Oh, fuck.

613
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,380
Oh, shit.

614
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,380
In my pants.

615
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:35,109
Damn it!

616
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:36,109
Oh, the guy's next to me.

617
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:40,940
Fuck.

618
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:46,460
Oh, shit.

619
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,460
I didn't...

620
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,220
Oh, fuck.

621
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,220
Okay, I've got to calm down.

622
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,700
Oh, shit!

623
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:04,640
Oh, my god.

624
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Oh, my fucking god.

625
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:11,550
Damn it!

626
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,550
Oh, my god.

627
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:21,920
Put the other mask on.

628
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
Did I not kill that guy?

629
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:29,019
How did they not hear this?

630
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:30,019
He's alive.

631
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:31,019
The door blocked it.

632
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:33,219
I've got to do this quietly.

633
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:54,730
I need a melee weapon.

634
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,730
Is there a melee weapon in here?

635
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,730
You know what I'm saying?

636
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,679
It's got to be shoot, shoot.

637
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,679
You've got to shoot.

638
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,679
I need six rounds here.

639
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,679
I'm not sure I can do this silently.

640
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,679
Oh, my lord.

641
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:08,010
This is fucking hard.

642
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,010
Get back in.

643
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:18,309
How do I get in the car?

644
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:29,860
Wait, did I fucking ruin everything for myself?

645
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,860
I think I did.

646
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,420
I think I understand what happened here.

647
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,289
That guy's got a melee weapon.

648
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:40,289
Get him.

649
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:45,239
Did I...

650
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,239
Hold on a minute.

651
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,239
Hold on a second.

652
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,670
I'm curious about this.

653
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,670
Yeah, okay, I've...

654
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,489
Look at this.

655
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:52,489
That's why...

656
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:54,179
I figured it out.

657
00:35:54,179 --> 00:36:06,619
Oh.

658
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:10,300
That's why I can't do anything.

659
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,300
This guy's trying to get away.

660
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,300
No, I can do this without alerting the whole house.

661
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,300
All right.

662
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,699
So, this is what's going to happen.

663
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:17,699
I said I don't want him to see this.

664
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:19,579
I'm going to do it.

665
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:20,579
I'm going to do it.

666
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:21,579
I'm going to do it.

667
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,940
I'm going to do this.

668
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,940
I'm going to do this.

669
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,210
I'm going to do this.

670
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,579
I'm going to do this.

671
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:28,579
Oh, my god.

672
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:29,579
That's enough of a movement of punishment.

673
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:40,550
Is this guy trying to get away?

674
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,469
Now I can do this without alerting the whole house.

675
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:46,699
Alright, so this is what's gonna happen.

676
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:47,699
Like, now, listen.

677
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:50,420
Now I've figured it out.

678
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,699
Once these guys are out of the way, I'm gonna kill him and leave the room.

679
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,980
Three, two, one, go.

680
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:01,449
Fuck me.

681
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:02,849
I forgot about the guy at the end of the hall.

682
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:04,849
Oh, I'm gonna be here all night.

683
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:08,579
Is he dead?

684
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:09,579
He's not dead.

685
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:49,960
Hit him with the door.

686
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,960
How far does the door go?

687
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,579
Shit.

688
00:37:52,579 --> 00:38:09,380
Alright.

689
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,380
I know I'm not fucking around.

690
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,159
I'm almost done.

691
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,190
These guys down here need to die first.

692
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:25,550
We've got guy walking, patrolling, I'm gonna hit him with the door, I'm gonna shoot the

693
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:30,780
guy in front of me, and then I don't know what I'm gonna do after that.

694
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:36,309
Now I'm gonna improvise after that one.

695
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:50,579
My whole body just...

696
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:57,159
That's not over.

697
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:02,130
I need a good weapon.

698
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,130
Homer Simpson.

699
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,130
Ah, fuck.

700
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:10,230
At least I have a checkpoint.

701
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,230
Legit scared.

702
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:15,539
I know.

703
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:23,059
I'm just panicking.

704
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:30,860
Give me the melee weapon.

705
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:35,329
Oh, it's the DPI.

706
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:37,420
It's gonna be faster than this.

707
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,420
That's actually better.

708
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,420
No, it's not.

709
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,420
I'm lying to myself.

710
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:48,960
Hey, what?

711
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,960
How did you see me?

712
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:59,039
Alright, hide.

713
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:00,039
I can get these two guys.

714
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,039
I can get a guy with the door.

715
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,039
Here we go.

716
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,039
No, wait.

717
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,599
Guy with the door.

718
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:06,800
Oops.

719
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Oh, oops.

720
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,010
Wait, wait.

721
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,010
Okay.

722
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:18,639
I need a melee weapon.

723
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:19,639
Give me the knife.

724
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:27,730
I gotta throw it at this guy's fucking head.

725
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:28,769
That didn't kill him?

726
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:31,030
You motherfucker!

727
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:42,000
Fuck it.

728
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:56,230
Let's go.

729
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,230
Who shot me from behind?

730
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,500
Wait, somebody...

731
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,250
Oh my god.

732
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,250
What an idiot.

733
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:09,650
My fists are instant kill with this character.

734
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:10,650
Are you kidding me?

735
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:18,289
The guy!

736
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:19,289
The same guy!

737
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:20,289
Oh my god!

738
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:35,099
Where the fuck is he?

739
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:47,860
Shit.

740
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,860
Can he see?

741
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,860
No, he can't see through, right?

742
00:41:49,860 --> 00:42:08,440
Oh boy, my boy.

743
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,440
Oh boy.

744
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Okay.

745
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,440
These secrets.

746
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:19,059
That was fucking crazy.

747
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:21,489
What a fucking fun game.

748
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:22,489
What a wild game.

749
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:23,489
I can't believe I missed this.

750
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,530
This is like my favorite game of the year and it's like 10 years late.

751
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,530
Uh-oh.

752
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,690
Gotta do everything by myself, huh?

753
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,690
Oh no.

754
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,690
I gotta hide.

755
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,380
Okay, gun.

756
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:46,619
All right.

757
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:55,420
I'm getting flashbacks to the butcher in Diablo 1.

758
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,420
I'm actually scared right now.

759
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,099
Oh my god.

760
00:42:58,099 --> 00:42:59,099
He's everywhere.

761
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:00,099
Oh!

762
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:09,860
Break his neck!

763
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,860
What?

764
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:16,900
Oh god.

765
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,900
Please don't.

766
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,900
Can I do anything here?

767
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:33,579
Is this person okay?

768
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:36,800
Can I like save this person?

769
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,809
Oh, well.

770
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:43,119
I don't know.

771
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,119
I don't know.

772
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:47,019
I don't know.

773
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:48,019
I don't know.

774
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:49,019
I don't know.

775
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,010
Oh, well.

776
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:52,010
I've just reached in his eyes.

777
00:43:52,010 --> 00:44:01,820
Oh.

778
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,820
Throw this.

779
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,820
I don't want this.

780
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,579
I don't want this equipped.

781
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:16,989
Let's go.

782
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:26,679
I did it.

783
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:35,539
That was intense.

784
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:36,539
All right.

785
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,380
What grade am I going to get here?

786
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,380
It's the C plus guy, aren't I?

787
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,780
New mask.

788
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,949
Don Juan.

789
00:44:46,949 --> 00:44:54,590
Hey there.

790
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,590
Welcome.

791
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,150
Why is this guy every single employee in every store?

792
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,150
You don't look well, sir.

793
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,150
Are you all right?

794
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,150
Are you sure it is okay for you to be drinking?

795
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,150
All right.

796
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,150
Then I'll get you something special.

797
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,579
Do you like sweet or sour?

798
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:09,659
Maybe you want it bitter.

799
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:10,659
It's me again.

800
00:45:10,659 --> 00:45:11,969
Yeah.

801
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:13,489
Leather jacket.

802
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:14,489
I was going to say.

803
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:16,239
Yeah.

804
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:17,239
The resemblance is there.

805
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:18,519
For sure.

806
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:19,519
It's me again.

807
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:23,940
And there you go, sir.

808
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,099
Enjoy.

809
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,099
No, it's me.

810
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:32,090
Are we puking?

811
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:38,230
I think I'm rushing these scenes too much.

812
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:46,409
Is there other things to see in here?

813
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:47,409
Apparently not.

814
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:51,139
Really?

815
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:52,139
All right.

816
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:55,940
Let's go.

817
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,940
Next mission.

818
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:03,070
I do like how they break it up, though, because I am like a rubber band ball

819
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,070
right now.

820
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:09,340
I'm in the center of it.

821
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,340
Oh, it's you again.

822
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:14,550
It looks like you've been busy since we last met.

823
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,550
I see that you remember me now, don't you?

824
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,550
But you still don't know who I am.

825
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:22,300
You don't even know who introduced us, do you?

826
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,699
Why did you come back here?

827
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:25,699
You're not a nice person, are you?

828
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,380
You make me sick.

829
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,940
Split personality.

830
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,940
It's me.

831
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,940
I'm talking to myself.

832
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,940
I wear the masks and I talk to myself.

833
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,940
I already figured it out.

834
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,119
The picture is starting to take form here.

835
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:37,119
I wonder if it's accurate.

836
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,119
Some pieces don't quite seem to fit.

837
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:42,059
Maybe I just don't like the way it looks.

838
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:46,980
I think our time is up, but we'll leave again.

839
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,219
Before you go, here's our questions to ponder.

840
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:51,219
Question number one.

841
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:53,219
Do you like hurting other people?

842
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:54,219
Question number two.

843
00:46:54,219 --> 00:46:59,230
Who are you leaving messages on your answering machine?

844
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,230
Who are leaving messages on your answering machine?

845
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,230
Question number three.

846
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,230
Where are you right now?

847
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,230
And final question.

848
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,230
Why are we having this conversation?

849
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:14,420
I'm talking to myself.

850
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,420
He said the line?

851
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:20,739
What do you mean, the line?

852
00:47:20,739 --> 00:47:21,739
This is Blake speaking.

853
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:22,739
We have a job for you.

854
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:25,179
We have a power outage over on 24th.

855
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:26,179
We want you to take care of it.

856
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:30,179
We already sent someone over a while ago, but it seems he didn't do a very good job.

857
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:31,179
Head over there right away.

858
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:32,179
They're expecting you.

859
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:34,179
Keep it quick and clean.

860
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:42,110
I mean, like, guys, I don't know.

861
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:46,110
This is like we're watching the prequels of Star Wars.

862
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,110
And Obi-Wan Kenobi is talking to Anakin.

863
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:51,110
And spoilers, by the way.

864
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,110
Who cares?

865
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:53,110
Star Wars...

866
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:54,110
There's no such thing as a Star Wars spoiler.

867
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:57,110
They have a whole ride based on this encounter at Disney World.

868
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,460
And he says...

869
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,460
All right, if you haven't just seen Star Wars yet, just fucking...

870
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,460
You know...

871
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:10,000
Why am I so worried about that?

872
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
When he screams, you are the chosen one, right?

873
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,369
If I've never seen that movie before, I don't know the line.

874
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:17,369
I'm just like, oh, that was an interesting line.

875
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:19,369
And then you sit next to me, you're like, oh, he said it!

876
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,739
See?

877
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:21,739
I'm just like, I don't know, man.

878
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:24,679
Lethal doors.

879
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:28,349
Let's try it.

880
00:48:28,349 --> 00:48:31,230
All right, first try.

881
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:42,750
What happened to the lethal doors?

882
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:49,820
Am I missing something here?

883
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:55,449
All right, well, anyways, fuck it.

884
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:02,619
Oh, you heard me.

885
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:08,980
Where's that dog?

886
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,429
What?

887
00:49:11,429 --> 00:49:12,429
The fuck?

888
00:49:12,429 --> 00:49:23,210
How did I miss?

889
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,210
How did I miss?

890
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:41,260
Got them both.

891
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,260
Double kill.

892
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,750
Woo!

893
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:47,739
Oh, no.

894
00:49:47,739 --> 00:50:00,250
Another Mike Peek.

895
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,250
What happened to the lethal door?

896
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:15,099
What happened to the lethal door?

897
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:16,099
What happened to the lethal door?

898
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:17,099
Give me another mask.

899
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:18,099
Wait, I need a gun.

900
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,679
Yeah, that works too.

901
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:34,340
Okay, whatever.

902
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:44,860
I don't give a shit.

903
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:45,860
As long as it works.

904
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,860
Is anybody up here?

905
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,030
I can't see that far.

906
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:49,030
No, I'm safe in here.

907
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:53,409
Holy fuck!

908
00:50:53,409 --> 00:50:54,409
The guy behind me!

909
00:50:54,849 --> 00:50:56,599
Oh, my God.

910
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:57,599
I'm so mad.

911
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:16,059
Dog.

912
00:51:16,059 --> 00:51:17,059
Dog.

913
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:18,550
Dog.

914
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,550
Dog.

915
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:20,550
Dog.

916
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,550
Gun in the gun.

917
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:37,059
Do I have to use a gun on the dog?

918
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:38,059
What the?

919
00:51:38,059 --> 00:51:39,820
Oh, oh my God.

920
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,820
This game is so hard.

921
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:51,269
It's fucking so much fun, but holy shit.

922
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:52,769
They fuck kill him.

923
00:51:52,769 --> 00:51:56,889
It's this is the guy that opens this door.

924
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:57,889
I got to get the guys down here.

925
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:58,889
Give me the melee weapon.

926
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:00,130
I feel like I'm better with that than I am anything else.

927
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,130
All right.

928
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:14,400
How do I do this?

929
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:21,269
How do I do this?

930
00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:22,269
How do I do this?

931
00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:25,940
How do I do this?

932
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:26,940
How do I do this?

933
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,699
How do I do this?

934
00:52:28,699 --> 00:52:29,699
How do I do this?

935
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:30,699
How do I do this?

936
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:31,699
How do I do this?

937
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:36,750
All right.

938
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:37,750
Here we go.

939
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,750
One.

940
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:39,750
Two.

941
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,889
Don't count.

942
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:42,889
Just go.

943
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:43,889
You fucking dumb motherfucker.

944
00:52:43,889 --> 00:53:09,829
I swear to God.

945
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:24,000
Oh, my God.

946
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
He's not dead.

947
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,460
He is.

948
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,460
All right.

949
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,460
Lethal door.

950
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,010
Let's lethal door this guy.

951
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:37,010
That didn't seem very lethal.

952
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,489
Oh, the fucking dog.

953
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:59,579
Oh, my God.

954
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:02,480
I can't handle this.

955
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,480
Oh, my fucking Lord.

956
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:20,039
I really need to change masks.

957
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:21,039
I was waiting for him.

958
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:28,360
I got it.

959
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,360
I got to get these guys.

960
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,559
The guy that comes out of the door here is the one that keeps killing me every

961
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:37,860
time.

962
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:38,860
I'm so nervous.

963
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,699
Why did he turn around right there?

964
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:43,699
God damn it.

965
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:53,940
Give me a new mask.

966
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,940
I'm not going to use this thing.

967
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,940
I can kill one guy with this door thing.

968
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,969
You know what I mean?

969
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:02,730
Like, I could get one guy with the fucking door killer in this level.

970
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:08,409
Give me something else.

971
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:09,409
Give me this thing.

972
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:45,909
I got to get in here.

973
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:46,909
I think this is the only.

974
00:55:46,909 --> 00:55:49,349
I'm trying to think of the only way I could go is probably straight on.

975
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:50,349
Maybe around the corner.

976
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:53,960
That guy's alive.

977
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,650
Fuck.

978
00:55:55,650 --> 00:56:10,579
Oh, my fucking God.

979
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:11,579
You got to be kidding me.

980
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:30,059
How did he get blocked by the door twice?

981
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:31,059
Let's get a gun.

982
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:32,059
Nope.

983
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:33,900
Gun.

984
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:38,400
Give me a gun.

985
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,400
Gun.

986
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:50,239
Ah!

987
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:51,239
Who's left?

988
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:57,280
Is there anybody left in this house?

989
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,280
I'm scared to move.

990
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,840
There's two guys with bats.

991
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,840
Two guys in that room.

992
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,840
The dog?

993
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,619
The dog is gone, right?

994
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:05,900
This only has five rounds.

995
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,969
Okay.

996
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:09,590
Do it.

997
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:10,590
I know you can do it.

998
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:11,590
Do it.

999
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:12,590
You can do it.

1000
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:13,590
Just shoot him.

1001
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:14,590
That's all you have to do.

1002
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:15,590
You have to go in the room and just get it lined up and shoot him.

1003
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:18,860
I fucking hate you.

1004
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,800
Okay.

1005
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,800
You're fine.

1006
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:27,969
I like you again.

1007
00:57:27,969 --> 00:57:31,829
No, I need melee.

1008
00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:32,829
Get back over to the door.

1009
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:39,929
These are the last few guys here.

1010
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:42,530
Wait until he's at the door and then just rush him.

1011
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:43,530
One, two, three.

1012
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:44,900
Oh my fucking god.

1013
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,900
Mom!

1014
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,900
Mom!

1015
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,699
Okay.

1016
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:57,949
I'm good.

1017
00:57:57,949 --> 00:57:58,949
What the fuck?

1018
00:57:58,949 --> 00:58:01,469
What happened to my DPI?

1019
00:58:01,469 --> 00:58:04,469
I pressed the fucking button on my Razor Deathadder.

1020
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:05,469
Okay.

1021
00:58:05,469 --> 00:58:06,710
There we go.

1022
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:07,710
Get the guy at the door.

1023
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:29,820
He's going to go all the way around, right?

1024
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:37,070
Holy shit!

1025
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:38,710
That guy didn't shoot me.

1026
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:39,710
I hit the button again.

1027
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:57,739
I did it again.

1028
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:58,739
I got to keep.

1029
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:07,559
I got to wait like a second before the fucking door opens.

1030
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:08,559
That's it.

1031
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:09,559
Last guy down here.

1032
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:12,920
There's two people hanging out in here.

1033
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,690
Two dudes in here.

1034
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:16,690
I think I have to go.

1035
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:22,360
I'm going from the back.

1036
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,360
Give me the pool cue.

1037
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,360
All right.

1038
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,360
I'm going to throw.

1039
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:32,500
What's this guy attached to?

1040
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,500
That guy's a gun.

1041
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,500
I have to go around.

1042
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,500
How am I going to do this?

1043
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:55,159
What?

1044
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:56,159
The fuck was that?

1045
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:05,719
I don't understand.

1046
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:06,719
What the fuck happened?

1047
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,199
I know the bomb is rigged to the door.

1048
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:11,199
Okay.

1049
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,079
Well, that was unnecessary, but whatever.

1050
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,639
One guy here.

1051
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:26,639
No bullets in that thing.

1052
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:31,269
Okay.

1053
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:32,269
I can't use either.

1054
01:00:32,269 --> 01:00:36,070
I got to go.

1055
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,070
How do I get in there?

1056
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:42,409
Can I go through like the bathroom?

1057
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:44,409
There's only two ways to get in there.

1058
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:49,659
How do I disarm the bomb?

1059
01:00:49,659 --> 01:00:50,659
Just shoot the door.

1060
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:51,659
But if I shoot...

1061
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:52,659
Am I going to...

1062
01:00:52,659 --> 01:00:53,659
I could kill a guy in here.

1063
01:00:53,659 --> 01:00:57,010
Don't I want to save this guy?

1064
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,010
Can I like do this?

1065
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:19,860
No.

1066
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:20,860
Can I get...

1067
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:31,539
It doesn't matter who they are.

1068
01:01:31,539 --> 01:01:34,739
All that matters is you kill them.

1069
01:01:34,739 --> 01:01:36,099
Can I...

1070
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:44,739
I can't like shoot through anything.

1071
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:45,739
Shoot the door.

1072
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:46,739
I just did that.

1073
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:47,920
Look.

1074
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,059
What are you talking about?

1075
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:53,769
I don't have any bullets.

1076
01:01:53,769 --> 01:01:54,769
What?

1077
01:01:54,769 --> 01:02:07,659
What?

1078
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:08,659
So wait.

1079
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:09,659
How am I supposed to know that I had to shoot it with the...

1080
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:12,460
I shoot it with different bullets for it to explode.

1081
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,820
Come on.

1082
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:14,820
Oh, fuck.

1083
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,599
Those guys are going to kill me.

1084
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,599
I knew it.

1085
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:19,599
I fucking knew it.

1086
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:35,559
Oh my God.

1087
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:36,559
Okay.

1088
01:02:36,559 --> 01:03:13,769
Shoot door.

1089
01:03:13,769 --> 01:03:14,769
Shoot door.

1090
01:03:14,769 --> 01:03:15,769
Shoot door.

1091
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:29,730
What am I going to do with you idiots?

1092
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:30,730
You're like...

1093
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:31,730
You're behind cover.

1094
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:43,460
Hmm.

1095
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,460
Hmm.

1096
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,460
Okay.

1097
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,409
So, um...

1098
01:03:47,409 --> 01:03:48,409
Hmm.

1099
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:52,610
I don't know.

1100
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:53,610
Diffuse the bomb.

1101
01:03:53,610 --> 01:04:13,699
I can't diffuse the bomb.

1102
01:04:13,699 --> 01:04:34,389
They stand up before they shoot to get the guy with the gun.

1103
01:04:34,389 --> 01:04:35,389
Oh my God.

1104
01:04:35,389 --> 01:04:36,389
I just want it to be done.

1105
01:04:36,389 --> 01:04:47,460
I'm trying to go so fast because I don't want to do it again.

1106
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,599
Where did he go with that gun?

1107
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:50,599
Where'd he go?

1108
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:51,599
He goes in this room?

1109
01:04:51,599 --> 01:05:06,090
What?

1110
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:12,179
Why did he even go in there?

1111
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:13,539
That's the first time he's ever gone in there.

1112
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:14,539
Like 30 attempts.

1113
01:05:14,539 --> 01:05:16,230
For real.

1114
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:21,059
Turning into a pig.

1115
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:26,199
I did...

1116
01:05:26,199 --> 01:05:27,199
That didn't kill him.

1117
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:42,050
I hit him with the door, apparently.

1118
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:43,050
Why did that not hurt him?

1119
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:59,679
Why did it hurt him the first time?

1120
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:00,679
Okay.

1121
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:02,239
Now, let's blow up the door.

1122
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:03,800
Alright.

1123
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,800
Now, give me...

1124
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,800
Do I have a gun?

1125
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,420
I have...

1126
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,179
Here's a rifle.

1127
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:12,699
They stand up before they shoot, but I feel like the guy down here is shooting me

1128
01:06:12,699 --> 01:06:14,460
before this guy does.

1129
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,579
And I can't see this guy.

1130
01:06:15,579 --> 01:06:18,530
So let's keep zoomed in.

1131
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:19,530
Holy fuck.

1132
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:20,530
Okay.

1133
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:30,500
Oh my lord in heaven.

1134
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,500
He stood up first.

1135
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,500
Alright.

1136
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:43,340
We're fine.

1137
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,960
Everything's good.

1138
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:45,960
That's too much.

1139
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,960
That's too much for my puny brain to handle.

1140
01:06:46,960 --> 01:07:06,820
I'm definitely going to get a bad grade here.

1141
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:07,820
No, that's fine.

1142
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:08,820
I'm okay with that.

1143
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:16,030
Uh, $50 just came in from Peanut Chan.

1144
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:17,030
Thank you for the 50 bucks.

1145
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:20,940
Hey, Jerma, your content got me through the stresses of college.

1146
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,780
I was lucky enough to get a nice job when I got out.

1147
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:26,420
So I want to pay you back now that I can afford it.

1148
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:30,260
I'm sure you'll pay me back when you spend it on something crazy to make me laugh and

1149
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:32,659
forget about the challenges of everyday life.

1150
01:07:32,659 --> 01:07:36,420
Jerma Hart, Transgender Pride, have fun with this amazing game.

1151
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,730
Absolutely.

1152
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:39,929
Thank you.

1153
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:45,239
Thank you, Peanut Chan, for your 50 bucks.

1154
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:56,320
And congratulations, obviously, on getting through college, getting a job.

1155
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,059
Thank you so much.

1156
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:09,869
It means a lot.

1157
01:08:09,869 --> 01:08:11,369
Graham is the bunny.

1158
01:08:11,369 --> 01:08:12,369
Glass bottle.

1159
01:08:12,369 --> 01:08:22,710
That's the one I'm fucking talking about.

1160
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:25,310
Yeah, Transgender Pride is the emote, right?

1161
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:37,369
Yes.

1162
01:08:37,369 --> 01:08:39,380
Okay.

1163
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,380
What are you guys doing out here?

1164
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:44,500
Should I be worried about this?

1165
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:50,659
Who the fuck?

1166
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:51,659
Who the fuck is this?

1167
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:59,460
All right, well, hey, something bad's going on outside your store, man.

1168
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:00,460
Oh, hi, there.

1169
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:05,739
Good to see you again.

1170
01:09:05,739 --> 01:09:07,300
I was a bit worried about you.

1171
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,979
The city streets don't seem so safe anymore, you know, with all the killings and all

1172
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:11,979
that.

1173
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:12,979
Don't worry about paying.

1174
01:09:12,979 --> 01:09:13,979
You're my friend.

1175
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:14,979
Your money's no good here now.

1176
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:15,979
Have a nice night.

1177
01:09:15,979 --> 01:09:25,229
Do I just go in every day to this store and the guy's like, hey, yeah, here.

1178
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:28,420
Want a stereo or something?

1179
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:39,109
Oh, wow, I forgot, by the way, I installed it and everything and I completely fucking

1180
01:09:39,109 --> 01:09:40,109
forgot about it.

1181
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:48,090
I just dropped a shitload of frames here.

1182
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:54,260
I installed Fortnite and made an account on Fortnite.

1183
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:59,500
And the joke was I was going to do a play a round of Fortnite every time I died in

1184
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,090
this game.

1185
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:05,649
I'm so glad I did not think that that was funny after installing it and doing

1186
01:10:05,649 --> 01:10:15,270
it on setting everything up.

1187
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:17,109
It's Dave from Miami Pest Control.

1188
01:10:17,109 --> 01:10:18,109
We need you.

1189
01:10:18,109 --> 01:10:22,760
A client at Southwest One of Hoist Street is having vermin problems.

1190
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,079
Try to handle it as quick and swift as you can.

1191
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:27,640
Someone else will clean up for you after you leave.

1192
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,479
Make sure not to bother any of the neighbors.

1193
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:41,500
How many times have I died so far?

1194
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:47,220
Imagine playing, like, a hundred games of Fortnite and I've never played it before.

1195
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:50,489
This is called Full House.

1196
01:10:50,489 --> 01:10:51,489
Be fast and efficient.

1197
01:10:51,489 --> 01:10:56,180
All right, who do we got?

1198
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,180
Lethal doors.

1199
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:58,180
Walk fast.

1200
01:11:01,649 --> 01:11:02,649
Mmm.

1201
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:03,649
This is for speed runners.

1202
01:11:03,649 --> 01:11:05,770
I don't know if I'm in that category.

1203
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:13,520
Ooh, that's a dog, dog, dog!

1204
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,520
Can't punch the dog.

1205
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,960
What am I doing?

1206
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,960
Pick it up.

1207
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:24,779
What?

1208
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:25,779
It's a knife!

1209
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:26,779
Holy shit, how am I still alive?

1210
01:11:26,779 --> 01:11:34,810
I have no idea.

1211
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:35,810
I just threw it.

1212
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:36,810
What am I doing?

1213
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:41,880
This is the sloppiest fucking time I've played.

1214
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,399
And somehow I'm still a living.

1215
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:55,779
I gotta get this guy in the door here.

1216
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:56,779
Still a dog alive.

1217
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:57,779
I gotta be worried about that.

1218
01:11:57,779 --> 01:12:06,130
You gonna come up here, dog?

1219
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:07,689
Holy fuck, it missed!

1220
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:08,689
Barely missed.

1221
01:12:08,689 --> 01:12:09,689
Oh no.

1222
01:12:09,689 --> 01:12:13,739
I tried!

1223
01:12:13,739 --> 01:12:14,739
I tried!

1224
01:12:14,739 --> 01:12:17,699
I tried to fucking break his neck and it wouldn't do it!

1225
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:21,100
Oh, I was like standing over his body for so long for no reason.

1226
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:24,710
Fuck!

1227
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:53,960
Did I not kill him in one hit?

1228
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,960
What?

1229
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,699
In the name of God, just happened there.

1230
01:12:58,699 --> 01:13:00,000
Almost done.

1231
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Give me the pool cue.

1232
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,010
It's bigger.

1233
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:04,010
Okay, just the guy in the kitchen.

1234
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:09,470
Does that guy come out?

1235
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:12,420
I don't think this guy comes out.

1236
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:18,859
Oh, and okay, you gotta explain to me what the fuck is with the turnaround there.

1237
01:13:18,859 --> 01:13:19,859
What's with the turnaround?

1238
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,180
Why did he turn around?

1239
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,180
You gotta explain it.

1240
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,180
What's with the turnaround there?

1241
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,180
Why did he turn around?

1242
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,180
What's with the turnaround?

1243
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:40,949
What happened?

1244
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:42,319
Why did he turn around there?

1245
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:43,319
Why did that happen?

1246
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:44,319
Why did that happen?

1247
01:13:44,319 --> 01:14:08,619
I'm still, I'm still reeling over why the fuck that happened.

1248
01:14:08,619 --> 01:14:10,239
Still a dog.

1249
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:11,239
Alright, two guys in here.

1250
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:13,859
Oh my, what happened to me?

1251
01:14:13,859 --> 01:14:15,100
I don't know.

1252
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,100
No, no, no, no.

1253
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,430
I don't know.

1254
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:21,449
I think, I don't know what to do here.

1255
01:14:21,449 --> 01:14:37,880
I just keep annoying this guy.

1256
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,630
Give me a fucking break.

1257
01:14:40,630 --> 01:15:08,109
Damn it.

1258
01:15:08,109 --> 01:15:09,109
Same deal.

1259
01:15:09,109 --> 01:15:10,109
Don't have that happen again.

1260
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:21,260
Don't throw this shit at him.

1261
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,939
Alright, melee.

1262
01:15:22,939 --> 01:15:23,939
Two guys with melee.

1263
01:15:23,939 --> 01:15:24,939
Two guys with guns.

1264
01:15:24,939 --> 01:15:27,140
I gotta go in there with a gun.

1265
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:28,319
I gotta go in there.

1266
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:29,319
I've gotta knock one guy down.

1267
01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:30,319
Shoot guy in front of me.

1268
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:31,619
Play it.

1269
01:15:31,619 --> 01:15:33,819
Play it cool for a second here.

1270
01:15:33,819 --> 01:15:34,819
So, knock out guy.

1271
01:15:34,819 --> 01:15:35,819
Shoot guy.

1272
01:15:35,819 --> 01:15:37,640
Guy comes around.

1273
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,640
Got it.

1274
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,350
This guy right here is the one that's gonna get shot.

1275
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,350
One, two, three.

1276
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:45,420
I don't even know how, I went through, I went through the door.

1277
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,140
I went through the door.

1278
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:48,939
That's not what was part of the plan, Jeremy.

1279
01:15:48,939 --> 01:16:02,539
I didn't wanna go through the fucking door.

1280
01:16:02,539 --> 01:16:03,539
That wasn't the plan.

1281
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:12,989
Holy fucking, he turned around all the far, that was so far away.

1282
01:16:12,989 --> 01:16:13,989
You know what?

1283
01:16:13,989 --> 01:16:15,170
Fuck the plan.

1284
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:34,199
I'll give you a plan.

1285
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:35,199
I'll give you a fucking plan.

1286
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:41,279
He, how did you turn on me that quickly?

1287
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:42,840
Fuck you.

1288
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:43,840
Come on.

1289
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,840
How?

1290
01:16:44,840 --> 01:17:02,750
Through the fucking door.

1291
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:09,880
Fuck the plan.

1292
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:10,880
I did, I killed one person.

1293
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:33,460
I just tried to, I ran out of bullets and I fucking ran out of bullets.

1294
01:17:33,460 --> 01:18:12,810
I'm so fucking, I'm so, don't have a plan.

1295
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:17,789
Forget about a plan.

1296
01:18:17,789 --> 01:18:18,789
Fuck the plan.

1297
01:18:18,789 --> 01:18:19,789
Again, it works.

1298
01:18:19,789 --> 01:18:22,439
Fuck the plan.

1299
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:26,560
Alright, let's go.

1300
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:32,979
Fuck the plan.

1301
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:38,960
Oh, somebody was sitting there.

1302
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:57,609
That guy's still alive.

1303
01:18:57,609 --> 01:19:12,220
What does that item do?

1304
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:15,220
What does that item even do?

1305
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,100
What the fuck item did I pick up?

1306
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,340
I was trying to melee.

1307
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:21,100
What the fuck did I just pick up off the ground?

1308
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,100
What did I pick up?

1309
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,100
A glass bottle.

1310
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:28,939
If you could see my face right now, my fucking teeth are showing.

1311
01:19:28,939 --> 01:20:17,680
I look like a dog.

1312
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:18,680
One guy in here.

1313
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,680
This guy was easy last time.

1314
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,579
Wasn't a problem.

1315
01:20:22,619 --> 01:20:23,619
Here come the other two guys.

1316
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:26,399
Don't, they didn't hear it.

1317
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:27,399
One, two.

1318
01:20:27,399 --> 01:20:29,800
That guy over here is definitely going to be more of a problem than this guy.

1319
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,300
For sure.

1320
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:34,260
And I missed.

1321
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:41,140
We're good.

1322
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:49,899
This is fucking crazy.

1323
01:20:49,899 --> 01:20:53,289
Oh, this game is so much fun.

1324
01:20:53,289 --> 01:21:10,470
But I like, I hate it.

1325
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:11,470
I love it though.

1326
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:18,729
Damn it.

1327
01:21:18,729 --> 01:21:19,729
I thought that was a B-.

1328
01:21:19,729 --> 01:21:23,340
No.

1329
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,340
I hate it.

1330
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:26,149
I got Dennis.

1331
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:32,340
Yeah, don't, I'm never picking up, okay that, that's probably a good gun.

1332
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:33,899
But I'm never picking up that stupid bottle.

1333
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:42,439
Good evening.

1334
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:43,680
How are you doing?

1335
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,359
You look a bit distracted.

1336
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:46,359
Something got you worried.

1337
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:48,439
These are harsh times we're living in, I know.

1338
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:50,279
Haven't seen many customers lately.

1339
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:52,159
Maybe they've lost their taste for pizza.

1340
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:55,039
Maybe it's time to close shop once and for all.

1341
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:57,319
Anyway, got your order right here.

1342
01:21:57,319 --> 01:21:58,319
Take care.

1343
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:02,199
What is, what is going on in this game?

1344
01:22:02,199 --> 01:22:12,789
A bottle gets you execution points?

1345
01:22:12,789 --> 01:22:14,069
That would make a lot of sense.

1346
01:22:14,069 --> 01:22:18,189
Hi, it's Don from Hotel Blue.

1347
01:22:18,189 --> 01:22:19,189
We need you tonight.

1348
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:23,430
Our receptionist went home due to stomach problems and we have some VIPs who will

1349
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:25,029
be staying with us today.

1350
01:22:25,029 --> 01:22:27,069
Make sure you give them a great stay.

1351
01:22:27,069 --> 01:22:29,590
That will be your top priority this evening.

1352
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:30,590
Get going.

1353
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:42,899
Wait, what?

1354
01:22:42,899 --> 01:22:43,899
What?

1355
01:22:43,899 --> 01:22:45,619
I just skipped the dialogue sequence with this guy.

1356
01:22:45,619 --> 01:22:46,619
How?

1357
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:48,760
I just like, accidentally clicked.

1358
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,039
I thought I had to click on him.

1359
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:51,039
What did he say?

1360
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:59,829
He just says dot dot dot.

1361
01:22:59,829 --> 01:23:00,829
Go back.

1362
01:23:00,829 --> 01:23:01,829
I'm not gonna be stuck.

1363
01:23:01,829 --> 01:23:03,069
Check the VOD.

1364
01:23:03,069 --> 01:23:06,500
Oh, this one's called Clean Hit.

1365
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,420
Tip, you can throw weapons.

1366
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:09,420
Yep.

1367
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:10,420
Alright, so let's see.

1368
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:13,899
You start with a knife with Dennis.

1369
01:23:15,729 --> 01:23:17,729
Alright, guy in the toilet.

1370
01:23:17,729 --> 01:23:18,729
Room full of weapons.

1371
01:23:18,729 --> 01:23:19,729
Guy in the toilet.

1372
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:20,729
Guy in the toilet it is.

1373
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:27,270
I don't think I even want to use those right now.

1374
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:29,750
Although there are a shitload of people in here.

1375
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:30,750
This is, yeah.

1376
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:31,750
How the fuck am I supposed to?

1377
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:41,850
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1378
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,850
I think this is like a turtle mission, isn't it?

1379
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,279
Are the waiters?

1380
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:49,699
Are the waiters gonna pull out guns?

1381
01:23:49,699 --> 01:23:50,699
Of course they are.

1382
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:57,619
Of course the fucking waiter is gonna pull out a gun.

1383
01:23:57,619 --> 01:24:00,039
No, I wanted to...

1384
01:24:00,039 --> 01:24:01,039
Holy shit.

1385
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:07,850
Okay.

1386
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:13,939
Alright, I gotta be really careful here.

1387
01:24:13,939 --> 01:24:14,939
All the way in the back.

1388
01:24:14,939 --> 01:24:16,380
Up top.

1389
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:22,270
Guy in the back has a good shot.

1390
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:23,899
Okay.

1391
01:24:23,899 --> 01:24:25,659
Last guy over here.

1392
01:24:25,659 --> 01:24:26,659
Can I just cheese him?

1393
01:24:26,659 --> 01:24:29,930
Oh, of course I can.

1394
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:30,930
Stage clear.

1395
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:33,899
Let's go.

1396
01:24:33,899 --> 01:24:34,899
Anywhere else.

1397
01:24:34,899 --> 01:24:35,899
Nothing else.

1398
01:24:35,899 --> 01:24:40,979
I'm gonna make sure I have a weapon up here.

1399
01:24:40,979 --> 01:24:41,979
Anybody right out the front door?

1400
01:24:41,979 --> 01:24:47,840
Are we sure about this?

1401
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:48,840
Whoa!

1402
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:49,840
Okay.

1403
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,840
Where the hell did you come from?

1404
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:54,000
Oh, fuck.

1405
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Okay.

1406
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:02,699
You're just down there.

1407
01:25:02,699 --> 01:25:06,380
So what's...

1408
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,380
What's this trying to tell me?

1409
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:15,960
Oh.

1410
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:21,100
Okay.

1411
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:22,100
Hi.

1412
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:23,100
Hi.

1413
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:24,100
Nice to meet you.

1414
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:38,340
What about this window?

1415
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:39,640
Can I open this window?

1416
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:49,779
I can't open the window.

1417
01:25:49,779 --> 01:26:09,250
There's somebody else in this room, so I think I'm alright to walk over here.

1418
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,250
This is gonna be very, very hard.

1419
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:11,489
I gotta be prepared for this.

1420
01:26:11,489 --> 01:26:12,489
I don't...

1421
01:26:12,489 --> 01:26:13,489
Okay, here we go.

1422
01:26:13,489 --> 01:26:14,489
One, two, three.

1423
01:26:14,489 --> 01:26:15,489
I gotta get like two people in one shot.

1424
01:26:15,489 --> 01:26:16,489
One, two, three.

1425
01:26:16,489 --> 01:26:20,989
Go!

1426
01:26:20,989 --> 01:26:32,539
Whoa!

1427
01:26:32,539 --> 01:26:36,720
What?

1428
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:44,680
What's going on?

1429
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,680
Okay.

1430
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:49,609
Well.

1431
01:26:49,609 --> 01:26:50,609
What is this floating?

1432
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,739
Is there anything else in here that I need to see?

1433
01:26:57,739 --> 01:27:01,060
I feel like I'm gonna be missing a lot of secrets if I just blast through.

1434
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:02,060
So give me one second.

1435
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:07,590
Nothing?

1436
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:15,779
I mean, what about the janitor?

1437
01:27:15,779 --> 01:27:21,359
No.

1438
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:22,359
No secrets.

1439
01:27:22,359 --> 01:27:33,260
Whatever.

1440
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:34,260
I'm gonna miss the secrets.

1441
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:35,260
This is my first playthrough.

1442
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:40,939
Did I actually miss a secret?

1443
01:27:40,939 --> 01:27:42,659
I feel like I'm gonna get a fairly good score on this one.

1444
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:44,380
I only died like two or three times.

1445
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:50,600
Right?

1446
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,600
That's probably gonna be...

1447
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,840
Alright.

1448
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,840
I'll take it.

1449
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,279
That's fine.

1450
01:27:58,279 --> 01:28:00,420
Dying doesn't matter.

1451
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:01,420
Okay.

1452
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:04,189
George the Giraffe.

1453
01:28:04,189 --> 01:28:06,390
This game's three times and I've never found a secret.

1454
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:09,039
Here we go.

1455
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:10,039
This guy again.

1456
01:28:10,039 --> 01:28:11,979
Hey, man!

1457
01:28:11,979 --> 01:28:13,979
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1458
01:28:13,979 --> 01:28:16,909
Have you been following the news about the killings?

1459
01:28:16,909 --> 01:28:17,909
Now, this is top secret.

1460
01:28:17,909 --> 01:28:18,909
You can't tell anyone.

1461
01:28:18,909 --> 01:28:21,310
But I have a friend who's in the police force.

1462
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:24,149
He told me there's rumors going around.

1463
01:28:24,149 --> 01:28:26,029
There could be more than one perp.

1464
01:28:26,029 --> 01:28:27,029
Maybe a whole bunch.

1465
01:28:27,029 --> 01:28:30,869
A group of people wearing masks killing Russians.

1466
01:28:30,869 --> 01:28:32,909
It's like it's from a movie or something, right?

1467
01:28:32,909 --> 01:28:34,510
Well, I think it's fascinating.

1468
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:35,510
Right?

1469
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:36,510
So just grab any movie you want.

1470
01:28:36,869 --> 01:28:37,869
It's on the house.

1471
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:43,420
Okay, I want this one.

1472
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:45,619
No.

1473
01:28:45,619 --> 01:28:46,619
Any movie.

1474
01:28:46,619 --> 01:28:47,619
And I have to take this.

1475
01:28:47,619 --> 01:29:01,380
I have to take that movie.

1476
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:02,380
So we're now what?

1477
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:05,579
A little more than a month and a half from the start of the game.

1478
01:29:05,579 --> 01:29:06,579
April.

1479
01:29:06,579 --> 01:29:10,829
Right?

1480
01:29:10,829 --> 01:29:11,829
This girl is still here.

1481
01:29:11,829 --> 01:29:18,000
Harry!

1482
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,199
For management, we have a problem.

1483
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:26,239
This big mess over by the condos on 122nd S.E. Street, one of the president's...

1484
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:29,560
One of the president's water pipe burst.

1485
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:30,560
Wet all over.

1486
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:33,119
The whole building is going to be flooded soon.

1487
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:35,680
Hope you can get on this shit as soon as possible.

1488
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,840
Don't go easy on the mob.

1489
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:51,109
Quick.

1490
01:29:51,109 --> 01:29:52,109
Neighbors.

1491
01:29:52,109 --> 01:29:56,010
Start with a knife.

1492
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:57,010
Look further.

1493
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:58,569
All right, George.

1494
01:29:58,569 --> 01:29:59,569
That sounds...

1495
01:29:59,569 --> 01:30:02,340
Well, George is the best item in the game.

1496
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:06,100
I mean, that's the best item in the whole game.

1497
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,100
In my honest opinion.

1498
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:13,939
Got two guys with guns.

1499
01:30:13,939 --> 01:30:15,340
There's a broom right there.

1500
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:16,340
All right.

1501
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:17,340
That's my opportunity to...

1502
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:18,979
I could probably sneak in.

1503
01:30:18,979 --> 01:30:19,979
All right.

1504
01:30:19,979 --> 01:30:21,930
Sneak into here.

1505
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:23,090
Sneak in here.

1506
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:24,090
Punch this guy.

1507
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:25,090
Kill guy.

1508
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:26,090
Take gun.

1509
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,090
Shoot guy.

1510
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:38,180
Shoot guy.

1511
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:39,180
One, two, three, action.

1512
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:40,680
Nice and fucking clean.

1513
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:41,680
What?

1514
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:42,680
Oh, that guy.

1515
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:48,979
Okay.

1516
01:30:48,979 --> 01:30:49,979
I got to turn on punch that guy.

1517
01:30:49,979 --> 01:31:00,479
All right.

1518
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:01,479
Don't use the gun.

1519
01:31:01,479 --> 01:31:05,539
I don't think I need to.

1520
01:31:05,539 --> 01:31:06,539
Actually.

1521
01:31:06,539 --> 01:31:07,539
I think I have to shoot, don't I?

1522
01:31:07,539 --> 01:31:08,970
Maybe not.

1523
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:13,149
Oh, fuck.

1524
01:31:13,149 --> 01:31:14,149
Mistake.

1525
01:31:14,149 --> 01:31:21,149
Fuck.

1526
01:31:21,149 --> 01:31:24,119
Is that guy still alive?

1527
01:31:24,119 --> 01:31:28,689
Don't.

1528
01:31:28,689 --> 01:31:36,390
Give me this thing.

1529
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:37,390
No more bullets in this thing.

1530
01:31:37,390 --> 01:31:45,989
Give me...

1531
01:31:45,989 --> 01:32:02,850
All right.

1532
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:03,850
Let's go.

1533
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:11,680
Let's go.

1534
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:12,840
Let's go.

1535
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:17,920
Let's go.

1536
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:23,640
I'm doing it.

1537
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:24,939
Secrets.

1538
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:25,939
Ooh.

1539
01:32:25,939 --> 01:32:29,550
That's a new gun.

1540
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:30,550
Is this my first playthrough?

1541
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:31,550
Yes, it is.

1542
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:32,550
It's the first time I've ever played the game.

1543
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:36,609
All right.

1544
01:32:36,609 --> 01:32:37,609
We got one dog.

1545
01:32:37,609 --> 01:32:38,609
There's more than...

1546
01:32:38,609 --> 01:32:39,609
No, there's only one dog.

1547
01:32:39,609 --> 01:32:41,609
Two guys at the front door.

1548
01:32:41,609 --> 01:32:46,689
Holy fucking hell.

1549
01:32:46,689 --> 01:32:50,890
Oh, I thought that was a door.

1550
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:53,979
Shit.

1551
01:32:53,979 --> 01:32:54,979
Fuck.

1552
01:32:54,979 --> 01:32:59,170
Dog.

1553
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:06,619
I should have backed up.

1554
01:33:06,619 --> 01:33:16,880
What the fuck?

1555
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:22,279
We got one bullet.

1556
01:33:22,279 --> 01:33:24,279
Fucking DPI on the Razor Deathadder.

1557
01:33:24,279 --> 01:33:45,739
Please.

1558
01:33:45,739 --> 01:33:46,739
Let me see.

1559
01:33:46,899 --> 01:33:47,899
What?

1560
01:33:47,899 --> 01:33:50,039
All right.

1561
01:33:50,039 --> 01:33:51,039
Here we go.

1562
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:52,789
I have to shoot this guy.

1563
01:33:52,789 --> 01:33:53,789
I can't fuck this up.

1564
01:33:53,789 --> 01:33:54,789
All right.

1565
01:33:54,789 --> 01:33:55,789
Easy.

1566
01:33:55,789 --> 01:33:56,789
That door's closed.

1567
01:33:56,789 --> 01:33:58,930
Here's this guy.

1568
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:02,220
One, two, three.

1569
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,220
Got him.

1570
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:04,220
Last guy.

1571
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:12,050
All right.

1572
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:13,050
Good.

1573
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:14,050
Anything else?

1574
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:15,050
We're going to go with the...

1575
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:19,489
No.

1576
01:34:19,489 --> 01:34:20,489
I'm going with at least three rounds in this shotgun here.

1577
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:21,489
We got one, two, three, four.

1578
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:22,489
I think I can get them all.

1579
01:34:22,489 --> 01:34:23,489
Ready?

1580
01:34:23,489 --> 01:34:34,899
Here we go.

1581
01:34:34,899 --> 01:34:35,899
One, two, three.

1582
01:34:35,899 --> 01:34:44,250
Action.

1583
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:45,250
Oh my god.

1584
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,250
I was trying to fuck.

1585
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:53,439
Oh, I'm trying to pick up the gun on the ground.

1586
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:58,840
Motherfucker.

1587
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:13,069
What the hell?

1588
01:35:13,229 --> 01:35:14,229
What are you going to...

1589
01:35:14,229 --> 01:35:16,229
Honestly, did he not die from being shot by the gun?

1590
01:35:16,229 --> 01:35:20,250
What the fuck was that?

1591
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:21,250
Oops.

1592
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:22,250
I'm going all the way out.

1593
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:23,250
Okay.

1594
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:28,579
Wait.

1595
01:35:28,579 --> 01:35:29,579
What?

1596
01:35:29,579 --> 01:35:30,579
Oh, that's it.

1597
01:35:30,579 --> 01:35:35,920
I bit it.

1598
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:36,920
Yeah.

1599
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:37,920
So wait.

1600
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,920
You shot a door and the door knocked the guy down so he didn't die.

1601
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,479
Oh, well fuck.

1602
01:35:41,479 --> 01:35:42,479
So any secrets?

1603
01:35:42,479 --> 01:35:57,420
Okay.

1604
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:00,850
Am I losing my mind right now?

1605
01:36:00,850 --> 01:36:01,850
What is going on?

1606
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:26,100
What the fuck?

1607
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:27,319
Last guy.

1608
01:36:27,319 --> 01:36:28,319
Make it quick.

1609
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:34,039
Make it easy.

1610
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:38,800
Phone's ringing.

1611
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:39,800
There's been a small change of plans.

1612
01:36:40,619 --> 01:36:42,119
We have a prank caller at the telephone company.

1613
01:36:42,119 --> 01:36:47,529
Why don't you go there and see if you can talk some sense with him.

1614
01:36:47,529 --> 01:36:49,439
You know what I mean?

1615
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:50,439
Go there now, Florida.

1616
01:36:50,439 --> 01:36:52,760
Okay.

1617
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:53,760
Can I have it?

1618
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,760
Give me a new gun.

1619
01:36:54,760 --> 01:37:10,920
This one.

1620
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:11,920
Oh, wait.

1621
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:12,920
We're not done.

1622
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:16,439
We're just going.

1623
01:37:16,439 --> 01:37:17,439
Uh oh.

1624
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:25,279
Phone mom.

1625
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:26,279
Okay.

1626
01:37:26,279 --> 01:37:27,279
Are there any items on the ground?

1627
01:37:27,279 --> 01:37:29,399
Can I go in there with a weapon?

1628
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:38,560
Is this a boss or something?

1629
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:44,100
They want me to get the giant Mega Man gun.

1630
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,100
That's like a giant machine gun.

1631
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,100
Okay.

1632
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:47,180
Okay.

1633
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:57,189
How am I going to hold that?

1634
01:37:57,189 --> 01:37:59,640
Hello?

1635
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,039
You're dead meat.

1636
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:03,039
Alright.

1637
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:14,500
Give me the gun.

1638
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,500
I got the...

1639
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:16,500
It's not a gun.

1640
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:17,500
It's...

1641
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,659
In fact, it's a set of golf clubs.

1642
01:38:19,659 --> 01:38:33,359
Oh my god.

1643
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:34,760
Oh my god.

1644
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:37,039
I need a fucking golf club.

1645
01:38:37,039 --> 01:38:38,039
What is this?

1646
01:38:38,039 --> 01:38:45,289
I understand.

1647
01:38:45,289 --> 01:38:46,770
You got to go after he swings.

1648
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:50,229
Oh, but I fucking got cornered.

1649
01:38:50,229 --> 01:39:13,039
Oh shit.

1650
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:14,039
Oh shit.

1651
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:15,039
I got him.

1652
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:16,039
I beat him.

1653
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:17,039
No, I didn't.

1654
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:30,869
What am I thinking?

1655
01:39:30,869 --> 01:39:31,869
Oh.

1656
01:39:32,029 --> 01:39:33,029
I'm so fucking nervous.

1657
01:39:33,029 --> 01:39:38,329
Why did it not lock onto him?

1658
01:39:38,329 --> 01:39:39,329
Okay.

1659
01:39:39,329 --> 01:39:49,279
Do it again.

1660
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:50,279
What's what the fucking corner there?

1661
01:39:50,279 --> 01:39:51,279
What?

1662
01:39:51,279 --> 01:39:52,279
He spins around you.

1663
01:39:52,279 --> 01:39:53,279
Why was he just walking with me?

1664
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:58,399
Oh.

1665
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:13,449
I throw and it just went face through his body.

1666
01:40:13,449 --> 01:40:19,939
Holy fuck.

1667
01:40:19,939 --> 01:40:24,760
Throw it.

1668
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:28,050
This can't be happening.

1669
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:29,289
It can't end now.

1670
01:40:29,289 --> 01:40:31,680
Not like this.

1671
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:32,680
I'm so close.

1672
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:41,350
Holy shit.

1673
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:45,210
Okay.

1674
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:46,210
Well, I did it.

1675
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:58,890
It was only two hits.

1676
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:14,159
That was anxiety-causing.

1677
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:18,449
You don't even know what you did.

1678
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:23,289
116 total deaths.

1679
01:41:23,289 --> 01:41:24,289
That seems like a lot.

1680
01:41:24,289 --> 01:41:26,300
All right.

1681
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:31,420
So what's a typical total deaths for an entire play through for a first try?

1682
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:38,199
I got Ted.

1683
01:41:38,199 --> 01:41:39,199
About 15.

1684
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:40,880
Interesting.

1685
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:45,069
Machete.

1686
01:41:45,069 --> 01:41:53,840
We really should be playing Fortnite now.

1687
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:57,359
No, we shouldn't.

1688
01:41:57,359 --> 01:41:58,359
I even installed it too.

1689
01:41:58,359 --> 01:41:59,359
What the hell?

1690
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:00,359
Why would I even do that?

1691
01:42:00,359 --> 01:42:01,359
What a waste of internet.

1692
01:42:01,359 --> 01:42:03,239
I'm not going to do it.

1693
01:42:03,239 --> 01:42:04,239
I'm never going to play it.

1694
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:05,600
I'm just going to uninstall it.

1695
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:06,600
Welcome back, sir.

1696
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:07,600
How are you tonight?

1697
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:08,600
I look so happy.

1698
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:10,520
To be honest, I don't feel too good either.

1699
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,520
Something in the air.

1700
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:12,949
I don't know.

1701
01:42:12,949 --> 01:42:16,630
I just have this really bad feeling like something terrible has happened tonight.

1702
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:18,670
I haven't felt this way since San Francisco.

1703
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:20,350
I don't like it, but not one bit.

1704
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:22,510
So how about a drink?

1705
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:33,609
Yeah, before the stream started, we were joking in the chat saying things like, if

1706
01:42:33,609 --> 01:42:40,029
I turn on Fortnite, even as a joke, I will lose probably 1,500 viewers.

1707
01:42:40,029 --> 01:42:41,149
And then the argument was made.

1708
01:42:41,149 --> 01:42:45,430
But what about the potential 3,000 or 4,000 that you'll gain?

1709
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:47,750
And I don't even know what to do about that.

1710
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:49,109
I don't think I would want that to happen.

1711
01:42:49,109 --> 01:43:03,539
I don't think I want that.

1712
01:43:03,539 --> 01:43:05,500
So you came back.

1713
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:06,500
How are you feeling?

1714
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:07,500
You look ill.

1715
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:08,500
Maybe you should see a doctor.

1716
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:11,520
I told you not to come back here.

1717
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,520
I see that my opinion of you doesn't matter.

1718
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:16,239
If you insist on returning here, then I should leave.

1719
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:19,189
Have you thought about what I asked you last time?

1720
01:43:19,189 --> 01:43:21,390
I'm not here to give you any answers.

1721
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:27,520
If you're not feeling well, maybe you should rest.

1722
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:32,079
Some things work out best when you don't try so hard, and no matter who you are,

1723
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:36,600
bearing too much weight inevitably leads to the collapse of everything.

1724
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,159
Next time we meet, we'll be the last.

1725
01:43:39,159 --> 01:43:43,369
I can see it in your eyes.

1726
01:43:43,369 --> 01:43:47,960
Before you go, I'll leave you with three predictions.

1727
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:50,560
Someone you know is not who you think he is.

1728
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,920
Something will soon be taken from you.

1729
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:56,199
On July the 21st, you will wake up in a bigger house.

1730
01:43:56,199 --> 01:43:57,199
Okay.

1731
01:43:57,199 --> 01:43:59,979
Alright, where's um...

1732
01:43:59,979 --> 01:44:09,090
Let's just go.

1733
01:44:09,090 --> 01:44:13,100
Hi, it's Pat from the club.

1734
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:15,180
We want you to DJ tonight.

1735
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:17,220
You're free to play any kind of music you want.

1736
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:19,659
Beer is on the house.

1737
01:44:19,659 --> 01:44:31,010
Dressed to kill, see ya.

1738
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:38,039
Why is she wearing the matching colors of the Nintendo?

1739
01:44:38,039 --> 01:44:40,399
That's such like a streamer thing to do.

1740
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:43,300
You know what I mean?

1741
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:54,180
Like, look, I'm wearing the colors of the thing that's in my room!

1742
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:59,000
Like imagine if my character was dressed up in like, this color scheme, and there

1743
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:06,239
was a webcam on me.

1744
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:24,430
Drink from the sink.

1745
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:27,140
Push it!

1746
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:28,819
Dermot would do that if he had the foresight.

1747
01:45:28,819 --> 01:45:29,939
That's probably why he would.

1748
01:45:29,939 --> 01:45:30,939
Dogs don't attack.

1749
01:45:30,939 --> 01:45:32,239
Yup.

1750
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:33,239
I don't give a shit.

1751
01:45:33,239 --> 01:45:34,560
Well, why would there be dogs here?

1752
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,319
Oh, there are dogs here.

1753
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:47,989
So the dogs don't do anything.

1754
01:45:47,989 --> 01:45:48,989
That's...

1755
01:45:48,989 --> 01:45:53,670
Okay, I might have to keep that on permanently.

1756
01:45:53,670 --> 01:45:54,949
Holy fuck.

1757
01:45:54,949 --> 01:45:55,949
Where did you...

1758
01:45:55,949 --> 01:45:56,949
Okay.

1759
01:45:56,949 --> 01:45:57,949
Through the glass apparently.

1760
01:45:57,949 --> 01:46:06,979
Yeah, that's what we call a fucking triple.

1761
01:46:06,979 --> 01:46:23,840
That's what we call getting it done.

1762
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,439
Only one more guy down here.

1763
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:43,399
He's got a knife.

1764
01:46:43,399 --> 01:46:45,920
Who's left?

1765
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:46,920
Was it somebody left?

1766
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:55,770
Who's left?

1767
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:56,770
Wait, I have to...

1768
01:46:56,770 --> 01:46:59,619
I have to kill the dogs even though they're friendly?

1769
01:46:59,619 --> 01:47:02,649
Oh boy, okay.

1770
01:47:02,649 --> 01:47:06,470
Um, that's not very nice.

1771
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:11,880
I have this special dog mask on.

1772
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:13,439
Brain gun.

1773
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:20,340
I'm gonna go...

1774
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:32,069
Left room is more dangerous, I think, in my personal opinion.

1775
01:47:32,069 --> 01:47:33,069
Why is a dog coming over here?

1776
01:47:33,069 --> 01:47:37,760
No bullets.

1777
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:38,760
No bullets.

1778
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:47,109
No bullets.

1779
01:47:47,109 --> 01:47:48,109
Oh, you fucking...

1780
01:47:48,109 --> 01:47:49,109
There was another guy pretending to be dead on the ground.

1781
01:47:49,109 --> 01:47:51,819
Give me a break.

1782
01:47:51,819 --> 01:47:57,159
What am I doing?

1783
01:47:57,159 --> 01:47:58,590
What?

1784
01:47:58,590 --> 01:48:00,020
How did I do that?

1785
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:13,289
That just threw me off.

1786
01:48:13,289 --> 01:48:14,289
Watch out.

1787
01:48:14,289 --> 01:48:28,199
Watch out.

1788
01:48:28,199 --> 01:48:29,199
Watch out.

1789
01:48:29,199 --> 01:48:33,199
He's gonna come in here.

1790
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:34,199
Why?

1791
01:48:34,199 --> 01:48:48,699
Why are you throwing them?

1792
01:48:48,699 --> 01:48:49,699
Oh, fuck me, man.

1793
01:48:49,699 --> 01:48:50,699
Can I pick it up?

1794
01:48:50,699 --> 01:48:51,699
Get them both.

1795
01:48:51,699 --> 01:48:54,350
One, two, three.

1796
01:48:54,350 --> 01:48:55,350
I didn't...

1797
01:49:00,819 --> 01:49:01,819
I didn't...

1798
01:49:01,819 --> 01:49:02,819
I thought it was just the dogs left.

1799
01:49:02,819 --> 01:49:04,300
I thought it was just the dogs.

1800
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:05,300
That's why I ran through there.

1801
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:06,300
Oh, man.

1802
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:07,479
I'm so...

1803
01:49:07,479 --> 01:49:08,479
God.

1804
01:49:08,479 --> 01:49:27,319
I just thought the dogs were left.

1805
01:49:27,319 --> 01:49:28,319
Give me a fucking break.

1806
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:29,319
He was locked onto.

1807
01:49:29,319 --> 01:49:30,319
Unbelievable.

1808
01:49:30,319 --> 01:49:36,039
No, I don't want to pick the guy up.

1809
01:49:36,039 --> 01:49:46,960
Just get rid of the dogs now so I don't have to think about this later.

1810
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:47,960
Why was he not dead?

1811
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:54,680
I'm not gonna forget about that guy now.

1812
01:49:54,680 --> 01:50:08,720
Who's left?

1813
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:09,720
One guy right there.

1814
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:10,720
Bingo.

1815
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:19,649
One, two, three.

1816
01:50:19,649 --> 01:50:20,649
Bug wasn't there.

1817
01:50:21,369 --> 01:50:22,369
I thought the dog wasn't there.

1818
01:50:22,369 --> 01:50:29,770
I thought it was just the dogs.

1819
01:50:29,770 --> 01:50:40,039
Is that it?

1820
01:50:40,039 --> 01:50:42,600
Well, they both had the same idea, apparently.

1821
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:58,680
Get off of him.

1822
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:10,420
All right, is there a way that I can jump off somebody?

1823
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:11,420
Hey, guess what I did.

1824
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:14,850
I hit the fucking DPI button on the mouse again.

1825
01:51:14,850 --> 01:51:36,439
Fuck this.

1826
01:51:36,439 --> 01:51:41,409
All right, let me disable it.

1827
01:51:41,409 --> 01:51:47,100
I think I have to download the, like, virus software to disable that, don't I?

1828
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:52,279
Don't I have to get, like, Razer's virus shitty Synapse program thing to do that?

1829
01:51:53,000 --> 01:52:06,760
Turn it off, you nuts.

1830
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:12,239
All right, that's it over here.

1831
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:13,239
Two guys down there.

1832
01:52:13,239 --> 01:52:14,239
Nope, a guy in the bathroom.

1833
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:20,350
I want to go in there with the super shotgun.

1834
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:21,350
Nobody on the DJ floor?

1835
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:22,520
Okay.

1836
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:25,239
Go.

1837
01:52:25,239 --> 01:52:26,239
Just solder it.

1838
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:29,239
Holy fuck, I was talking and I almost just ran into death.

1839
01:52:29,239 --> 01:52:47,050
Go to the car.

1840
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:53,810
Wait, did I just go back up the stairs?

1841
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:56,630
I did, didn't I?

1842
01:52:56,630 --> 01:52:57,630
Fuck me.

1843
01:52:57,630 --> 01:53:11,729
Mask, mask.

1844
01:53:11,729 --> 01:53:12,729
What?

1845
01:53:12,729 --> 01:53:13,729
I, I, whatever.

1846
01:53:14,449 --> 01:53:23,479
I didn't pick up the mask, but read chat.

1847
01:53:23,479 --> 01:53:25,479
All right, let me tell you something.

1848
01:53:25,479 --> 01:53:32,119
When I'm in the middle of an insane game where you have to focus 1000%, I can't look

1849
01:53:32,119 --> 01:53:37,520
over here.

1850
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:48,460
I can look over here like now.

1851
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:49,460
Level was over.

1852
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:50,460
Who cares?

1853
01:53:50,460 --> 01:54:03,869
That mask sucks anyways.

1854
01:54:03,869 --> 01:54:05,880
How do I know?

1855
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:06,880
It's easy.

1856
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:09,800
Because Leather Jacket just told me and he's in the game.

1857
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:29,340
He's right here.

1858
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:31,979
What you just saw now did not actually happen.

1859
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:37,060
If you don't even, you don't look like you believe me, then allow me to demonstrate.

1860
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:42,399
Hey, man.

1861
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:43,399
Nice to see you.

1862
01:54:43,399 --> 01:54:45,439
Friendly faces are few and far between these days.

1863
01:54:45,439 --> 01:54:46,439
Just take what you want.

1864
01:54:46,439 --> 01:54:47,439
My treat.

1865
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:48,439
Have a good night.

1866
01:54:48,439 --> 01:54:51,000
Am I living in a simulation?

1867
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:56,760
I think this is a weird simulation game.

1868
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:10,739
You have one new message.

1869
01:55:10,739 --> 01:55:12,859
Hi, this is Rick from the real estate office.

1870
01:55:12,859 --> 01:55:15,579
This is showing for an apartment downtown today.

1871
01:55:15,579 --> 01:55:18,899
It's at Southwest Street 35 open house.

1872
01:55:18,899 --> 01:55:28,520
Just swing on by when you have the time.

1873
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:31,159
Get the mask.

1874
01:55:31,159 --> 01:55:33,119
I'm not going to get the mask.

1875
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:34,119
It doesn't matter.

1876
01:55:34,119 --> 01:55:35,119
I'm just playing the game.

1877
01:55:35,119 --> 01:55:42,960
I'm not going to peek my microphone.

1878
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:43,960
Survive.

1879
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:44,960
One bullet.

1880
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:47,529
I kind of like the dog zone attack thing though.

1881
01:55:47,529 --> 01:55:53,189
Walk fast.

1882
01:55:53,189 --> 01:55:54,189
Lethal doors.

1883
01:55:54,189 --> 01:55:55,189
More guns.

1884
01:55:55,189 --> 01:55:56,189
Fists of fury.

1885
01:55:56,189 --> 01:55:57,189
I like this one.

1886
01:55:57,189 --> 01:56:09,630
Let's try this one again.

1887
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:10,800
Holy shit.

1888
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:11,800
Two guys.

1889
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:12,800
And a dog.

1890
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:13,800
Whoa.

1891
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:16,199
Alright, we're fine.

1892
01:56:16,199 --> 01:56:19,390
There's only one guy left in this room, but he has a gun.

1893
01:56:19,390 --> 01:56:20,390
Make it count.

1894
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:21,390
Make it count.

1895
01:56:21,390 --> 01:56:22,390
One, two, three.

1896
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:23,510
You didn't make it count.

1897
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:41,199
You didn't do it.

1898
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:42,199
Oh my lord.

1899
01:56:42,199 --> 01:56:48,729
Man, the dog's not attacking thing.

1900
01:56:48,729 --> 01:56:50,609
It's seriously so good.

1901
01:56:50,609 --> 01:56:51,609
It's so good.

1902
01:56:51,609 --> 01:57:00,600
I don't even want to pick up a melee weapon because I'm going to kill instantly.

1903
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:06,920
But I mean, a little bait that guy over here.

1904
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:07,920
Dogs are so erratic.

1905
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:15,569
I thought the other guy down there didn't have a gun.

1906
01:57:15,569 --> 01:57:25,069
Fuck.

1907
01:57:25,069 --> 01:57:28,159
Tried a different approach.

1908
01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:29,159
I had it.

1909
01:57:29,159 --> 01:57:36,289
I can get it.

1910
01:57:36,289 --> 01:57:37,289
Alright, no.

1911
01:57:37,289 --> 01:57:38,729
I'm not the fuck I'm going to do about this.

1912
01:57:38,729 --> 01:57:39,729
Pull Q.

1913
01:57:44,979 --> 01:57:46,500
If I poke my head in here, I'm dead.

1914
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:50,159
I've got to be careful because he's just facing this way.

1915
01:57:50,159 --> 01:57:51,159
Got it.

1916
01:57:51,159 --> 01:57:55,319
Alright, now I've got a gun.

1917
01:57:55,319 --> 01:57:57,489
We can go...

1918
01:57:57,489 --> 01:57:58,489
Watch out.

1919
01:57:58,489 --> 01:58:00,899
I can get three here, probably.

1920
01:58:00,899 --> 01:58:02,819
I hate everything about what I just did.

1921
01:58:02,819 --> 01:58:15,859
There's no bullets in this gun.

1922
01:58:15,859 --> 01:58:25,119
Oh, there's no bullets in that gun.

1923
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:26,119
Where did that guy go?

1924
01:58:26,119 --> 01:58:31,680
Opportunity right there.

1925
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:40,039
I'm going to get picked off by somebody who's going to peek a corner and I'm

1926
01:58:40,039 --> 01:58:43,840
going to die.

1927
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:44,840
Alright, I'm going to door the guy, punch him.

1928
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:45,840
Any of you guys?

1929
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:46,840
Nobody?

1930
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:47,840
No?

1931
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:56,609
Okay, let me tell you something.

1932
01:58:56,609 --> 01:59:00,010
You press the space bar on somebody and try to break their skull and sometimes just a

1933
01:59:00,010 --> 01:59:01,010
dumb one do it.

1934
01:59:01,010 --> 01:59:16,140
I'm trying to rush.

1935
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:22,439
It's not going to happen.

1936
01:59:22,439 --> 01:59:24,399
It's not going to fucking happen.

1937
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:25,399
Stop doing that.

1938
01:59:25,399 --> 01:59:35,279
I didn't kill them both with that?

1939
01:59:35,279 --> 01:59:45,409
Is he dead?

1940
01:59:45,409 --> 01:59:47,100
Yeah.

1941
01:59:47,100 --> 01:59:48,100
Dog, dog, dog.

1942
01:59:48,100 --> 02:00:03,800
Dog!

1943
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:04,800
The fucking...

1944
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:05,800
Honest to God.

1945
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:06,800
The fucking door.

1946
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:07,800
And the door...

1947
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:10,760
The door saved them both with two bullets.

1948
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:11,760
The fucking door.

1949
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,800
Do you know?

1950
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:14,800
You ever heard about a door before?

1951
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:18,819
Guys, have you ever seen a door in your life?

1952
02:00:18,819 --> 02:00:34,460
Alright, got it.

1953
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:40,270
Who the fuck are you guys?

1954
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:42,020
What?

1955
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:43,020
What's happening?

1956
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:48,289
How do I get out?

1957
02:00:48,289 --> 02:00:49,289
I got to get out of here.

1958
02:00:49,289 --> 02:00:50,289
The guy has a laser beam.

1959
02:00:50,289 --> 02:00:51,289
That guy has a laser.

1960
02:00:51,289 --> 02:00:54,770
What am I supposed to do about this?

1961
02:00:54,770 --> 02:00:58,119
Um...

1962
02:00:58,119 --> 02:01:07,680
Oh my God.

1963
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:09,439
I'm so defeated from that.

1964
02:01:09,439 --> 02:01:18,039
That sucks.

1965
02:01:18,039 --> 02:01:20,039
I'm actually defeated.

1966
02:01:20,039 --> 02:01:24,649
I feel terrible right now.

1967
02:01:24,649 --> 02:01:41,960
How did you pick that up, you fucking idiot?

1968
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:43,960
Wait, I'm just trying to rush it now.

1969
02:01:43,960 --> 02:02:02,020
There's a dog.

1970
02:02:02,020 --> 02:02:03,020
What the fuck?

1971
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:04,020
Oh, come on.

1972
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:07,020
Oh, come on.

1973
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:11,840
Motherfucker.

1974
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:12,840
Give me a break.

1975
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:28,270
Are there any more bullets?

1976
02:02:28,270 --> 02:02:30,270
This is the guy that killed me every time.

1977
02:02:30,270 --> 02:02:39,359
Nobody comes up here, right?

1978
02:02:39,359 --> 02:03:03,920
Fuck, he can see me through the glass!

1979
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:04,920
What the...

1980
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:05,920
No!

1981
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:11,060
What the fuck?

1982
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:13,060
Oh my fucking God!

1983
02:03:13,060 --> 02:03:44,569
Damn it!

1984
02:03:44,569 --> 02:03:45,569
Fuck the dog.

1985
02:03:45,569 --> 02:03:47,000
Fuck you, dog.

1986
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
What the hell happened to my body and my brain?

1987
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,039
No!

1988
02:03:52,039 --> 02:04:04,029
No!

1989
02:04:04,029 --> 02:04:05,720
No!

1990
02:04:08,109 --> 02:04:09,109
I don't...

1991
02:04:09,109 --> 02:04:11,109
Why do I have to do this whole thing again?

1992
02:04:11,109 --> 02:04:16,140
You give such great checkpoints and then all of a sudden, like, the fucking entire police

1993
02:04:16,140 --> 02:04:18,859
force shows up and you just have to start the whole thing over.

1994
02:04:18,859 --> 02:04:32,199
Fuck.

1995
02:04:32,199 --> 02:04:36,699
I'm losing it now.

1996
02:04:36,699 --> 02:04:38,699
I'm like just exhausted.

1997
02:04:38,699 --> 02:04:39,699
Fucking hell.

1998
02:04:39,699 --> 02:04:47,020
Fuck the gun.

1999
02:04:47,020 --> 02:05:09,380
There's no more bullets in that fucking thing.

2000
02:05:09,380 --> 02:05:10,380
Dogs.

2001
02:05:10,380 --> 02:05:11,880
No, no.

2002
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:12,880
Time to leave, right?

2003
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:15,649
The police are here, right?

2004
02:05:15,649 --> 02:05:16,649
How do I get out of here?

2005
02:05:16,649 --> 02:05:17,649
Where's the exit?

2006
02:05:17,649 --> 02:05:19,079
But where's the exit, though?

2007
02:05:19,079 --> 02:05:21,079
I don't know where the fucking exit is.

2008
02:05:21,079 --> 02:05:23,079
Oh my God, why does this exist?

2009
02:05:23,079 --> 02:05:25,840
Holy shit, I actually made a checkpoint.

2010
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:35,819
Oh my God, I actually made a checkpoint by leaving the fucking room.

2011
02:05:35,819 --> 02:05:36,819
Oh.

2012
02:05:36,819 --> 02:05:52,310
Oh my goodness gracious, that was fucking too much.

2013
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:53,310
Calm down.

2014
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:54,310
How are you supposed to calm down?

2015
02:05:54,310 --> 02:05:55,310
Where I...

2016
02:05:55,310 --> 02:06:00,310
I would have had, in my brain, I'm starting the entire level over again if I lose there.

2017
02:06:00,310 --> 02:06:04,789
Hey, dude, calm down.

2018
02:06:04,789 --> 02:06:08,350
You almost just had to do the whole thing over again after doing it.

2019
02:06:08,350 --> 02:06:23,029
Chat is gone, okay?

2020
02:06:23,029 --> 02:06:25,930
Makes perfect sense.

2021
02:06:25,930 --> 02:06:26,930
All right, there we go.

2022
02:06:26,930 --> 02:06:38,199
I don't know why that happened.

2023
02:06:38,199 --> 02:06:45,270
Hey, what do you want?

2024
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:48,760
I know our friend looks like he's dead over there.

2025
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:51,220
Could you hurry up?

2026
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:52,220
We're closing soon.

2027
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:56,420
I usually get shit here for free.

2028
02:06:56,420 --> 02:06:58,420
Is that not a thing anymore?

2029
02:06:58,420 --> 02:07:05,369
I'm gonna have to throw a flag on that round.

2030
02:07:05,369 --> 02:07:09,529
Come on, that was fucking hard.

2031
02:07:09,529 --> 02:07:10,529
That was no joke.

2032
02:07:10,529 --> 02:07:18,659
Anything else to see?

2033
02:07:18,659 --> 02:07:24,739
Hello there, this is Thomas from the Downtown Relaxation.

2034
02:07:24,739 --> 02:07:27,739
We need you to fill in at the reception tonight.

2035
02:07:27,739 --> 02:07:36,100
One of our employees has called in sick.

2036
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:38,279
Wear something fitting and discreet.

2037
02:07:38,279 --> 02:07:43,329
Okay, let's go.

2038
02:07:43,329 --> 02:07:48,069
Here comes the best song.

2039
02:07:48,069 --> 02:07:51,359
Tenth chapter.

2040
02:07:51,359 --> 02:07:55,789
Hot, hot G-heavy.

2041
02:07:55,789 --> 02:08:04,579
All right, how about extra ammo?

2042
02:08:04,579 --> 02:08:05,579
Let's try extra ammo.

2043
02:08:05,579 --> 02:08:15,500
Anybody down the hall?

2044
02:08:15,500 --> 02:08:18,510
Oh, fucking yeah, there is.

2045
02:08:18,510 --> 02:08:30,630
Okay.

2046
02:08:30,630 --> 02:08:35,130
Hmm.

2047
02:08:35,130 --> 02:08:40,079
Well, I have to bait you guys down here.

2048
02:08:40,079 --> 02:08:41,439
That makes sense.

2049
02:08:41,439 --> 02:08:42,439
I got one of you.

2050
02:08:42,439 --> 02:08:45,579
Guy with a gun comes in.

2051
02:08:45,579 --> 02:08:46,579
Fucking Jesus.

2052
02:08:46,579 --> 02:08:47,579
Okay.

2053
02:08:47,579 --> 02:08:48,579
Maybe I can run up.

2054
02:08:48,579 --> 02:08:50,579
I have an idea.

2055
02:08:50,579 --> 02:08:52,010
Let's see if this works.

2056
02:08:52,010 --> 02:08:54,529
Okay.

2057
02:08:54,529 --> 02:08:57,529
Then this guy's gonna come down with a gun and I can backstab him.

2058
02:08:57,529 --> 02:09:01,560
Or is he not gonna come in here?

2059
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:06,770
Isn't there a guy?

2060
02:09:06,770 --> 02:09:07,770
Yeah, there he is.

2061
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:14,359
Just wait until he comes through and then one, two, three.

2062
02:09:14,359 --> 02:09:17,359
The long fucking animation there.

2063
02:09:17,359 --> 02:09:19,359
That's what I'm gonna do though.

2064
02:09:19,359 --> 02:09:23,069
I probably, I don't even need to wait, to be honest.

2065
02:09:23,069 --> 02:09:28,890
Let's just go wherever he turns the corner.

2066
02:09:28,890 --> 02:09:29,890
All right, where are you at now?

2067
02:09:29,890 --> 02:09:30,890
Come investigate.

2068
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:32,710
All right.

2069
02:09:32,710 --> 02:09:33,710
One guy over there.

2070
02:09:33,710 --> 02:09:35,880
Look, I'll make sure I'm not gonna see the glass.

2071
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:40,130
I'll take a gun.

2072
02:09:40,130 --> 02:09:41,130
More ammo.

2073
02:09:41,130 --> 02:09:42,130
I have the mask on.

2074
02:09:42,130 --> 02:09:43,130
Why am I not using it?

2075
02:09:43,130 --> 02:09:44,130
All right.

2076
02:09:44,130 --> 02:09:45,130
Nobody down?

2077
02:09:45,130 --> 02:09:46,130
Nobody over?

2078
02:09:46,130 --> 02:09:47,130
Okay.

2079
02:09:47,130 --> 02:09:53,880
Yeah, there is a guy there actually.

2080
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:54,880
There's two.

2081
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:55,880
Oh, what the fuck was that?

2082
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:56,880
What was that weird corner bullshit?

2083
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:57,880
What the hell was that?

2084
02:09:57,880 --> 02:09:58,880
What the fuck was that?

2085
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:02,680
Aye, aye, aye.

2086
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:03,680
I missed him.

2087
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:20,069
You know, I got a better idea.

2088
02:10:20,069 --> 02:10:21,069
Would have worked.

2089
02:10:21,069 --> 02:10:28,710
This guy almost got me through the fucking wall.

2090
02:10:28,710 --> 02:10:31,079
He's coming over here apparently.

2091
02:10:31,079 --> 02:10:34,149
I can't go over there.

2092
02:10:34,149 --> 02:10:35,960
All right.

2093
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:36,960
Gun.

2094
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:41,149
Let's go.

2095
02:10:41,149 --> 02:10:42,149
Come on.

2096
02:10:42,149 --> 02:10:43,149
Come on.

2097
02:10:43,149 --> 02:10:53,479
Aye, aye, aye.

2098
02:10:53,479 --> 02:10:55,550
Oh.

2099
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:56,550
Fundamentals here.

2100
02:10:56,550 --> 02:10:57,550
Don't be crazy.

2101
02:10:57,550 --> 02:10:58,550
You have to beat it.

2102
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:06,699
Come on.

2103
02:11:06,699 --> 02:11:07,699
Oh my god, I missed.

2104
02:11:07,699 --> 02:11:25,260
Really?

2105
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:30,789
Is it the last guy?

2106
02:11:30,789 --> 02:11:31,789
I think it might be.

2107
02:11:31,789 --> 02:11:32,789
No.

2108
02:11:32,789 --> 02:11:33,789
There's two guys down here, aren't there?

2109
02:11:33,789 --> 02:11:34,789
Yeah.

2110
02:11:34,789 --> 02:11:35,789
Give me a shotgun for this.

2111
02:11:35,789 --> 02:11:37,159
Eight rounds.

2112
02:11:37,159 --> 02:11:38,159
I'm going to pull.

2113
02:11:38,159 --> 02:11:39,159
Oh, man.

2114
02:11:39,159 --> 02:11:40,159
I got an idea.

2115
02:11:40,159 --> 02:11:44,100
I'm going to shoot through the glass.

2116
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:54,079
Okay, that takes care of those two.

2117
02:11:54,079 --> 02:11:56,899
Don't shoot it again, you dummy.

2118
02:11:56,899 --> 02:12:03,640
My question is, how do I take these guys out?

2119
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:05,880
I'm going to have to pull them through.

2120
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:12,329
I'm going to have to shoot this guy when he comes down, and then hopefully they

2121
02:12:12,329 --> 02:12:13,329
didn't react at all.

2122
02:12:13,329 --> 02:12:14,890
Fuck.

2123
02:12:14,890 --> 02:12:15,890
Oh, no.

2124
02:12:15,890 --> 02:12:16,890
Do I have any grenades?

2125
02:12:16,890 --> 02:12:30,649
I got to be quick.

2126
02:12:30,649 --> 02:12:32,210
Oh.

2127
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:33,520
Oh, no.

2128
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:34,520
Oh, no.

2129
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:38,520
Why are they not moving?

2130
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:40,520
Oh, no.

2131
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:52,060
Again.

2132
02:12:52,060 --> 02:13:11,810
Oh my god, I hate this mouse.

2133
02:13:11,810 --> 02:13:13,810
One bullet hits me.

2134
02:13:13,810 --> 02:13:35,960
All right, slow it down.

2135
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:43,319
I just assumed the guy was going to run through the room when I shot the other guard.

2136
02:13:43,319 --> 02:13:48,319
Why wouldn't the guy run into the room when I shot the guy on the right?

2137
02:13:48,319 --> 02:13:49,319
I don't know.

2138
02:13:49,319 --> 02:14:05,479
Okay.

2139
02:14:05,479 --> 02:14:06,479
I got to get rid of this guy.

2140
02:14:06,479 --> 02:14:07,479
Through the glass.

2141
02:14:07,479 --> 02:14:19,020
What am I doing through the glass?

2142
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:20,020
They aren't friends.

2143
02:14:20,020 --> 02:14:21,020
Yeah, but you wouldn't listen.

2144
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:23,020
You wouldn't hear this and be like, oh, maybe I should not.

2145
02:14:23,020 --> 02:14:24,020
Oh, no.

2146
02:14:24,020 --> 02:14:25,020
I forgot to shoot this guy.

2147
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:26,390
I got to get them both in one shot.

2148
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:32,939
I ran out of bullets again.

2149
02:14:32,939 --> 02:14:39,359
Thank god.

2150
02:14:39,359 --> 02:14:40,359
Okay, let's move.

2151
02:14:40,359 --> 02:14:41,359
I'm going to be down the hall.

2152
02:14:41,359 --> 02:15:02,640
Down window.

2153
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:12,840
Watch out for the wall.

2154
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:13,840
Did I get him?

2155
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:14,840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2156
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:19,399
One up.

2157
02:15:19,399 --> 02:15:26,850
One to the bottom right.

2158
02:15:26,850 --> 02:15:38,279
I'm going to get shot through this window, and I know it.

2159
02:15:39,279 --> 02:15:43,380
Is this the last guy up there?

2160
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:47,689
I'm so paranoid.

2161
02:15:47,689 --> 02:15:52,390
There's a dog.

2162
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:53,390
Dog?

2163
02:15:53,390 --> 02:15:56,609
Guy with a gun.

2164
02:15:56,609 --> 02:15:59,609
Okay, I'm going to go from the top.

2165
02:15:59,609 --> 02:16:14,439
Is there any windows here?

2166
02:16:14,439 --> 02:16:17,439
This is just a guy with like a baton down here, right?

2167
02:16:17,439 --> 02:16:18,439
Right?

2168
02:16:18,439 --> 02:16:19,439
Right, guys?

2169
02:16:19,439 --> 02:16:20,439
Right?

2170
02:16:20,439 --> 02:16:21,439
There's just one guy down here, right?

2171
02:16:21,439 --> 02:16:30,619
Okay, good.

2172
02:16:30,619 --> 02:16:44,340
Right.

2173
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:53,200
Okay.

2174
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,200
Apparently, that's how you do this one.

2175
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:55,690
Oh, it didn't even.

2176
02:16:55,690 --> 02:16:56,690
Fuck it.

2177
02:16:56,690 --> 02:16:57,690
What happened?

2178
02:16:57,690 --> 02:16:59,639
Where am I?

2179
02:16:59,639 --> 02:17:01,770
What?

2180
02:17:01,770 --> 02:17:02,770
God!

2181
02:17:02,770 --> 02:17:12,200
He's not dead.

2182
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:13,200
He's not dead.

2183
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:14,200
He's not dead.

2184
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:17,379
You're shot with a gun, and then you shoot with a shotgun 10 feet away, and you're still

2185
02:17:17,379 --> 02:17:24,190
alive.

2186
02:17:24,190 --> 02:17:45,399
It's happening.

2187
02:17:45,399 --> 02:17:46,399
I can't move.

2188
02:17:46,399 --> 02:17:48,659
I can't fucking move.

2189
02:17:48,659 --> 02:17:49,659
Why can I not move?

2190
02:17:49,659 --> 02:17:52,629
Fuck this.

2191
02:17:52,629 --> 02:18:12,750
How did that guy not die by that?

2192
02:18:12,750 --> 02:18:14,750
I don't understand.

2193
02:18:14,750 --> 02:18:15,750
It was this guy.

2194
02:18:15,750 --> 02:18:16,989
Just run.

2195
02:18:16,989 --> 02:18:17,989
Okay.

2196
02:18:17,989 --> 02:18:34,959
What the fuck?

2197
02:18:34,959 --> 02:18:35,959
Anybody going to get up?

2198
02:18:35,959 --> 02:18:49,000
You sure no one's going to get up?

2199
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Okay.

2200
02:18:50,000 --> 02:19:01,219
What happened?

2201
02:19:01,219 --> 02:19:02,219
Who is this guy?

2202
02:19:02,219 --> 02:19:03,219
What?

2203
02:19:03,219 --> 02:19:04,219
Who is he?

2204
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:06,840
Oh, the door.

2205
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:11,239
The door actually just saved my life.

2206
02:19:11,239 --> 02:19:13,239
I would have been so upset.

2207
02:19:13,239 --> 02:19:20,430
Where did he come from?

2208
02:19:20,430 --> 02:19:23,430
I looked both ways before I crossed the street.

2209
02:19:23,430 --> 02:19:24,430
Why?

2210
02:19:24,430 --> 02:19:25,430
I looked both ways.

2211
02:19:25,430 --> 02:19:26,430
I can't move.

2212
02:19:26,430 --> 02:19:31,290
I looked both ways, too.

2213
02:19:31,290 --> 02:19:33,290
That guy came out of nowhere.

2214
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:39,120
Son of a...

2215
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:46,879
Goodness.

2216
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:49,879
That dog just fucking ate me.

2217
02:19:49,879 --> 02:19:51,879
No.

2218
02:19:51,879 --> 02:19:52,879
Relax.

2219
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:01,840
One more round.

2220
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:04,750
Dog.

2221
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:08,200
Okay.

2222
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:18,540
Let's take a minute here and realize that I'm going to die because I'm going to die.

2223
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:27,590
Fuck.

2224
02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:28,590
Nobody coming this way.

2225
02:20:28,590 --> 02:20:29,590
Right.

2226
02:20:29,590 --> 02:20:42,030
I kept getting collapsed on.

2227
02:20:42,030 --> 02:20:43,030
Okay.

2228
02:20:43,030 --> 02:20:44,719
Give me that gun.

2229
02:20:44,719 --> 02:20:49,799
Fucking razor death batter.

2230
02:20:49,799 --> 02:20:53,510
Did somebody just shoot me from down here?

2231
02:20:53,510 --> 02:20:54,510
Oh.

2232
02:20:54,510 --> 02:20:56,639
All right.

2233
02:20:56,639 --> 02:21:05,500
All right.

2234
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:07,500
Is there like a secret in here that everyone's going to scream at me and get

2235
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:21,260
very angry with me that I don't pick up?

2236
02:21:21,260 --> 02:21:22,260
Guy right here.

2237
02:21:22,260 --> 02:21:25,909
I'm not going to alert anybody.

2238
02:21:25,909 --> 02:21:27,909
In fact, let's see if I can do melee here.

2239
02:21:27,909 --> 02:21:32,129
I need some extra points.

2240
02:21:32,129 --> 02:21:33,129
Oops.

2241
02:21:33,129 --> 02:21:45,870
Well, I didn't know you were going to come over here.

2242
02:21:45,870 --> 02:21:46,870
Okay.

2243
02:21:46,870 --> 02:21:47,870
Up.

2244
02:21:47,870 --> 02:21:50,200
Got the gun.

2245
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:51,200
All right.

2246
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:55,200
I actually need the gun for this because I need to shoot that guy, right?

2247
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,459
Dog.

2248
02:21:57,459 --> 02:21:58,459
Okay.

2249
02:21:58,459 --> 02:21:59,459
The dog.

2250
02:21:59,459 --> 02:22:00,459
You can't hit the dog with the door.

2251
02:22:00,459 --> 02:22:01,459
The dog doesn't get affected by the door.

2252
02:22:01,459 --> 02:22:02,459
Apparently, it's too...

2253
02:22:02,459 --> 02:22:20,229
It's these two small doggos over his head.

2254
02:22:20,229 --> 02:22:22,229
I didn't time it right.

2255
02:22:22,229 --> 02:22:25,770
Do it.

2256
02:22:25,770 --> 02:22:45,510
Kill him.

2257
02:22:45,510 --> 02:22:47,200
Snap his neck.

2258
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:48,200
All right.

2259
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:50,649
Give me the shotgun.

2260
02:22:50,649 --> 02:22:51,649
This...

2261
02:22:51,649 --> 02:22:53,649
These guys over here almost need to go first.

2262
02:22:53,649 --> 02:22:55,209
Fucking dog.

2263
02:22:55,209 --> 02:23:03,239
Fuck.

2264
02:23:03,239 --> 02:23:04,239
Oh my God.

2265
02:23:04,239 --> 02:23:06,239
The same guy just killed me and I'm trying to...

2266
02:23:06,239 --> 02:23:08,239
I'm trying to get to him.

2267
02:23:08,239 --> 02:23:34,780
I'm trying to get to him.

2268
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:35,780
Fucking door, man.

2269
02:23:35,780 --> 02:23:38,360
Break.

2270
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:43,700
This is called...

2271
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:45,700
I'm just going as fast as I can now.

2272
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:52,909
Got to wait till they're together and then they weren't together.

2273
02:23:52,909 --> 02:23:56,360
Just fucking pull them out.

2274
02:23:56,360 --> 02:23:58,360
And what the hell is the dog doing in here now?

2275
02:23:58,360 --> 02:24:09,079
Fucking motherfucker.

2276
02:24:09,079 --> 02:24:10,079
What?

2277
02:24:10,079 --> 02:24:25,280
The last ten times in a row that I did this.

2278
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:26,280
You're dying first.

2279
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:27,280
I don't care if I...

2280
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:30,700
I don't care what happens.

2281
02:24:30,700 --> 02:24:31,700
Wait.

2282
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:39,020
Wait for the dog.

2283
02:24:39,020 --> 02:24:40,020
Oh no.

2284
02:24:40,020 --> 02:24:54,319
All right.

2285
02:24:54,319 --> 02:24:55,680
Don't blow this.

2286
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:58,680
Because I just have to get these two guys with the bane of my entire existence.

2287
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:02,329
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

2288
02:25:02,329 --> 02:25:17,139
How is you...

2289
02:25:17,139 --> 02:25:18,139
How is you...

2290
02:25:18,139 --> 02:25:34,290
Three guys up there.

2291
02:25:34,290 --> 02:25:38,489
Anybody going to aim down the hall and shoot me?

2292
02:25:38,489 --> 02:25:41,329
One guy here.

2293
02:25:41,329 --> 02:25:42,329
I don't think so.

2294
02:25:42,329 --> 02:25:44,959
I think I'm good to go right here.

2295
02:25:44,959 --> 02:25:45,959
Grab this gun.

2296
02:25:45,959 --> 02:25:46,959
Yep.

2297
02:25:46,959 --> 02:25:47,959
Okay.

2298
02:25:47,959 --> 02:25:51,090
Nobody alive in here, right?

2299
02:25:51,090 --> 02:25:52,090
Is this guy...

2300
02:25:52,090 --> 02:26:08,280
God damn it.

2301
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:20,290
I'm so, so depressed right now.

2302
02:26:20,290 --> 02:26:23,290
I tried so hard to look around and I just...

2303
02:26:23,290 --> 02:26:25,290
The glass is just so many...

2304
02:26:25,290 --> 02:26:28,290
There's so many avenues that I have to pay attention to.

2305
02:26:28,290 --> 02:26:30,770
Thanks, door.

2306
02:26:30,770 --> 02:26:46,860
To get rid of this guy now.

2307
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:47,860
Come on.

2308
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:48,860
Get over here.

2309
02:26:48,860 --> 02:26:51,549
How do you not see me?

2310
02:26:51,549 --> 02:26:52,790
Why?

2311
02:26:52,790 --> 02:26:53,790
Why?

2312
02:26:53,790 --> 02:27:00,430
That guy's still alive.

2313
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:02,430
He didn't come out of his room.

2314
02:27:02,430 --> 02:27:04,989
He didn't come out of his room.

2315
02:27:04,989 --> 02:27:06,989
How did you not come out of your room yet?

2316
02:27:06,989 --> 02:27:10,399
He's dead.

2317
02:27:10,399 --> 02:27:11,399
Did I kill him?

2318
02:27:11,399 --> 02:27:13,399
I don't even remember killing that guy.

2319
02:27:13,399 --> 02:27:14,399
The glass.

2320
02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:35,120
Is he dead?

2321
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:56,559
Jake.

2322
02:27:56,559 --> 02:27:57,870
I got Jake.

2323
02:27:57,870 --> 02:27:58,870
The Jake mask.

2324
02:27:58,870 --> 02:28:01,770
I got it.

2325
02:28:01,770 --> 02:28:02,770
I got it.

2326
02:28:02,770 --> 02:28:03,770
I got it.

2327
02:28:03,770 --> 02:28:04,770
Everyone, don't worry about it.

2328
02:28:04,770 --> 02:28:07,719
I got it.

2329
02:28:07,719 --> 02:28:12,159
Chapter done.

2330
02:28:12,159 --> 02:28:14,159
Is this really the same guy that died to Pinwheel?

2331
02:28:14,159 --> 02:28:16,159
He's changed so much.

2332
02:28:16,159 --> 02:28:23,399
I don't know about this grade.

2333
02:28:23,399 --> 02:28:28,299
This game is so hard and so ridiculous.

2334
02:28:28,299 --> 02:28:32,049
But I can't stop playing it.

2335
02:28:32,049 --> 02:28:33,049
It's...

2336
02:28:33,049 --> 02:28:38,620
Everything is so clean and it just feels very satisfying to play.

2337
02:28:38,620 --> 02:28:40,620
I can't really stop.

2338
02:28:40,620 --> 02:28:46,079
I don't care if I get a C-.

2339
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:48,079
Is there anything lower than a C-?

2340
02:28:48,079 --> 02:28:55,319
Or is that as low as you can go?

2341
02:28:55,319 --> 02:28:56,489
Can you get an F?

2342
02:28:56,489 --> 02:29:04,879
I got Willem and Jake the snake.

2343
02:29:04,879 --> 02:29:07,950
You can get F.

2344
02:29:07,950 --> 02:29:09,950
Okay, that's all I need to know.

2345
02:29:09,950 --> 02:29:18,909
Alright, dead again.

2346
02:29:18,909 --> 02:29:19,909
What are you looking at?

2347
02:29:19,909 --> 02:29:20,909
Hey, I recognize you.

2348
02:29:20,909 --> 02:29:24,430
You look very familiar.

2349
02:29:24,430 --> 02:29:26,430
Have we met before?

2350
02:29:26,430 --> 02:29:30,739
Alrighty.

2351
02:29:30,739 --> 02:29:43,200
I don't get a free VHS.

2352
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:44,200
Did it say something about July?

2353
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:45,200
What the fuck?

2354
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:47,200
Get out of my face, asshole.

2355
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:58,000
Who the hell is this?

2356
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Alright, this is Jim from the office.

2357
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Just want to remind you that your report is due tomorrow morning.

2358
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Have it on my desk by eight.

2359
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,629
It's the address in case you forgot.

2360
02:30:08,629 --> 02:30:11,510
Click, click, click, click, click.

2361
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:13,510
Click, click, click, click, click.

2362
02:30:13,510 --> 02:30:15,389
Okay.

2363
02:30:15,389 --> 02:30:27,680
Eleventh chapter, Dead Line.

2364
02:30:27,680 --> 02:30:28,680
Who do we got?

2365
02:30:28,680 --> 02:30:32,090
Alright.

2366
02:30:32,090 --> 02:30:35,270
Rip and steal is Willem.

2367
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:39,809
And then we have survived two bullets.

2368
02:30:39,809 --> 02:30:41,809
Killing throws.

2369
02:30:41,809 --> 02:30:42,809
Let's try it.

2370
02:30:42,809 --> 02:30:52,969
There's glass everywhere.

2371
02:30:52,969 --> 02:30:57,000
That didn't kill him in the first shot.

2372
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:03,280
Somehow you managed to live.

2373
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:05,280
And there's glass here and a guy here.

2374
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:06,280
I got to be careful.

2375
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:08,280
We're going to go grab the...

2376
02:31:08,280 --> 02:31:10,520
Killing throws.

2377
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:16,940
Holy fuck.

2378
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:17,940
Okay, I'm good.

2379
02:31:17,940 --> 02:31:29,590
Oh, best song in the whole game here.

2380
02:31:29,590 --> 02:31:45,719
Oh, I thought there was a window.

2381
02:31:45,719 --> 02:32:00,399
He's still alive.

2382
02:32:00,399 --> 02:32:06,690
Oh!

2383
02:32:06,690 --> 02:32:07,690
He got...

2384
02:32:07,690 --> 02:32:08,690
He died.

2385
02:32:08,690 --> 02:32:11,190
Oh.

2386
02:32:11,190 --> 02:32:15,629
Okay.

2387
02:32:15,629 --> 02:32:17,629
Slow-mo rewind that right now.

2388
02:32:17,629 --> 02:32:18,629
Do it right now.

2389
02:32:18,629 --> 02:32:20,629
Go back and rewind the fucking game.

2390
02:32:20,629 --> 02:32:22,629
And watch those bullets go through the guy's face.

2391
02:32:22,629 --> 02:32:23,629
What happened there?

2392
02:32:23,629 --> 02:32:33,280
I want a full rewind.

2393
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:46,229
Door.

2394
02:32:46,229 --> 02:32:47,229
Oh, fuck.

2395
02:32:47,229 --> 02:32:48,229
Okay.

2396
02:32:48,229 --> 02:32:51,129
Melee weapon.

2397
02:32:51,129 --> 02:32:52,129
Holy shit.

2398
02:32:52,129 --> 02:32:53,129
What?

2399
02:32:53,129 --> 02:33:04,610
Oh, my God.

2400
02:33:04,610 --> 02:33:05,610
I'm panicking.

2401
02:33:05,610 --> 02:33:06,610
I need a...

2402
02:33:06,610 --> 02:33:07,850
I don't know what I need.

2403
02:33:07,850 --> 02:33:14,920
Glass.

2404
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:17,559
All right.

2405
02:33:17,559 --> 02:33:22,579
Let's go.

2406
02:33:22,579 --> 02:33:23,579
Two out of two.

2407
02:33:23,579 --> 02:33:32,370
I'll take the big shotgun.

2408
02:33:32,370 --> 02:33:33,370
Why not?

2409
02:33:33,370 --> 02:33:39,920
Oh, fuck.

2410
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:40,920
He turned on me quick.

2411
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:41,920
Really?

2412
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:46,170
Fucking really.

2413
02:33:46,170 --> 02:33:47,170
Like, fucking really?

2414
02:33:47,170 --> 02:33:51,420
I'm just going to shoot you then.

2415
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:52,659
Well, no.

2416
02:33:52,659 --> 02:33:53,659
Okay.

2417
02:33:53,659 --> 02:33:54,659
I want to throw.

2418
02:33:54,659 --> 02:33:55,659
I don't want to grab anybody.

2419
02:33:55,659 --> 02:33:56,659
I didn't want to grab that guy.

2420
02:33:56,659 --> 02:34:09,420
Glass.

2421
02:34:09,420 --> 02:34:10,420
I'll shoot this guy through the glass.

2422
02:34:10,420 --> 02:34:11,600
Wait.

2423
02:34:11,600 --> 02:34:12,600
Speaking of glass.

2424
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:27,020
Oh, my God.

2425
02:34:27,020 --> 02:34:28,020
I'm so...

2426
02:34:28,020 --> 02:34:29,020
Okay.

2427
02:34:29,020 --> 02:34:33,780
He can shoot me through that glass.

2428
02:34:33,780 --> 02:34:34,780
Any more glass?

2429
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:35,780
No.

2430
02:34:35,780 --> 02:34:36,780
I just got to go through this room.

2431
02:34:36,780 --> 02:34:37,780
Get them both in one shot.

2432
02:34:37,780 --> 02:34:38,780
Ready?

2433
02:34:38,780 --> 02:34:39,780
One.

2434
02:34:39,780 --> 02:34:40,780
Two.

2435
02:34:40,780 --> 02:34:41,780
Three.

2436
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:43,209
Holy fuck.

2437
02:34:43,209 --> 02:34:44,579
No?

2438
02:34:44,579 --> 02:34:45,579
I'm okay.

2439
02:34:45,579 --> 02:34:48,799
Am I though?

2440
02:34:48,799 --> 02:34:53,450
Now I have three people in this room to deal with.

2441
02:34:53,450 --> 02:35:01,540
Hi.

2442
02:35:01,540 --> 02:35:05,979
Okay.

2443
02:35:05,979 --> 02:35:06,979
I think I can thank God it's long enough.

2444
02:35:06,979 --> 02:35:07,979
All right.

2445
02:35:07,979 --> 02:35:08,979
Two to two.

2446
02:35:08,979 --> 02:35:09,979
Where is he?

2447
02:35:09,979 --> 02:35:10,979
Right here.

2448
02:35:10,979 --> 02:35:11,979
That's the last guy in this whole place.

2449
02:35:11,979 --> 02:35:12,979
Make it easy on yourself.

2450
02:35:12,979 --> 02:35:13,979
All right.

2451
02:35:22,319 --> 02:35:26,510
Okay.

2452
02:35:26,510 --> 02:35:29,389
No masks in here, right?

2453
02:35:29,389 --> 02:35:36,770
Holy...

2454
02:35:36,770 --> 02:35:51,450
What the fuck is this?

2455
02:35:51,450 --> 02:35:53,520
I...

2456
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:55,469
Oh, no.

2457
02:35:55,469 --> 02:35:56,469
I can't go anywhere.

2458
02:35:56,469 --> 02:36:00,500
There's no bullets in this gun.

2459
02:36:00,500 --> 02:36:01,500
Fuck.

2460
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:06,639
Holy God.

2461
02:36:06,639 --> 02:36:12,850
Oh, now I'm in trouble.

2462
02:36:12,850 --> 02:36:14,850
Oh, now I'm in trouble.

2463
02:36:14,850 --> 02:36:29,879
I got to hide.

2464
02:36:29,879 --> 02:36:32,239
Who's throwing this shit?

2465
02:36:32,239 --> 02:36:33,239
Oh, my God.

2466
02:36:33,239 --> 02:36:40,729
I don't have any more bullets.

2467
02:36:40,729 --> 02:36:51,959
Holy shit, man.

2468
02:36:51,959 --> 02:36:53,959
They don't give you a second.

2469
02:36:58,010 --> 02:37:08,040
Jesus Christ.

2470
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:11,040
It's pinpoint fucking accuracy.

2471
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:16,120
I'm so dead again.

2472
02:37:16,120 --> 02:37:23,290
I need a different gun.

2473
02:37:23,290 --> 02:37:25,879
Holy shit.

2474
02:37:25,879 --> 02:37:27,879
This is insane.

2475
02:37:27,879 --> 02:37:33,190
I'm trying to pick the gun up.

2476
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:34,190
I just didn't...

2477
02:37:34,190 --> 02:37:45,600
I couldn't get it.

2478
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:47,600
Lord, this is the hardest thing I've done the whole game.

2479
02:37:47,600 --> 02:38:09,350
It's not enough to kill all of them.

2480
02:38:09,350 --> 02:38:20,100
Jesus, my Lord.

2481
02:38:20,100 --> 02:38:21,100
I give up, you win.

2482
02:38:21,100 --> 02:38:22,100
Don't even think about it.

2483
02:38:22,100 --> 02:38:24,100
I'm not going over there unless I have a gun.

2484
02:38:24,100 --> 02:38:26,430
I don't have a gun.

2485
02:38:26,430 --> 02:38:28,180
Are there any guns on the ground?

2486
02:38:28,180 --> 02:38:30,180
He's going to stand up and shoot me.

2487
02:38:30,180 --> 02:38:34,430
Okay, good.

2488
02:38:34,430 --> 02:38:37,520
All right.

2489
02:38:37,520 --> 02:38:38,520
Get to the car.

2490
02:38:38,520 --> 02:38:52,440
Let's go.

2491
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:59,879
Oh, hey.

2492
02:38:59,879 --> 02:39:00,879
C minus.

2493
02:39:00,879 --> 02:39:03,889
No, I'll probably get like a B.

2494
02:39:03,889 --> 02:39:04,889
Give me a B.

2495
02:39:04,889 --> 02:39:05,889
C plus.

2496
02:39:05,889 --> 02:39:11,420
I'm all right with that.

2497
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:12,420
Oh, I got a...

2498
02:39:12,420 --> 02:39:25,370
He's dead.

2499
02:39:25,370 --> 02:39:29,040
Hey, you.

2500
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:30,040
VIP's only tonight.

2501
02:39:30,040 --> 02:39:31,040
I think you better leave.

2502
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:39,680
Why is it VIP's only?

2503
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:40,860
I am...

2504
02:39:40,860 --> 02:39:45,790
What the fuck are you looking at?

2505
02:39:45,790 --> 02:39:46,790
Oh, it's that guy.

2506
02:39:46,790 --> 02:39:48,030
Okay.

2507
02:39:48,030 --> 02:39:49,030
Interesting.

2508
02:39:49,030 --> 02:39:56,219
Get out of the way.

2509
02:39:56,219 --> 02:39:58,219
Part four.

2510
02:39:58,219 --> 02:39:59,649
Connections.

2511
02:39:59,649 --> 02:40:12,879
That's a new mask.

2512
02:40:12,879 --> 02:40:14,760
Hey.

2513
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:18,200
Oh, why the...

2514
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:20,200
Why does clicking skip?

2515
02:40:20,200 --> 02:40:26,520
I like went to go click on her and it skipped it instantly.

2516
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:29,079
What did it say?

2517
02:40:29,079 --> 02:40:39,360
I tried, I like didn't know that...

2518
02:40:39,360 --> 02:40:42,360
Literally clicking the button one time skips the whole cut scene.

2519
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:49,850
I can't restart this.

2520
02:40:49,850 --> 02:41:02,870
What the fuck is going...

2521
02:41:02,870 --> 02:41:03,870
What did I just do?

2522
02:41:03,870 --> 02:41:04,870
What happened?

2523
02:41:04,870 --> 02:41:19,930
What?

2524
02:41:19,930 --> 02:41:20,930
What's going on?

2525
02:41:20,930 --> 02:41:32,860
Why do I watch the...

2526
02:41:32,860 --> 02:41:36,440
Play level 11 again.

2527
02:41:36,440 --> 02:41:37,440
What?

2528
02:41:37,440 --> 02:41:38,440
Why?

2529
02:41:38,440 --> 02:41:39,440
You told me to go back?

2530
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:42,319
I have to play the last level over again.

2531
02:41:42,319 --> 02:41:47,020
All right.

2532
02:41:47,020 --> 02:41:48,709
Give me a TLDR.

2533
02:41:48,709 --> 02:41:49,709
What did the girl say?

2534
02:41:49,709 --> 02:41:50,709
And what happens when you talk to the rat?

2535
02:41:50,709 --> 02:41:52,709
I don't want to play that last level again.

2536
02:41:52,709 --> 02:42:00,389
You watch it on YouTube.

2537
02:42:00,389 --> 02:42:07,000
It's a one minute cut scene.

2538
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:08,000
All right.

2539
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,139
Hold on.

2540
02:42:10,139 --> 02:42:11,139
What should I search for?

2541
02:42:11,139 --> 02:42:13,760
Like rat on couch Miami?

2542
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:18,389
No, there's going to be a shit load of articles about like a rat problem in Florida.

2543
02:42:18,389 --> 02:42:38,139
There's no way to...

2544
02:42:38,139 --> 02:42:39,139
Chapter 12.

2545
02:42:39,139 --> 02:42:41,139
Chapter 12 intro scene.

2546
02:42:41,139 --> 02:42:43,139
Hotline Miami.

2547
02:42:43,139 --> 02:42:52,549
This is not very...

2548
02:42:52,549 --> 02:42:55,549
I don't think I can find a decent video here.

2549
02:42:55,549 --> 02:42:57,549
And these are all like Let's Plays.

2550
02:42:57,549 --> 02:43:07,059
There's somebody to be talking.

2551
02:43:07,059 --> 02:43:08,059
All right.

2552
02:43:08,059 --> 02:43:09,299
Hold on.

2553
02:43:09,299 --> 02:43:12,299
I just saw it.

2554
02:43:12,299 --> 02:43:14,309
Okay.

2555
02:43:14,309 --> 02:43:17,700
You get shot and then...

2556
02:43:17,700 --> 02:43:20,000
Looks like it's only you and me left.

2557
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:24,000
I'm sure you know by now that this won't end well.

2558
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Soon you'll be all alone, but that's okay.

2559
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Before we say goodbye, I'll let you in on a little secret.

2560
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:33,590
What you do from here on won't serve any purpose.

2561
02:43:33,590 --> 02:43:35,590
You will never see the whole picture.

2562
02:43:35,590 --> 02:43:38,590
Here's the chicken saying this, and it's all your own fault.

2563
02:43:38,590 --> 02:43:40,590
Now it's time for you to leave.

2564
02:43:40,590 --> 02:43:44,590
There's a warm bed across the hall from here and you look like you could use some rest.

2565
02:43:44,590 --> 02:43:48,590
Then he goes over and he turns into like another character.

2566
02:43:48,590 --> 02:43:49,590
He turns into...

2567
02:43:49,590 --> 02:43:51,590
Now he's in like a hospital.

2568
02:43:51,590 --> 02:43:55,590
And his head explodes and then he lies down.

2569
02:43:55,590 --> 02:43:58,110
All right.

2570
02:43:58,110 --> 02:43:59,110
I got it.

2571
02:43:59,110 --> 02:44:00,110
I figured out.

2572
02:44:00,110 --> 02:44:05,319
I understand.

2573
02:44:05,319 --> 02:44:13,969
I don't know if he's been in a coma for weeks now, but he's going to wake up, right?

2574
02:44:13,969 --> 02:44:15,969
Chat didn't see it.

2575
02:44:15,969 --> 02:44:20,430
Why did you tell me to restart?

2576
02:44:20,430 --> 02:44:22,430
I gotta stop listening.

2577
02:44:22,430 --> 02:44:26,180
I gotta stop listening to chat every time.

2578
02:44:26,180 --> 02:44:33,239
Show it.

2579
02:44:33,239 --> 02:44:34,239
What?

2580
02:44:34,239 --> 02:44:36,319
What?

2581
02:44:36,319 --> 02:44:37,319
It was one guy?

2582
02:44:37,319 --> 02:44:39,319
No, it was like 400 guys.

2583
02:44:39,319 --> 02:44:42,489
It was like three to four hundred guys.

2584
02:44:42,489 --> 02:44:45,590
He's going to wake up.

2585
02:44:45,590 --> 02:44:46,590
All right.

2586
02:44:46,590 --> 02:44:47,590
Listen, I'll give you the TLDR.

2587
02:44:47,590 --> 02:44:49,719
You walk in.

2588
02:44:49,719 --> 02:44:50,719
Guy on the couch shoots you.

2589
02:44:50,719 --> 02:44:51,719
You fall down.

2590
02:44:51,719 --> 02:44:52,719
You get back up.

2591
02:44:52,719 --> 02:44:55,719
He says, hey, this is fucking all this fucked up, ain't it buddy?

2592
02:44:55,719 --> 02:44:56,719
And you're like, yeah.

2593
02:44:56,719 --> 02:44:58,719
And then you walk out and your head explodes.

2594
02:44:58,719 --> 02:45:03,549
There you go.

2595
02:45:03,549 --> 02:45:06,549
This guy is a prime suspect in a major case.

2596
02:45:06,549 --> 02:45:11,030
Look, my guess is as good as yours.

2597
02:45:11,030 --> 02:45:13,030
Though I can say that it might be a while.

2598
02:45:13,030 --> 02:45:16,030
He's still not even fully healed from the surgery.

2599
02:45:16,030 --> 02:45:17,030
Is there nothing you can do?

2600
02:45:17,030 --> 02:45:56,110
We need this guy.

2601
02:45:56,110 --> 02:45:57,110
Here.

2602
02:45:57,110 --> 02:45:58,110
Look.

2603
02:45:58,110 --> 02:45:59,110
See?

2604
02:45:59,110 --> 02:46:01,920
Just pretend I'm playing this.

2605
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:05,600
Holiday sale.

2606
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:12,030
Hey, make sure you check out Fry's Electronics.

2607
02:46:12,030 --> 02:46:15,739
God damn.

2608
02:46:15,739 --> 02:46:16,739
All right.

2609
02:46:16,739 --> 02:46:17,739
Fuck it.

2610
02:46:17,739 --> 02:46:18,739
Who cares?

2611
02:46:18,739 --> 02:46:22,729
Wait, wait, wait.

2612
02:46:22,729 --> 02:46:23,729
Get.

2613
02:46:23,729 --> 02:46:24,729
Here.

2614
02:46:24,729 --> 02:46:25,729
Watch.

2615
02:46:25,729 --> 02:46:28,829
Ready?

2616
02:46:28,829 --> 02:46:31,670
See?

2617
02:46:31,670 --> 02:46:32,670
There you go.

2618
02:46:32,670 --> 02:46:39,799
So I'm in a coma.

2619
02:46:39,799 --> 02:46:40,799
See?

2620
02:46:40,799 --> 02:46:44,340
There you go.

2621
02:46:44,340 --> 02:46:46,520
But that asshole ain't saying shit.

2622
02:46:46,520 --> 02:46:49,649
And what makes you think this guy will?

2623
02:46:49,649 --> 02:46:50,649
July 21st.

2624
02:46:50,649 --> 02:46:52,649
Wait, I'm in the hospital.

2625
02:46:52,649 --> 02:46:57,899
Hey, where do you think you're going, prick?

2626
02:46:57,899 --> 02:47:01,329
I guess we better put restraints on you.

2627
02:47:01,329 --> 02:47:02,329
July 21st.

2628
02:47:02,329 --> 02:47:05,170
Oh.

2629
02:47:05,170 --> 02:47:06,170
I thought every day was counting.

2630
02:47:06,170 --> 02:47:07,170
All right.

2631
02:47:07,170 --> 02:47:10,840
Well, I gotta sneak out.

2632
02:47:10,840 --> 02:47:12,840
You get a bigger house on the 21st.

2633
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:29,079
The world is just spinning around now.

2634
02:47:29,079 --> 02:47:32,809
Okay.

2635
02:47:32,809 --> 02:47:34,809
This is hard to control.

2636
02:47:34,809 --> 02:47:36,049
I don't like this.

2637
02:47:36,049 --> 02:47:37,049
I hate this.

2638
02:47:37,049 --> 02:47:38,049
Oh no.

2639
02:47:38,049 --> 02:47:39,049
Don't.

2640
02:47:39,049 --> 02:47:40,049
I don't want to do this.

2641
02:47:40,049 --> 02:47:41,049
No.

2642
02:47:41,049 --> 02:47:45,040
How do I get out of here?

2643
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:46,040
Just can I go back outside?

2644
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:49,139
Oh, like, cause I turned the...

2645
02:47:49,139 --> 02:47:52,430
Here.

2646
02:47:52,430 --> 02:47:54,819
Hold on.

2647
02:47:54,819 --> 02:47:55,819
There you go.

2648
02:47:55,819 --> 02:48:01,350
Am I missing something here?

2649
02:48:01,350 --> 02:48:02,350
The other way?

2650
02:48:02,350 --> 02:48:09,409
I can't go back outside.

2651
02:48:09,409 --> 02:48:18,909
I can't open this window.

2652
02:48:18,909 --> 02:48:19,909
Okay.

2653
02:48:19,909 --> 02:48:23,389
He's distracted.

2654
02:48:23,389 --> 02:48:24,389
All right.

2655
02:48:24,389 --> 02:48:25,389
So I can go up there.

2656
02:48:25,389 --> 02:48:27,389
And is there any patrol over here?

2657
02:48:27,389 --> 02:48:28,389
Is this guy right here?

2658
02:48:28,389 --> 02:48:32,930
You can see through the window, right?

2659
02:48:32,930 --> 02:48:33,930
Oh fuck.

2660
02:48:33,930 --> 02:48:34,930
I gotta move now.

2661
02:48:34,930 --> 02:48:35,930
Can you see me through the window?

2662
02:48:35,930 --> 02:48:36,930
I have no idea.

2663
02:48:36,930 --> 02:48:39,639
I gotta go that way.

2664
02:48:39,639 --> 02:48:40,639
Okay.

2665
02:48:40,639 --> 02:48:42,270
Let's go forward now.

2666
02:48:42,270 --> 02:48:43,270
Okay.

2667
02:48:43,270 --> 02:48:49,309
Through that door.

2668
02:48:49,309 --> 02:48:52,530
Watch out for that guy reading.

2669
02:48:52,530 --> 02:48:53,530
I'm gonna go on the next attempt.

2670
02:48:53,530 --> 02:48:55,219
Wait.

2671
02:48:55,219 --> 02:48:57,420
Watch out for the doctor.

2672
02:48:57,420 --> 02:48:58,420
Is he gonna come down here now?

2673
02:48:58,420 --> 02:48:59,420
What?

2674
02:48:59,420 --> 02:49:00,420
What's going on?

2675
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:01,420
Holy fuck.

2676
02:49:01,420 --> 02:49:04,639
Oh.

2677
02:49:04,639 --> 02:49:05,639
Come on, man.

2678
02:49:05,639 --> 02:49:06,639
Is there anything in here I need to get?

2679
02:49:06,639 --> 02:49:07,639
I think so.

2680
02:49:07,639 --> 02:49:20,399
I'm assuming I just have to go over here.

2681
02:49:20,399 --> 02:49:21,399
Oh my god.

2682
02:49:21,399 --> 02:49:25,270
Give me a break.

2683
02:49:25,270 --> 02:49:26,270
Really?

2684
02:49:26,270 --> 02:49:29,680
What?

2685
02:49:29,680 --> 02:49:38,989
The fucking window.

2686
02:49:38,989 --> 02:49:39,989
Fuck you.

2687
02:49:39,989 --> 02:49:40,989
No.

2688
02:49:40,989 --> 02:49:55,090
Okay.

2689
02:49:55,090 --> 02:49:56,090
More escape mission.

2690
02:49:56,090 --> 02:49:57,090
Is there anywhere that I have to go in particular?

2691
02:49:57,090 --> 02:49:58,090
I'm just gonna go slow room to room.

2692
02:49:58,090 --> 02:49:59,090
Oh, that's not gonna happen.

2693
02:49:59,090 --> 02:50:22,799
Go back in.

2694
02:50:22,799 --> 02:50:27,809
I'm down.

2695
02:50:27,809 --> 02:50:28,809
Hey, hold it right there.

2696
02:50:28,809 --> 02:50:29,809
You're not allowed out of here.

2697
02:50:29,809 --> 02:50:30,809
Get back to your room now.

2698
02:50:30,809 --> 02:50:31,809
Fucking idiot.

2699
02:50:31,809 --> 02:50:34,969
This is not fun on hardcore.

2700
02:50:34,969 --> 02:50:38,530
I can't imagine most of this game would be very fun on hardcore.

2701
02:50:38,530 --> 02:50:39,530
Jesus.

2702
02:50:39,530 --> 02:50:40,840
I have to make it over there.

2703
02:50:40,840 --> 02:50:43,680
Okay.

2704
02:50:43,680 --> 02:50:44,680
Okay.

2705
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:45,680
Okay.

2706
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:52,040
Okay.

2707
02:50:52,139 --> 02:50:58,129
I'm gonna go in when he passes.

2708
02:50:58,129 --> 02:51:00,040
I'm going to go into this room here.

2709
02:51:00,040 --> 02:51:02,860
And never mind, there's another guy there.

2710
02:51:02,860 --> 02:51:08,379
I actually can probably make it there in one go.

2711
02:51:08,379 --> 02:51:24,209
Into this room here.

2712
02:51:24,209 --> 02:51:30,139
Watch out for the window, nobody can see me.

2713
02:51:30,139 --> 02:51:40,799
All right from here it looks like.

2714
02:51:40,799 --> 02:51:41,799
Can I?

2715
02:51:41,799 --> 02:52:01,100
I'm gonna go through this side and I could hear the sound of the game.

2716
02:52:01,100 --> 02:52:04,170
There must be a door over here or something.

2717
02:52:04,170 --> 02:52:05,170
Isn't it?

2718
02:52:05,170 --> 02:52:06,170
Oh.

2719
02:52:06,170 --> 02:52:08,760
Oh my god.

2720
02:52:08,760 --> 02:52:10,760
Can I? I can't punch anybody, can I?

2721
02:52:10,760 --> 02:52:15,940
I mean, there's a spot.

2722
02:52:15,940 --> 02:52:17,940
Is it one second here?

2723
02:52:17,940 --> 02:52:20,180
Like if I go right

2724
02:52:20,180 --> 02:52:22,180
now

2725
02:52:22,180 --> 02:52:24,180
I might be able to make it all the way over here.

2726
02:52:24,180 --> 02:52:30,239
Okay. Next run through.

2727
02:52:30,239 --> 02:52:32,239
There's another guy coming. One.

2728
02:52:32,239 --> 02:52:34,239
There comes two. Alright, now when he's gone

2729
02:52:34,239 --> 02:52:36,239
this guy comes around. Time to go.

2730
02:52:36,239 --> 02:52:42,450
One, two, three, go.

2731
02:52:42,450 --> 02:52:45,329
What the fuck?

2732
02:52:45,329 --> 02:52:47,329
It drunkenly walked me into the other

2733
02:52:47,329 --> 02:52:49,760
way. Fuck.

2734
02:52:49,760 --> 02:53:12,469
What's this door for here?

2735
02:53:12,469 --> 02:53:30,639
What? What the fuck is going on?

2736
02:53:30,639 --> 02:53:38,200
Watch out for the windows.

2737
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:46,000
You can just skip

2738
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:51,760
that whole sequence.

2739
02:53:51,760 --> 02:53:54,450
Okay. Why put all that

2740
02:53:54,450 --> 02:53:56,450
nonsense down there where

2741
02:53:56,450 --> 02:53:58,450
you could just walk out and leave?

2742
02:53:58,450 --> 02:54:07,010
I guess so.

2743
02:54:07,010 --> 02:54:19,110
Somebody's fucking up my car.

2744
02:54:19,110 --> 02:54:23,649
Caution tape. Dead body.

2745
02:54:23,649 --> 02:54:25,649
Looks like this is a crime scene.

2746
02:54:25,649 --> 02:54:32,180
What was in? Like a clothes?

2747
02:54:32,180 --> 02:54:36,850
These are my clothes.

2748
02:54:36,850 --> 02:54:55,090
The car still works?

2749
02:54:55,090 --> 02:54:57,649
Assault.

2750
02:54:57,649 --> 02:54:59,649
The 13th chapter.

2751
02:55:01,649 --> 02:55:03,649
Richard.

2752
02:55:03,649 --> 02:55:05,649
Let's see. How about

2753
02:55:05,649 --> 02:55:11,090
rip and

2754
02:55:11,090 --> 02:55:13,090
steal. Quiet gunshots.

2755
02:55:13,090 --> 02:55:17,190
Okay.

2756
02:55:17,190 --> 02:55:19,190
I don't know what I'm doing here.

2757
02:55:19,190 --> 02:55:26,040
Is this like a...

2758
02:55:26,040 --> 02:55:28,280
Well, okay.

2759
02:55:28,280 --> 02:55:30,280
We got one, two. I could probably go

2760
02:55:30,280 --> 02:55:32,280
like this.

2761
02:55:32,280 --> 02:55:34,280
Wait for him to come around.

2762
02:55:34,280 --> 02:55:36,280
Knock you out. Watch out.

2763
02:55:36,280 --> 02:55:38,709
Oh, I thought I hit a gun.

2764
02:55:38,709 --> 02:55:40,709
That looks like a gun

2765
02:55:40,709 --> 02:55:56,389
in his hands.

2766
02:55:56,389 --> 02:55:58,389
I'm so confused right now.

2767
02:55:58,389 --> 02:56:00,389
What the fuck am I holding? Is it a baton?

2768
02:56:00,389 --> 02:56:06,530
So these guys don't have...

2769
02:56:06,530 --> 02:56:08,530
Who has the gun then?

2770
02:56:08,530 --> 02:56:11,409
They don't have guns.

2771
02:56:11,409 --> 02:56:20,049
I'm so worried about being shot. I thought

2772
02:56:20,049 --> 02:56:25,299
didn't I get shot at first?

2773
02:56:25,299 --> 02:56:27,299
I could have sworn that somebody shot me here.

2774
02:56:27,299 --> 02:56:35,559
Well, now they did.

2775
02:56:35,559 --> 02:56:41,879
I didn't get it. Damn.

2776
02:56:41,879 --> 02:56:46,799
No, I wanted to hold on to that.

2777
02:56:46,799 --> 02:56:48,799
I don't like this weapon.

2778
02:56:48,799 --> 02:56:50,799
The weapon is like awkward for me. I don't know why.

2779
02:56:50,799 --> 02:57:02,959
Where did you get the machine gun?

2780
02:57:02,959 --> 02:57:04,959
Alright, hold on a second here.

2781
02:57:04,959 --> 02:57:08,610
It's the same as the other weapons.

2782
02:57:08,610 --> 02:57:10,610
You know what it is? Is it the fact that

2783
02:57:10,610 --> 02:57:12,610
he's switching hands?

2784
02:57:12,610 --> 02:57:14,610
Does that happen with the other weapons too? Is that something I've never noticed?

2785
02:57:14,610 --> 02:57:27,030
Let's try going in here.

2786
02:57:27,030 --> 02:57:33,479
Okay.

2787
02:57:33,479 --> 02:57:36,159
I got a gun now. Watch out for the window.

2788
02:57:36,159 --> 02:57:43,719
Okay, guy in there.

2789
02:57:43,719 --> 02:57:45,719
What?

2790
02:57:45,719 --> 02:57:51,219
What?

2791
02:57:51,219 --> 02:58:03,250
I was across the whole game.

2792
02:58:03,250 --> 02:58:12,079
Oh my fucking god.

2793
02:58:12,079 --> 02:58:27,059
Oh my fucking god.

2794
02:58:27,059 --> 02:58:38,450
Pull me back in here.

2795
02:58:38,450 --> 02:58:48,370
Here comes the guy with the gun.

2796
02:58:48,370 --> 02:58:50,870
Speaking of guns, please give this one to me.

2797
02:58:50,870 --> 02:58:58,290
I'm not going this way

2798
02:58:58,290 --> 02:59:00,290
again.

2799
02:59:00,290 --> 02:59:04,260
Although I might have to do this.

2800
02:59:04,260 --> 02:59:07,139
Okay, got him.

2801
02:59:07,139 --> 02:59:09,139
I think there's somebody behind him.

2802
02:59:09,139 --> 02:59:15,600
Alright. I gotta do this a little slower.

2803
02:59:15,600 --> 02:59:21,750
Um.

2804
02:59:21,750 --> 02:59:23,750
I can tell there's a guy right here.

2805
02:59:23,750 --> 02:59:25,750
Oh fuck. It's silent. It's okay.

2806
02:59:25,750 --> 02:59:27,750
Alright, up here. No. God. I don't know.

2807
02:59:27,750 --> 02:59:33,510
I just don't know if there's a guy right down there.

2808
02:59:33,510 --> 02:59:44,520
Let's exterior that.

2809
02:59:44,520 --> 02:59:56,100
Let me get the window here.

2810
02:59:56,100 --> 03:00:02,049
Right there. That guy would have killed me.

2811
03:00:02,049 --> 03:00:04,049
Thank goodness. Okay. Be careful.

2812
03:00:04,049 --> 03:00:06,479
Is there another guy down here?

2813
03:00:06,479 --> 03:00:08,479
Oh, there's another window.

2814
03:00:08,479 --> 03:00:11,110
Oh yeah.

2815
03:00:11,110 --> 03:00:13,600
What about down here?

2816
03:00:13,600 --> 03:00:15,600
Okay, only guy.

2817
03:00:15,600 --> 03:00:17,840
Watch it. He's going to be at the window in a second.

2818
03:00:17,840 --> 03:00:19,840
Watch it!

2819
03:00:19,840 --> 03:00:21,840
What? That's not a window.

2820
03:00:21,840 --> 03:00:23,840
How did he shoot through that? That's not a wall?

2821
03:00:23,840 --> 03:00:26,020
How did he shoot through the fucking

2822
03:00:26,020 --> 03:00:29,479
black thing?

2823
03:00:29,479 --> 03:00:37,090
Wait, is that not a wall?

2824
03:00:37,090 --> 03:00:39,090
That's a metal detector. Oh come on.

2825
03:00:39,090 --> 03:00:42,229
Oh my lord.

2826
03:00:42,229 --> 03:00:44,229
What the hell?

2827
03:00:44,229 --> 03:00:46,229
I was so caught. That's the first time

2828
03:00:46,229 --> 03:00:48,229
ever. You see it.

2829
03:00:48,229 --> 03:00:50,229
That's just a doorway.

2830
03:00:50,229 --> 03:00:52,229
That's the only doorway that's not brown.

2831
03:00:52,229 --> 03:01:01,510
I'm so, so unhappy.

2832
03:01:01,510 --> 03:01:15,700
In here.

2833
03:01:15,700 --> 03:01:29,969
He's going to get up.

2834
03:01:44,129 --> 03:01:50,659
Stupid metal detector.

2835
03:01:50,659 --> 03:01:52,659
I'm actually more comfortable.

2836
03:01:52,659 --> 03:01:54,659
Just running in there and fucking hitting him with a baton I think.

2837
03:01:54,659 --> 03:02:05,280
Where's the other guy?

2838
03:02:05,280 --> 03:02:11,670
He's right down here.

2839
03:02:11,670 --> 03:02:13,670
I think I want to get the giraffe with us.

2840
03:02:13,670 --> 03:02:18,209
Not being able to see down here really sucks.

2841
03:02:18,209 --> 03:02:20,209
I got him. Okay.

2842
03:02:20,209 --> 03:02:22,209
Wait, wait. Watch out for the fucking windows over here.

2843
03:02:22,209 --> 03:02:33,479
How did you? What the fuck?

2844
03:02:33,479 --> 03:02:41,989
Holy shit!

2845
03:02:41,989 --> 03:02:48,879
Oh my. I did it.

2846
03:02:48,879 --> 03:02:50,879
Oh my goodness.

2847
03:02:50,879 --> 03:03:00,549
Okay. Oh right. The metal detector.

2848
03:03:00,549 --> 03:03:04,899
Jerma sounds so scared

2849
03:03:04,899 --> 03:03:06,899
of this dream. I am.

2850
03:03:06,899 --> 03:03:08,899
This is hard, man.

2851
03:03:08,899 --> 03:03:10,899
This is like one thousand

2852
03:03:10,899 --> 03:03:35,280
percent focus.

2853
03:03:35,280 --> 03:03:37,280
Window guy. Can that guy shoot?

2854
03:03:37,280 --> 03:03:45,860
I don't think he can.

2855
03:03:45,860 --> 03:03:47,860
Alright. I'm going back down this way.

2856
03:03:47,860 --> 03:03:52,450
No, I don't want that. Give me this back.

2857
03:03:52,450 --> 03:03:56,799
Okay. Take it easy.

2858
03:03:56,799 --> 03:03:59,809
That's it for that.

2859
03:03:59,809 --> 03:04:05,059
That guy. No windows, right?

2860
03:04:05,059 --> 03:04:07,059
He can't shoot through. He can't shoot me through here.

2861
03:04:07,059 --> 03:04:15,250
I'm safe. I almost died right there.

2862
03:04:15,250 --> 03:04:17,250
Garret. That was a one hundred percent

2863
03:04:17,250 --> 03:04:19,250
almost died.

2864
03:04:19,250 --> 03:04:21,430
Okay. One guy left right here.

2865
03:04:21,430 --> 03:04:24,690
Holy fuck.

2866
03:04:24,690 --> 03:04:29,559
He turned on me so hard.

2867
03:04:29,559 --> 03:04:45,600
Got it. Keep going.

2868
03:04:45,600 --> 03:04:47,600
Okay, boys. The bastard will be here any second now.

2869
03:04:47,600 --> 03:04:49,600
It's time for us to show him what we're made of.

2870
03:04:49,600 --> 03:04:51,600
Remember your training and play it safe.

2871
03:04:51,600 --> 03:04:53,600
Follow protocol and we'll all make it out alive.

2872
03:04:53,600 --> 03:04:57,639
Okay.

2873
03:04:57,639 --> 03:05:01,540
Whatever you say.

2874
03:05:01,540 --> 03:05:03,540
You did it. You won. You got the bad guy.

2875
03:05:03,540 --> 03:05:12,049
And what did I die by again?

2876
03:05:12,049 --> 03:05:14,049
I'm not entirely sure.

2877
03:05:14,049 --> 03:05:23,440
He's alive.

2878
03:05:23,440 --> 03:05:35,649
Window. Out of bullets though.

2879
03:05:35,649 --> 03:05:41,350
There's another guy in there.

2880
03:05:41,350 --> 03:05:43,350
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

2881
03:05:43,350 --> 03:05:54,719
I missed.

2882
03:05:54,719 --> 03:05:59,010
Did I death out of myself?

2883
03:05:59,010 --> 03:06:01,010
Yeah, I did. I can't even tell anymore.

2884
03:06:01,010 --> 03:06:03,010
I'm going to rip these fucking buttons off with pliers.

2885
03:06:03,010 --> 03:06:22,149
I don't know if this doesn't feel right.

2886
03:06:22,149 --> 03:06:35,459
Watch the fucking idiot that comes through here.

2887
03:06:35,459 --> 03:06:49,350
Why is he using the

2888
03:06:49,350 --> 03:06:52,870
motion controls?

2889
03:06:52,870 --> 03:06:54,870
All right. All of them are dead up there.

2890
03:06:54,870 --> 03:06:56,870
I just have to worry about the guys in this room.

2891
03:06:56,870 --> 03:07:03,719
That's correct. Who's left?

2892
03:07:03,719 --> 03:07:05,719
Guy up there. Easy.

2893
03:07:05,719 --> 03:07:07,719
No walls. No windows to deal with.

2894
03:07:07,719 --> 03:07:10,600
And then here comes his buddy.

2895
03:07:10,600 --> 03:07:12,600
And then here comes his other buddy.

2896
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:14,600
Oh no. Don't go out there. Don't go out there.

2897
03:07:14,600 --> 03:07:21,000
That leaves us with the guy

2898
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
in the top room and the right side.

2899
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:34,120
Right side.

2900
03:07:34,120 --> 03:07:36,120
I don't know what I want to do.

2901
03:07:36,120 --> 03:07:46,549
I think I want to be careful.

2902
03:07:46,549 --> 03:07:54,040
How do I get in here?

2903
03:07:54,040 --> 03:08:08,180
Like open the cell or something?

2904
03:08:08,180 --> 03:08:10,180
Oh shit! I got wrecked here.

2905
03:08:10,180 --> 03:08:16,639
Is there a way to like...

2906
03:08:16,639 --> 03:08:24,840
Do I need to do anything else?

2907
03:08:24,840 --> 03:08:26,840
I was kind of blending in with the blood.

2908
03:08:26,840 --> 03:08:41,040
I thought it was blood on my peripheral.

2909
03:08:41,040 --> 03:08:43,040
Do I have to shoot this guy?

2910
03:08:43,040 --> 03:08:45,040
No. You got to be shitting me.

2911
03:08:45,040 --> 03:08:47,040
Why are you... Look man.

2912
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:49,040
Girl, it wasn't anything personal.

2913
03:08:49,040 --> 03:08:51,040
I know you made it all the way here,

2914
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:53,040
but I think you're in for a disappointment.

2915
03:08:53,040 --> 03:08:55,040
I don't really have any answers for you.

2916
03:08:55,040 --> 03:09:07,329
Damn, that hurt.

2917
03:09:07,329 --> 03:09:09,329
You know, I think we might not be that different, you and I.

2918
03:09:09,329 --> 03:09:13,329
Have you also been getting those weird phone calls?

2919
03:09:13,329 --> 03:09:19,200
Kogka.

2920
03:09:19,200 --> 03:09:21,200
I wish I had something to tell you, but I don't.

2921
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:23,200
The police seem to know more about this mess than I do.

2922
03:09:23,200 --> 03:09:25,200
They probably have a fire on the case.

2923
03:09:25,200 --> 03:09:27,200
A file on the case around here somewhere.

2924
03:09:27,200 --> 03:09:29,200
I'd ask you to spare my life, but...

2925
03:09:29,200 --> 03:09:31,569
Cough.

2926
03:09:31,569 --> 03:09:33,569
You look like you've made up your mind.

2927
03:09:33,569 --> 03:09:41,430
Spare or kill?

2928
03:09:41,430 --> 03:09:43,799
What should I do?

2929
03:09:43,799 --> 03:09:48,469
Oh, I'm already killing him.

2930
03:09:48,469 --> 03:09:56,770
I killed him. He's dead.

2931
03:09:56,770 --> 03:09:58,770
Well, see you later.

2932
03:09:58,770 --> 03:10:00,770
Alright, we're looking for that.

2933
03:10:00,770 --> 03:10:03,139
The filing cabinet with the file.

2934
03:10:03,139 --> 03:10:07,559
Chapter done. Go to the car.

2935
03:10:07,559 --> 03:10:10,690
Am I going to get run over by another one?

2936
03:10:10,690 --> 03:10:14,530
I got the mask.

2937
03:10:14,530 --> 03:10:27,649
Wait for the car to explode through here.

2938
03:10:27,649 --> 03:10:29,649
No worries, boys. It's not canon.

2939
03:10:29,649 --> 03:10:32,340
Did you just spoil me on the whole game?

2940
03:10:32,340 --> 03:10:34,579
Did you just spoil everything for me?

2941
03:10:34,579 --> 03:10:48,530
What?

2942
03:10:48,530 --> 03:10:56,280
See.

2943
03:10:56,280 --> 03:10:58,280
Zack the Frog, I don't care what this does.

2944
03:10:58,280 --> 03:11:05,639
I will never take this off.

2945
03:11:05,639 --> 03:11:10,690
Uzi Machine Gun.

2946
03:11:10,690 --> 03:11:12,930
July 23rd.

2947
03:11:12,930 --> 03:11:18,309
More weird shit in my house.

2948
03:11:18,309 --> 03:11:21,639
Spreading out all the files.

2949
03:11:21,639 --> 03:11:23,639
Suspects claim to have been threatened into

2950
03:11:23,639 --> 03:11:25,639
instructed to kill by messages on

2951
03:11:25,639 --> 03:11:27,639
their phone calls

2952
03:11:27,639 --> 03:11:29,639
traced to a club on South 86th

2953
03:11:29,639 --> 03:11:31,639
Street. Ties to underground Russian

2954
03:11:31,639 --> 03:11:33,639
mafia network. Multiple accounts

2955
03:11:33,639 --> 03:11:35,639
of illegal activity reported.

2956
03:11:35,639 --> 03:11:37,639
Insufficient evidence for a warrant.

2957
03:11:37,639 --> 03:11:46,260
Okie dokie.

2958
03:11:46,260 --> 03:11:56,239
Looks like that's where we're going.

2959
03:11:56,239 --> 03:11:58,239
This one's called Vengeance.

2960
03:11:58,239 --> 03:12:01,510
Uh, we're not going to do Peter.

2961
03:12:01,510 --> 03:12:03,510
Longer combo window.

2962
03:12:05,510 --> 03:12:07,510
Just want to see what the other one does.

2963
03:12:07,510 --> 03:12:09,510
Killing froze. Start with a

2964
03:12:09,510 --> 03:12:11,510
silenced Uzi. That's pretty great.

2965
03:12:11,510 --> 03:12:14,639
But, I need to put

2966
03:12:14,639 --> 03:12:16,950
the Frog Mask on.

2967
03:12:16,950 --> 03:12:25,520
Longer combo window. That's it.

2968
03:12:25,520 --> 03:12:38,690
I did it. I beat the level. Whoa.

2969
03:12:38,690 --> 03:12:42,659
Damn it. Damn it.

2970
03:12:42,659 --> 03:12:51,940
Want the gun? I want the gun!

2971
03:12:51,940 --> 03:12:59,040
I want the gun!

2972
03:12:59,040 --> 03:13:08,770
Hey, actually a good thing.

2973
03:13:08,770 --> 03:13:14,069
Turned out to be a good thing.

2974
03:13:14,069 --> 03:13:16,069
Alright, what do we got? Hey, hey, easy.

2975
03:13:16,069 --> 03:13:22,399
Oh, fuck.

2976
03:13:22,399 --> 03:13:35,440
Come on, man.

2977
03:13:35,440 --> 03:13:37,440
How does one attempt to reliably do

2978
03:13:37,440 --> 03:13:39,440
something like this over and over again?

2979
03:13:39,440 --> 03:13:49,219
That didn't connect.

2980
03:13:49,219 --> 03:13:53,440
This could be a bad mask for this.

2981
03:13:53,440 --> 03:14:04,069
I'm starting to realize this right now.

2982
03:14:04,069 --> 03:14:06,069
Start with a silenced Uzi. That makes this room

2983
03:14:06,069 --> 03:14:08,069
a thousand times easier.

2984
03:14:08,069 --> 03:14:16,389
Only one shot left and it's for the dog.

2985
03:14:16,389 --> 03:14:18,389
And I didn't even get the dog because I missed.

2986
03:14:18,389 --> 03:14:21,010
I need this now. I'm dead.

2987
03:14:21,010 --> 03:14:34,370
I can't kill this guy.

2988
03:14:34,370 --> 03:14:36,370
Yeah, I have to put another mask on.

2989
03:14:36,370 --> 03:14:38,370
I feel like I'm not going to

2990
03:14:38,370 --> 03:14:40,370
complete this without a different mask.

2991
03:14:40,370 --> 03:14:52,340
Window through there. I gotta kill

2992
03:14:52,340 --> 03:14:54,340
this guy right now.

2993
03:14:54,340 --> 03:14:56,340
Watch out for the dog. How did you

2994
03:14:56,340 --> 03:14:59,729
saw me through the window?

2995
03:14:59,729 --> 03:15:05,040
Okay. That's not fair.

2996
03:15:05,040 --> 03:15:07,040
Not fair. That's going to make

2997
03:15:07,040 --> 03:15:09,040
me escape the game and go put a new mask

2998
03:15:09,040 --> 03:15:11,040
on because that was fucking dumb.

2999
03:15:11,040 --> 03:15:13,040
That was dumb? Everything about that was

3000
03:15:13,040 --> 03:15:22,579
stupid. He spun around like

3001
03:15:22,579 --> 03:15:24,579
three times and then landed on me.

3002
03:15:24,579 --> 03:15:26,579
Alright, let's do the rat.

3003
03:15:26,579 --> 03:15:34,950
Silenced Uzi. Easy enough.

3004
03:15:34,950 --> 03:15:42,950
I'm not going to use it yet.

3005
03:15:42,950 --> 03:15:45,829
Why would you? Get on him.

3006
03:15:45,829 --> 03:15:47,829
Get on top of his head.

3007
03:15:47,829 --> 03:15:49,829
Give me the Uzi. Silenced. That's not

3008
03:15:49,829 --> 03:15:51,829
an Uzi. Where's my Uzi?

3009
03:15:51,829 --> 03:15:59,239
That's not an Uzi.

3010
03:15:59,239 --> 03:16:02,309
There it is. Alright.

3011
03:16:02,309 --> 03:16:07,559
Beautiful. This is going to be so much

3012
03:16:07,559 --> 03:16:13,700
easier. Through the wall

3013
03:16:13,700 --> 03:16:15,700
here. Gonna get this guy through the window.

3014
03:16:15,700 --> 03:16:17,700
No, actually I'm going to get you.

3015
03:16:17,700 --> 03:16:25,700
Holy fuck. He tripped

3016
03:16:25,700 --> 03:16:28,129
and died I think. Alright, we're good?

3017
03:16:28,129 --> 03:16:30,440
Much better start than anything I've done

3018
03:16:30,440 --> 03:16:38,690
before. Here comes the dog.

3019
03:16:38,690 --> 03:16:47,590
Oh my fucking lord.

3020
03:16:47,590 --> 03:16:49,590
Of course the monster truck's in the way.

3021
03:16:49,590 --> 03:16:51,760
Which way though?

3022
03:16:51,760 --> 03:16:53,760
Which way is the way where I'm not going to get

3023
03:16:53,760 --> 03:16:55,760
sniped by some random person?

3024
03:16:55,760 --> 03:17:00,500
That is the right way. See?

3025
03:17:00,500 --> 03:17:02,500
First time I put the Uzi on, it's over.

3026
03:17:02,500 --> 03:17:28,799
I just feel like this is wrong

3027
03:17:28,799 --> 03:17:42,760
again. I feel slower

3028
03:17:42,760 --> 03:17:44,760
again. Why?

3029
03:17:44,760 --> 03:17:47,889
Blaming mouse? Yeah,

3030
03:17:47,889 --> 03:17:49,889
I am going to blame the mouse with the two buttons

3031
03:17:49,889 --> 03:17:51,889
right sitting on your index finger

3032
03:17:51,889 --> 03:17:53,889
and middle finger where if you press them

3033
03:17:53,889 --> 03:17:55,889
it changes the DPI of your mouse.

3034
03:17:55,889 --> 03:17:57,889
And the only way to change it is if you

3035
03:17:57,889 --> 03:18:00,389
download Razor's

3036
03:18:00,389 --> 03:18:02,389
program that boots up

3037
03:18:02,389 --> 03:18:04,389
every time Windows starts. You have to go in and force

3038
03:18:04,389 --> 03:18:06,389
it to not turn on. To change

3039
03:18:06,389 --> 03:18:08,389
one combination. I can't believe I'm going to do that.

3040
03:18:08,389 --> 03:18:11,329
I'm about to give in.

3041
03:18:11,329 --> 03:18:13,329
I'm about to give in and download the

3042
03:18:13,329 --> 03:18:15,329
worst piece of fucking software that currently

3043
03:18:15,329 --> 03:18:17,329
exists. It's Razor

3044
03:18:17,329 --> 03:18:34,159
Synapse. Yeah, Razor

3045
03:18:34,159 --> 03:18:36,159
Synapse is if Skype and Uplay

3046
03:18:36,159 --> 03:18:39,879
had a baby and forced

3047
03:18:39,879 --> 03:18:53,059
your peripherals to use it.

3048
03:18:53,059 --> 03:19:06,549
What killed me?

3049
03:19:06,549 --> 03:19:08,549
Alright, somebody, wait, first of all, somebody correct me if I'm

3050
03:19:08,549 --> 03:19:11,040
wrong here, okay?

3051
03:19:11,040 --> 03:19:13,040
Is that the only possible way

3052
03:19:13,040 --> 03:19:15,040
that I can change is what that does?

3053
03:19:15,040 --> 03:19:17,040
Or can I go into my actual

3054
03:19:17,040 --> 03:19:19,040
Windows mouse settings? Is it correct?

3055
03:19:19,040 --> 03:19:21,040
Or do I have to go get Razor Synapse?

3056
03:19:21,040 --> 03:19:31,540
Change the settings and

3057
03:19:31,540 --> 03:19:33,540
uninstall it but won't uninstalling it

3058
03:19:33,540 --> 03:19:41,350
remove the settings? There are some

3059
03:19:41,350 --> 03:19:51,399
softwares to disable them.

3060
03:19:51,399 --> 03:19:53,399
Super glue.

3061
03:19:53,399 --> 03:20:04,079
I can't go, hold on,

3062
03:20:04,079 --> 03:20:06,079
I can't go this way.

3063
03:20:06,079 --> 03:20:08,079
Why would, come on, invisible wall

3064
03:20:08,079 --> 03:20:13,200
Yeah, because this is wrong again.

3065
03:20:13,200 --> 03:20:15,200
I just click the button

3066
03:20:15,200 --> 03:20:17,200
up for higher DPI.

3067
03:20:17,200 --> 03:20:32,180
Put that button on the bottom of the mouse.

3068
03:20:32,180 --> 03:20:42,469
Anybody following me?

3069
03:20:42,469 --> 03:20:47,329
Oh, shit!

3070
03:20:47,329 --> 03:20:49,329
No, that was so cool too and I blew it!

3071
03:20:49,329 --> 03:20:53,680
Alright, I swear

3072
03:20:53,680 --> 03:20:56,629
to God, guys, it's

3073
03:20:56,629 --> 03:20:58,629
changing it even when I don't press it.

3074
03:20:58,629 --> 03:21:04,129
I just impressed all my friends and it didn't even matter.

3075
03:21:04,129 --> 03:21:15,520
Dead, alright.

3076
03:21:15,520 --> 03:21:19,620
He's up there, nobody, nobody down following me.

3077
03:21:19,620 --> 03:21:22,629
Door's gonna knock this guy

3078
03:21:22,629 --> 03:21:24,629
out, right? No, it's not.

3079
03:21:24,629 --> 03:21:34,229
It's not gonna do that, actually.

3080
03:21:34,229 --> 03:21:41,270
Window, I would just rent

3081
03:21:41,270 --> 03:21:43,270
What the hell happened? What?

3082
03:21:43,270 --> 03:22:08,159
That guy came all the way down from over here.

3083
03:22:08,159 --> 03:22:10,159
Get rid of the guys in the toilet.

3084
03:22:10,159 --> 03:22:22,389
Oh, no!

3085
03:22:22,389 --> 03:22:26,549
There's no guns, there's no bullets.

3086
03:22:26,549 --> 03:22:34,530
Okay, now I don't have to worry about that anymore.

3087
03:22:34,530 --> 03:22:39,079
I have one shot.

3088
03:22:39,079 --> 03:22:41,079
Thank God there's a gun right here.

3089
03:22:41,079 --> 03:22:43,079
No,

3090
03:22:43,079 --> 03:22:45,079
no, I have to, I have to kill this guy.

3091
03:22:45,079 --> 03:22:47,079
I have to shoot this guy

3092
03:22:47,079 --> 03:22:49,079
with one bullet, I have to.

3093
03:22:56,690 --> 03:23:14,920
Trying a different technique there.

3094
03:23:14,920 --> 03:23:17,090
I can't, I can't, I'm trying to pick

3095
03:23:17,090 --> 03:23:20,870
the fucking knife up.

3096
03:23:20,870 --> 03:23:22,870
I'm just tilting. I'm just on full tilt

3097
03:23:22,870 --> 03:23:29,270
right now.

3098
03:23:29,270 --> 03:23:31,270
That guy was just lying on the goddamn ground.

3099
03:23:31,270 --> 03:23:42,850
Fucking God, I'm going

3100
03:23:42,850 --> 03:23:48,610
to scream.

3101
03:23:48,610 --> 03:23:50,610
I, no, oh, don't.

3102
03:23:50,610 --> 03:24:02,040
Fuck am I gonna, fuck this.

3103
03:24:02,040 --> 03:24:07,729
God, this is

3104
03:24:07,729 --> 03:24:09,729
unbearable!

3105
03:24:09,729 --> 03:24:14,260
Ugh!

3106
03:24:14,260 --> 03:24:20,079
Ugh!

3107
03:24:20,079 --> 03:24:25,200
Why didn't these guys get attracted this time?

3108
03:24:25,200 --> 03:24:27,200
Why didn't the whole fucking left side of the entire game

3109
03:24:27,200 --> 03:24:29,200
come down this time?

3110
03:24:29,200 --> 03:24:31,440
Why? Why does it only happen like

3111
03:24:31,440 --> 03:24:33,440
40% of the time?

3112
03:24:33,440 --> 03:24:58,469
What are you doing here?

3113
03:24:58,469 --> 03:25:02,950
No!

3114
03:25:02,950 --> 03:25:04,950
I'll be right back. I'm gonna go pee.

3115
03:25:04,950 --> 03:28:00,440
Fuck!

3116
03:28:00,440 --> 03:28:08,180
What am I doing? I didn't even say hi

3117
03:28:08,180 --> 03:28:20,340
that I'm back.

3118
03:28:20,340 --> 03:28:22,340
I'm almost at that point where

3119
03:28:22,340 --> 03:28:24,340
nothing I do works because I've lost it.

3120
03:28:24,340 --> 03:28:26,340
I've lost it all.

3121
03:28:26,340 --> 03:28:32,229
You know what I mean? Like I'm almost at the-

3122
03:28:32,229 --> 03:28:34,229
And here he comes! And I need a gun! How do I do

3123
03:28:34,229 --> 03:28:48,559
this to him?

3124
03:28:48,559 --> 03:28:50,559
Not even one pellet decided to go around the fucking

3125
03:28:50,559 --> 03:28:52,799
wall. Jesus, fuck

3126
03:28:52,799 --> 03:28:57,409
me. Here he comes.

3127
03:28:57,409 --> 03:29:02,399
Okay, this fucking guy's

3128
03:29:02,399 --> 03:29:04,399
dead. It's over. I don't have to worry about

3129
03:29:04,399 --> 03:29:06,399
that anymore. It's done. Just don't lose

3130
03:29:06,399 --> 03:29:23,430
him, the toilet guy.

3131
03:29:23,430 --> 03:29:25,670
I'm fucking panicking right now.

3132
03:29:25,670 --> 03:29:27,670
What are you guys over here? Why?

3133
03:29:27,670 --> 03:29:30,420
What the hell?

3134
03:29:30,420 --> 03:29:32,420
Why? What the fuck? It threw me off

3135
03:29:32,420 --> 03:29:34,420
so bad. It threw me off

3136
03:29:34,420 --> 03:29:36,420
so badly. It just threw

3137
03:29:36,420 --> 03:29:38,420
me off so badly.

3138
03:29:42,690 --> 03:29:44,690
Okay, I don't even- Shoot these

3139
03:29:44,690 --> 03:29:46,690
guys. Shoot them!

3140
03:29:46,690 --> 03:29:56,469
Be done with it!

3141
03:29:56,469 --> 03:29:58,469
Is he- Is fucking- Is the butcher coming

3142
03:29:58,469 --> 03:30:01,479
over here? No.

3143
03:30:01,479 --> 03:30:10,629
Deal with the butcher first. Here comes the butcher,

3144
03:30:10,629 --> 03:30:16,629
right? I didn't-

3145
03:30:16,629 --> 03:30:19,000
Okay. Now I don't have a gun.

3146
03:30:19,000 --> 03:30:24,879
I don't have a gun. I don't have any bullets.

3147
03:30:24,879 --> 03:30:27,700
Same exact problem last time. No, we're good.

3148
03:30:27,700 --> 03:30:39,350
Here's one. Just a melee.

3149
03:30:39,350 --> 03:30:46,950
Oh fuck. Who's next? Who's

3150
03:30:46,950 --> 03:30:48,950
left? Anybody else up there? I have ten rounds.

3151
03:30:48,950 --> 03:30:50,950
No windows. Good. Just get in

3152
03:30:50,950 --> 03:30:52,950
here. No windows. One guy with a shotgun.

3153
03:30:52,950 --> 03:30:55,319
Nobody else in the room?

3154
03:30:55,319 --> 03:30:57,319
Just this one guy with a shotgun. That's it, right?

3155
03:30:57,319 --> 03:31:00,129
Watch out for the window.

3156
03:31:00,129 --> 03:31:02,129
Just go like this. Beep! Okay, I beeped him.

3157
03:31:02,129 --> 03:31:04,129
And now beep this guy.

3158
03:31:04,129 --> 03:31:07,459
And there's one more guy to beep over here.

3159
03:31:07,459 --> 03:31:09,829
This last guy right there.

3160
03:31:09,829 --> 03:31:13,600
Beeped him. Okay. Let's go back the other way.

3161
03:31:13,600 --> 03:31:27,040
That's it. It's just this

3162
03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:29,600
guy right here.

3163
03:31:29,600 --> 03:31:31,600
Is this a bad guy or

3164
03:31:31,600 --> 03:31:33,600
is this- I don't even-

3165
03:31:33,600 --> 03:31:35,600
I'm just gonna unload him when I open the room.

3166
03:31:35,600 --> 03:31:46,930
Okay, look. I don't want no

3167
03:31:46,930 --> 03:31:48,930
trouble. The save is open.

3168
03:31:48,930 --> 03:31:50,930
Just take what you want and go.

3169
03:31:50,930 --> 03:31:52,930
Look, I'm not the owner and he's not here.

3170
03:31:52,930 --> 03:31:54,930
I just run the club. Let's be

3171
03:31:54,930 --> 03:31:58,260
civil about this.

3172
03:31:58,260 --> 03:32:00,260
Alright, alright. I'll give you his address.

3173
03:32:00,260 --> 03:32:02,500
Just please don't hurt me. Can you get

3174
03:32:02,500 --> 03:32:04,500
shot from the residual

3175
03:32:04,500 --> 03:32:06,500
bullet or something?

3176
03:32:06,500 --> 03:32:09,569
Please just go now. He's on

3177
03:32:09,569 --> 03:32:11,569
114th place.

3178
03:32:11,569 --> 03:32:28,959
My goodness.

3179
03:32:28,959 --> 03:32:30,959
Anything else? Any money or something I can grab?

3180
03:32:30,959 --> 03:32:43,750
That's it, right?

3181
03:32:43,750 --> 03:32:46,690
God. Hey, look.

3182
03:32:46,690 --> 03:32:48,690
It's the car. Remember this?

3183
03:32:48,690 --> 03:33:00,209
I can feel my sanity

3184
03:33:00,209 --> 03:33:02,209
slowly slipping away during that level.

3185
03:33:02,209 --> 03:33:13,090
New weapon unlocked.

3186
03:33:13,090 --> 03:33:17,250
Combo, combo, combo, combo, combo, combo.

3187
03:33:17,250 --> 03:33:19,250
C+.

3188
03:33:19,250 --> 03:33:21,620
I'm alright.

3189
03:33:21,620 --> 03:33:25,010
New mask. We got Oscar.

3190
03:33:25,010 --> 03:33:31,920
And the weapon is a sledgehammer.

3191
03:33:31,920 --> 03:33:39,729
Showdown. This is the

3192
03:33:39,729 --> 03:33:41,729
last level. Final chapter.

3193
03:33:41,729 --> 03:33:47,600
Alright, let's take a look.

3194
03:33:47,600 --> 03:33:49,600
This is called darkness.

3195
03:33:49,600 --> 03:33:51,600
I don't even know what- I don't know if I want to do that.

3196
03:33:51,600 --> 03:33:54,360
I didn't get the secret mask. Survive two

3197
03:33:54,360 --> 03:33:57,559
bullets.

3198
03:33:57,559 --> 03:34:02,290
I want to start with the gun.

3199
03:34:02,290 --> 03:34:07,719
Okay, here it is.

3200
03:34:07,719 --> 03:34:11,489
Alright, two. Okay.

3201
03:34:11,489 --> 03:34:13,489
Just making sure there's nothing in here.

3202
03:34:13,489 --> 03:34:17,139
Holy fuck.

3203
03:34:17,139 --> 03:34:19,139
That was right when I opened the door.

3204
03:34:19,139 --> 03:34:21,639
Alright, I got another gun.

3205
03:34:21,639 --> 03:34:28,040
Another gun.

3206
03:34:28,040 --> 03:34:31,299
No, no. I want to get that- why did I do that?

3207
03:34:31,299 --> 03:34:37,000
I got it, thank god.

3208
03:34:37,000 --> 03:34:39,809
And who do we have here?

3209
03:34:39,809 --> 03:34:41,809
You must be one of the assholes

3210
03:34:41,809 --> 03:34:43,809
killing off my men.

3211
03:34:43,809 --> 03:34:45,809
Doesn't look like you are here to chat, so why don't

3212
03:34:45,809 --> 03:34:58,799
we get this over with?

3213
03:34:58,799 --> 03:35:00,799
Pick it up. Pick-

3214
03:35:00,799 --> 03:35:14,239
Okay. Leave him to me.

3215
03:35:14,239 --> 03:35:18,319
What the fuck?

3216
03:35:18,319 --> 03:35:29,270
Oh. Leave him to me.

3217
03:35:29,270 --> 03:35:31,700
What in the name of god

3218
03:35:31,700 --> 03:35:33,940
do- you don't even

3219
03:35:33,940 --> 03:35:35,940
give me a quarter of a second to react.

3220
03:35:35,940 --> 03:35:39,329
Where am I supposed to go?

3221
03:35:39,329 --> 03:35:48,799
Behind a wall? Leave him to me.

3222
03:35:48,799 --> 03:36:00,629
They swing

3223
03:36:00,629 --> 03:36:02,629
twice. The dash twice.

3224
03:36:02,629 --> 03:36:13,959
One, two-

3225
03:36:13,959 --> 03:36:26,500
Shit.

3226
03:36:26,500 --> 03:36:40,000
Damn it. Leave him to me.

3227
03:36:40,000 --> 03:36:47,670
Crush her head. Crush it. What do I do?

3228
03:36:47,670 --> 03:36:50,360
I'm not- not bad. I'm impressed.

3229
03:36:50,360 --> 03:36:52,360
I wonder what gave you this thirst for blood.

3230
03:36:52,360 --> 03:36:54,600
I've never seen anything quite like it.

3231
03:36:54,600 --> 03:36:56,600
Now I want to see who's

3232
03:36:56,600 --> 03:36:58,600
hiding behind the mask.

3233
03:36:58,600 --> 03:37:30,639
Like, not bad. I'm impressed.

3234
03:37:30,639 --> 03:37:32,639
I wonder what gave you this thirst for blood.

3235
03:37:32,639 --> 03:37:34,639
I've never seen anything quite like it.

3236
03:37:34,639 --> 03:37:36,639
Now I want to see who's hiding behind the mask.

3237
03:37:36,639 --> 03:37:51,620
I'm gonna- I'm gonna stand back here.

3238
03:37:51,620 --> 03:37:54,950
Come down here. You come fucking

3239
03:37:54,950 --> 03:37:56,950
get me over here. What the fuck?

3240
03:37:56,950 --> 03:38:13,010
Really? Why?

3241
03:38:13,010 --> 03:38:15,010
So I can't do that. She instantly

3242
03:38:15,010 --> 03:38:17,010
will kill me. She instantly throws a knife at me.

3243
03:38:17,010 --> 03:38:19,010
If you try to hide behind the

3244
03:38:19,010 --> 03:38:31,680
fountain. She just throws a knife

3245
03:38:31,680 --> 03:38:34,120
behind cover. Yeah, she

3246
03:38:34,120 --> 03:38:49,219
does. Alright, I'm just gonna

3247
03:38:49,219 --> 03:38:51,219
fucking sprint. Not bad. Yeah, yeah,

3248
03:38:51,219 --> 03:38:55,510
yeah, yeah. Odd.

3249
03:38:55,510 --> 03:39:41,440
Well, I fucked it up.

3250
03:39:41,440 --> 03:39:43,440
I'm just gonna run to the fountain right to the right.

3251
03:39:43,440 --> 03:39:45,440
Go ahead and see what happens. I need like a

3252
03:39:45,440 --> 03:39:49,159
knife. Jesus Christ.

3253
03:39:49,159 --> 03:40:07,329
This is ridiculous.

3254
03:40:07,329 --> 03:40:19,170
Why did they drop? Fucked here.

3255
03:40:19,170 --> 03:40:27,360
Ah, okay, so does he reload?

3256
03:40:27,360 --> 03:40:29,540
Okay, so he goes, reload.

3257
03:40:29,540 --> 03:40:31,540
Oh, fuck.

3258
03:40:31,540 --> 03:40:42,420
Did I get him? What do I do now?

3259
03:40:42,420 --> 03:40:44,420
I don't understand. Do I have to go

3260
03:40:44,420 --> 03:40:46,420
and attack him or something? He only has one

3261
03:40:46,420 --> 03:40:51,200
hand. One, two.

3262
03:40:51,200 --> 03:41:02,850
I did it. I can see where this

3263
03:41:02,850 --> 03:41:04,850
is going. I'll spare you

3264
03:41:04,850 --> 03:41:07,860
the pleasure.

3265
03:41:07,860 --> 03:41:09,860
What the fuck was that? I don't understand. My body

3266
03:41:09,860 --> 03:41:11,860
can't handle what just happened. What happened?

3267
03:41:11,860 --> 03:41:17,799
That's it, okay. Give me

3268
03:41:17,799 --> 03:41:23,299
this. Hello? Hello?

3269
03:41:23,299 --> 03:41:25,299
Hello, hello?

3270
03:41:25,299 --> 03:41:27,299
It's your first day. What's going on

3271
03:41:27,299 --> 03:41:30,690
down there? I'm trying to sleep. Is there anyone

3272
03:41:30,690 --> 03:41:39,139
there? Can you hear me? Hello? Goddamn

3273
03:41:39,139 --> 03:41:47,459
phones. I fucking hate these things.

3274
03:41:47,459 --> 03:42:00,120
Okay. There's more? Oh, shit.

3275
03:42:00,120 --> 03:42:06,520
It's the architect.

3276
03:42:06,520 --> 03:42:10,420
Oh, so you're the one causing the ruckus.

3277
03:42:10,420 --> 03:42:13,809
What's your business here? Actually,

3278
03:42:13,809 --> 03:42:16,879
why don't we skip the details?

3279
03:42:16,879 --> 03:42:18,879
I've done so many horrible things.

3280
03:42:18,879 --> 03:42:22,020
Garfield, no.

3281
03:42:22,020 --> 03:42:24,020
Nothing seems to really matter anymore, does it?

3282
03:42:24,020 --> 03:42:26,319
I'm not going anywhere, as you can see.

3283
03:42:26,319 --> 03:42:28,319
Just go ahead and do whatever you came here

3284
03:42:28,319 --> 03:42:35,030
to do.

3285
03:42:35,030 --> 03:42:39,510
Alright. Take the mask off.

3286
03:42:39,510 --> 03:42:47,569
Smoke a cigarette.

3287
03:42:47,569 --> 03:42:49,569
I'm one of my children from Pokemon.

3288
03:42:49,569 --> 03:42:53,799
Did I take a selfie? Oh, I threw the phone.

3289
03:42:53,799 --> 03:43:14,399
Okay. Yes, the iPhone

3290
03:43:14,399 --> 03:43:16,399
from the 80s.

3291
03:43:23,940 --> 03:43:26,760
The end. Well, that was fun.

3292
03:43:26,760 --> 03:43:30,959
That was, at some point,

3293
03:43:30,959 --> 03:43:32,959
it was kind of like chewing on

3294
03:43:32,959 --> 03:43:43,649
nails. But that was fun.

3295
03:43:43,649 --> 03:43:49,090
Music by Moon.

3296
03:43:49,090 --> 03:43:51,090
Very good. Very good

3297
03:43:51,090 --> 03:43:53,649
song. Very good

3298
03:43:53,649 --> 03:44:01,719
composing.

3299
03:44:01,719 --> 03:44:04,850
What's everybody doing?

3300
03:44:04,850 --> 03:44:09,520
It's not over.

3301
03:44:09,520 --> 03:44:16,180
Well, we're getting the credits. Is there

3302
03:44:16,180 --> 03:44:18,180
an after credits Infinity War scene?

3303
03:44:18,180 --> 03:44:28,739
So, should I press space

3304
03:44:28,739 --> 03:44:30,739
or something? Or are we just going to

3305
03:44:30,739 --> 03:44:32,739
watch all the credits?

3306
03:44:32,739 --> 03:44:47,010
Watch the credits, you boomer.

3307
03:44:47,010 --> 03:44:52,200
How is not watching the credits

3308
03:44:52,200 --> 03:44:54,500
a not boomer thing?

3309
03:44:54,500 --> 03:44:59,879
You usually get up from

3310
03:44:59,879 --> 03:45:01,879
the movie. Yes, that after credits

3311
03:45:01,879 --> 03:45:04,309
scenes have been a

3312
03:45:04,309 --> 03:45:06,309
fairly new phenomenon over

3313
03:45:06,309 --> 03:45:08,309
the last 15 years, 10 years or so.

3314
03:45:08,309 --> 03:45:11,000
It really was only in a

3315
03:45:11,000 --> 03:45:13,000
handful of movies and almost every movie

3316
03:45:13,000 --> 03:45:15,000
has an after credits scene.

3317
03:45:15,000 --> 03:45:31,959
That 33 year old boomer

3318
03:45:31,959 --> 03:45:33,959
that doesn't watch the credits.

3319
03:45:33,959 --> 03:45:40,159
But there was no reason to

3320
03:45:40,159 --> 03:45:42,159
20 years ago. When the movie

3321
03:45:42,159 --> 03:45:44,159
was over, you were like, oh, okay, that was

3322
03:45:44,159 --> 03:45:46,159
a good movie. And then you would

3323
03:45:46,159 --> 03:45:48,159
this is the time where you'd hear like

3324
03:45:48,159 --> 03:45:50,790
okay, did you get your phone?

3325
03:45:50,790 --> 03:45:52,790
Yeah, yeah. Don't leave any trash there.

3326
03:45:52,790 --> 03:45:55,540
Pick that up. Okay.

3327
03:45:55,540 --> 03:45:57,540
Anything left in your drink? Can I have a sip of your drink?

3328
03:45:57,540 --> 03:45:59,909
Let me check my phone.

3329
03:45:59,909 --> 03:46:01,909
Okay, you get keys?

3330
03:46:01,909 --> 03:46:03,909
That's what happened here

3331
03:46:03,909 --> 03:46:17,860
during the credits.

3332
03:46:17,860 --> 03:46:19,860
How can you be 33 and bald?

3333
03:46:19,860 --> 03:46:24,149
I'm not! Dude,

3334
03:46:24,149 --> 03:46:26,149
you understand that?

3335
03:46:26,149 --> 03:46:28,149
Hold on, listen to me, guys.

3336
03:46:28,149 --> 03:46:30,639
Some of you guys might be young and

3337
03:46:30,639 --> 03:46:32,639
so full of energy.

3338
03:46:32,639 --> 03:46:34,639
But let me tell you,

3339
03:46:34,639 --> 03:46:36,639
everybody starts to kind of thin a little bit

3340
03:46:36,639 --> 03:46:38,639
when they get to be 30 years old.

3341
03:46:38,639 --> 03:46:40,639
It happens. Some people

3342
03:46:40,639 --> 03:46:42,639
they get the real good

3343
03:46:42,639 --> 03:46:44,639
dice roll there and they don't lose any hair.

3344
03:46:44,639 --> 03:46:46,639
But for the most part, most of us

3345
03:46:46,639 --> 03:46:48,639
lose our damn hair after like

3346
03:46:48,639 --> 03:46:50,639
28.

3347
03:46:50,639 --> 03:46:52,639
28 to like 35

3348
03:46:52,639 --> 03:46:54,639
is when you start to really thin out a little.

3349
03:46:54,639 --> 03:47:03,159
So it's going to happen to all of us.

3350
03:47:03,159 --> 03:47:05,159
And some of you guys here have probably already

3351
03:47:05,159 --> 03:47:07,159
happened it to. It's fine.

3352
03:47:07,159 --> 03:47:09,159
There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with it at all.

3353
03:47:09,159 --> 03:47:15,809
Maybe for you, Boomer, but I'll have

3354
03:47:15,809 --> 03:47:20,799
future hair. No.

3355
03:47:20,799 --> 03:47:22,799
No, your Fortnite skin doesn't count,

3356
03:47:22,799 --> 03:47:32,920
okay? Part 5!

3357
03:47:32,920 --> 03:47:35,600
Answers.

3358
03:47:35,600 --> 03:47:39,510
That's the

3359
03:47:39,510 --> 03:47:41,510
exact same sound effect.

3360
03:47:41,510 --> 03:47:45,670
That's the same sound effect.

3361
03:47:45,670 --> 03:47:47,670
You think I'm stupid, huh? I look stupid to you?

3362
03:47:47,670 --> 03:47:49,909
I know you aren't telling me

3363
03:47:49,909 --> 03:47:53,489
everything. You helped

3364
03:47:53,489 --> 03:47:55,489
me get into this mess. You told

3365
03:47:55,489 --> 03:47:57,489
me it would be exciting, didn't you? Well, I'm

3366
03:47:57,489 --> 03:47:59,489
fucking bored. I'm done, man. I've had it.

3367
03:47:59,489 --> 03:48:01,489
I want out and you're going to tell me how.

3368
03:48:01,489 --> 03:48:03,489
This stupid game is going to end now, you hear me?

3369
03:48:03,489 --> 03:48:06,500
All right, all right. Calm down, man.

3370
03:48:06,500 --> 03:48:08,500
You don't realize how much trouble

3371
03:48:08,500 --> 03:48:10,500
I'll be in. There's a guy

3372
03:48:10,500 --> 03:48:12,500
hiding out at the Blue Dragon.

3373
03:48:12,500 --> 03:48:14,500
A tiny Chinese restaurant

3374
03:48:14,500 --> 03:48:16,500
downtown. He knows more.

3375
03:48:16,500 --> 03:48:18,500
Just don't mention my name to anyone, okay?

3376
03:48:18,500 --> 03:48:20,500
I'm as good as dead anyways.

3377
03:48:20,500 --> 03:48:22,870
New character.

3378
03:48:22,870 --> 03:48:26,069
Is that...I don't know what that is.

3379
03:48:26,069 --> 03:48:33,680
Motorcycle?

3380
03:48:33,680 --> 03:48:36,309
I get to play as the cool character.

3381
03:48:36,309 --> 03:48:38,309
Safe house.

3382
03:48:38,309 --> 03:48:40,610
This is 16th chapter.

3383
03:48:40,610 --> 03:48:43,559
Three knives?

3384
03:48:43,559 --> 03:48:45,559
Like, I have a

3385
03:48:45,559 --> 03:48:47,559
butcher knife. What the

3386
03:48:47,559 --> 03:48:49,559
hell? Oh, there's a...I didn't

3387
03:48:49,559 --> 03:48:52,120
even...I didn't even see.

3388
03:48:52,120 --> 03:48:54,120
Okay, I gotta get back into this. I spent a whole, like,

3389
03:48:54,120 --> 03:48:56,120
30 minutes watching the credits.

3390
03:48:56,120 --> 03:49:09,729
Oh, you fuck.

3391
03:49:09,729 --> 03:49:13,569
We got...I crawl...can he shoot me from there?

3392
03:49:13,569 --> 03:49:16,000
Oh, idiot.

3393
03:49:16,000 --> 03:49:22,959
Any windows?

3394
03:49:22,959 --> 03:49:24,959
Wait, I can't...can I not pick up guns?

3395
03:49:24,959 --> 03:49:27,329
Is this this character's thing? He can't pick up

3396
03:49:27,329 --> 03:49:33,350
any...I can't pick up weapons.

3397
03:49:33,350 --> 03:49:35,350
Can I pick up anything? I have...it's only melee.

3398
03:49:35,350 --> 03:49:37,350
Alright, let's go! Let's go!

3399
03:49:37,350 --> 03:49:39,350
Fucking let's go!

3400
03:49:39,350 --> 03:49:50,930
Alright, can I pick up the knives that I drop?

3401
03:49:50,930 --> 03:49:56,629
Can I pick these up?

3402
03:49:56,629 --> 03:50:04,440
I'm so confused right now. What the fuck?

3403
03:50:04,440 --> 03:50:06,870
You can't pick up the knives.

3404
03:50:06,870 --> 03:50:10,899
You can only pick up missed

3405
03:50:10,899 --> 03:50:12,899
knives. Okay, well, now I'm

3406
03:50:12,899 --> 03:50:17,440
screwed again. I'm

3407
03:50:17,440 --> 03:50:31,520
dead. It's impossible.

3408
03:50:31,520 --> 03:50:33,520
Okay, so I cannot pick up knives unless I

3409
03:50:33,520 --> 03:50:37,680
miss. So just don't throw them.

3410
03:50:37,680 --> 03:50:41,270
Except throw it at this guy,

3411
03:50:41,270 --> 03:50:43,270
because I have to. Alright.

3412
03:50:43,270 --> 03:50:45,270
I need to get this one more

3413
03:50:45,270 --> 03:50:47,270
knife and use it on this guy, because

3414
03:50:47,270 --> 03:50:49,270
these three guys I can take out with the knife.

3415
03:50:49,270 --> 03:50:51,889
The question is,

3416
03:50:51,889 --> 03:50:53,889
what's the angle here?

3417
03:50:53,889 --> 03:50:57,840
Okay. Alright. There's no

3418
03:50:57,840 --> 03:50:59,840
door. Be aware of that. No

3419
03:50:59,840 --> 03:51:24,149
door. Got it.

3420
03:51:24,149 --> 03:51:26,149
Okay, here's the plan. I have to

3421
03:51:26,149 --> 03:51:31,079
run through. Fuck. Why are you

3422
03:51:31,079 --> 03:51:33,440
not noticing me? Why did you not

3423
03:51:33,440 --> 03:51:35,440
notice me? Why did you...I'm so

3424
03:51:35,440 --> 03:51:37,440
bad. I'm so mad that they

3425
03:51:37,440 --> 03:51:44,040
didn't notice me. What's going on?

3426
03:51:44,040 --> 03:51:47,620
Look here, punk. I've got some

3427
03:51:47,620 --> 03:51:49,620
things I need to know, so you better answer my

3428
03:51:49,620 --> 03:51:51,620
questions, okay? Who are the people

3429
03:51:51,620 --> 03:51:53,620
who keep leaving me messages?

3430
03:51:53,620 --> 03:51:55,620
And don't even think about bullshitting me now,

3431
03:51:55,620 --> 03:51:57,620
okay? I won't hesitate

3432
03:51:57,620 --> 03:51:59,620
to pull you apart if I have to.

3433
03:51:59,620 --> 03:52:02,559
I'll just tell you what I know,

3434
03:52:02,559 --> 03:52:04,559
just don't hurt me. I can't tell you

3435
03:52:04,559 --> 03:52:06,559
who's calling the shots, but they're using

3436
03:52:06,559 --> 03:52:10,559
Phenomenon

3437
03:52:10,559 --> 03:52:12,559
to sweep up their trails.

3438
03:52:12,559 --> 03:52:15,120
I only helped them set it

3439
03:52:15,120 --> 03:52:17,120
up at the station. You'll have to hack

3440
03:52:17,120 --> 03:52:19,120
into their system to trace them.

3441
03:52:19,120 --> 03:52:21,750
I went into hiding as soon as the job was finished.

3442
03:52:21,750 --> 03:52:23,750
They seemed to have some form of political

3443
03:52:23,750 --> 03:52:25,750
agenda. Scared the shit

3444
03:52:25,750 --> 03:52:27,750
out of me. I spent all my savings

3445
03:52:27,750 --> 03:52:29,750
on getting this rat hole. That's all

3446
03:52:29,750 --> 03:52:37,559
I have. Okay.

3447
03:52:37,559 --> 03:53:02,760
Charlie! Alright, now

3448
03:53:02,760 --> 03:53:13,319
roll the credits. That's the first

3449
03:53:13,319 --> 03:53:16,129
A of the evening.

3450
03:53:16,129 --> 03:53:18,129
We unlocked Rick. And

3451
03:53:18,129 --> 03:53:22,040
Charlie.

3452
03:53:25,489 --> 03:53:31,250
You have one message. Hello, it's Mark

3453
03:53:31,250 --> 03:53:33,250
from Miami Drop Off. It looks like you

3454
03:53:33,250 --> 03:53:35,250
missed your delivery last night.

3455
03:53:35,250 --> 03:53:37,250
We've got another parcel for you today.

3456
03:53:37,250 --> 03:53:39,250
Please drop it off at

3457
03:53:39,250 --> 03:53:41,250
...

3458
03:53:41,250 --> 03:53:43,250
Our clients will not tolerate further delays.

3459
03:53:56,049 --> 03:53:58,049
Fun Games

3460
03:53:58,049 --> 03:54:00,600
17.

3461
03:54:00,600 --> 03:54:02,600
How come I don't get to pick a mask?

3462
03:54:02,600 --> 03:54:08,850
What's going on with him?

3463
03:54:08,850 --> 03:54:10,850
Alright, that just freaked me out.

3464
03:54:10,850 --> 03:54:16,229
Anybody we need to throw a knife at?

3465
03:54:16,229 --> 03:54:20,639
Maybe. I think I can get this guy

3466
03:54:20,639 --> 03:54:24,360
without anyone knowing.

3467
03:54:24,360 --> 03:54:27,239
And his buddy?

3468
03:54:27,239 --> 03:54:29,239
I think I can do it all without

3469
03:54:29,239 --> 03:54:31,239
throwing a single knife.

3470
03:54:31,239 --> 03:54:33,479
So no, maybe not this guy right here.

3471
03:54:33,479 --> 03:54:35,780
I can definitely bait this guy in the room.

3472
03:54:35,780 --> 03:54:38,719
Now, the question is

3473
03:54:38,719 --> 03:54:40,719
can I kill this guy without throwing a knife?

3474
03:54:40,719 --> 03:54:46,360
That's gonna be very... I don't think so.

3475
03:54:46,360 --> 03:54:50,129
Maybe if he goes in the bathroom?

3476
03:54:50,129 --> 03:55:06,370
Got it. Okay. Clean.

3477
03:55:06,370 --> 03:55:11,360
Very clean.

3478
03:55:11,360 --> 03:55:13,360
Oh fuck, I thought that was a statue.

3479
03:55:13,360 --> 03:55:39,270
Whoa, you saw me.

3480
03:55:39,270 --> 03:55:41,270
Oh come on, you butt head.

3481
03:55:41,270 --> 03:55:59,569
Oh my god, I'm...

3482
03:55:59,569 --> 03:56:01,879
I can run into that.

3483
03:56:01,879 --> 03:56:03,879
Wait for him to come around again. Another dog. Good thing I waited.

3484
03:56:03,879 --> 03:56:13,280
Alright. Anybody left?

3485
03:56:13,280 --> 03:56:15,280
We got two down there, both melee.

3486
03:56:15,280 --> 03:56:18,159
Two guys with guns.

3487
03:56:18,159 --> 03:56:20,159
I should be able to get one too. Is there anybody else

3488
03:56:20,159 --> 03:56:22,159
in there that can shoot me

3489
03:56:22,159 --> 03:56:25,680
through the fucking window?

3490
03:56:25,680 --> 03:56:27,680
No. Okay. That guy can, but

3491
03:56:27,680 --> 03:56:29,680
they'll let these guys first.

3492
03:56:29,680 --> 03:56:32,879
So, I'm talking about a

3493
03:56:32,879 --> 03:56:34,879
go through, kill the...

3494
03:56:34,879 --> 03:56:36,879
I'm talking about wait till he goes up.

3495
03:56:36,879 --> 03:56:46,930
And then we'll talk. Alright.

3496
03:56:46,930 --> 03:56:54,719
Now we can talk. Oh fuck!

3497
03:56:54,719 --> 03:56:59,120
Okay, we're good.

3498
03:56:59,120 --> 03:57:01,120
Only these two guys left.

3499
03:57:01,120 --> 03:57:03,120
Don't get shot through the door.

3500
03:57:03,120 --> 03:57:05,620
This guy's gonna come at ya.

3501
03:57:05,620 --> 03:57:07,620
I seriously just panicked so hard

3502
03:57:07,620 --> 03:57:09,620
for no reason and this is the last guy.

3503
03:57:09,620 --> 03:57:11,620
One, two, three.

3504
03:57:11,620 --> 03:57:13,620
There's another guy! There's another guy!

3505
03:57:13,620 --> 03:57:21,860
Okay, we're fine.

3506
03:57:21,860 --> 03:57:23,860
My heart is killing me.

3507
03:57:23,860 --> 03:57:36,079
I kind of have a heart attack on camera.

3508
03:57:36,079 --> 03:57:38,079
I'm just gonna start going like...

3509
03:57:38,079 --> 03:57:43,200
Boomer gets heart attack.

3510
03:57:43,200 --> 03:57:45,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead, say it.

3511
03:57:45,200 --> 03:57:54,930
Go ahead. Chat wants face cam.

3512
03:57:54,930 --> 03:57:57,750
I don't have any clothes on. I'm not doing it.

3513
03:57:57,750 --> 03:58:01,760
Get Brandon.

3514
03:58:01,760 --> 03:58:04,770
There's another weapon that's been unlocked.

3515
03:58:04,770 --> 03:58:06,770
I'm not seeing these anywhere though.

3516
03:58:06,770 --> 03:58:08,770
Sludge hammer? I haven't seen a sludge hammer at all.

3517
03:58:08,770 --> 03:58:22,840
These people.

3518
03:58:22,840 --> 03:58:24,840
Give one new message. Hi, it's Jane.

3519
03:58:24,840 --> 03:58:26,840
It was nice to see you again. How about another date tonight?

3520
03:58:26,840 --> 03:58:28,840
Pick me up at

3521
03:58:28,840 --> 03:58:30,840
Northeast 158th Street around 9, okay?

3522
03:58:30,840 --> 03:58:32,840
And put on one of those nice suits you got.

3523
03:58:32,840 --> 03:58:34,840
You're taking me somewhere fancy this evening.

3524
03:58:34,840 --> 03:58:41,680
Show us your sweaty chest.

3525
03:58:41,680 --> 03:58:43,680
Sweaty chest.

3526
03:58:43,680 --> 03:58:55,059
Sweaty chest.

3527
03:58:55,059 --> 03:58:57,059
Eighteenth chapter, prank call.

3528
03:58:57,059 --> 03:59:01,860
So, we got...

3529
03:59:01,860 --> 03:59:03,860
Uh, they have guns?

3530
03:59:03,860 --> 03:59:06,360
Um, okay.

3531
03:59:06,360 --> 03:59:10,770
Do it.

3532
03:59:10,770 --> 03:59:14,610
I didn't get points for that.

3533
03:59:14,610 --> 03:59:18,200
Uh, sorry. It was just a prank call.

3534
03:59:18,200 --> 03:59:22,930
I don't understand.

3535
03:59:22,930 --> 03:59:29,329
Wait, am I the guy at the computer?

3536
03:59:29,329 --> 03:59:36,440
I'm the guy at the computer.

3537
03:59:36,440 --> 03:59:38,799
Stay away from me.

3538
03:59:38,799 --> 03:59:41,489
Security, security. Look, sir.

3539
03:59:41,489 --> 03:59:43,489
Please don't kill me. Please, I'll do anything.

3540
03:59:43,489 --> 03:59:52,260
Interesting. North

3541
03:59:52,260 --> 03:59:54,260
87th place, huh? So that's where you've been hiding.

3542
03:59:54,260 --> 03:59:56,950
That's me.

3543
03:59:56,950 --> 04:00:01,750
Get out of here if you don't want to die.

3544
04:00:01,750 --> 04:00:05,780
Okay, have it your way.

3545
04:00:05,780 --> 04:00:09,110
Wait, do I have to fight myself?

3546
04:00:09,110 --> 04:00:15,440
What the hell is going on?

3547
04:00:15,440 --> 04:00:17,440
You had your chance.

3548
04:00:17,440 --> 04:00:19,879
What?

3549
04:00:19,879 --> 04:00:25,760
I'm so confused.

3550
04:00:25,760 --> 04:00:27,760
That's not...

3551
04:00:27,760 --> 04:00:30,389
That's not canon.

3552
04:00:30,389 --> 04:00:32,389
You guys, that's not canon.

3553
04:00:32,389 --> 04:00:41,219
That's what that comes from.

3554
04:00:41,219 --> 04:00:45,190
They were just in the way.

3555
04:00:45,190 --> 04:00:47,190
That's why everyone said that.

3556
04:00:47,190 --> 04:00:57,680
And that's why I got spoiled.

3557
04:00:57,680 --> 04:00:59,680
So, what really happens?

3558
04:00:59,680 --> 04:01:01,680
You have one new message.

3559
04:01:01,680 --> 04:01:03,680
Hi, it's Ben from Miami Funeral Home.

3560
04:01:03,680 --> 04:01:08,760
I'm just calling to tell you we have the tombstone you ordered done and ready to be delivered.

3561
04:01:08,760 --> 04:01:10,760
With a little luck, you should be getting it before the weekend.

3562
04:01:10,760 --> 04:01:12,760
Click.

3563
04:01:12,760 --> 04:01:18,370
Okay.

3564
04:01:18,370 --> 04:01:29,250
19th chapter.

3565
04:01:29,250 --> 04:01:31,250
Resolution.

3566
04:01:31,250 --> 04:01:34,260
Resolution.

3567
04:01:34,260 --> 04:01:37,780
Here we go.

3568
04:01:37,780 --> 04:01:54,610
It was the janitor the whole time.

3569
04:01:54,610 --> 04:01:56,610
What's this? Looks like I need a password to access this computer.

3570
04:01:56,610 --> 04:01:59,620
It was the janitor.

3571
04:01:59,620 --> 04:02:01,620
I could have killed the janitor too when I had a chance.

3572
04:02:01,620 --> 04:02:09,110
Okay, this is just

3573
04:02:09,110 --> 04:02:11,110
the Riddler from Batman.

3574
04:02:11,110 --> 04:02:13,110
Didn't this happen in Arkham City?

3575
04:02:13,110 --> 04:02:15,989
What's going on down here?

3576
04:02:15,989 --> 04:02:21,430
Who are you people?

3577
04:02:21,430 --> 04:02:23,920
We're playing a game, aren't we?

3578
04:02:23,920 --> 04:02:25,920
And you're one of our pawns, aren't you?

3579
04:02:25,920 --> 04:02:28,930
I guess this means game over.

3580
04:02:28,930 --> 04:02:30,930
Who are you working for?

3581
04:02:30,930 --> 04:02:32,930
You're the phone guys.

3582
04:02:32,930 --> 04:02:34,930
What a stupid question you really need to ask.

3583
04:02:34,930 --> 04:02:36,930
What does it look like to you, asshole?

3584
04:02:36,930 --> 04:02:38,930
You don't know anything, do you?

3585
04:02:38,930 --> 04:02:40,930
You think this is a game?

3586
04:02:40,930 --> 04:02:44,709
Why are you doing this?

3587
04:02:44,709 --> 04:02:46,709
We were bored, that's why.

3588
04:02:46,709 --> 04:02:49,329
Why would we need to justify our actions?

3589
04:02:49,329 --> 04:02:51,329
You've done far worse things than we have, haven't you?

3590
04:02:51,329 --> 04:02:53,329
Do you even know how much money we're making?

3591
04:02:53,329 --> 04:02:57,750
Why are you killing people?

3592
04:02:57,750 --> 04:02:59,750
We haven't killed anyone, you have.

3593
04:02:59,750 --> 04:03:01,750
They were all scum anyway, weren't they?

3594
04:03:01,750 --> 04:03:03,750
You think they deserve to live, do you?

3595
04:03:03,750 --> 04:03:07,000
That's it.

3596
04:03:07,000 --> 04:03:09,000
You seem disappointed.

3597
04:03:09,000 --> 04:03:11,000
What were you expecting?

3598
04:03:11,000 --> 04:03:13,000
I think we're through with your questions.

3599
04:03:13,000 --> 04:03:15,000
Yeah, your move, creep.

3600
04:03:15,000 --> 04:03:32,260
Okay.

3601
04:03:32,260 --> 04:03:38,920
Where's the password?

3602
04:03:38,920 --> 04:03:42,500
Phil? Okay, I just got Phil.

3603
04:03:42,500 --> 04:03:48,520
So I don't have a password.

3604
04:03:48,520 --> 04:04:04,309
Uh.

3605
04:04:04,309 --> 04:04:06,309
The password is the secret from each level.

3606
04:04:06,309 --> 04:04:08,309
Oh, okay.

3607
04:04:08,309 --> 04:04:10,309
You have to find letters throughout every level and put them in order in the computer,

3608
04:04:10,309 --> 04:04:12,309
meaning you have to play through again if you want the true ending.

3609
04:04:12,309 --> 04:04:15,059
Oh, okay.

3610
04:04:15,059 --> 04:04:20,819
That's pretty cool, though.

3611
04:04:20,819 --> 04:04:29,520
You gotta collect the pixels.

3612
04:04:29,520 --> 04:04:32,790
So I can't even access it. Alright.

3613
04:04:32,790 --> 04:04:36,950
Gotta catch them all.

3614
04:04:36,950 --> 04:04:38,950
Each letter for the password is a tiny dot, so they're hard to find.

3615
04:04:38,950 --> 04:04:43,430
That's cool.

3616
04:04:43,430 --> 04:04:45,430
Watch the credits, boomer.

3617
04:04:45,430 --> 04:04:47,430
That was an entire after credit sequence.

3618
04:04:47,430 --> 04:04:49,430
But we're earning another credit after the after credit sequence.

3619
04:04:49,430 --> 04:04:52,819
Now imagine if that happened.

3620
04:04:52,819 --> 04:04:56,600
Oh my god.

3621
04:04:56,600 --> 04:04:58,600
The after credits of Deadpool.

3622
04:04:58,600 --> 04:05:00,600
I can't believe it.

3623
04:05:00,600 --> 04:05:02,600
Cable's gonna be in the next movie?

3624
04:05:02,600 --> 04:05:05,030
Alright, now roll all the credits again.

3625
04:05:05,030 --> 04:05:07,590
Wait, they do that, actually.

3626
04:05:07,590 --> 04:05:18,709
Did they do that? That was fun.

3627
04:05:18,709 --> 04:05:21,909
No, that was really, that was good.

3628
04:05:21,909 --> 04:05:23,909
That was rage inducing in a lot of places, but

3629
04:05:23,909 --> 04:05:25,909
you know, you have to

3630
04:05:25,909 --> 04:05:27,909
put your fucking pants on and play the game and do it.

3631
04:05:27,909 --> 04:05:34,049
How many times did I die?

3632
04:05:34,049 --> 04:05:37,379
Okay, I'm gonna guess like 2,

3633
04:05:37,379 --> 04:05:42,309
2 like 40.

3634
04:05:42,309 --> 04:05:49,920
240? 300 plus?

3635
04:05:49,920 --> 04:05:55,239
No, no way.

3636
04:05:55,239 --> 04:05:57,239
Now I have to play Hotline 2.

3637
04:05:57,239 --> 04:05:59,239
Okay, I'm gonna play Hotline 2, but

3638
04:05:59,239 --> 04:06:02,559
I wanna save Hotline 2.

3639
04:06:02,559 --> 04:06:11,270
It was 351?

3640
04:06:11,270 --> 04:06:13,270
Yeah, I expelled

3641
04:06:13,270 --> 04:06:15,270
all of my energy

3642
04:06:15,270 --> 04:06:17,270
playing through this game.

3643
04:06:17,270 --> 04:06:19,270
I could not jump right into that again.

3644
04:06:19,270 --> 04:06:21,270
Right now. I'm gonna have to wait a few days.

3645
04:06:21,270 --> 04:06:23,440
You're gonna shit yourself playing

3646
04:06:23,440 --> 04:06:32,530
Hotline Miami 2.

3647
04:06:32,530 --> 04:06:34,530
I've hit gamer fatigue.

3648
04:06:34,530 --> 04:06:44,819
Watch the trailer for 2.

3649
04:06:44,819 --> 04:06:46,819
Hotline Miami 2 ramps up the difficulty a lot.

3650
04:06:46,819 --> 04:06:50,079
Well, we'll give it a try.

3651
04:06:50,079 --> 04:06:52,079
If I lose my mind, I lose my mind.

3652
04:06:52,079 --> 04:06:57,969
That's all good.

3653
04:06:57,969 --> 04:07:03,159
That was a neat little game. Yeah, it is.

3654
04:07:03,159 --> 04:07:05,159
Thank you for playing. Yeah, that was

3655
04:07:05,159 --> 04:07:07,159
a lot of fun.

3656
04:07:07,159 --> 04:07:09,159
That was just a fun game. It was very hard.

3657
04:07:09,159 --> 04:07:11,159
Well, no, but

3658
04:07:11,159 --> 04:07:16,719
it was.

3659
04:07:16,719 --> 04:07:18,719
You just kind of had to learn where to go and what to do

3660
04:07:18,719 --> 04:07:20,719
Sometimes you don't have to do that. You can play however you want.

3661
04:07:20,719 --> 04:07:23,989
Hey, thank you for making this game.

3662
04:07:23,989 --> 04:07:26,159
We got a new mask. Phil.

3663
04:07:26,159 --> 04:07:28,979
Louis.

3664
04:07:28,979 --> 04:07:32,370
Let me just see. I'm curious.

3665
04:07:32,370 --> 04:07:34,370
Let's just open up a random chapter

3666
04:07:34,370 --> 04:07:36,370
because I wanna see what those masks are.

3667
04:07:36,370 --> 04:07:44,819
Just curious.

3668
04:07:44,819 --> 04:07:48,530
Let's see. Walk fast.

3669
04:07:48,530 --> 04:07:50,530
Look further. Survive a bullet.

3670
04:07:50,530 --> 04:07:52,959
Here we go. Alright.

3671
04:07:52,959 --> 04:07:54,959
Good. I thought that just said

3672
04:07:54,959 --> 04:07:58,040
good shit.

3673
04:07:58,040 --> 04:08:00,040
Walk faster. More melee weapons.

3674
04:08:00,040 --> 04:08:02,040
Nice spot. French

3675
04:08:02,040 --> 04:08:06,200
translation.

3676
04:08:06,200 --> 04:08:13,239
French translation.

3677
04:08:13,239 --> 04:08:15,239
I just got an achievement for dying like that. I don't understand.

3678
04:08:15,239 --> 04:08:23,170
French translation.

3679
04:08:23,170 --> 04:08:25,170
The game is just translating to French? How?

3680
04:08:25,170 --> 04:08:40,079
What? I missed.

3681
04:08:40,079 --> 04:08:46,360
Ah, fucking dog.

3682
04:08:46,360 --> 04:08:48,360
Do I have to throw it? R to restart.

3683
04:08:48,360 --> 04:08:58,209
It's not even in French.

3684
04:08:58,209 --> 04:09:00,209
I didn't want to let go of that. Why is it letting go?

3685
04:09:00,209 --> 04:09:02,520
I'm confused

3686
04:09:02,520 --> 04:09:04,520
right now. Am I breaking this thing

3687
04:09:04,520 --> 04:09:06,520
on people? I am.

3688
04:09:06,520 --> 04:09:08,520
Throw it. I get it. Okay.

3689
04:09:08,520 --> 04:09:14,850
It took me the whole game to figure that out.

3690
04:09:14,850 --> 04:09:16,850
I'm curious about this French translation though.

3691
04:09:16,850 --> 04:09:42,309
Beat one level with French.

3692
04:09:42,309 --> 04:09:45,319
Oh, fuck.

3693
04:09:45,319 --> 04:09:47,319
It only works on cutscenes.

3694
04:09:47,319 --> 04:09:54,020
Alright, well.

3695
04:09:54,020 --> 04:09:57,920
That was a fun game.

3696
04:09:57,920 --> 04:09:59,920
Play the bonus level.

3697
04:09:59,920 --> 04:10:02,799
Which one?

3698
04:10:02,799 --> 04:10:05,940
Bonus level. Chapter 14

3699
04:10:05,940 --> 04:10:07,940
18, 19. Bonus

3700
04:10:07,940 --> 04:10:12,020
chapter. Wait.

3701
04:10:12,020 --> 04:10:14,020
Special chapter. What the hell

3702
04:10:14,020 --> 04:10:16,020
is all this? Bonus chapter.

3703
04:10:16,020 --> 04:10:25,479
Does this game ever end?

3704
04:10:25,479 --> 04:10:32,770
I want to go with

3705
04:10:32,770 --> 04:10:47,360
hard to spot. Let's try hard to spot.

3706
04:10:47,360 --> 04:10:51,270
Holy fuck, he chased me all the way out there.

3707
04:10:51,270 --> 04:10:53,270
I need that French translation.

3708
04:10:53,270 --> 04:10:59,719
Oh my god.

3709
04:10:59,719 --> 04:11:06,629
Um, okay.

3710
04:11:06,629 --> 04:11:09,829
That's a little odd.

3711
04:11:09,829 --> 04:11:12,200
I can't shoot him out here.

3712
04:11:12,200 --> 04:11:47,190
Is that Minecraft Steve?

3713
04:11:47,190 --> 04:11:49,190
He's still alive. He's still alive.

3714
04:11:49,190 --> 04:11:54,879
I can't see that down.

3715
04:11:54,879 --> 04:11:59,430
Oh, shit!

3716
04:11:59,430 --> 04:12:02,180
My brain almost just

3717
04:12:02,180 --> 04:12:06,079
Now, I need

3718
04:12:06,079 --> 04:12:08,079
I need Jeffrey for this one.

3719
04:12:08,079 --> 04:12:15,379
Huge open room. I need to be able to see

3720
04:12:15,379 --> 04:12:25,559
everything. Window.

3721
04:12:25,559 --> 04:12:28,309
No, those aren't actual windows.

3722
04:12:28,309 --> 04:12:37,399
Dammit, they're behind a wall.

3723
04:12:37,399 --> 04:12:46,739
Alright, so we got a guy

3724
04:12:46,739 --> 04:12:50,260
down here. Really.

3725
04:12:50,260 --> 04:12:52,260
Why did he not shoot me the entire time

3726
04:12:52,260 --> 04:12:54,260
that I was doing that? What the fuck, man.

3727
04:12:54,260 --> 04:13:09,350
Really. Guns bug when

3728
04:13:09,350 --> 04:13:12,610
you're outside.

3729
04:13:12,610 --> 04:13:14,610
That's called a bunch of bologna.

3730
04:13:14,610 --> 04:13:17,559
That's a bunch of bologna.

3731
04:13:17,559 --> 04:13:19,559
That's, like, actually a fucking

3732
04:13:19,559 --> 04:13:34,790
bologna and cheese sandwich.

3733
04:13:34,790 --> 04:13:37,670
Is there anywhere else I can go?

3734
04:13:37,670 --> 04:13:46,559
I guess not, because I have to go that way.

3735
04:13:46,559 --> 04:13:49,959
And he gets to shoot me, but I can't shoot him.

3736
04:13:49,959 --> 04:13:55,840
Fuck off.

3737
04:13:55,840 --> 04:14:14,920
What? What?

3738
04:14:14,920 --> 04:14:24,000
Where did he even come from?

3739
04:14:24,000 --> 04:14:40,770
To find cover?

3740
04:14:40,770 --> 04:14:42,770
Oh my god. Why the hell does that exist?

3741
04:14:42,770 --> 04:14:44,770
Why can't Out of Bounds be back here?

3742
04:14:44,770 --> 04:14:56,610
Why does it have to be here?

3743
04:14:56,610 --> 04:14:58,610
Rush inside? That's not going to work.

3744
04:14:58,610 --> 04:15:00,610
He's over on every corner, here and down here.

3745
04:15:00,610 --> 04:15:04,069
These guys over here are going to shoot me.

3746
04:15:04,069 --> 04:15:16,469
How the hell? Are the tables covered

3747
04:15:16,469 --> 04:15:18,469
or am I going to get shot right in the face here in a second?

3748
04:15:18,469 --> 04:15:47,459
How am I going to get the other guy?

3749
04:15:47,459 --> 04:15:57,750
This?

3750
04:15:57,750 --> 04:16:09,270
From here? Rush him? No, I don't want to rush him.

3751
04:16:09,270 --> 04:16:12,719
This is covered.

3752
04:16:12,719 --> 04:16:15,920
Just waiting. Nobody comes out of their rooms

3753
04:16:15,920 --> 04:16:17,920
down here, do they? Is there anybody? There's probably some guy in the fucking bowling alley.

3754
04:16:17,920 --> 04:16:29,319
Holy shit!

3755
04:16:29,319 --> 04:16:34,819
There's a guy in the bowling alley!

3756
04:16:34,819 --> 04:16:38,850
Oh no. Oh boy.

3757
04:16:38,850 --> 04:16:40,850
I'm in trouble. Oh my god.

3758
04:16:40,850 --> 04:16:42,850
I'm dead. I'm dead. No I'm not. Get a bullet.

3759
04:16:42,850 --> 04:16:48,159
I picked up the one that didn't have any

3760
04:16:48,159 --> 04:16:50,159
fucking bullets!

3761
04:16:50,159 --> 04:16:52,159
Oh my god.

3762
04:16:52,159 --> 04:16:54,159
The fucking terrible luck.

3763
04:16:54,159 --> 04:16:56,159
The one gun that doesn't have a single bullet in it

3764
04:16:56,159 --> 04:16:58,159
is the one that I picked up. Are you

3765
04:16:58,159 --> 04:17:00,159
fucking serious? You've got to be

3766
04:17:00,159 --> 04:17:02,600
kidding me.

3767
04:17:02,600 --> 04:17:10,399
I'm so fucking annoyed by that.

3768
04:17:10,399 --> 04:17:12,399
There were like four guns on the ground

3769
04:17:12,399 --> 04:17:14,399
and the one that I picked up is the one that I let go.

3770
04:17:14,399 --> 04:17:16,840
Oh, I'm so annoyed.

3771
04:17:16,840 --> 04:17:23,559
I threw the rifle with bullets away?

3772
04:17:23,559 --> 04:17:25,559
I had to.

3773
04:17:25,559 --> 04:17:36,799
I was getting chased.

3774
04:17:36,799 --> 04:17:42,239
I need to keep this.

3775
04:17:42,239 --> 04:17:44,239
I can't see. Anything.

3776
04:17:44,239 --> 04:17:52,690
Where's the one where you just can't fucking die?

3777
04:17:52,690 --> 04:17:54,690
Holy shit. Give it to me.

3778
04:17:54,690 --> 04:18:13,250
Yeah, I'm pressing them very

3779
04:18:13,250 --> 04:18:17,090
hard.

3780
04:18:17,090 --> 04:18:24,319
Open room.

3781
04:18:24,319 --> 04:18:26,319
I'm about to destroy my entire office with a fucking

3782
04:18:26,319 --> 04:18:29,200
sledgehammer. And I'm not even going to put a

3783
04:18:29,200 --> 04:18:31,200
camera on too. So you won't even be able to capture it.

3784
04:18:31,200 --> 04:18:33,200
You'll just hear loud crashing noises.

3785
04:18:33,200 --> 04:18:47,969
Is there any gun down here?

3786
04:18:47,969 --> 04:18:57,889
I knocked him out, but that's not going to do anything

3787
04:18:57,889 --> 04:18:59,889
for me.

3788
04:18:59,889 --> 04:19:02,260
I need the knife.

3789
04:19:02,260 --> 04:19:05,200
Is he coming out?

3790
04:19:05,200 --> 04:19:16,850
He's coming out.

3791
04:19:16,850 --> 04:19:30,079
I'm so paranoid

3792
04:19:30,079 --> 04:19:32,079
about a guy just being right there. There's a guy right here

3793
04:19:32,079 --> 04:19:34,079
right there.

3794
04:19:34,079 --> 04:19:41,510
He's going to shoot me.

3795
04:19:41,510 --> 04:19:43,510
There's a bowling alley guy down here too.

3796
04:19:43,510 --> 04:19:55,090
There he is.

3797
04:19:55,090 --> 04:19:57,090
The only guy in here is this one.

3798
04:19:57,090 --> 04:19:59,090
What about across the fucking way? Yep, two guys with guns.

3799
04:19:59,090 --> 04:20:01,090
No windows here though.

3800
04:20:01,090 --> 04:20:03,270
Okay, go in this room.

3801
04:20:03,270 --> 04:20:05,270
Kill a guy on the toilet printer.

3802
04:20:05,270 --> 04:20:09,489
Why is he running over here?

3803
04:20:09,489 --> 04:20:12,559
Why are they all here?

3804
04:20:12,559 --> 04:20:24,340
Why are they all here?

3805
04:20:24,340 --> 04:20:30,340
Alright. Hey buddy. Oh.

3806
04:20:30,340 --> 04:20:32,899
Oh my goodness.

3807
04:20:32,899 --> 04:20:34,899
Okay, it's just this one guy here and that's it.

3808
04:20:34,899 --> 04:20:36,899
Oh fuck.

3809
04:20:36,899 --> 04:20:40,340
One round.

3810
04:20:40,340 --> 04:20:44,120
That's not going to cut it here, man.

3811
04:20:44,120 --> 04:20:46,120
There's still somebody alive down here, right?

3812
04:20:46,120 --> 04:20:48,360
No?

3813
04:20:48,360 --> 04:20:50,360
Is it one guy taking a piss and then I'm done?

3814
04:20:50,360 --> 04:21:09,620
Oh, do I have to kill these guys?

3815
04:21:09,620 --> 04:21:13,909
Nobody left, right?

3816
04:21:13,909 --> 04:21:15,909
There's nobody sitting down.

3817
04:21:15,909 --> 04:21:17,909
There's nobody hanging out over here, right?

3818
04:21:17,909 --> 04:21:19,909
It's just buying crap, Steve.

3819
04:21:19,909 --> 04:21:25,090
Thank God.

3820
04:21:25,090 --> 04:21:27,719
Oh, Dark Lord, grant us your eternal power.

3821
04:21:27,719 --> 04:21:30,399
Hey, Brandon.

3822
04:21:30,399 --> 04:21:32,399
Did you hear something just now?

3823
04:21:32,399 --> 04:21:34,959
Shut up, Willy.

3824
04:21:34,959 --> 04:21:40,659
Not while I'm chanting.

3825
04:21:40,659 --> 04:21:46,790
I can't get over there. That was fucking hard.

3826
04:21:46,790 --> 04:21:55,680
Can I not do anything about this?

3827
04:21:55,680 --> 04:21:58,309
No, I can't get in there.

3828
04:21:58,309 --> 04:22:05,139
Alright, bye.

3829
04:22:05,139 --> 04:22:07,139
Is there another door on the other side of the bar?

3830
04:22:07,139 --> 04:22:12,709
No. What am I going to go do?

3831
04:22:12,709 --> 04:22:19,299
Put her back together?

3832
04:22:19,299 --> 04:22:22,180
That's fucked up.

3833
04:22:22,180 --> 04:22:33,889
I've got to go there and tell them it's not okay.

3834
04:22:33,889 --> 04:22:35,889
I don't think that's going to work.

3835
04:22:35,889 --> 04:22:41,649
C plus streamer.

3836
04:22:41,649 --> 04:22:45,879
And a dart has been unlocked.

3837
04:22:45,879 --> 04:22:49,969
There was one more.

3838
04:22:49,969 --> 04:22:52,340
Let's take a look.

3839
04:22:52,340 --> 04:22:54,340
So we just go backwards.

3840
04:22:54,340 --> 04:22:56,340
So this is a bonus chapter,

3841
04:22:56,340 --> 04:22:58,340
highball, and then special chapter called

3842
04:22:58,340 --> 04:23:04,290
Exposed.

3843
04:23:04,290 --> 04:23:11,649
Let's go with

3844
04:23:11,649 --> 04:23:16,709
extra ammo.

3845
04:23:16,709 --> 04:23:21,510
Speaking of exposed, I understand why

3846
04:23:21,510 --> 04:23:23,510
the level is called Exposed.

3847
04:23:23,510 --> 04:23:35,540
Ah, shit.

3848
04:23:35,540 --> 04:23:59,159
Two guys in this...oh my God.

3849
04:23:59,159 --> 04:24:01,159
More than one guy.

3850
04:24:01,159 --> 04:24:05,440
Oh my God.

3851
04:24:05,440 --> 04:24:07,440
My asshole.

3852
04:24:07,440 --> 04:24:09,440
I'm serious.

3853
04:24:09,440 --> 04:24:11,440
I don't mean to be gross here, but holy shit.

3854
04:24:11,440 --> 04:24:22,370
What did I just pick up?

3855
04:24:22,370 --> 04:24:35,170
Can I play the slot machines?

3856
04:24:35,170 --> 04:24:38,879
No, they can't. Okay.

3857
04:24:38,879 --> 04:24:41,760
But he's going to run over here.

3858
04:24:41,760 --> 04:24:43,760
Is he going to shoot through this? He might.

3859
04:24:43,760 --> 04:24:49,590
What about up here?

3860
04:24:49,590 --> 04:24:51,590
Take the slow. I'm already doing well.

3861
04:24:51,590 --> 04:24:53,590
I don't need to freak out about this. Anybody up to the top left?

3862
04:24:53,590 --> 04:25:04,790
Doesn't look like it.

3863
04:25:04,790 --> 04:25:06,790
Nobody else. Alright.

3864
04:25:06,790 --> 04:25:15,620
Just a few more guys over there.

3865
04:25:15,620 --> 04:25:17,620
I'll take the other gun because it has more rounds in it.

3866
04:25:17,620 --> 04:25:25,299
Okay, don't try to cheese it.

3867
04:25:25,299 --> 04:25:31,569
Just do it right. Three guys left.

3868
04:25:31,569 --> 04:25:38,229
One guy at the back. Let's go for this guy first.

3869
04:25:38,229 --> 04:25:40,229
He's going to be quick. One, two, three.

3870
04:25:40,229 --> 04:25:46,040
That's it. Okay.

3871
04:25:46,040 --> 04:25:50,319
That actually was fairly easy.

3872
04:25:50,319 --> 04:26:01,569
That really wasn't that bad at all.

3873
04:26:01,569 --> 04:26:03,569
Why is it called Special Mission?

3874
04:26:03,569 --> 04:26:09,520
I didn't get very many style points.

3875
04:26:09,520 --> 04:26:14,069
Get it with a full combo.

3876
04:26:14,069 --> 04:26:16,069
I'm sure there are people that play this game.

3877
04:26:16,069 --> 04:26:20,069
That can do the wild, wild shit.

3878
04:26:20,069 --> 04:26:28,319
Alright, that's cool.

3879
04:26:28,319 --> 04:26:31,909
Is there anything else that I missed?

3880
04:26:31,909 --> 04:26:33,909
Is that special chapter? That's bonus chapter.

3881
04:26:33,909 --> 04:26:36,340
World record is 15 minutes for the whole game.

3882
04:26:36,340 --> 04:26:42,799
This one was good.

3883
04:26:42,799 --> 04:26:44,799
I almost lost my mind.

3884
04:26:44,799 --> 04:26:47,239
This one not so much though.

3885
04:26:47,239 --> 04:26:49,239
I guess for comboing and trying to find interesting rounds.

3886
04:26:49,239 --> 04:26:51,239
Probably.

3887
04:26:51,239 --> 04:27:01,670
Stream ending voice.

3888
04:27:01,670 --> 04:27:03,909
Well, pretty much.

3889
04:27:03,909 --> 04:27:05,909
But let me explain.

3890
04:27:05,909 --> 04:27:11,360
Let me explain the deal here.

3891
04:27:11,360 --> 04:27:13,540
EDF was supposed to be tonight.

3892
04:27:13,540 --> 04:27:15,540
But if you came in a little later.

3893
04:27:15,540 --> 04:27:17,540
I had to postpone it until tomorrow.

3894
04:27:17,540 --> 04:27:19,540
Because we wanted to get...

3895
04:27:19,540 --> 04:27:21,540
Star wanted to get ready.

3896
04:27:21,540 --> 04:27:23,540
He didn't really have all of his shit set up.

3897
04:27:23,540 --> 04:27:25,540
He needed to set up his Playstation 4 and capture stuff.

3898
04:27:25,540 --> 04:27:27,540
And he wasn't really ready to do it.

3899
04:27:27,540 --> 04:27:29,540
So we just said, alright, we'll just do it tomorrow.

3900
04:27:29,540 --> 04:27:33,540
So today is just kind of an extra stream.

3901
04:27:33,540 --> 04:27:35,540
While we wait until tomorrow.

3902
04:27:35,540 --> 04:27:39,510
So, EDF tomorrow with Star on italics.

3903
04:27:39,510 --> 04:27:48,719
Oh, you're throwing Star under the bus.

3904
04:27:48,719 --> 04:27:51,280
No, I mean...

3905
04:27:51,280 --> 04:27:53,280
I could have just played it today.

3906
04:27:53,280 --> 04:27:55,280
I could have just played EDF today.

3907
04:27:55,280 --> 04:27:59,459
But I would rather play with people that want to play.

3908
04:27:59,459 --> 04:28:01,459
You know what I mean?

3909
04:28:01,459 --> 04:28:03,459
If there's a multiplayer opportunity there.

3910
04:28:03,459 --> 04:28:05,459
Look, Star and I played the game last time.

3911
04:28:05,459 --> 04:28:07,459
EDF 4.

3912
04:28:07,459 --> 04:28:09,459
So if he wants to do it and we want to do it.

3913
04:28:09,459 --> 04:28:11,459
And we think it would be fun.

3914
04:28:11,459 --> 04:28:13,459
We're going to do it.

3915
04:28:13,459 --> 04:28:15,459
And that's what we're going to do tomorrow.

3916
04:28:15,459 --> 04:28:24,549
He just wasn't ready today.

3917
04:28:24,549 --> 04:28:26,549
But for the purposes of tonight.

3918
04:28:26,549 --> 04:28:32,290
I think I'll just call it there.

3919
04:28:32,290 --> 04:28:34,290
That was a lot of fun.

3920
04:28:34,290 --> 04:28:37,489
I will definitely be playing Hotline Miami 2.

3921
04:28:37,489 --> 04:28:39,489
Just not immediately.

3922
04:28:39,489 --> 04:28:44,100
Rat movies at a million views.

3923
04:28:44,100 --> 04:28:50,629
Alright, we'll watch it before I leave.

3924
04:28:50,629 --> 04:28:52,629
Thanks for joining me if you're taking off.

3925
04:28:52,629 --> 04:28:54,629
Let's see you tomorrow.

3926
04:28:54,629 --> 04:28:56,629
Probably around the same time.

3927
04:28:56,629 --> 04:28:58,629
Around like 3 to 3.30 Pacific.

3928
04:28:58,629 --> 04:29:01,569
EDF 5.

3929
04:29:01,569 --> 04:29:03,569
I'm not sure how good it's going to be.

3930
04:29:03,569 --> 04:29:06,959
But the last one was a blast.

3931
04:29:06,959 --> 04:29:08,959
And as long as you take it for what it is.

3932
04:29:08,959 --> 04:29:11,139
You can have a lot of fun in EDF.

3933
04:29:11,139 --> 04:29:14,280
So, see you tomorrow for EDF.

3934
04:29:14,280 --> 04:29:20,420
Let's call it there.

3935
04:29:20,420 --> 04:29:23,620
I'm going to get that.

3936
04:29:23,620 --> 04:29:27,780
Okey dokey.

3937
04:29:27,780 --> 04:29:30,790
So let's head over to the bits.

3938
04:29:30,790 --> 04:29:32,790
From a few four and a half hours ago or so.

3939
04:29:32,790 --> 04:29:38,930
Yeah, hope you join us tomorrow.

3940
04:29:38,930 --> 04:29:41,559
And then after tomorrow.

3941
04:29:41,559 --> 04:29:44,309
Let me take a look at the camera.

3942
04:29:44,309 --> 04:29:48,309
Because today is kind of pushed a couple things forward.

3943
04:29:48,309 --> 04:29:54,309
So the Birdhouse stream was going to be on Friday.

3944
04:29:54,309 --> 04:29:56,309
But because I'm streaming tomorrow.

3945
04:29:56,309 --> 04:29:58,479
So that'll be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

3946
04:29:58,479 --> 04:30:00,479
So I'm going to take Thursday and Friday.

3947
04:30:00,479 --> 04:30:02,479
So I'm going to take Thursday and Friday off.

3948
04:30:02,479 --> 04:30:07,040
And then the Birdhouse stream will be on Saturday.

3949
04:30:07,040 --> 04:30:12,870
Birdhouse in the winter.

3950
04:30:12,870 --> 04:30:14,870
I need to make a birdhouse.

3951
04:30:14,870 --> 04:30:22,950
We'll watch Rat Movie at the end.

3952
04:30:22,950 --> 04:30:26,719
That'll be the sign off for the night.

3953
04:30:26,719 --> 04:30:31,459
Are there even any birds in Vegas?

3954
04:30:31,459 --> 04:30:34,280
I'm just realizing this right now.

3955
04:30:34,280 --> 04:30:40,159
Are there birds here?

3956
04:30:40,159 --> 04:30:47,909
There might not be any birds here.

3957
04:30:47,909 --> 04:30:50,850
Have you ever really seen a bird?

3958
04:30:50,850 --> 04:30:55,399
Yes, many times.

3959
04:30:55,399 --> 04:30:57,399
What the fuck German lives in Vegas now?

3960
04:30:57,399 --> 04:30:59,639
Yes.

3961
04:30:59,639 --> 04:31:03,639
I moved a few months ago from Massachusetts to Las Vegas.

3962
04:31:03,639 --> 04:31:08,370
Turkeys.

3963
04:31:08,370 --> 04:31:10,370
No, there are no turkeys in Las Vegas.

3964
04:31:10,370 --> 04:31:13,639
I can assure you that.

3965
04:31:13,639 --> 04:31:16,389
I haven't seen one.

3966
04:31:16,389 --> 04:31:19,319
It was last month?

3967
04:31:19,319 --> 04:31:21,620
I got here in October.

3968
04:31:21,620 --> 04:31:29,670
The wind took me around a bunch.

3969
04:31:29,670 --> 04:31:37,860
When did we land?

3970
04:31:37,860 --> 04:31:41,440
At some point.

3971
04:31:41,440 --> 04:31:48,559
It'll be about three months when we get to the first or second week in January.

3972
04:31:48,559 --> 04:31:50,559
How long are you going to keep up the balloon charade?

3973
04:31:50,559 --> 04:31:54,790
I broadcasted it, so it's real.

3974
04:31:54,790 --> 04:31:56,790
It's real.

3975
04:31:56,790 --> 04:32:04,079
I did it.

3976
04:32:04,079 --> 04:32:06,389
Anyways, thank you to GamingHash for the 250.

3977
04:32:06,389 --> 04:32:08,760
They say nice. Hey, nice.

3978
04:32:08,760 --> 04:32:10,760
Sticks Renegade, thanks for the dollar.

3979
04:32:10,760 --> 04:32:14,760
So I was getting a snack in the vending machine and I was about to pay via Apple Pay.

3980
04:32:14,760 --> 04:32:16,760
I dropped my phone and tried to catch it.

3981
04:32:16,760 --> 04:32:18,760
I involuntarily stuck my foot out.

3982
04:32:18,760 --> 04:32:22,209
I kicked the screen and broke it.

3983
04:32:22,209 --> 04:32:24,389
It doesn't sound like a good thing.

3984
04:32:24,389 --> 04:32:32,149
I hope it wasn't a nice phone because that's a pain in the ass to repair.

3985
04:32:32,149 --> 04:32:34,149
I'm sorry to hear that, Sticks.

3986
04:32:34,149 --> 04:32:36,840
Extra Cheesy, thanks for the one dollar.

3987
04:32:36,840 --> 04:32:40,840
Hey Jerm, I'm sorry for the low brow, edgy, crab-related constellation joke I made yesterday.

3988
04:32:40,840 --> 04:32:42,840
Please don't annihilate me.

3989
04:32:42,840 --> 04:32:47,059
I can do better, I swear.

3990
04:32:47,059 --> 04:32:49,059
Low brow.

3991
04:32:49,059 --> 04:32:52,579
This is a high brow stream.

3992
04:32:52,579 --> 04:32:58,579
Although I did just say something about my asshole like 13, 14 minutes ago.

3993
04:32:58,579 --> 04:33:12,869
But yeah, let's put Jot Hotline Miami 2 down for next week.

3994
04:33:12,869 --> 04:33:17,090
Because that actually was a lot of fun.

3995
04:33:17,090 --> 04:33:19,090
I'm actually into that.

3996
04:33:19,090 --> 04:33:23,889
I'm into it right now.

3997
04:33:23,889 --> 04:33:25,889
But thank you Extra Cheesy and don't worry about it, sorry.

3998
04:33:25,889 --> 04:33:27,889
Thank you Divus for the three bucks.

3999
04:33:27,889 --> 04:33:30,319
Every stream, Divus.

4000
04:33:30,319 --> 04:33:31,319
Every stream.

4001
04:33:31,319 --> 04:33:33,319
That's going to add up after a while.

4002
04:33:33,319 --> 04:33:37,869
But thank you so much.

4003
04:33:37,869 --> 04:33:39,869
Peaceful Haley, thanks for the one dollar.

4004
04:33:40,869 --> 04:33:42,869
And unfortunately can't go to Vegas.

4005
04:33:42,869 --> 04:33:44,869
But that's okay.

4006
04:33:44,869 --> 04:33:48,869
I've been trying to pursue my passion with streaming on Twitch and I think I'm doing okay.

4007
04:33:48,869 --> 04:33:50,869
Hopefully I can make this a career someday.

4008
04:33:50,869 --> 04:33:54,049
Love you Jerm.

4009
04:33:54,049 --> 04:33:56,680
I wish you the best of luck.

4010
04:33:56,680 --> 04:33:58,680
It's a tough world out here.

4011
04:33:58,680 --> 04:34:00,680
In Twitch.

4012
04:34:00,680 --> 04:34:04,770
Very competitive atmosphere.

4013
04:34:04,770 --> 04:34:12,709
Especially nowadays.

4014
04:34:12,709 --> 04:34:14,709
I get asked for advice on streaming.

4015
04:34:14,709 --> 04:34:18,590
It's hard to give advice.

4016
04:34:18,590 --> 04:34:22,400
And hard to kind of say, hey this is how you should do it.

4017
04:34:22,400 --> 04:34:24,400
Because I don't really have an answer.

4018
04:34:24,400 --> 04:34:31,380
Here's my advice, good luck.

4019
04:34:31,380 --> 04:34:34,130
That's not what I mean.

4020
04:34:34,130 --> 04:34:37,080
What I mean is everybody does it differently.

4021
04:34:37,080 --> 04:34:40,380
And it's hard to replicate somebody else's.

4022
04:34:40,380 --> 04:34:45,380
What somebody else did is not necessarily a recipe for success.

4023
04:34:45,380 --> 04:34:49,709
I know a lot of people compare themselves to other people.

4024
04:34:49,709 --> 04:34:51,709
And it's hard not to but you can't.

4025
04:34:51,709 --> 04:34:53,950
You just got to do you.

4026
04:34:53,950 --> 04:34:56,950
And hope that you can maybe gain some viewers.

4027
04:34:56,950 --> 04:34:58,950
And if you do, you do.

4028
04:34:58,950 --> 04:35:08,270
I wish anybody the utmost luck.

4029
04:35:08,270 --> 04:35:11,270
When they try to get into a passion or try to get into content creation.

4030
04:35:11,270 --> 04:35:24,810
Are you saying that this person is trying to steal your shtick?

4031
04:35:24,810 --> 04:35:28,810
No, no, I'm just in a general sense.

4032
04:35:28,810 --> 04:35:32,819
A lot of times you compare yourselves to other people.

4033
04:35:32,819 --> 04:35:34,819
And you, oh how'd they do that?

4034
04:35:34,819 --> 04:35:39,110
How did they do those things?

4035
04:35:39,110 --> 04:35:41,110
Steal your shtick.

4036
04:35:41,110 --> 04:35:49,580
No.

4037
04:35:49,580 --> 04:35:50,580
When am I gonna get a vibe?

4038
04:35:50,580 --> 04:35:55,189
Probably like a few years.

4039
04:35:55,189 --> 04:35:57,430
But no, good luck.

4040
04:35:57,430 --> 04:36:01,909
I don't know what games you play or what you do on your streams.

4041
04:36:01,909 --> 04:36:02,909
But hopefully you have fun doing it.

4042
04:36:02,909 --> 04:36:04,909
Because that's important as well.

4043
04:36:04,909 --> 04:36:11,409
You have to make sure the first thing that's on that list is.

4044
04:36:11,409 --> 04:36:14,409
Are you enjoying what you're doing?

4045
04:36:14,409 --> 04:36:18,650
The whole career aspect happens after that.

4046
04:36:18,650 --> 04:36:19,650
You know?

4047
04:36:19,650 --> 04:36:22,150
I think a lot of times people get into content creation.

4048
04:36:22,150 --> 04:36:25,150
They're like, alright, I can't wait to do this for a job.

4049
04:36:25,150 --> 04:36:26,709
But you have to be realistic.

4050
04:36:26,709 --> 04:36:27,709
You know?

4051
04:36:27,709 --> 04:36:34,669
It should go the other way around.

4052
04:36:34,669 --> 04:36:37,669
As long as you keep an open mind and you don't.

4053
04:36:37,669 --> 04:36:40,479
Because when I first started my YouTube channel.

4054
04:36:40,479 --> 04:36:45,240
It was based on, I just kind of do this and I want to do this.

4055
04:36:45,240 --> 04:36:49,740
It wasn't about like a career or choosing a career.

4056
04:36:49,740 --> 04:36:51,740
It just kind of happened.

4057
04:36:51,740 --> 04:37:04,479
Just make sure that you are doing what you want to do.

4058
04:37:04,479 --> 04:37:07,150
And you're having fun doing it.

4059
04:37:07,150 --> 04:37:09,150
And try to set realistic goals for yourself.

4060
04:37:09,150 --> 04:37:13,840
Even if that means on a week by week basis or a month by month basis.

4061
04:37:13,840 --> 04:37:25,180
Hopefully you could maybe take something from that.

4062
04:37:25,180 --> 04:37:26,180
I'm not an expert.

4063
04:37:26,180 --> 04:37:27,180
I really don't claim to be.

4064
04:37:27,180 --> 04:37:28,180
I'm not an expert on.

4065
04:37:28,180 --> 04:37:30,180
Here's how you market yourself.

4066
04:37:30,180 --> 04:37:31,180
And here's how you do this.

4067
04:37:31,180 --> 04:37:33,180
No, I don't fucking know.

4068
04:37:33,180 --> 04:37:35,869
You know what I mean?

4069
04:37:35,869 --> 04:37:44,750
What's the point of slow mode?

4070
04:37:44,750 --> 04:37:50,189
Make it so the chat goes slower.

4071
04:37:50,189 --> 04:37:52,189
But with that being said.

4072
04:37:52,189 --> 04:37:53,189
We will move on.

4073
04:37:53,189 --> 04:37:54,189
Good luck. Peaceful lately.

4074
04:37:54,189 --> 04:37:57,349
Thank you for the $1.

4075
04:37:57,349 --> 04:38:00,909
Thank you, Lakranda, for the $5.

4076
04:38:00,909 --> 04:38:02,909
Jerma, I have been listening to you since middle school.

4077
04:38:02,909 --> 04:38:04,909
It's been a long six years.

4078
04:38:04,909 --> 04:38:07,909
And I can't thank you enough on how much your streams and videos have impacted me.

4079
04:38:07,909 --> 04:38:12,409
Much love.

4080
04:38:12,409 --> 04:38:13,409
Thanks.

4081
04:38:13,409 --> 04:38:14,409
Thank you, Lakranda.

4082
04:38:14,409 --> 04:38:24,669
It's a shock on a daily basis when I hear people say things like that.

4083
04:38:24,669 --> 04:38:27,669
I'm incredibly happy that you can take anything from this stream.

4084
04:38:27,669 --> 04:38:29,669
Or from the videos that I've ever made.

4085
04:38:29,669 --> 04:38:30,669
So thank you.

4086
04:38:30,669 --> 04:38:36,939
Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.

4087
04:38:36,939 --> 04:38:37,939
Jerma, quick.

4088
04:38:37,939 --> 04:38:38,939
Duck.

4089
04:38:38,939 --> 04:38:41,380
Duck before it's too late.

4090
04:38:41,380 --> 04:38:42,380
Duck?

4091
04:38:42,380 --> 04:38:43,380
Like in the game?

4092
04:38:43,380 --> 04:38:45,319
What are you talking about?

4093
04:38:45,319 --> 04:38:46,319
Duck.

4094
04:38:46,319 --> 04:38:48,009
Right?

4095
04:38:48,009 --> 04:38:50,009
You can't duck in Hotline Miami.

4096
04:38:50,009 --> 04:38:56,909
Wholesome content.

4097
04:38:56,909 --> 04:39:04,590
He has headphones on.

4098
04:39:04,590 --> 04:39:07,759
I don't even have my headphones in right now.

4099
04:39:07,759 --> 04:39:13,880
But thank you, Dr. Clay, for the warning four hours ago.

4100
04:39:13,880 --> 04:39:16,319
I didn't duck four hours ago.

4101
04:39:16,319 --> 04:39:18,990
And I don't know.

4102
04:39:18,990 --> 04:39:22,060
Was this a streamer that mentioned his ass?

4103
04:39:22,060 --> 04:39:23,810
Yes it is.

4104
04:39:23,810 --> 04:39:24,810
Wholesome in quotes.

4105
04:39:24,810 --> 04:39:27,560
I don't live by labels, man.

4106
04:39:27,560 --> 04:39:28,560
You know what I mean?

4107
04:39:28,560 --> 04:39:29,560
I just do meat.

4108
04:39:29,560 --> 04:39:31,119
Yeah.

4109
04:39:31,119 --> 04:39:32,119
Labels.

4110
04:39:32,119 --> 04:39:34,490
Get rid of them.

4111
04:39:34,490 --> 04:39:39,700
Yeah.

4112
04:39:39,700 --> 04:39:40,700
Yeah.

4113
04:39:40,700 --> 04:39:41,700
Yeah.

4114
04:39:41,700 --> 04:39:42,880
That's too much coffee.

4115
04:39:42,880 --> 04:39:43,880
I'm not drinking anymore.

4116
04:39:43,880 --> 04:39:46,560
Why am I drinking coffee at 9 o'clock at night?

4117
04:39:46,560 --> 04:39:49,189
What am I, my fucking mother?

4118
04:39:49,189 --> 04:39:51,189
My mother drinks like three coffees a day.

4119
04:39:51,189 --> 04:39:54,189
And she'll sip on one at like 11 o'clock at night to go to bed.

4120
04:39:54,189 --> 04:39:55,189
I'm turning into my mother.

4121
04:39:55,189 --> 04:40:02,549
Anyways, thank you, Dr. Clay.

4122
04:40:02,549 --> 04:40:04,549
Thank you, ExtraCheesy, for the $1 watching.

4123
04:40:04,549 --> 04:40:06,549
You formulate possible strategies and play this game.

4124
04:40:06,549 --> 04:40:10,549
It's sort of like if there was a model of Terminator

4125
04:40:10,549 --> 04:40:14,549
whose processor was an old Texas Instruments grade school calculator.

4126
04:40:14,549 --> 04:40:16,549
Thank you, ExtraCheesy, but I beat it.

4127
04:40:16,549 --> 04:40:19,549
And it only took about four hours and 10 minutes to beat it.

4128
04:40:19,549 --> 04:40:20,549
So come on.

4129
04:40:20,549 --> 04:40:23,549
I only died like 265 times.

4130
04:40:23,549 --> 04:40:25,549
That's pretty good.

4131
04:40:25,549 --> 04:40:26,549
I got Bs and Cs.

4132
04:40:26,549 --> 04:40:30,549
At the very beginning of the stream, we made sure to talk about Bs and Cs are okay.

4133
04:40:30,549 --> 04:40:31,549
I didn't get any Fs.

4134
04:40:31,549 --> 04:40:32,549
I didn't get any Ds.

4135
04:40:32,549 --> 04:40:38,520
But thank you, ExtraCheesy.

4136
04:40:38,520 --> 04:40:39,520
Thank you, Swiggity Swanky, for the $1.

4137
04:40:39,520 --> 04:40:43,520
What if I happen to wanting to play a relaxing game before EDF tomorrow?

4138
04:40:43,520 --> 04:40:45,520
This game will take a year off of your life.

4139
04:40:45,520 --> 04:40:46,520
It absolutely did.

4140
04:40:46,520 --> 04:40:47,830
But I think it was worth it.

4141
04:40:47,830 --> 04:40:49,959
It was fun.

4142
04:40:49,959 --> 04:40:52,959
ChubbiestThread, thanks for the $20.

4143
04:40:52,959 --> 04:40:55,330
They just say fail fish, fail fish.

4144
04:40:55,330 --> 04:41:00,689
Fail fish, fail fish.

4145
04:41:00,689 --> 04:41:04,689
I must have done something worth facepalming for.

4146
04:41:04,689 --> 04:41:06,689
But thank you for the $20.

4147
04:41:06,689 --> 04:41:09,150
Really appreciate that.

4148
04:41:09,150 --> 04:41:10,150
Thank you so much.

4149
04:41:10,150 --> 04:41:13,029
PeanutChan, $50.

4150
04:41:13,029 --> 04:41:14,200
Big money from PeanutChan.

4151
04:41:14,200 --> 04:41:16,200
Thank you again if you're still here.

4152
04:41:16,200 --> 04:41:19,080
Flanktank gave $5.

4153
04:41:19,080 --> 04:41:21,080
So I was watching this random vid from my YouTube homepage

4154
04:41:21,080 --> 04:41:22,080
and I had to double take it.

4155
04:41:22,080 --> 04:41:23,080
You are now famous.

4156
04:41:23,080 --> 04:41:24,080
What are you talking about?

4157
04:41:24,080 --> 04:41:40,770
Let's turn this down for a second.

4158
04:41:40,770 --> 04:41:43,270
I've got to get out of this.

4159
04:41:43,270 --> 04:41:46,279
You were on Ellen.

4160
04:41:46,279 --> 04:41:47,520
Can you imagine if I was?

4161
04:41:47,520 --> 04:41:49,009
Imagine if she was like,

4162
04:41:49,009 --> 04:41:52,009
okay, so let's take a look at this weird guy.

4163
04:41:52,009 --> 04:41:53,009
He's kind of a weirdo.

4164
04:41:53,009 --> 04:41:54,009
Here he is on the screen there.

4165
04:41:54,009 --> 04:41:56,009
And he just gets up and starts dancing.

4166
04:41:56,009 --> 04:41:58,009
And it's me doing the Fortnite dance.

4167
04:41:58,009 --> 04:42:01,849
So next up on the program,

4168
04:42:01,849 --> 04:42:03,849
kind of a weirdo, he's a weirdo.

4169
04:42:03,849 --> 04:42:04,849
Here he is.

4170
04:42:04,849 --> 04:42:05,849
I like him though.

4171
04:42:05,849 --> 04:42:06,849
He's a really nice guy.

4172
04:42:06,849 --> 04:42:07,849
But there he is.

4173
04:42:07,849 --> 04:42:11,849
Jerma985.

4174
04:42:11,849 --> 04:42:20,939
Odyssey DLC after a year.

4175
04:42:20,939 --> 04:42:21,939
And you know what happens?

4176
04:42:21,939 --> 04:42:23,939
Someone goes, fuck you.

4177
04:42:23,939 --> 04:42:25,939
I'm making my own kingdoms then.

4178
04:42:25,939 --> 04:42:27,939
And I'm making Bob-omb battlefield too.

4179
04:42:27,939 --> 04:42:28,939
For good measure.

4180
04:42:28,939 --> 04:42:30,939
And because Nintendo cracks down so hard on games,

4181
04:42:30,939 --> 04:42:32,939
the only way you can really access this kind of stuff

4182
04:42:32,939 --> 04:42:34,939
is through homebrew.

4183
04:42:34,939 --> 04:42:36,939
Only to Iranians.

4184
04:42:36,939 --> 04:42:38,939
Sanctioned only to Iranians.

4185
04:42:38,939 --> 04:42:39,939
Why am I being linked?

4186
04:42:39,939 --> 04:42:41,939
What did he say?

4187
04:42:41,939 --> 04:42:43,939
Nintendo wants everything that's made

4188
04:42:43,939 --> 04:42:45,939
to be sanctioned under their own approval.

4189
04:42:45,939 --> 04:42:47,939
But then they don't give people what they want.

4190
04:42:47,939 --> 04:42:48,939
For example.

4191
04:42:48,939 --> 04:42:50,939
Oh, I walk by on the green screen.

4192
04:42:50,939 --> 04:42:52,939
What the fuck?

4193
04:42:52,939 --> 04:42:59,880
I just walk by on the green screen.

4194
04:42:59,880 --> 04:43:03,209
What?

4195
04:43:03,209 --> 04:43:04,209
Why?

4196
04:43:04,209 --> 04:43:05,209
What the fuck?

4197
04:43:05,209 --> 04:43:06,209
That's fucking funny.

4198
04:43:06,209 --> 04:43:09,819
I didn't even pick up on it.

4199
04:43:09,819 --> 04:43:17,880
I didn't even see it.

4200
04:43:17,880 --> 04:43:21,520
That's wild.

4201
04:43:21,520 --> 04:43:24,520
Funky Mouse also made a green screen video.

4202
04:43:24,520 --> 04:43:28,290
And it was fucking wild.

4203
04:43:28,290 --> 04:43:37,099
But anyways, thank you Flank Tank.

4204
04:43:37,099 --> 04:43:39,400
Flank Tank for the $1.

4205
04:43:39,400 --> 04:43:40,400
Kraft tank thanks for the $1.

4206
04:43:40,400 --> 04:43:41,400
They say hello, hello.

4207
04:43:41,400 --> 04:43:43,959
Flank Tank again for the $1.

4208
04:43:43,959 --> 04:43:45,959
Nightbot deleted my bit message because I had a link.

4209
04:43:45,959 --> 04:43:46,959
And I was not a sub.

4210
04:43:46,959 --> 04:43:47,959
So I had to sub.

4211
04:43:47,959 --> 04:43:49,959
And there it is again.

4212
04:43:49,959 --> 04:43:50,959
Jesus.

4213
04:43:50,959 --> 04:43:55,909
Well, thank you Flank Tank for your $12 here.

4214
04:43:55,909 --> 04:43:58,400
$11.

4215
04:43:58,400 --> 04:44:01,560
For sharing the link.

4216
04:44:01,560 --> 04:44:02,560
Thank you.

4217
04:44:02,560 --> 04:44:09,599
That was interesting.

4218
04:44:09,599 --> 04:44:13,150
Somebody wrote, I was looking at the Reddit

4219
04:44:13,150 --> 04:44:16,150
maybe like a few weeks ago or two weeks ago or something.

4220
04:44:16,150 --> 04:44:20,150
And somebody wrote, I don't think he realizes just how like

4221
04:44:20,150 --> 04:44:23,150
how he's going to appear all over the place now.

4222
04:44:23,150 --> 04:44:26,560
Like even people that don't even.

4223
04:44:26,560 --> 04:44:27,560
And I thought about this too.

4224
04:44:27,560 --> 04:44:29,560
It's like even people that don't even know this channel

4225
04:44:29,560 --> 04:44:30,560
or watch this channel.

4226
04:44:30,560 --> 04:44:34,869
Somewhere on some page or some website.

4227
04:44:34,869 --> 04:44:36,869
Just oh free green screen footage.

4228
04:44:36,869 --> 04:44:38,869
I'm just going to appear in random fucked up shit.

4229
04:44:38,869 --> 04:44:40,869
Random crazy shit.

4230
04:44:40,869 --> 04:44:41,869
Random videos.

4231
04:44:41,869 --> 04:44:43,869
I have no control over it.

4232
04:44:43,869 --> 04:44:46,069
I have no idea.

4233
04:44:46,069 --> 04:44:48,069
It's like seven years from now.

4234
04:44:48,069 --> 04:44:53,330
I'm going to be fucking Chad walking on somebody's random video.

4235
04:44:53,330 --> 04:44:59,729
20 years are going to go by.

4236
04:44:59,729 --> 04:45:00,729
My hair is going to be white.

4237
04:45:00,729 --> 04:45:06,130
And I'm going to be doing like the Disney Channel opening

4238
04:45:06,130 --> 04:45:10,630
for some new like up and coming YouTuber in like 25 years.

4239
04:45:10,630 --> 04:45:16,799
What hair?

4240
04:45:16,799 --> 04:45:17,799
It's going to be nice.

4241
04:45:17,799 --> 04:45:18,799
It's going to be white.

4242
04:45:18,799 --> 04:45:23,439
It's going to be slicked back with grease.

4243
04:45:23,439 --> 04:45:26,880
I'm going to get just like I'm going to get like oil like olive oil.

4244
04:45:26,880 --> 04:45:28,880
I'll just slick it back.

4245
04:45:28,880 --> 04:45:29,880
Bright white.

4246
04:45:29,880 --> 04:45:39,200
But thank you.

4247
04:45:39,200 --> 04:45:41,200
Thank you to Dark Star 700,000 Games.

4248
04:45:41,200 --> 04:45:42,200
Thanks for the $1.

4249
04:45:42,200 --> 04:45:44,200
I have a Python practical exam tomorrow.

4250
04:45:44,200 --> 04:45:46,200
And I'm afraid all the programming knowledge

4251
04:45:46,200 --> 04:45:48,200
I've accumulated throughout the semester

4252
04:45:48,200 --> 04:45:50,200
will leave my head the moment I walk in the classroom.

4253
04:45:50,200 --> 04:45:51,200
Wish me luck.

4254
04:45:51,200 --> 04:45:54,080
No, you think that but you'll be fine.

4255
04:45:54,080 --> 04:45:57,880
You'll wake up tomorrow after being like oh shit.

4256
04:45:57,880 --> 04:45:58,880
You'll sit down.

4257
04:45:58,880 --> 04:45:59,880
The paper will be in front of you.

4258
04:45:59,880 --> 04:46:01,880
And you'll just pull it out of your memory.

4259
04:46:01,880 --> 04:46:02,880
That's how it works.

4260
04:46:02,880 --> 04:46:03,880
Just get some good sleep.

4261
04:46:03,880 --> 04:46:05,119
That's one thing a lot of people,

4262
04:46:05,119 --> 04:46:08,119
big mistake people make when they're in college

4263
04:46:08,119 --> 04:46:16,560
is they prioritize cramming all night before the exam

4264
04:46:16,560 --> 04:46:20,240
and getting 45 minutes of sleep

4265
04:46:20,240 --> 04:46:25,599
and then just slumbering just to class

4266
04:46:25,599 --> 04:46:28,099
with your eyes half closed.

4267
04:46:28,099 --> 04:46:30,599
And then you're just delirious.

4268
04:46:30,599 --> 04:46:33,090
And you actually do better.

4269
04:46:33,090 --> 04:46:35,090
Your mind retains information

4270
04:46:35,090 --> 04:46:38,090
when you have a full night's rest to process

4271
04:46:38,090 --> 04:46:40,400
and kind of break it all down.

4272
04:46:40,400 --> 04:46:41,700
Get a good night's sleep.

4273
04:46:41,700 --> 04:46:44,259
Go over some basic stuff when you wake up.

4274
04:46:44,259 --> 04:46:46,259
It's better for you if you do it that way.

4275
04:46:46,259 --> 04:46:52,599
Don't sleep so your memory doesn't escape from your ear

4276
04:46:52,599 --> 04:46:53,599
as you lay in bed.

4277
04:46:53,599 --> 04:47:04,770
I skip a good night's sleep to watch your stream.

4278
04:47:04,770 --> 04:47:10,979
Don't tell me what to do.

4279
04:47:10,979 --> 04:47:12,979
Hey, some people it works.

4280
04:47:12,979 --> 04:47:14,349
It never worked for me.

4281
04:47:14,349 --> 04:47:17,840
I would get better grades when I just was sitting there going

4282
04:47:17,840 --> 04:47:20,840
okay so I have all this stuff I need to remember.

4283
04:47:20,840 --> 04:47:23,840
I kind of know it but let me just go over it

4284
04:47:23,840 --> 04:47:28,840
and repeat over and over again information for fucking 12 hours

4285
04:47:28,840 --> 04:47:30,840
and then like go to class.

4286
04:47:30,840 --> 04:47:31,840
Wait, what? I forget.

4287
04:47:31,840 --> 04:47:35,790
What if you just go to sleep and you study a little bit.

4288
04:47:35,790 --> 04:47:37,790
I'm not saying don't study.

4289
04:47:37,790 --> 04:47:40,090
Get some good knowledge in your head.

4290
04:47:40,090 --> 04:47:42,090
Eat a good dinner.

4291
04:47:42,090 --> 04:47:43,090
And I'm talking fish.

4292
04:47:43,090 --> 04:47:45,090
Eat fish before dinner.

4293
04:47:45,090 --> 04:47:46,090
And then go to sleep.

4294
04:47:46,090 --> 04:47:48,090
Wake up and eat some more fish.

4295
04:47:48,090 --> 04:47:50,090
You want like salmon.

4296
04:47:50,090 --> 04:47:52,090
You want tuna fish before you go to bed.

4297
04:47:52,090 --> 04:47:53,090
And then you want salmon in the morning.

4298
04:47:53,090 --> 04:48:02,049
You want those omega-3s to be just

4299
04:48:02,049 --> 04:48:06,470
I can't go high anymore.

4300
04:48:06,470 --> 04:48:07,639
I really am getting old.

4301
04:48:07,639 --> 04:48:09,650
Let's try that again.

4302
04:48:09,650 --> 04:48:16,200
You want those omega-3s in your head to go

4303
04:48:16,200 --> 04:48:17,200
See?

4304
04:48:17,200 --> 04:48:19,790
Fuck, I still got it.

4305
04:48:19,790 --> 04:48:26,029
So then when the omega-3s go into your neuro area

4306
04:48:26,029 --> 04:48:31,799
it's much easier for memory, for cognitive ability.

4307
04:48:31,799 --> 04:48:32,799
It's great.

4308
04:48:32,799 --> 04:48:33,799
Fish.

4309
04:48:33,799 --> 04:48:35,799
Eat salmon tonight if you have a final tomorrow.

4310
04:48:35,799 --> 04:48:46,750
Omega-3, is that a new steam game?

4311
04:48:46,750 --> 04:48:47,750
No, it's for your brain.

4312
04:48:47,750 --> 04:48:54,619
Anyways, good luck on your finals, guys.

4313
04:48:54,619 --> 04:48:57,950
Where am I going to buy salmon at 12 p.m.?

4314
04:48:57,950 --> 04:48:59,950
At the grocery store at 12 p.m.?

4315
04:49:00,950 --> 04:49:04,020
Are you talking about 12 a.m.?

4316
04:49:04,020 --> 04:49:07,479
No, and do not supplement this with like a

4317
04:49:07,479 --> 04:49:09,479
Filet-O-Fish from McDonald's.

4318
04:49:09,479 --> 04:49:10,479
It's not the same thing.

4319
04:49:10,479 --> 04:49:13,479
You may as well eat cardboard with fish flavoring.

4320
04:49:13,479 --> 04:49:14,479
That's not the same deal.

4321
04:49:14,479 --> 04:49:15,479
You don't do that.

4322
04:49:15,479 --> 04:49:16,479
Oh, he said eat fish.

4323
04:49:16,479 --> 04:49:24,680
I'm going to eat like four Filet-O-Fishes

4324
04:49:24,680 --> 04:49:25,680
and have diarrhea in the morning.

4325
04:49:25,680 --> 04:49:26,680
That's not going to help you.

4326
04:49:26,680 --> 04:49:28,680
That's going to be bad.

4327
04:49:28,680 --> 04:49:41,459
And if you can't get fish, then eat

4328
04:49:41,459 --> 04:49:43,459
a bunch of macaroni tomorrow morning.

4329
04:49:43,459 --> 04:49:45,459
Load up on some carbs.

4330
04:49:45,459 --> 04:49:50,750
Carb out in the morning so you just get brain.

4331
04:49:51,750 --> 04:49:52,750
You got like the energy.

4332
04:49:52,750 --> 04:49:53,750
You know what I mean?

4333
04:49:53,750 --> 04:50:00,560
No, lose the cheese.

4334
04:50:00,560 --> 04:50:01,560
Lose the cheese.

4335
04:50:01,560 --> 04:50:02,560
Don't put cheese on that.

4336
04:50:02,560 --> 04:50:04,439
Just macaroni.

4337
04:50:04,439 --> 04:50:05,439
Cooked macaroni.

4338
04:50:05,439 --> 04:50:07,439
Drizzle a bunch of olive oil on.

4339
04:50:07,439 --> 04:50:10,439
Sprinkle a little bit of maybe a little bit of Parmesan.

4340
04:50:10,439 --> 04:50:11,439
You know what I mean?

4341
04:50:11,439 --> 04:50:12,439
Parmesan.

4342
04:50:12,439 --> 04:50:13,439
Parmesan.

4343
04:50:13,439 --> 04:50:15,639
Am I saying that right?

4344
04:50:15,639 --> 04:50:16,639
Parmesan.

4345
04:50:16,639 --> 04:50:17,639
How do you?

4346
04:50:17,639 --> 04:50:18,810
Parmigiano.

4347
04:50:18,810 --> 04:50:21,270
It's Parmigiano, right?

4348
04:50:21,270 --> 04:50:29,009
How do you actually say that word correctly?

4349
04:50:29,009 --> 04:50:31,009
It's like Parmigiano, right?

4350
04:50:31,009 --> 04:50:37,439
That's the correct pronunciation.

4351
04:50:37,439 --> 04:50:39,439
It's not Parmesan, right?

4352
04:50:39,439 --> 04:50:40,439
It's like Parmigiano.

4353
04:50:40,439 --> 04:50:50,889
Yeah, it's Parmigiano Reggiano, right?

4354
04:50:50,889 --> 04:50:51,889
Okay, good.

4355
04:50:56,009 --> 04:50:58,009
Boomer pronunciation.

4356
04:51:02,110 --> 04:51:11,430
Well, that's what they do on the Food Network when I watch Chopped.

4357
04:51:11,430 --> 04:51:15,049
The guy's like, okay, so what we got?

4358
04:51:15,049 --> 04:51:16,049
What's in the basket?

4359
04:51:16,049 --> 04:51:19,049
Well, what I've got here is I've got a salmon steak.

4360
04:51:19,049 --> 04:51:21,049
I've got some salsa.

4361
04:51:21,049 --> 04:51:24,049
And then what's over here where I've got some Parmigiano Reggiano?

4362
04:51:24,049 --> 04:51:26,049
Okay, I'm like, all right, now I know how to say that now.

4363
04:51:26,049 --> 04:51:41,860
Why is it always the same three judges?

4364
04:51:41,860 --> 04:51:43,860
Because they're experts.

4365
04:51:43,860 --> 04:51:52,689
Food Network uses fake ingredients?

4366
04:51:52,689 --> 04:51:53,689
What?

4367
04:51:53,689 --> 04:52:06,520
Hey, how are you doing?

4368
04:52:06,520 --> 04:52:08,520
Can I get a sausage mushroom pizza?

4369
04:52:08,520 --> 04:52:20,159
What the fuck are you talking about?

4370
04:52:20,159 --> 04:52:24,029
Why would you put that in all caps?

4371
04:52:24,029 --> 04:52:26,029
What if you're not watching Guy Fiery?

4372
04:52:26,029 --> 04:52:28,029
I've seen every single episode of Diner's Drive-ins and Dives.

4373
04:52:28,029 --> 04:52:29,029
Every single one.

4374
04:52:29,029 --> 04:52:36,259
There's not one episode I've missed.

4375
04:52:36,259 --> 04:52:42,400
What happens in episode 34?

4376
04:52:42,400 --> 04:52:43,400
He goes, this?

4377
04:52:43,400 --> 04:52:44,709
That's killer.

4378
04:52:44,709 --> 04:52:47,319
You knocked it out of the park, man.

4379
04:52:51,200 --> 04:53:00,200
I just, there it is.

4380
04:53:00,200 --> 04:53:03,200
Anyways, thank you to Drosophilia for the $1.

4381
04:53:03,200 --> 04:53:05,700
Hey, Jeremy, I used to use a razor death adder for a few years,

4382
04:53:05,700 --> 04:53:08,700
but the clicks started messing up and I had to get a new mouse.

4383
04:53:08,700 --> 04:53:11,939
I've been using a PIC Tech mouse for several months now.

4384
04:53:11,939 --> 04:53:13,939
It's insanely good for how cheap it is.

4385
04:53:13,939 --> 04:53:18,369
And I promise the customization software isn't malware.

4386
04:53:18,369 --> 04:53:31,810
Thank you, Drosophilia.

4387
04:53:31,810 --> 04:53:34,950
I just got this, though.

4388
04:53:34,950 --> 04:53:35,950
That's the worst part.

4389
04:53:35,950 --> 04:53:39,599
And then they say I'm not sponsored, I swear.

4390
04:53:39,599 --> 04:53:43,419
I didn't think you were.

4391
04:53:43,419 --> 04:53:46,130
It's alright.

4392
04:53:46,130 --> 04:53:50,720
Uh, Drum Mage Door.

4393
04:53:50,720 --> 04:53:52,720
Drum Mage Door.

4394
04:53:52,720 --> 04:53:53,720
Thanks for the $10.

4395
04:53:53,720 --> 04:53:54,720
Greetings from Finland.

4396
04:53:54,720 --> 04:53:56,720
Glad to see you playing one of my favorite games of all time.

4397
04:53:56,720 --> 04:53:59,720
I hope you'll suffer through the second one, too.

4398
04:53:59,720 --> 04:54:01,720
That one also has a hard mode.

4399
04:54:01,720 --> 04:54:08,720
I probably will never do it.

4400
04:54:08,720 --> 04:54:12,880
But thank you for the $10, I really appreciate it.

4401
04:54:12,880 --> 04:54:22,599
I hope you'll suffer.

4402
04:54:22,599 --> 04:54:24,290
Thank you.

4403
04:54:24,290 --> 04:54:25,290
Uh, Parfalo Mule.

4404
04:54:25,290 --> 04:54:26,290
Thanks for the $1.

4405
04:54:26,290 --> 04:54:28,290
Can you be my father for five minutes, please?

4406
04:54:28,290 --> 04:54:33,180
Um, how about five seconds?

4407
04:54:33,180 --> 04:54:37,919
Son?

4408
04:54:37,919 --> 04:54:38,919
Okay.

4409
04:54:38,919 --> 04:54:41,919
Thank you to one, uh, Demonic Cucumber.

4410
04:54:41,919 --> 04:54:42,919
Thanks for the $1.

4411
04:54:42,919 --> 04:54:44,930
Hey, Jeremy.

4412
04:54:44,930 --> 04:54:46,930
I'm here to say, I'm here to pay my comedy dues.

4413
04:54:46,930 --> 04:54:49,930
I'm in a worse place than last month, but your streams are pulling me through.

4414
04:54:49,930 --> 04:54:50,930
Thank you for the wonderful community.

4415
04:54:50,930 --> 04:54:54,930
PS, anyone else think that the Jexy mode looks like a guy doing Coke?

4416
04:54:54,930 --> 04:55:00,270
What?

4417
04:55:00,270 --> 04:55:04,959
I don't think so.

4418
04:55:04,959 --> 04:55:12,520
This looks like my face.

4419
04:55:12,520 --> 04:55:13,520
Thank you, Demonic Cucumber.

4420
04:55:13,520 --> 04:55:17,759
Uh, sorry to hear that you're in a bad place.

4421
04:55:17,759 --> 04:55:20,919
Take care of yourself.

4422
04:55:20,919 --> 04:55:22,549
Thanks for sticking around.

4423
04:55:22,549 --> 04:55:24,849
Hopefully you get better and feel better soon.

4424
04:55:24,849 --> 04:55:32,560
Thank you.

4425
04:55:32,560 --> 04:55:34,180
For the $1.

4426
04:55:34,180 --> 04:55:37,189
And Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.

4427
04:55:37,189 --> 04:55:40,189
Hey, remember when Demon Lord Zaraxos played Five Nights at Freddy's?

4428
04:55:40,189 --> 04:55:42,189
I do and I won't let you forget.

4429
04:55:42,189 --> 04:55:45,189
Yeah, that, that is a video that I, I did not delete.

4430
04:55:45,189 --> 04:55:47,069
Or did I?

4431
04:55:47,069 --> 04:55:48,069
I may have deleted that.

4432
04:55:48,069 --> 04:55:55,020
Yeah, that video exists, I think.

4433
04:55:55,020 --> 04:56:02,790
Does it still exist?

4434
04:56:02,790 --> 04:56:03,790
It might not.

4435
04:56:03,790 --> 04:56:04,790
It's still up.

4436
04:56:04,790 --> 04:56:05,790
No, it's not.

4437
04:56:05,790 --> 04:56:19,799
All right, we're going to watch this video right now.

4438
04:56:19,799 --> 04:56:24,770
Because this is going to be fucking painful for me, but I, maybe not.

4439
04:56:24,770 --> 04:56:25,770
We'll see.

4440
04:56:25,770 --> 04:56:28,009
Five Nights at Freddy's.

4441
04:56:28,009 --> 04:56:39,889
Hey, what's going on, everybody?

4442
04:56:39,889 --> 04:56:42,889
It's me, Demon Lord Zaraxos here.

4443
04:56:42,889 --> 04:56:44,889
Uh, you're probably wondering where, where's Jerma?

4444
04:56:44,889 --> 04:56:45,889
What happened to him?

4445
04:56:45,889 --> 04:56:47,889
How come he's not doing this video?

4446
04:56:47,889 --> 04:56:50,889
Well, it's because I have taken over his soul.

4447
04:56:50,889 --> 04:56:56,889
And I will only release it after playing around a Five Nights at Freddy's.

4448
04:56:56,889 --> 04:56:59,889
Because everyone wants to see Five Nights at Freddy's.

4449
04:56:59,889 --> 04:57:01,889
And who better than me?

4450
04:57:01,889 --> 04:57:04,130
You got to be ten at EP.

4451
04:57:04,130 --> 04:57:08,130
The lord of all hells and demons and hatred.

4452
04:57:08,130 --> 04:57:09,130
I'm not scared of anything.

4453
04:57:09,130 --> 04:57:14,130
What could I possibly be afraid of in this little shit game?

4454
04:57:14,130 --> 04:57:15,130
I don't know.

4455
04:57:15,130 --> 04:57:16,130
We'll find out very shortly.

4456
04:57:16,130 --> 04:57:19,130
Let's go ahead and play a new game.

4457
04:57:19,130 --> 04:57:27,450
This guy sounds kind of like an asshole.

4458
04:57:27,450 --> 04:57:29,450
I'm going to ignore him.

4459
04:57:29,450 --> 04:57:33,610
Let's go camera 4B.

4460
04:57:33,610 --> 04:57:34,610
That's what we're on.

4461
04:57:34,610 --> 04:57:35,919
It's too stretched.

4462
04:57:35,919 --> 04:57:36,919
Hold on.

4463
04:57:36,919 --> 04:57:37,919
Let me, let me reset it then.

4464
04:57:37,919 --> 04:57:44,439
So how come it's not happening over here?

4465
04:57:44,439 --> 04:57:49,180
That guy has to be stretched, apparently.

4466
04:57:49,180 --> 04:57:51,180
Supposed to be 1080, man.

4467
04:57:51,180 --> 04:57:53,509
Oh, whatever.

4468
04:57:53,509 --> 04:57:59,229
You get the idea.

4469
04:57:59,229 --> 04:58:04,349
Let me turn this off.

4470
04:58:04,349 --> 04:58:09,209
Camera 5.

4471
04:58:09,209 --> 04:58:12,159
It's in full screen.

4472
04:58:12,159 --> 04:58:13,159
Is it bad?

4473
04:58:13,159 --> 04:58:14,159
I don't like birds.

4474
04:58:14,159 --> 04:58:16,159
Oh, this sucks.

4475
04:58:16,159 --> 04:58:17,159
Camera 1A.

4476
04:58:17,159 --> 04:58:26,159
Camera 7.

4477
04:58:26,159 --> 04:58:29,110
Close the door.

4478
04:58:29,110 --> 04:58:32,049
What the fuck was that?

4479
04:58:32,049 --> 04:58:33,049
Okay.

4480
04:58:33,049 --> 04:58:34,049
Well, that was a little weird.

4481
04:58:34,049 --> 04:58:36,049
That was like a bird in my face.

4482
04:58:36,049 --> 04:58:37,049
I wasn't scared.

4483
04:58:37,049 --> 04:58:38,049
I was not scared of that.

4484
04:58:38,049 --> 04:58:39,049
I was just startled at it.

4485
04:58:39,049 --> 04:58:41,049
It jumped up at me and it scared me.

4486
04:58:41,049 --> 04:58:44,049
So obviously, that'll scare you.

4487
04:58:44,049 --> 04:58:46,049
I wasn't, don't think that I was scared though.

4488
04:58:46,049 --> 04:58:48,049
Because like you were scared.

4489
04:58:48,049 --> 04:58:49,049
I wasn't the one that was scared.

4490
04:58:49,049 --> 04:58:51,049
It was you actually.

4491
04:58:51,049 --> 04:58:54,049
And you look, there's a blinking light over there now.

4492
04:58:54,049 --> 04:58:57,000
Freddy.

4493
04:58:57,000 --> 04:58:59,169
This has 300,000 views.

4494
04:58:59,169 --> 04:59:00,169
I'm embarrassed.

4495
04:59:00,169 --> 04:59:02,169
Where are you, Freddy?

4496
04:59:02,169 --> 04:59:05,169
You can't hide from demon lord Zaraxos.

4497
04:59:05,169 --> 04:59:07,169
I will boil you.

4498
04:59:07,169 --> 04:59:10,169
I will eat your flesh and tear off the bones.

4499
04:59:10,169 --> 04:59:14,169
And use them as toothpicks in my stew.

4500
04:59:14,169 --> 04:59:17,169
If you think I'm going to be scared of your...

4501
04:59:17,169 --> 04:59:19,169
One of them is missing.

4502
04:59:19,169 --> 04:59:21,169
Okay, one of them is missing now.

4503
04:59:21,169 --> 04:59:24,169
There was a rhinoceros that was here before.

4504
04:59:24,169 --> 04:59:25,169
And he just ain't here.

4505
04:59:25,169 --> 04:59:28,169
This bear might have moved.

4506
04:59:28,169 --> 04:59:31,169
I might have seen him somewhere.

4507
04:59:31,169 --> 04:59:32,169
I don't know.

4508
04:59:32,169 --> 04:59:34,169
Pirate Cove is out of order.

4509
04:59:34,169 --> 04:59:39,169
Let's just go back and make sure there's nobody potentially trying to kill me.

4510
04:59:39,169 --> 04:59:41,169
But I will kill them first.

4511
04:59:41,169 --> 04:59:43,169
That's what you need to remember from this whole thing.

4512
04:59:43,169 --> 04:59:46,169
I will kill them first before they try to kill me.

4513
04:59:46,169 --> 04:59:47,169
We're halfway through this video.

4514
04:59:47,169 --> 04:59:49,169
There is a guy standing there.

4515
04:59:49,169 --> 04:59:54,169
There is a guy in a funny little suit standing there now.

4516
04:59:54,169 --> 04:59:56,169
And I don't really know what to do.

4517
04:59:56,169 --> 04:59:57,169
Should I...

4518
04:59:57,169 --> 05:00:00,169
He's still there, okay.

4519
05:00:00,169 --> 05:00:02,169
I got it, it was so boring.

4520
05:00:02,169 --> 05:00:03,169
I had to like...

4521
05:00:03,169 --> 05:00:04,169
Hold on, let's keep going.

4522
05:00:31,040 --> 05:00:36,990
Oh, there's more.

4523
05:00:41,159 --> 05:00:45,159
You get killed by the people, the participants in the suits.

4524
05:00:45,159 --> 05:00:48,470
I don't know why you would ever do such a thing.

4525
05:00:48,470 --> 05:00:50,639
You come work for me.

4526
05:00:50,639 --> 05:00:52,639
At least there's benefits down in hell.

4527
05:00:52,639 --> 05:00:54,819
You know, you get a good dental plan.

4528
05:00:54,819 --> 05:00:56,819
You get good dental.

4529
05:00:56,819 --> 05:00:58,819
You know, we're gonna continue.

4530
05:00:58,819 --> 05:00:59,819
I'm going to get...

4531
05:00:59,819 --> 05:01:02,819
I don't even know what the goal here is.

4532
05:01:02,819 --> 05:01:04,250
I do not see him anywhere.

4533
05:01:04,250 --> 05:01:06,250
Where is he?

4534
05:01:06,250 --> 05:01:07,430
He's in the kitchen.

4535
05:01:07,430 --> 05:01:08,430
He's in the kitchen.

4536
05:01:08,430 --> 05:01:09,430
The son of a bitch is in the kitchen.

4537
05:01:09,430 --> 05:01:13,080
We're doing the same thing again.

4538
05:01:13,080 --> 05:01:15,080
That means he's coming out here.

4539
05:01:15,080 --> 05:01:17,080
Yeah, he's in the kitchen.

4540
05:01:17,080 --> 05:01:18,380
No, he's in this one.

4541
05:01:18,380 --> 05:01:20,380
Oh, by the way, I remember this video.

4542
05:01:20,380 --> 05:01:22,380
I actually have a distinct memory.

4543
05:01:22,380 --> 05:01:25,380
This video had a lot of dislikes.

4544
05:01:25,380 --> 05:01:27,619
I remember uploading it.

4545
05:01:27,619 --> 05:01:33,619
And after those of you guys that don't know about like YouTube-ing and making videos,

4546
05:01:33,619 --> 05:01:35,619
I would sit there after an upload and I would go,

4547
05:01:35,619 --> 05:01:37,619
Oh, okay, let me see.

4548
05:01:37,619 --> 05:01:39,619
Did it publish correctly?

4549
05:01:39,619 --> 05:01:41,619
Did it go into subfeeds?

4550
05:01:41,619 --> 05:01:42,619
And what are people saying?

4551
05:01:42,619 --> 05:01:45,619
And okay, like the first hour or so of a video being live,

4552
05:01:45,619 --> 05:01:49,619
I kind of hung out to see what people were saying and how it was being judged

4553
05:01:49,619 --> 05:01:51,619
and what people were saying about it.

4554
05:01:51,619 --> 05:01:54,619
And like 40 dislikes came in really quickly.

4555
05:01:54,619 --> 05:01:55,919
And that was a lot.

4556
05:01:55,919 --> 05:01:57,919
I remember that back here,

4557
05:01:57,919 --> 05:02:04,060
this is back when I think the channel had maybe like 100,000 subs,

4558
05:02:04,060 --> 05:02:06,060
125,000 subs at that point.

4559
05:02:06,060 --> 05:02:12,060
So I was not used to like 100 dislikes over the course of the first hour.

4560
05:02:12,060 --> 05:02:14,060
And I remember going, what do I do about this?

4561
05:02:14,060 --> 05:02:15,060
Do I delete this video?

4562
05:02:15,060 --> 05:02:16,060
Should I delete this video?

4563
05:02:16,060 --> 05:02:17,060
I actually was going to delete this video.

4564
05:02:17,060 --> 05:02:19,060
Okay, now he's right here.

4565
05:02:19,060 --> 05:02:22,500
He's going to be right here.

4566
05:02:22,500 --> 05:02:23,500
No, he's not right here.

4567
05:02:23,500 --> 05:02:25,189
Where is he?

4568
05:02:25,189 --> 05:02:26,189
Oh, he's right.

4569
05:02:26,189 --> 05:02:27,189
Okay, he's right here.

4570
05:02:27,189 --> 05:02:28,189
He's literally staring at me.

4571
05:02:28,189 --> 05:02:29,189
It's 4 a.m.

4572
05:02:29,189 --> 05:02:31,189
Don't let them come in.

4573
05:02:31,189 --> 05:02:33,200
Do not let them come in.

4574
05:02:33,200 --> 05:02:34,200
Is the door locked?

4575
05:02:34,200 --> 05:02:36,200
Both of the doors are closed.

4576
05:02:36,200 --> 05:02:39,840
You stay where you are.

4577
05:02:39,840 --> 05:02:43,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

4578
05:02:43,840 --> 05:02:44,840
None of that.

4579
05:02:44,840 --> 05:02:46,150
We're not going to have any of that.

4580
05:02:46,150 --> 05:02:51,150
I must have had like nothing to make for a video today.

4581
05:02:51,150 --> 05:02:53,479
It's closed.

4582
05:02:53,479 --> 05:02:54,479
We're at 4 a.m.

4583
05:02:54,479 --> 05:02:55,479
now.

4584
05:02:55,479 --> 05:02:56,479
Just got to get through the night.

4585
05:02:56,479 --> 05:02:57,650
No, no.

4586
05:02:57,650 --> 05:02:58,650
I got through the night.

4587
05:02:58,650 --> 05:02:59,650
I did it.

4588
05:02:59,650 --> 05:03:00,650
I was staring.

4589
05:03:00,650 --> 05:03:01,650
I got through the night.

4590
05:03:01,650 --> 05:03:02,650
This is come on.

4591
05:03:02,650 --> 05:03:03,650
We won.

4592
05:03:03,650 --> 05:03:05,919
I won the game.

4593
05:03:05,919 --> 05:03:06,919
No, the same.

4594
05:03:06,919 --> 05:03:07,919
This is two videos.

4595
05:03:07,919 --> 05:03:08,919
I was staring at him.

4596
05:03:08,919 --> 05:03:11,689
What the hell?

4597
05:03:11,689 --> 05:03:12,689
Oh, boo, here he comes.

4598
05:03:12,689 --> 05:03:14,250
He's going to come.

4599
05:03:14,250 --> 05:03:15,250
Oh, oh, boy.

4600
05:03:15,250 --> 05:03:16,250
Don't get scared.

4601
05:03:16,250 --> 05:03:17,250
Oh, oh, boy.

4602
05:03:17,250 --> 05:03:18,250
Don't get scared.

4603
05:03:18,250 --> 05:03:19,250
Oh, get them.

4604
05:03:19,250 --> 05:03:20,250
That's not my mouse.

4605
05:03:20,250 --> 05:03:21,250
You know what?

4606
05:03:21,250 --> 05:03:28,319
I'm just I'm just going to go play Super Mario Brothers.

4607
05:03:28,319 --> 05:03:29,319
It's just I don't want to play this anymore.

4608
05:03:29,319 --> 05:03:30,319
Jerma, Jerma, your soul is now free.

4609
05:03:30,319 --> 05:03:31,319
I'm releasing you.

4610
05:03:31,319 --> 05:03:32,319
Whoa.

4611
05:03:32,319 --> 05:03:33,319
Where?

4612
05:03:33,319 --> 05:03:34,619
What happened?

4613
05:03:34,619 --> 05:03:35,619
Well, just calm down.

4614
05:03:35,619 --> 05:03:36,619
Calm down.

4615
05:03:36,619 --> 05:03:38,369
Everything's OK.

4616
05:03:38,369 --> 05:03:39,369
Everything's all right.

4617
05:03:39,369 --> 05:03:40,369
I have it under control.

4618
05:03:40,369 --> 05:03:41,369
I stole your soul so I could get it.

4619
05:03:41,369 --> 05:03:42,369
I stole your soul.

4620
05:03:42,369 --> 05:03:43,369
I stole your soul.

4621
05:03:43,369 --> 05:03:44,369
I stole your soul.

4622
05:03:44,369 --> 05:03:45,369
I stole your soul.

4623
05:03:45,369 --> 05:03:46,740
I stole your soul.

4624
05:03:46,740 --> 05:03:47,740
I stole your soul.

4625
05:03:47,740 --> 05:03:48,740
I stole your soul.

4626
05:03:48,740 --> 05:03:49,740
I stole your soul.

4627
05:03:49,740 --> 05:03:50,740
I stole your soul.

4628
05:03:50,740 --> 05:03:51,740
I stole your soul.

4629
05:03:51,740 --> 05:03:56,740
I stole your soul so I can come to Earth to play Five Nights at Freddy's.

4630
05:03:56,740 --> 05:04:04,159
Oh, that sucked.

4631
05:04:04,159 --> 05:04:05,919
All right.

4632
05:04:05,919 --> 05:04:06,919
I'm deleting that video.

4633
05:04:06,919 --> 05:04:14,619
I'm deleting.

4634
05:04:14,619 --> 05:04:21,939
It's deleted.

4635
05:04:21,939 --> 05:04:25,549
All right.

4636
05:04:25,549 --> 05:04:33,689
Anyways, let's we're almost at the end of the bits here.

4637
05:04:33,689 --> 05:04:42,590
Thank you to thank you Smelly Boy for reminding us of that video.

4638
05:04:42,590 --> 05:04:45,209
Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.

4639
05:04:45,209 --> 05:04:46,209
$2 actually here.

4640
05:04:46,209 --> 05:04:50,450
I was introducing your streams to my mom on the way to therapy yesterday.

4641
05:04:50,450 --> 05:04:51,450
She really liked the videos.

4642
05:04:51,450 --> 05:04:55,450
Also, we both agree that you look really attractive for $33.

4643
05:04:55,450 --> 05:04:58,689
Anyway, keep up the good work Mr. Boomer.

4644
05:04:58,689 --> 05:05:04,200
All right.

4645
05:05:04,200 --> 05:05:05,200
For $33.

4646
05:05:05,200 --> 05:05:09,939
Thank you Demonic Cucumber for the $1.

4647
05:05:09,939 --> 05:05:11,630
Ugly old man.

4648
05:05:11,630 --> 05:05:12,630
Come on.

4649
05:05:12,630 --> 05:05:13,630
Get out of here.

4650
05:05:13,630 --> 05:05:18,240
Boomer is attractive to mother.

4651
05:05:18,240 --> 05:05:19,479
Oh, come on.

4652
05:05:19,479 --> 05:05:23,639
Thank you Demonic Cucumber for the $1.

4653
05:05:23,639 --> 05:05:25,639
Thank you Leather Jacket for the $5.

4654
05:05:25,639 --> 05:05:28,389
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

4655
05:05:28,389 --> 05:05:30,389
Good to see you play one of my all-time favorites.

4656
05:05:30,389 --> 05:05:33,099
That was good.

4657
05:05:33,099 --> 05:05:34,099
That was really fun.

4658
05:05:34,099 --> 05:05:36,490
That was a great game.

4659
05:05:36,490 --> 05:05:38,240
Thank you Leather Jacket.

4660
05:05:38,240 --> 05:05:40,240
Thank you Leather Jacket for the $5.

4661
05:05:40,240 --> 05:05:41,240
And for being in the game.

4662
05:05:41,240 --> 05:05:42,610
That was you.

4663
05:05:42,610 --> 05:05:46,880
Demonic Cucumber again says, thanks for the $1.

4664
05:05:46,880 --> 05:05:50,880
Loud crashing noises should be the name of your autobiography.

4665
05:05:50,880 --> 05:05:57,119
Claire of Astora, thanks for the $4.

4666
05:05:57,119 --> 05:06:02,159
So when is Hotline Miami 2 planned to be played?

4667
05:06:02,159 --> 05:06:05,869
I would probably say next week.

4668
05:06:05,869 --> 05:06:06,869
Next week.

4669
05:06:06,869 --> 05:06:09,560
Maybe that's the first thing we'll do next week.

4670
05:06:09,560 --> 05:06:11,990
Let's just start with that and play it.

4671
05:06:11,990 --> 05:06:12,990
Let's see.

4672
05:06:12,990 --> 05:06:23,159
How long is it lengthwise compared to the first one?

4673
05:06:23,159 --> 05:06:25,159
That was about four and a half hours.

4674
05:06:25,159 --> 05:06:26,849
It's a little bit longer.

4675
05:06:26,849 --> 05:06:28,849
It's like three times as long.

4676
05:06:28,849 --> 05:06:31,369
Really.

4677
05:06:31,369 --> 05:06:33,319
Way longer.

4678
05:06:33,319 --> 05:06:34,319
So what is it?

4679
05:06:34,319 --> 05:06:35,319
Is it like a 10 to 12 hour game?

4680
05:06:35,319 --> 05:06:39,630
8 to 10?

4681
05:06:39,630 --> 05:06:41,830
All right.

4682
05:06:41,830 --> 05:06:42,830
We might be able to do that in one stream.

4683
05:06:42,830 --> 05:06:47,779
I might just completely hunker down.

4684
05:06:47,779 --> 05:06:48,779
Why didn't EDF happen tonight?

4685
05:06:48,779 --> 05:06:53,209
I pushed it to tomorrow because we wanted to make sure that we could get the party

4686
05:06:53,209 --> 05:06:54,209
of three that we wanted.

4687
05:06:54,209 --> 05:06:57,479
We wanted to play with a party of three.

4688
05:06:57,479 --> 05:07:05,389
So I didn't want to just play by myself or just one person if it's more fun

4689
05:07:05,389 --> 05:07:06,389
with like three or four.

4690
05:07:06,389 --> 05:07:09,389
So we have it's happening tomorrow.

4691
05:07:09,389 --> 05:07:12,360
Yes.

4692
05:07:12,360 --> 05:07:13,599
Star and italics.

4693
05:07:13,599 --> 05:07:16,880
Those are the two.

4694
05:07:16,880 --> 05:07:18,880
Thank you to Peel Peel Peeling for the five dollars.

4695
05:07:18,880 --> 05:07:19,880
No message.

4696
05:07:19,880 --> 05:07:21,759
Thanks for five bucks.

4697
05:07:21,759 --> 05:07:22,759
Dinky Duper.

4698
05:07:22,759 --> 05:07:23,759
Thanks for one dollar.

4699
05:07:23,759 --> 05:07:26,759
I had a lot of fun watching your PG Hotline Miami stream tonight.

4700
05:07:26,759 --> 05:07:28,580
PG.

4701
05:07:28,580 --> 05:07:33,000
I've actually never played it either.

4702
05:07:33,000 --> 05:07:37,169
By the way, what the hell was with that missing easy shots joke?

4703
05:07:37,169 --> 05:07:39,540
Maybe I'm not Boomer enough to get it.

4704
05:07:39,540 --> 05:07:40,540
Have a great night.

4705
05:07:40,540 --> 05:07:48,450
Man, excited for tomorrow.

4706
05:07:48,450 --> 05:07:49,450
Well, whatever.

4707
05:07:49,450 --> 05:07:51,459
Thank you, Dinky Duper.

4708
05:07:51,459 --> 05:07:53,459
Thank you, Timmy Tim Tam for the one dollar.

4709
05:07:53,459 --> 05:07:58,430
Back to your regularly scheduled bookstore conversation.

4710
05:07:58,430 --> 05:07:59,430
Oh, right.

4711
05:07:59,430 --> 05:08:01,180
OK.

4712
05:08:01,180 --> 05:08:03,180
Thank you to Peel Peeling again for five dollars.

4713
05:08:03,180 --> 05:08:06,189
I hate to get up in the morning.

4714
05:08:06,189 --> 05:08:07,189
Me too.

4715
05:08:07,189 --> 05:08:08,189
What time do you get up?

4716
05:08:08,189 --> 05:08:09,189
At six o'clock.

4717
05:08:09,189 --> 05:08:10,189
Why do you get up so early?

4718
05:08:10,189 --> 05:08:12,189
I have to be at work by seven.

4719
05:08:12,189 --> 05:08:13,189
I don't get up until eight.

4720
05:08:13,189 --> 05:08:14,189
You're lucky.

4721
05:08:14,189 --> 05:08:15,189
What do you do?

4722
05:08:15,189 --> 05:08:16,189
I own a bookstore.

4723
05:08:16,189 --> 05:08:18,189
What time does your store open?

4724
05:08:18,189 --> 05:08:20,189
At eight thirty.

4725
05:08:20,189 --> 05:08:22,490
I hate to get up.

4726
05:08:22,490 --> 05:08:24,490
I hate to get up in the morning.

4727
05:08:24,490 --> 05:08:25,490
Me too.

4728
05:08:25,490 --> 05:08:26,490
What time do you get up?

4729
05:08:26,490 --> 05:08:27,490
At six o'clock.

4730
05:08:27,490 --> 05:08:28,490
Why do you get up so early?

4731
05:08:28,490 --> 05:08:30,490
I have to be at work by seven.

4732
05:08:30,490 --> 05:08:31,490
I don't get up until eight.

4733
05:08:31,490 --> 05:08:32,490
You're lucky.

4734
05:08:32,490 --> 05:08:33,490
I don't get up until eight.

4735
05:08:33,490 --> 05:08:34,490
What do you do?

4736
05:08:34,490 --> 05:08:35,490
I own a bookstore.

4737
05:08:35,490 --> 05:08:36,490
What time does your store open?

4738
05:08:36,490 --> 05:08:37,490
At eight thirty.

4739
05:08:37,490 --> 05:08:45,080
The best part about Daily English TV, which is the best YouTube channel I think that currently exists.

4740
05:08:45,080 --> 05:08:54,720
This video has 39 views.

4741
05:08:54,720 --> 05:08:57,599
Daily English TV.

4742
05:08:57,599 --> 05:09:02,009
What a great channel.

4743
05:09:02,009 --> 05:09:04,009
I think it's so you can have more than 30 now.

4744
05:09:04,009 --> 05:09:06,009
Yeah, and probably all of them are from this channel.

4745
05:09:06,009 --> 05:09:14,439
But thank you to Timmy Tim Tam.

4746
05:09:14,439 --> 05:09:16,439
But Peel Peel Peeling, thanks for five dollars again.

4747
05:09:16,439 --> 05:09:18,810
Boulder City here.

4748
05:09:18,810 --> 05:09:24,810
You'll become more native when you see a stream of quail run across the road.

4749
05:09:24,810 --> 05:09:38,150
A stream of quail run across the road.

4750
05:09:38,150 --> 05:09:48,240
You definitely should sub to that channel.

4751
05:09:48,240 --> 05:09:51,950
Quails are like ducks, right?

4752
05:09:51,950 --> 05:09:54,950
Quail is like a mix between a duck and a chickadee, am I correct?

4753
05:09:54,950 --> 05:10:07,130
Aren't they like little mini ducks?

4754
05:10:07,130 --> 05:10:15,029
Quail.

4755
05:10:15,029 --> 05:10:18,700
Quail.

4756
05:10:18,700 --> 05:10:19,700
Yeah, look at this weird bird.

4757
05:10:19,700 --> 05:10:21,700
It's like a duck chickadee thing.

4758
05:10:21,700 --> 05:10:29,080
It looks type in chickadee into Google.

4759
05:10:29,080 --> 05:10:32,080
You type in chickadee and you tell me that that's not a chickadee.

4760
05:10:32,080 --> 05:10:34,080
That's like a weird duck chickadee.

4761
05:10:34,080 --> 05:10:42,060
I'm sorry, guys, but that's a duck chickadee.

4762
05:10:42,060 --> 05:10:57,639
That's a that's a duckadee.

4763
05:10:57,639 --> 05:10:59,639
Thank you Peel Peel Peeling.

4764
05:10:59,639 --> 05:11:00,639
Watch out for those quails.

4765
05:11:00,639 --> 05:11:01,639
Thanks for the five dollars.

4766
05:11:01,639 --> 05:11:03,069
Clueless sniper.

4767
05:11:03,069 --> 05:11:04,069
Thanks for the one dollar.

4768
05:11:04,069 --> 05:11:05,069
No message.

4769
05:11:05,069 --> 05:11:06,759
Thank you.

4770
05:11:06,759 --> 05:11:07,759
Dr. Clay.

4771
05:11:07,759 --> 05:11:08,759
Thanks for the one dollar.

4772
05:11:08,759 --> 05:11:09,759
Thank you.

4773
05:11:09,759 --> 05:11:10,759
I was hoping you would literally duck in real life.

4774
05:11:10,759 --> 05:11:13,759
I was trying to make a time travel joke, but it failed.

4775
05:11:13,759 --> 05:11:14,759
Anyway, take care.

4776
05:11:14,759 --> 05:11:16,759
Thank you.

4777
05:11:16,759 --> 05:11:19,069
Maisie kit for the one dollar.

4778
05:11:19,069 --> 05:11:21,069
They say reasonable Frieza.

4779
05:11:21,069 --> 05:11:28,040
It's Frieza from Dragon Ball Z.

4780
05:11:28,040 --> 05:11:30,040
Set reasonable goals for yourself.

4781
05:11:30,040 --> 05:11:32,040
But remember, it's OK to take a break if you need it.

4782
05:11:32,040 --> 05:11:33,040
Wholesome Frieza.

4783
05:11:33,040 --> 05:11:35,040
Did he say this in the show?

4784
05:11:35,040 --> 05:11:39,139
I own a bookstore.

4785
05:11:39,139 --> 05:11:42,169
He did.

4786
05:11:42,169 --> 05:11:43,169
That's interesting.

4787
05:11:43,169 --> 05:11:44,169
I thought he was like evil.

4788
05:11:44,169 --> 05:11:47,139
Well, I guess.

4789
05:11:47,139 --> 05:11:48,139
Whatever.

4790
05:11:48,139 --> 05:11:50,080
OK.

4791
05:11:50,080 --> 05:11:51,080
KXZ 501.

4792
05:11:51,080 --> 05:11:55,349
Thanks for the ten dollars.

4793
05:11:55,349 --> 05:11:56,349
Thank you, KXZ.

4794
05:11:56,349 --> 05:12:00,159
Great watching you power through Hotline Miami.

4795
05:12:00,159 --> 05:12:02,159
Looked like a tough fight, but you did good, friend.

4796
05:12:02,159 --> 05:12:07,400
Plus, it'll be good training for Hotline Miami 2, so be ready for that.

4797
05:12:07,400 --> 05:12:08,770
Lol.

4798
05:12:08,770 --> 05:12:09,770
L-U-L.

4799
05:12:09,770 --> 05:12:18,520
I am looking forward to it and not looking forward to it at the same time.

4800
05:12:18,520 --> 05:12:23,619
It's going to be very interesting.

4801
05:12:23,619 --> 05:12:25,619
But really appreciate the ten dollars here, man.

4802
05:12:25,619 --> 05:12:27,819
Thank you.

4803
05:12:27,819 --> 05:12:28,819
Mr. Pigeon, thanks for the one dollar.

4804
05:12:28,819 --> 05:12:31,819
Hey, I hope the ball thing isn't getting to you.

4805
05:12:31,819 --> 05:12:35,119
For thirty, your hair is doing incredibly well.

4806
05:12:35,119 --> 05:12:37,119
I'm twenty, and it's happening to me.

4807
05:12:37,119 --> 05:12:42,319
You have an iron brain for not letting it get to you, bud.

4808
05:12:42,319 --> 05:12:43,319
No, it's alright.

4809
05:12:43,319 --> 05:12:45,319
Let me just fuck around on this channel.

4810
05:12:45,319 --> 05:12:46,319
Everyone's just having fun.

4811
05:12:46,319 --> 05:12:47,500
It's alright.

4812
05:12:47,500 --> 05:12:48,500
I know.

4813
05:12:48,500 --> 05:12:49,500
It's fine.

4814
05:12:49,500 --> 05:12:51,439
Don't worry.

4815
05:12:51,439 --> 05:12:56,720
It's all in good fun.

4816
05:12:56,720 --> 05:12:57,720
It is.

4817
05:12:57,720 --> 05:13:01,000
Doesn't bother me.

4818
05:13:01,000 --> 05:13:02,000
It's OK.

4819
05:13:02,000 --> 05:13:03,000
Hey, Flugboy, thanks for the one dollar.

4820
05:13:03,000 --> 05:13:04,000
Hey, Jerma, Eve's Flugboy here.

4821
05:13:04,000 --> 05:13:05,000
Hope you're doing well.

4822
05:13:05,000 --> 05:13:08,000
Finals are a thing this week, and I'm feeling the pain.

4823
05:13:08,000 --> 05:13:10,000
And I'm hoping my mental perk up after it...

4824
05:13:10,000 --> 05:13:15,000
I'm hoping my mental perk up after it just wanted to let you know how much your streams

4825
05:13:15,000 --> 05:13:16,000
make me happy.

4826
05:13:16,000 --> 05:13:17,880
Thank you.

4827
05:13:17,880 --> 05:13:18,880
Thank you, Eve's Flugboy.

4828
05:13:18,880 --> 05:13:22,529
Good luck with your finals.

4829
05:13:22,529 --> 05:13:23,529
It's a stressful time.

4830
05:13:23,529 --> 05:13:26,479
Just take it easy.

4831
05:13:26,479 --> 05:13:27,479
Do what you can.

4832
05:13:27,479 --> 05:13:33,490
Try not to drive yourself crazy, because I don't...

4833
05:13:33,490 --> 05:13:35,490
Let's talk about education, OK?

4834
05:13:35,490 --> 05:13:37,490
Can we talk about the education system?

4835
05:13:37,490 --> 05:13:38,490
Listen to this.

4836
05:13:38,490 --> 05:13:39,490
Let's hear me out.

4837
05:13:39,490 --> 05:13:40,490
Let's just...

4838
05:13:40,490 --> 05:13:41,490
Isn't this interesting?

4839
05:13:41,490 --> 05:13:44,240
Why do finals...

4840
05:13:44,240 --> 05:13:48,240
Why do they do them just all in the same fucking week?

4841
05:13:48,240 --> 05:13:50,240
Why wouldn't you...

4842
05:13:50,240 --> 05:13:52,240
You can't spread that out so...

4843
05:13:52,240 --> 05:14:01,299
Does it have to be seven major tests in a row that determine 25% of your whole

4844
05:14:01,299 --> 05:14:03,560
grade?

4845
05:14:03,560 --> 05:14:05,560
Why you can't have something happen?

4846
05:14:05,560 --> 05:14:12,880
There's no way to spread that out to make it easier for the students.

4847
05:14:12,880 --> 05:14:13,880
Some schools do it.

4848
05:14:13,880 --> 05:14:14,880
I don't know why.

4849
05:14:14,880 --> 05:14:15,880
I don't understand.

4850
05:14:15,880 --> 05:14:21,119
How would you make a schedule for that?

4851
05:14:21,119 --> 05:14:25,319
I don't know, but that's tough to do.

4852
05:14:25,319 --> 05:14:44,330
To make students do 20% of their grade four days in a row on every single class.

4853
05:14:44,330 --> 05:14:48,330
My final on Thursday is 65% of my grade, and what's up with that shit?

4854
05:14:48,330 --> 05:14:49,509
What?

4855
05:14:49,509 --> 05:14:52,959
No, that's not...

4856
05:14:52,959 --> 05:14:54,459
Why?

4857
05:14:54,459 --> 05:14:55,459
You know how many...

4858
05:14:55,459 --> 05:14:56,459
OK, listen.

4859
05:14:56,459 --> 05:15:02,200
You know how many people in the world don't test well?

4860
05:15:02,200 --> 05:15:05,200
You're intelligent, you're retaining information, but you don't test well.

4861
05:15:05,200 --> 05:15:06,889
That should...

4862
05:15:06,889 --> 05:15:07,889
Come on.

4863
05:15:07,889 --> 05:15:13,450
This has got to be more indicators of somebody's knowledge retention than one single

4864
05:15:13,450 --> 05:15:15,450
50% of your grade test.

4865
05:15:15,450 --> 05:15:27,229
People were not born to do tests.

4866
05:15:27,229 --> 05:15:28,229
I know.

4867
05:15:28,229 --> 05:15:29,229
What?

4868
05:15:29,229 --> 05:15:30,849
Why?

4869
05:15:30,849 --> 05:15:31,849
Give our students a little bit of slack.

4870
05:15:31,849 --> 05:15:36,610
I was there.

4871
05:15:36,610 --> 05:15:38,610
I remember that shit.

4872
05:15:38,610 --> 05:15:51,220
And not all college teachers care to teach.

4873
05:15:51,220 --> 05:15:52,220
No joke.

4874
05:15:52,220 --> 05:15:55,220
I had a bad teacher who was an hour late every class.

4875
05:15:55,220 --> 05:15:58,119
Is that for real?

4876
05:15:58,119 --> 05:16:07,169
Yeah.

4877
05:16:07,169 --> 05:16:09,049
I don't know.

4878
05:16:09,049 --> 05:16:16,849
It just seems a little odd to base your entire education around four days.

4879
05:16:16,849 --> 05:16:25,810
It's like, you did the lab work, you were there, you were in class every day.

4880
05:16:25,810 --> 05:16:26,810
Gosh darn it.

4881
05:16:26,810 --> 05:16:29,119
Give a little slack to our students.

4882
05:16:29,119 --> 05:16:35,840
Anywho, thank you to Butt Squire for the $1.

4883
05:16:35,840 --> 05:16:42,869
This is a game from a developer I've been following for ages by the name of CosmoD

4884
05:16:42,869 --> 05:16:47,869
called The Norwood Suite that I'd love to see you play on stream.

4885
05:16:47,869 --> 05:16:54,069
Cosmo's in a band called Archipelago with his friends and uses the band's music as

4886
05:16:54,069 --> 05:16:55,069
a soundtrack for his games.

4887
05:16:55,069 --> 05:16:56,069
It's super soothing.

4888
05:16:56,069 --> 05:16:59,069
I don't know how you feel about walking simulators, but you should definitely check

4889
05:16:59,069 --> 05:17:00,069
it out.

4890
05:17:00,069 --> 05:17:01,069
Here's a link to the trailer.

4891
05:17:01,069 --> 05:17:02,759
I will.

4892
05:17:02,759 --> 05:17:08,959
I will definitely watch the trailer and see if it's something that I'd be willing

4893
05:17:08,959 --> 05:17:09,959
to play.

4894
05:17:09,959 --> 05:17:13,509
For sure.

4895
05:17:13,509 --> 05:17:14,509
No you won't.

4896
05:17:14,509 --> 05:17:17,729
What do you mean no I won't?

4897
05:17:17,729 --> 05:17:19,740
No you won't.

4898
05:17:19,740 --> 05:17:20,740
I will watch this trailer.

4899
05:17:20,740 --> 05:17:23,450
He won't.

4900
05:17:23,450 --> 05:17:24,450
Oh my god.

4901
05:17:24,450 --> 05:17:25,450
He'll get back to you on that.

4902
05:17:25,450 --> 05:17:26,450
Come on.

4903
05:17:26,450 --> 05:17:27,450
Give me a little bit.

4904
05:17:27,450 --> 05:17:30,759
Give the streamers some slack, okay?

4905
05:17:30,759 --> 05:17:33,509
I just gave students slack.

4906
05:17:33,509 --> 05:17:35,509
Now I'll have the streamers slack.

4907
05:17:35,509 --> 05:17:45,939
He already forgot.

4908
05:17:45,939 --> 05:17:51,479
Uh, thank you butt Squire.

4909
05:17:51,479 --> 05:17:58,619
I will definitely take a watch and see if it's worth my streaming time.

4910
05:17:58,619 --> 05:17:59,619
Which it probably is.

4911
05:17:59,619 --> 05:18:02,880
I say it's worth my time.

4912
05:18:02,880 --> 05:18:04,880
What does that mean?

4913
05:18:04,880 --> 05:18:07,189
I say it's worth my time.

4914
05:18:07,189 --> 05:18:11,400
He won't.

4915
05:18:11,400 --> 05:18:12,400
Stop.

4916
05:18:12,400 --> 05:18:13,400
It is worth it.

4917
05:18:13,400 --> 05:18:14,400
It's probably a very good game.

4918
05:18:14,400 --> 05:18:20,599
He never watches it, italics told me.

4919
05:18:20,599 --> 05:18:21,599
That's not true.

4920
05:18:21,599 --> 05:18:26,400
Hey moo means moo, thanks for the one dollar.

4921
05:18:26,400 --> 05:18:30,400
I took your advice, grabbed a fish out of the local river and ate it raw and I still

4922
05:18:30,400 --> 05:18:31,400
failed.

4923
05:18:31,400 --> 05:18:33,599
Thanks a bunch.

4924
05:18:33,599 --> 05:18:35,599
Hey eating fish does not guarantee good grades.

4925
05:18:35,599 --> 05:18:42,209
Eating fish prepares you mind for knowledge retention and memory pulling.

4926
05:18:42,209 --> 05:18:43,639
Okay?

4927
05:18:43,639 --> 05:18:44,639
It's not a guarantee.

4928
05:18:44,639 --> 05:18:47,330
Hey eternal, whoa thanks for the one dollar.

4929
05:18:47,330 --> 05:18:51,330
Hey Jermbo, you ever planning on going back to picking oblivion back up or has

4930
05:18:51,330 --> 05:18:52,330
that ship sailed?

4931
05:18:52,330 --> 05:18:54,330
Love the streams, looking forward to 2019.

4932
05:18:54,330 --> 05:18:56,330
German 95 reboot season.

4933
05:18:56,330 --> 05:18:58,830
Now we don't do any reboots here.

4934
05:18:58,830 --> 05:19:02,349
Right now, no.

4935
05:19:02,349 --> 05:19:03,520
Unfortunately.

4936
05:19:03,520 --> 05:19:06,529
There's just too much to do.

4937
05:19:06,529 --> 05:19:11,279
There's so many things that are planned and so many things to play and do.

4938
05:19:11,279 --> 05:19:13,279
Going back to oblivion right now, I can't do it.

4939
05:19:13,279 --> 05:19:19,799
Maybe if I need to, okay what am I going to play today?

4940
05:19:19,799 --> 05:19:20,799
I don't know.

4941
05:19:20,799 --> 05:19:22,240
I mean I did that today.

4942
05:19:22,240 --> 05:19:28,369
But my brain functions on, I don't know, it might happen, it might happen tomorrow.

4943
05:19:28,369 --> 05:19:29,369
It might happen never.

4944
05:19:29,369 --> 05:19:31,369
It might happen in a couple weeks.

4945
05:19:31,369 --> 05:19:37,119
I base every stream off of what's happening today or the next day.

4946
05:19:37,119 --> 05:19:40,349
I'm very scattered.

4947
05:19:40,349 --> 05:19:45,979
Still won't stream ultimate.

4948
05:19:45,979 --> 05:19:49,369
I got scared to stream ultimate.

4949
05:19:49,369 --> 05:19:53,830
There were resident sleepers in the chat when I said I was going to stream.

4950
05:19:53,830 --> 05:19:56,000
I didn't even press the play button.

4951
05:19:56,000 --> 05:19:59,560
And it was like, I don't know, resident sleeper.

4952
05:19:59,560 --> 05:20:02,189
I was like, already?

4953
05:20:02,189 --> 05:20:06,159
That was just a joke.

4954
05:20:06,159 --> 05:20:09,610
Well there's no context with resident sleeper.

4955
05:20:09,610 --> 05:20:11,610
It's just resident sleeper.

4956
05:20:11,610 --> 05:20:16,389
Okay, there needs to be a Kappa sleeper.

4957
05:20:16,389 --> 05:20:19,200
Like, oh I'm just fucking around.

4958
05:20:19,200 --> 05:20:24,200
Like have Kappa with his head tilted with a Z coming out of his eye or something.

4959
05:20:24,200 --> 05:20:25,200
You know what I mean?

4960
05:20:25,200 --> 05:20:28,560
Like snoring.

4961
05:20:28,560 --> 05:20:29,560
Because then I would know.

4962
05:20:29,560 --> 05:20:30,560
Kappa sleeper.

4963
05:20:30,560 --> 05:20:31,560
Oh look it's boring but I'm just kidding.

4964
05:20:31,560 --> 05:20:32,560
It's not.

4965
05:20:32,560 --> 05:20:42,180
Go ahead.

4966
05:20:42,180 --> 05:20:43,180
Kappa sleeper.

4967
05:20:43,180 --> 05:20:46,209
I'll look into it.

4968
05:20:46,209 --> 05:20:48,220
We'll see.

4969
05:20:48,220 --> 05:20:49,220
Hey Ginzebo.

4970
05:20:49,220 --> 05:20:51,220
Thank you Ginzebo for the $10.

4971
05:20:51,220 --> 05:20:53,220
Kind of hard to catch your streams here in Sweden.

4972
05:20:53,220 --> 05:20:56,220
But here's for years of laughs and Chadwalks.

4973
05:20:56,220 --> 05:20:57,220
Cheers.

4974
05:20:59,549 --> 05:21:00,549
Thank you so much for the $10.

4975
05:21:00,549 --> 05:21:05,849
And I do have to apologize to people in the EU.

4976
05:21:05,849 --> 05:21:06,849
I'm really sorry.

4977
05:21:06,849 --> 05:21:11,279
I moved even further back in the United States.

4978
05:21:11,279 --> 05:21:17,279
So it's very difficult to try to please every time zone living in Pacific time.

4979
05:21:17,279 --> 05:21:21,610
For me to do that, but I mean it still would be hard.

4980
05:21:21,610 --> 05:21:24,610
Because if I start streaming at let's say 11 or 12, 11 a.m.

4981
05:21:26,430 --> 05:21:32,430
A bunch of North American audience now is I'm doing at work, I'm at school, I can't watch.

4982
05:21:32,430 --> 05:21:40,849
It's very difficult to try to pinpoint like a perfect time.

4983
05:21:40,849 --> 05:21:46,220
So I start my streams around 2 or 3 p.m. in the afternoon here.

4984
05:21:46,220 --> 05:21:52,599
Which is 6 o'clock Eastern, which is like 11 p.m.

4985
05:21:52,599 --> 05:21:55,900
11, 10, 11, 12 p.m.

4986
05:21:55,900 --> 05:21:56,900
I'm sorry.

4987
05:21:56,900 --> 05:22:01,900
I wish I could stream at 8 in the morning and be able to have everybody watch.

4988
05:22:01,900 --> 05:22:04,590
But it's just time zones.

4989
05:22:04,590 --> 05:22:12,650
But I did, I have pulled back.

4990
05:22:12,650 --> 05:22:18,020
We used to start consistently at 7 plus Eastern.

4991
05:22:18,020 --> 05:22:24,759
And since moving to Vegas, I've tried to pull that back an hour or so.

4992
05:22:24,759 --> 05:22:26,759
At least like an hour or two.

4993
05:22:26,759 --> 05:22:29,759
And tonight we started at 7.

4994
05:22:29,759 --> 05:22:41,799
We started at 7 yesterday, but we've been pretty consistent with starting at around 5 or 6 Eastern.

4995
05:22:41,799 --> 05:22:44,419
Just eat fish.

4996
05:22:44,419 --> 05:22:48,939
But thank you for the $10 and welcome from Sweden.

4997
05:22:48,939 --> 05:22:52,099
Thank you.

4998
05:22:52,099 --> 05:22:54,099
Emooch, thanks for the $2.

4999
05:22:54,099 --> 05:22:58,099
Pogchamp, hey Jerma, wish I could have been here for the whole stream, but it appears I missed it.

5000
05:22:58,099 --> 05:23:00,099
It's okay though, much love and when are you streaming again?

5001
05:23:00,099 --> 05:23:02,169
Tomorrow.

5002
05:23:02,169 --> 05:23:06,049
I'm gonna be playing EDF5 tomorrow with Star and Italics.

5003
05:23:06,049 --> 05:23:08,049
Hey Darkstar, thanks for the $1.

5004
05:23:08,049 --> 05:23:12,360
Let me get this straight, I should wake up, eat fish, or cheeseless macaroni?

5005
05:23:12,360 --> 05:23:18,360
Figure out how the hell to say parmesan, take the final, eat a filet-o-fish for dinner, and then have horrible diarrhea.

5006
05:23:18,360 --> 05:23:22,639
Thanks for the advice.

5007
05:23:22,639 --> 05:23:33,029
Is that what came out of my mouth?

5008
05:23:33,029 --> 05:23:35,029
Is that what you guys took from that?

5009
05:23:35,029 --> 05:23:41,619
No, I said don't eat filet-o-fish.

5010
05:23:41,619 --> 05:23:49,939
That was verbatim your advice.

5011
05:23:49,939 --> 05:23:52,819
I don't believe that.

5012
05:23:52,819 --> 05:23:55,380
I don't believe that.

5013
05:23:55,380 --> 05:23:58,450
But thank you Darkstar.

5014
05:23:58,450 --> 05:24:01,400
Thank you Mr. Pigeon for the $1.

5015
05:24:01,400 --> 05:24:06,520
Here's sausage, mushroom, and pepperoni.

5016
05:24:06,520 --> 05:24:09,400
Sausage and mushroom pizza.

5017
05:24:09,400 --> 05:24:11,400
I don't get it.

5018
05:24:13,700 --> 05:24:15,700
Sausage and mushroom pizza.

5019
05:24:15,700 --> 05:24:18,069
I don't get it.

5020
05:24:18,069 --> 05:24:20,069
Sausage and mushroom pizza.

5021
05:24:20,069 --> 05:24:22,560
Sausage and mushroom pizza.

5022
05:24:22,560 --> 05:24:37,799
Sausage and mushroom pizza.

5023
05:24:37,799 --> 05:24:39,799
Sausage and mushroom pizza.

5024
05:24:39,799 --> 05:24:41,799
Sausage and mushroom pizza.

5025
05:24:41,799 --> 05:24:45,799
This is what the person, that person was in here screaming that.

5026
05:24:45,799 --> 05:24:47,799
Was that the guy that made the video?

5027
05:24:47,799 --> 05:24:49,799
Was he in there saying that in this stream?

5028
05:24:49,799 --> 05:25:00,919
That's the video.

5029
05:25:00,919 --> 05:25:05,270
That says it was a million views.

5030
05:25:05,270 --> 05:25:07,270
Well thank you for that Mr. Pigeon.

5031
05:25:07,270 --> 05:25:09,270
Mu means moo, thanks for $1.

5032
05:25:09,270 --> 05:25:13,270
Guy Fieri bore like diarrhea.

5033
05:25:13,270 --> 05:25:19,159
I ate at his restaurant and I can't stop shitting.

5034
05:25:26,880 --> 05:25:28,880
That's the best joke of the night.

5035
05:25:28,880 --> 05:25:31,119
Without even a doubt in my mind.

5036
05:25:31,119 --> 05:25:39,439
Diarrhea.

5037
05:25:39,439 --> 05:25:41,439
No, my joke is good.

5038
05:25:41,439 --> 05:25:43,439
I know, but like come on.

5039
05:25:43,439 --> 05:25:47,990
Diarrhea.

5040
05:25:47,990 --> 05:25:49,990
You should put that on a bottom.

5041
05:25:49,990 --> 05:25:51,990
Put that on a top text, bottom text.

5042
05:25:51,990 --> 05:25:54,930
You just got on the front page of like every reddit.

5043
05:25:54,930 --> 05:26:04,659
Hey Smarky, thanks for the $1.

5044
05:26:04,659 --> 05:26:06,659
Hey Jerma, I dislocated my knee recently.

5045
05:26:06,659 --> 05:26:09,159
Sorry to hear that.

5046
05:26:09,159 --> 05:26:11,159
So I've been cooped up in my house.

5047
05:26:11,159 --> 05:26:13,159
Thankfully you've been here to keep me occupied in the meantime.

5048
05:26:13,159 --> 05:26:15,159
I'm really sorry to hear that.

5049
05:26:15,159 --> 05:26:17,830
That hurts.

5050
05:26:17,830 --> 05:26:20,840
Hope you recover swiftly.

5051
05:26:20,840 --> 05:26:22,840
Thanks for choosing this channel to hang out.

5052
05:26:22,840 --> 05:26:27,889
Thank you.

5053
05:26:27,889 --> 05:26:31,090
Maybe the top page of every reddit in 2012.

5054
05:26:31,090 --> 05:26:37,220
You'd be surprised.

5055
05:26:37,220 --> 05:26:39,220
Hey Extra Cheesy, thanks for the $1.

5056
05:26:39,220 --> 05:26:41,220
Here's another dollar because I wanted to balance my mean calculator moment.

5057
05:26:41,220 --> 05:26:43,650
Comment.

5058
05:26:43,650 --> 05:26:45,650
With this nice one by saying you're my favorite internet dude

5059
05:26:45,650 --> 05:26:47,650
and your funny hotline jump scare screams

5060
05:26:47,650 --> 05:26:49,650
make me go hee hee ha ha.

5061
05:26:49,650 --> 05:26:53,650
Also I'll bump you up to a T183.

5062
05:26:53,650 --> 05:26:55,650
You genius of a streamer.

5063
05:26:55,650 --> 05:27:01,599
Make me go hee hee ha ha.

5064
05:27:01,599 --> 05:27:04,790
Thank you Extra Cheesy.

5065
05:27:04,790 --> 05:27:07,540
Appreciate it.

5066
05:27:07,540 --> 05:27:09,540
It's time for slime, thanks for the $3.

5067
05:27:09,540 --> 05:27:11,540
You should re-release all your old videos with an audio track of you giving embarrassed commentary.

5068
05:27:11,540 --> 05:27:15,119
Reaction videos of my own videos.

5069
05:27:15,119 --> 05:27:17,119
Where I'm embarrassed of my previous...

5070
05:27:17,119 --> 05:27:19,119
I'm embarrassed of my children or something.

5071
05:27:19,119 --> 05:27:22,130
Like what does that even...

5072
05:27:22,130 --> 05:27:24,130
Like ah you know my son was gonna be a doctor.

5073
05:27:24,130 --> 05:27:26,130
Now he just screams swears on the internet.

5074
05:27:26,130 --> 05:27:34,069
He was supposed to be a lawyer.

5075
05:27:34,069 --> 05:27:38,159
Now that's my dad.

5076
05:27:38,159 --> 05:27:40,340
Whoops.

5077
05:27:40,340 --> 05:27:43,090
That's the boomer voice.

5078
05:27:43,090 --> 05:28:00,290
Are you still drinking coffee?

5079
05:28:00,290 --> 05:28:02,290
Fuck I am.

5080
05:28:02,290 --> 05:28:04,290
You're right. I need to stop doing that.

5081
05:28:04,290 --> 05:28:11,459
I drank the whole thing this whole time.

5082
05:28:11,459 --> 05:28:13,459
What does he do? He's a streamer.

5083
05:28:13,459 --> 05:28:15,459
What does he stream? Online co- no online media.

5084
05:28:15,459 --> 05:28:19,169
Now we've watched a couple of the

5085
05:28:19,169 --> 05:28:24,159
videos from before.

5086
05:28:24,159 --> 05:28:26,159
From years ago.

5087
05:28:26,159 --> 05:28:28,159
I love all of my video children.

5088
05:28:28,159 --> 05:28:31,680
Okay?

5089
05:28:31,680 --> 05:28:34,369
There was a reason why I made them, each one of them.

5090
05:28:34,369 --> 05:28:36,369
Except for the Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 ones.

5091
05:28:36,369 --> 05:28:39,319
I...

5092
05:28:39,319 --> 05:28:41,319
Those, I don't have those anymore.

5093
05:28:41,319 --> 05:28:51,360
And maybe another

5094
05:28:51,360 --> 05:28:53,360
40 or 50 different videos

5095
05:28:53,360 --> 05:28:55,360
that I may have removed because

5096
05:28:55,360 --> 05:28:58,439
I didn't think they were good at all.

5097
05:28:58,439 --> 05:29:00,439
Come on. I have...

5098
05:29:00,439 --> 05:29:05,119
I had like 975 children.

5099
05:29:05,119 --> 05:29:07,119
I am essentially like a beehive.

5100
05:29:07,119 --> 05:29:09,560
Okay?

5101
05:29:09,560 --> 05:29:11,560
I can't see and take care of all of my children.

5102
05:29:11,560 --> 05:29:22,759
Make 10 more.

5103
05:29:22,759 --> 05:29:24,759
Have 10 more. Bring them back.

5104
05:29:31,090 --> 05:29:33,459
Let us click.

5105
05:29:33,459 --> 05:29:35,459
No I'm not gonna let you click.

5106
05:29:35,459 --> 05:29:37,459
So you guys can put a

5107
05:29:37,459 --> 05:29:40,400
penile shaped apparatus on the screen.

5108
05:29:40,400 --> 05:29:42,840
No.

5109
05:29:42,840 --> 05:29:49,040
You lost privileges forever.

5110
05:29:49,040 --> 05:29:51,040
But thank you, it's time for slime for the three bucks.

5111
05:29:51,040 --> 05:29:53,040
Thank you lazy look for the one dollar, what's your voice line

5112
05:29:53,040 --> 05:29:55,040
when someone opens the germa game I'm making?

5113
05:29:55,040 --> 05:29:59,759
Uh...

5114
05:29:59,759 --> 05:30:04,360
Duh.

5115
05:30:04,360 --> 05:30:08,389
That's pretty good I think. I think that's good.

5116
05:30:08,389 --> 05:30:12,740
Or if you want like a good one, how about like

5117
05:30:12,740 --> 05:30:14,740
Welcome to the game! No, that's weirdly bad.

5118
05:30:14,740 --> 05:30:17,810
How about

5119
05:30:17,810 --> 05:30:19,810
No?

5120
05:30:19,810 --> 05:30:23,650
Strap yourself in!

5121
05:30:23,650 --> 05:30:27,360
How about

5122
05:30:27,360 --> 05:30:36,259
I hope you enjoy

5123
05:30:36,259 --> 05:30:38,950
playing my game.

5124
05:30:38,950 --> 05:30:41,759
But it's not my game because I didn't make it.

5125
05:30:41,759 --> 05:30:44,580
Somebody else didn't. I bet it's gonna be

5126
05:30:44,580 --> 05:30:53,540
real fun.

5127
05:30:53,540 --> 05:31:01,400
How about I got one for you.

5128
05:31:01,400 --> 05:31:03,400
You can do whatever you want with this so here you go.

5129
05:31:03,400 --> 05:31:11,650
Softwave Studios presents

5130
05:31:11,650 --> 05:31:16,200
You fucked it up with

5131
05:31:16,200 --> 05:31:18,200
the sub sound.

5132
05:31:18,200 --> 05:31:22,290
Whatever.

5133
05:31:22,290 --> 05:31:28,689
It's staying. Hey thank you

5134
05:31:28,689 --> 05:31:30,689
Shooshroom for the one dollar rats. Rats were the rats.

5135
05:31:30,689 --> 05:31:34,340
And lazy look thank you for the

5136
05:31:34,340 --> 05:31:36,340
another dollar here. By the way all your 2013

5137
05:31:36,340 --> 05:31:38,340
to 2014 YouTube videos are absolute

5138
05:31:38,340 --> 05:31:40,340
perfection. Seriously.

5139
05:31:40,340 --> 05:31:43,990
Thank you. I did have a lot of fun

5140
05:31:43,990 --> 05:31:47,000
making YouTube videos.

5141
05:31:47,000 --> 05:31:52,049
It was great. Mr. Dunwich

5142
05:31:52,049 --> 05:31:54,049
thanks for the one dollar. They say I have bad

5143
05:31:54,049 --> 05:31:56,479
news. What's the bad news?

5144
05:31:56,479 --> 05:32:04,680
Thank you flaming pizza for the one dollar.

5145
05:32:04,680 --> 05:32:06,979
How you doing today? Please know

5146
05:32:06,979 --> 05:32:08,979
you're loved and appreciated. Thank you

5147
05:32:08,979 --> 05:32:10,979
flaming pizza.

5148
05:32:16,979 --> 05:32:18,979
Don't be upset.

5149
05:32:18,979 --> 05:32:20,979
I'm sure the insurance will pay for it.

5150
05:32:20,979 --> 05:32:22,979
The company didn't take out insurance

5151
05:32:22,979 --> 05:32:24,979
this time. You're kidding.

5152
05:32:24,979 --> 05:32:26,979
No. But my

5153
05:32:26,979 --> 05:32:28,979
boss says he'll pay for it.

5154
05:32:28,979 --> 05:32:30,979
See? Everything will be alright.

5155
05:32:30,979 --> 05:32:32,979
But he'll probably never let me

5156
05:32:32,979 --> 05:32:34,979
work at an art show again.

5157
05:32:34,979 --> 05:32:36,979
Oh don't think so negatively.

5158
05:32:36,979 --> 05:32:39,220
I'm having

5159
05:32:39,220 --> 05:32:41,220
trouble trying to figure out if these

5160
05:32:41,220 --> 05:32:43,220
are actual people reading

5161
05:32:43,220 --> 05:32:45,220
a script or if they are bots.

5162
05:32:45,220 --> 05:32:47,220
Just really well trained bots.

5163
05:32:47,220 --> 05:32:49,220
What's wrong? I can't

5164
05:32:49,220 --> 05:32:51,220
tell. I really screwed

5165
05:32:51,220 --> 05:32:53,220
up at the office.

5166
05:32:53,220 --> 05:32:55,220
Oh. And I got fired.

5167
05:32:55,220 --> 05:32:57,220
That's too bad.

5168
05:32:57,220 --> 05:32:59,220
But it's not the end of the world.

5169
05:32:59,220 --> 05:33:01,220
No. Actually

5170
05:33:01,220 --> 05:33:03,220
Barbara and I broke up.

5171
05:33:03,220 --> 05:33:05,220
You are kidding.

5172
05:33:05,220 --> 05:33:07,220
And it is the end of the world.

5173
05:33:07,220 --> 05:33:09,220
Oh don't think so negatively.

5174
05:33:09,220 --> 05:33:12,360
What?

5175
05:33:12,360 --> 05:33:14,360
That went back and forth very very quickly.

5176
05:33:14,360 --> 05:33:18,709
Actually

5177
05:33:18,709 --> 05:33:20,709
Barbara and I broke up.

5178
05:33:20,709 --> 05:33:22,880
You are kidding.

5179
05:33:22,880 --> 05:33:25,060
Actually

5180
05:33:25,060 --> 05:33:27,060
Barbara and I broke up.

5181
05:33:27,060 --> 05:33:29,299
You are

5182
05:33:29,299 --> 05:33:31,299
kidding.

5183
05:33:31,299 --> 05:33:33,729
And it is the

5184
05:33:33,729 --> 05:33:38,400
end of the world.

5185
05:33:38,400 --> 05:33:40,400
Think so negatively.

5186
05:33:40,400 --> 05:33:44,439
I don't never get

5187
05:33:44,439 --> 05:33:49,880
sick of that. Thank you

5188
05:33:49,880 --> 05:33:52,369
Mr. Dunwich. Flaming Pizza

5189
05:33:52,369 --> 05:33:54,369
they said how are you? I'm doing well. Hope you're doing

5190
05:33:54,369 --> 05:33:56,610
well as well. I said well

5191
05:33:56,610 --> 05:33:58,610
like seven times.

5192
05:33:58,610 --> 05:34:00,610
Thanks for the one dollar. We should all watch Norwood's

5193
05:34:00,610 --> 05:34:02,610
sweet trailer together. Think of it as a bonding experience

5194
05:34:02,610 --> 05:34:04,610
with chat. Say do you like

5195
05:34:04,610 --> 05:34:09,479
pie? Cue it up.

5196
05:34:09,479 --> 05:34:11,479
It's Danny. Thank you. It's Danny for the

5197
05:34:11,479 --> 05:34:13,479
one dollar. Hey Jeremy will you ever consider playing Hotline Miami 2?

5198
05:34:13,479 --> 05:34:15,479
If so when? By the way great stream. Yes

5199
05:34:15,479 --> 05:34:17,479
playing Hotline Miami 2 next week.

5200
05:34:17,479 --> 05:34:20,040
Gonna try to do it all in one

5201
05:34:20,040 --> 05:34:22,209
stream but we probably won't.

5202
05:34:22,209 --> 05:34:24,209
I might have to break that up into two streams so I don't

5203
05:34:24,209 --> 05:34:26,389
lose my absolute mind.

5204
05:34:26,389 --> 05:34:28,389
Cause I could see myself getting exhausted

5205
05:34:28,389 --> 05:34:30,389
and getting very very sledgehammery.

5206
05:34:30,389 --> 05:34:32,389
You know what I mean?

5207
05:34:32,389 --> 05:34:34,630
You guys know what I'm talking about.

5208
05:34:34,630 --> 05:34:37,000
But thank you Danny.

5209
05:34:37,000 --> 05:34:39,240
Toby Laron

5210
05:34:39,240 --> 05:34:41,729
Ed. Thank you for the

5211
05:34:41,729 --> 05:34:43,729
one dollar. What a terrible fucking pronunciation

5212
05:34:43,729 --> 05:34:45,729
that just gave. Hey Jeremy do you have any

5213
05:34:45,729 --> 05:34:47,729
advice after a bad break up?

5214
05:34:47,729 --> 05:34:49,729
Not my first time but it always feels pretty bad after

5215
05:34:49,729 --> 05:34:51,729
it happens. Also love you streams really helps

5216
05:34:51,729 --> 05:34:54,799
every time when things are rough.

5217
05:34:54,799 --> 05:34:58,580
Honestly here's

5218
05:34:58,580 --> 05:35:00,580
the best thing that I could say.

5219
05:35:00,580 --> 05:35:02,580
If you're having romantic trouble

5220
05:35:02,580 --> 05:35:04,580
and you know it's a break up or

5221
05:35:04,580 --> 05:35:07,200
whatever right?

5222
05:35:07,200 --> 05:35:09,200
Eventually

5223
05:35:09,200 --> 05:35:11,200
eventually it's not gonna be

5224
05:35:11,200 --> 05:35:14,209
as bad. Eventually you'll move on.

5225
05:35:14,209 --> 05:35:16,450
It's just right now

5226
05:35:16,450 --> 05:35:18,630
right now it sucks.

5227
05:35:18,630 --> 05:35:20,630
And right now you're thinking this is fucking

5228
05:35:20,630 --> 05:35:22,630
the worst. This is the worst thing ever.

5229
05:35:22,630 --> 05:35:24,630
How am I ever gonna recover from this?

5230
05:35:24,630 --> 05:35:29,240
In a month or two

5231
05:35:29,240 --> 05:35:31,919
after like a couple of months

5232
05:35:31,919 --> 05:35:34,610
you'll just start to

5233
05:35:34,610 --> 05:35:38,520
you'll start to move away from it.

5234
05:35:38,520 --> 05:35:41,970
It takes time. And it's the worst because

5235
05:35:41,970 --> 05:35:43,970
right now everything fucking sucks.

5236
05:35:43,970 --> 05:35:46,659
Right now. But if you can reach

5237
05:35:46,659 --> 05:35:48,659
into the future to future you

5238
05:35:48,659 --> 05:35:50,959
you'll be able to see that

5239
05:35:50,959 --> 05:35:52,959
that future you will look back and be like hey man everything's

5240
05:35:52,959 --> 05:35:58,340
fine. Everything's fine.

5241
05:35:58,340 --> 05:36:02,439
Might take a little while. But the last time I

5242
05:36:02,439 --> 05:36:05,119
had like a real oh no

5243
05:36:05,119 --> 05:36:08,450
like romantic

5244
05:36:08,450 --> 05:36:10,450
problem or break up or anything it was

5245
05:36:10,450 --> 05:36:12,880
I wish like future me could have just

5246
05:36:12,880 --> 05:36:14,880
looked back and been like hey dude everything

5247
05:36:14,880 --> 05:36:16,880
everything is just fucking fine.

5248
05:36:16,880 --> 05:36:27,750
Just need to give it some time.

5249
05:36:27,750 --> 05:36:29,750
And let yourself grow you know?

5250
05:36:29,750 --> 05:36:31,750
Let yourself, let yourself grow.

5251
05:36:31,750 --> 05:36:34,240
You keep yourself in a box

5252
05:36:34,240 --> 05:36:36,240
and you keep thinking about this one thing that happened

5253
05:36:36,240 --> 05:36:40,639
you know

5254
05:36:40,639 --> 05:36:47,619
you'll look back and be like alright I'm good.

5255
05:36:47,619 --> 05:36:49,619
Let yourself grow more than 5'8".

5256
05:36:49,619 --> 05:36:53,459
That person's banned for life.

5257
05:36:53,459 --> 05:36:56,840
But take care of yourself

5258
05:36:56,840 --> 05:36:58,840
Toby. Thank you for the one

5259
05:36:58,840 --> 05:37:01,520
dollar. And hopefully you

5260
05:37:01,520 --> 05:37:08,099
feel better.

5261
05:37:08,099 --> 05:37:10,099
Take some me days.

5262
05:37:10,099 --> 05:37:19,939
By the way. Those are very important.

5263
05:37:19,939 --> 05:37:21,939
Hey thank you. Moo means moo for the one dollar.

5264
05:37:21,939 --> 05:37:25,139
And here it is.

5265
05:37:25,139 --> 05:37:27,139
Alright it's the Guy Fieri

5266
05:37:27,139 --> 05:37:29,700
more like

5267
05:37:29,700 --> 05:37:31,700
Diary Fieri.

5268
05:37:31,700 --> 05:37:34,900
Alright now get that

5269
05:37:34,900 --> 05:37:40,659
I'm telling you.

5270
05:37:40,659 --> 05:37:43,090
I'm telling you that's like a

5271
05:37:43,090 --> 05:37:45,090
4,000 upvote

5272
05:37:45,090 --> 05:37:48,020
image. It just is.

5273
05:37:48,020 --> 05:37:50,020
If I was scrolling through a subreddit

5274
05:37:50,020 --> 05:37:52,020
and I saw that image and I looked over to the right

5275
05:37:52,020 --> 05:37:54,020
and I saw how many upvotes it had

5276
05:37:54,020 --> 05:37:56,020
I'd be like I understand

5277
05:37:56,020 --> 05:38:00,689
it makes sense to me. I'm putting that on

5278
05:38:00,689 --> 05:38:02,689
a t-shirt. Well I hope you wear it in public.

5279
05:38:02,689 --> 05:38:06,209
Thank you. Thank you Cool

5280
05:38:06,209 --> 05:38:08,209
42 for the one dollar. I've been trying to farm

5281
05:38:08,209 --> 05:38:10,209
bits for the past month since the

5282
05:38:10,209 --> 05:38:12,209
Labo car stream but then I found

5283
05:38:12,209 --> 05:38:14,209
something that I needed to show you this

5284
05:38:14,209 --> 05:38:16,209
stream. So here it is.

5285
05:38:16,209 --> 05:38:18,209
I'm two more bits away from another hundred.

5286
05:38:18,209 --> 05:38:20,209
So I'll give those next stream.

5287
05:38:20,209 --> 05:38:22,959
Well thank you. Thank you for

5288
05:38:22,959 --> 05:38:25,270
bit farming for months.

5289
05:38:25,270 --> 05:38:29,810
And what you wanted to show me was

5290
05:38:50,180 --> 05:38:52,180
Why are we watching all these fucking old videos?

5291
05:38:52,180 --> 05:38:54,419
Hey by the way they like

5292
05:38:54,419 --> 05:38:56,419
deleted my entire

5293
05:38:56,419 --> 05:38:58,419
Modern Warfare Grandpa

5294
05:38:58,419 --> 05:39:00,419
series. It doesn't exist anymore.

5295
05:39:00,419 --> 05:39:02,419
I made like 15

5296
05:39:02,419 --> 05:39:04,419
to 20 videos and they're gone.

5297
05:39:04,419 --> 05:39:10,369
These used to be on Machinima Respawn

5298
05:39:10,369 --> 05:39:12,369
and they like took them off. I haven't

5299
05:39:12,369 --> 05:39:22,040
been able to find them.

5300
05:39:30,040 --> 05:39:32,040
An annotation.

5301
05:39:32,040 --> 05:39:34,040
An annotation on the whole screen.

5302
05:40:02,040 --> 05:40:04,040
Fuck.

5303
05:40:04,040 --> 05:40:06,599
Jeremy!

5304
05:40:06,599 --> 05:40:08,840
Jeremy come down here!

5305
05:40:08,840 --> 05:40:12,159
What?

5306
05:40:12,159 --> 05:40:14,159
How do I restart recordings?

5307
05:40:14,159 --> 05:40:16,159
I can't hear you. What?

5308
05:40:16,159 --> 05:40:18,159
How do I restart a recording?

5309
05:40:18,159 --> 05:40:20,159
What are you doing?

5310
05:40:20,159 --> 05:40:22,159
You're recording?

5311
05:40:22,159 --> 05:40:24,159
I just fucking told everybody I was going to give them six thousand dollars!

5312
05:40:24,159 --> 05:40:26,159
I don't have that kind of fucking money!

5313
05:40:26,159 --> 05:40:28,159
It's F9!

5314
05:40:28,159 --> 05:40:30,159
It's F9? Yeah.

5315
05:40:30,159 --> 05:40:32,159
Hey everybody

5316
05:40:32,159 --> 05:40:34,159
it's Jeremy's grandfather here

5317
05:40:34,159 --> 05:40:36,159
bringing you a first ever

5318
05:40:36,159 --> 05:40:38,159
Modern Warfare 3 gameplay

5319
05:40:38,159 --> 05:40:40,159
on his channel and I'm going to tell you

5320
05:40:40,159 --> 05:40:42,159
all the tips and all the strategies

5321
05:40:42,159 --> 05:40:44,159
on how to be the best player

5322
05:40:44,159 --> 05:40:46,159
in Planet Earth.

5323
05:40:46,159 --> 05:40:48,159
I'm pretty good at this game.

5324
05:40:48,159 --> 05:40:50,159
I'm not that good but I've been

5325
05:40:50,159 --> 05:40:52,159
people have told me that I'm pretty good.

5326
05:40:52,159 --> 05:40:54,159
So this gun is the

5327
05:40:54,159 --> 05:40:56,159
Scar L and the attachments on it

5328
05:40:56,159 --> 05:40:58,159
and you got to be the red dot sight

5329
05:40:58,159 --> 05:41:00,159
and it's got to have

5330
05:41:00,159 --> 05:41:02,159
a readerless recoil

5331
05:41:02,159 --> 05:41:04,159
I can't believe I've

5332
05:41:04,159 --> 05:41:06,159
I'm actually saying this though

5333
05:41:06,159 --> 05:41:08,159
and

5334
05:41:08,159 --> 05:41:10,159
I don't remember the third one

5335
05:41:10,159 --> 05:41:12,159
so I found that if you want to be

5336
05:41:12,159 --> 05:41:14,159
the lighter you want to throw all your

5337
05:41:14,159 --> 05:41:16,159
grenades out within the first

5338
05:41:16,159 --> 05:41:18,159
two seconds of the game and every time

5339
05:41:18,159 --> 05:41:20,159
you respawn because you don't

5340
05:41:20,159 --> 05:41:22,159
want to carry that extra fucking weight you know

5341
05:41:22,159 --> 05:41:24,159
that's just extra weight and if you happen

5342
05:41:24,159 --> 05:41:26,159
to hit somebody on your team with a flash

5343
05:41:26,159 --> 05:41:28,159
ping fuck them

5344
05:41:28,159 --> 05:41:30,159
that's not nice

5345
05:41:48,159 --> 05:41:50,159
oh there it is!

5346
05:41:50,159 --> 05:41:52,159
there's the diarrhea

5347
05:41:58,159 --> 05:42:00,159
wow

5348
05:42:22,400 --> 05:42:24,400
wow you are

5349
05:42:24,400 --> 05:42:26,400
old

5350
05:42:28,400 --> 05:42:30,400
I did not doctor this photo

5351
05:42:30,400 --> 05:42:32,400
so it looks like this for everybody

5352
05:42:32,400 --> 05:42:34,400
and if it doesn't look like this

5353
05:42:34,400 --> 05:42:36,400
then you have a computer

5354
05:42:36,400 --> 05:42:38,400
bug so I'll talk to you guys

5355
05:42:38,400 --> 05:42:40,400
later see you have fun

5356
05:42:40,400 --> 05:42:42,400
in the game you fuckers

5357
05:42:42,400 --> 05:42:48,869
that's a long time

5358
05:42:48,869 --> 05:42:53,919
ago that is

5359
05:42:53,919 --> 05:42:55,919
you want to know how long ago that was?

5360
05:42:55,919 --> 05:42:59,119
that was November 9th

5361
05:42:59,119 --> 05:43:01,119
2011

5362
05:43:01,119 --> 05:43:06,560
that was more than

5363
05:43:06,560 --> 05:43:13,919
seven years ago

5364
05:43:13,919 --> 05:43:15,919
that's ancient by internet standards

5365
05:43:15,919 --> 05:43:23,279
I wasn't even alive

5366
05:43:23,279 --> 05:43:27,000
seven years ago

5367
05:43:27,000 --> 05:43:29,000
some of those I really thought were

5368
05:43:29,000 --> 05:43:31,000
really really fun they were really fun to make

5369
05:43:31,000 --> 05:43:33,360
there's one where I was

5370
05:43:33,360 --> 05:43:35,360
editing a video

5371
05:43:35,360 --> 05:43:38,439
those of you that don't understand

5372
05:43:38,439 --> 05:43:40,439
this like I did a series on machinima

5373
05:43:40,439 --> 05:43:42,740
where cause call of duty

5374
05:43:42,740 --> 05:43:44,740
and like montages and people

5375
05:43:44,740 --> 05:43:46,740
spinning around in your headshot

5376
05:43:46,740 --> 05:43:48,740
and throwing tomahawks to cry

5377
05:43:48,740 --> 05:43:51,360
it was like the biggest videos on youtube

5378
05:43:51,360 --> 05:43:53,360
like large youtube stars

5379
05:43:53,360 --> 05:43:55,360
if you had like a call of duty montage

5380
05:43:55,360 --> 05:43:57,360
on your channel that was the biggest thing

5381
05:43:57,360 --> 05:43:59,990
on the whole website

5382
05:43:59,990 --> 05:44:06,580
so that's what these videos came from

5383
05:44:06,580 --> 05:44:08,580
and there was one in particular where I was making my own

5384
05:44:08,580 --> 05:44:10,580
montage as grandpa

5385
05:44:10,580 --> 05:44:12,819
and I pulled back

5386
05:44:12,819 --> 05:44:14,819
there was a huge premiere timeline

5387
05:44:14,819 --> 05:44:17,380
and I think that video has gone forever

5388
05:44:17,380 --> 05:44:27,360
but yeah that's

5389
05:44:27,360 --> 05:44:30,560
some history there

5390
05:44:30,560 --> 05:44:32,560
I made a lot of those videos

5391
05:44:32,560 --> 05:44:34,560
I made at least fifteen of them

5392
05:44:34,560 --> 05:44:36,560
private or removed I don't know what the hell they were doing

5393
05:44:36,560 --> 05:44:40,200
who knows

5394
05:44:40,200 --> 05:44:42,200
but we're at the end of the bits here

5395
05:44:42,200 --> 05:44:44,950
thank you cool 42

5396
05:44:44,950 --> 05:44:46,950
for the link to that video

5397
05:44:46,950 --> 05:44:48,950
that's the only one I think that's still on my channel

5398
05:44:48,950 --> 05:44:50,950
maybe one more floating around somewhere

5399
05:44:50,950 --> 05:44:52,950
critical corn thanks for the one dollar hey germ it's one of the

5400
05:44:52,950 --> 05:44:54,950
it's one of the georgia guys

5401
05:44:54,950 --> 05:44:56,950
from pax did you ever find

5402
05:44:56,950 --> 05:44:58,950
a way to crack open that pecan

5403
05:44:58,950 --> 05:45:00,950
and enjoy some of them

5404
05:45:00,950 --> 05:45:02,950
still loving the stuff and we both still love

5405
05:45:02,950 --> 05:45:04,950
everything you make and so it's

5406
05:45:04,950 --> 05:45:06,950
untypical of content creators

5407
05:45:06,950 --> 05:45:08,950
to keep making great content like you do

5408
05:45:08,950 --> 05:45:10,950
keep up the great work love you

5409
05:45:10,950 --> 05:45:12,950

5410
05:45:12,950 --> 05:45:17,090
I had no idea

5411
05:45:17,090 --> 05:45:19,090
just like nuts

5412
05:45:19,090 --> 05:45:21,090
they brought like food

5413
05:45:21,090 --> 05:45:26,520
they drove

5414
05:45:26,520 --> 05:45:31,700
are you ever gonna make more videos on the main channel

5415
05:45:31,700 --> 05:45:34,580
I don't know

5416
05:45:34,580 --> 05:45:37,590
I kinda got really jaded

5417
05:45:37,590 --> 05:45:39,959
after a couple of things that

5418
05:45:39,959 --> 05:45:41,959
I don't really even need to talk about

5419
05:45:41,959 --> 05:45:43,959
on stream

5420
05:45:43,959 --> 05:45:45,959
but kind of like the fall

5421
05:45:45,959 --> 05:45:47,959
of youtube in a sense

5422
05:45:47,959 --> 05:45:50,639
and how twitch was a more

5423
05:45:50,639 --> 05:45:52,639
it seemed like a more inviting

5424
05:45:52,639 --> 05:45:58,340
platform at the time

5425
05:45:58,340 --> 05:46:00,340
but there's a whole lot of other reasons that

5426
05:46:00,340 --> 05:46:02,340
there's so many

5427
05:46:02,340 --> 05:46:04,340
I could go we could sit here for

5428
05:46:04,340 --> 05:46:06,340
a couple hours and talk about why

5429
05:46:06,340 --> 05:46:08,709
I've essentially moved

5430
05:46:08,709 --> 05:46:10,709
completely away from making

5431
05:46:10,709 --> 05:46:13,400
youtube videos

5432
05:46:13,400 --> 05:46:16,790
and we could be here all day

5433
05:46:16,790 --> 05:46:18,790
but okay let's do it

5434
05:46:18,790 --> 05:46:22,950
oh no

5435
05:46:22,950 --> 05:46:24,950
but there was a chance there at some point

5436
05:46:24,950 --> 05:46:26,950
a couple years ago

5437
05:46:26,950 --> 05:46:30,020
where I wanted to start to do

5438
05:46:30,020 --> 05:46:32,259
productions and videos

5439
05:46:32,259 --> 05:46:34,259
and move sort of

5440
05:46:34,259 --> 05:46:36,259
split the channel in two different directions

5441
05:46:36,259 --> 05:46:38,259
have gaming stuff

5442
05:46:38,259 --> 05:46:40,259
and gameplay stuff

5443
05:46:40,259 --> 05:46:42,259
and gaming videos but then also do other

5444
05:46:42,259 --> 05:46:44,259
big kind of passion projects

5445
05:46:44,259 --> 05:46:47,520
that I've really always wanted to make for a long time

5446
05:46:47,520 --> 05:46:49,520
and it became very difficult to even

5447
05:46:49,520 --> 05:46:54,000
attempt that

5448
05:46:54,000 --> 05:46:56,000
I've told you guys this a million times

5449
05:46:56,000 --> 05:46:58,000
that I need to keep myself interested

5450
05:46:58,000 --> 05:47:00,950
and remember I've been doing

5451
05:47:00,950 --> 05:47:02,950
this for seven almost eight years

5452
05:47:02,950 --> 05:47:05,939
straight I've never

5453
05:47:05,939 --> 05:47:08,439
stopped you know there's never been a

5454
05:47:08,439 --> 05:47:10,439
time the only real honestly

5455
05:47:10,439 --> 05:47:12,439
this last October

5456
05:47:12,439 --> 05:47:14,680
was the only time that I was really away

5457
05:47:14,680 --> 05:47:16,680
from making a stream

5458
05:47:16,680 --> 05:47:18,680
or a video in probably eight years

5459
05:47:18,680 --> 05:47:22,639
I've never gone

5460
05:47:22,639 --> 05:47:24,639
more than a month or

5461
05:47:24,639 --> 05:47:26,639
three weeks or four weeks without kind of

5462
05:47:26,639 --> 05:47:40,209
doing something but I want to make sure that I stay

5463
05:47:40,209 --> 05:47:42,209
interested because I can't

5464
05:47:42,209 --> 05:47:44,389
do anything

5465
05:47:44,389 --> 05:47:46,389
unless I'm interested in what I'm

5466
05:47:46,389 --> 05:47:48,389
going to do I can't put on a face

5467
05:47:48,389 --> 05:47:50,389
I can't pretend

5468
05:47:50,389 --> 05:47:53,319
some people can I can't

5469
05:47:53,319 --> 05:48:00,229
I want to make sure that what I'm doing

5470
05:48:00,229 --> 05:48:04,389
is fun well the stream just kind of

5471
05:48:04,389 --> 05:48:08,360
ate shit there for a second but I want to make

5472
05:48:08,360 --> 05:48:10,360
sure the thing that I'm doing is I'm having fun

5473
05:48:10,360 --> 05:48:14,520
you didn't stream for almost a month when you moved

5474
05:48:14,520 --> 05:48:16,520
oh yeah but that's what I'm saying

5475
05:48:16,520 --> 05:48:18,520
besides this last October

5476
05:48:18,520 --> 05:48:20,520
which is what I meant by that

5477
05:48:20,520 --> 05:48:22,520
from this move

5478
05:48:22,520 --> 05:48:24,520
before moving to Vegas I

5479
05:48:24,520 --> 05:48:27,080
was you know I've been doing it for

5480
05:48:27,080 --> 05:48:30,470
eight years straight I've taken some

5481
05:48:30,470 --> 05:48:32,470
small breaks here and there like a week or two

5482
05:48:32,470 --> 05:48:35,669
okay whatever I've never

5483
05:48:35,669 --> 05:48:41,880
much longer than that the music is pitch

5484
05:48:41,880 --> 05:48:43,880
shifting in the background what

5485
05:48:43,880 --> 05:48:48,400
is it really that's weird

5486
05:48:48,400 --> 05:48:52,759
it's probably

5487
05:48:52,759 --> 05:48:55,700
because the internet is like kind of

5488
05:48:55,700 --> 05:48:58,069
coughing right now we're in a little

5489
05:48:58,069 --> 05:49:04,279
rough patch but yeah I

5490
05:49:04,279 --> 05:49:06,900
don't oh yeah YouTube bye

5491
05:49:06,900 --> 05:49:08,900
see you later I'm never going to make content

5492
05:49:08,900 --> 05:49:10,900
again on YouTube I don't know

5493
05:49:10,900 --> 05:49:13,909
I'm just going with what

5494
05:49:13,909 --> 05:49:15,909
I am my gut tells me

5495
05:49:15,909 --> 05:49:19,110
to do and it was I

5496
05:49:19,110 --> 05:49:21,110
feel like doing streaming because that's in that

5497
05:49:21,110 --> 05:49:23,110
interests me and I'm really really interested

5498
05:49:23,110 --> 05:49:28,549
in that I hope you guys stick around for the

5499
05:49:28,549 --> 05:49:30,549

05:49:50,159 --> 05:49:52,159
once I'm on twitch for as long as I've been

5506
05:49:52,159 --> 05:49:54,599
on YouTube things are will

5507
05:49:54,599 --> 05:49:56,599
probably start to get interesting for me because

5508
05:49:56,599 --> 05:49:58,599
then I have to figure out okay so is this

5509
05:49:58,599 --> 05:50:00,599

5510
05:50:00,599 --> 05:50:03,090

I don't know in another couple years I'm going to have

5515
05:50:12,229 --> 05:50:14,229
to kind of reevaluate where I am and what I'm doing

5516
05:50:14,229 --> 05:50:18,450
and what I what's next I

5517
05:50:18,450 --> 05:50:26,319

5611
05:55:37,360 --> 05:55:40,560
produced by online media

5612
05:55:40,560 --> 05:55:53,750

5620
05:56:35,599 --> 05:56:38,229
it looks neat and surreal

5621
05:56:38,229 --> 05:56:42,200
yeah it looks pretty cool

5622
05:56:42,200 --> 05:56:45,650

5623
05:56:45,650 --> 05:56:48,599

5627
05:56:55,479 --> 05:56:57,479

5628
05:56:57,479 --> 05:56:59,479

5633
05:57:10,630 --> 05:57:12,630
the credits are going to roll

5634
05:57:12,630 --> 05:57:14,630
while this plays in the background

5635
05:57:14,630 --> 05:57:23,330
rat movie

5636
05:57:23,330 --> 05:57:28,369
the original one

5637
05:57:28,369 --> 05:57:31,700
didn't we just watch this like

5638
05:57:31,700 --> 05:57:33,700
like not even a month ago

5639
05:57:33,700 --> 05:57:36,709
we actually watched this like

5640
05:57:36,709 --> 05:57:43,299
a month ago doesn't matter

5641
05:57:43,299 --> 05:57:47,520
alright here's no such thing as

5642
05:57:47,520 --> 05:57:49,520
the perfect writer this is why I use

5643
05:57:49,520 --> 05:57:51,520
grammarly to check my work

5644
05:57:51,520 --> 05:57:53,520
I just fucking

5645
05:57:53,520 --> 05:57:55,520
mash my hands on my keyboard

5646
05:57:55,520 --> 05:57:58,919

05:57:58,919 --> 05:58:03,459

5648
05:58:03,459 --> 05:58:05,459
youtube alright here we go

5649
05:58:05,459 --> 05:58:09,240
here come the subs

5650
05:58:09,240 --> 05:58:11,240
thank you everybody

5651
05:58:18,369 --> 05:58:20,369
that's the end of the movie

5652
05:58:20,369 --> 05:58:22,369
this is like

5653
05:58:22,369 --> 05:58:24,369
a

5654
05:58:33,569 --> 05:58:35,569
I don't remember it looks like this

5655
05:58:45,569 --> 05:58:47,569
this is like a gigantic patreon list

5656
05:58:47,569 --> 05:58:49,569
this video was made possible

5657
05:58:49,569 --> 05:58:51,569
by all these people which is

5658
05:58:51,569 --> 05:58:53,569
probably that's arguably true

5659
05:59:09,830 --> 05:59:13,279
I need to pick another one of these

5660
05:59:23,279 --> 05:59:25,279
this takes so long to make

5661
05:59:25,279 --> 05:59:27,279
the program is so old

5662
05:59:47,520 --> 05:59:49,520
this runs like shit

5663
05:59:51,520 --> 05:59:53,520
make it a community event

5664
05:59:57,520 --> 05:59:59,520
how would that work though

5665
06:00:01,520 --> 06:00:03,520
I mean I guess it could

5666
06:00:03,520 --> 06:00:05,520
okay no but that would be so hard

5667
06:00:05,520 --> 06:00:07,520
because I would say oh yeah

5668
06:00:07,520 --> 06:00:09,520
we'll just designate scenes to different

5669
06:00:09,520 --> 06:00:11,520
people but how do you designate that

5670
06:00:23,759 --> 06:00:25,759
live action remake

5671
06:00:27,759 --> 06:00:29,759
that's actually kind of a funny idea

5672
06:00:34,310 --> 06:00:43,880
that's cool yeah let me tell you

5673
06:00:43,880 --> 06:00:45,880

06:00:45,880 --> 06:00:47,880

5675
06:00:53,680 --> 06:00:55,680

5676
06:01:08,630 --> 06:01:10,630
