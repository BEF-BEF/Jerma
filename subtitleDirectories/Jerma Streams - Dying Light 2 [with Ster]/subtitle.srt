1
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,160
I'm sure you've tested it.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,759
Oh, you're the first thing they heard, was you loudly yelling.

3
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,109
Yeah, hi guys. We're not currently live yet. I mean, well, Ster is.

4
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:22,550
That was just weird. The moment you start watching me play PUE on your stream,

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,910
you're gonna drop down to like 1k viewers concurrent for the rest of your life.

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,229
Just funnel everybody to you and they never come back.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,240
No, they're just gone forever from both of us.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh, they just they just disappear.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,320
Yeah, they like see what's on the screen and go, why was I watching this guy?

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,240
So maybe like later, I can follow both channels.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,600
Yeah, and we can just go to Dying Light.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,759
All right, fine. All right. Well, you show me later.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,469
Yeah, we're gonna play Dying Light 2.

14
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:03,189
Or what would have been a more funnier title, Coffee Cheetos Chicken Remastered.

15
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,510
I didn't want to put that in the title though, because I don't want to.

16
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,430
The Zombie Jackasses 2.

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,019
Yeah. You know what's really funny about Coffee Cheetos Chicken?

18
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,620
That video's not even live.

19
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,620
That's an unlisted fucking video, yeah.

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,459
That is on your channel, it was a secret hidden video that you had.

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,430
I don't know how everybody found it and it became what it is.

22
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:33,879
It was a secret video. Did you eventually public it?

23
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,760
No, I did. I made a joke that I would and I never did.

24
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,030
Oh, that's funny.

25
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,909
I mean, it's unlisted, never made public.

26
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:48,390
It's about 200,000 views, which is like.

27
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,150
Which I mean, which is that's crazy for it being unlisted,

28
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,150
but in the grand scheme of things, how many people reference that exact video?

29
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,349
That's not very much.

30
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:00,390
Yeah, I would have thought it would have been more with how much it gets brought up.

31
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,810
All right, let's get in the game.

32
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,689
Do I just invite you?

33
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,969
Well, I'm not online yet. Are you online in Steam?

34
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,810
Are you like hiding like celebrities?

35
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:15,370
You know, I'm constantly offline, but I think I can invite you.

36
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,840
Let's see. Let's see, can I?

37
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,610
There's like a system where I can.

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,719
Uh, when you press escape, it's like F4 for friends menu.

39
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,599
Yeah, online link to the Epic Games store.

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,280
I'm not doing that.

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:45,030
OK, if I'm so I'm online right now, can I like, how do we like join a party?

42
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:53,590
Find games? No, wait, sort.

43
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,539
Is it can I sort by like friend or something?

44
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,620
I don't think so.

45
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,639
Yeah, we're early. We're a little early.

46
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, stirs been streaming for like an hour, but this stream is like 10 minutes early

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,759
because we're making sure we can get in the game.

48
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,819
That's what makes sense.

49
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,180
Let's pretend we're not here.

50
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,129
We're not here. The streams are offline right now.

51
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:22,490
Because I mean, I can open up friends, but I can't.

52
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,009
If I see your name here, I can't like do anything about it.

53
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,939
I mean, I just open up your profile.

54
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:31,659
My name is gas.

55
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,500
Oh, well, I'm adding you to favorites.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,699
No, it has you.

57
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:35,819
Oh, I guess I have you.

58
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,340
Yeah, I don't know.

59
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,219
I don't get it.

60
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,580
Yeah, I have no idea.

61
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,419
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

62
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:44,300
I'm sending you an invite.

63
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,580
Oh, how'd you do that?

64
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:49,099
I held down S to call for support.

65
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,800
And now wait, is your game private or is your game public?

66
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,400
I don't know.

67
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,159
Oh, you don't know your game is public.

68
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,439
You get this game is public.

69
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,800
We got to get out of here now.

70
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,449
I'm dropping out.

71
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,340
We're going to get we're going to get it.

72
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:08,900
Okay. Okay.

73
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,979
No, I changed. I changed it to private.

74
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:11,479
Okay.

75
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,500
Okay. I'm putting down the my mark in front of the boss.

76
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,779
You have to do the tutorial first.

77
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,819
We we've done that.

78
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:22,459
We're ready to go.

79
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,540
We just wanted to figure out how the multiplayer work.

80
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,180
It's not even two o'clock.

81
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,899
We're fine.

82
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:29,259
I sent you an invite.

83
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,500
Okay.

84
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,300
Accepted an invite.

85
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,649
Hey, I have a question.

86
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:38,970
I actually have like I'm deeply curious.

87
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,529
Hold on.

88
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,610
Because I got to show the actual stream.

89
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:43,290
I was already doing the wall.

90
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:44,569
Yeah.

91
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:44,889
All right.

92
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:45,610
Anyways, I got this.

93
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,329
Can you can you like talk a little bit to like make sure I get the audio levels?

94
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,680
Okay, I think I think it's good.

95
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,339
All right.

96
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,300
So what was your question?

97
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:02,860
Um, so whenever like you're like, oh, hey, like stern drummer are going to do a stream.

98
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,019
They come into my offline chat and they'll type exclamation point sus.

99
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,939
So I'm curious.

100
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:11,560
Like I, you know, me and you, we're going to know.

101
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,519
We know where that joke comes from.

102
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,319
But do people think now that that's like an Among Us reference?

103
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:15,480
Yeah.

104
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,279
Oh, yeah, they do.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,319
Okay.

106
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:17,959
That's sad.

107
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,079
That's very disappointing.

108
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,560
All right.

109
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,319
That that is an Among Us reference.

110
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,560
Well, we took to the old viewers.

111
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,290
No, they know nothing of Annalander.

112
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,250
I mean, that's a great game.

113
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,569
Have you ever played that game like on stream?

114
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,790
Uh, I think I played through the first two.

115
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,750
You really should.

116
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,269
I mean, you're going to hate it, but you're going to like probably love it at the same time.

117
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,829
You're going to love certain aspects of that game, but you're going to like,

118
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:47,269
I just told you I played the first two and you're telling me like I've never you're all you're going

119
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:47,509
to know.

120
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:48,550
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

121
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,029
There's a difference.

122
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:50,149
The first two are good.

123
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:54,550
The second, the third and the fourth are are very all over the place.

124
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,069
The fourth one is I would consider the worst of the of the four that you're going to hate it.

125
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:00,629
They're the worst.

126
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:01,589
You're going to hate it.

127
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:03,589
You're going to come to me and be like, why don't you tell me to play that?

128
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:04,790
Here's all the things wrong with it.

129
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,350
You're going to give me like a list of shit that's wrong with that game.

130
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,980
Are you ready for Dying Light 2?

131
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,779
I'm in the game.

132
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:13,139
All right.

133
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,420
So the story so far, we just jumped in.

134
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:20,100
We had to get the thing, the marker for our arm.

135
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,980
And does anybody really care?

136
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,220
Or do you just want us to go walk around and like, and hit each other with like,

137
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,019
I skipped every single possible cut.

138
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,860
I okay.

139
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,300
I kind of know what's going on.

140
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:32,860
Yeah.

141
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,939
So you meet this guy and you're running with him and he's like, yeah,

142
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:37,180
back before the place hit and you do all that stuff.

143
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,740
Wrong game.

144
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,540
Like, let's go.

145
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,939
You're like, you are the vaccine man because someone has to be a vaccine guy

146
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,259
or like experimental zombie.

147
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:45,899
And that's us.

148
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,379
And now we, uh, now we're going to do like parkour on zombies.

149
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:50,540
All right.

150
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,019
So we need to meet.

151
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,259
We need to meet the people of the, uh, of the Bazaar.

152
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:54,970
Yeah.

153
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,769
I talked to you first.

154
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,620
Anybody just talk to anybody.

155
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,620
I got, I got stuck on this quest.

156
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,500
You got stuck on this?

157
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:03,459
Yeah.

158
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:04,660
Did you not do this?

159
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,620
No, I once I was able to do, um, multiplayer.

160
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,100
I just left.

161
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:08,980
Okay.

162
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,740
Well, I came to a safe zone because I thought we'd have to be in a safe zone for me to invite

163
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:12,980
you.

164
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,420
And then it asked me to meet the people and I walked around and tried to talk to everyone

165
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,459
for like 15 minutes.

166
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,420
Okay.

167
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,519
Should I buy this?

168
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,959
I don't have any money.

169
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,639
Sell all valuables for $700.

170
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,199
Should I do that?

171
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,920
All right.

172
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,879
Well, I'm going to how to trade.

173
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,120
Okay.

174
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,069
You have to do the two quests.

175
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:35,579
All right.

176
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:36,620
So who do I talk to?

177
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,139
This is so loud for me.

178
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:38,860
I'm sorry, guys.

179
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,019
I know everybody like gets, everybody hates how quiet my like game audio is, but I have

180
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,620
to drop it because it's too loud for me.

181
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,529
All right.

182
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:52,170
So where are we going?

183
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,490
I think, I think we're going to do like a side quest or something.

184
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,490
Meet the people of the bizarre.

185
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,209
There's not, nobody here.

186
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:00,410
We have to talk to individually.

187
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,529
I talked to them.

188
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:02,810
I got a few side quests.

189
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,529
We can just like, let's just leave and like, you know, find our own way in this vast open

190
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:07,850
world.

191
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,769
I don't think we, dude, we can't leave until we talk to the right people.

192
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:14,329
One of the only way out.

193
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:15,610
Meet people in the bizarre.

194
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,129
What we can just leave.

195
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,329
The only way out is talk to us.

196
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:21,769
Oh, that's the quest name.

197
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:22,009
All right.

198
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:22,329
Let's go.

199
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:23,129
Funny stuff.

200
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:25,209
I can't, I can't hit you.

201
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:25,370
Yeah.

202
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,569
Because we're in like a safe zone.

203
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:27,449
You can't use weapons here.

204
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:29,050
So all right.

205
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,180
This is the front door.

206
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,629
We got something.

207
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:36,100
It's a main story.

208
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,610
Oh yeah.

209
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,409
That's the whole plot.

210
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:52,649
All you need to know is we're looking for a girlfriend.

211
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,360
We're looking.

212
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,600
Okay.

213
00:08:59,210 --> 00:08:59,529
Okay.

214
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,049
So we, we met that person.

215
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,549
Now let's go meet somebody else over here.

216
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:05,750
Let me, I'll tell you something.

217
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,379
You correct me from wrong history.

218
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,389
Is this game like in this game is very well optimized for me.

219
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:17,269
Like it runs at like a lightning fast, a hundred frames a second, no matter what.

220
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,110
Lightning fast.

221
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,070
Like I played Watch Dogs Legion and, and it was one of the worst experiences of my entire life.

222
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,789
If I alt tab, I can't click any of my other windows.

223
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,110
Is my experience like OBS.

224
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,909
I can't minimize or adjust in any way.

225
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:34,149
Yeah.

226
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:35,190
But the game looks great though.

227
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,750
Who paid you?

228
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,870
We got to go down.

229
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,269
Nobody.

230
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,620
Oh, we have to go in here.

231
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:41,860
All right.

232
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,059
So it does.

233
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:45,909
Oh, that's great.

234
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:47,590
Like I remember that first part when you're looking at the,

235
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,909
like all the trees and shit.

236
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:51,350
It was, it was blown away.

237
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,950
Game would be trash after all the delays and all those bad press it got.

238
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,190
Yeah.

239
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,669
I'm, I'm not going to say shit.

240
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:01,190
We usually talk shit about games.

241
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,750
That's what we do.

242
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,389
That's like our thing.

243
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,149
We have our little podcast that we do here once in a while.

244
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:07,110
And you're about to bet.

245
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,350
Okay.

246
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,230
But I'm about to get mad.

247
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,870
How the fuck do we just progress this?

248
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,899
I can like choose.

249
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,409
You have to do something.

250
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:17,690
Am I just like a guy that's here?

251
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,490
Like as your sidekick, like where I don't have like a quest marker.

252
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:20,809
Do you?

253
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,179
I think I can change our current question.

254
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:28,970
Well, so we have to meet in the bizarre.

255
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:37,139
Peacekeepers closed off the passage to the city center to get there.

256
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,779
Con and I had to find a way around the patrols.

257
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,139
Meet the people of the bizarre.

258
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:43,460
They're in front of us.

259
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,779
All right.

260
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:44,179
Hi.

261
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,059
How do we leave?

262
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:45,220
Yeah.

263
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,460
Okay.

264
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:45,860
Well, okay.

265
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,259
Cheers.

266
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:46,659
Let's go.

267
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,100
New quest.

268
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,059
What?

269
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:50,539
Cheers.

270
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:52,379
Find Marco the water supplier.

271
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,659
Oh, nice.

272
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,980
I want somebody to calm down.

273
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,220
All right.

274
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,100
I'm coming down.

275
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,620
You're looking for water chips.

276
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:58,860
All right.

277
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,259
Are we ready?

278
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,429
So, oh, now I got my bad.

279
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:07,830
Cool.

280
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,230
Don't even.

281
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,389
Oh, come on, man.

282
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,629
Don't it.

283
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,190
You're going to swing it.

284
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,669
You can hit me.

285
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:12,230
Friendly fire.

286
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:13,450
It's not.

287
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,090
It doesn't exist.

288
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:18,389
All right.

289
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,870
Where are we going?

290
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,980
You can't hit anybody.

291
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,220
Yeah.

292
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,419
I broke my weapon on him.

293
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,980
What is this?

294
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,460
Wait, he's not zombies.

295
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,259
Well, that was just a guy.

296
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:36,100
You got to clear them out.

297
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,379
It's just a person going through the trash.

298
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:40,899
Who does that?

299
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,779
You're all just going through the trash.

300
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,899
I don't think we're supposed to be doing this.

301
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,220
I'm from Austin.

302
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,100
That's what we do here.

303
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,039
What?

304
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,110
We got to go get the water chips.

305
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,710
Where is it?

306
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,840
Do you not have the objective markers?

307
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,240
Oh, I do.

308
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,720
Yeah, I do.

309
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,440
Why are you hurting innocent people?

310
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,080
What happened?

311
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,879
Wait, are these?

312
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,919
Can we talk to these people?

313
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,299
Oh, trying to talk after the opponent.

314
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,519
Wait, what's going on?

315
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:19,529
These are zombies here.

316
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,409
No, not that guy.

317
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,450
That's a normal guy.

318
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,009
It's a guy.

319
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:27,299
We are not supposed to be.

320
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:27,700
All right.

321
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,139
Don't stop hitting innocent people.

322
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,049
That guy ran away and said, who did that?

323
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,159
All right.

324
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,039
Let's focus here.

325
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,240
We need to focus on focus.

326
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,080
Turn off the health bars.

327
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,399
Hold on.

328
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:45,720
Hold up.

329
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,240
Don't don't don't.

330
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm going to get this unkindled.

331
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:56,019
I love how they added metal gear solid neck breaks to the zombies.

332
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:56,340
Watch out.

333
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,820
Watch out guy.

334
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,220
Come right in.

335
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:07,110
Honestly, they're like so like you feel bad.

336
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,860
You hold on.

337
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,539
You feel bad for the zombies that you're killing,

338
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:14,299
but not for like the regular innocent people

339
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:15,659
that you hit that were in the trash can.

340
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,659
They can defend themselves.

341
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:18,620
These zombies cannot.

342
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:23,909
All right, so we have to get.

343
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,750
Okay, let's go.

344
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,789
Okay, let's focus.

345
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:27,509
Focus.

346
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:28,950
Mark number one.

347
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,590
Follow me, runner.

348
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,070
All right, fine.

349
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,389
Let's go.

350
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,309
If you guys don't know, Dying Light 2 has some parkouring in it.

351
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:36,789
It's all about staying on the rooftop, staying away from danger.

352
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,210
I'm trying to find your way above a roof to roof.

353
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,730
You don't want to alert the horde.

354
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:44,970
That's a big problem in this game.

355
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,929
Got to be very careful.

356
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:50,629
It's actually pretty fluid experience so far.

357
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,070
Jumping from place to place.

358
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:55,539
But we're going to give it the real review here.

359
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,460
I'm not going to be like those other reviewers.

360
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,220
We're not going to be like those other people that you watch.

361
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,379
We're not going to go into real, real super detail.

362
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,029
Yeah, we're going to do some detailed talking about this game and what it means.

363
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,750
Yeah, why is this weapon broken?

364
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,389
My game is not suddenly when we're fighting things.

365
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:22,700
Wait, you can jump on.

366
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,100
Oh, wait, wait.

367
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,980
I remember this in the tutorial.

368
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,100
Ready?

369
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,269
That didn't do anything.

370
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,899
Ready?

371
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,080
I can do it.

372
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,879
You can do a drop kick.

373
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,200
Watch this.

374
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,399
Watch it.

375
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,200
What?

376
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,809
Is that you?

377
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:41,610
Oh, shit.

378
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,330
I thought that was you.

379
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:47,990
What's going on?

380
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,149
Why are we killing normal people?

381
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,669
I don't know.

382
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,370
Yeah, you're right.

383
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,610
In combat, my frames are dropping a little bit.

384
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,409
Not very much, though.

385
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:06,259
I heal up.

386
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,899
Can you guys play games normally, please?

387
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,820
What did we do abnormal so far?

388
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,019
We just killed a few people.

389
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:18,659
Wait, lockpicks.

390
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,659
Are you good at these?

391
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:24,779
I'm usually not that great at this.

392
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,179
How can you be bad at it?

393
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:28,659
You did it.

394
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:29,539
You're good.

395
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:30,899
You gotta have confidence.

396
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,179
I thought this said coffee sneakers,

397
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:32,899
and I was about to do it.

398
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:37,980
Do you get something in there, too?

399
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,779
Yeah, coffee sneakers.

400
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,059
You actually get this?

401
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:44,379
Yeah, yeah.

402
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,100
Do we share loot?

403
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,419
Okay.

404
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:45,980
Yeah.

405
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,220
Okay.

406
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,779
All right, cool.

407
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,340
So.

408
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:47,820
All right, cool.

409
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,059
Yeah.

410
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:48,779
Can you make the X?

411
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:56,710
That does not look like it would be safe at all.

412
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:59,509
It's one single spring mattress.

413
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:01,509
If you put a Tempur-Pedic down here,

414
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:03,110
it would still break all your bones.

415
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,470
This is bullshit.

416
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:06,070
You can't even break down.

417
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:10,710
I mean, I can, but not anymore.

418
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,230
Yeah, that's what I mean.

419
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,789
I seriously, why are you choking outside?

420
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,309
Wait, how did you flip it on me?

421
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:21,350
He started choking you.

422
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,480
He's like, get out of here.

423
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,360
I'll do that to you.

424
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,779
Probably didn't mash out.

425
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,779
Okay, dude, can you land on the bed of that truck?

426
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:35,590
Okay, I guess maybe.

427
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:38,940
Land on the bed of the truck.

428
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,490
Why?

429
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,009
Oh my God, that guy's coming up there.

430
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,049
That guy's so better than you.

431
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:46,840
They have bow and arrows.

432
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,399
They're throwing daggers or something.

433
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,679
They're ignoring the zombie.

434
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:54,059
Oh, what the fuck was that?

435
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:55,669
I got you.

436
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,940
It kind of worked.

437
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:01,419
I just got the guy's head off.

438
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:09,559
Make sure you're looking for, hit your gamer sense

439
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,559
because you need to craft stuff in this game.

440
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,910
It's a bit of a looter crafter.

441
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,029
It's kind of like Breath of the Wild.

442
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,109
Wait, he's fighting the zombie.

443
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:27,779
Oh, don't watch your stamina bar.

444
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:36,980
Why is the game so juicy?

445
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,380
It is really juicy, isn't it?

446
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,660
It's very like chunky.

447
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,940
A little bit creamy, a little bit.

448
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:44,809
Okay, so we keep going.

449
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:46,809
This is 200.

450
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:47,849
How far away is this?

451
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,319
Don't aggro the horde.

452
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,650
I'm not.

453
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,109
It's really creamy.

454
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:16,920
I'm turning it down again.

455
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,640
Our attacks.

456
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,559
Oh, that's right.

457
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,039
You have to dodge.

458
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:29,430
You hold the direction in space.

459
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,789
You'll do a Dark Souls dodge.

460
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,549
Yeah, I think you should.

461
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:43,029
We actually probably need to be looking for stuff

462
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,869
because look, I mean, like you go up in trash cans

463
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:46,230
and take scrap and stuff.

464
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,589
Why are we rushing through?

465
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:49,589
We've been waiting for this game for like seven years.

466
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:51,349
Have we?

467
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:53,589
You and I, we've talked about like, man,

468
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:56,309
that fucking dying light tunnel troll

469
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,829
and coffee and Cheetos and stuff.

470
00:18:57,829 --> 00:18:58,869
We've been waiting for this shit.

471
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,859
All right, well, let's take some time role play

472
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:05,660
and make sure we really engross ourselves

473
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,940
into the environment.

474
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,819
Remember the guy?

475
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:08,539
Oh, I got to get home.

476
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:09,099
I got to get home.

477
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:09,900
My mom's going to kill me.

478
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,660
Remember the guy outside that was running away?

479
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,619
He was like the big zombie guy

480
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:13,660
and he ran into the fence.

481
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:13,980
Remember?

482
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:21,190
All right, we need to craft those.

483
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,279
You actually don't remember.

484
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,880
That was like one of the funniest things

485
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,779
in any of the videos we ever made.

486
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,940
It was like this special super infected guy

487
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,660
and it was light out.

488
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,579
Oh, that fell into the fence.

489
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:38,099
He ran into the fence and died.

490
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:43,700
Just say it already.

491
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,299
No, I'm not just going to say it

492
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:46,740
because we're in the game's sequel.

493
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,220
We have to actually find the thing for me to say it.

494
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,559
Everybody's waiting.

495
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,819
We got to go save that guy over there.

496
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:01,579
That guy's looking like he's in a little bit of danger.

497
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:01,980
Which one?

498
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:05,019
Oh, yeah.

499
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:11,880
This guy's a zombie.

500
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,609
I feel like all these bandits are just getting along.

501
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:16,490
Oh shit, I'm going to die.

502
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:19,819
Yeah, we got to craft this.

503
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,400
This game looks like New Vegas.

504
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,799
Am I crouching?

505
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,380
What are you even doing?

506
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,380
Like everybody's just swinging melee weapons

507
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,259
at each other outside.

508
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,099
Yeah, it just feels like Mordhau.

509
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,049
All we need is to press like the E mode button and go.

510
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:13,140
And then get vote kicked out of the server.

511
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,170
Where are you?

512
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,730
I'm right here hitting the guy in the Mordhau.

513
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:24,170
Okay, so let's go.

514
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,529
Hey, let's go up.

515
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:26,490
We got to stay on the rooftop.

516
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,250
Let's kind of get a little bit of parkour.

517
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:29,369
Oh, you're right.

518
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:30,009
Hold on.

519
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:30,329
You're right.

520
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:31,529
We do have to stay on the rooftops.

521
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,259
Shit's too loud.

522
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,859
I know people are going to be mad at me for this,

523
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:36,339
but whatever.

524
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:37,059
It's too loud for me.

525
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,430
Is there actually somebody up there?

526
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,420
Wait, I thought there were zombies.

527
00:21:59,420 --> 00:21:59,900
I thought there was.

528
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,380
I didn't wait.

529
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:00,619
What?

530
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:03,740
I thought they were actually zombies.

531
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:07,269
I thought they were like monsters.

532
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:08,150
All right, we got to get out of here.

533
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,549
We got to leave.

534
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,470
We have to leave.

535
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,619
We have to get out of here.

536
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:16,579
That guy just walked off.

537
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:17,220
I didn't do that.

538
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,019
Where'd shit go?

539
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,460
Is he going to follow?

540
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:35,369
When do we get guns?

541
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:40,259
This is fun.

542
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:40,819
What is this?

543
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,259
We got to defeat that.

544
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,700
That guy's getting fucked up.

545
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,420
Get him.

546
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:44,980
Oh, go, go.

547
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,660
I just broke my leg.

548
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:50,259
He's running.

549
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:51,940
Why is he running?

550
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,180
I don't understand.

551
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,099
He just beat that guy up.

552
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:58,660
He's a thief.

553
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:04,140
Murder him.

554
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,700
Murder him.

555
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:07,029
You cut his head off.

556
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,950
Bandit caught.

557
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,630
Bandit decapitated.

558
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,869
What?

559
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,319
What do they have on him?

560
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:15,400
A little bit of street justice.

561
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,039
Oh, my God.

562
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,119
He had some...

563
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,599
You have collected a new collectible.

564
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,700
Every weapon I have is broken.

565
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,170
Are we not...

566
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:32,490
Okay.

567
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,210
Are we not supposed to be...

568
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,490
I have like a cane.

569
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,019
I don't think we're supposed to be

570
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,140
just whacking people with these.

571
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,940
I think we need them.

572
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:42,940
Need them for what?

573
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,259
I don't...

574
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,940
I mean, do you have any other weapons?

575
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,740
I don't.

576
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,599
I've got...

577
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,400
I think I got two.

578
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:51,690
I mean, we're still doing it.

579
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,450
I have like tiny Tim's cane.

580
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:56,170
You're like beating up a random zombie.

581
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,410
There's a guy in a ski mask waiting for me.

582
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:05,049
All right.

583
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:05,609
We need to...

584
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:06,490
I'm leaving.

585
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:06,970
I'm running away.

586
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,650
We're going to the quest marker

587
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,490
because we're going to break all of our weapons.

588
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,369
Okay, okay.

589
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:12,890
We got to go on the rooftops, Sharma.

590
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,250
This is a little bit of a parkour game.

591
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:14,730
Oh, that's right.

592
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:14,970
That's right.

593
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,369
That's right.

594
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:17,289
It's parkour kind of experience.

595
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:22,839
I know the route.

596
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,559
Come on, pow down.

597
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,440
Did you make an arcane reference?

598
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:34,569
It's what's hip.

599
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:35,529
You got to stay relevant.

600
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:40,740
I only know that because I saw the first two episodes.

601
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,509
And you didn't watch the rest?

602
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:47,529
I mean, I probably will eventually.

603
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,049
I always watch like one episode of TV

604
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:49,930
and then never watch it again.

605
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,539
This game is so crunchy.

606
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,089
Why would he die?

607
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,589
Okay. League of Legends Andy.

608
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:14,789
I'm not the one that made the reference.

609
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:15,509
He did.

610
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:21,460
Oh, you're talking about a lot.

611
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:21,700
All right.

612
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,539
But look, before we go any further.

613
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,700
I need to make it really clear.

614
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,740
You're running.

615
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,400
I'm right here.

616
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,950
When a game has really beautiful trees,

617
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,869
that's usually an indicator

618
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:36,950
that it's going to run at like 15 frames a second.

619
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,829
Is that wrong or not?

620
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,220
I guess that's a fair assessment.

621
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,460
Every time I've ever played a game

622
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:49,259
where it was like, look at how detailed our environment is.

623
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:50,619
We have these big lush trees

624
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:52,140
with all kinds of particle effects.

625
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,299
It runs at like 12 frames a second.

626
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:55,579
And you have to turn all that shit down

627
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,369
and get it to even run.

628
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:00,839
This came out of the box running at like 60 for me.

629
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,339
We have to give credit where it's due.

630
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:05,819
I have to.

631
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:08,650
Okay.

632
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,289
And look at this.

633
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,039
This is beautiful.

634
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,279
You got a 30-90, 30-90 moment.

635
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,599
Yeah, the glowing sea.

636
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:17,400
You don't want to go through there.

637
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,319
Ster, what do you have for a graphics card?

638
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,240
280 Ti.

639
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:24,200
And you're running at pretty much like 60, right?

640
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,130
I have issues.

641
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:32,569
Generally speaking, I've got some issues.

642
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:33,930
In general?

643
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:34,730
Nothing to do with the game.

644
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,640
The game, I mean, we've got to give credit

645
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,680
where credit's due, apparently.

646
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,359
I am dead serious.

647
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:43,319
I am so sick and fucking goddamn tired

648
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,880
of games coming out that are AAA games

649
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,799
that are, whoa, look at how beautiful.

650
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,400
And they run like shit and they crash

651
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,240
and they don't even work.

652
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,319
This is like unheard of to me.

653
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,759
When was the last time you played a game

654
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:57,109
that came out in current year?

655
00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:01,049
Watch Dogs Legion.

656
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:05,180
Okay, then yeah, what you're saying is valid.

657
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,500
Any major AAA game I played in the last two, three years

658
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,420
always kind of ran like dog shit, always.

659
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,009
This game could suck.

660
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:12,329
I don't know.

661
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:13,130
We have no idea.

662
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,049
Oh, wait, what's this?

663
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,670
We're going in the wrong direction.

664
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,710
I got to turn you up a little bit.

665
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:28,470
We're going the wrong direction?

666
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,430
Yeah, we got to go this way.

667
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,789
Watch out, there's heads.

668
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:33,900
Okay, so there's special gear.

669
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:40,970
All right, so we got, oh, climb up stuff.

670
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,619
What about Resident Evil 8?

671
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:48,180
Yeah, Resident Evil 8 was all right, too.

672
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,619
But was that like 70 FOV?

673
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:54,019
I ran out of, I need help.

674
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:55,940
Help, you need help me?

675
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,119
Why do I have no stamina?

676
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:04,279
I have to take your inhibitor.

677
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,859
Do I actually have to do that?

678
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:12,069
Oh, no, I got it.

679
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:18,089
I think we're going to get in the building.

680
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:19,529
Okay, very cool.

681
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:20,089
Up top, maybe?

682
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:20,890
Watch out, they're climbing.

683
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:21,690
We got climbers.

684
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,500
There's a book over there.

685
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,980
Dad here.

686
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:35,740
He's running.

687
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:37,740
He doesn't want anything to do with this.

688
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:38,869
What?

689
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:39,750
Nobody can do that.

690
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:50,900
He was so scared.

691
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,700
That's kind of crunchy.

692
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,539
This game's really creepy.

693
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,019
I feel like when we're interacting with NPCs,

694
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:00,019
I feel like we're seeing two different things happening.

695
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:03,619
That guy walked off the pole for me.

696
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:06,660
Yeah, he teleported to the pole for me and then fell off.

697
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,420
Oh, he ran across and then fell.

698
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,380
Watch out, we're inside the quest area.

699
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:14,299
He's just a five percent.

700
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:15,660
We have five minutes to do this, by the way,

701
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,700
so actually don't mess around.

702
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,059
Wait, what?

703
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:18,539
Why?

704
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:19,339
I don't know, it's timed.

705
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:24,329
Okay, we start picking up stuff.

706
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,849
We're going to be so underleveled by the time

707
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,609
we get to like the end game in the next few hours.

708
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,609
We're not getting past like level two at this rate.

709
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:35,509
Oh, wait, there's more stuff in here.

710
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,950
Do you see the secret like mine shaft?

711
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:45,259
I have like a mine shaft over here.

712
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:46,809
Let's go.

713
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,569
This is one of the hollows.

714
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,630
Be careful down here.

715
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,349
We slide?

716
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:52,549
I'm losing stamina.

717
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:53,190
How do you slide?

718
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,660
Is this going to hurt?

719
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:57,500
Oh, shit, be careful.

720
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,500
There's a dude.

721
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:05,779
Wait, quest?

722
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:07,539
All players required.

723
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,420
We're doing a heist.

724
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,140
We're doing a heist.

725
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,420
All right, just let him talk for a second

726
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,460
until we even know what he's doing here.

727
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:11,960
Great.

728
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:17,619
Another just what I need between thieves and infected.

729
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:18,900
I'll be out of business soon.

730
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,380
All right, we're good.

731
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,460
I'm here.

732
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,019
You just do it.

733
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:25,140
It's your you're the host.

734
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,059
My god.

735
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:34,730
Okay.

736
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,769
Secure the building.

737
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:38,650
Find Hans the hunter before he drinks the poisoned water.

738
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,150
Wait, we have to stop somebody from drinking water.

739
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:46,359
Okay.

740
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,259
That's quite the quest.

741
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:48,740
You know what?

742
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,619
Wait, as a streamer, I'm morally opposed to this.

743
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:52,900
You need to stay hydrated.

744
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,960
Okay, so where are they?

745
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:01,559
You know what's funny about games like this, though?

746
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,559
Okay, so take a look at your perspective.

747
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:04,200
Like come over here.

748
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,039
This is a hiding spot, right?

749
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,099
Yeah.

750
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,259
I'm hiding right now.

751
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:13,779
This is the equivalent of like a three year old.

752
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:17,349
Where'd you go?

753
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:18,069
Oh, I see.

754
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:18,569
That's funny.

755
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:21,740
Okay.

756
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,619
Okay, ready?

757
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:23,579
I'm going to go do the thing.

758
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:24,700
I'm going to go into the corner here

759
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,220
and I'm going to count to 10

760
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,660
and you be the three year old

761
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,819
and find the best hiding spot in the room.

762
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:30,319
Okay?

763
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:31,019
Okay.

764
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:32,380
And we're going to do that routine.

765
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,339
Okay.

766
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:33,980
All right, you ready?

767
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,619
Okay, here we go.

768
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:44,900
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

769
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,539
Here I come.

770
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,460
And you got to start like this.

771
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,619
Okay, it's always the okay.

772
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,250
Wonder where they are.

773
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:56,390
Where did he go?

774
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,099
Not under there.

775
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:02,220
Oh, I don't know.

776
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:05,029
I have no idea where they are.

777
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,589
Did they fit in here?

778
00:32:07,589 --> 00:32:08,789
Oh, no way.

779
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,220
Okay.

780
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,779
I found you.

781
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:15,500
And then you have to go.

782
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,069
Okay.

783
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:22,150
And then we have to do it again.

784
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:22,630
Here we go.

785
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,349
Ready?

786
00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:24,329
Here we go.

787
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:25,849
Why do we have to do it again?

788
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:33,849
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

789
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,089
Here I come.

790
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:37,930
Okay.

791
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,980
No, you're supposed to be in the same spot.

792
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,420
The exact same spot.

793
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:45,980
You did it wrong.

794
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,059
I didn't know that was a joke.

795
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,019
No, that's dangerous.

796
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:49,660
Get out of there.

797
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:51,769
That's dangerous.

798
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,210
That's in the drywall.

799
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,089
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

800
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:54,970
Come out, come out, come out, come out.

801
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,769
Oh, my God.

802
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:56,250
This is bad.

803
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,740
Mom, mom, mom.

804
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,400
Tim went in the drywall.

805
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,359
I don't know where the fuck they went.

806
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,079
Mom, I'm serious.

807
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:03,559
Zombies.

808
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:05,819
Help.

809
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:07,019
We got to go find them.

810
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,079
All right, let's go.

811
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:09,880
Help, I'm lost.

812
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,039
No, don't run in here.

813
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:15,299
Why does that door not work?

814
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,660
It doesn't work.

815
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,990
That's a that's a bait door.

816
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:23,849
All right, do the thing.

817
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:25,539
What thing?

818
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:27,460
Okay, if you stagger them.

819
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,059
You can't do it with the zombies.

820
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,180
You can't carry a zombie.

821
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,059
Yes, again.

822
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:31,859
I just did it.

823
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:36,579
Okay, I did it.

824
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,920
It's a lot harder.

825
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:47,079
It's just chivalry.

826
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,279
I'm not going to be able to get over that

827
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:50,119
the whole time we're playing, by the way.

828
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,160
It's just chivalry.

829
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:57,619
Watch out.

830
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,420
We got Zs.

831
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,380
No, we can open this.

832
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:01,220
Well, that we got to leave.

833
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,339
That's like leaving now.

834
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:04,069
I think that's giving up.

835
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:04,549
Are you sure?

836
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:06,549
You got to grab my call.

837
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:07,430
I'm collecting things.

838
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,389
I found a Molotov.

839
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:08,789
Oh, my God.

840
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:09,429
There's a lot of stuff here.

841
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:09,829
You're right.

842
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,460
I found a common bottle.

843
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:16,099
A brick.

844
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:19,289
My opportunity.

845
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:19,929
Wait, what?

846
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,809
Use of friendly fire.

847
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:29,139
This game got a full letter grade lowered.

848
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,179
How do I use the brick?

849
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,860
I'm a child.

850
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,139
You can craft options.

851
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,219
Lock it in friendly fire off.

852
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,739
Hey, go turn friendly fire off.

853
00:34:45,269 --> 00:34:46,070
How are we going to do?

854
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,510
How are we going to do any like funny jokes?

855
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,010
It's done.

856
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:53,929
Was this it?

857
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,849
I think we just have to.

858
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:57,130
I think that was securing the building.

859
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:57,769
What we just did.

860
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:00,090
Parts for Carlos and his groundbreaking fence.

861
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:02,599
Hope he's still waiting at the bazaar.

862
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,519
Oh, I had the bottle in my hand.

863
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,320
Hayden.

864
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,519
How's it been, kid?

865
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:06,840
We're good.

866
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,199
The taste for city life.

867
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,320
I've been here and there.

868
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,519
You know, the best part is always happening in the center.

869
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,039
And that's where we're going.

870
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:14,599
I think we just leave.

871
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,679
Yeah, because we secured the building.

872
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,960
I'll tell you everything on the spot.

873
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,239
Meet me on the roof near the main metro station.

874
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,000
There's a time limit.

875
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,920
Yeah, we only have three more minutes to leave the building.

876
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,320
No help.

877
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,880
Oh, shit.

878
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:38,010
Don't skip this.

879
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,210
I feel like something interesting is going to happen.

880
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:42,500
I thought we were leaving.

881
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,380
Oh, OK.

882
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:44,940
You're safe.

883
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:48,139
Now, what's the story with the water?

884
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:48,300
Yeah.

885
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,579
Who did we stop from drinking?

886
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,750
I don't know him.

887
00:35:59,239 --> 00:35:59,639
OK.

888
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,679
My head just hurt from that.

889
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,119
I thought that that was something wrong with the game.

890
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,360
Got to be a fucking criminal.

891
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,519
Or pretty damn fucked up to drag your ass

892
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,960
a hundreds of miles through a world of violence.

893
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,440
I feel like you're pressing right arrow key on a YouTube video.

894
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,500
Fucked up in a good way, of course.

895
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,019
So what about the water?

896
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,079
There ain't nothing wrong with my water.

897
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,360
The man at the bazaar was poisoned.

898
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,199
You'll be blamed if he dies.

899
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:21,880
All right.

900
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,480
Dammit.

901
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:23,880
OK.

902
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,800
It was an accident.

903
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:26,940
OK?

904
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,280
An accident.

905
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,079
It's because of these goddamn thieves.

906
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:32,219
Right.

907
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,519
They're always stealing my water.

908
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,079
Where is he?

909
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,119
I can't take it anymore.

910
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,239
So hold on.

911
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,599
I decided to set the trap.

912
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,239
Hold on.

913
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,039
Dude, you do.

914
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,309
I'll tell him the truth.

915
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:44,789
I won't.

916
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,030
I won't.

917
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,989
Wait, is he mad at us?

918
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,030
Yeah.

919
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,530
Wait.

920
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:51,269
What happened?

921
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:53,030
We missed really important context.

922
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,690
Dude, even if your stamina goes to zero, don't stop.

923
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,969
Don't stop left clicking.

924
00:36:58,969 --> 00:36:59,610
Double team him.

925
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,420
With zero stamina, it doesn't matter.

926
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,619
Don't fucking stop left clicking.

927
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:09,210
I have no weapon.

928
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,210
So punch him.

929
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:23,800
I'm swinging at him.

930
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,889
But now his head comes off.

931
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:30,489
He had flour on him.

932
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,409
I knew he was up to something.

933
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,639
We killed this guy for a bag of flour.

934
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,159
He's baking cookies with poisoned water.

935
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,469
Didn't even use milk.

936
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,800
This is going to be a fun game.

937
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,150
OK.

938
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,590
So I mean, do we own this place now?

939
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,030
The world is ours for the taking.

940
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,909
15% off.

941
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,659
Oh, never mind.

942
00:37:58,659 --> 00:37:59,460
I was like, what is this?

943
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:01,369
Catch.

944
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,130
You threw that from your ankle.

945
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,849
You underhanded that to me.

946
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,179
Night has fallen and your immunity will go down.

947
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,099
Oh, that's right.

948
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,460
We have to go into the light.

949
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,260
We have to be careful.

950
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,059
Otherwise, we turn.

951
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,679
We can leave the room now.

952
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,320
I think.

953
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,719
Well, yeah.

954
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,239
Can we wait for night to...

955
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,269
Do we sleep?

956
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:38,230
Maybe we should sleep.

957
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:38,730
Yeah.

958
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,269
Is there a bed down here?

959
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:42,070
Or should we go up to...

960
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:44,070
Yeah.

961
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,920
Oh, that's really important.

962
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,960
Yes, we're infected.

963
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
And we are slowly turning throughout the course of the game.

964
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,760
That was something you missed in the first, like, 10 minute cutscene.

965
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,400
Sorry about that.

966
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:57,800
I feel like if there was a bed, there would be one down there.

967
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:00,039
You have to craft the...

968
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,360
You guys are making things up.

969
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,760
They make...

970
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,400
Wait, what are they saying?

971
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:06,199
What is...

972
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,400
I got hurt, but...

973
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,119
It's all imaginary.

974
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,239
Yeah, there's nothing up here.

975
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:13,880
There's no bed?

976
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:18,329
I thought there was a bed.

977
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:19,449
Usually there's like the...

978
00:39:19,449 --> 00:39:20,570
Yeah, it's right here, right?

979
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,070
No?

980
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:31,130
I mean, we can leave, but we have to be really careful.

981
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:31,449
OK.

982
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:32,170
I mean, let's go.

983
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,659
I swear to God there was a bed here.

984
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,840
You don't want to be on the ground.

985
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,730
I mean it.

986
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,409
During nighttime, you actually don't want to be on the ground.

987
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:43,610
That was in the tutorial.

988
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,050
What did I get?

989
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,159
I got something.

990
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,519
He's not in the same room, though.

991
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,400
So I can't do it.

992
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,440
What are you doing?

993
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,320
I went back downstairs to go through the door.

994
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,920
Why did I just get sucked over here?

995
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,960
Oh, because I sucked you.

996
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,690
I'm in control.

997
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,650
We're not supposed to be on the floor.

998
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,530
This is my game.

999
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,409
Let's go on the floor.

1000
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:05,849
We're not supposed to be on the floor.

1001
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:06,250
Climb.

1002
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:06,969
You gotta climb.

1003
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:08,329
Right on the street side.

1004
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:09,369
That's very impressive.

1005
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,210
Watch out, we got Zeds.

1006
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:15,929
Wait, somebody's yelling.

1007
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:18,699
Yeah, the zombies.

1008
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:18,940
No, no, no.

1009
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,820
There's a guy in that building.

1010
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,099
Somebody right there.

1011
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:22,539
66 meters away.

1012
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:22,940
Let's do it.

1013
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,659
Isn't it kind of rude to look in someone else's windows?

1014
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:30,420
This is like an office building.

1015
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,190
Yeah, it's still kind of weird.

1016
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,510
Right here.

1017
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:34,920
Do you see him?

1018
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,719
You need binoculars, though.

1019
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:36,280
What is it?

1020
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,480
Where?

1021
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,719
Somebody's hurt on that roof.

1022
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:40,360
Oh, he's hurt.

1023
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,760
He's hurt.

1024
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,239
Let's go help him.

1025
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,849
Over here.

1026
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:46,730
I'm going the other way.

1027
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:51,059
Oh, there's a special infected over here.

1028
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:51,619
No, don't go that way.

1029
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:52,019
Go this way.

1030
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,719
Watch out.

1031
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,360
We got biters.

1032
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,230
Oh, my God.

1033
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:02,710
It moves.

1034
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:04,789
Careful, careful, careful.

1035
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,329
All right.

1036
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:08,889
What are we going to do?

1037
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:10,969
Immunity booster.

1038
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,250
Or a shroom booster.

1039
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:12,969
Or a shroom.

1040
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,280
I think I have shrooms.

1041
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,920
Do you have shrooms?

1042
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:21,179
Oh, nice.

1043
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,860
Do we get a point for that?

1044
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:26,550
You idiot.

1045
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:30,630
We already got the experience.

1046
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:37,739
Okay, I'm going to put a point.

1047
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:39,099
Okay, I got a parkour.

1048
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:40,699
What are you going to put your parkour point in?

1049
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,219
I'm going to put my parkour point into.

1050
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,929
I like firm grip.

1051
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:52,409
Actually, no, I'm getting a firm grip first.

1052
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,369
Well, I don't have a point.

1053
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:55,300
You don't?

1054
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,099
No, I didn't get one.

1055
00:41:56,659 --> 00:41:58,579
I probably ran through too much of the tutorial.

1056
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,659
Oh, easy.

1057
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:02,469
Easy with that.

1058
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:07,369
I'm just holding on to it for, you know, we get some zeds following us.

1059
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:07,690
Okay.

1060
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:11,050
Some zombies, some biters, some walkers, some crawlers.

1061
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,929
I think we're going to turn in like three minutes.

1062
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:15,420
What are we going to do?

1063
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:15,739
I don't know.

1064
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:17,260
We have to find a safe house.

1065
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,380
Oh, this way.

1066
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,900
Yeah, number one.

1067
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,940
We have to go to number one.

1068
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,900
Okay, let's go number one.

1069
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:25,849
Oh, my God.

1070
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:26,489
I fucked it up.

1071
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:27,610
I'm fine.

1072
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,619
Are you trying to throw that at me?

1073
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:32,820
I couldn't jump with it.

1074
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,420
Oh, now I got a parkour skill point.

1075
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,860
Now I'm a firm gripper.

1076
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,900
I just I don't want to.

1077
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,659
I really don't want to like alarm you or anything,

1078
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,739
but we really only have, I think, three minutes before we die.

1079
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,510
Wait, question mark.

1080
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,969
Somebody screaming down there.

1081
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:51,190
Downstairs, we're going to go.

1082
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,809
Ow.

1083
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,480
Where'd you go?

1084
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:57,980
I went down.

1085
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,940
The other side of the building.

1086
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,420
It's down.

1087
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,099
Whatever it is, it's down like in the building.

1088
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:09,349
Your immunity is low.

1089
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:10,469
Use shrooms.

1090
00:43:10,469 --> 00:43:11,449
Oh, shit.

1091
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,139
Oh, yeah.

1092
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:14,940
We get over there room.

1093
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:16,300
How do you shroom?

1094
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,460
Mine's on my heel button.

1095
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,340
How do we get in there?

1096
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,179
We can see there's UV light in that direction.

1097
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:34,019
We can go there is we can't get in there.

1098
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:34,340
All right.

1099
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,780
We have to actually get back up top.

1100
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,619
We're going to get killed as a screamer.

1101
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:37,860
Don't.

1102
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,260
Oh, my God.

1103
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:38,980
You're going to get us killed.

1104
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:41,860
Don't alert the screamer.

1105
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,219
I've been such a bitch.

1106
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:46,039
It's tough.

1107
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:51,239
I don't know where to go from here.

1108
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:53,989
What did you do?

1109
00:43:53,989 --> 00:43:56,789
I jumped on the air conditioner.

1110
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:57,030
OK.

1111
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,909
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1112
00:43:57,909 --> 00:43:58,389
Gas can.

1113
00:43:59,110 --> 00:43:59,590
Let's go.

1114
00:44:00,949 --> 00:44:02,230
180 meters.

1115
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,190
Immunity is low.

1116
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,900
What is shrooms on like the mini bar?

1117
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:09,349
Mine is H.

1118
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:11,829
I have no healing.

1119
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:16,059
Oh, shit.

1120
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:17,659
There's an inhibitor container nearby.

1121
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:18,699
We're critical right now.

1122
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:19,980
We're absolutely critical.

1123
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:28,199
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

1124
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,119
Why can't I grab this?

1125
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:32,840
This is bad.

1126
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:35,159
It changed my marker.

1127
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,440
We have to go.

1128
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,000
We have 49 seconds to touch this UV thing over here.

1129
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:40,980
This way.

1130
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,380
Follow me.

1131
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:47,940
Oh, my God.

1132
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:51,659
You're falling behind, kid.

1133
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:55,300
Hey, I'm dead.

1134
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:00,659
Did you make it?

1135
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:01,460
Yeah.

1136
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,059
Can you come help me?

1137
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,670
I'm going to have lunch with these guys.

1138
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:09,369
I'm dead.

1139
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:13,349
What happens?

1140
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:14,550
Are you actually dead?

1141
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:14,949
Yeah.

1142
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:18,489
I'm going to respawn.

1143
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:19,829
I could.

1144
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:22,550
It gives me the option to teleport you to me still.

1145
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,980
Oh, can you do that?

1146
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,860
Wait, actually, don't do that.

1147
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:29,139
You're here.

1148
00:45:29,139 --> 00:45:29,539
I'm here.

1149
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,460
Oh, OK.

1150
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:32,699
Cool.

1151
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,059
I don't know how to switch to my healing item.

1152
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:37,659
It's still on shrooms for me.

1153
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:39,159
All right.

1154
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:43,579
We should probably make some weapons.

1155
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:44,380
UV bar.

1156
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,940
Oh, that's kind of cool.

1157
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,659
Two.

1158
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:49,780
Ah, hold two.

1159
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:52,949
So I don't have any money.

1160
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:54,969
Hold two.

1161
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:58,090
Grade, scissors, craft parts.

1162
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:58,489
All right.

1163
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:59,289
I should.

1164
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:03,380
Weapon mods, goods, fire arrows.

1165
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:09,860
I wonder weapon mod grip.

1166
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,699
Come back and I'll top you off real good.

1167
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,929
I don't know what I should sell.

1168
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:16,389
What's going on here?

1169
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:16,869
Hello.

1170
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:17,670
I'm Henkel.

1171
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:21,429
This student here was curious about my lesson today.

1172
00:46:21,429 --> 00:46:22,550
It's a noisy chair.

1173
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,949
Not when the guns were confiscated in villages.

1174
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:25,510
You hear all that?

1175
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:26,389
He wants.

1176
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:28,230
Yeah, I'm in a cut scene.

1177
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:28,789
Are you?

1178
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:29,909
Yeah.

1179
00:46:29,909 --> 00:46:31,429
Oh, well.

1180
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:32,550
No one touch it.

1181
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:34,789
Henkel's got a problem.

1182
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:37,050
History lesson, side quest.

1183
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:38,489
Hold T to track.

1184
00:46:38,489 --> 00:46:39,050
I'm tracking it.

1185
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:39,769
We're doing it.

1186
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:40,570
He's important.

1187
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,369
Reach the memorial.

1188
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:41,929
Oh, hey.

1189
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:42,809
OK, dude, it's two.

1190
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:44,730
Yeah, hold two.

1191
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:46,969
It's two to cycle through things on your minimap.

1192
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:47,610
Yeah, really?

1193
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:49,369
Are you serious?

1194
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:50,980
Well, you already knew that?

1195
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:54,010
This isn't a bit.

1196
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:02,900
Accessories.

1197
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:06,980
Make sure you have lock picks and stuff, man.

1198
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,340
I mean, I'm geared.

1199
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,380
I'm in the UV light.

1200
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,539
OK, inventory.

1201
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:14,440
Decoy, Molotov, throwing knives.

1202
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:14,679
All right.

1203
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:16,039
I have UV shrooms now.

1204
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:18,489
Can you craft UV shrooms?

1205
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:20,090
Oh, no.

1206
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:24,070
OK.

1207
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:24,949
How do you cycle through?

1208
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:25,429
There we go.

1209
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,989
I got my Molotovs.

1210
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:28,789
Three, I'm assuming is.

1211
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:29,670
How do you cycle weapon?

1212
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:35,820
One, two, three, four.

1213
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,900
You just completely tuned him out like it was your job.

1214
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:41,690
It's still nighttime, though.

1215
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:42,409
We have to go sleep.

1216
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:45,510
I think I don't care.

1217
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,349
Like, I'm a challenge.

1218
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:48,710
Like, I want to move in stealth.

1219
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:49,670
You know what I'm saying?

1220
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:50,469
Like, the moon's out.

1221
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:51,269
We can still see.

1222
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,820
You remember in dying light?

1223
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,460
Actually, it was so dark you couldn't see like more than a foot.

1224
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,980
Let's pull your binoculars and start marking shit.

1225
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:00,539
OK, there we go.

1226
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:01,900
Discover the old lumber mill.

1227
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:07,289
You definitely cannot see through those.

1228
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:08,650
Those are way too wide for your head.

1229
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:10,949
What do we got up here?

1230
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:12,969
Look for things to mark.

1231
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,880
I have them all already.

1232
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,400
I always went out there.

1233
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:17,639
Yep.

1234
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:19,480
See?

1235
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,199
All right.

1236
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:22,280
So I think we just have to choose which way we're going to go.

1237
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,199
Well, no, I'm doing the Reach the Memorial Squared mission

1238
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:27,880
that this guy just gave us.

1239
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,440
OK.

1240
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,760
Are you ready?

1241
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,159
Yeah.

1242
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:33,900
Let's move.

1243
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,460
Yeah.

1244
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:38,059
You're all crafted up.

1245
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:38,619
All right.

1246
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:39,900
You think you can make this jump powder?

1247
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,320
I did, but for some reason I felt...

1248
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:46,599
Excuse me?

1249
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:49,239
That's classic power.

1250
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:49,559
No, no, no.

1251
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,079
But like, honestly, excuse me.

1252
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:52,039
What happened?

1253
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:54,260
Why did I die?

1254
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,300
What happened to me?

1255
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,619
I got you.

1256
00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:57,099
It's fine.

1257
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:59,340
You're not fast like the others.

1258
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,449
There's a zombie right behind you.

1259
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:03,050
Why did I delay my death?

1260
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:03,690
That was weird.

1261
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:06,579
What the...

1262
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,539
Weird's going on.

1263
00:49:09,539 --> 00:49:10,500
I'm telling you.

1264
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,619
I tried to climb up and I couldn't.

1265
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:18,969
OK, are we climbing back up?

1266
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:19,849
Let's climb back up.

1267
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:20,090
Yeah.

1268
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:28,469
I can't stand on this guy.

1269
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:28,949
Come on.

1270
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,289
OK, from here we can go this way.

1271
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:33,449
Yep.

1272
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:38,730
Are we going to...

1273
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:39,849
We got a little hovel here.

1274
00:49:40,489 --> 00:49:42,119
I wonder what's inside.

1275
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,300
Do you want to explore it?

1276
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,340
Yeah.

1277
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,300
I'm looking to explore it.

1278
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,340
Let's go.

1279
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:51,480
It looks like we're both having the same problem

1280
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,519
of how do you just go down.

1281
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:56,760
The whole tutorial, I was like, what button lets go?

1282
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,250
Use your gamma resets.

1283
00:50:00,889 --> 00:50:02,329
This is one of those pre-war buildings

1284
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:03,769
with four floors and no rooms.

1285
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:07,989
Nothing down here.

1286
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,280
Run to the ground floor again.

1287
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:14,840
Oh, wait.

1288
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,400
I can open this.

1289
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:19,429
Oh, yeah.

1290
00:50:19,429 --> 00:50:20,469
We get guns in the police car.

1291
00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:20,710
All right.

1292
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:21,829
I got your back.

1293
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:22,630
A couple of heads coming.

1294
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:24,949
Watch my back.

1295
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:27,900
Oh, dude.

1296
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,460
ASUS Republic of Gamers.

1297
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,099
What?

1298
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:37,320
There's a hallow over here.

1299
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,320
Up here.

1300
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,099
Why did my...

1301
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:52,340
OK.

1302
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:55,900
Why did my stamina just drop to zero?

1303
00:50:56,539 --> 00:50:57,340
What did I do wrong?

1304
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:57,820
What happened?

1305
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,650
My stamina bar was at like 60 percent

1306
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,530
and it just went to zero.

1307
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,590
Lion power.

1308
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,940
Stop saying that.

1309
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:07,380
Why?

1310
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,099
Because I watched the show.

1311
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:23,579
If you saw two episodes, it's all you need to know.

1312
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:24,780
So from here, where do you want to...

1313
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,179
This way?

1314
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,460
Half of our UV, our life is gone.

1315
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:28,860
I know.

1316
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,219
We're not supposed to be doing what we're doing.

1317
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,860
OK.

1318
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:34,900
We're supposed to have been sleeping.

1319
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,659
This is where we started.

1320
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:36,980
What?

1321
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,059
No, it is not.

1322
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:41,460
No, it's not.

1323
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:41,780
What?

1324
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,340
No way.

1325
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,539
No way.

1326
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:46,059
This is impossible.

1327
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,980
It's impossible.

1328
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,260
How is it impossible?

1329
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,139
They don't have a bed.

1330
00:51:50,139 --> 00:51:50,619
Where can we...

1331
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:51,659
How do we skip time?

1332
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:56,630
I can't believe it.

1333
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:57,750
I can't believe it, man.

1334
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,309
I really can't.

1335
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:00,500
How did we do that?

1336
00:52:01,059 --> 00:52:03,539
OK.

1337
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:06,329
We need to find...

1338
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:06,650
OK.

1339
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:09,559
I'm taking the reins.

1340
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:10,039
All right.

1341
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:10,599
You're my leader.

1342
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:11,480
What do I do?

1343
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,199
Mark on your map the bed over here.

1344
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:17,449
The bed over here.

1345
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:20,570
The green bed that's over here in the middle.

1346
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,130
If you hit...

1347
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:22,980
Go to your map.

1348
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,329
Mark this.

1349
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:25,130
The green bed.

1350
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:27,130
No, we're going to do the history lesson.

1351
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:27,449
Shut up.

1352
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:27,849
I'm going.

1353
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:28,570
I'm taking the reins.

1354
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:29,050
We're not...

1355
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:29,530
I'm telling you.

1356
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:33,210
The game has told us over and over again not to play the game when it's nighttime.

1357
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,570
I'm taking the reins right now.

1358
00:52:44,019 --> 00:52:44,659
Can you keep up?

1359
00:52:45,219 --> 00:52:46,070
I think so.

1360
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,659
I'll look at this.

1361
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,269
We actually can open this, can we?

1362
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:52,389
No.

1363
00:52:52,949 --> 00:52:53,190
What?

1364
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,199
Bait quest box.

1365
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:56,840
You see down there?

1366
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,559
Do you see the marker?

1367
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:00,900
That's where we're going.

1368
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,500
Don't play this game at 3 a.m.

1369
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,659
No, don't.

1370
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:09,030
That's not something we can mark.

1371
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,920
There's a lot of zombies down there.

1372
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:12,760
Oh, what's the plan?

1373
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,559
Electrical station.

1374
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:15,619
All right, the plan is we're going to go...

1375
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:19,369
Well, we have to go that way.

1376
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:20,250
So should we jump on the X?

1377
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,460
Yeah.

1378
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,260
All right, you go first.

1379
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:25,500
All right.

1380
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,780
I'm going to show you how a pro does it.

1381
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:32,840
I went way too far.

1382
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,239
I'm fine.

1383
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:36,309
That's a howler.

1384
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:37,030
We got to go.

1385
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:37,909
We do actually have to go.

1386
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:40,619
Come on, powder.

1387
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,679
You got this.

1388
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:49,719
You're going to keep doing that.

1389
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:03,380
We got UV light and everything.

1390
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:03,940
There's a howler now.

1391
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,579
And there's a howler.

1392
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:07,239
Take out your sniper rifle.

1393
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:08,280
Take the shot.

1394
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:08,440
All right.

1395
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,119
How do I throw a device?

1396
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:12,760
You got to find something to throw.

1397
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,400
I'm pretty sure.

1398
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,280
I mean, OK.

1399
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:16,619
Anybody screaming?

1400
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,469
Oh, shit.

1401
00:54:18,469 --> 00:54:19,030
We got Zeds.

1402
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:20,789
Somebody actually just screamed.

1403
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:24,710
Help me, Marina.

1404
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:29,210
Did you ever play Mission Makers for N64?

1405
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:30,409
What?

1406
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:32,329
Mission Makers?

1407
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:34,090
No, I have not.

1408
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:37,539
It's very good.

1409
00:54:37,539 --> 00:54:37,780
All right.

1410
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,500
So this person is...

1411
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:42,090
They're on the roof.

1412
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:42,570
Oh, you're here.

1413
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:43,449
OK.

1414
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:44,969
You're trying to help the person.

1415
00:54:44,969 --> 00:54:46,969
I mean, we might as well do missions and shit.

1416
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:48,889
There's two howlers down here, dude.

1417
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:49,690
Just walk by them.

1418
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,469
Get up here, Omar.

1419
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,300
X.

1420
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:57,860
Press X.

1421
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,789
How do you blow that up?

1422
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:01,269
Oh, shit.

1423
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:01,510
Go.

1424
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,190
You had to press X.

1425
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:08,039
Oh, no.

1426
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,070
I'm going to die again, dude.

1427
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:12,550
I'm not kidding.

1428
00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:20,969
Survivor has turned.

1429
00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:21,690
Did you turn?

1430
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:22,889
No.

1431
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:24,969
Did I?

1432
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:25,369
No.

1433
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:26,170
That must be you.

1434
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:27,610
It's not me.

1435
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:28,969
It's not me.

1436
00:55:28,969 --> 00:55:30,730
Oh, the person we were trying to save, maybe?

1437
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,210
Oh, OK.

1438
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:32,969
Come on, powder.

1439
00:55:32,969 --> 00:55:34,010
Silko's goons are coming.

1440
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,099
Stop saying that.

1441
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,710
Stay on mission.

1442
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:41,590
Down here, we got a question mark.

1443
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:43,590
No, I didn't want to grab this brick building.

1444
00:55:44,469 --> 00:55:46,280
Come on.

1445
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,400
To the UV light up here.

1446
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:50,969
Oh.

1447
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:53,739
Zed's on me.

1448
00:55:53,739 --> 00:55:54,619
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1449
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:55,179
Zed's on me.

1450
00:55:56,469 --> 00:55:56,949
Oh, no.

1451
00:55:57,989 --> 00:55:58,550
Go to the light.

1452
00:55:58,550 --> 00:55:59,510
I'm at the monument.

1453
00:55:59,510 --> 00:55:59,909
At the light?

1454
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:00,389
You were right.

1455
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:04,070
Breathe it in, quick.

1456
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:04,949
OK.

1457
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,780
There is much more to it.

1458
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:09,500
You're getting burned.

1459
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:12,059
They can't take the heat.

1460
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,300
And they shouldn't stand in the fire.

1461
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:14,619
Nice.

1462
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:15,260
OK, we got it.

1463
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:16,539
Objective updated.

1464
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:21,429
Investigate the square.

1465
00:56:22,389 --> 00:56:24,179
Use your game revision.

1466
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:25,860
So yeah, we have to investigate this area here?

1467
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,500
All players required to investigate this plaque.

1468
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,860
That's kind of going to get annoying.

1469
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:33,909
What did that say?

1470
00:56:33,909 --> 00:56:34,550
Something detected?

1471
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:35,429
There's a plaque here.

1472
00:56:35,989 --> 00:56:37,719
A lot of names on it.

1473
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:38,360
People died.

1474
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:38,599
Yeah.

1475
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:43,429
Don't say this game sucks, bro.

1476
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:44,070
No, it doesn't.

1477
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:45,750
I'm really enjoying it.

1478
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,630
It actually is pretty good.

1479
00:56:47,429 --> 00:56:50,230
I think the multiplayer connection is a little weird,

1480
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,110
but that's not.

1481
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:54,280
It looks OK for me.

1482
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,880
Are you having lag issues?

1483
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,800
It desyncs and it looks a little weird,

1484
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,400
but it's just making it more fun, to be honest.

1485
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:05,619
OK, so now investigate the square.

1486
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:06,739
Is there more stuff we have to press?

1487
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,050
Yeah, use your game revision.

1488
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,090
OK, the thing right next to it.

1489
00:57:11,289 --> 00:57:15,099
This is one of those locked containers somewhere over here.

1490
00:57:16,659 --> 00:57:19,460
Yeah, we both need to investigate the same thing.

1491
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:19,940
Yeah.

1492
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,340
Come.

1493
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:20,900
OK.

1494
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,780
Wait, didn't we do that?

1495
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,380
No, we didn't.

1496
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,260
Apparently not this one.

1497
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,079
Hold F and then press F and then press F again.

1498
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:28,119
What happened here?

1499
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:30,360
What happened in the last 10 years of PC games

1500
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,719
where they changed E to F?

1501
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:32,599
Have you noticed that?

1502
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:34,679
They changed E to F and they made you have to hold it.

1503
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:37,079
What happened there?

1504
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:40,199
I'm going to blame Sean Murray and No Man's Sky

1505
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:41,320
and all of his lies.

1506
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,280
Shots were fired.

1507
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,360
The army started shooting at people.

1508
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:48,010
Is that person supposed to be in this cutscene?

1509
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:48,650
We're killing him.

1510
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:52,199
They are?

1511
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,579
Light the candle.

1512
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:59,849
Embrace the light, young man.

1513
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:01,929
Light the candle.

1514
00:58:02,889 --> 00:58:04,650
I don't think this person is supposed to be in the cutscene.

1515
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,489
I think they just accidentally got through the barrier.

1516
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:12,150
All players required.

1517
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:15,449
Man, imagine playing with like 16 people.

1518
00:58:17,449 --> 00:58:18,329
Made a bad call.

1519
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,130
Taking people's guns.

1520
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:23,579
This is actual flop.

1521
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:25,019
This is not a flop.

1522
00:58:25,019 --> 00:58:26,219
Why are you guys saying flop?

1523
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:36,619
OK, so now we got to go back to where we're going now.

1524
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,139
What's this forsaken store in front of us?

1525
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:40,619
You see that?

1526
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:43,300
Yeah, I do.

1527
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:48,340
With the beep beep beep the box detected, box detected.

1528
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,139
Are you getting that over here?

1529
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:52,019
No, I'm not getting a box detected.

1530
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:53,300
It's like container detected.

1531
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:58,019
There's one of those G, what is it?

1532
00:58:58,019 --> 00:58:58,739
The inhibitors?

1533
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,539
Yeah, we can use our key on something here.

1534
00:59:04,579 --> 00:59:07,219
When you're close to one of those locked chests, it goes like this.

1535
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:10,550
Yeah, it goes box detected.

1536
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:13,260
I don't know.

1537
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,219
I don't see anything.

1538
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:15,420
I don't know where it is.

1539
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,539
You have to use your gamer sense.

1540
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,940
I'm gamer sensing as hard as I can.

1541
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,860
I mean, maybe it's in the forsaken store.

1542
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,980
It might be like if you want to go to the forsaken store.

1543
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,460
That's right.

1544
00:59:25,849 --> 00:59:27,289
Bottom left icon.

1545
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:27,929
Oh, shit.

1546
00:59:27,929 --> 00:59:29,369
OK, it tells you how close you are.

1547
00:59:32,699 --> 00:59:33,820
Oh, it does.

1548
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,099
Oh, we're playing hot and cold.

1549
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:38,139
Yeah, so when we walk, we walk towards the storage.

1550
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:39,420
Actually, probably stealth this part.

1551
00:59:44,409 --> 00:59:47,699
There's one behind you.

1552
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,179
I opened up a trunk.

1553
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:50,900
You're going to attack me?

1554
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:51,719
Yeah.

1555
00:59:56,889 --> 00:59:57,389
Didn't work.

1556
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:04,170
Go back to the light.

1557
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:06,280
Embrace the light.

1558
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,840
We're going to get a redo.

1559
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:10,059
Fine.

1560
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:12,949
I got a decoy.

1561
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:13,829
I don't know how to throw it.

1562
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:14,630
How do you get a weapon?

1563
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,250
What?

1564
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:18,630
When did I have this?

1565
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:24,260
I've had this the whole time.

1566
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:24,900
It's always G.

1567
01:00:25,699 --> 01:00:26,340
It's not G.

1568
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:31,780
All right.

1569
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,739
We have to open this crate.

1570
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:41,340
There's one guy here.

1571
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,139
We don't have to worry about this.

1572
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,000
I'm getting park work.

1573
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:47,480
You're standing still?

1574
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,000
Middle mouse.

1575
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,639
OK, hold on.

1576
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:50,139
Hold on.

1577
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:51,960
I'm going to throw the thing.

1578
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,440
You ready?

1579
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:52,920
Wait, hold on.

1580
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,559
I have a skill point.

1581
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:55,079
I just stood there.

1582
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:56,280
I survived the night.

1583
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:56,780
Air kick.

1584
01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:00,500
Yeah, I'm getting an air kick.

1585
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,780
I'm a bit of an air kicker.

1586
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:05,019
We're killing them.

1587
01:01:06,489 --> 01:01:06,989
You missed.

1588
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,289
Yeah, I don't want to break my weapon.

1589
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:10,889
It's daytime.

1590
01:01:10,889 --> 01:01:11,849
See, we survived the night.

1591
01:01:11,849 --> 01:01:12,730
We're good.

1592
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:13,849
Would you get extra EXP?

1593
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:15,230
Yeah.

1594
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:15,730
Cool.

1595
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,269
OK, so let's go find the thing.

1596
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:24,889
Find the thing.

1597
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:26,590
What is that?

1598
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:28,090
It's my noisemaker.

1599
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:28,570
Find the thing.

1600
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:28,730
All right.

1601
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:29,449
Go, go, go, go, go.

1602
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:32,829
It's this way.

1603
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:35,739
Container nearby.

1604
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:37,820
Nine meters away.

1605
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,019
There's so many people here.

1606
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:41,849
They're not people anymore.

1607
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:44,480
Where is it?

1608
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:47,309
It's down that way.

1609
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:49,389
It's got to be in one of these cars or something.

1610
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:50,190
Get on top of this.

1611
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:50,829
Yeah, it's over here.

1612
01:01:51,389 --> 01:01:52,269
A little bit further this way.

1613
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,210
And then jump onto the sign.

1614
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:03,469
And then we go that way.

1615
01:02:04,269 --> 01:02:11,079
Where are you looking for?

1616
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:11,639
I'm going to die.

1617
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:12,679
I'm going to die.

1618
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:13,239
You're going to die?

1619
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:14,760
What happened?

1620
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,280
What are you doing?

1621
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:18,760
I'm killing Zed.

1622
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:20,280
What is happening?

1623
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,159
Remember me.

1624
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:22,360
What is going on over there?

1625
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,559
Remember me.

1626
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,519
Why do you have an infinite supply of these things?

1627
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:29,579
What?

1628
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:31,320
Watch out.

1629
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,280
Somebody on the roof.

1630
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,079
Somebody got sick of you.

1631
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,309
It's like, who's the fuck throwing all those?

1632
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:38,110
This is just...

1633
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,550
We're making a skate video.

1634
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:41,949
This is what a skate video would be like in this period here.

1635
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:46,719
Are you just filming me?

1636
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:47,840
All right, it's over here.

1637
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:49,539
Oh, shit.

1638
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:51,260
Oh, you get that, bro?

1639
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,059
You get that on camera?

1640
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:52,940
I did.

1641
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,219
I'm uploading that to ZeeTube.

1642
01:02:56,699 --> 01:02:57,420
ZedTube.

1643
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,099
All right, it's definitely...

1644
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:01,500
I don't know where it is, but we keep getting closer.

1645
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:02,880
Fuck you.

1646
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,739
Where is it?

1647
01:03:05,739 --> 01:03:08,619
15, 13, 12, 10 meters.

1648
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,539
I found some shrooms up here.

1649
01:03:10,539 --> 01:03:12,539
10, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3.

1650
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:14,780
It's like on top of me somewhere right here.

1651
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,360
Help me.

1652
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:17,599
Help me.

1653
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,159
Where's your bombs?

1654
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,800
It's like, where is it?

1655
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,760
It's right there somewhere.

1656
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:25,519
It's got to be in the car.

1657
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:29,719
Oh, it's in the subway station.

1658
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,510
Okay, we're going under.

1659
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:33,710
Let's go.

1660
01:03:34,429 --> 01:03:36,750
Make sure you press...

1661
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:37,630
You turn on your flashlight.

1662
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:39,610
Stealth, take down.

1663
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:41,210
I choked him out.

1664
01:03:41,769 --> 01:03:42,570
We got to pick this stuff up.

1665
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:43,530
I need to make some more heals.

1666
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:46,510
Oh, it's right here.

1667
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:47,550
Yep, nice.

1668
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:50,719
So what's in it?

1669
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:51,119
Anything good?

1670
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:51,840
The defibrillator.

1671
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,079
Why is that guy burning to death in the subway?

1672
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:55,559
Oh, nice.

1673
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:56,280
We need these things.

1674
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,349
This thing actually...

1675
01:03:58,349 --> 01:03:59,230
We have to collect these.

1676
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:04,489
Yeah, that's when your max stamina increases.

1677
01:04:04,489 --> 01:04:05,530
Hey, hold on.

1678
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:06,409
Let me heal you.

1679
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:09,369
We're taking a lot of damage out there.

1680
01:04:09,369 --> 01:04:09,929
Gas can.

1681
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:11,530
Actually, we should actually...

1682
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:13,050
Let me craft a little bit here.

1683
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,010
This game is fun.

1684
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:15,610
I need honey.

1685
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:18,940
I can give you some honey.

1686
01:04:19,949 --> 01:04:20,670
Stop.

1687
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:26,380
Regenerates a substantial part of your immunity.

1688
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:26,880
Cool.

1689
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:33,849
Huh?

1690
01:04:33,849 --> 01:04:34,570
What are you doing?

1691
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:38,360
When you crouch and look down and move left and right,

1692
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,400
your arms are just like...

1693
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:39,800
I don't know.

1694
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,800
I'm really coming...

1695
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,480
You're holding a weapon, so it's probably not doing it.

1696
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:43,960
Oh.

1697
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,659
I think you press the X to put it away.

1698
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:48,170
Did you turn your FOV up?

1699
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:49,480
Yeah.

1700
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,000
All right, let's get out of here.

1701
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,039
I don't want to throw up.

1702
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:54,619
Wait, we got Zeds.

1703
01:04:54,619 --> 01:04:56,219
Are you going to say that every time?

1704
01:04:56,219 --> 01:04:57,739
We should scavenge down here.

1705
01:04:57,739 --> 01:04:58,699
Yeah, that's true.

1706
01:04:58,699 --> 01:04:59,739
That's a lot of stuff.

1707
01:04:59,739 --> 01:05:00,139
All right.

1708
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:02,059
Let's just clear out these Zeds.

1709
01:05:02,619 --> 01:05:05,389
I'm going to say that every time we see a new room of zombies.

1710
01:05:05,389 --> 01:05:05,869
I think.

1711
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:06,750
We got fighters.

1712
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:14,409
That is like the E3 party audio of all these single-player games, by the way.

1713
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:15,769
Watch out, walkers.

1714
01:05:15,769 --> 01:05:16,809
We got Zeds.

1715
01:05:16,809 --> 01:05:18,329
Fighters incoming.

1716
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:21,050
I just love how in every zombie show,

1717
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,730
they have to call them something different

1718
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:24,730
and they can't do what someone else has already done,

1719
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:26,170
so they can't just be zombies.

1720
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:28,010
They can't be walkers.

1721
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:29,050
They have to be like...

1722
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:31,849
I don't know.

1723
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:33,130
You hear some weird ones.

1724
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:33,690
How do you throw?

1725
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:38,199
How do I throw Malte?

1726
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:41,400
You have to have one on the middle mouse button.

1727
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,989
Got it.

1728
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:47,449
Got it.

1729
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,030
I love the smell of human flesh.

1730
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:54,760
I thought they weren't humans anymore.

1731
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:55,000
Huh?

1732
01:05:57,469 --> 01:05:57,949
They aren't.

1733
01:05:57,949 --> 01:06:00,639
They just have our flesh.

1734
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:01,519
Get off my buddy.

1735
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:08,010
What the fuck?

1736
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:09,050
Why are they...

1737
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:10,250
What did you just do?

1738
01:06:10,889 --> 01:06:12,889
That's not what fire extinguishers do.

1739
01:06:12,889 --> 01:06:14,730
They don't light on fire.

1740
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:16,320
What happened?

1741
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,480
I hit a fire extinguisher

1742
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,800
and flames were coming out of it and it blew up.

1743
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,199
It's contents under pressure, dude.

1744
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,920
But there was literal flames.

1745
01:06:28,329 --> 01:06:28,650
Here.

1746
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:29,369
Let me heal you up.

1747
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:31,659
What is making this like...

1748
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,059
It's kind of annoying me.

1749
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:35,099
I don't know.

1750
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:37,579
This guy's still alive?

1751
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:41,639
Help me kill this guy.

1752
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:42,920
No, I'm scavenging.

1753
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,239
We got some alcohol.

1754
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:45,960
We're going to party.

1755
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,760
There's three more.

1756
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,920
Oh, God.

1757
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:50,280
You keep him busy.

1758
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,320
Oh, never mind.

1759
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:51,960
I thought it was a bomb.

1760
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:01,369
Where are these people coming from?

1761
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:05,769
I think they're using the...

1762
01:07:05,849 --> 01:07:06,409
Bro, let's...

1763
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:08,159
That reaction...

1764
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,480
What you getting?

1765
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,119
We got to go.

1766
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,079
That reaction was like,

1767
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,039
I'm about to crash.

1768
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:14,809
I'm about to crash my car.

1769
01:07:14,809 --> 01:07:16,250
Like, oh my God.

1770
01:07:17,929 --> 01:07:18,250
Bro.

1771
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,239
We've scavenged pretty much everything

1772
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:27,360
we can scavenge from down here.

1773
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:28,559
I haven't.

1774
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:30,650
I'm on low health.

1775
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:31,610
Are you?

1776
01:07:32,329 --> 01:07:33,769
No, don't crush the mushrooms.

1777
01:07:33,769 --> 01:07:34,329
What am I doing?

1778
01:07:41,309 --> 01:07:42,750
These guys have honey on them?

1779
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:44,829
Oh, that beeping that you're saying is so annoying

1780
01:07:44,829 --> 01:07:46,510
is your immunity being critical.

1781
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:48,380
I mean, I just took a mushroom.

1782
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:49,019
Because we're in the dark.

1783
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:51,309
Oh, well, I just heard it.

1784
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:52,989
I got to...

1785
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:53,550
We got to go.

1786
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:55,150
We actually do have to go,

1787
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:56,590
but we need to actually be careful

1788
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:58,349
because we're low on health and shit.

1789
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:03,949
I need some honey.

1790
01:08:04,429 --> 01:08:06,269
Oh, I do have IV heal.

1791
01:08:06,909 --> 01:08:07,869
How critical is your health?

1792
01:08:08,829 --> 01:08:09,389
Very low.

1793
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:10,510
I mean, I keep healing you

1794
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:11,309
and I don't have any left.

1795
01:08:11,309 --> 01:08:12,909
Well, let me return the favor here.

1796
01:08:12,909 --> 01:08:13,409
Okay.

1797
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:15,250
Thank you.

1798
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:16,750
Okay.

1799
01:08:17,949 --> 01:08:19,229
You're low on health.

1800
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:20,029
Stop doing that.

1801
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,840
Why is it doing that noise every five seconds?

1802
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,579
Okay, where are we going?

1803
01:08:31,579 --> 01:08:32,460
I'm going...

1804
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:33,020
Where are we going?

1805
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:33,579
Okay, where are we?

1806
01:08:33,579 --> 01:08:34,460
Wait, hold on.

1807
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,460
We need to go to the mission marker

1808
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,380
and find a place to sleep.

1809
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:40,060
It's daytime.

1810
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:41,020
Why would we need to sleep?

1811
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,140
Because we're tired.

1812
01:08:42,939 --> 01:08:43,659
I'm not tired.

1813
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:47,039
I can keep going.

1814
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,489
All right.

1815
01:08:48,489 --> 01:08:50,810
So where's our marker currently?

1816
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:52,970
We don't have a quest.

1817
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,409
We have one that we can do.

1818
01:08:54,409 --> 01:08:56,170
We have meet Hakann.

1819
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:57,069
Oh, that's the guy.

1820
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:58,510
Where is that?

1821
01:08:58,590 --> 01:08:59,390
That's over here.

1822
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:00,590
We can go to that.

1823
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,090
Okay, let's go.

1824
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,260
We've already met him.

1825
01:09:06,079 --> 01:09:07,760
Well, we have to do more missions with him.

1826
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,479
It's like GTA.

1827
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:15,640
I'm bored of him.

1828
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:22,460
Oh, we got enforcers.

1829
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:24,619
Is that a bad thing or a good thing?

1830
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,000
Ah, they've got spears.

1831
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,920
Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1832
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,600
Come back here behind this bush, Gashkhan.

1833
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,100
Okay.

1834
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,909
What's the plan here?

1835
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:34,670
We need their weapons.

1836
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,600
I think we do need their weapons.

1837
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:37,840
Okay.

1838
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,279
You get behind one, I get behind one.

1839
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:41,119
Let's see where they're situated here.

1840
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,119
We've got this one facing us and then we've got one.

1841
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:46,800
Okay, we've got two not facing us.

1842
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,880
I don't think we actually can.

1843
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,520
It's not letting me.

1844
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,560
Yes, we can.

1845
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,680
No, I meant like the actual instant kill takedown.

1846
01:09:57,279 --> 01:09:59,039
This guy's full of fucking knives.

1847
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:03,520
He has so many knives coming out of his head.

1848
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,399
Oh my god, I'm going to die.

1849
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:07,579
Good luck.

1850
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,079
He's almost dead.

1851
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:09,800
Kill the guy on the ledge.

1852
01:10:12,989 --> 01:10:14,750
Don't push him off because now we can't loot him.

1853
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:15,869
He fell.

1854
01:10:15,869 --> 01:10:16,829
Well, we can go down there.

1855
01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:17,710
I'm going down to loot him.

1856
01:10:24,649 --> 01:10:27,130
Kill the guys up here that are trying to attack me.

1857
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,760
They're not trying to attack me.

1858
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:32,970
Can I make anything?

1859
01:10:34,329 --> 01:10:34,970
Oh, easy.

1860
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:37,310
Get some?

1861
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:39,869
Get, get some is what he said.

1862
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:43,260
He had shoes on him.

1863
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,460
He didn't have a weapon on him.

1864
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:45,579
He only had shoes.

1865
01:10:46,539 --> 01:10:51,579
And this guy's trying to dodge my attack so much that he's.

1866
01:10:51,579 --> 01:10:52,300
What the fuck?

1867
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,920
Loot that guy too, please.

1868
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,520
He didn't die.

1869
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:03,439
Dude, what the fuck?

1870
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:04,399
Stop dodging.

1871
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:05,119
This is this guy's.

1872
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,359
I need healing.

1873
01:11:10,359 --> 01:11:11,479
Oh my fucking god.

1874
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:11,800
Okay.

1875
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,880
Well, this is my character doing.

1876
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,569
You push this one off too.

1877
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:21,130
I was trying to throw knives at him and he killed himself.

1878
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:25,119
Does he see if he has anything on him?

1879
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,829
Oh, he does have this holy shit.

1880
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:32,350
He's got a spear.

1881
01:11:33,229 --> 01:11:34,590
Oh my goodness.

1882
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,750
It's a throwing spear, an opportunity weapon.

1883
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:39,279
Where is that?

1884
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,560
I didn't get one.

1885
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:44,810
Oh, come up here.

1886
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:45,930
There's a throwing spear on this guy.

1887
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:47,850
He's not using it anymore.

1888
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:48,250
Oh shit.

1889
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:48,970
This is awesome.

1890
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:49,130
Okay.

1891
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:52,109
Where are you?

1892
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:52,829
I got to heal first.

1893
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:54,350
Come up here.

1894
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:56,909
I also I've really I have no healing.

1895
01:11:56,909 --> 01:11:58,829
We have to find honey and stuff.

1896
01:11:58,829 --> 01:12:07,470
Keep your spear out because we need to use it.

1897
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:08,189
I crafted it.

1898
01:12:08,189 --> 01:12:08,829
I dropped it.

1899
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:09,949
There's another spear up here.

1900
01:12:11,079 --> 01:12:12,039
I have one already.

1901
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,039
I think you can only hold one.

1902
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:14,920
Yeah.

1903
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:15,960
All right.

1904
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:16,520
Let's go.

1905
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:16,920
Well, hold on.

1906
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:17,319
Hold on.

1907
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:18,119
You see that guy down there?

1908
01:12:19,529 --> 01:12:19,930
Three.

1909
01:12:20,729 --> 01:12:21,449
Wait, hold on.

1910
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:22,670
Three.

1911
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:22,909
Yep.

1912
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:23,630
Two.

1913
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:25,069
One.

1914
01:12:25,069 --> 01:12:25,390
Action.

1915
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:28,029
That was pretty sick.

1916
01:12:28,029 --> 01:12:28,829
I'm not going to lie.

1917
01:12:28,829 --> 01:12:29,710
That was really cool.

1918
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:31,149
Let's go steal stuff.

1919
01:12:31,149 --> 01:12:32,109
He's definitely dead.

1920
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:36,430
It was just like he was trying to cover up the graffiti.

1921
01:12:36,989 --> 01:12:38,729
Is that what he really was doing?

1922
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,550
Hey, oh, medicine.

1923
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:43,739
You had two heels on him.

1924
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:45,420
Yeah, we don't need to find honey.

1925
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:46,859
We just need to kill enforcers.

1926
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,829
I don't have that in my inventory.

1927
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:51,470
I can heal you.

1928
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:52,350
You come over here.

1929
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:56,170
Oh, no, you're good.

1930
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:56,810
Yeah, no, I'm good.

1931
01:12:59,689 --> 01:13:01,960
Let's keep going here.

1932
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,680
Get their attention.

1933
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,449
You didn't throw it far enough, I don't think.

1934
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:14,489
All right.

1935
01:13:14,489 --> 01:13:15,159
Okay.

1936
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:15,960
Yeah, that was that.

1937
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,479
That barely hurt this guy.

1938
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:21,340
Probably a special effect of the explosion.

1939
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:24,140
I mean, like they're all they're all feeling pretty okay.

1940
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:26,220
Spears probably do so much damage.

1941
01:13:33,949 --> 01:13:35,149
Is there a way to charge up a swing?

1942
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:36,909
I probably learn later.

1943
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:39,069
Yeah, I don't think we can yet.

1944
01:13:40,109 --> 01:13:42,510
I think we got to do like the main quest.

1945
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:43,869
I know we keep getting too distracted.

1946
01:13:43,869 --> 01:13:44,670
We really do.

1947
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:45,710
Oh, there's no spear here.

1948
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:49,640
What's the guy doing?

1949
01:13:55,369 --> 01:13:56,729
All right, let's go, please.

1950
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:56,970
Okay.

1951
01:13:57,609 --> 01:13:59,770
This is like the starting area we were in.

1952
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:01,529
I mean, this game reminds me of a video game.

1953
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,689
Yeah, we're going to go speak to Hakan.

1954
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:06,649
Hey, on that point.

1955
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:06,890
Wait.

1956
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:09,609
Oh, I think we have combat points.

1957
01:14:09,609 --> 01:14:10,090
I have one.

1958
01:14:11,609 --> 01:14:12,250
I don't.

1959
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,390
Perfect dodge.

1960
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:18,680
You have the XP bonus.

1961
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,119
Oh, I like that.

1962
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:21,159
I'm going to do air kick.

1963
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:23,039
Are you serious?

1964
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:34,619
Are you looking at?

1965
01:14:34,619 --> 01:14:36,119
Hold on.

1966
01:14:36,119 --> 01:14:36,760
Crouch.

1967
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,720
You hear these guys talking?

1968
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:40,250
Kind of.

1969
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:41,960
Where are they?

1970
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:47,439
They're just saying the same thing over and over again for me.

1971
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:48,960
Got a hammer?

1972
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,520
Let's get closer.

1973
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:57,420
Got a hammer?

1974
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:57,979
We got two.

1975
01:14:57,979 --> 01:15:00,090
Yeah, you can open there.

1976
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:01,609
Don't why would you kick it open?

1977
01:15:02,489 --> 01:15:03,760
Taking so long.

1978
01:15:11,789 --> 01:15:13,229
Wait, somebody's about to blow a horn.

1979
01:15:15,689 --> 01:15:16,569
What's with the horn?

1980
01:15:18,729 --> 01:15:19,130
I don't.

1981
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:20,250
I don't know what you're talking about.

1982
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,369
What's taking so long?

1983
01:15:21,369 --> 01:15:23,289
It was just a horn indicator on the screen.

1984
01:15:24,409 --> 01:15:25,130
Like they were going to go.

1985
01:15:27,949 --> 01:15:29,310
Well, they were going to rally the troops.

1986
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,260
I mean, these are like tough guys.

1987
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:34,300
This guy's wearing camo.

1988
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:39,390
Lots of stuff over in the corner.

1989
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:41,819
You can craft a new item.

1990
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:44,029
Ooh, what is it?

1991
01:15:44,029 --> 01:15:49,289
You can't craft a new item.

1992
01:15:49,289 --> 01:15:52,859
We got a question mark over here.

1993
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:54,300
You can't craft any new items.

1994
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:54,939
Lying game.

1995
01:15:55,659 --> 01:16:03,630
Want to go to this question mark?

1996
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:05,310
Yeah, I'm just getting the loot, man.

1997
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:06,510
We got a blue over here.

1998
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,109
All right, what's this?

1999
01:16:08,109 --> 01:16:08,909
Is it a random?

2000
01:16:09,949 --> 01:16:10,909
Let's go to this blue.

2001
01:16:10,909 --> 01:16:13,069
I kind of like how they just add a random

2002
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:16,029
stranger quest like GTA.

2003
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:17,869
It's another bandit.

2004
01:16:17,869 --> 01:16:18,829
We got to chase this guy.

2005
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,039
It hurts so much.

2006
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,319
Oh, it's just a bandit.

2007
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:31,319
It is just a bandit quest.

2008
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:36,920
Why can't I pick it up?

2009
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,750
I feel like I just got out with my life.

2010
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:47,149
That was like my life flash before my eyes.

2011
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:51,979
Oh, holy shit.

2012
01:16:54,699 --> 01:16:55,899
We got to get Spider-Man.

2013
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:58,060
I can't climb that fast.

2014
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:02,640
I'm going to cut him off.

2015
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:04,079
He fell.

2016
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:04,579
What?

2017
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:05,699
He fell.

2018
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:07,140
I fell.

2019
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,199
I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.

2020
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,949
Oh, shit.

2021
01:17:13,949 --> 01:17:14,430
I didn't get him.

2022
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,789
I'm out of stamina.

2023
01:17:15,789 --> 01:17:16,510
He's still going.

2024
01:17:17,229 --> 01:17:21,229
Did I get him?

2025
01:17:22,029 --> 01:17:22,529
I got him.

2026
01:17:22,989 --> 01:17:26,359
Okay, I'm coming.

2027
01:17:26,359 --> 01:17:27,079
Oh, no.

2028
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:28,699
I alerted the horde.

2029
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,340
My hand.

2030
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:34,109
I didn't loot him yet.

2031
01:17:34,109 --> 01:17:34,909
I didn't loot him yet.

2032
01:17:34,909 --> 01:17:35,789
I don't have any weapons.

2033
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:37,550
Do I have a weapon?

2034
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:38,430
I got him, I got him.

2035
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:40,430
Wait, I need to stop to loot it.

2036
01:17:42,029 --> 01:17:43,710
One, two, three, four cycles your weapons.

2037
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:44,989
Inventory, you can equip weapons.

2038
01:17:44,989 --> 01:17:46,750
You probably keep picking them up and not realize them.

2039
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:51,500
Okay.

2040
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,800
Oh, germa powder.

2041
01:17:54,439 --> 01:17:55,159
Come up here.

2042
01:17:55,159 --> 01:17:55,659
Mm-hmm.

2043
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:00,890
There are people every 10 feet.

2044
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:02,699
Why?

2045
01:18:02,699 --> 01:18:04,140
These people have like a birdhouse?

2046
01:18:08,409 --> 01:18:10,409
Why are these guys wearing ski masks?

2047
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,439
I don't...

2048
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:16,199
They were both up here wearing ski masks tending to their beehives.

2049
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:17,880
Oh, wait, because they don't want to get stung in the face.

2050
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:18,439
That makes sense.

2051
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,420
That doesn't make sense.

2052
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:22,220
All right, we can actually craft them.

2053
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:22,939
Oh, yeah.

2054
01:18:22,939 --> 01:18:24,220
We got chamomile and honey.

2055
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:24,939
That's what they're doing.

2056
01:18:24,939 --> 01:18:25,739
They're healing up.

2057
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:26,239
Okay.

2058
01:18:27,319 --> 01:18:27,800
You see this?

2059
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,840
There's a police car down there.

2060
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:29,720
A couple of zeds on it.

2061
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:32,460
No, I didn't want to take the inhaler.

2062
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:34,109
Oh, my God.

2063
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:35,710
I probably needed to use that at some point.

2064
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:36,210
Important.

2065
01:18:36,989 --> 01:18:42,890
Let me put this stuff on my bar.

2066
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:44,520
Okay.

2067
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,399
I have two weapons.

2068
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:48,600
Okay.

2069
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,350
I want to get in this police car.

2070
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:53,770
There's so much shit up here, though.

2071
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:54,409
Look at all this stuff.

2072
01:18:55,369 --> 01:18:57,850
There's so much stuff.

2073
01:18:58,409 --> 01:19:06,380
There's like shrooms.

2074
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:08,380
There's beehives.

2075
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:12,829
These guys had a little thing going on up here, huh?

2076
01:19:12,829 --> 01:19:13,329
Yeah.

2077
01:19:14,029 --> 01:19:15,220
All right.

2078
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,720
They really figured this whole thing out.

2079
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:19,210
I think there's gas in here.

2080
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:22,520
They had an axe and a birdhouse.

2081
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,159
How was the axe?

2082
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,550
You know, it's a raggedy.

2083
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:26,590
It's a ragged chopper.

2084
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:27,390
You know what I'm talking about.

2085
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:27,890
That's not bad.

2086
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:28,750
Did we get in a police car?

2087
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:29,470
19 damage.

2088
01:19:30,109 --> 01:19:33,020
Okay.

2089
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:33,899
Let's try the police car.

2090
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:38,199
Okay.

2091
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:39,479
I'll distract them and you open it.

2092
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,239
Where's the police car?

2093
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:42,760
Right in front of us in the middle of the road.

2094
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:43,239
I see.

2095
01:19:43,239 --> 01:19:43,739
Okay.

2096
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:46,560
Yeah, I'm going to distract them.

2097
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:48,399
How come I couldn't kick that guy?

2098
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:49,199
I tried to do my kick.

2099
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,119
I'm lowering him away.

2100
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:51,619
Get in there.

2101
01:19:54,779 --> 01:19:55,279
I can do it.

2102
01:19:55,819 --> 01:19:56,619
I'm keeping him off you.

2103
01:19:56,619 --> 01:19:57,180
It's a lockpick.

2104
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:57,659
It's a lockpick.

2105
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:58,619
It's a lockpick.

2106
01:19:58,619 --> 01:19:59,180
I can't open it.

2107
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,060
I have to do the lockpick.

2108
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:00,220
I can't.

2109
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:00,939
We have to kill these guys.

2110
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:03,340
Okay.

2111
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:03,819
I got you.

2112
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:09,289
That what?

2113
01:20:09,289 --> 01:20:09,850
What?

2114
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:10,649
That was it?

2115
01:20:10,649 --> 01:20:11,449
That was the sound?

2116
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:16,859
Dude, watch my back.

2117
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:18,699
They're all fighting me.

2118
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:21,979
You have one person over there attacking you.

2119
01:20:22,939 --> 01:20:24,890
I've watched my freaking back.

2120
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:30,779
Keep him off me.

2121
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:32,460
I can do that.

2122
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,180
You handle the car.

2123
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:33,979
I'll do my work.

2124
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:36,300
I'm out of stamina.

2125
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,399
I almost got it.

2126
01:20:47,289 --> 01:20:48,170
There's a snake in here.

2127
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:48,670
Get it.

2128
01:20:51,689 --> 01:20:52,189
All right.

2129
01:20:52,729 --> 01:20:53,529
We're in the clear.

2130
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:56,340
Leather.

2131
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,380
Leather.

2132
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,140
Leather.

2133
01:21:06,439 --> 01:21:07,880
I don't know if we're being gate kept.

2134
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,520
We can't find guns and cop cars.

2135
01:21:11,319 --> 01:21:13,319
Hey, what's this place?

2136
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:20,159
We're getting distracted every five seconds.

2137
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:21,439
Yeah, it's the terminal.

2138
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:23,880
The main terminal.

2139
01:21:32,409 --> 01:21:34,779
My god.

2140
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:36,829
Okay.

2141
01:21:37,979 --> 01:21:40,060
Are we about to do the first story mission of the game?

2142
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:42,300
Oh, you went to Hakann?

2143
01:21:42,859 --> 01:21:43,579
He's the other way.

2144
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:45,899
Let's go.

2145
01:21:45,899 --> 01:21:48,060
Dude, we've been going the wrong direction.

2146
01:21:48,939 --> 01:21:49,579
No, we're fine.

2147
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:51,180
We got a little distracted.

2148
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:52,060
We got a whole bunch of honey.

2149
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,100
We got a whole bunch of heals.

2150
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:53,659
We're equipped.

2151
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:54,939
We know how the game works.

2152
01:21:54,939 --> 01:21:56,539
It's like that's all smooth sailing from here.

2153
01:21:56,539 --> 01:21:57,500
No more distractions.

2154
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:57,899
We're running.

2155
01:21:57,899 --> 01:21:58,539
It's parkour.

2156
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,239
Here to Sunday.

2157
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,640
I hear people talk and ignore them.

2158
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,840
But they're funny NPCs we can go kill.

2159
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:06,720
Somebody's blowing their horn.

2160
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,220
See?

2161
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,600
ADHD should be illegal.

2162
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,119
Okay.

2163
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:21,949
I discovered the dark hollows.

2164
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:26,060
There's a tank down there.

2165
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:27,579
A tank?

2166
01:22:27,579 --> 01:22:28,079
Yeah.

2167
01:22:28,539 --> 01:22:29,979
We can really use that thing.

2168
01:22:29,979 --> 01:22:31,180
Maybe we can get like...

2169
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,539
Wait, is that an Omega Zed?

2170
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:34,779
It looks like an Omega Zed.

2171
01:22:34,779 --> 01:22:35,739
Is that Big Bertha?

2172
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:39,779
There's explosives down there.

2173
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:40,899
What should we do?

2174
01:22:40,899 --> 01:22:43,939
This is just like that one scene in that one show.

2175
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,449
Like the tyrant is down there.

2176
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:48,770
I got a Molotov.

2177
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:50,050
Should we just throw it over there and see what happens?

2178
01:22:54,689 --> 01:22:55,649
You completely missed.

2179
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:57,680
You're supposed to be the gamer.

2180
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,079
I didn't know how far they throw.

2181
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:06,850
Here we go.

2182
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:07,170
All right.

2183
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:10,369
Is it going to blow up the...

2184
01:23:10,369 --> 01:23:12,210
Oh, the propane tank is still not blown up.

2185
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:16,210
Yikes.

2186
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:17,760
There's ghosts.

2187
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,720
There are ghosts.

2188
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:19,439
Chain reaction.

2189
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:21,520
Oh, whoa, dude.

2190
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,020
Nice.

2191
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:22,899
Wait.

2192
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:24,449
That guy's flying.

2193
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:28,420
There goes another one.

2194
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:28,920
Another one.

2195
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,319
I'm not sure if we heard them or not.

2196
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:39,220
Okay, so...

2197
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:40,720
They're climbing.

2198
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:42,560
All right, they're climbing.

2199
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,199
I'm frozen.

2200
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:43,680
What do we do?

2201
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:44,640
All right, let's go back.

2202
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,039
I don't think we can do that right now.

2203
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:47,840
I think we can.

2204
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,640
I think you're giving up.

2205
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,720
It's a tyrant down there.

2206
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:51,520
We don't have a...

2207
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,720
We don't have a gun or anything.

2208
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,239
There's more explosives.

2209
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:55,439
All right, go for it.

2210
01:23:55,439 --> 01:23:55,760
Ready?

2211
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,260
Oh, my God.

2212
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:58,199
Ready?

2213
01:23:59,199 --> 01:23:59,920
One, two...

2214
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:00,800
Wait, I'm not ready.

2215
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:01,300
I'm not...

2216
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:03,279
All right, I'm waiting.

2217
01:24:06,369 --> 01:24:07,489
When do you think you'll be ready?

2218
01:24:07,489 --> 01:24:09,090
I'm just curious.

2219
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:10,050
Okay, I'm going.

2220
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:10,609
I'm going.

2221
01:24:10,609 --> 01:24:11,729
I'm going.

2222
01:24:11,729 --> 01:24:12,229
All right, going.

2223
01:24:15,489 --> 01:24:16,850
Power attacks cannot be blocked.

2224
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:17,329
All right, what was it?

2225
01:24:17,329 --> 01:24:17,829
What was here?

2226
01:24:18,449 --> 01:24:20,899
Something in the tank.

2227
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:24,449
Holy shit.

2228
01:24:24,449 --> 01:24:24,949
Okay, what is it?

2229
01:24:26,739 --> 01:24:27,239
Open it up.

2230
01:24:27,779 --> 01:24:36,350
Dude, there's something we can do with the tank.

2231
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:37,069
The back of the tank.

2232
01:24:37,789 --> 01:24:42,210
They're all coming for me.

2233
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:43,250
See if you can get it.

2234
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:43,810
I'm hurting.

2235
01:24:44,449 --> 01:24:44,689
What?

2236
01:24:44,689 --> 01:24:45,250
The back of the tank?

2237
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,210
I don't see anything.

2238
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:46,930
At the back of the tank,

2239
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:47,890
there's like a lever you can pull.

2240
01:24:51,539 --> 01:24:52,659
All right, actually, you distract him.

2241
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:54,979
Are you talking about the spear?

2242
01:24:54,979 --> 01:24:55,699
There's a lever here.

2243
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,140
God damn it.

2244
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:59,340
At the back of the tank,

2245
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:00,140
right at the very back,

2246
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:00,779
at the bottom of the tank,

2247
01:25:00,779 --> 01:25:01,819
there's like a lever.

2248
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:05,069
I'm going to die.

2249
01:25:06,029 --> 01:25:06,529
You all right?

2250
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:08,430
All right, just run away.

2251
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:08,930
Run away.

2252
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:11,729
Let's get out.

2253
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:14,880
I keep pressing E to use

2254
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,539
and I keep kicking things.

2255
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:20,420
Just rebind it.

2256
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:25,600
Can I craft like a bomb or something?

2257
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:33,539
I'm going to craft some knives.

2258
01:25:33,539 --> 01:25:34,260
Just leave them.

2259
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:36,739
I want to.

2260
01:25:36,739 --> 01:25:37,939
I mean, we already did.

2261
01:25:37,939 --> 01:25:39,140
We committed to this bullshit.

2262
01:25:39,859 --> 01:25:42,340
There's nobody here.

2263
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:43,699
Are you kidding me?

2264
01:25:43,699 --> 01:25:44,260
I think I can get it.

2265
01:25:44,819 --> 01:25:47,539
Oh my God.

2266
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:48,659
Oh my God.

2267
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:50,149
Oh my God.

2268
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:52,000
Oh my God.

2269
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,500
I'm going to get it.

2270
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:54,840
What is it?

2271
01:25:56,189 --> 01:25:56,689
Rations.

2272
01:25:58,850 --> 01:25:59,649
All right, the hard lock.

2273
01:25:59,649 --> 01:26:00,529
Oh, no, don't do it.

2274
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:02,310
Hard lock.

2275
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:04,130
All right, help me.

2276
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:05,329
Just protect me.

2277
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,659
Where did the Tyrant go?

2278
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:10,800
I don't know.

2279
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:13,939
How do I throw this?

2280
01:26:13,939 --> 01:26:14,420
Ignite it?

2281
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:15,220
I can't ignite it.

2282
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:15,720
Why not?

2283
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:17,300
You have to hold X.

2284
01:26:18,579 --> 01:26:19,220
All right, watch out.

2285
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:28,670
I think we can just clear it.

2286
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:29,310
Just clear it out.

2287
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:30,829
Yeah, I'm clearing.

2288
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,460
The Tyrant left.

2289
01:26:35,819 --> 01:26:36,319
Yeah, he was.

2290
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:38,380
That's good for us.

2291
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:51,699
All right.

2292
01:26:51,699 --> 01:26:53,380
I think there's one of these two left, right?

2293
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,569
Are we breathing in chemicals somewhere?

2294
01:27:00,609 --> 01:27:02,699
Oh, this one's a lock as well.

2295
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:04,060
All right, this is perfect.

2296
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:05,500
Loot everything.

2297
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:08,670
Don't read this comment, Jerma.

2298
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:09,170
What?

2299
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:11,170
You...

2300
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:11,729
Oh, man.

2301
01:27:12,449 --> 01:27:16,369
This is actually cool.

2302
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:19,520
I'm breaking all my lockpicks.

2303
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,369
Somebody said press C when you land to break your fall.

2304
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:24,579
I can't.

2305
01:27:24,579 --> 01:27:25,220
I can't do this.

2306
01:27:25,859 --> 01:27:26,340
Oh, shit.

2307
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:26,819
How many?

2308
01:27:26,819 --> 01:27:28,100
I think I have one.

2309
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:28,979
I have one left.

2310
01:27:29,859 --> 01:27:33,060
Okay, where would you see the most non-resistance?

2311
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:34,020
I didn't see anything.

2312
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,079
Did you do the ambulance?

2313
01:27:41,329 --> 01:27:50,399
Yeah.

2314
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:51,039
Holy shit.

2315
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:51,520
What the hell?

2316
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:55,359
Yeah, we're just like not good enough to do very hard yet.

2317
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:57,779
I'm not getting anything.

2318
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:02,960
Oh, my God.

2319
01:28:06,989 --> 01:28:07,710
I got it.

2320
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:08,189
Holy shit.

2321
01:28:08,189 --> 01:28:08,590
I got it.

2322
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:10,029
What a gamer.

2323
01:28:10,029 --> 01:28:11,310
It was all the way to the right.

2324
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:16,399
Dust filter, solid shoes, and rations.

2325
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:18,960
A bolted bludgeon.

2326
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:20,720
28 damage.

2327
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,439
Yeah, I feel like we're being gate kept from guns.

2328
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,720
You don't find it in like the armored carrier.

2329
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:27,840
Like, come on, man.

2330
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:30,449
Didn't you say there was another thing to open?

2331
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:32,289
This one here, too?

2332
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:33,600
All right.

2333
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,399
Let me see if I can get this.

2334
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:42,369
I am...

2335
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:44,210
Trust me when I say this.

2336
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:45,569
I'm the lockpick guy from now on.

2337
01:28:46,289 --> 01:28:46,930
I trust you.

2338
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:53,760
Please play Sam and Max VR.

2339
01:28:54,779 --> 01:28:57,020
Well, I put VR in the box and it's in the closet now,

2340
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:58,220
so it's not going to happen.

2341
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:01,680
I do own the game, though.

2342
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,800
So eventually you'll see it.

2343
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:09,069
Okay, can we like get in here?

2344
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:14,270
There's a random person over there.

2345
01:29:14,989 --> 01:29:17,390
Hey, can we make it to this main quest right up here?

2346
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:18,189
Meet Hakan?

2347
01:29:18,189 --> 01:29:18,989
Yeah, let's...

2348
01:29:18,989 --> 01:29:21,310
Okay, that's enough.

2349
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:22,819
We've been playing for an hour and a half,

2350
01:29:22,819 --> 01:29:24,020
and I know we're having a lot of fun.

2351
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:25,220
This is actually a really good time,

2352
01:29:25,939 --> 01:29:27,779
but we gotta...

2353
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:29,380
We can't just not do the whole game.

2354
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:30,100
We're having a good time,

2355
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,779
but we need to like put it to an end right now

2356
01:29:31,779 --> 01:29:33,220
and like talk to this main quest guy.

2357
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:33,859
Yep.

2358
01:29:33,859 --> 01:29:38,270
Hakan, you're a better climber than one crazy girl I used to know.

2359
01:29:39,229 --> 01:29:39,869
She was something.

2360
01:29:39,869 --> 01:29:41,149
Have you ever played Castlevania Symphony?

2361
01:29:41,149 --> 01:29:42,270
I climbed the tallest building.

2362
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:42,829
Nope.

2363
01:29:42,829 --> 01:29:43,069
Right.

2364
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:45,340
I feel like I lived it, you know?

2365
01:29:45,979 --> 01:29:47,500
I just like you playing the game is kind of boring.

2366
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,100
There's an ad that might be...

2367
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,800
Did you play Vampire Survivors?

2368
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,899
That's a stir game.

2369
01:29:56,539 --> 01:29:57,500
I think we talked about it.

2370
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,460
Yeah, that's a stir game.

2371
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,079
I kept reading on the Reddit

2372
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:04,159
that it's like a ripoff of Magical Survivors.

2373
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:05,840
So on the plane trip out here,

2374
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,840
I was like, oh, I'm gonna like download Magical Survivors

2375
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,079
and like see what the one it was based on

2376
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:11,439
and support the original.

2377
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:12,560
And shit's not on iOS.

2378
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:14,720
Is it actually?

2379
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:16,479
It's like Android only.

2380
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,600
I wonder why that one didn't take off.

2381
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:27,859
All right, tunnels.

2382
01:30:28,739 --> 01:30:31,300
Dude, the tunnel troll.

2383
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:31,779
Here we go.

2384
01:30:36,029 --> 01:30:37,630
Oh, wait, we're tunnel trolling?

2385
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:39,069
Get to the station through the metro.

2386
01:30:40,829 --> 01:30:44,829
Wait, is there like...

2387
01:30:44,829 --> 01:30:45,229
Hold on.

2388
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,460
Make sure that we can...

2389
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,140
I don't want to just leave here

2390
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:52,500
without something we can do or crafts of items.

2391
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:56,609
Well, that's the objective.

2392
01:30:57,329 --> 01:30:58,770
Okay, so I'm just making sure.

2393
01:30:59,649 --> 01:31:01,300
Wait, which one is the objective?

2394
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:04,899
Oh, down here, 20 meters down.

2395
01:31:04,899 --> 01:31:07,039
All right, it's nighttime, by the way.

2396
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:08,560
So this is where it gets a little hairy.

2397
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:26,829
Where did you get this two-hander?

2398
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:28,989
It was in the military truck.

2399
01:31:28,989 --> 01:31:29,710
I got the good loot.

2400
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:30,909
Oh, what?

2401
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:37,310
We have to pick this lock.

2402
01:31:38,819 --> 01:31:40,340
Yeah, so clear the zeds, dude.

2403
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:42,819
You're the one with the big two-hander.

2404
01:31:42,819 --> 01:31:43,939
I'm hitting them.

2405
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,050
That was actually pretty cool.

2406
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:52,770
Why did I just do the thing from God of War?

2407
01:31:53,569 --> 01:31:54,210
I threw...

2408
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:59,569
I just recalled Mediolnir.

2409
01:32:00,609 --> 01:32:02,020
Hey, you're the lockpick guy.

2410
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:02,420
Let's go.

2411
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:02,899
That's me.

2412
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:05,420
Zeds are coming.

2413
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:06,140
Something exploded.

2414
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:06,619
Don't know why.

2415
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:13,069
That's me.

2416
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:13,869
First try, Andy.

2417
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:14,909
Bandits.

2418
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:24,560
I think we should just leave.

2419
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,199
I want these guys dead

2420
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:29,039
for ever even considering fighting.

2421
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:32,220
He had Siggy's name.

2422
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:36,300
All right, let's go before we get killed.

2423
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:39,779
My God.

2424
01:32:39,779 --> 01:32:40,260
I grabbed...

2425
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:41,460
How do...

2426
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:42,659
Help!

2427
01:32:43,539 --> 01:32:45,300
I don't know how to do it.

2428
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:45,779
I'm honest.

2429
01:32:48,829 --> 01:32:49,949
Running out of stamina works.

2430
01:32:52,829 --> 01:32:53,630
Oh, shit!

2431
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:54,270
Okay, I grabbed it.

2432
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:54,590
I'm fine.

2433
01:32:55,229 --> 01:33:11,810
Ooh, pills.

2434
01:33:12,369 --> 01:33:12,770
Aspirin.

2435
01:33:13,329 --> 01:33:13,810
Pills here.

2436
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:15,409
Cigarettes.

2437
01:33:16,210 --> 01:33:18,430
Hey, where are the rifles?

2438
01:33:19,229 --> 01:33:20,109
Where are the shotguns?

2439
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:22,140
My chat is telling me

2440
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:23,819
there are no guns in the future.

2441
01:33:23,819 --> 01:33:24,779
There are no guns in the game?

2442
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:27,569
Good.

2443
01:33:27,569 --> 01:33:28,689
They said there's like two.

2444
01:33:28,689 --> 01:33:29,329
Like these gamers

2445
01:33:29,329 --> 01:33:31,010
have to fucking actually play the game.

2446
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:32,369
They kind of spoiled it.

2447
01:33:32,369 --> 01:33:33,649
You know, I would have talked about it

2448
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:35,170
for like six more hours, but...

2449
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:36,050
Oh, we want guns.

2450
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:37,489
Now the gamers actually have to fucking

2451
01:33:37,489 --> 01:33:38,050
play the game

2452
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:39,170
and not just like shoot stuff.

2453
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:40,289
Yeah.

2454
01:33:52,899 --> 01:33:53,779
Oh, shit!

2455
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:55,220
Gary?

2456
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:56,819
It was a fucking cockroach.

2457
01:33:57,539 --> 01:33:59,699
This is not how you would crawl through this.

2458
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:02,420
You are deliberately

2459
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:03,939
putting your ass in my face.

2460
01:34:03,939 --> 01:34:04,500
Deliberately.

2461
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,100
I'm a spider.

2462
01:34:06,739 --> 01:34:07,539
Let me go in front of you

2463
01:34:07,539 --> 01:34:08,180
just so you can see.

2464
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:10,500
This is not how somebody crawls through a vent.

2465
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,500
I've been waiting years for you to say that.

2466
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:13,140
Look at this.

2467
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:19,789
Okay.

2468
01:34:19,789 --> 01:34:20,909
You wouldn't even fit doing that.

2469
01:34:20,909 --> 01:34:21,550
Wait, watch out.

2470
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:22,270
Watch out, Zeds.

2471
01:34:22,829 --> 01:34:24,239
You get the one on the left.

2472
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:24,479
All right.

2473
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:26,239
You have to give one community sub

2474
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:28,000
every time you say that from now on.

2475
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,479
Say what?

2476
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:30,239
Oh, Zeds, look out.

2477
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:31,359
Oh, shit!

2478
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:33,199
I owe a hundred community subs to my chat.

2479
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:34,000
I hope I can do it.

2480
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,460
You didn't do the one on the left.

2481
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:40,770
My credit card got declined

2482
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:42,449
like five times last time.

2483
01:34:42,449 --> 01:34:43,569
I hope I can do it this time.

2484
01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:48,720
Okay, I need a weapon.

2485
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:49,439
Do you have any extras?

2486
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,140
I do.

2487
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:52,579
I don't know if I can drop them.

2488
01:34:52,579 --> 01:34:54,500
Oh, I can.

2489
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,340
Oh, I got to take shrooms.

2490
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:57,619
I dropped a slicer for you.

2491
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:02,560
That didn't do anything.

2492
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,520
My immunity is still low.

2493
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:07,340
It adds like a minute.

2494
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:08,859
It doesn't add like a full timer.

2495
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:09,979
Okay, let's go.

2496
01:35:09,979 --> 01:35:10,380
We got to hurry.

2497
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:12,060
It only adds like 30 seconds.

2498
01:35:12,859 --> 01:35:18,699
Okay, we got to speed run this.

2499
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:20,319
The Zeds are coming.

2500
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,159
That's one.

2501
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:25,729
I'm in the tunnel.

2502
01:35:25,729 --> 01:35:27,569
Now watch out for the infected.

2503
01:35:27,569 --> 01:35:30,050
There might be a few or a few dozen.

2504
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:32,210
You really are playing chivalry at this point now.

2505
01:35:34,989 --> 01:35:36,670
It looks like you're play fighting,

2506
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:38,270
but you don't actually want to swing that.

2507
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:39,149
You're just watching.

2508
01:35:39,149 --> 01:35:40,750
Do I give you my weapon so you can watch?

2509
01:35:41,949 --> 01:35:47,970
All right, take some more mushrooms.

2510
01:35:47,970 --> 01:35:49,409
We actually do have to go your right and run.

2511
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:50,930
There's mushrooms right here.

2512
01:35:51,729 --> 01:35:52,930
Oh, sick.

2513
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:53,890
Watch out, infected.

2514
01:35:54,689 --> 01:35:58,159
Don't alert them.

2515
01:35:58,159 --> 01:35:59,649
You can just crawl through.

2516
01:36:00,369 --> 01:36:03,869
Can you do the tutorial, man?

2517
01:36:03,869 --> 01:36:04,590
Oh, watch out.

2518
01:36:07,810 --> 01:36:11,329
Wait, oh, sick, sick.

2519
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:15,229
What happened to don't alert the Zeds?

2520
01:36:15,789 --> 01:36:17,069
They were going to see me.

2521
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:17,710
It was fate.

2522
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:20,909
Oh, you said it.

2523
01:36:20,909 --> 01:36:23,470
Now you owe me 100 gifts for the community.

2524
01:36:24,449 --> 01:36:25,489
All right, this is lockpick door.

2525
01:36:26,130 --> 01:36:29,819
Lockpick guy.

2526
01:36:29,819 --> 01:36:30,539
Can you please do it?

2527
01:36:30,539 --> 01:36:31,020
I got you.

2528
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:33,260
If you're actually going to protect me, I will.

2529
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:39,970
I'm in.

2530
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:41,949
Okay, shut the door.

2531
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:45,819
Oh, there's a container in here somewhere.

2532
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:48,510
They just punched me through the door.

2533
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:51,010
48 meters somewhere.

2534
01:37:02,539 --> 01:37:05,180
That's definitely in here somewhere.

2535
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:05,420
Cool.

2536
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:09,760
Our immunity is getting even lower.

2537
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,489
We're close, though.

2538
01:37:19,489 --> 01:37:19,890
It's fine.

2539
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,609
Okay, that's like a dog tunnel at one of those dog shows.

2540
01:37:24,609 --> 01:37:25,409
What's the point of this?

2541
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:29,119
You just went through the obstacle.

2542
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:31,119
That's an air duct for the air to travel through this.

2543
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:31,840
You see?

2544
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:32,960
Yeah, but why?

2545
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:33,520
Why did you?

2546
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:34,640
What's the point of having it here?

2547
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:37,279
The air is not going to circulate unless you make this tube.

2548
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:44,289
48.

2549
01:37:45,010 --> 01:37:48,300
All right, let's get to this metro station.

2550
01:37:48,939 --> 01:37:50,060
We lost it.

2551
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:51,180
We lost the center.

2552
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:53,840
I don't know what we're doing here.

2553
01:37:55,739 --> 01:37:57,420
We had a beep beep and we lost the scent.

2554
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,500
Oh, there was a beep beep back there.

2555
01:37:59,500 --> 01:37:59,899
It was.

2556
01:38:00,539 --> 01:38:01,420
Do you want to go back?

2557
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:02,300
We only have two minutes.

2558
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:02,859
It's too late.

2559
01:38:03,579 --> 01:38:05,180
There's a whole bunch of shrooms down here.

2560
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:06,859
Like every 10 steps, there's a shroom.

2561
01:38:06,859 --> 01:38:07,420
You want to go back?

2562
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:11,100
No, I want to do the main quest objective.

2563
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:11,819
Okay, fine.

2564
01:38:11,819 --> 01:38:12,939
I don't want to get distracted.

2565
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:23,489
All right.

2566
01:38:23,489 --> 01:38:24,369
What was that?

2567
01:38:24,369 --> 01:38:26,369
That's the sound I make when I swing my two-hander.

2568
01:38:28,210 --> 01:38:29,170
I'm going to play chivalry.

2569
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:35,390
There are shrooms everywhere.

2570
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:35,789
You're right.

2571
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:40,739
All right, let's hide from this guy.

2572
01:38:43,539 --> 01:38:43,939
Does he know?

2573
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:45,539
What?

2574
01:38:45,539 --> 01:38:46,659
How does he know?

2575
01:38:46,659 --> 01:38:47,939
Oh, your head was sticking out.

2576
01:38:48,899 --> 01:38:57,359
We got to run.

2577
01:38:57,359 --> 01:38:58,319
Okay, just run forward.

2578
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:06,210
Oh, he had vodka and decoys.

2579
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:08,529
Decoys on that guy.

2580
01:39:08,529 --> 01:39:09,090
Let's go.

2581
01:39:10,210 --> 01:39:13,090
And cigarettes and yep.

2582
01:39:13,090 --> 01:39:13,729
Yeah, I could.

2583
01:39:14,369 --> 01:39:15,649
I got to the flare.

2584
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:18,609
Look around the technical tunnel to the main station.

2585
01:39:18,609 --> 01:39:19,090
Stand here.

2586
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:22,460
Well, finally a new whip.

2587
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:23,180
I'll chat them up.

2588
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:24,060
Will you get inside?

2589
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,340
Ooh, what is the immunity?

2590
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:29,779
And it's drinking.

2591
01:39:30,899 --> 01:39:31,779
You put a mask on.

2592
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:35,069
I think I'm sitting in the light.

2593
01:39:35,069 --> 01:39:37,069
No, you put a mask on your character.

2594
01:39:38,369 --> 01:39:39,649
Did you?

2595
01:39:39,649 --> 01:39:40,739
Yeah.

2596
01:39:40,739 --> 01:39:41,619
Oh, cool.

2597
01:39:41,619 --> 01:39:43,149
That's really cool.

2598
01:39:43,149 --> 01:39:44,510
Yeah, I really like that.

2599
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:47,260
Here, you're the door guy.

2600
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:50,800
I mean, I'm a walk-pick guy, not the door guy.

2601
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,000
Oh, can you hold the door for me?

2602
01:39:53,439 --> 01:39:53,840
Watch out.

2603
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:54,560
We got a spitter.

2604
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:56,319
Oh, my God.

2605
01:39:56,319 --> 01:39:58,399
This guy spitting fucking squad out of his nose.

2606
01:39:58,399 --> 01:39:59,760
Oh, it's coming out of his hat.

2607
01:40:08,189 --> 01:40:08,670
What do I do?

2608
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:13,460
Okay, skip, skip, skip.

2609
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:14,819
Run forward and hit it with a hammer.

2610
01:40:14,819 --> 01:40:15,060
Okay.

2611
01:40:15,619 --> 01:40:19,739
Well, it's a medium walk-pick.

2612
01:40:19,739 --> 01:40:20,060
I got it.

2613
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:24,939
Hakon.

2614
01:40:25,819 --> 01:40:28,619
I'm telling you, I'm going to first try every single one of these.

2615
01:40:28,619 --> 01:40:29,340
It's open.

2616
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:34,590
Kill that guy?

2617
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:35,090
Yeah.

2618
01:40:36,189 --> 01:40:38,430
Killing him took less time than the phone call.

2619
01:40:39,149 --> 01:40:42,189
Did he have anything on him?

2620
01:40:42,189 --> 01:40:42,909
Trophy?

2621
01:40:42,989 --> 01:40:45,069
He had a special zombie-infected trophy.

2622
01:40:45,069 --> 01:40:48,350
He was like, congratulations on killing one of my rare species.

2623
01:40:48,350 --> 01:40:49,550
Here is an award.

2624
01:40:50,189 --> 01:40:53,659
No power.

2625
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:57,739
Watch out.

2626
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:03,899
Yeah, you're going to want to stay behind me for this.

2627
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:10,779
Are you doing like a, I'm like a gremlin routine.

2628
01:41:10,779 --> 01:41:14,140
That's like the, I'm going to go down and I'm going to act like a gremlin

2629
01:41:14,939 --> 01:41:16,380
to make people laugh at the party.

2630
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:20,779
How often do you play gremlin?

2631
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:22,699
I don't know.

2632
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:26,779
Have I ever seen somebody do the thing that I just referenced?

2633
01:41:26,779 --> 01:41:29,569
I don't think so.

2634
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:33,659
I don't think I've seen that.

2635
01:41:33,659 --> 01:41:35,979
I don't think gremlin is a game a lot of kids play.

2636
01:41:38,699 --> 01:41:42,939
Why am I, why am I imagining a fake scenario where like somebody's drunk at a party and

2637
01:41:42,939 --> 01:41:46,060
they go on all fours and are like, I'm the gremlin and like I'm running around.

2638
01:41:46,859 --> 01:41:47,739
Yeah.

2639
01:41:47,739 --> 01:41:48,779
I feel like that's probably happened.

2640
01:41:49,659 --> 01:41:52,300
I mean, anything that can happen has happened.

2641
01:41:53,100 --> 01:42:01,659
And then they like jump into the pool.

2642
01:42:01,659 --> 01:42:02,220
You know what I mean?

2643
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:03,579
Like, it's me, gremlin guy.

2644
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:05,420
And then they jump in the pool.

2645
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:08,529
I think you're thinking of your Sims playthrough again.

2646
01:42:15,739 --> 01:42:18,220
Oh, we're getting some golden coins.

2647
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:24,960
So these kind of like hitman, you just throw them to distract people.

2648
01:42:27,170 --> 01:42:27,729
I guess.

2649
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:33,180
Are you sure this is something you did yourself?

2650
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:34,220
Hitman VR.

2651
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:35,180
Should I play?

2652
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:35,420
No.

2653
01:42:36,539 --> 01:42:36,939
Really?

2654
01:42:36,939 --> 01:42:38,619
I thought you would have been like, oh God, yes.

2655
01:42:38,619 --> 01:42:39,899
Yeah, it's okay.

2656
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:42,060
Let me, let me explain hitman VR to you.

2657
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:46,479
So IO interactive, phenomenal company.

2658
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:49,199
Like seriously, like what, what a great, they,

2659
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:50,319
what a story, right?

2660
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:51,600
Oh, the IO verse.

2661
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,359
They bought back their rights to their game.

2662
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:55,279
They made fucking incredible hitman games.

2663
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:57,600
One, two, and three, absolute like masterpieces of games.

2664
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:58,319
It was so much fun.

2665
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:03,199
They decided to make a PS VR version of hitman.

2666
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:04,479
Oh, it was only PS VR?

2667
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:05,920
It was PS VR exclusive.

2668
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:09,520
And when, what they did is like a year later,

2669
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:13,920
because you had to play with the controller in your hand with the VR headset on.

2670
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:19,279
A year later, they decided to port the PS VR version

2671
01:43:19,279 --> 01:43:20,640
to like all the other headsets.

2672
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,720
And it's really weird how it controls.

2673
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:25,840
We just got Westworlded.

2674
01:43:28,939 --> 01:43:31,199
Okay, imagine they took the controller.

2675
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:35,279
They cut the controller in half and you hold the PS4 controller in two hands.

2676
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:36,800
It's kind of, it's weird.

2677
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:39,359
Is it worth doing?

2678
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:42,800
I think it's fun and it's hilarious the shit you can do.

2679
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,439
Here's the choice.

2680
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:45,119
I still haven't played Half-Life Alex.

2681
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:46,159
Do I play it?

2682
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:46,960
What are you doing?

2683
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,760
Do not even make that, that's, you want me to make the choice for you?

2684
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:53,439
Yeah, or Wii Sports.

2685
01:43:54,859 --> 01:43:56,619
You've never played Wii Sports?

2686
01:43:56,619 --> 01:43:57,659
Never played Wii Sports.

2687
01:43:57,659 --> 01:44:01,020
So like if either Half-Life Alex, Wii Sports, or Hitman VR.

2688
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:03,100
Oh, fuck the Super Bowl is today.

2689
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:03,819
It is.

2690
01:44:03,819 --> 01:44:05,020
Oh, well.

2691
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:05,819
You gonna watch?

2692
01:44:05,819 --> 01:44:06,779
No.

2693
01:44:06,779 --> 01:44:08,770
I'm hoping the Packers win.

2694
01:44:08,770 --> 01:44:11,170
Half-Life Alex, Wii Sports, or Hitman VR.

2695
01:44:11,170 --> 01:44:14,930
I'd say Wii Sports because I mean, that's a legendary classic video game.

2696
01:44:15,649 --> 01:44:16,449
Okay, I don't have a Wii.

2697
01:44:16,449 --> 01:44:17,569
The tunnel is going to be closed.

2698
01:44:17,569 --> 01:44:18,689
Well, then play Half-Life Alex.

2699
01:44:19,489 --> 01:44:24,130
I feel like I've been hyping Alex up to you for like a year straight now,

2700
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:25,810
and you're going to play it and be like, that sucked.

2701
01:44:27,810 --> 01:44:30,609
Someone was hyping it to me, not that like a week ago as well.

2702
01:44:30,609 --> 01:44:30,930
Let's get.

2703
01:44:40,130 --> 01:44:41,090
I can't even click.

2704
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:42,050
You're doing it too fast.

2705
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:49,010
You shouldn't trust me.

2706
01:44:49,010 --> 01:44:50,210
I'm on trust where I can try.

2707
01:44:51,489 --> 01:44:54,079
There are people here that are probably wanting to watch this,

2708
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:57,439
to even get even a sniff of what the story is.

2709
01:44:57,439 --> 01:44:59,119
And we have to both apologize.

2710
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:00,159
I can recap it.

2711
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:01,680
I don't have to apologize.

2712
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,600
If you apologize to your chat, you give them power.

2713
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:08,220
My feet off of that.

2714
01:45:08,779 --> 01:45:10,619
But anyways, play Half-Life Alex.

2715
01:45:11,899 --> 01:45:14,460
There's a couple of sequences in Half-Life Alex that were just like,

2716
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:16,060
wow, this is what VR is supposed to be.

2717
01:45:16,779 --> 01:45:22,449
Okay, wait, are we just leaving here?

2718
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:23,329
I think so.

2719
01:45:23,329 --> 01:45:23,890
How is it?

2720
01:45:24,609 --> 01:45:25,489
Okay.

2721
01:45:25,489 --> 01:45:27,329
Oh, it's the enforcers.

2722
01:45:27,329 --> 01:45:28,210
Oh, shit.

2723
01:45:28,210 --> 01:45:29,810
Speaking of Half-Life Alex,

2724
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:33,310
if this is Half-Life 2 opening scene right now.

2725
01:45:33,310 --> 01:45:35,489
Well, you forgot to go.

2726
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:40,529
But can't we all agree that, like,

2727
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:43,359
Red Faction 1 is better than Half-Life?

2728
01:45:44,899 --> 01:45:47,060
Okay, I don't think you're going to be, like,

2729
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:48,739
allowed to be on the internet anymore after saying that.

2730
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:51,619
I want to make it really clear.

2731
01:45:51,619 --> 01:45:53,539
I have nothing to do with this person.

2732
01:45:53,539 --> 01:45:55,060
I don't really know them that well.

2733
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:55,779
I don't.

2734
01:45:55,779 --> 01:45:57,380
I have friends who kind of,

2735
01:45:57,380 --> 01:45:58,579
I don't really know them that well, though.

2736
01:45:58,579 --> 01:45:59,779
Have you played Red Faction?

2737
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:01,600
Yes.

2738
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,539
Okay.

2739
01:46:04,539 --> 01:46:05,739
Well, are you going to tell me

2740
01:46:05,739 --> 01:46:07,180
Red Faction is not a good game?

2741
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:09,100
I mean, I don't remember playing.

2742
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,220
It was a long time ago.

2743
01:46:10,859 --> 01:46:12,460
Okay, well, do it again.

2744
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:16,220
Better than Half-Life 1 or Half-Life 2?

2745
01:46:17,819 --> 01:46:18,779
Better than Half-Life 2.

2746
01:46:19,899 --> 01:46:23,340
Because it's basically Half-Life 1 made two years later.

2747
01:46:23,979 --> 01:46:27,409
Well, everybody can have opinions,

2748
01:46:27,409 --> 01:46:29,489
and, you know, we can respect your opinion,

2749
01:46:29,489 --> 01:46:30,529
but disagree with you.

2750
01:46:30,529 --> 01:46:33,250
I don't think anyone's respecting my opinion.

2751
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:34,609
We can disagree with that opinion.

2752
01:46:34,609 --> 01:46:35,489
We all have opinions.

2753
01:46:35,489 --> 01:46:37,090
We can, you know, just settle down.

2754
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:39,250
I'm driving so much chat engagement.

2755
01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:43,279
Okay, we can either leave or explore.

2756
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:44,560
Yeah, I want to.

2757
01:46:45,279 --> 01:46:46,460
We got janitors.

2758
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:47,979
Like, oh, we're in the metro.

2759
01:46:47,979 --> 01:46:49,500
Wait, are we in the metro?

2760
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:53,949
Are we in the metro?

2761
01:46:53,949 --> 01:46:55,630
I don't think there's much we can do here.

2762
01:46:55,630 --> 01:47:01,489
There's a door over there,

2763
01:47:01,489 --> 01:47:03,890
and then there's a door that has a quest marker on it over there.

2764
01:47:04,689 --> 01:47:05,170
Yeah, okay.

2765
01:47:05,170 --> 01:47:06,770
Let's go to the quest marker.

2766
01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:07,810
We're going to distract it.

2767
01:47:07,810 --> 01:47:08,529
I'm walking.

2768
01:47:09,569 --> 01:47:17,579
I will say that when I got to the boat section of Half-Life 2,

2769
01:47:17,579 --> 01:47:19,579
I almost threw up every time I tried to play it.

2770
01:47:19,579 --> 01:47:22,060
Okay, but did you ever throw up during playing Red Faction?

2771
01:47:22,859 --> 01:47:23,359
No.

2772
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:30,029
I also have to be fair to the game as well.

2773
01:47:30,029 --> 01:47:32,590
That's back before anyone knew what FOV even was.

2774
01:47:33,550 --> 01:47:38,300
Back in like 2006, 2007, like FOV,

2775
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:39,500
people didn't even fucking care.

2776
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:40,380
Nobody even knew what it was.

2777
01:47:42,029 --> 01:47:43,789
That was like a gamer enthusiast,

2778
01:47:43,789 --> 01:47:46,189
like only a few people really even knew or cared about.

2779
01:47:46,189 --> 01:47:48,670
You're kind of reminded of like the olden days

2780
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:52,350
where every single video TotalBiscuit had to explain what FPS was.

2781
01:47:53,069 --> 01:47:54,270
No, yeah, like I mean,

2782
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:58,270
it was not like common knowledge back in like 2005, 2006.

2783
01:47:58,270 --> 01:48:02,909
Like FOV was something that nobody really even thought really thought that much about.

2784
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:06,189
Yeah, the human eye can only see like 20.

2785
01:48:06,989 --> 01:48:07,630
All right, where are we going?

2786
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:11,710
Yeah, so there's that slider in the video menu

2787
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:14,750
that it starts at 75 and goes up to 90, right?

2788
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:15,630
I never touched it.

2789
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:18,109
So during the boat missions, it was 75 FOV,

2790
01:48:18,109 --> 01:48:21,149
and I'm sitting like a foot away, two feet away from my screen.

2791
01:48:21,149 --> 01:48:22,510
And I'm just like, why the fuck?

2792
01:48:22,510 --> 01:48:23,149
I'm sick.

2793
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:26,510
Oh, I remember having to lie down on my back on the floor.

2794
01:48:27,149 --> 01:48:28,989
I was in the middle of the boat mission,

2795
01:48:28,989 --> 01:48:31,229
and I seriously had to get up, hit escape,

2796
01:48:31,229 --> 01:48:34,350
lie down on my back and lie there for like a minute or two.

2797
01:48:35,149 --> 01:48:36,750
But I really wanted to experience the game

2798
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:38,909
so that I got up eventually after I was not nauseous

2799
01:48:38,909 --> 01:48:40,750
and did it again for like another five minutes.

2800
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:42,750
Felt like I was going to puke again,

2801
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:43,869
lied on my back on the ground.

2802
01:48:44,670 --> 01:48:47,149
I had to do that for like 40 minutes to get through that boat section.

2803
01:48:48,779 --> 01:48:50,779
Okay, but how do you feel about the hour-long,

2804
01:48:50,779 --> 01:48:52,539
non-skippable in-character cutscene?

2805
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,359
That's like, but all right.

2806
01:48:55,359 --> 01:48:57,199
But they like pioneered that shit.

2807
01:48:58,380 --> 01:48:58,859
Back, okay.

2808
01:48:58,859 --> 01:49:00,939
Pioneered you having to like stand still?

2809
01:49:00,939 --> 01:49:03,100
You have to understand something, stir.

2810
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:05,579
Weren't you saying earlier that you like games that let you go fast?

2811
01:49:05,579 --> 01:49:06,220
Yeah, but listen.

2812
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:07,420
You were saying like, oh, I'm going fast.

2813
01:49:07,979 --> 01:49:10,779
Back before, before that,

2814
01:49:10,779 --> 01:49:14,779
it used to be you had like eight Final Fantasy CDs

2815
01:49:14,779 --> 01:49:16,380
because there were fucking four CDs

2816
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:19,420
full of FMV full motion video rendered cutscenes on them.

2817
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,619
Like when they came up with that idea

2818
01:49:22,619 --> 01:49:25,020
to not have like rendered cutscenes,

2819
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:27,600
that was a huge deal.

2820
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:28,640
Having it in the game,

2821
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:31,439
it wasn't just like a cutscene that you had to watch.

2822
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:33,680
But I think just because you can doesn't mean you should.

2823
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:35,279
I'm stuck on this.

2824
01:49:35,279 --> 01:49:37,279
Hey, can you sell all your valuables?

2825
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:40,800
I actually think I'm going to sell some stuff.

2826
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:43,279
Yeah, the like cutscene that is not,

2827
01:49:43,279 --> 01:49:45,680
you know, there's no loading screen, go to the cutscene.

2828
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:48,539
There's classes in this game.

2829
01:49:48,539 --> 01:49:50,140
These weapons actually look pretty good.

2830
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:53,180
This guy's selling joggers for a brawler class.

2831
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:55,489
I think I want this axe.

2832
01:49:55,489 --> 01:50:04,060
Is that a bad idea?

2833
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:08,289
I just sold everything.

2834
01:50:08,289 --> 01:50:11,970
I think selling all the valuables are all like things that don't matter.

2835
01:50:11,970 --> 01:50:12,689
Okay, I hope so.

2836
01:50:13,250 --> 01:50:16,800
Holy shit, there's grenades.

2837
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:24,750
Ooh, stamina cost.

2838
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:25,789
Bracers for a tank.

2839
01:50:28,109 --> 01:50:29,229
When do I get the wingsuit?

2840
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:35,279
I'm pretty sure there is one.

2841
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:36,479
They might be.

2842
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:37,439
Yeah, I'm assuming they might be.

2843
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:38,319
All right, we should probably get.

2844
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:42,109
I know that they have like the grappling hook again.

2845
01:50:42,109 --> 01:50:45,760
Now, can't you upgrade and like craft your gear?

2846
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,810
I think so, right?

2847
01:50:47,810 --> 01:50:49,329
I'm going to buy a few of these.

2848
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:51,329
Yeah, I'm buying a grenade.

2849
01:50:51,329 --> 01:50:54,909
Yeah, buy a couple of grenades.

2850
01:50:54,909 --> 01:50:56,270
I think we can utilize them pretty well.

2851
01:50:58,859 --> 01:51:02,079
We got the craft master over here.

2852
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:03,119
Oh, you get blueprints.

2853
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:06,880
There's mines and shock arrows for my arrow.

2854
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,279
Where do you see blue mines?

2855
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:11,710
The other merchant over here.

2856
01:51:11,949 --> 01:51:13,310
That was truly a pleasure.

2857
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:15,840
Reinforces your weapon.

2858
01:51:16,479 --> 01:51:17,600
Is your voice higher today?

2859
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:18,640
You sound like a balloon.

2860
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:19,840
What are you talking about?

2861
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,859
I sound like a balloon?

2862
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,699
What do you mean a balloon?

2863
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:27,020
Your voice is a little higher.

2864
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:29,729
Your voice is a little bit higher.

2865
01:51:29,729 --> 01:51:32,239
What do you mean?

2866
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:33,310
Hold on.

2867
01:51:33,310 --> 01:51:38,529
I don't have my effects thing on, do I?

2868
01:51:38,529 --> 01:51:41,170
Yeah, you've actually like the whole time you've been talking.

2869
01:51:41,170 --> 01:51:43,170
You've actually been talking like this.

2870
01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:46,220
It's been really weird and I didn't want.

2871
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:47,659
I thought you were doing like a new thing.

2872
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:48,619
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2873
01:51:48,619 --> 01:51:52,000
How do I sound?

2874
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:55,949
Should we both just do this and see what people say?

2875
01:51:55,949 --> 01:51:57,869
Just continue to stream the whole time.

2876
01:51:57,869 --> 01:51:59,949
A little bit higher.

2877
01:51:59,949 --> 01:52:02,029
And every hour that goes by, we get a little bit higher.

2878
01:52:02,029 --> 01:52:02,989
Just go a little bit higher.

2879
01:52:02,989 --> 01:52:04,829
A little bit higher.

2880
01:52:04,829 --> 01:52:06,670
And then when we get too high, we end the stream.

2881
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,449
Okay, we have to have a base level though.

2882
01:52:13,489 --> 01:52:14,689
That's just high enough.

2883
01:52:15,329 --> 01:52:17,329
That's like one notch over.

2884
01:52:17,329 --> 01:52:19,970
Okay, so how do I sound with one notch over?

2885
01:52:20,449 --> 01:52:22,619
Is it kind of weird, but you can't really tell?

2886
01:52:22,619 --> 01:52:23,579
Are you doing it now?

2887
01:52:23,579 --> 01:52:24,880
I'm doing it right now.

2888
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,079
I can't tell at all.

2889
01:52:26,079 --> 01:52:27,920
I think I got used to it.

2890
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:29,949
What about this one?

2891
01:52:29,949 --> 01:52:30,670
I can't tell.

2892
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:31,939
What about now?

2893
01:52:31,939 --> 01:52:34,050
Is it different?

2894
01:52:34,050 --> 01:52:35,010
Very slightly.

2895
01:52:35,010 --> 01:52:36,130
I think I heard there.

2896
01:52:36,130 --> 01:52:37,090
Okay, so how about now?

2897
01:52:39,149 --> 01:52:40,189
Is it too noticeable now?

2898
01:52:40,829 --> 01:52:42,029
Extremely noticeable.

2899
01:52:42,029 --> 01:52:42,590
All right.

2900
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:43,229
How about now?

2901
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:51,390
That sounds like something might be wrong with your mic, but like kind of normal.

2902
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:53,229
All right, now you do one notch on pitch.

2903
01:52:53,229 --> 01:52:55,600
We both have the same product.

2904
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,039
Are you doing gender or pitch?

2905
01:52:57,039 --> 01:53:00,100
I did pitch.

2906
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:02,500
Okay, that's one notch gender.

2907
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:05,260
Okay, I don't hear anything.

2908
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:05,899
Two.

2909
01:53:05,899 --> 01:53:07,659
Oh, you can start to hear it.

2910
01:53:07,659 --> 01:53:09,819
It just sounds like something wrong with your mic.

2911
01:53:09,819 --> 01:53:11,739
Yeah, and then you go a little.

2912
01:53:11,739 --> 01:53:12,619
Yeah, this one.

2913
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:14,859
Okay, this one I have to go pretty far and then it's weird.

2914
01:53:14,859 --> 01:53:15,739
Is that pitch or gender?

2915
01:53:15,739 --> 01:53:16,239
Which one?

2916
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:18,159
I'm doing pitch now.

2917
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:19,439
This is one notch.

2918
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:21,520
Okay, yeah, this is just one notch and I can kind of hear it.

2919
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:22,479
Yeah, okay.

2920
01:53:22,479 --> 01:53:23,600
I'm on one notch as well.

2921
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:24,239
All right, let's go.

2922
01:53:25,359 --> 01:53:25,859
Okay.

2923
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:28,640
This is so weird.

2924
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:29,920
It is really weird.

2925
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:35,229
Once we get to a certain point though, then we're gonna, you know, we gotta go.

2926
01:53:35,310 --> 01:53:41,699
I am gonna upgrade my consumable.

2927
01:53:41,699 --> 01:53:44,420
Yeah, you can get like shock tips for your weapon here.

2928
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:47,949
You can get, you know, we can get some crafts for our,

2929
01:53:47,949 --> 01:53:49,550
you gotta buy those so you can upgrade your weapon.

2930
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:50,750
It's not like a different recursive.

2931
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:51,250
Okay.

2932
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:54,100
Yeah.

2933
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:55,460
All right, I think I got what I need.

2934
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:58,239
I'm gonna buy a couple.

2935
01:53:58,239 --> 01:54:00,399
What's this?

2936
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:01,520
I have a lot of heals.

2937
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:02,319
I got eight heals.

2938
01:54:02,319 --> 01:54:03,119
I think we're good.

2939
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:06,100
All right.

2940
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:07,680
You went up higher.

2941
01:54:08,319 --> 01:54:09,199
I didn't go up higher.

2942
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:09,840
Yes, you did.

2943
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,039
You went up higher.

2944
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:12,479
I just started talking a little bit different.

2945
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:13,600
No, you went up higher.

2946
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:14,079
You went like this.

2947
01:54:14,079 --> 01:54:14,960
I didn't go up higher.

2948
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,319
This is what you just did.

2949
01:54:16,319 --> 01:54:17,600
What are you talking about?

2950
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:18,399
You just went higher.

2951
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:21,279
I was just talking different.

2952
01:54:21,279 --> 01:54:23,119
I didn't change the slider.

2953
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:23,760
Yes, you just did.

2954
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:24,239
I heard it.

2955
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:26,420
What do you mean you heard it?

2956
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:27,779
Do Aaron.

2957
01:54:30,609 --> 01:54:30,770
Aaron!

2958
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:31,729
What are you talking about?

2959
01:54:31,729 --> 01:54:33,250
Can I get an Aaron from you?

2960
01:54:34,479 --> 01:54:35,199
Aaron?

2961
01:54:35,199 --> 01:54:35,699
No.

2962
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:37,250
There you go.

2963
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:40,819
All right.

2964
01:54:40,819 --> 01:54:42,420
Let's fucking play the game, please.

2965
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:44,180
Let's play the game.

2966
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:49,199
No, that's that's like chipmunk.

2967
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:50,399
You know, it's not.

2968
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:50,979
It's...

2969
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:52,500
It's like...

2970
01:54:53,869 --> 01:54:54,369
Not like...

2971
01:55:07,659 --> 01:55:09,020
Oh, so you like you suck.

2972
01:55:09,579 --> 01:55:10,079
You suck.

2973
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:12,060
You suck.

2974
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:12,619
Why you say it?

2975
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:14,939
You just lost us like 3,000 viewers.

2976
01:55:14,939 --> 01:55:15,340
Thanks a lot.

2977
01:55:15,340 --> 01:55:15,840
Let's go.

2978
01:55:17,659 --> 01:55:18,159
Okay.

2979
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:21,500
You're the one that like started this whole thing.

2980
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:21,819
Thanks.

2981
01:55:21,819 --> 01:55:22,380
Thanks a lot.

2982
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:22,699
Thanks a lot.

2983
01:55:22,699 --> 01:55:23,899
You lost us like 3k viewers.

2984
01:55:23,899 --> 01:55:24,399
Thank you.

2985
01:55:25,039 --> 01:55:25,539
Okay.

2986
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:26,800
Yeah, I'm at negative.

2987
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:32,260
Wait, wait.

2988
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:33,220
I wanted to ask what they...

2989
01:55:33,220 --> 01:55:34,420
What did they want from me?

2990
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:35,380
They asked me to help them.

2991
01:55:35,380 --> 01:55:36,819
He might let me through to the center.

2992
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:37,859
If I...

2993
01:55:37,859 --> 01:55:38,500
Okay, we're caught up.

2994
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:40,180
Completely unwatchable stream.

2995
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:46,659
Fuck you, dude.

2996
01:55:46,659 --> 01:55:46,899
All right.

2997
01:55:46,899 --> 01:55:48,500
Find the brass knuckle thief.

2998
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:51,140
Find Hubert Kerbapsos.

2999
01:55:51,859 --> 01:55:54,359
Let's find him.

3000
01:55:55,399 --> 01:55:57,760
Oh, so you went the wrong way.

3001
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:02,340
Pretty sure Hubert Kerbapsos...

3002
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:03,939
I'm sorry that I said you sound like a balloon

3003
01:56:03,939 --> 01:56:05,220
and made you lose a thousand viewers.

3004
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:08,100
Well, time that person off for five minutes.

3005
01:56:10,949 --> 01:56:12,710
How dare you do that to our stream?

3006
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:15,189
I take my stream very...

3007
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:16,630
Seriously?

3008
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,239
I still haven't figured this out.

3009
01:56:20,239 --> 01:56:21,439
I still haven't figured out how to climb.

3010
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:22,399
Oh, this guy's got a book.

3011
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:25,859
I still for some reason have not figured this out.

3012
01:56:26,659 --> 01:56:26,899
What?

3013
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:28,979
Like how to like properly like climb

3014
01:56:28,979 --> 01:56:30,180
without losing all your stamina.

3015
01:56:30,979 --> 01:56:32,579
Oh, you just climb up.

3016
01:56:32,579 --> 01:56:33,619
I think the more you press...

3017
01:56:33,619 --> 01:56:35,619
Like if you mash spacebar, it's just like...

3018
01:56:35,619 --> 01:56:37,220
Oh, it's just drain...

3019
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:37,539
Okay.

3020
01:56:37,539 --> 01:56:39,140
It sucks it out of you.

3021
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:39,300
Yeah.

3022
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:40,500
What is this book going on here?

3023
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:40,899
I don't know.

3024
01:56:40,899 --> 01:56:41,939
I was by the campfire.

3025
01:56:42,739 --> 01:56:47,890
Is this Life is Strange?

3026
01:56:51,989 --> 01:56:53,750
I know you're cycling through your secondary

3027
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:54,550
to see if you have a grenade.

3028
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:56,369
I'm not.

3029
01:56:56,369 --> 01:56:56,930
I'm sitting down.

3030
01:56:56,930 --> 01:56:57,649
I can't do anything.

3031
01:56:57,649 --> 01:56:58,369
That's what I was doing.

3032
01:56:59,090 --> 01:56:59,489
Oh, no.

3033
01:56:59,489 --> 01:57:01,489
I'm sitting down and just taking in the environment.

3034
01:57:02,529 --> 01:57:04,420
Did it do anything?

3035
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:05,619
No, there's like right here.

3036
01:57:05,619 --> 01:57:07,840
There's actually like a sit spot.

3037
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:08,239
Oh, no.

3038
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:09,039
I see what's going on.

3039
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:12,159
All these guys got to the boat level in Half-Life 2.

3040
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:12,560
I see.

3041
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:12,960
I get it.

3042
01:57:13,939 --> 01:57:14,899
I mean, I have a grenade.

3043
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:20,739
Yeah.

3044
01:57:20,739 --> 01:57:21,460
Life is Strange.

3045
01:57:21,460 --> 01:57:21,859
Let's go.

3046
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:26,310
Just kind of chill and vibe out.

3047
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:28,159
So tough being a teen.

3048
01:57:29,399 --> 01:57:29,800
All right.

3049
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:30,359
Are you ready?

3050
01:57:33,079 --> 01:57:33,319
Yeah.

3051
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:35,350
Is it...

3052
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:35,909
Okay.

3053
01:57:35,909 --> 01:57:36,630
He almost...

3054
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:36,869
Okay.

3055
01:57:36,869 --> 01:57:37,350
He almost...

3056
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:38,310
I thought he was going to throw a grenade.

3057
01:57:39,670 --> 01:57:39,989
Yeah.

3058
01:57:39,989 --> 01:57:41,270
I thought he was going to throw a grenade at them.

3059
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:44,119
All right.

3060
01:57:44,119 --> 01:57:44,359
Come on.

3061
01:57:44,359 --> 01:57:44,840
Let's go.

3062
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:45,479
Sarah, stop.

3063
01:57:45,479 --> 01:57:46,760
I didn't even see it.

3064
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:47,720
I didn't even look.

3065
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:48,199
I didn't...

3066
01:57:48,199 --> 01:57:48,760
I thought that...

3067
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:49,000
Okay.

3068
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,119
I didn't even look.

3069
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:53,159
I didn't even get it on camera.

3070
01:57:54,039 --> 01:57:56,560
Okay.

3071
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:00,840
No, nothing.

3072
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:03,029
Scraps.

3073
01:58:03,029 --> 01:58:04,869
I killed her for a box of scraps.

3074
01:58:06,069 --> 01:58:06,789
Oh, scraps?

3075
01:58:08,260 --> 01:58:10,579
Unlock faction structures and activate a safe zone.

3076
01:58:12,869 --> 01:58:13,029
Yeah.

3077
01:58:13,029 --> 01:58:13,829
I have no more grenades.

3078
01:58:21,239 --> 01:58:23,460
Let's just go do this.

3079
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:23,699
Wait.

3080
01:58:23,699 --> 01:58:24,420
There's something going on here.

3081
01:58:26,289 --> 01:58:26,689
Bandit.

3082
01:58:27,329 --> 01:58:28,689
Oh, they're bandits?

3083
01:58:28,689 --> 01:58:29,010
Bandit.

3084
01:58:30,550 --> 01:58:31,350
That's not...

3085
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:31,670
Okay.

3086
01:58:31,670 --> 01:58:32,470
They need to fix that.

3087
01:58:32,470 --> 01:58:33,590
That doesn't make any sense.

3088
01:58:33,590 --> 01:58:35,189
I'm sending an air support.

3089
01:58:35,189 --> 01:58:36,229
That doesn't make any sense.

3090
01:58:36,229 --> 01:58:37,989
Like, how would that even make any sense?

3091
01:58:37,989 --> 01:58:39,029
I can't even climb that.

3092
01:58:40,069 --> 01:58:42,529
There's an explosion.

3093
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:45,699
He's going to get away.

3094
01:58:45,699 --> 01:58:47,380
Wait, there was...

3095
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:49,539
Oh, that's what you meant by bandit.

3096
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:50,739
Band-aid.

3097
01:58:50,739 --> 01:58:51,300
Bandit.

3098
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:52,739
Oh.

3099
01:58:52,739 --> 01:58:53,380
We got to...

3100
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:54,899
Can we go to the quest?

3101
01:58:54,899 --> 01:58:56,979
I want to earn like a new parkour skill.

3102
01:58:58,979 --> 01:58:59,300
Fine.

3103
01:59:01,409 --> 01:59:01,970
It's up here.

3104
01:59:01,970 --> 01:59:02,850
It's like straight up.

3105
01:59:03,489 --> 01:59:04,050
Oh, my God.

3106
01:59:04,050 --> 01:59:04,289
It is.

3107
01:59:04,850 --> 01:59:12,550
How did you get on top of that?

3108
01:59:13,189 --> 01:59:17,189
I lined it with my arm.

3109
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:21,880
Explain how microwaves work to Jerma.

3110
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:25,239
Literally, who knows how they work?

3111
01:59:25,239 --> 01:59:27,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3112
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,199
I have a question for you.

3113
01:59:28,199 --> 01:59:30,359
Don't listen to any of these jokers.

3114
01:59:30,359 --> 01:59:31,880
Any of these idiots.

3115
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:33,079
Listen to me.

3116
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:35,239
These morons, okay?

3117
01:59:35,239 --> 01:59:36,279
I have to make it very clear.

3118
01:59:36,279 --> 01:59:37,479
We got to get a baseline here.

3119
01:59:38,439 --> 01:59:40,520
So, when you microwave food...

3120
01:59:41,319 --> 01:59:42,680
I don't own a microwave.

3121
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:44,760
You don't own a microwave.

3122
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:46,130
I don't.

3123
01:59:46,130 --> 01:59:47,569
Why do you not own a microwave?

3124
01:59:48,369 --> 01:59:51,409
Because Gordon Ramsey would be really disappointed in me if I did.

3125
01:59:51,409 --> 01:59:52,529
So you have a microwave, fine.

3126
01:59:52,529 --> 01:59:53,890
When you can put something in the oven,

3127
01:59:54,689 --> 01:59:56,449
why not put it in the oven?

3128
01:59:56,449 --> 01:59:57,890
It takes like two hours.

3129
01:59:57,890 --> 01:59:58,770
It takes like an hour.

3130
01:59:59,569 --> 02:00:00,949
How do we climb?

3131
02:00:00,949 --> 02:00:02,149
What the fuck is going on?

3132
02:00:02,149 --> 02:00:02,649
Oh.

3133
02:00:03,590 --> 02:00:06,149
The Sonic and the Hedgehog shit is going on right now.

3134
02:00:06,149 --> 02:00:07,140
Okay.

3135
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:09,060
Well, anyways, you've used a microphone.

3136
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:15,239
Yeah, I've used my microphone a little bit.

3137
02:00:15,239 --> 02:00:17,239
So when you use your microwave oven,

3138
02:00:19,329 --> 02:00:20,130
when you do that...

3139
02:00:21,170 --> 02:00:22,369
Yeah, I do that.

3140
02:00:22,369 --> 02:00:22,869
Yes.

3141
02:00:23,329 --> 02:00:23,890
When you...

3142
02:00:23,890 --> 02:00:24,529
Okay, you put it in...

3143
02:00:24,529 --> 02:00:25,649
Let's say you put it in like popcorn.

3144
02:00:25,649 --> 02:00:26,130
It doesn't matter.

3145
02:00:26,130 --> 02:00:27,409
Someone's sneaking up on me.

3146
02:00:27,409 --> 02:00:28,930
Oh, it's behind you.

3147
02:00:29,489 --> 02:00:30,850
Okay, let's just theoretically say

3148
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:33,329
that I'm making my own popcorn in my microwave that I own.

3149
02:00:33,329 --> 02:00:33,970
Sure.

3150
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:34,470
You put it...

3151
02:00:37,170 --> 02:00:38,130
And it goes for like a minute.

3152
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:39,170
Yeah.

3153
02:00:39,170 --> 02:00:39,649
And you hear...

3154
02:00:40,529 --> 02:00:41,010
Right.

3155
02:00:41,010 --> 02:00:42,130
When it gets to zero,

3156
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:44,359
and you open it,

3157
02:00:45,399 --> 02:00:46,520
does that like...

3158
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:49,319
Would you put like putting your hand in there like right when it hits zero?

3159
02:00:50,130 --> 02:00:50,529
Don't you...

3160
02:00:50,529 --> 02:00:51,729
Isn't it like kind of weird?

3161
02:00:51,729 --> 02:00:52,289
Like that...

3162
02:00:53,399 --> 02:00:54,840
Isn't that like an odd thing?

3163
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:56,600
That like there was just radiation in there.

3164
02:00:57,239 --> 02:00:57,880
Zero, open.

3165
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:59,239
Oh, that's my popcorn.

3166
02:00:59,239 --> 02:01:00,439
Like isn't that kind of weird?

3167
02:01:01,079 --> 02:01:02,199
I've never thought about it,

3168
02:01:02,199 --> 02:01:03,000
but you know what?

3169
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:03,880
That is kind of weird.

3170
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:05,640
Like really think about that,

3171
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:06,279
but just a second.

3172
02:01:07,989 --> 02:01:11,750
Like the fact that like they may be like residual waves in there.

3173
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:12,470
Does it just go away?

3174
02:01:14,579 --> 02:01:19,000
I mean, I'm pretty sure if the microwave was on,

3175
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,199
your hand could be in it for like a second before like you would even...

3176
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:24,039
Microwaves are not radiation.

3177
02:01:24,039 --> 02:01:26,199
Yeah, but it's like radio waves.

3178
02:01:27,079 --> 02:01:32,420
That's not how it works.

3179
02:01:33,140 --> 02:01:33,939
Kids these days,

3180
02:01:33,939 --> 02:01:35,619
they just grow up trusting technology

3181
02:01:35,619 --> 02:01:36,739
because they didn't live through that.

3182
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:38,819
Like all the stuff that we did.

3183
02:01:39,619 --> 02:01:40,180
I'm just telling you.

3184
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:42,819
The radio with the announcement of the aliens.

3185
02:01:42,819 --> 02:01:43,220
What was that?

3186
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:44,020
The war of the world.

3187
02:01:44,899 --> 02:01:47,199
They like they didn't have that.

3188
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:50,470
They just trust stuff and we know to like

3189
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:52,789
to filter through and find what's real.

3190
02:01:52,789 --> 02:01:53,109
All right.

3191
02:01:53,109 --> 02:01:53,909
Hear the news.

3192
02:01:53,909 --> 02:01:57,590
Because most news these days is fake, honestly.

3193
02:01:57,590 --> 02:01:58,550
And okay.

3194
02:01:58,550 --> 02:02:00,789
Is it weird that there's a concept of the...

3195
02:02:00,789 --> 02:02:02,949
Is the microwave a weird appliance?

3196
02:02:02,949 --> 02:02:04,229
I want to buy something.

3197
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:06,069
The fridge is like a fridge.

3198
02:02:06,069 --> 02:02:08,159
It is cold in here.

3199
02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:12,159
An oven heats up with gas and heat, right?

3200
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:17,279
A microwave like zaps with fucking microwave radio waves

3201
02:02:17,279 --> 02:02:19,039
your food until it's like nuclear.

3202
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:21,039
It's kind of weird.

3203
02:02:21,039 --> 02:02:22,079
It's kind of a weird appliance.

3204
02:02:24,199 --> 02:02:25,159
That's why I don't own one.

3205
02:02:25,159 --> 02:02:26,680
And you were judging me for not having one.

3206
02:02:27,319 --> 02:02:30,720
We got to go all the way to the top

3207
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:31,680
and then you're going to jump off.

3208
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:32,640
And I'm going to laugh at it.

3209
02:02:35,220 --> 02:02:36,659
That's the end of the conversation.

3210
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:38,260
He's running away.

3211
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:39,380
Wait, who's running away?

3212
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:46,340
We have one minute and 15 seconds to go this way.

3213
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:48,960
So we got to go up.

3214
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,840
Where did you go?

3215
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:50,640
We're going up.

3216
02:03:05,329 --> 02:03:07,250
It was a timer in front of me.

3217
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:10,770
It said one minute 15 on a marker all the way across the map.

3218
02:03:12,369 --> 02:03:13,170
Oh, there is.

3219
02:03:13,170 --> 02:03:13,489
What?

3220
02:03:13,489 --> 02:03:14,130
Wait, what?

3221
02:03:14,130 --> 02:03:15,569
I'm not crazy, right?

3222
02:03:15,569 --> 02:03:16,529
Am I crazy?

3223
02:03:16,529 --> 02:03:18,449
There's a red circle pointing me up here.

3224
02:03:20,079 --> 02:03:21,359
All players require.

3225
02:03:21,359 --> 02:03:23,840
What are you going to come help me?

3226
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:27,680
How do you think your Wi-Fi router works?

3227
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:28,960
I don't know.

3228
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:30,159
That's fucking weird, too.

3229
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,949
You know, that's weird.

3230
02:03:32,949 --> 02:03:34,949
We can communicate like with nothing.

3231
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:36,149
No wires.

3232
02:03:36,149 --> 02:03:37,270
Dude just fell off.

3233
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:37,989
What are you doing?

3234
02:03:39,029 --> 02:03:40,069
Where am I?

3235
02:03:40,069 --> 02:03:42,310
Why am I on the top of a construction site?

3236
02:03:46,979 --> 02:03:48,180
I fast traveled you.

3237
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:52,500
I didn't realize I got 10 seconds to.

3238
02:03:57,699 --> 02:03:58,340
OK, anyways.

3239
02:03:59,220 --> 02:04:00,020
Yeah, we felt that.

3240
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:03,079
Anyways, we got to pull back a little.

3241
02:04:04,869 --> 02:04:09,510
I'm not saying that there's something wrong with like radio waves.

3242
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:13,189
I'm not saying that like your phone and wireless signals are weird.

3243
02:04:13,189 --> 02:04:16,710
I'm just saying it's kind of odd like that we have this technology,

3244
02:04:16,710 --> 02:04:20,470
but we can be able to do stuff without wires and cords and stuff.

3245
02:04:20,470 --> 02:04:21,430
He's running away.

3246
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:22,149
OK, we got to go.

3247
02:04:23,350 --> 02:04:23,510
All right.

3248
02:04:23,510 --> 02:04:24,630
So how do we get down safely?

3249
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:26,869
I see you.

3250
02:04:26,869 --> 02:04:29,189
What you're saying is you also similar to me,

3251
02:04:29,189 --> 02:04:31,430
this man of culture do not trust 5G.

3252
02:04:34,039 --> 02:04:35,239
No, I don't look.

3253
02:04:36,199 --> 02:04:37,159
You want to have this conversation?

3254
02:04:38,239 --> 02:04:38,720
Here we go.

3255
02:04:41,699 --> 02:04:42,659
When is it going to be enough?

3256
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:47,119
How many when is it?

3257
02:04:47,119 --> 02:04:50,159
When is it going to be enough for you to sit on the toilet and go on Twitter?

3258
02:04:50,159 --> 02:04:51,439
How many G's do we need?

3259
02:04:51,439 --> 02:04:52,239
When is it going to be enough?

3260
02:04:53,319 --> 02:04:55,239
Are you saying like we already have enough G's?

3261
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:57,720
Do we need like 8G?

3262
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:01,569
I mean, has your phone ever disconnected before

3263
02:05:01,569 --> 02:05:03,409
and you were like, oh, I don't think I can go on living.

3264
02:05:09,670 --> 02:05:10,310
10G.

3265
02:05:11,109 --> 02:05:13,670
What is a G?

3266
02:05:14,470 --> 02:05:17,489
It's a gigabit band of wireless information.

3267
02:05:18,130 --> 02:05:20,520
Just said a few words that I thought sounded good.

3268
02:05:22,739 --> 02:05:26,949
Am I there?

3269
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:28,310
He's not here.

3270
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:31,590
Why do we still have 14 seconds?

3271
02:05:41,399 --> 02:05:41,960
Climbing up this?

3272
02:05:43,199 --> 02:05:44,000
We failed the mission.

3273
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:46,319
No, I got here, but you climbed up this.

3274
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:47,039
We got to climb this.

3275
02:05:54,850 --> 02:05:55,329
Hey, man.

3276
02:05:56,210 --> 02:05:58,529
Yeah, we got to climb up this.

3277
02:05:59,250 --> 02:06:00,529
How are we supposed to do that?

3278
02:06:08,229 --> 02:06:09,750
Fucking grab something.

3279
02:06:12,439 --> 02:06:13,560
You're like, oh my.

3280
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:13,800
Okay.

3281
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:16,500
I thought you were going to fall through.

3282
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:18,840
That looks so funny.

3283
02:06:22,279 --> 02:06:22,680
Nice.

3284
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:23,079
Good job.

3285
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:25,960
Okay, we got to climb.

3286
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:29,399
I'm not like anti 5G.

3287
02:06:29,399 --> 02:06:31,960
I'm just saying it's crazy that we have this technology.

3288
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:33,640
Who gave the aliens gave it to us?

3289
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:34,760
All right, I'm going to fall on.

3290
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:35,800
You want to hear what I really think?

3291
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:37,359
I do.

3292
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:45,079
Wow, they silenced you that quick.

3293
02:06:48,069 --> 02:06:49,590
Like in real time.

3294
02:06:49,590 --> 02:06:54,449
I was going to hold that longer,

3295
02:06:54,449 --> 02:06:55,170
but I feel like that would hurt.

3296
02:06:55,170 --> 02:06:56,369
It was really loud.

3297
02:06:56,369 --> 02:06:56,930
Was it loud?

3298
02:06:57,569 --> 02:06:57,970
It was.

3299
02:06:57,970 --> 02:06:58,289
Yeah.

3300
02:06:58,289 --> 02:06:58,850
Oh my God.

3301
02:06:58,850 --> 02:06:59,649
It wasn't supposed to be.

3302
02:07:00,369 --> 02:07:05,399
Well, you know, I'm dying now.

3303
02:07:05,399 --> 02:07:06,600
Is this guy's name Tuber?

3304
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:09,409
It's Hubert.

3305
02:07:09,409 --> 02:07:10,050
Oh, I just heard.

3306
02:07:10,050 --> 02:07:10,609
Hey, Tuber.

3307
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:20,689
That's a restricted area.

3308
02:07:22,819 --> 02:07:23,460
Yeah, watch out.

3309
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:24,739
That's it.

3310
02:07:25,380 --> 02:07:27,619
Will you get a glue onto something?

3311
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:28,899
Oh, it's this way.

3312
02:07:37,479 --> 02:07:38,039
Wait, where?

3313
02:07:38,039 --> 02:07:38,760
Where?

3314
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:40,390
When you get close.

3315
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:41,989
I think it's just we just find him, right?

3316
02:07:42,710 --> 02:07:43,829
There's a door here.

3317
02:07:43,829 --> 02:07:44,470
He's right here.

3318
02:07:45,189 --> 02:07:45,989
You fucking.

3319
02:07:45,989 --> 02:07:46,550
Is this you?

3320
02:07:48,229 --> 02:07:49,350
Is this you Tuber?

3321
02:07:49,350 --> 02:07:49,989
Is this Tuber?

3322
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:51,880
What are you doing, Tuber?

3323
02:07:54,039 --> 02:07:54,439
I don't know.

3324
02:07:56,199 --> 02:07:58,819
Why'd you run away then?

3325
02:07:58,819 --> 02:08:01,220
Is it the light has a higher frequency than microwaves?

3326
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:03,619
I know I look.

3327
02:08:03,619 --> 02:08:05,300
I don't have a problem with microwave ovens.

3328
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:07,060
I'm just saying I like they kind of scare me a little.

3329
02:08:08,069 --> 02:08:09,270
You know what scares me?

3330
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:12,310
And people always make fun of me for but magnets.

3331
02:08:13,890 --> 02:08:18,289
I'm terrified of putting a magnet like anywhere near my computer.

3332
02:08:18,289 --> 02:08:19,649
So I don't want any magnet.

3333
02:08:22,239 --> 02:08:24,239
They have like metal cases for your computer.

3334
02:08:24,239 --> 02:08:26,640
And it's like, oh, you could put like it was like magnet for your course.

3335
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:28,079
They're like magnet on your computer.

3336
02:08:28,079 --> 02:08:28,640
I'm like, isn't it?

3337
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:32,079
You put a magnet to a TV like what happened with that?

3338
02:08:32,079 --> 02:08:33,119
Shit went south.

3339
02:08:33,119 --> 02:08:35,119
Yeah, everyone's saying fair, fair.

3340
02:08:35,119 --> 02:08:36,399
You're afraid of magnets.

3341
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:40,560
Okay, and I and I like don't like microwaves kind of freak me out.

3342
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:42,079
But like you're afraid of magnets.

3343
02:08:42,079 --> 02:08:44,640
But people are saying true, fair, fair.

3344
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:45,520
That's true, true, true.

3345
02:08:46,659 --> 02:08:48,899
I don't like because, okay, we were at PAX East once.

3346
02:08:48,899 --> 02:08:50,260
And this guy was like, hey, promoting my game.

3347
02:08:50,260 --> 02:08:51,779
I think it was like Starbound or something like that.

3348
02:08:51,779 --> 02:08:53,539
He's like, here we got like magnets for it.

3349
02:08:53,539 --> 02:08:55,859
And I was like, dude, I don't want your fucking gamer magnet.

3350
02:08:55,859 --> 02:08:56,979
I want that anywhere near my computer.

3351
02:08:56,979 --> 02:09:01,439
And he was like really weirded out.

3352
02:09:01,439 --> 02:09:03,279
I don't want that near my computer.

3353
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:05,680
Yeah, I can't believe you're getting trued.

3354
02:09:06,159 --> 02:09:09,810
Okay, this is you're getting true, true.

3355
02:09:09,810 --> 02:09:10,449
Oh, yeah, true.

3356
02:09:10,449 --> 02:09:11,890
Well, like I'm not afraid.

3357
02:09:11,890 --> 02:09:14,130
My computer is accidentally going to go in a microwave.

3358
02:09:15,250 --> 02:09:20,689
I think they're both valid opinions to have.

3359
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:22,210
Even though you're okay.

3360
02:09:22,770 --> 02:09:23,890
You're not afraid of magnets.

3361
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:28,689
You just don't want them near your computer or my head.

3362
02:09:28,689 --> 02:09:29,010
Yes.

3363
02:09:29,010 --> 02:09:29,569
Or your head.

3364
02:09:29,569 --> 02:09:31,170
Like, okay, mess with your brain waves.

3365
02:09:31,170 --> 02:09:34,770
If you were to take a magnet and put it and put it next to your head,

3366
02:09:34,770 --> 02:09:35,409
would you do that?

3367
02:09:39,909 --> 02:09:42,149
I have to figure out what your level of fear is.

3368
02:09:42,710 --> 02:09:43,350
You know what?

3369
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:44,630
I don't think I would.

3370
02:09:44,630 --> 02:09:46,149
This sounds really weird.

3371
02:09:46,149 --> 02:09:48,550
Like, if it was a really strong magnet and you were just like,

3372
02:09:48,550 --> 02:09:49,590
you put this near your head.

3373
02:09:49,590 --> 02:09:51,829
Like, sometimes I sit on my phone and I'm like,

3374
02:09:51,829 --> 02:09:53,430
are my balls being cooked right now?

3375
02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:55,109
Like, I don't legitimately think they are,

3376
02:09:55,109 --> 02:09:58,579
but it kind of makes you think like, why take the risk?

3377
02:09:58,579 --> 02:10:02,600
Okay, so yeah, so you don't really like them.

3378
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:05,159
You don't really, you're not like, you know, you know, you don't,

3379
02:10:05,159 --> 02:10:05,800
you know, they work.

3380
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:06,439
You know what they do.

3381
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:10,279
But you don't make fan like of having them around, right?

3382
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:13,720
Yeah, I figured like, why bother with magnets?

3383
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:16,720
I feel like we don't need magnets.

3384
02:10:17,439 --> 02:10:19,359
There are detriments to magnets.

3385
02:10:20,079 --> 02:10:21,840
Okay, the, the, the true people,

3386
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:23,920
the people that were saying true are have you've lost them.

3387
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:28,000
So I'm good at losing them.

3388
02:10:31,270 --> 02:10:33,270
Chad, anyone who's watching this stream right now,

3389
02:10:33,270 --> 02:10:35,590
take your cellular, your cellular device.

3390
02:10:35,590 --> 02:10:36,149
Let me make it.

3391
02:10:36,149 --> 02:10:37,029
Don't do anything.

3392
02:10:37,029 --> 02:10:37,670
He said on it.

3393
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:38,310
Don't do anything.

3394
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:39,270
He says, don't do anything.

3395
02:10:39,270 --> 02:10:39,670
He ever said.

3396
02:10:39,670 --> 02:10:42,229
Place it right underneath your crotch and just sit on your phone.

3397
02:10:42,229 --> 02:10:42,869
Don't do anything.

3398
02:10:42,869 --> 02:10:43,510
He ever says.

3399
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:44,869
This is a big disclaimer.

3400
02:10:44,869 --> 02:10:46,789
This is the, I do not condone anything he tells you to do.

3401
02:10:50,479 --> 02:10:51,199
We need to go down.

3402
02:10:51,199 --> 02:10:55,409
There's a, I want to jump.

3403
02:10:55,409 --> 02:10:57,090
I'm not afraid of microwaves.

3404
02:10:57,090 --> 02:10:58,850
I just, they, they, they're a little weird.

3405
02:10:58,850 --> 02:10:59,329
That's it.

3406
02:10:59,329 --> 02:11:00,289
That's the only argument.

3407
02:11:01,489 --> 02:11:12,319
Oh, I, I have to get down there too, man.

3408
02:11:13,199 --> 02:11:14,079
How am I going to do that?

3409
02:11:14,979 --> 02:11:15,779
Climb.

3410
02:11:15,779 --> 02:11:21,829
Holy shit.

3411
02:11:21,829 --> 02:11:22,949
Okay, we're good.

3412
02:11:22,949 --> 02:11:28,130
Help me.

3413
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:29,090
Why would it be R?

3414
02:11:29,890 --> 02:11:33,250
I really thought you'd let me die.

3415
02:11:34,579 --> 02:11:43,319
Okay.

3416
02:11:43,319 --> 02:11:44,439
Can you follow me?

3417
02:11:44,439 --> 02:11:44,680
Yes.

3418
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:48,229
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

3419
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:49,989
Just follow me.

3420
02:11:50,789 --> 02:11:58,100
You know, people are coming in my chat sometimes and are still mad that I,

3421
02:11:58,100 --> 02:11:59,699
I dragged you through Terraria too quickly.

3422
02:12:00,659 --> 02:12:00,899
What?

3423
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:05,140
It's like an ongoing disappointment in some people's lives.

3424
02:12:06,180 --> 02:12:10,520
Well, because you like played Terraria while I watched.

3425
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:12,420
Yeah.

3426
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:17,380
I crafted like a, I crafted like a bow and arrow and you beat the game for me.

3427
02:12:18,390 --> 02:12:19,270
Yeah, but it was a good time.

3428
02:12:19,270 --> 02:12:20,229
It was a good, I had a great time.

3429
02:12:20,229 --> 02:12:20,869
Yeah, that was fun.

3430
02:12:20,869 --> 02:12:21,750
People were mad about that.

3431
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:22,550
Yeah.

3432
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:25,189
Like he didn't get to enjoy it himself.

3433
02:12:25,189 --> 02:12:25,510
I did.

3434
02:12:25,510 --> 02:12:25,989
No, it was great.

3435
02:12:26,789 --> 02:12:28,770
I played Terraria, Terraria a little bit.

3436
02:12:30,130 --> 02:12:31,170
Not with all the mods.

3437
02:12:31,810 --> 02:12:32,529
I had a great time.

3438
02:12:32,529 --> 02:12:33,090
That was a lot of fun.

3439
02:12:35,399 --> 02:12:36,680
I'm not, I'm not buying it.

3440
02:12:39,039 --> 02:12:39,520
Nice dude.

3441
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:41,909
How does stamina work?

3442
02:12:42,630 --> 02:12:46,579
Did you also not, you couldn't do it?

3443
02:12:48,979 --> 02:12:50,100
Hey, let me know.

3444
02:12:50,100 --> 02:12:53,220
Tell me if you think I did or didn't buy how loud my Ernie laugh is.

3445
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:54,979
Hey, I can't do this.

3446
02:12:57,189 --> 02:12:57,430
Okay.

3447
02:12:57,430 --> 02:12:58,550
We need to find another way up.

3448
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,600
Uh, jump fence.

3449
02:13:10,710 --> 02:13:11,029
We're good.

3450
02:13:11,029 --> 02:13:11,430
We're good.

3451
02:13:11,430 --> 02:13:12,079
We're good.

3452
02:13:12,079 --> 02:13:12,399
You good?

3453
02:13:13,039 --> 02:13:13,920
We're good.

3454
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:18,319
Oh, we got one of the, I heard the inhibitor nearby thing.

3455
02:13:18,319 --> 02:13:19,840
We actually need to start doing that.

3456
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:20,960
Yeah.

3457
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:21,680
12 meters.

3458
02:13:22,479 --> 02:13:25,109
It's right, it's right this way.

3459
02:13:26,079 --> 02:13:27,199
You really did play Terraria.

3460
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:29,039
Name the main character, Thomas Terraria.

3461
02:13:29,039 --> 02:13:29,359
Thank you.

3462
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:36,550
There's a person up here.

3463
02:13:43,220 --> 02:13:44,579
Oh, there's a window down here.

3464
02:13:44,579 --> 02:13:45,140
We can go in.

3465
02:13:46,739 --> 02:13:56,399
Someone's screaming.

3466
02:13:57,039 --> 02:13:58,079
Someone's screaming down here.

3467
02:13:58,979 --> 02:13:59,380
Screaming.

3468
02:13:59,939 --> 02:14:02,199
Someone's in danger.

3469
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:03,079
Hurry.

3470
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:04,880
Loot this.

3471
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:06,680
Lots of stuff to loot.

3472
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:07,319
You're right.

3473
02:14:07,319 --> 02:14:08,279
I'm gonna gestalt it.

3474
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:11,779
I hear screaming.

3475
02:14:12,739 --> 02:14:13,619
I don't hear any screaming.

3476
02:14:13,619 --> 02:14:14,819
Where do you hear screaming?

3477
02:14:14,819 --> 02:14:17,810
Oh, now I do.

3478
02:14:20,449 --> 02:14:23,989
A shithole indeed.

3479
02:14:24,630 --> 02:14:26,630
Did you keep going down?

3480
02:14:27,430 --> 02:14:29,590
I think the inhibitor might be in here somewhere.

3481
02:14:29,989 --> 02:14:30,869
Yeah, it's definitely in here somewhere.

3482
02:14:31,430 --> 02:14:40,739
I'm using gamer vision.

3483
02:14:40,739 --> 02:14:41,460
Where did you go?

3484
02:14:42,020 --> 02:14:43,699
I'm still in the house looking around.

3485
02:14:43,699 --> 02:14:45,699
Oh, there's a, we can climb up here.

3486
02:14:45,699 --> 02:14:46,260
We can go up?

3487
02:14:46,899 --> 02:14:47,699
Yeah, I found it.

3488
02:14:48,579 --> 02:14:53,510
Oh, shit.

3489
02:14:53,510 --> 02:14:53,750
Yep.

3490
02:14:54,390 --> 02:15:00,000
Okay.

3491
02:15:01,909 --> 02:15:03,350
Who is running around up here?

3492
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:06,880
Someone had neighbors, huge footsteps.

3493
02:15:08,260 --> 02:15:09,779
Oh, there's a gamer up here.

3494
02:15:11,090 --> 02:15:11,729
Oh, gamers.

3495
02:15:11,729 --> 02:15:13,170
Oh, it's these two?

3496
02:15:13,170 --> 02:15:14,449
We're making all that noise?

3497
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,800
Kids, I'm looking for a woman named Maya.

3498
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:25,909
They were so funny.

3499
02:15:26,979 --> 02:15:28,020
Ain't a grown-up.

3500
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:31,010
She's just a-

3501
02:15:31,010 --> 02:15:34,130
You were the one trying to sell a PK weapon to Hubert?

3502
02:15:34,770 --> 02:15:37,010
Yeah, but the jerk didn't want it.

3503
02:15:37,010 --> 02:15:39,010
Got all freaked out and chased me away.

3504
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:42,140
Okay.

3505
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:44,199
What is she holding?

3506
02:15:44,199 --> 02:15:45,640
Is she holding a grenade?

3507
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:46,520
Yeah, it's a grenade.

3508
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:46,840
What?

3509
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:47,720
It's very important.

3510
02:15:47,720 --> 02:15:48,220
Yeah.

3511
02:15:48,279 --> 02:15:52,199
Do you expect me to just hand that brass Whozzy Whatzit over?

3512
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:54,119
The Whozzy Whatzit's-

3513
02:15:54,119 --> 02:15:55,079
Oh, it's powder.

3514
02:15:56,279 --> 02:15:56,779
Stop it.

3515
02:15:57,500 --> 02:15:58,000
I can't.

3516
02:15:59,020 --> 02:16:11,829
I just scolded you like we were on a road trip and you're like one of my kids in the car.

3517
02:16:13,350 --> 02:16:15,189
And I'm sick of how like loud you're being.

3518
02:16:15,189 --> 02:16:16,149
Stop it.

3519
02:16:16,149 --> 02:16:16,649
Stop it.

3520
02:16:17,109 --> 02:16:17,609
Enough.

3521
02:16:18,229 --> 02:16:19,739
Okay.

3522
02:16:22,539 --> 02:16:26,380
So, report to Ator.

3523
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:28,409
We need to get that.

3524
02:16:30,090 --> 02:16:30,649
I got a point.

3525
02:16:30,649 --> 02:16:31,210
Did you get a point?

3526
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:34,340
No.

3527
02:16:34,340 --> 02:16:34,819
You should have.

3528
02:16:34,819 --> 02:16:37,059
I mean, I got to do the stamina point?

3529
02:16:37,059 --> 02:16:37,620
Yeah.

3530
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:39,139
I don't know what to put it in.

3531
02:16:39,139 --> 02:16:41,579
Stamina or health?

3532
02:16:42,780 --> 02:16:43,739
I did stamina.

3533
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:45,219
I don't know.

3534
02:16:45,219 --> 02:16:47,770
Stamina's probably more important.

3535
02:16:47,770 --> 02:16:49,770
Are you a tank or are you a bruiser?

3536
02:16:49,770 --> 02:16:53,799
I'm gonna do stamina.

3537
02:16:53,799 --> 02:16:56,280
Just feel like you really need that health.

3538
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:56,920
Look at the health bar.

3539
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:57,559
It's so tiny though.

3540
02:16:58,950 --> 02:16:59,829
Yeah, just don't get hit.

3541
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:04,569
We got to go do-

3542
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:10,040
Oh, you want water, by the way.

3543
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:10,520
Have you had some?

3544
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:11,319
Cool.

3545
02:17:11,319 --> 02:17:12,840
Get your ass to Ator with you.

3546
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:14,200
No, I haven't had any water.

3547
02:17:15,479 --> 02:17:17,559
I have no idea when that prick was born.

3548
02:17:17,559 --> 02:17:18,120
I was dead.

3549
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:19,799
I'll be near metro station.

3550
02:17:19,799 --> 02:17:20,299
Okay.

3551
02:17:27,639 --> 02:17:29,239
Will you tell them to stop sitting on their phones?

3552
02:17:30,340 --> 02:17:31,139
Are they doing it?

3553
02:17:31,139 --> 02:17:31,620
I don't know.

3554
02:17:31,620 --> 02:17:34,659
But you tell people to stop doing the thing you said.

3555
02:17:34,659 --> 02:17:36,100
Do they want to have kids?

3556
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:36,420
Stop.

3557
02:17:36,979 --> 02:17:38,149
Tell them to stop.

3558
02:17:39,450 --> 02:17:40,170
Guys, come on.

3559
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:40,489
Stop.

3560
02:17:40,489 --> 02:17:41,770
If you want to have kids, stop.

3561
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:42,489
But you really shouldn't.

3562
02:17:42,489 --> 02:17:43,690
There's enough people in the world.

3563
02:17:46,579 --> 02:17:47,780
There's an airdrop over there.

3564
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:49,459
Military airdrop.

3565
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:52,379
We should go do that.

3566
02:17:52,379 --> 02:17:53,819
There might be like a gun there.

3567
02:17:53,819 --> 02:17:56,149
Let's do it.

3568
02:17:56,709 --> 02:17:57,670
We should do it.

3569
02:17:57,670 --> 02:17:59,110
We did two main story missions.

3570
02:17:59,110 --> 02:17:59,610
We're good.

3571
02:18:00,069 --> 02:18:00,569
Yeah, let's go.

3572
02:18:01,430 --> 02:18:14,440
Up on that roof across the way here.

3573
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:23,540
Oh, I'm actually murdering.

3574
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:26,520
I'll get these shrooms.

3575
02:18:32,149 --> 02:18:32,950
If you were to give this game.

3576
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:33,670
Wait, wait, wait.

3577
02:18:33,670 --> 02:18:34,389
Why is it all green?

3578
02:18:35,190 --> 02:18:36,180
It's green.

3579
02:18:37,219 --> 02:18:38,020
Where's this coming from?

3580
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:38,420
Chemicals?

3581
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:38,819
Poison?

3582
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:41,139
We're poisoned right now?

3583
02:18:41,139 --> 02:18:41,620
We got to go.

3584
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:42,899
We're going to get our immunity.

3585
02:18:42,899 --> 02:18:43,940
The whole shroom thing.

3586
02:18:43,940 --> 02:18:44,180
Yep.

3587
02:18:44,180 --> 02:18:44,500
Yep.

3588
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:44,739
Yep.

3589
02:18:44,739 --> 02:18:44,979
Yep.

3590
02:18:44,979 --> 02:18:45,219
Yep.

3591
02:18:45,219 --> 02:18:45,540
Yep.

3592
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:49,659
You were going to you're about to ask me like a thing.

3593
02:18:49,659 --> 02:18:50,299
Oh, right.

3594
02:18:51,260 --> 02:18:51,579
Okay.

3595
02:18:51,579 --> 02:18:53,579
You would have scored this game one out of a thousand.

3596
02:18:55,180 --> 02:18:55,899
What would you give it?

3597
02:18:56,540 --> 02:19:00,329
Are we doing like Yu-Gi-Oh numbers for scores?

3598
02:19:01,299 --> 02:19:04,899
Well, just imagine like it's like an experience points you can put in

3599
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:09,459
and getting to one thousand points levels you up to a one out of ten.

3600
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:13,399
I'm more confused now.

3601
02:19:13,399 --> 02:19:17,059
So so is it a score out of ten thousand?

3602
02:19:19,750 --> 02:19:23,510
No, I mean, like, do you want to put enough experience points in the games to be like,

3603
02:19:23,510 --> 02:19:24,629
yeah, I'm going to give this a rating.

3604
02:19:27,979 --> 02:19:30,940
There's parts of it that I feel like dying light one did better.

3605
02:19:30,940 --> 02:19:32,219
But overall, it's a good game.

3606
02:19:32,219 --> 02:19:34,219
I could give it like a nine thousand.

3607
02:19:34,219 --> 02:19:34,719
Okay.

3608
02:19:35,260 --> 02:19:40,420
An eight thousand before I, you know, we haven't even seen grappling hooks or.

3609
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:43,540
So you need to take a long time to level up, honestly.

3610
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:44,020
So wait a minute.

3611
02:19:44,020 --> 02:19:49,379
So you have eight hundred points out of a thousand into being ready to review the game.

3612
02:19:49,379 --> 02:19:50,100
Is that correct?

3613
02:19:51,139 --> 02:19:54,899
Oh, you're saying like how how leveled up is my review?

3614
02:19:54,899 --> 02:19:55,620
Yes.

3615
02:19:55,620 --> 02:19:57,459
Not the score of the review.

3616
02:19:57,459 --> 02:20:00,420
No, like you need a thousand experience points in the game.

3617
02:20:00,420 --> 02:20:01,940
Like how much do you have right now?

3618
02:20:03,139 --> 02:20:03,620
Eight hundred.

3619
02:20:04,420 --> 02:20:05,379
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3620
02:20:05,379 --> 02:20:06,819
I would say I have like two hundred.

3621
02:20:06,819 --> 02:20:10,819
If we dropped it down to easy, then I would get like a journalist bonus of like five hundred.

3622
02:20:11,700 --> 02:20:12,200
Oh, OK.

3623
02:20:12,819 --> 02:20:14,219
I can feel you.

3624
02:20:21,219 --> 02:20:21,940
What are we doing here?

3625
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:24,500
I'm just looking at the.

3626
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:28,180
I'm just looking at the chat and people are just like,

3627
02:20:28,180 --> 02:20:29,780
I have no idea what's fucking happening.

3628
02:20:30,659 --> 02:20:33,059
I barely know what's happening and you're talking to me.

3629
02:20:44,309 --> 02:20:44,950
I know what you're saying.

3630
02:20:44,950 --> 02:20:47,829
The experience bar on are you ready to review this game or not?

3631
02:20:47,829 --> 02:20:49,909
It's like a two hundred out of a thousand right now.

3632
02:20:49,909 --> 02:20:51,750
And you're not going to play anything.

3633
02:20:51,750 --> 02:20:55,190
You are not going to play like the five hundred hours that it takes to beat this game.

3634
02:20:55,829 --> 02:20:56,149
Yeah.

3635
02:20:56,149 --> 02:20:58,069
So like, what's what's my cut off?

3636
02:20:58,889 --> 02:20:59,850
That's for you to decide.

3637
02:20:59,850 --> 02:21:03,370
Whatever you when you whenever you're like, I'm like a two hundred right now.

3638
02:21:04,420 --> 02:21:05,860
This area is weird.

3639
02:21:05,860 --> 02:21:06,739
You have to go up this way.

3640
02:21:07,459 --> 02:21:15,909
I think this is the Ubisoft Climb Climb upper.

3641
02:21:15,909 --> 02:21:17,510
And there's a bunch of stuff up there, though.

3642
02:21:18,149 --> 02:21:21,270
I don't see any way outside here.

3643
02:21:21,989 --> 02:21:24,459
Oh, my immunity.

3644
02:21:24,459 --> 02:21:25,500
I'm getting whipped.

3645
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:26,459
Oh, this is actually really bad.

3646
02:21:27,420 --> 02:21:31,030
Remember, this is the kind of conversation you have to huffing fumes.

3647
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:33,500
And I've been huffing.

3648
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:35,260
What's wrong?

3649
02:21:35,260 --> 02:21:39,719
Oh, we I think we've kind of run out of time here.

3650
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:44,149
Oh, I mean, I have shroomies.

3651
02:21:47,319 --> 02:21:49,540
It looks like from here.

3652
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:54,520
Hold on.

3653
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:56,120
We're trying to get to the top of this building.

3654
02:21:56,680 --> 02:21:57,899
What about on this side?

3655
02:21:59,899 --> 02:22:02,219
Is that platform right here on top of me?

3656
02:22:02,219 --> 02:22:03,100
How do we get to that one?

3657
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:08,219
Kind of worried that maybe we don't have like

3658
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:09,979
an ability for it.

3659
02:22:09,979 --> 02:22:11,899
Oh, wait, the metroidvania.

3660
02:22:11,899 --> 02:22:13,500
Yeah, I think there's a way to get up over here.

3661
02:22:14,469 --> 02:22:15,190
Yeah, there is.

3662
02:22:15,190 --> 02:22:15,670
Come to me.

3663
02:22:16,309 --> 02:22:17,270
Fucking Jesus.

3664
02:22:17,829 --> 02:22:19,510
I actually almost just shit my pants.

3665
02:22:19,510 --> 02:22:19,989
I'm serious.

3666
02:22:20,709 --> 02:22:21,829
I just almost jumped off.

3667
02:22:21,829 --> 02:22:23,829
I like the same thing.

3668
02:22:23,829 --> 02:22:24,389
That's right.

3669
02:22:24,870 --> 02:22:25,909
I'm not crazy.

3670
02:22:27,379 --> 02:22:32,729
Yeah, but like now from here, we can keep going.

3671
02:22:32,729 --> 02:22:33,209
Just keep going.

3672
02:22:34,629 --> 02:22:35,750
We fully wrapped around.

3673
02:22:35,750 --> 02:22:37,030
OK, we go up here.

3674
02:22:37,030 --> 02:22:40,549
Here we go.

3675
02:22:40,549 --> 02:22:43,790
Nice.

3676
02:22:47,799 --> 02:22:49,479
We're going up to the top all the way.

3677
02:22:49,479 --> 02:22:51,879
There should be a cache up here.

3678
02:23:01,219 --> 02:23:01,780
Not this way.

3679
02:23:02,790 --> 02:23:04,149
Oh, we got to do some jumpies.

3680
02:23:04,709 --> 02:23:05,270
Oh, great.

3681
02:23:08,540 --> 02:23:09,100
It'll be worth it.

3682
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:09,739
Whatever's in here.

3683
02:23:10,540 --> 02:23:12,139
I have no more shrooms left.

3684
02:23:12,139 --> 02:23:12,620
We got to go.

3685
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:14,780
I've got shrooms if you really need them.

3686
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:18,100
I collected the artifact, the ancient artifact

3687
02:23:18,100 --> 02:23:19,540
left behind by predecessors.

3688
02:23:25,180 --> 02:23:26,459
You can hide under this table if you want.

3689
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:30,139
There's a lot of them here.

3690
02:23:30,139 --> 02:23:31,420
I wonder if somebody chases you.

3691
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:40,760
Oh, my God.

3692
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:41,479
What?

3693
02:23:41,479 --> 02:23:43,079
Apparently, you can walk on that.

3694
02:23:43,079 --> 02:23:43,479
You can.

3695
02:23:46,780 --> 02:23:48,219
Oh, that was crazy.

3696
02:23:48,219 --> 02:23:49,420
I can't believe you actually made that.

3697
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:56,409
All right, I'm fine.

3698
02:23:58,040 --> 02:23:59,000
I know you've waited.

3699
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,159
You're turning the camera back because you know,

3700
02:24:01,159 --> 02:24:01,799
you're like, here goes.

3701
02:24:01,799 --> 02:24:02,120
You're going to fall.

3702
02:24:03,129 --> 02:24:04,969
I just want to make sure my little bro's making it.

3703
02:24:04,969 --> 02:24:06,329
Like, make sure powder is all right.

3704
02:24:07,610 --> 02:24:08,569
All right, here we are.

3705
02:24:09,129 --> 02:24:13,350
OK, right here.

3706
02:24:13,350 --> 02:24:14,819
Whatever this is.

3707
02:24:15,459 --> 02:24:19,319
Hey, are you about to turn, man?

3708
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:21,319
No, I'm good.

3709
02:24:21,319 --> 02:24:26,809
I think I have immunity boosters.

3710
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:30,409
Military airdrop, military tech.

3711
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:34,500
Oh, OK.

3712
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:35,620
We got military tech.

3713
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:38,500
Is this an immunity booster?

3714
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:40,979
You go to a craft master to upgrade your tools.

3715
02:24:40,979 --> 02:24:42,100
I need my tools.

3716
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:43,379
OK, so that's an immunity booster.

3717
02:24:43,379 --> 02:24:44,340
I think I'll be here.

3718
02:24:44,340 --> 02:24:44,899
Yeah, all right.

3719
02:24:44,899 --> 02:24:47,139
So the immunity booster fills up your immunity bar completely.

3720
02:24:47,860 --> 02:24:49,799
OK.

3721
02:24:49,799 --> 02:24:51,079
The inhaler, the purple inhaler.

3722
02:24:51,639 --> 02:24:54,379
Where's the assassin's creed?

3723
02:24:54,379 --> 02:24:54,860
Jump down.

3724
02:24:54,860 --> 02:24:55,979
Is that the only thing that was up here?

3725
02:24:56,860 --> 02:24:57,360
Yeah.

3726
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:03,020
Like a zipline or a...

3727
02:25:03,739 --> 02:25:05,020
You would think there would be something like that here,

3728
02:25:05,020 --> 02:25:06,840
but apparently not.

3729
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:07,719
What the fuck?

3730
02:25:07,719 --> 02:25:09,399
I thought you just turned into Wally on my screen.

3731
02:25:09,399 --> 02:25:09,899
That was weird.

3732
02:25:12,090 --> 02:25:12,590
Yeah.

3733
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:14,100
OK.

3734
02:25:18,889 --> 02:25:19,610
It really should be.

3735
02:25:20,569 --> 02:25:21,819
Here we go.

3736
02:25:21,819 --> 02:25:22,379
They're right here.

3737
02:25:22,940 --> 02:25:23,809
OK.

3738
02:25:24,110 --> 02:25:25,040
You ready?

3739
02:25:25,579 --> 02:25:26,059
You're doing?

3740
02:25:26,059 --> 02:25:26,940
Oh my god, you're doing it.

3741
02:25:26,940 --> 02:25:29,500
No, there's an assassin's creed thing right here.

3742
02:25:30,059 --> 02:25:31,209
OK, go for it.

3743
02:25:34,010 --> 02:25:34,729
Made it.

3744
02:25:34,729 --> 02:25:35,229
OK.

3745
02:25:35,229 --> 02:25:44,319
I'm critical.

3746
02:25:44,319 --> 02:25:45,040
Are you actually?

3747
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:47,840
Do you have help?

3748
02:25:50,909 --> 02:25:51,549
Yeah, no, we're good.

3749
02:25:51,549 --> 02:25:52,590
We got to run.

3750
02:25:52,590 --> 02:25:53,549
Yeah, we actually do have to go.

3751
02:25:54,350 --> 02:25:55,309
All right, to the marker or?

3752
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:59,739
To UV light or any kind of light.

3753
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:01,739
Can't be out at night.

3754
02:26:01,739 --> 02:26:02,299
It's dangerous.

3755
02:26:02,299 --> 02:26:03,659
We're far away from that marker.

3756
02:26:04,379 --> 02:26:06,079
Oh my fuck.

3757
02:26:06,079 --> 02:26:06,879
This giant.

3758
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:08,719
Is there fast travel?

3759
02:26:08,719 --> 02:26:09,280
I think there is.

3760
02:26:10,239 --> 02:26:12,319
Uh oh.

3761
02:26:12,860 --> 02:26:13,819
We got squelchers.

3762
02:26:18,579 --> 02:26:19,299
Make a new meme.

3763
02:26:19,860 --> 02:26:25,069
Oh shit, the chase started.

3764
02:26:27,170 --> 02:26:28,129
We started the chase.

3765
02:26:29,739 --> 02:26:31,180
Oh shit, the chase started.

3766
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:34,139
I want to see if you have what it takes to beat me.

3767
02:26:35,180 --> 02:26:35,899
Top text.

3768
02:26:35,899 --> 02:26:36,700
The chase started.

3769
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:37,420
Bottom text.

3770
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:39,280
Oh no.

3771
02:26:40,219 --> 02:26:42,379
I'm going to offer you $50,000.

3772
02:26:42,379 --> 02:26:44,620
It says you can't beat me in trivia.

3773
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:48,180
Trade request.

3774
02:26:48,180 --> 02:26:49,860
All right, Beastie, here we go.

3775
02:26:53,489 --> 02:27:01,489
You following me, powder?

3776
02:27:03,139 --> 02:27:03,639
Yeah.

3777
02:27:09,510 --> 02:27:11,010
Oh, you're going.

3778
02:27:11,010 --> 02:27:12,370
She's such a misfit.

3779
02:27:12,930 --> 02:27:14,209
Always ready to fight.

3780
02:27:14,209 --> 02:27:15,969
She's got a super beam.

3781
02:27:15,969 --> 02:27:17,889
And she's raising high.

3782
02:27:17,889 --> 02:27:19,409
If you believe you're strong.

3783
02:27:20,209 --> 02:27:23,700
So you know the whole song?

3784
02:27:23,700 --> 02:27:24,659
I don't know.

3785
02:27:24,659 --> 02:27:25,940
I heard like a minute of it.

3786
02:27:26,739 --> 02:27:27,239
Okay.

3787
02:27:30,129 --> 02:27:34,129
Okay, can we like not sleep or like pass time or?

3788
02:27:34,770 --> 02:27:36,049
We haven't really figured that out yet.

3789
02:27:36,049 --> 02:27:36,690
There's a couch.

3790
02:27:36,690 --> 02:27:38,450
You want to like chill on the couch?

3791
02:27:42,639 --> 02:27:43,520
I'm laughing.

3792
02:27:44,399 --> 02:27:44,639
Okay.

3793
02:27:44,639 --> 02:27:45,360
Yeah, we need to sleep.

3794
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:51,780
Why?

3795
02:27:56,149 --> 02:28:00,870
I can't believe you did not react to me doing the the Vi theme song.

3796
02:28:00,870 --> 02:28:02,469
Did you just pretend I wasn't doing that?

3797
02:28:03,270 --> 02:28:04,629
Are those actually the words?

3798
02:28:04,629 --> 02:28:05,030
Kind of.

3799
02:28:05,590 --> 02:28:06,469
I don't know.

3800
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:08,709
All I know is oh the misery.

3801
02:28:10,709 --> 02:28:11,430
Watch yourself.

3802
02:28:12,309 --> 02:28:13,829
No, you don't know.

3803
02:28:13,829 --> 02:28:14,629
Wow.

3804
02:28:14,629 --> 02:28:15,190
Fake fan.

3805
02:28:16,899 --> 02:28:17,860
I'm not a fan.

3806
02:28:18,819 --> 02:28:20,899
So we don't actually sleep here?

3807
02:28:22,399 --> 02:28:23,040
Yeah, either.

3808
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:29,520
I feel like there must be a button to like pass the time.

3809
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:31,200
I thought that would be right here.

3810
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:34,020
Can you not do that on multiplayer?

3811
02:28:36,719 --> 02:28:37,200
I don't know.

3812
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:39,670
Here.

3813
02:28:39,670 --> 02:28:42,069
We're going to survive the night and get the EXP bonus.

3814
02:28:42,069 --> 02:28:42,549
How about that?

3815
02:28:43,110 --> 02:28:43,590
I guess.

3816
02:28:44,149 --> 02:28:45,590
What's our current objective?

3817
02:28:45,590 --> 02:28:47,909
Oh, you can't sleep in all the safe houses.

3818
02:28:47,909 --> 02:28:48,469
Only some.

3819
02:28:48,469 --> 02:28:49,909
Report to Eeyore.

3820
02:28:49,909 --> 02:28:51,430
Let's go in this direction.

3821
02:28:58,840 --> 02:28:59,479
Oh, the church.

3822
02:28:59,479 --> 02:29:00,680
Well, church like right here, right?

3823
02:29:03,239 --> 02:29:04,440
Like Sunday mass, right?

3824
02:29:07,239 --> 02:29:09,079
Oh, this is a point of interest.

3825
02:29:09,079 --> 02:29:13,110
Yeah, push out that.

3826
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:27,520
And now we can sleep here.

3827
02:29:28,079 --> 02:29:29,040
This is not.

3828
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:30,319
No, we're going to the other area.

3829
02:29:31,780 --> 02:29:32,899
I don't want to sleep ever.

3830
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:34,020
Okay.

3831
02:29:34,020 --> 02:29:40,760
This is this is why the forces of evil fear the Nephilim because they never rest.

3832
02:29:45,569 --> 02:29:47,090
What's your favorite Lord of the Rings movie?

3833
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:53,799
Um, isn't there just one?

3834
02:29:55,809 --> 02:29:57,489
Just one of the Lord of the Rings movie?

3835
02:29:58,209 --> 02:29:59,170
Yeah, Lord of the Ring.

3836
02:30:04,600 --> 02:30:07,299
Mine's um, mine's return to the king.

3837
02:30:07,860 --> 02:30:11,360
I like the part that Peter that Peter Jackson wanted to remove.

3838
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:12,559
Was my favorite part of the whole movie.

3839
02:30:12,559 --> 02:30:15,840
And it's the one that he said is his least favorite thing he's ever done in cinema.

3840
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:16,479
That's my favorite.

3841
02:30:16,479 --> 02:30:19,600
I don't which scene I don't know too much about Lord of the Rings.

3842
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:22,399
Honestly, the ghost people, the ghost ship people.

3843
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:27,399
I don't remember a ghost ship.

3844
02:30:29,059 --> 02:30:30,819
Well, let me see if I can jog your memory.

3845
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:32,500
What say you?

3846
02:30:33,059 --> 02:30:35,959
What say you the help?

3847
02:30:37,719 --> 02:30:43,750
No, it was a ghost ship.

3848
02:30:43,750 --> 02:30:51,159
Yeah, this is like a SpongeBob reference.

3849
02:30:51,959 --> 02:30:56,360
No, there was a bunch of scenes where they were ghosts in like this tomb.

3850
02:30:57,079 --> 02:31:04,440
And they had to go to the tomb and get the uh, the the legions of the ghost people.

3851
02:31:05,239 --> 02:31:07,379
Pirates of the Caribbean.

3852
02:31:07,379 --> 02:31:10,579
No, and the guy walks over and he's like, oh, you best not believe it in ghost stories.

3853
02:31:10,579 --> 02:31:13,479
Because you're in one.

3854
02:31:13,479 --> 02:31:16,280
And then they help them at that battle with the elephants and stuff.

3855
02:31:21,010 --> 02:31:22,370
Death will be repaid.

3856
02:31:22,930 --> 02:31:25,569
You don't this happened in that movie, right?

3857
02:31:26,129 --> 02:31:28,709
Thanks, but uh, sorry.

3858
02:31:28,709 --> 02:31:38,239
Uh, it was the Gondor, the ghost of Gondor.

3859
02:31:38,239 --> 02:31:40,790
Yeah, and they came in on a ship.

3860
02:31:41,430 --> 02:31:44,440
They were in the movie for like 35 seconds.

3861
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:47,250
Now, I said she needs lavender for her.

3862
02:31:47,250 --> 02:31:48,450
I believe you.

3863
02:31:48,450 --> 02:31:49,569
Now, that makes more sense.

3864
02:31:50,209 --> 02:31:53,079
Metal scraps.

3865
02:31:53,079 --> 02:31:55,799
Nairo wants them Lord of the gaslighting.

3866
02:31:55,799 --> 02:31:59,399
Nobody even said that chase making perfume out of metal.

3867
02:31:59,399 --> 02:32:00,280
Sounds absurd.

3868
02:32:01,959 --> 02:32:04,360
I mean, I'm just trying to do quests and objectives here.

3869
02:32:05,479 --> 02:32:06,200
Oh, no, I'm dead.

3870
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:09,059
Ow, my leg.

3871
02:32:09,620 --> 02:32:12,739
Hold on.

3872
02:32:12,739 --> 02:32:13,540
I'm going to do some.

3873
02:32:13,540 --> 02:32:14,659
I've got to do some crafting.

3874
02:32:15,299 --> 02:32:18,440
You good?

3875
02:32:19,159 --> 02:32:25,239
I feel like if you own old Aragorn a debt.

3876
02:32:25,239 --> 02:32:31,620
Yeah, and Peter Jackson said that was the worst thing he's ever done.

3877
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:37,030
He's like, he's like, I wish I fucking deleted that from the whole fucking movie.

3878
02:32:37,670 --> 02:32:38,559
And I was like, what?

3879
02:32:38,559 --> 02:32:39,360
I like that scene.

3880
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:44,440
Did you like it or did you like think it was funny?

3881
02:32:45,079 --> 02:32:46,200
No, I actually liked it.

3882
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:48,520
I've I need a new topic.

3883
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:49,959
I don't know what's going on right now.

3884
02:32:49,959 --> 02:32:50,840
I don't know what's real.

3885
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:51,879
I don't know what's not real.

3886
02:32:58,629 --> 02:33:01,190
I owed Aragorn community subs.

3887
02:33:03,430 --> 02:33:06,680
I don't know why that's so funny to me.

3888
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:14,559
Did you guys both take a tab of acid before playing this?

3889
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:19,200
No, it's been a while since stir and I have like just played a game.

3890
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:21,760
What we can't like we can't relax and have a good time.

3891
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:23,120
Talk about microwaving stuff.

3892
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:25,670
Can't talk about magnets.

3893
02:33:26,389 --> 02:33:29,590
I'm not all caught up on the microwaving and the other stuff.

3894
02:33:29,590 --> 02:33:30,469
Like this is new to me.

3895
02:33:30,469 --> 02:33:34,309
You guys probably hear it every single day, but I didn't I didn't know the microwave lore.

3896
02:33:38,739 --> 02:33:43,540
Oh, we were helping the guy from here doing a quest or something.

3897
02:33:43,540 --> 02:33:45,459
And now we're reporting back.

3898
02:33:45,459 --> 02:33:47,219
So we're completing the quest.

3899
02:33:47,219 --> 02:33:48,819
Whatever it was that we did for him.

3900
02:33:49,540 --> 02:33:51,989
I was to look for Eeyore.

3901
02:33:52,709 --> 02:33:54,069
We're just inside, right?

3902
02:33:54,069 --> 02:33:54,870
We're just inside.

3903
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:05,879
Okay, I need all the characters.

3904
02:34:05,879 --> 02:34:06,760
I need all the players here.

3905
02:34:09,250 --> 02:34:10,360
Excuse me.

3906
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:14,469
I'm here.

3907
02:34:20,549 --> 02:34:23,750
So you're comfortable microwaving popcorn even though it kind of scares you?

3908
02:34:25,809 --> 02:34:27,729
Like you'll eat you'll eat the popcorn.

3909
02:34:28,370 --> 02:34:30,049
I'm not afraid of microwaves.

3910
02:34:30,049 --> 02:34:31,329
They just are a little odd.

3911
02:34:32,690 --> 02:34:36,389
So wouldn't you just rather pop your popcorn on like the stovetop?

3912
02:34:36,389 --> 02:34:37,190
It actually is.

3913
02:34:37,190 --> 02:34:38,309
It actually is kind of better that way.

3914
02:34:38,309 --> 02:34:43,520
Anyways, I hear that get a nice little crisp to it.

3915
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:48,079
But you do the thing that everybody accidentally does and you put way too much kernels in.

3916
02:34:48,959 --> 02:34:50,319
You think you're going to have.

3917
02:34:50,319 --> 02:34:51,280
Oh, no, that's not enough.

3918
02:34:52,229 --> 02:34:53,430
Let me just tell you right now.

3919
02:34:53,430 --> 02:34:56,950
It's enough at first scoop is enough worried about me.

3920
02:34:57,590 --> 02:35:01,670
Honestly, you're kind of making me want to pop some popcorn outside.

3921
02:35:01,670 --> 02:35:02,549
Yeah, no, you should.

3922
02:35:03,430 --> 02:35:05,110
But like I don't have a microwave.

3923
02:35:05,110 --> 02:35:06,709
So, you know, old fashioned.

3924
02:35:06,709 --> 02:35:08,549
I won't have to like worry about the radiation.

3925
02:35:09,430 --> 02:35:10,549
I love popcorn on the stove.

3926
02:35:10,549 --> 02:35:11,270
It's awesome.

3927
02:35:11,270 --> 02:35:13,510
But you end up doing way too much and then just gets everywhere.

3928
02:35:14,149 --> 02:35:15,750
We got to talk to Khan.

3929
02:35:15,750 --> 02:35:17,909
I just saw a ladder and I was like, I'm going to climb that.

3930
02:35:17,909 --> 02:35:27,540
You know what else is really good?

3931
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:29,379
Can you come over here?

3932
02:35:29,379 --> 02:35:30,739
I'm trying to get down.

3933
02:35:30,739 --> 02:35:32,260
I didn't think he was looking at me.

3934
02:35:33,270 --> 02:35:34,629
It wants me to find Lucas's.

3935
02:35:35,590 --> 02:35:37,030
Only then will he help me get to the center.

3936
02:35:37,030 --> 02:35:38,549
Have you ever toasted your own sunflower seeds?

3937
02:35:38,549 --> 02:35:41,110
Dirty work only to know head.

3938
02:35:41,110 --> 02:35:44,260
So you buy just raw sunflower seeds.

3939
02:35:45,860 --> 02:35:48,690
Taking out of the shell and you just put it.

3940
02:35:48,690 --> 02:35:50,690
You got to take them all out of the shell yourself.

3941
02:35:50,690 --> 02:35:51,090
No, no, no.

3942
02:35:51,090 --> 02:35:52,450
Just buy the ones that are out of the shell.

3943
02:35:52,450 --> 02:35:53,969
They sell raw, untoasted.

3944
02:35:53,969 --> 02:35:54,770
You can do it yourself.

3945
02:35:54,770 --> 02:35:55,329
OK.

3946
02:35:55,329 --> 02:35:55,649
Yeah.

3947
02:35:55,649 --> 02:35:55,969
OK.

3948
02:35:55,969 --> 02:35:57,250
I'm like a king.

3949
02:35:57,250 --> 02:36:00,370
I don't have time for that, but you can control the amount of salt

3950
02:36:00,370 --> 02:36:02,850
you put on and any other little things you want to add to it, too.

3951
02:36:02,850 --> 02:36:04,690
I don't really add a lot of things.

3952
02:36:04,690 --> 02:36:07,569
You know, I'm kind of like kind of basic.

3953
02:36:08,209 --> 02:36:09,649
I'll just put a little salt on it.

3954
02:36:09,649 --> 02:36:09,969
It's good.

3955
02:36:09,969 --> 02:36:10,690
It's really easy, too.

3956
02:36:11,250 --> 02:36:11,489
Why?

3957
02:36:12,290 --> 02:36:14,610
I don't know, because it's fun to do the new things.

3958
02:36:14,610 --> 02:36:16,530
It's fun to, like, experience our world.

3959
02:36:16,530 --> 02:36:16,690
Why?

3960
02:36:16,690 --> 02:36:17,329
What do you mean, why?

3961
02:36:17,889 --> 02:36:19,090
I mean, why put salt on it?

3962
02:36:19,090 --> 02:36:19,969
Why not just toast it?

3963
02:36:19,969 --> 02:36:20,530
Oh, OK.

3964
02:36:20,530 --> 02:36:25,280
Just you could.

3965
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:27,920
But the flavor wouldn't be kind of we're going this way.

3966
02:36:28,479 --> 02:36:29,440
It'd be a little dull.

3967
02:36:34,639 --> 02:36:36,479
Stir know that you grew sunflowers.

3968
02:36:36,479 --> 02:36:36,959
I think so.

3969
02:36:36,959 --> 02:36:37,360
Is it?

3970
02:36:37,360 --> 02:36:38,559
Do you hear about the sunflower?

3971
02:36:38,559 --> 02:36:38,959
I know.

3972
02:36:40,450 --> 02:36:41,409
Why would you know about that?

3973
02:36:41,409 --> 02:36:42,450
Actually, now that I think about it.

3974
02:36:43,670 --> 02:36:45,350
That's very weird.

3975
02:36:45,350 --> 02:36:46,950
It was like 10 feet tall.

3976
02:36:46,950 --> 02:36:47,350
It's huge.

3977
02:36:48,959 --> 02:36:54,049
Oh, and then you toast at your own sunflowers.

3978
02:36:54,049 --> 02:36:55,729
I gather from this tale.

3979
02:36:57,059 --> 02:36:57,860
No, you didn't.

3980
02:36:57,860 --> 02:36:58,180
I didn't.

3981
02:36:59,139 --> 02:37:00,340
I just grew some flowers.

3982
02:37:01,219 --> 02:37:04,180
Me and my girlfriend, we put them into a container

3983
02:37:05,479 --> 02:37:06,440
and we're going to plant.

3984
02:37:06,440 --> 02:37:10,120
We're going to pick out, like, the ones we're going to plant them again next season.

3985
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:11,000
Why did I say it like that?

3986
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:12,040
Like, season?

3987
02:37:12,040 --> 02:37:13,590
I don't know.

3988
02:37:15,729 --> 02:37:17,860
Wait, so OK.

3989
02:37:19,250 --> 02:37:19,969
We're not going to eat them.

3990
02:37:19,969 --> 02:37:20,690
We're going to replant them.

3991
02:37:21,250 --> 02:37:24,680
Because here's the thing about growing plants.

3992
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:25,479
If you don't know, stir.

3993
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:26,840
I don't.

3994
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:29,159
If you want to grow, let's say, sunflowers,

3995
02:37:29,159 --> 02:37:32,040
you don't just plant one sunflower in the ground and go, OK.

3996
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:34,520
Because it might not actually grow.

3997
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:35,959
You don't plant one.

3998
02:37:35,959 --> 02:37:36,280
OK.

3999
02:37:36,280 --> 02:37:36,920
I didn't know that.

4000
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:39,159
I thought you just did one sunflower.

4001
02:37:40,040 --> 02:37:41,719
Well, but then you were like, good.

4002
02:37:41,719 --> 02:37:43,559
And then like a whole field of them would grow.

4003
02:37:44,360 --> 02:37:44,920
No.

4004
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:48,760
My point is if you want, let's say you want like two or three sunflowers in the same area.

4005
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:52,680
You have to plant like 15 in that kind of small zone.

4006
02:37:52,680 --> 02:37:54,600
And then you have to get rid of the stragglers.

4007
02:37:54,600 --> 02:37:55,319
It's called thinning.

4008
02:37:55,959 --> 02:37:56,840
It's actually really sad.

4009
02:37:57,969 --> 02:37:59,649
Some of them are just not strong enough.

4010
02:37:59,649 --> 02:38:03,090
That is sad.

4011
02:38:03,090 --> 02:38:03,409
It is.

4012
02:38:03,409 --> 02:38:04,450
No, it is sad.

4013
02:38:04,450 --> 02:38:10,629
Well, what if you take the stragglers and you move them somewhere else?

4014
02:38:10,629 --> 02:38:11,110
Yeah, you could.

4015
02:38:11,110 --> 02:38:11,989
They get their own space.

4016
02:38:11,989 --> 02:38:12,309
You could.

4017
02:38:12,309 --> 02:38:13,430
But they might not go.

4018
02:38:13,430 --> 02:38:14,229
They might not keep going.

4019
02:38:16,639 --> 02:38:18,079
This is a really weird first date.

4020
02:38:20,079 --> 02:38:21,520
So it's in these microwaves.

4021
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:22,239
Let me tell you something.

4022
02:38:22,879 --> 02:38:24,930
You can put a magnet on your head.

4023
02:38:24,930 --> 02:38:29,170
Why did you sit on your cellular device?

4024
02:38:29,170 --> 02:38:32,690
It's called you have to thin out your sunflower seeds and it's sad.

4025
02:38:32,690 --> 02:38:34,770
I can't plant them all on you.

4026
02:38:38,520 --> 02:38:40,040
This guy has so much to say.

4027
02:38:41,159 --> 02:38:42,069
Go that way.

4028
02:38:42,069 --> 02:38:42,389
Okay.

4029
02:38:42,389 --> 02:38:43,590
You'll see a giant man.

4030
02:38:43,590 --> 02:38:43,829
Okay.

4031
02:38:46,049 --> 02:38:47,969
Yeah, we actually gave some as gifts.

4032
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:53,600
Okay.

4033
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:53,760
Yeah.

4034
02:38:53,760 --> 02:38:55,680
Let me mail you a sunflower.

4035
02:38:55,680 --> 02:38:56,879
That would be pretty cool.

4036
02:38:57,520 --> 02:38:58,159
It wouldn't make it.

4037
02:38:58,879 --> 02:38:59,760
Why wouldn't it make it?

4038
02:39:02,389 --> 02:39:02,870
Oh, shit.

4039
02:39:03,829 --> 02:39:07,760
You should email him a sunflower.

4040
02:39:08,399 --> 02:39:10,100
Like I didn't I didn't hear the story.

4041
02:39:10,100 --> 02:39:11,059
I didn't see a picture.

4042
02:39:16,799 --> 02:39:18,959
Your off stream life is a mystery to me.

4043
02:39:18,959 --> 02:39:23,840
Like I'm curious what you do as hobbies because you show up hobbies.

4044
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:26,559
Yesterday you made you show up like for a new year stream

4045
02:39:26,559 --> 02:39:28,000
and then you're gone till next New Year's.

4046
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,440
It's like, what are you doing in the meanwhile?

4047
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:32,479
Looking for a job.

4048
02:39:32,479 --> 02:39:32,879
I don't know.

4049
02:39:32,879 --> 02:39:34,239
I just like live my life, man.

4050
02:39:34,239 --> 02:39:35,360
Trust you.

4051
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:36,639
It's grown some.

4052
02:39:36,639 --> 02:39:38,319
I mean, I didn't know about the grown sunflowers.

4053
02:39:38,319 --> 02:39:39,040
That's the thing.

4054
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:40,399
Yeah, I'm kind of into plants.

4055
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:42,239
Sad update.

4056
02:39:42,239 --> 02:39:43,120
Really sad update.

4057
02:39:44,239 --> 02:39:47,920
I had a money tree and it wasn't doing well.

4058
02:39:48,819 --> 02:39:50,100
I tried to replant it.

4059
02:39:50,100 --> 02:39:53,700
I tried to help it give it some space and it didn't make it.

4060
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:54,659
That was actually really sad.

4061
02:39:55,459 --> 02:40:07,799
The money tree is a perfect place for shade or.

4062
02:40:10,629 --> 02:40:15,559
I was looking for some support is what I was looking for.

4063
02:40:16,360 --> 02:40:18,600
Well, I'll support you when I know what it is.

4064
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:18,920
All right.

4065
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:22,200
So we got get some work at the czar and earn Sophie's trust.

4066
02:40:22,200 --> 02:40:25,540
OK, it's a tree.

4067
02:40:26,979 --> 02:40:28,180
You can get they come in different sizes.

4068
02:40:42,229 --> 02:40:47,639
OK, I can upgrade your blueprint if you bring me.

4069
02:40:50,600 --> 02:40:52,360
13 infected trophies.

4070
02:40:52,360 --> 02:40:53,399
Why is he posing?

4071
02:41:00,469 --> 02:41:02,069
I said fuck you up like.

4072
02:41:02,069 --> 02:41:05,270
Yeah, I like all the parts of this game that aren't like talking to people.

4073
02:41:05,989 --> 02:41:07,989
Well, I mean, you have to sell items and stuff.

4074
02:41:08,790 --> 02:41:11,270
Yeah, but like all the crap, I just like running around the city

4075
02:41:11,270 --> 02:41:15,110
and they're being, you know, zombies and, you know, you looting, you know.

4076
02:41:15,110 --> 02:41:16,469
This is so much more damage than what I have.

4077
02:41:17,719 --> 02:41:18,440
Twenty five.

4078
02:41:24,899 --> 02:41:35,479
I don't I don't get some work at the bizarre from who got a lot of good weapons now.

4079
02:41:36,600 --> 02:41:38,760
Oh, do I have your permission?

4080
02:41:40,239 --> 02:41:40,879
Mission for what?

4081
02:41:47,110 --> 02:41:47,829
Quest giver.

4082
02:41:47,829 --> 02:41:53,920
OK, I'm Damian.

4083
02:42:02,659 --> 02:42:05,780
Hey, hey, streamer, maybe you'd like to everything else more

4084
02:42:05,780 --> 02:42:07,139
if you'd actually talk to anyone.

4085
02:42:07,780 --> 02:42:11,270
I mean, people have people have a point, right?

4086
02:42:11,270 --> 02:42:14,629
Like we're not immersing ourselves in the story.

4087
02:42:14,629 --> 02:42:19,590
We're literally going as fast as we can to go swing chivalry weapons at people.

4088
02:42:19,590 --> 02:42:22,790
I'm immersed in the parts that I want to be immersed in,

4089
02:42:22,790 --> 02:42:25,670
which is like hanging out with an identical clone of myself

4090
02:42:25,670 --> 02:42:28,629
and just like having a good time jumping around rafters

4091
02:42:28,629 --> 02:42:31,350
and jumping off buildings and doing monkey swings.

4092
02:42:31,350 --> 02:42:35,780
I don't think we got we didn't get a mission from that person.

4093
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:37,860
OK, yeah, we have to go talk to someone else now.

4094
02:42:45,319 --> 02:42:45,879
All players.

4095
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:50,500
And see, then this guy's like, oh, give you a job.

4096
02:42:50,500 --> 02:42:51,139
You want a job.

4097
02:42:52,819 --> 02:42:53,780
I think you got to play cards.

4098
02:42:54,819 --> 02:42:55,620
A job.

4099
02:42:55,620 --> 02:42:56,739
Oh, you want a job.

4100
02:42:56,819 --> 02:42:57,780
I got to work.

4101
02:42:57,780 --> 02:42:59,459
It's like, how did the conversation take that long?

4102
02:42:59,459 --> 02:43:02,260
That's why I'm a secretary and wedding ring on the wrong finger.

4103
02:43:02,260 --> 02:43:02,659
Come on.

4104
02:43:02,659 --> 02:43:03,860
Don't fuck with me.

4105
02:43:03,860 --> 02:43:04,579
I'm serious.

4106
02:43:04,579 --> 02:43:06,420
Well, then it's not a wedding here.

4107
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:08,180
Like you own the place sticks.

4108
02:43:08,180 --> 02:43:09,700
Coconut sized balls.

4109
02:43:12,610 --> 02:43:15,700
OK, I might have a just a ring, dude.

4110
02:43:17,280 --> 02:43:18,879
Oh, minor thing.

4111
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:20,639
This is a ring.

4112
02:43:20,639 --> 02:43:22,079
But it's a ring.

4113
02:43:23,569 --> 02:43:26,260
Oh, why did I ask why?

4114
02:43:29,379 --> 02:43:30,899
OK, he gave us a small job.

4115
02:43:31,299 --> 02:43:32,260
I think we can handle it.

4116
02:43:32,260 --> 02:43:33,459
The balls in your court.

4117
02:43:33,459 --> 02:43:33,860
All right.

4118
02:43:33,860 --> 02:43:35,860
Track track that.

4119
02:43:36,500 --> 02:43:38,020
Now we're going to earn their trust.

4120
02:43:38,020 --> 02:43:40,500
I mean, once we have their trust, we're going to split their throats.

4121
02:43:40,500 --> 02:43:51,219
I think we are the family in infantry.

4122
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:53,319
Oh, my God, man.

4123
02:43:53,879 --> 02:43:54,920
Not coming up.

4124
02:43:54,920 --> 02:43:55,559
You have six.

4125
02:43:56,739 --> 02:43:57,219
Yeah, it is.

4126
02:43:59,719 --> 02:44:02,680
I want to beg you to play that and then like play for like a day

4127
02:44:02,680 --> 02:44:03,639
and then never talk to you again.

4128
02:44:05,319 --> 02:44:06,600
Like I said, you would.

4129
02:44:06,600 --> 02:44:07,100
Yep.

4130
02:44:07,979 --> 02:44:09,190
I was like, oh, yeah, real fun.

4131
02:44:09,190 --> 02:44:10,469
We'll play again sometime.

4132
02:44:10,469 --> 02:44:12,870
And then like, I think three years went by.

4133
02:44:16,059 --> 02:44:17,579
Oh, I'm sorry.

4134
02:44:17,579 --> 02:44:18,860
I never apologize for that.

4135
02:44:20,620 --> 02:44:21,260
These bad guys.

4136
02:44:23,370 --> 02:44:33,899
Yeah, I'm not going to take the first swing because it's that's even.

4137
02:44:33,899 --> 02:44:34,299
I'm not.

4138
02:44:34,299 --> 02:44:35,260
It's not funny.

4139
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:35,819
Like what do you think?

4140
02:44:35,819 --> 02:44:38,219
It's funny to just hit people and be mean all the time.

4141
02:44:41,829 --> 02:44:43,270
We got to find this building over here.

4142
02:44:48,069 --> 02:44:48,389
Oh, yeah.

4143
02:44:48,389 --> 02:44:49,829
But we're playing EDF six, right?

4144
02:44:51,239 --> 02:44:51,639
Maybe.

4145
02:44:51,639 --> 02:44:52,360
I don't know.

4146
02:44:52,360 --> 02:44:52,920
It depends.

4147
02:44:52,920 --> 02:44:53,559
It's going to be good.

4148
02:44:58,360 --> 02:44:59,479
Why wouldn't it be good?

4149
02:44:59,479 --> 02:45:00,360
I don't know.

4150
02:45:00,360 --> 02:45:03,370
Those games are so much fun, though.

4151
02:45:04,090 --> 02:45:06,149
Yeah.

4152
02:45:06,149 --> 02:45:06,950
So why do you doubt?

4153
02:45:08,860 --> 02:45:11,260
I mean, they take a long time to play, though.

4154
02:45:11,899 --> 02:45:15,780
If you're going to play EDF, it's not just like, yeah, you know, I'll play EDF for an hour.

4155
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:16,180
You have to play.

4156
02:45:16,180 --> 02:45:18,420
You have to commit like 100 hours to EDF for it to be fun.

4157
02:45:19,379 --> 02:45:21,049
Or at least like 30.

4158
02:45:28,940 --> 02:45:30,459
Hubert, you here?

4159
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:32,219
Dodger sent me.

4160
02:45:33,180 --> 02:45:34,139
Did he?

4161
02:45:34,139 --> 02:45:39,399
Are we going to find a way inside?

4162
02:45:40,120 --> 02:45:44,170
It's so pretty.

4163
02:45:44,170 --> 02:45:44,649
It really is.

4164
02:45:48,760 --> 02:45:49,260
Window.

4165
02:45:54,469 --> 02:45:54,709
I don't know.

4166
02:45:54,709 --> 02:45:56,309
I'm not sure where you're going, but I'm going to follow you.

4167
02:45:58,309 --> 02:45:59,750
I mean, I see a door over there.

4168
02:45:59,750 --> 02:46:01,190
I thought there might be a window somewhere.

4169
02:46:01,190 --> 02:46:02,069
We're trying to get in here.

4170
02:46:02,069 --> 02:46:03,030
Oh, there's a window right here.

4171
02:46:05,799 --> 02:46:06,600
There's heads.

4172
02:46:06,600 --> 02:46:07,159
Heads, bro.

4173
02:46:07,159 --> 02:46:08,280
I need your help, bro.

4174
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:08,920
Thanks for the subs.

4175
02:46:09,479 --> 02:46:12,680
I'm trying to get off.

4176
02:46:13,319 --> 02:46:14,010
Watch out.

4177
02:46:14,010 --> 02:46:14,329
Watch out.

4178
02:46:14,329 --> 02:46:14,649
Watch out.

4179
02:46:14,649 --> 02:46:15,049
Watch out.

4180
02:46:17,290 --> 02:46:18,489
Came with a weapon this time.

4181
02:46:29,379 --> 02:46:32,659
Oh, there's tracks.

4182
02:46:33,459 --> 02:46:38,180
Yeah, because we're trying to figure out where the guy went.

4183
02:46:38,180 --> 02:46:39,059
Oh, cool.

4184
02:46:39,139 --> 02:46:43,540
In his place, his place appears to be infested, you know, from context clues.

4185
02:46:45,620 --> 02:46:46,739
But I'm just kind of looting.

4186
02:46:47,750 --> 02:46:48,389
Kind of what you do.

4187
02:46:49,340 --> 02:46:50,940
Yeah, I'm just opening up these boxes.

4188
02:46:52,600 --> 02:46:54,520
We're going to have to make it into the final circle soon, though.

4189
02:46:59,190 --> 02:47:00,629
Yeah, I see there's footprints.

4190
02:47:00,629 --> 02:47:07,219
They go probably up.

4191
02:47:07,219 --> 02:47:09,659
No, I'm going to climb this footprint.

4192
02:47:10,299 --> 02:47:13,510
That looks like we're going to be going down.

4193
02:47:14,229 --> 02:47:19,819
Where do we go from here?

4194
02:47:23,959 --> 02:47:24,440
Woodrobe.

4195
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:28,739
Yeah, we've got to check and make sure there's not like another world in there.

4196
02:47:31,159 --> 02:47:32,200
Oh, we got a tunnel.

4197
02:47:34,329 --> 02:47:34,809
Perfect.

4198
02:47:35,770 --> 02:47:40,950
A secret gremlin tunnel where you like, you climb around in here for a little bit,

4199
02:47:40,950 --> 02:47:42,069
then you jump in the pool.

4200
02:47:42,069 --> 02:47:44,229
Yeah, you got to jump in the pool after.

4201
02:47:44,870 --> 02:47:59,959
It's Hector.

4202
02:47:59,959 --> 02:48:00,440
What are you doing?

4203
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:03,819
This is for Rage.

4204
02:48:03,819 --> 02:48:05,579
How did you find my secret entrance?

4205
02:48:06,139 --> 02:48:07,340
You call that a secret?

4206
02:48:08,219 --> 02:48:09,260
It was supposed to be.

4207
02:48:10,059 --> 02:48:11,020
You're out of luck, though.

4208
02:48:14,629 --> 02:48:15,510
He hurt his leg.

4209
02:48:15,510 --> 02:48:16,389
You're going to have to put him down.

4210
02:48:19,110 --> 02:48:20,309
I think one of us is going to have to carry him.

4211
02:48:25,770 --> 02:48:27,379
He won't give a shit.

4212
02:48:34,040 --> 02:48:34,920
There's a lot of choices.

4213
02:48:34,920 --> 02:48:35,399
Which one?

4214
02:48:37,590 --> 02:48:38,389
I'll be back soon.

4215
02:48:38,389 --> 02:48:39,909
It sounded like a conversation under.

4216
02:48:42,870 --> 02:48:43,510
It did, yeah.

4217
02:48:46,010 --> 02:48:49,450
I gather we have to go loot like he was sent to go do a thing,

4218
02:48:49,450 --> 02:48:52,489
but he hurt his leg and he's going to get put down like a horse and he can't do it.

4219
02:48:52,489 --> 02:48:54,090
So we have to go do it for him.

4220
02:48:54,090 --> 02:48:56,090
And then like he's going to get the credit.

4221
02:48:56,090 --> 02:48:59,270
We're not supposed to go this way.

4222
02:48:59,829 --> 02:49:00,790
Yeah, the other way.

4223
02:49:00,790 --> 02:49:01,750
You have a knack for that.

4224
02:49:02,309 --> 02:49:05,110
I just I see arrows that are on the ground and I look at them.

4225
02:49:05,829 --> 02:49:10,629
You're going to send that guy to the glue factory.

4226
02:49:14,940 --> 02:49:23,350
Now, how did I hear these guys?

4227
02:49:23,350 --> 02:49:24,149
I tripped me.

4228
02:49:25,850 --> 02:49:26,649
You want to listen to them?

4229
02:49:31,899 --> 02:49:32,540
The same guy.

4230
02:49:33,420 --> 02:49:34,459
I think there's there's talking.

4231
02:49:37,420 --> 02:49:39,819
Like, is it really normal for you?

4232
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:45,959
Are they going to notice him fall?

4233
02:49:45,959 --> 02:49:46,520
No, they're not.

4234
02:49:50,649 --> 02:49:52,569
I think I helped.

4235
02:49:53,610 --> 02:49:58,629
You fall in.

4236
02:49:58,709 --> 02:50:00,549
You're doing it.

4237
02:50:00,549 --> 02:50:08,870
Oh, OK, we got distracted.

4238
02:50:09,979 --> 02:50:12,139
You want to just like just get distracted.

4239
02:50:12,139 --> 02:50:14,540
You want to just like wander where we're doing quests.

4240
02:50:14,540 --> 02:50:15,819
I mean, we're already on this quest.

4241
02:50:15,819 --> 02:50:16,620
Let's just finish this one.

4242
02:50:17,340 --> 02:50:21,860
OK, I just want to, you know, go to some dangerous locales

4243
02:50:21,860 --> 02:50:25,780
and find some, you know, interesting go down in the metro.

4244
02:50:26,420 --> 02:50:27,940
Find out what's going on there.

4245
02:50:27,940 --> 02:50:29,059
What's with all these zombies?

4246
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:30,659
I don't know what is with it.

4247
02:50:30,659 --> 02:50:31,219
It's crazy.

4248
02:50:32,649 --> 02:50:34,090
Like no one's talking about this.

4249
02:50:36,659 --> 02:50:43,000
No one's even talking about this happening everywhere we go.

4250
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:46,280
It's like, oh, go over here and pick up my supplies like zombies.

4251
02:50:46,280 --> 02:50:47,159
No one's going to.

4252
02:50:47,159 --> 02:50:47,479
Wow.

4253
02:50:48,440 --> 02:50:49,000
See you later.

4254
02:50:50,120 --> 02:50:58,659
OK, 59 meters.

4255
02:51:06,520 --> 02:51:07,879
Inhibitor container detected.

4256
02:51:07,879 --> 02:51:10,629
Oh, inhibitor.

4257
02:51:11,350 --> 02:51:13,930
That's going to be in that zone.

4258
02:51:15,530 --> 02:51:19,450
Why isn't anyone talking about this with 200,000 tweets?

4259
02:51:19,450 --> 02:51:25,530
It's this is this is totally the mission from Dying Light one

4260
02:51:25,530 --> 02:51:27,690
where we go down there, open the garage door

4261
02:51:27,690 --> 02:51:29,530
and the big tyrant is going to show up.

4262
02:51:29,530 --> 02:51:30,250
Oh, it is.

4263
02:51:30,809 --> 02:51:31,290
You're right.

4264
02:51:37,209 --> 02:51:38,489
But they do it twice, though.

4265
02:51:39,819 --> 02:51:47,239
What they do is fucking guys will do anything.

4266
02:51:49,559 --> 02:51:50,440
Who made this game?

4267
02:51:53,209 --> 02:51:53,850
Who made this game?

4268
02:51:55,829 --> 02:52:00,549
I rent tech tech land.

4269
02:52:00,549 --> 02:52:00,790
Yeah.

4270
02:52:01,610 --> 02:52:02,729
What else is tech land made?

4271
02:52:04,870 --> 02:52:05,670
They made Dying Light.

4272
02:52:06,709 --> 02:52:07,829
Besides that, obviously.

4273
02:52:10,020 --> 02:52:11,059
I need you to help.

4274
02:52:11,860 --> 02:52:13,299
I did it.

4275
02:52:13,299 --> 02:52:16,979
No, I swear that was when I was them.

4276
02:52:21,850 --> 02:52:23,020
You guys need help.

4277
02:52:23,579 --> 02:52:24,379
We'll be fine.

4278
02:52:24,379 --> 02:52:25,260
Thanks.

4279
02:52:25,260 --> 02:52:25,819
What happened?

4280
02:52:26,549 --> 02:52:30,469
We heard a rumor about the pirate.

4281
02:52:30,469 --> 02:52:31,750
It's just two other players.

4282
02:52:34,309 --> 02:52:36,149
When we're like pretending not to be in the same game.

4283
02:52:38,579 --> 02:52:39,459
We're going down.

4284
02:52:47,059 --> 02:52:47,860
Trash doesn't hurt either.

4285
02:52:48,420 --> 02:52:53,319
You can go down, too.

4286
02:52:55,899 --> 02:52:57,180
Yeah, there's nothing here.

4287
02:52:57,180 --> 02:52:58,219
Looks like we're going down.

4288
02:52:59,500 --> 02:53:04,309
Elevator.

4289
02:53:04,309 --> 02:53:04,790
All right, cool.

4290
02:53:08,569 --> 02:53:09,690
We should turn off the generator.

4291
02:53:17,319 --> 02:53:18,040
Why did we do that?

4292
02:53:20,680 --> 02:53:21,959
That just gave us a problem.

4293
02:53:26,600 --> 02:53:27,399
Okay, you go first.

4294
02:53:27,399 --> 02:53:28,200
I got your back.

4295
02:53:28,200 --> 02:53:28,920
All right, I'm going first.

4296
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:33,079
Owler, straight ahead.

4297
02:53:42,569 --> 02:53:44,409
I could find the GRE container.

4298
02:53:50,040 --> 02:53:52,979
Easy, easy.

4299
02:53:52,979 --> 02:53:53,780
You're aggroing.

4300
02:53:54,420 --> 02:53:56,229
Am I?

4301
02:53:56,229 --> 02:53:57,030
You're aggroed him.

4302
02:53:58,600 --> 02:53:59,559
What are you talking about?

4303
02:53:59,559 --> 02:54:00,360
You're aggroed him.

4304
02:54:05,819 --> 02:54:07,899
You're doing fake E3 gamer trailer.

4305
02:54:07,899 --> 02:54:08,459
No, we're not.

4306
02:54:09,180 --> 02:54:09,659
Oh, my God.

4307
02:54:09,659 --> 02:54:10,379
I'm aggroing him.

4308
02:54:10,379 --> 02:54:10,940
I'm the tank.

4309
02:54:10,940 --> 02:54:11,739
You're aggroing.

4310
02:54:12,299 --> 02:54:13,260
You're aggroing.

4311
02:54:13,260 --> 02:54:13,979
Let's walk away.

4312
02:54:14,940 --> 02:54:16,379
Uh-oh, we're aggroing.

4313
02:54:16,379 --> 02:54:17,659
There's a dude right here.

4314
02:54:17,659 --> 02:54:18,299
You aggroed.

4315
02:54:20,059 --> 02:54:25,079
It's time to run.

4316
02:54:25,079 --> 02:54:25,959
The Zeds see us.

4317
02:54:26,840 --> 02:54:27,479
There's no time.

4318
02:54:28,200 --> 02:54:30,340
Why would you hit the howler?

4319
02:54:31,059 --> 02:54:32,540
So he doesn't howl.

4320
02:54:34,489 --> 02:54:35,370
Oh, shit.

4321
02:54:35,370 --> 02:54:40,809
Except we gotta go.

4322
02:54:40,809 --> 02:54:41,770
Watch out.

4323
02:54:41,770 --> 02:54:42,809
Horde's coming.

4324
02:54:42,809 --> 02:54:44,809
Oh, my fucking heart is beating so fast.

4325
02:54:45,530 --> 02:54:47,290
There's monsters and shit everywhere.

4326
02:54:47,290 --> 02:54:48,969
Player number two up the stairs.

4327
02:54:48,969 --> 02:54:49,530
Come on, hurry.

4328
02:54:49,530 --> 02:54:50,010
Go, go, go.

4329
02:54:50,010 --> 02:54:51,770
My fucking heart is racing, dude.

4330
02:54:51,770 --> 02:54:52,270
Jesus.

4331
02:54:53,530 --> 02:54:54,969
Let's clear this out real quick.

4332
02:54:54,969 --> 02:54:56,329
We need to save them.

4333
02:54:56,329 --> 02:54:56,969
I need to stop.

4334
02:54:56,969 --> 02:54:57,770
I have to stop for a second.

4335
02:54:58,729 --> 02:54:59,690
Fucking God.

4336
02:55:00,649 --> 02:55:01,290
It's intense.

4337
02:55:01,290 --> 02:55:02,729
Stop for one second, man.

4338
02:55:02,729 --> 02:55:03,370
You need a heal?

4339
02:55:04,090 --> 02:55:04,649
I got you.

4340
02:55:04,649 --> 02:55:05,530
Let's patch you back up.

4341
02:55:07,659 --> 02:55:08,139
Thanks, man.

4342
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:09,420
Jeez.

4343
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:11,350
That's my last one.

4344
02:55:11,350 --> 02:55:12,069
Oh, shit, man.

4345
02:55:12,069 --> 02:55:12,950
My light.

4346
02:55:12,950 --> 02:55:14,760
My light's flickering out.

4347
02:55:14,760 --> 02:55:15,079
What?

4348
02:55:15,879 --> 02:55:16,600
I can't see a thing.

4349
02:55:16,600 --> 02:55:17,399
Oh, man.

4350
02:55:18,040 --> 02:55:18,680
Oh, man.

4351
02:55:19,719 --> 02:55:20,760
Okay, guys.

4352
02:55:22,379 --> 02:55:23,819
I can't see either, man.

4353
02:55:23,819 --> 02:55:24,620
I can't see either.

4354
02:55:25,260 --> 02:55:26,520
It could be one anywhere.

4355
02:55:29,049 --> 02:55:29,530
I sneezed.

4356
02:55:29,530 --> 02:55:30,329
It turns it back on.

4357
02:55:32,969 --> 02:55:34,090
There's a volatile down here.

4358
02:55:34,090 --> 02:55:34,569
We're doomed.

4359
02:55:36,340 --> 02:55:37,299
Oh, what's all this goop?

4360
02:55:38,459 --> 02:55:38,860
Guy?

4361
02:55:38,860 --> 02:55:39,180
God.

4362
02:55:40,139 --> 02:55:40,540
Guy.

4363
02:55:40,540 --> 02:55:41,340
I think he's dead, man.

4364
02:55:41,340 --> 02:55:41,899
I think he's dead.

4365
02:55:41,899 --> 02:55:42,540
I think he's dead.

4366
02:55:43,340 --> 02:55:43,979
Yeah, he is now.

4367
02:55:44,700 --> 02:55:45,819
Yeah, I took the assassin perk.

4368
02:55:45,819 --> 02:55:46,379
Oh, my God.

4369
02:55:46,379 --> 02:55:47,340
Watch out.

4370
02:55:47,340 --> 02:55:48,219
Ow, my heart.

4371
02:55:48,219 --> 02:55:49,260
My fucking body hurts.

4372
02:55:49,260 --> 02:55:50,860
That was so fucked up.

4373
02:55:50,860 --> 02:55:52,219
He just touched you, grabbed you.

4374
02:55:53,020 --> 02:55:54,180
Kill him.

4375
02:55:54,180 --> 02:55:54,899
Kill him.

4376
02:55:54,899 --> 02:55:55,299
Kill him.

4377
02:55:56,899 --> 02:55:57,459
All right.

4378
02:55:57,459 --> 02:55:58,260
I don't know, dude.

4379
02:55:58,260 --> 02:55:58,579
I think...

4380
02:56:00,100 --> 02:56:01,780
Can we play Mario or something?

4381
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:02,659
You gonna be okay, man?

4382
02:56:03,989 --> 02:56:05,510
Can we play Mario Kart or something, dude?

4383
02:56:05,510 --> 02:56:06,709
I don't think I can do this.

4384
02:56:06,709 --> 02:56:08,860
This isn't a game.

4385
02:56:11,620 --> 02:56:12,260
I think he's gonna explode.

4386
02:56:12,260 --> 02:56:12,739
Don't hit those.

4387
02:56:12,739 --> 02:56:13,299
Don't hit those.

4388
02:56:19,239 --> 02:56:19,559
Sorry.

4389
02:56:19,559 --> 02:56:20,040
I'm sorry.

4390
02:56:21,239 --> 02:56:23,479
I was so confused because it was moving around

4391
02:56:23,479 --> 02:56:25,000
but not spraying on my screen.

4392
02:56:26,299 --> 02:56:28,139
It was just like doing a worm move.

4393
02:56:28,139 --> 02:56:28,620
Okay.

4394
02:56:28,620 --> 02:56:28,860
Okay.

4395
02:56:29,899 --> 02:56:31,100
Where's the GRE container?

4396
02:56:31,100 --> 02:56:31,420
It's all right.

4397
02:56:31,420 --> 02:56:32,540
We'll turn on the generator.

4398
02:56:32,540 --> 02:56:33,260
Get some light in here.

4399
02:56:38,969 --> 02:56:39,290
Nice.

4400
02:56:39,290 --> 02:56:40,889
Oh, cool.

4401
02:56:40,889 --> 02:56:42,920
There's his dead in there.

4402
02:56:43,559 --> 02:56:44,520
Oh, container.

4403
02:56:45,959 --> 02:56:46,680
This is the room we...

4404
02:56:47,399 --> 02:56:48,540
This is where we came from.

4405
02:56:48,540 --> 02:56:48,860
That's on the...

4406
02:56:49,420 --> 02:56:55,739
Watch out.

4407
02:56:55,739 --> 02:56:56,299
I'll get this loop.

4408
02:56:58,170 --> 02:56:58,969
Oh, shit.

4409
02:56:58,969 --> 02:56:59,450
Not again.

4410
02:56:59,450 --> 02:57:00,170
We're gonna have to run.

4411
02:57:01,610 --> 02:57:02,729
I don't want to do that again.

4412
02:57:03,290 --> 02:57:05,049
I don't want to do the acting routine again.

4413
02:57:05,690 --> 02:57:07,450
We need to find the container.

4414
02:57:07,450 --> 02:57:11,959
Which way are we going?

4415
02:57:11,959 --> 02:57:12,760
Are we going down this way?

4416
02:57:13,319 --> 02:57:14,440
I don't know.

4417
02:57:14,440 --> 02:57:15,319
We have to find one of those things.

4418
02:57:15,319 --> 02:57:15,719
Watch your back.

4419
02:57:18,520 --> 02:57:19,799
The indicator didn't beep yet.

4420
02:57:19,799 --> 02:57:21,719
I think this is the military storage area

4421
02:57:21,719 --> 02:57:22,600
Hubert told me about.

4422
02:57:22,600 --> 02:57:24,280
Yeah, it's down here in secret.

4423
02:57:24,280 --> 02:57:26,059
Okay.

4424
02:57:26,059 --> 02:57:26,540
I'm going.

4425
02:57:27,260 --> 02:57:29,690
I'm a runner.

4426
02:57:29,690 --> 02:57:33,459
Are you actually just running through this?

4427
02:57:33,459 --> 02:57:34,100
Yeah, I'm a runner.

4428
02:57:35,620 --> 02:57:36,579
Fucking idiot.

4429
02:57:39,780 --> 02:57:41,059
Call it next time then.

4430
02:57:41,059 --> 02:57:41,700
Call it now.

4431
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:42,819
I don't want to be fucking mad, dude.

4432
02:57:42,819 --> 02:57:44,180
But call it next time.

4433
02:57:44,180 --> 02:57:44,819
I called it.

4434
02:57:44,819 --> 02:57:45,540
I don't know where to go.

4435
02:57:46,260 --> 02:57:46,979
Dead end, bro.

4436
02:57:47,540 --> 02:57:53,770
Fucking dead end, bro.

4437
02:57:54,569 --> 02:57:55,129
Through here.

4438
02:57:55,129 --> 02:57:55,690
Through here.

4439
02:57:55,690 --> 02:57:57,209
Go through the fucking door.

4440
02:57:57,209 --> 02:57:58,329
God damn it, man.

4441
02:57:58,329 --> 02:57:58,889
This way.

4442
02:57:58,889 --> 02:57:59,370
Up here.

4443
02:57:59,370 --> 02:58:00,809
Not playing games with you again.

4444
02:58:00,809 --> 02:58:01,850
Oh, my...

4445
02:58:01,850 --> 02:58:05,690
This isn't funny, bro.

4446
02:58:08,200 --> 02:58:08,920
Help me.

4447
02:58:08,920 --> 02:58:09,399
Watch my back.

4448
02:58:09,399 --> 02:58:10,440
I'm turning on the lights.

4449
02:58:10,440 --> 02:58:10,940
Yeah.

4450
02:58:12,420 --> 02:58:14,260
Nah, I'm just not fucking gonna play a game with you anymore.

4451
02:58:18,920 --> 02:58:20,600
Go play fucking COD, you fucking idiot.

4452
02:58:23,370 --> 02:58:23,770
Oh, wait.

4453
02:58:23,770 --> 02:58:24,569
You're locked the guy.

4454
02:58:24,569 --> 02:58:25,450
I need you.

4455
02:58:25,450 --> 02:58:25,850
Hey.

4456
02:58:25,850 --> 02:58:26,170
Yep.

4457
02:58:26,170 --> 02:58:26,649
I'm on it.

4458
02:58:27,450 --> 02:58:28,229
Drops up.

4459
02:58:28,790 --> 02:58:39,500
I got it.

4460
02:58:39,500 --> 02:58:39,899
Stop.

4461
02:58:44,739 --> 02:58:45,459
Oh, coffee.

4462
02:58:46,600 --> 02:58:47,479
Oh, Cheetos.

4463
02:58:48,760 --> 02:58:49,479
Roaty vest.

4464
02:58:51,379 --> 02:58:52,420
Cheetos.

4465
02:58:52,420 --> 02:58:52,899
Chicken.

4466
02:58:54,020 --> 02:58:56,420
Yeah, how did they not put any of that back in this game?

4467
02:58:57,959 --> 02:58:59,479
We've been playing for like two hours.

4468
02:58:59,479 --> 02:59:01,479
I haven't seen one coffee, Cheetos, or chicken.

4469
02:59:02,040 --> 02:59:05,620
Because I don't think any of those items are actually in the game.

4470
02:59:07,450 --> 02:59:08,649
Coffee was.

4471
02:59:08,649 --> 02:59:09,610
Was it?

4472
02:59:09,610 --> 02:59:10,489
It was.

4473
02:59:10,569 --> 02:59:11,370
Yes.

4474
02:59:11,370 --> 02:59:13,639
Oh, we got a box.

4475
02:59:13,639 --> 02:59:15,959
But you're acting like they were Cheetos in the game?

4476
02:59:15,959 --> 02:59:17,079
There were no Cheetos.

4477
02:59:17,079 --> 02:59:18,680
There was no Cheetos, but there was coffee.

4478
02:59:18,680 --> 02:59:20,600
And we haven't seen coffee yet, and I'm upset.

4479
02:59:26,229 --> 02:59:28,790
You said we weren't going to do the bit unless you found it.

4480
02:59:30,180 --> 02:59:31,139
Well, we're not going to find it.

4481
02:59:32,360 --> 02:59:33,159
You're just giving up.

4482
02:59:37,979 --> 02:59:38,620
No.

4483
02:59:38,620 --> 02:59:39,420
I thought that was coffee.

4484
02:59:39,420 --> 02:59:40,459
It looks like extra gold.

4485
02:59:40,459 --> 02:59:44,709
A bottle of risen glory cognac and some cigars.

4486
02:59:44,709 --> 02:59:45,909
Cubans, the box says.

4487
02:59:45,909 --> 02:59:46,790
Some cigars?

4488
02:59:46,790 --> 02:59:47,909
Yeah, some cigars.

4489
02:59:48,950 --> 02:59:52,459
Well, we have all this stuff here.

4490
02:59:52,459 --> 02:59:52,700
OK.

4491
02:59:53,899 --> 02:59:54,139
Yeah.

4492
02:59:54,139 --> 02:59:55,100
Do you have a heal, bro?

4493
02:59:55,659 --> 02:59:56,889
Of course I got a heal.

4494
02:59:57,450 --> 03:00:07,319
You know, I've been crafting healing items.

4495
03:00:07,879 --> 03:00:09,079
I don't have any of the stuff.

4496
03:00:12,059 --> 03:00:13,500
Oh, there's still a few more somewhere.

4497
03:00:16,500 --> 03:00:20,889
Oh, we're searching containers.

4498
03:00:21,610 --> 03:00:22,819
There's a lot of stuff over there.

4499
03:00:24,020 --> 03:00:24,579
I see.

4500
03:00:27,139 --> 03:00:29,379
I'm hacking in with my hack stick.

4501
03:00:32,090 --> 03:00:34,250
I do like the idea of a hack stick.

4502
03:00:34,250 --> 03:00:34,809
I think it's cool.

4503
03:00:36,409 --> 03:00:37,530
Oh, we got a hammer.

4504
03:00:38,329 --> 03:00:40,809
Yeah, I like I like a hack stick, but I think it's way cooler if you like.

4505
03:00:41,290 --> 03:00:45,290
On like the end of an arrow and then you shoot it into a USB port.

4506
03:00:46,579 --> 03:00:48,739
Obviously, it would never go in right the first way.

4507
03:00:48,739 --> 03:00:51,139
It would bounce off because you didn't have it the right way.

4508
03:00:51,139 --> 03:00:52,100
Like all USB sticks.

4509
03:00:53,299 --> 03:00:54,420
And then you shoot it a second time.

4510
03:00:55,510 --> 03:00:56,549
I can't open that box.

4511
03:00:57,510 --> 03:01:01,909
Hey, bro.

4512
03:01:01,909 --> 03:01:03,110
Oh, man, dude, it's bad.

4513
03:01:03,110 --> 03:01:20,250
It was such an enormous joke.

4514
03:01:20,809 --> 03:01:26,629
Nobody said that.

4515
03:01:26,629 --> 03:01:26,950
I did.

4516
03:01:29,819 --> 03:01:33,979
What's with these fake boxes where it's only like an inch deep?

4517
03:01:33,979 --> 03:01:38,569
Yeah, it's almost like this.

4518
03:01:39,290 --> 03:01:41,129
It's like this is a magic trick case.

4519
03:01:42,139 --> 03:01:43,420
Yeah, the body's in the bottom.

4520
03:01:44,299 --> 03:01:45,739
The real thing is underneath.

4521
03:01:45,739 --> 03:01:47,020
You open it, then you close it.

4522
03:01:47,020 --> 03:01:49,819
You press the magic button that lifts this too.

4523
03:01:49,819 --> 03:01:51,420
And then the other thing is in there.

4524
03:01:51,420 --> 03:01:53,100
Are you really giving away the whole trick?

4525
03:01:54,579 --> 03:01:56,579
Yeah, that's like that's how it works.

4526
03:01:57,379 --> 03:01:58,180
That's not cool.

4527
03:01:59,500 --> 03:02:00,540
Did I just turn that offer on?

4528
03:02:02,100 --> 03:02:02,659
It was on.

4529
03:02:04,500 --> 03:02:06,899
We're looking for we got to search one more box.

4530
03:02:06,899 --> 03:02:08,500
Wait, was this it?

4531
03:02:09,219 --> 03:02:11,219
OK, we got it.

4532
03:02:11,219 --> 03:02:13,219
Apparently, we got everything of value.

4533
03:02:13,219 --> 03:02:13,700
Nice.

4534
03:02:13,700 --> 03:02:14,579
Time to head out of here.

4535
03:02:17,700 --> 03:02:20,979
Oh, you you you really need some DSing on that, bro.

4536
03:02:24,219 --> 03:02:27,639
OK, bro, we just climb over here.

4537
03:02:28,950 --> 03:02:29,510
That hurt me.

4538
03:02:30,739 --> 03:02:31,540
Did it?

4539
03:02:31,540 --> 03:02:33,430
And they do things, Bob.

4540
03:02:33,430 --> 03:02:36,389
Yep, there's like you made it until you jump.

4541
03:02:37,110 --> 03:02:39,579
But how did you make it over?

4542
03:02:39,579 --> 03:02:40,219
I don't know.

4543
03:02:40,219 --> 03:02:40,780
I did the skip.

4544
03:02:43,079 --> 03:02:43,799
Oh, OK, I got it.

4545
03:02:48,920 --> 03:02:49,959
Oh, back other way.

4546
03:02:50,680 --> 03:02:53,420
Oh, we got to move this.

4547
03:02:54,299 --> 03:02:56,059
Oh, my God.

4548
03:02:56,059 --> 03:02:57,180
It's like a piece of wood.

4549
03:02:59,260 --> 03:03:00,219
Get over it, Aiden.

4550
03:03:01,579 --> 03:03:02,459
He's a plywood.

4551
03:03:03,500 --> 03:03:04,620
Do you know how they make plywood?

4552
03:03:05,260 --> 03:03:07,659
From wood?

4553
03:03:08,379 --> 03:03:12,940
They spin a tree like they shave a tree really thinly

4554
03:03:12,940 --> 03:03:15,500
and they mush all the pieces together that they shave

4555
03:03:15,500 --> 03:03:16,700
with like water and stuff and glue.

4556
03:03:17,500 --> 03:03:27,180
OK, I'm hearing ghosts.

4557
03:03:28,219 --> 03:03:31,379
I think we can leave.

4558
03:03:31,379 --> 03:03:34,579
This game is fun.

4559
03:03:35,899 --> 03:03:36,399
Pirates.

4560
03:03:37,180 --> 03:03:38,739
Did you find the stash?

4561
03:03:39,459 --> 03:03:40,340
Sure did.

4562
03:03:40,340 --> 03:03:41,860
Thanks for the lockpicks.

4563
03:03:41,860 --> 03:03:43,879
But what are you still doing here?

4564
03:03:44,520 --> 03:03:45,159
Is this him?

4565
03:03:45,799 --> 03:03:46,299
Sure is.

4566
03:03:46,840 --> 03:03:48,520
He was kind enough to get the goods for us.

4567
03:03:49,399 --> 03:03:50,920
Saved us a lot of trouble.

4568
03:03:50,920 --> 03:03:51,479
Very good.

4569
03:03:52,200 --> 03:03:54,120
So he's got a fanny pack.

4570
03:03:58,840 --> 03:04:00,680
Well, it's cool now like Kanye brought it back.

4571
03:04:01,319 --> 03:04:01,959
I'm just kidding.

4572
03:04:01,959 --> 03:04:02,360
I don't care.

4573
03:04:03,319 --> 03:04:04,840
You should care about fashion.

4574
03:04:04,840 --> 03:04:06,280
And now we don't need you.

4575
03:04:06,840 --> 03:04:09,079
So do we get counted?

4576
03:04:10,219 --> 03:04:12,059
More people keep coming on from stage.

4577
03:04:12,059 --> 03:04:12,860
Oh, wait, do we fight?

4578
03:04:12,860 --> 03:04:14,059
Do we do a little shit?

4579
03:04:14,059 --> 03:04:15,100
Oh, my God.

4580
03:04:15,100 --> 03:04:16,790
I counted.

4581
03:04:16,790 --> 03:04:17,590
Five corpses.

4582
03:04:17,590 --> 03:04:18,309
Five corpses.

4583
03:04:18,309 --> 03:04:19,829
Kill him and take the goods.

4584
03:04:19,829 --> 03:04:20,469
Oh, kill him.

4585
03:04:21,110 --> 03:04:22,069
Five corpses.

4586
03:04:22,069 --> 03:04:23,030
I thought that was in the game.

4587
03:04:23,030 --> 03:04:24,309
I thought that was one of those people here.

4588
03:04:26,100 --> 03:04:27,139
I'm going to get you.

4589
03:04:28,260 --> 03:04:29,459
Hey, how are we going to do this?

4590
03:04:29,459 --> 03:04:30,500
What tactical way are we going to?

4591
03:04:43,079 --> 03:04:45,079
Oh, yeah, you can't block power attacks.

4592
03:04:45,079 --> 03:04:45,879
I'm down.

4593
03:04:45,879 --> 03:04:46,379
Are you dead?

4594
03:04:47,399 --> 03:04:47,899
Yeah.

4595
03:04:49,370 --> 03:04:50,969
Wait, wait, wait.

4596
03:04:50,969 --> 03:04:51,770
Just hide on the truck.

4597
03:04:52,569 --> 03:04:54,120
How much health do you have?

4598
03:04:54,120 --> 03:04:54,840
How much time do you have?

4599
03:05:00,120 --> 03:05:00,760
Oh, my God.

4600
03:05:00,760 --> 03:05:01,239
Blow this up.

4601
03:05:07,219 --> 03:05:09,239
I got you.

4602
03:05:10,420 --> 03:05:11,139
Let's go.

4603
03:05:11,139 --> 03:05:12,500
Let's get this going.

4604
03:05:12,500 --> 03:05:13,000
Come on.

4605
03:05:13,860 --> 03:05:14,360
Watch out.

4606
03:05:15,379 --> 03:05:21,670
He's just taking it.

4607
03:05:21,670 --> 03:05:22,389
He's just taking it.

4608
03:05:23,270 --> 03:05:24,629
His head is thick.

4609
03:05:33,579 --> 03:05:35,020
He just popped him up.

4610
03:05:35,020 --> 03:05:36,219
Like we were on a trampoline.

4611
03:05:36,219 --> 03:05:37,020
What the fuck was that?

4612
03:05:40,540 --> 03:05:51,319
Wings.

4613
03:05:54,379 --> 03:06:02,260
You do these gigantic swings with two-handed swords in this game

4614
03:06:02,260 --> 03:06:02,979
and the person's head just spins.

4615
03:06:02,979 --> 03:06:04,340
Why do these guys have so many?

4616
03:06:04,340 --> 03:06:05,459
OK, I'm taking out two-hander too.

4617
03:06:05,459 --> 03:06:06,260
Two-hander versus two-hander.

4618
03:06:11,989 --> 03:06:12,629
I'm on the map.

4619
03:06:15,100 --> 03:06:18,649
How much health does this guy have?

4620
03:06:20,569 --> 03:06:31,879
I don't have any health potions left.

4621
03:06:31,879 --> 03:06:32,680
Well, whatever they are.

4622
03:06:33,559 --> 03:06:34,790
Hold on, mate.

4623
03:06:34,790 --> 03:06:35,350
Time out.

4624
03:06:35,350 --> 03:06:35,750
Time out.

4625
03:06:35,750 --> 03:06:36,069
Time out.

4626
03:06:36,069 --> 03:06:36,870
Time out.

4627
03:06:36,870 --> 03:06:37,370
Time out.

4628
03:06:40,309 --> 03:06:48,989
Damn.

4629
03:06:48,989 --> 03:06:49,450
Are we?

4630
03:06:49,450 --> 03:06:51,530
Why was this taking us so long?

4631
03:06:51,530 --> 03:06:52,090
I don't know.

4632
03:06:52,090 --> 03:06:54,969
Because our weapons are made out of duct tape, maybe?

4633
03:06:59,899 --> 03:07:01,500
There might be health in that box to your left.

4634
03:07:03,610 --> 03:07:04,809
He didn't even come close.

4635
03:07:04,809 --> 03:07:05,690
What was that hitbox?

4636
03:07:09,620 --> 03:07:11,940
He just berserker whirlwinded.

4637
03:07:14,100 --> 03:07:14,739
Take one of these.

4638
03:07:15,459 --> 03:07:16,579
I can't even look over there.

4639
03:07:21,620 --> 03:07:24,020
You are off-camera fighting these people.

4640
03:07:24,020 --> 03:07:24,579
I'm coming in.

4641
03:07:24,579 --> 03:07:25,620
I'm coming into camera.

4642
03:07:25,620 --> 03:07:28,260
I'm just waiting for a body to fly across the screen.

4643
03:07:42,979 --> 03:07:44,020
I feel like we're LARPing.

4644
03:07:44,579 --> 03:07:47,219
And I'm really disappointed right now because I feel like that sucks.

4645
03:07:47,219 --> 03:07:50,340
I came here, I dressed up, I brought my huge sword that I had crafted.

4646
03:07:50,979 --> 03:07:52,659
And somebody tagged me in the leg and it was like,

4647
03:07:52,659 --> 03:07:53,059
Dad!

4648
03:07:53,059 --> 03:07:54,020
And it's like, come on, dude.

4649
03:07:54,020 --> 03:07:55,620
Really, I get to watch the cool part now.

4650
03:07:58,860 --> 03:07:59,340
I got you.

4651
03:08:01,479 --> 03:08:02,680
Like, I have to watch you do that.

4652
03:08:02,680 --> 03:08:04,780
They're not going to stop me.

4653
03:08:04,780 --> 03:08:05,739
Get up, buddy.

4654
03:08:05,739 --> 03:08:06,139
You're fine.

4655
03:08:06,780 --> 03:08:08,139
You're going to stop fucking crying about it.

4656
03:08:09,020 --> 03:08:11,110
I take this right out of the pocket.

4657
03:08:16,500 --> 03:08:19,219
Yeah, you missed, by the way.

4658
03:08:22,469 --> 03:08:25,700
There's something in this chest.

4659
03:08:29,020 --> 03:08:33,000
I love when they have like a stream of blood coming out of their body.

4660
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:33,959
Yeah, that was weird.

4661
03:08:33,959 --> 03:08:35,399
Like, snakes just came out of them.

4662
03:08:37,959 --> 03:08:46,069
Okay, honestly, God, why is it taking so long?

4663
03:08:47,030 --> 03:08:47,989
There's a skeleton here.

4664
03:08:52,020 --> 03:08:52,579
I'm in pain.

4665
03:08:53,620 --> 03:08:56,659
He's coming up behind you.

4666
03:08:57,299 --> 03:09:01,639
I got a new weapon.

4667
03:09:02,200 --> 03:09:03,479
What is it?

4668
03:09:04,889 --> 03:09:05,450
It's gone.

4669
03:09:05,450 --> 03:09:06,899
No, it's not.

4670
03:09:06,899 --> 03:09:13,510
Where's his weapon?

4671
03:09:13,510 --> 03:09:13,909
What happened?

4672
03:09:14,870 --> 03:09:17,909
What the fuck is happening?

4673
03:09:17,909 --> 03:09:19,110
It's gone.

4674
03:09:19,110 --> 03:09:19,590
What?

4675
03:09:19,590 --> 03:09:20,629
He doesn't have a weapon.

4676
03:09:20,629 --> 03:09:26,120
Where are you, asshole?

4677
03:09:26,120 --> 03:09:27,239
It's gone.

4678
03:09:34,620 --> 03:09:35,579
We are dead here.

4679
03:09:38,260 --> 03:09:39,780
This is a guy in a costume.

4680
03:09:39,780 --> 03:09:40,979
This isn't even a guy.

4681
03:09:40,979 --> 03:09:41,459
I'm dead.

4682
03:09:42,420 --> 03:09:43,780
No, please.

4683
03:09:45,879 --> 03:09:47,479
I couldn't save you, Gascan.

4684
03:09:48,280 --> 03:09:49,479
I don't think he can die now.

4685
03:09:50,360 --> 03:09:53,079
You cut his head off and he just kept swinging.

4686
03:09:53,079 --> 03:09:54,280
Can you pull me to you?

4687
03:09:55,079 --> 03:09:56,040
No, you're dead, man.

4688
03:09:56,040 --> 03:09:57,000
No, I'm alive again.

4689
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:57,639
Can you pull me?

4690
03:09:59,850 --> 03:10:00,569
No, I can't.

4691
03:10:01,530 --> 03:10:03,290
Are you still running away from that guy?

4692
03:10:03,290 --> 03:10:04,729
He's dancing now.

4693
03:10:06,260 --> 03:10:06,659
Hold on.

4694
03:10:06,659 --> 03:10:07,219
I'm coming to you.

4695
03:10:14,389 --> 03:10:15,510
He thinks I'm invisible.

4696
03:10:17,430 --> 03:10:18,549
I gotta get there quick.

4697
03:10:19,190 --> 03:10:28,059
That was so stupid.

4698
03:10:28,059 --> 03:10:30,139
Okay, on my screen, he didn't have a weapon.

4699
03:10:30,139 --> 03:10:31,180
And then his head came off.

4700
03:10:31,899 --> 03:10:34,540
Yeah, you walked up to the side of him and cut his head off.

4701
03:10:34,620 --> 03:10:35,659
And he dropped his weapon.

4702
03:10:35,659 --> 03:10:36,780
He just started punching at you.

4703
03:10:36,780 --> 03:10:37,819
I thought it was like a...

4704
03:10:37,819 --> 03:10:41,260
I thought the game was doing an actual like chicken headless joke.

4705
03:10:43,079 --> 03:10:43,479
Hold on.

4706
03:10:43,479 --> 03:10:43,959
Keep him there.

4707
03:10:43,959 --> 03:10:44,600
Keep him there.

4708
03:10:44,600 --> 03:10:45,399
We gotta like...

4709
03:10:45,399 --> 03:10:46,600
We gotta take this guy somewhere.

4710
03:10:47,159 --> 03:10:49,100
I'm almost there.

4711
03:10:49,100 --> 03:10:50,379
He's still here.

4712
03:10:50,379 --> 03:10:52,540
I mean, we didn't get the reward for the quest.

4713
03:10:52,540 --> 03:10:53,020
We didn't?

4714
03:10:53,979 --> 03:10:54,780
What's going on here?

4715
03:11:00,040 --> 03:11:01,000
Are you able to get in here?

4716
03:11:02,440 --> 03:11:03,159
I'm in trouble.

4717
03:11:03,159 --> 03:11:03,479
Hold on.

4718
03:11:05,299 --> 03:11:06,020
I ran into...

4719
03:11:07,059 --> 03:11:09,219
Who's playing a clown horn?

4720
03:11:09,459 --> 03:11:10,100
What was that?

4721
03:11:12,549 --> 03:11:14,229
Somebody just like, oh, look at me.

4722
03:11:15,030 --> 03:11:18,940
God damn it.

4723
03:11:18,940 --> 03:11:19,659
Okay, I gotta run.

4724
03:11:21,159 --> 03:11:21,799
You're not far.

4725
03:11:21,799 --> 03:11:23,000
Just come here, man.

4726
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:23,559
Oh, shit.

4727
03:11:24,440 --> 03:11:26,520
Run, run, run, run, run.

4728
03:11:26,520 --> 03:11:40,170
Yeah, I don't know how you...

4729
03:11:40,170 --> 03:11:40,969
All right, so where is he?

4730
03:11:46,520 --> 03:11:47,559
I can hear him swearing.

4731
03:11:48,280 --> 03:11:53,379
Yeah, he's still talking.

4732
03:12:00,069 --> 03:12:01,909
You motherfucker.

4733
03:12:03,989 --> 03:12:09,049
So what did we do?

4734
03:12:09,049 --> 03:12:10,329
We didn't get the quest reward?

4735
03:12:10,329 --> 03:12:11,770
What are we supposed to do about this?

4736
03:12:11,770 --> 03:12:14,090
I think we're supposed to go turn in the quest to the guy now

4737
03:12:14,090 --> 03:12:15,370
because it's giving me the other marker.

4738
03:12:16,649 --> 03:12:19,739
Okay, well...

4739
03:12:19,739 --> 03:12:22,299
If you press Q, you can still see his head.

4740
03:12:22,299 --> 03:12:22,780
It's there.

4741
03:12:23,659 --> 03:12:24,700
All right, so we can just leave.

4742
03:12:25,819 --> 03:12:28,709
Yeah, he's gonna kill me.

4743
03:12:31,690 --> 03:12:32,729
How are you this good?

4744
03:12:36,739 --> 03:12:37,540
Can we kill him again?

4745
03:12:40,020 --> 03:12:43,700
I don't think we can kill him again.

4746
03:12:43,700 --> 03:12:44,340
Let's go.

4747
03:12:44,340 --> 03:12:44,739
Yeah, run.

4748
03:12:46,569 --> 03:12:47,610
Okay, wrap around here

4749
03:12:47,610 --> 03:12:49,370
because there was like a weird quest with this guy.

4750
03:12:49,370 --> 03:12:50,969
I had like, he was handcuffed.

4751
03:12:51,690 --> 03:12:54,579
Oh, so you want to like go unhandcuff him?

4752
03:12:54,579 --> 03:12:55,700
Yeah, I tried to.

4753
03:12:55,700 --> 03:12:56,340
He's right over here.

4754
03:12:56,899 --> 03:12:58,260
Do the Uwuga thing?

4755
03:12:58,260 --> 03:12:58,979
Yeah, he's over here.

4756
03:13:07,959 --> 03:13:09,159
Okay, they grouped up now.

4757
03:13:12,100 --> 03:13:19,540
Yeah, do it.

4758
03:13:21,780 --> 03:13:23,899
Oh, damn it.

4759
03:13:23,899 --> 03:13:25,100
Another headless guy.

4760
03:13:25,100 --> 03:13:25,899
Oh no, he's staying down.

4761
03:13:25,899 --> 03:13:26,399
Good.

4762
03:13:27,020 --> 03:13:31,479
This guy's holding a foam bat.

4763
03:13:31,479 --> 03:13:32,360
That's not gonna hurt anyway.

4764
03:13:37,059 --> 03:13:39,559
All right, we rescued this guy.

4765
03:13:40,760 --> 03:13:41,239
Excuse me.

4766
03:13:41,239 --> 03:13:41,719
What are you doing?

4767
03:13:42,600 --> 03:13:44,059
I'm doing parkour.

4768
03:13:44,059 --> 03:13:45,260
No, the guy that we rescued.

4769
03:13:47,260 --> 03:13:49,799
Wait, is he trying to fight you?

4770
03:13:49,799 --> 03:13:50,760
Yes, I don't know what happened.

4771
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:53,799
He's keeper rescued.

4772
03:13:53,799 --> 03:13:54,280
He's mad.

4773
03:13:54,920 --> 03:13:55,559
Wait, is he mad?

4774
03:13:56,600 --> 03:14:00,219
I think he's, he gave up.

4775
03:14:01,260 --> 03:14:03,500
All right, take his head off.

4776
03:14:09,399 --> 03:14:14,329
Take his head.

4777
03:14:14,329 --> 03:14:18,729
We're doing like no damage to him.

4778
03:14:18,729 --> 03:14:19,610
Why can't we hurt him?

4779
03:14:21,049 --> 03:14:22,969
I think you might have to like harry these guys

4780
03:14:22,969 --> 03:14:23,930
to get their helmet off.

4781
03:14:25,770 --> 03:14:32,440
He's got a black eye.

4782
03:14:35,079 --> 03:14:36,600
After all that, he has a shiner.

4783
03:14:37,239 --> 03:14:38,200
He's got a black eye.

4784
03:14:45,319 --> 03:14:45,799
Just leave him.

4785
03:14:46,979 --> 03:14:48,020
It's not worth our time.

4786
03:14:50,069 --> 03:14:57,110
Take some money.

4787
03:14:57,110 --> 03:14:57,909
Are we climbing this?

4788
03:14:58,950 --> 03:14:59,829
I like climbing.

4789
03:15:02,069 --> 03:15:03,459
Where are we going?

4790
03:15:03,459 --> 03:15:04,579
He's following you.

4791
03:15:06,840 --> 03:15:07,319
We're going on.

4792
03:15:07,319 --> 03:15:08,040
We're going this way.

4793
03:15:08,040 --> 03:15:08,440
Follow me.

4794
03:15:08,440 --> 03:15:10,440
He's picking up rocks and throwing them at us.

4795
03:15:11,159 --> 03:15:12,120
Yeah, he doesn't like us.

4796
03:15:12,120 --> 03:15:12,840
Let's go.

4797
03:15:12,840 --> 03:15:13,799
Hey, another cop car.

4798
03:15:14,840 --> 03:15:16,200
There's definitely nothing in there.

4799
03:15:16,200 --> 03:15:16,700
Let's go.

4800
03:15:17,399 --> 03:15:27,850
You want to stick to the roots.

4801
03:15:27,850 --> 03:15:30,329
Generally, you want to stick to the roof tops in this game.

4802
03:15:30,329 --> 03:15:30,969
Okay.

4803
03:15:30,969 --> 03:15:32,569
Who has the goofy horn?

4804
03:15:33,450 --> 03:15:34,569
I'm not hearing a horn.

4805
03:15:34,969 --> 03:15:35,930
Am I going crazy?

4806
03:15:35,930 --> 03:15:37,610
You don't hear a goofy horn.

4807
03:15:37,610 --> 03:15:43,420
I don't hear anything in that building.

4808
03:15:43,420 --> 03:15:46,620
I shouldn't have locked back.

4809
03:15:46,620 --> 03:15:47,500
I need lock that guy.

4810
03:15:48,540 --> 03:15:49,739
Oh, you're too far away.

4811
03:15:49,739 --> 03:15:52,459
I guess I'll just do it and you'll be like irrelevant.

4812
03:15:52,459 --> 03:15:55,829
Now you're kind of far right here right now.

4813
03:16:03,270 --> 03:16:06,059
Where's the lock?

4814
03:16:07,379 --> 03:16:08,020
There was this door.

4815
03:16:08,020 --> 03:16:08,420
I opened it.

4816
03:16:08,420 --> 03:16:09,219
There's nothing in here.

4817
03:16:17,739 --> 03:16:18,379
There's a question.

4818
03:16:18,379 --> 03:16:19,579
There's a question mark over here.

4819
03:16:19,579 --> 03:16:20,780
I want to go see the question mark.

4820
03:16:20,780 --> 03:16:21,280
Okay.

4821
03:16:22,170 --> 03:16:22,729
That was dumb.

4822
03:16:24,729 --> 03:16:25,610
Jumping off the roof.

4823
03:16:25,610 --> 03:16:26,250
Oh, you did it too.

4824
03:16:26,969 --> 03:16:28,809
I've made it, I guess.

4825
03:16:34,750 --> 03:16:37,069
I need to craft heals.

4826
03:16:39,370 --> 03:16:41,450
Apparently, we're supposed to come back at night.

4827
03:16:42,170 --> 03:16:43,899
I'm back at night.

4828
03:16:44,989 --> 03:16:45,469
All right.

4829
03:16:45,469 --> 03:16:45,790
Okay.

4830
03:16:45,790 --> 03:16:46,110
I don't.

4831
03:16:48,200 --> 03:16:49,159
It's a dark zone.

4832
03:16:50,639 --> 03:16:52,000
I don't know.

4833
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:58,959
Oh, I can unlock far jump or running speed.

4834
03:16:59,760 --> 03:17:02,639
I'll do far jump.

4835
03:17:03,280 --> 03:17:06,559
When you get the cast like fireball.

4836
03:17:08,520 --> 03:17:11,479
So I seriously haven't like we've leveled up like one time.

4837
03:17:12,200 --> 03:17:14,440
Does that just mean we're not doing anything?

4838
03:17:15,340 --> 03:17:16,700
Maybe or we didn't get like the

4839
03:17:27,049 --> 03:17:28,799
About the halftime show.

4840
03:17:29,520 --> 03:17:32,079
I don't what do you want me to say about it?

4841
03:17:32,079 --> 03:17:33,200
I don't I'm not watching it.

4842
03:17:33,920 --> 03:17:38,639
Can you please react?

4843
03:17:41,549 --> 03:17:46,200
We have to actually go find honey.

4844
03:17:46,200 --> 03:17:49,930
Pretty sure we could like go to a place and buy it.

4845
03:17:51,290 --> 03:17:52,969
Yeah, I'm out of healing again.

4846
03:17:56,200 --> 03:17:56,920
Are you kidding me?

4847
03:17:57,479 --> 03:17:59,159
I fell at that last second there.

4848
03:18:02,250 --> 03:18:02,649
React.

4849
03:18:03,209 --> 03:18:06,319
No, I'm not reacting to the Super Bowl halftime show.

4850
03:18:09,209 --> 03:18:10,010
Who's performing?

4851
03:18:10,569 --> 03:18:11,049
I don't know.

4852
03:18:11,930 --> 03:18:13,209
I can react to that.

4853
03:18:14,319 --> 03:18:16,000
Is it fucking Barney again?

4854
03:18:19,040 --> 03:18:22,079
Barney comes on stage and they do like a whole routine with them.

4855
03:18:22,079 --> 03:18:22,799
Yeah.

4856
03:18:22,799 --> 03:18:25,200
Yeah, last year it was Barney and baby Bob.

4857
03:18:29,840 --> 03:18:30,959
I actually would watch that.

4858
03:18:31,680 --> 03:18:33,370
That was the halftime show.

4859
03:18:34,170 --> 03:18:36,729
Why do so many NPCs have this hair?

4860
03:18:36,729 --> 03:18:39,290
Because we keep coming back and talking to the same guy.

4861
03:18:46,440 --> 03:18:48,280
It's not it's a different.

4862
03:18:48,280 --> 03:18:49,559
It's not a different person.

4863
03:18:49,559 --> 03:18:50,680
What are you talking about?

4864
03:18:54,200 --> 03:19:01,610
Oh, that hair is what I don't feel like that hairstyle is always

4865
03:19:01,610 --> 03:19:04,809
selectable in any game that has character customization.

4866
03:19:04,809 --> 03:19:08,489
The just bizarre buzz cut in the wrong spots.

4867
03:19:08,489 --> 03:19:10,010
It's always like number.

4868
03:19:10,010 --> 03:19:11,690
It's only the second row always.

4869
03:19:12,409 --> 03:19:13,370
We got to rescue this guy.

4870
03:19:17,049 --> 03:19:20,040
Yeah, when dropping onto enemy from above.

4871
03:19:20,600 --> 03:19:22,840
He's like, what the fuck just happened?

4872
03:19:22,840 --> 03:19:24,040
He's like, holy shit.

4873
03:19:24,040 --> 03:19:25,959
Wait, you jumped out and died?

4874
03:19:25,959 --> 03:19:27,639
This guy's face is like, oh my God.

4875
03:19:36,600 --> 03:19:44,329
What was that?

4876
03:19:44,329 --> 03:19:45,290
I don't know what's happening.

4877
03:19:46,010 --> 03:19:48,010
Somebody's holding down a piano key.

4878
03:19:51,739 --> 03:19:53,739
He's got a song machine.

4879
03:19:53,739 --> 03:19:55,819
What was that song music maker?

4880
03:19:58,559 --> 03:19:59,360
I want one of those.

4881
03:19:59,360 --> 03:20:00,479
That thing is insane.

4882
03:20:01,760 --> 03:20:02,879
Who is this guy?

4883
03:20:02,879 --> 03:20:04,399
Why does he not have a health bar?

4884
03:20:05,200 --> 03:20:06,239
Where's his health bar?

4885
03:20:11,370 --> 03:20:13,129
This guy doesn't have a health bar, sir.

4886
03:20:14,010 --> 03:20:14,969
The sun's going down.

4887
03:20:20,250 --> 03:20:23,209
No, stop playing the fucking funny music.

4888
03:20:23,209 --> 03:20:24,329
I'm not hearing it.

4889
03:20:27,530 --> 03:20:28,030
Shut up.

4890
03:20:36,920 --> 03:20:38,120
All right, let's help this guy.

4891
03:20:40,540 --> 03:20:43,100
Look at all these homeless people that come off the street.

4892
03:20:43,100 --> 03:20:44,299
Like, oh, there's a fight going on.

4893
03:20:44,299 --> 03:20:44,940
I'm coming in.

4894
03:20:45,739 --> 03:20:46,239
We got him.

4895
03:20:47,100 --> 03:20:49,760
Holy shit, this guy's good.

4896
03:20:50,479 --> 03:20:51,520
Who is this guy?

4897
03:20:52,319 --> 03:20:56,750
I'm doing a 1v1.

4898
03:21:03,520 --> 03:21:07,600
Why does it have a trophy?

4899
03:21:08,319 --> 03:21:11,479
All right, let them 1v1.

4900
03:21:12,639 --> 03:21:13,200
Let them fight it out.

4901
03:21:13,200 --> 03:21:13,700
Let them fight.

4902
03:21:14,639 --> 03:21:15,139
Okay.

4903
03:21:15,920 --> 03:21:16,959
There's zombies coming.

4904
03:21:17,920 --> 03:21:20,479
I have no healing.

4905
03:21:20,479 --> 03:21:21,200
No, no.

4906
03:21:21,200 --> 03:21:22,239
What the fuck, dude?

4907
03:21:23,120 --> 03:21:25,530
I've had enough.

4908
03:21:25,530 --> 03:21:26,030
We gotta go.

4909
03:21:26,030 --> 03:21:26,530
Let's go.

4910
03:21:33,489 --> 03:21:34,530
Can we have a bar and kill him?

4911
03:21:35,170 --> 03:21:37,139
He has a trophy on him.

4912
03:21:40,370 --> 03:21:41,569
Let's finish saving him.

4913
03:21:42,290 --> 03:21:44,129
He's in danger.

4914
03:21:45,090 --> 03:21:46,399
Okay.

4915
03:21:46,780 --> 03:21:48,190
Does he, like, talk to us?

4916
03:21:50,270 --> 03:21:50,750
Oh, yeah.

4917
03:21:50,750 --> 03:21:52,110
I could, like, take it from him.

4918
03:21:52,110 --> 03:21:53,069
Take the trophy from him?

4919
03:21:53,069 --> 03:21:53,709
Okay, get it.

4920
03:21:54,350 --> 03:21:54,850
I got it.

4921
03:21:55,469 --> 03:21:56,110
How do I get it?

4922
03:21:56,110 --> 03:21:56,590
I can't get it.

4923
03:21:56,590 --> 03:21:57,229
I can't take anything.

4924
03:21:58,750 --> 03:22:00,190
That probably hurt so bad.

4925
03:22:01,069 --> 03:22:03,299
All right, here.

4926
03:22:03,299 --> 03:22:03,940
Thanks for the help.

4927
03:22:04,739 --> 03:22:10,299
Okay, let's go.

4928
03:22:11,659 --> 03:22:12,139
Rooftops.

4929
03:22:12,139 --> 03:22:12,639
We're in trouble.

4930
03:22:15,149 --> 03:22:15,649
Are we?

4931
03:22:16,190 --> 03:22:17,389
I don't feel threatened.

4932
03:22:18,110 --> 03:22:28,299
Somebody just called me Original Sin Andy.

4933
03:22:29,020 --> 03:22:33,069
Well, like, I haven't been baptized.

4934
03:22:33,069 --> 03:22:34,670
What the fuck is that message?

4935
03:22:34,670 --> 03:22:35,469
What is that comment?

4936
03:22:36,270 --> 03:22:37,549
Divinity Original Sin?

4937
03:22:38,270 --> 03:22:38,770
Good game.

4938
03:22:39,309 --> 03:22:42,659
This guy's gonna be a fruit.

4939
03:22:47,680 --> 03:22:52,030
Okay.

4940
03:22:52,030 --> 03:22:53,739
Can we eat those?

4941
03:22:53,739 --> 03:22:59,540
What did you do?

4942
03:22:59,540 --> 03:23:00,739
I threw a coin at his head.

4943
03:23:03,780 --> 03:23:04,420
He's on the run.

4944
03:23:04,420 --> 03:23:04,920
He's running.

4945
03:23:05,799 --> 03:23:06,760
Running for his life.

4946
03:23:08,440 --> 03:23:11,399
He's guilty of something.

4947
03:23:12,850 --> 03:23:13,350
What the fuck?

4948
03:23:13,969 --> 03:23:14,469
Like, he just...

4949
03:23:15,809 --> 03:23:17,250
He was just eating an apple.

4950
03:23:17,250 --> 03:23:18,129
He didn't even do anything.

4951
03:23:18,129 --> 03:23:18,770
You're a dick.

4952
03:23:19,409 --> 03:23:20,530
All right, quest is this way.

4953
03:23:21,250 --> 03:23:26,200
Let's go.

4954
03:23:26,200 --> 03:23:28,239
You gotta stop fooling around.

4955
03:23:28,879 --> 03:23:31,250
How are we ever gonna get the antidote?

4956
03:23:32,239 --> 03:23:32,959
Oh, wait, nighttime.

4957
03:23:32,959 --> 03:23:33,520
Let's go in here.

4958
03:23:33,520 --> 03:23:34,319
This was the place.

4959
03:23:34,319 --> 03:23:35,200
Oh, that's right.

4960
03:23:35,200 --> 03:23:35,700
You're right.

4961
03:23:36,239 --> 03:23:36,799
I'll watch out.

4962
03:23:36,799 --> 03:23:38,079
There's a, there's a scorcher.

4963
03:23:38,719 --> 03:23:42,530
I'd be careful in here.

4964
03:23:43,170 --> 03:23:44,770
Oh, there's one right there.

4965
03:23:44,770 --> 03:23:50,719
You don't want to alert him.

4966
03:23:50,719 --> 03:23:54,079
You wouldn't want to start playing the sound machine right now.

4967
03:23:57,440 --> 03:23:58,159
I think one person.

4968
03:23:59,520 --> 03:24:05,540
Oh, there's one more.

4969
03:24:05,540 --> 03:24:06,579
Sorry, I got it wrong.

4970
03:24:06,579 --> 03:24:07,299
One more person.

4971
03:24:08,819 --> 03:24:12,500
My zombie powers are showing that there's a lot of enemies in here.

4972
03:24:16,399 --> 03:24:18,559
Some of them in coats, some of them in pants.

4973
03:24:20,920 --> 03:24:21,559
I'm not seeing it.

4974
03:24:23,159 --> 03:24:25,479
I'm like an 800 on my experience here.

4975
03:24:26,280 --> 03:24:27,000
Are you actually?

4976
03:24:27,000 --> 03:24:27,500
Okay.

4977
03:24:27,739 --> 03:24:29,979
I feel like I'm starting to see a lot of the game and it's,

4978
03:24:30,620 --> 03:24:31,979
I've seen a lot of the same, you know?

4979
03:24:31,979 --> 03:24:34,299
So I feel like my experience meter is actually going up.

4980
03:24:34,299 --> 03:24:35,579
So you're, how far are you at the?

4981
03:24:36,940 --> 03:24:38,059
800 out of a thousand.

4982
03:24:39,299 --> 03:24:40,579
I'll say 823.

4983
03:24:41,860 --> 03:24:43,139
Nice round number.

4984
03:24:43,139 --> 03:24:43,459
You know what?

4985
03:24:43,459 --> 03:24:43,940
I'll be honest.

4986
03:24:43,940 --> 03:24:46,579
I'm probably getting kind of close too to be able to say that as well.

4987
03:24:50,459 --> 03:24:50,940
Blades.

4988
03:25:00,819 --> 03:25:01,379
You're gonna be.

4989
03:25:01,379 --> 03:25:02,340
Lock back guy.

4990
03:25:02,340 --> 03:25:03,059
Lock back guy.

4991
03:25:03,780 --> 03:25:06,379
We got some big loot in here.

4992
03:25:06,379 --> 03:25:06,940
This is odd.

4993
03:25:12,340 --> 03:25:12,979
I know where it is.

4994
03:25:12,979 --> 03:25:13,700
Don't worry.

4995
03:25:13,700 --> 03:25:19,930
I, what happened?

4996
03:25:21,940 --> 03:25:22,500
He fell over.

4997
03:25:25,459 --> 03:25:26,180
You're a bit silly.

4998
03:25:26,180 --> 03:25:27,219
You're doing some ditzy stuff.

4999
03:25:32,520 --> 03:25:33,399
Oh, you fuck.

5000
03:25:33,959 --> 03:25:36,020
That's right there.

5001
03:25:36,020 --> 03:25:36,579
A little bit more.

5002
03:25:40,950 --> 03:25:41,450
Ooh.

5003
03:25:43,030 --> 03:25:43,530
Urgent.

5004
03:25:45,739 --> 03:25:53,770
So, uh, from the last game, you just carried UV lights around with you.

5005
03:25:53,770 --> 03:25:57,129
And then the zombies went, I think you can, you can make them.

5006
03:25:57,930 --> 03:25:58,809
Oh, can you?

5007
03:25:58,809 --> 03:26:00,409
That makes a lot of sense.

5008
03:26:00,409 --> 03:26:04,090
I feel like everyone should just be covered in UV lights.

5009
03:26:04,090 --> 03:26:07,049
Like a RGB keyboard kind of situation.

5010
03:26:07,770 --> 03:26:09,850
This whole thing wouldn't really be a problem anymore.

5011
03:26:10,889 --> 03:26:12,090
Why are we getting intense music?

5012
03:26:13,799 --> 03:26:15,799
I'm not.

5013
03:26:15,799 --> 03:26:16,920
Oh my, I'm about to die.

5014
03:26:18,229 --> 03:26:22,090
Why?

5015
03:26:22,090 --> 03:26:24,010
There's a UV flashlight in a later mission.

5016
03:26:24,010 --> 03:26:24,409
That's cool.

5017
03:26:27,319 --> 03:26:28,120
That's all it was.

5018
03:26:28,120 --> 03:26:28,520
Let's go.

5019
03:26:32,569 --> 03:26:35,450
We actually could both die very soon here.

5020
03:26:36,090 --> 03:26:44,170
You guys are in the baby zone still because you're not doing any story missions.

5021
03:26:46,059 --> 03:26:47,260
You're stuck in the baby zone.

5022
03:26:49,459 --> 03:26:50,260
What?

5023
03:26:50,260 --> 03:26:52,069
You ran that fast?

5024
03:26:58,899 --> 03:27:00,260
We've been helping though.

5025
03:27:00,260 --> 03:27:01,299
He's been doing it.

5026
03:27:01,299 --> 03:27:01,940
He's been doing it.

5027
03:27:02,899 --> 03:27:04,100
I'm going to go to the craft master.

5028
03:27:04,739 --> 03:27:05,700
I need you all players.

5029
03:27:08,010 --> 03:27:09,850
I can't talk to this guy unless you got my back.

5030
03:27:10,649 --> 03:27:11,450
I'm anxious.

5031
03:27:13,799 --> 03:27:16,120
It's a skyscraper city that you haven't even gotten to.

5032
03:27:16,120 --> 03:27:17,159
You're not even going to get to it.

5033
03:27:28,899 --> 03:27:29,940
Shove up.

5034
03:27:29,940 --> 03:27:31,299
Shove them up your ass.

5035
03:27:31,299 --> 03:27:34,229
Okay.

5036
03:27:34,229 --> 03:27:38,889
That was a side quest.

5037
03:27:39,850 --> 03:27:42,329
We got to do some main story missions.

5038
03:27:43,290 --> 03:27:45,370
I mean, I learned a parkour point.

5039
03:27:46,649 --> 03:27:47,850
Okay.

5040
03:27:47,850 --> 03:27:51,530
So this only get some work at the bazaar and earn Sophie's trust.

5041
03:27:51,530 --> 03:27:52,409
Isn't that what we just did?

5042
03:27:53,450 --> 03:27:56,629
Yeah.

5043
03:27:56,629 --> 03:27:58,389
I guess we just do a job.

5044
03:27:58,389 --> 03:27:58,629
Yeah.

5045
03:27:58,629 --> 03:27:59,989
She doesn't trust us.

5046
03:27:59,989 --> 03:28:13,819
Perfect dodge will stagger an enemy.

5047
03:28:13,819 --> 03:28:14,700
That's cool.

5048
03:28:14,700 --> 03:28:22,889
Okay.

5049
03:28:22,889 --> 03:28:25,799
I'm going to go to the crafting zone.

5050
03:28:26,440 --> 03:28:33,079
I just, I don't even, I just purchased things.

5051
03:28:33,079 --> 03:28:34,200
I'm never going to use them.

5052
03:28:35,559 --> 03:28:36,920
Someone's going to tell me to use them.

5053
03:28:36,920 --> 03:28:37,879
I'm never going to do it.

5054
03:28:38,600 --> 03:28:39,930
I want to craft.

5055
03:28:44,709 --> 03:28:48,149
Oh, it's middle mouse button to upgrade your blueprints.

5056
03:28:49,479 --> 03:28:49,959
By the way.

5057
03:28:55,770 --> 03:28:56,729
I crafted.

5058
03:28:56,729 --> 03:28:58,149
I did it.

5059
03:28:58,149 --> 03:28:59,030
I crafted.

5060
03:28:59,030 --> 03:29:03,719
I did it.

5061
03:29:03,719 --> 03:29:04,600
I figured it out.

5062
03:29:04,600 --> 03:29:05,239
Cool.

5063
03:29:05,239 --> 03:29:05,879
All right.

5064
03:29:05,879 --> 03:29:07,239
So I just got that better.

5065
03:29:08,120 --> 03:29:08,360
Yeah.

5066
03:29:09,100 --> 03:29:09,500
Yeah.

5067
03:29:09,500 --> 03:29:10,379
You did get that better.

5068
03:29:11,739 --> 03:29:21,879
Like a million degrees in here.

5069
03:29:21,879 --> 03:29:25,319
Oh, who's selling the, uh, healing items?

5070
03:29:25,319 --> 03:29:29,500
Anyone got any healing items in here?

5071
03:29:29,500 --> 03:29:30,459
Um, somebody probably does.

5072
03:29:31,020 --> 03:29:32,059
Come back here.

5073
03:29:32,059 --> 03:29:35,659
Oxygen.

5074
03:29:35,659 --> 03:29:36,940
The general shop, I think has them.

5075
03:29:39,270 --> 03:29:41,270
This is fucking losers selling cans.

5076
03:29:42,069 --> 03:29:46,120
Oh, these are nice.

5077
03:29:49,100 --> 03:29:49,739
Get a job.

5078
03:29:52,680 --> 03:29:53,159
Glasses.

5079
03:29:58,379 --> 03:29:58,540
Yeah.

5080
03:29:58,540 --> 03:29:59,500
Just buy all the heals.

5081
03:30:00,309 --> 03:30:00,709
I did.

5082
03:30:01,350 --> 03:30:03,670
I purchased a full stack of healing items.

5083
03:30:08,709 --> 03:30:11,110
Tell all the bullshit that you, all the weapons you're not using either.

5084
03:30:13,719 --> 03:30:19,110
I got to say I'm feeling ready to take on the world.

5085
03:30:19,110 --> 03:30:20,170
This thing's pretty good.

5086
03:30:20,809 --> 03:30:21,530
Antique hammer.

5087
03:30:22,250 --> 03:30:25,049
I'm going to actually do a PP while you do your shopping.

5088
03:30:25,049 --> 03:30:26,250
Oh, we're going to do, we're going to do break.

5089
03:30:27,290 --> 03:30:30,090
If you want to do PP or if you want to like

5090
03:30:30,090 --> 03:30:31,530
pour tea into the toilet or whatever.

5091
03:30:32,090 --> 03:30:33,530
Let's, uh, let's go pee.

5092
03:30:33,530 --> 03:30:35,829
We'll be right back together.

5093
03:30:35,829 --> 03:30:35,989
Yeah.

5094
03:30:35,989 --> 03:30:37,350
Let's make sure we flush at the same time.

5095
03:30:37,350 --> 03:30:37,829
Sink it.

5096
03:30:37,829 --> 03:30:38,229
Okay.

5097
03:30:38,229 --> 03:30:39,610
We'll be right back.

5098
03:30:39,610 --> 03:30:40,540
See you in a minute.

5099
03:30:40,540 --> 03:34:29,620
Oh, I am back.

5100
03:34:31,159 --> 03:34:32,600
I don't think stir is though.

5101
03:34:32,600 --> 03:34:33,159
We'll find out.

5102
03:34:34,120 --> 03:34:37,739
Are you back?

5103
03:34:38,860 --> 03:34:39,340
Oh yeah.

5104
03:34:39,340 --> 03:34:39,819
I'm back.

5105
03:34:39,819 --> 03:34:40,780
All right.

5106
03:34:40,780 --> 03:34:42,059
My war hammer.

5107
03:34:42,059 --> 03:34:47,100
I electricity going through it the whole way.

5108
03:34:47,100 --> 03:34:50,040
Electricity you say, huh?

5109
03:34:50,600 --> 03:34:50,680
Yeah.

5110
03:34:50,680 --> 03:34:51,559
Electricity.

5111
03:34:52,040 --> 03:34:53,000
Pretty cool.

5112
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:55,959
It's a little bit more practical than just finding a handgun.

5113
03:34:55,959 --> 03:34:59,000
So I wired up my metal hammer with electricity.

5114
03:35:00,760 --> 03:35:01,639
And how did you do that?

5115
03:35:03,739 --> 03:35:08,780
When you press I and you go in your inventory and you click on your weapon.

5116
03:35:09,340 --> 03:35:09,579
Yeah.

5117
03:35:10,379 --> 03:35:15,180
Oh, modify weapon to modify.

5118
03:35:15,180 --> 03:35:15,340
Yeah.

5119
03:35:15,340 --> 03:35:17,979
And if you have the blueprints on the equipment, then you can.

5120
03:35:17,979 --> 03:35:18,780
I don't.

5121
03:35:18,780 --> 03:35:19,819
I think I sold everything.

5122
03:35:20,700 --> 03:35:23,979
Someone in here sells blueprints for weapons.

5123
03:35:23,979 --> 03:35:25,260
Or it was that other place we were at.

5124
03:35:25,260 --> 03:35:27,100
They were selling a lot of weapon blueprints.

5125
03:35:27,100 --> 03:35:29,979
Well, yeah, this guy has like weapon mods for the shaft.

5126
03:35:29,979 --> 03:35:31,579
You want like a different shaft weapon.

5127
03:35:34,010 --> 03:35:36,889
Oh, he's got some flame tips.

5128
03:35:36,889 --> 03:35:37,290
Oxy.

5129
03:35:38,409 --> 03:35:38,809
Fire.

5130
03:35:40,569 --> 03:35:43,209
I think I want the toxic and the fire.

5131
03:35:43,209 --> 03:35:43,850
I want them both.

5132
03:35:44,969 --> 03:35:45,209
Yeah.

5133
03:35:45,930 --> 03:35:49,180
Yeah, definitely.

5134
03:35:49,180 --> 03:35:49,500
Nice.

5135
03:35:50,540 --> 03:35:51,100
Okay.

5136
03:35:51,100 --> 03:35:52,780
Now we go to the weapon.

5137
03:35:52,780 --> 03:35:53,899
Wait, that's not the weapon I want.

5138
03:35:54,860 --> 03:35:56,729
I want to put it on this.

5139
03:35:58,489 --> 03:36:03,159
Let's go ahead and put my blueprints.

5140
03:36:03,799 --> 03:36:05,559
I just bought them.

5141
03:36:05,559 --> 03:36:05,959
Where are they?

5142
03:36:06,520 --> 03:36:10,940
Didn't I buy them?

5143
03:36:10,940 --> 03:36:13,770
Those tips might have been for arrows.

5144
03:36:14,329 --> 03:36:17,530
And I just buy blueprints.

5145
03:36:17,530 --> 03:36:18,010
Where do they go?

5146
03:36:20,059 --> 03:36:22,540
When you go to modify your weapon, that's where they show up.

5147
03:36:23,559 --> 03:36:24,840
That was a shaft mod.

5148
03:36:25,719 --> 03:36:25,959
Yeah.

5149
03:36:27,540 --> 03:36:29,059
I was toxic to one.

5150
03:36:29,059 --> 03:36:29,379
Okay.

5151
03:36:30,180 --> 03:36:33,190
Do you know a tip mod?

5152
03:36:33,190 --> 03:36:33,590
How do I?

5153
03:36:35,030 --> 03:36:38,629
You press C on the weapon and then I bought one as a tip.

5154
03:36:38,629 --> 03:36:40,469
And then there's a shaft and there's a charm.

5155
03:36:40,469 --> 03:36:41,590
If you want to put a charm on it.

5156
03:36:41,590 --> 03:36:45,590
Oh, I get you.

5157
03:36:46,389 --> 03:36:49,350
So I can put like a flaming tip at the top of my shaft.

5158
03:36:49,350 --> 03:36:49,670
Okay.

5159
03:36:50,389 --> 03:36:51,270
My venom shaft.

5160
03:36:52,309 --> 03:36:55,110
I have a fire on the shaft.

5161
03:36:55,110 --> 03:36:56,090
Okay.

5162
03:36:56,090 --> 03:36:56,329
Yeah.

5163
03:36:56,329 --> 03:36:59,129
I've got a flaming weapon and a shaft.

5164
03:36:59,129 --> 03:37:00,649
Oh, this is cool.

5165
03:37:00,649 --> 03:37:00,969
Yeah.

5166
03:37:00,969 --> 03:37:01,209
Okay.

5167
03:37:01,850 --> 03:37:02,250
You ready?

5168
03:37:02,889 --> 03:37:03,129
Yeah.

5169
03:37:16,309 --> 03:37:16,870
I'm healing.

5170
03:37:19,670 --> 03:37:19,909
Okay.

5171
03:37:21,799 --> 03:37:23,719
So what story mission are we on now?

5172
03:37:24,680 --> 03:37:25,959
Get some work at the bazaar.

5173
03:37:27,399 --> 03:37:28,680
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

5174
03:37:28,680 --> 03:37:31,239
Let me see if I have other quests.

5175
03:37:31,879 --> 03:37:35,159
See, I thought that was part of the main one.

5176
03:37:35,159 --> 03:37:36,040
Get some work.

5177
03:37:37,000 --> 03:37:39,379
I thought we just did work though.

5178
03:37:39,379 --> 03:37:40,819
Do we have to keep you inside missions?

5179
03:37:41,620 --> 03:37:43,219
We might have to do another.

5180
03:37:44,309 --> 03:37:45,030
Get some work.

5181
03:37:45,590 --> 03:37:48,870
Is there anybody else that has a job in here?

5182
03:37:51,290 --> 03:37:51,610
Yeah.

5183
03:37:51,610 --> 03:37:52,329
Story quest.

5184
03:37:53,209 --> 03:37:54,569
The only way out.

5185
03:37:54,569 --> 03:37:56,090
That's what we're doing, right?

5186
03:37:56,090 --> 03:37:57,209
I think so.

5187
03:37:57,209 --> 03:37:58,409
I mean, there's a person over here.

5188
03:38:01,500 --> 03:38:03,659
All players required to talk to this lady.

5189
03:38:03,659 --> 03:38:03,899
Yep.

5190
03:38:03,899 --> 03:38:05,420
We got to keep doing these.

5191
03:38:05,979 --> 03:38:13,659
Coming gas can, I'm sorry.

5192
03:38:14,219 --> 03:38:15,180
I just might be nothing.

5193
03:38:15,180 --> 03:38:15,500
I don't know.

5194
03:38:27,079 --> 03:38:27,559
Did we do it?

5195
03:38:28,280 --> 03:38:29,079
Yeah, I think we did it.

5196
03:38:31,500 --> 03:38:31,739
What?

5197
03:38:31,739 --> 03:38:32,299
We didn't do it.

5198
03:38:35,559 --> 03:38:35,959
What is it?

5199
03:38:37,079 --> 03:38:40,059
Hey, does anyone need any work?

5200
03:38:40,940 --> 03:38:41,979
Does anybody have anything to do?

5201
03:38:43,100 --> 03:38:44,219
Anyone have any work for us?

5202
03:38:46,309 --> 03:38:47,590
Anyone here you need?

5203
03:38:47,590 --> 03:38:48,389
Hey, all players.

5204
03:38:48,389 --> 03:38:49,829
Hey, this guy needs some work.

03:38:50,870 --> 03:38:54,739
Please wait.

5206
03:38:55,700 --> 03:38:56,260
I'm waiting.

5207
03:39:00,069 --> 03:39:00,790
Yeah, I'm waiting.

5208
03:39:01,590 --> 03:39:02,069
Yep.

5209
03:39:02,069 --> 03:39:02,309
Okay.

5210
03:39:02,309 --> 03:39:02,950
We need some more.

5211
03:39:02,950 --> 03:39:03,989
Anyone here got some work?

5212
03:39:04,790 --> 03:39:05,350
He's wait.

5213
03:39:05,909 --> 03:39:07,350
All players required for this person.

5214
03:39:08,389 --> 03:39:11,909
Can I help you?

5215
03:39:12,469 --> 03:39:14,229
Can you help me to give me help to you?

5216
03:39:14,229 --> 03:39:15,829
Oh, perfect.

5217
03:39:16,629 --> 03:39:17,590
Thank you for the gift.

5218
03:39:17,590 --> 03:39:18,149
What do we get?

5219
03:39:19,110 --> 03:39:20,149
Who's Benny?

5220
03:39:20,149 --> 03:39:21,510
Who really is judging?

5221
03:39:21,510 --> 03:39:22,229
I'm confused.

5222
03:39:22,950 --> 03:39:23,829
This doesn't make any sense.

5223
03:39:23,829 --> 03:39:24,389
What are they saying?

5224
03:39:25,030 --> 03:39:27,670
Hey, get some work done.

5225
03:39:28,870 --> 03:39:29,750
Hey, this guy.

5226
03:39:31,209 --> 03:39:32,010
Please wait.

5227
03:39:32,010 --> 03:39:32,969
It still says please wait.

5228
03:39:35,579 --> 03:39:38,059
Look on your side quest for ones that say bizarre.

5229
03:39:38,940 --> 03:39:40,620
Yeah, we might already have.

5230
03:39:40,620 --> 03:39:42,059
Yeah, I probably already accept.

5231
03:39:42,059 --> 03:39:42,780
Did you already take one?

5232
03:39:43,579 --> 03:39:46,139
I took a bunch before stream started.

5233
03:39:48,100 --> 03:39:48,739
Side quest.

5234
03:39:48,739 --> 03:39:49,459
Cheers.

5235
03:39:49,459 --> 03:39:51,459
Yeah, they're saying these are side quests.

5236
03:39:51,459 --> 03:39:53,139
Return to Carlos.

5237
03:39:53,139 --> 03:39:54,899
Current objective report to the board.

5238
03:39:56,340 --> 03:39:57,219
Oh, I have to track.

5239
03:39:57,219 --> 03:39:59,459
I think that just kind of all they're all here.

5240
03:39:59,459 --> 03:40:00,260
They're all in front of us.

5241
03:40:03,100 --> 03:40:04,620
Skips all dialogue.

5242
03:40:04,620 --> 03:40:05,899
I'm confused, bro.

5243
03:40:07,420 --> 03:40:08,219
Yeah, that's the joke.

5244
03:40:08,219 --> 03:40:08,860
You got it.

5245
03:40:08,860 --> 03:40:09,500
I know.

5246
03:40:10,940 --> 03:40:12,299
Yeah, he got the joke.

5247
03:40:12,299 --> 03:40:13,260
We can't talk to this guy.

5248
03:40:14,299 --> 03:40:15,260
He's too popular.

5249
03:40:16,219 --> 03:40:18,620
We need to turn the quest into him and we can't.

5250
03:40:19,940 --> 03:40:20,739
I'm confused.

5251
03:40:20,739 --> 03:40:21,299
Is that okay?

5252
03:40:21,860 --> 03:40:23,159
Are we sure he's not above us?

5253
03:40:23,879 --> 03:40:24,840
No, it's over his head.

5254
03:40:25,479 --> 03:40:29,049
Okay.

5255
03:40:29,049 --> 03:40:29,850
Well, is there another one?

5256
03:40:30,329 --> 03:40:33,159
I mean, we did that quest.

5257
03:40:33,159 --> 03:40:34,760
I feel like I deserve credit for it.

5258
03:40:35,479 --> 03:40:39,159
Who else has a turn in?

5259
03:40:39,799 --> 03:40:40,600
Oh, Bebin.

5260
03:40:41,159 --> 03:40:43,190
Okay, let me look at what else we can do.

5261
03:40:43,190 --> 03:40:43,829
A different one.

5262
03:40:47,500 --> 03:40:48,700
Bring Lavender.

5263
03:40:48,700 --> 03:40:49,659
Oh, we can apparently.

5264
03:40:52,139 --> 03:40:53,659
Everything else is further away.

5265
03:40:55,610 --> 03:40:56,090
That guy.

5266
03:40:57,049 --> 03:41:01,559
I don't think we can talk to this guy.

5267
03:41:02,360 --> 03:41:04,120
Okay, let's go do this.

5268
03:41:04,120 --> 03:41:06,760
Then we can come back later when he decides to work.

5269
03:41:06,760 --> 03:41:08,440
Wait, are you still pointing me to what?

5270
03:41:11,110 --> 03:41:11,909
It's doing this.

5271
03:41:12,790 --> 03:41:13,989
I know there's someone out back.

5272
03:41:14,549 --> 03:41:18,229
Go to the main menu and then go back in.

5273
03:41:18,950 --> 03:41:19,989
No, don't do it.

5274
03:41:19,989 --> 03:41:20,229
Okay.

5275
03:41:20,229 --> 03:41:21,270
It's honestly a scam.

5276
03:41:22,229 --> 03:41:23,399
Oh, this is right here.

5277
03:41:26,329 --> 03:41:29,979
No, let's run 100 meters.

5278
03:41:30,620 --> 03:41:32,840
We're runners.

5279
03:41:32,840 --> 03:41:33,479
That's our job.

5280
03:41:34,120 --> 03:41:43,000
It's nighttime.

5281
03:41:43,000 --> 03:41:43,559
It's scary.

5282
03:41:44,280 --> 03:41:45,719
I'm honestly not afraid of the dark.

5283
03:41:47,719 --> 03:41:48,840
That's Aiden.

5284
03:41:48,840 --> 03:41:51,319
I've just been offered an extremely shady deal,

5285
03:41:51,319 --> 03:41:53,719
but maybe it'll turn up a lead on Lucas.

5286
03:41:55,079 --> 03:41:56,760
There's two random quests here.

5287
03:41:56,760 --> 03:41:58,280
Whatever it is, check it out.

5288
03:41:58,280 --> 03:41:59,319
Main quest.

5289
03:41:59,319 --> 03:42:00,440
That's right.

5290
03:42:00,440 --> 03:42:01,239
Yep.

5291
03:42:01,239 --> 03:42:01,639
Thank you.

5292
03:42:01,639 --> 03:42:02,760
Thanks for correcting me there.

5293
03:42:06,809 --> 03:42:07,610
All players.

5294
03:42:07,610 --> 03:42:08,090
Let's go.

5295
03:42:12,969 --> 03:42:13,610
Wait, I'm confused.

5296
03:42:16,569 --> 03:42:17,450
What did I agree to?

5297
03:42:18,090 --> 03:42:19,610
I don't know what just happened.

5298
03:42:20,329 --> 03:42:23,159
Didn't you hear what I said?

5299
03:42:23,159 --> 03:42:24,280
Get downstairs.

5300
03:42:26,489 --> 03:42:27,690
Oh, didn't you hear what I said?

5301
03:42:27,690 --> 03:42:28,329
Get downstairs.

5302
03:42:29,049 --> 03:42:34,469
See, they know.

5303
03:42:34,469 --> 03:42:35,670
I don't dig through the trash.

5304
03:42:35,670 --> 03:42:36,389
Does that hurt me?

5305
03:42:38,149 --> 03:42:39,270
This isn't a main quest,

5306
03:42:39,270 --> 03:42:41,510
but we can't do the main quest until we do all the side quests here.

5307
03:42:42,629 --> 03:42:46,010
I'm here for the job.

5308
03:42:46,010 --> 03:42:49,659
So you're new around here.

5309
03:42:49,659 --> 03:42:50,139
Damien.

5310
03:42:52,219 --> 03:42:53,260
Fly and say I'm a local.

5311
03:42:54,059 --> 03:42:55,100
Yeah, I'm a local.

5312
03:42:55,100 --> 03:42:57,059
Born and bred, if you must know.

5313
03:42:57,700 --> 03:43:00,500
Then why haven't I ever seen you before?

5314
03:43:00,500 --> 03:43:01,540
Couldn't say.

5315
03:43:01,540 --> 03:43:03,459
We're tightly packed, but it's still a big city.

5316
03:43:04,020 --> 03:43:04,899
I heard there's a new game.

5317
03:43:04,899 --> 03:43:06,500
This game makes no fucking sense.

5318
03:43:06,500 --> 03:43:07,059
It does.

5319
03:43:07,059 --> 03:43:09,219
We're just skipping every dialogue piece.

5320
03:43:11,180 --> 03:43:12,379
Double down.

5321
03:43:12,379 --> 03:43:15,530
Pilgrims are nomads.

5322
03:43:15,530 --> 03:43:16,889
The story is probably interesting.

5323
03:43:16,889 --> 03:43:17,129
I don't know.

5324
03:43:17,129 --> 03:43:17,530
It could be.

5325
03:43:17,530 --> 03:43:18,250
I have one.

5326
03:43:18,250 --> 03:43:21,139
That's another thing.

5327
03:43:21,139 --> 03:43:24,090
Almost got lynched at the bazaar.

5328
03:43:24,729 --> 03:43:26,059
Didn't have a marker.

5329
03:43:26,059 --> 03:43:26,940
When is this guy gay?

5330
03:43:26,940 --> 03:43:28,940
Some say he was recently infected.

5331
03:43:29,739 --> 03:43:31,450
Ring a bell.

5332
03:43:31,450 --> 03:43:32,329
What are they talking about us?

5333
03:43:33,129 --> 03:43:33,850
I double down.

5334
03:43:34,489 --> 03:43:35,690
I saw that guy.

5335
03:43:35,690 --> 03:43:37,530
He was taken outside by a hack on.

5336
03:43:38,170 --> 03:43:38,729
And killed.

5337
03:43:39,690 --> 03:43:40,489
Maybe he was.

5338
03:43:41,770 --> 03:43:43,610
Or maybe he will be.

5339
03:43:43,610 --> 03:43:46,010
Because he's sitting here lying to my face.

5340
03:43:46,010 --> 03:43:48,809
You know what they need to put into games for idiots like us?

5341
03:43:49,450 --> 03:43:50,899
What?

5342
03:43:50,899 --> 03:43:52,979
Like an audio tape you can play.

5343
03:43:52,979 --> 03:43:55,299
That's five minutes long that plays while you're playing.

5344
03:43:55,299 --> 03:43:56,420
That tells you the whole story.

5345
03:43:58,170 --> 03:43:59,049
We wouldn't look into it.

5346
03:43:59,690 --> 03:44:00,329
You don't think so?

5347
03:44:01,850 --> 03:44:02,170
No.

5348
03:44:02,889 --> 03:44:03,209
Okay.

5349
03:44:04,920 --> 03:44:06,040
And a lot of games do that.

5350
03:44:06,040 --> 03:44:09,559
Like when you're the master chief and you have the little blue girl telling you.

5351
03:44:11,479 --> 03:44:15,000
You think we would skip that if it was like oh hey for the people.

5352
03:44:15,639 --> 03:44:16,360
We're fighting these guys.

5353
03:44:16,360 --> 03:44:17,239
Yeah we're fighting them.

5354
03:44:17,239 --> 03:44:18,520
Did it matter?

5355
03:44:21,239 --> 03:44:22,840
Oh my god I threw a spear in that guy's head.

5356
03:44:22,840 --> 03:44:27,020
Wait why?

5357
03:44:27,020 --> 03:44:27,979
The guy lit on fire?

5358
03:44:28,860 --> 03:44:30,149
Yeah you got a fire weapon.

5359
03:44:30,149 --> 03:44:30,790
Oh that's right.

5360
03:44:30,790 --> 03:44:31,590
This is awesome.

5361
03:44:32,549 --> 03:44:34,280
Oh they got more goons.

5362
03:44:35,000 --> 03:44:36,040
Like that was the main guy.

5363
03:44:36,040 --> 03:44:36,680
He's already dead.

5364
03:44:41,500 --> 03:44:43,340
Wow I feel like our weapons are dealing damage.

5365
03:44:47,510 --> 03:44:49,829
Let me get that guy.

5366
03:44:49,829 --> 03:44:50,709
A roadie vest.

5367
03:44:50,709 --> 03:44:51,350
Okay let's go.

5368
03:44:51,909 --> 03:44:54,579
I'm a bit of a roadie.

5369
03:44:58,100 --> 03:45:01,770
This thing is awesome.

5370
03:45:02,409 --> 03:45:07,690
This is Fallout for people that don't want to play Fallout.

5371
03:45:11,780 --> 03:45:13,459
I mean it's not a mid-dime.

5372
03:45:13,459 --> 03:45:15,299
It's our business strategy.

5373
03:45:15,299 --> 03:45:17,620
We heard there's a lot of people out there that don't want to play Fallout.

5374
03:45:17,620 --> 03:45:19,219
So we're gonna make Fallout.

5375
03:45:23,000 --> 03:45:24,040
Okay board meeting approved.

5376
03:45:24,040 --> 03:45:24,680
Here's your budget.

5377
03:45:34,940 --> 03:45:35,500
I can't.

5378
03:45:37,590 --> 03:45:38,549
Oh I wonder who this person is.

5379
03:45:43,239 --> 03:45:44,360
I should tell Carl this.

5380
03:45:47,670 --> 03:45:51,829
You don't think it's like the little Microsoft paperclip guy was in the corner like.

5381
03:45:51,829 --> 03:45:55,909
So this is this is Damian and he's one of those players that you come across.

5382
03:45:55,909 --> 03:45:57,510
He's Michael's son.

5383
03:45:58,069 --> 03:45:59,190
Just for us to know.

5384
03:45:59,190 --> 03:46:00,680
Hey I got like choices.

5385
03:46:00,680 --> 03:46:02,379
Do I want to help him?

5386
03:46:02,379 --> 03:46:03,420
That sounds like a side quest.

5387
03:46:04,469 --> 03:46:06,149
Be careful he's a swindler.

5388
03:46:06,149 --> 03:46:08,149
Like and then and then the paperclip disappears.

5389
03:46:09,270 --> 03:46:15,690
Why do you keep doing that to me?

5390
03:46:15,690 --> 03:46:17,850
Because you were very hurt and I worry.

5391
03:46:17,850 --> 03:46:19,610
That wouldn't be immersive.

5392
03:46:19,610 --> 03:46:21,290
No but it's something you could turn off and on.

5393
03:46:22,010 --> 03:46:25,899
Oh so we're arguing against accessibility now.

5394
03:46:25,899 --> 03:46:27,500
No I said you can turn it off and on.

5395
03:46:27,500 --> 03:46:28,219
It's off and on.

5396
03:46:28,219 --> 03:46:31,340
I'm saying I'm saying the chatter like oh you don't want to go there.

5397
03:46:31,819 --> 03:46:34,549
Remember was the one guy that liked Clippy.

5398
03:46:36,540 --> 03:46:37,659
Oh look down there.

5399
03:46:39,379 --> 03:46:41,559
Oh is that Zeds?

5400
03:46:41,559 --> 03:46:45,559
You want to do something about this?

5401
03:46:45,559 --> 03:46:46,200
You want to defeat?

5402
03:46:46,200 --> 03:46:47,239
It does say defeat.

5403
03:46:47,239 --> 03:46:48,360
It does say defeat.

5404
03:46:48,360 --> 03:46:51,159
It does like that's a little Clippy telling us defeat.

5405
03:46:51,159 --> 03:46:53,420
We have any bombs or anything?

5406
03:46:53,420 --> 03:46:54,780
I don't have any bombs or anything.

5407
03:46:54,780 --> 03:46:56,059
All right well let's just go.

5408
03:46:56,059 --> 03:46:57,739
We got cool elemental weapons.

5409
03:46:58,299 --> 03:46:59,100
Hey you want to drop?

5410
03:46:59,100 --> 03:47:00,139
Oh there's a spear up here.

5411
03:47:00,940 --> 03:47:01,819
Nice good start.

5412
03:47:02,459 --> 03:47:06,649
We can double spear.

5413
03:47:09,270 --> 03:47:11,670
One two three.

5414
03:47:12,950 --> 03:47:13,899
We both miss.

5415
03:47:14,700 --> 03:47:15,819
No I threw it already.

5416
03:47:16,059 --> 03:47:16,540
I hit him.

5417
03:47:19,909 --> 03:47:27,909
Um okay careful.

5418
03:47:27,909 --> 03:47:30,219
He's on fire.

5419
03:47:37,829 --> 03:47:38,149
Nice.

5420
03:47:38,870 --> 03:47:47,639
You dare don't you dare.

5421
03:47:49,399 --> 03:47:49,799
He's dead.

5422
03:47:54,520 --> 03:47:55,000
Trophy.

5423
03:47:55,000 --> 03:47:55,959
Oh that was cool nice.

5424
03:47:59,829 --> 03:48:00,389
Perfume.

5425
03:48:04,229 --> 03:48:05,989
It's very weird how that just happened but I'll take it.

5426
03:48:10,860 --> 03:48:13,739
Yeah I finally unlocked power attack.

5427
03:48:14,540 --> 03:48:16,219
Seems kind of uh.

5428
03:48:16,219 --> 03:48:17,500
You got power attack?

5429
03:48:17,500 --> 03:48:18,860
I got power attack yeah.

5430
03:48:19,579 --> 03:48:24,889
Okay so let's keep moving.

5431
03:48:24,889 --> 03:48:30,020
Is someone ringing a bell?

5432
03:48:32,059 --> 03:48:33,500
The toll of the undead.

5433
03:48:35,940 --> 03:48:37,620
That is in every game isn't it?

5434
03:48:38,500 --> 03:48:40,819
Oh the toll of the dead.

5435
03:48:44,100 --> 03:48:46,969
You're saying bells are overdone.

5436
03:48:46,969 --> 03:48:48,250
I think they're in everything.

5437
03:48:48,250 --> 03:48:53,209
I think like the church bells symbolizes the undead has been.

5438
03:48:53,209 --> 03:48:56,680
Yeah what happened?

5439
03:48:56,680 --> 03:48:59,129
What happened?

5440
03:48:59,690 --> 03:49:00,579
I got kicked out.

5441
03:49:01,639 --> 03:49:05,319
Oh you said you left my session and then I dropped my weapon.

5442
03:49:05,319 --> 03:49:06,739
Did you get kicked out?

5443
03:49:07,299 --> 03:49:08,819
No I'm still in here.

5444
03:49:08,819 --> 03:49:12,329
What can you re-invite me?

5445
03:49:13,590 --> 03:49:15,700
Um help.

5446
03:49:15,700 --> 03:49:17,399
Try and re-invite.

5447
03:49:17,399 --> 03:49:21,559
Are you online?

5448
03:49:21,559 --> 03:49:22,440
I should be.

5449
03:49:24,389 --> 03:49:25,540
What's that all about?

5450
03:49:29,500 --> 03:49:31,020
Robo Yerma?

5451
03:49:31,020 --> 03:49:32,299
He sounds normal to me.

5452
03:49:32,299 --> 03:49:33,260
Wait did my stream die?

5453
03:49:34,139 --> 03:49:40,280
Whatever.

5454
03:49:40,280 --> 03:49:45,159
It was me oh shit.

5455
03:49:45,159 --> 03:49:46,680
I guess my internet effed for a second.

5456
03:49:49,239 --> 03:49:50,440
Do I sound weird?

5457
03:49:50,440 --> 03:49:51,000
A little bit yeah.

5458
03:49:52,219 --> 03:49:53,020
Well are you back?

5459
03:49:53,020 --> 03:49:53,579
Yeah you're back.

5460
03:49:53,579 --> 03:49:54,139
I think I'm back.

5461
03:49:54,139 --> 03:49:56,139
I think it was just a little a little chunky eff it's okay.

5462
03:49:57,100 --> 03:50:02,299
A little bit of uh yeah.

5463
03:50:02,299 --> 03:50:04,379
Uh can you pull me to where you are?

5464
03:50:04,379 --> 03:50:13,020
I can't act well I mean maybe if I go to this NPC I can.

5465
03:50:13,020 --> 03:50:16,860
Yeah that one counted because now Sophie wants to talk to us because we did the side quest.

5466
03:50:16,860 --> 03:50:17,500
Oh good.

5467
03:50:18,700 --> 03:50:20,459
We just had to do one side quest.

5468
03:50:22,219 --> 03:50:23,819
We've been running around for hours.

5469
03:50:25,659 --> 03:50:27,700
Hey she has a good one on her trust.

5470
03:50:28,860 --> 03:50:29,819
Okay fast travel.

5471
03:50:30,540 --> 03:50:33,299
Teleporting to leader in nine seconds.

5472
03:50:33,299 --> 03:50:34,180
Why can't I just do it now?

5473
03:50:34,739 --> 03:50:36,260
Yeah can you please call me leader?

5474
03:50:37,930 --> 03:50:39,129
Am I still dropping frames?

5475
03:50:39,129 --> 03:50:47,530
Do you want to see me?

5476
03:50:47,530 --> 03:50:49,049
I've been hearing about you.

5477
03:50:49,610 --> 03:50:51,209
Good or bad things?

5478
03:50:51,209 --> 03:50:53,290
How many people are streaming the super bowl?

5479
03:50:53,290 --> 03:50:55,940
The ones that make me believe it's worth giving you a chance.

5480
03:50:55,940 --> 03:50:58,100
Yeah don't you know what you're posing?

5481
03:50:58,100 --> 03:50:58,579
Go to one of the-

5482
03:50:58,579 --> 03:50:59,379
I do have fiber yeah.

5483
03:51:03,639 --> 03:51:05,639
Waiting for other players before proceeding okay.

5484
03:51:08,649 --> 03:51:09,290
Now I am.

5485
03:51:09,290 --> 03:51:10,569
It's probably just a little bump.

5486
03:51:10,569 --> 03:51:12,389
It happens sometimes.

5487
03:51:15,319 --> 03:51:16,680
I do have gigabit connection.

5488
03:51:16,680 --> 03:51:17,159
I have fiber.

5489
03:51:18,729 --> 03:51:19,530
It's very rare.

5490
03:51:19,530 --> 03:51:25,620
It's very rare that this happens.

5491
03:51:25,620 --> 03:51:27,059
Oh it'll pass it'll be good.

5492
03:52:13,479 --> 03:52:14,680
Well let's see if I come back.

5493
03:52:18,299 --> 03:52:21,350
Weird I'm back.

5494
03:52:21,350 --> 03:52:23,430
Yeah I just guys I just did a speed test.

5495
03:52:23,430 --> 03:52:25,350
I'm at a thousand a thousand.

5496
03:52:25,350 --> 03:52:26,709
I'm at full connection.

5497
03:52:27,350 --> 03:52:28,709
It looks like something weird's going on.

5498
03:52:29,350 --> 03:52:30,950
But um we'll try this again.

5499
03:52:31,770 --> 03:52:34,329
I mean maybe the super bowl is shutting down every-

5500
03:52:34,329 --> 03:52:37,139
Like maybe the super bowl is so crazy that like

5501
03:52:37,139 --> 03:52:39,219
nothing else is going to work for years.

5502
03:52:39,219 --> 03:52:40,489
Maybe it's the twitch server.

5503
03:52:40,489 --> 03:52:41,290
I don't think it's a twitch server

5504
03:52:41,290 --> 03:52:43,370
because I wouldn't be dropping from the game too.

5505
03:52:43,370 --> 03:52:50,940
Thanks for the invite.

5506
03:52:50,940 --> 03:52:52,059
Hey no problem.

5507
03:52:52,059 --> 03:52:57,799
Yeah I wouldn't be dropping out of the game.

5508
03:53:00,500 --> 03:53:02,420
Weirdly I'm not dropping out of the call.

5509
03:53:02,420 --> 03:53:05,819
That's kind of weird.

5510
03:53:06,459 --> 03:53:08,620
Well you're not even like-

5511
03:53:08,620 --> 03:53:10,139
Actually I think you did drop out of the call

5512
03:53:10,139 --> 03:53:11,819
for a little bit when you disconnected.

5513
03:53:14,809 --> 03:53:18,700
I couldn't hear you for a moment.

5514
03:53:18,700 --> 03:53:19,739
It's probably still happening.

5515
03:53:26,299 --> 03:53:27,510
Am I still here?

5516
03:53:28,500 --> 03:53:29,299
Yeah.

5517
03:53:29,299 --> 03:53:30,739
Okay well let's just try it.

5518
03:53:30,739 --> 03:53:31,780
Let's just let's just go.

5519
03:53:34,170 --> 03:53:38,569
Oh fiber omega low burr omega low whatever.

5520
03:53:39,129 --> 03:53:40,409
Yeah how much do you pay a month?

5521
03:53:40,409 --> 03:53:42,649
Like seven thousand dollars for this internet?

5522
03:53:42,649 --> 03:53:46,010
Actually actually way less than I was paying before

5523
03:53:46,010 --> 03:53:47,209
for like cable internet.

5524
03:53:48,569 --> 03:53:56,120
Yeah I bet.

5525
03:53:56,120 --> 03:53:57,319
Banana bro here.

5526
03:53:57,319 --> 03:53:58,680
Ditch that loser stream.

5527
03:53:58,680 --> 03:54:00,120
What does stir call you guys here?

5528
03:54:00,120 --> 03:54:01,079
The pineapple people?

5529
03:54:01,719 --> 03:54:04,280
No come back to my stream.

5530
03:54:04,280 --> 03:54:05,239
Come back to my stream.

5531
03:54:05,239 --> 03:54:06,440
Don't don't go straight away.

5532
03:54:06,440 --> 03:54:08,600
Hey welcome to the stir mada.

5533
03:54:08,600 --> 03:54:12,219
It's like an armada but like you know

5534
03:54:12,219 --> 03:54:15,500
let's hit 100,000 likes and show how strong we are.

5535
03:54:15,500 --> 03:54:17,979
The star mada is coming into the solar system.

5536
03:54:17,979 --> 03:54:19,030
That's actually pretty cool.

5537
03:54:19,030 --> 03:54:19,829
I would probably sub.

5538
03:54:22,889 --> 03:54:23,850
All right get over here.

5539
03:54:23,850 --> 03:54:25,530
Said no one ever.

5540
03:54:25,530 --> 03:54:30,569
Wait where are you?

5541
03:54:30,569 --> 03:54:32,649
I'm at the quest.

5542
03:54:32,649 --> 03:54:34,950
Oh I was facing out.

5543
03:54:34,950 --> 03:54:36,219
I was reading.

5544
03:54:36,219 --> 03:54:39,879
The stir mada.

5545
03:54:39,879 --> 03:54:44,700
What are the uh germa's group of inhumane psychopaths?

5546
03:54:44,700 --> 03:54:46,139
No the germamites.

5547
03:54:46,139 --> 03:54:49,719
You gotta get it right.

5548
03:54:49,719 --> 03:54:50,680
The germamites.

5549
03:54:59,219 --> 03:54:59,860
Have I told you?

5550
03:55:00,420 --> 03:55:02,620
Wait never mind.

5551
03:55:02,620 --> 03:55:04,389
How did Barney get hurt?

5552
03:55:04,389 --> 03:55:05,829
What happened at the Super Bowl halftime show?

5553
03:55:05,829 --> 03:55:09,379
Did he like break his leg like sprain his ankle?

5554
03:55:09,379 --> 03:55:17,909
Oh no not another Barney nip flip.

5555
03:55:17,909 --> 03:55:19,030
Wait wait after.

5556
03:55:19,030 --> 03:55:21,559
While exploring the city you'll come across characters

5557
03:55:21,559 --> 03:55:23,559
marked with the midnight carpet.

5558
03:55:23,559 --> 03:55:26,950
Okay.

5559
03:55:26,950 --> 03:55:31,260
And then you hold t to fast forward to night.

5560
03:55:31,260 --> 03:55:34,139
So I think it's that thing that gas station we're at.

5561
03:55:34,139 --> 03:55:35,500
Remember it's like come back at night time.

5562
03:55:35,500 --> 03:55:38,059
Yeah yeah okay it's giving us one of those missions now.

5563
03:55:38,059 --> 03:55:40,739
We can do a hold t I think.

5564
03:55:40,739 --> 03:55:42,059
We gotta go.

5565
03:55:42,059 --> 03:55:43,739
Oh is it now gonna be night?

5566
03:55:43,739 --> 03:55:52,329
Somebody said is the Super Bowl why Twitter is lagging?

5567
03:55:52,329 --> 03:55:54,709
I don't know.

5568
03:55:54,709 --> 03:55:57,829
Dude do you remember that like there was a horrible horrible day

5569
03:55:57,829 --> 03:55:59,750
not that long ago like I was panicked.

5570
03:56:00,389 --> 03:56:02,709
Um you probably like have your own story

5571
03:56:02,709 --> 03:56:05,510
like where you were on that day when Facebook was down.

5572
03:56:08,760 --> 03:56:10,120
No I don't.

5573
03:56:10,120 --> 03:56:20,020
Crap didn't Facebook just say that like

5574
03:56:20,020 --> 03:56:23,510
they're gonna pull all operations out of Europe

5575
03:56:23,510 --> 03:56:27,399
like if they don't like if they can't do advertising or something.

5576
03:56:27,399 --> 03:56:30,489
Can you imagine if Facebook just was like

5577
03:56:30,489 --> 03:56:33,420
yeah we're not in Europe anymore.

5578
03:56:33,420 --> 03:56:34,620
That was a bluff.

5579
03:56:34,620 --> 03:56:35,899
I don't know I'm just saying I've read that.

5580
03:56:38,469 --> 03:56:40,469
I mean someone would immediately take their place.

5581
03:56:46,309 --> 03:56:48,790
Yeah I don't I don't know about all that.

5582
03:56:53,940 --> 03:56:56,659
I feel like opinions are you like kind of cringe.

5583
03:56:56,659 --> 03:56:59,139
Somebody's talking like robbing somebody.

5584
03:57:00,340 --> 03:57:01,940
Yeah I'm interested in the main quest.

5585
03:57:03,180 --> 03:57:04,700
They bluff they got called out.

5586
03:57:06,139 --> 03:57:17,020
Uh oh am I lagging again?

5587
03:57:17,899 --> 03:57:18,540

Uh hello are you still here?

5592
03:57:26,540 --> 03:57:27,979
Ow I'm good.

5593
03:57:31,340 --> 03:57:32,940
Did you turn on the streamer DMCA mode?

5594
03:57:34,069 --> 03:57:35,530
I did actually.

5595
03:57:35,530 --> 03:57:36,010
Pretty cool.

5596
03:57:36,569 --> 03:57:37,850
Do you know DMCA isn't real?

5597
03:57:37,850 --> 03:57:38,889
I know you already went over this.

5598
03:57:38,889 --> 03:57:41,049
You already talked about a bunch of shit about this.

5599
03:57:41,049 --> 03:57:42,569
Okay I just want to make sure you're in the know

5600
03:57:42,569 --> 03:57:44,489
because if you're not then you look like a fool.

5601
03:57:44,489 --> 03:57:45,209
What happened?

5602
03:57:45,209 --> 03:57:46,090
What happened to this guy?

5603
03:57:48,340 --> 03:57:49,299
Can we actually find out?

5604
03:57:49,940 --> 03:57:51,299
Wait do you want to help him?

5605
03:57:51,299 --> 03:57:52,100
We're kind of tripping.

5606
03:57:53,190 --> 03:57:54,469
Yes let's help him.

5607
03:57:54,469 --> 03:57:55,350
I'll do what I can.

5608
03:57:55,989 --> 03:57:56,870
Let's don't skip this.

5609
03:57:56,870 --> 03:57:58,229
All right I'll do what I can.

5610
03:58:05,059 --> 03:58:06,020
Okay he's gone.

5611
03:58:06,100 --> 03:58:06,739
Was he a ghost?

5612
03:58:06,739 --> 03:58:07,459
Was he not real?

5613
03:58:08,760 --> 03:58:09,399
Hey where is he?

5614
03:58:14,840 --> 03:58:18,219
We have two things to do.

5615
03:58:18,219 --> 03:58:19,979
Should we go over there?

5616
03:58:20,700 --> 03:58:22,219
Climb the windmill and restore power.

5617
03:58:22,860 --> 03:58:25,670
Or search for Barney.

5618
03:58:26,229 --> 03:58:27,719
Let's turn the power on.

5619
03:58:27,719 --> 03:58:29,159
That was like the choice quest we had.

5620
03:58:31,559 --> 03:58:32,200
Uh okay.

5621
03:58:32,840 --> 03:58:33,559
It's a container.

5622
03:58:34,200 --> 03:58:35,319
Uh okay.

5623
03:58:36,739 --> 03:58:38,579
I know main story main story main story

5624
03:58:38,579 --> 03:58:40,180
but it's fun to walk around and get stuff.

5625
03:58:42,500 --> 03:58:43,319
Am I lagging?

5626
03:58:43,319 --> 03:58:44,280
Is that you making a joke?

5627
03:58:44,280 --> 03:58:46,280
Yeah I'm making fun of you.

5628
03:58:46,280 --> 03:58:47,879
You're kind of robotting again.

5629
03:58:47,879 --> 03:58:48,200
What?

5630
03:58:52,870 --> 03:58:53,829
Wait what?

5631
03:58:53,829 --> 03:58:56,360
It's in here somewhere.

5632
03:58:56,360 --> 03:59:02,549
Is it on the roof?

5633
03:59:05,190 --> 03:59:06,549
There's one there's a one and a two.

5634
03:59:06,549 --> 03:59:07,270
I'm at the one.

5635
03:59:07,909 --> 03:59:12,069
It wants me to climb up top.

5636
03:59:12,629 --> 03:59:19,270
And I didn't get I didn't get the one cycle.

5637
03:59:21,030 --> 03:59:22,469
And every moment that you're not talking

5638
03:59:22,469 --> 03:59:23,510
I feel like you disconnected.

5639
03:59:23,510 --> 03:59:24,549
I'm still I'm here I'm here.

5640
03:59:25,190 --> 03:59:27,270
Okay like I'm worried about you.

5641
03:59:27,270 --> 03:59:28,309
Uh I found the thing.

5642
03:59:29,430 --> 03:59:31,030
I found the uh the thing.

5643
03:59:31,829 --> 03:59:32,790
I'm doing a different thing.

5644
03:59:33,750 --> 03:59:35,540
And I'm already like part way through it.

5645
03:59:35,540 --> 03:59:37,620
I feel like my thing's in precedence.

5646
03:59:37,620 --> 03:59:40,420
I mean can I loot this and do you get the credit for it?

5647
03:59:41,299 --> 03:59:41,940
I don't know.

5648
03:59:41,940 --> 03:59:42,600
Find out.

5649
03:59:44,389 --> 03:59:46,549
Oh dude you're gonna want to come over here.

5650
03:59:46,549 --> 03:59:47,430
This is a neck guitar.

5651
03:59:48,540 --> 03:59:49,739
Okay I'm coming.

5652
03:59:49,739 --> 03:59:51,430
There actually is one of those.

5653
03:59:51,430 --> 03:59:52,149
There's an inhibitor.

5654
03:59:57,299 --> 03:59:58,739
Okay teleporting to you.

5655
04:00:07,190 --> 04:00:07,909
VR hands.

5656
04:00:09,670 --> 04:00:10,790
It does kind of look like that.

5657
04:00:11,750 --> 04:00:15,959
Oh we did it we built a whole settlement.

5658
04:00:16,760 --> 04:00:17,930
Everyone's moving in.

5659
04:00:18,569 --> 04:00:20,409
Don't do that right next to your thigh.

5660
04:00:20,489 --> 04:00:21,850
Oh my god that was dangerous.

5661
04:00:23,559 --> 04:00:24,600
They don't know any better.

5662
04:00:24,600 --> 04:00:28,729
Oh you did it.

5663
04:00:33,450 --> 04:00:35,450
Somebody said iPad ad commercial.

5664
04:00:37,319 --> 04:00:38,360
It does feel like that.

5665
04:00:39,000 --> 04:00:45,180
Activate the windmill creates a safe zone around it.

5666
04:00:45,180 --> 04:00:46,500
Wow.

5667
04:00:46,500 --> 04:00:51,860
Okay cool.

5668
04:00:51,860 --> 04:00:56,709
There's a glider and a grappling hook in this game.

5669
04:00:56,709 --> 04:00:58,389
And at this pace you're never gonna see it.

5670
04:01:01,100 --> 04:01:02,139
Look at how pretty that is.

5671
04:01:02,780 --> 04:01:04,309
So the bitrate can catch up.

5672
04:01:04,309 --> 04:01:05,989
Just I'm not gonna move but damn.

5673
04:01:13,110 --> 04:01:14,629
Yeah I'm gonna use my glider right now.

5674
04:01:17,129 --> 04:01:18,969
But we're doing it on our own pace.

5675
04:01:18,969 --> 04:01:20,329
We don't have to be super gamers about it.

5676
04:01:20,329 --> 04:01:21,930
We're just enjoying the time.

5677
04:01:25,590 --> 04:01:27,989
Yeah speedrun already finished this game by now.

5678
04:01:27,989 --> 04:01:30,600
Just give up.

5679
04:01:35,979 --> 04:01:36,940
Yeah I'm giving.

5680
04:01:36,940 --> 04:01:38,459
Oh my god there's so many Zams.

5681
04:01:39,100 --> 04:01:41,020
What happened to the guy that was like help me.

5682
04:01:41,020 --> 04:01:42,780
And we're all on drugs while we shook his hand.

5683
04:01:44,700 --> 04:01:45,500
He wasn't real.

5684
04:01:46,059 --> 04:01:46,620
Oh my god.

5685
04:01:48,219 --> 04:01:49,770
What do you mean you're run.

5686
04:01:50,329 --> 04:01:50,809
I'm running.

5687
04:01:51,899 --> 04:01:52,540
Oh you're in.

5688
04:01:52,540 --> 04:01:53,260
I thought you were okay.

5689
04:01:53,979 --> 04:01:58,819
I'm in the corner.

5690
04:01:58,819 --> 04:02:04,729
I'm about to go down.

5691
04:02:05,530 --> 04:02:14,469
I have no stamina.

5692
04:02:15,030 --> 04:02:20,500
I'll heal you.

5693
04:02:20,500 --> 04:02:20,979
I'll do it to you.

5694
04:02:21,860 --> 04:02:25,270
Got you.

5695
04:02:25,270 --> 04:02:28,040
I'm electrified.

5696
04:02:31,819 --> 04:02:34,469
Oh wait I have one of these.

5697
04:02:35,270 --> 04:02:36,219
Do it.

5698
04:02:37,020 --> 04:02:37,260
Whoa.

5699
04:02:38,649 --> 04:02:38,969
Whoa.

5700
04:02:46,440 --> 04:02:46,760
Nice.

5701
04:02:47,879 --> 04:02:48,840
We got a lot of looting to do.

5702
04:02:49,399 --> 04:02:50,120
Players required.

5703
04:02:59,940 --> 04:03:00,500
Lot of loot.

5704
04:03:01,540 --> 04:03:02,260
Investigation.

5705
04:03:03,420 --> 04:03:05,420
Yeah I feel like we've done that a hundred times.

5706
04:03:06,299 --> 04:03:06,700
I know.

5707
04:03:07,739 --> 04:03:09,909
I feel like there was a whole tutorial.

5708
04:03:09,909 --> 04:03:10,950
I think we did that already.

5709
04:03:11,590 --> 04:03:15,739
Oh shit.

5710
04:03:15,739 --> 04:03:17,020
Wait how do we do this investigation.

5711
04:03:17,020 --> 04:03:17,899
There's like footprints here.

5712
04:03:18,459 --> 04:03:19,979
We just have to follow the footprints.

5713
04:03:20,780 --> 04:03:21,340
What.

5714
04:03:21,340 --> 04:03:21,979
Where are they going.

5715
04:03:22,620 --> 04:03:23,340
We'll find out.

5716
04:03:26,229 --> 04:03:26,629
Sophie.

5717
04:03:27,430 --> 04:03:28,680
It's fresh.

5718
04:03:28,680 --> 04:03:29,319
What am I doing.

5719
04:03:30,440 --> 04:03:31,670
Did you just eat that.

5720
04:03:32,629 --> 04:03:33,590
There's a crystal in here.

5721
04:03:34,870 --> 04:03:35,510
Power crystal.

5722
04:03:36,309 --> 04:03:36,629
Really.

5723
04:03:37,270 --> 04:03:37,829
Yeah.

5724
04:03:39,030 --> 04:03:41,030
You said you found an inhibitor in here earlier.

5725
04:03:41,030 --> 04:03:41,989
No I was backed up.

5726
04:03:45,030 --> 04:03:47,510
If you said that you'd give me a million dollars if I could show you where that was

5727
04:03:47,510 --> 04:03:48,229
I wouldn't be able to do it.

5728
04:03:53,459 --> 04:03:54,579
I have no idea where that was.

5729
04:03:54,579 --> 04:03:57,059
It was like 40 meters right.

5730
04:04:00,180 --> 04:04:01,379
I'm just looting.

5731
04:04:01,379 --> 04:04:02,870
Okay the blood goes this way.

5732
04:04:03,510 --> 04:04:09,379
I think we're getting these crystals.

5733
04:04:09,940 --> 04:04:11,139
We're smashing open these crystals.

5734
04:04:11,139 --> 04:04:12,100
We're doing a little bit of mining.

5735
04:04:12,100 --> 04:04:13,940
They go up the stairs too by the way.

5736
04:04:14,979 --> 04:04:22,809
Oh yeah you can sell these can't you.

5737
04:04:24,149 --> 04:04:26,870
The guy I remember them in the tutorial he's like these go for a lot.

5738
04:04:26,870 --> 04:04:27,430
Just remember.

5739
04:04:28,149 --> 04:04:31,989
Yeah he was like these are the most expensive things you'll ever own in your life.

5740
04:04:31,989 --> 04:04:34,379
And then he he like took it.

5741
04:04:35,100 --> 04:04:36,170
He didn't share.

5742
04:04:44,149 --> 04:04:44,549
Power.

5743
04:04:45,110 --> 04:04:46,549
I got them.

5744
04:04:54,090 --> 04:04:54,969
Shrooms.

5745
04:04:54,969 --> 04:04:56,090
Not much stuff to pick up.

5746
04:04:57,139 --> 04:05:02,680
Yeah I uh there's a person door here where we need people.

5747
04:05:02,680 --> 04:05:04,200
Is there any more crystals up here that I didn't get.

5748
04:05:05,239 --> 04:05:07,350
No you lied to me.

5749
04:05:07,909 --> 04:05:10,940
Wait Barney's dead.

5750
04:05:12,139 --> 04:05:12,540
Who am I?

5751
04:05:12,540 --> 04:05:13,100
Who are you?

5752
04:05:13,100 --> 04:05:13,500
Sophie?

5753
04:05:13,500 --> 04:05:14,059
Who's that?

5754
04:05:14,059 --> 04:05:14,540
Who are you?

5755
04:05:14,540 --> 04:05:14,940
I'm me.

5756
04:05:14,940 --> 04:05:15,899
Where's crystals Barney?

5757
04:05:15,899 --> 04:05:16,379
Fuck off.

5758
04:05:16,379 --> 04:05:18,860
Wait okay Barney.

5759
04:05:18,860 --> 04:05:19,819
Barney fuck off.

5760
04:05:20,620 --> 04:05:22,059
Come out or I'll make you.

5761
04:05:22,059 --> 04:05:24,700
Come out or I'll drag you out myself.

5762
04:05:24,700 --> 04:05:27,739
Oh yeah I am he's Barney.

5763
04:05:29,739 --> 04:05:30,860
It really just did that.

5764
04:05:31,819 --> 04:05:33,959
Oh fuck fuck you Barney.

5765
04:05:33,959 --> 04:05:34,440
Fuck off.

5766
04:05:37,299 --> 04:05:46,709
Yeah why does this feel like tutorial number two?

5767
04:05:47,430 --> 04:05:49,350
Because it is we're wasting so much time.

5768
04:05:52,219 --> 04:05:54,540
We walked around for like an hour and a half.

5769
04:05:55,420 --> 04:05:57,180
Yeah but we got all that sick loot.

5770
04:05:57,180 --> 04:05:59,899
I know we look I'm not saying we had to go faster.

5771
04:05:59,899 --> 04:06:01,899
I'm just saying we haven't done much of the story missions.

5772
04:06:02,459 --> 04:06:04,309
These aren't level one enemies.

5773
04:06:04,950 --> 04:06:05,430
They are.

5774
04:06:08,469 --> 04:06:09,190
Is that Barney?

5775
04:06:09,190 --> 04:06:17,559
It is fun though.

5776
04:06:18,200 --> 04:06:25,079
Get out of here.

5777
04:06:30,040 --> 04:06:32,200
Are you going to stream Angry Birds Star Wars?

5778
04:06:32,200 --> 04:06:34,200
That's a that's a question for stir.

5779
04:06:37,459 --> 04:06:38,180
Why is that for me?

5780
04:06:38,819 --> 04:06:40,489
I don't know because I'm not.

5781
04:06:41,879 --> 04:06:48,950
Angry Birds Star Wars um you know I'll try anything once.

5782
04:06:58,090 --> 04:06:59,930
Everybody has the same black eye in this game.

5783
04:06:59,930 --> 04:07:00,569
Have you noticed that?

5784
04:07:01,610 --> 04:07:02,969
Yeah the same exact eye.

5785
04:07:02,969 --> 04:07:04,250
It's never the other one.

5786
04:07:04,250 --> 04:07:07,379
Are we going to look for him?

5787
04:07:07,459 --> 04:07:08,100
Sure.

5788
04:07:08,100 --> 04:07:17,989
Where can I find him?

5789
04:07:17,989 --> 04:07:19,430
Follow Birdie's trail.

5790
04:07:20,309 --> 04:07:23,030
Uh we got an inhibitor in range 40 meters.

5791
04:07:23,030 --> 04:07:23,590
Are we actually?

5792
04:07:24,229 --> 04:07:30,360
Yep we gotta go outside.

5793
04:07:31,000 --> 04:07:34,200
Wait what am I?

5794
04:07:34,200 --> 04:07:39,510
Birdie's I should lead me to him.

5795
04:07:39,510 --> 04:07:41,510
How do you know there's so much blood here?

5796
04:07:44,409 --> 04:07:45,690
There is a lot of blood.

5797
04:07:46,329 --> 04:07:47,610
That's my survivor sense.

5798
04:07:48,489 --> 04:07:49,690
Hey I gotta follow these footprints.

5799
04:07:50,409 --> 04:07:51,610
Everybody's covered in blood.

5800
04:07:59,420 --> 04:08:01,190
Oh come on.

5801
04:08:02,360 --> 04:08:02,680
What?

5802
04:08:03,559 --> 04:08:05,059
I lost connection again?

5803
04:08:08,100 --> 04:08:08,340
What?

5804
04:08:09,139 --> 04:08:10,950
What the hell?

5805
04:08:10,950 --> 04:08:11,590
What's happening?

5806
04:08:12,229 --> 04:08:14,920
I don't know.

5807
04:08:14,920 --> 04:08:15,639
Re-invite me.

5808
04:08:16,440 --> 04:08:19,219
I don't know does this make any sense?

5809
04:08:19,860 --> 04:08:23,370
They're trying to keep us apart.

5810
04:08:23,370 --> 04:08:28,819
Is my stream still live?

5811
04:08:28,819 --> 04:08:29,620
No that's fine.

5812
04:08:30,579 --> 04:08:31,139
I don't get it.

5813
04:08:33,079 --> 04:08:34,360
I think you're faking it.

5814
04:08:34,360 --> 04:08:37,690
Hey at this point I can't find a problem.

5815
04:08:37,690 --> 04:08:39,530
Oh like I have I guess I gotta go.

5816
04:08:44,549 --> 04:08:45,190
Um cast.

5817
04:08:46,149 --> 04:08:48,600
Oh this never happens.

5818
04:08:48,680 --> 04:08:49,959
This is a this is a new problem.

5819
04:08:50,520 --> 04:08:51,399
Invite you.

5820
04:08:51,399 --> 04:08:52,600
Did you?

5821
04:08:54,260 --> 04:08:55,299
Oh yeah I did.

5822
04:08:55,299 --> 04:08:58,260
Oh yeah I'm following Birdie's trail but I'm gonna wait for you.

5823
04:08:58,260 --> 04:08:59,239
I don't have an invite.

5824
04:09:00,620 --> 04:09:03,340
Okay I'm gonna I like everyone saw me do it.

5825
04:09:03,340 --> 04:09:07,899
Everyone over here on the Sturmata with the perfectly fine connection saw it happen.

5826
04:09:07,899 --> 04:09:14,340
Now this oh my god stop.

5827
04:09:16,440 --> 04:09:17,239
What the fuck?

5828
04:09:18,520 --> 04:09:19,000
What?

5829
04:09:19,000 --> 04:09:21,159
You just invited me to play like a hundred times.

5830
04:09:23,340 --> 04:09:23,659
Okay.

5831
04:09:24,379 --> 04:09:25,020
What's happening?

5832
04:09:25,829 --> 04:09:26,950
I wanted to make sure you got it.

5833
04:09:31,000 --> 04:09:31,799
Okay am I in your game?

5834
04:09:32,700 --> 04:09:32,940
Yeah.

5835
04:09:32,940 --> 04:09:33,340
Let's go.

5836
04:09:34,299 --> 04:09:35,260
Yeah I don't know what's going on.

5837
04:09:35,260 --> 04:09:35,819
That's weird.

5838
04:09:35,819 --> 04:09:38,059
You're like 200 meters away again but.

5839
04:09:38,059 --> 04:09:40,139
I can teleport to you in a second.

5840
04:09:40,139 --> 04:09:44,549
I don't know what this would be related to.

5841
04:09:49,719 --> 04:09:50,600
I don't know.

5842
04:09:50,600 --> 04:10:00,459
Can you pull me over there bud?

5843
04:10:00,459 --> 04:10:04,219
I can't until I'm like actually doing a quest thing that needs you.

5844
04:10:04,219 --> 04:10:10,659
I teleport to you from minimap and I teleport to you.

5845
04:10:12,500 --> 04:10:13,299
I can't.

5846
04:10:15,020 --> 04:10:16,700
If you just walk over here.

5847
04:10:16,700 --> 04:10:19,559
I mean it's 172 meters away that's far.

5848
04:10:19,559 --> 04:10:22,940
Plus I don't know how to get out of this house.

5849
04:10:23,500 --> 04:10:35,139
I mean I'm trying to find this inhibitor.

5850
04:10:35,139 --> 04:10:38,250
I actually don't know how to leave this house.

5851
04:10:38,250 --> 04:10:41,690
Okay I guess I'll go to the quest down here and then you'll teleport.

5852
04:10:41,690 --> 04:10:47,620
Every door it doesn't work if I get out of here.

5853
04:10:47,620 --> 04:10:51,420
Oh I'm following the footprints.

5854
04:10:51,420 --> 04:10:53,340
I actually forgot I need a tutorial.

5855
04:10:56,700 --> 04:10:57,020
Down?

5856
04:11:06,969 --> 04:11:08,889
I can't leave this area.

5857
04:11:08,889 --> 04:11:10,780
All the windows are boarded.

5858
04:11:18,790 --> 04:11:23,500
Open a door or something.

5859
04:11:23,500 --> 04:11:25,500
Every door is boarded up I can't leave.

5860
04:11:26,139 --> 04:11:27,620
Okay I'm teleporting you.

5861
04:11:27,620 --> 04:11:28,500
You gotta wait.

5862
04:11:28,500 --> 04:11:41,750
Oh there we go.

5863
04:11:44,340 --> 04:11:45,219
This is Bertie.

5864
04:11:45,219 --> 04:11:46,500
Bertie is on the ground.

5865
04:11:46,500 --> 04:11:46,899
He's hurt.

5866
04:11:46,899 --> 04:11:48,260
He needs help.

5867
04:11:49,860 --> 04:11:52,020
You're the younger brother with the disconnected controller.

5868
04:11:54,170 --> 04:11:54,489
Mom.

5869
04:11:55,049 --> 04:11:55,850
Mom I'm dying.

5870
04:11:56,889 --> 04:11:57,129
Mom.

5871
04:12:10,180 --> 04:12:10,579
Is he dead?

5872
04:12:16,280 --> 04:12:19,139
Is that funny?

5873
04:12:19,139 --> 04:12:20,020
Is that funny to you?

5874
04:12:20,020 --> 04:12:21,059
It was.

5875
04:12:25,239 --> 04:12:26,040
Okay psycho.

5876
04:12:26,920 --> 04:12:27,399
You there?

5877
04:12:27,959 --> 04:12:29,799
Yeah I'm just trying to reach your brother.

5878
04:12:29,799 --> 04:12:31,879
You just ruined that whole moment.

5879
04:12:31,879 --> 04:12:32,920
It was just ruined.

5880
04:12:34,120 --> 04:12:35,239
What do you mean ruined?

5881
04:12:35,239 --> 04:12:36,680
Oh look military med kit in here.

5882
04:12:38,360 --> 04:12:43,420
He was just talking on the phone and all of a sudden he's just like in your arms.

5883
04:12:43,420 --> 04:12:44,780
It's just like was so off.

5884
04:12:46,379 --> 04:12:47,180
Just abnormal.

5885
04:12:47,180 --> 04:12:47,819
It was just weird.

5886
04:12:47,819 --> 04:12:48,139
And if...

5887
04:12:52,219 --> 04:12:52,940
I apologize.

5888
04:12:55,219 --> 04:12:56,579
I won't ever make it weird again.

5889
04:12:57,219 --> 04:12:59,219
Okay we finally can continue.

5890
04:13:00,340 --> 04:13:06,940
We can do the story mission now.

5891
04:13:06,940 --> 04:13:07,979
We've unlocked Sophie.

5892
04:13:08,620 --> 04:13:14,729
Who's your favorite NPC so far?

5893
04:13:18,489 --> 04:13:19,770
I don't know any of their names.

5894
04:13:21,340 --> 04:13:22,379
You just said Sophie.

5895
04:13:23,340 --> 04:13:25,020
Yeah but I don't know if that's my favorite NPC.

5896
04:13:29,719 --> 04:13:30,120
Damn it.

5897
04:13:30,680 --> 04:13:33,879
Whatever we gotta go this way anyways.

5898
04:13:34,809 --> 04:13:35,610
No we're going right here.

5899
04:13:43,399 --> 04:13:44,360
Uh oh door shut.

5900
04:13:46,250 --> 04:13:46,729
Here we...

5901
04:13:46,729 --> 04:13:47,370
We have to do it now.

5902
04:13:47,370 --> 04:13:47,850
Danger.

5903
04:13:49,110 --> 04:13:50,469
Things are better for us now right?

5904
04:13:51,270 --> 04:13:52,149
Depends.

5905
04:13:52,149 --> 04:13:53,270
Oh are we...

5906
04:13:53,270 --> 04:13:53,670
Dentists?

5907
04:13:53,670 --> 04:13:54,549
That guy was a prick.

5908
04:13:55,270 --> 04:13:58,069
The PK were painted hands with him in charge.

5909
04:13:58,069 --> 04:13:59,510
Conclusion's pretty straightforward.

5910
04:14:00,229 --> 04:14:01,270
Lucas is gone.

5911
04:14:01,270 --> 04:14:02,870
She patching up his eye.

5912
04:14:04,090 --> 04:14:05,690
It'd be better if you just shut up.

5913
04:14:05,690 --> 04:14:06,329
Same eye.

5914
04:14:06,329 --> 04:14:07,129
It's gonna be the eye.

5915
04:14:08,090 --> 04:14:08,329
No.

5916
04:14:09,379 --> 04:14:09,700
Oh.

5917
04:14:10,420 --> 04:14:11,239
What were they doing?

5918
04:14:11,239 --> 04:14:12,120
What are you doing?

5919
04:14:12,120 --> 04:14:13,239
Spying on me?

5920
04:14:13,239 --> 04:14:15,780
Yeah I mean I thought it was weird too.

5921
04:14:15,780 --> 04:14:16,579
Wait why'd you trick...

5922
04:14:16,579 --> 04:14:17,540
He tricked us.

5923
04:14:17,540 --> 04:14:19,260
You were supposed to wait for me.

5924
04:14:19,899 --> 04:14:20,940
Supposed most.

5925
04:14:20,940 --> 04:14:21,659
Plans changed.

5926
04:14:22,379 --> 04:14:24,379
Afraid I was after your crystals huh?

5927
04:14:24,379 --> 04:14:25,430
Afraid?

5928
04:14:25,430 --> 04:14:26,579
Of you?

5929
04:14:26,579 --> 04:14:27,219
Would you get any...

5930
04:14:27,219 --> 04:14:28,819
What like if you had to get one of his tattoos?

5931
04:14:28,819 --> 04:14:29,459
What role again?

5932
04:14:29,459 --> 04:14:30,579
Just to look after Pilgrim.

5933
04:14:30,579 --> 04:14:31,079
Uh...

5934
04:14:32,659 --> 04:14:33,780
Maybe the card?

5935
04:14:33,780 --> 04:14:34,819
I don't know.

5936
04:14:34,819 --> 04:14:37,620
I'm getting the vi tattoo he has.

5937
04:14:46,170 --> 04:14:46,889
Okay cool.

5938
04:14:47,530 --> 04:14:50,950
He had a sunflower?

5939
04:14:51,829 --> 04:14:52,790
He did have a sunflower.

5940
04:14:52,790 --> 04:14:53,590
Oh shit.

5941
04:14:53,590 --> 04:14:54,389
I picked sunflower.

5942
04:14:59,659 --> 04:15:00,459
Alright finally.

5943
04:15:05,350 --> 04:15:05,829
Carl.

5944
04:15:08,149 --> 04:15:09,190
I didn't auto tattoo.

5945
04:15:18,979 --> 04:15:20,020
See I have the opposite problem.

5946
04:15:20,020 --> 04:15:21,299
My game is way too quiet.

5947
04:15:21,299 --> 04:15:22,420
It wasn't love at first sight.

5948
04:15:23,139 --> 04:15:24,500
Barney has his downsides.

5949
04:15:25,219 --> 04:15:27,780
But on the upside he is unshakably loyal.

5950
04:15:28,899 --> 04:15:29,139
Oh.

5951
04:15:33,700 --> 04:15:35,059
Ask about the conversation with Carl.

5952
04:15:35,780 --> 04:15:36,260
That's...

5953
04:15:36,260 --> 04:15:38,260
Let's just say the cause in short order.

5954
04:15:39,139 --> 04:15:40,819
Oh they're worried about water.

5955
04:15:40,819 --> 04:15:41,780
Oh my god.

5956
04:15:41,780 --> 04:15:43,379
Just fucking turn the faucet on.

5957
04:15:44,899 --> 04:15:46,500
Carl is this California or what?

5958
04:15:49,670 --> 04:15:51,030
Unruly brother.

5959
04:15:51,590 --> 04:15:55,159
Oh shit a scrapper hammer?

5960
04:15:56,040 --> 04:15:56,840
Alright.

5961
04:15:56,840 --> 04:15:57,959

5973
04:16:13,979 --> 04:16:14,379

5976
04:16:19,639 --> 04:16:20,840
No one said anything.

5977
04:16:20,840 --> 04:16:21,239
They did.

5978
04:16:21,239 --> 04:16:22,360
What did they say?

5979
04:16:22,360 --> 04:16:25,159
They said something very specific about somebody's hair.

5980
04:16:25,159 --> 04:16:25,799
What did they say?

5981
04:16:29,319 --> 04:16:30,680
No one said anything.

5982
04:16:30,680 --> 04:16:33,239
Somebody in your chat mentioned how somebody has...

5983
04:16:33,239 --> 04:16:34,680
They all have the same hair.

5984
04:16:36,860 --> 04:16:37,739
That fucking...

5985
04:16:37,739 --> 04:16:39,020
That fucked up haircut?

5986
04:16:39,659 --> 04:16:41,459
You don't remember this conversation we had?

5987
04:16:41,459 --> 04:16:43,219
Like an hour ago they said that.

5988
04:16:43,219 --> 04:16:44,260
Come in here.

5989
04:16:44,260 --> 04:16:47,139

They were right.

5993
04:16:50,180 --> 04:16:52,659
This guy yeah he does have that haircut.

5994
04:16:52,659 --> 04:16:54,420
Now that I think about it like...

5995
04:16:55,299 --> 04:16:57,780
Like four out of ten NPCs have this haircut.

5996
04:16:57,780 --> 04:16:58,180
You're right.

5997
04:16:58,180 --> 04:17:01,059
I actually saw this character earlier and I honestly was like...

5998
04:17:01,059 --> 04:17:04,340
If you looked like that in ten years I wouldn't be surprised.

5999
04:17:04,340 --> 04:17:04,840
What?

6000
04:17:05,540 --> 04:17:06,180
It kind of...

6001
04:17:06,180 --> 04:17:07,700
Like the face kind of looks like you.

6002
04:17:09,139 --> 04:17:11,299
You think I'm gonna look like this in ten years?

6003
04:17:11,299 --> 04:17:12,899
No I'm saying I wouldn't be surprised.

6004
04:17:12,899 --> 04:17:14,420
Like if you showed up you're like hey what's up?

6005
04:17:14,420 --> 04:17:16,340
And you like walked in and you were like a B.I.

6006
04:17:16,340 --> 04:17:18,739
I would be like oh okay.

6007
04:17:18,739 --> 04:17:19,540
I wouldn't...

6008
04:17:20,700 --> 04:17:21,899
With that hair though?

6009
04:17:21,899 --> 04:17:23,100
No my hair's not gonna do that.

6010
04:17:23,100 --> 04:17:25,879
No I'm not with that hair.

6011
04:17:25,879 --> 04:17:27,239

04:17:27,239 --> 04:17:28,360
I'm gonna look smokin'.

6013
04:17:30,840 --> 04:17:31,559
I don't doubt it.

6014
04:17:31,559 --> 04:17:33,159
I just like it could go either way.

6015
04:17:37,219 --> 04:17:37,940
Well they could...

6016
04:17:37,940 --> 04:17:39,059
No actually I could see that.

6017
04:17:40,500 --> 04:17:41,459
Okay now you're on board.

6018
04:17:41,459 --> 04:17:42,819

6022
04:17:46,180 --> 04:17:47,190

Do I have the hair?

6028
04:18:02,549 --> 04:18:03,430
Isn't that kind of weird?

6029
04:18:03,430 --> 04:18:03,909
That's weird.

6030
04:18:04,629 --> 04:18:07,829
If you like don't finish the heal it's like the World of Warcraft auto-follow.

6031
04:18:08,629 --> 04:18:09,190
That is weird.

6032
04:18:12,299 --> 04:18:13,500
Okay I'm gonna start using this.

6033
04:18:13,500 --> 04:18:15,180

6035
04:18:16,379 --> 04:18:23,340

6037
04:18:25,290 --> 04:18:27,049

6038
04:18:27,049 --> 04:18:27,930
What are you talking about?

6039
04:18:27,930 --> 04:18:29,770

04:18:29,770 --> 04:18:31,690
No I don't get ice cream with my order.

6041
04:18:31,690 --> 04:18:37,319
Okay well I'm just remembering from the thing that we did with the stuff and you know the place.

6042
04:18:38,409 --> 04:18:39,930
We had an M&M McFlurry?

6043
04:18:41,270 --> 04:18:44,950
No one of the German contestants said...

6044
04:18:44,950 --> 04:18:45,989
Oh oh oh.

6045
04:18:45,989 --> 04:18:49,829
That was a good order and I was like oh are you also an M&M McFlurry guy?

6046
04:18:49,829 --> 04:18:50,709
Okay okay.

6051
04:19:04,299 --> 04:19:05,979
that we ended up not doing it.

6052
04:19:05,979 --> 04:19:07,579
No because that would be like weird.

6053
04:19:08,540 --> 04:19:10,299
Look I'm gonna retire I'll just say it right?

6054
04:19:10,299 --> 04:19:11,500
It's not like it's a big deal.

6055
04:19:13,899 --> 04:19:14,940
Good shot though.

6056
04:19:14,940 --> 04:19:16,780
Good job you got that uh you got that fucker.

6057
04:19:18,219 --> 04:19:22,569
Yeah that imposter was seriously like causing problems and stuff.

6058
04:19:24,170 --> 04:19:26,809
I'm just really glad that we don't have to worry about that that guy anymore.

6059
04:19:27,450 --> 04:19:28,969
What was his number?

6060
04:19:28,969 --> 04:19:31,719
Number 12 or something I don't know.

It's just the number.

6065
04:19:43,989 --> 04:19:44,870
So that was fucked up.

6066
04:19:46,649 --> 04:19:48,409

6076
04:20:20,920 --> 04:20:21,590
No.

6077
04:20:22,469 --> 04:20:23,350
On either side of the building?

6078
04:20:23,989 --> 04:20:26,620
It's on this side.

6079
04:20:26,620 --> 04:20:28,579
It's inside the building.

6080
04:20:28,579 --> 04:20:30,020
It's got to be inside this building.

6081
04:20:30,020 --> 04:20:30,579
Yeah it's inside.

6082
04:20:31,299 --> 04:20:32,500

6086
04:20:37,540 --> 04:20:39,829
Ah ah I see bands.

04:20:44,280 --> 04:20:45,319
I knew it.

6091
04:20:45,319 --> 04:20:48,010
We'd betray us.

6092
04:20:48,010 --> 04:20:50,149
Fuck them Aiden.

6093
04:20:50,149 --> 04:20:50,629
Kill them all.

04:20:55,000 --> 04:20:55,799
Okay we gotta go.

04:20:56,680 --> 04:20:58,120
Wait is this the right area?

6097
04:20:59,079 --> 04:20:59,559

6098
04:21:01,319 --> 04:21:01,559

6099
04:21:01,559 --> 04:21:02,680
So no it's not.

6100
04:21:02,680 --> 04:21:03,799

6101
04:21:03,799 --> 04:21:04,840

We're really close.

6107
04:21:14,200 --> 04:21:15,639
There's a guy I got a gold statue dude.

6108
04:21:15,639 --> 04:21:16,760
A crystal statue.

6109
04:21:16,760 --> 04:21:17,559
This is probably worth a lot.

6110
04:21:18,200 --> 04:21:22,440
I gotta go.

6111
04:21:23,159 --> 04:21:24,569
I don't know where I am.

6112
04:21:25,909 --> 04:21:27,670
Do something yeah scream or something in the game.

6113
04:21:27,670 --> 04:21:28,069

Yep oh we have to go up the stairs.

6119
04:21:39,690 --> 04:21:40,809
This is a chemical zone though.

6120

Oh shit.

6121
04:21:43,620 --> 04:21:45,299
I don't know how you are where you are.

6122
04:21:46,549 --> 04:21:48,469
There's like a biohazard door here.

6123
04:21:49,190 --> 04:21:50,229
Walk from the inside.

6124
04:21:51,510 --> 04:21:52,870
It's a hard lock pick.

6125
04:21:52,870 --> 04:21:53,430
Oh no.

6126
04:21:54,149 --> 04:21:55,430
I'm about to be poisoned to death dude.

6127
04:21:55,989 --> 04:21:58,420

This thing was stupid.

6139
04:22:23,399 --> 04:22:25,530
I got this one open.

6140
04:22:27,319 --> 04:22:28,520
Oh there's a sack in it.

6141
04:22:28,520 --> 04:22:29,319
Old world money.

6142
04:22:29,879 --> 04:22:30,200
Run.

6143
04:22:31,020 --> 04:22:32,299
Wait there's a crystal.

6144
04:22:32,299 --> 04:22:34,139
I thought there was an epic mace in there man.

6145
04:22:34,860 --> 04:22:37,479
Get that crystal.

6146
04:22:39,100 --> 04:22:39,979
What's this door.

6147
04:22:39,979 --> 04:22:40,620
I don't know get out.

6148
04:22:41,260 --> 04:22:42,780
Locked from inside.

6149
04:22:42,780 --> 04:22:43,340
Oh what.

6150
04:22:44,940 --> 04:22:46,620
Oh yeah there's like a nighttime quest here.

6151
04:22:47,420 --> 04:22:48,790
I'm dead down here.

6152
04:22:48,790 --> 04:22:49,430
I don't know where I am.

6153
04:22:51,049 --> 04:22:57,260
Oh my god.

6154
04:22:57,260 --> 04:23:00,329
Oops oops.

6155
04:23:02,100 --> 04:23:04,870
Okay pretty cool man.

6156
04:23:06,379 --> 04:23:08,299
That wasn't even that wasn't even the thing we're supposed to get.

6157
04:23:09,690 --> 04:23:11,290
Oh yes yeah that wasn't it.

6158
04:23:12,549 --> 04:23:13,190
Here see come.

6159
04:23:14,729 --> 04:23:16,569
This it was down the street.

6160
04:23:18,659 --> 04:23:20,579
Then you turn a right you make a right.

6161
04:23:20,579 --> 04:23:25,979
And then down this street it goes down to like three two one one.

6162
04:23:27,020 --> 04:23:28,059
Is it right here.

6163
04:23:28,059 --> 04:23:29,819
It's definitely it's right here to the right.

6164
04:23:30,620 --> 04:23:32,729
You can see behind this wall.

6165
04:23:32,729 --> 04:23:33,610
Can you.

6166
04:23:33,610 --> 04:23:34,649
Yeah it's right there.

6167
04:23:34,649 --> 04:23:35,690
Yeah you can.

6168
04:23:36,409 --> 04:23:37,610
Is there a way to get in from here.

6169
04:23:38,409 --> 04:23:39,739
Oh we got a cop car.

6170
04:23:40,379 --> 04:23:42,469
Not that many people there.

6171
04:23:44,899 --> 04:23:46,020
Oh the fucking order.

6172
04:23:46,020 --> 04:23:50,409
Okay what is this McDonald's order.

6173
04:23:50,409 --> 04:23:51,290
McDonald's order.

6174
04:23:52,010 --> 04:23:52,729
It has changed.

6175
04:23:54,219 --> 04:23:56,700
Before I had a huge order before.

6176
04:23:56,700 --> 04:23:58,139
But people misunderstood what I said.

6177
04:23:59,020 --> 04:24:01,899
It was like five sandwiches and like a bunch of McNuggets and stuff.

6178
04:24:02,540 --> 04:24:05,020
What people didn't understand was that was a group order.

6179
04:24:05,899 --> 04:24:07,739
That was supposed to be shared.

6180
04:24:07,739 --> 04:24:09,180
They didn't take into account the shareables.

6181
04:24:11,209 --> 04:24:12,809
You buy the nuggets for the group.

6182
04:24:12,809 --> 04:24:14,409
You buy an extra sandwich for the group.

6183
04:24:14,409 --> 04:24:16,649
In case somebody wants like a McChicken or whatever.

6184
04:24:16,649 --> 04:24:17,850
It's a family pack.

6185
04:24:17,850 --> 04:24:19,690
It's like a yeah essential.

6186
04:24:21,510 --> 04:24:23,829
The actual order is.

6187
04:24:23,829 --> 04:24:25,590
Are you ready get out your pen.

6188
04:24:26,649 --> 04:24:27,149
Coffee.

6189
04:24:27,850 --> 04:24:28,889
It is a.

6190
04:24:28,889 --> 04:24:29,389
Cheetos.

6191
04:24:30,659 --> 04:24:36,600
A medium 10 piece nugget meal with sweet and sour and honey mustard.

6192
04:24:39,270 --> 04:24:43,579
And then it's two double cheeseburgers not McDoubles.

6193
04:24:43,579 --> 04:24:47,079
Two double cheeseburgers without a pickle.

6194
04:24:47,079 --> 04:24:47,639
No pickle.

6195
04:24:48,809 --> 04:24:49,370
You lost me.

6196
04:24:51,959 --> 04:24:56,139
And a powerade.

6197
04:24:56,139 --> 04:24:57,579
And if I'm feeling a little bit.

6198
04:24:58,899 --> 04:25:00,020
If I'm feeling sloppy.

6199
04:25:00,020 --> 04:25:01,829
An apple pie.

6200
04:25:01,829 --> 04:25:04,149
If I'm kind of sloppy could go for the pie.

6201
04:25:06,409 --> 04:25:07,129
Okay.

6202
04:25:07,129 --> 04:25:10,040
I think that's pretty good.

6203
04:25:10,040 --> 04:25:10,600
No pickle.

6204
04:25:10,600 --> 04:25:12,040
No I don't I don't want pickles.

6205
04:25:13,450 --> 04:25:14,889
I like eating pickles individually.

6206
04:25:14,889 --> 04:25:18,969
I like pickles but McDonald's pickles I mean pretty low on the totem pole.

6207
04:25:18,969 --> 04:25:19,290
Exactly.

6208
04:25:19,290 --> 04:25:21,700
We got to kill these bandits down here.

6209
04:25:21,700 --> 04:25:23,459
I think that's our current situation.

6210
04:25:23,459 --> 04:25:26,420
I think we were talking to Sophie about some premeditated murder.

6211
04:25:26,420 --> 04:25:29,030
Okay.

6212
04:25:29,030 --> 04:25:30,469
What's your order from McDonald's?

6213
04:25:31,930 --> 04:25:34,729
My order from McDonald's is like go anywhere else.

6214
04:25:36,170 --> 04:25:38,379
You one of those people come on.

6215
04:25:38,379 --> 04:25:41,739
If I have to like if like gun to my head.

6216
04:25:42,540 --> 04:25:44,459
Two double quarter pounders with cheese.

6217
04:25:44,459 --> 04:25:45,020
Okay.

6218
04:25:45,020 --> 04:25:50,459
And no like no like made up extra stuff so that the person gets confused and is like

6219
04:25:51,100 --> 04:25:52,459
they're putting the pickles on anyway.

6220
04:25:52,459 --> 04:25:52,959
That's mine.

6221
04:25:55,579 --> 04:25:58,540
Like you can't go to McDonald's and say well I don't want to pick they're fucking putting

6222
04:25:58,540 --> 04:25:59,180
the pickles on.

6223
04:25:59,180 --> 04:26:01,100
No then they will take them off.

6224
04:26:01,579 --> 04:26:05,100
Shut up and like accept your pickles and then she takes the pickles off herself.

6225
04:26:05,100 --> 04:26:06,459
I think it's kind of weird too.

6226
04:26:06,459 --> 04:26:08,940
I like pickles so I'm not going to like make a big fuss about it.

6227
04:26:13,079 --> 04:26:17,159
I mean if it's tomatoes I'll tell them no tomatoes because that's like satanic.

6228
04:26:18,569 --> 04:26:18,969
Okay.

6229
04:26:18,969 --> 04:26:25,739
So you mentioned earlier that if you had a choice you wouldn't go to McDonald's.

6230
04:26:25,739 --> 04:26:27,739
So where would you where would you go instead?

6231
04:26:27,739 --> 04:26:30,459
Well when I lived in Boston you know this place Boston right.

6232
04:26:30,459 --> 04:26:31,979
Oh yeah I've watched it I know that shitty Boston.

6233
04:26:31,979 --> 04:26:35,260
Okay yeah so like there was a u-burger great place.

6234
04:26:35,979 --> 04:26:37,819
You know u-burger of course.

6235
04:26:37,819 --> 04:26:38,059
Yes.

6236
04:26:38,059 --> 04:26:41,020
And across the street there was a McDonald's and the McDonald's always had people walking

6237
04:26:41,020 --> 04:26:43,579
into it and I was like what a bunch of fucking morons right.

6238
04:26:43,579 --> 04:26:47,209
So it really depends on the location like in that case I'm going to u-burger.

6239
04:26:47,209 --> 04:26:51,049
But hold on hold on hold on you have got this all wrong.

6240
04:26:51,049 --> 04:26:53,530
I'm supporting local business wherever possible.

6241
04:26:53,530 --> 04:26:56,889
You got this all wrong here's first of all McDonald's is way faster than a restaurant

6242
04:26:56,889 --> 04:26:57,450
like u-burger.

6243
04:26:58,700 --> 04:27:02,139
You can literally drive to the drive-through or walk in and have your meal in literally

6244
04:27:02,139 --> 04:27:04,409
like 30 to 40 seconds.

6245
04:27:04,409 --> 04:27:06,010
Nice nice eye by the way.

6246
04:27:06,010 --> 04:27:07,850
Hopefully it heals like the rest of the entire world.

6247
04:27:09,850 --> 04:27:14,889
I was laughing I had a one of the gas tanks and it blew up during the cut scene.

6248
04:27:14,889 --> 04:27:16,659
It was right behind us.

6249
04:27:16,659 --> 04:27:17,620
I hope we're not dead.

6250
04:27:17,620 --> 04:27:18,260
Oh she's dead.

6251
04:27:20,659 --> 04:27:22,739
She died of a black right eye.

6252
04:27:22,739 --> 04:27:23,620
You did it again.

6253
04:27:24,579 --> 04:27:27,209
Oh my god anyways.

6254
04:27:29,209 --> 04:27:31,370
We'll talk about this after we fight the tyrant okay.

6255
04:27:36,739 --> 04:27:40,100
Oh yeah did you remember in dying light one the guy would always say oh fuck it fuck this

6256
04:27:40,659 --> 04:27:42,899
fucker just fucking guy was snotting his goon fucker.

6257
04:27:51,370 --> 04:27:54,809
I don't know how to change weapons back to my good weapon because it's my one weapon

6258
04:27:54,809 --> 04:27:57,209
but my one is my throwies.

6259
04:27:57,209 --> 04:27:59,290
Are you looking for crystals or are you making me do all the work?

6260
04:27:59,850 --> 04:28:01,290
Looking for crystals.

6261
04:28:01,290 --> 04:28:02,889
Yes that's the mission.

6262
04:28:02,889 --> 04:28:04,090
Oh I thought we got to kill the guy.

6263
04:28:04,969 --> 04:28:08,280
He just lit himself up he just walked right through the fire.

6264
04:28:09,159 --> 04:28:13,530
Yeah threw a bottle at him.

6265
04:28:14,569 --> 04:28:16,360
Oh wait what about this?

6266
04:28:17,319 --> 04:28:21,319
Okay so you were going to say something about my desire to support local business over McDonald's.

6267
04:28:22,200 --> 04:28:24,360
No what I said was there's a huge difference.

6268
04:28:25,159 --> 04:28:28,600
You burger is on a different tier than McDonald's is.

6269
04:28:28,600 --> 04:28:29,639
Are we doing a tier list?

6270
04:28:29,639 --> 04:28:33,719
That's like saying oh you know the local like authentic Italian restaurant down the street from

6271
04:28:33,719 --> 04:28:39,479
my house is what exactly versus but versus like a fast Italian like food place.

6272
04:28:39,479 --> 04:28:44,200
You always have a choice everyone's always like oh chipotle so like fucking

6273
04:28:44,280 --> 04:28:48,440
what chipotle is like wait the fence you want to you die on fences now.

6274
04:28:49,719 --> 04:28:50,440
What?

6275
04:28:50,440 --> 04:28:53,079
Like what people talk about chipotle.

6276
04:28:53,079 --> 04:28:57,719
Hold on I just I just threw this tank at him and did half his health by hitting him in the head.

6277
04:28:58,840 --> 04:29:00,120
Okay we'll do it again.

6278
04:29:00,120 --> 04:29:07,690
All right listen to me it's the how much it costs how fast it is how are you in a hurry

6279
04:29:07,690 --> 04:29:12,010
do you want to sit down at like a restaurant right like because you could order takeout

6280
04:29:12,010 --> 04:29:16,250
from some of these places but it's it's not the same as getting like a cheeseburger from McDonald's.

6281
04:29:16,250 --> 04:29:17,770
Okay well what is a ron?

6282
04:29:18,809 --> 04:29:19,290
A what?

6283
04:29:20,090 --> 04:29:23,209
You can go in and you sit down and you can rest but you can also ron.

6284
04:29:24,329 --> 04:29:24,729
Ron?

6285
04:29:25,610 --> 04:29:36,489
Ron restaurant like which like trick or treat I understand that restaurant I don't understand.

6286
04:29:36,489 --> 04:29:39,129
But anyway let's get back to the point that we were making before.

6287
04:29:39,770 --> 04:29:43,780
Very important point McDonald's and you burger are not on the same tier of restaurant.

6288
04:29:45,899 --> 04:29:49,260
In fact I would probably assume that's what I'm saying though is

6289
04:29:50,379 --> 04:29:53,659
that's exactly what I'm saying you get to choose the tier of place you go.

6290
04:29:53,659 --> 04:29:56,780
Yes but the different tiers exist for very specific reasons.

6291
04:29:56,780 --> 04:29:59,819
You get McDonald's within like five minutes of walking in the restaurant.

6292
04:29:59,819 --> 04:30:01,579
New burger is fast food as well.

6293
04:30:02,219 --> 04:30:04,860
But it's not it's not the same fast food.

6294
04:30:04,860 --> 04:30:07,180
It's gonna get better and it's probably more expensive.

6295
04:30:11,479 --> 04:30:16,840
Probably how much how much is a single like I don't know I've been years since I've done.

6296
04:30:17,639 --> 04:30:21,530
Okay but it's more expensive and it's gonna take a little longer to get your food.

6297
04:30:21,530 --> 04:30:23,370
So if you okay you got 20 minutes.

6298
04:30:24,010 --> 04:30:26,649
Oh shit okay there's a you burger right here there's McDonald's right here.

6299
04:30:26,649 --> 04:30:29,930
I have literally 20 minutes before I have to go to my thing I'm doing.

6300
04:30:29,930 --> 04:30:32,090
You're not gonna go order like a burger from you burger

6301
04:30:32,090 --> 04:30:33,610
because it's gonna take it's gonna take a little longer.

6302
04:30:34,329 --> 04:30:36,170
It doesn't take 20 minutes.

6303
04:30:36,889 --> 04:30:40,649
But you want to make sure that you can just get in there get your two double cheeseburgers.

6304
04:30:40,649 --> 04:30:43,610
Have you ever shown up on time for anything you're going to you burger?

6305
04:30:44,489 --> 04:30:47,450
Oh I might be like 10 minutes late.

6306
04:30:47,450 --> 04:30:50,250
Like you're you're not thinking about this when you're going into the restaurant.

6307
04:30:55,000 --> 04:30:57,719
All right but the point still stands.

6308
04:30:59,299 --> 04:31:02,090
There are oh movement speed.

6309
04:31:06,379 --> 04:31:13,979
McDonald's there's a tier McDonald's Wendy's Burger King Carl's Jr. Arby's.

6310
04:31:13,979 --> 04:31:16,940
This tier I'm morally opposed to the tier.

6311
04:31:16,940 --> 04:31:18,540
You'd go to Arby's wouldn't you?

6312
04:31:18,540 --> 04:31:19,819
You'd go to Arby's wouldn't you?

6313
04:31:19,899 --> 04:31:20,219
Say it.

6314
04:31:20,219 --> 04:31:21,899
I've actually had a really good Arby's sandwich.

6315
04:31:21,899 --> 04:31:24,780
Oh and look at that he's gonna go to Arby's instead of McDonald's.

6316
04:31:24,780 --> 04:31:26,379
That's exactly what I was talking about.

6317
04:31:26,379 --> 04:31:28,379
I went to Arby's over McDonald's.

6318
04:31:28,379 --> 04:31:29,979
I'm sorry like was that a problem?

6319
04:31:29,979 --> 04:31:31,819
Yeah that's actually a huge problem.

6320
04:31:31,819 --> 04:31:32,940
I took Carl hostage.

6321
04:31:32,940 --> 04:31:33,819
What's wrong with Arby's?

6322
04:31:34,780 --> 04:31:35,260
It's all right.

6323
04:31:35,979 --> 04:31:37,899
Exactly I'm helping Sophie get him back.

6324
04:31:40,790 --> 04:31:43,670
I knew you were gonna be a guy that was gonna go to Arby's instead of McDonald's.

6325
04:31:43,670 --> 04:31:46,309
I mean Arby's I've only ever been like once.

6326
04:31:47,190 --> 04:31:50,629
Okay I've only been to Arby's because going on like

6327
04:31:51,110 --> 04:31:57,510
a bus like an actual public transport bus between Boston and New York they would stop at an Arby's

6328
04:31:58,549 --> 04:32:02,389
and it's like hey if you guys want food we're stopping at Arby's you don't have a choice.

6329
04:32:03,700 --> 04:32:04,899
So what did you get at Arby's?

6330
04:32:06,200 --> 04:32:10,200
I don't know I don't even know what any of their sandwiches are called.

6331
04:32:10,200 --> 04:32:11,559
Have you been to Jack in the Box before?

6332
04:32:13,750 --> 04:32:17,829
Jack in the Box and Sonic which I think are the same place both kind of just grossed me out and

6333
04:32:17,829 --> 04:32:19,030
I don't think I've ever been.

6334
04:32:19,030 --> 04:32:20,229
You're right about Sonic.

6335
04:32:20,229 --> 04:32:21,430
You got Sonic correct.

6336
04:32:21,510 --> 04:32:23,190
Is Jack in the Box another IHOP?

6337
04:32:23,829 --> 04:32:24,069
No.

6338
04:32:25,219 --> 04:32:27,700
Oh no there's Jack in the Box is not equivalent.

6339
04:32:27,700 --> 04:32:29,540
There's like Jenny's IHOP and Jack in the Box.

6340
04:32:29,540 --> 04:32:31,299
No no no he's wrong again.

6341
04:32:31,299 --> 04:32:34,100
Okay listen Jack in the Box is like a McDonald's.

6342
04:32:34,100 --> 04:32:36,739
I've I've never been so I'm just okay.

6343
04:32:36,739 --> 04:32:40,659
Jack in the Box is like a McDonald's but they have literally every food ever invented.

6344
04:32:40,659 --> 04:32:43,139
I think you can order fucking spaghetti at Jack in the Box.

6345
04:32:43,139 --> 04:32:45,139
Besides that did you have to do that?

6346
04:32:47,370 --> 04:32:49,899
No I didn't know.

6347
04:32:52,120 --> 04:32:52,840
Come help me.

6348
04:32:53,559 --> 04:33:04,250
Okay so we have to go to a trashy fast food like we have to.

6349
04:33:04,250 --> 04:33:05,930
There's no it has to happen.

6350
04:33:05,930 --> 04:33:07,529
What is your number one pick?

6351
04:33:07,529 --> 04:33:09,450
It's always McDonald's always.

6352
04:33:09,450 --> 04:33:10,729
Well how is it always McDonald's?

6353
04:33:10,729 --> 04:33:14,330
Because I like McDonald's and it's consistent and it's fun and it's delicious

6354
04:33:14,330 --> 04:33:17,450
and they had a clown it was Ronald McDonald's like really cool and

6355
04:33:17,450 --> 04:33:20,729
if you're going to McDonald's because of the marketing because of the clown.

6356
04:33:20,729 --> 04:33:23,209
Ronald McDonald's like cool and they got rid of them.

6357
04:33:24,330 --> 04:33:28,009
Have you guys noticed this they stir when was the last time you you don't go to McDonald's

6358
04:33:28,009 --> 04:33:29,049
so you do you can't relate to this.

6359
04:33:30,759 --> 04:33:34,599
I mean they're everywhere so I've seen them but no I understand Ronald McDonald's is really

6360
04:33:34,599 --> 04:33:35,959
they're kind of phasing them out.

6361
04:33:35,959 --> 04:33:39,080
Yeah they turned McDonald's into like a weird little like cafe.

6362
04:33:39,880 --> 04:33:42,520
They took out all the McDonald's there's no more grimace.

6363
04:33:43,419 --> 04:33:47,819
I I do feel like they're trying to Starbucks it up.

6364
04:33:47,819 --> 04:33:49,500
I I I get what you're saying there.

6365
04:33:50,139 --> 04:33:55,020
The food is still it's still the same though but they're trying to get rid of Ronald McDonald's

6366
04:33:55,020 --> 04:33:59,540
and they're replacing him with like yeah like a Starbucks window.

6367
04:34:02,360 --> 04:34:05,560
I don't think they did him I you know if they want how would this you know what I would have

6368
04:34:05,560 --> 04:34:10,840
been okay with if Ronald McDonald took the makeup off and he was Ronald and it was like look he's

6369
04:34:10,840 --> 04:34:15,720
a regular guy it's like Ron like Ronald like have him take the makeup off and just be like

6370
04:34:15,720 --> 04:34:18,119
a regular guy like what's the problem why do you have to get rid of him.

6371
04:34:18,840 --> 04:34:22,279
I don't know I could I could be down with a Ronald.

6372
04:34:22,279 --> 04:34:27,220
Like you know that he like puts the makeup on and like this like makes like people happy and stuff

6373
04:34:27,220 --> 04:34:33,509
but stop throwing bombs at me that would be creepy what

6374
04:34:35,430 --> 04:34:44,310
my god please the zombies over there got a couple dead yeah he would be Ronald McDonald right

6375
04:34:45,110 --> 04:34:49,400
like but if we just he wouldn't be the clown he'd be like a regular guy with

6376
04:34:50,200 --> 04:34:52,919
maybe they could keep the hair I don't I don't know what they would do

6377
04:34:55,369 --> 04:35:02,860
keep the nose I'm surprised like there's one thing in my life it's okay it's probably a

6378
04:35:02,860 --> 04:35:06,380
problem with me there's probably a lot of people that have no problem with us if someone orders

6379
04:35:06,380 --> 04:35:13,979
food they're like a an order food app yeah and it's McDonald's I'm like morally posed and there's

6380
04:35:13,979 --> 04:35:19,099
a nauseated disgusting feeling in the put in my stomach really yeah to see like oh here's your

6381
04:35:19,099 --> 04:35:27,580
delivery with like the McDonald's M on it it's just like you would you stay friends with this person

6382
04:35:28,299 --> 04:35:35,099
I wouldn't have you would you would avoid this fucking person we would you've definitely done

6383
04:35:35,099 --> 04:35:39,020
yeah we would avoid this person but this is what I'm saying you're like oh there's just 20 minutes

6384
04:35:39,020 --> 04:35:43,979
do you stop at a McDonald's okay you can order food from anywhere a person will magically appear

6385
04:35:43,979 --> 04:35:48,619
and be generated by the universe bring it to your door and then like disassemble as they leave

6386
04:35:48,619 --> 04:35:54,779
and you chose McDonald's oh but but what if it's not enough what if they're not open some

6387
04:35:55,740 --> 04:36:01,580
McDonald's is open if nothing else is open but when is nothing else but McDonald's open

6388
04:36:01,580 --> 04:36:04,939
I guarantee I get this in the window or I'll give a hundred community stops

6389
04:36:06,139 --> 04:36:13,880
thank you the point is if you are going to be in a scenario where you need something fast

6390
04:36:14,520 --> 04:36:20,500
yeah you don't have to order like uber eats McDonald's all the time right but McDonald's

6391
04:36:20,500 --> 04:36:25,060
is usually faster than all of them is usually cheaper than all of them but I like it so that's

6392
04:36:25,060 --> 04:36:36,340
all I have to say what is your argument is if there's you could just say you like it I like

6393
04:36:36,340 --> 04:36:41,139
the dogs you can be wrong it's cool it's not being wrong oh I think less of you but

6394
04:36:42,099 --> 04:36:48,869
okay then you have to answer me this question yeah McDonald's Burger King Wendy's Jack in the

6395
04:36:48,869 --> 04:36:55,430
Box Arby's where are you going if you had to pick one if I had to pick one of those

6396
04:36:56,310 --> 04:37:04,090

6397
04:37:04,090 --> 04:37:16,659
permission that's fair will you help me kill this guy yeah hold on I thought you just puked

6398
04:37:16,659 --> 04:37:26,580
because like you thought he was gross I don't have enough stamina for these there's another

6399
04:37:26,580 --> 04:37:37,639
thing over here but no fast food I genuinely like McDonald's there's something else with it too

6400
04:37:37,639 --> 04:37:42,680
and you can call me oh cringe cringe cringe cringe Andy well I don't know when I was a kid

6403
04:37:57,139 --> 04:38:02,020
doesn't have to be like restaurant quality high quality well it is a restaurant so it's

6404

restaurant of course my palate is enormous I'm dying hold up I have such a sophisticated palette

6406
04:38:16,139 --> 04:38:22,779

6464
04:45:49,909 --> 04:45:53,509
let me make that clear I'm just saying like the jingle is an ad

6465
04:45:53,509 --> 04:46:05,029
so it has to be like just go just do your thing please hold on hold on so like like we can like

6466
04:46:05,029 --> 04:46:08,630
you don't just do the jingle like the longer you do like some cringy shit before like

6467
04:46:15,509 --> 04:46:20,389
I'm loving it oh like the more you do like the better you think it is let's go to the mission

6468
04:46:20,389 --> 04:46:26,299
marker in the commercial they don't go

6469
04:46:29,900 --> 04:46:32,540
what are you doing well what were you doing you were doing like

6470
04:46:33,659 --> 04:46:39,540
you know you're like they don't like moan they don't they also don't beatbox

6471
04:46:41,110 --> 04:46:44,709
we just finished the mission for god's sake Ronald would be disappointed

6472
04:46:49,099 --> 04:46:58,340
oh cool all right mission time yeah wow you're never gonna get out of the tutorial zone

6473
04:47:02,759 --> 04:47:13,610
is this whole zone a tutorial we apparently are taking so long okay well I'm here I'll play

6474
04:47:13,610 --> 04:47:20,090
you're not here I'll be there in a sec also it it cut out you didn't hear I did not hear you

6475
04:47:20,090 --> 04:47:27,180
at all I heard for like a solid five seconds I screamed at the top of my lungs are you serious

6476
04:47:29,419 --> 04:47:33,020
yeah you discord did not like that all that we heard on my stream was

6477
04:47:33,659 --> 04:47:38,060
I guess that means I should wait here oh yeah discord was like noise cancellation you're gone

6478
04:47:39,099 --> 04:47:53,860
look at the clip hold on let me see what happened to the game uh we're inhibiting

6479
04:47:57,700 --> 04:48:02,259
what yourself up here this is what you did yeah and you're like

6480
04:48:02,259 --> 04:48:22,200
what did you do it I didn't hear anything it's like you just screamed in my face and I don't

6481
04:48:22,200 --> 04:48:28,500
hear that that's like I'm baiting you that has to be bullshit right yeah no I'm pretty sure discord

6482
04:48:28,500 --> 04:48:33,299
will like you can do stuff like you can snap your fingers if you're not talking and the snap won't

6483
04:48:33,299 --> 04:48:37,540
go through discord that was ridiculous but you screamed for so long you would think it would come

6484
04:48:37,540 --> 04:48:44,580
through yeah I thought like a little like even the beginning of it would but no are we in like

6485
04:48:44,580 --> 04:48:52,419
a dream yeah we are you got any you got any opinions on dreams that I don't know about I

6486
04:48:52,419 --> 04:48:57,779
feel like that's a thing you'd have a like a whole bit about what about dreaming yeah I don't know

6487
04:48:57,779 --> 04:49:02,740
it just seems like a thing that you'd be into I mean it's kind of interesting that we do that

6488
04:49:02,740 --> 04:49:08,020
our brains are so overactive that even while they're turned off they have to be functioning

6489
04:49:08,020 --> 04:49:18,540
and have to be doing things like a shark it's pretty weird oh is this like where we remember

6490
04:49:18,540 --> 04:49:21,900
that the girl we've been looking for this whole time actually burned alive and we don't need to

6491
04:49:21,900 --> 04:49:28,970
look for anymore and the game's over it's weird why that guy show up yeah is he a part of the dream

6492
04:49:29,610 --> 04:49:36,889
are you downloading um lego star wars angry birds whatever it was uh no I had a bad feeling about

6493
04:49:36,889 --> 04:49:49,430
it from the start he kind of lied to us then I said I would try anything once I did oh I mean

6494
04:49:49,430 --> 04:49:54,470
like I like if someone put it in front of me I would try it was a whole other story when you

6495
04:49:54,470 --> 04:49:59,029
don't like you gotta like if you manage to take out those I don't have an ipad jack cock this

6496
04:49:59,029 --> 04:50:15,939
game's fun okay meat has anyone ever told you it's weird that you call them community subs

6497
04:50:15,939 --> 04:50:24,740
by peace immunity subs yeah like community gifted subs I've never heard anyone say that ever and do

6498
04:50:24,740 --> 04:50:32,900
me a favor um scroll over the uh the gifted sub I'm sure that's what the full like long

6499
04:50:33,540 --> 04:50:39,139
exact phrasing of it is I'm sure it is but it seems weird like when you could say like gifted

6500
04:50:39,139 --> 04:50:43,779
subs oh but it's the same that's literally the definition of what it is it's a community sub

6501
04:50:43,779 --> 04:50:50,169
it's a gifted community it's a community sub I'm not disagreeing oh what do you call it a

6502
04:50:50,169 --> 04:50:54,889
gift thanks for the gifted subs thanks for the community subs gift it just gifted it's shorter

6503
04:50:55,529 --> 04:51:02,500
yeah but I mean it's classified as a community sub there are prime subs right there are community

6504
04:51:02,500 --> 04:51:07,220
subs and then there are like regular subs right but but when when the thing happens it will say

6505
04:51:07,220 --> 04:51:16,360
so-and-so gifted 10 subs they gifted a gifted 10 community subs are we reaching for like content

6506
04:51:16,360 --> 04:51:21,580
right now for like funny things no I was I thought there was one of those things there

6507
04:51:22,540 --> 04:51:27,500
oh there is okay watch out guys we got one of those things there is a tutorial area

6513
04:52:18,279 --> 04:52:34,459
quarts of blood I'm being chased oh it is like a super mutant do you want to try to kill him

6514
04:52:35,099 --> 04:52:40,459
I don't think we can I think so volatile it's kind of right in the way that I want to go

6515
04:52:41,180 --> 04:52:44,619
unless we run from him for like six hours and he falls into a fence you can't kill him

6516
04:52:45,259 --> 04:52:51,080
it's a container right here I don't know you probably don't care though I'm coming back to

6581
05:02:15,349 --> 05:02:24,939
all that shit on your weapon then it breaks and you got to do it again every time are you aware

6582
05:02:24,939 --> 05:02:32,709
of what IGN's game of all time is ocarina of time they made a revised list of their game

6583
05:02:33,669 --> 05:02:41,290
I just I don't know what what was number one breath of the wild is now the new best game of all time

6584
05:02:41,290 --> 05:02:51,159
isn't yeah what's in the top five is there more than there I can't remember it was all very

6585
05:02:51,159 --> 05:02:57,220
upsetting but isn't breath of the wild and clicks isn't breath of the wild supposed to be really

6586
05:02:57,380 --> 05:03:02,419
good how could breath of the wild be any good when it all it did was coffee genshin in fact

6587
05:03:02,419 --> 05:03:07,959
would you rather it be ocarina of time can we be honest I would feel like I could see where they

6588
05:03:07,959 --> 05:03:15,319
were coming from if it was ocarina of time right but like it's ocarina of time is what everybody

6589
05:03:15,319 --> 05:03:21,080
says I get it's ocarina of time the best game ever made in all of history is on the Nintendo

6590
05:03:21,080 --> 05:03:30,139
switch so what oh turn turn around and look is this what you're saying look at how beautiful the

6591
05:03:30,139 --> 05:03:35,099
graphics are it's so wonderful this wouldn't run on a switch that's what you're saying so a game

6592
05:03:35,099 --> 05:03:39,979
can't be good if it has like not incredible beautiful I would say 10 out of 10 direct x12

6593
05:03:39,979 --> 05:03:45,340
I think graphics with the foliage the entire history of game development if you really think

6594
05:03:45,340 --> 05:03:52,729
about like what is the best thing if you just narrowed it down to what like what's your favorite

6595
05:03:52,729 --> 05:04:00,150
game of all time favorite game of all time yeah hide the sausage what the fuck is that

6596
05:04:00,869 --> 05:04:14,540
I mean you could play that on anything what's your favorite video game of all time I'm jumping

6597
05:04:14,540 --> 05:04:23,139
why are you jumping it got blocked we're gonna go down there to meet Sophie uh favorite video

6598
05:04:23,139 --> 05:04:30,840
game of all time you alive yes okay if ocarina of time is is acceptable to you breath of the

6599
05:04:30,840 --> 05:04:38,599
wild is not acceptable to you what is acceptable to you as number one like you what is your number

6600
05:04:38,599 --> 05:04:43,479
one like or at least something in the top well no this is about what is acceptable to me or what

6601
05:04:43,479 --> 05:04:48,599
I would choose what would you choose is not the best game of all time okay so what if I had to

6602
05:04:48,599 --> 05:04:54,680
wait a minute most acceptable one so you're saying that people have opinions yeah people

6603
05:04:54,680 --> 05:04:59,319
have opinions okay so what is your favorite McDonald's what's your favorite game of all time

6604
05:04:59,319 --> 05:05:08,069
um I feel like I'm gonna forget because I haven't ever like played one I could tell you but mine is

6605
05:05:08,790 --> 05:05:17,349
if it doesn't help you if it's Diablo 2 or like Bloodborne wait you close you had it it's I had

6606
05:05:17,349 --> 05:05:22,970
it it's probably Bloodborne that's probably my favorite game of all time but the reason why I'm

6607
05:05:22,970 --> 05:05:31,130
saying maybe not is because it only released on ps4 at 30 fps yeah it's just like it yeah so like

6608
05:05:31,130 --> 05:05:36,009
wouldn't it suck if the best game of all time was only on the Nintendo Switch yeah but still it

6609
05:05:36,009 --> 05:05:41,369
Bloodborne is like sorry for Bloodborne it's making you question it Diablo 2 the wild you're

6610
05:05:41,369 --> 05:05:47,619
like I don't know because I don't because I don't particularly because you don't want to

6611
05:05:47,619 --> 05:05:50,740
pick this fight because there's people in chat that are like me your breath of wild and you

6612
05:05:50,740 --> 05:05:56,500
don't want to like upset them and but you'll be like all Bloodborne sir I I talked a like a full

6613
05:05:57,060 --> 05:06:02,630
college essay about how I don't like the Zelda games so you're barking up the absolute wrong tree

6614
05:06:08,939 --> 05:06:17,419
Diablo 2 Team Fortress 2 and Bloodborne and um

6615
05:06:17,419 --> 05:06:23,060
that goes pretty damn good but that's not it was it was a fun list because of how lazy it looks

6616
05:06:23,060 --> 05:06:28,500
like around number 50 is all of the blizzard games it's just like oh I don't know Starcraft

6617
05:06:28,500 --> 05:06:34,979
Diablo World of Warcraft like whatever it's just one blizzard game that was made by Blizzard North

6618
05:06:34,979 --> 05:06:40,439
like 25 years ago I'm gonna hit you with this because you're a big fan okay World of Warcraft

6619
05:06:40,439 --> 05:06:46,599
was like top 50 in this top 100 list game of all times yeah I agree I think around top 10 or 20

6620
05:06:46,599 --> 05:06:52,659
was Final Fantasy 14 it's got the most guards are we talking about like cultural impact are we talking

6621
05:06:52,659 --> 05:06:58,310
just like what game was actually the best like video game I don't know I think I think it was

6622
05:06:58,310 --> 05:07:04,540
the best that still holds up if anything goes wrong we retreat to our base okay well you're

6623
05:07:04,540 --> 05:07:09,189
you're dashing you're dashing that you're you're dodging the question I'm dashing I'm dodging

6624
05:07:09,189 --> 05:07:13,990
what is your favorite game of all time I think it actually would be like the other two are

6625
05:07:13,990 --> 05:07:21,529
Bloodborne oh we're on the same page here so we completely agree okay yeah that's why we know

6626
05:07:21,529 --> 05:07:29,240
we're both right oh that's how we know our opinion is correct because we both have it oh yeah okay

6627
05:07:29,240 --> 05:07:33,159
like if anyone else were to come into the conversation and that's and that's not a

6628
05:07:33,159 --> 05:07:39,529
problem right that's not a problem well we have majority yeah you and I have the same opinion

6629
05:07:39,529 --> 05:07:47,349
therefore it's correct that's kind of how it works we're doing monkey bars right now kind of

6706
05:21:18,229 --> 05:21:23,380
well so it's like a secret so you can like hide and crawl under the desk so okay you're telling me

6707
05:21:23,380 --> 05:21:29,830
that you want the desk here sitting here and you want a spot for someone to be able to come under

6708
05:21:29,830 --> 05:21:35,880
here under the desk why do you have like an L desk because they can like crawl under the whole L

6713
05:22:08,840 --> 05:22:16,380

6714
05:22:16,380 --> 05:22:21,669
before but I'm telling it again if you had at least A or B average and you brought your report

6715
05:22:21,669 --> 05:22:26,860
card to Chuck E Cheese they would give you like 20 free tokens and it was a huge deal to every kid

6716
05:22:26,860 --> 05:22:32,659
and in the in the town and neighborhood whatever it was like oh I get free tokens Chuck E Cheese

6717
05:22:32,659 --> 05:22:38,759

6719
05:22:44,259 --> 05:22:49,049

6741
05:25:45,380 --> 05:25:52,459
you let me in like wouldn't it be so much better if you just had a homie hole uh yeah that's cool

6742
05:25:53,020 --> 05:25:57,419
you just have a hole opening up to the outside of your house no it has a flap like a dog door

6743
05:25:57,419 --> 05:26:01,340
that's fine but anybody can just go through it so that's fine and you and you wake up one morning

6744
05:26:01,340 --> 05:26:08,779
and like your ps5 is gone and so is your tv okay your like just open side of your house

6745
05:26:09,500 --> 05:26:18,340
is cool until um until the ps5 is gone you can't like lock that you you you couldn't lock it

6746
05:26:18,340 --> 05:26:24,659
you're talking about putting a bike lock on a ps5 no on the door flap there's no conceivable

6747
05:26:24,659 --> 05:26:33,669
way that you could prevent someone from crawling in from the outside I mean yeah it's called a door

6748
05:26:33,669 --> 05:26:41,209
with a lock on it the door has a lock on it and also you can like slide down a covering for the

6749
05:26:41,209 --> 05:26:49,080
homie hole like I'm not expecting any homies today so you lock you close it so why don't you

6750
05:26:49,080 --> 05:26:55,380
just have a door to your house I would have it open as often as possible would you have the

6751
05:26:55,380 --> 05:27:02,439
front door to your house open all day all day all day uh yeah okay well then never mind do you like

6752
05:27:02,439 --> 05:27:07,159
just not trust people you just failed that by the way let a real lock pick over here please

6753
05:27:07,159 --> 05:27:24,860
you're the lock pick guy so I backed up oh nice that's a nerd stick and what is that also can I

6754
05:27:24,860 --> 05:27:31,209
ask what is every game has these doors that look like they're like sliding doors that come down

6755
05:27:31,209 --> 05:27:38,759
that are like this is the locked line door yeah why because it's to convey that you cannot go

6756
05:27:38,759 --> 05:27:44,759
through here because there's nothing to open but these kinds of doors don't exist yeah they do

6757
05:27:44,759 --> 05:27:50,650
only in hotel rooms and then you get embarrassed taking a shit in that room because it actually

6758
05:27:50,650 --> 05:27:55,909
doesn't even close it's like sliding like a closet door closed and you're like I don't want

6759
05:27:55,909 --> 05:28:00,630
to take a shit in here I have no idea what you're talking about the only time I've ever seen a

6760

6827
05:42:03,979 --> 05:42:08,299
just made it a steal but this does remind me of my favorite scene ever from one of my favorite

6828
05:42:08,299 --> 05:42:16,650
shows of all time the crazy new adventures of I came first name I couldn't I tried to stall

6829
05:42:17,369 --> 05:42:24,630
what Sabrina the teenage witch he has the new show my favorite scene of all time in all television

6830
05:42:24,630 --> 05:42:33,849
ever is is what happened yes oh man she like she just acts like she's so incredible all the time

6831
05:42:33,849 --> 05:42:37,770
and she just walks into rooms and solves the problems instantly but there's one part of the

6832
05:42:37,770 --> 05:42:41,450
show where she walks into this room is like I'm here Sabrina's gonna stop and they just

6833
05:42:42,169 --> 05:42:46,169
instantly cut to her getting shot with the crossbow and like the people just don't listen to her

6834
05:42:46,169 --> 05:43:00,409
what that's kind of funny yeah it is it's very very comedic timing what the hell you are supposed

6835
05:43:00,409 --> 05:43:05,500
to launch off of it chat was right I thought they were bullshitting me yeah you have to jump off

6836
05:43:05,500 --> 05:43:17,000
of it is that in the Olympics pole vaulting oh if I okay if I type in like what do you say the show

6837
05:43:17,000 --> 05:43:24,540
is so then whatever the new Sabrina the teenage which is where she's like hip and edgy on Sabrina

6838
05:43:24,540 --> 05:43:32,360
the teenage witch crossbow maybe you'll find it I find it if you find it I it's one of those things

6839
05:43:32,360 --> 05:43:38,150
I like rewatched like 10 times in a row but it really helps when you have the buildup of like how

6840
05:43:38,150 --> 05:43:46,759
this has gone in her favor for like three seasons oh I can't I don't I can't find it I'll try and

6841
05:43:46,759 --> 05:43:51,000
find it one day if you can find it uh I'd love to see your favorite joke of all time

6842
05:43:53,220 --> 05:43:57,139
it's gonna yeah I build it up it's gonna be a huge letdown you know how the situation goes

6843
05:44:00,169 --> 05:44:06,650
I don't think so some I can't something about this game means that I can't click anything on

6844
05:44:06,650 --> 05:44:14,220
my other monitors even when they're active oh should I what's wrong with my body oh the chase

6845
05:44:14,220 --> 05:44:28,419
has died the fuck is this a zombie merchant what the fuck get off of me I'm hurry chat found it

6846
05:44:28,419 --> 05:44:32,259
yeah I'm sure they googled Sabrina crossbow and that's what I did I couldn't find it

6847
05:44:33,060 --> 05:44:38,979
I mean even you wouldn't know I'm really far away from you that's not one of those I'm dead

6848
05:44:41,259 --> 05:44:47,110
was seriously the same exact color scheme as all this shit it's blue and white and it was like look

6849
05:44:47,110 --> 05:44:53,270
blue and white on this plank of wood that was not my fault where are you that I'm dead over here

6850
05:44:53,990 --> 05:45:02,619
that really did look like it was one of those things oh you jumped and okay you're dead yeah

6851
05:45:02,619 --> 05:45:09,750
but it looked like it was one of those safe x thingies blue and white and we found it's the

6852
05:45:09,750 --> 05:45:21,610
first 30 seconds of this right here oh I think somebody's got it did I watch do we watch this on

6853
05:45:21,610 --> 05:45:29,619
stream yeah go for it so this is the funniest thing you've ever seen you said right not the

6854
05:45:29,619 --> 05:45:35,779
funniest thing is just my favorite thing from tv well okay that's not fair it's like my favorite

6855
05:45:35,779 --> 05:45:40,889
thing that I don't think was supposed to be funny I'm gonna add a whole bunch of qualifiers as I

6856
05:45:40,889 --> 05:45:46,439
remember that like always sunny exists and there's actually like funny tv shows hold on

6857

6858
05:45:56,229 --> 05:46:09,020

6859
05:46:09,020 --> 05:46:13,340
spoiler for a Sabrina the teenage witch and it probably is would you call this a spoiler

6860
05:46:13,340 --> 05:46:20,740
as long as you it's not a spoiler as long as you like stop watching after she gets shot

I mean that's not is that the funniest thing you've ever seen it's up there I didn't even

6864
05:47:15,110 --> 05:47:18,069
know that's what I didn't know what Sabrina even looked like I thought that was another character

6865
05:47:18,630 --> 05:47:30,919
and see look white blue white blue the thing that I jumped on was white blue all right are you

6866

6867
05:47:46,919 --> 05:47:52,040
like two seasons before that where she shows up and every problem is solved because she's Sabrina

6868
05:47:52,040 --> 05:47:57,720
is it literally just fucking get shot and died is it a good show you I guess you've watched

6869
05:47:57,720 --> 05:48:02,759
through two full seasons of the show is it good I've seen it all she um I think we're gonna get

6870
05:48:02,759 --> 05:48:14,330
married like is it is the show a good show I like can't say yes but I love how fucking

6871
05:48:14,330 --> 05:48:24,060
dumb it can be like I like love it as a basically video candidate pretty much like really I love

6872
05:48:24,060 --> 05:48:31,180
love it yeah really okay there's one episode that I don't even like describing it is is going to be

6873
05:48:31,180 --> 05:48:38,950
it's going to be too much we potentially see another basically on this uh show I have a

6874
05:48:38,950 --> 05:48:45,380
basically half made still oh I ever show it to you I think you did I need to finish that it's

6875
05:48:45,380 --> 05:48:52,279
a good one if I need to actually finish it yeah yeah it's been like a year of it being half done

6876
05:48:53,000 --> 05:49:04,119
all right so we're safe here yeah we're safe I'll get the honey and stuff out here it's everywhere

6877
05:49:07,159 --> 05:49:12,979
somebody has disturbed like anything unironically Diablo 2 Diablo 2 Bloodborne I love a lot of

6878
05:49:12,979 --> 05:49:16,180
things I just think it's boring to describe things you like you burger

6879
05:49:17,450 --> 05:49:21,849
yeah that's all right I'm not too into burgers anymore are you do you not let me ask you

6880
05:49:21,849 --> 05:49:25,290
something do you not like to talk about things you like because you don't want to seem like

6881
05:49:26,650 --> 05:49:30,490
like oh you don't want to like tell people how cool something is and then they don't like it

6882
05:49:31,130 --> 05:49:36,569
no I just legitimately think it's kind of boring and it's much more interesting to like analyze

6883
05:49:36,569 --> 05:49:41,450
things and like analyzing something you like is like no I like that it that's just that's all it

6884
05:49:41,450 --> 05:49:44,970
is that's like the whole conversation everyone's like oh you don't like any games all I ever hear

6885
05:49:44,970 --> 05:49:50,090
is you don't like this like slay the spire for me is like a 10 out of 10 brilliant game but I'm not

6886
05:49:50,090 --> 05:49:55,049
I don't like hey put the spear down put the spear down I get it why do I gotta put the spear down

6887
05:49:55,049 --> 05:50:05,500
use this you coming at me somebody said he wants rage clicks I'm getting them definitely

6888
05:50:05,500 --> 05:50:14,090
it's working for me no I think I can understand that in a way like okay I like this is like like

6889
05:50:14,090 --> 05:50:18,810
you like it right but then what more is there to say back in the day we could talk about like all

6890
05:50:18,810 --> 05:50:23,689
the weird shit within smite or I could go on for a long time about like overwatch is fucking weird

6891
05:50:23,689 --> 05:50:31,029
but like slay this bar it's just it's just a perfect great game just play it okay I mean I

6892
05:50:31,029 --> 05:50:37,209
played slay this bar good game right into this thing we can do this thing I'll do it oh my spear

6893
05:50:38,569 --> 05:50:44,409
um it was good I I kind of doing the math in my head kind of was hard and I was like

6894
05:50:44,729 --> 05:50:55,939
this is fun but it's not for me yeah math is like that I thought it was a good game though

6895
05:50:55,939 --> 05:50:59,990
it's definitely really cool you coming we're getting them let's go I think we're gonna try

6896
05:50:59,990 --> 05:51:21,529
to get them all right so we got a lot of explosives here a lot of explosives he jumped he's the

6897
05:51:21,529 --> 05:51:31,979
jumper I'm gonna throw an explosive I got him watch out kill him I throw that at you essentially

6898
05:51:31,979 --> 05:51:37,180
be careful oh we got a whole bunch of heads I don't know where they came from

6899
05:51:38,380 --> 05:51:41,979
but they're here hey

6900
05:51:47,659 --> 05:51:53,099
when it became like IGN game reviews were like that it's great and then like the reviews

6901
05:51:55,020 --> 05:52:05,979
this is no review yeah game was really fun we really liked it did that distract you

6902
05:52:08,229 --> 05:52:21,029
distract me trying to distract him oh all right he

6903
05:52:22,709 --> 05:52:39,220
I'm running around so much oh I posted them oh I'm gonna I'm about to throw a boomerang

6904
05:52:39,220 --> 05:52:46,869
all right talking about I'm out I'm out oh he did a bit of a jumpy

6905
05:52:47,830 --> 05:53:06,020
dad dad the only good said the dead said or old world wine bro played uh you played dark

6906
05:53:06,020 --> 05:53:12,790
messiah right I did yeah good game end of conversation all right but you you can

6907
05:53:12,790 --> 05:53:17,750
describe why something was good without just saying it was good I don't know if it's really

6908
05:53:17,750 --> 05:53:23,880
worth it because what if somebody's like well why do you say that okay what if somebody disagrees

6909
05:53:23,880 --> 05:53:29,159
with you that I don't think that game is good no no one disagrees with me like when when we

6910
05:53:29,159 --> 05:53:32,840
brought up like best games of all time Diablo 2 bloodborne like it's just not like we both just

6911
05:53:32,840 --> 05:53:37,479
agree it's very very obvious that we're both correct in this instance and same for dark messiah

6912
05:53:37,479 --> 05:53:42,979
well what if somebody said dark messiah that game sucks what would you say kind of a weird

6913
05:53:42,979 --> 05:53:47,220
opinion to just be like totally and completely wrong okay so they're gonna go why am I wrong

6914
05:53:47,220 --> 05:53:51,459
yes that's it's a bad game it's like stupid you fight orcs who cares like Peter Jackson did that

6915
05:53:51,459 --> 05:53:57,880
fucking hundred years ago I don't even know who Peter Jackson is like NATO do you like explain

6916
05:53:57,880 --> 05:54:03,049
why you like something we'll see that this this whole scenario like that doesn't bother me that

6917
05:54:03,049 --> 05:54:09,020
they don't like it you're like oh like oh what if I told you like I disagreed and I like don't like

6918
05:54:09,020 --> 05:54:18,389
like okay I'm upgrading my health someone comes up blood boy all that game fucking saw the souls

6919
05:54:18,389 --> 05:54:28,630
games the same all right I mean I could not wrong hmm interesting very interesting I think I want

6920
05:54:28,630 --> 05:54:38,459
to test this theory okay so if somebody told you that I don't like dark messiah and you are stupid

6921
05:54:38,459 --> 05:54:43,750
for liking it stupid like like you're you're an idiot like you like that game because you're dumb

6922
05:54:45,130 --> 05:54:51,770
now it becomes a personal attack do you defend yourself then no you don't I mean like that's

6923
05:54:51,770 --> 05:54:57,130
just such a fucking weird person where like the person is basing intelligence level of other

6924
05:54:57,130 --> 05:55:05,159
people on video game references and it's just a weirdo so you don't deny that you still like

6925
05:55:05,159 --> 05:55:11,479
surely I'm not I'm I am I could have a potential conversation about like oh yeah like I could tell

6926
05:55:11,479 --> 05:55:16,599
you why I like it but it's like I don't know it's not that's not an engaging conversation I'd rather

6927
05:55:16,599 --> 05:55:22,419
talk about something like engaging and divisive like Hillary's email like what's up with them

6928
05:55:23,450 --> 05:55:30,250
I don't know we're all just agreeing dark messiah is an amazing game

6929
05:55:33,080 --> 05:55:44,069
but yeah it is all right what do we need to turn in here that health upgrade was ass by the way

6930
05:55:46,090 --> 05:55:50,729
I oh I don't even know that I did it it's like plus one percent health it looks like I've just

6931
05:55:50,729 --> 05:55:59,900
been taking the stamina and even the stamina is not I guess I don't know I took this weird upgrade

6932
05:55:59,900 --> 05:56:03,979
and now if I press my sprint button I lose half of my stamina and I don't go any faster

6933
05:56:04,939 --> 05:56:12,360
oh that's right I got that too I'm not pressing sprint though did you get the the ledge launch

6934
05:56:12,360 --> 05:56:17,000
one that one's kind of ridiculous like he's forgetting to do it yeah me too you turn into

6935
05:56:17,000 --> 05:56:23,959
like spider-man you ever play prototype no actually I wanted to that's a really really

6936
05:56:23,959 --> 05:56:31,080
good game I tried to stream that game really yeah what happened the game ran like shit and

6937
05:56:31,080 --> 05:56:35,750
it was like all messed up the frame rate was fucked up everything on are you down

6938
05:56:36,970 --> 05:56:42,250
what did you play it on I think was pc who the fuck is this guy I don't want to be being chased

6939
05:56:42,250 --> 05:56:51,990
we gotta move I think they had it for sale on like playstation like a bundle of the old game

6940
05:56:52,869 --> 05:56:56,630
I tried to screen record it I tried to capture it but it was all messed up yeah people are saying

6941
05:56:57,349 --> 05:57:01,990
it doesn't work well on pc but there's a whole bunch of games I played in the last year I'm like

6942
05:57:02,709 --> 05:57:05,909
I'm not having fun this really feels like I should be playing prototype

6943
05:57:07,029 --> 05:57:15,909
I can see that I don't think I can make this jump

6944
05:57:18,709 --> 05:57:29,819
did you try I didn't realize there was an edge there almost just did it go off me get up get up

6945
05:57:33,049 --> 05:57:40,860
stir just maybe buy slay this bar on my phone good it's good get influenced maybe I should

6946
05:57:40,860 --> 05:57:44,779
tell people things I like more and then they buy them and then it didn't really matter

6947
05:57:45,580 --> 05:57:55,270
I want to lose place are you playing hearthstone still I saw you play it recently I tried when

6948
05:57:55,270 --> 05:58:03,860
they added like a new game mode thing to it not good I like watch people play battlegrounds on

6949
05:58:03,860 --> 05:58:08,659
the twitch tv if you've heard this twitch platform yeah I like playing and I'm I kind of really

6950
05:58:08,659 --> 05:58:14,340
don't care anymore and definitely not like standard I know I watch I watch I watch crypt too

6951
05:58:15,220 --> 05:58:20,090
I didn't say that's who you're talking about it's not who I was talking about

6952
05:58:20,090 --> 05:58:32,939
are you kidding me okay crip the poe streamer I'm shocked I'm shocked that you're not watching

6953
05:58:32,939 --> 05:58:37,580
preparing instead like for hearthstone I legitimately don't I mean like sometimes

6954
05:58:37,580 --> 05:58:42,619
but I don't stay up that late at night okay all right all right all right good good answer

6955
05:58:42,619 --> 05:58:49,340
you're safe I can't get in this fucking window I'm so pissed oh my god get in the window

6956
05:58:52,619 --> 05:59:09,400
why won't go in the window what's happening pretending right no I'm not pretending I can't

6957
05:59:09,400 --> 05:59:13,819
go in you can't get in the homie hole okay there you go oh we got a nighttime bonus

6958
05:59:21,590 --> 05:59:31,380
so exhausting pretending this much all right cool you made it I need to craft some stuff give me a

6959
05:59:31,380 --> 05:59:43,400
sec can you make these regeneration boosters that seems kind of I wonder what a small amount of

6960
05:59:43,400 --> 05:59:58,419
health is already maybe it's not worth doing already two percent per second hmm I'm gonna

6961
05:59:58,419 --> 06:00:10,259
go with what I know because I did upgrade these I could do one I'll get a few all tough yep

6962
06:00:10,979 --> 06:00:27,500
120 percent total how is that a small amount of health wait wait two percent okay this is a 60

6963
06:00:27,500 --> 06:00:34,439
second duration and it regens two percent health per second so it regens 120 percent of your health

6964
06:00:35,000 --> 06:00:45,349
how is that a small amount of health I don't know I didn't make it I didn't I don't know who who

6965
06:00:45,349 --> 06:00:57,080
are you I got a combat skill so kind of cool about that gets smaller over two percent is small

6966
06:00:58,619 --> 06:01:07,509
you know how percentages work it regens two percent of your health every second and it

6967
06:01:07,509 --> 06:01:26,340
lasts for 60 seconds am I how am I reading this wrong two percent gets smaller every time

6968
06:01:27,700 --> 06:01:31,459
oh because it's two percent of the current health that you're missing

6969
06:01:39,750 --> 06:01:42,950
yeah and two percent is this small you dunce you don't have to go be dunce

6970
06:01:43,590 --> 06:01:47,349
you can just say not I'm not talking yeah I'm not talking to you I did not I did not

6971
06:01:48,150 --> 06:01:55,380
all right you ready ready for what I got I got a bunch of mollusks super all over who won

6972
06:01:56,020 --> 06:02:22,330
we're going this way we're going this way 200 oh my god why what the cost of stamina from things

6973
06:02:22,330 --> 06:02:29,779
is really weird like exiting that pole ate all my stamina but holding on to the pole

6974
06:02:29,779 --> 06:02:38,060
probably gets better over time yeah I bet

6975
06:02:42,840 --> 06:02:48,299
so where are we heading now just to the marker I think we go in here and we tell the guys that

6976
06:02:48,299 --> 06:02:51,659
we're like cool and people are saying like these are the questions you want to do for these guys

6977
06:02:51,659 --> 06:03:00,459
and like we're doing them oh my god favorite hearthstone card favorite hearthstone card

6978
06:03:04,389 --> 06:03:13,580
for real no okay just passing the time I like like test gray main

6979
06:03:18,500 --> 06:03:23,770
somebody said I keep spacing out good you were right drink some water is a trap

6980
06:03:23,770 --> 06:03:28,490
and it looks like you were getting close to the truth eat a banana either they killed lucas

6981
06:03:29,209 --> 06:03:36,090
or they know who did will force so you'll take all right I'm gonna laugh if he was just dead in

6982
06:03:36,090 --> 06:03:43,909
your arms that does seem to happen at the end of those I think we got an item take over that

6983
06:03:43,990 --> 06:03:50,380
yeah we got like a hammer thanks thanks for killing that like hundred people you've killed

6984
06:03:50,380 --> 06:03:55,130
here's a hammer to do it some more scrapper is that what we just got this thing is terrible

6985
06:03:55,770 --> 06:04:02,220
yeah it was like a level one because we're still in the tutorial even though I this game's pacing is

6986
06:04:02,220 --> 06:04:12,360
bizarre are we just slow we're definitely slow yeah but we also definitely had to play for like

6987
06:04:12,360 --> 06:04:20,970
40 minutes to even start the stream that's true and we were not pausing for McDonald's orders

6988
06:04:20,970 --> 06:04:26,889
during that 45 to 50 minute I just I speed ran my heart out and it was still kind of like well

6989
06:04:26,889 --> 06:04:32,650
it wasn't slow it was fine it was a good intro but now it's like introing again that you're in the

6990
06:04:32,650 --> 06:04:39,180
city it's like going over the same stuff that's a little bit like you know like you know it kind

6991
06:04:39,180 --> 06:04:48,180
of grinds my gears you know you're gonna get your 60 dollars worth hey then looks like the bandits

6992
06:04:48,180 --> 06:04:55,139
fled the water tower who wants to take control and force the bizarre folk to talk you just started

6993
06:04:55,139 --> 06:05:01,380
running yeah you were just gone I thought you were following me honestly but watch out I was

6994
06:05:01,380 --> 06:05:06,020
kind of in my inventory I'm picking up all the lavender I'm getting some honey from these bees

6995
06:05:06,020 --> 06:05:10,180
I'm making I'm not even worried about getting stung bees are no problem for me I'm gonna pick

6996
06:05:10,180 --> 06:05:14,520
up uh these shrooms doing a little bit of live commentary right now I'm picking up gonna search

6997
06:05:14,520 --> 06:05:23,270
this guy the true question is which came first ranch or cool ranch ranch because then that

6998
06:05:23,270 --> 06:05:45,349
everything spun off of that we got a whole bunch of blues over here that I'm finding some blues

6999
06:05:46,069 --> 06:05:52,200
cool ranch always sounds like so odd to me I whenever I hear cool ranch for some reason I

7000
06:05:52,200 --> 06:06:00,139
think that it's got like free on in it I don't know what I'm doing he's just bouncing around

7001
06:06:02,700 --> 06:06:07,659
well you get like the the chain kick combo where you parry someone then you stun the next guy

7002
06:06:08,950 --> 06:06:32,090
but it's very awkward oh no bandits can I craft something new

7003
06:06:36,009 --> 06:06:42,310
um oh we're going this way come on we ever play the car dlc from dying light one

7004
06:06:42,950 --> 06:06:47,509
I don't think so we I tried to play some of it on my own but we did not play it

7005
06:06:54,490 --> 06:07:04,700
secret over there uh any secrets over here I really just can't I can't get over how good

7006
06:07:04,700 --> 06:07:14,389
this game looks and how I can't get over it I always turn all this shit off when I play these

7007
06:07:14,389 --> 06:07:21,319
games I go to the check boxes and I turn off bloom refractoring lighting shadows like I turn it all

7008
06:07:21,319 --> 06:07:26,439
off I'll see you got like a monster rig man what are those what are those specs tell me about your

7009
06:07:26,439 --> 06:07:31,159
monster fucking rig man all right I think crack my fingers here all right you want to hear

7010
06:07:31,880 --> 06:07:40,819
yeah let's get all right so my rig what happened we just explode what did you do

7011
06:07:42,900 --> 06:07:57,290
should we respond to the last story point yeah what happened I uh you see this giant pile of

7012
06:07:57,290 --> 06:08:08,040
explosives yeah I swung I swung on it oh what does it do what does it do he asked I wanted

7013
06:08:08,040 --> 06:08:13,770
to see the funny thing too on my screen I never actually hit it like the swing never finished I

7014
06:08:13,770 --> 06:08:21,209
was like oh do I gotta do this dude you gotta do this they're gonna blow it up that's like kind

7015
06:08:21,209 --> 06:08:26,169
of realistic though isn't it like we wouldn't see the explosion we just gone oh yeah I didn't like

7016
06:08:26,169 --> 06:08:40,500
the Sopranos ending don't talk about spoilers who hasn't seen the Sopranos that cares because if you

7017
06:08:40,500 --> 06:08:47,139
exploded like that it would just be like gone it wouldn't be like boom oh my explosion oh final

7018
06:08:47,139 --> 06:08:52,180
scene of Sopranos when he walks up to the fucking the propane tank and he punches it and it just

7019
06:08:52,180 --> 06:09:09,159
ends this is really weird hold on that was really funny

7020
06:09:14,549 --> 06:09:18,549
I just see Tony Soprano like at the end of the movie at the end of the show just being like it's

7021
06:09:18,549 --> 06:09:26,619
fucking stupid fuck you fuck this you fucking boom it's over credits fucking propane oh you

7022
06:09:26,619 --> 06:09:31,959
don't think I fuck what you think you're funny fucking propane I honestly if I'm in control of

7023
06:09:31,959 --> 06:09:38,119
any production or anything ever like that's how it's gonna end oh like that dumb my fucking head

7024
06:09:38,119 --> 06:09:46,889
how could you resist ending it with the person like punching a propane tank yeah like just like

7025
06:09:47,930 --> 06:09:58,860
sometimes shit happens oh okay not everything in life is like planned in a script room you know

7026
06:09:58,860 --> 06:10:18,169
sometimes I got something to fucking tell you oh fuck you oh come on it didn't happen

7027
06:10:18,169 --> 06:10:24,619
immediately yeah that's like the like you can see me do it but when you do it yourself it kind of

7028
06:10:24,619 --> 06:10:34,229
stops early it does all right all right all right all right all right stop it it says quest failed

7029
06:10:34,229 --> 06:10:43,880
on the credits oh we got to do this again you can't let that happen look at the fucking slime

7030
06:10:43,880 --> 06:10:48,360
guy he's been in the fucking line he's fucking got a fuck I gotta shoot fucking snot out of his fucking

7031
06:10:48,360 --> 06:10:55,290
mouth where's the rest of it where's the rest oh I think it's more find and disarm the explosives

7032
06:10:55,290 --> 06:11:05,290
oh yeah there's a whole like there's a whole secret route up here any secrets over here oh yeah

7033
06:11:05,290 --> 06:11:13,450
there's secrets up here I just keep thinking of like Tony Soprano's got like a gun in his hand

7034
06:11:14,409 --> 06:11:19,450
it's like three or four other characters and they're all just arguing now that you think that

7035
06:11:19,450 --> 06:11:29,139
that's funny mm-hmm that's Sabrina clip is that for me that's all right I get it because there's

7036
06:11:29,139 --> 06:11:33,860
so much build up and there's so there's no reason for her to just suddenly get shot by a crossbow

7037
06:11:33,860 --> 06:11:41,000
in the show to end so like in that my head cannon shows over there where's this other bomb I think

7038
06:11:41,000 --> 06:11:44,919
we gotta there's some we gotta climb up here we're gonna go in here and bombs in here don't swing on

7039
06:11:44,919 --> 06:11:56,150
these don't swing on we're gonna have to climb again I'm not I'm not swinging get it yeah there's

7040
06:11:56,150 --> 06:12:07,830
more we need to go we need to do uppies I think from here yeah inside what is this place why does

7041
06:12:07,830 --> 06:12:13,990
anyone care if it explodes I don't know it's an important building of some kind the water tower

7042
06:12:13,990 --> 06:12:23,819
maybe where did you go how did you get up there inside the building they're in this room arguing

7043
06:12:23,900 --> 06:12:40,650
Tony Sopranos in here jack shut the fuck up you fucking idiot someone's gonna punch it all right

7044
06:12:40,650 --> 06:12:48,979
I got it oh yeah it was a water tower I don't know why everyone's like worried about water most

7045
06:12:48,979 --> 06:12:56,250
abundant resource and they're like oh I'm to the top of the water tower I'm doing yeah we're doing

7046
06:12:56,250 --> 06:13:21,669
some climbing I think I think you're right what the hell is that that just reminded me of do you

7050
06:13:42,139 --> 06:13:49,500
things that you've seen which is a Sabrina thing they did this bit where it was like the Sopranos

7051
06:13:49,500 --> 06:13:54,540

7091
06:19:23,340 --> 06:19:35,779
wearing leather jackets into the sides of the room immediately that's a walkie-talkie that's

7092
06:19:35,779 --> 06:20:09,880
not detonator oh do my mouth get to the edges of the room did we get him you got him how what

7093
06:20:10,700 --> 06:20:38,840

7094
06:20:40,360 --> 06:20:41,240

06:20:52,310 --> 06:21:05,240
oh my god what oh why did you why did you do that I don't know he was dead turn the water back on

7096
06:21:09,479 --> 06:21:15,020
he was already dead man it really was so stupid though back when movies would air on tv on

7097
06:21:15,020 --> 06:21:20,779
network tv when you know netflix hb all this nobody that doesn't exist it was they would put

7098
06:21:20,779 --> 06:21:26,220
the stupidest shit in the play in place of swears they would really do this oh yeah I forgot they

7099
06:21:26,220 --> 06:21:31,180
actually would like change the words rather than believe it's control of the water and it would be

7100
06:21:31,180 --> 06:21:40,020
the actor would do it forgot yeah they were man how did I like miss the whole joke that's true

7101
06:21:40,020 --> 06:21:44,099
it'd be like you are out of your flooping mind the stuff that nobody would ever say

7102
06:21:45,659 --> 06:21:53,529
they would really do that it made no sense oh we get like a choice you seeing this yeah there's

7103
06:21:53,529 --> 06:22:01,110
either car traps or ziplines I want ziplines like who cares about a car trap yeah we ziplines for

7104
06:22:01,110 --> 06:22:20,569
sure I just want to go I'm voting zipline yeah I vote it we did it peacekeeper bow is the best

7105
06:22:20,569 --> 06:22:26,630
weapon in the whole game yeah so how did how did we go from like needing to find our girlfriend to

7106
06:22:27,110 --> 06:22:32,020
saving villages I don't know maybe that always happened maybe we should play the game and find

7107
06:22:32,020 --> 06:22:38,220
up okay you should uh not skip every single dialogue piece I mean I can't skip this for

7108
06:22:38,220 --> 06:22:42,860
some reason I've had it with these monkey fighting snakes on this monday to friday plane

7109
06:22:43,580 --> 06:22:59,319
yeah that's the class that's a classic one okay city alignment we're playing planet side yeah okay

7110
06:22:59,319 --> 06:23:13,459
city alignment tool yeah my city is aligning all right oh there's like a whole other area

7111
06:23:13,459 --> 06:23:17,779
you know there's like a whole other area in this game yeah we've been we've been hitting on darn

7112
06:23:17,779 --> 06:23:23,770
asses for the last six hours and six and a half hours dude there's like a whole downtown there's

7113
06:23:23,770 --> 06:23:34,549
the wharf very cool hey then where the fuck are you barney you trying to capture him jack and joe

7114
06:23:34,549 --> 06:23:41,610
warned him he could have avoided the trap but he went into it anyway that's when maybe we should

7115
06:23:41,610 --> 06:23:48,090
are you doing all right I'll make sure the place is safe are you are you worried about me

7116
06:23:48,090 --> 06:23:55,099
uh you want to but like half an hour 30 minutes uh yeah now that we unlocked the new area I think

7117
06:23:55,099 --> 06:23:59,220
that's about it for me I mean we've been playing for almost six and a half hours

7118
06:23:59,939 --> 06:24:03,939
you know I would be good honestly though you good I don't know if you want to play again or what but

7119
06:24:03,939 --> 06:24:09,939
okay it just seems like a funny spot to end but you're like yeah we've been playing like all day

7120
06:24:09,939 --> 06:24:19,720
yeah I wouldn't mind okay have you gone to a thousand points now uh I feel like I would have

7121
06:24:19,720 --> 06:24:25,479
to see the new area I'm at like 950 I feel like okay I don't I don't feel like the game has too

7122
06:24:25,479 --> 06:24:30,040
many surprises left will you start getting grappling hooks and your wing-a-dings and maybe

7123
06:24:30,040 --> 06:24:36,970
yep I think it's like it's like most games these days it's front-loaded with so much

7124
06:24:36,970 --> 06:24:40,650
bullshit even if the rest of it is fun and it's hard to recommend to anyone you're like oh yeah

7125
06:24:41,369 --> 06:24:46,090
if you watch like the first season like season two is pretty good skip three yeah and then like like

7126
06:24:46,090 --> 06:24:54,889
four is all right yeah that does tend to happen nowadays yeah I think it's good I felt that way

7127
06:24:54,889 --> 06:25:00,180
about dying light one though too that if if you just had all your stuff unlocked and it really

7128
06:25:00,180 --> 06:25:07,029
was like sandbox world the game probably would have been a lot more fun I could see that I will

7129
06:25:07,029 --> 06:25:18,650
say I give it a I give it like a 9.8 be like a 9.8 and a half that's very high does your scale

7130
06:25:18,650 --> 06:25:21,849
will go up to like 20 or I was just waiting for you to be like you're a fucking idiot so then I

7131
06:25:21,849 --> 06:25:26,490
could prove to you that I could prove to you the point you made earlier that like no because I

7132
06:25:26,490 --> 06:25:31,209
know that you're joking yeah I was waiting for you to call me dumb is this really okay like

7133
06:25:31,209 --> 06:25:38,490
bloodborne's a 10 this is a 9.8 no this is a solid this is a solid game I'm doing a jump joke are

7134
06:25:38,490 --> 06:25:56,119
you let me see other players are waiting for you where are you oh you're here all right yeah maybe

7135
06:25:56,119 --> 06:26:01,450
I mean if you want to play it again we could obviously play again if you wanted to how do you

7136
06:26:01,450 --> 06:26:10,200
feel how are you what's your schedule like stir oh my schedule is uh panic panic stress uh saturday

7137
06:26:10,200 --> 06:26:16,840
myriad wipe my wipe my brow uh which by the way right panic panic that's in the middle of it

7138
06:26:16,840 --> 06:26:22,680
episode four just happened right yeah yeah what is the what is the myriad by the way

7139
06:26:22,680 --> 06:26:29,479
curious oh I mean the myriad is uh basically like a dnd campaign that I run every week on my

7140
06:26:29,479 --> 06:26:33,560
channel on saturdays we've got a couple of fun uh gamer streamers and in the future germa is

7141
06:26:33,560 --> 06:26:37,080
going to be a part of it uh because it's a whole system I programmed and you don't you you can

7142
06:26:37,080 --> 06:26:42,200
have streamer brain rot and play it because it's all automated and I am I am the dungeon

7143
06:26:42,680 --> 06:26:51,180
production man of the show right and where can we find you on twitch.tv slash stir anywhere

7144
06:26:51,180 --> 06:26:59,299
any more that's s t e r I feel like I'm I'm killing this yes s t e r yeah it's dnd without

7145
06:26:59,299 --> 06:27:07,340
the dnd that it's dnd without like all the stuff that makes dnd slow yeah yeah pretty cool I think

7146
06:27:07,340 --> 06:27:11,659
it's a really cool thing all right you can just wait till germa plays it because one day he's

7147
06:27:11,659 --> 06:27:19,159
gonna play it one day yeah whenever we decide to do that uh but yeah indeed uh if you if you

7148
06:27:19,159 --> 06:27:22,659
actually do want to play this again at some point like this week or whatever let me know

7149
06:27:24,700 --> 06:27:32,279
we can get to the non-tutorial island well what's what's your schedule like I was gonna do like

7150
06:27:32,279 --> 06:27:39,259
some just chatting stuff but tomorrow's valentine's day and I want to spend it with my girlfriend so

7151
06:27:40,220 --> 06:27:48,360
um I was thinking about I don't know maybe like do you want to play on like Wednesday

7152
06:27:48,360 --> 06:27:53,560
uh I mean I was just curious your general overall I mean I'd even be like like like if I was like

7153
06:27:53,560 --> 06:27:57,560
hey like what about this other game we're like oh cool new thing then we do we do the new thing

7154
06:27:57,560 --> 06:28:02,860
um I would say I mean Wednesday I was probably going to stream like IRL just like just chatting

7155
06:28:02,860 --> 06:28:11,529
for like an hour or two okay we'll figure it out we can play on Wednesday sounds good thanks for

7156
06:28:11,529 --> 06:28:16,250
playing stir appreciate it okay yeah yeah take care and uh you know um yeah bye and we'll see

7157
06:28:16,250 --> 06:28:25,619
we'll see on probably Wednesday all right all right it's a date uh I will see you guys but

7158
06:28:25,619 --> 06:28:32,020
we'll do it on Wednesday seems like a good time to do it let me try to gift 100 community subs again

7159
06:28:32,020 --> 06:28:38,229
for like the 10th time uh let's see I'm gonna run the credits thanks for watching everybody

7160
06:28:38,229 --> 06:28:45,290
I don't want to go too too late here into eastern time I wonder if my cards are gonna get declined

7161
06:28:45,290 --> 06:28:53,459
again yeah on Wednesday we'll I was gonna do two days in a row but that it's valentine's day I

7162
06:28:53,459 --> 06:29:05,900
want to spend it with Oli so I'm gonna spend it with Oli I'm gonna have a plan it's gonna be fun

7163
06:29:05,900 --> 06:29:17,220
aced yeah we'll uh me and stir will play probably again on Wednesday we'll do the

7164
06:29:17,220 --> 06:29:22,900
browser game stuff on Wednesday too because I honestly I'll be really honest I don't think

7165
06:29:22,900 --> 06:29:32,180
I would be playing this on stream for like another like eight hours so oh the game master he is a

7166
06:29:32,180 --> 06:29:41,029
game master see he proved it right there game master has disconnected you and you're gonna

7167
06:29:41,029 --> 06:29:51,930
return to your game uh a couple things I do want to talk about real quick today is the last day

7168
06:29:53,430 --> 06:30:01,060
for you to nominate people for the streamer awards it ends I believe tonight at midnight so

7169
06:30:01,060 --> 06:30:08,389
if you had I was gonna take it on stream but I looked at the list and I realized that I don't

7170
06:30:08,389 --> 06:30:14,229
think I would reliably be able to answer too many of these just because I don't really watch a ton

7171
06:30:14,229 --> 06:30:28,810
of like some of the content that's here yeah I'll link it hold on it is alone it is the streamer

7172
06:30:28,810 --> 06:30:39,740
awards.com here it is there are a shitload of categories you guys know uh cutie cinderella

7173
06:30:39,740 --> 06:30:47,639
and maya they are running this there's a ton of people involved um it seems like a pretty cool

7174
06:30:47,639 --> 06:30:56,549
idea it's sort of like a twitch awards show uh if I could give you the ones I've if you want

7175
06:30:56,549 --> 06:31:01,159
me to do some nominations here I could probably give you some if I'm scrolling down the list but

7176
06:31:01,159 --> 06:31:05,400
like stuff like league streamer roleplay streamer battle royale streamer I don't really watch too

7177
06:31:05,400 --> 06:31:17,259
much of that uh so I don't really know but let's see here I'll give you some some examples the

7178
06:31:18,060 --> 06:31:33,830
did it no it didn't did it it should be until midnight right it's ended it didn't it did it

7179
06:31:33,830 --> 06:31:44,900
did it oh shit did I miss it I don't know it doesn't I can I can see it still you don't have

7180
06:31:44,900 --> 06:31:54,520
to enter a name for each yeah you can you can skip categories it says February 13th they end yeah

7181
06:31:54,520 --> 06:32:03,270
tonight it yeah today tonight at midnight that's what I said but yeah let me go through some of

7182
06:32:03,270 --> 06:32:07,909
these real quick I'll give you some of my opinions I mean uh I'll start with I guess vtuber streamer

7183
06:32:07,909 --> 06:32:20,819
that's that's I'm gonna say neanderth I don't really know that many other vtuber streamers if

7184
06:32:20,819 --> 06:32:30,069
I would keep going uh uh best like smash brothers I don't really know sports game I don't really know

7185
06:32:30,069 --> 06:32:36,409
I don't really know who else best okay best variety streamer I would say lidwig

7186
06:32:36,409 --> 06:32:46,939
lidwig absolutely is best variety streamer of the year without a doubt best streamed event I would

7187
06:32:46,939 --> 06:32:56,310
say you know you know whatever whatever I don't know you know there's things that happened this

7188
06:32:56,310 --> 06:33:07,689
year or it's supposed to be 2021 so stream game of the year is what would be a stream game of the

7189
06:33:07,689 --> 06:33:22,979
year stream game of the year because this is all across all of shit you can't hold on this across

7190
06:33:22,979 --> 06:33:31,909
all the platforms right because it's not just like oh a game that I played on my channel it's

7191
06:33:31,909 --> 06:33:39,450
like just across all of twitch all of youtube everywhere I mean I among us I would probably

7192
06:33:39,450 --> 06:33:44,409
say I mean that's like one of the biggest things that happened last year right I mean I didn't play

7193
06:33:44,409 --> 06:33:54,580
it I don't know it's my vote yeah it is it is I don't know I would probably say among us even

7194
06:33:54,580 --> 06:34:01,959
though I don't even like play it best content organization esports or content organization

7195
06:34:01,959 --> 06:34:09,110
that has created the best content during the past year but I think I probably put the production

7196
06:34:09,110 --> 06:34:17,220
company that I've worked with every time community jakes company what I was gonna put

7197
06:34:20,659 --> 06:34:26,169
is that I don't know if that's like an esport like content organization that has created the

7198
06:34:26,169 --> 06:34:34,150
best content if that fits I mean I don't know if it does but that's jk productions I don't know if

7199
06:34:34,150 --> 06:34:48,150
that's accurate but uh if I keep going I don't know I can't some of these it's hard like rising

7200
06:34:48,150 --> 06:34:57,700
star award for instance I'd like who's like somebody that I didn't really notice before but

7201
06:34:57,700 --> 06:35:14,439
they're like really kind of blown up um it's hard to put somebody here because are we talking brand

7202
06:35:14,439 --> 06:35:18,680
up-and-coming streamer that's had tremendous growth over the past year and has the potential

7203
06:35:18,680 --> 06:35:27,110
to be a top streamer I mean I I would say I mean Connor's been pretty popular for a while though

7204
06:35:29,180 --> 06:35:35,419
maybe like atriarch but he's been popular too for a while how popular are they gonna be

7205
06:35:38,700 --> 06:35:56,939
is popular is popular like five to ten like I don't know I'm not sure because all the people

7206
06:35:56,939 --> 06:36:01,580
that I would put in this list are already pretty popular like they already have like a large

7207
06:36:01,580 --> 06:36:11,799
following I don't know I don't know who would put their legacy award a legend who's contributed

7208
06:36:11,799 --> 06:36:18,009
a great deal and has shaped the industry career achievement award I don't know I don't know who

7209
06:36:18,009 --> 06:36:29,430
would even say for them gamer of the year I gotta give that to xqc are you serious streamer that

7210
06:36:29,430 --> 06:36:37,180
has extraordinary gaming abilities and as excelled at games over the past year and then streamer of

7211
06:36:37,180 --> 06:36:49,419
the year streamer of the year I mean I think you gotta I think I have to nominate Ludwig for this

7212
06:36:50,740 --> 06:36:57,139
I think Ludwig did a ton of shit he did so many things he I think he's probably one of the

7213
06:36:57,860 --> 06:37:06,299
few people that is doing interesting content on every platform yeah but I'm not gonna vote

7214
06:37:06,299 --> 06:37:10,779
for myself I don't I'm not gonna go into the presidential booth and be like that's right

7215
06:37:10,779 --> 06:37:17,720
that's me oh I'm giving you my opinions right this is not just for twitch this is for everywhere

7216
06:37:18,439 --> 06:37:29,139
this is youtube this is twitch this is facebook I don't know residents do do that though yeah but

7217
06:37:29,139 --> 06:37:40,979
if I'm if I'm not talking about like being an ego Andy I would say probably Ludwig that's what

7218
06:37:40,979 --> 06:37:56,759
I would say he's done a lot of stuff yeah he's also done a lot of stuff for this channel I mean

7219
06:37:57,880 --> 06:38:05,130
a lot of things uh I got a lot of help from him over the last year or two for tons of different

7220
06:38:05,130 --> 06:38:17,240
things so he's a he he's a really really great dude and I really do genuinely think that like

7221
06:38:17,319 --> 06:38:23,799
he does interesting stuff either that or I'm gonna put xqc like I'm just gonna put xqc here

7222
06:38:23,799 --> 06:38:33,860
if it's not Ludwig that's what I'm gonna do also like league of their own the streamer is a pioneer

7223
06:38:33,860 --> 06:38:37,139
that creates one-of-a-kind content with their creativity out of the box thinking they're a

7224
06:38:37,139 --> 06:38:41,060
trailblazer in the streaming industry someone who relies on themselves for their content and

7225
06:38:41,060 --> 06:38:49,139
genuinely is in a league of their own I mean I would probably put xqc here too like xqc just

7226
06:38:49,139 --> 06:38:53,779
does his own shit he doesn't like rely on anything or anybody else he kind of just does his thing he's

7227
06:38:53,779 --> 06:39:00,169
in his own lane yeah but I'm not we're not talking about me right now we're not talking

7228
06:39:00,169 --> 06:39:08,759
about me you can vote for whoever you want and that's cool all right okay you can vote

7229
06:39:08,759 --> 06:39:15,419
wherever you want but I'm just okay I'm taking myself out of the equation I can't what am I

7230
06:39:15,419 --> 06:39:21,099
gonna be here be like oh let me tell you how I think about me I belong here I belong here I

7231
06:39:21,099 --> 06:39:36,009
belong here I belong here yeah best valorant streamer that's me baby yep uh yeah I think I

7232
06:39:36,009 --> 06:39:45,139
think that's accurate I'm gonna say Ludwig I think that's accurate all the others it's hard

7233
06:39:45,139 --> 06:39:55,720
for me to do because I don't watch too many streamers we're the oldest juicer couple oh god

7234
