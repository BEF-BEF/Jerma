1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:11,109
Oh, you're in big trouble. You're in big trouble. Wow.

2
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:29,179
The sea is still this morning. The fresh pine scent fills the air, and the shining sun beats down on

3
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:35,369
the newly crafted pyro shark nest. She will need to be careful though, for predators lurk around

4
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:41,820
every corner. The winter months are always the most difficult for pyro sharks, so the summer sun

5
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:51,109
gives them plenty of time for the necessary hunt. The food is scarce, and the coming months will be

6
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:58,390
grueling, but the incredibly strong will and sheer cunning of this young female might just help this

7
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:21,219
endangered beast to another spring. Our first journey begins in Lakeside. This small, quaint

8
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:30,019
pool houses quite a large surprise. Weighing in at over 12,000 pounds, the pool room pyro

9
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:37,400
shark is a wonder to behold. The graceful swimming technique known as unguntu has been passed down

10
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:44,230
from generation to generation. Now, as one could probably imagine, this particular breed likes to

11
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:51,370
be alone and does not take kindly to would-be encroaches. This pool is not big enough to house

12
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:58,980
more than one pyro shark, unless of course, he happens to be mating. Unfortunately, most

13
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:06,700
pool room pyro sharks do not make it out of this pool because of their own laziness. Frequent sniper

14
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:18,759
and spy attacks kill most of them. Hopefully, the others will survive. Welcome to the shock tank.

15
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:25,620
Oh, you didn't think that there was a shock tank in Lakeside? Well,

16
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:37,300
I mean, there is now. Here we go. I think I see some prey. You're just drowning. Get out of here,

17
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:47,099
sharks. These are sharkless waters. Got him. Got him. Swarmed him. These are sharkless waters.

18
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:53,740
I need the help. Oh, there's a lot. There's a bunch of people. There's a bunch of people.

19
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:01,689
Come on. Somebody jump in here. No, no. I'm getting shot at. Jerma, Jerma, Jerma. No, don't die. No.

20
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:11,719
You're my shark brother. So, how is our lovely two-foot swamp pyro shark doing, you ask?

21
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:20,710
As happy as can be. It is a lovely day and the forecast calls for clear skies and calm water.

22
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:26,389
Striking with ferocity and quickness is all in the pyro shark's repertoire. And their favorite

23
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:33,530
food source is the scoot. The scoot is so full of tender meat and morsels dripping with bone marrow,

24
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:40,060
it is the pyro shark's favorite. Next to, of course, probably his fin. The two-foot

25
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,280
swamp shark only lives to be about four years old. Time is of the essence. Spy checking,

26
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,610
food gathering, and territorial guarding need to be done quickly. They will spend most of their

27
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:59,430
few days in these sewers, so they need to spend them wisely. And what's this? A wild skilt showing

28
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,580
himself to our young little friend? This could mean more rations during the winter. Be careful,

29
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:12,099
young shark. The skilt is known to be a fast runner and could lead you into a trap. This skilt

30
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:18,040
seems to want to lead our little friend out of the water, which is very, very dangerous indeed.

31
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:25,720
Pyro sharks have trouble breathing outside the swamp, so another time, another day. Now,

32
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:33,259
this is a treat indeed. It's not often we get to see the sawmill pyro shark. We caught this one

33
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:41,699
during its bathing hour, drinking up the cool, crisp water, cleansing his sun-battered skin.

34
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,740
Sawmill sharks are a quiet breed, although highly aggressive. Their main source of food

35
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:54,089
is the solly bird. Solly birds fly from peak to peak in search of their favorite health pack snack.

36
00:04:54,089 --> 00:05:00,649
The sawmill shark knows this and uses deceit and cunning to lay a goo-covered sticky trap in place

37
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:07,689
of the bird's favorite meal. Once the bird is consumed, it's back to the bath. And to spend

38
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:16,329
the rest of the day in relaxation. And before we go, do you remember that little skilt that

39
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:21,579
was giving our two-foot pyro sharks some trouble? Well, if there's one thing you need to know about

40
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:34,660
the pyro shark, it's very simple. They always get their kill. Always. So it seems this pyro shark

41
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:42,730
will continue on through the spring and pass her lineage down another generation. Take care,

42
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,730
everybody. Good night.
