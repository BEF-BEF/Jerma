Is this one in any position one in any position? Okay. All right, wait 10 seconds. I hope I hope I did this right

324
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:08,680
What's your favorite piece?

00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,160
All right now

326
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,119
We have there. Okay. We got we got more symbols

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,839
Okay, okay. That's fine. That's fine. We can do symbols. Okay, we've got uh backwards p smiley face of the tongue sticking out

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:51,769
Uh weird tb weird tb got it. Yes, and then yes the last one. Okay, cool final module. We have plenty of time

333
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:54,490
So don't worry. Just relax. Okay. Okay. It's another wire module

334
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,509
We have one two, three four. There are five wires

335
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,569
Two of those wires are yellow

336
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,809
Two of those wires are red. One of them is white two yellow

337
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:10,170
Two red one white there are five of them

338
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:18,839
Um, is there any black wires here? There are no black wires and we have a total of five here

339
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,799
There are five wires two yellow two red one white cut the first wire

340
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:33,619
That was incorrect. Um, we're even them real quick again. I got really stressed. I'm sorry. All right, two yellow two red

341
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:40,859
One white there are five two yellow wires there are two red wires one white wire

342
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:44,380
That's it cut the second wire my bad my bad. We got it. Look at that

343
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,420
I I started freaking out like here come here comes the

344
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,900
The the the bomb demons in my head like come on dude. Just tell them anyway. I'm like no we have to commit to this

345
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,460
All right. I I think we're doing all right. We're doing all right. We're doing all right

346
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:07,099
But that's because I disciplined myself before the stream and I said, okay, maybe maybe I shouldn't be devolving the streaming too. It's like, uh,

347
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:11,539
Making fun of uh, jerma's lack of Greek symbols for like three hours. So

348
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,750
Well, we didn't know what we were doing last time. All right last you gotta give us some credit

349
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,750
The last time we played this that was the first time we've ever even seen the manual

350
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:25,190
And the first we didn't know how the game even worked. We had two

351
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:36,619
Be honest, we probably put both the stream for 10 fucking years now. Do we know what we're doing still? No next level

352
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,160
All right, this one how did it take us this long to do this last time?

353
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,269
Here we go. I think it was because I was screaming and uh, we had some issues

354
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:51,349
But anyway, um, let's go man. This one we gotta be careful. This one is three minutes

355
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,230
All right, but that that as long as we coordinated and we're not

356
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:04,549
Screaming. All right, relax. Just relax. We're just having a good time here. Relax. Relax. It's just a bomb

357
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:15,140
And you know 3 000 people screaming at you. It's okay. It's fine. Are you ready? I'm ready

358
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,000
We have

359
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,509
Uh, I believe this is simon says with colors. Okay, that's fine. That's fun. We have red it blinked red

360
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:28,619
Okay, read me the whatever. Let's let's do simon says first. All right, i've never

361
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:34,380
Okay, so, um, what are we looking at here? We're looking at it's uh, it's red

362
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:40,599
Red is the first one it blinked red before we do this. We need to check if there's a vowel on the bomb

363
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,319
Okay vowel on the bomb you got it. Uh, there is not wait vowel on the serial number or just on the bomb in general

364
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,880
Uh the the serial yes

365
00:26:49,880 --> 00:27:00,809
Okay, there is not a vowel on this bomb. Let's go back to simon says, okay. Okay red, uh

366
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:08,259
You're gonna go blue red

367
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:21,940
Green blue green red green green blue green green

368
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:42,299
Red green green red blue green green red. Sorry. Sorry blue green green blue. Sorry. Jesus. Okay

369
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:52,339
Red green green red blue blue green green

370
00:27:52,980 --> 00:28:00,220
Blue yellow, was it red green green red blue red green green red blue

371
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:09,589
So red green green red blue then you'd be looking at no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I was I was like reading that

372
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:17,190
Okay, let's stop freaking out. Okay. Hang on. You'll be looking at blue green green blue yellow that solution. What's happening?

373
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,490
blue

374
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:26,390
Oh my god, germa. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just realized something if we get a strike on the simon

375
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:29,589
That means the equation is totally different so

376
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,940
I'm sorry. This is the first time i'm fucking reading. Okay

377
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:37,779
We're going we're going we're going we're going

378
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:43,140
Okay, look learning process learning process. My bad. That was totally on me. It gets tricky. It gets hard. Okay

379
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,299
Here we go. Ready? Okay. This time it's it's a little different this time. We have okay

380
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:52,579
A okay, it's the number four. It's the screen with it's a screen of the number and then four numbers underneath

381
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:56,359
Okay, so uh

382
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,640
Okay, it's the it's basically memory essentially, yeah, yes, it's a memory game and then you have to do this five times

383
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,319
I remember this one

384
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:07,319
All right. So when I did this I had a lot of problem. Yeah, it's your turn now. Ready?

385
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:13,940
All right inside the screen is the number four press the button in the fourth position

386
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:22,890
The number is now one press the button labeled for labeled for

387
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:35,609
One again press the button with the same label is just pressed in stage two the same label in stage two

388
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,200
Mm-hmm that was same label instead same label. Okay, that was four

389
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:49,180
Now the number is three press the button in the same position as it pressed in stage two

390
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,819
four, okay

391
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:55,960
finally four

392
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,869
Press the button with the same label as it pressed in stage three. It was also four

393
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:06,789
Done. Good. Okay. Awesome. Now we've got we have got a it's the word

394
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:11,849
It's there's a word in the box and then the six other words. So the word is red

395
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,640
Okay, hang on this car contraption is something like out of a sketch comedy routine

396
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,079
I'll tell them about it, which might be funny if you weren't connected to a bomb

397
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,519
I'll keep this brief

398
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:22,759
Okay

399
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:28,039
So read the display in a step one to determine which button label to read using the button label you step you step two

400
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:31,880
Determine which button to push repeat until the model has been disarmed. Okay, so what?

401
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,759
Word do we have in the thing? The word is

402
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,460
red

403
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,980
Inside of the box the word it's the word reading what is on in the middle button to the right middle to the right

404
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:51,099
The word is right. Okay, right. Let me see here. Uh, uh

00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:01,000
We're quickly learning now that uh, you know with this reading thing. Don't worry. Don't worry. These are growing steps

416
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,240
We did great at the first tier. Let's just let's just keep going and hammer this in and eventually we'll be

417
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,759
Experts, but i'm just telling you something it's gonna be next bomb. We're gonna actually be treating as we'll die. Yes

464
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,730
Honestly, don't don't worry about it because now

465
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:55,829
That simon says thing was fine

466
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:58,389
we're quickly learning that the uh

467
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,250
The it's called who's on first that one is a little difficult for us

468
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:06,250
It is because we have to be very specific because i'm noticing a lot like here's the thing

469
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:13,530
That's very important about this some of these you are there's three variations on you are there's you are without you space are

470
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,889
You know, whatever, uh

471
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,219
There's possessive

472
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:25,300
Like your pizza. Yeah, why oh you are right? Why oh you are and then there's there then there is

473
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:29,300
You are a pizza as in you apostrophe re, you know

474
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,539
Oh shit

475
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:32,659
Okay

476
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:40,579
All right. So i'm gonna start saying apostrophe i'm gonna say possessive apostrophe or space on the you and there's also this different variations on

477
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:47,860
Right. There's not just uh, there's uh, yeah and okay h h h so there's gonna be a lot of

478
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,820
Specifics here and we have to be super fucking like talking about this

479
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:58,260
So, uh, this is this is very bad for me because not i'm not an english speaker. You know, I don't speak english

We are dying here, but honestly

541
00:41:20,889 --> 00:41:24,730
Let's be honest here. I think we're doing just a little bit better than last time. Yeah, we are

542
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:35,449
All right. Well, uh try this one more time. This is fucking wild. All right. I'm ready. You ready?

00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:53,320
There's a vowel on the serial number. We have a vowel. Oh, okay. We have a vowel

Blank middle no

563
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:57,539
Okay

564
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:03,480
So it has to be what it's it's what is it is it what first one first one? No, that's not right

565
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:07,510

569
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:35,590
Just hold it down. Just hold it down. Okay, it's flashing yellow five and in position. We did it. We did it

570
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:46,869
We did it. That was good. My soul escaped my butthole. I was my heart was fucking beating on my chest

571
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:55,210
So what what happened to chimo man? Oh nice bomb defusing 101. We we passed the tutorial

572
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:05,989
All right, well that proves that we can do this. I think honestly this sounds ironic, but I think me being an idiot

573
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,070
I'm actually reading better than actually playing

574
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:10,869
I think we found our groove

575
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,539
Yeah, I think so which will shake up later on the string mind you so

576
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,659
That's gonna be fun

577
00:45:17,659 --> 00:45:19,530
Okay

578
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,530
This one. Okay. Now they're getting harder

579
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,730
Okay, this one is called a hidden message

580
00:45:25,449 --> 00:45:27,750
Oh, yeah, this is now moderate difficulty

581
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,630
Okay, we do have five minutes

582
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:39,019
Information can be obscured in ways that are time consuming to decode in the world of bomb defusing. That's a bad thing

583
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,469
Information can possibly mean it's weird with five minutes

584
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:51,900
Okay, but that's fine. Listen, the last one was so hard because we were at like two minutes. I think yeah, that was three minutes

585
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,280
Yeah, that's a little all right. Okay. Well, that's fine. Let's just try it out

586
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:07,780
Let's try it out and see what we got. Let's give it up. Let's give it a whirl. Let's go. I'm so fucking nervous

587
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,539
I know

588
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:11,539
I think there's only three modules though

589
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:13,059
All right, you ready?

590
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:15,989
Yep, do a hard blink. Here we go

591
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:22,389
Uh, we have a new module here. It is a game boy looking thing that has five letters on it

592
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:28,090
It's a five letters. Okay, five letters looks like a game boy and there's arrows on the top and bottom

593
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:33,769
I can switch I can change the letters. It's five. Okay. Well, here's what i'm gonna i'm gonna start writing down

594
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,170
I think I yeah, I see this module

595
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:39,769
This is gonna be impossible because i'm gonna have to deduct a word from this. All right

596
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,170
So just give me the first letters. Okay

597
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:44,949
The letter is a

598
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:46,940
Okay, a

599
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,739
oh

600
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,260
Okay. No, no, no, no

601
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,570
so so so

602
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:59,210
I'm not saying what's on screen. I'm saying cycle through them. Oh, okay. The first letter has potential to be a

603
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:01,750
okay

604
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:05,750
Oh, yeah h or v or j x o

605
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:10,739

o i b m

609
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:25,929
R q so we're looking o i m q almost the two letter ones. Oh, oh

610
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:29,260
Oh

00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,820
Oh then oh then oh then what?

612
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,780
What do you want the third one?

613
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,579
Cycle through the the the second one. Okay, the second one has o i

614
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:41,099
b

615
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:41,900

00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,900
Yeah, all right. Did you just like eat you ever bought ham from the store in a package and you just don't even make a sandwich

653
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,019
You just like eat it out of the right thing ham. Is it cooked?

654
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,699
Yeah, it's you know, like, you know, it's not raw. I mean it's like you're like, you know, she's like shit like that bag

00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:52,440
Um, I I used to eat bagged chicken. I used to eat chicken out of a bag

00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:58,219
That that's fucking weird. Well, you mean like deli ham like sliced deli ham

Okay

661
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,019
I thought you meant like you went to the store and you bought like a full ham in a bag and it was

662
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:10,219
I don't know. So you're saying like I i'm not saying german. Do you eat raw pig like no?

663
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:17,099
I don't know. Let's just go ahead. All right, so let's go something's different

664
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:20,820
Okay, um, what does it say five minutes

665
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Okay, three modules

666
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,539
And it says do these wires look different to you? Does this bomb look exploded to you?

667
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:33,239
Great. All right. Well, let's uh

668
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:36,039
Well, see bar you've got a good ham here

669
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:49,480
Okay, let's go i'm fucking nervous

670
00:51:51,289 --> 00:52:00,360
We're gonna die german. Oh, I need a second. I just like farmed a bad joke for fun

671
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,840
All right. We got a simon says

672
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:06,920
Okay. First of all, do we have a vowel or do we not have a vowel?

673
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,760
there is

674
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,840
No vowel on this

675
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,480
There's no vowel. Okay

676
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,119
Uh, so what what is the color sim blue?

677
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,500
yellow

678
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,860
Okay, blue green

679
00:52:26,869 --> 00:52:32,059
yellow green

680
00:52:32,059 --> 00:52:34,059
blue green blue

681
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,159
yellow green yellow

682
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:43,320
blue green blue red

683
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,920
yellow green yellow blue

684
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:51,610
final one

685
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:54,809
blue green blue red red

686
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:58,630
You're gonna make fun of this. But uh, do they have a

687
00:52:59,269 --> 00:53:03,030
What's my trade of thought? What what what happened? Hold on. Wait, what are you waiting for a vowel?

688
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,539
What did we have a vowel? Yes or no, sorry. No, no

689
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:14,260
Hold on. Okay. Okay. It's making sure. Okay, so read me them again. Sorry, but it's quick. Um, it was

690
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:18,019
blue green blue red red

691
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:23,099
Yellow green yellow blue and the last one was red. Yes

692
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:26,219
Yeah, hold on. Let's just refresh

693
00:53:27,019 --> 00:53:28,630
Okay

694
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:29,829
Yes

695
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:33,190
blue green blue red red

696
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:36,969
yellow green yellow blue

697
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:41,260
No, no, no, sorry my bad. No, no, that's green. That's yellow

698
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:49,289
Did we do it? What it was red red? What what i have a suggestion

699
00:53:49,849 --> 00:53:54,760
All right, we clock out of this one now and repeat it immediately. There's no need for this time waste

700
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:03,929
Let's just let's just redo this one. Let's just leave the room back out of the situation and redo this mission

701
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:07,050
All right, because I lost my track just walk away

702
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:10,070
Walk away walk away from this one

703
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:15,059
You don't have to kill us

704
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:19,219
Go out of the fucking room. You have to like blow me off. It was quicker to do that

705
00:54:19,539 --> 00:54:24,389
I was quicker to do it that way. All right, let's

706
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:29,050
It's sorry that was totally on me. Do you see how easy it is to just throw

707
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:33,769
It's so easy to throw everything off because it was like, okay blue green blue blue

708
00:54:33,849 --> 00:54:36,570
Do we have a serial number? Do we have to do a vowel? It's like, hey

709
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:41,610
It's super embarrassing but the problem the problem with that is like it's like riding a bike

710
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:46,170
Like, you know how to do it, but somebody just like throws a stick in the wheel and you're like, okay

711
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:52,219
Yeah, like all right. Let's just cut our shit. Yeah, was there no there was no vowel. I don't remember

712
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:56,579
Okay. Okay. Don't worry about this. We can do this. Here we go

713
00:54:57,699 --> 00:55:00,019
All right. I'm going to talk very clearly and very slowly

714
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,980
Okay. All right. We're going to do this wires here. We have six wires

715
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:11,539
And they're in this order four blue two red blue blue blue red red

716
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,260
Last digit of the serial number is odd

717
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:19,420
Is the last digit of the serial number odd it is even? Okay

718
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:27,289
Uh, it's exactly one yellow wire. There is it's only blue and red four blue two red

719
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,199
If there are no red wires cut the last wire, but you do have red bars

720
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:32,440
Yeah

721
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:41,260
Two red wires the last wire is red two red wires the fourth wire cut the fourth wire wire done. Okay. Okay, we have

722
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:48,539
Um some different looking wires. These are strange looking wires. They go they go they're they're they're different. They're vertical not horizontal

723
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:50,619
Are they are are they? Uh

724
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:54,139
Do they have a star and a light on them? Um

725
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:57,340
Yes, they they did they did for a second

726
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:01,420
But we're gonna go to go with simon says because the lights just turned off simon says, okay

727
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,980
Simon says holy shit. Okay. Yes

728
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,460
Uh, yeah, I know

729
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:07,579
Okay

730
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:09,579
No, I just I I still on that page

731
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:16,780
So so read me this serial, um serial number. No, no, no serious. No, no, no. There's a vowel. Okay. So, uh,

732
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:22,300
Here we go. Okay. Let's go first flash blue red

733
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,820
blue yellow

734
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,340
red green

735
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:33,610
good

736
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,610
blue yellow blue

737
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:42,099
Red green red

738
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:48,550
Uh, hold on shut up. Not you. All right back to the wires. That was it. We're done

739
00:56:49,269 --> 00:56:51,269
We have uh, five wires

740
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:55,300
Well, that was almost this we're done with it. Yeah, that's it. That's it. It's green light

741
00:56:56,099 --> 00:57:01,300
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. So relax. We have three full minutes to figure this out. So just okay. Okay, here we go

742
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,139
we're gonna be looking at something called uh, uh, it's saying the

743
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:10,329
These wires are not like the others some have stripes this makes them completely different

744
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:12,889
The good news is that we found a concise set of instructions

745
00:57:13,449 --> 00:57:15,449
so this is what it's referred as a

746
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:21,210
M diagram, okay. Oh, I just gotta align this. Okay. So what is the first one?

747
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:25,449
Okay, so from left to right it is white. Yes

748
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:28,630
Okay. Um, no, no, no, no, okay

749
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:33,429
That doesn't matter the instructions said that doesn't matter. Okay. It's like I line these so we have does it have a star?

750
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:36,150
Yeah, okay. There are three stars on the bottom

751
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:45,190
Okay, the first second and third wire are on a star. Okay. Uh, okay that won't matter then. Okay, so

752
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,840
You would need to uh

753
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:54,039
Let me let me read you the wires. Let me cut the first one cut the first wire first

754
00:57:54,039 --> 00:58:01,539
Like all like like left the leftmost wire. Yes. Okay. Uh, there's more to do. Yes

755
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:06,980
So, uh, what's the what's the what's the second one? So these wires are red

756
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:10,900
And then blue and red striped that's the two different that's it

757
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,500
So there's two blue and red striped and then there's two red

758
00:58:14,739 --> 00:58:19,219
Does it have a light? Does it have a light the blue and red stripe has a light and it's on a star?

759
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:24,389
Okay, that's a star. Uh, don't cut that one. Next one

760
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:31,639
The next one is a red wire on a star with no light red wire with a star. No light

761
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:46,650
Cut that one. Yes, there's more to do. Okay. Yeah, keep going. Keep going

762
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:51,530
The next wire is no star with a light and it is a red and blue striped wire

763
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:56,380
So just the light on this no, no, no, no star light. Just the light no star

764
00:58:57,699 --> 00:59:09,769
It's the last serial number even is the serial number even? Uh, yeah, the number is is even cut it cut that wire

765
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:18,039
Okay, there are two wires that remain the last wire is they have a star the last wire does not have a star

766
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:26,389
Okay, so that's nothing on it. Not just red. Let's have a star. Nothing. Nothing. Just red. It's the last even it

767
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:29,530
It was even right? It was even it was even last year lumber cut it

768
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:39,750
Somebody said hello cut it. Hello. Just cut it. Hello. What do you mean? I don't want to fuck it up

769
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:49,619
Okay, so do you know what a venn diagram is? I'm gonna pretend to yes. Uh, okay, so it's like a giant

770
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,980
um

771
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:58,780
It's like a bunch of circles circles with different colors essentially inside of each circle. Yes. Yes. I know that spells the solution. Yes

772
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,019
Except these are colorless in the manual

773
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:07,179
So you're gonna have to really like squint your fucking eyes. The only way of reading this is if the colors spell out

774
01:00:08,219 --> 01:00:14,460
Uh, if they're striped or dotted it's bullshit, but don't worry about it. I feel like you're doing a lot of good work here

775
01:00:16,469 --> 01:00:21,349
NA education, um, well here's the thing about my NA education. Uh, Joel, I gotta ask you this

776
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:26,070
Uh people people like oh, I can't believe you didn't know you didn't know what what that symbol was

777
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:28,070
You didn't know what that math problem was

778
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:30,070
When was the last time you sat in a math class?

779
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:36,039
Like what's the time you were sitting in a math class in a chair in a math class

780
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,559
I feel like i'm in a math class every fucking stream with these people

781
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:49,750
Uh 100 years. I don't know. Uh, it's been a while. So it's been 20 years since i've been in a math class

782
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,380
So yeah, I don't know what the omega symbol is. You're 60

783
01:00:57,210 --> 01:01:00,550
No, i'm I turned I turned 25 next week

784
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:07,780
This one's gonna be hard

785
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,780
Okay, uh, this one is four modules

786
01:01:10,739 --> 01:01:14,179
And it says 60 percent of the time this bomb explodes every time

787
01:01:15,219 --> 01:01:17,219
Okay, I don't know what that's supposed to mean

788
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:20,980
Does this mean that we have a 60 percent chance to lose? It means nothing good. It means nothing good

789
01:01:23,539 --> 01:01:29,219
All right, let's just are you good. I'm ready to rock and roll man. All right. I'm ready. I'm feeling 100 about this

790
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,420
Did you take a hundred percent? I'm sure that is I took a multivitamin last time it helped

791
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:36,599
It helped

792
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:41,880
Yeah, yeah, but I don't need performance enhancing drugs to do this all I need is the the skill of a gamer. All right

793
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:46,940
Yeah, if uh, all those guys that got in trouble when they did took vitamin b12

794
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:50,630
All those athletes

795
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:52,949
Yeah

796
01:01:52,949 --> 01:01:59,190
It's about honor. It's about honor. Yeah, I i'm low on vitamin d. I'm not gonna i'm not gonna like drink any milk

797
01:01:59,989 --> 01:02:01,880
All right, you good

798
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:02,920
I'm good

799
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:07,610
Here we go. We have a different module this module

800
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:12,809
Uh has a megahertz on it and it's a blinking light with with almost like a radio, uh dial

801
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:16,409
I can change the the amount of megahertz and there's a button that says tx

802
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:23,030
We have a blinking light up top and then we have something with megahertz. It's it's drama 3.5

803
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:25,929
Is this morse code?

804
01:02:25,929 --> 01:02:27,929
I mean morse code. I don't hear anything

805
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:34,219
Is there a light going beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep if it was morse code?

806
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,860
It's wouldn't be able to hear it

807
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:43,690
No, it's a visual because that's how people communicate with flashlights in like world wars. Okay. All right. Yes, there is a light up here

808
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:50,730
And I uh, okay. Uh, yeah, do you know how to read morse code jerma? No, absolutely not zero knowledge. I know that like I know

809
01:02:53,639 --> 01:03:04,030
What's that that's that's sos right that's sos

810
01:03:04,969 --> 01:03:07,210
jerma

811
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:09,210
You can't read morse code

812
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:13,590
Why the fuck do I know why would I know morse code?

813
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:20,650
That's basic school knowledge. No, it's not what is this 1910?

814
01:03:20,889 --> 01:03:25,050
What do you mean basic school knowledge? This is like 1840. All right, ready

815
01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:29,289
Jerma, I can't read morse code either. I'm fucked too. Oh god. Okay. So here we go

816
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:32,730
this

817
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:36,090
All right. Listen, listen, we wasted a lot of time on this. Can you hear my screen?

818
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:42,260
I can okay, you ready listen to my stream for just i'm gonna be quiet

819
01:03:49,900 --> 01:04:13,340
No, hold on let me hold on. Okay, jerma. I have a better solution to this

820
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:17,380
Is that helping a better solution to this? No, absolutely not

821
01:04:18,019 --> 01:04:21,860
This is going to practice right? It doesn't matter if this explodes or not this we have to hammer this in

822
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,260
Uh, we I have to teach you morse code

823
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,500
or rather

824
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:30,420
I gotta complain about something. It's dots and dashes. I know I know the basics is dots and dashes

825
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,860
I just gotta complain with something chat

826
01:04:34,179 --> 01:04:38,260
Yeah, yeah, let me let me just explain something to both chats here. So

827
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:41,460
Two weeks ago

828
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,460
I read the manual and it said

829
01:04:43,699 --> 01:04:45,380
morse code

830
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:47,460
And i've been telling chat for two weeks that

831
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:53,940
Chat i'm going to learn morse code off stream so they can snitch on me and tell jerma beforehand

832
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,980
Joel has been practicing off stream in reality

833
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:02,019
I did not practice at all because I wanted you guys to just see how much of a snitch you guys were to jerma

834
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:08,730
Um, so I didn't practice at all. So you guys that have been going around talking to jerma saying hey, by the way

835
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:10,329
Joel's been cheating

836
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:12,570
You guys fucked up, I know who you guys are

837
01:05:12,969 --> 01:05:19,530
I'm gonna tell you on sos and fucking morse codes because i'm coming over there and i'm gonna tell you something snitches get stitches

838
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:25,369
All right, so fuck you. All right. Anyway, but that doesn't deduct from the problem here. We have to learn this

839
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:31,769
So I propose this morse code is relatively simple. It's a it's a matter of taking it slow and easy

840
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:34,409
So what I propose here, you're going to be reading me again

841
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:39,289
I know that there's a clock here, but don't worry about it exploding. We have to learn this so again

842
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,469
I have a diagram

843
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:46,789
Okay, so here's what i'm saying. This is going to be a repeating pattern essentially, right? Yes

844
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:50,599
And we're not going to be we don't need to read the full letter

845
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:57,940
So for example, uh, if the word will be shell there will be a frequency at 3505 do that

846
01:05:58,179 --> 01:06:02,250
That's a test just ask anyway press tx

847
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:07,380
Okay, I just want to make a make a see if it worked anyway, but that doesn't matter

848
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:11,860
Uh, so here's what we're gonna do again. I know that the clock is ticking, but this is just a practice round

849
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:17,719
Um, so, um, let me read this. Here we go. Okay

850
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:25,239
interpret the signal from the flashing light using the morse code chart to spell one of the words in the table the signal will loop with a

851
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:32,119
Long gap between repetitions once the word is identified set the corresponding frequency and press the transmit tx button

852
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,150
so

853
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:37,510
Essentially what we're going to be looking at here is um

854
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:43,269
It's it's going to be actually quite simple. Um, it's it's it's a you are going to be rating me

855
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:49,449
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna be reading you're gonna say dot dash, right? Yeah to spell out something

856
01:06:49,449 --> 01:06:52,969
Yes, and there's going to be a space in between these when the spaces happen

857
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:57,619
I propose that you say dot dash comma dot dot dash comma

858
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:58,260
Yes

859
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:04,420
And that's going to spell out a word for me to like deduct and then we take that word and then we transpose that into a frequency

860
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:08,039
so, uh

861
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:14,179
German did that and any of that register? I was repeating the last three words you were saying and nodding my head. Uh,

862
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:18,059
No, no, I get it. I get it. Yeah, it's dot dot dash

863
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:21,769
dots and dashes and then in between

864
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:26,809
Like for instance like dot dot dash if it was dot dot dash

865
01:07:27,289 --> 01:07:31,849
That's a letter so dot dot dash that will actually let me see if that actually means something

866
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:37,139
Dot dot dash would be you as in the letter you yes, and after you say that

867
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:42,340
Make sure you say comma so you don't say dot dot dash dash dot dot like that would fuck me up

868
01:07:42,579 --> 01:07:48,019
Yeah, add a little comment between this. I know where to separate the letters. I think we're good to go

869
01:07:48,179 --> 01:07:48,980
I think I get it

870
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,780
Okay, uh, but keep in mind if there's misspellings here

871
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,820
We're gonna have to do this all over again and this could lead to a lot of fucking problems

872
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:58,659
But i'm gonna be very look. I promise i'm known for my noises, right?

873
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:04,170
Like I mean that's good. I'm known to be able to get correct noises. If there's one thing i'm confident

874
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:07,269
It's making noise. Okay, i'm ready

875
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:12,820
I'm known for like literally if you type in german on h5 into google

876
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:16,579
The first thing that pops up is probably like the mini century noise so like i'm good

877
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:23,029
Uh, we don't have to do that this one. All right, we got the um, we got the

878
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:26,489
We have a new module. It is three wires

879
01:08:27,539 --> 01:08:34,100
On horizontal and there's one two, three abc. It's a new module. Oh, we're looking at a wire sequence here

880
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,020
We're looking at a wire. Yeah, it's a wire sequence

881
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:41,060
The wires are horizontal and they and there are there's one two three abc on the left and right

882
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:45,939
Let me let me read this see what the fuck this is within this model. There are several panels with okay

883
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:51,380
So basically this can also be a practice round because this is also going to be something completely fucking

884
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:55,779
Within this module there are several panels with wires with them

885
01:08:55,939 --> 01:09:01,060
But only one panel is visible at a time switch to the next panel by using the down button and the previous panel

886
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:03,689
By using the up button. Okay

887
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:06,810
Jerma, okay, press the down button to go to a new panel and it said

888
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,600
Don't don't don't touch no touch

889
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:16,010
Do not switch to the next panel until you're sure that you have cut all the necessary wires on the current panel

890
01:09:16,409 --> 01:09:24,250
Jerma, anyway cut the wires as directed by the following table wire occurrences are cumulatively all over the panels within the module and

891
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:28,979
Okay. So the first one here you have to tell me

892
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:37,979
One goes to what and what color? Okay. So one for instance one is black and it goes one to a

893
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:48,979
One to a okay cut it. Okay. The next wire is blue and it goes two to b

894
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:57,979
Do not cut that one. Oh, actually does it go to b? Yes

895
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:01,270
Sorry cut that one

896
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:05,189
That was my mistake. I'm so sorry. I'm so glad that there's like a lot of audio in the background

897
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:07,350
Because that was like a bullfrog noise that I made

898
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:13,289
All right, so then three goes to c and that's the last one to cut anyways, so I cut it. Yes

899
01:10:13,529 --> 01:10:19,500
Yes, and then go down. Okay. I see. All right. I get you. All right, so we got four five six

900
01:10:19,659 --> 01:10:24,060
There is no wire on four. We have a black wire five b

901
01:10:27,029 --> 01:10:29,029
Uh skip to the next one

902
01:10:29,029 --> 01:10:34,409
Black wire six c. Yeah. Yeah, just skip the next one. I I think this will work. Okay

903
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:43,800
Uh, it's seven eight nine and then a b c eight. Okay, so uh, eight goes to c blue wire

904
01:10:44,819 --> 01:10:52,390
Cut cut cut the blue one. Okay, nine now goes to c black wire and then we'll take it will be

905
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,789
in terms of like

906
01:10:54,789 --> 01:10:58,789
Occurrences like how many blacks this will be only black wire will be

907
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:03,850
So this will be the second right? Oh, we have to keep track of how many wires there were

908
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:11,270
Okay, and then we'll be so the sec this will be the second one go up go up go up. Oh you can go up

909
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:15,079
Okay, so wait, then now is okay. So this there are two

910
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:21,189
Black wires here on this one and then on the one before that there's one black wire on the one before that

911
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:29,989
So we're looking at four four in total now. So this is the fourth black wire. Okay. Uh, does it go to c? Yes

912
01:11:31,029 --> 01:11:35,449
Cut it. That's it. Next one is

913
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:41,399
Uh 10 11 12 a b c 10 is a blue wire 10 b

914
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:48,060
So the blue one will be in terms of occurrence. We've been looking at the this would be

915
01:11:48,699 --> 01:11:54,069
One this would be this would be the third blue wire. Does it go to a?

916
01:11:54,729 --> 01:11:56,890
Uh, it does not it goes to b

917
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:03,859
Uh, don't okay. So second one second one is a red wire 11 c

918
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,260
Okay, and that will be I think the second one

919
01:12:08,739 --> 01:12:09,979
Yeah

920
01:12:09,979 --> 01:12:12,710
um, I don't know

921
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:14,470
Yeah, probably

922
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:17,350
Just go next. Just go next. You can't say probably

923
01:12:18,069 --> 01:12:20,859
Yeah, probably. I don't know. Oh my god

924
01:12:21,899 --> 01:12:27,500
Listen, it's a completely new fucking log to me and I I don't I don't it's hard to like decipher

925
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:32,699
What the fuck these mean, but whatever whatever listen if we refresh now and we get a morse code one

926
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:37,180
I I think I think we're we're good. All right, we've learned we've learned these two

927
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:45,430
We've learned these two now maybe the bomb. Okay, let's just let's just get some ass in absolutes if you're a bomb diffuser

928
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:51,829
Okay, okay. No, you got it. You got it. You got it man. You got it. Here we go. Ready? Yes. Yes restart in go

929
01:12:53,609 --> 01:12:58,380
Simon says okay, but are you sure it's just simon says though?

930
01:12:58,859 --> 01:13:03,260
What do uh, no, I mean the Simon says that we have morse code on this one and one of the new wire ones

931
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,500
but there's

932
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:08,619
Simon says how about how about this another practice round it here?

933
01:13:08,699 --> 01:13:09,979
Because here's what I want to do

934
01:13:09,979 --> 01:13:12,939
I want to get this morse code shit down here so we can do this in the future, right?

935
01:13:12,939 --> 01:13:13,819
You got it. All right

936
01:13:13,819 --> 01:13:17,819
So, uh, you remember what I said about saying like comas and all that shit. Yep

937
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:22,380
I I got you. I got you. All right, so let me let me wait till let's wait till we get a big break here

938
01:13:22,619 --> 01:13:31,939
Okay, hold on. Mm-hmm dot dot dot dot that's h

939
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:48,300
Okay, so we have dot dot dot germa. I already know the answer. It's three five. Oh five dot three five

940
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:53,420
Oh five three five. Oh five is a solution. No, it's not three five. Oh five three five

941
01:13:53,899 --> 01:13:55,899
three point five oh three point five oh five

942
01:13:56,539 --> 01:13:57,979
three five

943
01:13:57,979 --> 01:14:00,140
One five three five one five

944
01:14:00,779 --> 01:14:02,779
That's correct, sorry my bad

945
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,939
All right. Now we've got the wires

946
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,819
I'll tell you i'll tell the solution for this and this is going to be a strategy for us

947
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:11,020
All right, I know we probably can't do this. It's another practice round here do this quick

948
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:13,819
Okay, so basically I have all these words that correspond to the letter

949
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:17,500
And basically if the letter or there's words there's words

950
01:14:17,819 --> 01:14:19,579
There's all of these words

951
01:14:19,579 --> 01:14:22,380
But this one was unique because it was the only one that started with an h

952
01:14:22,619 --> 01:14:27,819
That means I can deduct and immediately know the answer beforehand so I can immediately spit out the code at you. So

953
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,579
That's

954
01:14:30,579 --> 01:14:34,100
All right. All right. We got we got the the wire when we practiced last time here it comes

955
01:14:34,659 --> 01:14:37,220
All right. We have okay two red wires

956
01:14:37,699 --> 01:14:39,699
one two three a b c

957
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:47,000
One b red. Okay, you're gonna have to repeat that because I got lost in the manual here. I'm so sorry

958
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,800
We have this now now now

959
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:53,079
Okay, so we have two red wires. That's correct

960
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,489
Okay, so uh the first one

961
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,260
uh does it go to

962
01:14:59,739 --> 01:15:04,140
C now you said a right one goes from one to b red wire

963
01:15:05,079 --> 01:15:09,960
Okay, do not cut that one. The second one goes to to a two to a red wire

964
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,409
Skip all of these just go to the next one. The next one we have four five six a b c

965
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:22,569
The first wire is a black wire four to b second wire is a blue wire

966
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:27,850
Okay, the next wire is a blue wire five to c

967
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:31,239
Skip to the next

968
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:36,760
This next one is seven eight nine a b c

969
01:15:38,119 --> 01:15:42,439
The two wires that are present on this module are red and do we have

970
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:45,399
Okay, if there's a red wire

971
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:46,600
Cut it right now

972
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,640
Okay

973
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,199
The next one is a black wire nine a

974
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,760
Okay, and this would be the the third black wire. Yeah, that's okay. This would be the one

975
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,720
This would be the second black wire

976
01:16:00,119 --> 01:16:02,840
Okay, and that goes to a a you said

977
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,399
uh cut it

978
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:10,760
Got it. Okay last one. We have three wires. It's 10 11 12 a b c

979
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,640
This is a black wires the first one it goes to b

980
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,680
Cut that cut the black wire

981
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,319
Okay. Now we have two red wires

982
01:16:19,939 --> 01:16:22,420
11 b

983
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:25,779
okay, and in terms of occurrences this this one will be the

984
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:30,380
Third or fourth one. Yeah, this would be the one two

985
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:35,689
three

986
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:37,850
This would be the fourth red wire

987
01:16:38,489 --> 01:16:40,250
that is dust dust

988
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:42,489
Does the fourth one here go to a?

989
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:44,409
It goes to b

990
01:16:44,409 --> 01:16:49,640
Okay, do not cut that one and the last one was a red wire as well. It's 12 a

991
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:54,680
Skip to the next one done. Okay. Oh, we have symbols you ready?

992
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,800
Uh, yeah, uh ae trident stitches h or n

993
01:17:00,869 --> 01:17:01,750
uh

994
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:04,500
Batman symbol batman symbol

995
01:17:04,579 --> 01:17:13,479
What batman I heard the fucking music. I know we would be fucked. There's no fucking way. I could spit out that much shit

996
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,529
Maybe aquaman

997
01:17:17,529 --> 01:17:20,729
All right, we got we got we're getting that done. So we got to keep tracking the amount. Okay. I got it

998
01:17:21,289 --> 01:17:25,779
Mm-hmm. I got it. All right, so more morse code is not a problem for us now

999
01:17:25,779 --> 01:17:28,899
I I think I think we got that down and the occurrence wires

1000
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:34,100
I think we got two the thing we've got to be watching out watching out for though is we got those complicated wires

1001
01:17:34,739 --> 01:17:39,460
But I think I got that down with the venn diagram. So, all right, I I think we're we're we're these new

1002
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,760
Complicated wires that have been you know

1003
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:45,670
Generated for it. I think we're good. So next one. Here we go. I think we can do this

1004
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:48,949
I think we're good. I think we got it this time. Yeah, I think we're so yeah. Yeah, absolutely

1005
01:17:49,029 --> 01:17:50,630
All right. Are you guys ready?

1006
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:56,010
Are you ready? Are you ready? I'm ready, man. I'm ready, man. All right game boy with a word to spell

1007
01:17:57,029 --> 01:17:59,670
Okay, we're gonna be spelling out a word here. So we're gonna looking at the

1008
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:04,220
This is called a uh, this is called the subject of password

1009
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:07,739
So i'm gonna be writing down all the first ones in the first column, right? So get ready

1010
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:11,659
I okay, here we go. Ready first first letter in the first column b

1011
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:14,460
j b c

1012
01:18:14,619 --> 01:18:15,659
t

1013
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:18,739
e d

1014
01:18:18,739 --> 01:18:20,739
So we're looking at bj ted

1015
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:27,829
Yes, yes bj ted, correct. Okay bj ted second row

1016
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:29,510
c

1017
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:30,470
e

1018
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:31,510
h

1019
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:32,310
n

1020
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:36,310
w s

1021
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:43,510
So c e h n w s that's correct. Okay, so and the third ones are s

1022
01:18:44,229 --> 01:18:46,649
l n b

1023
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:48,250
i

1024
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:54,039
K. Okay. So the first one let's see here. Uh c b t ted

1025
01:18:56,710 --> 01:19:00,710
Uh t is anyone start with t

1026
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:10,149
The word is think. Mm-hmm. I think so would make sense. Wouldn't it? No

1027
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:18,229
Yes, it is. Nope work. It could be thing with the word is thing. The word is thing

1028
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:23,609
All right, we got okay. What's code? Okay, we got morse code. All right, you ready now now keep in mind

1029
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:28,489
I want you to like remember these so like and say comma in between so here we go

1030
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:43,500
So we got a v yeah, yeah

1031
01:19:45,859 --> 01:19:47,760
Try putting in

1032
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:56,279
3595 as a solution three five nine five. Okay

1033
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:02,359
Uh, now we have the word game where like the there you uh, what? Huh? Okay. We I got that

1034
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:05,720
So are you prepared? Huh? Okay. The first word is there

1035
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:08,979
It is there like as in like

1036
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,180
Okay, so middle right middle right

1037
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:25,460
What with a question mark what what would the question work? Uh, so we got uh with three h's we got what four letters

1038
01:20:25,939 --> 01:20:26,899
left

1039
01:20:26,899 --> 01:20:32,390
Nothing ready. What is on here? But it's what I just asked. It's what I just said to you though

1040
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:38,659
What with a question mark? Oh, yeah. No, no, no. What what is the word here? Okay. Oh, no, no, no

1041
01:20:38,739 --> 01:20:40,739
Okay, I got okay. Uh

1042
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:47,909
Wait, okay. The word is there their pizza in the middle right sex spot is what you

1043
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:54,069
Hold your with an apostrophe like what kind of single you or you you like you a person

1044
01:20:55,670 --> 01:21:03,449
Uh us in like three letters. Yes. Okay. It's there. Okay next next word. Okay, we have you it is y-o-u

1045
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,750
You as a person you

1046
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:10,220
Okay, uh, let's see here you are looking at uh, you

1047
01:21:10,939 --> 01:21:12,939
Middle right middle right no

1048
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:15,270
blank

1049
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:17,270
Uh three h's wait

1050
01:21:17,909 --> 01:21:26,520
First got it final final word is you again y-o-u you so we're looking at middle right again

1051
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,760
You y-o-u the person you sure you are with a space in between

1052
01:21:33,319 --> 01:21:38,680
You're possessive you're with an apostrophe next. Okay. Yeah, we got it. All right. We got

1053
01:21:39,159 --> 01:21:44,359
Uh, we got one more and it's just it's the symbols like the half-life symbol thing right half-life symbol

1054
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,159
All right, we have half-life symbol mirrored k

1055
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:56,300
Sleepy three and a not filled in star. Okay, uh the x looking weird thing

1056
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:00,300
we're looking at the uh

1057
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:03,960
The three half-life and the weird star

1058
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:11,939
sleepy three sleepy three

1059
01:22:15,079 --> 01:22:19,159
Yeah, it's like somebody just like was doing three and then they just fell asleep when they got to the end

1060
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:25,270
We had a minute left to go that's about our best time by the way, that's good

1061
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:29,510
You know, you know what though I think the morse code is really easy the problem with the morse code though is

1062
01:22:29,829 --> 01:22:31,829
Sometimes I can't do that logical

1063
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:35,670
What is it called when you elimination where you're like, you know

1064
01:22:37,109 --> 01:22:42,470
Basically, the word was vector right? There's only one word like that. That's one v in it

1065
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:46,069
So why I chose to do was just go v and then it's got to be vectors

1066
01:22:46,069 --> 01:22:48,069
I correspond with the frequency on it

1067
01:22:48,069 --> 01:22:50,789
But there might be several ones that start with t for example

1068
01:22:51,029 --> 01:22:54,069
That means I have to also get the second letter so I can't do up

1069
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:59,189
I think it's process of elimination. I think it's called so uh, it's it's gonna the channels will ramp up

1070
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:03,899
But don't don't worry. I think we got this this next one is called fair game

1071
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:09,880
It's called no more hand holding remember everything you've learned because anything can appear on the bump. This is a big one

1072
01:23:10,279 --> 01:23:18,859
This is the uh, this is the gear check. This is five modules. It's five minutes. This is the this is the dps check

1073
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:22,819
Dude, let me tell you i've been so nervous. I've been holding in this p I I

1074
01:23:23,619 --> 01:23:28,739
Now that I can relax like the the the the pp instincts are kicking. I gotta I gotta go i'm i'm sorry

1075
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:33,109
You want to take p? All right. All right. We'll take it. Yes

1076
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:37,270
Wait, are you are you like sprinting to go p or is this like let's take a break for two minutes?

1077
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:49,800
Yes, which one? Yeah, you you are you you're or you're yes or yeah, which one i'm fucking pissing head on

1078
01:23:53,189 --> 01:23:59,560
Go pee with them now. No, i'm i'm i'm gonna take a long it's gonna take a lot longer for me guys

1079
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:04,569
I take my time when I pee I I like arch my back. I like crack the neck

1080
01:24:05,529 --> 01:24:11,260
I like roll my shoulders a little bit. I look directly into the bowl for a full

1081
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,140
10 seconds and I go. All right

1082
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:17,399
That's that's where it's going right there

1083
01:24:19,609 --> 01:24:25,560
And then they're okay. I take my time. I don't I don't rush pee

1084
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:34,180
Where else is it going?

1085
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:36,979
Where else is it gonna go? You know what today?

1086
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:41,060
Today I think i'm going right at the back wall. I think that's where i'm going today

1087
01:24:48,579 --> 01:24:58,090
No one wanted to know that this is how germa paints his house

1088
01:24:59,859 --> 01:25:05,079
Do the sentry noise?

1089
01:25:05,079 --> 01:25:07,800
I don't need to do the sentry noise right now. It's not necessary

1090
01:25:23,529 --> 01:25:27,770
This was like when you when you go somewhere with somebody and you don't have to pee but they do

1091
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:30,810
And you just want to get to where you're going?

1092
01:25:31,529 --> 01:25:32,569
and

1093
01:25:32,569 --> 01:25:34,649
It's like hey man, let's get to go pee. You're like, all right

1094
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:09,420
Whoa?

1095
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:11,420
Why did it take you that long?

1096
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:13,420
Why did it take you that long to start?

1097
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:22,060
What are you doing? All right. All right. There we go. There we go. Did you pee into the corner?

1098
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:25,659

Here we go

1108
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:07,000
Uh, we're gonna do we have uh, what's the word game boy edition?

1109
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:13,239
All right. What's the word? Here we go. We're gonna start kicking ass here. So tell me what uh, what is the first letter?

1110
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,760
x

1111
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,359

y s i

1113
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:24,359
Okay, let's see here. Um, second row v b

1114
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:25,880
o

1115
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,880
q y f

1116
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:32,520
Okay, let's see here. Uh

1117
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,520
See if anyone at starboard s

1118
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:39,800
Okay, uh, does the third row have a u in it the third row?

1119
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,600
Does not have a u in it

1120
01:27:43,479 --> 01:27:45,479
shit, okay, uh shit

1121
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:51,859
Did the second row have a p in it second row?

1122
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:54,020
No, i'm not making a joke

1123
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:57,619
What the second row does not have those?

1124
01:27:58,819 --> 01:28:00,819
Okay, it does not have a p. Uh

1125
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:08,649
Shit, this is gonna be really hard one

1126
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:12,250
Uh, there's no t's either. Uh, does anyone start with w?

1127
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:15,210
Yes. Yes, it's true. That could be could be that

1128
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:20,970
I got it. I'll be you the word was world. Okay. Uh, Simon says what the fuck? Okay, Simon says

1129
01:28:21,689 --> 01:28:28,060
Uh ready Simon says, okay, whatever. I have to deduct that later on whatever. Yeah, so serial serial serial number is

1130
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:31,020
Serial number is uh

1131
01:28:31,579 --> 01:28:33,670
What are you looking for a vowel?

1132
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:35,939
Yes, no vowels

1133
01:28:35,939 --> 01:28:38,500
No vowel. Okay. So well what the color sequence is

1134
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:43,739
green

1135
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:47,819
green

1136
01:28:47,819 --> 01:28:51,539
green

1137
01:28:51,539 --> 01:28:53,539
That's the solution. Sorry what?

1138
01:28:53,779 --> 01:28:55,539
Oh, that's the solution

1139
01:28:55,539 --> 01:29:07,399
Okay, green green green green green green green green green green

1140
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:10,970
What the fuck's going on? Okay done

1141
01:29:11,449 --> 01:29:13,050
Now we got okay, uh

1142
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:14,810
We got the wire scenario. No, no, no

1143
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:18,649
We've got the the the box with the number in it with the sequence you gotta remember the sequences

1144
01:29:18,649 --> 01:29:23,689
Okay, that that shit's easy because you you you're like an elephant. You remember everything anyway, uh, sorry

1145
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:27,770
I want to say that but whatever let's just do occurrences or whatever. It's called right the complicated wires

1146
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:31,609
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1147
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:35,529
We're doing this is just the number with the the sequence the number in the in the box

1148
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:38,890
You want to do the complicated wires? Yes, because that's hard one

1149
01:29:41,739 --> 01:29:43,020
Okay

1150
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:45,020
Tell me which ones do we have?

1151
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:46,140
we have

1152
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:48,539
Uh, it's one two three a b c

1153
01:29:49,699 --> 01:29:51,699
And okay black red

1154
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:53,380
Cut it

1155
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:55,300
What cut it?

1156
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,539
Cut the black wire. Okay, what else?

1157
01:29:58,649 --> 01:30:01,369
Red what else do we have red two c?

1158
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:04,220
Cut that one, too

1159
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:11,909
Next we have one black wire four to b four five six a b c four to b black wire skip skip skip

1160
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:15,989
Next we have seven eight nine a b c blue red black

1161
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:20,630
Blue seven goes to a this is the first this is the first blue one first blue wire of the game

1162
01:30:21,109 --> 01:30:24,359
Okay, skip that one. Don't skip the full thing. Don't skip that one

1163
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:29,079
Like did you skip the thing? I did not skip it. I I I clicked it. It was a strike

1164
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:32,260
Okay, shit now, okay

1165
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,779
Okay, so when I say skip it, I didn't mean like skip the full whatever

1166
01:30:36,739 --> 01:30:40,659
So that was the blue one, right? Okay. So that this is the second red one second red one, right? No

1167
01:30:41,619 --> 01:30:47,779
Yep, second red wire second red wire and it's from a to eight to a

1168
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:51,699
Okay, don't cut that one sen and then it will be the

1169
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,239
Third black wire the second one. Sorry black third

1170
01:30:55,880 --> 01:31:01,399
It's the last wire is a black wire and it is the third black wire of the video game

1171
01:31:02,439 --> 01:31:04,439
Okay, what does that go to b?

1172
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:08,649
Good that it

1173
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:17,880
Final one is 10 11 12 a b c two blue wires one red blue blue red 10 a 11 b 12 b

1174
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:21,800
But in terms of occurrences the blue one, this will be the third one

1175
01:31:22,359 --> 01:31:25,720
This would no this be the yes, this would be one two three

1176
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:28,199
No

1177
01:31:28,199 --> 01:31:30,760
This would be the third two and three of blue wires. Yes

1178
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,060
Okay, so uh third one. It doesn't go to b

1179
01:31:35,819 --> 01:31:37,500
It goes to a

1180
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,500
Okay, don't cut that one

1181
01:31:41,909 --> 01:31:48,489
I we had three seconds. I had them. I we had three seconds. I was trying to guess

1182
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:53,670
No guessing

1183
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:57,750
How the fuck did you deduct that that member? Uh, what do you call it?

1184
01:31:58,310 --> 01:32:01,909
I just saw how do you just how I just saw w and just went with it

1185
01:32:02,869 --> 01:32:05,670
There was like there was like four fucking different ones

1186
01:32:05,909 --> 01:32:09,909
You had a 25 chance of winning and you you won. I think it was just on oh

1187
01:32:09,989 --> 01:32:12,869
I saw like the or and then I saw there was a w so I was like it's world

1188
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:14,949
I guess man

1189
01:32:14,949 --> 01:32:19,829
Okay, i'm just telling you that's my don't do a cowboy move like that again. We we don't know what's gonna happen

1190
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:23,260
Oh my god. All right. I won't do it again

1191
01:32:23,819 --> 01:32:24,699
Okay

1192
01:32:24,699 --> 01:32:25,579
Okay

1193
01:32:25,579 --> 01:32:30,300
So this one we're starting with we've got a new module, but it's remember we pick it up

1194
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:34,699
Uh, it's the pac-man module thing with the with the red triangle and the lights

1195
01:32:35,739 --> 01:32:40,699
Okay, I remember when we did this last time. Okay, so we're gonna be referring to this as a b c d e f g

1196
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:44,220
Right. Do you understand what I mean there? So when i'm saying numbers here

1197
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:51,739
Uh, i'm saying like the the uh, the vertical ones i'm saying like alpha one you'll be in the first position if i'm saying

1198
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:54,859
b2 that will be uh

1199
01:32:55,659 --> 01:33:00,779
Like yeah, like one over and down like one over and down. Yeah one over and down

1200
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:05,180
So where did you spawn here? I spawned in alpha two

1201
01:33:07,819 --> 01:33:09,819
alpha two, okay, um

1202
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:15,289
Okay, uh, and then um, we have two dots here. We have two dots here

1203
01:33:15,449 --> 01:33:19,529
Yes, where are they located? The two circles are located in

1204
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:21,050
um

1205
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:22,569
beta one

1206
01:33:22,569 --> 01:33:24,569
and beta six

1207
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:28,979
Okay, beta one and beta six and you spawn in a two a two

1208
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:36,170
Okay, and the light the light is in a b c is in

1209
01:33:37,369 --> 01:33:39,850
There was a delta delta six

1210
01:33:41,029 --> 01:33:43,029
Okay, then go down one

1211
01:33:44,810 --> 01:33:51,380
Uh, did it work? What's going on? I just went down. Why am I not moving? Did I go I did down twice?

1212
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,789
What's going on? Why is it not moving?

1213
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:59,479
Did you do this correctly?

1214
01:33:59,479 --> 01:34:02,199
You didn't you didn't confuse the red and white did you? I did

1215
01:34:04,619 --> 01:34:06,619
Oh, so we're

1216
01:34:06,779 --> 01:34:12,939
drama restarted I I didn't know I thought I thought that was us because it's everything every video game that's ever existed

1217
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:19,340
You are the fucking triangle pointing in every single game. You're the triangle that's pointing. You're the triangle on the minimap every time

1218
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:22,060
All right, just scratch it just go

1219
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:24,140
Scratch it

1220
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:28,460
You ready scratch it new. Let's kick ass. Let's kick ass. Let's kick its ass

1221
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:33,020
We have a blue button that button says detonate on it

1222
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:36,579
It says detonate. All right, so let's see here

1223
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:38,819
uh

1224
01:34:38,819 --> 01:34:42,020
How many batteries do we have on this one? The amount of batteries are

1225
01:34:42,739 --> 01:34:44,739
We have one

1226
01:34:45,909 --> 01:34:48,329
battery one battery

1227
01:34:48,329 --> 01:34:50,489
And it says detonate detonate blue

1228
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:56,460
Okay, but the problem is there is not more than one. There's just one not more than one

1229
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:59,579
There is only one button here. It's a blue button that says detonate

1230
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:05,180
It's a lit indicator on this one. There is it's on the right

1231
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Okay, does it say frk?

1232
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:12,920
No, it says trn

1233
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,329
Okay

1234
01:35:14,329 --> 01:35:18,569
Well, we're gonna be holding down this button. Okay yellow flashing light

1235
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:24,420
Well five in any position. Okay, good. Very good five in any position. Let it go

1236
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:28,100
Okay. Now we have a game boy find the word

1237
01:35:28,819 --> 01:35:30,819
Word scrambler. All right. Here we go

1238
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:33,380
So i'm gonna be starting writing this down. So here we go

1239
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:35,699
r

1240
01:35:35,699 --> 01:35:36,819
t

1241
01:35:36,819 --> 01:35:37,779
z

1242
01:35:37,779 --> 01:35:39,380
v s

1243
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:40,180
i

1244
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,689
Okay

1245
01:35:41,689 --> 01:35:43,449
next one p u

1246
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:46,090
y t

1247
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:48,090
m i

1248
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:51,609
Okay, before we do that one, let's see here. Um

1249
01:35:52,489 --> 01:35:55,609
V v v v it's not a v words. No s s s s

1250
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,329
Uh, bring me the third ones bring me the third ones

1251
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:02,869
The word is study

1252
01:36:02,869 --> 01:36:08,550
Done. Okay. We have uh, we have we have symbols the the weird symbols with like the the t b and the k and the

1253
01:36:09,109 --> 01:36:14,470
Okay. Okay. Yeah, we we go. I got it. I gotta go for you. All right. Holy shit. You're really good at this

1254
01:36:15,029 --> 01:36:16,390
Okay, uh

1255
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:20,710
So, uh, what are we looking at here? We're looking at the uh, the mirrored k

1256
01:36:21,930 --> 01:36:23,930
Uh the backwards p

1257
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:29,479
Um, it's dark mirrored k backwards. What is dark?

1258
01:36:30,119 --> 01:36:34,039
uh, the lights turn off mirrored k backwards p t b and then um

1259
01:36:35,319 --> 01:36:40,199
An octopus holding a okay. I I I got I got I got you the what the fuck. Okay

1260
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:47,000

Okay

1473
01:52:01,449 --> 01:52:05,449
Next we have a black wire going to a and a blue wire going to c

1474
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:10,250
Four to a the black wire cut the black wire. Okay blue wire is going to c six c

1475
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:14,489
It's the third slot and that is the first one we've seen that's the first blue wire

1476
01:52:15,699 --> 01:52:18,739
And do not cut that one skip to the next round next round

1477
01:52:19,140 --> 01:52:24,789
We have two blue wires going from seven to c and then nine to a two blues

1478
01:52:24,869 --> 01:52:29,029
The first cut the uh, wait, this is the this is the first blue wire. Yes

1479
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:34,520
No, this would be these these would be the second third blue wire second. This would be the second, right?

1480
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:40,539
This one here would be the second blue wire. Okay. Does that go to c? Yes cut that one

So we have a black and red wire next both going to c black c so the black wire

1486
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:10,600
Occurrence for black wire would be that would be the

01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:14,250
Sec the third black wire

1488
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:17,930
Does that go to b does that go to b that third black wire goes to c?

Let's get that one and the red one will be what occurrence the red wire is also going to c

1490
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:25,449
And it would be

Uh, so what are we looking at here? We are looking at first first letter just be like dot dot dash dash dot dot like in comma

1579
02:00:34,010 --> 02:00:35,850
Remember the commas

1580

1581
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:51,739
so s

1582
02:00:51,739 --> 02:00:55,020
What's the second? What's the second letter? The second letter is okay. So we have

1583
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,890
We have

1584
02:01:00,890 --> 02:01:05,500
so

1585
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:07,289
Dash

02:01:07,289 --> 02:01:09,050
It's dash

1587
02:01:09,050 --> 02:01:11,050
Yes, the dash. Okay, so st

02:01:16,199 --> 02:01:20,439
Fuck we need a third letter. Fuck. We need a third letter. We need to check third letter. We have to check third letter

1590
02:01:20,439 --> 02:01:22,039
Okay. All right. All right

1591
02:01:22,039 --> 02:01:38,920

Three five eight. Yep. All right. All right. All right, right

1594
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:52,439
Okay, uh, we have just the symbols like omega symbol a and all that shit. Okay, so we got let's kick some ass

1595
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:58,520
Let's kick some ass. All right. Here we go. So, uh, read them real quick. We have a e stitches trident upside down nine

1596
02:01:59,239 --> 02:02:02,810
Upside down. Okay, so we're gonna go upside down nine

1597
02:02:04,569 --> 02:02:06,569
And then you're gonna go stitches

1598
02:02:11,739 --> 02:02:16,579

Okay, finally finally horizontal wires with the abc one two three. Okay. Okay. Hang on. I'm almost ready. I'm almost ready

1622
02:04:19,739 --> 02:04:24,460
Okay, so, uh, what are we looking at red blue black red goes to c

1623
02:04:25,420 --> 02:04:28,140
Okay, cut cut cut red blue goes to c

1624
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:32,470
Skip that one black goes to b

1625
02:04:32,949 --> 02:04:42,250
Okay, cut that next. Yes. Okay. We have uh red black black red goes to a uh

1626
02:04:43,859 --> 02:04:45,859
Uh, does the second one go to b? Yes

1627
02:04:47,029 --> 02:04:49,909
Uh skip that one and uh the third one

1628
02:04:50,789 --> 02:04:53,909
Skip this one skip the one go to the next one. Okay, we have two black wires

1629
02:04:55,399 --> 02:04:57,399
Okay, uh, first one goes to c

1630
02:04:57,399 --> 02:05:01,960
Okay, uh the third go to a no third one goes to b two black wires third one goes to b skip that

1631
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:04,920
Okay, it's a fourth fourth one goes that's go to c. It's all three

1632
02:05:06,039 --> 02:05:16,470
Okay, skip this one. Skip this one. Fuck it. Last one is to c black wire in the middle to c

1633
02:05:17,750 --> 02:05:36,680
How many seconds we're left point two eight. Oh god

1634
02:05:37,420 --> 02:05:41,739
I don't know if I fucking nerves can take this point point two eight, uh, three tenths of a second

1635
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:47,579
Holy shit

1636
02:05:47,579 --> 02:05:49,579
That was um, that was a

1637
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:53,319
That was tricky, you know, you know what you just fucking did

1638
02:05:54,039 --> 02:05:59,720
Jerma wild guest until I got it, right you you you made a hollywood move like you did some sort of like

1639
02:06:00,199 --> 02:06:04,439
Hollywood shit where you're like you're sweating sweat coming on your face. You're like what fucking wire is it?

1640
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:06,680
Just fucking rip them all out, you know

1641
02:06:08,489 --> 02:06:09,449
Oh

1642
02:06:09,449 --> 02:06:12,409
That was wild. Hey, we beat we beat the gear check though

1643
02:06:13,369 --> 02:06:14,890
No, that's true

1644
02:06:14,890 --> 02:06:19,979
So what are we looking at now? Uh, that's why that's that's why that's the gear check because the next one

1645
02:06:20,859 --> 02:06:23,979
Uh is also five modules, but here's the difference

1646
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:27,739
It's two minutes and 30 seconds instead of five minutes

1647
02:06:31,979 --> 02:06:34,869
uh, so the exact same thing we just did but

1648
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:37,270
we have

1649
02:06:37,270 --> 02:06:39,670
50 we have a full 50 percent less time

1650
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:43,159
I wonder how the modules i'll tell you i'll tell you what though

1651
02:06:44,039 --> 02:06:45,560
Before we do that one

1652
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:49,960
Can we do another practice round by ie instead of doing the mission here?

1653
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:54,680
How about we do a free play and we clock up the time a little bit or something like that not a bad idea

1654
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:59,159
Because I feel like if we're gonna tackle a challenge like that. We need a little bit

1655
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:01,640
You know extra

1656
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:09,399
That's too much. Um, what do these mean? Well people saying it's easier. Let me see. Um, oh, it's easier modules

1657
02:07:09,560 --> 02:07:14,090
It's not hard modules. Apparently apparently it's like a bunch of really easy ones

1658
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:19,399
Yeah, they say it's not it's not hard ones. It's easy modules

1659
02:07:20,119 --> 02:07:25,000
Okay, well I think we can do that one I think we can do that one see if it just simon says shit fine

1660
02:07:25,079 --> 02:07:30,359
But when it comes down to like the wire ones the horizontal wires the occurrences fuck me up

1661
02:07:31,079 --> 02:07:33,079
the occurrences fuck me up because uh

1662
02:07:34,100 --> 02:07:36,100
Basically, i'm unsure of myself because I have to do

1663
02:07:37,279 --> 02:07:40,420
Definitive answers. I can't just say eh and I have to be like, okay

1664
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:43,380
What was it what was it and I have to just like manually think you know

1665
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:50,630
So actually hilarious that it took us about an hour and a half to do the first two or three missions in the game

1666
02:07:51,659 --> 02:07:53,500
And it's been two hours

1667
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:55,180
and we have done

1668
02:07:55,180 --> 02:08:00,789
What like eight missions? Well, uh, you know, I think we found what I really

1669
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:03,989
Uh, yeah, I think I think me being the the reading man

1670
02:08:03,989 --> 02:08:07,829
Are you being the fucking cowboy here with the bruce willis the bomb defusal shit? Yes

1671
02:08:08,229 --> 02:08:20,789
I think I think it works. All right, you ready to try this one five modules two minutes 30 seconds. All right

1672
02:08:21,659 --> 02:08:25,189
I'm ready. Okay. Hopefully they're easy. Okay

1673
02:08:30,439 --> 02:08:35,399
Regular wires there are six regular wires. How many do we have? It's six wires six wires. It's sick

1674
02:08:35,399 --> 02:08:38,439
It's mcdonald's so it's four red two yellow

1675
02:08:39,319 --> 02:08:42,199
Yellow is in the first slot red is in the last one. How many yellow do we have?

1676
02:08:42,359 --> 02:08:47,079
We have two yellows. The first wire is yellow. The last wire is red four red two yellow

1677
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:50,550
So we have okay, uh

1678
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:54,260
Otherwise, if there are no red wire cut the fourth wire fourth wire

1679
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:59,590
Okay, uh, we got pac-man pac-man. All right. So what are we looking at?

1680
02:08:59,989 --> 02:09:03,510
Uh these the two circles circle one is a five

1681
02:09:04,069 --> 02:09:06,069
Circle two is c2

1682
02:09:06,619 --> 02:09:09,340

1733
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:13,300
I've only had a few it's like somebody while the sandwich is in the wrapper

1734
02:13:13,779 --> 02:13:18,659
Put as much meat as much condiments on it as possible and then rolled it out with a fucking rolling pin

1735
02:13:19,380 --> 02:13:21,380
Jerma, can you explain hooters to me?

1736
02:13:21,899 --> 02:13:23,420

1737
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:25,670
You don't have those

1738
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:26,710
No

1739
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:32,149
Uh, it's a restaurant where it's it's a it's a restaurant that's based around can you say yes or no to this?

1740
02:13:32,710 --> 02:13:38,310
Hooters is a strip club that serves you spaghetti. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1741
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:43,930
No

1742
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:48,170
So what is the restaurant that okay? It's it's known for

1743
02:13:49,130 --> 02:13:52,970
They're and they're by the way, they're changing their name and their whole approach

1744
02:13:53,850 --> 02:13:55,850
They're changing it to like hoots now

1745
02:13:56,869 --> 02:13:58,310
Uh, it's now gonna be hoots

1746
02:13:58,310 --> 02:14:01,670
I've from what i've been told and they're going to change it

1747
02:14:01,670 --> 02:14:07,750
It's not they're not gonna have like the girls in the in like the hooters out like shirts and like sneakers and stuff

1748
02:14:08,630 --> 02:14:09,909
Okay

1749
02:14:09,909 --> 02:14:12,789
Uh, who told you this?

1750
02:14:12,789 --> 02:14:14,789
it's i'm just curious because uh

1751
02:14:15,350 --> 02:14:19,270
You know, I I see these american brands and i'm thinking what do americans think?

1752
02:14:19,350 --> 02:14:22,550
Okay, now that we played american football my good friend

1753
02:14:22,710 --> 02:14:27,189
Let us hit up hooters and eat some chicken wings with buffalo sauce my good friend

1754
02:14:27,770 --> 02:14:30,970
Well, I mean that's that's kind of like a cartoon way to look at an american

1755
02:14:31,369 --> 02:14:33,609
uh, but no, no, no

1756
02:14:34,649 --> 02:14:44,279
We roll our sandwiches out with rolling pins and um, and then we eat them covered in mayonnaise. So it's not wrong

1757
02:14:44,439 --> 02:14:46,279
It's that's wrong

1758
02:14:46,279 --> 02:14:48,279
That is wrong. I I

1759
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:54,710
Uh, I don't go to hooters. In fact, they're closing them. No, they're closing them all down

1760
02:14:55,939 --> 02:15:01,460
Okay. Well, what is what is your favorite? Uh chain restaurant in america? I'm asking this for for cultural

1761
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:12,920
Culinary knowledge exchange. That's not that's not funny in america best fast food in america. Uh, I don't know

1762
02:15:14,359 --> 02:15:17,699
I I love mcdonald's I really do

1763
02:15:18,260 --> 02:15:24,520
I actually really love mcdonald's. What's what's your favorite thing at mcdonald's? Uh, that's simple mcchicken

1764
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:27,939
Just a plain just a plain mcchicken

1765
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:34,659
Or hot or mcdoubles the mcdoubles is the fuck. How do you how do you feel? How do you feel about those sesame seed?

1766
02:15:34,819 --> 02:15:38,569
Uh regular cheeseburgers the small ones for like a dollar sure. Yeah

1767
02:15:39,909 --> 02:15:44,949
Okay, here's the thing. Those are less than a dollar sometimes when I buy games on steam on stream stuff like that

1768
02:15:44,949 --> 02:15:52,630
And it's a waste. It's a waste time and whatever I equate my losses in what how many cheeseburgers could have gotten at mcdonald's

1769
02:15:52,869 --> 02:15:58,680
Versus buying this game. So standard mcdonald's cheeseburger is like probably the best one. Yeah for sure

1770
02:16:00,470 --> 02:16:06,699
Well, why the fuck are we talking about? We should be solving. Sorry. Well, it's a nice little segue mcdonald's is I guess but it's good

1771
02:16:07,979 --> 02:16:14,310
But i'll tell you what i'll tell you what, um, what is the worst place to go if you're hungry on a fast food situation

1772
02:16:14,710 --> 02:16:19,899
Burger king is terrible. Really burger king is dog shit like taco bell. Somebody said taco bell

1773
02:16:20,380 --> 02:16:23,260
Taco bell is like one of my favorite places but burger king sucks

1774
02:16:24,220 --> 02:16:30,060
Doesn't burger king have that like, you know, they had a commercial with return of the mac, you know burger king mac and cheetos

1775
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:33,340
Whatever. Um, yeah, but you eat one and then you go

1776
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:35,180
That was kind of good and you eat a second one and you go

1777
02:16:35,180 --> 02:16:40,920
I don't want these ever again and you don't order them ever again burger king has this thing where they make a menu item

1778
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:45,100
That you will order once and never fucking order ever again. It's half their menu

1779
02:16:45,909 --> 02:16:47,909
I got like the chicken cheetos

1780
02:16:47,909 --> 02:16:53,829
The chicken fries the cheetos fries the cheese the mac and cheese bombs you eat it once and you never fucking order it again

1781
02:16:53,829 --> 02:16:57,639
Half the menu goes uneaten germa germa. I just thought of something amazing

1782
02:16:58,120 --> 02:17:03,930
I've been talking about something on stream for years hard attack grill. You live in vegas now

1783
02:17:04,090 --> 02:17:10,389
Yes, do you know about this do you weigh over 350 pounds do I sound like I do I don't know

1784
02:17:11,030 --> 02:17:17,340
No, if you eat if you weigh over 350 pounds

1785
02:17:18,139 --> 02:17:21,899
You eat everything for free at the hard attack grill in las vegas

1786
02:17:22,629 --> 02:17:26,309
It is free germa your meal is have you ever been there? Have you ever been there?

1787
02:17:26,389 --> 02:17:31,510
I have never been to I have walked by it many times, but I have never been inside the restaurant

1788
02:17:32,389 --> 02:17:34,389
I'll tell you what i'll tell you what

1789
02:17:34,860 --> 02:17:39,420
Uh, this is this is a question you come to vegas you want you want to get weighed and go to the hard attack grill

1790
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:44,819

1791
02:17:44,819 --> 02:17:46,700
But i'll ask you guys a question

1792
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:49,500
Would it not be the best thing ever to see germa?

1793
02:17:49,899 --> 02:17:55,270
Just go and eat at a hard attack grill put him in one of those like surgical dresses and just like

1794
02:17:55,670 --> 02:17:59,430
Eat onion rings until he has a coma, you know, I can eat I can eat a lot though

1795
02:17:59,430 --> 02:18:03,430
That's the thing people get surprised whenever they whenever I eat food around people. Okay, mr

1796
02:18:03,430 --> 02:18:07,510
Big shove i'll tell you what let's put your your your your money where your mouth is

1797
02:18:07,909 --> 02:18:10,790
Let's head down to hard attack grill and let's obliterate

1798
02:18:11,510 --> 02:18:16,709
15 plates of fries and let's see who truly is a gamer you ready?

1799
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:22,760
Maybe not now, but I at some point I can eat a lot of food. I can eat a lot of food

1800
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:25,719
I told you my order everybody everybody in my chat knows the order

1801
02:18:26,219 --> 02:18:28,860
They know my order and they think it's a joke and i've told it's

1802
02:18:29,659 --> 02:18:35,899
A big mac number one like two mcchickens and two double cheeseburgers and I eat it every time in a large fry and a large soda

1803
02:18:38,489 --> 02:18:43,110
And the large soda. Yes an extra dip extra dip. Anyway

1804
02:18:44,389 --> 02:18:47,670
Don't worry about it. Anyway, my point being i'll tell you what do you want to do?

1805
02:18:47,909 --> 02:18:51,190
Uh a wager here. Do you want to do a little bet? You don't want to do this?

1806
02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:54,549
I'm telling you i'm just trying to be honest with you. Don't want to do this. You really don't know

1807
02:18:55,350 --> 02:19:00,469
Germa germa, how about this here's a proposal you made the friends of mine call me friends of mine call me the bird

1808
02:19:01,430 --> 02:19:05,110
Because they can't understand how I eat like six times my body weight

1809
02:19:05,430 --> 02:19:08,950
They're like you fucking bird and I i'm like what are you talking about?

1810
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:13,510
I I I just pictured you like vomiting into your friend's mouth after you've been eating so much

1811
02:19:14,229 --> 02:19:18,549
I don't know why the fuck whatever the point being I have a bet for you. I have a bet for you

1812
02:19:18,629 --> 02:19:23,700
Okay, uh, i'll hear it and you may decline and there's nothing nothing bad about it

1813
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:28,329
That if we can solve the next bomb even though we've been challenged at this

1814
02:19:29,260 --> 02:19:33,979
You will at some point as a joke or whatever it is go to heart attack grill

1815
02:19:34,059 --> 02:19:36,780
You don't have to overeat just go there and be like

1816
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:41,899
Just be a patron of the heart attack grill just show them the world

1817

Do I have to stream going to the heart attack grill?

1818
02:19:45,899 --> 02:19:51,899
No, you can film it or do whatever you want just just to be like I have the privilege of living in in elvist town

1821
02:20:01,209 --> 02:20:07,059
But if we win, but if we take his ass and eat if we win or how about this?

1822
02:20:07,540 --> 02:20:13,879
This sounds like a losing scenario. Like if you lose you have to do this. Okay. Well, okay

1823
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:20,069
But here's the thing we are guaranteed to lose i'm saying if by some chance we and we have to play

1824
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:26,280
Okay, but if we win you have to just eat an elvis burger

1825

2045
02:37:10,489 --> 02:37:12,389
Yes

2046
02:37:12,389 --> 02:37:20,620
Cut the last red wire the last red wire. Okay. We have another set of wires. Just regular wires. There are six

2047
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:23,399
Okay

2048
02:37:23,399 --> 02:37:24,819
six

2049
02:37:24,819 --> 02:37:27,940
Okay, are there any yellow wires? There are two yellow wires

2050
02:37:28,739 --> 02:37:33,670
Okay, there are also two blue wires

2051
02:37:34,229 --> 02:37:36,229
One red and one black

2052
02:37:36,549 --> 02:37:39,190
Are there no red wires? There is one red wire

2053
02:37:40,090 --> 02:37:43,030
Cut the fourth wire

2054
02:37:43,270 --> 02:37:46,090
We have a number sequence here of my favorite

2055
02:37:47,700 --> 02:37:50,600
The number is three

2056
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:52,600
Press the button in the third position

2057
02:37:57,299 --> 02:37:59,129
two

2058
02:37:59,129 --> 02:38:02,250
Press the button in the same position as you press the stage one

2059
02:38:07,370 --> 02:38:09,219
three

2060
02:38:09,219 --> 02:38:11,219
Press the button in the third position

2061
02:38:15,209 --> 02:38:16,170
three

2062
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:20,120
Press the button in the same position as you pressed in stage two

2063
02:38:20,840 --> 02:38:25,659
and finally four

2064
02:38:25,659 --> 02:38:28,459
Press the button with the same label you pressed in stage three

2065
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:36,790
Now i'm gonna ask you chat

2066
02:38:37,030 --> 02:38:39,340
Was was that on me?

2067
02:38:39,340 --> 02:38:42,299
Was it on germa? No, I I there were all three

2068
02:38:42,860 --> 02:38:45,579
What when did I press something? It was three. It was three like three times

2069
02:38:46,459 --> 02:38:48,540
Okay, I i've deducted something

2070
02:38:49,180 --> 02:38:51,659
Our weakness and strength we are you are

2071
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:53,979

at the password

2073
02:38:56,219 --> 02:38:59,979
But the memory thing it's not even memory. It's remembering

2074
02:39:01,180 --> 02:39:06,620
So it's four numbers that you have to remember out of order and then like the position in the labels

2075
02:39:07,100 --> 02:39:08,059
I can't do it

2076
02:39:08,059 --> 02:39:11,819
I ate captain crunch every day when I was like from eight to fucking 14

2077
02:39:12,139 --> 02:39:15,739
So like I don't have the capability to remember that shit germa. What what did you just say?

2078
02:39:16,860 --> 02:39:20,920
It's not memory. It's

2098
02:40:33,559 --> 02:40:36,760
There are no yellow wires and the last date of the serial number is odd to cut the third wire

2099
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:43,000
Which you're not going to do. No, there are six wires and there's one white three red. Exactly. There's no yellow wires

2100
02:40:46,459 --> 02:40:47,739

What what are we looking at? The number is three

2106
02:41:07,899 --> 02:41:11,739
Press the button in the third position

2107
02:41:11,819 --> 02:41:14,780
Third position is the number one third. Okay one

02:41:22,120 --> 02:41:24,120
Press the button in the first position

2110
02:41:24,200 --> 02:41:30,219
Would it help if you wrote this down? Maybe I don't know one. I can't write shit down

2111
02:41:31,020 --> 02:41:35,260
The number is the button with the same label you press in stage two the same label and press the stage two

2112

02:45:50,360 --> 02:45:53,239
Would you like to take a small break? You want to take a pee break?

2176
02:45:54,780 --> 02:45:56,540

We do have one more, this is like the boss coming up here.

2179
02:46:03,899 --> 02:46:06,379
Okay, let's clear for the night.

2180
02:46:06,379 --> 02:46:10,299
But first of all, I need to take this like damn burst, right?

2181
02:46:10,299 --> 02:46:12,780
Yeah, let's take like a few minute break.

2182
02:46:12,780 --> 02:46:14,299
We'll come back and we'll beat the boss.

2183
02:46:14,299 --> 02:46:15,139
Okay.

2184
02:48:47,110 --> 02:48:49,290
All right.

2185
02:48:49,290 --> 02:48:50,129
I'm back.

2186
02:48:50,129 --> 02:48:51,489
Oh wow, perfect timing.

2187
02:48:51,489 --> 02:48:53,729
That was, we must've been completely on cue.

2188
02:48:55,540 --> 02:48:56,739
Our PP is in sync.

2189
02:48:56,739 --> 02:48:58,700
That was kind of strange actually.

2190
02:49:00,209 --> 02:49:01,409
Odd.

2191
02:49:01,409 --> 02:49:06,780
Anyway, let us do this last one, man.

2192
02:49:06,979 --> 02:49:07,819
Let's see if we can do it.

2193
02:49:07,819 --> 02:49:09,500
This one's the big one.

2194
02:49:09,500 --> 02:49:11,159
This is the big one.

2195
02:49:11,159 --> 02:49:13,540
All right.

2196
02:49:13,540 --> 02:49:15,219
This is eight minutes.

2197
02:49:16,979 --> 02:49:19,979
We have eight modules and it's gonna take eight minutes.

2198
02:49:19,979 --> 02:49:21,340
It says, take your time, relax.

2199
02:49:21,340 --> 02:49:22,739
Then it says, don't relax.

2200
02:49:22,739 --> 02:49:27,559
If we can do this in one minute each, no problem.

2201
02:49:27,559 --> 02:49:28,799
The bomb tend to stream.

2202
02:49:29,860 --> 02:49:30,979
There's no stakes here.

2203
02:49:30,979 --> 02:49:31,819
It's just a matter of,

2204
02:49:31,819 --> 02:49:34,299
can we clear this monstrosity, you know?

2205
02:49:34,299 --> 02:49:35,700
All right, if we beat this,

2206
02:49:36,780 --> 02:49:38,940
if we beat this first try,

2207
02:49:38,940 --> 02:49:46,110
then all we have to do is when you visit Las Vegas,

2208
02:49:46,110 --> 02:49:47,190
we have to take a picture

2209
02:49:47,190 --> 02:49:49,670
in front of like the Bellagio fountain.

2210
02:49:49,670 --> 02:49:50,989
You're cutting out what?

2211
02:49:50,989 --> 02:49:53,430
I said, okay, if we do this one first try,

2212
02:49:53,430 --> 02:49:55,270
then when you come to Vegas,

2213
02:49:55,270 --> 02:49:57,069
all we have to do is take a picture

2214
02:49:57,069 --> 02:50:00,270
in front of the Bellagio fountain.

2215
02:50:00,270 --> 02:50:01,590
The Bellagio fountain, what?

2216
02:50:01,590 --> 02:50:04,360
Yeah, it's like a tourist place.

2217
02:50:05,159 --> 02:50:07,319
There's a big, big, big connotation here.

2218
02:50:07,319 --> 02:50:09,040
When I come?

2219
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:10,440
Yeah.

2220
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:12,260
When I come?

2221
02:50:12,260 --> 02:50:14,209
You don't wanna come?

2222
02:50:14,209 --> 02:50:15,610
I'd love to come.

2223
02:50:15,610 --> 02:50:16,770
I'd love to come.

2224
02:50:16,770 --> 02:50:17,610
There he's going.

2225
02:50:17,610 --> 02:50:20,370
But, but, but, all right, okay, I was,

2226
02:50:20,370 --> 02:50:24,379
okay, yeah, I'll go to the fountain, man.

2227
02:50:24,379 --> 02:50:26,469
You gotta beat the first try, though.

2228
02:50:26,469 --> 02:50:28,709
All right, yeah, absolutely, absolutely, man.

2229
02:50:28,709 --> 02:50:32,719
Yeah, I'm brockin' raw McDonald's.

2230
02:50:32,719 --> 02:50:35,040
Eight modules, let's go.

2231
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:39,510
We have Morse code.

2232
02:50:39,510 --> 02:50:41,629
Morse code, all right, let's see here.

2233
02:50:41,629 --> 02:50:42,510
We gotta quickly do this.

2234
02:50:42,510 --> 02:50:43,629
Let's not fuck around for this one.

2235
02:50:43,629 --> 02:50:44,950
All right, so the first letter is,

2236
02:50:44,950 --> 02:50:46,870
let me, you know, the usual shit.

2237
02:50:46,870 --> 02:50:48,579
Usual shit, okay.

2238
02:50:48,579 --> 02:50:56,950
And he's like dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dash.

2239
02:50:56,950 --> 02:51:01,090
So dot, dot, dot, dot, dash.

2240
02:51:01,090 --> 02:51:06,500
So the first one, dot, dot, dot, comma, dot, dash.

2241
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:07,620
No, it can't be that.

2242
02:51:07,620 --> 02:51:09,860
Then it would be sa, sa.

2243
02:51:09,860 --> 02:51:13,239
I don't have any sas, do I?

2244
02:51:13,239 --> 02:51:14,559
No, that can't be right, man.

2245
02:51:14,559 --> 02:51:16,700
Is that a correct call?

2246
02:51:16,700 --> 02:51:25,780
No.

2247
02:51:25,780 --> 02:51:31,590
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dash, dot, dot, okay.

2248
02:51:31,629 --> 02:51:35,649
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dash, dot, dot.

2249
02:51:35,649 --> 02:51:43,469
So dot, dot, dot, comma, dot, dash, dot, dot.

2250
02:51:43,469 --> 02:51:51,290
Dot, dot, dot, comma, dot, dash, dot, dot.

2251
02:51:51,290 --> 02:51:55,139
It's three, five, two, two.

2252
02:51:55,139 --> 02:51:58,139
All right, we have the horizontal cut the wires thing.

2253
02:51:58,139 --> 02:51:58,979
We're gonna do this twice in a row.

2254
02:51:58,979 --> 02:51:59,819
Complicated bullshit.

2255
02:51:59,819 --> 02:52:01,620
Complicated bullshit, we have plenty of time to do this,

2256
02:52:01,620 --> 02:52:02,459
but we're gonna do this two of them.

2257
02:52:02,459 --> 02:52:04,469
Okay, let's go, here we go.

2258
02:52:04,469 --> 02:52:05,430
So what are we lookin' at?

2259
02:52:05,430 --> 02:52:11,459
Two blue wires, blue, blue, both going into A.

2260
02:52:11,459 --> 02:52:12,860
Those two go to A.

2261
02:52:12,860 --> 02:52:14,190
Yes.

2262
02:52:14,190 --> 02:52:15,590
Cut that one.

2263
02:52:15,590 --> 02:52:16,780
Cut it?

2264
02:52:16,780 --> 02:52:18,440
Next one.

2265
02:52:18,440 --> 02:52:20,500
Okay, we have another blue wire.

2266
02:52:20,500 --> 02:52:24,059
This one is going to A in the third slot.

2267
02:52:24,059 --> 02:52:26,020
Okay, is there any more wires on this one?

2268
02:52:26,020 --> 02:52:28,690
It's only blue.

2269
02:52:28,690 --> 02:52:30,649
Skip to the next round.

2270
02:52:30,649 --> 02:52:35,819
Okay, so this would be the fourth and fifth blue wire here,

2271
02:52:35,819 --> 02:52:37,219
so blue, blue, red.

2272
02:52:37,219 --> 02:52:39,940
So what current is on the red wire here, sorry.

2273
02:52:39,940 --> 02:52:42,940
The red wire is, yeah, this red is first,

2274
02:52:42,940 --> 02:52:44,940
and it goes to C.

2275
02:52:44,940 --> 02:52:46,290
Cut that one.

2276
02:52:46,290 --> 02:52:49,549
Okay, we also have the fourth and fifth blue wires,

2277
02:52:49,549 --> 02:52:51,680
both are going to A.

2278
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:53,000
So fourth is going to A.

2279
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:54,569
Yes.

2280
02:52:54,569 --> 02:52:55,409
Cut that one.

2281
02:52:55,409 --> 02:52:57,579
Okay.

2282
02:52:57,579 --> 02:52:59,979
And this is the fifth one, and it's going to where?

2283
02:52:59,979 --> 02:53:01,440
A.

2284
02:53:01,440 --> 02:53:03,659
Next round.

2285
02:53:03,659 --> 02:53:06,659
So we have a sixth blue wire here, it's the last one,

2286
02:53:06,659 --> 02:53:08,979
but we also have a black and red wire.

2287
02:53:08,979 --> 02:53:11,520
Black is first, it's going to C.

2288
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:12,360
Cut the blue wire.

2289
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:14,020
Is that it?

2290
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:15,579
What occurrence is the red wire at?

2291
02:53:15,579 --> 02:53:19,340
The red wire is second, and it is going to A.

2292
02:53:19,340 --> 02:53:20,540
Okay, don't bother with it.

2293
02:53:20,659 --> 02:53:21,899
And the black one is at?

2294
02:53:21,899 --> 02:53:24,260
It's going to C.

2295
02:53:24,260 --> 02:53:25,100
First spot.

2296
02:53:25,100 --> 02:53:27,219
Okay, and the current is first ever.

2297
02:53:27,219 --> 02:53:29,100
That's the first ever black wire, yes.

2298
02:53:29,100 --> 02:53:30,700
Cut the black wire.

2299
02:53:30,700 --> 02:53:31,709
Done?

2300
02:53:31,709 --> 02:53:32,549
Next one, next one.

2301
02:53:32,549 --> 02:53:33,370
Okay, that's it.

2302
02:53:33,370 --> 02:53:34,389
All right, next one.

2303
02:53:34,389 --> 02:53:36,270
Same deal, we're gonna start it over.

2304
02:53:36,270 --> 02:53:38,110
Completely fresh, same module.

2305
02:53:38,110 --> 02:53:39,709
Whenever you see the first ever,

2306
02:53:39,709 --> 02:53:41,629
just cut the black one.

2307
02:53:41,629 --> 02:53:45,340
Okay, so we have black, black, blue.

2308
02:53:45,340 --> 02:53:47,459
Yep, cut that one, cut the first one.

2309
02:53:47,459 --> 02:53:49,440
Cut the first black wire?

2310
02:53:49,440 --> 02:53:53,159
Okay, now we have a black wire going from two to B.

2311
02:53:53,719 --> 02:53:54,559
Don't bother with that.

2312
02:53:54,559 --> 02:53:55,379
Blue?

2313
02:53:55,379 --> 02:53:57,629
Blue, yes, going to A.

2314
02:53:57,629 --> 02:54:00,149
Don't cut that one, next one.

2315
02:54:00,149 --> 02:54:02,389
This is the third and fourth black wire.

2316
02:54:02,389 --> 02:54:04,430
Only black wires, there's two of them.

2317
02:54:04,430 --> 02:54:06,069
One is going to C, one's going to B.

2318
02:54:06,069 --> 02:54:07,530
Skip the first one,

2319
02:54:07,530 --> 02:54:09,649
and this will be the fourth one, right?

2320
02:54:09,649 --> 02:54:12,200
This would be the fourth one going to B.

2321
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:13,819
Okay, skip that one too.

2322
02:54:13,819 --> 02:54:17,299
Okay, only one wire on this one.

2323
02:54:17,299 --> 02:54:19,670
It is red, it's going to A.

2324
02:54:19,670 --> 02:54:21,709
And that will be our first one too.

2325
02:54:21,709 --> 02:54:24,110
That will be, that's the first red wire.

2326
02:54:24,110 --> 02:54:24,989
Yes, that's correct.

2327
02:54:24,989 --> 02:54:26,829
Okay, and that's going to?

2328
02:54:26,829 --> 02:54:28,340
A.

2329
02:54:29,709 --> 02:54:33,270
Okay, the last panel here is the fifth and sixth black wire

2330
02:54:33,270 --> 02:54:34,149
and then a blue wire.

2331
02:54:34,149 --> 02:54:37,030
So it's black, black, blue, fifth and sixth black wire.

2332
02:54:37,030 --> 02:54:38,510
Blue is going to B.

2333
02:54:38,510 --> 02:54:39,350
Is sixth going to B?

2334
02:54:39,350 --> 02:54:40,170
Is sixth going to B?

2335
02:54:40,170 --> 02:54:42,690
The last black, yes, it's going to B.

2336
02:54:42,690 --> 02:54:43,770
Cut that one.

2337
02:54:43,770 --> 02:54:45,430
Okay.

2338
02:54:45,430 --> 02:54:47,709
And the blue one was the first one we had.

2339
02:54:47,709 --> 02:54:51,909
The blue one is, the first wire here is black going to A.

2340
02:54:51,909 --> 02:54:55,030
The blue wire here is the third one going to B.

2341
02:54:55,030 --> 02:54:56,829
Okay, and it's going to B.

2342
02:54:56,829 --> 02:54:58,270
Yes, and this is, by the way,

2343
02:54:58,270 --> 02:54:59,870
this is the second blue wire.

2344
02:55:00,389 --> 02:55:02,909
So the last one is blue, cut that one.

2345
02:55:02,909 --> 02:55:04,190
Last one is blue.

2346
02:55:04,190 --> 02:55:05,590
That was incorrect, but it's okay.

2347
02:55:05,590 --> 02:55:07,590
Just go, just go, man.

2348
02:55:07,590 --> 02:55:10,049
That's it, all right, all right, Simon says.

2349
02:55:10,049 --> 02:55:13,139
Okay, Simon says, all right, here we go.

2350
02:55:13,139 --> 02:55:15,670
We have one strike, we have one strike.

2351
02:55:15,670 --> 02:55:16,790
One strike, vowel.

2352
02:55:16,790 --> 02:55:17,629
And there is a vowel.

2353
02:55:17,629 --> 02:55:20,219
We have a vowel and one strike.

2354
02:55:20,219 --> 02:55:22,100
Okay, colors.

2355
02:55:22,100 --> 02:55:24,659
What the fuck, I thought I wasn't even clicking on the,

2356
02:55:24,659 --> 02:55:26,870
you have two strikes now, sir.

2357
02:55:26,870 --> 02:55:28,010
I didn't know I was in the module.

2358
02:55:28,010 --> 02:55:28,850
Two strikes.

2359
02:55:28,850 --> 02:55:31,459
Whatever.

2360
02:55:31,459 --> 02:55:34,000
Yellow.

2361
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:39,430
Let's go, blue.

2362
02:55:39,430 --> 02:55:41,719
Yellow, blue.

2363
02:55:41,719 --> 02:55:46,319
Red.

2364
02:55:46,319 --> 02:55:50,469
Yellow, blue, red.

2365
02:55:50,469 --> 02:55:57,899
That will be blue, red, green.

2366
02:55:57,899 --> 02:56:01,909
Yellow, blue, red, red.

2367
02:56:01,909 --> 02:56:04,889
Yellow, blue, red, red.

2368
02:56:04,889 --> 02:56:11,319
Blue, red, green, green.

2369
02:56:11,319 --> 02:56:12,399
Okay, next one.

2370
02:56:12,399 --> 02:56:14,959
Now we've got a, we just got regular wires.

2371
02:56:14,959 --> 02:56:17,399
There are three wires.

2372
02:56:17,399 --> 02:56:18,219
Okay.

2373
02:56:18,219 --> 02:56:21,260
Two white, one yellow, that's it, three wires.

2374
02:56:21,260 --> 02:56:22,219
Are there no red wires?

2375
02:56:22,219 --> 02:56:23,590
No red wires.

2376
02:56:23,590 --> 02:56:25,090
Cut the second wire.

2377
02:56:25,090 --> 02:56:28,239
Okay, we have a white detonate button.

2378
02:56:28,239 --> 02:56:29,360
Okay, hang on, hang on.

2379
02:56:29,360 --> 02:56:33,540
There are more, there are two batteries.

2380
02:56:33,540 --> 02:56:34,979
Press and immediately release the bomb.

2381
02:56:34,979 --> 02:56:35,819
Press and immediately release.

2382
02:56:35,819 --> 02:56:38,260
Okay, we have Pac-Man.

2383
02:56:38,260 --> 02:56:43,000
Pac-Man, the circles, by the way, are A2 and F3.

2384
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:49,040
And then we start in A2, and we are going to B5.

2385
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:54,659
Okay, go up, right, right.

2386
02:56:54,659 --> 02:56:56,120
Yep.

2387
02:56:56,120 --> 02:56:57,569

02:57:10,760 --> 02:57:11,579
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

2398
02:57:13,170 --> 02:57:15,579

02:57:22,319 --> 02:57:23,579
Up.

2404
02:57:23,579 --> 02:57:24,420
Left, left, left.

2405
02:57:24,420 --> 02:57:25,260
Left, left, left.

2406
02:57:25,260 --> 02:57:27,360
All the way to the bottom.

2407
02:57:27,360 --> 02:57:28,200
Okay, we got up.

2408
02:57:28,200 --> 02:57:32,969
Oh.

2409
02:57:32,969 --> 02:57:34,290
How many models do we have left?

2410
02:57:34,290 --> 02:57:36,049
One after that, and it was the symbols.

2411
02:57:36,049 --> 02:57:36,889
Oh, fuck.

2412
02:57:36,889 --> 02:57:39,209
Oh, I was supposed to go guess.

2413
02:57:39,209 --> 02:57:40,290
It could have been good.

2414
02:57:40,290 --> 02:57:41,129
Oh, that was close.

2415
02:57:41,129 --> 02:57:41,969
That was so close.

2416
02:57:41,969 --> 02:57:43,290
I got confused there for a second.

2417
02:57:43,290 --> 02:57:45,850
No, I fucking, no, it was because when I clicked,

2418
02:57:45,850 --> 02:57:47,329
I thought I wasn't clicked in a module,

2419
02:57:47,329 --> 02:57:49,479
and I made it speed up faster.

2420
02:57:49,479 --> 02:57:51,440
I was like trying to click into the module,

2421
02:57:51,440 --> 02:57:53,959
and I thought I was already in there.

2422
02:57:53,959 --> 02:57:55,440
All right, let's go, let's go, we got it.

2423
02:57:55,639 --> 02:57:59,159
That was, you know, possibilities are there, you know.

We're good, we almost had it, first try.

2425
02:58:01,399 --> 02:58:04,479
Too bad you're not coming to make it.

2426
02:58:04,479 --> 02:58:08,479
Okay, we got a word, just a jumbler thing.

Like what, what with a question mark?

03:02:09,219 --> 03:02:13,000
sleepy three, star that doesn't have a failed end

2495
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:13,840
and mirrored K.

2496
03:02:13,840 --> 03:02:15,079
Stop, what are you eating, what are you eating?

2497
03:02:15,079 --> 03:02:16,399
Sorry, it's developed.

2498
03:02:16,399 --> 03:02:18,760
Copyright, sleepy three, star with no filling

2500
03:02:20,639 --> 03:02:28,340
Copyright, then we'll be looking at the weird X.

2501
03:02:28,340 --> 03:02:29,629
Sleepy three.

2502
03:02:29,870 --> 03:02:33,569
Okay, we have a red button that says abort.

2503
03:02:33,569 --> 03:02:37,659
Okay, hang on, hang on.

2504
03:02:37,659 --> 03:02:41,739
By the way, there are three batteries.

2505
03:02:41,739 --> 03:02:43,219
Red button, abort.

2506
03:02:43,219 --> 03:02:44,899
Lit indicator with FRK?

2507
03:02:44,899 --> 03:02:47,979
Lit indicator with FRK on it.

2508
03:02:47,979 --> 03:02:50,819
There is no lit indicator with FRK on it.

2509
03:02:50,819 --> 03:02:52,100
Hold it down, hold it down, hold it down.

2510
03:02:52,100 --> 03:02:55,299
Holding it down, we have white flashes.

2511
03:02:55,299 --> 03:02:57,870
One in any position, one in any position.

2512
03:02:57,870 --> 03:03:03,420
Okay, we have regular wires here, regular wires.

2513
03:03:03,420 --> 03:03:10,530
We have five, two red, one white, blue and black.

2514
03:03:10,530 --> 03:03:14,020
Five wires.

2515
03:03:14,020 --> 03:03:14,979
No black wires?

2516
03:03:14,979 --> 03:03:17,590
There's one black wire, it's the last one.

2517
03:03:17,590 --> 03:03:18,430
But the first wire.

2518
03:03:18,430 --> 03:03:21,770
But the first wire, that's not correct.

2519
03:03:21,770 --> 03:03:22,610
Shit.

2520
03:03:22,610 --> 03:03:27,340
We have five wires, two red, one white,

2521
03:03:27,340 --> 03:03:28,899
one blue, one black.

2522
03:03:28,899 --> 03:03:29,860
Cut the third wire.

2523
03:03:29,860 --> 03:03:31,959
The third wire, look at that.

2524
03:03:31,959 --> 03:03:33,159
Fuck, I took a chance.

2525
03:03:33,159 --> 03:03:34,799
I took a chance, I don't wanna speak.

2526
03:03:34,799 --> 03:03:42,389
Basically, I had a chance there to go, oh my God.

2527
03:03:42,389 --> 03:03:43,629
Shit, that was close.

2528
03:03:43,629 --> 03:03:46,819
I did such a bad mistake there.

2529
03:03:46,819 --> 03:03:48,420
Was it what we did, serial numbers?

2530
03:03:48,459 --> 03:03:50,299
Totally on me, the stress got to me.

2531
03:03:50,299 --> 03:03:53,090
Gambling with your life.

2532
03:03:53,090 --> 03:03:55,049
God, I'm sorry, I'm super sorry.

2533
03:03:55,049 --> 03:03:57,290
Hey, hey, it's all right, it's all right.

2534
03:03:57,290 --> 03:03:59,170
That was an easy mistake to make, it was.

2535
03:03:59,170 --> 03:04:00,010
It's hard.

2536
03:04:00,010 --> 03:04:00,850
This game's not easy.

2537
03:04:00,850 --> 03:04:03,739
All right, this game is boss.

2538
03:04:03,739 --> 03:04:04,579
Here we go.

2539
03:04:04,579 --> 03:04:05,420
All right, here we go.

2540
03:04:05,420 --> 03:04:06,579
Let's kick some ass.

2541
03:04:06,579 --> 03:04:07,540
We'll go quick on this one.

2542
03:04:07,540 --> 03:04:08,379
Bang, bang it out.

2543
03:04:08,379 --> 03:04:11,870
Look out, we got, Simon says.

2544
03:04:11,870 --> 03:04:13,549
Simon says, Simon says, here we go.

2545
03:04:13,549 --> 03:04:14,709
By the way, there is a vowel.

2546
03:04:14,709 --> 03:04:16,469
Simon says with a vowel.

2547
03:04:16,469 --> 03:04:19,700
Okay, so, and we got no strikes, obviously.

2548
03:04:19,700 --> 03:04:20,659
What color do we have?

2549
03:04:20,659 --> 03:04:22,059
Green.

2550
03:04:22,059 --> 03:04:26,020
Yellow.

2551
03:04:26,020 --> 03:04:28,170
Green, red.

2552
03:04:28,170 --> 03:04:29,569
Yellow, red.

2553
03:04:31,459 --> 03:04:32,299
We have one strike.

2554
03:04:32,299 --> 03:04:33,940
Fuck, I'm sorry, we have a strike now.

2555
03:04:33,940 --> 03:04:34,780
Fuck, whatever.

2556
03:04:34,780 --> 03:04:38,770
Restore, restore.

2557
03:04:38,770 --> 03:04:41,370
You all did it for the absolute, ah, fuck it, fuck it.

2558
03:04:41,370 --> 03:04:42,209
Smash it.

2559
03:04:42,209 --> 03:04:44,659
Toy on the lives, man.

2560
03:04:44,659 --> 03:04:45,500
All right, here we go.

2561
03:04:45,500 --> 03:04:46,340
That was quick.

2562
03:04:46,340 --> 03:04:47,739
When you're exhausted, and if you're doing this

2563
03:04:47,739 --> 03:04:50,299
for a couple hours, you start to do really stupid mistakes.

2564
03:04:50,299 --> 03:04:51,139
Did you see what I was doing

2565
03:04:51,139 --> 03:04:53,620
with the number sequence bullshit?

2566
03:04:53,620 --> 03:04:54,540
Okay, here we go.

2567
03:04:54,540 --> 03:04:58,540
Force code, dot, dot, dot, dot.

2568
03:04:58,540 --> 03:05:00,139
Okay, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

2569
03:05:00,139 --> 03:05:00,979
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

2570
03:05:00,979 --> 03:05:02,250
Four, three.

2571
03:05:02,250 --> 03:05:04,209
Three, four, three?

2572
03:05:04,209 --> 03:05:05,049
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2573
03:05:05,049 --> 03:05:05,870
How many more are there?

2574
03:05:05,870 --> 03:05:07,520
How many more are there?

2575
03:05:07,520 --> 03:05:08,360
Four.

2576
03:05:08,360 --> 03:05:10,260
Four, okay, so we're gonna, H, H.

2577
03:05:10,260 --> 03:05:11,780
See, it's a two and eight.

2578
03:05:11,780 --> 03:05:13,739
We are looking at three, five, oh, five.

2579
03:05:13,739 --> 03:05:14,940
Three, five, oh, five.

2580
03:05:14,940 --> 03:05:15,760
Got it?

2581
03:05:15,760 --> 03:05:16,600
Three, five, no!

2582
03:05:16,600 --> 03:05:17,940
Got it, yes, yes, yes.

2583
03:05:17,940 --> 03:05:18,760
Got it, Pac-Man.

2584
03:05:18,760 --> 03:05:21,040
Okay, we are looking at, what are we looking at?

2585
03:05:21,040 --> 03:05:21,879
What are we looking at?

2586
03:05:21,879 --> 03:05:26,440
We are looking at, you've got C, four,

2587
03:05:26,440 --> 03:05:31,110
is one of the circles, and D, one is the other circle.

2588
03:05:31,110 --> 03:05:33,750
The starting position is D, four,

2589
03:05:33,750 --> 03:05:39,069
is my starting position, and we're trying to go to F, two.

2590
03:05:39,069 --> 03:05:41,149
I start in D, four, we're going to F, two.

2591
03:05:41,149 --> 03:05:43,469
Oh, okay, okay, right, right?

2592
03:05:43,469 --> 03:05:44,309
Yep.

2593
03:05:44,309 --> 03:05:45,649
Up, up.

2594
03:05:45,649 --> 03:05:46,469
Done, okay.

2595
03:05:46,469 --> 03:05:47,309
All the way up.

2596
03:05:47,309 --> 03:05:51,420
Yep, we got, all right, so we got you, your, uh, uh-huh.

2597
03:05:51,420 --> 03:05:53,899
Okay, okay, gotcha, gotcha, let me just.

2598
03:05:53,899 --> 03:05:55,420
Okay, so we go, what word is it, what word is it?

2599
03:05:55,420 --> 03:05:57,979
The word is blank, like a blank space.

2600
03:05:57,979 --> 03:06:00,059
Read me, read me middle right.

2601
03:06:00,059 --> 03:06:01,340
Middle right is,

2602
03:06:03,940 --> 03:06:07,360
your, you are, just your, you are.

2603
03:06:07,360 --> 03:06:08,200
And then two letters.

2604
03:06:08,319 --> 03:06:10,120
Just two letters, just you are, your.

2605
03:06:10,120 --> 03:06:14,239
Done, the letter U, you are.

2606
03:06:14,239 --> 03:06:18,000
Got it, next word is, U, space, R.

2607
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:19,399
U, space, R.

2608
03:06:19,399 --> 03:06:21,120
Bottom right, read me bottom right.

2609
03:06:21,120 --> 03:06:23,639
Is what without a question mark, just what.

2610
03:06:23,639 --> 03:06:24,479
Without a question mark.

2611
03:06:24,479 --> 03:06:25,639
No question mark.

2612
03:06:25,639 --> 03:06:30,639
U, H, H, H, what, letters, left, nothing, ready.

2613
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:33,079
Hey, nothing?

2614
03:06:33,079 --> 03:06:36,079
What, that wasn't correct?

2615
03:06:36,079 --> 03:06:36,920
The fuck?

2616
03:06:36,920 --> 03:06:40,000
Whatever.

2617
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:41,399
So, read me this new one.

2618
03:06:41,399 --> 03:06:44,360
Your, it's an apostrophe, like you are, your,

2619
03:06:44,360 --> 03:06:45,719
an apostrophe, like you are.

2620
03:06:45,719 --> 03:06:47,479
Read me, read me middle right.

2621
03:06:47,479 --> 03:06:51,799
Middle right is right, R-I-G-T-H, R-I-G-H-T.

2622
03:06:51,799 --> 03:06:54,840
Okay, uh, yes, nothing.

2623
03:06:54,840 --> 03:06:55,680
Got it, done?

2624
03:06:55,680 --> 03:06:58,559
Ready, okay, gotcha.

2625
03:06:58,559 --> 03:07:03,139
Again, you are, your, with an apostrophe, your.

2626
03:07:03,139 --> 03:07:06,180
Okay, read me middle right.

2627
03:07:06,180 --> 03:07:12,319
Like, L-I-K-E.

2628
03:07:12,680 --> 03:07:14,639
Your, with an apostrophe.

2629
03:07:14,639 --> 03:07:19,159
Next, the letter U, two letters, U-R.

2630
03:07:19,159 --> 03:07:21,920
You, so U, like you are, letters?

2631
03:07:21,920 --> 03:07:22,799
Yes, yes.

2632
03:07:22,799 --> 03:07:24,280
Got it, okay, done?

2633
03:07:24,280 --> 03:07:25,120
Moving on.

2634
03:07:25,120 --> 03:07:27,680
We have symbols, like omega, half-life, okay.

2635
03:07:27,680 --> 03:07:30,520
So, okay, reset, here we go.

2636
03:07:30,520 --> 03:07:35,239
Half-life symbol, lightning bolt, curse of H,

2637
03:07:35,239 --> 03:07:38,159
and a backwards C with a dot in the middle.

2638
03:07:38,159 --> 03:07:39,889
Okay, half-life?

2639
03:07:39,889 --> 03:07:40,729
Yep.

2640
03:07:40,729 --> 03:07:41,549
Lightning.

2641
03:07:41,549 --> 03:07:42,629
Yep.

2642
03:07:43,549 --> 03:07:44,389
Got it, done.

2643
03:07:44,389 --> 03:07:45,209
Copyright.

2644
03:07:45,209 --> 03:07:46,760
We have a second Pac-Man.

2645
03:07:46,760 --> 03:07:48,239
Okay, second Pac-Man, okay.

2646
03:07:48,239 --> 03:07:49,360
What are we starting at?

2647
03:07:49,360 --> 03:07:54,120
So we have D-four and F-four are the circles,

2648
03:07:54,120 --> 03:07:55,600
and we're starting at F-two.

2649
03:07:55,600 --> 03:07:58,159
We need to get to D-six.

2650
03:07:58,159 --> 03:08:00,719
Spam the bottom, spam to the bottom, spam to the bottom.

2651
03:08:00,719 --> 03:08:01,559
Done.

2652
03:08:01,559 --> 03:08:02,379
Left?

2653
03:08:02,379 --> 03:08:04,040
Yep.

2654
03:08:04,040 --> 03:08:06,670
Up, up, up, left?

2655
03:08:06,670 --> 03:08:07,510
Yep.

2656
03:08:07,510 --> 03:08:08,430
All the way down.

2657
03:08:08,430 --> 03:08:09,270
Done.

2658
03:08:09,270 --> 03:08:10,950
We have a red button that says hold,

2659
03:08:10,950 --> 03:08:12,030
red button that says hold.

2660
03:08:12,030 --> 03:08:16,979
By the way, there are two batteries.

2661
03:08:16,979 --> 03:08:18,760
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2662
03:08:18,760 --> 03:08:21,750
Red button that says hold.

2663
03:08:21,750 --> 03:08:23,030
Two batteries.

2664
03:08:23,030 --> 03:08:24,870
Okay, hang on, there are two more batteries

2665
03:08:24,870 --> 03:08:26,950
and there's a little kid.

2666
03:08:26,950 --> 03:08:29,110
If the button's red and the button says hold, right?

2667
03:08:29,110 --> 03:08:30,030
Mm-hmm, yes.

2668
03:08:30,030 --> 03:08:32,069
Press immediately release.

2669
03:08:32,069 --> 03:08:33,270
Good, over.

2670
03:08:33,270 --> 03:08:34,989
Regular wires.

2671
03:08:34,989 --> 03:08:35,829
Yeah.

2672
03:08:35,829 --> 03:08:39,309
Six wires.

2673
03:08:39,309 --> 03:08:41,260
Two white.

2674
03:08:41,260 --> 03:08:42,100
One blue.

2675
03:08:42,100 --> 03:08:43,299
It's exactly one yellow wire

2676
03:08:43,299 --> 03:08:45,219
and there's more than one.

2677
03:08:45,219 --> 03:08:46,840
So there is one yellow wire

2678
03:08:47,360 --> 03:08:48,399
and there are two white wires.

2679
03:08:48,399 --> 03:08:49,520
And that's the only thing that has,

2680
03:08:49,520 --> 03:08:50,360
white's the only thing that has more than one.

2681
03:08:50,360 --> 03:08:51,319
Exactly one yellow wire

2682
03:08:51,319 --> 03:08:52,879
and there are more than one white wire.

2683
03:08:52,879 --> 03:08:54,040
Yes.

2684
03:08:54,040 --> 03:08:55,040
Cut the fourth wire.

2685
03:08:56,510 --> 03:08:57,350
Done.

2686
03:08:57,350 --> 03:08:59,510
Okay, now we've got a complicated one.

2687
03:08:59,510 --> 03:09:02,229
It's the sidewards horizontal complex wires one.

2688
03:09:02,229 --> 03:09:03,670
Okay, let's kick some ass at this one.

2689
03:09:03,670 --> 03:09:04,510
Let's kick some ass.

2690
03:09:04,510 --> 03:09:05,430
Here we go.

2691
03:09:05,430 --> 03:09:08,549
All right, so red, red, first one is going to.

2692
03:09:08,549 --> 03:09:11,770
Red, red is the first wire, it's going to C.

2693
03:09:11,770 --> 03:09:12,829
Cut it.

2694
03:09:12,829 --> 03:09:14,430
Blue is the second wire, it's going to B.

2695
03:09:14,430 --> 03:09:16,790
It's in the third slot, so three to B.

2696
03:09:17,469 --> 03:09:18,309
Cut it.

2697
03:09:18,309 --> 03:09:19,149
No, no, no, no, no.

2698
03:09:19,149 --> 03:09:20,829
I just, I did, I cut it.

2699
03:09:20,829 --> 03:09:22,399
Okay, sorry.

2700
03:09:22,399 --> 03:09:23,239
Good, go.

2701
03:09:23,239 --> 03:09:24,079
Next one, next one, next one.

2702
03:09:24,079 --> 03:09:24,920
Okay, next one.

2703
03:09:24,920 --> 03:09:27,559
We have our second red wire and second blue wire

2704
03:09:27,559 --> 03:09:28,879
but our first black wire here.

2705
03:09:28,879 --> 03:09:31,600
So the first red wire is going to C.

2706
03:09:31,600 --> 03:09:32,659
Cut the black wire.

2707
03:09:32,659 --> 03:09:33,760
Cut the black wire, okay.

2708
03:09:33,760 --> 03:09:36,319
The blue one, the blue one is the second one, right?

2709
03:09:36,319 --> 03:09:37,600
Or the first one, first one, right?

2710
03:09:37,600 --> 03:09:40,680
The blue one is the second wire.

2711
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:41,959
No, no, no, the blue one.

2712
03:09:41,959 --> 03:09:43,879
The blue one is the third wire, I believe,

2713
03:09:43,879 --> 03:09:45,520
of this sequence here.

2714
03:09:45,520 --> 03:09:47,559
Okay, is it the first occurrence we see in blue?

2715
03:09:47,559 --> 03:09:48,379
It's the first blue we see.

2716
03:09:48,379 --> 03:09:50,059
No, this is the second time we've seen a blue wire.

2717
03:09:50,059 --> 03:09:50,899
It's going from five to C.

2718
03:09:50,899 --> 03:09:51,719
Is it going to C?

2719
03:09:51,719 --> 03:09:52,559
Yes, it is.

2720
03:09:52,559 --> 03:09:53,379
Is it going to C?

2721
03:09:53,379 --> 03:09:54,219
Cut it.

2722
03:09:54,219 --> 03:09:55,500
Yes.

2723
03:09:55,500 --> 03:09:56,420
Yes.

2724
03:09:56,420 --> 03:09:57,620
Keep going?

2725
03:09:57,620 --> 03:09:58,500
Yes.

2726
03:09:58,500 --> 03:10:03,440
Okay, here we have our third blue wire and two black wires.

2727
03:10:03,440 --> 03:10:06,639
Is it going to B or A?

2728
03:10:06,639 --> 03:10:08,959
It's going to C, the blue wire is going to C.

2729
03:10:08,959 --> 03:10:09,799
Third time we see.

2730
03:10:09,799 --> 03:10:11,120
Ignore that, ignore that one, ignore that one.

2731
03:10:11,120 --> 03:10:13,559
Two black wires, one going to B, one going to C.

2732
03:10:14,399 --> 03:10:16,040
And this will be the second black wire, right?

2733
03:10:16,040 --> 03:10:18,680
This would be the, let's see.

2734
03:10:18,680 --> 03:10:21,020
This is the second and third black wire here.

2735
03:10:22,700 --> 03:10:23,540
Okay, so the first-

2736
03:10:23,540 --> 03:10:24,379
One's going to C, one's going to B.

2737
03:10:24,379 --> 03:10:26,870
The first one's going to C.

2738
03:10:26,870 --> 03:10:29,149
Cut the one that goes to C.

2739
03:10:29,149 --> 03:10:30,620
Okay.

2740
03:10:30,620 --> 03:10:34,870
And does the third one go to B?

2741
03:10:34,870 --> 03:10:35,709
Yes, it does.

2742
03:10:35,709 --> 03:10:36,549
Okay, cut that one too.

2743
03:10:36,549 --> 03:10:37,709
Okay.

2744
03:10:37,709 --> 03:10:40,709
Last one, we have a black wire and a blue wire.

2745
03:10:40,709 --> 03:10:42,190
11 to C, both going to C.

2746
03:10:42,190 --> 03:10:43,629
11 and 12, both going to C.

2747
03:10:43,629 --> 03:10:44,709
Blue wire and black wire.

2748
03:10:45,389 --> 03:10:47,670
Blue wire will be what in terms of occurrence?

2749
03:10:47,670 --> 03:10:52,670
So this would be the one, two, three, fourth blue wire.

2750
03:10:54,389 --> 03:10:55,229
Does it go to A?

2751
03:10:55,229 --> 03:10:56,690
Goes to C.

2752
03:10:56,690 --> 03:10:58,110
Skip it.

2753
03:10:58,110 --> 03:10:58,950
Nope.

2754
03:10:58,950 --> 03:11:00,829
Oh, cut the black wire, cut the black wire.

2755
03:11:00,829 --> 03:11:02,030
Done?

2756
03:11:02,030 --> 03:11:03,030
Yes.

2757
03:11:03,030 --> 03:11:05,909
Woo, we did it.

2758
03:11:05,909 --> 03:11:07,549
Oh, we have plenty of time, we have plenty of time.

2759
03:11:07,549 --> 03:11:08,389
42 seconds.

2760
03:11:08,389 --> 03:11:10,229
We have plenty of time?

2761
03:11:10,229 --> 03:11:11,829
Yeah, we have the 42 seconds.

2762
03:11:11,829 --> 03:11:13,670
That felt like fucking 25 minutes.

2763
03:11:13,670 --> 03:11:16,350
Yeah, I thought we had like 10 seconds left.

2764
03:11:16,350 --> 03:11:18,110
Jesus.

2765
03:11:18,110 --> 03:11:20,239
Oh my God.

2766
03:11:20,239 --> 03:11:21,979
Nice work.

2767
03:11:21,979 --> 03:11:24,110
That was good.

2768
03:11:24,110 --> 03:11:26,479
Dude, I'm fucking exhausted.

2769
03:11:26,479 --> 03:11:28,450
That was fucking wild.

2770
03:11:28,450 --> 03:11:29,649
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2771
03:11:29,649 --> 03:11:32,690
I can't imagine how much more difficult this game gets.

2772
03:11:32,690 --> 03:11:34,250
Dude, I tell you one thing.

2773
03:11:35,129 --> 03:11:37,690
We sure got way better at this in the fucking first stream.

2774
03:11:37,690 --> 03:11:38,530
Yes.

2775
03:11:38,530 --> 03:11:40,440
My God.

2776
03:11:40,440 --> 03:11:42,600
Wow.

2777
03:11:42,600 --> 03:11:43,420
That was fucking-

2778
03:11:43,420 --> 03:11:46,559
Dude, I'm like, it feels like I'm running a marathon.

2779
03:11:46,559 --> 03:11:47,760
Like, I'm physically exhausted.

2780
03:11:48,120 --> 03:11:50,920
I've been sitting down, but it's been like a,

2781
03:11:50,920 --> 03:11:52,200
I've actually been nervous this time.

2782
03:11:52,200 --> 03:11:54,719
Like, holy shit, man.

2783
03:11:54,719 --> 03:11:56,120
Yeah, I'm like sweating.

2784
03:11:56,120 --> 03:11:57,840
Somebody said this would be funny.

2785
03:11:57,840 --> 03:11:58,719
Do you want to preview the next one?

2786
03:11:58,719 --> 03:11:59,559
Just to see what the fuck is ahead of us.

2787
03:11:59,559 --> 03:12:01,000
Yeah, what is needy?

2788
03:12:02,159 --> 03:12:04,120
This is like a, this is a new mechanic.

2789
03:12:04,120 --> 03:12:05,399
Something is different about this bomb

2790
03:12:05,399 --> 03:12:07,889
and it demands attention.

2791
03:12:07,889 --> 03:12:09,969
Plus, yeah, apparently this bomb is needy.

2792
03:12:11,959 --> 03:12:13,120
Somebody said we should hook ourselves

2793
03:12:13,120 --> 03:12:15,719
up to small electric devices that give us small shocks

2794
03:12:15,719 --> 03:12:16,799
if we blow it.

2795
03:12:18,040 --> 03:12:20,200
That would be like death penalty.

2796
03:12:20,200 --> 03:12:21,879
That's electrical chair, man.

2797
03:12:21,879 --> 03:12:23,399
That's like TOS.

2798
03:12:23,399 --> 03:12:24,840
You ever seen the green mile?

2799
03:12:26,700 --> 03:12:28,540
Yes, I have.

2800
03:12:28,540 --> 03:12:29,379
All right, what's this?

2801
03:12:29,379 --> 03:12:30,659
Okay, so what the fuck are we looking at?

2802
03:12:30,659 --> 03:12:33,139
Okay, so apparently there's a new module here

2803
03:12:33,139 --> 03:12:34,620
that has like a bop it.

2804
03:12:34,620 --> 03:12:37,059
There's like a pull it, twist it, measure it.

2805
03:12:37,059 --> 03:12:37,899
Okay.

2806
03:12:41,500 --> 03:12:44,540
It says discharge the capacitor before it overloads

2807
03:12:44,540 --> 03:12:46,959
by holding down the lever.

2808
03:12:46,959 --> 03:12:50,010
So if I hold this down, okay.

2809
03:12:51,219 --> 03:12:54,360
I don't know what any of this means.

2810
03:12:54,360 --> 03:12:57,879
I think, and the word is needy, right?

2811
03:12:57,879 --> 03:12:59,760
I mean, needy is just the name of the bomb.

2812
03:12:59,760 --> 03:13:01,239
No, it's like the type of bomb it is.

2813
03:13:01,239 --> 03:13:03,680
I think this means that when we were gonna do this

2814
03:13:03,680 --> 03:13:05,840
next string question mark, I don't fucking know.

2815
03:13:05,840 --> 03:13:08,799
I think this is gonna build up a danger factor

2816
03:13:08,799 --> 03:13:10,360
and we have to like keep on being like,

2817
03:13:10,360 --> 03:13:12,879
no, go down, go done, you know?

2818
03:13:12,879 --> 03:13:13,719
We can't.

2819
03:13:15,319 --> 03:13:18,120
I think we have to like discharge it or something.

2820
03:13:18,120 --> 03:13:18,959
Oh, okay.

2821
03:13:18,959 --> 03:13:21,079
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what.

2822
03:13:21,079 --> 03:13:23,440
I think, how long have we been streaming?

2823
03:13:23,440 --> 03:13:24,280
Just curious.

2824
03:13:24,280 --> 03:13:26,200
Like three hours, 15 minutes.

2825
03:13:26,200 --> 03:13:28,239
I am fine with that.

2826
03:13:28,239 --> 03:13:30,319
I think we can call it here.

2827
03:13:30,319 --> 03:13:31,479
Okay.

2828
03:13:31,479 --> 03:13:33,520
Any more than this and I would have been like,

2829
03:13:33,520 --> 03:13:36,280
dude, just blow it up, we're fucked.

2830
03:13:36,280 --> 03:13:38,120
But here's-

2831
03:13:38,120 --> 03:13:40,600
Oh, is this not, oh, actually that's how.

2832
03:13:40,600 --> 03:13:42,360
Let me see what you're doing on screen, hang on.

2833
03:13:42,360 --> 03:13:43,200
Okay, you ready?

2834
03:13:43,200 --> 03:13:44,680
Can you imagine doing this?

2835
03:13:46,059 --> 03:13:47,899
Start, press start, press start.

2836
03:13:47,899 --> 03:13:50,889
Oh, would you, is this even possible?

2837
03:13:50,889 --> 03:13:51,729
Let's find out.

2838
03:13:57,399 --> 03:14:02,459
All right, let's go.

2839
03:14:02,459 --> 03:14:05,020
Quick, three, five, nine, five.

2840
03:14:05,020 --> 03:14:07,559
Three, five, nine, five on the Morse.

2841
03:14:07,559 --> 03:14:08,399
The word is,

2842
03:14:08,399 --> 03:14:12,680
th, th,

2843
03:14:12,680 --> 03:14:14,120
see,

2844
03:14:14,120 --> 03:14:15,979
sex.

2845
03:14:15,979 --> 03:14:16,819
Sex.

2846
03:14:16,819 --> 03:14:17,899
No, no, no, back, back, back, back.

2847
03:14:17,899 --> 03:14:21,239
It's sex.

2848
03:14:21,239 --> 03:14:23,959
No, no, no, sex.

2849
03:14:23,959 --> 03:14:25,159
Sex queue.

2850
03:14:25,159 --> 03:14:30,719
Sex queue.

2851
03:14:30,719 --> 03:14:32,409
Winsage.

2852
03:14:32,409 --> 03:14:34,409
Sorry, I lost you there.

2853
03:14:34,409 --> 03:14:35,250
Thicc.

2854
03:14:38,530 --> 03:14:39,370
Let's try that,

2855
03:14:39,489 --> 03:14:40,889
insane mode one more time.

2856
03:14:42,559 --> 03:14:45,040
Wait, we can't, we can't do that.

2857
03:14:45,040 --> 03:14:47,399
I know, but let's see if we can solve one

2858
03:14:47,399 --> 03:14:48,239
completely randomly.

2859
03:14:48,239 --> 03:14:49,319
Do you want to just try to solve one?

2860
03:14:49,319 --> 03:14:50,159
All right, let's try to solve.

2861
03:14:50,159 --> 03:14:52,159
If we solve one, then I'll eat for,

2862
03:14:53,239 --> 03:14:54,079
I'll eat something.

2863
03:14:54,079 --> 03:14:54,920
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2864
03:14:54,920 --> 03:14:56,920
Listen, we have enough Salmonella for a lifetime.

2865
03:14:56,920 --> 03:14:57,760
All right, here we go.

2866
03:14:57,760 --> 03:15:03,180
Ready?

2867
03:15:03,180 --> 03:15:04,260
Okay, symbols.

2868
03:15:04,260 --> 03:15:05,100
Just look at the very first symbol.

2869
03:15:05,100 --> 03:15:05,920
Omega.

2870
03:15:05,920 --> 03:15:06,760
Oh shit.

2871
03:15:06,760 --> 03:15:07,600
Omega.

2872
03:15:07,600 --> 03:15:08,420
Okay, hang on.

2873
03:15:08,420 --> 03:15:09,260
Omega.

2874
03:15:09,819 --> 03:15:10,659
Hang on.

2875
03:15:10,659 --> 03:15:12,120
Omega.

2876
03:15:12,120 --> 03:15:12,959
Trident.

2877
03:15:12,959 --> 03:15:13,799
AE.

2878
03:15:13,799 --> 03:15:17,770
And then Microsoft staple mascot.

2879
03:15:17,770 --> 03:15:19,209
Okay, you want to go,

2880
03:15:19,209 --> 03:15:23,750
you want to go staple mascot.

2881
03:15:23,750 --> 03:15:25,209
Yep.

2882
03:15:25,209 --> 03:15:26,030
AE.

2883
03:15:26,030 --> 03:15:27,370
Yep.

2884
03:15:27,370 --> 03:15:28,639
Trident.

2885
03:15:28,639 --> 03:15:29,479
Omega.

2886
03:15:29,479 --> 03:15:30,299
Got it, got it.

2887
03:15:30,299 --> 03:15:31,319
Okay.

2888
03:15:31,319 --> 03:15:32,639
All right, we solved one.

2889
03:15:32,639 --> 03:15:33,479
I was just trying to guess.

2890
03:15:33,479 --> 03:15:40,129
We got it.

2891
03:15:40,129 --> 03:15:41,170
Holy shit.

2892
03:15:41,170 --> 03:15:42,010
How would anybody,

2893
03:15:42,010 --> 03:15:43,290
there are probably speed runners that can do this shit

2894
03:15:43,290 --> 03:15:44,930
in five, 10 seconds.

2895
03:15:44,930 --> 03:15:46,489
Dude, imagine getting so fucking good at this.

2896
03:15:46,489 --> 03:15:48,129
You don't even depend on somebody.

2897
03:15:48,129 --> 03:15:49,649
You just remember from just like,

2898
03:15:49,649 --> 03:15:50,489
You just do it.

2899
03:15:50,489 --> 03:15:53,770
Algorithmic, like, you know.

2900
03:15:53,770 --> 03:15:55,170
Somebody, oh, by the way,

2901
03:15:55,170 --> 03:15:56,010
I forgot about this.

2902
03:15:56,010 --> 03:15:57,590
Somebody emailed me,

2903
03:15:57,590 --> 03:16:01,760
there is a mod for this game called Speed.

2904
03:16:01,760 --> 03:16:02,600
Speed?

2905
03:16:02,600 --> 03:16:03,920
It's a multiplayer mod.

2906
03:16:03,920 --> 03:16:06,159
You've seen the movie Speed?

2907
03:16:06,159 --> 03:16:07,620
Uh-huh.

2908
03:16:07,620 --> 03:16:09,299
Somebody modded in that someone,

2909
03:16:09,299 --> 03:16:12,659
you have to drive the bus with A and D

2910
03:16:12,659 --> 03:16:15,500
and always go around 80 miles per hour

2911
03:16:15,500 --> 03:16:16,340
or else it explodes.

2912
03:16:16,340 --> 03:16:17,379
Why didn't we do this?

2913
03:16:17,379 --> 03:16:18,620
Why didn't we do this one?

2914
03:16:18,620 --> 03:16:21,510
This looks awesome.

2915
03:16:21,510 --> 03:16:22,350
I'll tell you what.

2916
03:16:22,350 --> 03:16:23,569
I'll tell you what.

2917
03:16:23,569 --> 03:16:24,409
Next one.

2918
03:16:24,409 --> 03:16:25,250
Next time.

2919
03:16:25,250 --> 03:16:26,909
Next one.

2920
03:16:26,909 --> 03:16:28,709
And I'll tell you what.

2921
03:16:28,709 --> 03:16:30,350
Let's get a bunch of mods next time.

2922
03:16:30,350 --> 03:16:31,989
Let's download a, you know.

2923
03:16:31,989 --> 03:16:32,829
You want to fuck it up the whole,

2924
03:16:32,829 --> 03:16:33,670
you want to fuck the whole thing up?

2925
03:16:33,670 --> 03:16:36,139
A bunch of crap.

2926
03:16:36,139 --> 03:16:38,100
Well, I'll tell you what, man.

2927
03:16:38,100 --> 03:16:39,219
This was a lot of fun.

2928
03:16:39,219 --> 03:16:40,940
And I think the stream went way better

2929
03:16:40,940 --> 03:16:42,379
now that we're like sitting down

2930
03:16:42,379 --> 03:16:44,780
and we're like, let's be very serious.

2931
03:16:45,860 --> 03:16:47,120
But this was a lot of fun, man.

2932
03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:48,540
This was a very fun stream

2933
03:16:48,540 --> 03:16:51,020
and I can breathe now,

2934
03:16:51,020 --> 03:16:52,540
but a lot of fun, man.

2935
03:16:52,540 --> 03:16:53,379
A lot of fun.

2936
03:16:54,639 --> 03:16:55,479
Yeah.

2937
03:16:55,479 --> 03:16:56,920
Well, we'll probably see you again soon.

2938
03:16:56,920 --> 03:16:59,040
Thanks for hanging out, Joel.

2939
03:16:59,040 --> 03:17:01,719
We're squad stream so people can just look to the right

2940
03:17:01,719 --> 03:17:04,000
and see your channel, so.

2941
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:04,920
Absolutely.

2942
03:17:04,920 --> 03:17:06,479
Always give Joel a follow.

2943
03:17:06,479 --> 03:17:10,020
He's a fucking great dude.

2944
03:17:10,020 --> 03:17:11,739
And we'll see you again.

2945
03:17:11,739 --> 03:17:12,579
Whenever.

2946
03:17:12,579 --> 03:17:13,420
Yeah, absolutely.

2947
03:17:13,420 --> 03:17:15,420
Whenever you want to do this again.

2948
03:17:15,420 --> 03:17:18,379
Hit me up and I'll wake up at 3 a.m.

2949
03:17:18,379 --> 03:17:22,500
and have sand in my ass and be like,

2950
03:17:22,500 --> 03:17:23,340
knocking over cans.

2951
03:17:23,340 --> 03:17:25,780
Like, I got a diffuse mumps.

2952
03:17:27,219 --> 03:17:28,540
You got cans in your room too?

2953
03:17:28,540 --> 03:17:29,579
Wow.

2954
03:17:29,579 --> 03:17:31,100
Look at how similar we are, guys.

2955
03:17:31,100 --> 03:17:32,379
Look at us.

2956
03:17:32,379 --> 03:17:33,500
But what are you saying?

2957
03:17:33,500 --> 03:17:35,059
What are you guys saying?

2958
03:17:35,059 --> 03:17:36,819
Except one of us is funny.

2959
03:17:36,819 --> 03:17:38,700
But that's not me, by the way.

2960
03:17:38,700 --> 03:17:40,100
But which one?

2961
03:17:40,100 --> 03:17:41,100
No, you are.

2962
03:17:41,100 --> 03:17:41,940
Okay, listen.

2963
03:17:43,020 --> 03:17:44,700
No.

2964
03:17:44,700 --> 03:17:46,700
Anyway, my point being,

2965
03:17:46,700 --> 03:17:47,940
my point being,

2966
03:17:50,299 --> 03:17:51,340
I had a blast

2967
03:17:51,340 --> 03:17:54,659
and now that we know how all these modules work.

2968
03:17:54,659 --> 03:17:55,500
Now we can drive a car.

2969
03:17:55,500 --> 03:18:00,100
And yeah, the only thing we have to be a little better at

2970
03:18:00,100 --> 03:18:01,379
is we have to,

2971
03:18:03,649 --> 03:18:05,809
I have, well, you don't need any practice

2972
03:18:05,809 --> 03:18:08,010
on the password module, but I'll say this.

2973
03:18:08,010 --> 03:18:10,489
The memory shit is really difficult.

2974
03:18:10,489 --> 03:18:13,020
And I suggest maybe next stream,

2975
03:18:13,020 --> 03:18:16,940
get like a note thing or something to just be like,

2976
03:18:16,940 --> 03:18:17,979
yeah, that's not cheating.

2977
03:18:17,979 --> 03:18:21,459
Cause it's, you know, fucking,

2978
03:18:21,459 --> 03:18:23,260
when I do math in real life, I'm like, I had to write shit.

2979
03:18:23,260 --> 03:18:24,739
You know what, I'm going to get the thing.

2980
03:18:24,739 --> 03:18:27,459
I have this thing where I can draw on my screen.

2981
03:18:27,459 --> 03:18:28,299
I'm just going to get that.

2982
03:18:28,299 --> 03:18:29,139
Me too.

2983
03:18:29,139 --> 03:18:29,979
Me too.

2984
03:18:29,979 --> 03:18:30,819
Hang on, hang on.

2985
03:18:30,819 --> 03:18:31,659
Check this bad boy out.

2986
03:18:31,659 --> 03:18:33,299
Hang on.

2987
03:18:33,299 --> 03:18:34,219
You got one?

2988
03:18:34,219 --> 03:18:36,379
Yeah, they're pretty, they're awesome.

2989
03:18:36,379 --> 03:18:42,120
I've used them before.

2990
03:18:42,120 --> 03:18:43,120
A pencil.

2991
03:18:43,120 --> 03:18:43,959
No, no, no, no, no.

2992
03:18:43,959 --> 03:18:45,719
Like the pen that you can just draw on the screen.

2993
03:18:45,719 --> 03:18:50,250
So I can be like, okay, one and then two, three, four.

2994
03:18:50,250 --> 03:18:53,930
You should race desert bus with Joel.

2995
03:18:53,930 --> 03:18:58,260
Oh, that's, how do you race desert bus?

2996
03:18:58,260 --> 03:19:10,479
When you just go the same speed on the same road.

2997
03:19:10,479 --> 03:19:17,500
It's a race.

2998
03:19:17,500 --> 03:19:19,399
It's like my stream, man.

2999
03:19:19,399 --> 03:19:20,239
Oh, let me see.

3000
03:19:20,239 --> 03:19:23,180
Let me see what you're doing.

3001
03:19:23,180 --> 03:19:24,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3002
03:19:24,020 --> 03:19:25,780
You can draw kind of well.

3003
03:19:25,780 --> 03:19:28,440
You know how to draw.

3004
03:19:28,440 --> 03:19:31,110
It's a photo, dude.

3005
03:19:31,110 --> 03:19:37,879
You didn't just draw that?

3006
03:19:37,879 --> 03:19:39,520
I'll see you next week.

3007
03:19:39,520 --> 03:19:43,120
Hopefully whenever we, whenever we,

3008
03:19:43,120 --> 03:19:44,959
whenever we cross paths again,

3009
03:19:44,959 --> 03:19:48,200
but once again, thank you for having me on the stream.

3010
03:19:48,200 --> 03:19:53,559
I hope, I hope that, or us playing this a little bit better

3011
03:19:53,799 --> 03:19:56,879
add a little more quality to the stream, but you know.

3012
03:19:56,879 --> 03:19:58,719
Hey, the last one was quality too.

3013
03:19:59,559 --> 03:20:00,399
We were learning.

3014
03:20:00,399 --> 03:20:03,520
The last one was quality, but with 15 quotation marks.

3015
03:20:03,520 --> 03:20:06,000
But now we're in a little different league, I think.

3016
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:07,879
But regardless, thank you so much for having me, man.

3017
03:20:07,879 --> 03:20:10,879
And you know, I hope next time we can,

3018
03:20:10,879 --> 03:20:13,120
we can breeze through it even more in an accelerated pace.

3019
03:20:13,120 --> 03:20:14,040
So.

3020
03:20:14,040 --> 03:20:14,879
That was a lot of fun.

3021
03:20:14,879 --> 03:20:15,719
Absolutely.

3022
03:20:15,719 --> 03:20:16,559
Yeah, absolutely.

3023
03:20:16,559 --> 03:20:17,399
We'll see you later, dude.

3024
03:20:18,360 --> 03:20:19,200
See you later and.

3025
03:20:19,200 --> 03:20:20,040
Have a good sleep.

3026
03:20:20,040 --> 03:20:23,129
Well, actually, you know, you just woke up, didn't you?

3027
03:20:23,129 --> 03:20:25,569
Yeah, but you know, I'll probably eat two raw eggs later on

3028
03:20:25,569 --> 03:20:27,690
and I'll fucking have salmonella on my clock out for a week.

3029
03:20:27,690 --> 03:20:30,450
But anyway, yeah, speaking about that,

3030
03:20:31,850 --> 03:20:34,729
you, listen, that's not my prerogative anymore.

3031
03:20:34,729 --> 03:20:36,209
You check out whenever you are gonna go

3032
03:20:36,209 --> 03:20:38,489
on a heart attack grill and eat onion rings

3033
03:20:38,489 --> 03:20:39,649
that will give you like.

3034
03:20:40,649 --> 03:20:41,770
I'm looking forward to it.

3035
03:20:41,770 --> 03:20:43,649
Biblical, biblical diarrhea.

3036
03:20:43,649 --> 03:20:45,290
So, you know.

3037
03:20:45,290 --> 03:20:46,889
I don't know, I, yeah, probably.

3038
03:20:48,569 --> 03:20:50,649
But regardless, thank you for having me, man.

3039
03:20:50,649 --> 03:20:52,129
And.

3040
03:20:52,129 --> 03:20:52,969
You as well.

3041
03:20:52,969 --> 03:20:53,889
Thanks for having me too.

3042
03:20:53,889 --> 03:20:56,209
Thanks for you having me, having you having me.

3043
03:20:56,209 --> 03:20:57,049
Right?

3044
03:20:57,049 --> 03:20:57,889
Yeah, absolutely.

3045
03:20:57,889 --> 03:20:58,729
Thank you, Jerma.

3046
03:20:58,729 --> 03:21:03,290
And thank you, Jerma Chat for calling me a turnip.

3047
03:21:03,290 --> 03:21:04,129
I'll see you.

3048
03:21:05,709 --> 03:21:10,120
All right, get deleted.

3049
03:21:10,120 --> 03:21:11,159
Yeah, get deleted.

3050
03:21:12,989 --> 03:21:13,829
See ya.

3051
03:21:15,270 --> 03:21:18,579
All right.

3052
03:21:18,579 --> 03:21:20,059
All right, guys.

3053
03:21:20,059 --> 03:21:23,750
What we're gonna do is

3054
03:21:23,829 --> 03:21:28,239
I, I am going to be,

3055
03:21:28,239 --> 03:21:31,040
I just was talking to Kim.

3056
03:21:31,040 --> 03:21:35,639
And I think we're gonna go to dinner.

3057
03:21:35,639 --> 03:21:36,479
We're gonna go out to dinner.

3058
03:21:36,479 --> 03:21:37,639
It's Diablo and you know it.

3059
03:21:37,639 --> 03:21:44,450
It's not.

3060
03:21:44,450 --> 03:21:49,819
Oh, I see how it is.

3061
03:21:49,819 --> 03:21:51,639
You hate us.

3062
03:21:51,639 --> 03:21:53,520
A three and a half hour stream.

3063
03:21:53,520 --> 03:21:55,590
Get it.

3064
03:21:55,590 --> 03:22:00,850
We're going to the heart attack grill.

3065
03:22:00,850 --> 03:22:02,729
No, that's probably a good place.

3066
03:22:02,729 --> 03:22:04,290
I don't, I don't wanna,

3067
03:22:04,290 --> 03:22:06,809
I don't wanna know Diablo II tonight.

3068
03:22:06,809 --> 03:22:14,739
No Diablo II tonight.

3069
03:22:14,819 --> 03:22:19,030
It's time for the water filter stream and you know it.

3070
03:22:19,030 --> 03:22:21,709
Now, I'm gonna give you guys kind of how the,

3071
03:22:21,709 --> 03:22:24,649
the way that the streams are gonna work for a while.

3072
03:22:24,649 --> 03:22:30,409
I have a very, very, very busy, busy February.

3073
03:22:30,409 --> 03:22:31,250
Real wink.

3074
03:22:31,250 --> 03:22:37,170
Well, all right, well fucking let's go to the wink.

3075
03:22:37,170 --> 03:22:38,770
So how, let me, let's go.

3076
03:22:38,770 --> 03:22:40,450
This actually will take like probably a few minutes

3077
03:22:40,450 --> 03:22:41,290
to go over.

3078
03:22:41,290 --> 03:22:44,629
Let's go over this.

3079
03:22:44,629 --> 03:22:45,829
Let's go.

3080
03:22:45,829 --> 03:22:49,489
I'm gonna just give you a bunch of money.

3081
03:22:49,489 --> 03:22:54,979
Dry Ski just gave 5,000 bits.

3082
03:22:54,979 --> 03:22:57,959
Thank you, Dry Ski.

3083
03:22:57,959 --> 03:23:01,600
50 fucking dollars.

3084
03:23:01,600 --> 03:23:02,799
Yeah, no, we're still gonna do the end of the stream.

3085
03:23:02,799 --> 03:23:07,209
We're still gonna hang out.

3086
03:23:07,209 --> 03:23:09,170
5,000 bits.

3087
03:23:09,170 --> 03:23:12,760
Let me just pull up my bit device here.

3088
03:23:12,760 --> 03:23:15,840
Here it is.

3089
03:23:15,840 --> 03:23:16,760
It's Dry Ski.

3090
03:23:16,760 --> 03:23:19,159
They say, hey, Jerma, it's my birthday today.

3091
03:23:19,159 --> 03:23:20,319
Wanna say you've made it so much better

3092
03:23:20,319 --> 03:23:21,680
with the laughs tonight.

3093
03:23:21,680 --> 03:23:23,280
Love the idea of you, buddy.

3094
03:23:23,280 --> 03:23:24,799
Have a great time.

3095
03:23:24,799 --> 03:23:26,750
Thank you, Dry Ski.

3096
03:23:26,750 --> 03:23:29,239
Happy birthday.

3097
03:23:29,239 --> 03:23:30,520
Not sure where you are in the world,

3098
03:23:30,520 --> 03:23:32,120
but hopefully it stays your birthday

3099
03:23:32,120 --> 03:23:33,690
for a little while longer.

3100
03:23:33,690 --> 03:23:37,739
The idea of you.

3101
03:23:37,739 --> 03:23:41,190
Taking ice cream was on its way, yeah.

3102
03:23:41,190 --> 03:23:42,030
Thank you.

3103
03:23:42,030 --> 03:23:42,870
Have a great birthday.

3104
03:23:42,870 --> 03:23:46,440
Phil's birthday, man.

3105
03:23:46,440 --> 03:23:48,040
Jerma induced a heart attack.

3106
03:23:49,610 --> 03:23:51,129
I love the idea of Jerma,

3107
03:23:51,129 --> 03:23:53,090
but the execution is just, you know,

3108
03:23:53,090 --> 03:23:54,610
it gets lacking sometimes.

3109
03:23:54,610 --> 03:23:55,450
It's lacking.

3110
03:23:56,290 --> 03:23:59,629
No, thanks a lot, man.

3111
03:23:59,629 --> 03:24:01,229
But let's go over.

3112
03:24:01,229 --> 03:24:02,069
Let's go.

3113
03:24:02,069 --> 03:24:03,590
Let's put the cam on for this.

3114
03:24:03,590 --> 03:24:05,549
Just so, cause, you know, obviously

3115
03:24:05,549 --> 03:24:07,670
not really playing the exploding game anymore,

3116
03:24:07,670 --> 03:24:09,389
but I'll just go right in the middle.

3117
03:24:09,389 --> 03:24:10,829
So there you go.

3118
03:24:10,829 --> 03:24:11,989
You guys are right here.

3119
03:24:13,760 --> 03:24:18,590
So over the course of the next couple of weeks,

3120
03:24:18,590 --> 03:24:20,989
I have some doctor's appointments

3121
03:24:20,989 --> 03:24:23,270
and I also have some old friends,

3122
03:24:23,270 --> 03:24:27,459
some hometown friends that are coming up to visit Vegas

3123
03:24:27,459 --> 03:24:29,860
and they're going to spend some time here.

3124
03:24:29,860 --> 03:24:33,780
So we're going to do a few kind of one day off,

3125
03:24:33,780 --> 03:24:37,979
one day on, two day, but here's, hear me out on this one.

3126
03:24:37,979 --> 03:24:41,989
So I will be back on Sunday.

3127
03:24:41,989 --> 03:24:44,350
I will be back on Sunday.

3128
03:24:44,350 --> 03:24:45,389
We're going to stream on Sunday.

3129
03:24:45,389 --> 03:24:46,870
So that's the 26th.

3130
03:24:46,870 --> 03:24:50,110
And then I'm going to be off on the 20th.

3131
03:24:50,110 --> 03:24:50,950
What just happened?

3132
03:24:50,950 --> 03:24:51,770
Oh, okay.

3133
03:24:51,770 --> 03:24:54,680
I'm going to be off on the 27th.

3134
03:24:54,680 --> 03:25:00,559
And then we are going to go five days in a row.

3135
03:25:01,229 --> 03:25:03,590
We are going to do Tuesday, Wednesday,

3136
03:25:03,590 --> 03:25:05,190
Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

3137
03:25:05,190 --> 03:25:07,340
We're doing five days in a row

3138
03:25:07,340 --> 03:25:11,729
because the week after that, the next week,

3139
03:25:11,729 --> 03:25:13,590
that first, second week of February,

3140
03:25:13,590 --> 03:25:15,670
I'm not going to be live for more

3141
03:25:15,670 --> 03:25:19,250
than probably once, twice a week.

3142
03:25:20,090 --> 03:25:22,780
So we are going to do five days in a row

3143
03:25:22,780 --> 03:25:23,860
as of this coming Tuesday.

3144
03:25:23,860 --> 03:25:28,190
But again, you'll see me again on Sunday,

3145
03:25:28,190 --> 03:25:30,270
nothing on Monday, and then five days in a row

3146
03:25:30,270 --> 03:25:32,670
until I take some time off.

3147
03:25:32,670 --> 03:25:35,010
It's not going to be Diablo.

3148
03:25:35,010 --> 03:25:36,370
No, we have a lot of games to play.

3149
03:25:36,370 --> 03:25:37,889
It's not going to be fucking Diablo.

3150
03:25:37,889 --> 03:25:40,489
What's wrong with my hair?

3151
03:25:40,489 --> 03:25:43,639
It's painted on.

3152
03:25:43,639 --> 03:25:49,829
I mean, it's a little bit of this, yeah.

3153
03:25:49,829 --> 03:25:51,510
When's community content night part two?

3154
03:25:51,510 --> 03:25:53,270
That's actually a really, really great question.

3155
03:25:53,270 --> 03:25:54,909
That's a great question.

3156
03:25:54,909 --> 03:26:00,559
That's going to happen on probably Sunday

3157
03:26:00,559 --> 03:26:02,280
because that's when I said I was going to have

3158
03:26:02,280 --> 03:26:03,840
this coming weekend, right?

3159
03:26:03,840 --> 03:26:05,159
So we'll do that on Sunday.

3160
03:26:05,159 --> 03:26:07,520
That'll be part two of community content night.

3161
03:26:09,420 --> 03:26:10,459
That will be a quick one.

3162
03:26:10,459 --> 03:26:12,340
So we'll do something else.

3163
03:26:12,340 --> 03:26:13,700
We'll do community content night

3164
03:26:13,700 --> 03:26:17,549
and then we'll bleed into something else.

3165
03:26:17,549 --> 03:26:19,510
But that's the schedule for the next couple of weeks

3166
03:26:19,510 --> 03:26:21,110
because I'm taking a lot of time off

3167
03:26:21,110 --> 03:26:22,510
that first week of February.

3168
03:26:23,819 --> 03:26:24,940
Don't point at me.

3169
03:26:24,940 --> 03:26:27,500
I told you I'm like a fucking,

3170
03:26:27,500 --> 03:26:29,420
I like cast spells when I talk.

3171
03:26:33,379 --> 03:26:34,860
That's it for tonight.

3172
03:26:34,860 --> 03:26:38,530
See you guys in a couple of days on Sunday.

3173
03:26:38,530 --> 03:26:40,600
And that's it.

3174
03:26:40,600 --> 03:26:41,680
Shorter stream tonight, I know,

3175
03:26:41,680 --> 03:26:43,760
but my brain is a little,

3176
03:26:43,760 --> 03:26:47,840
I mean, he was right when he said that after doing that,

3177
03:26:47,840 --> 03:26:49,840
it's almost like I need to go eat

3178
03:26:49,840 --> 03:26:51,479
and just relax for a while.

3179
03:26:53,090 --> 03:26:54,049
Signing off.

3180
03:26:54,049 --> 03:26:56,799
I'll see you guys on Sunday.

3181
03:26:56,799 --> 03:26:58,079
But let's do the end of the stream.

3182
03:26:58,079 --> 03:27:00,239
Let's hang out for a little bit, as always.

3183
03:27:00,239 --> 03:27:03,879
I'm not just going to leave.

3184
03:27:03,879 --> 03:27:04,879
When's the rumble?

3185
03:27:04,879 --> 03:27:07,760
Yes, there's going to be a charity rumble.

3186
03:27:07,799 --> 03:27:09,000
I haven't talked that much about it,

3187
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:11,680
but I've talked enough about it for you guys to know.

3188
03:27:11,680 --> 03:27:17,559
The next rumble is going to be a charity rumble.

3189
03:27:17,559 --> 03:27:21,399
It's going to be to sponsor one of my closest friends,

3190
03:27:21,399 --> 03:27:24,209
Boston Marathon Run.

3191
03:27:24,209 --> 03:27:25,729
All the money that comes in during that stream,

3192
03:27:25,729 --> 03:27:29,170
there's going to be a special link to donate

3193
03:27:29,170 --> 03:27:35,760
to raise the money to sponsor his run.

3194
03:27:35,760 --> 03:27:36,600
That should be really fun.

3195
03:27:36,600 --> 03:27:39,180
And that's probably going to happen

3196
03:27:39,180 --> 03:27:43,989
somewhere in February into March.

3197
03:27:43,989 --> 03:27:47,000
That's when it's planned, at least.

3198
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:52,280
Because obviously the marathon is in April,

3199
03:27:52,280 --> 03:27:54,440
so we kind of have to do it before then,

3200
03:27:54,440 --> 03:27:57,799
because obviously he needs to be sponsored before then.

3201
03:27:57,799 --> 03:28:05,950
Yo Joel, why you eating chips?

3202
03:28:05,950 --> 03:28:09,120
Why though?

3203
03:28:09,120 --> 03:28:11,159
Why what?

3204
03:28:11,159 --> 03:28:16,329
Why do a charity stream?

3205
03:28:16,329 --> 03:28:20,459
I don't know, I don't follow you.

3206
03:28:20,459 --> 03:28:21,979
But why though?

3207
03:28:21,979 --> 03:28:29,500
Hey, but why though?

3208
03:28:29,500 --> 03:28:32,010
But yeah, now that's the plan.

3209
03:28:32,010 --> 03:28:34,569
Let's rewind the clock a little bit.

3210
03:28:34,569 --> 03:28:38,700
Let's do the bits.

3211
03:28:38,700 --> 03:28:41,420
Thank you to E-WordTorteyWordTort for the 250.

3212
03:28:41,500 --> 03:28:43,540
It's been a while since I've said that name out loud,

3213
03:28:43,540 --> 03:28:45,420
one of my favorite names.

3214
03:28:45,420 --> 03:28:47,899
I love saying it, E-WordTorteyWordTort.

3215
03:28:47,899 --> 03:28:52,489
It's 250.

3216
03:28:52,489 --> 03:28:54,610
We had 10 community subs from SuperBruce.

3217
03:28:54,610 --> 03:29:02,270
I caught it, but again, thank you, Bruce.

3218
03:29:02,270 --> 03:29:03,389
Much love to you.

3219
03:29:03,389 --> 03:29:07,610
Again, E-WordTorteyWordTort gave 250 bits.

3220
03:29:07,610 --> 03:29:09,930
Remember, please play Halo M when it comes out on PC,

3221
03:29:09,930 --> 03:29:12,370
or I'll fly to America and sign a petition to ban you.

3222
03:29:12,370 --> 03:29:21,600
Why do you have to fly to America to ban me?

3223
03:29:21,600 --> 03:29:22,840
There's a clip here.

3224
03:29:22,840 --> 03:29:25,200
I know what this clip says, but I did it.

3225
03:29:25,200 --> 03:29:26,879
And it...

3226
03:29:26,879 --> 03:29:28,879
E-WordTorteyWordTort, thanks for the $5.

3227
03:29:28,879 --> 03:29:32,879
Jerma, play Halo on PC, please, thank you.

3228
03:29:32,879 --> 03:29:34,399
Probably.

3229
03:29:34,399 --> 03:29:35,719
I did.

3230
03:29:35,719 --> 03:29:37,200
I don't see why not, probably.

3231
03:29:37,200 --> 03:29:38,479
I did.

3232
03:29:38,479 --> 03:29:41,049
Not the next day, probably not.

3233
03:29:41,049 --> 03:29:43,430
On legendary mode.

3234
03:29:43,430 --> 03:29:44,270
I did that too.

3235
03:29:44,270 --> 03:29:45,450
Delete that.

3236
03:29:45,450 --> 03:29:46,809
Demons V, thanks for the...

3237
03:29:46,809 --> 03:29:54,270
I did that too.

3238
03:29:54,270 --> 03:29:56,590
You call what you did playing.

3239
03:29:56,590 --> 03:30:01,590
Yes, I had, I controlled the character and moved around.

3240
03:30:07,110 --> 03:30:08,110
Fucking Halo.

3241
03:30:08,110 --> 03:30:10,110
That's so funny to me.

3242
03:30:10,110 --> 03:30:13,969
It's all good though, whatever.

3243
03:30:13,969 --> 03:30:17,129
All right, he's gonna ban you in real life.

3244
03:30:17,129 --> 03:30:20,280
You know, how do you get banned in real life?

3245
03:30:20,280 --> 03:30:24,450
Thank you, E-WordTorteyWordTort, appreciate it.

3246
03:30:24,450 --> 03:30:28,680
Oh my God, how did I miss $100 from Freddy Dredd?

3247
03:30:28,680 --> 03:30:29,520
How did I miss this?

3248
03:30:29,520 --> 03:30:32,709
This is like the most important message ever.

3249
03:30:32,709 --> 03:30:34,709
Freddy Dredd gave 10,000 bits earlier,

3250
03:30:34,709 --> 03:30:36,909
and they said, I'm at Hash House right now.

3251
03:30:36,909 --> 03:30:38,110
I'm gonna order.

3252
03:30:38,110 --> 03:30:40,520
That was like three hours ago.

3253
03:30:40,520 --> 03:30:41,360
God damn it.

3254
03:30:47,350 --> 03:30:52,100
I need to know, I have to know.

3255
03:30:52,139 --> 03:30:54,459
You got the blue cheeseburger?

3256
03:30:54,459 --> 03:30:57,559
He's waiting for you.

3257
03:30:57,559 --> 03:31:00,319
He's been waiting for you for three hours.

3258
03:31:00,319 --> 03:31:04,819
You were supposed to go to dinner.

3259
03:31:04,819 --> 03:31:06,139
That's the most important because of the money?

3260
03:31:06,139 --> 03:31:09,110
No, it's the most important because

3261
03:31:09,110 --> 03:31:11,680
they went to Hash House or GoGo at the link.

3262
03:31:11,680 --> 03:31:16,110
That's why.

3263
03:31:16,110 --> 03:31:21,959
Literally there, they kicked him out.

3264
03:31:21,959 --> 03:31:22,799
Freddy, if you're still here

3265
03:31:22,799 --> 03:31:23,760
or if you check back in again,

3266
03:31:23,760 --> 03:31:28,040
thanks so much for the fucking $1,100, $1,200 now.

3267
03:31:28,040 --> 03:31:29,829
Over two days.

3268
03:31:29,829 --> 03:31:31,190
Hope you liked it.

3269
03:31:31,190 --> 03:31:36,000
It's one of my favorite places.

3270
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:37,200
He wouldn't notice, Freddy,

3271
03:31:37,200 --> 03:31:45,360
if he just typed in chat normally.

3272
03:31:45,360 --> 03:31:46,200
But thanks, Freddy.

3273
03:31:46,200 --> 03:31:48,579
Thank you so much.

3274
03:31:48,579 --> 03:31:50,219
Seriously, I hope you liked it.

3275
03:31:50,219 --> 03:31:51,059
I'm gonna, I'm so sad.

3276
03:31:51,059 --> 03:31:51,899
I'm kind of nervous.

3277
03:31:51,899 --> 03:31:53,459
What if he comes back and he's like,

3278
03:31:53,459 --> 03:31:57,389
dude, that was like a six out of 10 at best.

3279
03:31:57,389 --> 03:32:01,979
In fact, like two of my friends are sick.

3280
03:32:01,979 --> 03:32:05,399
I'm gonna be like, oh shit.

3281
03:32:05,399 --> 03:32:06,639
No, impossible.

3282
03:32:06,639 --> 03:32:09,319
Not possible if you go to Hash House or GoGo at the link.

3283
03:32:09,319 --> 03:32:12,040
Not possible.

3284
03:32:12,040 --> 03:32:18,590
It's just a fact, but thanks a lot.

3285
03:32:18,590 --> 03:32:19,430
Thank you.

3286
03:32:19,430 --> 03:32:21,590
I'd ever agree.

3287
03:32:21,590 --> 03:32:24,409
I'd ever agree.

3288
03:32:24,409 --> 03:32:26,010
Thanks to Five Dolls.

3289
03:32:26,010 --> 03:32:27,049
Jerma, so me and my friends

3290
03:32:27,049 --> 03:32:29,090
were doing a hunger game simulator.

3291
03:32:29,090 --> 03:32:30,290
We added you in as a joke,

3292
03:32:30,290 --> 03:32:32,049
but unfortunately you ended up killing everyone

3293
03:32:32,049 --> 03:32:39,590
and you won the hunger games.

3294
03:32:39,590 --> 03:32:54,110
Is this my, the winner is Jerma from District 10.

3295
03:32:54,110 --> 03:32:58,549
People add me as a joke to things and I just win.

3296
03:32:58,549 --> 03:33:01,950
Is the image, apparently.

3297
03:33:01,950 --> 03:33:03,430
Well, Adam is a joke.

3298
03:33:03,430 --> 03:33:05,569
Well, you know, now you guys know,

3299
03:33:05,569 --> 03:33:10,600
I take shit dead seriously.

3300
03:33:10,600 --> 03:33:11,799
I'm not, I don't fuck around.

3301
03:33:11,799 --> 03:33:12,799
You add me to something like that.

3302
03:33:12,799 --> 03:33:18,100
I'm gonna go for it.

3303
03:33:18,100 --> 03:33:25,649
I'm saying.

3304
03:33:25,649 --> 03:33:29,809
I can't just be jokey, add it in

3305
03:33:29,809 --> 03:33:31,250
and not win the whole thing.

3306
03:33:32,809 --> 03:33:33,969
But thanks.

3307
03:33:33,969 --> 03:33:37,860
I'm honored to have won.

3308
03:33:37,860 --> 03:33:38,940
Hey, Noodle is bad at gaming.

3309
03:33:38,940 --> 03:33:39,899
Thanks to the five for the bits.

3310
03:33:39,899 --> 03:33:41,620
Hey, Jerma, I made a funny video.

3311
03:33:46,549 --> 03:33:50,530
Why is there, oh, sorry.

3312
03:33:50,530 --> 03:33:51,969
Someone's talking.

3313
03:33:51,969 --> 03:33:53,729
That was like a poker tournament going on

3314
03:33:53,729 --> 03:33:54,969
on the front page of Twitch repair.

3315
03:33:55,649 --> 03:33:56,489
I don't know.

3316
03:33:56,489 --> 03:33:57,809
I just like, I hit the back button

3317
03:33:57,809 --> 03:33:59,969
and I'm on my Twitch homepage.

3318
03:33:59,969 --> 03:34:02,280
Sorry about that.

3319
03:34:02,280 --> 03:34:05,159
That's not the funny video, I guess.

3320
03:34:05,159 --> 03:34:09,860
There's another one.

3321
03:34:09,860 --> 03:34:13,040
It says here comes another bad Jerma video.

3322
03:34:13,040 --> 03:34:15,079
Last one is to see.

3323
03:34:15,079 --> 03:34:16,479
Black wire in the middle to see.

3324
03:34:16,479 --> 03:34:19,149
What number, what number?

3325
03:34:19,149 --> 03:34:20,350
Which time was left?

3326
03:34:20,350 --> 03:34:21,790
You don't wanna know.

3327
03:34:32,219 --> 03:34:33,420
That's a halo spoiler.

3328
03:34:44,159 --> 03:34:46,360
Okay, this is, I'm gonna,

3329
03:34:46,360 --> 03:34:47,760
here comes a halo spoiler.

3330
03:34:48,760 --> 03:34:50,200
Those of you that have ever seen halo,

3331
03:34:50,200 --> 03:34:51,239
here comes a spoiler.

3332
03:34:59,389 --> 03:35:01,469
Last one is to see.

3333
03:35:01,469 --> 03:35:02,870
Black wire in the middle to see.

3334
03:35:02,870 --> 03:35:05,350
What number, what number?

3335
03:35:05,350 --> 03:35:06,709
How much time was left?

3336
03:35:06,709 --> 03:35:18,809
You don't wanna know.

3337
03:35:18,809 --> 03:35:20,690
That's the first level in Halo 2.

3338
03:35:20,690 --> 03:35:22,049
I've never seen Halo 2

3339
03:35:22,049 --> 03:35:23,569
before you spoiled the whole game.

3340
03:35:23,569 --> 03:35:25,569
I can't even play it now.

3341
03:35:25,569 --> 03:35:27,690
Autumn Dragons, thanks for the 250

3342
03:35:27,690 --> 03:35:32,969
and they say, this is Morse code.

3343
03:35:32,969 --> 03:35:33,809
Let me just like put this

3344
03:35:33,809 --> 03:35:37,420
into like a Morse code translator.

3345
03:35:37,459 --> 03:35:38,260
Make sure this is not something

3346
03:35:38,260 --> 03:35:49,299
that I was gonna say something fucked up.

3347
03:35:49,299 --> 03:35:54,700
Okay, this is what they wrote.

3348
03:35:54,700 --> 03:35:55,819
I can't even write this.

3349
03:35:55,819 --> 03:36:03,530
Why?

3350
03:36:03,530 --> 03:36:06,889
So that's Morse code for Jerma sucks.

3351
03:36:10,100 --> 03:36:16,620
Cool, thanks.

3352
03:36:16,620 --> 03:36:17,459
Hey, appreciate that.

3353
03:36:17,459 --> 03:36:21,299
Hey, Meaty Patty, thanks for the 500 bits.

3354
03:36:21,299 --> 03:36:25,040
Thanks a lot.

3355
03:36:25,040 --> 03:36:29,389
Agent Dark Booty, thanks for the 500 bits.

3356
03:36:29,389 --> 03:36:31,469
Jerma, I've only been watching you since 2017

3357
03:36:31,469 --> 03:36:33,149
but you're giving me more wheezy laughs

3358
03:36:33,149 --> 03:36:36,579
than any other E-clown.

3359
03:36:36,579 --> 03:36:39,190
Thanks.

3360
03:36:39,190 --> 03:36:40,590
They say, I hope you don't take chat

3361
03:36:40,590 --> 03:36:41,469
ribbing you seriously.

3362
03:36:41,469 --> 03:36:44,170
We all love you and it's all in good fun.

3363
03:36:44,170 --> 03:36:45,690
Yeah, I hope you don't take some of the things

3364
03:36:45,690 --> 03:36:47,659
that I say seriously either.

3365
03:36:47,659 --> 03:36:48,659
I'm not talking about putting a hamburger

3366
03:36:48,659 --> 03:36:50,120
down my underwear.

3367
03:36:50,120 --> 03:36:50,959
You know what I mean?

3368
03:36:50,959 --> 03:36:51,799
That's not real.

3369
03:36:51,799 --> 03:36:53,319
We both say things, we're just kidding around.

3370
03:36:53,319 --> 03:36:55,040
Also, I have ADHD and have trouble

3371
03:36:55,040 --> 03:36:56,120
with motivation sometimes.

3372
03:36:56,120 --> 03:36:56,959
Do you experience this

3373
03:36:56,959 --> 03:36:58,799
or have you had any tips regarding it?

3374
03:36:58,799 --> 03:36:59,719
Keep it up, dude.

3375
03:37:02,190 --> 03:37:05,459
Yeah, all the time.

3376
03:37:05,459 --> 03:37:07,579
The thing that helps for me the most

3377
03:37:07,579 --> 03:37:11,459
is trying just to focus on one thing at a time

3378
03:37:11,579 --> 03:37:13,459
because I can get so spread out

3379
03:37:13,459 --> 03:37:14,780
and have so many things that I care about

3380
03:37:14,780 --> 03:37:19,780
that I care about, I have 100% of my brain that cares

3381
03:37:19,979 --> 03:37:22,260
and if there's 10 things that I wanna do,

3382
03:37:22,260 --> 03:37:25,459
each one of those things will get 10% of my brain

3383
03:37:25,459 --> 03:37:26,819
which just, that sucks.

3384
03:37:26,819 --> 03:37:28,500
It fucks everything up.

3385
03:37:28,500 --> 03:37:34,399
You gotta do one thing at a time, 100% of your brain power.

3386
03:37:34,399 --> 03:37:36,959
It's easy to be like, well, this, that, that, that, that

3387
03:37:36,959 --> 03:37:38,319
and then you spread yourself out so much

3388
03:37:38,319 --> 03:37:41,250
that you're all over the place.

3389
03:37:41,250 --> 03:37:43,290
So I've tried to, at least recently,

3390
03:37:43,290 --> 03:37:45,809
in the last probably three, four plus years,

3391
03:37:45,809 --> 03:37:48,729
is just to do one thing at a time

3392
03:37:48,729 --> 03:37:51,780
and just get it done and do that first

3393
03:37:51,780 --> 03:37:54,219
because there are, especially if we're talking about

3394
03:37:54,219 --> 03:37:56,899
just even for streaming, the stuff that I wanna do,

3395
03:37:56,899 --> 03:37:59,700
I have things that I'm starting to want to plan out

3396
03:37:59,700 --> 03:38:02,139
that are gonna be three, four, five plus months

3397
03:38:02,139 --> 03:38:03,940
from now in 2020,

3398
03:38:03,940 --> 03:38:06,579
but there's other stuff that takes precedence first

3399
03:38:06,579 --> 03:38:09,100
that's happening now or sooner

3400
03:38:09,100 --> 03:38:13,200
and you gotta do it one step at a time.

3401
03:38:13,200 --> 03:38:14,280
It's really easy to get overwhelmed

3402
03:38:14,280 --> 03:38:19,819
when you overwhelm yourself, one at a time.

3403
03:38:19,819 --> 03:38:21,969
But thanks a lot.

3404
03:38:21,969 --> 03:38:26,270
Thanks for the 500 bits.

3405
03:38:26,270 --> 03:38:28,229
Xwar2, thanks for the 300 bits.

3406
03:38:28,229 --> 03:38:29,829
Enjoy the dinner date with Kim Germa.

3407
03:38:29,829 --> 03:38:31,670
This is like my third ever Twitch stream of yours.

3408
03:38:31,670 --> 03:38:38,079
Also, it's pronounced Xwar2.

3409
03:38:38,079 --> 03:38:42,729
All right, but I think I said Xwar2, Xwar2.

3410
03:38:42,729 --> 03:38:45,020
Thank you.

3411
03:38:45,020 --> 03:38:46,459
Welcome, hope you like it.

3412
03:38:46,459 --> 03:38:48,100
This is the third time you've ever seen a stream.

3413
03:38:48,100 --> 03:38:50,059
I'm not sure if you've ever seen anything else,

3414
03:38:50,059 --> 03:38:52,670
but what's going on?

3415
03:38:52,670 --> 03:38:57,870
Thanks for stopping by.

3416
03:38:57,870 --> 03:39:01,079
We'll see you again.

3417
03:39:01,079 --> 03:39:06,770
Beck Ali, thank Beck Ali or Beck Ali for the 400 bits.

3418
03:39:06,770 --> 03:39:07,969
Thanks a lot.

3419
03:39:07,969 --> 03:39:09,290
They say, hey Germa, watching your videos

3420
03:39:09,290 --> 03:39:11,610
really helps with my depression and shit.

3421
03:39:11,610 --> 03:39:13,129
I wanna say thank you.

3422
03:39:13,129 --> 03:39:14,889
Also, I used to have pet rats

3423
03:39:14,889 --> 03:39:20,020
and they're amazing like little dogs.

3424
03:39:20,020 --> 03:39:24,639
Yeah, and they're insanely smart too.

3425
03:39:24,639 --> 03:39:29,100
They're very, very smart animals.

3426
03:39:29,100 --> 03:39:29,920
But whatever you're going through,

3427
03:39:29,920 --> 03:39:35,930
I'm sorry to hear that.

3428
03:39:35,930 --> 03:39:37,690
Hopefully you can go day by day

3429
03:39:37,690 --> 03:39:41,540
and start feeling a little better.

3430
03:39:41,620 --> 03:39:42,819
Rats are fucking awesome.

3431
03:39:46,299 --> 03:39:47,700
Year of the rat too.

3432
03:39:47,700 --> 03:39:50,430
Year of the rat, pet rats.

3433
03:39:50,430 --> 03:39:53,569
Gotta get two though.

3434
03:39:53,569 --> 03:39:55,090
Otto is a rat terrier.

3435
03:39:55,090 --> 03:39:59,659
That's also not, that's not, I didn't make that up.

3436
03:39:59,659 --> 03:40:05,809
He's rat terrier.

3437
03:40:05,809 --> 03:40:09,809
He's 40% dachshund, 40% rat terrier,

3438
03:40:09,809 --> 03:40:13,690
10% Shetland sheepdog and 10% Chihuahua.

3439
03:40:15,020 --> 03:40:19,139
We got the real data.

3440
03:40:19,139 --> 03:40:23,739
He's an actual rat.

3441
03:40:23,739 --> 03:40:25,860
But thank you, Beck Ali.

3442
03:40:25,860 --> 03:40:28,620
Appreciate it.

3443
03:40:28,620 --> 03:40:32,159
We also have 300 bits from Gray the Color.

3444
03:40:32,159 --> 03:40:35,250
Thank you, Gray.

3445
03:40:35,250 --> 03:40:36,090
Great stream tonight.

3446
03:40:36,090 --> 03:40:38,889
Would like to see more co-op with you and Joel.

3447
03:40:38,889 --> 03:40:39,850
A lot of people recommended it,

3448
03:40:39,850 --> 03:40:42,530
but will you be playing SWAT 4 anytime in the future?

3449
03:40:42,530 --> 03:40:44,489
Also, do you ever finish that petition

3450
03:40:44,489 --> 03:40:46,649
to get Burger Boy to permanently wear a bib?

3451
03:40:46,649 --> 03:40:54,129
Permanently.

3452
03:40:54,129 --> 03:41:00,709
Oh, that's so fucking stupid.

3453
03:41:00,709 --> 03:41:03,190
Yeah, this bit, there's so many games

3454
03:41:03,190 --> 03:41:07,090
that I just wanna play co-op or not.

3455
03:41:07,090 --> 03:41:09,409
They just go in a line and then you do one

3456
03:41:09,409 --> 03:41:11,209
and then one gets put behind you,

3457
03:41:11,209 --> 03:41:13,479
you see it, you wanna do it.

3458
03:41:13,479 --> 03:41:18,920
Well, I'll give you just a perfect example of this.

3459
03:41:18,920 --> 03:41:21,520
The SWAT series.

3460
03:41:21,520 --> 03:41:26,590
Me and Star were going to play SWAT,

3461
03:41:26,590 --> 03:41:28,270
like SWAT 3, SWAT 4.

3462
03:41:29,430 --> 03:41:31,840
There's no online anymore.

3463
03:41:31,840 --> 03:41:35,299
We were going to do this like five years ago.

3464
03:41:35,299 --> 03:41:37,940
We just, it was just too much for pain in the ass.

3465
03:41:37,940 --> 03:41:41,500
We've been talking about that for like fucking every year.

3466
03:41:41,860 --> 03:41:44,340
Star and I are just like, oh yeah, we'll do it.

3467
03:41:44,340 --> 03:41:47,360
It was always just a pain in the ass to do.

3468
03:41:47,360 --> 03:41:49,479
But that was a conversation that we would have

3469
03:41:49,479 --> 03:41:55,690
over almost a half decade.

3470
03:41:55,690 --> 03:41:57,649
SWAT 4 multiplayer still works.

3471
03:41:57,649 --> 03:41:59,329
You just have to get it from GOG.

3472
03:42:02,969 --> 03:42:07,219
Is that for real?

3473
03:42:07,219 --> 03:42:09,579
I always thought you had to get in a server

3474
03:42:09,579 --> 03:42:12,020
and you had to make a server or something.

3475
03:42:12,020 --> 03:42:18,030
I'll have to look into that.

3476
03:42:18,030 --> 03:42:20,059
I'll have to look into that.

3477
03:42:20,059 --> 03:42:20,899
He doesn't know.

3478
03:42:20,899 --> 03:42:28,840
No, I don't know.

3479
03:42:28,840 --> 03:42:30,200
It's super easy.

3480
03:42:30,200 --> 03:42:31,920
All right, I'll figure it out.

3481
03:42:31,920 --> 03:42:34,909
All right, well, add it to the list

3482
03:42:34,909 --> 03:42:38,610
after beautiful Joe one and two.

3483
03:42:38,610 --> 03:42:40,850
So many games I want to play now.

3484
03:42:40,850 --> 03:42:46,000
Oh, too many games.

3485
03:42:46,000 --> 03:42:47,040
But thank you, Gray the Cutler.

3486
03:42:47,040 --> 03:42:49,030
Thanks for the 300 bits.

3487
03:42:49,030 --> 03:42:52,200
Stephunky Chicken, thanks for the 400 bits.

3488
03:42:52,200 --> 03:42:53,360
The best root beer is mug.

3489
03:42:53,360 --> 03:42:55,200
That's a weird way to say A and W.

3490
03:42:55,200 --> 03:42:56,440
Well, I didn't say it was the best.

3491
03:42:56,440 --> 03:42:59,040
I just said it was the one, I said it was really good.

3492
03:42:59,040 --> 03:43:02,959
Did I say it was the best?

3493
03:43:02,959 --> 03:43:04,760
I didn't say it was the best, did I?

3494
03:43:04,760 --> 03:43:09,219
I did.

3495
03:43:09,219 --> 03:43:10,739
Oh, well, I probably shouldn't have said that.

3496
03:43:10,739 --> 03:43:12,469
I misspoke.

3497
03:43:12,469 --> 03:43:13,309
I misspoke.

3498
03:43:20,829 --> 03:43:23,260
But thank you, Stephunky Chicken.

3499
03:43:23,260 --> 03:43:26,100
Mehdi Marin, thanks for the 500 bits.

3500
03:43:26,100 --> 03:43:27,659
Hey, Germo.

3501
03:43:27,659 --> 03:43:28,739
Yeah.

3502
03:43:28,739 --> 03:43:30,260
Were you ever considering returning the games

3503
03:43:30,260 --> 03:43:32,180
in the Monster Hunter series?

3504
03:43:32,180 --> 03:43:33,860
The Switch has a couple games in world recently

3505
03:43:33,860 --> 03:43:35,780
got the Iceborne expansion.

3506
03:43:35,780 --> 03:43:37,979
And was there any reason you never returned?

3507
03:43:40,010 --> 03:43:41,170
I just think that after a while,

3508
03:43:41,170 --> 03:43:45,829
it's almost like streaming an MMO in a way.

3509
03:43:45,829 --> 03:43:47,190
You know the thing that you're going to do.

3510
03:43:47,190 --> 03:43:50,790
You're gonna go do the same thing at least.

3511
03:43:50,790 --> 03:43:52,229
Well, we're gonna kill this monster

3512
03:43:52,229 --> 03:43:53,629
like three or four times.

3513
03:43:53,629 --> 03:43:56,909
I think I got most of what I wanted out of it on stream.

3514
03:43:58,579 --> 03:44:00,700
Grind, not necessarily like the grind,

3515
03:44:00,700 --> 03:44:10,159
but when I turn on a stream, I'd rather do that off stream.

3516
03:44:10,159 --> 03:44:11,360
Not that I don't think the game would be,

3517
03:44:11,360 --> 03:44:13,959
I think it's boring, that's not the right word.

3518
03:44:13,959 --> 03:44:21,120
But it just takes a long time to do stuff in Monster Hunter.

3519
03:44:24,209 --> 03:44:26,489
There's a lot of setup and then there's a lot,

3520
03:44:26,489 --> 03:44:29,850
oh, you're just kind of going for that one weapon.

3521
03:44:29,850 --> 03:44:30,690
I need that tail.

3522
03:44:30,690 --> 03:44:31,530
I need that tail.

3523
03:44:31,530 --> 03:44:32,370
I need that tail.

3524
03:44:32,370 --> 03:44:33,209
I need that tail.

3525
03:44:33,209 --> 03:44:34,030
I need that tail.

3526
03:44:34,030 --> 03:44:34,870
I need that tail.

3527
03:44:34,870 --> 03:44:35,709
I need that tail.

3528
03:44:35,709 --> 03:44:36,530
I need that tail.

3529
03:44:36,530 --> 03:44:37,370
I got the tail.

3530
03:44:37,370 --> 03:44:38,209
I need that claw.

3531
03:44:38,209 --> 03:44:39,030
I need that claw.

3532
03:44:39,030 --> 03:44:39,870
I need that claw.

3533
03:44:39,870 --> 03:44:42,459
I need that claw.

3534
03:44:42,459 --> 03:44:44,020
I need that claw.

3535
03:44:44,020 --> 03:44:45,989
I need that claw.

3536
03:44:45,989 --> 03:44:49,579
I need that tail.

3537
03:44:49,579 --> 03:44:51,020
I need that tooth.

3538
03:44:51,020 --> 03:44:52,700
And it ends up going something like this.

3539
03:44:52,700 --> 03:44:53,520
I need that claw.

3540
03:44:53,520 --> 03:44:54,360
I need that tooth.

3541
03:44:54,360 --> 03:44:55,180
I need that tail.

3542
03:44:55,180 --> 03:44:56,020
I need that tooth.

3543
03:44:56,020 --> 03:44:56,860
I need that tail.

3544
03:44:56,860 --> 03:44:57,700
I need that tail.

3545
03:44:57,700 --> 03:44:58,520
I need that tooth.

3546
03:44:58,520 --> 03:45:01,780
I need that tail.

3547
03:45:01,780 --> 03:45:05,850
I need that tail.

3548
03:45:05,850 --> 03:45:06,690
I need that tail.

3549
03:45:06,690 --> 03:45:07,530
I need that tail.

3550
03:45:07,530 --> 03:45:09,059
I need that tail.

3551
03:45:09,059 --> 03:45:09,879
I need that tail.

3552
03:45:09,879 --> 03:45:12,299
I need that tail.

3553
03:45:12,299 --> 03:45:13,139
I need that tail.

3554
03:45:13,639 --> 03:45:14,459
I need that claw.

3555
03:45:14,459 --> 03:45:15,299
I need that tail.

3556
03:45:15,299 --> 03:45:19,000
I need that claw.

3557
03:45:19,000 --> 03:45:23,350
And then I kind of just give up.

3558
03:45:23,350 --> 03:45:24,629
Sans, hold on.

3559
03:45:40,909 --> 03:45:44,700
I didn't know I could even do that.

3560
03:45:44,700 --> 03:45:49,000
I need that claw.

3561
03:45:49,000 --> 03:45:51,100
I didn't even know I could do that shit.

3562
03:45:51,100 --> 03:45:53,959
Wow, that's kind of fun.

3563
03:45:53,959 --> 03:45:54,959
Cool assisted improv.

3564
03:45:54,959 --> 03:45:59,819
I didn't know I could even do that.

3565
03:45:59,819 --> 03:46:00,840
Now I'm quieter?

3566
03:46:03,010 --> 03:46:06,229
There we go, there we go.

3567
03:46:06,229 --> 03:46:07,920
But probably the answer is no.

3568
03:46:07,920 --> 03:46:11,170
I don't have a reason to release stream it.

3569
03:46:11,170 --> 03:46:13,530
Lost 100 to me is more fun

3570
03:46:13,530 --> 03:46:15,770
if I can just sit with my mouth open

3571
03:46:15,770 --> 03:46:21,459
and I need that tail for like four hours straight.

3572
03:46:21,459 --> 03:46:22,649
Thank you though.

3573
03:46:22,649 --> 03:46:24,569
Let's get the credits on screen.

3574
03:46:24,569 --> 03:46:26,850
Credits, credits, credits, credits, credits, credits,

3575
03:46:26,850 --> 03:46:40,010
credits, credits, credits, credits, credits.

3576
03:46:40,010 --> 03:46:40,850
Are they actually gonna show up?

3577
03:46:40,850 --> 03:46:44,440
I hope so.

3578
03:46:44,440 --> 03:46:45,600
These are all the subs and all the bits.

3579
03:46:45,600 --> 03:46:47,159
No, they're not all the subs.

3580
03:46:47,159 --> 03:46:50,600
There's no bit credits.

3581
03:46:50,600 --> 03:46:55,629
Play Mortal Kombat 11 on stream, shaking my head.

3582
03:46:55,629 --> 03:46:58,299
But why would I play Mortal Kombat 11

3583
03:46:58,299 --> 03:47:06,729
if I can get diarrhea'd on by people that know how to play?

3584
03:47:06,729 --> 03:47:14,879
Thank you for the subscription guys.

3585
03:47:14,879 --> 03:47:18,229
Have a fantastic rest of your night.

3586
03:47:18,229 --> 03:47:22,590
Thanks for subbing all of you.

3587
03:47:22,590 --> 03:47:24,590
Please do the Kylo Ren voice.

3588
03:47:24,590 --> 03:47:27,909
I can't do the fucking Kylo Ren voice.

3589
03:47:27,909 --> 03:47:41,809
I.

3590
03:47:41,809 --> 03:47:45,620
That's the thing.

3591
03:47:45,620 --> 03:47:50,819
Sometimes you have to do what you're saying to do.

3592
03:47:50,819 --> 03:48:02,659
I know I can feel it.

3593
03:48:02,659 --> 03:48:05,340
That's just Bugleberry with a megaphone on.

3594
03:48:10,809 --> 03:48:13,450
That's a warehouse announcer voice?

3595
03:48:13,489 --> 03:48:14,329
Wait, wait, wait.

3596
03:48:14,329 --> 03:48:27,530
100 spaces down.

3597
03:48:27,530 --> 03:48:28,610
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3598
03:48:28,610 --> 03:48:38,030
It's full glass of salsa.

3599
03:48:38,030 --> 03:48:42,459
That was shattered in aisle number four.

3600
03:48:42,459 --> 03:48:59,409
Jerry, if you could.

3601
03:48:59,409 --> 03:49:01,350
I can do this.

3602
03:49:01,350 --> 03:49:02,750
Check this out, ready?

3603
03:49:02,750 --> 03:49:03,750
I.

3604
03:49:03,750 --> 03:49:05,100
Hold on.

3605
03:49:05,100 --> 03:49:08,200
I.

3606
03:49:08,200 --> 03:49:10,450
I.

3607
03:49:10,450 --> 03:49:11,290
I.

3608
03:49:11,290 --> 03:49:15,760
Wait.

3609
03:49:15,760 --> 03:49:17,569
I.

3610
03:49:17,569 --> 03:49:19,850
Do you know, oh, oh.

3611
03:49:19,850 --> 03:49:20,850
Wait, why is it not working?

3612
03:49:20,850 --> 03:49:23,500
Oh, it's not even on.

3613
03:49:23,500 --> 03:49:26,440
I.

3614
03:49:26,479 --> 03:49:30,639
Oh, it's so much fun to sing.

3615
03:49:30,639 --> 03:49:31,639
This exists too.

3616
03:49:36,729 --> 03:49:38,370
Why would there be a button for this?

3617
03:49:38,370 --> 03:49:40,129
Why would there be a, I'm sorry, guys.

3618
03:49:40,129 --> 03:49:41,729
I'm so nervous.

3619
03:49:41,729 --> 03:49:43,370
I didn't think I was gonna get,

3620
03:49:43,370 --> 03:49:45,649
I didn't think I was gonna have to come up on stage

3621
03:49:45,649 --> 03:49:46,569
and tell you guys anything.

3622
03:49:46,569 --> 03:49:51,209
But seriously, I am so excited for this,

3623
03:49:51,209 --> 03:49:53,079
winning this award.

3624
03:49:53,079 --> 03:49:55,680
And thank you, everybody.

3625
03:49:55,680 --> 03:49:57,360
Thank you for all the support and everything.

3626
03:49:57,360 --> 03:49:58,200
Good night.

3627
03:50:02,620 --> 03:50:05,040
Bye.

3628
03:50:05,920 --> 03:50:09,559
All right, I gotta go.

3629
03:50:09,559 --> 03:50:10,399
I gotta go.

3630
03:50:10,399 --> 03:50:11,239
I gotta get out of here.

3631
03:50:11,239 --> 03:50:12,079
I gotta go.

3632
03:50:12,079 --> 03:50:12,920
I gotta get out of here.

3633
03:50:12,920 --> 03:50:13,760
I gotta go.

3634
03:50:13,760 --> 03:50:14,600
I gotta get out of here.

3635
03:50:14,600 --> 03:50:15,440
I gotta go.

3636
03:50:15,440 --> 03:50:16,559
I gotta get out of here.

3637
03:50:16,559 --> 03:50:19,750
We're gonna raid Box Box tonight.

3638
03:50:19,750 --> 03:50:25,180
Box Box did a double raid over the last few days.

3639
03:50:26,620 --> 03:50:29,500
It was, I think there was a coordinated raid.

3640
03:50:29,500 --> 03:50:32,399
It was two people.

3641
03:50:32,399 --> 03:50:36,559
Go say hello to Box Box.

3642
03:50:36,559 --> 03:50:37,440
I missed a donation.

3643
03:50:37,440 --> 03:50:39,559
What the fuck did he do?

3644
03:50:39,559 --> 03:50:40,600
I did, I missed two.

3645
03:50:40,600 --> 03:50:43,329
Thanks, 300 Bits for Wilcorn.

3646
03:50:43,329 --> 03:50:44,170
Thank you, Wilcorn.

3647
03:50:45,170 --> 03:50:46,129
This is my first donation to anyone.

3648
03:50:46,129 --> 03:50:47,250
I've seen your streams for a while,

3649
03:50:47,250 --> 03:50:54,680
and I've wanted to say thanks for the laughs and good feels.

3650
03:50:54,680 --> 03:50:59,090
That thanks for even considering giving me money.

3651
03:50:59,090 --> 03:50:59,930
Thanks for watching.

3652
03:50:59,930 --> 03:51:02,670
Thanks for being here.

3653
03:51:02,670 --> 03:51:06,790
And then finally, it was one more thousand bit donation

3654
03:51:06,790 --> 03:51:12,889
from Xwar2, thanks to 10 bucks.

3655
03:51:12,889 --> 03:51:18,229
Say, I feel like I'm really bad at Twitch messages.

3656
03:51:18,229 --> 03:51:19,709
I've been enjoying your VODs from Twitch,

3657
03:51:19,709 --> 03:51:20,790
randomly started watching you

3658
03:51:20,790 --> 03:51:24,110
after the first don't talking or you'll explode stream

3659
03:51:24,110 --> 03:51:26,270
because of Twitter.

3660
03:51:26,270 --> 03:51:27,750
I don't really watch Twitch,

3661
03:51:27,750 --> 03:51:29,110
but I've really been enjoying your content.

3662
03:51:29,110 --> 03:51:30,909
You're obviously an inspired and passionate guy,

3663
03:51:30,909 --> 03:51:32,270
and I dig that.

3664
03:51:32,270 --> 03:51:34,270
The bits are for conquering my childhood game,

3665
03:51:34,270 --> 03:51:36,389
Simpsons Hit and Run.

3666
03:51:36,389 --> 03:51:38,319
I'll definitely be sticking around.

3667
03:51:38,319 --> 03:51:40,709
Possibly any more Mountain Blade.

3668
03:51:40,709 --> 03:51:41,750
If I were to go back to Mountain Blade,

3669
03:51:41,750 --> 03:51:43,430
it would have to be with this shitload of VODs.

3670
03:51:43,430 --> 03:51:49,170
Just like a total joke stream.

3671
03:51:49,170 --> 03:51:50,010
But thanks.

3672
03:51:51,239 --> 03:51:57,909
Yeah, Simpsons Hit and Run is a wild experience.

3673
03:51:57,909 --> 03:51:58,750
Play the new one.

3674
03:51:58,750 --> 03:52:00,510
Yeah, Bannerlord's coming out.

3675
03:52:00,510 --> 03:52:02,190
But hasn't Bannerlord been coming out

3676
03:52:02,190 --> 03:52:03,229
for like four years?

3677
03:52:05,360 --> 03:52:11,600
Is it, is that actually gonna come out?

3678
03:52:11,600 --> 03:52:12,440
Sadly, it has.

3679
03:52:12,440 --> 03:52:15,520
Hasn't it been in development for like five plus years?

3680
03:52:15,520 --> 03:52:16,840
Or is it 10 years actually?

3681
03:52:16,840 --> 03:52:19,200
Okay, it's been 10 years.

3682
03:52:19,200 --> 03:52:20,719
Now, but now it has a steam page.

3683
03:52:20,719 --> 03:52:21,959
Really? Okay.

3684
03:52:21,959 --> 03:52:27,120
Now you got me interested.

3685
03:52:27,120 --> 03:52:31,959
See, now I'm interested.

3686
03:52:31,959 --> 03:52:37,440
Yeah, we're gonna go send some love to Boxbox.

3687
03:52:37,440 --> 03:52:41,159
Got a lot of raids from Boxbox recently, like I said.

3688
03:52:41,159 --> 03:52:46,780
Continues to show tons of love to the stream.

3689
03:52:46,780 --> 03:52:49,250
Go say hello.

3690
03:52:49,250 --> 03:52:50,489
See you guys on Sunday.

3691
03:52:50,489 --> 03:52:54,909
Have a good couple nights.

3692
03:52:54,909 --> 03:52:57,250
That was the wrong button.

3693
03:52:57,250 --> 03:53:00,139
That was the right button.

3694
03:53:00,139 --> 03:53:02,329
See you guys Sunday.

3695
03:53:02,329 --> 03:53:03,950
Goodbye.

3696
03:53:03,950 --> 03:53:04,790
Let's raid.

3697
03:53:06,069 --> 03:53:08,600
I will not be participating in the raid.

3698
03:53:08,600 --> 03:53:12,250
I'm going to go out to dinner.

3699
03:53:12,250 --> 03:53:13,170
Give my best.
