1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,740
You're my stab. You're my slash. You're my grab. You're my block. You're my shield.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,580
Maybe I should just do that. It hasn't been a new emote on this channel in

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:19,379
a year. A paid one. I've always made it various forms of attacking and defending.

4
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:29,699
You guys could just kill each other in chat. You guys could have giant medieval wars.

5
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,630
Violence. Medieval violence. Oh, I didn't say hi. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the stream. Good to see you.

6
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,140
We want the dump truck. I'm going to make you guys wait for the dump truck.

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,200
I said this weekend, but it was a lie. Everything I say is a lie. 99.9%

8
00:00:51,159 --> 00:01:08,760
of all the germs that come out of my mouth are a lie. You motherfucker. Oh, all right.

9
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:16,540
How is the virus you downloaded? It's pretty good. Hey, thank you, John Cena is killed.

10
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,750
For the five community cells. If you don't know, in pre-stream,

11
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,299
something wild happens in pre-stream chat every day. Sometimes pre-stream chat is

12
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:42,060
more wild than post than Western Pennsylvania. It's the most god-loving patriotic part of America.

13
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:57,909
Current stream chat. Current stream chat. You did this joke already. I love it.

14
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,290
What I'm saying is pre-stream chat usually has something crazy going on.

15
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:12,629
Why don't you just hang out there? I know there's a little pre-stream chat versus

16
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,669
Discord users, like LOL. I'm a pre-stream chat user. I'm not a Discord user. I don't go to the

17
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:24,789
Discord. All those plebs in the pre-stream chat. They're in the Discord, are they?

18
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,580
You don't have to have two completely set. You can all act as one.

19
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:37,219
Where do I stand on that matter? Where do I stand on that issue?

20
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:45,300
Well, Western Pennsylvania is the most god-loving...

21
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:54,460
All right, we're gonna play House Flipper. The DLC came out. Stop doing that.

22
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,740
If you don't know what that is, I can't even explain it to you.

23
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:12,469
The DLC is Cyberpunk. I think they made this DLC because a Cyberpunk is coming out and they just,

24
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:18,069
I guess, want people to download this too. They even say in the patch notes,

25
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,699
I know you're really excited for a game that's coming out soon. So are we. So here, download

26
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:36,840
this too. I mean, it's pretty... It's actually called the Cyberpunk DLC. Oh, look, that's fine.

27
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,120
They're jumping on a little bit of a trend here, but House Flipper is one of the best games

28
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:54,389
ever released. That's fine. That's okay. I'm okay with that. I won't be able to play

29
00:03:54,389 --> 00:04:00,280
Cyberpunk 2077. I don't even know if I'm gonna play Cyberpunk. It took me like a year to watch

30
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,000
Infinity War. I don't know. I feel like it's something I... Everybody's gonna be obsessed

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,539
with it. There's gonna be memes everywhere that I'm not... I don't even want to look at them.

32
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,740
Is it weird that, like, there's so much excitement around it that, like, I'm losing excitement

33
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,660
because I know that there's so much excitement around it and I know that if I'm not as excited

34
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,300
as everybody else, that I'm gonna get let down because I'm not as excited? That's not even a

35
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:38,170
hipster thing. I think I just... I don't want to be so excited for something. That's contrary. No,

36
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,779
no. I didn't say the game was not gonna be good. I just said, like, it's... It's like, okay, if,

37
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:50,180
like, God was... Okay, if we heard that God was going to open the clouds in a week and talk to

38
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,930
the people, we all knew it was gonna happen. God in the fucking sky was gonna part the clouds and

39
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:01,290
be like, ladies and gentlemen, it's me. And everyone's waiting, like, holy shit, here comes God.

40
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,029
And a week goes by and here... Everyone's outside with their binoculars, here he comes,

41
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:11,829
this is the day. And, like, the clouds part. It's like, holy shit, everybody, like,

42
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:16,060
everyone's holding their hands, it's God. And it's like a... It's like Mr. Peanut. It's like a

43
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,819
peanut with googly eyes. Like, falls down, like, into the... Like, into the stage. And it's like,

44
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:28,220
it's me, everybody. Mr.... It's like a big peanut. And it's like, oh, is that real? It's God. It's me.

45
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,180
I don't want you doing any fucked up stuff anymore. Like, oh, you're supposed to have, like,

46
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,259
a big beard and, like, huge, like, Zeus with lightning bolts and stuff. Oh, that's cool, but

47
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:51,740
you're a peanut. Is that a South Park joke? The Family Guy joke. The Simpsons joke. That was a

48
00:05:51,740 --> 00:06:00,410
South Park episode. That was a Family Guy episode. That was on an episode of Friends. I actually... I

49
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:06,250
was actually talking about this. Like, when are they gonna add Ross from Friends to, like, Smash

50
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:15,180
Brothers? Or, like, Mortal Kombat 11? They so... They so badly want to put, like, every TV show,

51
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,680
the Ninja Turtles are in smite now. Can you imagine his intro? Like, do-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.

52
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:32,259
And he throws up, like, the... Here's, like, my invitation. He's already in. All right,

53
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:39,220
let's play. Let's go. I'm already ready. Wait, can I get... I could get DMC'd for that?

54
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:54,459
No, I couldn't. If I went... Do-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. Is that... You just triggered it. Did I try?

55
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,430
All right, if this part of the VOD gets muted, then we all have to laugh about this, like, tomorrow.

56
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:07,639
Let me see if I can get this right. It's gonna be hard. So... Everybody likes to sing this first

57
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:15,189
part because it's, like, the one that... Look at how good of a singer I am. So... So no one told...

58
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:24,810
No, I'll get it. So no one told you life was gonna be this way. So no one told you... I would laugh

59
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:33,699
so fucking hard if that actually got claimed. If it does, if it does, if for some reason that could

60
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:40,019
happen. Fuck this whole thing, right? If it gets claimed. Like, who cares? I literally just said,

61
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:50,490
like, four sentences. I said, like, a sentence back to back. If you can get claimed for, like,

62
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,339
humming a fucking song, when are they gonna start, like, bolting our chairs to the ground

63
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,579
and putting fucking VR headsets on us and, like, you know, you stay in there and just enjoy,

64
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:16,329
enjoy the virtual world? Don't say anything. Don't do anything. It's a Black Mirror episode.

65
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:25,560
They did it on South Park. Yeah, okay. Who cares? Why's there no audio? Do you guys hear anything?

66
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,080
Oh shit. Okay, that was really, really odd. I don't hear anything, right? And then I went...

67
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:43,820
It's like somebody's, like, walking in my room. Making too many South Park references. Get them.

68
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:50,860
Sneak in. All right, so this is the DLC. Thank you to... What's the name of the website that I

69
00:08:50,860 --> 00:09:03,350
got this from? The name of this save file is the website name where I downloaded it from.

70
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,149
I didn't even explain that, by the way. Okay, so listen. So in pre-stream chat, I've realized

71
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:16,919
that when I reinstalled Windows, I lost all of my save data. No, no, no, no, no. Stay.

72
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:25,080
And I couldn't get the cloud to download anything. I gotta turn this shit down. It's gonna be so loud.

73
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,379
So I couldn't get... I couldn't download my cloud save. I don't know. I have no idea why.

74
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:37,850
Right? So I had to go on the internet and download a fucking save file that had all the stuff unlocked.

75
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:45,669
What is this? Is that music? Yeah, the family guy house is gone. My garden house is gone.

76
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,970
Let's take a look in here, though. All right. This is the cyberpunk house.

77
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:58,809
I'm just waiting to look out this window and like... Bang! It's a bird. Like a seagull that

78
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:10,440
smashes to get Keanu Reeves' face. Hey, see you next week, man. Oh, that is gonna be so satisfying.

79
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:33,289
Yes. Yes. This is the kind of YouTube video that I watch. Those of you that are saying,

80
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:37,820
why do you watch like... Would you watch wood cutting videos? Yes. If there was a

81
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:51,019
clean Windows video, I would watch it. These are kids' videos. No, there's no surprise eggs.

82
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,730
And those are stupid. This is cool. This is adult surprise eggs, okay?

83
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:09,750
Don't you guys agree? Like power washing videos? It's like, oh yeah, really get in there and like,

84
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:16,549
get that grout. Oh yeah, get the grout, man. That's the same thing as, open that thing. Open it.

85
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:31,750
Oh, Spider-Man's in there. Yes. Open another one. How is it different? Humans are so... We're just

86
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:39,159
a couple of math problems up there. Everybody likes stuff like this. It doesn't matter. It's

87
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:57,700
just different versions. Are you high? No. What? Are you? He's not... I'm not high. I swear to God.

88
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:06,889
He's... I am not. I really am not. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. You're freaking me out, man.

89
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,500
I'm not. I'm not. You're freaking me out. Stop. I'm gonna turn this free mode off, I think. You're

90
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,899
freaking me out. I'm freaked out. What the fuck, dude? I thought I was just looking outside of my

91
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,419
own like apartment window. What the fuck, man? You guys are freaking me the fuck out.

92
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:49,929
No one told you life was gonna be DMCA'd. Let's try to get the whole thing muted. It's like these

93
00:12:49,929 --> 00:13:15,350
record companies are stuck in second gear. Minus two. Stop. Come on. I'm making like a fun DMCA

94
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:32,490
joke. You don't think that's fun? Don't stop. These windows are so big. I don't... I really don't like

95
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:40,120
windows like this. I'm sorry. I don't... I... There has to be a curtain here. The amount of times

96
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:47,190
that I've like passed out on my couch just like naked. Everybody can just look into your entire

97
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,309
house. I don't want you to see me cooking like macaroni and cheese and shit. Like get the fuck

98
00:13:50,309 --> 00:14:05,269
out of here. Who wants to like be watched eating a box of pizza? Everyone's like, oh wow, look at all

99
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:10,149
this open light. Yeah, that's cool. For like 10 minutes, close the fucking blinds. I don't want

100
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:17,750
people looking in my house, looking at my apartment. Oh shit, I gotta get even higher up.

101
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:30,500
First of all, hold on, let's take care of these wires. What kind of soda is it? Why are you always

102
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:40,919
naked? Don't you... That's the way humans are supposed to be. I swear to god, I am not high.

103
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:49,240
I don't... I don't even want to get into this. I don't even want to get into this. Let me clean

104
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:58,149
this shit up. Why is it so dark in here? That doesn't turn light on. This is just like what's

105
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:11,000
behind every streamer. They have like all these cool things in the background. Just like the lights

106
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:25,080
and like blinking things and shows and stuff. I need one of those. Oh, the lever? Wait, why did

107
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:38,970
that just turn on? Wait, I didn't even do anything. Chill. This is not. That looks bad. This apartment

108
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:47,940
is from like 2100. They have an air conditioner from 1980. Interesting. Look at the fridge. Look

109
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:59,580
at this. Look, you got like a grandma radiator. Oh, turn that off. Horrible. It's vintage. No,

110
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:11,299
vintage in 2100 would be like 2150 or 2050. You can sit in the gamer chair too. All right,

111
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:18,659
clean this place up. Hold on. Just delete. I don't want like toxic waste in my room. Why are these

112
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:32,700
here? Why would you have that in your house? That's because it's punk. It's punk? What is it? Maybe

113
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:38,139
it is a YouTuber house. Because what the fuck do these people even do with all this slime video

114
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:47,350
shit? It's just a ton of slime videos. What do you actually do with that stuff? So they make the

115
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,629
slime video. They make like five tubs of slime. Then what do they do? What do you do? Where does

116
00:16:52,629 --> 00:17:05,259
it go? Do they just throw it away? Do they pour it down the drain? Isn't that like horrible? They

117
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:22,250
sell it in smaller quantities. Sell it? They sell, they, they slime tube. I don't, what do you mean

118
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:29,450
they sell it? What does this say? All right, get rid of it. I don't want it. I have to make my cool

119
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,250
gamer apartment. I'm actually into this. All right, hold on. Sell the pizza. Sell the pizza.

120
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:43,579
Energy drinks. Disgusting. By the way, stop drinking those. Just please. Just don't drink

121
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:57,029
them. Just stop drinking them. Just not, don't do that anymore. I'm serious. Oh, don't, stop doing

122
00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:07,559
that. Says the guy who drinks truly. No, no, no, no, no. Let me, let me, let me correct that. Says

123
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:15,160
the guy who drank truly one time ever in his life on stream or off stream because he got so involved

124
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,640
in the idea that it might be funny if he drank them on stream that he ruined his reputation.

125
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,859
That's the only time I've ever consumed one of those. Ever. I've never, only ever.

126
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:40,519
Old, old, old. This is trash. This is like junked. Okay, is this even a sink or is this a big fake

127
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:55,099
wood sink? This is wood. Get rid of this. It's not futuristic. How is that futuristic?

128
00:18:55,579 --> 00:19:09,779
What? Cold, cold plus ice, water, temperature, temperature in a jar, fridge mode, thermometer

129
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:24,380
mode, or shopping mode. What kind of fridge is this? I don't understand. All right. What else?

130
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:30,490
We've got an empty container, a takeout container. This needs, this property needs to be cleaned up.

131
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:36,339
What do you think I'm doing? How do I get up there? Oh, I can just fly up here. All right, here we go.

132
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:49,660
Put it in fridge mode. Your milk is boiling. I only buy shelf stable milk. So, okay, kid.

133
00:19:50,730 --> 00:20:01,059
I only buy shelf stable milk, like shelf stable almond milk. Shelf stable. Hey, you know, those

134
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:07,539
are you guys that are from England? Oh, you English. Isn't that, don't they keep milk like room

135
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:12,500
temperature or something? Isn't like milk in a box? You know, the drinking cold milk is weird

136
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:28,869
to Europeans, right? Isn't it? Oh, that's France. There's one of the, there's a European, yeah,

137
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:32,390
there's a European country that thinks that like Americans drinking cold milk every day is just

138
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:52,700
weird, right? Putting eggs in the fridge will make it low. Right. Boxed long life milk exists. Yeah.

139
00:20:53,339 --> 00:21:10,460
Why does everybody think I'm so weird? This is like a thing. You are. I am not even weird. I'm not.

140
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,980
I talked to my mother on the phone last night and she told me I wasn't. She said I was perfect,

141
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:22,660
I was a perfect special boy. I said, thank you, mom. So, sorry, my mother knows more than you.

142
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:43,259
After I told her that I peed all over my iPhone. Oh my God. I have to get mad about this. I am very

143
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:49,980
mad. Very, very, very mad at Apple. Apple, that's right. I'm coming after you with a little bit of,

144
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,660
with a little bit of fucking problem here. A little bit of a rant here. So did you see what

145
00:21:53,660 --> 00:22:00,440
they announced? You see, they announced the, the iPhone 12 mini, the little phone, the little

146
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,680
fucking phone that I talked about how badly I wanted. They made the, they made the iPhone SE.

147
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:15,910
Okay. iPhone SE was a iPhone 4 chassis, right? They come up with the iPhone SE 2. Uh, we're not

148
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:20,309
going to make it that smaller chassis anymore. It's now a big chassis. Okay. Well, what the fuck?

149
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:23,190
And I got that one. That's what I got. I got an iPhone SE, the new one, because that's the

150
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:28,309
smallest we're ever going to make it. Then these fucking, God damn it, they made it a tiny phone.

151
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:33,640
They made the little one, that iPhone 12 mini. Why did you do it? I just got the SE. What the

152
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:44,470
fuck are you doing? Why did they make the iPhone SE 2 bigger, but the iPhone 12 now has a mini

153
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:51,940
version? Why did they wait so long to announce that? Like, why don't they announce that shit

154
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:59,160
like a year ago? Like, what the hell? I'm so annoyed by that. First world problems. Yeah,

155
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,039
I'm just saying, like, why would they do that? They came up with the SE and then they'd be like,

156
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:08,329
oh, by the way, here's the little one that you wanted. And that's, by the way, it's like,

157
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:13,059
it's like 1,100 bucks. I don't even know how much it is. It's probably that much.

158
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:19,849
Are they just trying to bleed out just phones? Just like, just, just have like a trickle of

159
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:33,579
new phones every three months for people to buy? Is that the, is that the plan? It is. I,

160
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:43,099
when I saw that, I was like, I can't even believe it. I mean, how have you not realized that? No,

161
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:52,009
I, I mean, ooh, I like this little place, except I don't like all these. I actually hate these signs

162
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:59,640
and they're everywhere. The amount of those like chill, good vibes, relax, love, eat,

163
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:06,859
eat, play, relax. Like what, is this a Dave and Buster's? Why do we have to have signs that say

164
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:22,309
like, oh, eat, relax, play, game on? No, get rid of these. I don't want that. Chill. It takes up so

165
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:28,180
much. You could put something, a big cool painting here. That's what I'm going to do. Is there a

166
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:41,190
mirror? Eat and then sleep. Imagine just having one that said that. What, oh, just having one that

167
00:24:41,269 --> 00:25:00,619
just says, I am alive. That's it. Ooh, a little shoe rack. This is cool. Did I clean the whole

168
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:11,539
place? I did. Oh shit. This is like almost over. This is like almost done. I always beat the level

169
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:15,700
and this is the only level that exists. Looks like I have to go back to the, oh, the family guy has

170
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:23,369
this. Wait, we can see with the, this save game company. The DLC is almost over. It was free

171
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:34,089
though. Let's be clear. What about the toilet? Yeah, I got it. I got it. I got it. There's mold

172
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:41,339
everywhere. Oh, this is good. All right. What else? What's dirty over here? There's new items too.

173
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:53,849
I'm not giving up. He hates free DLC. No, I just making a, just making a point. iPhone 12 mini. Get

174
00:25:53,849 --> 00:26:03,690
the fuck out of here. Like, come on man. Okay. I have a question. If I went into like the Apple

175
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:09,609
store and I said, Hey, uh, I, I broke my iPhone. My iPhone's broken. I have like Apple Care. I can

176
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:15,140
get a new one, right? Can I, can I, can I, can I like get a new one? Can I like get a new Apple

177
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:21,349
mini for free? Is that how that works? Well, uh, that depends. What happened to it? I dropped it

178
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:26,309
down the stairs. Oh wow. That's exactly what we cover. Yeah. I dropped it. I fell down the stairs

179
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:35,420
and went crashed. See, look at the broken screen. Are you sure you didn't piss on it? No, no, no,

180
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:41,660
no. Of course not. Why would I? That's disgusting. No, I didn't. You're trying to give me a piss phone?

181
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:57,500
No, no, of course not. Of course I wouldn't. I gotta move this. Oh shit. No. What? No. I have to

182
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:10,119
every individual book has to be moved. Oh my God. Just burn them. I, I can't.

183
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:33,369
No, I gotta get rid of my Funko Pop collection. This is a lot of books. How many of you guys are

184
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:40,410
like me where, uh, you have like four books that you've owned for 10 years and you may have read

185
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:48,940
the first four pages of one of them? I don't know. There's a lot of books. Okay. What's dirty?

186
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:56,039
What's dirty back here? Nothing. I mean, this is, this washing machine is pretty. Where's the dryer?

187
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:05,190
I don't have a, how do I dry my clothes? All right. Well, we don't need this anymore because

188
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:18,259
I don't have any more books. Wait, you put the TV above the washing machine. Uh, that's, that's,

189
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:28,099
this seems terrible. No, that's gotta move. That's gotta move. And the couch is facing this way

190
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:44,309
towards the staircase. Um, that's, uh, odd design. TV on the stairs. Yeah, we're gonna have like a

191
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:56,779
little TV station over here. Wait, dirt. It's called House Flipper. I know. We're gonna get

192
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:04,119
something better. That doesn't match anyways. We need something, we need something metal and

193
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:10,299
like we need like stainless steel floor apparently. Is this steel floor? It's like

194
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:22,569
aluminum floor. Shit. I gotta get up there. Can you play the arcade machine? I don't think you can.

195
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:28,779
Maybe let's just make this place an arcade. I just sleep up here and then I charge people

196
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:42,759
to like come into my apartment. Almost. Come on. Where's this last piece? No, I don't want to move

197
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:53,140
this. I will if I have to. Wait, here we go. Not again. No, I'm gonna actually make an apartment

198
00:29:53,140 --> 00:30:05,960
this time. This doesn't work in here either. Why is it cappa? Okay, why is it already capping?

199
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,980
Cappa, cappa, cappa, cappa. For what? Yeah, this has got to go too. Like, get out of here.

200
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,119
If that's where the washing machine is going to go, then the desk has to move somewhere else.

201
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:30,579
Upstairs. No, it could stay there, but that, yeah, that's not going to be there. I feel like

202
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:45,109
this is taking up a lot of space. Rip apartment. What do you mean rip apartment? This scares the

203
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,750
shit out of me too. I feel like at like two o'clock in the morning I'm going to walk through here and

204
00:30:47,750 --> 00:31:03,400
this thing's going to just like chop my like fucking nose off. That's not what I said. Okay,

205
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:09,380
everything's clean. Now I need to furnish and move some stuff around. Let's move some shit around.

206
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,660
I don't even know what this is. What's the practicality of this thing? Get rid of it.

207
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:22,819
I don't want this. That's a laptop. Laptop with, holy shit, that's awesome. Do they make those?

208
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:31,799
Little tiny extra monitors? They don't make those? Well, they absolutely should. That's a really good

209
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:43,140
idea. Little pop-out monitor. So you could, it would be like a second and third monitor. You

210
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:48,819
could put little things on it. Like if you're working on a project or something or you...

211
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:54,440
I actually like that idea. They could, and they could go in, right? They could fold kind of into

212
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:05,420
the top of the laptop. That'd be pretty cool. But for what? I don't, because sometimes you want to

213
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:13,210
have like more than, oh well, never mind. I don't need that. All right, well then explain to me why

214
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:20,009
you need this. Those of you that are saying, oh I can't believe he wants like a small extra screen

215
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:41,369
on his laptop. So why would there be seven or eight fucking monitors? Stocks. For his Zorn. Oh yeah?

216
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:45,130
You're gonna, you're gonna have eight different windows open for Zorn?

217
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:55,849
You sure about that? Because uh, Nancy and Greg in apartment fucking, floor fucking 20,

218
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:09,289
apartment A, can see what you're doing in here. You want, and you're sure you want to do that?

219
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:14,099
One for Zoom calls. I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna really try to figure out what I would do

220
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:21,240
with this many monitors. Okay, here we go. I have three, by the way, right now. So this is like the

221
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,000
main monitor where you do all, okay like let's say that you have like a game or a project or

222
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:32,940
one. Okay. Okay, let's say this is like chat. I just have one monitor for chat typically and

223
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:38,859
maybe like a preview window, okay? Other monitor is for miscellaneous. Like if I have like a YouTube

224
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:46,920
video or something that I need to grab quickly is on monitor three. What would go on the other ones?

225
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:53,799
Okay, so you have necessity, practicality, and fun. Okay, let's just, let's just say that there was

226
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:59,799
porn on this one, okay? There's porn all over this one. What do you do with these ones? Okay,

227
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:05,509
let's say the stocks on this one. There's like a, like a few stock tickers. Let's just say,

228
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:09,500
let's just say, let's just say, let's just say, right? I know, I said that a lot. What about this

229
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:15,719
one? Music. Why can't you have music on this one? Just minimize with like a Spotify playlist. You

230
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:29,659
don't need a, you need a full monitor to listen to music? News feed. I need to see the queue. So

231
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:36,699
you, okay, let me, you want to see the queue for Spotify on a full monitor with it powered on 24

232
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:47,349
7 while you're here. How much does Spotify cost a month? Was it 10 bucks, 20 bucks a month?

233
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:56,309
It's 10 bucks a month. How much does it cost to leave a computer monitor on 24 7? Monthly,

234
00:34:56,309 --> 00:35:08,519
you think? Two dollars a month? Dollar a month? Two dollars a month? So you're paying like 30%

235
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:16,889
extra for your Spotify playlist essentially. Nothing. I don't pay my electricity. Okay, well,

236
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:23,349
I don't know how old you are, but eventually you're going to. Wait, do you have like solar?

237
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:27,019
Are you one of the houses that has solar that always talks about,

238
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:36,519
I haven't paid electricity bill in four years, dude. I got solar. You are? Oh god, that makes

239
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:47,380
me jealous. Yeah, my electricity bill last month was two dollars. Yeah, yeah, it was, wasn't it?

240
00:35:47,380 --> 00:36:02,070
Don't you, can't you get like paid to have solar and like energy producers too? Electricity is

241
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,989
dirty. Yeah. All right. Well, when are we going to move away from like tubes that push gas into

242
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:09,989
your house? I'd be happy about that one, but I don't, I don't like gas. I hate it. It's scary.

243
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:17,670
Right now there are a series of tubes that are pushing gas into your house. Just it's waiting,

244
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,349
just ready for you to call it in. It's like, wait, it's like, come on, call gas into your lines.

245
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:30,329
Right now there's like bubbling, burning hot oil, just sitting somewhere in a tank,

246
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:42,280
just like I'm ready to explode somewhere in your house. That sucks. Actually, this bet's pretty

247
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:50,730
good. I was, I'm sorry, I can't help it. I just did, I know, I didn't mean to.

248
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,659
Okay, I've been picking up the same items and putting them down. Let's get some, I see dirt.

249
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:12,500
Okay, very important. Let's get a couch. They added a bunch of new items too. This is cyberpunk only.

250
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:27,300
Bathroom, a cyberpunk bathroom? A dentin shower? This, I don't think, this looks like unsafe to me.

251
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:39,400
I feel like this thing's going to close me in and just kill me. All right, yeah, I want,

252
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,119
I want that shower. We're going to have to cyberpunk this thing. You know, cyberpunk's

253
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:47,300
coming out in a week or so, man. Everyone get, I'm so, I'm wicked excited for it. I'm not going to

254
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:57,219
play it on this stream. You probably won't see it ever. Let's go! Hype for cyberpunk 2077. I might

255
00:37:57,219 --> 00:38:19,349
though. I don't know. I'm thinking about it. Let's go. You think it's a game that I would like? Oh,

256
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:28,699
shit. Ah, you can't even leave. Yeah, you can. You know, I used to have, I used to have a fridge

257
00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:36,579
that was like this, where I, it was way too big for the space, but they got it in, they put it in,

258
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,190
and I was like, it's too, but I don't even want to go through the trouble of having you take it.

259
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:52,869
So I don't care. It's a little too long, but I don't care. I guess I could crush the walls,

260
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:55,909
but how am I, I don't have any, I can't crush this wall. This place is not even,

261
00:38:55,909 --> 00:39:06,010
it's not big enough for me to build a big one. We got a, what, we got a link? I don't understand.

262
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,369
This is Elbertson's class. I don't like, what the fuck are you doing?

263
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:22,739
Okay, we have our shower. What, there's no special toilet? I don't like shit like this,

264
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:26,730
because you know, the bigger the thing is, the more of a hum it has in your house.

265
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:31,349
Very important knowledge for you guys to know. The larger the appliances, the more it's going to go,

266
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,909
and you're going to, you know, you're going to notice it one day, and you're going to be

267
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:50,340
so pissed off. Click the relevant link. That was the wrong link. What?

268
00:39:50,340 --> 00:40:04,230
Choose your seat. Pre-order now. What? Is this, could you do, is this actually, this is cool,

269
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:10,940
actually. I don't hate this at all. I think this is actually really cool.

270
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:21,130
Pre-order. Now that's a collector's edition I could get behind. If the collector's edition

271
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:29,980
just gave you a new toilet that you could install, I'd actually be into that. It'd be kind of cool.

272
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:40,980
Free toilet. Well, no, a toilet's, what, how much is a toilet? That would make sense for

273
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,099
a collector's edition. A toilet's like two or three hundred bucks. How much are collector's

274
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:55,079
editions of games? Like five, six hundred sometimes? Three hundred, two hundred? You know,

275
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:10,300
just give me a copy of cyberpunk and the toilet. That's good for me. Yeah, but does it, there has

276
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,179
to be a big, big asterisk there that says you need to install it yourself. You need to hire a plumber

277
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:22,230
to install it. Imagine being the plumber that installs the cyberpunk toilet. Yeah, I'm going

278
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,030
to need some work done. I'm going to need a plumber to come over here. It's like, okay, what do you

279
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,429
need? I need you to install a toilet for me. Okay, that sounds easy. I feel like this would be weird

280
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:38,860
as a plumber. Be like, what the fuck is this? A cyberpunk collector's edition toilet. What else

281
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:48,179
I got here? Keanu Reeves shows up to do it. Keanu Reeves doesn't even, doesn't know how to do that,

282
00:41:48,179 --> 00:42:00,329
though, does he? That collector's edition would be like twenty grand. Hey, I'm here to install

283
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:09,460
your toilet for you. Make sure you download cyberpunk the second it comes out next week, man.

284
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:13,940
I have no idea how to install toilets, but I'm going to try. I'm going to look at it and do it

285
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:22,119
a little bit, man. He comes with like a hard hat on and a bunch of like wrenches. He walks in and

286
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:27,159
he just introduces like the install and then the actual plumber comes in and installs the toilet

287
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:41,019
for you. That might be, that would be worth it. All right, I need a bed. Furniture, here we go.

288
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:48,579
Ooh, I like some of this stuff. Some of this stuff is cool. I would get that this would be an awesome

289
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:54,250
bed. Well, no, not really, actually. Does this fold down? Okay, if the top part folded down,

290
00:42:54,250 --> 00:43:07,909
it would be like a futon. Armchairs on a bed. No, it's not a germo bed. It's a bed that would

291
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:16,360
if it was bigger. I thought it was bigger. I didn't know it was that small. Just leave in here.

292
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:22,550
Put like a little pillow and a blanket in there and like crawl in the cubby and like lie down

293
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:32,969
lengthwise. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's got to be one of these. Just how about line up 10

294
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:51,559
gamer chairs and take the arms off? Ooh, I like this. I actually really like this. Okay, a mattress.

295
00:43:52,119 --> 00:44:04,980
Let's make the mattress a blue. It's an Alienware bed. Yeah, the big alien head symbol is right

296
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:17,300
there on the sheets. I like that. No, not that. I like that. I would sleep in this. But unfortunately,

297
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:27,690
it's too big. Or is it? Or is it? Hold on. I don't like that. Get rid of that. Get rid of this too.

298
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:36,679
What is here? It's outlets. Okay. It's too big. It's not too big. Just wait. Get rid of all of this.

299
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:57,239
I don't want any of this shit. I'm redoing this whole thing. You have to go off this way to get

300
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:15,349
in and out of bed. But people get to see you sleep. No, get a big curtain. New offer. Add

301
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:19,909
GermaSus as an emote to double your debt. I've been seeing this picture a lot recently and I don't

302
00:45:19,909 --> 00:45:24,230
get it. I don't understand. And you know what? I'm actually happy this picture is making the rounds

303
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:28,329
and you guys are memeing the absolute hell out of this picture. Can anybody tell me why?

304
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:39,400
Because this looks better than the original. So by all means, please, please spread this around.

305
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:45,159
Please make every meme possible. Make this the top search thing because that looks better than

306
00:45:45,159 --> 00:46:01,940
the actual original picture. It looks worse. No, it doesn't. What have you done? New emote. No,

307
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:10,809
a new emote. That would be so terrifying. Maybe like a BTTV emote. Any that- here's the problem.

308
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:17,849
Any emote that's added that's a real sub-emote, you can use anywhere on this website. So I know

309
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:25,269
you guys will spam that in channels and you'll give- you'll give us a bad reputation. Like,

310
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:31,210
oh, here's like this GermaSus emote fucking smile like scary community again. Well,

311
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:37,690
can't wait to like pretend to like like these guys until they leave. You think people do that?

312
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:46,090
I don't think so. I think we've got a good community here. But like if you spam the Germa

313
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:52,699
fucking scary SCP emote enough times, maybe they won't think that way. I want a painting right

314
00:46:52,699 --> 00:47:17,460
here. A big one. Painting. What's something futuristic looking? It's like every single-

315
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:28,579
hold on. I want to put another picture here that's a face. You know, or like a bod- like a head lying

316
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:49,019
this way. TOS? What do you mean TOS? This is clearly a dog bone. It's a dog bone and it's

317
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:57,400
somebody just holding onto it. What are you talking about? I like that so far. I need something here.

318
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:09,349
How about um, something nuclear? I said it wrong, whatever. Scream in my face. What about HGTV?

319
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:26,710
Oh, nuclear. Yeah, the walls have to change too. All right, installations. All right, hold on.

320
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:39,000
Are you sure- are you sure you want to come over this guy's house? Would you sit in this seat?

321
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:59,820
You tell me. You're gonna sit in that chair? Why would you have that though? I have my electric

322
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:11,960
chair. That's a hot seat. What the fuck is this link? All right, what is it? Okay, we're getting

323
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:22,389
some weird links today. What the fuck? What? Oh, ah, this makes me uncomfortable to look at. I don't

324
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:28,780
even want to put this on stream. This is like- this is weird. It's like morphing. I don't want to put

325
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:56,219
this on stream. This is terrifying. Why is it- what is it- what's morphing? Ah, ah, ah! Jesus Christ.

326
00:49:56,219 --> 00:50:04,280
Yeah, I know. Why do you guys make this stuff? I'm supposed to be the weird guy. I'm the- I'm the

327
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:12,389
weird guy, right? All right, well, yes, I did make like a pretend electric execution chair in

328
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:17,929
my apartment. Yes, but I didn't finish. I was gonna put like a nice picture of a bird up here.

329
00:50:17,929 --> 00:50:44,519
Okay, see? That is what would happen. It would use all the power in the building. The building

330
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:59,980
would turn off. Why would I have like a death chair? All right, what happened to all the lights?

331
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:11,900
Vending machine outside? It's for your enemies. It's for me to convince people to come over and

332
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:22,230
sit in a chair. Why would you- why would you want- okay, if you had an enemy, how would you

333
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:27,860
convince them to come over your house? And I know we like fucking hate each other. We- I- and we're

334
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:32,679
dastardly villains to each other, but come over to my apartment and come up here. Come up the

335
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:50,039
stairs and come sit in this chair and don't move like a little bit and just hang out on your phone.

336
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:56,340
Okay, I need more furniture. This sucks. I want- you know what? You know what I've always wanted

337
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:06,019
and you guys can think I'm crazy for this, but am I? I've always wanted to be lying in bed and

338
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:27,619
have a sort of a lower ceiling and have a big TV up here. Is that weird? Fuck, I can't do it.

339
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:45,079
Damn it. I can't do it? Why? Why? Let me live my fantasies. Uh, TV. I mount this TV? No, I can't.

340
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:51,190
Damn it. I really have always wanted that. I feel like that'd be so convenient.

341
00:52:52,860 --> 00:53:02,170
But it would- what if it fell and- and crushed you? You'd just lie in here. You'd lie in here

342
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:05,449
just like this, watching like a nature documentary.

343
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:20,780
There's monkeys are funny. And the thing just- that would be so horrible. Yeah, that's kind of

344
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:27,289
scary. We'd need to be bold to do a stud. There are no studs in the ceiling. I don't- how would

345
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:38,579
you get it up there? What if you- you're doing something else? You're lying in bed looking up.

346
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:50,920
There's your use- and it comes crashing down on you?

347
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:17,269
The police find you? What the hell happened here? Why is he lying on his back? And he's- see,

348
00:54:17,269 --> 00:54:25,860
uh, I don't know. How did this- how did this happen? I cannot see- we need to get like

349
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:32,230
three of the top FBI detectives to come out here because I have no fucking idea how this dude died

350
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:46,019
here. Okay, I can't put the TV on the ceiling so whatever. I'm gonna put- uh, get rid of this.

351
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:55,590
I don't want this. I don't want this. I don't want this. I don't want that. All right, what else do

352
00:54:55,590 --> 00:55:07,980
we have? Doors and windows. Just put these everywhere. Just be that person that has the

353
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:23,000
uncomfortable amount of like kind of lewd artwork all over their house. Everywhere. In the dinner

354
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,119
table- it's in the dining room. It's- it's the dinner table. The dinner table is that. Kind of

355
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:36,199
just paint it onto the wood. Now, I need a cool couch and this TV sucks. I'm sorry. Wait,

356
00:55:36,199 --> 00:56:08,150
that had an arm on it! Oh! Microwave cyberwave crane monitor. Oh boy. Shit. Okay, well, I could

357
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:17,429
do this and tilt it down, right? Like, technically, I could lie down like this and like tilt it down

358
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:30,730
upside down. No, you would install it upside down so then when you- you would arrange it away so

359
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:35,590
when it's face down it was the right way. You know what I mean? So you'd have to arrange it away

360
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:43,699
where you would lie like this and it goes face down that it would be the right side up. So hold on.

361
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:57,429
This has to change. Okay, so then now- yeah, there. See? Now the arm bends down like this.

362
00:56:57,989 --> 00:57:22,150
It's a guillotine television. You better pray this arm is strong as hell. Yeah. Extend it down.

363
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:31,849
That works. Ban Discord users. Ban Discord users. Why would I do that?

364
00:57:32,409 --> 00:57:36,440
All right, here's the- they already gave me the cool mouse and keyboard and desk. They already

365
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:41,980
furnished it. I want- get this out of here. I don't like this down here in the living space.

366
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:53,110
I want this up here. This is a cooler up here, I think. Yeah, like right there. That's cooler.

367
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:08,780
Let's move a couple of these. I don't need this one. Get rid of it. This is wrong. Who needs more

368
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:26,699
than six shelves? Let's be real. Make it flush. Nice. All right, cool. Reddit shelves. Hey,

369
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:37,800
Reddit shelf is cool. Down with Discord Dave. I don't know who that is. I like this. I mean,

370
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:47,780
this computer is cool, but it could be better. Oh, shit. Let me see. I got subs coming in.

371
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:54,460
We had five subs from Lime and then 25 from Freddy Dread. What's going on, Freddy? Thanks for the

372
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:59,369
huge amount of subs. I want to make this clear again. I want to make this clear. We have maybe

373
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:04,090
some people that- I have to change- I didn't change the fucking rules. I'm so stupid. I no longer read

374
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:14,280
bits anymore. In fact, I probably am going to make the bit minimum to give to the channel like

375
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:30,280
something that's impossible. Should I do that? One, five million? No, people will do it. That scares

376
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:37,349
me though. You're right. If I make the bit minimum, like $5,000, somebody's gonna do it, aren't they?

377
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:51,619
What happened with the bits? Well, to give a long story, a shorter TLDR here. I want- I kind of want

378
00:59:51,619 --> 00:59:56,579
to get rid of the bits to be read on stream kind of thing because I got rid of the bit reading at

379
00:59:56,579 --> 01:00:01,099
the end of the streams and you don't know if you're new to the channel. I used to read all

380
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:08,420
bit donations over 250 on stream at the end of a stream and what I ended up doing is because I had

381
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:12,659
a lot of medical problems and I used to sit here for about four or five hours and then it'd be about

382
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:17,590
an hour or two of a wind down where we did the end of the stream. So I decided that because it was

383
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:20,949
better if I could just sit here and stream and then be able just to get up whenever so I didn't

384
01:00:20,949 --> 01:00:25,929
have to potentially put an extra couple hours to the stream. I could stream for a little bit longer

385
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:31,269
until I was like, okay, I gotta get up. But what happened was I still was doing like- people were

386
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:37,030
giving $50 and $100 bit drops which is huge and insane and I can't even imagine giving that amount

387
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:43,300
of money to anybody. But I was still reading those because they were so large that I almost felt like

388
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:50,869
that's so much money. I kind of have to respond to that, right? So now I'm no longer going to be

389
01:00:50,869 --> 01:00:58,469
doing that because I didn't want to put a precedence in place where pay $100 for the streamer to

390
01:00:58,469 --> 01:01:03,210
actually read it and because I feel like that's unfair and I don't want people to think they have

391
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:13,849
to do that. So like I said before, if you want- if you want to support this channel, which people do

392
01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:19,369
and I- every day I wake up in the morning and I go this is- this is- this is a stupid amount of

393
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:25,670
support and money. I can't even believe it. It's- it's uncountable in my brain. Just sub. And you

394
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:31,269
don't have to give hundreds of dollars on a stream. I would much rather you take care of yourself

395
01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:37,190
or support some other potentially smaller streamers that are out there. That would- I would- I would

396
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:48,940
make- that would make me feel better about that. I think that would be better. So bit readings are

397
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:55,750
gone permanently and they are never coming back. But I still call out sub gifts because the theory

398
01:01:55,750 --> 01:02:01,239
behind that was it was something that people were getting and it wasn't just- I mean obviously it's

399
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:05,880
me getting money from those subs but people are getting them and they can use the subs and it's

400
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:17,369
I think it's a little different. Greed. No one gives the slightest of fucks resident sleeper. Well,

401
01:02:17,369 --> 01:02:23,030
I mean if you gave $50 today and I didn't read it you're probably going like oh what's the- he

402
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:30,139
didn't- what the fuck is going on here? What do you mean true? I'm getting trued right now?

403
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:36,139
I gotta be clear. I gotta be clear. I want to make sure I'm clear on this. And look, just relax and

404
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:57,989
pull on. True, true, true. Don't- don't true me. I need a couch. Ooh, I like this but I want it to be

405
01:02:57,989 --> 01:03:08,199
blue. Like super blue. And yeah and now- yes I said the word sub and here comes a shitload of subs.

406
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:17,400
Okay I'm- I'm never gonna say money on the- of course I am. Why blue? Because like teal is my

407
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:24,500
favorite color. You guys know that. Teal aqua light kind of greenish green aqua blue. It's beautiful.

408
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:45,670
All right let's make this interesting. In here? Okay if I put it- where'd I put the TV? I don't

409
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:54,150
even need a TV. I got a TV up there. This is a fridge. All right fridge is going over here.

410
01:03:54,150 --> 01:04:05,940
Why not? Fridge is going over here. Because then you can just roll the chair back and just open it

411
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:23,000
up and grab whatever you want. Shit. All right this is cool but it's too big. It's gonna be really

412
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:34,230
loud next to your ears. Will it though? Okay I- that's not- this is not bad. How would you even

413
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:47,829
get up there to turn these on and off? Did I ever tell you guys that I didn't have heat

414
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:58,840
or air conditioning in my old place in Massachusetts? In- in where- no wait hold on.

415
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:05,480
Let me- let me fix that. Where I- the place when I was streaming there wasn't AC into that room.

416
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:12,139
There wasn't heat into that room. So every day I'd have to like- how did I survive in there?

417
01:05:12,139 --> 01:05:19,619
With body heat because I get so hot it didn't even matter. During the winter I would just

418
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:26,219
generate- I'm my own heater. The computer in the hot room it would just make the room like 70

419
01:05:26,219 --> 01:05:38,710
degrees every time. Okay I want a- I need like a lamp or something. Dude I can't even break

420
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:48,329
anything in this one. Yeah I can. Uh well dude- oh let's make it like modern. Let's make it like

421
01:05:48,329 --> 01:06:07,300
postmodern. Watch this. There we go. Nice. Just have like you know bricks and like broken bricks

422
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:19,050
and shit that people come and go oh wow cool postmodern. I can't even break this wall. Open

423
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:38,789
up the bathroom. No I just- I want a postmodern bathroom entrance. That's it. I break this. What

424
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:50,329
can I even do in this room? This room is so boring. What do you put in here? Oh this- what am I doing?

425
01:06:50,969 --> 01:07:06,440
Am I stupid? This is the TV room. This is the entertainment room. This is too big though.

426
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:15,420
Wait is it? No it's not. It's perfect. Nice okay and then like the TV can be right here.

427
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:37,590
That's awful. All right what's too big? So I'm gonna put this back. You have a flat. So I'm

428
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:43,500
utilizing the space. That can stay there. What goes in the middle? Like a dining table. Is there

429
01:07:43,500 --> 01:08:10,699
a cyberpunk dining table? Holy shit there's pinball. No no there's nowhere to put this.

430
01:08:10,699 --> 01:08:22,420
I guess I could put it over here. That's kind of cool. Oh the fridge is too-

431
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:30,699
please listen to lego rock raiders 2 soundtrack while you play. It's quiet.

432
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:39,399
No it's gonna DMCA the stream. I hate this thing. Seriously I don't- all the gaming chairs I think

433
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:45,159
they're so ugly. I'm sorry. I think- I really believe that. They're just huge and bulky and

434
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:50,149
I just don't- I don't like them. I really don't. Some of them are okay. There's actually a couple

435
01:08:50,149 --> 01:08:58,220
that look all right. I just- no they're too- they're huge. Huge huge huge huge huge. Remember when

436
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:12,739
you're gonna post your fire watch photos? I already did. Hmm well I don't like it. I don't- I just-

437
01:09:12,739 --> 01:09:19,880
I'm not into it. I like more stuff like this. You know some of that like post-modern kind of style.

438
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:30,470
But it needs to be more comfortable. I thought- okay I thought this was a cauldron. Like a

439
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:41,989
witch's cauldron. This is a seat? Why is this seat squished? All right yeah yeah yeah come on.

440
01:09:51,100 --> 01:10:14,539
Shit. I have to assemble this? That's a pain in the ass. Real stream setup. Cool all right and

441
01:10:14,539 --> 01:10:22,119
it can swing too. Can I use it? I want to sit on it. Oh but it's too impractical. Wait I can't

442
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:48,659
even move this. I can't move it. Shit. It's a sex swing. Put it up here. Okay I don't know what

443
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:55,529
happened. I've- I talked about this a month or so ago or a few weeks ago. This stream has become

444
01:10:56,170 --> 01:11:03,050
just- I never used to talk like this before. Never never never ever. Think back like a year

445
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:07,050
or two ago. Never would you hear these words coming out my- I would never say the word

446
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:14,500
sex swing on my stream a year ago. I'd be like holy shit I'm not saying that out loud. What the

447
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:31,829
fuck? I think you guys may have like infiltrated my brain but I'm putting it up here. Wait I don't

448
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:36,710
know about this though. Sir like you've got like the electric chair like the z- the zex swing.

449
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:53,819
The- how do you explain all this? Oh it's for- it's for decoration. Oh you have this like

450
01:11:53,819 --> 01:11:57,819
electric- a chair that you set and you turn it on and electrocutes you. Yes it's for decoration.

451
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:06,520
What's the swing up here for? Like this like sex swing? It's for decoration. What are all these-

452
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:13,270
you have you have like a modded arcade cabinet with like 10,000 porn games on it. Yes it's for

453
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:19,449
decoration. Oh okay. The tv that bends down while you lie on your back in bed is that for decoration?

454
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:29,220
Uh yes. But it functions and you watch tv on it. Yes. So it's not a decoration. It's- it has a

455
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:43,100
practical use. No. Yes. Well um it's been fun. Maybe I'll- maybe I'll call you later. 700,000

456
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:51,460
Zorn games. This is the kind of place that like if you like if mom comes over she can't touch

457
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:58,489
anything. This is why you can't have any of that shit man. Oh I have like porn here porn stuff porn

458
01:12:58,489 --> 01:13:03,369
thing porn sex this sex that. It's like oh mom's coming over. Well mom you can't touch anything.

459
01:13:03,369 --> 01:13:09,510
You have to literally sit in the waiting room and here's- I'll put a bed here. Like there's- you

460
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:19,539
can't have all this stuff. What is it a porn fridge? Not everything has to be porn fridge,

461
01:13:19,539 --> 01:13:29,159
porn swing, porn cabinet, porn bed. I like this spot so I'm putting a shelf here.

462
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:48,659
Porn stairs. What do you mean porn stairs? I just want to see.

463
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:07,689
Mom you- mom you can never come over my house. And this is an apartment too. This is a smaller-

464
01:14:07,689 --> 01:14:12,810
this is kind of a small apartment. You have like the living area and everyone can see everything.

465
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:25,670
You can't- no one can ever come over your house. You can't have like a porn swing. Small in the

466
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:31,670
sense that like everything is visible from everywhere in the entire- besides a bathroom.

467
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:38,890
You can't have a porn swing just in your bed area up here in a loft in an apartment like this.

468
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:46,090
He's a millionaire streamer. Okay so hold on. I'm the millionaire streamer but you guys are

469
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:53,619
talking about wanting to install a porn sex swing up in your loft. How much do you think a like

470
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:59,590
professionally installed porn swing costs? It can't be less- it's probably more than a thousand

471
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:06,390
dollars. Way more probably. It's probably- yeah it's probably like three to five K. Why do I know?

472
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:14,149
I don't know. I'm asking chat. You guys are the- you guys are the Zorn Masters. It's six thousand

473
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:19,670
dollars for that. Okay but I'm the millionaire streamer. You guys are the other six K porn

474
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:23,909
swing streamers. Well you know what? I said streamer. You get the idea.

475
01:15:29,189 --> 01:15:36,939
A porn swing streamer. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I gotta

476
01:15:36,939 --> 01:15:40,460
move on. I gotta move on. No I'm not putting- I'm not gonna do the porn swing. I'm not doing it.

477
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:53,619
It's too much. My mother's probably watching. Okay what do we got for a table? Something cool.

478
01:15:53,619 --> 01:16:04,039
Something modern. Something contemporary. How about- oh just a boring wood table. I love wood.

479
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:24,260
Wood is so easy. You need to put a fuck table in. You don't even eat food. Why is this one dirty?

480
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:42,970
Oh it's not. There's like a design on it. I'm corrupted. I've been corrupted. Total

481
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:58,439
corruption. Total corruption. Total power. No not- I don't need a changing table. I don't even know

482
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:13,340
what to put in here. This place is done. I don't know what else to do here. All right I'm just

483
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:25,189
gonna pick this one here. Whatever. Whatever. Who cares? That's so big. It really is. Do the arcade

484
01:17:25,189 --> 01:17:30,630
house. Yeah but if I do the arcade house it's over and it's just gonna be arcade cabinets everywhere

485
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:42,090
and then my like porn room loft 2.0. I already did the porn room last time. Kitchen? I don't have a

486
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:56,409
kitchen. Chat has collectively lost their mind. Okay you know how they say that the streamer

487
01:17:56,409 --> 01:18:03,640
influences the chat and your chat is sort of an extension of you and your personality in a way?

488
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:18,409
It's the opposite here. Absolutely. I have been consumed by Twitch chat. Where's the bathroom?

489
01:18:18,409 --> 01:18:32,489
Right here? I'll add a little kitchenette. There's a bathroom right here. Okay this sucks. I don't

490
01:18:32,489 --> 01:18:37,899
get rid of that. This is fine. I can just like I don't know I can run around in a circle here

491
01:18:37,899 --> 01:18:48,380
really easily. That's good. Nancy's looking in there right now. Greg come here. Come here. Come here.

492
01:18:48,539 --> 01:18:53,380
Greg come here. The dude in that loft that we can see is like fucking running in circles right now.

493
01:18:54,310 --> 01:19:01,350
What? No he's not. Look. Look dude. Look. Look. Holy shit. What the fuck is he doing? I don't know.

494
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:04,550
He does weird shit in there all the time. He's putting up like a swing too earlier.

495
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:12,550
The call of somebody? What are we gonna call? What's our jurisdiction? I don't know. I just

496
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:18,579
feel like maybe we should. No. No. No. No. We're like two miles away Nancy. Just stop looking.

497
01:19:18,579 --> 01:19:24,949
Just stop looking in that window. He's going up the stairs. Stop looking. I don't want to even

498
01:19:24,949 --> 01:19:30,149
know about it. Don't tell me about it. He just turned his tv on. He's lying down I think. Why

499
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:35,220
does he not have curtains? This is so fucked up. He didn't have curtain. No he doesn't. He's weird.

500
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:43,989
He's putting the tv down. Okay. All right. Okay. I'm not looking anymore. What? What? What? What?

501
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:47,029
Let me see. Let me see. No. No. Don't look. Don't look. It's fucked. No. Wait. No. No. No.

502
01:19:47,029 --> 01:19:53,670
Don't look. Let me see what he's doing over there. Oh Jesus. Why does he? I told you to stop looking

503
01:19:53,670 --> 01:20:00,470
through this guy's window. I can't. What do you want to do? I'm sorry. You do this shit. I'm not

504
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:07,659
doing this. We're moving. Look. We don't have to move. We don't have to move. Yes we do. The

505
01:20:07,659 --> 01:20:12,779
temptation to look at this guy doing crazy shit is off the charts. We're moving two floors down so

506
01:20:12,779 --> 01:20:26,680
we don't have to see him anymore. He's inflating his cheeks on the window. He knows we're watching.

507
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:46,279
He's doing the thing that the kids do. I don't know what else to do. What else do I do here?

508
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:57,960
Oh lamps. We need. Oh bro. How about relax. Chill. Can I spell another word out? Chill.

509
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:10,729
Hold on. How big can I make this? He's actually. He's not even putting up curtains. He's installing

510
01:21:10,729 --> 01:21:27,479
a shitload. Oh hold on. Where's my build tool? I don't know what he's doing. He's building. He's

511
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:41,079
building a wall. This would be. Have they made a movie like this before? I think they have. Right?

512
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:46,220
Haven't they? Well like the guy across the apartment is doing crazy shit

513
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:54,739
and it's like they keep looking through the window and seeing him. What is he doing? Oh my god.

514
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:07,420
Nancy. Oh my god. I don't know what he's doing. I think he knows we're watching. Nancy. Nancy.

515
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:13,109
Nancy. I think he's looking over here. He installed a thing on a wall and it says relax.

516
01:22:13,109 --> 01:22:23,529
Why do we need to relax? Is he talking about us? He must be looking. Why would he build that?

517
01:22:23,529 --> 01:22:43,850
Nancy. Nancy. Nancy. Nancy. We gotta move. Oh that was a weird sleep. I didn't get much sleep.

518
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:55,020
That was terrifying. Nancy. Wake up. What's going on out the window? What are you talking about?

519
01:22:55,020 --> 01:23:00,569
What do you mean? He's standing there still. He's still standing there looking out the window.

520
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:04,890
No he's not. No it's impossible. He was doing that last night. He hasn't moved.

521
01:23:05,449 --> 01:23:13,739
What do you mean he hasn't moved? Nancy he hasn't moved in the full like seven or eight hours.

522
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:24,600
He's just looking right over at our window. Jesus. Wait he's moving. Nancy. What's he doing?

523
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:29,159
Nancy. I think he's leaving his apartment. Nancy. Nancy. Nancy. I don't know what to do.

524
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:48,869
How annoying is this really though? This is a mix of rear window and cape of fear.

525
01:23:52,890 --> 01:24:24,409
Bar. Chill. Relax. Okay that was fun. I had fun in the DLC. How do I get over there though?

526
01:24:24,409 --> 01:24:49,449
Can I? Hold on. Is there like a- you gonna play more tear down? Uh probably not. No I'm

527
01:24:49,449 --> 01:24:57,930
leaving. I'm leaving this. I'm leaving. See? No I'm moving to a different house. I want to

528
01:24:57,930 --> 01:25:01,050
do a different house. That was fun little DLC but I'm moving to a different house.

529
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:18,699
And just- no what? Uh none of this shit. Look at how- look at how nice this looks. None of this

530
01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:32,949
is mine. This is a downloaded save file. Actually you know what? Owned. How many- aww. I thought

531
01:25:32,949 --> 01:25:40,869
we'd be able to see his uh his progress. Just married house. What is- I don't remember this one.

532
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:50,170
Yeah we did the moon already. I don't think I have enough money for this. I remember I did the moon

533
01:25:50,170 --> 01:26:05,930
base. I did the man cave. Which one have I not done? Variable woman's house. What does that mean?

534
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:38,439
What is a variable woman's house? It's code? What do you mean it's code? What the hell is this house?

535
01:26:39,079 --> 01:26:59,020
Wait what? This house is very strange. Did I do this one? I think I already did this one. Why is

536
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:15,260
there a sliding door here? Wait this house is already done. It's just dirty. I did do- no no no

537
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:23,859
this is a save file. This looks like a dark RP- yeah we made the FPS house already. What about

538
01:27:23,859 --> 01:27:41,130
outside? Hold on. Let's flip it harder. Okay well wall mom time. I- I- I- okay I'm not going to look

539
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:47,539
at the mini map. I have no idea where I am. I don't know where I am. This is a bathroom here and then

540
01:27:47,539 --> 01:27:58,149
there's- this is a- what? Okay this is bathroom- I don't know where I am in the house. Hold on. Okay so

541
01:27:58,149 --> 01:28:05,510
you have the entrance then you have a hallway leading to a hallway leading to a bathroom and

542
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:24,039
an outdoor. This wall has to come down. Just gut it. Let's just make a game show house where you have to

543
01:28:24,039 --> 01:28:34,920
pick a certain door and there's like traps behind one of them. Just make a giant game show stage.

544
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:56,390
We're gonna have like a sign too. Like a sound stage. Make a saw house? I mean what do you mean

545
01:28:56,390 --> 01:29:07,609
it's a- wait every room has a new- a different trap in it? Let me clean up the bugs first.

546
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:24,890
You know what the worst part about this? Oh you all know. You all know what I'm about to do and I

547
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:28,090
know it's gonna make people really really uncomfortable. Here we go. You know that it's

548
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:53,500
not gonna be that simple. It's gonna be this. Stop stop stop no. All right I will. That was awful.

549
01:29:53,500 --> 01:30:02,359
Can't I have this cool thing in the saw house? I don't even know who the fuck I am. All right I

550
01:30:02,359 --> 01:30:12,729
have to destroy everything. I was making a sandwich what did I miss? Bug noises and like bugs suck up

551
01:30:12,729 --> 01:30:17,560
kill with vacuum noises. So I'm glad you weren't here. Unless you're eating a bug sandwich

552
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:46,920
then you probably wouldn't care. Bug snacks that's right. It's bug snacks. Kind of bug and kind of

553
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:59,319
snack. Kind of bug and kind of snack. Kind of bug and kind of snack. It's a bug snack. Oh somebody

554
01:30:59,319 --> 01:31:28,220
checked did the vod- did the friends theme song get claimed? Oh yes. No it didn't. Keep roaches for

555
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:36,390
the saw trap room. Oh shit. Oh my god why am I cleaning for? Yeah I gotta move trash and stuff.

556
01:31:37,029 --> 01:31:49,000
Oh shit what am I doing? I gotta keep trash and put it in different rooms. Oh shit. Any more bug

557
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:56,199
clusters? Yep okay good. This would be like this would be like the you get eaten alive by bugs room.

558
01:32:04,409 --> 01:32:08,010
The best part about this is the fact that you can't remove windows in this game.

559
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:12,949
So hell make your choice here in a room with bugs you're gonna eat your eyes until you get the key.

560
01:32:12,949 --> 01:32:24,970
This is like in a suburban neighborhood. Board it up. I need to clean this though I love that sound.

561
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:45,880
Saw's in here right now getting ready. Hey you clean up the windows. Looks good. Very very good.

562
01:32:45,880 --> 01:33:01,300
Excellent. This is what he does. All right there's there's a room right here.

563
01:33:01,939 --> 01:33:05,779
So it's gonna be we'll need a wall. But first of all let me get the actual- let me do- I gotta

564
01:33:05,779 --> 01:33:13,579
destroy everything. He thinks his name is Saw. No I know his name is not Saw. I know his- it's

565
01:33:13,579 --> 01:33:21,000
Billy the Puppet. Jigsaw is the name of the killer. Billy the Puppet is the name of the Puppet.

566
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:48,500
God damn it he's too smart. Yeah I think I really am. I really do. I took the do you know your saw

567
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:55,260
lore quiz and I got a 60. I mean you could watch those movies a hundred times in a row and you

568
01:33:55,260 --> 01:34:01,539
still wouldn't know what's going on. Oh definitely gotta make like this weird trap with like a saw

569
01:34:01,539 --> 01:34:05,300
like a blade comes out of there and like hits somebody the head right. Oh this is like the gas.

570
01:34:05,939 --> 01:34:23,300
Okay hold on keep that. How about just a tub? No no I'm gonna leave that. And there's bugs in here

571
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:36,409
too. Good. Okay how about like you have to fold a certain amount of t-shirts. You don't fold

572
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:44,140
ten t-shirts correctly like they do at Old Navy. Two minutes the room will fill with gas.

573
01:34:44,140 --> 01:35:04,100
All right that's- I like that. That's it. Saw. This this saw like sucks. Living with Saw.

574
01:35:34,090 --> 01:35:55,239
Living with Saw. Kylo Ren. No not every low voice is Kylo Ren. Not every low kind of mumbly voice is-

575
01:35:55,239 --> 01:36:04,359
You know what? Why don't one of you make an edit where you just- listen listen to me. Make an edit

576
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:10,569
with Saw talking instead of Kylo Ren in different scenes. You could probably find plenty of clips

577
01:36:10,569 --> 01:36:15,739
that would make sense and do the vice versa. Do it the other way. You could probably replace

578
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:22,630
Saw talking with a bunch of scenes in Star Wars and it would probably go seamlessly together.

579
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:28,569
The other way it could be true too. Oh look at this. This is one of those like

580
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:33,609
best part about the Saw movies is when like they go they open the door. They open the door like this

581
01:36:34,409 --> 01:36:40,409
and they see kind of whatever it is and it goes it zooms in like all sepia and fucked up and it

582
01:36:40,409 --> 01:36:51,979
like shows all the like the wires. Yeah I like this already. And then it zooms in on their face

583
01:36:51,979 --> 01:37:08,300
and they go like and like they the head ghosts a little while they shake it around. Yeah they

584
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:50,489
don't used to do. A mirror. You need to beat yourself in a staring contest. I like it. Yeah

585
01:37:50,489 --> 01:37:56,489
yeah yeah unwinnable unwinnable. Oh yeah? Well somebody just said it. You break the glass with

586
01:37:56,489 --> 01:38:12,359
your fist. You have to break the glass and take the mirror out. That's winnable. All right so we

587
01:38:12,359 --> 01:38:19,909
have look at the mirror or the you'll get killed. We have the waiting room and obviously how do these

588
01:38:19,909 --> 01:38:29,260
people they have to be put somewhere while the stuff is being made. He comes in it's like a

589
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:35,260
doctor's office. Okay it's time for uh Mike. Mike come with me. Yeah oh yeah how you doing? Yeah

590
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:40,069
we're gonna be on this one on the left. Yeah sunny day yeah it's very sunny. Yep go ahead and sit in

591
01:38:40,069 --> 01:38:51,000
there. Uh yeah don't mind the bugs. And these be waiting room. Cry cry cry. It's an escape room.

592
01:38:51,000 --> 01:39:01,720
I don't know what that what's the what's the trap gonna be in here? Saw waiting room. I gotta hold

593
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:08,340
on. When are you gonna do a tax stream? What is with everybody wanting to see like people's like

621
01:44:18,659 --> 01:44:35,720

622
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:46,140
entrance this is the house this has to be like red blood red or like just black right and then

flawlessly too so here is how we will get a bunch of artwork how awesome is this how good is this

634
01:46:48,970 --> 01:48:46,949
isn't it insane I'll be right back enjoy the art oh shoes there's a there's a lot of shoe

635
01:48:46,949 --> 01:49:04,300
artwork backlog is that another shoe I love it it showed porn no it did not uh lazy luke is the one

636
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:10,409
that's programming all this it's so good too you know what I mean like can we give a huge

637
01:49:10,409 --> 01:49:26,329
huge shout out to lazy luke for doing all this it's so good it's amazing because there's so

638
01:49:26,329 --> 01:49:33,739
much artwork and some you guys like you guys are so talented so many of you guys can make such

639
01:49:33,739 --> 01:49:42,439
crazy shit I I wanted to find a way to at least showcase it if I could I disappeared for like

640
01:49:42,439 --> 01:49:47,720
three months it was a huge backlog huge creative uh community content night that just it could not

641
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:52,470
happen videos for community content night I'm gonna have to figure out a solution for two because

642
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:59,029
I don't think I can do those on twitch anymore but I wanted to have something and this is the

643
01:49:59,029 --> 01:50:11,350
something and it is awesome too many of you do too many awesome things to not show why not well

644
01:50:12,229 --> 01:50:20,840
uh the DMCA uncertainty has kind of thrown a wrench into that so this is either gonna have

645
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:42,420
to be a lot tighter rules on what can be shown or why is this a family tree it's art breeder

646
01:50:47,529 --> 01:50:51,529
don't make them clippable or vaudeville but if I stream them they still exist and they can still

647
01:50:51,529 --> 01:51:06,329
be pulled right I have a couple of solutions in mind when I'm ready to talk about those I will

648
01:51:06,329 --> 01:51:10,329
all right I I'm back but I just I wanted to let this play out a little bit just so we could see

649
01:51:10,329 --> 01:51:22,949
how cool it was and the best part is this is constantly updated so it should pick up kind

650
01:51:22,949 --> 01:51:35,479
of where I leave off which is awesome I never ate ass from the start the truth is that's true

651
01:51:36,039 --> 01:51:44,039
wait did I just oh shit I just give a definitive answer the two three year long question oh shit

652
01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:58,090
all right let's go let's go let me I want to test them I want to see if I want to see if I

653
01:51:58,090 --> 01:52:03,260
screw something up I might have messed something up let me see if I got it right I might have

654
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:14,619
screwed it up oh would you look at that it works perfectly it works absolutely fucking flawlessly

655
01:52:15,609 --> 01:52:28,170
it picks up exactly where the last image left off look at that wonderful wonderful wonderful

656
01:52:28,170 --> 01:52:55,050
okay uh it's I'm so happy about that it looks great it looks so good it's so dark so the idea

657
01:52:55,050 --> 01:53:01,560
there are hundreds of images that are in the backlog the idea is over time you can enjoy them

658
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:09,529
during a BRB segment right because I don't run ads so if I don't run ads when I go BRB then show

659
01:53:09,529 --> 01:53:18,310
those and that's much more interesting right all right here we go we need a big lamp too not these

660
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:28,680
I'm gonna leave these for now just because I need light in the house I just got a hearthstone ad

661
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:34,119

668
01:54:51,560 --> 01:55:16,380
just because of like the hero the best I just like their units I like their the infantry units

669
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:23,529
they're awesome you know it's the worst part about the tau they put the tau in a game they made that

670
01:55:23,529 --> 01:55:30,329
warhammer 40k the real-time strategy game right added a couple of expansions to it and then they

671
01:55:30,329 --> 01:55:35,220
they never put them in anything else ever again I would have played dawn of war 2 if the tau were

672
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:46,470
an actual playable faction and then they made dawn of war 3 and nobody played it so they like

673
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:53,159
canned it right stop cleaning fuck you're right sorry sorry sorry sorry I can add dirt don't

695
02:00:48,630 --> 02:01:18,949
uh I need one of these I wrote it so many times no this is just this is like propane

696
02:01:19,590 --> 02:01:29,270
that's not even the gas that we're talking about this is just actually gas for your grill if you

697
02:01:29,270 --> 02:01:43,350
don't cook that steak perfectly on the gas I'm not I'm not gonna do any more gas references anymore

698
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:51,560
no more no more no more no more no more no more no more no more no more no more no more

699
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:58,739
no more you know the best part about this whole little routine here I don't think I've even said

700
02:01:58,739 --> 02:02:03,560
it as amount the amount of times that they actually say it in the saw movies if you count

701
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:10,680
the amount of times the word gas has been said this stream I bet you they said it more times

702
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:25,579
over the course of that series why is it so hard to bet okay this bet is weird because somebody's

703
02:02:25,579 --> 02:02:31,340
gonna have to watch all 18 saw movies back to back and put a time stamp if every time they say the

704
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:41,260
word gas who the hell who's none of nobody wants to do that it's like 30 hours of time

705
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:55,640
just control f the script I will I'll do it no no that's too much but what if the what if

706
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:59,399
there's ad libbing of the word gas what if it's not the whole thing you gotta what if it's ad libbed

707
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:05,960
there's definitely a few ad libbing times with the they walk in the room they go

708
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:15,109
buff smells like gas in here and that wasn't in the script all right okay okay all right but

709
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:20,859
who I don't want you all to do this because if you all do it and that means a bunch of you are

710
02:03:20,859 --> 02:03:30,069
like spending 30 hours doing this we have to designate one person to do this I'm willing

711
02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:41,579
to put up I'm willing to put up okay no no no two um all right I'm put this is two this is 250

712
02:03:41,579 --> 02:03:48,810
million dollars if I'm wrong add it to the debt if I'm right pull it and I get to I get that

713
02:03:48,810 --> 02:04:09,100
250 mil oh is that deal is that deal all right who do we who does this who who who's going to

714
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:19,159
be doing this I already did it you did maybe in the discord like you got maybe some of you guys

715
02:04:19,159 --> 02:04:38,409
like corroborate on like one doing it gas doesn't appear once in the original movie's script what

716
02:04:38,409 --> 02:04:44,180
okay home this is the this is the first part of the script welcome I trust that you are all

717
02:04:44,180 --> 02:05:13,539
unfortunately since you arrived that counts as gas it counts nerve agent counts as gas

718
02:05:16,199 --> 02:05:23,300
that counts we you gotta give me a little feel yes it does yes it does breathe okay if you if

719
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:35,140
he says the word breathing in if the words breathe in a certain fume that is a gas like fume nerve

720
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:41,659
gas come on he probably says that like 30 times throughout that movie you have to give me that

721
02:05:41,659 --> 02:05:57,939
one it counts it does count it totally is a gas chat yeah come on no that counts the word breathing

722
02:05:57,939 --> 02:06:07,590
comes up eight times and isn't it's a gas yes it is why would you say the words breathing

723
02:06:08,949 --> 02:06:23,989
what is he saying what is he referring to what you're breathing in russia are you kidding me

724
02:06:23,989 --> 02:06:28,550
no every time he says the words breathing in that counts i'm sorry that i'm gonna pull the deal

725
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:39,380
that's not true what else would you be breathing in in the saw movie franchise it's not a car

726
02:06:39,380 --> 02:06:48,859
air freshener oh that counts that counts breathing in fume breathing in gas breathing in nerve agent

727
02:06:48,859 --> 02:06:58,649
those are all considered gaseous gastric like objects they're not breathing they're dead right

728
02:06:58,649 --> 02:07:08,729
okay what what that you can take that one off but if it's a reference to inhaling a fume that will

729
02:07:08,729 --> 02:07:22,039
hurt you that is a reference it is a reference and you cannot tell me it isn't if whatever you're

730
02:07:22,039 --> 02:07:31,340
breathing in hurts it's gas you're gonna lose immediately come what wasn't part of the deal

731
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:41,109
no it's part of the deal you've said the word gas yeah but like we have to adjust the deal was

732
02:07:41,109 --> 02:08:31,239
about the word no come on sorry sorry nerve agent agent playing semantics with this one you know

733
02:08:31,239 --> 02:08:50,659
exactly what i'm talking about tinny pike saw house nerve agent is not gas yes it is it's a

734
02:08:50,659 --> 02:08:55,699
that's exactly what i was talking about if he says the word nerve agent 20 times in that movie

735
02:08:55,699 --> 02:09:17,979
and you don't give it to me i'm gonna be very upset with that you said it more than 20 times

736
02:09:17,979 --> 02:09:43,939
yeah i said over the course of the entire franchise i didn't say install one saw filter play the game

737
02:09:43,939 --> 02:10:00,840
and with the soft filter no no that's gonna ruin it it's on oh shit

738
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:10,500
it's oh fuck oh i thought you're talking about turn it i thought you're saying turn it on for

739
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:19,449

740
02:10:19,449 --> 02:10:28,279

741
02:10:28,279 --> 02:10:35,260

773
02:18:22,489 --> 02:18:33,739
different lights somehow i think red dead redemption 2 is high up on that list i don't know how

different couches do i have a nickelodeon snick couch we've got an epic link in chat do we right

775
02:19:09,610 --> 02:19:20,489
but no this is not fair this isn't fair number of times a character says the word gas in all the

776
02:19:20,489 --> 02:19:28,680
saw movies saw one zero saw two four they don't say it again till saw seven and they say three

777
02:19:28,680 --> 02:19:40,069
times but what about the other stuff like nerve agent or fumes or toxic fume it's got to be like

778
02:19:40,069 --> 02:19:51,590
20 times no no that come on that doesn't count you need to verify your sources yeah like this

779
02:19:51,590 --> 02:20:02,260
is an english project somebody just did do it again but then run it through to see how many

780
02:20:02,260 --> 02:20:11,579
times the word nerve agent nerve fumes uh fumes poison toxic there's a poison crossing through

781
02:20:11,579 --> 02:20:31,670
your nose right i come on do it somebody do it gashes yeah they only use gas in saw two

782
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:37,739
no they don't they use gas and like the whole franchise he's always picked making people smell

783
02:20:37,739 --> 02:20:57,209
gas they either smell gas or they have to get a key out of their stomach this is a dog coach oh
