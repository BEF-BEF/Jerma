1
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:31,320
Oh, hi, didn't see you there. Yeah, I did actually. How you doing? I'm doing okay. Where should I sit here?

2
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:37,179
Or sit here like this? So you can get like a full-on like face reaction to my fucking d-

3
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:43,060
Oh, look at all the cool stuff and game rewards. How- what- what's- why is there no uh stream?

4
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:53,140
I don't understand. Oh, they usually have like a big like 25 advertisements before every one of these?

5
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,579
I missed it?

6
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,600
What do you mean I missed it?

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,250
No, it says live December 10th. I didn't miss it. Hold on. I gotta tweet this.

8
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,370
I missed the stream.

9
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:14,280
That would be embarrassing.

10
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,090
It was yesterday.

11
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,310
Got a bunch of- got a bunch of community injured here. But what is today?

12
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,700
What is actually today?

13
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:37,129
Actually refresh though. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Why is this so- this doesn't make any sense. Why does it look like this?

14
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:42,819
Oh, okay. There we go.

15
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,459
Okay. So hold on. I don't have to follow the- refresh the page.

16
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:58,620
Is it going? It's not even going. What's this?

17
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,439
Jeff Q&A.

18
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,439
Riot Games. Chat Choice Awards.

19
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,540
Game Awards. No, where's the actual live stream?

20
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:14,550
Why didn't you shave? I don't know.

21
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,669
Click that one. Can I stream that one? What's the rules here?

22
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,460
What are the actual rules?

23
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,620
This- um, this is why I only want to get here 15 minutes early. My pre-show- you think I have anything for my pre-show?

24
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,740
No, I played like three games that have been nominated this year and one of them I played for like an hour.

25
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:42,789
I- you don't want to be here for this- for me. I have a terrible sense of what is cool this year.

26
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,270
I took like three months off.

27
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:50,789
I played like 12 video games. Spit just flew out of my mouth. That's how you can tell I'm really rabid tonight.

28
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,669
Is it- what can I watch? Sing the pre-show song.

29
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,409
Hot Chocke? Oh, man, it's hot. No, it's not. Oh, look at my gross mouth spots.

30
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:16,139
Oh! Can you see this?

31
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,189
How am I drinking this coffee?

32
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,509
Am I going like-

33
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:29,110
Look at this like a bunch of like mouth like spots and like water.

34
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:39,080
There's like a lipstick on here.

35
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,560
I think there's actually lipstick on this cup.

36
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:54,620
Can you see the like lipstick mark?

37
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,650
Ew, ew, ew. Evil lighting too?

38
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:18,199
I didn't show any nudes on stream. All right, everybody relax. What time is it? 324? When does this thing start?

39
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,810
Okay, so

40
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,129
Let's think- let's think about you're handsome.

41
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,459
Not anymore!

42
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,540
Yeah, but on- I don't know. What's my good side?

43
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,740
Let's find this out. I don't know who gives a shit about the game awards.

44
00:04:50,740 --> 00:05:00,279
Let's talk about my- me and how like got my appearance. What's my good side, you guys think? I don't. Okay, so this is me.

45
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:11,240
What's like the good side?

46
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,670
Both? What's worse?

47
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:17,029
I think this side's probably the bad side. If I would take a- if it would be me in the mirror.

48
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,839
All right, I gotta talk about like video games. This is getting weird.

49
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,560
This is like I'm like a weird guy that's like obsessed with himself.

50
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,720
You know, one of my good sides over here, but I don't know about this one. I think this looks okay this way too.

51
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,959
Like it's the fucking game awards tonight. You know, what did I play this year? I'm gonna do a pre-show.

52
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,089
What did I play this year? I came out this year.

53
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:50,790
Put your head on the statue. This is- I don't know, this feels weird. I played Doodle God. Hades, yes.

54
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,110
All right, if I want Hades to win something, I really do.

55
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:58,730
Hades came out this year.

56
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,199
Um, Bug Snacks? What else did I play?

57
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,259
Watch Dogs? Watch Dogs is not gonna get nominated for anything.

58
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,420
And if it does, like if Watch Dogs is on there for game of the year, I don't even look, I don't even care.

59
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,310
Half-Life Alex, but that didn't come out this year, did it?

60
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:21,750
Did Half-Life Alex come out in 2020? Half-Life Alex came out in 2020?

61
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:26,149
Oh shit. All right. Why is that- that was probably the game of the year.

62
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,579
Is that not on game of the year?

63
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:35,670
I would say that would be game of the year for me. It's not even on the list.

64
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,029
Why the fuck would that not be on the list?

65
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,680
How is that?

66
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,120
It's a snub.

67
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Well, because nobody has VR.

68
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,000
It's because like only like 2% of people have VR. That's kind of weird.

69
00:06:51,480 --> 00:07:01,139
But it's like it's probably the best game that I played this year.

70
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,180
So why wouldn't it, you know, are we judging it based on the merits of how good a game was or judging it based on

71
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,939
how many like Twitter followers the social media account has?

72
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:14,019
Like how many Twitter followers does like the fucking Ubisoft Watch Dogs account have?

73
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:20,259
How many active Reddit users are inside? Yeah.

74
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,040
I mean how many active Reddit users are current- are like voting?

75
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,290
But that doesn't make any sense because Val- Half-Life Alex is like a huge Reddit game. What are you talking about?

76
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,649
Everybody loves that game.

77
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:40,540
If that's the barometer, it's not right then. It's not- it's not accurate. It's a popularity contest germo.

78
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:49,560
The Valve is wicked popular up the stream. What time is it? 328. What else we got?

79
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,639
All right, so Half-Life Alex is probably my game of the year.

80
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,319
I would say.

81
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,319
Well, let me get like a couple more clanks in there so you can like really tell I'm sitting down having a coffee with you.

82
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,819
I think um, no, that's ASMR shit. I'm not gonna do that. I'll leave that be.

83
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:10,279
Hades was good too. I'd say Hades. No villain hair. No, I did. I put- which is my hair recently has been really like wavy.

84
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,040
I tried.

85
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,720
I put a bunch of water in it and like I've really like tried to like get it to go back, but it's too short.

86
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:28,470
So it won't stay back. It just won't- it won't stay back. It's gonna be like this.

87
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,870
Wait, it hasn't even started. The game awards haven't even started yet. I got time.

88
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:36,379
I just go throw water in my hair and get ready.

89
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,059
I gotta get ready for the game awards, man. I gotta like slick my hair back.

90
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:49,779
Do it on camera? I don't have a sink in here. Where do you see a sink?

91
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,019
Dunk your head in water and come back here like-

92
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,620
All right, I'm ready. I'm gonna look like sweaty. Why am I sweaty? No.

93
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:02,100
That's just the light. I got a little light in here now so you can like illuminate my face for you.

94
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,139
You're in the bathroom right now.

95
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:17,379
You're always like this. I know. Look, I'm a pretty sweaty guy, okay? Look. You got like sweaty lips.

96
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,019
I've got- I've got like sweaty teeth.

97
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,500
See? There's like sweat coming off my teeth.

98
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,029
Lip gloss. It's fucking chapstick. Sit down.

99
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,809
Relax.

100
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:38,889
You got Gary Busey teeth.

101
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:49,509
Hey, they're big and they can chew through food very quickly.

102
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:56,220
Oh, you know, you're at the burger place. Oh, man. I really can't like bite into this burger. It's like it's too big.

103
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,299
It's too much. I go like-

104
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,460
And when I bite into this shit,

105
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,179
meat and cheese goes out the sides and like splats on the walls and stuff and everyone's like looks over they go

106
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:12,740
Holy shit, that dude- that dude's teeth must be on point. They look over and I go yeah, they are.

107
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:16,169
You ever need me to bite through metal?

108
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:23,340
I'll do it. Excuse me, sir. Sir, I noticed that you bit into that hamburger really well.

109
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Could you- could you break this copper for me?

110
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:41,080
That'll be $40. Fucking show gonna start already. Is it live?

111
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,039
Hold on. Wait. I didn't even put my head in the water.

112
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:51,210
It did. It's live. It's live. It's live. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it actually live or are you lying to me?

113
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:01,139
Offline.

114
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:08,220
Liars. Liars. All of you. Press the refresh on the page. Hold on. I do have to- I already did.

115
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,529
You missed the show.

116
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:30,200
Okay, I'm refreshing the whole page. Oh, it's Pepe Laugh. Pepe Laugh. Pepe Laugh. We got him. Pepe Laugh. Pepe Laugh.

117
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,440
I'm laughing at this guy because he thinks he had to refresh the bucket page. I got it. I understand.

118
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,639
But now I have to do this again.

119
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,970
You have really slow internet.

120
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,279
It's 3 32 right now.

121
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,870
Should be on.

122
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,580
No? Oh, wait.

123
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:56,860
Oh.

124
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,190
Ladies and gentlemen.

125
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,750
Oh, it's an ad. Wait, it's an ad. Okay. It's an ad.

126
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,860
Okay. All right. All right. By the way, 5G. That's never gonna roll out everywhere.

127
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,100
You'll be able to do 5G in like five places. That's why it's called 5G.

128
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,659
It's gonna be in like five major cities in like a 200 yard radius.

129
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,100
The following program may contain content that some viewers might find offensive.

130
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
Can you hear it? Are we good? Are we live?

131
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:40,659
Good men here coming to you live from Los Angeles, California. From Las Vegas.

132
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:47,860
Damn it. Damn it. And please allow me to be the first to thank you for setting down cyberpunk for a few hours.

133
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:52,419
As you can probably tell the game awards are going to look a little different this year.

134
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:57,460
Our venue may be smaller, but the show itself is as gigantic as ever.

135
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,580
The awards and world premieres won't be changing except

136
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,220
I guess the only people clapping will be me and probably a few crew members. Oh, right.

137
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:13,139
We'll bring us musical performances from London and Tokyo and one positive of tonight's mostly digital gathering is

138
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:19,059
we'll get to see more faces in the talented teams behind this year's outstanding games. What the hell is going on here?

139
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:26,580
As for us here in the pre-show, we'll be setting the remaining minutes before the game awards kick off with brand new trailers,

140
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:33,700
mercifully brief integrated marketing, and Lin will be performing a song from Persona 5 Strikers.

141
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,820
Oh, you guys be excited about that one. The big reason we're all here.

142
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:42,860
Awards. Our first category tonight is best score in music. It's just going right into it.

143
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:48,299
It's a particularly strong contest this year with five standout nominees that could on their own

144
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,980
represent the best of the generation. What's good music? Here are the nominees for best score in music. Best score in music. Doom Eternal.

145
00:13:56,299 --> 00:14:00,460
Nice, Doom. Play Doom OST. Final Fantasy 7 Remake. No, I don't know. Hades. Yeah.

146
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:07,419
Ori and the Will of the Wisps. I didn't play it, but sure. And the Last of Us Part 2. Didn't play it. I don't know. And the winner is?

147
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,980
It's gonna be Doom Eternal or Hades. It's gonna be Hades.

148
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:16,460
Final Fantasy 7 Remake. We already know those songs. We already heard them 20 years ago.

149
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,720
All right. The music's good. It's good. It's good.

150
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:40,519
All right. Now the music's good, but we already heard those songs.

151
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,720
As I said earlier, you'll be seeing a variety of different world premieres throughout this pre-show.

152
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh, give us some world premieres. Strangely enough, we've decided to show you our most important one first. Here it is.

153
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:54,409
What?

154
00:14:54,409 --> 00:15:00,649
Oh, the digits go. Elden Ring. Come on. Welcome to the Devolver Digital 2021 Game of the Year Award.

Okay, shush it. So yeah, tonight we are here to celebrate this year's most memorable video games.

159
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,110

160
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:28,309
but for next year's as yet to be released games coming at you hot from what many believe to be this industry's most ridiculously

161
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:34,950
overrated publisher. While most of these games are months away from release, we at Devolver Digital are strong

162
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:42,629
proponents of awards for awards sake. And with that, the nominees for the Devolver Digital 2021

Kind of wish the baby like burped cute through the camera.

00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,039
Well, just now, really. Let's have a look at Lupiro.

171
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,440
Your world has been cast into a dark spiral.

172
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,320
Place enchanted cards along a heroiney path.

173
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
What am I supposed to say?

174
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,019
Just build cathedrals and remember your world.

175
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:47,580
Scrounges for weapons, armor, and mystical items to level up your hero.

176
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:54,379
Expand your camp, customize your card deck, and uncover secrets.

177
00:16:55,419 --> 00:17:00,460
Feast the lich, break the spiral, and see the world.

178
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Lupiro, coming in 2021.

179
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,559
Hey, here's every single one of these streams you're gonna watch on Twitch.

180
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,799
Thank you. See you next year.

181
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:18,329
Whatever

182
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:26,250
Every year the Game Awards do our best to highlight new games from all sorts of developers from AAA big shots like Devolver

183
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,569
to smaller independent studios.

184
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:36,569
Our next world premiere is the debut of a new game from Awaseb, a young studio started in New Caledonia. Enjoy.

185
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:41,049
Here we go. Another world premiere. Let's go back to back world premieres. Back to back jacks.

186
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,970
Back to back jacks.

187
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:56,180
Crap.

188
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,859
Oh shit.

189
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:41,450
You can fall from really high places. What the hell?

190
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,170
You can be a coconut.

191
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,740
Oh, that's all right. Let's go to coal. How do you get out though?

192
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,220
This next award category is for one of gaming's most popular genres, action adventure.

193
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:33,660
The breadth of what is considered an action adventure game also leads to this regularly being one of our most competitive categories.

194
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,940
Incidentally for the past three years the game award winner for action adventure has gone on to win game of the year.

195
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,180
This is a big one.

196
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,220
Here are the nominees for best action adventure game.

197
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000

200
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:04,359
I didn't play any of these. And the last of us part two. Holy shit. I haven't played a single one of these the entire year.

201
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,690
What kind of comments are you gonna get from me? The last of us part two.

202
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Wow, we won. This is awesome.

203
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,799
We want to thank the game awards for choosing us as the best action adventure game. Oh the best of known beforehand.

204
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,480
On behalf of the directors, which is myself, Anthony Newman and Neil Druckmann.

205
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,759
They definitely knew before it. We want to thank the entire team at Naughty Dog who poured their heart and souls into this game.

206
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:31,680
It's really their talent. Oh, they probably all did one. It merges you in that world and really makes you feel like you're on this journey with Ellie.

207
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,039
We want to thank Evan Wells our president.

208
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,720
Also everyone at Sony and our partners for really helping us put this game together and get out the door.

209
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,319
And especially to our fans who

210
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
supported us and

211
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,680
really helped make this game something special. You guys make it worth it. So thank you again.

212
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,599
So you have to assume that every single one of these people has to do a we won.

213
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,759
Oh, I won. We have many more awards coming up in the pre-show.

214
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,519
But first, so you can understand like oh we won. Yeah, but you don't know you won.

215
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,839
But you're like pretending you won in case you do.

216
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:14,180
Interesting. Hello everyone. I'm Connie. I'm the CEO and creative director of my games company called Yo Mai in beautiful Berlin.

217
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:21,140
It was such an honor to be nominated for the games

218
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:27,859
for impact category at last year's The Game Awards. It's held due to the Golden Globes. Our most important project today

219
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,779
called

220
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:30,900
Sea of Solitude.

221
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:37,460
I'm very happy to announce that Sea of Solitude will be coming to Nintendo Switch this winter.

222
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,779
But it's not just a port.

223
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:47,059
We fully reworked the entire game. We're calling it The Director's Cup because it's a version that truly

224
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,660
represents what I wanted to convey about the topics that are especially

225
00:21:53,279 --> 00:22:00,099
important in today's difficult times. We can't wait to share it with you until then. What game is this?

226
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:06,099
Enjoy The Game Awards. The Game Awards aren't even on yet. See you soon. The 17 minutes till The Game Awards start. What?

227
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:17,160
This is the pre-show.

228
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:27,410
You missed it. No, I didn't this is I'm way too early monsters. You know them too, don't you?

229
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,990
What the fuck? They're waiting for us to capsize.

230
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:40,339
To drown.

231
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,339
We'll face them.

232
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,829
DMCA?

233
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:51,329
Oh shit. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, who cares?

234
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,410
We should just safe harbor together.

235
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,089
I ain't mutant.

236
00:22:55,089 --> 00:23:01,890
You want to shut me down? Like fuck you. I'm not mutant. You told me I could frame this everybody on earth that was here doing this.

237
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:14,599
No, I ain't mutant shit. All right.

238
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,339
You're gonna get banned. I'm not gonna get banned. They said we could do this.

239
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:27,559
I ain't mutant shit.

240
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,180
Telling you. What do you want me to do?

241
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:34,819
What do you want me to do?

242
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,819
The algorithm doesn't care.

243
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,819
Let me show you how I fucking deal with algorithms.

244
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,980
Let me show you how I fucking deal with the algorithm.

245
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:46,819
We've had some great world premieres already, but we recognize there may be some fans of elegant Shadowgaze puzzle games who feel left out.

246
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,140
Oh, let me show you how I deal with algorithms. It's called select all delete button.

247
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,180
We've got something for you too.

248
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,180
Oh, then what are you gonna do? Come at me?

249
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,859
Here is shady part of me.

250
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:58,660
You're just a little bit of code motherfucker. You're just a little bit of code.

251
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:10,200
There once was a girl who was trapped in the dark with naught but her shadow for company. A journey to escape

252
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:12,119
She did embark

253
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,519
And her shadow followed distrustfully

254
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,559
Girl found no hope in life

00:45:54,139 --> 00:45:57,900
Whose their house their house just fell over because they fell over so far hard in their chair

00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:05,239
like their house fell backwards and landed on site because they fucking flew to the back of their room and went

490
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,440

491
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,440

when people used to make

495
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,119
Fake bullshit never gonna happen smash things

2006

501
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:59,949
The people that made those smash character lists that were like i'm telling you guys no, this is gonna happen

502
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,150
That's like the guys that bought btc when it was like fucking four dollars

00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,949
And everyone's like dude, what are you talking about? You're crazy

Just wait to see no way man. You're out of your mind

505
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,820
All right, i'm gonna do it I don't care if you flip it

506
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,820
The fun is just getting started but of course this show is also about

507
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,920
Indicated activists

508
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:21,840
I am honored to present the award for best performance

509
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,960
Among the nominees is an inclusive group of talented actors filling vastly different roles in games that are nothing alike

510
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,320
however

511
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,880
These artists are nominated. I could do any song by the way clear dedication to their craft

512
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:41,760
And an extraordinary ability to bring humanity and empathy to their roles here are the nominees for best performance

513
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:45,260
Oh, so all right. All right. All right. Okay

Stupid boy, you shall never reach the surface. Yeah. Yep

516
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,800
Okay

517
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,730

518
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:16,730
and the game award goes to

519
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,559
Laura bailey as abby the last of us weren't

520
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,440
Oh, wow, um

521
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,440
wow, uh, I

522
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:36,059
I was such a fan of the original

523
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:43,070
Last of us and of troy and ashley's performances within it. Um, I fell in love with joe linelli

524
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,530
so it is

525
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,530
No surprise to me that

526
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:51,050
abby's role within this story has been met with such

527
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,380
Uh passionate responses

528
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,630
but um

529
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:02,909
To have been able to play but she's incredibly talented like she just did such a fantastically challenging character

530
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,269
Who through her story enables the player to find?

531
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:11,400
Forgiveness and empathy is something that i'll be eternally grateful for

532
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,949
um

533
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:16,670
Oh, man, I told the team on the day that I finished filming

534
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:20,590
that what I wanted more than anything was for my performance to

535
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:27,500
To give a performance that honored the impact that the original game had on me, so

536

Everything you did the the story and abby would not have been as impactful without you by my side

541
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,800
Um that was a that was a I that would hear that ding that wasn't me that was on the screen that was like

00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,760
game's journey has been

551
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,429

552
00:51:42,429 --> 00:51:44,239

566
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:58,039
Pretty much since the day I started there has been a really clear turn it on

567
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:04,599
I can't I think the thing that that makes it different from a lot of first-person games is it's not just about shooting

568
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:10,199
Eco sci-fi is a term that we use future fiction, but from an ecological focus

569
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:16,920
There's been this ecological disaster these corporations came in and they developed new technology and on the surface everything's

570
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:22,599
Everything's pretty great. We're still early in development, but we're really excited with where things are going

571
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:27,000
We wanted to share a cinematic piece that helps set the tone for our world

572
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,199
What is it iberpunk

573
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,630

I just I turned I turned my fucking big screen tv on and you guys all pulled into the driveway

576
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:03,289
And you're just looking through the screen. I have a microphone that has speakers outside the windows

577
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:06,489
Like i'm about to do twitch integration and whatever you're just in my driveway

578
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,829
The corporations gave us solutions

579
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,719
Yeah, yeah, you want drop?

580
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,480
I like lift up the window and i'm like, hey here comes a drop

581
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,800

582
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:28,159
Boom

583

There's no ink in there by the way, you're gonna have to get that yourself what they're hiding your fly

584
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,309
The flight of the fly

585
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:15,150
So i'm gonna stop talking i'm like probably pissing people off find the answers you were looking for

586
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:21,840
Agent dark is the beginning

587
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,119

00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:16,320
Oh

596
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:27,239
roll rock, okay

597
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:35,739
This is left for dead three

598
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,079
Yeah

599
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:43,420
But not left for dead

600
00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:05,869
Well, I hope it's good

601
00:57:06,429 --> 00:57:23,199
Yeah, so they made uh

602
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:26,639
Yeah, so this is the spiritual left for dead successor, right?

603
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:30,159
It actually is called something like that too. Isn't it like dead for

604
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,880
Us or something. It's called something like that

605
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:59,420
So they made evolve

606
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,619
Right and then evolve was like almost like a catastrophic failure

607
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,860
So they're like, you know what?

608
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,860
Valve is not releasing left for dead three

609
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,380
This is pretty exciting for all us left for dead fans

610
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:18,619
Of course, uh, you guys are known for all the amazing work left for dead and now you're let him go for it

611
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:24,380

612
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:29,739

Uh more missions more story

614
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,420
But we also wanted to have a bigger variety of zombies to fight, right?

615
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:41,820
But also we wanted to go bigger. So now we've got these 20 foot tall

I think you've prepared a little surprise for everyone watching, right?

619
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:01,179
The terminators in the game movies are cool, but uh gameplay is king, right?

620
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,139
So let's see some of that i'll can terminators in the game. Here we go

00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:33,480
I'm actually excited for this because like who's who doesn't want to do this again

624
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:35,480
Hey

625
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,980

01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,150
But you don't have friends anymore yo

629
01:00:34,909 --> 01:00:37,500
Excited what are you talking?

630
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,059
It's fake gameplay. Of course it is

631
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:47,519
It has to be non-stop special infected attacks. Otherwise, you're not going to buy it

632
01:00:47,840 --> 01:01:02,909
You have to be puckering your lips and your ass needs to be stuffed into the bottom of your chair

633
01:01:05,469 --> 01:01:08,750
This entire gameplay reveal you're not going to pre-order it. You're not going to buy it

634
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:24,489

01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:00,479
I felt quite invisible. It still feels like i'm the odd one out

793
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,479
I felt alone

794
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:08,319
I was often the only woman and the only latina woman in the room. I think about how hard it was for me

795
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,880
To get where I am today

796
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:17,340

We've just grown from a really small group

800
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:32,060
into thousands

801
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:40,220

804
01:18:49,579 --> 01:18:53,579
It's a really beautiful thing. I'm trying not to cry. I was this close

805
01:18:54,619 --> 01:18:59,850
Okay

806
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:01,529
Hey everyone, my name is anna donlin

807
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:07,850
I am the executive producer of valorant and I cannot believe that it has been only half a year since we launched this game

808
01:19:08,329 --> 01:19:11,130
Our valorant community has shown up in such a huge way

809
01:19:11,449 --> 01:19:16,810
Helping us take this tac shooter from an idea to a home for tens of millions of players around the world

810
01:19:17,289 --> 01:19:22,569
To celebrate this we've teamed up with the game awards to highlight one of the most vital pieces of our community

811
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:27,130
Honestly, the ones that got us started in the first place are valorant streamers

812
01:19:27,609 --> 01:19:32,890
Together we ran a fan vote. I'm not one of the best emerging valorant streamer from our global community list

813
01:19:33,289 --> 01:19:37,609
We'll announce the winner before the end of the show and then we'll all go raid their stream together

Hey wyoming

896
01:28:19,789 --> 01:28:22,640

Wyoming we've got stuff here. Come on down to a beautiful wyoming and they have some celebrity that may have spent a weekend there

Okay, here we go

904
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:58,489
Come on a little too much grass. I think

905
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,479
Those particle things like you have like a firework in your hand

906
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:15,840
I mean I can't think with a little bit more time in the oven. This looks like it could be really good

907
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:38,939
I think a lot of devs really want to show like look at how many particles look at how many pieces of grass we can put

908
01:30:38,939 --> 01:30:40,300
on the screen

909
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:43,899
But seriously at some point it really does look like you're you're like a fucking aquarium

910
01:30:44,699 --> 01:30:49,439
You know what I mean? Like look at it's like deep sea shit everywhere. It's like coral reefs and shit like it's it's like

01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:52,159

912
01:30:52,239 --> 01:31:10,720
I'm interested. I'm interested though. It looks like it could be pretty good. It looks

913
01:31:12,029 --> 01:31:14,670
I mean i'm into like the third person kind of sword

914
01:31:15,289 --> 01:31:17,590
gameplay, but you know

915
01:31:17,609 --> 01:31:19,289

916
01:31:19,289 --> 01:31:24,970
I mean, it's not coming out tomorrow. So they got a lot of time

917
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:32,319
Holy shit, okay. This looks this looks pretty cool. Okay, i'm gonna say it could be pretty good

918
01:31:33,119 --> 01:31:58,909
What the hell is going on?

919
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:05,100
Okay, I mean

920
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:11,369
That's a lot of effects

921
01:32:11,529 --> 01:32:16,090
So many effects going on. It's just it's just the finale of every firework show you've been to

922
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:18,810
And i'm talking about the grass does that too

923
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:24,729
He's walking through the glass the grass and there's like big exploding firework effects in the grass

924
01:32:32,199 --> 01:32:34,199

930
01:33:12,909 --> 01:33:19,229
Hey jeff, thanks for inviting me to the game awards as you know in christopher nolan's latest film tenet

931
01:33:19,229 --> 01:33:21,229
I played a character called the protagonist

932
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:25,960
Very literally named narrative and I thought that was cool name for a character

933
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:29,319
It reminded me a little bit of playing video you just like start saying spoilers for all the

934
01:33:29,539 --> 01:33:32,600
Protagonists helping to tell the story of the game with our choices

935
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:37,319
Great narratives and games are the perfect balance of that feeling of being in control

936
01:33:37,399 --> 01:33:43,500
But also being guided by brilliant storytellers and so these are the nominees for best narrative

937
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:49,399
Didn't a lot of people complain about tenet that like you can't hear what anybody's saying

938
01:34:00,539 --> 01:34:08,859
Again it's hades ghost of shishima last of his friend. It's the same five games a touching reunion. It's the same five games

939
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:17,720
Did anything else come out in 2020 the game award goes to

940
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:27,439
The last of us part two

941
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:36,319
First off, it's such an honor to be nominated with so many incredible games that came out this year

942
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,880

943
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:43,539
Of course, i've got to thank my co-writer and the director of the last of us part two neil druchman

944
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:47,600
Who was courageous enough to tell such a ballsy story?

945
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:50,960
Um, and a big shout out and thanks to pogchamp

946
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:56,800
Other writers josh share and ryan james and of course the entire naughty dog studio

947
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:02,319
This game is what it is because of the collaborative nature at that studio and their love of narrative

948
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:04,560
and of course

949
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:11,119

Lupo and tonight i'm honored to partner with gilette to introduce the game awards future class

977
01:37:55,119 --> 01:38:00,960
A group of future class dreamers and pioneers who represent the bright bold and inclusive future for video games

978
01:38:05,949 --> 01:38:08,109
Games have really changed my life to be honest with you

979
01:38:08,829 --> 01:38:09,869
My name is royce payne

980
01:38:09,869 --> 01:38:15,630
I'm a senior computer science major at mario's college and i'm currently playing on the mario's maroon tiger gaming team

981
01:38:16,189 --> 01:38:22,189
We see other big colleges are able to have these gaming teams and they're winning scholarships for us not to have it

982
01:38:22,189 --> 01:38:25,949
We were like this is a lack. We need to get rid of this lack

983
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:33,550
We're just a collection of hbcu's who have different passionate gamers who want to compete against one another

984
01:38:34,189 --> 01:38:36,350
We've played against some good competition so far

985
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:42,189
Just being able to really break into that space and open the door for others to come behind me. That's huge for me

986
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:48,399
That's cool shit

987
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:54,640
Oh, hi everyone. I hope you're enjoying the game awards. I'm alana pierce coming at you live from my mansion

988
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,800
I've had to find some unique ways to deal with

989
01:38:59,979 --> 01:39:03,600
2020 situation like maybe I go for a swim in my

990
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:07,680
Olympic sized, but that's not olympic the the olympic one is indoors

991
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:13,680
But I know that there are some people out there watching this that are depending on things like vaping to try to calm themselves down

992
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:14,880
however

993
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:22,159
the high levels of nicotine that you can be inhaling can actually worsen your anxiety and just kind of fight against the mental health battle that is

994
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:25,520
this year not that I would know because

995
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,079
I'm a vape. I've got but that doesn't mean i'm not trying I don't vape

996
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:33,680
What are you what are you talking about for those of you who are looking to quit vaping, which I hope we're talking about

997
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:40,239
I don't this quitting is a free text-based program with a free built-in support system. I don't think it was to 8 8 7 0 9

998
01:39:40,399 --> 01:39:43,890
What are you talking about?

999
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:45,409
I don't vape

1000
01:39:45,409 --> 01:39:48,739
I've never vaped in my life

1001
01:39:49,539 --> 01:39:51,539
Oh mario party 17

01:39:57,979 --> 01:40:04,220
You have to accept it. I don't I don't vape. I don't vape. I don't have a vapor pen. I don't like

1004
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:07,180

1005
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:10,539
No, you guys talking about like marijuana. Oh this guy this guy smokes

1006
01:40:11,739 --> 01:40:15,659

1007
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:21,250
Correct yourselves here mario music back. That was fun. All right back in 1997

1008
01:40:21,489 --> 01:40:26,210
I wrote a story about two game developers coming together to make an unreal franchise tonight

1009
01:40:26,449 --> 01:40:31,569
And it's legal again for this here in las vegas. So what the fuck are you gonna do about it right now?

1010
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,600

1109
01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:50,670
He didn't make it. He didn't make it. He didn't make it

1110
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:54,340
What the fuck

1111
01:53:54,340 --> 01:54:00,819
That was two things that weren't like mmm, you can't get us and then like the frienders or family member who just got just

1112
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:02,819

What?

1118
01:54:27,489 --> 01:54:29,649
I wasn't paying attention. I just saw vin diesel's face

1119
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:39,100
I thought they were together

1120
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:44,020
No, he just said old friend

1121
01:54:46,420 --> 01:54:48,420
I thought that was like one of vin diesel's friends

1122
01:55:00,750 --> 01:55:03,630
No, what the fuck are you talking about

1123
01:55:04,590 --> 01:55:05,869

1124
01:55:05,869 --> 01:55:10,029
Vin diesel is the character. I don't understand what we're watching here

1125
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:16,880
That was a fan fiction made like they made that two starring vin diesel and the team at studio

This major tom's at ground control

1167
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:20,420
I'm looking through the mirror

1168
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:27,359
And everyone can see us through the b.a

1169
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:34,159
The stars look very interesting today

1170
02:00:37,579 --> 02:00:40,079
This is

1171
02:00:40,079 --> 02:00:42,079
Look if I tear I guess i'll be fine

1172
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:50,350
There it is. I fixed it

1173
02:00:50,430 --> 02:00:53,229
Imagine you just had to what if I like had something in the algorithm

1174
02:00:53,869 --> 02:00:58,750
Where like people found out they did some digging and holy shit like the germa 985

1175
02:00:58,909 --> 02:01:03,390
Ieo if you put at the beginning of your video or at the end of your video it fucks up the thing

1176
02:01:05,069 --> 02:01:07,069
every single video would start like

1177
02:01:07,630 --> 02:01:08,829
Uh

1178
02:01:08,829 --> 02:01:19,250
Hi everybody. Welcome back to the channel. We're playing uh minecraft tonight. Oh shit. Hold on. I realized that

1179
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:26,130
All my life i'd been using video games as a way of nurturing my own well-being

1180
02:01:26,289 --> 02:01:30,609
And I wondered if other people could do that too. Hi, this is

1181
02:01:31,170 --> 02:01:37,729
And so I established checkpoint to bring mental health resources to the gaming community

1182
02:01:37,810 --> 02:01:44,850
What is mental health we use games as a medium to raise awareness and to reduce stigma

1183
02:01:45,250 --> 02:01:51,489
And to provide real tangible resources to people who are struggling that they can use in their everyday life

1184
02:01:52,289 --> 02:01:56,050
This is really good really cool above all else. I want people to know that

1185
02:01:56,609 --> 02:02:03,010
It's okay to be struggling at the moment. There are resources out there and it will help and it will get better

1186
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:07,180
Welcome to enoch

1187
02:02:09,819 --> 02:02:15,659
If you don't want to end up as worm food what worked for you in the old world won't work here

1188
02:02:17,739 --> 02:02:26,380
Running and hiding are simply not viable options here if you plan on surviving you need to shift your mind into a higher gear

1189
02:02:27,180 --> 02:02:29,920
So let me walk you through the mantras of survival

1190
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:33,569
Your attention, please

1191
02:02:33,569 --> 02:02:38,930
People can fly. Oh, I thought this was one of the things. Yeah, that's right. First of all, I want to let you know people can fly

1192
02:02:39,170 --> 02:02:42,130
Get on top of your roof right now. It's right. That's how you survive

1193
02:02:42,689 --> 02:02:44,689
Chuck yourself. I don't know why I thought that

1194
02:02:45,409 --> 02:02:47,489
Your powers are on tap. Don't do that

1195
02:02:53,170 --> 02:02:56,819
Don't keep them waiting three

1196
02:02:57,060 --> 02:03:00,899
You've got a kill to heal. There's no use licking your wounds

1197
02:03:01,539 --> 02:03:07,779
Want your health back get out there and take it violence breathes vitality finally

1198
02:03:08,659 --> 02:03:10,659
guiding philosophy to end

1199
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:14,180
You have to think aggressive shoot people in the head

1200
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:17,539
Take their fucking heads off with knives and axes

1201
02:03:19,109 --> 02:03:21,029
step four

1202
02:03:21,029 --> 02:03:25,989
Drown people's heads in water make sure they can't fucking breathe and then their last breath comes out when you watch it

1203
02:03:25,989 --> 02:03:35,560

1207
02:03:43,699 --> 02:03:46,579
Shoot in head with gun at point-blank range resumed in close-up

1208
02:03:49,329 --> 02:03:51,329
You got a kill to live and heal

1209
02:03:51,890 --> 02:04:11,600
Oh shit, this kind of looks good

1210
02:04:22,229 --> 02:04:25,109

1339
02:16:56,170 --> 02:16:58,170
Lights have to be everywhere

1340
02:16:58,559 --> 02:17:00,479

Lose again

1355
02:18:07,930 --> 02:18:13,420

one of wizards and

1410
02:23:37,389 --> 02:23:44,590

Yeah, do we you're not feeling it no, okay

1424
02:25:55,690 --> 02:25:57,690
Are you entitled to your own opinion?

1425
02:26:03,770 --> 02:26:05,129
Holy shit

1426
02:26:05,129 --> 02:26:07,129
That's that's not that far away either

1427
02:26:07,770 --> 02:26:14,120
That's the game of the show right there for me an absolutely crazy game joseph showed that to me last summer when I was in stock

1428
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:17,719
Home, I'm like we have to show this off. There's so much gameplay there. Thank you for that joseph

1429
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:18,440
All right

1430
02:26:18,440 --> 02:26:21,799
I'd like to welcome a longtime friend and supporter of the game awards

1431
02:26:21,879 --> 02:26:27,559

02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:44,170
Absolutely

1435
02:26:44,170 --> 02:26:49,870
You know, i'm proud to present the very first award for innovation in accessibility

1436
02:26:50,489 --> 02:26:53,469
During my time at nintendo. We had a mantra

1437
02:26:54,030 --> 02:26:55,790
gaming for the masses

1438
02:26:55,790 --> 02:27:00,590
And we pushed that agenda with we nintendo ds and now nintendo switch

1439
02:27:01,469 --> 02:27:05,389
But today approximately one billion people around the world

1440
02:27:06,010 --> 02:27:10,190
Experience some form of disability that makes gaming challenging for them

1441
02:27:11,069 --> 02:27:17,809
This award was created to highlight the efforts throughout the gaming industry to make software and hardware

1442
02:27:18,110 --> 02:27:24,030
That enables games to be played and enjoyed by the widest and most inclusive audience possible

1443
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:28,670
Because gaming is for everyone here are the nominees

1444
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:35,680
Emperor of earth seriously

1445
02:27:36,399 --> 02:27:37,920
He's awesome

1446
02:27:37,920 --> 02:28:05,239
I have to pee so bad and the award goes to

02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:11,129

02:28:21,370 --> 02:28:28,250
And from everyone at naughty dog, we would like to thank you so much for honoring us with this year's innovation and accessibility award

1451
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:33,879
Thank you as well to the game awards for choosing to add

1452
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:39,079
This category and to all the other developers who have designed and advocated for accessibility in our games

1453
02:28:39,639 --> 02:28:44,840
We hope that together we can continue the momentum to push our industry forward as developers

1454
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:51,879
We know how one small design decision can unlock the entire game for a player games are special for their ability

1455
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:58,680
To blur the line between player and character providing a means for personal engagement with narrative that is unrivaled

1456
02:28:59,239 --> 02:29:05,000
And other artistic mediums. It's up to us to ensure that everyone can experience that for themselves

1457
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:12,479
We'd like to thank our terrific group of accessibility consultants and we'd absolutely could not have done it without your your insight and your

1458
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:19,739

1461
02:29:32,190 --> 02:29:38,530
This was truly a team effort and every department had a part to play in removing barriers for players with disabilities

1462
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:41,840
Lastly, we'd like to thank you the players

1463
02:29:42,649 --> 02:29:49,290
Nothing makes us prouder than hearing stories from players who were able to experience the last of us part two without assistance

1464
02:29:50,090 --> 02:29:57,389
Using our accessibility features to remove barriers that would have otherwise excluded them from both of us. Thank you so much

1465
02:29:57,709 --> 02:30:01,069
Thank you

1466
02:30:01,069 --> 02:30:06,829

In between light and dark is so very thin

1476
02:32:06,110 --> 02:32:08,110
Let's cross it together

1477
02:32:08,350 --> 02:32:18,200
Fate comes knocking sooner or later

1478
02:32:19,079 --> 02:32:22,280
With this power we make our own face

1479
02:32:23,799 --> 02:32:53,879
What I missed what I missed. All right, i'm back

1480

I actually dumped the water

1481
02:32:57,559 --> 02:33:00,600
I found a water and I dropped it. I got all over the counter

1482
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:03,000
So I had to like I didn't have any there was no paper towels available

1483
02:33:03,159 --> 02:33:06,360
So I had to take the back of my hand and like scrape the water like into the sink

1484
02:33:07,479 --> 02:33:09,799
I missed elden ring. No, I don't fucking way. I don't do that

1485
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:12,600
It's only been like two to three minutes

1486
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:16,920
I did not miss elden ring. There's no way

1487
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:33,420

02:33:34,139 --> 02:33:36,139

02:33:44,090 --> 02:33:46,090

Is a heatsink on at this time?

1504
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:18,239
Why would there be a heatsink on a hard drive?

1505
02:35:18,959 --> 02:35:22,479
It seems kind of like why?

1506
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:35,659
Gets really hot is he dumb. Am I I don't have a heatsink on a hard drive

1507
02:35:36,459 --> 02:35:40,219
Am I stupid?

1508
02:35:40,219 --> 02:35:45,559
It says these do get hot if they're fast enough. Well, just but does it need to be that fast?

1509
02:35:45,559 --> 02:35:51,000
We've just heard from our friends at pokemon go that there is another surge of whooper appearing

Everybody's gonna get a whooper

02:36:02,840 --> 02:36:04,840
We're all gonna get whoopers. They're not gonna be rare

1514
02:36:05,479 --> 02:36:08,120
You should have not said anything about it and then said by the way

1515
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:12,200
If you were playing pokemon go during the stream like that whooper you got

1516
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:15,799
And prokey are also we're all gonna get fucking whoopers

1517
02:36:16,440 --> 02:36:22,280
Not worth it. There's also a lot of bonuses happening now and it's never been a better time to play pokemon go

In a way, okay

02:37:32,879 --> 02:37:34,479
Mobile game came up this year

1533
02:37:34,479 --> 02:37:41,360
Despite their platform as technology has closed the gap releasing on phones is no longer a limitation

1534
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:43,280
It's an asset

1535
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:49,920
It's never been more apparent than tonight where the nominees for best mobile game have found massive audiences

1536

02:38:06,889 --> 02:38:11,739

02:38:52,489 --> 02:38:57,290
Somebody just come out of the bathtub look around and like the outfit and be like, oh shit and like go back in the bathtub

This is new shit

1556
02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:01,840
Is this actually new shit or is this they just remade it for the switch?

1557
02:40:02,639 --> 02:40:10,079
I know monsters in a giant stampede

1558
02:40:10,700 --> 02:40:16,299
They attack the village in a frenzied rage new. Okay, hold on. He knows why this happens

1559
02:40:16,780 --> 02:40:19,899
But it came close to wiping out our village last time

1560
02:40:20,860 --> 02:40:36,680
It was announced a while ago. That's still cool though

1561
02:40:37,319 --> 02:40:53,709
I've been training for this moment for our entire lot to protect kamara village

1562
02:40:55,389 --> 02:41:01,479

One day on the set of the last of us part one

1571
02:41:36,989 --> 02:41:39,549
Neil our writer and director asked me and ashley

1572
02:41:40,190 --> 02:41:44,680
What we would have been if we weren't actors. I thought about it for a second and replied that

1573
02:41:45,399 --> 02:41:47,399
I always imagined I would have been a singer

1574
02:41:48,219 --> 02:41:50,139
ashley just shrugged and

1575
02:41:50,139 --> 02:41:53,579
In her charming and off-handed way said dare you be so charming

1576
02:41:54,540 --> 02:42:00,319
Right, how dare you be the most charming handsome man of us into ellie and joel space

1577
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:09,770
And music became major elements of their stories creating touching moments between them one of those moments now indelible in our memories

1578
02:42:10,969 --> 02:42:15,950
Incorporated neil's story as well. Are you making us all look bad not as a writer but as a father

1579
02:42:17,020 --> 02:42:20,459
It involved a song he would play and sing to his daughter every night

1580
02:42:21,530 --> 02:42:24,010
That song was pearl jams future days

1581
02:42:25,290 --> 02:42:30,090
One day neil asked if I was comfortable playing it in a scene. He was writing for the last of his part two

1582
02:42:31,129 --> 02:42:32,409
now I don't

1583
02:42:32,409 --> 02:42:33,610
Generally get nervous

1584
02:42:33,610 --> 02:42:41,129
But I understood what that song meant to neil and to the game and the truth is neil can play that song better than me

1585
02:42:41,370 --> 02:42:51,579
But nobody can play it better than the person that wrote it from seattle performing future days. Here's eddie vetter. This is okay

1586
02:42:55,129 --> 02:42:57,129
Hey, this is just like a song

1587
02:43:02,719 --> 02:43:18,170
And sometimes you succeed to make this man of me

1588
02:43:18,889 --> 02:43:21,930
Somebody just said is this the guy from the weird owl song?

1589
02:43:24,219 --> 02:43:26,399
I am way older than you

1590
02:43:27,440 --> 02:43:29,440
This are you serious?

1591
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:31,520
That's how you know him

1592
02:43:33,079 --> 02:43:35,479
No, dude, what the fuck?

1593
02:43:37,479 --> 02:43:39,840
Come on

1594
02:43:39,840 --> 02:43:41,840
All right, i'm just gonna quiet

1595
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:53,239
Earl jam is almost 40 years old. That's insane to think about

1596
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:08,840
I'm 18. Who is this guy?

1597
02:44:12,969 --> 02:44:16,889
Start asking for prime why because there's a lot of people here

1598
02:44:20,010 --> 02:44:22,590
No, don't stop to this channel, what are you nuts

1599
02:44:26,170 --> 02:44:28,170
Break 20k. Hey everybody

1600
02:44:29,129 --> 02:44:36,170
I don't even have notifications. Anyway, so I don't even know I can't even tell

1601
02:44:38,329 --> 02:44:46,200
I said it somebody got me to say

1602
02:44:46,780 --> 02:44:51,020
But i'm not saying anything. I'm not i'm not doing any notifications. Nothing

1603
02:44:52,219 --> 02:44:54,219
Thank you for the subs. I appreciate but I ain't saying anything

1604
02:44:55,100 --> 02:44:57,280
Not during the game award

1605
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:05,360
Start talking about crime

1606
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:14,079
Do people do that I feel like that's so obvious and so it's like stupid

1607
02:45:21,930 --> 02:45:28,139
Like i'm i'm not on the game awards

1608
02:45:29,659 --> 02:45:32,159
Guys i'm probably on a band list somewhere

1609
02:45:43,500 --> 02:45:47,079
You're a brand risk

1610
02:45:47,319 --> 02:45:49,319
I don't think i'm am I?

1611
02:45:49,639 --> 02:45:51,639
I don't think i'm a brand risk

1612
02:45:53,770 --> 02:45:55,129
Could I no

1613
02:45:55,129 --> 02:46:01,479
I mean I did show like me and chuckie cheese kissing on stream, right? But like that's

1614
02:46:02,200 --> 02:46:04,200
Whatever that a brand risk

1615
02:46:04,600 --> 02:46:14,459
With dump truck ass, whatever

1616
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:22,059
He's a powerful rat

1617
02:46:23,979 --> 02:46:28,059
All right, so that was the song future days and um

1618
02:46:28,780 --> 02:46:31,260
that that song you might recognize from

1619
02:46:31,979 --> 02:46:37,979
From the last of us and I really appreciate the way that was that was used

1620
02:46:39,180 --> 02:46:40,700
especially bringing

1621
02:46:40,700 --> 02:46:42,700
Joel and ellie together

1622
02:46:43,819 --> 02:46:45,819
connecting through music

1623
02:46:46,219 --> 02:46:48,940
And I and I thought maybe it was cool too that made you

1624
02:46:49,979 --> 02:46:52,540
want to perhaps pick up a guitar

1625
02:46:53,819 --> 02:46:56,620
Yourself and and write a song for your loved one

1626
02:46:57,579 --> 02:47:00,010
um, but uh

1627
02:47:00,250 --> 02:47:02,250

Tell a story. It's just getting better and better all the time and um, it's cool to be part of it. So

Evil west

1638
02:48:51,629 --> 02:48:55,950
That was the exact same font the exact same text just missing a couple evil dead

1639
02:48:56,829 --> 02:48:58,930
That's kind of odd

1640
02:48:58,930 --> 02:49:01,010
There you go evil west. All right on twitch

1641
02:49:01,010 --> 02:49:06,290
We asked you to predict the winners in content creator of the year and the twitch audience

1643
02:49:11,250 --> 02:49:16,770
So the award for content creator of the year is coming up next presented by artist boss logic

1644

We've also got announcements from among us and fortnight

1646
02:49:24,129 --> 02:49:29,250
But right now scarlet nexus is an upcoming action jrpg from bandai namco

1647
02:49:29,329 --> 02:49:34,450
Here's a look at the brand new let's check the hairline. We gotta check it every now and again. How's it doing?

1648
02:49:36,219 --> 02:49:37,899
It's okay

1649
02:49:37,899 --> 02:49:41,100
It's okay virtual brain link cable and now it's all right

1650
02:49:41,180 --> 02:49:45,260
It's it'll be all right for a little bit of 10 years more than I did in training be strong

1651
02:49:51,069 --> 02:50:05,469
Seems like you're okay

1652
02:50:05,469 --> 02:50:10,559
new recruit

1653
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:12,239
mysterious scum

1654
02:50:12,239 --> 02:50:21,340
About last year's theme was constant conflict

1655
02:50:22,459 --> 02:50:24,940
This year's theme is constant particle effects

1656
02:50:25,659 --> 02:50:43,200
The resisting I will obtain the red strings

1657
02:50:44,239 --> 02:50:50,159
Yeah, this has pushed the hardware to 98 CPU usage 100 percent of the time you play

1658
02:51:06,989 --> 02:51:09,729
Change the title

1659
02:51:09,729 --> 02:51:12,620
I didn't see elden ring yet

1660
02:51:12,620 --> 02:51:21,790
I didn't see it didn't happen. We're waiting for elden ring on the all-new xbox. I did not miss it

1661
02:51:21,870 --> 02:51:23,870
It's coming up soon. It's gonna be a huge deal

1662
02:51:24,030 --> 02:51:26,989
I am often depressed when I look at the status

1663
02:51:27,469 --> 02:51:32,370
Of where we are in terms of depression and anxiety and inattention

1664
02:51:32,829 --> 02:51:38,430
We owe it to all the people that are suffering to be really creative and to try things that when you first hear it

1665
02:51:38,590 --> 02:51:45,649
You missed it. I didn't miss it. It's coming medicine. It's gonna be a huge reveal. I am a neuroscientist and a neurologist

1666
02:51:46,510 --> 02:51:48,510
It started for me 12 years ago

1667
02:51:49,149 --> 02:51:51,469
I became really interested in this idea of creating

1668
02:51:52,250 --> 02:51:56,930
Experiences as a way of improving brain function and this relies on a principle called neuroplasticity

1669
02:51:57,629 --> 02:52:02,030
The fact that our brain reshapes itself and modifies itself in response to challenges

1670
02:52:02,590 --> 02:52:05,790
And so that's how it all started for me to create a video game

1671
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:10,590
That was carefully designed to challenge and reward the brain in a very specific way

1672
02:52:11,469 --> 02:52:13,629
And so it just happened a couple months ago

1673
02:52:13,629 --> 02:52:20,850
The fda cleared endeavor rx as a medical device to treat inattention in children that have adhd

1674
02:52:21,469 --> 02:52:26,829
This is the first time ever that the fda has cleared a video game for any medical condition

1675
02:52:27,149 --> 02:52:33,149
So what we're talking about right now is to have a video game prescribed just like we prescribe pills for conditions

1676
02:52:33,629 --> 02:52:36,030
And think about this as a new type of medicine

1677
02:52:41,149 --> 02:52:43,149
The world is a dangerous place

1678
02:52:43,149 --> 02:52:45,149
This

1679
02:52:45,309 --> 02:52:47,389
Only the best can keep it safe

1680
02:52:48,750 --> 02:52:50,750
Become a tier one operative

1681
02:52:52,110 --> 02:52:53,629

All right too long on the end too long way too long in the end way too long on the end

1693
02:53:42,100 --> 02:53:44,500
That was like uncomfortably long at the very end there

1694
02:53:45,540 --> 02:54:04,290
Come on, are you gonna donate your gamer poop?

1695
02:54:04,690 --> 02:54:15,219

1759
03:00:57,860 --> 03:01:02,260
Yeah, so I think uh, you know, we didn't want to stop right there. And so there's something else

1760
03:01:02,260 --> 03:01:05,540
I think we should uh, we should check out and um, oh he's already in the game

1761
03:01:07,120 --> 03:01:09,520
Well, hello, sir. It's an honor

1762
03:01:10,399 --> 03:01:12,819
Hey sarge, did you hear?

1763
03:01:12,819 --> 03:01:18,260
Huh? I guess you already got the news what news master chief is coming to fortnight for what now?

1764
03:01:18,579 --> 03:01:23,219
It's only one of the most popular video games in the world. Is this kind of a big deal obviously?

1765
03:01:23,620 --> 03:01:25,700
It's where we are right now

1766
03:01:26,659 --> 03:01:32,500
Huh? Wait a minute. If you had no idea that we're in fortnight, then why do you have a cardboard cut out of master chief?

1767
03:01:33,860 --> 03:01:35,860
perfectly regular reasons

1768
03:01:36,659 --> 03:01:39,299
Whoa, you guys knew around here? No

1769
03:01:40,340 --> 03:01:45,940
The chief got eliminated by a sneaky blue. That's no blue. That's that's ninja

1770
03:01:46,500 --> 03:01:51,620
It's such an honor. I'm a huge fan of yours on twitch twitch. Is he twitching because he's blue

1771
03:01:51,940 --> 03:01:56,899
Stop making us look bad in front of ninja. We're sergeant griff from the popular web series red versus blue

1772
03:01:57,219 --> 03:01:59,219
You probably watched it about 10 years ago

1773
03:01:59,780 --> 03:02:01,540
What are you doing here?

1774
03:02:01,540 --> 03:02:05,219
Well, it's more than just the chief coming to fortnight. This map is too

1775
03:02:05,700 --> 03:02:08,659
It'll be in creative mode starting at 10 a.m. Eastern time tomorrow

1776
03:02:08,979 --> 03:02:10,979
Oh

1777
03:02:11,620 --> 03:02:13,620
Remember the time when I was in fortnight

1778
03:02:14,739 --> 03:02:16,739
I'm pretty sure it was called something

1779
03:02:18,020 --> 03:02:19,299
Hey, lord

1780
03:02:19,299 --> 03:02:24,659
Giving your favorite stop it. What's with the screen and maybe add your own personal touches to the map. Hey, wait

1781
03:02:24,899 --> 03:02:26,899
Does that mean we can have dance battles?

1782
03:02:27,459 --> 03:02:29,459
Come on ninja. What do you say?

1783
03:02:30,899 --> 03:02:34,500
Make it stop. I can't solve all your issues here. What do you want to do?

1784
03:02:35,379 --> 03:02:38,909
Oh, I got it. Oh wait that looked like I was versus blue donald

1785
03:02:40,209 --> 03:02:45,969
I'm here. Isn't that so awesome and so funny. Um, so what's awesome about that is that

1786
03:02:46,370 --> 03:02:53,729
Uh blood gulch was recreated in fortnight creative by this awesome creative team that call themselves atlas creative and

1788
03:03:01,889 --> 03:03:07,120
Oh my god, it's gonna be fun. Everything is in fortnight right now. So are you done for the season?

1789
03:03:08,780 --> 03:03:12,219
You know, I mean agent jones is uh, that really was a family guy joke

1790
03:03:13,739 --> 03:03:17,659
Remember the time that red versus blue invited us into fortnight and we played with ninja

1791
03:03:18,540 --> 03:03:19,899
It really is

1792
03:03:19,899 --> 03:03:21,899
I can't get over that

1793
03:03:22,299 --> 03:03:45,420

Are they because that we talked about that right when the three stooges get added to fortnight cascade then, you know

1798
03:04:05,420 --> 03:04:10,059
We're there and I am stoked to be welcome into rocket league's vibrant community in such a big way

1799
03:04:10,620 --> 03:04:16,700
I'm excited to work with psionics and monster cat to put together an ep for rocket league's music season

1800
03:04:16,940 --> 03:04:20,139
Fortnite is directed towards kids. Why do kids like all these older actors?

1801
03:04:20,139 --> 03:04:24,780
You can get the featured anthem in the item shop and grab my free banner all weekend long

03:05:02,739 --> 03:05:04,739
No, that's a germa 985 car

1808
03:05:07,299 --> 03:05:11,219
For every other one of us of like the thousands of us on twitch

1809
03:05:11,860 --> 03:05:13,860
I think cyan and pink looks great

1810
03:05:14,819 --> 03:05:19,489

1812
03:05:24,879 --> 03:05:26,879
I work with teal and pink

1813
03:05:30,510 --> 03:05:34,750
It's my favorite color scheme. So how don't you dare say anything about it?

1814
03:05:37,579 --> 03:05:39,579
xbox game pass december 15

1815
03:05:40,459 --> 03:05:47,090
Your next favorite game is a game that came out

1816
03:05:47,729 --> 03:05:54,159
20 years ago. It's not really your next favorite game. It's an old favorite of yours that you liked a while ago

1817
03:06:00,079 --> 03:06:04,430
All right, does everybody kind of hope that like the source code for skyrim gets lost

1818
03:06:06,270 --> 03:06:10,299
I'll say it

1819
03:06:10,299 --> 03:06:30,290
So they can't keep doing it. Could you say something so controversial?

1820
03:06:31,469 --> 03:06:33,149
I'm just saying like it

1821
03:06:33,149 --> 03:06:36,590
They gotta stop make they got they gotta stop. You gotta stop it

1822
03:06:37,309 --> 03:06:42,690
I was so brave to say

1823
03:06:45,299 --> 03:06:48,100
So brave

1824
03:06:48,100 --> 03:06:55,219
I mean like oh my god lol skyrim keeps coming out. They gotta stop doing that. I'm so different and contrary at our time

1825
03:07:00,739 --> 03:07:04,579
Actually, the real contrarian thing would say I hope they release skyrim for ps5

1826
03:07:05,219 --> 03:07:07,700
So i'm gonna say that

1827
03:07:07,700 --> 03:07:10,739
I really hope that they release skyrim for ps5 like unlocked

1828
03:07:16,579 --> 03:07:17,620
with like

1829
03:07:17,620 --> 03:07:19,620
10 better shaders or something

1830
03:07:21,659 --> 03:07:23,659
That's the real brave thing to say

1831
03:07:45,969 --> 03:07:53,860
GTA 5 is the one that should fill those shoes now. Yeah, we'll see when gta 6 decides to get announced on my phone

1832
03:07:54,020 --> 03:07:58,180
And there's so we can officially declare another

Grunts are also appearing in balloons and at pokestops and you can save shadow wooper from their villainous clutches

1836
03:08:07,540 --> 03:08:13,059
Make wooper your buddies take photos of it with ghosts. I'm huge and battle with it in go battle league

1837
03:08:13,379 --> 03:08:19,139
If you're enjoying wooper watch you'll love pokemon go's december community day. The camera looks awful this weekend

1838
03:08:19,459 --> 03:08:23,860
And be sure to check for it after the show to see how many to hide all my like things that I have here

1839
03:08:24,020 --> 03:08:29,299
During wooper watch i'm never gonna upgrade my camera because then you'll be able to see like the blemishes that are on my face

1840
03:08:29,379 --> 03:08:32,500
This it's blurred enough where you can't see any of the problems that I have

1841
03:08:33,700 --> 03:08:35,780
Got one right here. You have no idea. It's kind of blurry

1842
03:08:36,739 --> 03:08:41,739
I've got a little spot right in my eye right here. You can't see that. You have no idea

1843
03:08:42,620 --> 03:08:45,010
I'm in forever 720 never going up

Uh, all right, if one of the mods is around take off slow mode for one minute

1846
03:09:00,450 --> 03:09:02,450
Just have to be just chaos turn it off

1847
03:09:10,059 --> 03:09:11,500
One of the mods just said

1848
03:09:11,500 --> 03:09:17,120
fuck

1849
03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:23,389
Fuck people are getting timed out because they're spamming

1850
03:09:27,299 --> 03:09:30,040
I can't even read the chat. It's impossible

1851
03:09:30,579 --> 03:09:38,379
You picked the wrong time to get a drink

1852
03:09:39,180 --> 03:09:52,180
All right, you can put it back on put it back on

1853

Cool smash bros melee. Yeah, they really fucked that up, didn't they?

1865
03:10:54,020 --> 03:10:57,139
This next game was announced last year right here at the game awards

1866
03:10:57,299 --> 03:11:02,659
Developed by airship and supported by riot ruined king and now they're back to give you a first look at the gameplay

1867
03:11:02,819 --> 03:11:09,139
From this indie title the first ever single-player console game from the league of legends universe. This is ruined king

1868
03:11:10,979 --> 03:11:19,299
The first ever single-player console game ever you're like that's weird to say cut throats

1869
03:11:20,879 --> 03:11:22,879
Spirits

1870
03:11:24,350 --> 03:11:26,270
Monsters

1871
03:11:26,270 --> 03:11:29,090
When you live in bilgewater

1872
03:11:29,649 --> 03:11:36,959
You see some things let's start the party

1873
03:11:38,989 --> 03:11:43,870
Queen of bilgewater looking to bring order to this twisted town

1874
03:11:47,069 --> 03:11:50,750
The priestess of the great kraken unmoved by fear

1875
03:11:51,229 --> 03:11:53,229
This is destiny

1876
03:11:53,709 --> 03:11:59,389
The legend is by riot whose strength is only eclipsed by his kindness

1877
03:11:59,389 --> 03:12:05,629
I mean, they're technically still like an indie studio, right? Even though they grossed like a billion dollars in revenue last year

1878
03:12:13,459 --> 03:12:17,219
Are they no they know that's right. No, not anymore. It's not an indie studio

1879
03:12:20,379 --> 03:12:22,379
Did they say indie before this came on

1880
03:12:32,209 --> 03:12:34,209
They did what

1881
03:12:34,290 --> 03:12:39,879
That's my blade small indie studio blizzard

1882
03:12:40,659 --> 03:12:55,420
What brought together nothing good? I reckon all right. I read this wrong. I thought somebody in chat just put in all capitals

1883
03:12:55,500 --> 03:12:57,500
Fuck turn-based chat

1884
03:12:57,579 --> 03:13:02,219
But there was turn-based combat. I read it like a fuck turn-based chat like what the fuck i'm gonna talk like slow mode

1885
03:13:02,299 --> 03:13:05,500
All right, I thought they were making a slow mode console and pc in 2021

1886
03:13:06,620 --> 03:13:13,100

1903
03:14:55,250 --> 03:14:58,450
It's an honor to be in this category with such incredible games

1904
03:14:59,809 --> 03:15:04,850
Direction is nothing without a team to internalize it to make it their own and turn it into a game

1905
03:15:05,409 --> 03:15:11,409
And we're privileged to have such an amazing team cast outsourcing partners our partners at sony

Every single person that worked on touched this game helped shape it and a big thanks to my forward boss now partner evan wells

03:15:20,659 --> 03:15:23,700
You guided us through thick and thin while we made this game

1908
03:15:24,020 --> 03:15:29,100
Uh, I can't tell you how much I appreciate that. Thank you to the game awards and to all our fans. Cheers

1909
03:15:30,860 --> 03:15:33,100
I I mean

1910
03:15:33,819 --> 03:15:40,139
Last of us, right? We've still got one last award to present the big one game of the year presented by christopher nolan

1911
03:15:40,299 --> 03:15:45,420
I'm gonna turn what a tribute to all the nominees performed by the london. I'm taking my headphones up for this one

1912
03:15:47,420 --> 03:15:51,659
Like I said when people still see vr is kind of this like tech demo toy thing

1913
03:15:52,459 --> 03:15:55,260
Where it's like it's not really games. It's not a real game

1914
03:15:55,420 --> 03:16:00,219
It's like, you know look at your hands and like throw the bottles on the ground, right until people kind of stop seeing it

1915
03:16:00,219 --> 03:16:02,219
As that you'll never see a win like that

1916
03:16:03,329 --> 03:16:05,889
Um very gimmicky until people get that out of their heads

1917
03:16:07,659 --> 03:16:09,659
Fuck is this gta? What?

1918
03:16:10,430 --> 03:16:12,430
Am I missing gta 6?

1919
03:16:14,510 --> 03:16:17,309
Put it in putting my fucking headphones in what the fuck?

1920
03:16:20,940 --> 03:16:22,940
Oh, no, no, no, no

1921
03:16:32,319 --> 03:16:35,600

1922
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:40,190
um

1923
03:16:40,190 --> 03:16:44,159
Okay, I can hear it

1924
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:59,969
Anyways, um the fact that vr is still a toy

1925
03:17:00,930 --> 03:17:02,930
an expensive toy

1926
03:17:03,090 --> 03:17:07,969
Was born about the gate like the ads was so well paced. It was such a fun game

1927
03:17:07,969 --> 03:17:09,969
It was a game of the year in my game of the year in the year

1928
03:17:10,350 --> 03:17:15,969
515 whatever after having federated the african continent she set out to conquer road

1929
03:17:16,209 --> 03:17:23,969
It was on witnessing the consequences of this terrible battle that she decided to impose upon her people as strictly a vegetarian

1930
03:17:24,530 --> 03:17:34,239
Diet and it's in 1082 following the unexplained death of the king that she was crowned empress of spain

1931
03:17:34,879 --> 03:17:39,040
It's in fact to celebrate this event that rock and roll was invented

1932
03:17:39,520 --> 03:17:41,520
What the fuck in?

1933
03:17:41,979 --> 03:17:43,200
1789

1934
03:17:43,280 --> 03:17:51,200
Allied with the valiant japanese she discovered the real indies which had fallen into the hands of the bloody french

1935
03:17:54,299 --> 03:17:56,559
This was followed by the great devastation

1936
03:17:57,340 --> 03:18:02,239
The 100-year war that lucy adam ended before beginning the great reconstruction

1937
03:18:03,020 --> 03:18:10,860
And establishing a lasting peace by banishing all forms of currency and violence as well as the use of selfie sticks

1938
03:18:11,100 --> 03:18:12,700
in museums

1939
03:18:12,700 --> 03:18:14,459
Lucy are you with us?

1940
03:18:14,540 --> 03:18:16,540

Is this a cut scene is this filmed in real life is this

1942
03:18:21,500 --> 03:18:30,959
Push was that a cut scene?

1943

How bad have things gotten the german occupation has turned every neighbor into a possible enemy

1949

More resistant members, but that's much easier said than done

03:19:20,430 --> 03:19:23,149

03:22:50,350 --> 03:22:54,750
Four we're not sure what number but it's gonna happen at some point

1980
03:22:57,469 --> 03:23:08,899
Mass effect, I can't wait to see where bioware is gonna take that uh next. Um, very exciting

1981
03:23:08,899 --> 03:23:09,139

1982
03:23:09,139 --> 03:23:11,139
Well to present our final award

1983
03:23:11,379 --> 03:23:17,780
This man has created some of the most iconic films of all time some of which screened this summer in fortnight and on december 20th

1984
03:23:17,860 --> 03:23:23,540
I'll be sitting down for a conversation with him on youtube to talk about the home release of tenet and his illustrious career

1985
03:23:23,620 --> 03:23:29,620
And if you've got questions for him, which i'm sure you do send them our way using the hashtag ask nolan on twitter

But right now without further ado to present game of the year. It's my honor to introduce christopher nolan. Hey chris

1987
03:23:36,020 --> 03:23:39,860
This guy couldn't care less about this whole show. It's an honor to be part of the game awards

1988
03:23:40,340 --> 03:23:44,979
I had bathrobe on i've always been interested in telling stories that that immerse the audience

1989
03:23:45,299 --> 03:23:50,420
I like movies that that unfold in unexpected ways and pull people into a world

1990
03:23:51,139 --> 03:23:54,899
When I look at video games, I see a lot of parallels with that kind of storytelling

1991
03:23:55,620 --> 03:24:00,899
How players agency and choice intersect with more traditional storytelling methods. It's uh,

1992
03:24:01,459 --> 03:24:03,479
Exciting to see and really quite groundbreaking

1993
03:24:04,579 --> 03:24:09,700
Tonight all six nominees for game of the year are true masterworks in immersive storytelling

1994
03:24:10,100 --> 03:24:17,959
To pay tribute to them, please welcome from abbey road studios the london philharmonic orchestra conducted by my old friend lauren balfe

1995
03:24:21,120 --> 03:24:23,120

03:24:24,459 --> 03:24:27,020

1997
03:24:29,520 --> 03:24:33,920
Not that wouldn't I not this one. I didn't play this one, but I wasn't really that wouldn't really into it

1998
03:24:55,600 --> 03:24:57,600
Are there other nominees?

1999
03:24:57,680 --> 03:25:01,940
Is this it the only nominee?

2000
03:25:03,139 --> 03:25:12,370
Okay, here we go

2001
03:25:12,370 --> 03:25:16,209
People really like this doom right people really liked all these but I mean

2002
03:25:19,709 --> 03:25:22,030
It's hades angle. This is not let's be honest

2003
03:25:32,399 --> 03:25:37,040
This looked really fun, but I never played it. So I can't give a real opinion on this year. I really can't

2004
03:25:38,239 --> 03:26:00,510
Is this the favorite is last of us two the favorite?

2005
03:26:02,620 --> 03:26:04,620
Well, I don't know. Maybe there'll be an upset

2006
03:26:04,700 --> 03:26:12,690
I'll tell you who i'm rooting for i'm rooting for i'll tell you i'll probably rooting for i'm rooting for hades

2007
03:26:13,329 --> 03:26:15,659
If hades doesn't win

2008
03:26:15,659 --> 03:26:17,659
Yeah, there it is. Let's go

2009
03:26:18,700 --> 03:26:19,899
Let's go

2010
03:26:19,899 --> 03:26:31,489
I had hades doesn't get like half the screen time the final fantasy 7. Okay, I was gonna say what the fuck is that?

2011
03:26:32,450 --> 03:26:56,700

2012
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:01,600
hades doom

2013
03:27:01,600 --> 03:27:03,600

2014
03:27:04,399 --> 03:27:06,399
I could you know, it's been a while, right?

2015
03:27:07,120 --> 03:27:18,899
I want hades to win

2016
03:27:18,899 --> 03:27:21,459
Half-life alex isn't on this list, which is dumb

2017
03:27:22,100 --> 03:27:27,950
Like I actually can't believe that what a big step

2018
03:27:28,510 --> 03:27:32,750
In like the space if they were to win game of the year, but whatever we can't let's not complain

2019
03:27:32,750 --> 03:27:34,030
That sounded fantastic

2020
03:27:34,030 --> 03:27:36,030

03:29:22,659 --> 03:29:29,379
Thanks to our game awards team and all the incredible developers and publishers around the world who made this show possible

2049
03:29:29,860 --> 03:29:35,940
Under very trying circumstances. I did actually in this elder room. Take care. Stay safe. Happy holidays

2050
03:29:36,020 --> 03:29:39,459

2052
03:29:45,549 --> 03:29:50,930
427 000 concurrent viewers. Holy shit. That's a lot

2053
03:29:55,260 --> 03:29:57,889
Okay, here are my thoughts

2054
03:29:58,129 --> 03:30:07,540
Is there an after credits like thing?

2055
03:30:07,620 --> 03:30:09,620
Is there gonna be an after credits like secret after credits ending?

2056
03:30:20,479 --> 03:30:27,040
Um half-life alex being like nominated for one thing or like two things and winning one of them just because it happened to be a vr game

2057
03:30:28,159 --> 03:30:30,399
That's upsetting it is

2058
03:30:30,559 --> 03:30:37,440
But whatever, you know, whatever elden ring is vaporware. No, it's not

2059
03:30:44,540 --> 03:30:46,299
It's never coming out

2060
03:30:46,299 --> 03:30:49,340
Well, I mean george r.r martin's working on it. So maybe you're right

2061
03:30:50,139 --> 03:30:52,139
He'll talk about it for the next 10 years

2062
03:30:52,620 --> 03:30:54,379
And then we'll never see it

2063
03:30:54,379 --> 03:31:00,510
I've been waiting for the winds of winter for like seven and a half years. So

2064
03:31:01,069 --> 03:31:06,770
That's very possible

2065
03:31:06,770 --> 03:31:13,940
Uh, all right. Yeah, i'm gonna go that's it for me. That's all I had planned

2066
03:31:14,500 --> 03:31:16,540

2067
03:31:16,540 --> 03:31:24,340
I missed the elden ring. I'm kind of annoyed by that. But you know, whatever look kind of tired today

2068
03:31:24,899 --> 03:31:32,159
Do I look tired? Maybe a little that was a show right? That was an award show

2069
03:31:32,719 --> 03:31:45,540
What are we doing tomorrow? What are we doing tomorrow? That's a really good question. We'll figure it out. I had fun
