1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,460
So hey, what's going on everybody? Welcome to Total Distortion.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,140
This is a game that just, you know, recently came out 20 years ago and...

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,859
This guy sure does talk a lot of shit. That's all I remember.

4
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:26,519
Let's go to bed. Falling asleep? That's okay.

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,119
The dreams are racing down the road. The winner will take over your mind.

6
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:36,119
Stop the bad dreams from entering your brain with the dream gun.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,359
Okay. So my dream gun's on the right. I don't want that dream there. I seem to be...

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,020
Okay. Well, this is...

9
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,659
I'm like real fucked up right now. Son of a bitch.

10
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:12,569
It's hit me every single time. I didn't even get hit by that. It's bullshit. No.

11
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,579
Oh! Look at my metal face.

12
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,900
Can I cut? Can I counteract this?

13
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,060
Minus 46. Holy shit.

14
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:34,780
Index of books. Uh, there's a lot of books here.

15
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,859
Let's go. Let's go with Facebook book one.

16
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:43,859
That looks like a good book. I wonder what this is going to be about.

17
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:45,780
I wonder what tale this is going to tell me.

18
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:55,700
Oh, it's in fact not a book at all. It's just some guy.

19
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:05,060
Oh, this is a good book. I like the part where the princess revolts against the alien.

20
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:17,030
Sledgehammer Fists. Battle practice. That sounds like a pretty good book. It could be anything,

21
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:25,129
right? This is also not a book. How do I punch again?

22
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:33,300
Am I on the left or the right? I'm pretty sure I'm on the left, but I'm dead.

23
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:42,569
So the purpose of this whole game, from what I remember when I was like 12 years old,

24
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,120
is you have to make music videos with their crappy video editor,

25
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,199
and then you have to sell them to people on Earth.

26
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:57,939
Let's go ahead and have a car. That'll be the opening scene.

27
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,819
Yeah, we're going to have the second scene will be some cement because we need to be solidified.

28
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,580
We need to be set in stone. We need to make sure people know that we're like stonescaped.

29
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:12,659
And we'll have, I guess, I don't know, this car stretching like a clay car.

30
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,099
And then we're going to have guitars flying around.

31
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:21,219
Scene three will be pretty easy, too. So we'll have stones to show how solidified and how stone,

32
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:25,780
how rock solid we are. There's like a knife flying by, too.

33
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,360
All right, let's take a look at our music video that we've created.

34
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:49,960
Dogshit Burrito. Oh, man, that fucking sucked.

35
00:03:51,979 --> 00:04:01,340
Hamburger bun, peanut butter, cream cheese. You know, I love mustard on my peanut butter

36
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,099
and cream cheese sandwiches. And you know, let's go a little strawberry jam.

37
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,539
That's good, too. Let's go ahead and make it.

38
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:16,839
You would have to pay me like at least 15 to 20 dollars to eat this sandwich.

39
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,620
I would not eat this for anything less than that, but we're going to see how it tastes.

40
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:36,339
This is going to be disgusting. Milk, hot sauce, and like Coca-Cola.

41
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,899
Oh, God. How is that good?

42
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,350
You want a lettuce sandwich?

43
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:01,060
Do not come any closer. You know what? Fuck it. Guitar fight.

44
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:07,459
Yeah, eat shit. We're going to be shooting guitar.

45
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:10,860
Did he serve?

46
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,670
That's bullshit.

47
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,910
Or I will destroy you.

48
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,029
No, fuck you. I'm going to kill you with my guitar.

49
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,629
I'm going to do you a C and then a B. Hit him. Hit him.

50
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:35,420
All right, so I spent some time in the video editor. I had a couple of sandwiches.

51
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,300
I had the blueberry and sardine sandwich and I started to feel a little bit more creative.

52
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,860
And I decided, you know what? I'm going to spend like three to four hours on making a new music

53
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,339
video, which I did. And here it is. How could you pass this up if you were a producer?

54
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:54,139
Let's go ahead and take a look. Should I bring the lights down, please? Okay. Enjoy.

55
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:24,779
Now we're cooking with gas.

56
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,860
All right, let's shop this thing around. Let's make a sale here.

57
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:34,069
Hi. I've called you before, but hello again, Stevie. Stevie Groovy.

58
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,110
Thank you very much. I think we can possibly, you know, send it to you right now.

59
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:47,240
Here you go. Please come on.

60
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,959
Thanks. I'll get back to you after I've taken a look at it.

61
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,240
Come on. You have to like this one.

62
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,199
I'll take that video. I'm not sure it's hit material.

63
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:59,930
What? What? Hold on. All right. She's going to take the video. I don't think I've ever

64
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:05,610
sold a video on this game before in my entire like 29 years on the planet. Hold on. Okay.

65
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,509
Like this. I can't. What's your offer? What are you going to give me for that?

66
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:10,550
Here's my offer.

67
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:20,500
10 million, 20 million, 500 bucks. That's it. I kind of want to pitch it around. I mean, if she,

68
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,290
if she'll take it for 500, maybe somebody else will take it for 600.

69
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:32,889
Hi. You don't know me, but I just want to say, how are you? We can, we can cut to the chase here.

70
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:37,529
I'm a big fan. Yeah. You know that I'm going to send you a music video right now and you let

71
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:42,329
me know if you like it. And if you have, you know, if you have more than 500 bucks on your hand,

72
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:48,329
then maybe you and I can, you know, work together. All right. Let's go see what he says.

73
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:58,360
I don't, I don't speak. I don't speak this. What are you saying? Did you just hung up on me?

74
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,060
Yeah. Stevie Groove send video to Stevie Groovy. I'll take the 500 bucks, please.

75
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,459
Thanks. I'll get back to you after I've taken a look at it.

76
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:10,699
Yeah. You've already seen it. Trust me. But I'm not sure it's hit material.

77
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:16,540
I know. I know it's not a hit. I'm aware of that right now, but just give me the money. Thank you.

78
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:28,759
I will take it. She dropped her offer by $200. You tell me I've been spending $50 per call.

79
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,679
This past like 15 minutes, just jumping around, shopping around my video. I've dropped like $500

80
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,480
and collect calls to people. The $300 fucking dollars she just gave me won't even cover the

81
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,600
cost of these phone calls. How am I supposed to break even? You know, in this, in this economy,

82
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:56,649
how am I supposed to break even in this economy? You were hot. Guess what? You're not.
